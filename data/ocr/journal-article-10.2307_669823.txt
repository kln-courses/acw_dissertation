<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Prehistory and Ethnohistory of the Carache Area in Western Venezuela. ERIKA WAGNER. (Yale University Publications in Anthropol- ogy, Number 71.) New Haven: Department of Anthropology, Yale University, 1967. ix, 137 pp., 4 appendices, bibliography, 40 figures (2 foldout), 20 plates, 4 tables. $4.50 (paper). Reviewed by JOHN LADD Harvard University In this book, Dr. Wagner reports on her excavations undertaken in 1963/64 at four sites in the Carache region of northwestern Vene- zuela. Her method of excavation consisted of 2 m x 2 m pits dug in arbitrary 25 cm levels. Excavation refuse was screened and all cul- tural material was retained for detailed and exhaustive technical analysis. Using her own ceramic classification system, a combination of Rouse's modal approach and Willey's type- variety system, in the interests of simplicity she arrives at a "purely descriptive" classifica- tion based on a small number of types and an absence of classes (i.e., varieties, in Willey's system). Working with her ceramic types and the nonceramic remains, she then groups the material, according to a modified McKern sys- tem, into three phases that she labels as ethnic groups, the "Miquimdi People," the "Mirinday People," and the "La Ermita People." The chronological ordering of these, both on the basis of radiocarbon dates and comparisons with other established chronologies, places Miquimd as the earliest with a radiocarbon date of A.D. 650, Mirinday as extending from A.D. 1000 into historic times, and La Ermita, a colonial structure, also in historic times. Ap- parently there is no continuity between the Miquimdi and the Mirinday phases. In her comparisons with other regions out- side the Carache area, Dr. Wagner finds simi- larities between her Miquimfi phase and Reichel-Dolmatoff's Momfl phase in Columbia in such plastic techniques as punctation and pinching, but unfortunately she does not specify in which part of the 1000-year Momil sequence these resemblances occur. In a similar fashion, she compares the Mirinday phase very vaguely with Baudez's Period VI in lower Central America and with the Chiriqui and Parita regions in Panama, but again without specifying traits or phases for these areas, nor does she include the primary sources for the Parita region in her bibliography. In discussing cultural patterns for western</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 1025 Venezuela, Dr. Wagner's research in the Carache region adds a third pattern, the Sub-Andean, to the traditional Andean and Tropical Forest pat- terns recognized earlier by Acosta Saignes and Cruxent and Rouse. The Sub-Andean is charac- terized by such features as maize-based subsis- tence and an absence of terracing, stone con- struction, or elaborate burials. Cultural elabora- tion, on the other hand, is expressed through more elaborately decorated pottery with com- plex shapes. Although the book provides a thorough de- scription of the material recovered in the exca- vations, has excellent photographs and thor- ough technical analysis of the pottery and corn recovered, and lists 33 radiocarbon dates, this reviewer finds the manner of presentation con- fusing and the significance of the technical analyses unclear. Her use of the terms "Mirin- day People" or "Miquimui People" to refer to archeological assemblages amounts to a kind of anthropomorphism. Although her ethnological reconstruction from the material remains is ex- cellent, she makes very little use of the four early Spanish sources that she believes are of value. Her description of two features of the Tropical Forest pattern, "simple burials . . . no graves," requires elaboration. As one final point, I find it difficult to believe that there was no stylistic change in the 540 years of the Mi- rinday phase. Might not excavation by natural stratigraphic units and a finer breakdown of the ceramic types into classes have provided more information on this? In short, though containing much of value, I believe the study could have provided a more informative culture history of the region if it had been more specific in certain key areas of analysis.</page></plain_text>
