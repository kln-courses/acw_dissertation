<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANITA RAMPAL* School Science in Search of a Democratic Order? 'Science for liberation' reverberated through the history of western education, in the last century, as a refrain of the liberal reformers. Recently it has echoed once again in our country, though somewhat ambivalently-on the one hand, in the ambiguous verbosity of the official slogans professing 'Prosperity through Cultivation of Scientific Temper' (a notion as elusive as 'democracy' !), and on the other hand, in the impassioned instrumentality of 'Science as a Social Activism'l (a concept still being delineated through practice). The school seems to be the common epicenter of both strains of activity: the vacuous yet celebrated tremors of newer official policies invoking 'scientific literacy' as well as the silent yet determnined vibrations of voluntary activism working towards 'scientific awareness'. However, an appropriate model for science within school, rooted in our specific socio-cultural context is yet to be evolved. The model we have received originated early this century and was shaped by complex forces serving the dominant interests of a stratified society. This paper attempts to analyse some factors that have influenced the teaching of science in school, broadly within the perspective acquired by participating in the development of the Science Teaching Programme2-4 in Madhya Pradesh, locally known as 'Vishika' -an acronym for Vigyan Shikshan Karyakram. It is of particular interest to note how curriculum in science, a discipline proclaimed for its democratising potential, has itself perpetrated various forms of pedagogic hegemony within the school while being subservient to dominant pressures from wvi thout. ABSTRACT SCIENCE CURRICULUM Despite appeals to its liberating potential deriving from its methods of objective observation and analytic abstraction, which could be directed to develop deep social insights, the science curriculum, as it enmerged at the turn of this century, conformed completely with the cr-iteria of 'pure' theoretical knowledge laid down by the elite Fellow, Nehru Memorial Museum and Library, Teeni Murti House, New Delhi. Social Scientist, Vol. 20, Nos. 7-8, July-August 1992</page><page sequence="2">SCHOOL SCIENCE IN SEARCH OF A DEMOCRATIC ORDER 51 academia of an aristocratic culture. In John Dewey's words, by making scientific knowledge 'aloof from the practical needs of the mass of men, advocates of scientific education put themselves at a strategic disadvantage'.5 Emphasising the distinction between the requirements of a profession and a curriculum for school he wrote, 'whatever natural science may be for the specialist, for educational purposes it is knowledge of the conditions of human action'.6 'The functions which science has to perform in the curriculum is that which it has performed for the race: emancipation from local and temporary incidents of experience and the opening of intellectual vistas unobscured by the accidents of personal habit and predilection'.7 The curriculum, however, did not respond to this vision. What emerged then and has continued to provide the basic framework for school education ever since, was a model of 'pure' abstract science, in consonance with the demands of logical coherence as viewed by professional practitioners of the discipline. No alternative frameworks were sought; in fact, alternatives, if they did emerge, were authoritatively dismissed. Analysing the historical and socio- political forces that shaped the current model of school science, Hodson and Prophet8 give an interesting account of the changes that occurred in the British educational system during the later half of the nineteenth century. Taking off from Layton's9 work they focus on the two major alternative conceptions available then: the 'science of the common things' and 'pure laboratory science'. The former was initiated by an influential clergyman, Rev. Dawas, with the aim to instil self- confidence and integrity of thought amongst the children of the poor, in the attempt to ultimately improve their moral and religious condition. The curriculum was consciously designed within the cultural context of the labouring classes and, in Layton's words, 'was no crumb of upper class education charitably dispensed'.10 Prominence was given to the applied sciences such as mechanics and agricultural chemistry to provide familiar experiences for the exercise of reason, speculation and imagination. The success of the programme aind its imminent expansion to all elementary schools was viewed as a major threat to the social hierarchy; it was feared that the classics-based education for the higher orders, which had insistently excluded instruction in science, would prove ineffective for the domination of a 'scientifically' trained mass of poor. Voices from various influential quarters rose to express the perceived social danger in imparting a superior education to tlhose inferior in position. The views of eminent scientists like Lyell and Faraday echoed in the Report of the Public School Commnission set up in 1861, explicitly stating that 'from a political point of view, it is not only an unhealthy but also a dangerous state of things in some respects, that the material world should be very much better known by the middle classes of society than by the upper classes.'1l A double-edged campaign backed by the Times newspaper advocated the introduction</page><page sequence="3">52 SOCIAL SCIENTIST of 'pure' science, fit for the 'superior' mind, in the liberal curriculum for the higher orders and, simultaneously, a halt to the practical scientific education of the lower orders since it had become 'too good' and expensive for them and was 'too far above basic literacy (required) for Bible reading.'12 Science was soon removed from the elementary school curriculum and the Revised Code of 1862 sought legitimacy on the grounds of inadequate funds and trained teachers. It was further asserted that a 'knowledge of common things was not to be obtained by the direct study of science, but through country walks, star gazing and domestic experiences.'13 Two decades later when it did reappear in the school curriculum it was in a form very different from that envisioned by the radical 'science for liberation' advocates. Yet, ironically, it was justified in terms of the prevailing liberal tradition with its devotion to the discipline of the mind and its accent on the exercise of reason and logic. The goal of 'pure' science in schools, as expressed by its new supporters, was to inculcate habits of 'value-free' and 'disinterested' inquiry 'for its own sake' in order to prepare future scientists for the universities. In the words of an eminent professor, teaching of science in schools was to be 'a means of sifting out of the great mass of the people those golden grains of genius which are now too often lost amongst the sands of mediocrity'.14 Science in the school curriculum thus became defined as a highly selective sieve to sort out those few who conformed to the image of the 'pure scientist'. Indeed, the mass of the populace for whom it was a resource assessable only in theory, were effectively deprived of any meaningful education in science, owing to its intended abstraction and aloofness from matters of their everyday lives and belief systems. Eggleston15 points out that this was in consonance with a general shift in the educational ideology at that time and a consequent redefinition of high status knowledge as that which was not immediately useful in a vocation or occupation. Layton16 affirms that even now school subjects, in their drive towards greater academic respectability, tend to become exceedingly abstract and remote from pupils' real life concerns, thus promoting in them an attitude of resignation and disenchantment. Asserting that such resignation is an express intention of the 'hidden' curriculum, Eggleston further exemplifies that 'the purpose of the mathematics curriculum is not only to enable pupils to learn mathematics but also to allow some to understand that they cannot learn mathematics and to acquire a suitable respect for those who can.'17 Thus legitimising the superior occupational status the abler pupils ultimately acquire. In an interesting analysis of the origin of the modern science text, Strube and Lynch18 trace the change from the 'conversationalist' texts of the nineteenth century to the 'formalist' ones currently in use. Most of the earlier texts meant to introduce into schools a 'science of common</page><page sequence="4">SCHOOL SCIENCE IN SEARCH OF A DEMOCRATIC ORDER 53 things' were in the form of a discourse, drawing analogies from common life and using simple models or demonstrations. The style endowed science with a 'very human face'; it seemed less concerned with imparting knowledge than sound 'habits of thinking.' The formalist texts which began to dominate around 1880 (the time 'formal' science appeared in school) are strikingly similar to many modern texts for advanced science courses-highly structured, characteristically devoid of vivid or figurative forms of speech, demanding 'a high level of abstraction and logical analysis plus the ability to follow reasoned argument from a difficult, remote context.'19 Thus in what evolved as the acceptable format for school science, the very spirit of science-of exploration and curiosity about everyday life-was conspicuously absent. The desire to communicate was set aside by the intention to inform. Indeed, the immediate accessibility of the 'common' model, congruent with the concerns of the majority, was almost obliterated in favour of the impregnability of the 'pure' 'disembedded'20 version, described by the dictates of a minority. INNOVATIONS IN SCIENCE TEACHING The last three decades have witnessed a spate of curriculum reform in the west. A plethora of planned innovations for the teaching of science have been attempted with emphasis on 'discovery,' 'enquiry' or 'child- centred' methods, demanding a more democratic environment within the classroom. The curricula, though changed, have largely remained anchored to the old paradigm of good science for better scientists. In Young's2l words, 'science teaching . began and continues with its main purpose to maintain the supply of future scientists. This has two inter- related and in effect self justifying outcomes--the mass scientific and technological ignorance of a people in an increasingly technologically dominated society, who see themselves as dependent on experts in more and more aspects of their life, and a community of scientists who see the knowledge which they are responsible for producing and validating as necessarily not available to the community at large.' He argues that even in the Nuffield era the emphasis has remained on abstract 'technically sweet' science, dissociated from its applications and broader societal implications. The fundamental nature of the curriculum has not radically altered yet educational rhetoric in this century has, gradually but markedly, shifted its focus from the liberal metaphor of 'science for liberation' to the more instrumental yet somewhat ambiguous slogan of 'science for modernisation'. Layton22 delineates the two proclaimed aims of the new curricula as firstly, to increase substantially the national stock of scientists and technologists required to gain supremacy in industrial and military research and, secondly, to build a scientifically literate citizenry deemed essential in both the modernisation and development</page><page sequence="5">i SOCIAL SCIENTIST contexts. Indeed, as Esland23 points out, the new curricula emphasising pupil participation were a part of a larger public relations campaign to reverse the declining popularity of science and to reclaim a climate of public opinion in which more funds could freely be made available. The movement for curricular reform originated in the early sixties in countries of the North but were soon imported or suitably adapted by the newly independent developing nations. Science with its proclaimed transformationist potential served as an attractive mandate for national development. Third World countries attributed their poverty and backwardness to the deficit of a 'scientific mentality,' assumed to be significantly diffused in the developed world and often identified as the diacritical factor singularly responsible for its progress and advancement. However, the twin goals towards which the global movement for innovation directed itself, namely, the delivery of an elite cadre of professionals as well as a scientifically 'tempered' populace, were obstensibly mutually incompatible. Science education has thus been faced by a major dilemma arising out of this incongruity of purposes. Most countries in the west apparently resolved it by fragmenting the curriculum into 'academic science' for the 'able' pupils, with its explicit cognitive goals, and non academic science,' regarded less respectable by virtue of its emphasis on 'relevance'/utility' for the less-able pupils. The academic science courses are awarded high status owing to their perceived 'difficulty' characterised by decontextualised abstraction, emphasis on written presentation, use of individual rather than group work, high competitiveness and remoteness from real-life knowledge. The non-academic science courses, on the other hand, are relegated to the low-status category by virtue of their perceived triviality and, in Hodson's24 words, are characterised by their concreteness of knowledge, emphasis on oral presentation, use of group activities and relevance to everyday concerns. However, a more equitable way of resolving the dilemma, as suggested by Fensham,25 is through the policy of containment, whereby a specialised science education is confined only to the later years of schooling and not allowed to encroach upon the earlier curriculum. In fact, a similar system is followed by Thailand where the academic science curriculum is available only after pupils leave lower secondary school. Layton25 argues that there is little evidence to suggest that such a policy of containment would either lengthen the period of time needed to subsequently specialise in scienice or in anyway diminish the pool from which the specialist students emerge. India too has followed a. policy of one science for all. Despite occasional pressures from educational quarters, the policy makers have resisted permitting a plurality of science courses to conform with pupils' differential academic status. The single science course has, however, been more inclined towards the 'academic' (which, in this</page><page sequence="6">SCIIOOL SCIENCE IN SEARCH OF A DEMOCRATIC ORDER 55 case, could be termed a euphemism for 'utterly incomprehensible' and 'blatantly irrelevant') and less to the 'relevant.' In response to the New Education Policy, the Report of the Working Group on Science Education for the First Ten Years of Schooling (1987) has perceptibly pointed out that science and rnaths education in our country has remained almost irretrievably examination-centred. It goes on to state that 'a self-perpetuating and self-propagating retrogressive system has generated and extended from the universities to the primary schools;'27 subsequently, on the pretext of keeping abreast of the current knowledge explosion, the child is mercilessly subjected to an avalanche of (often irrelevant) information. The report however flounders when it confesses that 'the main purpose of learning science, that is, the development of 'scientific literacy,' has never been attempted,' for its delineation of the 'dimensions of scientific literacy' are, to say the least, utterly confounding. The authors seem so enmeshed by the 'academic-relevant' dilemma that their recommendations appear to vacillate most incoherently; this is particularly evident in the following excerpt on requisite manipulative skills; Maintenance of bullock carts, cycle and scooter; changing of fuse wire; using thermometer and balance; To handle domestic animals; Use and care of microscope, meter stick, camera, calculator, tape- recorder; Use of following equipments: graduated cylinder, timing device, sphygmomanometer. **28 At this point I stop, overwhelmed by my own illiteracy, unable to comprehend, even literally, this last word! The dilemma is thus apparently difficult to resolve especially since, despite the best of policy intentions, the inequities of our society inevitably intrude almost giving a farcical twist to every new official recommendation. THE VISI-IIKA: A NEW EXPERIMFNT The Vigyan Shikshan Karyakram embodying one attempt to forge compatibility between intellectual credibility and utility (and probably the only one to be incorporated into the government school system of our country), was initiated in 1972 by a fortuitous collaboration between voluntary activists, professional scientists and school teachers. It was a low-cost, activity-based endeavour to somehow embed academic science within the socio-envirornmental context of predominantly rural children. I'aking cognisance of the high dropout rate of pupils after Class VIII, curriculum gave priority to such specific skills and fundamental concepts that would help develop a critical scientific attitude for life, deliberately excluding some which merely satisfied criteria of relevance laid down by the discipline.</page><page sequence="7">56 SOCIAL SCIENTIST Indeed the express emphasis on the use of low-cost equipment and indigenously designed apparatus made from locally available materials provided an incentive to teachers to exercise their own creative skills. It also symbolised an assertion of self-reliance. Pedagogically it was important for students to feel comfortable and familiar with the apparatus so that it alleviated the overwhelming sense of alienation and mystification that is normally associated with science lessons, not just in the rural but also in our city schools. However, this feature of the programme was often conveniently co- opted into the familiar discourse of 'low-status' curricula by critics, who classified it as 'Pichhda Vigyan' or 'backward science'. Consequently, political as well as parental pressure had to be convincingly combatted; many an occasion was, however, judiciously exploited to conduct informal discussions about broader issues related to the sicence-technology-society interaction in a developmental context. But as more and more 'hard' technology is pumped into the otherwise barren desert of our education system, it becomes increasingly difficult to emphasise the efficacy of low-tech 'humanistic' pedagogical practices. The basic model for Vishika, conforming to the 'enquiry' method, was initially inspired by the innovative projects undertaken in the West. Children are encouraged to perform experiments in groups of four, collectively discuss their observations and draw inferences therefrom. The textbook has been replaced by a workbook providing a sequence of instructions and questions to guide enquiry. The radical shift in approach was meant to change the existing didactic and authoritarian method (which, incidentally is followed in the best private urban schools too) with its reliance on passive, unquestioning and rote learning in order to establish a more open and active environment within the classroom. Moreover, the rigorous re-orientation of teachers (who were often themselves inadequately trained in basic sciences) in the form of extensive discussions, debates and a regular informal dialogue between them and the so-called experts was expected to shake their complacency, make them more open to possible divergence in thought and instill in them a sense of self confidence and purposefulness. Indeed, the spirit of free discussion and enquiry helped to provoke teachers to actually 'de-expertise' the experts so that the programme could emerge as a truly shared construction. It was hoped that the unusually open interaction between teachers and resource persons would help define a new culture of learninig which the teachers would, in turn, be inspired to share with their pupils. Other forms of authority directly influencing the curriculum were also challenged. The traditional examination with its stress on the agility to spew out memorised 'facts' was replaced by an open-book one, more in congruence with the demands of enquiry learning. This was a fortuitous achievement and became the sustaining strength of the</page><page sequence="8">SCHOOL SCIENCE IN SEARCH OF A DEMOCRATIC ORDER 57 programme. Other innovative attempts at curricular change have floundered basically because they were compelled to submit to the traditional board examination, in which the administration rarely allows much intervention. In Vishika not only was the pattern of the Class VIII board examination changed but so were the related procedures for setting a question paper and evaluating the answer- sheets. The annual examination paper is collectively composed by a group of teachers during a special workshop, an ostensible violation of the usual official norms for confidentiality. Constructive discussion has been stressed as essential for framing a creative question or deciding norms for its fair evaluation. Requisite secrecy is, however, restored by authorising an official moderator to put together different questions and compose the final paper from the various alternative versions prepared during the meeting. BAL VIGYANIK: A PHILOSOPHICAL FALLACY? The Vishika workbook is named Bal Vigyanik, which literally reads Child Scientist. The inspiration for the title can be traced back to the pupil-as-scientist trends of the sixties with a major emphasis on in.culcating scientific enquiry by making the child vicariously experience process of 'real' science. However critical analyses of those curricula has led to the growing realisation that such reforms lacked a truly child-centred perspective. Extensive research has now shown that the stress on a logical rather than a psychological ordering of subject matter and the increased demand on 'discovery' through detailed scientific procedures has not only rendered science more difficult for children29 but has also failed to reveal any significant improvement in their ability to employ those processes, particularly in situations outside the classroom.30, 1 The pupil-as-scientist curricula have proved inadequate on predominantly two grounds: the outdated nature of the philosophical stance implicit in them and their inability to address children's belief-systems. An examination of the underlying epistomological foundations of these curricula reveals that they espouse the classical inductive-empiricist approach towards kniowledge, the main premise of which is that scientific enquiry relies on concepts inductively inferred from discrete sensory impressions. Such curricula were substantially influenced by Robert Gagne who presented a hierarchy of science processes which (stated in increasing order of complexity) included observation, classification, measurement, drawing of conclusions, making operational definitions, formulation of hypotheses, control of variables, interpretation of data and experimentation.32 Gagne placed unibiased observation at the very foundation of science learning, emphasising that physical characteristics of objects need to be systematically observed and</page><page sequence="9">58 SOCIAL SCIENTIST discriminated 'using all externally oriented senses' and that 'all the differential attributes of objects previously learned as discriminations need to be used for establishing (generalised) concepts.'33 Such a view of the scientific method had loing been proved to be fatally flawed on the grounds that observation can never be truly 'objective' for, what one 'sees' depends only in part on the immediate sensory impressions and more on accumulated past experience and expectation. Thus the observations we make essentially depend on the preconceived theories we have in mind and, therefore, cannot be an infallible basis for scientific knowledge. Notwithstanding our own intuitive and psychological make-up that ofteni seems to compel uis to behave inductively in our everyday lives, justification for inductive generalisation as the basis of enquiry had almost been abandoned by the turn of this century. Yet the commitment to empiricism and induction authoritatively persisted in science education and even conveniently coalesced with the progressive child-centred philosophies, emphasising direct experience and individual enquiry, to produce the almost mesmeric notion of 'discovery learning'. Questioning the philosophical validity of the tenets of the discovery method, Hodson31 argues that such methods not only underestimated the complex relationship between observation and theory, but also misinterpreted the nature of the activities of the scientific community in validating and disseminating scientific knowledge. In keeping with the current philosophies of science and physiology, he stresses that the acquisition of new knowledge depends only in part on the structure and organisation of that knowledge, being predominantly determined by the learner's existing conceptuLal framework, Observing carefully, recording observations accurately and making generalisations are useful skills for children to learn but are certainly not the means of discovering new concepts. The pupil-as-scientist curricula have almost mocked and reduced scientific method to a mechanical ritual, ignoring the role of informed speculation and constructive imagination in processes of discovery. In an almost prophetic vein the philosopher Nagel had written, as early as 1959, that 'thle student should be disabused of the common misconception that a collection of facts is either the beginning or the goal of scientific enquiry' and '.... should be made to recognise that the concepts to whiclh he is introduced have not been obtained by a process of simnple abstraction from empirical data, but that they are intellectual creations, often suggested by the data, and are the products of a constructive imagiiiation'74 The new philosophies of science have been inclined towards the 'construjctivist' position as opposed to the 'realist' view-point, which perceives reality as a stable configuration of objective facts, open to the identitical inspection of all. Constructivism, on the other hand, is the belief that reality is personally negotiated so that each enquirer perceives a world depending on her (or his) preconceptions, and where</page><page sequence="10">SCIOOL SCIENCE IN SEARCH- OF A DEMOCRATIC ORDER 59 agreement, which constitutes factual knowledge, is a specific collective negotiation, with an often limited temporal validity.35 Indeed the view that knowledge should be impersonal and detached is often rejected in favour of the development of reason informed by passion. Thus knowledge that has been individually construed or 'truth' that has been personally appropriated is what ultimately constitutes the 'private' constrict of the learner. A truly learner-based or child-centred education programme would necessarily have to be congruent with the constructivist stance and take into account pupils' personal constructions of experience in order to establish meaningful communication. For, successful communication between individuals depends not so much on the commonality of their construct systems, but upon the degree of empathy they have for each other's constructs.36 The last decade has witnessed a growing body of research in science education attempting to explore pupil's constructs and 'alternative frameworks'.37 The new curricula based on conceptual schemes had emphasised on a coherenit system of ideas as perceived by scientists, ignoring the fact that such ostensibly logical connections may be far from obvious to children. Moreover, little attention was paid to the ideas children themselves generate as part of their life experiences. It has now been found that children hold stable and tenacious views regarding the world around them and these preconceived notions are often at variance with established scientific concepts.38 Unless consciously addressed or confronted these intuitive beliefs resist change and are continued to be held in parallel to the formal theories taught in the classroom. Moreover, since such 'spontaneous' knowledge is normally derived from the common experiential base of the child, large areas of 'informal' science are found to be strikingly universal; alternative frameworks in mechanics39 or heat,40 for example, reveal a fascinating similarity that transcends territorial, tutorial and even temporal distinctions. Osborne et a141 point out that children tend to view the world from and anthropomorphic or human-centred position and construct particular explanations for specific events without being concerned about their mutual consistency. Indeed, common inetaphors of everyday language, as well as those used unsuspectingly in the discourse of teaching, reinforce intuitive beliefs and are co-opted by the learner's imagery to endow physical entities like heat, electric current or force with distinct human characteristics. Thus 'the heat pushes the cold out', 'the electric current turns back when faced by an insulator or gets used up by a resistance' or 'the force in the ball fights against gravity to keep it moving upwards until it gets exhausted and gives up' are some of the interesting untutored ideas voiced by children today which are surprisingly similar to the intuiitive scientific theories articulated a few cenituries ago. Transition from the learner's iinformal to the established formal framework would require a conscious restructuring of knowledge, a</page><page sequence="11">60 SOCIAL SCIENTIST conceptual 'accommodation' which might, at times, be similar to the paradigmatic shifts that scientific knowledge has itself gone through. Indeed, according to one opinion, pupil's life-world knowledge, into which they are socialised during the major part of their lives, and which, therefore, has greater social value and persistence, cannot be extinguished by the considerably weaker and temporary socialisation within school. For, school learning seeks to explain experiences in terms of marginal interpretative systems forming the so called 'symbolic universes'42 of knowledge which tend to be alien to the learner's natural attitude and are therefore more fragile. Joan Solomon43 argues that it would thus be more fruitful to foster a fluidity of thought between the two domains of knowledge and the capability of distinguishing between them. Indeed she has shown that pupils who are capable of successfully crossing over and back from the life-world to the symbolic domain of thought indicate a deeper level of understanding of a concept as abstract as 'energy'. Moreover, even a few months of lapse of time after formal instruction causes a preferential shift to the life-world domain, provided there is no further reinforcement of symbolic knowledge. Thus, unless science education takes cognisance of learners' (which includes teachers) private conceptual frameworks and ensures that the new 'public' knowledge is embedded within the active construction of personal meanings, 'schooling' in science would continue to contribute to a conformist and unquestioning majority, overawed by the authority and formidable formality of the discipline. CULTURE AND COGNITION: SCIENCE WITHIN AN ORAL UNIVERSE The Vishika, with its legacy of a progressive yet somewhat 'scientific'44 model of pedagogy, has, over the last sixteen years, slowly attempted to adapt itself to its students and teachers. Active feedback from the field of operation (covering a predominantly large rural area) has led to a number of alterations in the design of the experiments, the nature of the content, the language of the textual material and the training of teachers. However, the adaptations have often seemed to be attempts to account for some kind of 'limitations', not just structural but also cognitive. On the one hand this could be because the core resource group, with its urban and professional science background, had no prior experience of working within the rural school system and was, therefore, constantly striving to redefine its expectations to plug the ostensible cognitive gaps between the design of teaching and the apparatus of learning. However, what seems more significant here is the fact that the culture through which science is taught is itself at variance with the culture in which it is being received. Science is a product of a tradition of writing, and its teaching has naturally demanded a literate cultural base. Therefore, even the</page><page sequence="12">SCHOOL SCIENCE IN SEARCH OF A DEMOCRATIC ORDER 61 best attempts to accost a culture like ours, based predominantly on traditions of residual orality with resources born essentially out of literacy would result in profound gaps in communication. Moreover, from the literate frame of reference cognitive processes of the oral mind have always appeared to be inexplicably 'limited'. Indeed, psychology and anthropology have a fairly long history of cross- cultural research into the workings of the 'non-literate' mind (long been classified as the 'savage' mind!) which has usually potently ethnocentric and often unsuspectingly polarised by the 'cultural spectacles' of the observers. As Walter Ong in his masterly work illuminating the contrasts between orality and literacy points out, 'we are so literate that it is very difficult for us to conceive of an oral universe of communication and thought except as a variant of a literate universe45, and that too a woefully deficit one. The non-literate or neo- literate mind was normally characterised as one typically lacking in abstract and analytical thought and poorly equipped for inferential deduction. Moreover, such conclusions are in consonance with the conventionality of a strict hierarchy of knowledge conceived in terms of dichotomies such as abstract-concrete, symbolic-sensual, objective- subjective, complex-simple, rational-emotional etc. The non-literate mind is, by such definition, poorly developed, quite incapable of learning science and, therefore, at best suited for a course in vocational training. This is strikingly reminiscent of the tacit assumptions behind the nineteenth century educational debate regarding the introduction of science in elementary school, whereby two distinct types of mentality (the 'gnostic' and the 'banausic'46) related to the 'intellectual' and the 'banal', were attributed to people belonging to the upper and lower classes. Millar47 has shown how these ideas are still held by the 'contemporary polemicist', who though more guarded in his tone, is nevertheless as eager to invoke similar models of cognitive deficiency. Science only for the 'superior' literate mind is a verdict we in the Third World clearly refuse to accept. We, of course, could dismiss it as arising out of ethnocentric prejudice, or, in Ong's words, 'blind spots of the unreflective chirographic or typographic mind".48 But what then is our stand? On what premise do we base our efforts to evolve a science education programme embedded within our cultural resources? In what way can the 'psychodynamics of orality' be constructively incorporated into the process of learning science? Or rather, how can the teaching of science meaningfully define itself within a predominantly oral universe of thought and expression? In trying to comprehend the cognitive depths of an oral universe what is called for is an 'hermeneutic' approach or, in the words of Geertz, an interpretative 'attempt to somehow understand how it is we understand understandings not our own'.49 A number of such anthropological studies have shown that the so-called shifts from</page><page sequence="13">62 SOCIAL SCIENT'IST magic to science or from the 'prelogical' to the more rational mind can be more economically and cogently understood as shifts from an oral state of consciousness to various stages of interiorised literacy.50 This is not to imply that the oral mind lacked a sense of logical reasoning but that certain tools of intellectual operation associated with the Greek notion of formal logic, like contradiction, scepticism or inference, which call for critical attention to a text, were made possible only by a tradition of writing. Thus, in the words of Kathleen Gough, 'literacy is for the most part an enabling rather than a causal factor, making possible the development of complex political structures, syllogistic reasoning, scientific enquiry, linear conceptions of reality . . . and perhaps certain kinds of individualism and of alienation. Whether, and to what extent, these will in fact develop depends apparently on concomitant factors of ecology, inter-societal relations, and internal ideological and social structural response to these.'51 Knowledge that is once conceptualised by primary oral cultures can soon be lost unless adequate investments of energy are made, by saying it over and over again, to preserve it for posterity. Only when it is released of its mnemonic tasks by relegating them to the written text, can the rniind turn itself to new speculation. Indeed, the residual orality of a given chirographic culture can be gauged from the amount of memorisation its pedagogical practices demand. The rhythmic recitation that goes by the name of teaching in most of our schools bears eloquent testimony to our indomitable oral spirit! Orality ensures an empathetic and communal identification with what is known, whereas writing distances the knower and thus 'sets up conditions for objectivity, in the sense of personal disengagement'.52 All thought is basically analytic but processes requiring abstractly sequential, classificatory and linear structuring of knowledge distanced from lived 'situational' experiences are impossible without writing and reading. Learning within oral cultures is based on close human interaction, on apprenticeship depending on a minimum of verbalised explanation and by participation in a kind of corporate retrospection'-not by study in the normal literate sense. Indeed, the notion of private reading does not belong to the oral universe of most of our children-reading for them is very mtuch an oral and even social activity. Morcover, silent study demands privacy and isolation-a luxury only very few of us can afford. Deep insights into the operations of ain oral mind are found in Luria's53,54 work with the non-literate and semi-literate peoples of Uzbekistan and Khirgizia. His researclh though not explicitly encoded in terms of orality-literacy contrasts, does indeed emphasise that abstract and conceptual thinkiing is a reflection of a society's cultural and intellectual history, conveyed through its linguistic system. Studies on categorisation, or the way people group things and made gencralisations, revealed that nioni-literate subjects invariably resorted</page><page sequence="14">SCH-IOOL SCIENCE IN SEARCH OF A DEMOCRATIC ORDER 63 to 'situational' thinking and classified objects according to their real- life relationshiDs. This 'functional-graphic perception' based on practical experience was so overriding that even the suggestion of other abstract principles to guide classification was persistently dismissed as 'stupid' or irrelevant. A typical example is that in which illiterate subjects, on being shown drawings of a hammer, a saw, a log and a hatchet, insisted that they all belonged to one group and that none could be excluded. 'They are all alike. The saw will saw the log and the hatchet will chop it into small pieces. If one of these has to go, I'd throw out the hatchet. It doesn't do as good a job as a saw'.55 On being told that another subject had placed the three things-the hammer, saw and hatchet-together keeping the log out, one peasant promptly replied, 'Probably he's got a lot of firewood, but if we'll be left without wood -we won't be able to do anything'.56 They further insisted that wood too could be called a 'tool' since handles of tools were made from wood, and so were poles and other things. They asserted indignantly-'we call all the things we have need of tools'; 'we have a saying: take a look in the fields and you'll see tools'- thereby defining the essential practicality of the modes of generalisation they used. New science curricula, including Vishika, have laid special stress on classification, regarded as one of the fundamentals of conceptual learning. In the last three decades, however, extensive studies have been conducted by cognitivists to understand human classificatory practices and nmuch new insight has been gained predonminantly by the work of Eleanor Rosch. She points out that presumptions that the human mind uses laws of formal logic to define a category by abstracting clear-cut independent and unambiguous criteria for its membership, are inot supported by research. She is critical of the classical notions of categorisation attributed to the 'mature western mind' and remnarks that 'if other thought processes, such as imagery, ostensive definition, reasoniing by analogy to particular instances or the use of imetaphors were considered at all, they were normally relegated to 'lesser beings' such as women, children or primitive people'.57 The 'natural' view of classification points out that the natural wvorld of categories (as opposed to the mathematical world of abstract classes), however, consists of highly correlated (non-independent) features which provide considerablc redundancy in the appearance of members of a given category. Indeed, it is this redundancy which is exploited by our recognition mechanisms. For example, as cited by Gardner,58 a perceiver who can distinguish wings, furs and feathers soon realises that in the empirical world wings occur with feathers more than they do with furs. Moreover, Rosch has found that we normally construct categories around a central member or 'prototype'- a representative example of that class which shares the most features with other members while sharing few, if any, with elements fromn</page><page sequence="15">64 SOCIAL SCIENTIST outside the class. Since a sparrow is more a prototypical bird than a penguin or a chicken, it is bound to be more readily recognised and is less likely to be misclassified. Thus according to the natural view, categorisation involves erecting typical prototypes for further matching rather than abstracting a list of common criteria. That is, we normally look to see how well objects resemble a typical member of a class as we conceptualise it rather than objectively search for common attributes. Moreover, work done in Third World countries shows that it is not as if rural children cannot use superordinate concepts for classification, regarded as conceptually preferable in school systems, but that they choose not to do so because such concepts do not satisfy their modes of organising experience.59 A sensitive example is that of a 12-year old peasant child from Mexico, who when asked to categorise various objects on the basis of their similarities, almost poetically refused to place them together by stating that the 'banana is like a horn, the orange a ball and the bean a little heart; they are not alike'.60 This imagery, embedded as it is in the child's living experience of perception, is strikingly similar to the kind exhibited by children in oral riddle-games. The capacity to logically connect two different statements and draw a conclusion from them, as in syllogistic reasoning, was for a long time considered basic to human consciousness. For example, if we are given the two propositions: 'Precious metals do not rust' and 'gold is a precious metal' we can almost unthinkingly conclude that gold does not rust. Piaget had raised questions about the 'naturalness' of such logical operations in his studies related to the intellectual development of children. However, Luria, in his work with non-literates had attempted to determine whether or not such logical schemes are invariant at different stages of social history and social development. He found that subjects who could draw excellent judgements about facts of direct concern often failed to perceive logical relations between the premises of a syllogism, which was a form of abstract reasoning alien to them. As an illustration, let's consider the following syllogism: 'In the Far North, where there is snow, all bears are white. Novaya Zembla is in the Far North and there is always snow there. What colour are the bears?' To this one person revealingly replied: 'I don't know. I've seen a black bear; I've never seen any others. . .. Each locality has its own animals', and on being pressed further, he retorted, almost exasperatedly, 'That's my last word. Those who saw can tell, those who didn't see can't say anything!' However, the response of a semi-literate volunteer, ostensibly keen to absolve himself from the personal responsibility of assigning a colour to the unseen bears, was, typical: 'To go by your words they should all be white'.61 Thus the responses, reflecting a mistrust of the initial premises which were removed from their immediate experience, categorically refused to commit to any 'objective' conclusion. Moreover, a bare brush with</page><page sequence="16">SCHOOL SCIENCE IN SEARCH OF A DEMOCRATIC ORDER 65 literacy (especially of the kind associated with schooling) could apparently make theoretical modes of generalisation more accessible, if not entirely acceptable. The rules of the game became more apparent, even if the game was not wholly satisfying. Indeed, as Ong points out, a syllogism is like a text-fixed, self- contained and isolated-its conclusions are derived from its premises only, without recourse to personal interpretation. The riddle, on the other hand, symbolises a mode of reasoning which belongs to the oral mind, demanding resources of knowledge far beyond the words themselves. Many of us have seen how even young children love to indulge in complex riddle games-relishing the act of stretching their imagination, searching their memory and maximally taxing their inferential abilities. It is, therefore, significant to note that the noetic capacities of an oral mind are, perhaps, impossible to gauge by written tests, or even oral ones framed in a literate format. Indeed, in the west, written examinations came into wide use well after print had been assimilated by the culture, already conditioned by thousands of years of writing. It is thus pertinent to examine how appropriate written questions (especially those requiring use of decontextualised logical reasoning) are in the context of our schools, where a majority of the children are first or second generation literates. Further, what is significant is not just the lack of familiarity with print but also the inability to afford it, for, in a large number of homes the school textbook is the only 'chink in the wall' that exposes them to the literate universe. It needs to be stressed that the kind of literacy associated with formal schooling is distinct from that required for other reading/writing tasks as, for instance, in the pursuance of religious instruction. Consequently, the specific skills enhanced by each kind of literacy may also differ, as was shown by the Scribner and Cole62 study in Liberia or by the work of Brian Street63 in Iran. However, changes in generalized cognitive abilities (as distinct from 'skills') are not unmediated or immediate implications of 'instant' literacy and cannot necessarily be measured by standard psychological tests. Moreover, as emphasised by Goody, 'In differentiated societies . . . cognitive skills are rarely to be found at the level of generalized cognitive abilities or generalized cultural attainments that reside in the totality of the population; both abilities and culture have to be understood in another way for these are differentially distributed among the population.64 The Vishika has almost instinctively and empirically become aware of some characteristics of the oral universe of its children. The title page of 'Bal Vigyanik' is in the form of a personal letter, composed calligraphically, addressing the pupils and inviting them to share the fascination of science. This, according to Ong, was found in medieval western manuscripts which introduced their text not by an impersonal title-page but by a conversational observation addressed to</page><page sequence="17">66 SOCIAL SCIENTIST the reader, in an attempt to preserve the likeness of the manuscript to that of an utterance. Recent alterations in the workbook have tried to incorporate greater redundancy in language in keeping with children's natural forms of expression. Indeed, redundancy is a natural characteristic of oral discourse, unlike sparse linearity which economically structures expressioni for the purpose of writing. For, effective repetition of what has just been said maintains a kind of backlooping thereby ensuring proximity to the focus of attention, as is judiciously exploited by many an experienced orator. Much cognitive research has now been done in areas of visual perception to show that pictorial or diagrammatic representation is also a culture-specific mode of expression. However, most textbooks, especially those in science, continue to exhibit gross insensitivity towards children's natural forms of visual expression, both from the psychological as well as cultural aspects of cognition. Vishika has attempted to experiment with less formal diagrammatic representations though much more systematic work has yet to be undertaken, in collaboration with artists sharing a deep commitment and sensitivity to both tribal and children's art. Indeed much effort needs to be expended to effect a successful shift in the entire discourse of science teaching-from the transactional to the expressive, the dry and terse to the more vivid and elaborate and from the transmission modes of representation to the more interpretation (discussed in greater detail in an earlier paper65). The fundamental task remains essentially unattempted: to radically redefine the teaching of science within the cultural universe of our children and thus to meaningfully address and engage the cognitive structures they bring with them to the learning situation. It is clear that an effort in this direction would require versatile resources and intellectual inputs with many an hermeneutic insight from the fields of sociology, linguistics, psychology and cultural anthropology. DYNAMICS OF CURRICULAR CHANGE The Vishika from its very inception was committed to operate within the existing government school system, rather than set up its own 'islands of excellence'. Over the years it has continuously expanded its sphere of influence and encompassed more aind more schools in different districts. The process is necesarily a slow one since curricular change requires a restructuring of attitudes and beliefs through close human interaction. The new spirit must somehow osmose through the almost ossified structures of the educational bureaucracy. Moreover, in a feudal state like Madhya Pradesh, the protagonist of pedagogical change, the school teacher occupies the lowest and the most disinally unenviable position in both the educational and the social hierarchy. Hence, change within the classroom must necessarily be accompanied</page><page sequence="18">SCHOOL SCIENCE IN SEARCH OF A DEMOCRATIC ORDER 67 by change without. Indeed, for teachers to delegate some measure of autonomy to their students they must be enabled to wrest some of it for themselves too. The Vishika classrooms, especially those where some measure of activity did take place, became conspicuously noisier, in somewhat cathartic defiance of the still prevailing conservative norms of 'pin- drop' discipline. The departure from the regimented straight-file architecture of inactivity to a more practical and informal groupwise configuration of participation scaffolded the spirit of freedom sought by the programme. Excursions taking pupils outside the dismal confines of school, in order to explore and learn from the natural (and social) environment, were institutionalised by incorporating them into specific chapters of the book, despite initial objections raised by conservative parents of girl students. The classroom has thus changed perceptibly, yet the ethos of enquiry has not been entirely assimilated. At one level, this could be a cultural phenomenon with its origins in a society's conservative values demanding unquestioning deference towards those older in age. As a result queries are by definition unidirectional; a pupil's question to the teacher, especially if it is a probing one, would not only violate pedagogical but also social conventions. A recent study66 regarding the influence of culture on Nigerian pupils' questioning habits in science lessons, points to similar social inhibitions determining the nature of classroom interaction. Kenneth King67 points out that the tradition of a subservient disciple, prevalent in several countries of East and South East Asia, is directly counter to a truly pupil-centred curriculum. Thus science education in such cultures tends to become 'doubly authoritarian', conforming to Kuhn's description of it as 'a relatively dogmatic initiation into a pre-established problem solving tradition that the student is neither invited nor equipped to evaluate'.68 The Bal Vigyanik has, in a conscious attempt at subversion, sought to introduce various activities requiring students to experiment with guruji's watch or cycle and if they could muster enough courage, to even count the bones of his ribcage! The children, given half a chance, would only be too happy to comply. Indeed, the constraints depend only to some extent on the social inhibitions of a particular community but, at the more general level, derive from the culture of teaching itself. A number of hermeneutic studies in more 'progressive' schools of the west, attempting to understand teachers' intentionalities within the framework of their belief systems, have shown that teachers find it difficult to fit 'enquiry' into their own definition of teaching. Enquiry teaching lays great emphasis on classroom discussion, an activity teachers feel most uncomfortable with, for, allowing pupils to talk freely in class seems to be an abdication of control undermining their own influence. As Olson puts it, 'teachers do Inot understand that "not dominating the class" can count as a form of influence'.69 Moreover,</page><page sequence="19">68 SOCIAL SCIENTIST they tend to consider it an ineffective method for accomplishing instructional goals-a wasteful 'waffle'70 that fails to economically deliver the established facts of science. The Vishika teacher orientation courses (as well as the monthly meetings) are consciously conducted in the 'discussion' mode of enquiry. Initially teachers, themselves deeply conditioned by the expository mode, tend to feel disoriented and frustrated and complain about the 'vagueness' or 'lack of direction' of the approach, always insisting that the 'correct' canonical answers be given to them. However, they soon acclimatise to the more open and democratic environment and begin to respond hearteningly. Yet, they seem reluctant or are, perhaps, incapable of carrying the same spirit to their own classrooms. Delineating the dilemmas of enquiry, Olson further argues that innovative practices often expect teachers to develop in students quite complex cognitive skills which are difficult to delimit. Thus teachers continue to adhere to the text, dictate answers and gear their teaching totally towards examinations because that system provides a firm anchor and effectively delimits their work, offering time-tested criteria of 'accountability'. In fact teachers' performance is often assessed by the examination results and, till recently, promotions were withheld on the basis of a poor pass percentage. Indeed, changing a curriculum is, as Mary Waring points out, like trying to move a graveyard, for both are filled with sacred bones.71 Dissonance often occurs between the initial objectives of an innovative curriculum and subsequent classroom practice because, over time, individual teachers accommodate themselves to their own situations of 'equilibrium'. The compromises they make to minimise tension and the strategies they adopt for such accommodation normally fall within the more familiar traditional approaches informed by a relatively stable body of ideas of what and how to teach. However, those who do depart from the secure expository mode are often dominated by the 'activity'72 frame of mind, restricting themselves only to the functional and manipulative details of doing experiments, rather than going into the logic of those activities. Their own limited understanding of the subject often bars them from adopting a 'learning' frame by which to interpret the experiments. Indeed, 'learning by doing' has often been over-stressed by the innovative curricula, almost to the point of dire distraction. Most such curricula expressed allegiance to the famous Chinese adage: 'I heard I forgot; I saw I remembered; I did I understood', which also boldly prefaces Bal Vigyanik. The mere act of mechanically manipulating often tedious and time-consuming experiments does not necessarily facilitate comprehension but might, instead, as Rosalind Driver suspects, result in the anguish of: 'I do and I am even more confused!'73 A significant section of the Vishika teachers, however indoctrinated by the tenets of 'discovery learning' they may be, are</page><page sequence="20">SCI-OOL SCIENCE IN SEARCH OF A DEMOCRATIC ORDER 69 often severely constrained and understandably demotivated by the lack of basic equipment. This constraint overrides the others with which they have somehow learnt to cope: leaking roofs (if ever they exist), a crowd of sometimes upto a hundred children crammed into dark and dilapidated classrooms, acute shortage of water. . . . The supply of the low-cost science 'kit', a responsibility of the State Education Department, is a long-suffering victim of bureaucratic inertia and inefficiency, giving rise to the perennial complaint proverbially termed as 'kit ki kit kit'. However, the kit though crucial, is not the lone cause of discontent. Administrative lapses and procrastinations constitute the normal order. Indeed, a large measure of the youthfulness and enthusiasm of the now not-as-young voluntary activists, in their almost indefatigable attempts to somehow keep things moving, has been irreversibly sapped by the virtually immovable files of the local educational set-up. In terms of the perceived practicality of a preferred curriculum the new approach probably doesn't fare too well on other grounds as well. The emphasis on collaborative problem solving or constructing 'shared meanings' is, perhaps, construed by teachers as highly paradoxical, for in the conventional culture of 'no cheating!' or 'keep your eyes strictly on your own note-book!' to encourage mutual consultation could amount to dereliction of the traditional ethical norms they have preserved to maintain (except, of course, when discretion decides otherwise). Indeed the reification of 'knowledge' within our contemporary education system, and its consequent redefinition as an individually acquired 'possession' to be fanatically guarded yet blatantly displayed, has led to the almost abject practice of 'competition' and one-upmanship amongst students. Pupils are almost provoked by their peers, parents and even pedagogues to stealthily pinch others' notes while prudently preparing their own. Thus, when knowledge is a commodity almost surreptitiously transacted under cover, to propound collaborative learning must sound confoundingly crazy! ENQUIRY OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL The spirit of enquiry has demonstrated some measure of contagion outside the Vishika classroom. Teachers have gained confidence and have shown signs of protest against bureaucratic repression. Indeed the manner in which some middle school teachers recently withstood tremendous political pressure emanating directly from the Vidhan Sabha is a case in point. In 1988 annual (class VIII) examination, a question pertaining to the theory of probability required students to compute the chances of winning a game of 'Satta', thus exemplifying that gambling is largely a losing proposition. A political opportunist objected on the grounds that Vishika, by virtue of its activity-based learning approach, was corrupting children by teaching them how to</page><page sequence="21">7U SOCIAL SCIENTIST gamble and must therefore be packed up. An absurd accusation, but once articulated behind the high portals of power could portend serious trouble, especially for the poor school teachers who had framed the question. However, in an unusual act of conviction, they stuck to their stand, officially stating that this was a more effective way of combating the widespread problem of gambling rather than moral sermonising they are normally expected to do in the classroom. Whenever innovation challenges existing hierarchies within schools, let alone without, political problems inevitably arise. There is always this fear that if curricula tend to look at social realities too critically, teachers emerging from such a course wouild become, in the words of a school inspector, 'active emissaries of misrule'.74 Elaboratiing on the notion of 'curriculum as practice', Young comments that educational theory must lead to the transformation of ideas into action and ought necessarily be rooted in the world of practice outside the coffins of school. He eloquently asserts that 'if the educational experiences of both teachers and pupils is to become and realistic possibility of human liberation, then this is going to involve many others who have no direct involvemenit with the school, and much action by teachers and pupils that would not be seen as either confined to school or, in conventional terms, necessarily educational at all'.74 A significant section of the Vishika cadre of teachers has moved out of the classroom; in collaboration with voluntary activists or 'informal agents of change',75 it has now engaged itself in activities related to broader societal issues, like environmental pollution or health and medicine, besides organising popular science exhibitions, quizes and Bal Melas. Indeed these activities have gained further momentum by having been incorporated into the agenda of the people's Science Network, recently formed by voluntary groups from different states of the country. Interaction with peers from aifferent geographical regions would thus provide a wider exposure and lead to a heightened sense of self-awareness, essential for any meaninigful restructuring of belief systems. Thus the new movemenit of 'science activitism', using science almost as Freire treated 'literacy', has begun to mobilise the extensive network of teachers and children, who, if mearningfully motivated, can act as potential agents of social change. This envisioned marriage of innovation with activism can possibly liberate school science and direct it in search of a truly democratic order. The Vishika resource group is mneanwhile engrossed in a long- standiing debate about the future of the prograinmme. To expand or not to expand?-looms large ahead. Geographically (into more districts)? Vertically (into higher levels of school)? Officially (as part of the government's new statewide scheme)? Volunitarily (through a network of voluntary groups)?-the 'dialectics' of expansion continues to engage. Moreover, despite various past attempts, the inevitable question of 'programme evaluation' inivariably emerges. How must</page><page sequence="22">SCI-IOOL SCIENCE IN SEARCH OF A DEMOCRATIC ORDER 71 Vishika be effectively evaluated? By ourselves? By professional educational consultants? By the government bureaucrats? By politicians? By the teachers themselves? By the children, or the community at large? Can such evaluation ever be truly 'objective'? Indeed, curriculum evaluation is necessarily a political enterprise and it is too naive to consider it a neutral activity. Prefacing his book on educational evaluation House76 emphasises that 'contrary to common belief, evaluation is not the ultimate arbiter, delivered from our objectivity and accepted as final judgement. Evaluation is always derived from biased origins. When someone wants to defend something or to attack something, he often evaluates it. Evaluation is a motivated behaviour. Likewise, the way in which the results of an evaluation are accepted depends on whether they help or hinder the person receiving them. Evaluation is an integral part of the political processes of our society'. Elaborating further he states that 'at its simplest, evaluation is the process of applying a set of standards to a programme, making judgements using the standards, and justifying the standards and their application. But there are many standards, especially in a pluralist society: which to apply?'77 Indeed, evaluation is much more than mere measurement. Moreover, short-term effects of a curriculum are comparatively easier to assess-o find out if students are learning science, whether experiments are at all being conducted, whether recitation persists, how far teachers understand the inew content or emphasise with the curricular aims etc. Sensitive 'tests' for such assessment can always be designed. However, what is clearly more difficult, or shall we say almost impossible, to similarly 'test' is the long-term influence of an innovative curriculum. For, instead of the expedient number-crunching techniques of classical psychometric testing, what are required are more 'responsive' alternative models of 'illuminative' 78 evaluation. And the search for such models is what Vishika needs to address itself to. NOTES AND REFERENCES 1.
