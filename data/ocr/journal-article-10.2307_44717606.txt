Dept. of Transportation Fred Arndt Dynamic Science Div., Ultrasystems, Inc. THE NATIONAL TRAFFIC and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 authorizes the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to procure experimental vehicles for research and testing pur- poses. The development phase of the Experimental Safety Vehicle (ESV) program was initiated in 1970 with the follow- ing overall objectives: 1. To demonstrate the technical feasibility of significant advancements in automotive safety performance. 2. To stimulate public awareness of safety and the economic advantages of advanced automotive safety design. 3. To encourage the automotive industry to increase its effort in safety research and to accelerate the inclusion of advanced safety systems in production vehicles. 4. To use the results of testing and evaluating ESVs as an aid in developing new motor vehicle safety standards. Subsequent to the initiation of the domestic program, an international ESV program was established by memoranda of agreement between the United States government and the governments of France, Germany, The United Kingdom, Italy, Japan, and Sweden. The efforts of the many automotive com- panies involved are noteworthy in terms of both resources expended and accomplishments. The first ESVs, developed under competitive contracts by AMF Inc. and Fairchild Industries (FI), were delivered to the United States government in December 1971. The second ESVs were received from each contractor in January 1972. General Motors and Ford developed ESVs on a noncompetitive basis for $1 each. General Motors delivered four ESVs, two untested and two previously tested, that were suitably re- furbished for further testing, in July 1972. The Ford ESV was delivered in December 1972. This paper describes the ESV test program, as related to methodology, operating procedures, and results through the General Motors phase of testing. The development contracts clearly stated that the ESVs would be tested by an independent contractor. In addition, the development contractors were obligated to submit pro- posals to the National Highway Traffic and Safety Adminis- tration (NHTSA) as to how they would support the testing of their vehicles in terms of manpower and spare parts. The Dynamic Science Div. of Ultrasystems, Inc., was selected as the test contractor in June 1971. Test support contracts were awarded to each of the development contractors prior to the delivery of their vehicles. TEST PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND TASKS In order for the government to best evaluate the vehicle designs, Dynamic Science was required to: 1. Develop test methodology and verify procedures by means of baseline testing of production vehicles. ABSTRACT Under the Experimental Safety Vehicle (ESV) Program authorized by the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, AMF Inc. and Fairchild Industries developed the first ESVs under competitive contracts, while General Motors Corp. and Ford later developed ESVs under noncompetitive con- tracts. These contracts stated that ESV testing would be per- formed by an independent contractor. This paper describes the ESV test program through the GM phase of testing as re- lated to methodology, operating procedures, and results, and the role of Dynamic Science Division of Ultrasystems Inc. as test contractor. 2056</page><page sequence="2">2. Conduct quantitative nondestructive and destructive tests with the ESVs. 3. Provide timely test data deliveries to the NHTSA. The test program was divided into the following tasks to allow maximum concurrent testing: 1 . Evaluation of design requirements (a) Initial ESV inspection (weight, dimensions, capacity)- all ESVs (b) Consumer information- AMF and FI (c) Nonoperating safety -AMF and FI 2. Accident avoidance tests (a) Brake performance- All ESVs (b) Steering performance- All ESVs (c) Handling- All ESVs (d) Overturning immunity- All ESVs (e) Visibility-All ESVs (f) Displays and controls- All ESVs (g) Engine test series- All ESVs (h) Ride performance- AMF and FI 3.

Post-crash factors evaluation- All ESVs (a) Fuel and electrical system damage (b) Potential fire hazards (c) Glazing compliance with FMVSS 205 (d) Emergency egress and passenger rescue The role of the test contractor was to determine how the ESVs performed, and the analyses of the performance were the responsibility of the government. FACILITIES, INSTRUMENTATION, AND OPERATING PROCEDURES Major facility design and construction activities at Dynamic Science were completed by the end of 1971, concurrent with the delivery of the first ESVs. The facility (Fig. 1) consists of a vehicle dynamics area and a crash test area. The 2-mile oval encompasses high and low skid number braking lanes, and the skid pad area is in excess of 10 acres. All of the ESV tests were conducted without constraints on speed or vehicle trajectories. Instrumentation and data acquisition for the accident avoidance tests are schematized in Fig. 2. Visual monitoring of all key test parameters was provided to enhance control and Fig. 1 - Dynamic Science test facility 2057</page><page sequence="3">2058 N. S. STAHLER AND F. ARNDT test-to-test repeatability. In addition, all of the data were recorded onboard the vehicle via a tape recorder. The notable exception involved brake lining temperatures, which were monitored visually, since they were used as a gross test control parameter. An average of 14 channels of data were recorded during a typical accident avoidance test. Since the completion of the GM tests, modifications have been made to use a radio telemetry link between the vehicle and a central data acquisition station, which simplifies the total data acquisition package within the vehicle. The data are recorded on tape at the data acquisition station, and virtually all key test parameters are played back real-time via a line type recorder. This represents a marked improvement for real-time monitoring and control of open-loop type testing, which is required for evaluating accident avoidance. Instrumentation and data acquisition for the crash tests are schematized in Fig. 3. All signal conditioning was performed onboard the vehicles. Emphasis was placed on redundancy of critical measurements, particularly as applied to dummy head and vehicle structural data. To accomplish this, completely redundant data transmission links were used in conjunction with redundant instrumentation; that is, the hard-line umbili- cal was backed up by a telemetry system. Extra precautions were taken for the competitive AMF/FI crash testing by using two hard-line umbilicais and telemetry. The signal condition- ing equipment was modulized as much as possible to prevent the possibility of single-point failures that could cause the loss POWER ^ RECORDER ĪĒŠĪ S,GNAl INSTRUMENTATION^ ĪĒŠĪ C'oHTROL&gt;N C0NTR0L DISPUYS/TESÎ C0NTR0L CONTROL Fig. 2 - Accident avoidance data acquisition system of a major portion of the critical test information. Output from the signal conditioning equipment was in FM multiplex form, thereby allowing compact packaging of large quantities of data into relatively small umbilicais, and recording on a minimum number of tape recorders. Each data transmission link had an independent tape recorder, thereby providing maximum possible end-to-end redundancy with the data acquisition, transmission, and recording link. Ninety-five channels of data were recorded when dummies and restraint systems were onboard the vehicle. The distribu- tion of these channels is shown in Table 1. The NHTSA required quick turnaround of crash data. Quick-look data, generally in the form of oscillograms, were to be available within 8 h of the test; final data, normally digital computer printouts and computer plots, were to be available within 72 h.

Normally, 17-22 cameras/ test were used, with a split as indicated in Table 2. Six to eight cameras were used to record dummy dynamics, with the remaining high- speed cameras used for documentation. Prior to any major crash test, the NHTSA required the test contractor to conduct a readiness review to present vehicle and facility status, as well as to discuss modifications and equipment installations performed during the course of preparing the specific test vehicle. The attendees were appropriate personnel from Dynamic Science, the ESV design contractor, and the NHTSA. These meetings provided a forum for discussion of any problems which may have resulted from preparation of the vehicle. This type of review also provides a final overview of the test for key people who are not involved in day-to-day test operations. SUMMARY OF AMF AND FI ESV TESTS The AMF and FI evaluation was completed in mid- 1972. The results have been documented in a four-volume NHTSA report, which also contains detailed descriptions of the test procedures, instrumentation requirements, facilities, and data acquisition and reduction systems.* Following are some highlights of the AMF/FI phase of the test program that are presented in the referenced four- volume report. As shown on the tabulation of significant parameters (Table 3), both ESVs were substantially heavier than speci- fied. The vehicles generally met the dimensional requirements with minor deviations. They both had a five-passenger capacity, but the center positions of the rear seats would not accommodate more than a 50th percentile male. With respect to the accident avoidance portion, over 3500 individual tests were conducted on baseline vehicles and the AMF/FI ESVs. The scope of this effort is shown in Table 4, and a summary of tests conducted is shown in Table 5. *The vehicle dynamics portions of ESV testing have pre- viously been published in SAE paper 730080 by Francis A. DiLorenzo.

S. STAHLER AND F. ARNDT The crash injury reduction evaluation was comprised of four test series: 1. Bumper underride/override. 2. Pedestrian safety. 3. Collision. 4. Interior controls and protrusions. This paper is limited to discussion of the collision tests, which are related to the major area of emphasis during the development phase. Table 6 summarizes the collision test series in terms of the specific tests conducted and the vehicles involved. Baseline tests were used to verify the procedures, including speed control and instrumentation suitability. The baseline vehicles were ballasted to approximate the weights of the fully instrumented ESVs. All of the crash-tested vehicles were towed by means of a continuous cable propulsion system, with the tow cable attachment being released just prior to impact. In the case of the side-to-pole tests, the vehicles were mounted on dolly wheels, as shown in Fig. 4, and pulled sideways. The ESVs contained three fully instrumented, 50th per- centile male anthropomorphic dummies for the high-speed barrier and pole tests. These were Alderson VIP-50A dum- mies with GM rubber necks in an inverted position. Two were placed in the front, and one in the right rear of the vehicles.

The test conditions and a summary of vehicle structural performance are presented in Table 7, showing that there was no passenger compartment intrusion. Vehicle crush characteristics are presented in Figs. 7 and 8. Both ESVs exhibited essentially the same average response. Occupant compartment accelerations are shown in Figs. 9 and 10, with the performance specifications noted. The data for both vehicles are similar. They exceeded the requirements of maximum 40 G acceleration, maintaining the average acceleration within ±25% throughout the crash. However, the average accelerations of both vehicles were well below the required 40 G. The inflatable occupant restraint system performed as designed in the AMF ESV, but the FI system failed to actuate. Diagnosis attributed the failure to a wiring error at the impact sensing pressure switch. As anticipated, all occupant injury criteria were exceeded in the FI ESV.

As can be seen, the FI side door structure was some- what stiffer than AMF's, resulting in less crush and higher accelerations. Dummy responses in both ESVs are shown in Figs. 18-20. All performance criteria were met, except for the peak head acceleration of the AMF right front dummy. This consider- ably higher value can be attributed to the dummy's head impacting the side door glass, as evidenced by the window frame bending outward. SUMMARY OF GM TESTS Table 9 shows the numerical designations of the four GM ESVs that were delivered to the government for testing. Numbers 08 and 09 were untested vehicles, while 06 and 07 were previously crash tested by GM during their development program. The 06 and 07 vehicles were suitably refurbished by GM to allow them to be used in a front-to-side crash at the Dynamic Science facility. A second front-to-side crash with dummies was conducted for the NHTSA by GM using 07 and refurbished 08. Table 10 summarizes the tests that were conducted on the GM ESVs. The greater number of available vehicles and the absence of competition allowed flexibility in selecting a variety of test configurations, particularly with respect to vehicle-to-vehicle crashes. Testing of the GM ESV was com- pleted on schedule in December 1972. Table 1 1 tabulates significant weight and measurement parameters on the GM ESV. Although the GM ESVs were substantially lighter than the AMF and FI vehicles, weight con- tinues to be a problem. The vehicle generally met the dimen- sional requirements with very minor deviations. It has a passenger capacity of five, but the center position of the rear seat would not accommodate more than a 50th percentile male.

With the exception of the 100% weight condition (curb weight + 1000 lb load) for the braking efficiency tests, all of the tests were conducted on a dry asphaltic concrete surface having a nominal skid number of 75.2. For the brake efficiency tests, the wet surface skid number was nominally 3 1.9. A 40% weight (curb weight + 400 lb load) condition was used for the remaining tests, with the exception of the minimum weight braking efficiency, which was conducted at curb weight + 160 lb load. Stopping distance of the vehicle slightly exceeded the requirement of 155 ft. Braking efficiency, however, was considerably above the 80% requirement at 86%. The vehicle satisfied the specification for brake efficiency for the minimum weight requirement only. Stopping distances for these tests are as indicated in Fig. 21 at 258 and 157 ft for maximum and minimum weight conditions, respectively. It should be noted that no stopping distance requirements are specified for these tests. Emergency brake tests were conducted for two failure mode simulations: front brakes disabled and power booster disabled. The vehicle satisfied the stopping distance in both cases with a good margin.

No performance requirement was specified for efficiency; however, it has been computed, and is presented as a matter of interest. Pedal force gain results are presented in Fig. 22 for the conditions of brake system normal, booster disabled, and front systems disabled. For each case, the specification requirement lies between the dashed lines. The vehicle performed well within the desired 85 lb pedal force goal. Generally, the gain was marginally low for the system normal and booster disabled conditions. STEERING AND HANDLING PERFORMANCE - The transient yaw response of the GM ESV is shown in Fig. 23 for both test conditions of 25 and 70 mph; the vehicle essentially complied with the design requirements. Minor deviations occurred at the 70 mph condition, where small oscillations in yaw rate continued for some time after 2 s. Steady-state yaw results (Fig. 24) at 0.4 lateral G show the same characteristic when the vehicle was operated in both the clockwise and counterclockwise directions.

Yaw rate values of 2.7 and 1.6 deg/s were recorded 2 s following steering wheel release, as compared to the requirement of 0.5 deg/s at 25 mph. The vehicle essentially returned to a straight line for the 50 mph condition with yaw rates of 0.04 and 0.3 deg/s, as compared to the requirements of 4.0 deg/s. These results substantiate those obtained by General Motors during their development testing. Manual control lateral acceleration results are presented in Fig. 26. The comparison of performance is made for various percentages of the tire pressure design value (28 psi inflation pressure was the nominal design value). Wet results are pre- sented for only the 100% design value tire inflation pressure. These tests were conducted at the 40% test load condition. For the manual control test condition, there was very little difference in the vehicle performance for the dry pavement condition having a skid number equal to 75. The wet pave- ment results were lower than expected, based on the wet surface skid number of 65. Test results for the fixed control lateral acceleration are shown in Fig. 27. The performance of the vehicle was gen- Fig. 26 - Lateral acceleration-manual control Fig. 27 - Lateral acceleration- fixed control</page><page sequence="12">ESV TEST METHODOLOGY 2067 erally lower than that for the manual control test condition. More variability was recorded, with changes in the tire pressure conditions. The wet test results are essentially the same at 0.52 G for both manual and fixed control test conditions. The vehicle met the requirements for the control-at-break- away test with very little difference between the results derived from the 100 and 225 ft circles. In many cases, the rate of steering wheel input exceeded the 500 deg/s require- ment, and in some cases was as high as 700-800 deg/s. No correlation could be found between steering wheel input rate and recovery time. Summarizing the remaining accident avoidance test results with the GM vehicle: 1. The vehicle met the steering control sensitivity require- ments. 2. The vehicle performed the overturn immunity test series well, with no indication of any incipient turnover or other handling problems in these rather severe maneuvers. 3. Passing and acceleration results exceeded the specifica- tion of 12 s at 18.8 s. The vehicle range was satisfactory at 296 miles, compared to the requirement of 250 miles. VISIBILITY - With respect to visibility, the vehicle generally met all of the requirements specified. Relatively minor deviations from the specification were noted in the forward vertical field-of-view and the rearward indirect field-of-view. GM ESV CRASH TEST RESULTS 30 MPH FRONT-TO-SIDE TESTS - A 29.6 mph front-to- side impact was conducted at Dynamic Science to evaulate the structural response and side intrusion characteristics of the GM ESV. Dynamic intrusion was 4 in, as measured on the struck side at the right front passenger position. Residual intrusion was 2-1/2 in at the same location. The same type of test was conducted at GM's Milford Proving Ground with four dummies in the struck car and two in the striking car. The impact speed was 29.8 mph and the structural responses were nearly identical to those obtained from the Dynamic Science test. Dummy head performance from both vehicles is shown in Fig. 28. The struck vehicle was impacted in the right side, resulting in high acceleration on the right front dummy's head as it impacted the interior of the vehicle. The right front occupant of the impacting car hit its head against the front dash during impact. The other occupants were within design specification. Chest accelerations were within specification with the exception of the left front occupant in the striking vehicle, as shown in Fig. 29. Pelvis and femur performance information is summarized in Fig. 30. As with the chest, the performance criteria were met, with the exception of the left front dummy in the striking car.

ARNDT 50 MPH FRONT FLAT BARRIER TEST - Prior to the 50 mph flat barrier test, the GM-09 vehicle was subjected to both a low-speed front barrier impact and a low-speed rear barrier impact to evaluate the no-damage requirements of 5 mph set forth in the GM contract. The front impact was performed nominally at 5 mph with a test vehicle weight of 5400 lb, with no dummies. No damage occurred. The rear impact into the barrier, which replaced the 5 mph rear bogey impact, was conducted at a nominal equivalent impact speed of 3 mph, and there was no damage. In the 50 mph front-to-flat barrier impact, the GM-09 vehicle exhibited an average deceleration of 26.4 G with a rate- of-crush onset of 25 G/ft, as shown in Fig. 31. Considerable variation was noted in the response as indicated, and the time which the deceleration exceeded 40 G was 10.5 ms, as com- pared to the specification requirement of 5 ms. This informa- tion was derived from average data obtained from accelerom- eters located in the occupant compartment of the vehicle at the front seat positions. The vehicle impacted the barrier at 49.27 mph. Five millisec- onds following the impact, the bumper-mounted sensors initi- ated the firing sequence to the inflatable occupant restraint sys- tem. Approximately 12-13 ms after impact, the air bag system began to deploy, and complete deployment occurred in the 20-25 ms range. The occupants then began their major interactions with the restraint system. The vehicle was occupied by four 50th percentile anthropomorphic dummies, two located in the front seating positions and two in the rear outboard seating positions. Some of the significant occupant performance results are presented in the following paragraphs. The data shown in Fig. 32 represent head performance of peak acceleration and accumulative time over 80 G. Also shown is the severity index which was not cited as a per- formance criteria in the development contract. With the exception of the right front occupant, all performance criteria were exceeded. Generally, the dynamic response of the heads had two major pulses. One was associated with the initial deceleration of the occupant, and the second was associated with rebound as the occupant was tossed back into the seat, resulting in the head impacting the headrest. A significant portion of the accumulative time over 80 G is associated with Fig. 32 - Dummy head performance-49.3 mph barrier impact (GM-09) the rebound, as shown by the crosshatched area in Fig. 32. Peak resultant accelerations were very high during the primary pulse as well as during the rebound- the dashed lines show the rebound peaks. It is interesting to note that the right front occupant's accelerations are generally lower than the remain- ing occupants. This improved performance can probably be attributed to a tearing of the right front air bag, which occurred during the crash event at approximately 60 ms following impact, and resulted in a generally softer bag for the dummy. None of the dummies bottomed-out against the front portions of the car during the crash. Fig. 33 presents chest acceleration performance for each of the occupants. The peak resultant accelerations were exceeded in all cases. No accumulative time is specified, how- ever. The pelvic and femur load performance are shown in Fig. 34. No performance criteria were specified for the pelvic acceleration; however, there is a correlation between the femur load levels and the pelvic acceleration levels. Femur loads were generally within compliance for the rear occupants. High tensile loads were noted on the left front occupant where the knees of the dummy actually pushed through the energy-absorbing knee panel and became wedged. An asymmetrical loading effect was noted on the rear dummies, where both the right femur of the right rear dummy and the Fig. 33 - Dummy chest performance-49.3 mph barrier impact (GM-09) Fig. 34 - Pelvic and femur performance-49.3 mph barrier test (GM-09)</page><page sequence="14">ESV TEST METHODOLOGY 2069 left femur of the left rear dummy were higher than their respective inner femurs. This was correlated with relatively high lateral accelerations in the pelvic regions and is attribut- able to a so-called "wedging effect" of the single rear air bag. It is believed that this would not have been experienced if a third dummy had been positioned in the center rear seating position. This conclusion is also supported by data which were derived from the striking vehicle involved in the front-to-rear test. FRONT-TO-REAR IMPACT - The speed of the impacting test vehicle was 63.8 mph. The striking vehicle, GM-08, exhibited a static crush of 10 in, while the struck vehicle, GM-09, experienced 46 in of crush. Occupant compartment accelerations on both vehicles were nominally at 12 G. The functioning of the restraint system was very similar to that of the 50 mph barrier test, as evidenced by the sequence of events being within 1-2 ms of the barrier impact. All dummy head data (Fig. 35) generally met the design requirements. A relatively minor exception occurred with the left rear occupant, in that both design criteria were exceeded during the rebound. ^ with the 50 mph barrier test, the right front air bag experienced a failure. It was a seam failure, rather than the tear that occurred during the 50 mph barrier test. A signifi- Fig. 35 - Dummy head performance- striking vehicle (GM-08) Fig. 36 - Dummy chest performance- striking vehicle (GM-08) cant difference between these two tests is that the pressure relief ports of the right front bag did not blow out in this test, but they did in the barrier impact. The right front occupant fared generally better than the others because of no rebound. Dummy chest performance, as shown in Fig. 36, met the design requirements satisfactorily in all cases. Pelvic and femur performance are shown in Fig. 37, and, as with the barrier test, the pelvic and femur loads generally show the same correlating relationship. Left front femurs were high and exceeded the specification. The outer femurs of the respective rear seat dummies were marginal as far as the specification was concerned and were again asymmetric. Two dummies were in the rear of the struck car. Each contained accelerometers in the head cavities only. Accelera- tion data shown in Fig. 38 were high. Rebound accelerations of significance occurred as the occupants hit the rear of the front seat. The dynamic pressure rise within the occupant compartment measured at the front and rear seating positions is shown in Fig. 39. A peak d-c pressure rise of 1-3/4 psi occurred at both seating positions. These data were derived from the 50 mph barrier test and are identical to the data obtained from the front-to-rear test. Peak sound levels were measured at 165.2 dB at the front seating position and 161.4 dB at the rear seating position. POSTCRASH FACTORS - In the postcrash factors area, the vehicle performed well.

FUTURE TESTING At the time of this writing, the Office of Experimental Safety Vehicle Programs within the NHTSA is involved in actual ESV testing, as well as planning for the future. The Ford ESV is currently undergoing accident avoidance testing, after which it will be subjected to a 50 mph barrier crash. Subsequent to the Ford ESV delivery, the Ford Motor Com- pany graciously offered, and DOT accepted, a second ESV for testing. DOT has also had the good fortune of receiving the first of what is hoped to be a good number of foreign ESVs for evaluation, the 1500 lb class Fiat ESV. In conjunction with other organizations in the NHTSA, the Office of ESV Programs is making a concerted effort to improve the methodology for both accident avoidance and crash testing, and encourages others to do the same.</page></plain_text>
