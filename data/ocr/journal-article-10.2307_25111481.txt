<plain_text><page sequence="1">USING GREIMAS' NARRATIVE SEMIOTICS: SIGNIFICATION IN FAULKNER'S "THE OLD PEOPLE" John N. Duvall A. J. Greimas' narrative semiotics combines narratology and semiotics.l The study of narrative is, of course, as old as Aristotle's Poetics. Semiotics, part of the structural revolution in intellectual thought begun by Marx and Freud, is the study of sign systems; like Freudianism and Marxism, it ana lyzes social and cultural phenomena by isolating units of signification and examining their structural interrelationship. Narrative semiotics manifests a desire to make literary studies systematic and scientific. Herein lies the chief limitation of applying semiotics to literature: its scientificity makes it in compatible with stylistic analysis (a serious drawback when studying Faulk ner) and aesthetic evaluation. Narrative semiotics seeks, rather, to reveal se mantic and ideological content of texts. Greimas' theory has been strongly influenced by Saussure's structural lin guistics, Propp's structural analysis of folklore, and L?vi-Strauss' structur al analysis of myth. From Saussure, Greimas adopts a linguistic metaphor, which is at the heart of his theory. Literature is a language, and the individ ual narrative is a sentence for Greimas. He wishes to understand the gram mar of the narrative sentence, to find the paradigmatic langue of narrative, and to see how it is embodied in the parole of the individual narrative.2 Just as Jakovson isolates phonemes and L?vi-Strauss seeks out mythemes, Grei mas looks for sememes, the smallest unit of semantic signification, which he finds in the actant. Actantial analysis looks at the entities that act.3 (Since Greimasian analy sis has such an algebraic quality, I will give each term's symbol parentheti cally.) Every narrative has six actants operating on three axes: 1) the axis of desire on which the subject (S) carries out the major action to obtain the ob ject (O); 2) the axis of communication on which the destinateur (Dl) or sender gives the object to the destinataire (D2) or receiver, which is also the subject; and 3) the axis of conflict on which the subject confronts both ad juvants (A) or helpers and opposants or traitors (T?to avoid confusion with the object). Actantial analysis differs from the traditional study of character in that it denies the anthropomorphic; act?nts do not represent human agents and they need not even be characters. Heredity or environ ment might be a destinateur, physical strength might be an adjuvant, and a 192</page><page sequence="2">USING GREIMAS' NARRATIVE SEMIOTICS 193 character's psychological weakness might be an opposant. Greimas schema tizes the three axes as follows: Dl-&gt; O- D2 ? A - S &lt;-T The next larger unit in Greimas' system is the function (F), which involves at least two actants engaged in the action of a verb. Functions then serve as the basis for the narrative program (NP), which involves all six actants and in which the subject either fails or succeeds in achieving the object. A narra tive sequence (NS) may contain one or more narrative programs; two simul taneous plots would mean two narrative programs. And the entire narrative may contain one or many narrative sequences, just as a sentence may be simple or compound.4 Perhaps the part of Greimas' theory which has the greatest potential for direct application in the classroom is the semiotic square, a combination of logic and linguistics, which analyzes the deep structure of any given text.5 The square is a versatile mode of analysis since it can be used at any level? character, setting, or the narrative itself. Greimas draws on Saussure's bi narism and on Levi-Strauss' insistence that binarism is the structuring prin ciple of the human mind. Jonathan Culler does a concise job of explaining Greimas' "elementary structure of signification" as? a four-term homology (A:B::-A:-B) . . . [which] 'furnishes a semiotic model designed to account for the initial articulations of meaning within a semantic micro-universe' (Du Sens [Paris: Seuil, 1970], p. 161). Since meaning is dia critical any meaning depends both on oppositions, and this four-term struc ture relates an item to both its converse and its contrary (black:white::non black:non-white). This basic configuration holds also ... for the simplest representation of the meaning of a text as a whole. It is grasped as a correla tive between two pairs of opposed terms.6 To illustrate the semiotic square, let us take what amounts to the semantic universe for Greimas, the opposition between "being" and "appearing": TRUE Being-Appearing SECRET ) \ / I DELUSION Not Appearing' NNot Being FALSE This semiotic square has applications to all texts since it allows one "to</page><page sequence="3">194 COLLEGE LITERATURE characterize states of being and to determine thereby the truthfulness of the characters and events which will be true, false, secretive, or delusive."7 Truth, as the square shows, combines being and appearing; falseness com bines non-being and non-appearing; a secret unites being with non-appear ing; and a delusion or lie unites non-being with appearing. Truth here is not an absolute; it merely refers to the self-contained truth generated in a given text. The structure of this square, which has universal implications and ap plications for Greimas, shows the way the four terms of the homology oper ate; an individual text creates its own particular micro-universe or deep structure, which, while always structured along the lines of this square, need not be limited to the opposition between being and appearing. In the analy sis which follows, for example, I will be concerned with the oppositions be tween nature and culture, knowledge and ignorance, and patience and im patience. What follows now is an application of Greimas' theory to Faulkner's "The Old People," from Go Down, Moses. Because of the story's complex ity, I feel somewhat apprehensive in applying Greimas, since applications generally have been performed on short, simple texts such as medieval tales or Maupassant's "Two Friends," which Greimas himself has done.8 And yet I believe that, because of the parallel development of structuralism with modernism, Greimas' theory, so concerned with revealing structure and se mantic content, can reveal something about the work of someone as formal ly inventive as Faulkner. I am also sensitive to the question Culler poses in Structuralist Poetics: What is gained ... by attempting to derive the structure of an imaginative world from an analysis of discourse carried out in a supposedly formal and rigorous way rather than from the more intuitive consideration of sets of images?9 It is not a "greater objectivity," as Culler suggests Greimas would answer, that makes the application of semiotics useful to literature. Certainly semi otics fails as a science; I would never expect someone else to come up with exactly the same "results" that I obtain in the Appendix. Nevertheless, I do know that narrative semiotics has allowed me to make observations I had never before made, observations which have held up on subsequent read ings of the story. Greimas provides a consistent methodology for discover ing structural relationships and as such this methodology is a valuable tool for any reader to possess. I'm not, however, advocating teaching Greimas' terminology to students, although, I do think we can teach students to look for binary oppositions. I have, in fact, used the semiotic square in class? although I didn't tell students they were learning semiotics?to help them think synchronically rather than always diachronically along the lines of the plot. I turned to Greimas largely because my students in previous semesters, especially the ones in my introductory level course on coming of age, had</page><page sequence="4">USING GREIMAS' NARRATIVE SEMIOTICS 195 expressed difficulty in coming to terms with Faulkner and "The Old Peo ple." "The Old People" is a text that resists and deflects interpretation in fairly specific ways.10 First, there is a problem with facticity. The true nature of the big buck in the story?whether corporeal or spiritual, mythical or alle gorical?is finally unknowable. We can perhaps get around this difficulty by admitting that, however unknowable, the big buck has a psychological reality for Ike (he believes in it) and that it plays an important role in Sam Fathers' act of filiation. Second and more important, there is the story's narrative structure; events are not presented chronologically. Semiotic analysis can help here by re-establishing the linear chain of events in order for us to see more clearly the narrative movement. There coexists, I claim, an alternative chronology, a cognitive one, existing in Ike's consciousness, which follows logically from the narrative's climax that begins the text.11 It is through the juxtaposition of these two chronologies within the first narra tive segment that we can come the closest to the meaning of the text, and that we can see how our quest as readers of "The Old People" most clearly parallels Ike's epistemological and ontological quest. Isaac McCaslin readily presents himself as one subject of "The Old Peo ple." His object is "the moment . . . [that] he would draw the blood, the big blood, which would make him a man, a hunter . . . ."12 Nature is Ike's destinateur since, quite simply, it is the passage of time that causes Ike to mature physically. Since he must wait until he reaches age ten to join the hunters, the passage of time is an adjuvant. Sam Fathers is undoubtedly Ike's main adjuvant. Other aids include McCaslin Edmonds?his cous in?and the other "true hunters," Walter Ewell, Major de Spain, and Gen eral Compson since they allow the boy to join their yearly hunt. Traitors or obstacles to Ike's goal are his youth and impatience and the hunter's code which gives the least experienced hunter the worst hunting ground, hence, less chance to shoot a buck. But as the story's title implies, there are two subjects in "The Old People."13 It is as much Sam Fathers' story as it is Ike's. Because of Sam's mixed black, white, and Indian genealogy, he has been unable to fit comfortably into any particular niche in Southern society. At age seventy he faces the universal problem of mortality. His nearness to death gives him the desire to pass on his Indian heritage?the racial memo ries, the love of the land and of the animals?to a son, but "Sam Fathers had no children" (p. 165). In Ike, Sam sees the opportunity to create a spiri tual heir. And what better choice could Sam make than a young boy who is, after all, an orphan? In his choice Sam can eliminate two cultural lacks? that of a childless father(s) and that of a fatherless child. Sam's knowledge of hunting and nature act as adjuvants to draw the boy to him. Traitors to Sam's desire are civilization, with its many materialistic inducements to lead a boy away from nature; Walter Ewell, who, though a fine marksman, is not an initiate into the ways of the forest; and Boon, who denies his Indian</page><page sequence="5">196 COLLEGE LITERATURE heritage. McCaslin has the status of both adjuvant and traitor. By allowing Sam nearly free rein in educating Ike, McCaslin is an aid. His role as traitor is more complex. McCaslin can be seen as one of the motivating factors in Sam and Ike's relationship. McCaslin represents Sam's earlier attempt at filiation, but McCaslin, although (as the final line of the story tells us) he shares Ike's mystical experience of seeing the big buck, rejects Sam's mysti cism and takes on the mantle of materialism when he accepts the farm (the old McCaslin plantation upon which Sam was a slave).M In the chronology of events the narrative divides into three segments: the first focuses on Ike's quest for his first buck; the second examines the hunt ers' quest for the big buck; and the third shows Ike's attempt to share his ex perience with McCaslin. (See appendix for a complete semiotic schematiza tion.) These three segments correspond roughly to the three numerical divi sions in the text. There are some special problems in trying to establish an accurate chron ology of events in the first narrative segment. One is the repetition of events that helps represent the sameness of the yearly hunting trips. For example, where a linear narrative would begin, "once each year, in late fall . . ." (p. 168), we learn of the cyclic nature of Ike's waiting: "Soon now. Soon now. Just three more years (or two more or one more) and I will be ten. Then Cass said I could go" (p. 169). Or a few pages later we learn that Ike would be allotted "one of the poorer stands, since he was only ten and eleven and twelve . . ." (p. 176). Another problem is where to place Ike's remembering McCaslin's interpretation of Sam Fathers (pp. 167-68). It seems likely that this interpretation comes after Sam leaves for the hunting camp. Possibly it is part of the same conversation that Ike and Cass have on page 174. The only textual evidence I have for asserting such a chronological arrangement is Ike's plea, "Let him go!" (p. 167), since it would make sense for Ike to be remembering, consciously or not, Sam Father's request of McCaslin: "Let me go" (p. 173). These problems aside, in the first narrative segment, Ike's narrative pro gram is successful; he gets his first buck and achieves the status of a hunter and man: "in less than a second he had ceased forever to be the child he was yesterday" (p. 181). Sam's program is, however, indeterminate; it is uncer tain whether he has succeeded in creating Ike as his spiritual son. In the second segment the text misleads us by foregrounding the hunt for the big buck. Sam Fathers seems to be playing his accustomed role of hunt ing guide. It is not until Ike and Sam encounter the big buck that we learn that Sam's goal is at cross purposes with that of Ike, Walter, and Boon. In the first segment Sam performs the ritual of manhood by marking Ike's face with the deer's blood; now he performs the ritual of filiation by summoning forth the big buck. Ike, so impressed by the sight, fails to fire at the buck. (What clarity the story would have if he had.) Sam salutes the big buck as "Chief" and "Grandfather," claiming a familial/totemic relationship with</page><page sequence="6">USING GREIMAS' NARRATIVE SEMIOTICS 197 the deer. Ike's and the other hunters' program fails because they don't get their trophy, but Ike comes away with a mystical understanding, a superior appreciation of nature. Sam achieves his object; Ike, though not fully aware of it, is now Sam's spiritual heir. The third and shortest segment occurs at Major de Spain's house and it provides Ike with his third test. In bed with McCaslin, Ike feels the need to share and to synthesize his experience in the forest. He doesn't realize that he is guaranteed success even before he begins because of McCaslin's simi lar experience with Sam. Ike's need to share his experience is similar to that of Coleridge's ancient mariner. For both the magnitude of their mystic ex perience imposes the need to try to articulate that event. It is the sharing of the experience that justifies and synthesizes it. It now becomes possible to schematize some narrative statements. An other French semiotician, Claude Bremond, stresses the movement from one state of being to another, achieved through a series of challenges which are either won or lost, so that Ike's movement into adulthood might be seen in this way: (trophy) state of being + challenge + win + challenge + loss + state of being (child, orphan) (killing a (status (the big win (a (son) buck) of hunter buck) newunder and man) standing of nature) Sam's metamorphosis fits a similar scheme: state of being + challenge + win + challenge + win + state of being (barren old (to create (smears (to create (shows (parent) man) a man) Ike a son) Ike with big buck) blood) Although Bremond and Greimas largely disparage each other's work (perhaps since it covers similar ground), their view that narratives move from stasis to action and back to stasis reveals similar conclusions. Grei mas, however, stresses the contractual element of the change from one state of being to another. For example, McCaslin's promising Ike that he can join the hunters when he is ten is a kind of contract. More significant is the implied contract, which at first seems like no contract at all, resulting from the interrelation of the two subjects' objects: F . . (Dl? O?*-D2) Dl-Sam;0-manhood;D2-Ike 'communication (Dl?0?D2) O-spiritual continuation of Sam's lineage Or, to translate this symbolic representation, Sam will help Ike achieve his goal of manhood in return for Ike's giving himself to Sam as a son. The rea son the above does not seem to be a contract is that Ike does not know that</page><page sequence="7">198 COLLEGE LITERATURE he has entered any agreement; he believes Sam teaches him the ways of the woods out of a purely altruistic impulse. Hence Ike's love for Sam; hence Sam's potential for creating a son. As a contract, this accurately reflects the parent-child relationship in Western culture. Children, although they may not enter into contracts, are bound by birth to their parents; parents are both bound to children by legal contract and may bind them in certain ways without their consent. This unspoken and unacknowledged contract is, semiotically speaking, valid and binding, since it provides the basis for all the action of the story. The initial state of the social contract, then, reveals a lack?Sam is child less and Ike is fatherless. For Greimas the movement from being into doing is initiated by a transgression. In this case, Sam's leaving for the hunting camp transgresses the implied contract since he cannot act as Ike's teacher while they are separated. To describe the doing, Greimas uses Propp's no tion of the three-part test. These three tests, while different in externals, all reveal the same conflicts and desires. Thus, Sam's teaching Ike, his per forming the ritual of manhood, and his calling forth the big buck all signify a father-son relationship; and Ike's killing his first buck, his seeing the big buck, and his telling McCaslin of that experience all illustrate Ike's need to know about nature. In the end, the terms of the implied contract are ful filled; the two lacks have been liquidated. The narrative movement could be formulated in the following manner: Sam: will help Ike kill buck social contract leaves for hunting camp + transgression + D1 D2 = S 1) teaching Ike 2) granting manhood 3) creating a son + (test x 3) + Ike: learns about the old people Ike gives Sam: himself to Sam Sam has an heir time allows Ike to reach age 10 1) Killing 1st buck 2) seeing big buck 3) sharing the experience Dl D2 = S + new social contract Ike: Ike has a father I suggested earlier that there is an alternative way of ordering the first narrative segment; it involves changing our conception of Ike's narrative</page><page sequence="8">USING GREIMAS' NARRATIVE SEMIOTICS 199 program, and the result is a cognitive chronology. This alternative program may be delineated as follows: Fachievmg(S?O) S-Ike; 0-killing his first buck (pp. 163-65) Fmemory(S?O) S-Ike; O-Sam Fathers (pp. 165-77) Fbeing(SnO) S-Ike; O-manhood (pp. 165, 177-78) Despite the simplicity of this delineation, complexities arise in examining the middle function, the cognitive one.15 Once we begin the paragraph in which we learn of Sam's parentage (p. 165), we are learning of events as they enter Ike's consciousness, although the third-person narration dis guises this fact. It seems odd that after an obsessive quest of at least six years Ike should think of his achievement of killing the buck solely in terms of his relationship to Sam Fathers. Yet that is precisely what happens. Ike's quest, then, on the cognitive level seems to be both epistemological and on tological; by seeking to know his teacher (and soon to be spiritual father), he hopes to understand himself better. Such a way of viewing Ike's goal is particularly satisfying in light of the third narrative segment, which directly shows Ike's attempt to synthesize experience. Certainly the cognitive quest does not deny the surface quest for deer, but it does take us perhaps closer to an understanding of the deep structure of the text. Since the climax of Ike's quest for his first buck is at the beginning of the narrative, the text causes the reader to focus on the language and the narra tive technique, and hence the process of signification. Ike, after he kills his first buck, unconsciously concerns himself with two questions, which might be formulated as follows: what is Sam Fathers and what is his influence on me? These questions are quite similar to the questions we as readers ask as we engage the text. As we follow Ike's memory of perception we run up against the same epistemological walls that Ike does, the same limits to knowing. We (Ike, you, I) know that Sam valorizes his Indian heritage; we know that both the blacks and the whites do not understand quite how to take Sam. There is McCaslin's interpretation of Sam in which he asserts, "When [Sam] was born, all his blood on both sides, except the little white part, knew things that had been tamed out of our blood so long ago that we have not only forgotten them, we have to live together in herds to protect ourselves from our own sources" (p. 167, italics added). But we know (though perhaps here the boy, Ike, could not be expected to have figured this out) that we can devalue McCaslin's interpretation simply because he hasn't stopped to figure out Sam's genealogy. As son of a Chickasaw chief and a quadroon woman, Sam Fathers would be one-half Indian, one-eighth black, and three-eighths white; the "little white part" of Sam's blood that McCaslin speaks of is, in reality, a larger factor than the black blood. This factual error undercuts McCaslin's theorizing. Ike knows that Sam Fathers defies the two categories of Southern soci ety's black-white dichotomy. This construct claims that Sam is black?and</page><page sequence="9">200 COLLEGE LITERATURE hence inferior?because he has a black grandmother; it also claims that Boon is white?and hence superior?even though he has an Indian grand mother. Yet the difference between Boon and Sam is "immediately appar ent" to Ike: Boon was . . . absolutely dependent for his very bread . . . [on] Major de Spain and McCaslin, hardy, generous, courageous enough, a slave to all the appetites and almost unrationative. In the boy's eyes at least it was Sam Fathers, the negro, who bore himself not only toward his cousin McCaslin and Major de Spain but toward all white men, with gravity and dignity and without servility or recourse to that impenetrable wall of ready and easy mirth which negroes sustain between themselves and white men. (p. 170) Essentially, Ike expands the dichotomy into a logical square: White?Boon ^ ^ Black?Sam non-black ^ ^ non-white In Ike's perception, Boon, whom society labels white, lacks the qualities Ike's society associates with white men; hence Boon seems non-white. In deed Boon's dependency makes him by implication seem like what his soci ety calls black. Sam, labeled black by society, exhibits none of the "black" characteristics; hence Sam seems non-black. He does "white man's work" and is self-reliant and proud; thus by implication he seems more like what Ike's society calls white. Ike's perception of race is a fine example of how the text creates meaning. In his quest to understand Sam, Ike must necessar ily push beyond the prejudice his society imposes. Thus "The Old People" illustrates that the quest for knowledge of a person, place, or thing can be valuable for exposing false hierarchies and power structures. The attempt to know one's influences leads to knowledge of one's world which in turn leads to knowledge of oneself. This causal chain is why Ike's quest is onto logical as well as epistemological. Since knowledge of the world is so crucial to the text, what exactly does Ike's world look like? A semiotic square, expanding the basic semantic bi nary opposition between nature and culture, produces the following spatial distribution:16 wilderness ^_ city (mysticism) hermitage/sanctuary -*- farm (idealism) (materialism) The only post in this schematization that is not directly evident in the text is the heterotopic one, yet the city comes into play when the narrator suggests</page><page sequence="10">USING GREIMAS' NARRATIVE SEMIOTICS 201 that "perhaps even a city-bred man . . . could not have understood [loving the life he spills]" (p. 181).17 The arrows in this spatial distribution suggest the cyclical movement of the hunters. For the most part, even "the true hunters" are only able to discard briefly the materialism of their farms for the idealism of the hunting camp; that is why the arrows point both ways between the farm and the sanctuary. Ike (as well as, at one time, McCaslin) achieves the mysticism of the wilderness. McCaslin however may be ulti mately placed at the post of materialism, since it is the value he embraces. Sam Fathers lives at the hunting camp, a kind of hermitage, in order that his journey into the wilderness may be that much shorter; thus the arrows point both ways between the hermitage and the wilderness. The chronology of events leading to Ike's temporary achievement of the topic space reveals another semiotic square: manhood?age 12 childhood?before age 10 non-childhood? ^ non-manhood age 10-12 This square accurately reflects the metamorphosis of Ike's status in relation to his age, but it is only useful in so far as it reveals something of the text's values. Sam's patience is continually contrasted with Ike's impatience. Therefore, if we collapse "patience" and "impatience" into "waiting"? since both signify ways of waiting?and reduce "loving" and "killing" (perhaps the most difficult paradox in the text, because Ike loves "the blood he spills" [p. 181]) into "knowing," we can relate Ike's three ages to the value system he learns from Sam. But how can loving and killing possibly reduce to knowing? If we take the loving and the killing metaphorically, they can be seen as analogous to the appreciative and analytic modes of knowing. To love the buck is the ideal way of knowing it. In this way Ike can appreciate the buck's beauty, speed, and grace. But to kill the buck is an alternative and pragmatic way of knowing the buck. Remember all the prac tical knowledge Ike acquires as he kills his first buck. These two ways of knowing?loving and killing?are not unlike the ways a reader can ap proach a text (like "The Old People"). He may love it unreflexively out of sheer delight in form, or he may "kill" it with close analysis to see how and what the form signifies. A good reader will, like Isaac, both love and kill the text, and the best reader will, like Sam Fathers, summon forth the spirit of the text afterwards by articulating that experience of loving and killing. I would like to offer, then, this semiotic square as a schematization of the deep structure of this text:</page><page sequence="11">202 COLLEGE LITERATURE knowing ignorance waiting + / waiting - non-ignorance non-knowing waiting - waiting + If we superimpose the square of Ike's chronological development on this square, we can begin to see what he learns. At ages eight, nine, and ten Ike is impatient to begin his quest. He starts at a position of ignorance about the ways of the big woods. From ages ten through twelve Ike is in a sort of limbo. He is still impatient; he "knows" about the knowledge of loving and killing because Sam Fathers has told him, but he does not yet understand the significance of what he has learned by rote. It remains for Ike to kill his first buck and to see Sam summon forth the big buck in order that he may shed his ignorance and comprehend the role of patience as prerequisite to knowing. Surely Ike's path to knowledge suggests a methodology with which we as readers are familiar; we approach an unfamiliar text in ignor ance, engage it in several readings (impatient for its meaning), and finally achieve that flash of insight in which the text reveals much of its meaning. Semiotic analysis has led to a revelation of this story's contractual and ideological nature. What does matter, finally, is that we, like Ike, engage in the quest. On the surface level of "The Old People" neither the ironic ma terialism of McCaslin nor the Chickasaw mysticism of Sam Fathers is valor ized, but at the level of deep structure Ike's quest is our quest and Ike's way to knowledge suggests the critic's way to knowledge of the text. APPENDIX The following is a delineation of the various functions and programs within the three narrative segments of "The Old People." I have schematized the first segment most fully to illustrate the special problems of establishing a chronology of events. In the final two segments I delineate only the major functions.

For a useful introduction to Greimas see his "Elements of a Narrative Grammar" (Diacritics, 1, No. 1 [1977]), upon which much of this paper is based. A useful tool in understanding narrative semiotics is Introduction ? la s?miotique narrative et discursive (Paris: Classiques Hachette, 1976) by J. Courtes, one of Greimas' students. In this es say I focus primarily on those aspects of Greimasian narrative semiotics which can help us analyze literary narratives. My emphasis, then, is close to that of the American New Critics?the "textual." For a suggestion of the ways this analysis can be extended to cover other levels (i.e., questions of text-context relation ships), see the important essay, "The Interactions of Semiotic Constraints" (YaleFrench Studies, 41 [1968]) that Greimas wrote with Fran?ois Rastier. 2 Saussure's langue and parole are roughly equivalent to Chomsky's "compe tence" and "performance." Langue or competence refers to the theory or gram mar of a language?what the language should be ideally?and parole or per formance refers to what individual's actually say and write. As Jonathan Culler says, langue and parole are analogous to "rule and behavior" (Structuralist Po etics [Ithaca: Cornell Univ. Press, 1975], p. 8). 3 In Structuralism and Semiotics (Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1977) Ter rence Hawkes illustrates how much Greimas' actantial analysis owes to Propp's theory of character (p. 69). See also Culler, pp. 232-33. 4 There are several techniques for establishing the limits of segments. Verbal clues such as "but," "then," "the following day . . . ," or "at the next train sta tion . . ."all might signal the beginning of a new segment. Any temporal or spa cial shift should be considered as well as the presence or absence of certain ac tors.</page><page sequence="14">USING GREIMAS' NARRATIVE SEMIOTICS 205 5 Greimas' notion of deep structure comes from generative grammar. Changing a sentence from active to passive voice is merely a stylistic change of the surface structure and does not change the semantic content or deep structure. For Greimas, the plot of a narrative is its surface. The deep structure is found in atemporal, logical groupings of sememes. 6 Culler, p. 92. See also Hawkes, p. 88. 7 A. J. Greimas and J. Courtes, "The Cognitive Dimension of Narrative Dis course," trans. Michael Rengstorf, New Literary History, 7, No. 3 (1976), 440. 8 A. J. Greimas, Maupassant, la s?miotique du texte (Paris: Seuil, 1976). 9 Culler, p. 84. 10 To date criticism of "The Old People" has been overshadowed by commentary on "The Bear." Only Glauco Cambon in "Faulkner's 'The Old People': The Numen-Engendering Style" (Southern Review, NS 1, No. 2 [1965], 94-107) has dealt exclusively with "The Old People." In his richly suggestive but self-defeat ingly subjective article, Cambon sees the hunting ritual as "an actual adoption of Ike on the part of Sam" that provides continuity for Sam's "ancestral heri tage." Doom represents an Adam who ruins the Edenic nature of the land by en gaging in the sin of buying and selling. Ike becomes a Christ figure who redeems the land from Doom's sin. Two other articles which are symptomatic of the un dervaluation of "The Old People" are Gloria R. Dussinger's "Faulkner's Isaac McCaslin as Romantic Hero Manqu?" (The South Atlantic Quarterly, 68, No. 3 [1969], 377-85) and Arthur Kinney's "Faulkner and the Possibilities for Hero ism" (Southern Review, NS 6, No. 4 [1970], 1110-25). Dussinger claims that "The Old People" "serves as a prelude to the fully orchestrated symphony of 'The Bear.' " Kinney, though he sees "The Old People," "The Bear," and "Delta Autumn" as a trilogy constituting "the fundamental portion of Go Down, Moses," largely ignores the first story to concentrate on the latter two. 11 In Epiphany in the Modern Novel (Seattle: Univ. of Washington Press, 1971) Morris Beja, writing specifically about The Sound and the Fury, Light in Au gust, Absalam, Absaloml, praises Faulkner's narratives that open in the fiction al present with the key dramatic event and then go "back to the events leading up to that present and [evoke] the past in many ways, but particularly by means of an epiphany, which Faulkner repeatedly uses as a structural device to intro duce the flashback .... Thus ... the order in which events are presented to the reader is not a chronological and historical one, but a visionary and psycho logical one" (pp. 182-83). I hope I am not splitting hairs by claiming the exist ence of a cognitive or psychological chronology. 12 William Faulkner, "The Old People" in Go Down, Moses (New York: Random House, 1973), p. 175. This edition has been used for all page references to the story. 13 The title, of course, refers to the stories that Sam tells Ike about the Chickasaw Indians who formerly inhabited the land. I am, admittedly, taking some liberties with Greimas because of the limitations of space here. Strict Greimasian analysis of this story would require a book-length study. One cannot, in his theory, de duce the subjects from a title. The subject can only be determined after examin ing the narrative programs. I give the subjects here primarily for lucidity of presentation. My whole analysis, however, was generated from the work in the</page><page sequence="15">206 COLLEGE LITERATURE appendix in which I did derive the subjects from the narrative programs and seg ments. 14 McCaslin's rejection of the filial role that Sam tries to establish helps to explain his irony in his comments on Ike's and Sam's relationship. One example of this irony occurs when Sam asks permission to live at the hunting camp. McCaslin queries, "What about Isaac here ... ? How will you get away from him? Are you going to take him with you?" (p. 173). These ironic questions reveal that McCaslin views his cousin's and Sam's relationship as something pleasant yet harmless, something which Ike will grow out of when his turn comes to take over the farm. This expectation, however, is frustrated in "The Bear." 15 In the delineation of functions, the symbol of the arrow (-*) indicates the move ment of the subject toward the object. In the function of being, "D" represents the union of subject and object. Functions of being may also be represented as qualifying statements (QS), as I have sometimes done in the appendix. 16 This spacial distribution fits a number of Faulkner's works: Flags in the Dust (or Sartoris), Sanctuary, and Light in August. 17 For Greimas, the spatial distribution is an opposition between the topic and heterotopic spaces. The essential transformation of the story always occurs in the topic space; the heterotopic space is, literally, the other space. In this square, then, the other two posts are the non-heterotopic and the non-topic spaces.</page></plain_text>
