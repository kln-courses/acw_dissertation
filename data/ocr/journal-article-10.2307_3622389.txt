<plain_text><page sequence="1">WHY WAS LEVI BEN HAYYIM HOUNDED A. S. HALKIN The campaign of the years 1304-1305, which culminated in the proclamation of a ban on the study of philosophy before a student reached the age of 25, is chronicled in the composition called Minh.at K.end5t.' Its editor was Abba Mari ben Moshe ben Yosef,2 the chief protagonist in the undertaking to issue the ban. In his letters, the renowned Rabbi Shelomo ben Adret (Rashba),3 to whom Abba Mari appealed to take action against rampant heresy, refers several times to two or three scholars of the Provence who have exceeded bounds, and are endangering the survival of Torah.4 (It is of interest to note that in one com- munication in which he speaks with much bitterness of the greater respect for philosophy than for Jewish lore, he never- theless challenges Abba Mari's charge that they are laying bare what the Ancient of days has covered: I feel, he says, that they have revealed nothing of the hidden... their folly saves them from this.s Was he thinking of Kabbalah?). He is particularly angry with Levi ben Abraham ben Hayyim. This scholar,6 born about 1250 at a place near Perpignan, was a poor man who evidently lived by teaching and patronage.6a He is the author of several works, among them u'znkm mvmn ,nn, i Published by M.

The second part deals with 1) prophecy and the secrets of the Torah; 2) the secrets of faith; 3) creation. No complete Ms. of the work exists, and its contents are still conjectural to a degree.' Several letters of the compilation Minhat KIenaot concern Levi ben IHayyim. He is first mentioned by Don Crescas Vidal, to whom the Rashba addressed a request to exert himself in behalf of Jewish tradition.9 Don Crescas, evidently an important individual, is reluctant to involve himself in this issue, con- tending that nothing unusual has developed to require special action.Io He also reports in the name of Samuel l'Escaleta, whom he lauds most lavishly for his piety and uprightness," that Levi ben Hayyim, who is staying in his home is the victim of the perversity of the accusers, "for I find him punctilious about the Law, attending synagogue services morning and evening, walking the path of the good and the way of the righteous. If I should find him sinful and guilty of the least transgression I will simply not have him in my house.''I2 How- ever, Don Crescas also reports the contention of his detractors that his piety is merely a disguise, and that he is in fact a heretic.'3 7 The first nmo was published with commentary by Davidson, loc. cit., u-o, and the introductory remarks, i-n; he published the seventh in Scripta Mathematica, as above. 8 For a summary of its contents see Renan, op. cit., 637 ff. 9 Letter 10 (pp. 44-45).

The Rabbi also writes to Levi himself, in response to a communication from the latter in which he exonerates himself by explaining that his secular studies fol- lowed years of study of Talmud. He is angry, and admonishes him to relinquish his pursuit of philosophy, and to return "to his first wife."'s The untimely death of Samuel's daughter was regarded by the bereaved father as punishment for the sin of acting host to Levi, and he was asked to leave.'6 He went to stay with his relative Reuben ben Samuel, whom he calls his father-in-law.'7 His second host was similarly taken to task by Rashba, and he also attempted a defense of his guest. Levi's subsequent wan- derings are not clear. We know that he was in Arles in 1314.18 Nor can the year of his death be determined. The difficulties to which Levi was exposed need an explana- tion. Why was he hounded more than contemporaries of his who also engaged in philosophic studies?

Defenseless, he could be attacked without fear.21 My attention was drawn to this scholar in the course of a study of the ban on philosophy of 1305.2 In Minhat Kenddt, the source-book for" this ban, he is charged with treating every- thing in the Torah, from the story of creation to the theophany on Mt. Sinai, as allegory, not even sparing the precepts from this treatment.23 He is accused of converting the account of the battle of the four kings against the five (Genesis 14) into the story of the conflict between the four elements in the human body and the five parts of the human mind;;24 the sons of Jacob to the twelve signs of the zodiac.25 He is also attacked for holding that the Mem and the Samekh did not fall out of the tablets of the Law because they were attached by very thin chips of stone.26 I read the section called Boaz, which is part six of his voluminous composition Livyat Ien, to become familiar at first hand with the thinking of this "irresponsible" individual. Undoubtedly Levi indulges extensively, - one might say: ex- cessively - in allegorization. Like his contemporaries, and like cations rationnelles des passages agadiques, Levi offre peu d'iddes neuves." And on p. 644 we read: Quelquefois on est tente de trouver que la temp~te fut dichai^ne pour peu de chose.

The following example will illustrate his method. The Flood indicates loss, and the meaning of bringing a flood on the world is the loss suffered by the microcosm, man. This happens when he lowers the energy from the mind, i. e. the intellect, with which he can produce superior power, by subduing it to the evil inclination... The ark refers to the need of improving and training his qualities so that they will not drown him. Man's measure of his success is intimated in the image of the lower, second and third stories. The fifteen cubits of the rise of the water refers to the fifteen material forces which succeed in covering the hills of the qualities. At the end of forty days, that is at the age of forty, Noah opened the window of the ark, because at that age the intellect becomes evident . . . 27The rainbow signifies that the Active Intellect displays its splendor and shines on the cloud of the material intellect... With the aid of the knowledge which it bestows on the human intellect, man clings to God and sees His glory in the form of his intellect, which is an image like that of the angels, and man's capacity grows as the content increases. This is the sense of the rainbow in the story of the flood and in the vision of Ezekiel . . . "When I bring a cloud" is when man's intellect darkens and becomes murky.28 The statement of the Rabbis "whoever gazes at the 27 7m n'i nz -pviB mmmrnwm: in m nc oy77311 2T m fl ) . ?,W,,m?

It is like their state- ment: Man must not inquire what is above and what is below.29 This last remark of Levi's allows us a glimpse into the in- nocent conviction of the philosophers that their position was unassailable. He does not hesitate to find support in a Rabbinic passage which teaches the contrary of what they believed. It evidently did not occur to them that the Rabbis shied away deliberately from inquiry into the questions of metaphysics or even physics.3? This example from his exegesis can be multiplied dozens of times. They prove how attractive he found allegorization. However, in view of the accusations hurled against him by the so-called literalists, although he was clearly a member of a school of thought, the question which requires an answer is: What was his position on the plain meaning of the text? How did he react to the literal sense of the commandments? Several times he provides answers to the questions. Evidently he felt himself on the defensive, for fear of being suspected of wavering faith. In opening the allegorical explanation of the war between the four kings and the five, he adds significantly: "although the literal meaning of the text is true and provides instruction."31 He introduces an interpretation offered by "the sage R. Mosheh son of the sage R. Shmuel ibn Tibbon" to the effect that Jacob's wives and children stand for the faculties of the soul as Aristotle listed them in his de Anima, but he makes the noteworthy declaration "although the literal meaning is undoubtedly true. It is with this understanding that I offered this allegorization and similar ones."32 Again, at the beginning 29 Ibid.: i n ,n Y ," (o i? n' ( n) ra'pz uflYznan.i n i int ,ri... 30o Cf. M.

However, the words of Torah take several meanings, being like a sledge-hammer which splits a rock."33 A particularly important statement is made in his chapter on the Revelation. "Therefore," he writes, "Moses saw things clearly, without parable or riddle, in line with the verse 'vision not riddles.' Therefore those who convert the miracles or the precepts and laws into symbols, and discover illegitimate mean- ings in the Torah are heretics and Epicureans, and alter the words of the living God... Nor is it right to transform the stories unless one is compelled to or does it homiletically or confirmatively, because we know that there is not a story or sentence in the Torah without benefit or wisdom, towards knowledge or the moral life... Therefore the Bible says: 'Open my eyes so that I can look on the wonders of your Torah,' because the entire Torah comes from the Almighty, and there is no distinction between and the name of his wife was Mehetabel or and the sister of Lotan was Timna and between I am the Lord thy God or Thou shalt have no other God."'34 He devotes a number of chapters to an exposition of the precepts. In the footsteps of his master he organizes them into categories.3s In addition he expresses himself clearly on the purport and significance of the precepts. "Blessed is the people," he explains verse 16 of Ps. 89, "that realizes how dearly God loves them (us) that He attached us to Himself by teaching us 33Loc. cit., ad Exod. 2.1: nmin 'inn W-O p 1 noM ps R M =n , M "mpM 34 Ibid. on the Sinai Theophany: o v ' lp' 11 y ImnIn nimn n ' nmnp y I D'~IVI1?n ? w ~pnnimixn ni ~ninbri o'zmnn ynirT'F12 *i --n ~roisn m'rn o1D'On 1 m ...

It is to be noted that his master Maimonides devotes a chapter to this matter (loc. cit. 26). While he accepts the commonly held view that precepts have an explanation, whether we discover it or not, he finds a statement in Bereshit Rabba (Par. 15, ed. Theodor 424-425), which he calls "most remarkable, without parallel in Rabbinic literature," by which he is led to the conclusion that although a precept is undoubtedly rational, some of its details may have obedience to God as their only purpose. 38 Ibid.: p'r ...

In this connection note should be taken of his admonitions in his poetic work (cf. Note 6), lines 97-121, in which he urges his disciple to fulfill unquestioningly all the prescriptions of the Rabbis, and also to postpone the study of "Greek learning" until the passions of youth have been assuaged and he has become thoroughly versed in Jewish lore (lines 122-133).</page><page sequence="9">[9] WHY WAS LEVI BEN HAYYIM HOUNDED 73 Clearly, Levi, like his colleagues, does not admit a contradic- tion between his belief in the written Torah and in Halakha and his own method of exegesis. True, in a few instances he seems to find it difficult to accept the literal meaning. For instance, in the story of the flood he raises some questions as compelling arguments for reinterpretation. The flood did not cover the whole world; the Rabbis excluded the land of Israel. Why did not God order Noah to go there? Also the ark was too small to contain couples of every variety.42 For several reasons he feels compelled to find meaning other than plain in the episode of the three angels who appeared to Abraham.43 In the Moses cycle, which he asserted to be literally true, he comments on the Rabbinic statement that Yokhebed was born in the gateway of the city that "literally it is not possible because she would be 130 when she gave birth to Moses."44 It is likely that in these few cases he ruled the plain meaning out as untenable. But it is hardly justifiable to suspect him of insincerity when he protests his faith in the literal meaning of our sources. Since Levi esteems philosophy very highly, his purpose is to discover his convictions and doctrines in Biblical and Rabbinic literature. There is no doubt that he and his colleagues drew their inspiration from Maimonides. Although the latter did not write a commentary on the Bible, nor did he interpret every story, the rules which he set down, beginning with his explanation of 90 ~o~mz ant ,mnn (Prov. 25.11) in the Introduction to the Guide,45 and several other passages in the same work, en- 42 Loc. cit., ch. 28, on the Flood: Mn b?' , atl ym n 1 Irni n n n D -11rn 1 1 11N? i m... inin brip-.6 nizim on D'o-n omn uD'~3lnl D'vrDonmrinp- 12in3 Izi'1?1 ~ ~l 'nr l 4 1 I... ?Hw' vynt4 1? l? rI rm N?n6 ) rirvl YIt ?m 43 Loc. cit., ch. 29, on the Abraham story, on, n~ ~ tm vj-e p,.

On the contrary, they were displaying the light of Torah, and were returning a lost art to its rightful owners. In his Batte ha-nefesh veha-lehashim Levi expounds at length the view commonly held by Jews and non-Jews that philosophy originated in Israel and was taken from them by the Gentile nations. (One of the lines says: The sons of Japhet adorned themselves with learning they took from the sons of Shem and the Hebrews). And because of exile and its tribulations, this learning was forgotten by its creators and builders.46 The philosophers do not always agree in their alle- gorization of a text, any more than the Rabbis in their Midrashic elaborations. It cannot be expected that every philosopher will have the same thought suggested to him by a given verse or passage. Yet for reasons which cannot be easily detected, Levi was criticized by the religious leaders more vigorously than his colleagues, because they thought it a dangerous method. When the Rashba, in one of his angry letters writes acrimoniously: He also testified before us that the man who devised against us and our Torah etc., he almost certainly is thinking of Levi, whom he condemned in other letters.47 Can it be because he earned his livelihood as a teacher? Levi cherished deeply the Torah and the faith of Israel. Like his master Maimonides he believed implicitly that every incident related in the Torah has a purpose and carries a lesson,48 in- cluding even the stories which do not reflect honor on the patriarchs. These, he felt, were preserved in order to give the lie to ugly tales which the Amorites and the Sabians invented.49 46 Loc. cit. (see Note 6), 34 sqq. (lines 190-220).

He is called 'Ibhri because he studied with Eber who "was the head teacher and the best of those who taught uprightness, kindness and truth, as well as correct beliefs."5' But Abraham went beyond this by coming to know his Maker and by winning proselytes to his faith. He served God out of love, and reached a degree which few attain "because love follows true knowledge."52 Jacob, however, surpassed him, for he suc- ceeded in divesting himself of his material existence.s3 Isaac, on the other hand, was inferior to both, for he served God out of fear as the Bible testifies - "the fear of Isaac," He was not outstandingly wise, and he pursued pleasure.54 'mi mm on- t m n o'y.

We have persisted in God's faith and have remained steadfast in His covenant, although we are victims of affliction and tried in sufferings, as the Psalmist says: All this has come upon us but we have not forgotten Thee.56 Statements of this sort, in my humble opinion, prove con- clusively that a grave injustice has been done to Levi ben Abraham ben IHayyim in branding him a heretic, a seducer and a subverter. His love of his faith, coupled with his admiration of philosophy, impelled him, as it did his fellow intellectuals, to strive zealously to demonstrate that Judaism contains all wisdom, nay, that it is the mother of all the learning which is now the proud possession of others. ss Ibid.: vn-n n m ?x 5 -oz 01 mn n m -1rt-l n ,IV?)n -To nn nn l n .rm nmnm n, ?wlvfl . nn... .
