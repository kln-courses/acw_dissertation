The objectives, results, and initial findings of many of the research program tasks, such as the transport airplane fuselage section drop tests, the com- plete narrow-body airplane drop test, and the Controlled Impact Demonstration (CID), are pre- sented. The manner in which these tests are integrated into analytical modeling methodology and their relationship to the development of improved structural crash dynamic design cri- teria are addressed. DURING THE PAST DECADE THE FAA/ NASA/ TRAN SPORT aircraft community has taken the initiative to develop jointly the means to assess quantita- tively the crash dynamics characteristics of transport category aircraft. A multifaceted program, which is depicted in Fig. 1 was formu- lated to achieve that goal (1)*. Fundamental to that program is the definition of the survivable transport impact environment, followed by the development of analytical methods to define both the structural and occupant responses in a sur- vivable crash, acquisition of data from full- scale tests, and finally the establishment of performance parameters to ensure a continued high level of occupant safety. The initial tasks to review past accident data and establish candidate survivable crash scenarios were performed by the three major transport airframe manufacturers (2) (3) (4). The results from these studies are summarized in Ref. 5. Those studies found that contemporary transport aircraft possess a commendable level of crashworthiness and the current related research efforts were accordingly directed to define quantitatively that safety level, improve the safety level where deemed necessary, and ensure that the desired safety level is main- tained in future transport aircraft design, some of which may incorporate new airframe materials. Lockheed-California Co. A primary objective of the agency's crash dynamics program is to relate, by use of a sys- tems approach, the aircraft impact condition and the resultant occupant response and injury pro- tection level to that impact. That relationship is being developed in a synergistic manner where basic impact conditions or crash scenarios are used to investigate the inherent response char- acteristics of the airframe for a range of impact conditions to define a level of airframe structural integrity. These airframe response studies are being conducted by both analytical and test means. Once the airframe response is determined one can continue to work down through the system and evaluate the dynamic behavior and structural characteristics of the airf rame/seat interface. These airf rame/seat interface stud- ies, which include the seat's occupants, may again be conducted by both analyses and test methods. The occupant response can be compared to human impact injury criteria to determine the occupant's potential to injury for the impact conditions which represent the envelope of air- frame structural integrity. Fig. 2 illustrates the major tasks related to the methodology development. An assesment of that methodology and the logical sequence of the analyses/test effort is shown in Fig. 3 (6). The myriad impact conditions and airframe configurations that must be considered in any effort to establish appropriate crash dynamic design standards necessitate the use of analyt- ical methods. The development, validation, and use of analytical methods, which are a primary element in the joint FAA/ NASA/ Indu s try crash dynamics program, are presented herein. This paper contains a description of the progress of the FAA sponsored research into modeling of transport airplane structure and airframes and provides comparisons between test and analysis.

The results of companion research efforts regarding the other agency crash dynamics program elements can be found in various summary documents. METHODOLOGY The approach that is being followed in the development of an analytical methodology is depicted in Fig. 2 (7). Supporting test data from section and full-airplane drop tests are compared to analytical modeling results with regard to airframe accelerations, crush, and failure modes. The initial analytical models are modified, if required, to update the load deflection characteristics of the fuselage un- derside, usually the most significant modeling parameter. The airframe analytical model is then run for specified impact conditions and analyses output in the form of loads (shear, 6.711</page><page sequence="3">Figure 2. Outline of Methodology Approach moment) and accelerations are obtained. The shears and moments are compared to estimates of airframe strength to provide an assessment of the integrity of the occupanti protective shell. From this sequence, it is envisioned that an envelope of survivable impact conditions can be developed on the basis of airframe struc- tural capability. 6.712</page><page sequence="4">851887 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ACCIDENT DATA REVIEW FORMULATION OF CANDIDATE CRASH SCENARIOS INITIAL APPLICATION OF METHODOLOGY TO TRANSPORT AIRPLANES SECTION I TESTS AND ANALYSES I FULL SCALE CID TEST AND ANALYSIS CORRELATION REFINEMENT OF AIRFRAME/FLOOR MODELS PARAMETRIC STUDIES-ENVELOPE OF STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY * CID - CONTROLLED IMPACT DEMONSTRATION DEVEL^PM^ENT^OF PROCEDURES QUANTIFICATION OF SEAT FLOOR PULSE DEVELOPMENT OF IMPROVED METHODOLOGY DEVELOPMENT OF VERIFIED ANALYTICAL AIRFRAME, SEAT/OCCUPANT PROCEDURES AND SUPPORTING DATA DEVELOPMENT OF METHODOLOGY AND DATA BASE L_ FOR FUTURE ADVANCED MATERIAL DESIGNS Figure 3. Transport Aircraft Impact Dynamics Program Concurrently, for each point on the enve- lope, an acceleration representative of airframe floor response, will be obtained. These air- frame floor responses (floor pulses) can become input conditions for transport aircraft seat dynamic tests and/or for seat/occupant computer models. The subsequent seat/occupant response can be ultimately compared to seat/floor air- frame interface strength values to assess seat/ occupant retention and compared to human impact injury limits to evaluate occupant's potential for injury. In each step of the approach, methodology is being refined and improved for the purpose of lessening the dependence on test data and even- tually demonstrating validation of the analysis. Validation of the modeling technique requires agreement between analysis and full-scale test- ing results. In support of methodology development the FAA is sponsoring the development and applica- tion of two analytical modeling techniques in their crash dynamics program. These being digital computer program, KRASH, which is used for evaluation of airframe response and strength characteristics and digital computer program SOMTA which is used for subsequent seat/occupant response and injury potential assessments. KRASH85 Modeling of aircraft structure for crash impact conditions, which involve large deforma- tions, has been shown to be enhanced with the use of computer programs which use empirically developed data. Programs of this type are often referred to as "hybrid." Digital computer pro- gram KRASH, which was initially developed to model helicopters subjected to multidirectional impact forces, is a hybrid program (8). Since the mid-seventies, program KRASH (under sponsor- ship of the FAA) has been extended for applica- tion to light-fixed wing aircraft and civil transport aircraft (9) (10). Released in 1979, Program KRASH has been used extensively by rotary-wing and light fixed- wing aircraft manufacturers. Program KRASH has had extensive experimental verification. A sum- mary of aircraft configurations and conditions, which demonstrates the extent of KRASH correla- tion with experimental data, is shown in Table 1. With the exception of the one test with a transport airplane, all the experimental data were obtained primarily with validation of ana- lytical modeling in mind.

KRASH analysis results, of a six- degree slope impact into an earthen mound, were compared to measured responses. The airframe remained intact for this impact (172 ft/sec. forward velocity, 18 ft/sec. effective sink speed). The analysis, in general, showed better agreement in the mid-cabin region than at the extremes of the fuselage. A complete descrip- tion of the correlation has been provided in Ref. 10. Subsequent to this analysis, under FAA funding, additional KRASH modifications were initiated (KRASH85) to enhance the program's application to a wide range of transport accidents and structural configurations. Those modifications led to the current version desig- nated KRASH85 which has recently been released for industry use (16). Some additional features of the new program are illustrated in Table 2. SOMTA The FAA is sponsoring the development of a seat/occupant digital computer model which would be applicable for transport category aircraft. That computer modeling technique would provide an analytical means to assess the dynamic per- formance characteristics of a transport category aircraft seat and evaluate the occupants' poten- tial for injury for various impact levels. Digital Computer Program SOMTA (Seat/ Occupant Model - Transport Aircraft) has been TABLE 2.

TIME HISTORIES (FORCE, ACCELERATION, VELOCITY, DISPLACEMENT) • INITIAL CONDITION BALANCE-NASTRAN-MSC COUPLING • ARBITRARY MASS NUMBERING • PRE- AND POST-PROCESS DATA USAGE • TIRE VERTICAL SPRING CODING expressly developed for that purpose (17). The model combines a three-dimensional (3-D) repre- sentation of the human body with a finite ele- ment representation of the seat structure. The occupant model consists of twelve masses repre- senting the upper and lower torso, head, neck, arms, and legs. External forces such as a floor dynamic pulse, are applied to the occupant by the cushions, floor and restraint system. For standard occupants all necessary input is stored within the program. Standard occupants are rep- resented by the 50th percentile human male and 50th percentile anthropomorphic dummy (CFR Part 572) (18). Deviations from the standard occu- pant are permissible where the user defines the occupant's physical characteristics by addi- tional input data. The seat structure is mod- eled using the finite element method of analysis to provide the flexibility to deal with a wide range of design concepts. Program SOMTA has the 6.714</page><page sequence="6">851887 capability to model large displacements, non- linear material behavior, localized failures, and various end release conditions for beam elements. VALIDATION - To validate SOMTA dynamic seat tests were conducted using standard production seats and a modified production seat. The seats tested were similar to those seats used in the FAA/NASA Transport Aircraft Controlled Impact Demonstration (CID) (19). The seats were fully instrumented and contained three anthropomorphic dummies. The seats were retained in location using standard seat to floor attachment fit- tings; however, the floor was adjusted to simu- late warpage. The modification of the production seat was the incorporation of an energy absorption capa- bility in the longitudinal direction. The energy absorbing seat is a design concept that is being investigated as a means of limiting the floor reactions resulting from a longitudinal impact condition. The energy absorbing seats underwent large deformations during dynamic testing yet they maintained their structural integrity. Modeling of those seats was used to validate the capability of SOMTA to model large displacements. Fig. 4 depicts an energy absorb- ing seat installation prior to dynamic testing and Fig. 5 illustrates the stroking action of the seat. Figure 4. Typical Transport Aircraft Seat and Dummies Installation Prior To Dynamic Test Figure 5. Modified Transport Aircraft Seat Before and After Stroking The seats used for this validation study were tested at the FAA Civil Aeromedicai Insti- tute (CAMI) in Oklahoma City in the forward facing configuration with a 9.0 g, 50 ft /sec. sled deceleration. Three 50th percentile anthropomorphic dummies (170 lbs.) were used to simulate the seat occupants. Six axes load cells were placed under the seat legs to measure the seat reactions exerted on the floor. Accel- erometers were located at the dummy's pelvis, chest, and head and load cells measuring lap belt forces were installed. The predicted occu- pant and seat positions from SOMTA simulations for three selected time intervals are shown in Fig. 6 (17). Predictions for the occupant chest acceleration, right lap belt force, and left rear seat leg vertical reaction are compared with measured test data in Figs. 7 through 9 (17). Additional validation testing is ongoing for an envelope of longitudinal dynamic test conditions as well as combined longitudinal/ side and longitudinal/vertical impact condi- tions. It is expected that SOMTA may be user ready by early 1986. FUSELAGE SECTION DROP TESTS A common agency/ indus try goal is the development of an analytical methodology which may be used to predict the dynamic responses and loading of an aircraft and its occupants sub- jected to an impact condition. The developing analytical crash dynamic modeling techniques are dependent upon accurate representation of the crush characteristics of the lower fuselage shell during an impact condition. The airframe crush characteristics are typically determined by stress analyses, static tests of individual frame s /bulkhead s or a combination of both. To investigate the validity of that approach and to increase the confidence level of the users of the developing analytical methodologies, the FAA included fuselage section drop tests as an ele- ment in their crash dynamics program. These tests were proposed to obtain experimentally and verify the analytically determined load/ deflection characteristics of various fuselage sections. 6.715</page><page sequence="7">PROGRAM SOMTA PROGRAM SOMTA TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT SEAT (MODIFIED) TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT SEAT (MODIFIED) TIME = 0.0000 SEC.

Two of the more significant changes to KRASH involved the incorporation of a plastic hinge algorithm and coding to calculate e.g. acceleration, velocity, and displacement time histories. This enabled the program to be used to model fuselage segment structure and develop representive fuselage load-deflection crush curves. Thus, the crush behavior of a large segment could be simplified as a single crush spring in a larger airframe model. Fig. 10 shows the post- test view of two similar narrow-body airplane fuselage segments. The section with the cargo was tested at the FAA Technical Center; the results are reported in Ref. 20. The section without the cargo was tested at the NASA Langley Impact Dynamics Test Facility; the results are reported in Ref. 21. The same KRASH model (Fig. 11) except for mass distribution, was used for analysis of both sec- tions. The comparison of analysis and test results is shown in Fig. 12 (7). These coordi- nated analyses/test efforts provided much of the load-deflection crush data that were used in subsequent narrow-body airplane computer models. Figure 10.

Comparison of Narrowbody Fuselage Section Analysis and Tests Results A wide-body airplane fuselage section was also tested at the FAA Technical Center; the results are reported in Ref. 22. The data from this latter drop test were used in modeling wide-body structure for comparing with potential composite fuselage designs (23). FULL SCALE AIRCRAFT DROP TEST As part of an overall FAA/NASA joint effort to develop improved crash dynamic analytical methodology, a full-scale remote piloted trans- port air-to-ground impact test was to be per- formed. The primary goal of that test, which became known as the Controlled Impact Test (CID), was to acquire crash impact data and val- idate analytical models (24). In preparation for the CID test, the FAA conducted a full-scale impact test of a narrow- body airplane at Laurinburg, North Carolina. The impact conditions were similar to the planned CID test, except for the lack gf forward velocity (17 ft/sec. sink speed, +1 nose up attitude) • Some of the goals of the full-scale airplane impact tests were to assess potential structural damage, obtain crush characteristics along the fuselage underside for both "hard" (i.e., bulkheads) and "soft" (i.e., frames) structure and provide updated input to the ana- lytical models. The pre- and post-impact views for this test are shown in Fig. 13. A qualitative comparison of the KRASH simu- lation of that test with the actual test results is shown in Table 4. The test results provided Figure 13. B707 Laurinburg Impact Test insight with regard to structural damage, crush characteristics, and failure modes for a known impact condition. For example, it was observed that "hard points," previously thought to have minimal crush capability, based on fuselage sec- tion drop test results and respective analytical simulations, could in fact crush several inches prior to restif fening.

The full-scale airplane impact test pro- vided valuable quantitative data with respect to fuselage underfloor crush characteristics. These data were integrated into the computer models that were being developed to predict the results of the Controlled Impact Demonstration. Observed airframe failure modes, such as the bulkhead web fracture and resultant floor dis- ruption illustrated in Fig. 15 also provided guidance for computer modeling of that and simi- lar structures. For example, the pre CID analy- sis results were revised as a result of changes in load-deflection curves associated with the lower fuselage crush. Fig. 16 illustrates the estimated response range before and after the "Laurinburg" test. The results of the full- scale airplane impact test indicated that the planned CID impact condition would produce the desirable severe but survivable impact scenario. Dynamic response differences due to the presence of a forward velocity component would be eval- uated in the subsequent CID test. Figure 15.

Comparison of Pre-CID Krash Stick Model Analysis Results - for Planned Symmetrical Impact Condition - Original vs Revised Defelction Curves FULL SCALE TRANSPORT CONTROLLED IMPACT DEMONSTRATION (CID) (24) A prime goal of the agency's crash dynamics program is to develop analytical modeling tech- niques which can relate a crash impact to the aircraft's and occupants' response to that impact. The FAA has sponsored the development of program KRASH for that purpose and the FAA/ NASA Controlled Impact Demonstration is an inte- gral element in the development and validation of analytical methodologies. The FAA/NASA Controlled Impact Demonstra- tion included structural experiments to provide baseline data to understand better transport airplane crash behavior. The CID is the prime source of full scale transport airplane impact data that will be used to correlate with the developing analytical modeling techniques. The CID will also enable experimenters to examine structural failure mechanisms; define impact 6.719</page><page sequence="11">floor pulses for seat studies; evaluate the per- formance of existing/modified cabin interior components; and provide baseline metal structure impact data to support composite material crash dynamics research. CID PRE-TEST ANALYSIS - Two distinct KRASH models of the CID test vehicle were developed to provide an early assessment of the CID impact scenario. These computer models were then up- dated based on the results of the full-scale fuselage sections and airplane drop tests. The updated models were subsequently used to predict dynamic response characteristics of the CID test vehicle during the planned impact. Those pre- dictions would be compared with the measured test data with the objective of validating the computer models. The first model, a 17 mass, 16 beam element stick model, depicted in Fig. 17, provides over- all airframe response and is useful in impacts where the airframe fundamental low frequency response predominates. A second expanded CID model depicted in Fig. 18 (48 masses, 137 beams), may be more beneficial in assessing detail response, provided proper structural representation can be achieved. Pretest analy- sis results for the planned CID impact scenario indicated the following: • Crush distances of approximately 4 to 6 inches along the forward fuselage, 5 to 10 inches in the wing center section, and 10 to 14 inches aft of the main landing gear bulkhead. • The Load Interaction Curve (LIC) ratio, which compares combined shear/moment forces with estimated airframe capabil- ity, showed potential for experiencing loads near the estimated fuselage strength in the region of FS960-1000 (Main Landing Gear Bulkhead). • Floor triangular pulse-shaped peak ver- tical accelerations between 8g to 10g in the passenger region (FS 460-1200); and peak longitudinal accelerations approxi- mately 4g along the fuselage. Acceleration peak responses for both models are plotted in Fig. 19, along with a constant AV = 17 ft/sec. curve. The data cluster about the constant AV curve. The stick model, due to its coarseness, tends to provide lower frequency acceleration responses than the expanded model. The higher peak accelerations are generally associated with shorter duration pulses than the lower peak values. The stick model results tend to be of a lower amplitude and broader in re- sponse duration. As the expanded model results are filtered to a lower cutoff value, the re- sponses shift to lower values and tend toward better agreement with the stick model results. An alternative to comparing peak accelera- tion values is to present an equivalent trian- gular pulse amplitude which can be obtained from Figure 17. CID Stick Model Figure 18. CID Expanded Model Figure 19. CID Pre-Test Analysis - Peak Vertical Acceleration Pulses, 17 Ft/Sec Sink Speec, + °1 Pitch 6.720</page><page sequence="12">851887 a plot of Impulse (g-sec) data, which is the acceleration integrated over time for the period of interest. This provides an average value. The peak associated with a triangular pulse is twice the average value. This approach elimi- nates questions that could arise over the print interval or filter characteristics (i.e., cutoff frequency, decay rate). Fig. 20 shows a compar- ison of the pretest analysis results for the stick and expanded models on the basis of equiv- alent triangular pulse peaks. An expanded model using equivalent triangular responses still shows higher accelerations through the passenger floor region but the differences are smaller than when comparing only peak values. The KRASH stick model acceleration responses output along the fuselage for the pre-CID test analysis are shown in Fig. 21.

Subsequently, the aircraft impacted on the left wing outboard No. 1 engine, rotated onto the No. 2 engine and impacted the forward fuselage about 400 msec, after the No. 1 engine contact. Peak ground impact responses were developed within 500 msec, after initial fuselage ground impact and prior to contact with SYMMETRICAL IMPACT CONDITIONS NOTE: PEAK ACCELERATION BASED ON FORWARD VELOCITY - 155 KNOTS TRIANGULAR PULSE - SINK SPEED - 17 FT/SEC IMPULSE x 2: 0.200&gt;At&gt;0.100 PITCH ATTITUDE - 1 0 NOSE-UP At SECONDS 14 r o&gt; o 12 - ' 2 10- g -r 3 8- ' 3 „ VERTICAL gì 6- „ t- z . uj 4 . - - g - . . 2 2 LONGITUDINAL (ju- 0.5) 0 1 1 1 1 1 F.S. 300 600 900 1200 1500 Figure 21.

Accordingly, all of the analytical efforts discussed herein deal only with the initial ground impact. Subsequent impacts with the wing cutters are beyond the scope of the agency's current analytical method- ology development program. Several analytical computer runs were made with the KRASH stick model to compare with the CID fuselage impact condition. The computer analysis of the event was structured to empha- size the determination of floor responses with the thought that those data could be useful in the formulation of dynamic performance standards for seats. For simplification, the impact was considered to be symmetrical. The magnitude of the lateral accelerations and the differences between the left and right side responses, along with some early unsymmetrical computer runs, indicated that a symmetrical analysis would be a satisfactory first approximation. The analyses we reQ performed for pitch atti- tudes ranging from 0 to 2 nose-down (range quoted in post-CID test review of data), at a sink speed of 14 ft/sec., and included the effects of the forces resulting from the engine impact prior to fuselage contact. The post-test correlation consisted of: comparisons of measured fuselage bending responses, lower fuselage crushing, and peak floor accelerations with the KRASH stick model results. KRASH stick model analysis results for the actual CID fuselage impact condition versus measured test results are shown in Figs. 23, 24, and 25 for the moment distribution, acceler- ations, and crush, respectively. The correla- tion between test and analysis illustrated in those figures was performed for the symmetrical impact onto the fuselage which incorporated the following initial conditions: • 14 ft/sec. sink speed • 262 ft/sec. ( 160 knots) longitudinal velocity (this parameter was not varied. A slight -variation from actual test conditions is not significant). • Pitch attitude -1 to -2 degrees (nose-down) • Ground coefficient of friction (M) =0.5 Figure 23.

Figure 24. Comparison of Post-Test CID Krash Analyses and Test Results For Fuselage Impact Bending bridge data were measured at six fuselage stations (forebody stations BS410, BS510, and BS600J-10 and aftbody stations BS1030, BS1130, and BS1250). The moment response data indicate that the fuselage fun- damental frequency response mode is approxi- mately 3.0 to 3.5 Hz and that structural damping is approximately seven percent of critical. As part of the correlation effort, the KRASH stick model frequency and damping characteristics were determined and compared to CID test measured bending moment data. The stick model's response frequency was found to be approximately 3 Hz and the structural damping is estimated to be ap- proximately eight percent of critical. This comparison indicates that the KRASH stick model contains stiffness, mass and damping properties consistent with the test article. The moment response time histories, at the six measured fuselage locations were also analyzed. The longitudinal acceleration levels are relatively low, which are in agreement with the test results. The correlation of the stick model analyses with test data, as might be expected, does not agree with all the test results. The aftbody down bending moments are higher than those measured; however, using the load interaction curve ratios the post-test ana- lytical results do not indicate that fuselage moments and shears will be sufficiently high enough to cause airframe failure, which is consistent with the test results. The predicted crushing of the fuselage aft of the main landing gear is probably more than experienced at impact. The more extensive aft fuselage crush prediction occurs toward the end of ground impact while the aircraft is settling to its final position and it does not influence the peak acceleration responses obtained in the analysis. Of interest to note is that the pretest CID model (mass, stiffness, damping, and crush char- acteristics) description was not significantly altered. The initial correlation effort concen- trated on determining the initial aerodynamic loading and impact attitude associated with the initial fuselage impact representative of the CID test. As part of the correlation effort a comparison between analysis and test is also being performed for the initial unsymmetrical impact on the No. 1 engine for the conditions noted in Table 6. TABLE 6.

The modeling described is a symmetrical representation of an unsymmetrical impact. Initial conditions, such as rotational velocity, rotational acceleration, and time-varying exter- nal loading, along with the sequence and the magnitude of the fuselage underside crush influ- ence the magnitude and phasing of the responses. POST CID TEST KRASH MODELING Additional analyses are still to be per- formed to evaluate the initial unsymmetrical impact on the engines, as well as the merits of using the expanded CID model. It appears that a stick model will give satisfactory information for overall motion, crush, strength, and airframe (floor) responses. Modeling of air- frame structure for a range of impact conditions is being initiated. The stick model could be used to develop an envelope of impact conditions (sink speed, pitch attitude, and aerodynamic loading) versus airframe response (acceleration, moment/ shear strength) , rather than emphasize the results of any particular impact condition. This is a current task element in the agency's crash dynamics program. Conceptually, the devel- opment of a crash design envelope will involve using the validated model to run a series of parameter (velocity, attitude) variation studies. As illustrated in Fig. 26, for a given airframe strength capability, the associated floor response acceleration and airframe veloc- ity change capability for a defined pitch attitude (or a floor acceleration and pitch attitude for a defined velocity change) might be derived.

Design Envelope Format 6.724</page><page sequence="16">Subsequent to defining a crash design envelope it may be desired to evaluate the fail- ure modes and dynamic behavior of specific structural elements such as engine/wing attach- ments, bulkheads and/or frames for different levels of impact. The stick model is not designed to provide detail element load and deflection behavior of those structural ele- ments. The expanded model, while potentially capable of predicting detail element behavior, requires that the analyst knows more about local nonlinear behavior. Data acquired from previous tests, which were conducted to define structural element deflection behavior, and analytical experience are both required to define an expanded model. The definition, application, and validation of expanded crash dynamic com- puter models are being considered for future research. INTERACTIVE VALIDATION TESTS The results of the full-scale fuselage sec- tion drop tests and the CID experiment indicate that those test conditions were within the enve- lope of survivable impact conditions. The cur- rent modeling efforts are tasked to define an envelope of survivable impact conditions by using validated models and extrapolating the airframe response data from the existing test impact conditions. To validate the means of analysis and the extrapolated data, some addi- tional full-scale fuselage section and airplane drop tests are planned. These impact tests are expected to provide data to help define the envelope of survivable impact conditions. CONCLUSION The FAA sponsored computer modeling devel- opment program for transport aircraft crash dynamics, aided by supporting section and full- scale crash test data, has shown significant progress. Digital computer program KRASH has been modified for application to transport category aircraft. Computer model simulations of full- scale fuselage section drop tests and an air- plane drop test have been correlated with the respective test data. Recent analysis compar- isons with CID test results provide encouraging signs that validation of analytical modeling of transport airplane impact scenarios is achievable. A seat/occupant model representative of transport category aircraft seats has been developed and validation efforts are being completed. Continuation of the agency's sponsored crash dynamic research efforts, both in model development and full-scale validation testing tasks, is continuing to demonstrate and achieve additional confidence in analytical modeling. The developed analytical methodology will be used to model various aircraft configurations and sizes to assure that the methodology can be satisfactorily applied to other configurations 851887 and new designs. The latter is of particular concern because of the potential increased usage of newer materials in aircraft design. The FAA' s crash dynamics program goal of developing crash design envelopes, based on air- plane capability and using analytical modeling, is being realized.
