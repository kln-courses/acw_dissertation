<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews 141 Margaret J. Kartomi. On Concepts and Classifications of Musical Instruments, Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press, 1990; bibliography, glossary, index; xix + 329 pages; $49.95 cloth, ISBN 0-226-42548-7, $21.95 paper, ISBN 0-226-42549-5. With this volume which launched the Chicago Studies in Ethnomusicology series (edited by Philip V. Bohlman and Bruno Nettl), Kartomi has provided us with an organological study which is conceptually original and methodologically useful. Concurrent with a move by American scholars to regard classification as a single (limited) branch of a multifaceted organology (see, e.g., de Vale's Issues in Organology (Selected Reports in Ethnomusicology VIII, Los Angeles: University of California, 1990), Kartomi focuses on this very branch. Her aim is not to search for the perfect classification system, however, but rather to look at the processes of classifying used in various historical periods and cultural contexts. One of the strongest features of this approach, in my view, is the fact that the principles of instrument classification in European-based ethnomusicological scholarship are embedded within this cross-cultural study, not positioned as a metalanguage. That is, Euro-American scholarship is viewed accurately as stemming from specific ethnic and historical contexts, and hence implicitly or explicitly comparable to other systems. Another strong feature is her close attention to the obvious fact that classification systems not only differ but change, and that these historical shifts are a priori to the search for the ideological bases of concepts and systems. Part 1, "One Nature of Classifications of Musical Instruments," present a rigorous framework for the culture-specific chapters which follow. Her terminology helps to clarify and distinguish approaches; she contrasts "upward" and "downward" systems, "observer-imposed" and "culture-emerging" systems, and she attempts a (vulnerable) distinction between "oral" and "literate" transmission. Her classificatory procedures involve careful definitions of "taxonomies" and "keys," "paradigms" and "typologies." She explains her choice of different graphics for each of these (e.g., tree diagrams for the linear logic of taxonomies; matrixes and mandalas for paradigms). In fact, the clarity and elegance of the graphics in this volume are altogether commendable. Parts 2 and 3 divide the particularistic studies into "Classification in Societies Oriented toward Literary Transmission"</page><page sequence="2">142 Asian Music, Fall/Winter 1992/1993 and "Classification in Societies Oriented toward Oral Transmission." The former category includes China, India and Sri Lanka, Tibet, Java, Ancient Greece, the Arab world, and Europe (three chapters which proceed chronologically). The latter section includes the Mandailing and Minangkabau of Sumatra, the T'boli of the Philippines, West Africa (mostly the Dan and Kpelle), the 'Are'are of the Solomon Islands, and the Finnish Karelians. While accepting the oral/literary dichotomy as defined primarily by Ruth Finnegan, she recognizes the problems of this division, observing that some instrument classifications, in Java for example, are transmitted orally, some literarily. This division of convenience could perhaps have been less vulnerable if she had represented it as a dialectic within specific cultures rather than a means of differentiating them. Another double-edged decision made by Kartomi is her choice to produce a single-authored book rather than an anthology of chapters by specialist authors. The consistency of approach and development of terminological and methodological positions is the advantage of such a choice, and these are very welcome within our field. Her own extensive fieldwork, especially in Indonesia where her most extensive research has been with the Minangkabau and Mandailing, provides a solid basis for a comparative study. Where she synthesizes secondary sources (e.g., Ellingson's work on Tibet, Leiso's on Finnish-Karelia, Zemp's on the 'Are'are and Dan, or Stone's on the Kpelle), she has in all cases invited critical comments from the source authors. There are, not unexpectedly, moments where my reading of the source authors' work is not entirely consistent with Kartomi's representation. She asserts, for example, that the Javanese place relatively little emphasis on cosmological associations in gamelan classifications, not citing work by Judith Becker (1988) or Sue Carole de Vale (1978, also 1989 and 1990 which were probably not available to Kartomi at the time of writing) which seems to present contrary evidence. The variety of classification schemes presented in this single volume are amazing both in their diversity and the complexity of their interrelationships. In some cases, the bases of the systems may be wellknown but the historical or regional shifts in adopting these bases may not be. Such is the case, for example, with the tenacious Chinese pa yin; the eightfold divisions according to material and the cosmological associations of these materials are better known than more recent classifications which cross-cut this basis with information</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 143 about playing techniques or morphology (such as the presence of keyboards). Similarly, for India and Sri Lanka, the Hindu division into stretched, covered, hollow, and solid instrument types, each with "limbs" (often referring to solo and accompanying functions) is better known than the Tamil, Buddhist (in Sri Lanka) and Jain variants. A tolerance for individuality is reflected in the diverse range of systems in some areas: within, for example, the Tibetan monastic tradition, she synthesizes Ellingson's representation of performance-oriented taxonomies, as well as others constructed on analogies to "peaceful" and "fierce" human behaviour, to cosmological connections, or to ethical effects; similarly, for Java she recounts both oral classifications based on playing techniques, sound characteristics (as in soft and loud) or spatial position in performance (front/back) as well as written accounts, both outsider-imposed (e.g., Kunst's identification of musical functions) and culture-emerging (Becker's translations of Martopangrawit's system or Sumarsam's paradigm of instruments which engage in melodic elaboration, mediation or relate to melodic obstraction). The wind/strings/percussion division is seen in its many European and middle Eastern guises in the next five chapters. This categorization has been embedded into different cultural matrices: as a subcategory of the Greek animate/inanimate distinction, for example. Furthermore, differences are apparent in hierarchical rankings, between, e.g., Arabic systems which emphasize the sustaining qualities of bowed strings and medieval European ones which priorize winds. Historical shifts from, e.g., al Kindi to al Farabi or from the speculative Medieval to the more practically oriented Renaissance theorists are summarized. In the chapter on 19th and 20th-century Europe, the focus shifts to ethnomusicologists and their precursors. The morphological emphases of most ethnomusicological classification systems contrast with many, though not all, of the culture-emerging systems. Kartomi gives a necessarily cursory account of a wide number of these by Mahillon, Galpin, Hornbostel and Sachs, Schaeffner, Norlind and Izikowitz, Drager, Reinhard, Montagu and Burton, Hood, Ramey, Malm, Heyde, Hartmann, Lund, Sakurai, Lysoff and Matson, and Mitani. Curiously, Wachsmann and Picken are ignored, perhaps because of their less-structuralist orientation. Her strongest praise goes to the "upward" system of Elschek and Stockmann, however, which she regards as the most likely model for organological studies of the future; since their German-language publications may be less widely known to North</page><page sequence="4">144 Asian Music, Fall/Winter 1992/1993 American students, this explanation of the approach is especially valuable for English speakers, whether or not one agrees with her prognosis. In Part 3, she explores "oral" classifications which she characterizes as more multivalent and less systematic than the ones described in Section Two. An important point in these chapters is her distinction between what is possible, given the vocabulary of various groups, as opposed to what is actually done. Hence the Mandailing have vocabulary for different methods of sound excitation, but the references they normally draw upon when distinguishing musical instruments are religious and philosophical: the symbolism reflects both cosmology and social organization (family, clan, village, and gender). The Minangkabau use historical strata (asli or authentic, Muslim or Arab, and Western) as a primary distinction, with manner of sound excitation, morphology, and musical function (especially leader/follower roles) as subsidiary criteria. She emphasizes here that regional differences require slightly different paradigms for every village. The T'boli, various West African societies, and the 'Are'are all emphasize distinctions between solo and ensemble functions among other things. The importance of mythical associations or personification (e.g., of instrument "owner") is also described for several of these groups. A somewhat different issue emerges in the final chapter in Section Three where she synthesizes Timmo Leiso's Finnish Karelian research; she examines his work on terminological inconsistencies -- in this case, the different applications of the terms pilli and torvi -- as a means of sorting out historical questions. In the final chapter, "The Seamless Web," the author makes a useful attempt to synthesize the many rich themes which emerged in her study. Some of these invite comparison with the several other new organological studies which have emerged within the past few years. (The organology theme volume of Selected Reports in Ethnomusicology is one noteworthy example.) In particular, the methods for investigating and representing classifications based on cosmology, anthropomorphism, social organization, and gender construction would bear comparison with work done in other contexts and in other societies. In summary, this book charts an important new direction in organology: one which looks at conceptual processes, one which charts the ideological underpinnings of what might seem to be dry</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews 145 classificatory structures, and one which examines the intertextuality of metaphor within specific cultural contexts. In contradistinction to several more "holistic" studies in organology which were published at about the same time as Kartomi's, her book focuses on classification, assuming that no perfect system exists (in Western scholarship or elsewhere), but that rather we need to develop greater clarity in naming and discussing various culturally positioned systems. While there are a few curious bibliographic omissions and some instances in which the reinterpretation of specific scholar's work raises questions, these do not detract from the fundamental contribution of this book.
