By JAMES MARTINEAU, D.D., LL.D., Principal of Manchester New College, London. 2 Vols. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1885. Pp. xxiv., 479; viii., 539. Criticism of this work, now just added to the other important con- tributions to ethical theory that have marked the last decade, will, it is hoped, not be deferred beyond the next No. It consists m-lore largely than any of those other works of direct historical appreciation, but includes. also (ii. 1-279) the systematic exposition of the author's own ethical doctrine. To this he gives the name " Idiopsychological Ethics," and the remainder of vol. ii. is occupied with criticism of "Hetero-psychological Theories" (divided into "HEedonist," "Dianioetic," "iEsthetic "). Before passing thuLs to " Psychological Ethics," he devotes vol. i. to " Unpsycho- logical Theories," distinguished as (1) "Metaphysical" (including the I' Transcendenital" theory of Plato and the "Inimanental" theories of Descartes, Malebranche and Spinoza), (2) " Physical " (typified in Comte); the whole scheme of treatment being first explained and justified in a short Introduction (pp. 1-22). The historical consideration in vol. i., it should be noted, goes a good way back from the special subject of ethics to general philosophy. The long chapter on Spinoza (pp. 234-369) is not a reproduction or abridgment of the author's monograph on that philosopher, " but a fresh statement . . . marked . . . only by such shifting- of emphasis as the special exigency of an ethical treatise demanded ". The Preface (vii.-xvii.) contains a singularly interesting account of the author's own philosophical development, as he passed fromu a state of "willing captivity" to Locke, Hartley &amp;c. to his present position-described at the end of the work as one of such affiniity to Kant, at least in respect of ethical theory, that Kant (by name) figures hardly at all in his pages. The generous terms in which J. S. Mill's persoinal influence is recognised are speciallv to be reimiarked. It is the author's design, if strength still remains to him in " the evening twilight of life " (as all must hope it will), to follow up his present work with another devoted to the theory of' Religion, with which, in his view, Ethics is organically connected. Dictionar,y of National Biography. Edited by LESLIE STEPHEN. Vol. I. (Abbadie-Anine.) London: Smith, Elder, 1885. Pp. vi., 474. The editor's name is a sufficient guLarantee that in this work of national importance due place will be accorded to philosophical writers. In the present volume, with which the great enterprise is in all respects, most worthily inaugurated, the philosophical names are few and not of much account: besides Alcuin and Alexander of Hales (treated by Prof. Adamson), with one or two other Scholastics, onily Abercrombie and Aldrich falling within it. It is intended to issue successive volumes at intervals of three months, and the whole work will, it is confidently expected, be completed in about fifty volumes. Ethica: or The Ethics of Reason. By SCOTus NOVANTICUS, Author of Metaphysica Nova et Vetusta. London: Williams &amp; Norgate, 1885. -Pp. viii., 195. This work is the complemen't of the a.uthor's previous essay reviewed in MIND XXXVI., 574-9, and will receive, in tuirni, the like considerationi-</page><page sequence="2">NEW BOOKS. 299 Basing upon his former results he now endeavours "to show that Will, containing in itself kinetic initiation and form of end, is mnetaphysically free and supersensible: that, while the aim of all science is the filling of the a priori categories, thereby to get for self-consciousness the idea of each thing as a harmonia rei, and ultimately as part of a harmoniac erum; so, in the ethical sphere, the aim is such a harmonia morum as shall com- plete the self-realisation of man". Of Philosophy in the Poets. By JAMES HlU.TCHISON STIRLING, LL.D. Edinburgh: Oliver &amp; Boyd, 1885. Pp. 46. The Community of Property: Nationalisation of Land. By the Same. Same Publishers. Pp. 40. The first of these pieces was delivered as opening lecture to the Edin- burgh University Philosophical Society in its present session, and is published by request. The author, assuming the alliance between poetry and philosophy, confines his remarks to English poets, and, dividinig theimi into three periods, again limits himself to the first two, ending respec- tively with Milton and Cowper. Startilng from Cowper he glances lightly at Beattie, Gray, Collins, Goldsmith, Armstrong, Akenside, Thomsoni, Young, Pope and Dryden in retrogression, and then in the first period, after a word on Chaucer and Spenser, enlarges upon Milton and Shake- speare. Milton (whom he regards as of all poets the most mlusical) gives him occasion for a very striking digression on the question of free-will (pp. 26-34). Shakespeare he declares, and after specimens *given of "philosophical pregnancies" re-declares, "the vastest subject that ever took into himself the whole huge object ". The other piece, before passing into an economic argument against Mr. George, incluides some pages of interesting reference to the philosopbical conceptions of property,' chiefly those of Aristotle and of Hegel, whom Dr. Stirling sets together above all other writers on politics or practical philosophy. The Veil of Isis: A Series of Essayqs on Idealism. By THOs. E. WEBB, LL.D., sometime Fellow of Trinity College ancd Professor of Moral Philosophy, now Regius Professor of Laws and Public Orator, in the University of Dublin. Dublin: Hodges, Figgis; London: Long- mans, 1885. Pp. xiii., 365. In this sketch of the history of modern speculation with reference to the external world, the author develops further the idea of his book on The Intellectualism of Locke. Locke's " intellectualism " was found especially in the distinction of external and internal sense, in the "ideas of relation" called by Locke " the creatures and inventions of the understanding," and in his view of necessary and dcemonstrative trutb. Dr. Webb now goes on to show that there is an element of intellectualism also in Hume, in Berkeley and in Bacon. Bacon's "anticipation of the mindc" and the "commoii principles" and "common ilotions" of his "first philosophy" are a foreshadowing of the Kantian doctrine ; the " transcendents" or " com- mon principles " are " the categories in an embryo state ". The "notions " of Berkeley are an intellectual element that has not been sufficiently recognised in his empirical idealism. Hume's Treatise is an anticipation at least in outline of everything in Kant's Kritik. The chief difference between Kant and Hume was that Hume " employed the sinmple language of ordinary men" while Kant "iinvented an artificial language for the schools ". Kant misunderstood Hume as Leibniz misrepresented Locke; for, although Hume rejected Locke's theory of the origin of ideas (in laying it down that "reason can never give rise to any original idea" such as</page><page sequence="3">300 NEW BOOKS. that of substance or cause), he accepted Locke's theory of knowledge (in recognising " ideas of relation " and especially in his view of mathematical proof). In his classification of relations Humie anticipated the deduction of the categories. "But if Hume Nwas the Copernicus of the new way of investigatingc, the phenomena of the niind, Kant mnust be regarded as its Newton." The final result of philosophical development is, that absolute certainity is unattainiable; the image of the veiled Isis described by Plutarch still renmains the svm)bol of the reality of things : we must therefore act on probabilities. This conclusion had already been reached by Hume when he said that his philosophical scepticism disappeared in practical life. Here there is agreement with the school of common-sense. Reid's insistence on the necessity of acting according to the natural view of the reality of objects was therefore superfluous as against Hume. On the speculative side the "natural realism" of Hamilton, equally with that of Reid, com-lpletely fails as an attempt to answer either Hume or Berkeley. Hume, while anticipating the philosophv of common-sense (and at the saimie time Kant's doctrine of the practical reason), carried out his speculative philosophy to the most consistent idealism possible. In saying that "the idea of existence is the very same with the idea of what we conceive to be existent," he unconsciously reproduces the con- clusion of Parmenides and anticipates Hegel. Social Ihistory of the Ra'ces of Mankind. First Division: 'Nigritians'. By A. FEATHERMAN. London: Trtibner, 1885. Pp. xxvi., 800. The fifth, but first-published, division (' Aranimans') of this extensive work, was noticed in MIND XXV., 143, just after its appearance in 1881. Now tllat the first has followed, the other four divisions of the author's scheme ('Melanesians,' ' Maranonians,' ' Turanians,' ' Iranians') may be expected at shorter intervals, for he states that he has six other volumes ready for the press and that the whole work nmay thus be comrpleted within three or four years. The industry shown by the author in collating the mass of literature bearing upon the seventy or more tribes which he distinguishes within the Nigritian stock--" the miiost anicient of all the types of nmankind," as he considers it-is truly astonishing. His account of the physical, mental and social characteristics of each is set out accord- ing to the same schemiie as he had einployed in his former volumne, but he gives the schemne now, in his present preface, the more explicit statement which before was wanting. Comparison is also aided by a very useful index. The autlhor wishes his work in its entiretv to be " considered as a miianual of Sociology-a science as yet non-existent, but which, it is hoped, some mlian of geniuLs will now be able to create with the elemnents here systematically arrani&lt;ged and placed at his disposal for judicious elabora- tion ". Here h-e appears to betray ignorance of the constructive work done by others of late years; nor, it m-riust be added, are his sources of infornia- tion, as to facts, always of as recent date as they might be. Phases of Opinion and Experience durivg a long Life. An Autobiography by CHARLES BRAY, Author of The Philosophy of Necessity, &amp;c. Lon- don: Longmans, Green. Pp. 284, ix. The author of The Philosophy of Necessity (1841, 2nd ed. 1861) died on the 5th October last at the age of 73. Three weeks before his death, and not expecting to survive above a month, he dictated a few sentences of striking "'Conclusion " to these autobiographical chapters, which he had lying, by him in printed form since 1882. An Appendix (pp. 207-84) is malde up of reflections and quotations on the topics that had interested him through life, jotted down from the beginning of 1884. The book</page><page sequence="4">NEW BOOKS. 301 is a curious medley, but contains passages that deserve reading for their honesty of thought and straightforward expression, and gives throughout a picture of fine cheery stoicism and beneficent helpfutlness in the man. An en-thusiastic phrenologist, while he dabbled in matters of philosophy, he was not able, as he tells us at p. 24, to think well of this Journal ; finding it (as some others do not) too "purely metaplhysical" ! Notes on Inductive Logic. (Book I.) Being an Introduction to Mill's Systerm of Logic. By THOMAS WOODHOUSE LEVIN, M.A., &amp;c. Can- bridge: Deighton, Bell. Pp. 150. Twelve Lectures in two Parts, following oln an introductory Historical Retrospect (pp. 1-19). Part i. gives " explanations of notions and ternis which were once specialised technicalities of logical science but which are now so interwoven with current modes of thought alnd expression that a familiarity with their meaning is an indispensable part of all literary training"; also some account of Syllogism. In Part ii. the author seeks by a "more accurate definition of the sphere of Causal Induction" to remove "the ambiguities and inconsistencies" attaching to Mill's other- wise " profoulnd and exhaustive treatment " of the Experimental Methods of Induction, which " constitute the rational procedure of all Experience and the Logic of Facts". In another publication to follow, he will deal with the causes and remedies of Intellectual Error, expanding the topic commonly discussed as Fallacies in the logical books. Sympneumata or Evolutionary Forces now active inm M1an. Edited by LAURENCE OLIPHANT. Edinburgh and London: Blackwood &amp; Sons, 1885. Pp. xiv., 288. Man: Fragments of Foryotten History. By Two Chelas in the Theo- sophical Society. Loiidon : Reeves &amp; Turner, 1885. Pp. xxviii., 165. These two works are of a class hardly to be reckoned with in a journal of such humble pretensions as MIND. In the first, Mr. Oliphant, " on the slope of Mount Carmel," takes down from the lips of an unnamed seer (or seeress) a revelation of the past and fuLiture of the race which goes far beyond any instruction that so-called history and science have been supposed to yield; and takes it down so faithfuilly withal that he has not in general thought it necessary to give literary form to the curiously per- plexed and cunibrous language of the deliverances. In the other volume, the two "Chelas" (or seekers after "Esoteric Doctrine," one of them Eastern and the other a Western-with the more florid fancy of the two) take down from their " Master" some better-written fragments of a storv which niakes the same claim to be the absolute and deepest truth about man, though it is not the same story. Not that the two revelations have not their points of contact: both, for example, have it that man was originally bisexual (though again they differ in their account of how the divarication came to pass). Sympneurrata is indeed mainly concerned with the problem of the recovery of the lost " biunity " ; each hulmian defective having now to find his or her sympneumatic complernent. When these disclosers of a verity not to be attained by the methods that pass as scientific can agree among themselves, they may have a stronger claim on the attention of those whose "science" certainly leaves them with plenty of ignorance. Both books have meanwhile the merit of indicating how great that ignorance may be. Philosophy and Faith: A Plea for Agnostic Belief. By JAMES M. HODGSON, D.Sc., Professor of Apologetics, Lancashire Independent College, Manchester. London: Sinlpkin, Marshall, 1885. Pp. 31. "The aim of this paper is, first, to inquire to what extent the contents</page><page sequence="5">302 NEW BOOKS. and objects of Religious Faith do or do not lie ' within the boundaries of possible knowledge,' and do or do not present ' the indispensable conditions of knowledge'; and, second, to indicate the imripossibility of surrendering that ' unqualified assurance' in which we revel respecting them, in spite of its condemlination by Scientists and Rational Philosophers as ' a belief void of justification'." Man's Destiny viewed in the Light of his Origin. By JOHN FISKE. London: Macmrillan, 1884. Pp. 121. A summary of the author's view of evolution, endincg with an expression of belief in the immortality of the soul, not as a scientifically demonstrable trtith, but as a faith withouLt which " the reasonableness of the universe " cannot " maintain its ground ". Evolution in man will henceforth restrict itself to psychical evolution ; hence no new species higher than man can be produced. The struggle for existence will aive place to " direct adaptation ". Man's life, beginning as life in the family, which was a con- sequence of the prolongation of infancy through increased psychical development, has gradually advanced from the predatory to the industrial stag,e, and will have reached its highest form when " the pacific principle of federalism " shall " reign supreme over all the earth ". Prolegomena of the History of Religions. By ALBERT RIILLE, D.D., Pro- fessor in the College de France, Paris, and Hibbert Lecturer for 1884. Translated from the French by A. S. SQUIRE. With an Introduction by Professor F. MAX MULLER. London: Williams &amp; Norgate, 1884. Pp. x., 230. M. Reville's Prolegomenac (the reproduction in a condeiised form of lectuires given at the College de France) are introduced to English readers by Prof. Max Muller as an example of the scientific study of religion on its only possible foundation, that of exact schlolarship. The anthropologists will, of course, maintain that their methods are as exact and scientific as those of the pure philologists ; but whatever view we may take of method, there is no doubt as to the importance of M. R6ville's book for all who *occllpy themselves with the science of religion. In Part i. the author's chief object is to remove from the path of research the obstacles that various a priori theories (philosophical and theological) of the origin of religion seem to him to oppose to scientific treatment. He discusses in Part ii. the common elements of the chief religions (" The Myth," "The Symbol and the Rite," "The Sacrifice "-cc. i.-iii.), the relations of "The Priesthood" and " Prophetism " (cc. iv.-v.), the nature of " Religious Authority" and " Theology " (cc. vi.-vii.), and finally the mutual influence of religion on the one hand, and philosophy, morality, art, civilisation and science on the other (cc. viii.-xii.). Religion is, for the author, the attempt *of the human mind to arrive at a synthesis including itself and the non-ego regarded as in its nature "spiritual," and as "mysterious". Hence, how- ever much religion may influence and be influenced by morality, the two never become identical; it differs at the same time from plhilosophy in being of emotional, not intellectual, origin. Beginning as a rude attempt at a synthesis of man and nature, springing from an emotional need, it had at first for its essential element sacrifice, by which union with the divinity was to be realised; in its final form it is the aspiration towards a complete ideal. The Wish to Believe. A Discussion concerning the Temper of Mind in which a Reasonable Maii should undertake Religious Inquiry. By WILFRID WARD. London: Kegan Paul, Trench, 1885. Pp. 225.</page><page sequence="6">NEW BOOKS; 303 In these dialogues a theorv which the autlhor tlhinks will appear at first somewhat paradoxical, is expounded and defended by "Father Wal- ton," one of two Catholic spokesmen who may be suipposed to represent his views. This theory is briefly as follows: There are three attitudes of mind in religious inquiry-the "superstitious attitude" of those who believe too liglhtly, the "law-court attitude " and the " religious attitude ". The superstitious man has not really " the wish to believe " but only the wish to indulge himself with imagining that some opinion which he wbuld like to be true may be really true ; he has no desire to submit his belief to the test of objective verification. The perfectly impartial man to whose emotions a religion makes no appeal is as much disqualified for religious inquiry as the superstitious man, but for a different reason. No one can bring all his critical power to bear on the evidence of the truth of any statement who has not either a strong practical or speculative interest in the result of the investigation. The scientific man, for example, who thinks he has discovered some new truth and has a strong desire that his opinion may turn out right, just for that reason examines the evidence with greater care; similarly, when an event is felt to be of great practical importance, men "dare not lightlv believe what they so much wish to be true". The proper attitude of mind for undertaking religious inquiry is therefore that of the " religious-minded man" who feels that a true belief is of practical importance to him, and who is attracted emotionally by a system that presents itself as capable of harmiionising the whole of his life. " Darlington," the agnostic of the dialogues, is led to see the force of these considerations, and, although not brouglht to the Catholic position, does not contest the application that is intended to be made of them to the proof of this position. Comnparative Physiology cand Psychology. A Discussion of the Evolution and Relations of the Mind and Body of Man and Animals. By S. V. CLEVENGER, M.D., Special P ?lllgil,i County Insane Asylum, Chicago, &amp;c. Chicago: Jansen, NIA1 i I i, 1885. Pp. 247. The present work consists of expositions of ideas already put forth in medical and scientific journals, and is prelimiinary to a work dealing more minutely with the psychology of man. The author has in view the scientific treatment of insanity. He writes entirelv from the physiological point of view and does not perceive its limitations; but if allowance be made for tlhis, much will be founid in his book that has value. The leading ideas have already appeared in biological speculation, but seem to be quite original so far as the author is concerned. He takes " hunger" to be the fundamental mode of feeling: this feeling is the subjective side of chemical affinity; when unsatisfied it is pain, when satisfied pleasure; all activity of organisms'is (directly or indirectly) due to desire of food or is overflow of energy after food has been taken; reproduction is at first merely a form of nutrition and must be explained all along by reference to nLutritive processes. The author's psychology is worked out with much consistency from this starting-point, and he is able to make many good observations incidentally. The evolution of life he views as determined entirely from Qutside; but more use isg made of the idea of " impacts," "stresses" and " strains " on the organism than of the idea of survival of the fittest. This is an indication of a partial return, such as may be perceived in other recent biological writing, to Lamarckian modes of thought. An in-k teresting suggestion that some anatomical peculiarities which are at present disadlvantageous to man are due to his imperfect adaptationi to the upright position, is partly worked out in c. 3.</page><page sequence="7">304 NEW BOOKS. The Literary Remains of the late HENRY JAMES. Edited with an Introduc- tion by WILLIAM JAMES. Boston: Osgood, 1885. Pp. 471. Prof. W. James has here added to the published works of his father, who died two years ago-(1) an autobiographic fragment written, as of and by another person, under the title " Immortal Life " (pp. 132-91); (2) "Spiritual Creation, and the necessary Implication of Nature in it: An Essay towards ascertaining the rdle of Evil in Divine Housekeeping," also unfinished (pp. 195-418). He further reprints (3) "Some Personal Re-, collections of Carlyle" (pp. 421-68), a very notable piece that appeared as a magazine-article on Carlyle's death in 1881 ; and, besides a "Biblio- graphy," gives in an "Introduction" (pp. 7-119) a view of his father's main ideas, illuistrated by a connected series of extracts from the previous works in which the ardent mystic had again and acrain struiggled to find utterance for them. There is astonishing power of expression in many of these, and the thought is weighty with philosophical implications which the editor has brought out with great skill. The Religious Aspect qf Philosophy. A Critique of the Bases of Conduct and of Faith. By JOSIAH ROYCE, Ph.D., Instructor in Philosophy in Harvard College. Boston: Houghton, Mifflin, 1885. Pp. xix., 484. Dr. Royce, who in Nos. XXIII.,and XXV. gave the readers of MIND specinmens of his philosophical style, marks out here the basis of a system of philosophy, while applying its principles to religious problems which first drove himn to speculative inquiry. The book appeals, in different parts of it, both to the general reader and to the special student, and is written throughout with a very notable freshness and vigour. It is reserved for more detailed notice later on. The author's genleral attitude is inidicated in the following sentences:-"While on tlie one hand he desires to trouble nobody with fruitless and blank negations, and while his aim is therefore on the whole a positive aim, yet on the other hand, as he has no present connexion with any visible religious body, and no sort of desire for any such connexion, he cannot be expected to write an apology for a popular creed. . . . As to the relation of this book to what is called modern doubt, it is a relation neither of blind obedience nor of unsympathetic rejection. The doctrine of philosophic idealism here pro- pounded is not what in these days is popularly called Agnosticism. Yet doubting everything is once for all a necessary element in the orgainism of philosophic reflection. What is here dwelt uponi over and over again is, however, the consideration that the doubts of our time are not to be apologetically ' refuted' in the old-fashioned sense, but that taken just as they are, fully and cordially received, they are upon analysis found to contain and imply a positive and important religious creed, bearing both upon conduct and upon reality ". Le nouveau Spiritualisme. Par E. VACHEROT, Membre de l'Institut. Paris: Hachette, 1884. Pp. xv., 400. The problem of philosophy is still, for M. Vacherot, the ontological problem which Kant excluded from the field of speculative reason as insoluble. In Part i. (pp. 1-148) he gives a historical sketch of the attempts that have been made since Kant to solve this problem. The theoretical discussion follows in Part ii. (pp. 149-334). In the con- cluding Part (pp. 335-400) the ideas of " fatal " and of " final " evolution areB combined into one doctrine from the point of view there attained. "The school of speculation " (Fichte, Schelling, Hegel) tried to solve the problem of the nournenon by the dialectical method; "the school of reason" (the Eclectics) and "the school of tradition" by the assumption of principles</page><page sequence="8">NEW BOOKS. 305 from theology and common sense; but it is not to be riglhtly solved except by " the school of consciotusness ". "The new spiritualism " differs froi the older spirituialism of the Eclectics in taking up into itself the resuLlts of science ancl in rejecting Cousin's doctriine of " the impersonal reason," which, as M. Vacherot points out, was merely common sense placed -as an authoirity over science and philosophy. That which is common to the new andI the old spiritualism as distinguished both from materialism. and idealism is the "psychological metllod ". Idealism and materialism, in their search for real causes, arrive at principles that have similar defects: materialism tries to explain things by their simplest elemeiits ; idealism by the last results of abstraction. The philosophers who have come nearest to the true solution are Aristotle and Leibniz: Aristotle in the doctrine that reality is to be sought not in the bare abstract possibility of " matter " but in the concrete " act " which expresses itself in conscious- niess ; Leibniz in the doctrine that the inner nature of things consists in determination by final and not by mechanical causes. Modern science has reduced matter to force, and as seen from within, that is, from the point of view of consciousness, which reveals to us the nature of all reality in revealing to us our own nature, force becomes a free cause seeking an end; matter therefore is to be explained as " the minimum of spirit," not spirit as "the mcximtum of matter ". In order to get rid of the artificiality of the systems of Leibniz and Aristotle, we miiust add to these conceptions Spinoza's conception of unity. But the doctrine of " divine immanence " thus arrived at is to be discriminated from Spinoza's pantheism as well as from the doctrine of " divine transcendence "'; God creates otlier free beings fromi which, as from the world, he is " distinct " but not " separate ". The author takes occasion to explain miiore fully a part of his doctrine that has sometimes been misunderstood and that he admits to be open to objection at least as regards the form. Rejecting all the pretended denmon- strations that perfection implies existence, he holds on the contrary that perfection-conformity to an ideal-is incompatible with real existence; it is the conception of infinity, the opposite of that of perfection, which implies reality: the world is infinite, God is the supreme ideal. He now explains that the idea of God is not to be confouinded with the abstract idea of perfection, which is merely the conception of something perfect in its kind. The idea of the absolute-the true idea of God-implying the maximum of reality cannot be submitted to the limitations of any con- ception of the perfect (in the category of quality) any more than it can be identified with the conception of the immeasurable (in the category of quantity). The essential constituents of our idea of the absolute are the " free causation " and " finality " which we find in ourselves ; these in the absolute become " creative power " and " providence ". The process whicl to science, looking at it froin outside, is "fatal evolution," seen from within, from the point of view of consciousness, is a "final evolution" towards the ideal good. Le ons de Philosophie. Par ]LIE RABIER, Professeur de Philosophie au Lycee Charlemagne, Membre du Conseil superieur de l'Instruction publique. I. Psychologie. Paris: Hachette, 1884. Pp. 676. This is a book in whi-ch may be studied to great advantage the effect of later scientific work upon an open-minded representative of the traditional spiritualism of the French school. By Philosophy he understands, in combination, " the psychological " and the "metaphysical sciences " which remain after the widest enumeration of the objective sciences (" cosmolo- gical " or natural and " zoological " or moral); and, contending, according to the later French tradition, for the priority of psychological over ontological 20</page><page sequence="9">306 NEW BOOKS. consideration in the philosophical field, he works out the doctrine, of Psychology in his present first volume. With Psychology itself, Logic and Ethic are classed as the specially " psychological sciences," and we are left to suppose that in the author's scheme of publication these two " regula- tive" doctrines will follow next, before he passes to Metaphysic proper (disposed in the olcl threefold fashion of Rational Cosmology, Psychology anid Theology); no account, apparently, being taken of the right of -Esthetic to rank on a level with Logic and Ethic. The " Psychology," filling all but 20 introductory pp. in the volume, is set out in five books of "General Problems," "Intelligence," "Sensibility," "Will," "Special Problems ". Of these "Intellioence" (with Sense in its representative aspect) occupies considerably more than half the whole volume ; included as there is, in the treatment of the "properly intellectual functions" of elaborative thought, all that kind of discussion as to fundamental prin- ciples which it is now more usual, and surely more satisfactory, to relegate from Psychology to philosophical 'Theory of Knowledge'. Here, how- ever, as elsewhere, while standing in the main by the accepted (or, as they have been called, official) tenets of the French school, the author shows no little receptiveness to the ideas of opposed thinkers, especially English, or at least is always prepared with a reasoned judgment on their counter positions. The result is a work full of instruction, disposed with good method. The books on Feeling and Will, as they are more per- functory, are also of less scientific value. Under "General Problems" (pp. 21-88) falls, besides the question of psychological method, the dis- cussion of the notion of Consciousness. " Special Problems " (pp. 571-672) include the topics of Habit, Language, Beauty and Art (by way of AEsthetic, otherwise shelved), Sleep, &amp;c., Mind in Animals. iqtudes facmilieres de Psychologie et de Morale. Par FRANCISQuE BOUILLIER, Membre de l'Institut. Paris: Hachette, 1884. Pp. iii., 315. Five studies, popular in style but containing many interesting psycho- logical observations. The general results of the first three are-that since dreams take their character in part from past thoughts and actions there is a kind of " moral responsibility in dreams," hence an effort to remember dreams on waking may be useful as a means of moral culture (i.) ; that "the sentiments of the living with regard to the dead" including the "' involuntary admiration for suicide " may all be traced to love of life (ii.) ; that sympathy decreases with distance in time and space and is therefore favoured by increased facility of communication, but has always existed in man and as an emotion remains constant (iii.). An interesting feature of the fourth study (" The Compensations in Human Life") is the account of three optimistic moralists, Robinet (praised by Hegel in his History of Philosophy), An-toine de la Salle and Azais, the second of whom would seem to have been undeservedly neglected by historians. In the last study (" On Time in Common Speech ") expressions in which time is personified and illusions of time are discussed. Etudes psychologiques. Par IVAN SETCH1ENOFF. Traduites du Russe par VICTOR DERELY. Avee une Introduction de M. G. WYROUBOFF. Paris: Reinwald, 1884. Pp. xv., 274. This translation of the work of a Russian psychologist is introduced to French readers by M. Wyrouboff as a consistent attempt to treat psychology in what he regards as the only scientific way, that is, as " cerebral physiology ". The author begins by a study of muscular movements, ,voluntary and involuntary. Having reduced all movement to reflex</page><page sequence="10">NEW BOOKS. 307 action modified by the influence of ' inhibitory' ancl ' augmenting' centres he applies this result of his analysis of the "known" terms of mental processes (that is, those that are known on their objective side) to the "unknown" terms (that is, the conscious part of the process). He finds that consciousness as well as movement can be reduced to the tvpe of reflex action. The two chapters on "The Reflex Actions of the Brain" (Pt. i.) are followed by three containing " General Notions on the Study of Psychology" (Pt. ii.): of these the first two cleal with the question of method; the third is a sketch of the " History of Psychical Evolution " (in the individual). The criticism on his work is made to some extent by the -author himself when he admits that there are many " lacunme " in his system, and that it is in great part hypothetical; this criticism is carried further by M. Wyrouboff. Although it is applied to the results only and not to the imiethod, the author's admission that the "cerebral physiologist" must seek his facts in subjective psychology may be taken as a concession on this point also. Les lMaladies de lct Personnalite. Par TEr. RIBOT, Directeur de la Revue Philosophique. Paris: F. Alcan, 1885. Pp. 174. Mi. Ribot here continues his studies in mental pathology with the aim of throwing light on normal psychological processes. From Memory and Will as thus treated before (see MIND XXIV., 590-2, XXXIII., 141-4), he now passes to the central problem of the consciousness of Personality; stating the psychological question in an Introduction (pp. 1-21); following his pathological inquiry through four chapters-" Organic Disturbances," "Emotional Disturbances," "Intellectual Disturbances," "Dissolution of Personality "; and summing up results in a Conclusion (pp. 151-71).

After pointing out the historical importance of Zeno, the autllor dis- cusses his four arguments against motion as given by Aristotle, taking them in an order which is the reverse of Aristotle's, under the designations of "the Stadium," "the Arrow," "Achilles" and "Dichotomy". The first he dismisses briefly as being of no value. He gives some space to the refutation of " the Arrow " and " Achilles "; the exact meaning of the text of Aristotle, the explanations of the commentators andi the views of others who have attempted a refutation of these arguments or have regarded them as irrefutable being also discussed. By the argument of "Dichotomy" (which he states as follows, partly translating from Aristotle and partly giving his own interpretation :-" There is no motion, because the moving body must pass over the half of its course before reaching the end," and similarly if we divide the first half of the whole space, and the half of this, and so on continually), he holds that Zeno really proved the impossibility of motion as a thing-in-itself. The arguments of " Achilles " ancl " the Arrow" are intended to show that the existence of motion as representation and of time and space as real things being respectively granted, motion still cannot be rationially conceived; but they do not prove this. Motion as a phenomenon is not in contradiction with itself; the difficulty begins *hen we consider it as a noumenon. It was in the Kantian criticism that the problem of " Dichotomy " first found its solution, viz., that motion, being simply a representation given in the forms of space and time, cannot be treated as absolute.</page><page sequence="11">308 NEW BOOKS. Histoire des Sciences et des Savants depuis deux Siecles, prec'dJe et suivie d' autres Etudes sur des Sujets scientifiques, en particulier sur l'JIeredite' et la Silection dans l'Espe'ce humaine. Par ALPHONSE DE CANDOLLE, Associe 6tranger de l'Acaddmie des Sciences de Paris, &amp;c. Deuxieme Edition considdrablement augmentee. Geneve-Bale: Georg, 1885. Pp. xvi., 594. This new edition of the Histoire des Sciences et des Sacvants, appearing after an interval of twelve years from the publication of the first, is Inot only augmented but entirely rearranged. An initroduction written in advocacy of the doctrine of natural selection is now suppressed as being no longer necessary. Instead of this the chapters on Observation and on the Statistical Method have been collected and placed at the beginning of the book. All other alterations consist in additions. Of these the most important is Ch. iv., Section 2,-" New Researches on Heredity" (pp. 54- 103). The author points out a difference between his choice of material for these researches and Mr. Galton's in English Men of Science: he has selected not eminent men but the persons he has known best, without any reference to their merit or capacity. He starts with a scheme of classification of physical, intellectual and moral characteristics in which a name is given to each virtue and defect ; all " average characters " and " acquired characters" being eliminated as of no value for determining the special influence of heredity. The characters of any individual and those of other menmbers of his family (ancestors and collateral relations) being kinown, the percentage of characters inherited and of variations may be estimated: with more material, statistical grounds for attributing characters to atavism might be given; but such attribution at present remains conjectural. By this method the author holds that the existence of lheredity of special characters (as distinguished from common racial characters) is established, and even that an estimate may be made bv its aid of the numerical pro- portion of the eharacters inherited from each parent. He has applied it to members of his own family (three generations) and to 31 other persons belongiing to 16 different families (two generations). In a later part of the book he makes use of it to draw a comparison between his father (A.-P. de Candolle) and tllree other eminent naturalists, Cuvier, Linnaeus and Darwin. He finds that in the case of De Candolle and Cuvier their extra- ordinary memory was a variation; the power of generalisation seems to have been a variation in every case: there is always, however, the pos- sibility of atavism. All the author's researches, these later ones as well as the earlier ones, have been carried out not so much with a view to deter- mining the origin of individual characters of men of science as with a view to determining the influenlce of the social conditions of different countries ; and this he takes to be the essential distinction of his aim from Mr. Galton's. For this purpose, though not for determining as accurately as possible the relative influence of "' nature " and " nurture," he believes his own earlier method (carried out furtlher in the present edition), of making statistical tables of the nominations of foreign members of learned societies during as long a period as possible, to be the best. The general result of his earlier and later researches is to show that scientific success is the result of a combination of intellectunal and moral qualities obtained by inheri- tance and variation, together witlh favourable external circumiistances (education, example, influence of the social environment), rather thaln of a special faculty. He is not disposed to attach much importance to those innate tastes for a special branch of science on which many of Mr. Galton's correspondents insist. At the same time the facts seem to him to prove that there is usually in men of science a hereditary bias either to the mathematical and physical or to the natural history sciences ; partial</page><page sequence="12">NEW BOOKS. 309 heredity of a special faculty is also found to exist in the case of mathe- matics as of music. For success in the arts and in active life heredity is more important than the influences that follow; for success in a scientific career the influences that follow are the nmore important (p. 530). The ilnheritance of a complex civilisation seermis to be ofi more iinportance for tbt, successful cultivation of the moral sciences than of the physical and natLural history sciences; small countries have not the advantage in moral science that they seem to have in natural science. Several new paragraphs are added relating to the influence of instruction oIn originality. Taking Mr. Galton's researches as his evi(lence, the author finds that mnen of science have got more advantage from freedorn and leisure than from systenmatic instruction, and that "diversity of schools," such as exists in England, is favourable to originality. He discusses the influence of the diffused interest in science which results from the action of "nomad societies" this lie thinks on the whole good. "The slow and costly actions of governments are not worth the zealous and disinterested impulse of the public." Above all things a social atnmosphere favourable to scientific stiidies is required in order that progress may be made. La Dottrinca Kantiana dell' A Priori. Stu-dio critico del Dott. GIOVANNI CESCA, Prof. di Filosofia nel R. Liceo di Acireale. Verona, Padova: Druicker e Tedesclhi, 1885. Pp. 279. L'Origine del Principio di Causalitd. Bv the Same. Same Publishers, 1885. Pp. 67. After discussing the chief positions of the Kritik and the arguments of Kantians and their opponents, the author, in the first of these works, con- eludes that the only real " a priori form " is the synthetic unity of apper- ception; this is found in the process of " integration and differentiation of states of consciousness " by which each state is " associated instantaneously and automatically with its class, order and variety". The forms of intui- tion are a priori for the individual but not for the race; relations between states of consciousness are not imposed by the mind on material given in sensibility, but are derived from real relations between objects there is no absolute opposition between sensibility and intellect, and therefore no need for a third faculty of imagination to mediate between them. The question of the a priori or a posteriori character of form was treated bv Kant entirely as one of logic ; his neglect of psychology prevented him from solving the question of origin which comes before that of validity. There are no synthetic juLdgments a priori; mathematical axioms have their origin in experience, as is shown both otherwise and by the possi- bility of non-Euclidian geonmetry. The author follows up his discussion of the Kantian doctrine generally by a special study of the principle of causality. He finds in this principle three eleiients, (1) instinctive tendency, (2) notion of cause, (3) application of this notion to phenomena, and assigns to each of the three schools that have tried to solve the problemii of causation the merit of having brought out one of these elements clearly. The notion of cause itself was correctly explained by the Scottish school as derived from the relation of will to movement; the application to phenomena was seen by the English ex- periential school to be immediately suggested by experiences of succession; while the a priori school was able to prove the presence of the element of instinctive tendency. This element, however, is not strictly a priori, but is derived from primitive anthropomorphism. The validity of the law of causation is proved by the impossibility of explaining the course of nature without it: the fact of change proves that it is objectively valid, that there is something in the matter of phenomena corresponding to our experience</page><page sequence="13">310 NEW BOOKS. of activity; for if the causal nexus were simply a form imposed by the subject, we should explain by means of it all relations between phenomena, not merely those of succession. Genesi della Filosofta morale contemporanea. Per GIACINTO FONTANA. Milano: Fratelli Dumolard, 1885. Pp. 222. Experiential ethics, even as " ennobled by Fouillee and Spencer, the con- temporary representatives of the positive school," does not answer to the true conception of morality (cc. i., ii.). The ethics of German transcen- dentalism, which substitutes for the " objective " conception of morals one which is " subjective and purely rational," leads to consequences similar to those that flow froin " positivism " ; for the result of the development from Kant to Hegel as well as to Schopenhauer and Hartmann is (like the result of the " positive doctrines ") monism and the denial of free-will (cc. iii., iv.). It is in Spinoza, whose thought was the outcome of all the scientific ten- dencies of the period before him, and whose presence is felt at every point in the development of later philosophy, that the origin of modern ethics finds its logical explanation (c. v.). The only means of escape from the fatal " practical consequences of contemporary moral systems " is a return to dualism and indeterminism (c. vi.). Physiologie des Rechts. Von Dr. S. STRICKER, Professor an der Universitat in Wien. Wien: Toeplitz &amp; Deuticke, 1884. Pp. x., 144. After treating psychology from the physiological point of view in previous works already noticed in MIND, Professor Stricker now goes on to investigate legal conceptions on the basis of results already gained. These results are summarised by him in Part i. (pp. 1-59, "Die Vernuift und das Gefiihl "); his theory of law and its origin is developed in Part ii. (pp. 60-116, " Recht und Gesetz "); in Part iii. (pp. 117-144, "Strafe und Entschuldigung") it is made the foundation of a theory of punishment with special reference to " moral insanity". Here, as he hinmself points out, he returns to his own subject of pathology, from which he mav have seemed to hold himself aloof in his psychological studies. The parts of his general theory that should be called to mind in relation to his treatinent of law are that his physio- logical doctrine is on its psychological side a theory of association anld that in his explanations of details he lays stress on " internal experience " (i.e., experience of activity). He maintains that the idea of " right " which is the basis of law has its origin (both in the individual and the race) in the feeling of power given in experience of muscular activity and in the feeling of restraint of this power by the power of others; sympathy has some influence in promoting its development: on the intellectual side it has its origin in agreements or contracts (Vertrage). Ideas derived from past experience of contracts, like a11 other ideas, have a certain normal mode of association. When this is disturbed there is a sense of wrolg. "Moral insanity " is distinguished from actual criininality by the absence (in the morally insane) of a persistent plan of life carried out in opposition to the laws; this difference justifies a different view of punishment in relation to ordinary criminals and to the morally insane. The autlhor refers to Hume as having discussed before him the question whether the sense of justice has its origin in reason or in feeling, and as having arrived at analogous conclusions. His own investigations of morality and law, however, were not suggested by Hume but by Darwin. Grundlagen emner Erkenntnisstheoi-ie. Von Dr. RICHARD VON SCHUBERT- SOLDERN. Privat-Docent an der Universitat Leipzig. Leipzig: Fues (R. Reisland), 1884. Pp. 349. In theory of knowledge the author sees the means of transforming</page><page sequence="14">NEW BOOKS. 311 philosophy from " art "-the art of supplying defects of proved certainty by imagination-into science. He discusses, in six sections, "Problem of Transcendent Kinowledge," "Concept and Thing," "The Conception of Truth and Logic," "Causality," "Space and Time," "Perception and Representation". All doctrines of a "transcendent object" are to be rejected. An important part in the explanation of belief in such an object outside consciousness -is assigned to the fact that we become aware of the existence in other minds of objects resembling those in our own mind. The unity of the mind may be expressed in two ways, either as "the abstract ego " or " the concrete ego the concrete ego is the organic feeling (Gemeingefiihl) to which all particular feelings are related at any moment; the abstract ego is merely the expression of the fact that each feeling or reproduction of a feeling can be brought into relation with all the rest. Besides the point of view of the theory of knowledge there are two others (subordinate to it) from which the world may be regarded ; that of psycho- logy and that of natural science. Natural science deals with the world as perception (Wahrnehmung), psychology with the world as representation (Vorstellung).. Peiception cannot be treated as a perfectly independent thing any more than representation; as representation presupposes im- mediate experience, so perception presupposes reproduction of experience ; withLout memory no form of experience is possible. In conclusion the author expresses the conviction that there can be no definitive theory of knowledge; any true theory of knowledge must advance along with the special sciences. Literarische Fehden im, vierten Jahrhu??dert vor Christus. Von GUSTAV TEICHMULLER, ordentlichem Professor der Philosophie in Dorpat. I. Chronologie der Platonischen Dialoge der ersten Periode. Plato antwortet in den " Gesetzen " auf die Angriffe des Aristoteles. Der Panathenaikus des Isokrates. II. Zu Platon's Schriften, Leben tind Lehre. Die Dialoge des Simon. Breslau: Koebner, 1881, 1884. Pp. xv., 310; xviii., 390. The centre of interest in these volumes is the author's discussion of the Platonic Dialogues in the light of his new view of Plato's doctrine and his new critical method. This method,-which gives its title to the book,-consists in investigation of the " literary quarrels " of Plato and his contemporaries as a means of fixing more accurately the chronology of the Dialogues. In the a1ithor's view, it has been too much the habit of former critics to regard each Dialogue as an artistic whole composed without reference to the circumstances of the time and without alny external incitement. The presence of Socrates in the Dialogues has, besides, caused them to be inter- preted as if they belonged to the fifth century. In reality we have to do always with Plato and his contemporaries; and we must remember that Plato was n"ot primarily an artist but a philosopher, and a philosopher who aimed at havino practical influelnce on his age. It is therefore likely that the Dialogues often had their immediate cause in literary works of the time expressing doctrines opposed to Plato's, or even written as attacks' on him. Among his literary rivals were, for example, Antisthenes with his circle (Euthydemus, Lysias) and Isocrates. Comparison of other writings of the' period with thos9 of Plato from this point of view, accompanied by study of contemporary events as causes that might determine the composi- tion of particular Dialogues, is an instrument of research that has hitherto been neglected. Those who emplov this method will note all indications of Plato's personal life in the Dialogues, and will treat the literature of Anecdotes and Epistles in a not too sceptical spirit. Besides having a true conception of method, the student of Plato must lhave a conception of his</page><page sequence="15">312 NEW BOOKS. doctrine as a whole, and a point of view of his own from wllich to criticise as well as interpret it. In Mr. Benn's Greek Philosophers, Prof. Teich- muiller sees evidence that others have independently come to take the broader historical view of Plato which he advocates. He replies in- cidentally (in vol. ii.) to Mr. Benn's arguments against his explanation of the doctrine of the imimoitality of the soul as taught in the Phaedo. Con- sistently with his "pantheistic interpretation of Plato," he still holds that the doctrine of personal immortality had for Plato only the value of those myths whose meaning he approved of: in Plato himself immortality mneans permlanence of the intelligible element of the soul; and he does not a(dmit the transcendent isolation of this any nlore than of the sensible element. The central doctrine of Plato's whole system is that of peOfE'tv, union of being with becoming; being, or the ideal element, cannot exist apart from the flux of things: the older critics have not seen that this is implied in what is commonly taught as to Plato's combination of the doctrine of the Eleatics with that of Heraclitus. The author applies his newi method to fixing the chronology of Aristotle as well as of Plato. He claims to have shown that in the Laws Plato replied to Aristotle's criticisms in the Nicomachean Ethics; that indeed passages from Aristotle are actually quoted in the Laws. As the Thecetetts is a fixed point for determining the chronology of Plato, so the Laqws will become a fixed point for determining the chronology of Aristotle. Geschichte des gelehrten Unterric7ts auf den deutschen Schulen und Universitdten vom Ausganig des Mittelalters bis zur Gegenwart. Mit besonderer Riick- sicbt aut den klassischen Ulnterricht. Von Dr. FRIEDRICH PAULSEN, a. o. Professor an der Universitat zu Berlin. Leipzig: Veit, 1885. Pp. xvi., 811. The parts of Raumer's Pcedagogik and of the Encyclopcedia of Schmid which deal historically with learned education in Germany being incom- plete, especially as regards the Universities, Dr. Paulsen, well-known by hls work on the historical development of Kant's theory of knowledge (1875), has devoted himself to filling up the blank that was thus left in literature. The present work is divided into three Books dealing respec- tively witlh the shaping of learned instruction under the influence of " the first humanism" and the Reformation (1500-1600); the changes during the period of Rationalism and Pietism (1600-1805); and lastly, " the time of the new humanism ". In Bk. i., c. 1., a brief sketch is given of education in tlle Middle Ages. The author's own view as regards the future-im- portant as coming from so distinguished a member of the Berlin philo- sophical faculty-is that the classical training given in tthe Gymnasia must be very much restricted. The power of reading Latin will always remain essential ; but classical education in the older sense will become a specialty of philologists. Not matllematics and natural science, but Gernman (with other modern languages) and philosophy, are to replace it. Modern culture, although having its origin and its basis in ancient culture, first as continued in the Middle Ages by the Church, afterwards as redis- covered in its earlier and typical form by the Renaissance, has now become an independent culture, itself capable of affording all the materials for a complete education. As a means of bringing about the changes he desires Dr. Paulsen does not propose new examinations, but rather the suppression of some of the present ones. He thinks it unfortunate, however, that no preliminary philosophical instruction should be given in the Gymnasium: for at present, through its postponement to the University, those who do i1ot make a specialty of philosophy hardly come in contact witlh it at all; the specialisation of "the philosophical faculty" (the old "faculty of arts"),</page><page sequence="16">NEW BOOKS. 313 of which philosophy, properly so called, is only a branch co-ordinate with the natural sciences, philology, &amp;c., being now complete. This change in the position of philosophy, no longer obligatory even on non-professional students at the University, and yet absent from the Gymnasium,-a change which was not conmpletely effected till the present century (the Renaissance having left philosophical instruction almost where it was in the Middle Ages),-is explained by the author as due in part to the less fitness of modern philosophy as compared with the scholastic philosophy for being taught by text-books, and to its division (since Kant) into schools. His own opinion, however, is that the difficulties in the way of making philosophical training -a part of all high education can be surmounted. Kant's Dinge-an-sich und sein Erfahrungsbegriff. Eine Untersuchung von M. W. DROBISCH. Hamburg and Leipzig: Leopold Voss, 1885. Pp. V.) 53. Kant's intention in his doctrine of thinTc-in-themselves was to make his theory of knowledge independent of flie q(iie-,iiw as to their reality. The conception of the thing-in-itself is a limiting conception, not an affirmation -of the real existence of a noumenal world. The application in the theo- retical philosophy of the category of causality to things-in-themselves is to be explained by the distinction between thinking (Denken) and knowing *(Erkennen); the thing-in-itself is " thouight," but not " known," as a cause. Through his mode of affirining this limiting conception, Kant, in his doctrine -of experience, came very near "subjective idealism "-the derivation of the matter as well as the form of knowledge from an activity of the subject. -The author contends that, for the categories to be applied to experience at -all, not only the "matter" but "the determinate form of objects of ex- perience " must already be "given ". In restoring the "realistic" element which Kant tended (in consequence of his mode of statement) to suppress, he -trusts that, although "an old Herbartian," he is not interpreting Kant from .an external point of view, but correcting his doctrine in the sense in which lie himself would have desired to correct it. Das Endergebniss der Schopenhauer'schen Philosophie in seiner Uebereinstim- mung mit einer der dltesten Religionen dargestellt. Von Dr. DAVID ASHER. Leipzig: Arnoldische Bucbhandlung, 1885. Pp. 100. The author is already known as an enthusiastic advocate of Schopen- hauer's philosophy, who, however, declines to accept pessimisnm as a deduc- tion from the doctrine of Will. He here puts forth an idea which he had -arrived at tllirtv years since but has not hitherto published, viz., that the central doctrine of Judaism in its earliest form,-which he takes to be that of the Pentateuch,-is identical witlh Schopelihauer's doctrine of " the will to live" ; the God of Moses being essentially the principle of life, and being .always concived as a will. It is shown how the idea of life as the essence of things was developed by the Jewish philosophers of the Middle Ages, and especially by Avicebron in the celebrated Fons Vitce. In dealing with the ethical applications of this idea, Dr. Asher recapitulates the proofs that not only in the Mosaic books, but in the other books of the Bible, and also in the Rabbinical writings, length alnd fulness of life are represented as the ;reward of good action: by " life " being nieant life on earth, since neither the Pentateuch nor any book of the Old Testament teaches the doctrine of immortality. Although a Jew by race, the author is not himself an ad- herent of orthodox Judaism, and his work is addressed only to those who have rejected Jewish and Christian theology. One object of his book is to protest against Schopenhauer's antipathy to Judaism, which he ascribes, -with Schopenhauer himself, to its optimistic chlaracter. Dr. Asher</page><page sequence="17">314 NEW BOOKS. would reconcile religion and philosophy bv not admitting a permanent. distinction between philosophy and religion in any sense; we are to look forward to a time when action proceeding from a reasoned view of things will be possible for all and not mierely for philosophers. His view is essentially that of "evolutionist ethics"-that life is in itself good, and that life and increase of life should be imiade the end of effort both for the individtual and the communitv. Die Sprcache als Kunst. Von GUSTAV GERBER. Zweite Auflage, Erste- Fiinfte Lieferungen. Berlin: Gaertner, 1884, 5. Pp. 561. Die Sprcache und das Erkennen. Von GUSTAV GERBER. Berlin: Gaertner, 1884. Pp. 336. The second of these works carries farther the general view of speech -that was given in the earlier one, half of which has now reappeared in a second edition issued by parts. Speech as a product of " naive art"' by'whicb ideas of objects are conveyed from one mind to another, is distinguished from " natural sounds," that is, mere signs of emotion, such as are used by animals. Words, however, taking their character in part from the feelings of those who create them, do not reproduce actual things, but transform the real world into an ideal world. Having once been created by the free- activity of individuals, speech reacts on the individual through the race,. and becomes knowledge-a knowledge which is comrilon to all. The sentence (Der Satz), not in its grammatical form but in its form as root (Sprachrwurzel), is the first product of the creative activity of man express- ing itself in speech. -Here knowledge is alreadv implied; man has placed hirnself in a " theoretical " relation to objects. Speech itself gives the iia- pulse to strive after a more exact knowledge of the world as it is, to make the sentence-the element of speech-a judgment expressing the trutlh of things. From first to last the character of speech as art is stamped on our knowledge. " It is speech that manifests the essence of man in relation to the universe." The general result of the author's criticism of knowledge from this point of view is that the categories of knowledge for the speech of the individual are the representatioln (1) of the empirical ego, (2) of movement in time and space, (3) of the relation of cause and effect; expressed in (1) the subject, (2) the predicate, (3) the copula. These categories are to be taken in the sense of Kant ratlier than of Aristotle ; for although Aristotle's as well as Kant's deduction of the categories has its roots in speech, Aristotle's deduction was from isolated words, while Kant's was from the judgment as expressed in the sentence. From the de- duction of the categories (cc. i.-iv.) the author goes on to consider speech as a social prodaLet (c. v.). Having so far treated it as a product of the activity of the individual and the race under the influence of external things, he next proceeds to consider it as at the same time a product of the activity of the subject passipg outwards (c. vi.). Kant's distinction between Wahrneh- murngsurtheile and Erfahrungsurtheile then leads to a closer consideration of the copula in the two kinds of judgment (c. vii.), Finally a summary of results is given and doctrines of the ego, especially those of Kant, Fichte and Schopenhauer, are discussed in the light of the author's view (c. viii.)_ Ueber tragische Schuld und Siihne. Ein Beitrag zur Geschichte der .Esthetik des Dramas. Von Dr. JULIUS GOEBEL. Berlin: Duncker (C. Heymons), 1884. Pp. 108. The true conception of "tragic guilt" is not to be found in the Greek drama, but first appeared in Shakespeare; although we must not expect. to find it so consciously present to the mind of " the naive Homer of the modern drama" as to the mind of "the philosopher of tlhe nineteenth century". The ancient dramatists never got rid of the idea of an inexplicable</page><page sequence="18">NEW BOOKS. 315 fate ; but in order that there should be real individual guilt the hero of the drama must be conceived as possessed of free-will and as trying to affirm his own personality against the moral order of the world. The conception of tragic guilt is therefore not, strictly speaking, Teutonic, for the idea of an inexplicable fate is present in the earliest German as well as Greek legends; it is rather a Christian conception. The author traces its gradual appearance first in the "speculative Tsthetic " of Solger, Hegel, Vischer, &amp;c., the results being confirnmed by "' die empirische Shakespeare-forschung"; then in the classical writers of Germany (Lessing, the " Sturm und Drang" period, Herder, Goethe and Schiller); finally he criticises in an appendix the vesthetic doctrines of Schopenhauer and his more recent disciples.
