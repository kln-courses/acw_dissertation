Stud. 12, pp. 59-80 JOHN FERGUSON Dean and Director of Studies in Arts, The Open University THE ACHIEVEMENT OF CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA' CHRIST AND CULTURE In his masterly book Christ and Culture H. Richard Niebuhr2 identified five main attitudes which Christians have taken towards secular culture. The first emphasizes the opposition between Christ and culture. In the New Testament it is best seen in Revelation (where it is complicated by a situation of persecution) and in the First Epistle of John. But it appears in its most radical form in Tertullian, though even he is not wholly consistent. Men are under illusions from their very culture (Apol. 2i). Graeco-Roman society was shot through and through with what Tertullian regarded as superstition and idolatry, as well as immorality. So Tertullian repudiated political life, military service, many aspects of commerce, philosophy and the arts (apart from the amount of literary training needed for expression). The second attitude acknowledges a fundamental agreement between Christ and culture. Jesus is a human hero, his teachings are the summit of human achievement, he and all that he stood for are an integral part of human culture. Among contemporaries of Clement Niebuhr sees this attitude in the Gnostics, Valentinus and Basilides. He claims that they were accommo dating Christ to the culture of their day. This is clearly an oversimplification, though a suggestive one. Niebuhr is on stronger ground when he looks at later figures such as (in their different ways) Thomas Jefferson and Albert Ritschl. The third attitude Niebuhr calls synthetic. It is 'Christ above culture'. Christ is seen as the fulfilment of cultural aspirations, at once continuous and discontinuous with the culture that has gone before. The latter does indeed lead men towards Christ, but it needs a leap before they can reach him. Christ thus does not stand against culture, but he is equally not swallowed up by culture. The greatest of all the synthesists was Thomas Aquinas. The fourth attitude sees Christ and cultural life in polarity and tension; Niebuhr entitles his chapter 'Christ and Culture in Paradox'. This is a dualist view, but not a dualist view of the Manichaean type or the type which I should myself be inclined to attribute to the Gnostic heretics. Rather, man I Paper given in a shortened form to the Classical Association at Lancaster in April 1973. 2 H. Richard Niebuhr, Christ and Culture (New York, I195 I).</page><page sequence="2">6o JOHN FERGUSON lives in two worlds and has responsibilities to both. Something of this view may be seen in Paul. Niebuhr's inclusion of Marcion at this point is not helpful. There is a strong element of it in Augustine. Its supreme representative is Luther, though Paul, Augustine and Luther are all too complex to be easily categorized and pigeonholed. The final attitude is conversionist; Christ is seen as the transformer of culture. Human nature is fallen or perverted, and this perversion extends to culture and society. But 'there is no nature without culture and no turning of men from self and idols to God save in society'. So Christ converts man in his culture. Augustine and Calvin are the great exponents of this view. In this debate Clement of Alexandria clearly belongs to the third group. Clement holds that a Christian must first be a good man by normal cultural standards - but he must go beyond that. He accepts much Stoic ethics and pursues their ideal of non-attachment and impassivity beyond the point where it would seem to accord with the New Testament. But the Stoic ethic, though not contrary to Christian love, is not identical with it. The response to the Love of God revealed in Christ lies in love towards God and the neighbour, and this is the coping-stone of the gospel; it is a tutor to lead the Greeks to Christ. But it is not Christ. It offers a partial truth, not the whole truth. Clement is a Hellenist, not a humanist. Clement's answer is relevant today. Throughout the third world Christians are asking about the relationship between their indigenous culture and their Christian faith. The older missionaries tended to take the first attitude (though we should remember Carey's work in preserving Hindu culture). The more politically minded converts have sometimes tended to the second and effectively subordinated Christ to their own culture. Many, very many, are in the fourth position whether they recognize it or not; they are living in tension. But there are some who think that the most fruitful position is either the third or the fifth. Clement speaks directly to their condition. GREEK PHILOSOPHY Christianity was born within Judaism, but within Hellenistic Judaism. It is arrant nonsense for some theologians to suggest that true Christianity belongs to a pure Hebraic strain, and Hellenism is an impure accretion. Greek influence was there from the first, not least in 'Galilee of the Gentiles' where Greek was freely spoken by the common people. The New Testament was written in Greek, and is dependent upon Greek categories of thought. The omelette is not to be unscrambled.' None the less it was in the second century that the matter was consciously faced. Justin dared to describe Socrates and Heraclitus as Christians before Christ (Apol. 46). At Alexandria, the great metropolis of the eastern Medi 1 J. Ferguson, 'Athens and Jerusalem', Religious Studies 8 (1972), 1-13.</page><page sequence="3">THE ACHIEVEMENT OF CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA 6I terranean, a miniature cosmos, Philo and others had integrated Jewish and Greek thought. Pantaenus and Clement did the same for Christian thought. Clement's position is clear. The Spirit of God was not confined to the Jews, but worked in the history of Greece and Rome. Philosophy was to the Greeks what the Torah was to the Jews, a covenant with God, a tutor to lead them to Christ. The essential passage (Str. I,5,28) is this: 'Before the coming of the Lord philosophy was necessary to lead the Greeks to righteousness, and it is still useful in drawing them nearer to the worship of God ... God is the origin of all good things... including philosophy.' Socrates, Plato, Pythagoras and Cleanthes were citizens of heaven, as much as Moses or Aaron. Philosophy is an attendant on true wisdom, a preparation for faith, not indispensable, but very useful (Str. I,20,99). Clement is particularly interesting on the origin of Greek philosophy, as Salvatore Lilla has recently reminded us.' He has four answers to the question of origins. The first is that they are derived from a common human insight, itself the gift of God. The second is that they are the result of direct inspiration from the Logos; in his capacity as Generative Reason (a Stoic term) he sows seeds. Similar views to these are found both in Justin and Philo. The third, to which Clement frequently recurs, and which is also found in Justin and Philo, is that Greek philosophy was plagiarized from the Old Testament. Lilla has greatly enlightened our understanding by the reasoned suggestion that this is a counterblast to the Platonist Celsus's work The True Word, which alleged the opposite dependence in criticism ofJustin. This excellent theory solves two problems: Why was it so long between Celsus's prosecution and Origen's defence? and Why is Clement so preoccupied with this view of the derivation of Greek Philosophy? The fourth view is that philosophy was stolen from God by angels and transmitted to men. It should be clear that in Clement's mind these theories were not mutually exclusive. Clement's philosophy is eclectic; he says himself that he accepts anything which serves right living and religious knowledge. It has even been suggested (by E. Molland), on the basis of a slightly later reference in Gregory Thau maturgus, that it was the practice of the catechetical school to sift through passages from the different schools with a view to finding the best.2 Plainly Clement has his preferences. Plato and Pythagoras receive his highest praise. He is primarily a Platonist, but, like Cicero before him, tends to turn to the Stoics for his ethics: he even suggests that Christ and the apostles were Stoic sages with Stoic incapacity of feeling anything (Str. 6,9,7I). But he has a solid knowledge of Aristotle and of the Pre-Platonics. He tends to dismiss the Epicureans for irreligion, but no one of his period wholly escapes Epicurean influence, and his doctrine of simplicity is close to that of Epicurus; he will 1 S.R.A.

Molland, The Conception of the Gospel in Alexandrian Theology (Oslo, 1938).</page><page sequence="4">62 JOHN FERGUSON quote Epicurus or Aristippus with approval on occasion. J. B. Mayor made an interesting analysis of the philosophical technical terms in the seventh book of Miscellanies. In round terms nearly half of them are Stoic, about 28 per cent Platonic, about 2I per cent Aristotelian, and there are a couple from Heraclitus and the Pythagoreans.' E. F. Osborn has usefully identified some of the main elements which Clement derived from the schools.2 From Plato: the vision of God, and the doctrine of likeness to God, and the idea of contemplation; the identification of virtue with knowledge, the need for self-knowledge, the need for virtue and for training for virtue; the idea of the harmony of the parts of the soul. From Aristotle: the ideas of end, purpose, function, measure, mean and right reason. From the Stoics: the doctrine of Providence, and of action in con formity with nature; the Logos; the ethical system and all its technical trappings; the cult of freedom from passion. Salvatore Lilla in a major study3 has questioned Clement's eclecticism, and has suggested that it arises out of an eclecticism already present in Middle Platonism, which Clement swallowed whole. Clement's philosophy was, according to this view, pure Middle Platonism (which was itself impure). Clement's originality lay in bringing together Middle Platonism, Alexandrian Judaism, and Gnosticism in the service of his Christian faith (Lilla at times forgets this last!). Lilla has made a very persuasive case for the fact that such eclecticism was already found in Middle Platonism in precisely those areas where we find it in Clement, and we know from Porphyry (V. Plot. I4) that Plotinus later made the practice of studying Stoic, Aristotelian and Platonist works. But Lilla does not make enough of the likelihood that Clement would follow just this practice; he plays down too much Clement's explicit state ments of his own eclecticism. I see Clement very much as a Platonist in a correlative branch with Numenius (who blended Plato with Pythagoras), and standing in the line of succession, though not the direct line, between Albinus and Plotinus. Clement's general attitude to Greek philosophy may be summarized by a couple of quotations. 'There is only one river of truth, but a lot of streams disgorge their waters into it' (Str. 1,5,29). 'Like the burning-glass, its power of kindling is derived from the sun' (Str. 6, I 7, I49). THE MYSTERY RELIGIONS A mystery religion is literally one which has a secret (normally the secret of salvation) divulged only to initiates. The best-known were the Eleusinian Mysteries of Demeter and the Maid, where the culmination for the initiate 1 F. J. H. Hort and J. B.

Lilla, OP. cit.</page><page sequence="5">THE ACHIEVEMENT OF CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA 63 was a vision or spectacle, and there was a promise of blessing beyond the grave, but there were many other cults, most of them imported from Asia. They supplemented the public or political religions, and the philosophical or intellectual religions, by offering a personal hope. The language of the Mysteries is found in the Greek Old Testament (e.g. Dan. 2: 29; Wisd. 12: 5), and is particularly prominent in the New Testament letters. Paul speaks of the secret disclosed to God's people (Col. I: 26 cf. Eph. 3: 3-5). In the second letter attributed to Peter the Christians are said to have seen the vision or spectacle of Christ's majesty (II Pet. I:I 6); the author of Hebrews applies the technical term of 'enlightenment' to baptism (Heb. 6: 4). So this was well embedded in the Christian tradition. Clement likewise sees and speaks of Christianity as a mystery religion. The words for mystery, vision or spectacle, illumination, full membership, purification, sealing, guide, hierophant, and others, are continually on his pen. The actual word 'mystery' appears 9I times in his writings. In over a third of these the reference is to the pagan mysteries. In the majority of the remainder his point of reference is explicitly or primarily scriptural. But he has his own use of the language. The mystery is the foundation of the Christian religion, the secret of God's redemptive design, which may be discerned alike in the creation (Str. 3,I7,102) and in the Incarnation (Protr. I I, I II; Paed. 3,I,I; QDS 37), and is revealed in Christ. The mysteries are secrets, esoteric truth, revealed to the saved. How far this refers to the sacraments remains a matter of some controversy. At least once baptism seems clearly to be treated as a mystery (Paed. I,6,26-8), for although the word itself does not appear, all the other technical language is there. It is hard not to think that the Eucharist is similarly intended among the Christian mysteries (e.g. Str. 4,22). The culmination is the vision or spectacle. But whereas in the Eleusinian and other mysteries the phrase was literally intended, Clement uses it metaphorically and symbolically. So, in the widest sense, the Christian mysteries include doctrine. The Teacher educates the true Gnostic by means of mysteries (Str. 7,2,6); in fact instruction comes from the whole mystical chorus of truth (Str. 7,7,45). TRUTH Mondesert has spoken of 'Clement's audacious optimism, his confidence in the power and authority of truth'." This sums up the matter admirably. Clement does believe that truth will out: magna est veritas et praevalebit. Truth is of divine origin, revealed by the Logos, expressed in the scriptures, handed down in the traditions of the church. Truth is thus single and simple, authoritative, unconquerable and impossible to overthrow (Str. 7,I5-8). Truth is one, and errors are many, whether in the several schools of Hellenistic philosophy or among the Christian heresies. At the same time 1 E. Mondesert, Climent d'Alexandrie (Paris, I944).</page><page sequence="6">64 JOHN FERGUSON Clement does not deny truth to the philosophical schools. He blames them for imagining that a partial truth is the whole truth. Truth, though one, thus has many parts. But though arithmetic or geometry has its own truth, this is in some sense distinct from the truth revealed to the perfect Gnostic. Christianity is for Clement the true philosophy, precisely because truth and the divine Logos are one (Str. I,5), as Jesus says 'I am the Truth' (John I4: 6). ALLEGORICAL INTERPRETATION Clement's principal tool in harmonizing difficult passages of scripture with his general philosophy of life is allegorical interpretation. Allegorical interpre tation has a long history, as Jonathan Tate did more than anyone else to remind us.' It was for example Anaxagoras who claimed that Homer's sole theme was virtue, and his disciple Metrodorus who actually said that Homer's gods and heroes did not exist, but Agamemnon was the aether, Achilles the sun, Helen the earth, Paris the air, and so on. Plato carries this on; he dis tinguishes between the narrative and its moral, and the allegorical meaning. But Plato threw Homer out of his city. The Stoics wanted to keep Homer; it was as simple as that; and so they had recourse to allegorizing the awkward passages. The very word 'allegory' has been traced back to Cleanthes in the third century B.C. (fr. 66), but this is not certain; it was familiar in Alexandria by the first century B.C. Heraclitus's Quaestiones Homericae is a good example of the Stoic approach. Athene pulling Achilles's hair is taken (very properly) as a vivid expression of Achilles's psychological state of mind (1 7), and the story of the gods binding Zeus is interpreted of the cosmic interaction of air and water (2if.). Heraclitus has a straightforward definition of allegory: it 'says one thing and means another'. Quintilian called it a 'sustained metaphor' (8,6,44; 8,2,4I). The corresponding verb is found in Paul (Gal. 4: 24) and frequently in Philo. There is some allegorical interpretation already in the Old Testament. Hosea (I2: 4) implies that Jacob's struggle with the angel was a struggle in prayer, and Micah (7: 20) takes Abraham as a type of kindness and Jacob (oddly) of truth. Further, there grew up a group known as the Dorshe Reshumot devoted to the identification of symbols in scripture, and the Dorshe Hamurot interpreted anthropomorphic passages spiritually and looked for higher morality behind the literal meaning. This development originated in Pales tine, but it was naturally fostered in the Dispersion, where the Jews were not living in the political community of the Torah, so naturally sought spiritual meaning in the precious words of what was intended as civil and criminal law. Foremost among these was Philo. Philo is important as a precursor of Clement. He claimed that he stood in 1 J. Tate, 'The beginnings of Greek allegory', Classical Review 41 (1927), 214ff.; 'Plato and allegorical interpretation', Classical Quarterly 23 (1929), 145ff.; 24 (1930), Iff.</page><page sequence="7">THE ACHIEVEMENT OF CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA 65 line with the Essenes (Q. Omn. Prob. Lib. 82) and the Therapeutae (De V. Cont. 28). Philo's basic principle is that there is nothing superfluous in scripture. All is inspired, all significant, so that each word must be scrutinized, and each detail sucked dry for meaning. For Philo this is a liberation from bondage to the letter; his Allegorising of the Laws in three books shows how he came to terms with the Torah. Similarly, he will not allow the Fall to be treated as a myth; but it does require allegorical interpretation. Philo has little or no typology, though this was a common position in the interpretation of the Jewish scriptures, but he does look for different levels of interpretation, psychological, moral and spiritual. Clement declares that 'The Logos loves concealment'. The fifth book of Miscellanies is an exposition of this. He does not scorn the literal meaning; this will speak to the simple; but the Christian Gnostic needs to see deeper. So the land of Egypt may typify the snares of vice (Str. 2,I0), or the bucking bronco the turbulence of passion. Lot's wife serves as a sharp seasoning for those with powers of spiritual perception (Str. 2,I4). Sometimes the literal meaning is abandoned altogether. A passage from the Psalms (44: IO and I4), which in fact extols fine clothing, is used in an attack on fine clothing, so that the robe becomes the cloak of faith upon the church, the gold is Jesus, and the gilded tassels the elect (Paed. 2,10,IIO). Similarly Joseph's coat of many colours (Gen. 37: 3) is identified with the long robe of the son of man in Revelation (I: 13), and its ornaments are the flowers of wisdom, the unfading scriptures, the pronouncements of the Lord glowing with the rays of truth (Paed. 2,IO,II3). Even the Ten Commandments are given symbolical interpretations; it is adultery to hold a false opinion about God, and theft to attribute to the stars what really belongs to God (Str. 6,I6). Or again, the number ten is sacred. Hence the Ten Commandments, and the first letter of Jesus's name in Greek, which also stands for ten. Man has ten faculties, body, soul, five senses, speech, reproduction and intellect or spirit. The universe has nine divisions, the region of the four elements, the regions of the sun and moon and five planets, the region of the fixed stars - and in the tenth we reach the perfect number and the knowledge of God. Hence tithing; and the fact that the feast of the Passover begins on the tenth day (Str. 2,II,5I; 6,I6). Seven is another mystical number which Clement explores in relation to the Sabbath (Str. 6,I6). Clement never really expounds his system of allegorical interpretation; it is not clear from his usage that he has a system; his principles are vague and inconsistent. It is possible that he treated the matter systematically in the lost On First Principles. He has, however, a theory of symbolism. He gives a number of reasons for veiling the truth in symbols. It arouses a spirit of enquiry; it means that those who are not ready for the naked truth are kept from false ideas, and that the truth is revealed to those who approach in the right way; it directs us towards an interpreter; it even means that the truth appears 3 RES I2</page><page sequence="8">66 JOHN FERGUSON more brilliant as in a reflection; further, teaching about God can only be done through symbols (Str. 5,9; 6,I5). Symbolism is universal, and part of the universal revelation by the Logos. Clement owes an immediate debt to Philo, but he is not slavishly dependent on him. He speaks as if there were a secret tradition within the church whereby the allegorical method was passed from one generation to the next, from Christ to the apostles, and from the apostles to Barnabas. The main factors in Clement's treatment are, first, that he takes the inspiration of scripture for granted, and therefore (we might almost say) allegorical interpretation is indispensable: secondly, that he does not use allegorical interpretation to undermine the literal meaning, and has, for example, a far firmer grasp of the historical Incarnation than his successor Origen; thirdly, and almost consequentially, that he does not allegorize the New Testament events; fourthly, that his use is positive not negative, and its value for him lies not in the evasion of awkward passages (though he occasionally moves in that direction, e.g. Paed. 2,4,; Str. 3,15), but in its ability to bring together the biblical events with a philosophical system, so that Lilla is able to examine his treatment of some biblical passages and claim that 'in each case a determinate philosophical doctrine provides him with the clue which enables him to lift the veil of allegory which keeps the true meaning of the sacred text hidden to the many'; and fifthly, that throughout his interpretations ideas are allowed to interact in a constructive and fruitful way. Clement points the way to Origen.1 Origen uses allegorical interpretation at once more freely and more systematically than Clement. Origen identifies three layers of meaning in scripture: the literal, the moral or psychic, and the intellectual or spiritual. For example in the episode of the two blind beggars healed by Jesus at Jericho (Matt. 20: 29-34), the literal meaning is to be found in the actual historical occurrence; the moral or psychic meaning is that the eyes of our mind need to be opened by the Logos; the intellectual or spiritual interpretation identifies the two beggars as Israel and Judah, and Jericho as the world. This triple scheme is not to be found in any conscious analysis in Philo or Clement. Clement is pragmatic rather than doctrinaire in his allegorical interpretations, and it is on the whole a healthier attitude. In general R. H. Snape's comment 'The home of Christian allegory was Alexandria' is amply justified. WORDS AND IMAGES Allegorical interpretation depends on the assumption that there is a pattern in the universe, and that if you cut through the universe at different points, you will find the same pattern - rather as the Greeks, playing with mathe matical forms, came up with conic sections including the one we call the 1 R. P. Hanson, Allegory and Event (London, I959).</page><page sequence="9">THE ACHIEVEMENT OF CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA 67 ellipse, and centuries later Kepler discovered that this was the basic pattern of the movement of planets round the sun. In allegorical interpretation you take an event or story or whatever it may be, and show that it has the same pattern as a philosophical theory or religious dogma. In imagery the process is reversed: the theory (or whatever is being presented) is illustrated by an event, story or object which reveals the same pattern. Clement regards a parable as an extended metaphor: there is a sense in which a metaphor is a contracted parable. Clement's use of imagery is particularly rich. He is fond of images from navigation. These were particularly relevant at Alexandria; they sprang naturally to Clement's pen, and would be immediately familiar to his readers. But they also indicate a sense that life is a journey: not just like a journey, but that the pattern displayed in the movement of a body on earth and of a soul to heaven are the same pattern at different points. The same may be said of Clement's musical imagery - there is a magnificent extended example at the beginning of The Exhortation, but the idea of the symphony or harmony of all things recurs. The new song of the Lord made a melodious composition out of the universe, with the Holy Spirit providing musical accompaniment. This is almost literally meant, for had not Pythagoras spoken of the music of the spheres? Music and mathematics, harmony and proportion, are parts of the same pattern, wherever in the universe it is found. Again, animal imagery belongs to the same framework of thought as typology: there is no essential difference between saying that Abraham is the type of faith and that the wolf is the type of rapacity. Yet again, Clement is fond of speaking of the need for spiritual healing; he calls Christ the 'doctor'. Here too we have the idea that the life of the body and the life of the soul must reveal similar patterns. Images from athletics belong to the same thought-world. So with agriculture, which gives cross-references both to sex and to the spreading of the Gospel. Here the cross-section is at three points - nature, man's physical self, man's spiritual self: the pattern is the same. Light is another image with many functions to serve: we may notice its use in speaking of God (Exc. ex scr. proph. 21); of the illumination in baptism (Paed. I,6); or the splendid bon mot 'Works follow knowledge as the shadow follows the body' (Str. 7,I3). Or consider the remarkable treatment of moral evil towards the beginning of The Tutor (Paed. I,8): it is disease, mutiny, political factious ness, the over-luxuriance of a vine, a musical instrument out of tune. It would be possible to pursue this theme at great length. The central point is that similes, metaphors and images in Clement are not, or not only, literary commonplaces; they are not, or not only, teaching devices designed to clarify the obscure by reference to the familiar; they express a philosophy of life. In a slightly different way this applies to his wordplay, his most blatant literary device. Steneker has examined this in The Exhortation.' I have 1 H. Steneker, ffc&amp;OoDs &amp;llutovpyia (Nijmegen, I967). 3-2</page><page sequence="10">68 JOHN FERGUSON indifferently used 'pun' and 'wordplay' to describe this device. But, on the whole, the punster uses accidental similarities between words to suggest a non-existent and grotesquely incongruous identity between the things they represent. Clement's wordplay is not of this kind. He is constantly looking for verbal bridges to express an actual but hidden identity. This is why his best wordplay comes when a single word has extended its basic meaning in various directions, and this is not really a pun at all. Good examples are logos (word, reason, etc.), pneuma (wind, breath, spirit), daemon (pagan god, evil spirit), eidolon (wraith, idol), hypocrites (interpreter, hypocrite), kyrios (authoritative, the Lord). But even where his bridges are to us tenuous gossamer fantasies, as in the swift succession of the derivation of Apollo from a-polloi (not many) and the pun, genuine this time, between dia batou (through the bush) and di' abatou (through the desert), Clement is almost certainly not aware that he is violating language. The Epicureans, whose theories of language were highly influential, holding a natural theory of the origins of language, were almost bound to hold that resemblances between words must be expressions of resemblances between things. Roman Epicureans associated the common element between lIGNum (wood) and IGNis (fire) with the natural capacity of wood for use as fuel. So Clement feels that in finding bridges of language he is expressing bridges which exist in reality. All this of course comes from a philosophy of life which sees the whole universe ordered by the Logos, and this means ordered not merely for rational understanding with logical patterns, but for discourse. A PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGIOUS LANGUAGE? In recent years there has been an increasing interest in religious language. The insistence of the positivists on the verification principle has made us aware that if religious discourse has any place at all, and is not mere nonsense, it is of a different nature altogether from statements which can be verified through the use of the senses. To put it differently: 'God is Love' is not a sentence of the same kind as 'This print is black'. Clement has an unusually profound awareness of this situation. In the first place, he insists that we cannot speak of God as he is; we can speak only out of our own experience, and recognize that the truth is far greater than we can speak or think (Str. 2,I6). He is not to be expressed in words (Str. 5,12). There is all the difference between speaking God and speaking about God (Str. 6,I7,I 50). He is not even to be thought - what thought could match God's real worth? (Exc. ex scr. proph. 2I). But we can speak about God; we can treat of his accidents though not of his essence. (Even here we are in difficulties: can we apply the term 'accidents' to God?) When we use terms such as One, or the Good, or Intelligence, or Absolute Being, or Father, or God, or Creator, or Lord, we are not really naming him; we are</page><page sequence="11">THE ACHIEVEMENT OF CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA 69 giving the mind some support; we are preventing it from moving in wrong directions (Str. 5,I2,82). Clement does not however say that God is quali tatively other than our experience, and could not by his philosophy say so. We may think of One- and then go beyond that (Paed. I,8,7 I). We may think of light, magnify it to supreme beauty and power - and go beyond that (Exc. ex scr. proph. 2I). We may think of personality - and go beyond that. We may think of the greatest thing our mind can envisage - and go beyond that (Str. 2, I 6). We may think of being itself, substance, reality - and go beyond that. We may think of the world we know, then think of its objects in the perfection of the Platonic Forms - and go beyond them. But Clement's philosophy does involve the possibility of making analogical statements about God. This is implicit in the scriptural assertion that man is made in God's image. It is implicit in the Christian sense that man's life takes value from its relation to God. It is implicit in such assertions as that the Logos is God, that the Logos is the perfect image of God, that the Logos is the Creator-Craftsman who gives the world its order, that the Logos is Reason. This has as its consequence some kind of analogy between God, man who is the image of God, the world-order, and all that can be apprehended by reason. The image of Flatland may here be used,' and Clement, though not highly mathematical, might have appreciated it, as his admired Plato undoubtedly would. A two-dimensional world can experience the action of a three dimensional object. Thus if its plane were crossed by a sphere a two-dimension observer would see a point, widening circles, narrowing circles, a point and then nothing. Just so, the world can experience, Clement might say, the work of God, and give an account of this in its own terms. And it can by analogy give a limited account of what it means to be a being of a different dimension. But it can't identify with such a being - at least not by its own wisdom. Clement says that human beings can experience such an identification: this is gnosis, knowledge: it is the gift of God: and it is not to be expressed in words. At one point Clement says that essential discourse is to say 'God is the Lord of all' (Str. 6,17). It is impossible in a brief compass to do more than touch on this pregnant utterance. In the first place it is plainly not a statement which is verifiable in sense-perception; we can think of no conceivable evidence available through the senses to prove it or disprove it. In the second place Clement does intend it as an existential assertion. 'God is ' is in some sense an existential assertion, though not in the same sense as 'I am'. In the third place (the word Kyrios 'Lord' has for us some ambiguity) it is intended as a kind of analogy from (say) 'The father is responsible for the generation of the child' or 'The emperor bears the authority for the well being of the state' to 'God is responsible for, and bears the authority for the well-being of, everything'. In the fourth place it is an account of the ground 1 Flatland: a Romance of Many Dimensions, by A. Square (London, 1884); C. H. Hinton, An Episode of Flatland (London, 1907).</page><page sequence="12">70 JOHN FERGUSON value-judgements. In the fifth place it is a statement of personal commitment 'Wherefore I bow the knee. . .' (Eph. 3: I 4) which might take a very different grammatical form 'My Lord and my God!' (John 20: 29). In the sixth place it is an imperative 'Bow the knee!'. Each of these six lines might be followed up in an attempt to analyse the nature of religious language. GOD God is one, and beyond one (Paed. I,8,71). As we strip away the attributes of all solid things we are left with unity and position. Strip away position and unity is left (Str. 5,II). But this is not enough. God is not one as unity, but one as being all, the circle of all powers (Str. 4,25,I56). The language is close to being pantheistic, but Clement does not intend it as such. God is self existent, indivisible, infinite, ineffable. As we have just seen, we ascribe names to him - One, Good, Mind, Existence, Father, God, Creator, Lord, but our language is finite, and can do no more than direct the mind; it cannot describe God (Str. 5, I 2,82). We can speak only out of our own experi ence; we cannot speak of God as he is (Str. 2,I5). Much of this is in accord with the best Platonic philosophy of the day: it looks back to the Middle Platonism of Maximus of Tyre (I 43, I i) and Albinus (IO,5), and forward to the Neo-Platonism of Plotinus (5,3,I7). Plotinus's One is beyond being and beyond thought, without form, neither in motion nor at rest, everywhere and yet nowhere, inexpressible. But Plotinus goes beyond Clement in attributing to the One life, consciousness and even perception; Clement is clearer than Plotinus that these are not descriptions but symbols. Clement goes beyond the non-Christian Platonists in claiming that God reveals himself in the Logos. To those who do not accept this revelation he is the unknown God. God alone is perfect and good (QDS i). His goodness is transcendent. It is not directed to an end; it is his very nature (Paed. I,8); though naturally he does good to those who choose him. The finest account of God in Clement comes in Selections from the Prophetic Scriptures: 'If anyone has a thought of God, it does not match God's worth - what could that be? So far as in him lies, let him think of a tremendous light of supreme beauty, unthinkable and unapproachable, possessing every good power and every attractive virtue, concerned for all, full of compassion, passionless, good, omniscient, completely prescient, true, sweet, brilliant, unquenchable' (Exc. ex Scr. Proph. 2 I). THE LOGOS Clement's theology is firmly based on the Logos. This concept, derived from the opening verses of John's Gospel, brings together two earlier strands. One comes from the Old Testament. God speaks, and it is done. The Memra,</page><page sequence="13">THE ACHIEVEMENT OF CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA 7I the Word of God, is the self-expression of God, and it is effective in action. The other comes from Heraclitus and the Stoics. The universe is rational; there is Reason behind it, both in the sense that there is a purpose, or pattern (rather like the Chinese Tao), and in the sense of an active Mind. In Philo these strands were already woven together, and woven also with a thread from Plato, and Clement is here, as elsewhere, Christianizing Philo. Clement sees the Logos as the active power of all good, who guides everything right, does everything by unwearying and unfailing power, always everywhere, not circumscribed anywhere, wholly Mind, wholly the Light of the Father, seeing all things, hearing all things, knowing all things (Str. 8,2,5). In another passage he is compared with the sun, shining in brilliance and penetrating through chinks and crannies even the darkest corners (Str. 7,3, 21). So it is characteristic that any passage from the Bible is cited as the very word of the Logos. The unique aspect of the Christian faith was the claim that the Logos was revealed in Jesus of Nazareth. Clement takes up the thought with all his delight in paradoxical wordplay: 'The Logos, the Christ, the cause of our being - for he was in God - as also of our well-being, has now himself appeared to man... The Logos who in the beginning gave us life when he fashioned us, as Creator, has taught us the good life, as our teacher, so that he may afterwards, as God, provide us with eternal life' (Protr. I,7). The Logos had come; one way and another Clement says it time and again. Clement is not very interested in the facts of the life of Jesus: he does not walk with him through Nazareth or Galilee. On the other hand he does not allegorize them. Occasionally he comes near to docetism; Jesus was not an ordinary man and could have had no real need to eat. He is even am biguous about Jesus' suffering. What matters in the historical Jesus is his teaching, his manifestation, and his love expressed in the willingness to suffer. Clement does not offer a coherent or carefully worked out theology of redemption. But, like Augustine after him (Conf 7,9), Clement finds in Platonism a doctrine of the Logos, but only in Christianity the Logos who became man and suffered. What then is the relation of the Logos to God? We must not read back the Arian controversy into the age of Clement or ask of his text questions which it is not designed to answer. One thing is certain. To Clement the Logos is God; even in his earthly existence he is described as 'the Logos, Almighty God'. Sometimes however the direct statement is qualified. The Logos is the image of God, the complete realization of the words 'Let us make man in our image, after our likeness'. The Logos in fact, being God, is also the Mediator between God and the universe. This is admirably if ambiguously expressed in Excerptsfrom Theodotus. The Logos as God is God; the Logos became flesh in the Saviour; the Logos in God and the Logos in Jesus are the same, but acquire a distinction in their activity, which can be</page><page sequence="14">72 JOHN FERGUSON expressed by describing the Logos made flesh as a son and as first-created. Some critics have made much of this, and claimed that Clement teaches a double Logos or two Logoi, but this is not really so; his doctrine is subtle and careful; he was expressing a qualifying distinction not a substantial division. It is wrong to link Clement with Arius. The worst that we can say is that there is some ambiguity, and that Philo's conception of a twofold stage in the ap pearance of the Logos sometimes affects his expression, as it affected Justin and Hippolytus. His central affirmation remains that God and the Logos are one, and that the Logos is timeless, beginningless (Str. 7,I,2; 7,2,7). The Logos is the creator-craftsman, God's adviser and executive. He is of course the divine Reason. He is the Power, Wisdom, as it were the Realization of God in action. Clement is however cautious about identifying the Logos with the Hellenistic Jewish Wisdom as an emanation of God, and prefers to think of the Son as holding the place of Wisdom. He is the Father's Will, Voice, Appearance, Name. In relation to men he is Creator, Tutor or Teacher, Pilot, Driver, Commander-in-Chief, Emperor, Doctor, High-Priest, President Trainer and Umpire, Father, Mother and Nurse. Clement was accused of denigrating the Son; Photius said that 'he reduced him to a creature'; he was removed from the calendar of saints. But others have charged him with Sabellianism, with identifying the Son too closely with the Father. The truth is that Clement is not expressing a systematic theology, but an experienced reality, and he is constrained to do justice both to the exalted power and infinite love which has been revealed to him, and to the fact that it was revealed at all. To believe in the Logos is to be made one in him (Str. 4,25). NATURE We cannot generalize about the early Christian's attitude to nature. Gregory of Nazianzus uses rhetorical commonplaces; Gregory of Nyssa has looked at what he describes. Basil is interested in direct analysis, Hermas in allegorical interpretation. Eusebius is a man of the study, Tertullian loves the created works of God. Clement knows the countryside. He has picked almonds, jumped ditches and smelt farmyards. He knows agriculture from the inside. He can give an accurate account of the various processes of grafting, improv ing Paul's literal sense at the expense of his spiritual message (Str. 6,I5), and knows the varying uses of the pruning-hook (Str. 6,8). In comparing his Miscellanies to a garden he is using a mastered simile, not a commonplace (Str. 7,I8). He knows how shepherds examine sheep (Str. I,I,I7), how horsemen handle horses (QDS 42,6; Protr. IO,92; Str. I,6,34), and how herdsmen guide cattle (Str. 7,20,1 I I). And he loves what he sees. 'He gives you the vast earth to till, water to drink and to sail on, air to breathe, fire to work for you, a world to live in' (Protr. I I, 115) . 'What is more charming or more flowery than a flower?' he</page><page sequence="15">THE ACHIEVEMENT OF CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA 73 asks delightedly and delightfully. 'What gives more pleasure than a lily or a rose?' (Paed. 2,IO,IO3). In the fragments of the work On Providence we have an indication of Clement's philosophy of nature. It is the true reality of the universe, the growth towards true being, implanted by the providence of God. EVIL L Clement's attitude to the problem of evil is governed by three factors, negatively by his vigorous rejection of Gnosticism, positively by his embrace of Platonism and by his vision of the love of God revealed in Jesus. The Gnostics with their dualistic attitudes pressed the orthodox. Clement records their questions: 'Was Adam created perfect or imperfect?' or 'If God cares for you, why are you persecuted and executed?' (Str. 4,II). The Gnostics had their answer, in an anti-god and the evil attendant on matter. They turned popular Platonism to their purposes. Clement will have none of this. In Genesis God created the world and it was good. In Platonic-Christian terms God created the perfect Forms, and the Logos used this perfect pattern to give shape and substance to the material world. Creation is not evil; it is not even neutral; it is good. And God exer cises a continual providential care for his world. What then is evil? It is not a substance, a being. When he speaks of sin he calls it an activity not a substance (Str. 4,93,3). Evil is in fact the absence of good, more precisely the absence of God. Its origin lies in human freedom, not in desiring evil, but in rejecting God, or in a warped judgement which selects as good that which is not truly good. A good world then, and man in it who by God's love is a free being with a free choice of the highest or something lower than the highest. So man is fallen, and God reaches out to him in redemption by means of grace. God becomes man so that man may become God (Protr. 8,4; Str. 7,101,4). But man has still to respond. God does not force men against their will; the work of grace is to save them when they choose. MAN Man was created good but has gone astray. Clement does not believe in inherited pollution (Str. 3,I6,Ioo). We are not held responsible for actions which do not arise from our freewill (Str. 2,74-5). He equally makes no bones about our actual offences. We stand in need of salvation, and this is offered us through the Incarnation and Death of Christ. We must first become aware of our ignorance; then must follow the positive step of faith; then fear to deter us from wrongdoing; then hope, leading us to aim at the best; then discipline and endurance; and finally love and knowledge (Str. 2,6,</page><page sequence="16">74 JOHN FERGUSON 3I; 4,7,54; 5,7,I7). In this, man is offered victory over death (Protr. ii,iii), immortality, and indeed divinity (Str. 7, IO); we must remember that to the Greeks immortality and divinity were virtually synonymous. And the offer is for all men: the energizing power does not come only on men here; it is opera tive at all times and in all places (Str. 6,6,47). Even if the pagans are not at present brothers, they should be treated as such (Str. 7,14,86). THE CHRISTIAN GENTLEMAN Clement's fusion of contemporary culture and Christian grace is nowhere more clearly to be seen than in his portrayal of what has been called the Christian gentleman. There are two main sources for this. One is the fragment from To the Newly Baptised quoted by Eusebius. It is a picture of a very attractive person. The picture starts from quietude, but from an active, rhythmic quiet, not from indolence. Clement's gentleman is a gentle man. There is much good sense. Speech should not be inaudible (would that all preachers and lecturers would fulfil this in practice!) nor deafening. There is an emphasis on social participation, on communication, on give and take, on a readiness both to learn and to instruct, on the combination of courtesy and moral firmness. Simplicity of life, a vegetarian diet, water to drink - these make for happiness. Illness and age should not crush the soul. The secret of this is in dependence on God and communion with God. There is a strong, warm note of joy running through the passage. The other important passage is more extended. It runs through the last two books of The Tutor, and the main source is the Stoic-Cynic Musonius Rufus. To some extent it is an elaboration of the other picture. There is the same emphasis on simplicity of food habits, with practical good sense such as 'don't make a mess of your hands, your face or your couch', 'don't pull faces', 'don't talk with your mouth full; it sounds awful', 'don't splash your wine about as though you were washing your face, or gulp noisily'. Posses sions should be determined by utility. Music should be improving. In a party a Christian should exercise a serious concern for his fellow men while having an inward gaiety. This does not mean that he should laugh at every thing, or pull faces or crack jokes just to make people laugh. (Why not? Clement has no real philosophy of laughter.) From quiet homes and first beginning, Out to the undiscovered ends, There's nothing worth the wear of winning, But laughter, and the love of friends.' Obscenity is common, pagan, uneducated and shameless, but there is nothing obscene about the sexual organs, the sexual act or sexual language, only about their abuse. Social intercourse should be under control. Perfumes and 1 H. Belloc, 'Dedicatory Ode'.</page><page sequence="17">THE ACHIEVEMENT OF CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA 75 garlands are unnecessary luxuries. Moderation applies to sleep as to other things. Sex exists for the procreation of children; total abstinence and promiscuity are both unnatural. Clothing should protect the body: no more. Ornaments are an inadequate substitute for true beauty, which comes from the Logos and from Christian love. It is the soul, not the body, which we should seek to beautify. The baths and other luxuries are dangerous, especi ally to women. Luxury devoted to pleasure shipwrecks a man. Cleanliness, physical fitness are desirable. Over-adornment is to be avoided. A pierced ear is as bad as the pierced nose of the pig. But a woman can use ornament in the attempt to hold her husband: not for anyone else. Clement is stern about the meeting of the sexes, and recommends downcast eyes. Walking should not be dilatory or breathless - and a man should stand on his own feet and not require a slave to push him uphill. The true gentleman will avoid effeminacy, be considerate to his slaves, fairminded, loving and for giving. The ideal girl should be clean, she should not move provocatively, she should keep her mind sharp for conversation. How a man spends his spare time shows what he is really like: he should avoid gossip, womanizing and gambling, and keep good company. We show our philosophy in our daily life, in buying and selling. This whole section ends with married couples: they should not kiss in front of the servants. Clement sees marriage from the man's point of view. But, here and elsewhere, he has some charming pictures of the partnership of the Christian home. The most interesting point in the whole exposition is when Clement describes obscenity as common, pagan, uneducated, and shameless (Paed. 2,6). In the second adjective we have a Christian judgement of a sort. The fourth is the judgement of an ethical philosopher; we can call it Stoic if we will; it comes from a synthetic Stoic-Platonist system. But the first and third are class judgements. This is typical of Clement's thought about the Christ ian's social morality. It is an account based upon the ordinary upper-class social morality of his day. There is not much distinctively Christian about most of it. But it is Christian in what it rejects, and there is a superadded Christianity. The title 'The Christian gentleman' is precise. Clement's general position is magnificently expressed in a passage from The Exhortation (Io): 'Farm, if you are a farmer, but acknowledge God while you farm. Sail your ship, if you are in love with the life at sea, but call on the heavenly pilot as you do so.' We might add 'If you are a gentleman, be a gentle man, and remember him who, when persecuted, did not revile back.' THE CHRISTIAN VIRTUES Clement's general definition of virtue is 'a disposition of the soul harmonious to reason (the Logos) over the whole of life' (Paed. I, IO, IOI). This is Stoic doctrine, conformable with Platonic belief, but capable of a specifically</page><page sequence="18">76 JOHN FERGUSON Christian interpretation. The primary analysis of this is into the four 'Cardi nal' virtues which are identified in The Republic and become a standard part of Greek ethical thought. These are practical wisdom, defined as 'a faculty of the soul devoted to the study of all that is, and capable of making distinctions and comparisons in what follows therefrom, like and unlike, of commending or rejecting it, and of conjecturing the future' (Str. 6,17); courage, defined in Stoic terms (which Philo also adopts) as 'the under standing of what is fearful, what is not fearful and what lies in between the two' (Str. 2,I8; 7,I I); self-control, 'a state which in choice and avoidance preserves the judgements of practical wisdom' (Str. 2,I8); and justice or righteousness, 'a harmony of the parts of the soul' in terms clearly drawn from The Republic (Str. 4,26,i63). But Clement goes beyond the cardinal virtues to exalt the Stoic virtue of freedom from passion. Lilla has shown that Clement links the passions (principally desire, pleasure and anger) to the irrational parts of the soul and to the physical senses. He says many times that the Logos cures passions (Paed. I,I,2; 1,3,I; I,3,3; 1,6,I-4; I,5 I, I, etc.) . Control of the passions is not enough; the aim is to be freed from them altogether. To this end asceticism and self-discipline are the keys (Str. 2,20). The man who has self-control has become, so far as humanly possible, like God, who is impassible; he is 'deified into a passionless condition' (Str. 4,23). On the whole this is an aberration, acceptable only if passion is defined to produce a tautological conclusion as 'godless passion', which is what in the long run Clement inclines to do. He is ambiguous: in the same breath he describes God as compas sionate and passionless (Exc. ex scr. proph. 2I). The problem is threefold. One part concerns the historical record. Jesus was not passionless: the gospel records show him as thirsty (a form of desire: John 19: 28), joyful (a form of pleasure: John 3: 29; I 7: I3) and angry (Mark 3: 5) - and Clement does not allegorize the New Testament. The second part is the ambiguity of the Greek pathos, which means 'passion' in this technical sense, but which also connotes suffering in all its forms. We certainly may not say that Jesus did not suffer, and ifJesus is the perfect revelation of God (John I 4: 9) it is hard to see how we can say that God is in this sense impassible. It is important to remember that the Patripassians were declared unorthodox not because they claimed that the Father suffered but because they claimed that the Father suffered in the Son. The third part of the problem is in the ambiguity of logos and even Logos. To say that the Logos is the memra, God's self-expres sion, is one thing. To say that the Logos is reason is something quite different. Stoic rationalism has here tended to corrupt Christian thought. Humanly speaking, we know that we are not merely rational, but strongly and pro foundly irrational, and that our irrationalities are not immoralities, but the motive power behind our actions for good and bad. We cannot and should not be passionless. 'I do well to be angry,' said one more than usually</page><page sequence="19">THE ACHIEVEMENT OF CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA 77 understanding Christian, 'but I have mistaken the occasions.' The power of a noble enthusiasm, in the metaphorical as well as the literal sense, is needed to keep us from bloodlessness. Clement does not deny this, but he is am biguous about it, and he is continually flirting with Docetism because he is uneasy about letting Jesus into the actualities of our human condition. He is here in the strict sense being doctrinaire, but he is following Stoic not Christian doctrine. He should, on his own premisses, have looked at the picture ofJesus in the New Testament, and drawn from that his conclusions about the nature of God and the fulfilment of man. He would not have found passionlessness. He would have found passion directed by love. Linked with these Platonic-Stoic virtues are the three virtues of Paul's hymn - faith, hope and love. Faith is the first step towards knowledge (Str. 2,5,8). Clement discusses it in the technical language of the philosophy of his day. He calls it a preconception directed by the will. It is a free action which leads us to make assumptions. Or it is an assent of piety. Again 'assent' is a technical term denoting a response to something given; only the thing given is in this instance an invisible reality. Faith is the gift of the Logos. It is not a determined product of our nature. Faith is sufficient for salvation, but it is incomplete of itself. The relation of faith to knowledge is that of the child to the fully-grown adult. But we cannot know without faith, precisely because faith must 'preconceive' its object, and because knowledge is a gift of God to be received by faith, and because first principles cannot be demon strated, and because faith is needed to discern the genuine from the counter feit. Faith is the way to truth. It moves through the objects of perception, leaving assumptions behind, speeding on to infallible truth. It is the very foundation of truth (Str. 2,i-6). It is the ear of the soul (Str. 5,I). Osborn has spoken with justifiable warmth of the part played by faith in Clement's scheme of things, and claims that it 'made the weak point of classical philosophy intelligible and sound'. Clement sees two roads from faith to fulfilment. One is moral, the other intellectual. They are love and knowledge. In his more mystical moments Clement cannot hold them apart. Knowledge is the perfection of love (Str. 4,7,54), love the perfection of knowledge. On hope he has relatively little to say (Str. 5,2-3); all that he holds about hope is swallowed up in the certainties of faith and, less obviously but more interestingly, love. At one point he sees the three as facets of the same commitment, faith to the past, love to the present, hope to the future (Str. 2,I2). The great Christian word for love is agape, and for Clement faith and love are the two focal points of the Christian life. This is right. The melody of love recurs throughout the symphony of his works. It is the very nature of God, and because of this, it is the very nature of God's relationship with man, and because of this in turn, it is man's response to God's love. So we are called to love God, which means to put on God, to love our neighbour,</page><page sequence="20">78 JOHN FERGUSON who is Christ, and to love our fellow-men for the sake of Christ - and that means, to go and act (QDS 27-3I). This love finds its expression in right living, concern for others, active well-doing. Love is the theme of some of Clement's most powerful apophthegms. In The Exhortation (g) he writes: 'Let us speed on to be gathered in salvation, in rebirth, in one love, many as we are, in accordance with the unifying power of the singleness of Being'; in Miscellanies (2,I9): 'The love based on reason (or the Logos) stands firm'; in Salvation for the Rich? (38): 'Love is poured out for our brother; for him it is all aflutter, for him it is sanely mad.' Clement's other great word in this connection is philanthropia, love of mankind.' This is a New Testament word (Tit. 3: 4) with a long history behind it, and it became almost a technical term of the Christian God. It makes concrete the more general 'love'. God shows his agape in his philan thropia, his long-suffering love in his care for mankind. In his love of mankind he does not let us go (Protr. io). This then becomes the concrete expression of our love. It is for example the motive force which leads us to share our worldly foods; we cannot love our fellow men and keep our possessions to ourselves (Paed. 3,6). It is the right attitude of poorer Christians to rich Christians, not to be servile to their wealth, but to love them as fellow human beings (QDS I). More generally it is the treatment of all human beings as if they were personal friends, and finds one obvious expression in brotherly love towards those who share the same spirit (Str. 2,I). This is good, basic New Testament Christianity. Love is shown to God (Luke IO: 27); it is the cement which holds the Christian community together (John I 5: I 2); it is shown in the casual encounter with any man (Luke IO: 27ff.); it is directed redemptively towards enemies (Matt. 5: 44). A Christian church must always be a community, a fellowship, or it is nothing: we have the admiring cry of those outside 'How these Christians love one another!' Equally a church must always be reaching out; it is not a closed shop or mutual admiration society. The individual Christian similarly will be a part of a living fellowship of Christians; the love that there he both shows and receives, he will show in all his relationships, as an active, creative force, whether he receives it or not. THE CHRISTIAN GNOSTIC The ultimate aim is knowledge of God. If the true Gnostic had to choose between knowledge of God and eternal salvation he would choose knowledge of God. This is an apprehension, it is the sort of knowledge which you grasp firmly - or which grasps you firmly (the exact interpretation of the Stoic term is controversial). It is received from the Logos, as is faith. Its end is 1 J. Ferguson, Moral Values in the Ancient World (London, I958), pp. I02-I8; S. Lorenz, De progressu actionis O&amp;AavGpw7rn'j, Diss.

In the contemplation of the unseen God the true Gnostic is as a god among men; he is one with Christ. Clement is continually railing at the Gnostic heretics, and certain it is that even the greatest of them misrepresented the New Testament, and that it is in the end not easy to reconcile their systems with anything recognizable as Christianity. But Gnosticism was the air which Clement breathed. The Gospel of Truth, for example, is described as 'revealed to the perfect through the mercies of the Father as the hidden mystery, Jesus the Christ' (i 8, I I-I 5) . Theodotus declared (Clem. Exc. ex Theod. 78,2) that Gnostics know 'who we were and what we have become; where we were or where we had been made to fall; where we are hurrying to; where we are being redeemed from; what birth is and what rebirth is'. The Valentinians may have given heretical answers, but the questions were Christian questions. To put it differently, the aim of the Gnostic heretics and of Clement was knowledge of God. They differed on the relation between faith and knowledge; they differed radically on the system they believed in. But Clement has learned from the heretical Gnostics something about gnosis; they have contributed to his picture of the true Gnostic. The true Gnostic is the full-grown or perfect man - though no one has attained full perfection except Christ. He abstains from wrongdoing, opens himself to the Gospel, cooperates with God's will, does good for love's sake, and pursues the knowledge of God for its own sake. He is altogether free from passion (Str. 4,2I-3). He is at once gay and serious. He is the true king; he is God's high priest. He is gentle and charming, approachable, clubbable, patient, warm in response, easy in his conscience, austere. All knowledge is his province. Knowledge is the perfection of man as man. It finds its fulfilment through the scientific understanding of things divine. In bearing, life and speech (logos) it is in tune with itself and the divine Logos (Str. 7,7-IO). Knowledge is the highest good, and all good consequences flow from it, but it is to be chosen for its own sake (Str. 6,I2). The aim of the true Gnostic is not the Stoic aim of living according to nature, but the Platonic aim of likeness to God. To know oneself is to know God; to know God is to become like God (Paed. 3, I) . Merki has well analysed the qualities which this implies: firmness, freedom from emotions, purity and contemplation, faith, love and the search for God, movement away from the physical world and communion with the world of thought, gentleness, service of others and piety, forgiveness, kindness, non-attachment, and the imitation of Christ.' His ultimate fulfilment is in the eternal vision of God. Till then he lives in anticipation, open to God's presence, open in contemplation to past, present and future, living timelessly in the world of time, the very temple of God. I H.

For many this was an age of anxiety. Already in the reign of Marcus Aurelius the frontier dams of empire were leaking, straining. The emperor himself had been a pensive, wistful, ineffective agnostic. Contrast the warm humanity of Clement with his insistence that joy is the keynote of the church and gladness of the Christian gnostic (Str. 7,I0I). Charles Bigg said of him 'No later writer has so serene and hopeful a view of human nature.'" Clement is the real founder of a Christian philosophy of religion. The Neo-Platonists were to come to their philosophical commitment in three stages - purification, initiation, vision. The Christian Platonist before them offers a parallel scheme. It was a remarkable achievement to conceive it, still more to go so far towards executing it. Adolf Harnack assessed it justly. He called it 'the boldest literary experiment in the history of the church', 'the first attempt to use Holy Scripture and the church tradition, together with the assumption that Christ, as the Reason of the world, is the source of all truth, as the basis of a presentation of Christianity, which at once addresses itself to the cultured by satisfying the scientific demand for a philosophical ethic and theory of the world, and at the same time reveals to the believer the rich content of his faith'.2 1 C. Bigg, The Christian Platonists of Alexandria (Oxford, I913), p. 72. 2 A. Harnack, Dogmengeschichte 2,324.</page></plain_text>
