<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHITECTURE AND TIME: A PROLEGOMENA Peter Carl Music, like architecture, is time and space. Music and architecture alike are a matter of measure. For a finished and successful work holds within it a vast amount of inten? tion, a veritable world, which reveals itself to those who have a right to it: that is to say, to those who deserve it. Then a fathomless depth gapes open, all walls are broken down, every other presence is put to flight, and the miracle of Vespace indicible is achieved.1 Le Corbusier argues here that the essence of time and space ? and therefore of architecture (and music) ? is measure and that the highest calling of measure is its opposite, Chaos (a literal trans? lation of 4a fathomless depth gapes open'). None the less, the fathomless miracle of / 'espace indicible is immediately followed by several recollections from the period of Vers une architecture'. We must strive towards the establishment of a standard in order to face the problem of perfection. Architecture is a process based on standards. Standards are the products of logic, of analysis and painstaking study.2 Le Corbusier includes among these The Parthenon is the product of selection applied to a standard', despite having just declared two pages previously: 'Effect of a work of art (architecture, statue or painting) on its surroundings: waves, outcries, turmoil (the Par? thenon on the Acropolis at Athens), lines spurting, radiating out as if produced by an explosion.'3 Military and architectural affairs have been allied since ancient times, even at the level of the sacred. However, once again we see that the cultivation of measure, of a standard, of perfection, of logic and analysis are intended to yield their opposite. Le Corbusier speaks of mathematical knowledge as 'flashes of fundamental truth, which we are entitled to experience sometimes at the crossing of the ways, and which are an authentic fact of religion'.4 Mathematics is 'another realm, the realm of the gods, the room which holds the key to the great systems. These doors [opening on to the world of mathematics] are the doors of mir? acles. Having gone through one, man is no longer the operative force, but rather it is his contact with the universe.'5 One may question the mathematical content of the Modulor, or of the archi? tecture,6 and even more the affiliation of divinity with 'the great systems'7; but the point is clear ? what Le Corbusier seeks to construct are rooms such as these, wherein one might 'remain, entranced by so much dazzling, all-pervading light'.8 These words 48 were written just before he began designing buildings whose main rooms were structured about darkness (for example Ronchamp, the church at La Tourette, the assembly hall of the Parliament at Chan? digarh).9 Like the light of Plato's myth of the cave, Le Corbusier's light plays between a blinding brightness and the dim shadows of the chthonic and the amorphous. This material derives from Le Corbusier's last, most explicitly poetic, period.10 Le Corbusier's conception of measure is as much attuned to the principles of coincidentia oppositorumx 1 as is the rest of his thought. Indeed, measure (and therefore the Modulor) is the vehicle of mediation of the rest, of what Le Corbusier calls 'a life devoted to art, and most particularly to harmony'.12 The term 'harmony' denotes, along with poesie, the highest of Le Corbusier's aspirations: Harmony, reigning over all things, regulating all the things of our lives, is the spontaneous, indefatigable and tenacious quest of man animated by a single force: the sense of the divine {sense du sacri] and pursuing one aim: to make a paradise on earth.13 The meaning of this sentence is not obvious. First, if harmony truly regulated everything, it would not be worth remarking upon. The conception of an active harmony which 'regulates' is itself odd ? as opposed to, or rather in addition to, the usual passive conceptions of harmony which depict either relationships ('harmony of) or a manner of participation ('in harmony with'). His conception is a consequence of identifying human laws (laws which regulate) with the 'laws' of nature, these laws with the laws of mathematics, and the laws of mathematics with harmony,14 to arrive at harmony as regulation. In fact, the sentence creates the conditions it only appears to describe, and attempts to justify what is claimed to exist already. Important distinctions are obscured, or consumed, by the compelling power of what is made to prevail here. This harmony which 'regulates' or 'reigns over' 'all the things of our lives' ? and is therefore presumably transcendent to both things and lives ? is none the less something immanent in us: the 'sense of the sacred'. Moreover, this 'sense' is not a respect for what is transcendent, but rather a 'force . . . pursuing one aim', which in turn animates a 'quest', as if we were victims of some sort of spell or some 'spon? taneous' biological compulsion (the regulative power of harmony). In this way, he arrives at the remarkable conclusion that 'universal harmony' is a species of tragic 'quest' for the earthly paradise. Le Corbusier is struggling with the transaction of the particular AA FILES 22</page><page sequence="2">and the universal. He has confused the matter by converting the possible disclosure of a paradigm or symbol into the inevitable working out of an obscure force which carries scientific, mathe? matical, religious and psychological overtones. He further situates the whole process both within and for the sake of an individual, as if to confirm Nietzsche's arguments on the will. What is most important, however, and most indicative of the depth of Le Cor? busier's thinking, is that he recognizes that the issue here is destiny, or time: 'this duet, this duel, this alliance, this struggle, this differ? ence and this sameness of the destinies of the one (man) and the other (the universe).'15 He distinguishes two kinds of time: 'the stream of time . . . hell on earth' and the '"silence in heaven for about the space of half an hour" . . . isolated from cosmic time, suddenly so moving that it takes one's breath away'.16 In the latter of these resides the main content of / fespace indicible : that moment of death which is the basis of a new beginning. Immediately following these passages, Le Corbusier remarks that 'good composition requires the use of very few elements', giving as examples the twenty-six letters of the alphabet, the ninety-two elements of the Universe, the ten figures of arithmetic, the seven notes of music, the times of day and year. He concludes, 'All this is the fruit of the marriage of the human and cosmic orders. Order is the very key of life.'17 It may be doubted that 'composition' adequately summarizes how letters relate to letters', elements to elements, numbers to numbers, notes to notes, or increments of time to each other. Le Corbusier only implies that written language, matter, mathematics, music and time are comparable because of the phenomenon of elements, although collectively, these systems of signs refer to a significant segment of reality. According to Le Corbusier, they constitute the children, or 'fruit', of a 'marriage'. This marriage takes place between two 'orders', the human and the cosmic. Finally, we are told that 'order', in the singular, is the very key of life. There are, then, four components in this scheme: the human and cosmic orders, their marriage, the systems of signs, and order as the key of life. As to the mutual relationship of each of these, the best that can be said is that the systems of signs derive from their apparent opposite: a metaphor (of marriage and procreation).18 To resort to metaphor at this point is a virtual necessity, since, by any reckon? ing, this 'marriage' is the order. The Signs! when the mind can conclude by a sign which henceforth will have for it (and for others) something like an algebraic value, then thought takes a leap forward; it has liberated a space, an expanse from then on qualified (signified) by a term or mark instantly understandable by anyone This for Urb[anism] architecture painting for dialogue for exegesis essay [writing]19 The comprehensiveness of the algebra of signs is apparent. In fact, what he says about his signs pertains to his whole enterprise. There is a side of Le Corbusier that is always categorizing things ('les categories = les "signes"'20). From building and city types, to road networks and the 'objet-types' (later the 'objets ? reaction poetique'); from attitudes to the relationship of column and wall, to types of human personality; from the dimensions and materials used in design and construction, to the origins of natural order; from cubist spatial structure and perception, to human posture and ges? tures; from the selection of photographs and details of typography, to the furnishings of public, private and sacred life ? all are AA FILES 22 I.

To the extent that these categories possess a normative value for Le Cor busier, they are like types; to the extent that these categories possess a representational value, they are like the compositional elements discussed above, and deserve to be called 'signs'. In many respects, a work by Le Corbusier is a synthesis of these signs; and the measure of synthesis is generally provided by a recti? linear matrix, or grid. The most familiar examples are the geo? metric configurations deployed in the organization of his buildings and towns; but the CIAM grids, the 'grid of Arborisation' for Chan? digarh, or the 'Iconostase' (which he described as 'valid architec? tural order') of the Poeme de I 'angle droit all participate in the same style of thought. The Modulor represents the essence of this form of continuity21 ? in which one recognizes his proportional matrix as a sign for a context 'regulated' by harmony. 'Asia, India appear with a symbolism of the heart ? Christ + their own ? cosmic (nature) ? implanted upon a code of signs = freedom within a human-cosmic order.'22 This may be only an offhand remark; but it is certainly paradoxical that 'a code of signs' (on which the 'symbolism of the heart' is 'implanted') might be con? sidered the basis of 'freedom within a human-cosmic order'.23 However, this version of freedom may be taken as the ultimate aspiration of his code of signs. What can be said about the relationship between the Modulor and the algebra of signs is that, first, the proportional matrix of the Modulor is intended to stand for a context (reality) regulated by a harmony (that is, unity) whose ultimate destiny is Chaos. Second, the differentiae of reality are represented as a code of signs, whose ultimate destiny is freedom in a human-cosmic order. In so far as this code is possessed of content, it resides in the 'marriage of the human and cosmic orders', for which the Modulor provides the paradigm. On this basis, human freedom emerges from regulative harmony to be identified with Chaos, the violence of the new beginning. Le Corbursier's construct displays a general ambiguity regarding the priority of symbolic and conceptual meaning, with which we are not concerned here.24 What is of interest in his construct is its deep involvement with temporality. Le Corbusier regularly insists that the well-known grids of his paintings, buildings and towns are not vehicles of design; rather, the contest of primary demands must act itself out first. The pres? ence of these grids in the final work none the less attests to their importance for him (Figs. 3,4). Whatever else may be interesting about these with respect to structure, proportion, spatial framing and so forth, the main point is that all the differences can be regis? tered against a matrix of linear measures. Perceptually, the grid is an implicit phenomenon, in both paintings and architecture; and, as a result, it carries the quality of a hidden presence. In part this can be affiliated with the elevated status of secret wisdom which Le Corbusier inherits from late-nineteenth-century esoteric thought. In part it can be affiliated with the sorts of planning principles familiar from the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. But the most fundamental intention behind the hidden or implicit presence of these linear measures is that they suitably embody time ? not unlike the metre of a poem or the 'tempo' or 'beat' of a piece of music. What Le Corbusier seeks to establish is a rhythmic field as the matrix for difference (first for the elements of architectural physiognomy and then for human action): 'Man can only think and act in terms of man (the measures which serve his body25) and integrate himself in the universe (a rhythm or rhythms which are the breathing of the world).'26 In Le Corbusier's visual work, these linear matrices are generally AA FILES 22</page><page sequence="4">endowed with some form of closure. He displays a preference for configurations built around squares, and for such devices as the 'place of the right angle'. However, these arrangements are rarely static;27 one finds a primary square shifting with respect to its con? text, for example, or a spiral being developed, or that the bound? aries of the field are ambiguous.28 All of these devices possess iconographic value for Le Corbusier, but this is not our present con? cern. What the configuration itself achieves is an arena of manifest? ation, a modulated context for dramatic action. The prominence of the horizon in his structuring of space indicates the ultimate refer? ence of the proposition ? the 'breathing' universe. Whatever one's opinions as to its merits, the intention seems to be to establish a reciprocity first of all between the linee occulte (hidden lines) of the rhythmic context and the explicit disposition of architectural matter (oriented to the earth, particularly in the later work). Second, these, as well as a number of oppositions (such as dark/light, straight/curved, potential orientation/actual orient? ation, etc.), are reconciled in the moment of violence of Vespace indicible,29 the theatre of practical life. The result is a species of microcosm, in which the rhythmic articulation of matter seeks to be a vehicle for the potential fulfilment of time.30 The main elements of what appears to be an elaborate concoction of philosophy, design, iconography and cultural renewal are in fact ancient; and we may regard Le Corbusier as reinterpreting the ancient material. In particular, the temporal aspects ? which are the key to the rest ? are indebted to the ornamental tradition in architecture. The majority of Le Corbusier's early drawings of ornamental motifs are of ancient Greek, medieval, oriental or 'primitive' origin (Figs. 1, 2);31 and a fair portion of this remains, at least indirectly, in his thinking. However, the overall proposition of a system of iconographic signs mediated by the proportional matrix of the Modulor is indebted to the transformation of ornament in the context of Renaissance perspectivity. This evaluation would come as a surprise to Le Corbusier, to judge from the disdain he heaps upon the Sala Paolina of the Castel S. Angelo,32 and from the scorn he reserves for Vignola from the beginning to the end of his career. Le Corbusier's enmity is directed at Vignola's book on the orders, which was so important to architectural design in the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. Among the 'horrors' of the Ecole, according to Le Corbusier, are star-shaped plans33 and excessive and badly con? ceived ornament. However, it is Vignola (in such works as the Orti Farnesiana on the Palatine and Villa Lante in Bagnaia) who first recognizes the possibilities of a conception of architectural ordering which is fundamental to Le Corbusier: the reciprocity of architectural fragments and a structured landscape.34 The representational nature that is embodied in ornamental motifs has been subsumed into a more generalized spatial conception that includes nature structured as a garden. From this point onwards, it becomes possible to regard city and garden as aspects of a single represent? ational continuum mediated by rhetoric and perspective; and the direct synthesis of garden and city into a single topography begins to take place in Rome with Pope Sixtus V. The latent autonomy of the representational continuum in the sixteenth century is sub? sequently made into an explicitly conceptual construct, particularly in French academic theory; and it is this theoretical reduction that is the basis of Beaux-Arts practice. Le Corbusier's denial of the product and procedures of the Ecole is only part of a fairly thorough rejection of, or self-alienation from, his immediate historical circumstances.35 He offers history a way out of its stagnation, in the form of a radiant 'paradise on earth', AA FILES 22 through the dual appeal to a modernism full of promise and to a primitivism that embodies fundamental values.36 Le Corbusier's programme is consequently implicated in the style of thought which he desires to overcome and engaged in a recovery of tradition as the guarantee of a modernity which needs to be discovered. The micro? cosm which is the vehicle of renewal seeks to confront history, while none the less remaining historically credible, by finding a temporality which is both universal and metamorphic, which indicates both time as such and its fundamental orientation. To the extent that it serves its purpose, it relies upon a complex network of analogies.37 For its own structure, it relies upon a play between a representational field similar to that of Vignola and the more ancient ornamental tradition. Of the wealth of issues which the problem of ornament comprises, two are relevant to our effort to recover the role of ornament in the architectural embodiment of time. We will look first at the problem of ancient ornament and the three horizons of temporality, and then at the transformation of ornament in the Renaissance, which will be discussed in two parts. The great theme of nature and ornament will be not addressed directly, but will be allowed to take its role in the light of the other themes. ANCIENT ORNAMENT AND THE THREE HORIZONS OF TEMPORALITY The magnificent ram rising amidst the leaves of a golden tree, found in the Royal Graves of Ur (c.2500 bc) and now in the British Museum (Fig. 6), was originally one of a pair. The ram, the tree and the base are fashioned upon a wooden armature from bitumen, stone, shell, wood, lapis lazuli, and gold foil, which is to say, a group of materials which encompass the chthonic and the celestial realms. This level of craftsmanship is restricted to the artisans attached to the temple, and circumscribed by its rituals and protocols.38 Detailed interpretation of the scene is difficult, because it appears only obliquely in myth. However,.like a number of such scenes, it may antedate the surviving mythic material, for it appears fre? quently in the art of the region, in the earliest strata of Sumer and eventually as far west as Crete and Mycenae. It is related to a class of such representations in which paired animals (usually horned animals, or lions) rise on their hindquarters either side of a central tree.39 The base of our example has stones cut in a diamond shape, which is similar to the conventional rendering of the mountain, and other examples of the scene (for example, a fresco fragment from Mari) show the tree at the apex of a pyramidal mountain, with rams rising from the slopes. This mountain is part of an extremely rich and ancient symbolism,40 whose meanings include, at least, the land in general, a place of birth41 and the nether world, and 'link between heaven and earth'. This latter notion, which needless to say attaches itself to (but is not limited to ? any religious ritual has a similar purpose42) the ziggurat, preserves within it the pre cosmogonic situation before heaven and earth were separated. What is embodied in the mountain (as distinguished from those themes which emphasize the metamorphic powers of the soil) are the origins of division, and therefore of time. This would seem to be manifest in the conventional means of representation of the mountain: a reiteration of little versions of itself, all the same size (giving an overall effect of scales); the massive unity of the mountain is manifest as its opposite ? undifferentiated rhythm. The ram is quite naturalistically represented, at least as to form. Indeed, its rather elaborate collection of materials has been care? fully worked into the detailed physiognomy of the animal, as if the intention were to emphasize both the separateness and the unity of 51</page><page sequence="5">6. Sculpture of ram discovered in the Royal Graves ofUr, c.2500 BC. (British Museum) 52 the parts, both the abstract composition of materials and the spirit of a living ram, both the remoteness of his presence and the familiarity of his behaviour.43 The apparently crude fabrication of the tree, as well as its sym? metry, endows it with an intermediate level of schematism between that of the base and the paradoxical artificiality and liveliness of the ram. The number of petals of each rosette corresponds to the number of branches of the tree, and these starkly divide into two groups of four at the top of the cylindrical trunk (the full sequence is 1-2-4-8). The possible relationship of this arrangement to the symbolism of the four quarters (the numerological and spatial divisions of the complete solar cycle of extremes and mean, and sig? nifying the whole as configured according to those divisions) would give to the single leaf growing from the centre the significance of the beginning of a new cycle.44 This would conform to the tempor? ality of regeneration, the one theme which all commentators per? ceive in this tree, and in its cognate, the vine.45 The branches fan out to either side of an opening for a central alignment of the single leaf and the ram's head.46 His head is both screened and revealed by the spray of gold, out of which the tree has been fabricated; and the divisional structure of the tree has its ulti? mate metamorphosis in its blossoming and as light.47 His hind hoofs rest on the base, whose articulation derives from the moun? tain (not unlike the contemporaneous temple-platforms), and his front hoofs just touch the branches at the point of their first division.48 The unique moment of the epiphany of the ram is care? fully situated with respect to both the temporality of origins as uni? versal rhythm and to the oriented temporality of regeneration. To attribute 'fecundity' or 'fertility' to this ram is one of the com? monplaces of the scholarly literature; and it is equally common for fecundity to take on the quality of a sort of open-ended cosmic springtime, as if the other seasons did not exist. The paradox of a unitary origin which manifests itself as undifferentiated rhythm conforms to a conception of chaos which is latent order;49 and it may be that our more recent conception of chaos as ever-escalating difference (enshrined in the so-called Second Law of Thermo? dynamics) contributes to the overvaluation of fecundity as birth. It is clear, at any rate, that for the ancient Near East, death was only an aspect of a larger temporality; indeed, to the extent that the mountain represented the nether world, it did so in its status as embodiment of origins.50 Similarly, the orientedness of regener? ative time arises more out of the sequence of birth and death than out of a radical priority of one over the other. What is so enigmatic about Nature is that its eternal being is disclosed in the temporality of birth and death. The structure and the metamorphosis of the tree embody this eternal process of Nature, in terms of which the ram is concealed and revealed. However, it is so only for, and for the sake of, the finitude of human beings who possess the reflective distance to recognize it and the imagination to re-enact it.51 It is through re-enactment that the play of origins and of oriented time is constituted as the context for dramatic time. Mimetic dis? tance, which would seem to be only a condition of human finitude, is in fact what gives dramatic time its concreteness, that is, the experience of being both part of and separate from the context and its transcendent processes. What is also important to the concrete? ness of this experience is the integrity of what is guaranteed by the mountain (that heaven and earth exist for each other in their division, that a timeful world exists) and what is promised in the regenerative vine or tree (that temporality is oriented, or has purpose). The content which we have adduced for the Sumerian ram is hardly restricted to this artefact; indeed the artefact was selected AA FILES 22</page><page sequence="6">7. Fresco in the Palace of Tikulti-Ninurta /, c.1200 BC, as reconstructed by Walter Andrae. only because it is familiar, because it is not affiliated with the cen? tral cult, and because it adequately demonstrates the fullness of the temporal drama. In an architectural setting, this drama is fulfilled in human ritual, ceremony, actions and decisions. Accordingly, the content is preserved, but the fundamental conditions are established through ornament, as the mediating structure for dramatic action. The situation is well represented in the wall frescos of the Palace of Tikulti-Ninurta I, built approximately 1,300 years after the time of the Royal Graves at Ur, or about midway between Mari and the Temple-Palace of Solomon.52 The segment reconstructed by Walter Andrae (Fig. 7) is composed of three registers. The upper? most register is an alternating series of palmettes and bound palm fronds linked together by a special filleted or braided cord which plays a significant role in all imagery related to the 'sacred tree'. The next register alternates these bound fronds with twelve- and sixteen-petalled rosettes (suggesting lunar and solar divisions, respectively). The main register is dominated by repetitions of a specific config? uration of 'sacred tree'. In fact, this tree is completely confected of palmettes strung along the cord and spread out about the top and bottom of a herring-bone trunk, with whorled terminations binding a larger palmette at each end. The cord is separated into three seg? ments. One rises from a pair of egg-like rocks53 at the bottom and terminates in 2 palmettes. The second is looped through the base of the column and carries 4 palmettes. The third is looped through the neck of the column and carries 8 + 1 palmettes. We are already familiar with this sequence. In one of the scenes, a less elaborate version of this tree rises between two horned ibexes. They are obvi? ously related to our ram, but stand on a filleted cord emerging from two of the egg-shaped rocks, facing the tree (which in this case also rises from the rocks) with front hoofs raised. The herringbone pat? tern on the trunk has opened the windings, perhaps to suggest a double row of seeds, or simply the bark. What is most striking about the whole arrangement is how much of the structure is built out of a rhythm of modules, from the filleted cord up to the panels in which the scenes appear. The vertical mis? alignment of the three registers seems to be a consequence of nothing more than allowing the modules to work their course across the wall. Local symmetries of some complexity are well executed; but each element of the whole retains its autonomy. This indicates that the content of individual configurations matters more than the rigorous subordination of the parts to a whole.54 However, the pre? sentation of everything in terms of rhythm points to what, along with the tree and its elements, is regarded as the common basis: the AA FILES 22 8. Relief from the Palace of Assurnasirpal II at Nimrud, c.865 BC. (British Museum) regenerative temporality of the 'sacred tree'. The single most char? acteristic attribute of architectural ornament is this manifestation of the temporality of its subject as rhythms of modules. It is this tem? porality that will become the basis of later elaboration in propor? tional and geometrical terms. This tree occupies a special position in Assyrian ritual; and, while it obviously displays a continuity with the tree as we saw it in the Sumerian context, its contribution to column iconography may be judged from the survival of certain of its elements as late as the Persian Empire, and perhaps later.55 The representation of plants or animals in or as some form of pattern is seen in very early forms of ornament (for example, the Halaf or Samarra ware of the fifth millennium). The enigma of the temporal disclosure of Nature's eternity is presented in such configurations: the life of the plant or animal prevails in respect of a more transcendent rhythm. By the time of the Sumerian ram, one can see the degree of differentiation of the proposition, first between between animal and plant and, second, between both of these and the mountain. In the wall painting, the ibexes exhibit little of the nuance of the sculptured ram; rather, they help to qualify the tree, in much the same way as do the griffins which more frequently take this position in later Assyrian art. The Assyrian wall-paintings are concerned primarily with the modalities of regenerative time. The trunk of the tree forms an armature for what is, in effect, a vine; and tree and vine may be said to be fused. Moreover, the dialectic between the specific temporality of the plants and a more transcendent temporality is here manifest in the vine-like chain of palmettes which surrounds the tree in a radial configuration.56 Later, this becomes more of a network, as can be seen in the Neo Assyrian relief from Assurnasirpal IPs palace at Nimrud (Fig. 8). The complex rhythms and relationships of this network take on the quality of an aureole oriented about the upper palmette. Here we may be seeing a reinterpretation of the metamorphosis into light, which we saw in the Sumerian tree, a possibility which is enhanced by the dark/light opposition of the colours with which it is painted.57 The traditional use of registers in ancient Near Eastern narrative art (beginning with the Uruk vase) indicates that the climax of the story appears at the top.58 Architectural ornament tends to be differentiated in a primary way with respect to the horizontal orient? ation of a room. However, at the secondary level of articulation the wall may be regarded in terms of the hierarchy of register. The prominence of the palmette chain at the topmost register is consistent with later uses of this motif,59 and with the metamorphic blossoming which characterizes the attitude to the upper palmette of the 53</page><page sequence="7">column. In the fully elaborated form of this tree, the god Assur appears at the top. The oriented time of the vine/tree is deployed to render the structure of mediation between human and divine. This mediating function is sustained at the primary level of articulation. The placement of this tree in the niche behind the throne and at the four corners of the throne room of the palace of Assurnasirpal II establishes a specially bounded setting for the events that prevailed there.60 The room, and its position in the palace, is the receptacle of actions and decisions which seek to create and to maintain order in the empire. The human inter? pretation of divine order takes place in a setting which is derived from ritual re-enactment. The throne room articulates the mediation with the divine through motifs relating to oriented time. The throne room itself, however, takes the role of the mountain, which is very little in evidence in the iconography of the wall-paintings or reliefs.61 The mediation through oriented time is, as it were, the middle term between the time of human decisions and the time of that which is always already there as the point of departure for all decisions in history (the time of origins). The epiphany, the moment of appearance, of the Sumerian ram is then the analogy upon which is based the rendering of the movement from indecision to decision of the ruler. What 'appears' in that movement, but only potentially, is the Tightness, the justice, the goodness or the truth of the decisions, and therefore of the order.62 What potentially appears in history is the truth of the divine order (which is always a truth of what originally is). Similarly, the articulation of these settings in terms of the 'enigma of Nature' must not be taken to mean that the throne room is some vaguely naturalistic re-creation of a grove of trees on a mountain. These reliefs were erected only two centuries before Greek philosophy would begin to speak of nature (physis) as the essence of reality would (as in our expression 'the nature of something). The mimetic distance of the ancient Near East is itself re-enacted in the reflective distance of philosophy (to which the dramatic structure of Plato's dialogues eloquently attest). Assyrian ornament moves within the concrete, metaphorical thinking of the pre-philosophic period; and it has a significant role to play in the disclosure of meaning, alongside ritual and cere? monial praxis, and language. The evidence for a reciprocity between humans (or, more likely, anthropomorphic deities) and this tree is scattered, coming from various periods and various quarters of the Mediterranean and the Near East.63 At any event, the characteristic arrangement, in the classical temple, of stylobate (mountain) and column row, and the various elements of the column could hardly take as the basis of their meaning Vitruvius' benign little fables concerning people and plants, coupled to fastidious regulation of modules. All the ele? ments of the three horizons of temporality which we have sketched out are present, but his effort to situate the whole meaning within the physiognomy of the architecture has led him astray. Similarly, the capacity, centuries later, for this type of ornament to attract the genetic numerologies and geometric sequences of analogia/ proportio or logos/ratio, and the speculation which attends that work, could only sustain itself within a fundamental concern for the embodiment of temporality, manifest as a structure of mediation between origins and oriented time, between eternity and the possi? bility of history. When, finally, I suggest that Le Corbusier's work shows evid? ence of this ancient tradition of ornament, I am not thinking only of his plans (and particularly the purist paintings) and their simi? larity to the way in which ornament was designed (Figs. 1-4),64 nor only of the fundamental place of the tree in his writings and drawings, nor of his involvement of approximately fifteen years with the metamorphosis of the bull, but more generally of the 54 content of his standard diagram for the Modulor (Fig. 5). This diagram is an iconographic summary of the content of the Modulor, ind was more important to Le Corbusier than the use of the Vlodulor in practice. In other words, it is more of a speculative icon :han a prescription for design. No doubt inspired by such items as :he 'Vitruvian Man'65 drawings of the Renaissance, and by the similar but more elaborate drawings of Robert Fludd, the Modulor diagram shows a geometrical matrix established as the fundamental structure of division (temporality) within a black and white context, :he blue and red (as it happens) series represented as a generative, spiral-like figure, and a naked man. The paradigmatic status of this man depends upon his potential to fulfil his role in history and upon :he analogies Le Corbusier heaps upon dimensions and pro? portions; but, allowing for his great distance from ancient thinking [we have hinted to how much of a barrier Vitruvius represents), this configuration may be taken as an attempt to see as a necessary unity [he three horizons of temporality.

(Uffizzi, Florence) Botticelli's so-called Primavera (Fig. 9) has been described as a metamorphosis of the Platonic eros, and therefore, following Plotinus and Ficino, of the soul (embodied in the central figure of Venus):66 Since breath and spirit are but one afflatus (the Latin word spiritus signify? ing both), Zephyr [descending from darkness at the right to initiate the transformation of Chloris into Flora] and Mercury [the psychopomp, pointing with a version of his caduceus up and out of the picture to the left] represent two phases of one periodically recurring process. What descends to earth as the breath of passion returns to heaven in the spirit of contemplation. Between these extremes unfold the triadic movements [recapitulated in the dance of the Graces] characteristic of the Theologica Platonica ... the three phases of the Neoplatonic dialectic: emanatio-conversio-remeatio; that is, 'procession' in the descent from Zehpyr to Flora, 'conversion' in the dance of the Graces, and 'reascent' in the figure of Mercury.67 Plato saw that the transcendence of the Ideas required that one account for the nature of participation in them; the Neoplatonic doc? trine of emanation is one such account. Inspired in part by Plato's own use of myth, this philosophical problem is played out here as a natural cycle of rebirth (from which the Primavera derived its title). Two issues arise: the general relation of the philosphical speculation to its natural embodiment, and the relevance of the: death that attends the cycle of metamorphosis. AA FILES</page><page sequence="8">Lucent, or translucent, mythical figures re-enact a stage of this cycle in a strange setting: a blossoming meadow in a dark grove of golden apple trees.68 The boughs of these trees form a central arch, which seems to rise from the figures identified by Edgar Wind as Pulchritude and Flora, creating an opening of light behind Venus, and a recess in front of her. The aureole of light is screened by a vine (myrtle?) which clusters about the figure of Venus. The configur? ation echoes the vine-tree of the Assyrian wall-painting and reliefs, with the ancient potential for the vine-tree to become an anthropo? morphic deity (as the symbol of metamorphosis) here fulfilled in Venus. The trees seem to make both a unitary woven facade (at the top) and a sequential apse (at the bottom).69 Morning light is associated with ascent on the left, and evening darkness with the fecundating descent on the right. What is presented as a symbol within the aureole is enacted as a dramatic sequence in the rest of the space. This lighting of an open region within the darkness of nature establishes a spielraum, or 'playspace', for the drama of the soul. We are not, then, only regarding a version of what will eventually be canonized as the Satyric theatre set, or even of what might be seen as the programme of most Italian Renaissance gardens. We are in the presence of something more fundamental, for which the details of Florentine Neoplatonic speculation are merely a guide to the complexities. First, the depicted event is manifest in a painting, and, it might be offered, is more compelling as a painting than would be the masque to which some commentators suggest it is related. The first horizon of spielraum is therefore the painting itself. This, however, is situated between what is disclosed in mythi? cal and philosophical texts, on the one hand, and what is both preserved and promised in Nature, on the other. In this light, the ambiguities regarding the moment of death in the painted cycle are best resolved in favour of an always prevailing tension between the revealing of the foreground and the concealing of the background. Concealing-preserving Nature (physis) is both the womb or matrix from which measured discourse (logos) arises, and the tomb to which it returns, where it is preserved for rebirth.70 It is a condition of human finitude that there is no revealing without a concealing,71 and that therefore the lighting opening, the rift in the concealment, takes on the quality of an interior whose boundaries lead to related and analogous revelations, but whose most remote frontiers are the security and fear that is the depth of darkness and earth.72 It is this primordial situation that is re-enacted as the spielraum, whose integrity resides in its mimetic distance from the temporality of praxis.13 Despite the similarity to our earlier terminology, I do not believe that in the Primavera we are considering exactly the same phenomenon. To be sure, there are similarities between the Assyrian throne room or court oriented to or by the sacred tree and the spielraum of Botticelli's metamorphosis of the soul bounded by the grove of golden apple trees. We have already observed the coincidence of the vine-tree and the central configuration of the Primavera. One could also adduce some similarity between the ceremonial or ritual content of the court or throne room and the ceremony attached to the main rooms of Renaissance villas and palaces.74 In the fifteenth century panel paintings were commis? sioned for particular occasions and settings, and it appears that the Primavera was of a pair with Botticelli's Birth of Venus. It is pos? sible that they were in the same room.75 With respect to basic func? tion, then, the difference between the wall-paintings or orthostats and the panel-paintings is less extreme than first appearances might suggest. Obviously, the whole cultural horizon has shifted between the fifteenth century bc and the fifteenth century ad, but the similarities demand that we account for the differences in proximate terms. In the first place, one hesitates to use the term spielraum for the earlier AA FILES 22 Situation, even though the boundaries between ritual, ceremony and festival are as hard to draw in the later as in the earlier period. What makes the difference is the presence of something like theatre as it developed in Greece. The principal difference between the earlier representations and this one is that the latter, with its agon16 of mythical figures, recapitulates the whole content. With the advent of the theatre, re-enactment takes on a new character, a more global and more reflective emancipation from the primary context. The universality which is claimed for the theatre and its layout, the pervasiveness of the scenae frons in all aspects of architectural representation, first in the Hellenistic period, then again from the Renaissance onward, is less indebted to a particular arrangement of forms than it is to a particular conception of universality.77 This would not have been possible had not logos become established as the authoritative spielraum (approximately from the seventh to the fifth centuries bc, in Greece). The horizon of reference of logos en? compassed whatever could be imagined and was that in which the highest truths were disclosed. It became the fundamental domain of continuity, from family life through political, judicial and religious life, to the theatre and philosophy.78 Not only does this begin to be acknowledged at about the same time as the theatre emancipates itself from its ritual origins; but it is during this period as well (in the work of the physikoi) that the kosmos is disclosed as such79 and nature begins to lose many of its distinctions and paniculate relationships to specific themes, becoming globally distinguished with respect to logos.m Renaissance theoreticians such as Vasari and Lomazzo preserved this reciprocity of logos and physis in the conception of a complete work of art as a reciprocity of word (mediated by rhetoric) and image (mediated by perspective). The making of a work of art could take on the character of the Christian eschaton, such that the fusion of word and image would carry the senses of the fusion of soul and body, and, ultimately, of divine and human.81 To this extent does Christianity affect the cyclical drama of disclosing logos and pre? serving physis, outlined above. We have so far referred to the 'play' of the three horizons of tem? porality, in recognition of the fact that it was taken for granted that the structure itself was held to be transcendent. It is difficult to see, for example, that any conception of time as such was available to the peoples of the ancient Near East. Rather, the concrete vehicles of its manifestation articulated the modalities of temporality; and orna? ment was one of the primary spheres of speculation, in accordance with the fundamental significance of certain settings and artefacts to the integrity of the whole.82 The experience of time as such seems to have attended the emancipation of logos. However, if the Pla? tonic rendering of time as 'the mimesis of eternity'83 may be situ? ated between Anaximander's temporal ordination of the justice of becoming and being, on one hand, and, on the other, the Aristo? telian speculation on time as the number of motion,84 all three seek to preserve the cosmic meaning of temporality. As a result of a long process of reinterpretation of this meaning, however, in the Renais? sance the temporality of regeneration begins to lose credibility, and the role of mediation is displaced to spatial distributions of analogy. The mid-sixteenth-century Villa d'Este at Tivoli exemplifies the new understanding.85 The garden is structured about a primary iconography distributed about a hill, and a secondary iconography comprising a journey up the hill which appears to be a re-enactment of the Choice of Hercules (Figs. 10, 11). This journey crosses two great lateral divisions, both of which are focused about water. The journey begins at the bottom of the hill, passing through an elaborate garden comprising four labyrinths, two either side of a large central square. This is divided into four quarters, the smaller 55</page><page sequence="9">10. Villa d'Este, Tivoli. Engraving by Duperac, 1575. 77. Iconographic map of the Villa d'Este. squares being the same size as the labyrinths. What therefore amounts to a total of eight smaller squares are all also divided into four quarters. This reciprocity between a four-quartered symbol? ism and purposeful dramatic action (the primary structure is traced out in paths) in a setting framed by vines and trees therefore re? capitulates something of what we have seen earlier, except for the great emphasis here upon the journey as the primary metaphor for dramatic action. What is revealed in the labyrinths as a sequential development, and fraught with doubt, is presented in the central square as a structured hierarchy, with an elaborate arrangement of portals, bowers and pavilions, culminating in a bowered tempietto at its centre. The dialectics embodied in this lower garden establish a thematic horizon for the rest. Coffin rightly argues that the first great lateral division is to be 56 identified with Nature, and in particular the sea, or Okeanos, although a certain amount of qualification is needed. The lateral sequence begins on the eastern ridge.86 At the crest of this ridge was an elaborate facade in the form of what might be termed a 'chthonic triumphal arch', which held the cistern and the mechanics of a water-organ, and sheltered a tempietto containing a statue of the Diana of Ephesus in the central niche and Apollo and Orpheus87 in the two minor niches to either side (celestial and chothonic, specu? lative and emotive music, respectively). Without going into the details of their relationship, it is clear that natura naturans (gener? ative nature) has been brought into relation with a musical icono? graphy of a kind familiar from the musical theorist Gafurius.88 From a temporal point of view, this indicates that generative nature has been placed in a context which possesses a modulated structure AA FILES 22</page><page sequence="10">between the chaos of Okeanos and Apollonian harmony.89 Like a moat, this Okeanos must be crossed in order to attain the higher strata of the garden. The second great lateral division is about two-thirds of the way up the hill. Coffin's view is that its iconography 'is devoted to art'; however, it appears that its unifying theme resides in the various manifestations of logos.90 At its west? ern and eastern extremes, it displays the great humanist tension between History (in the Rometta) and Poetry (in the Parnassus Fountain, where perhaps one should refer to 'inspired discourse', since the central alignment comprises, in the basin, Venus, affiliated with Rhetoric,91 emerging from her shell; above her, the oracular utterances of the Albunean Sybil; and, above her, Pegasus, leaping from the Mount and creating the source of waters). Between the Rometta and Parnassus extended a three-tiered fountain whose main iconography illustrated scenes from Ovid's Metamorphoses (the terracotta reliefs are now worn away and obscured by moss). Ovid's text, of course, rearranges the simultaneity of classical myths, presenting them as a linear evolution, or metamorphosis. As the primary context for classical culture, these stories are the great counterpart to Okeanos, the matrix for nature. In its representation as a single narrative,, the oriented temporality of the mythic context confronts the latent temporality of Okeanos. The great fresco of the garden (Fig. 12), which occupies the western wall of the Salotto, appears to intend this play between logos and physis. The garden is viewed from the crest of the eastern ridge and the view is divided in half ? or joined ? by a gre*at central tree standing against a field of light, which may be taken as a distant echo of the tree with which we have been preoccupied.92 The primary iconography begins in the east, descending as physis to the west, ascending by way of the artes of design and of politics, and then proceeds back from the west as logos, reascending finally in the east with Pegasus leaping to heaven at the top of the Parnassus fountain. This suggests the sort of cosmic cycle which we have seen in the Primavera. The visitor who re-enacts the Choice of Hercules ascends from north to south, always moving towards the sun, but also recapitulating the crossing movement of the primary icono? graphy, from the Grotto of Venus to the Grotto of Diana93 at the end of the journey. Hercules is of course the hero par excellence, who, through successfully completing the agon of his deeds, was ad? mitted to the company of the gods. As such, he could be taken as an analogue for Christ and a type for the Christian life; and this may have been recognized in the final ascent to the cloister of the medi? eval monastery which formed the nucleus of the Este building.94 We are, it appears, in the presence of another metamorphosis of the soul. The first innovation here is that, compared with the earlier ex? amples, the result is both more literal (one must actually perform a species of pilgrimage across the site) and more abstract (the ultimate horizon of meaning resides in the tension between logos and physis). In contrast to the earlier implicit relationship between the content of the dramatic action and that of the ornamental apparatus, here they are explicitly co-ordinated and mapped out across a field which maintains the consistency of its framework from left to right and from bottom to top, like the stratification of a Renaissance facade. This in turn is a consequence of the second innovation, whereby the articulative function of ornament, and its main themes, have be? come established in the primary topography. As a result, everything seems to participate in the iconographic programme,95 creating the sort of enchanted realm that is familiar from ? in descending order of antiquity and profundity ? the Roman de la Rose, the Hypneroto machia, or the Chymical Wedding. The medieval expression 'the book of nature' had extended the style of interpretation developed for the Bible to the physical world; here this metaphor, and the orient? ation to literary metaphor, have become a compelling reality. AA FILES 22 12. Fresco in the Salotto of the Villa a"Este, depicting a view of the palace and gardens. The deeper humanist background to this phenomenon indicates that the Villa was not simply an intellectual exercise, a hugely expensive private Eden or Hesperides to console Ippolito d'Este for his failure to be elected pope, or an elaborate testimony to the powers of invention of art. Rather, all these are brought into play by more profound motifs. Ozment has shown that, consequent to the rupture of the ontological relationship to God in Nominalist thought, two alternatives to the renewal of meaning emerged: mys? ticism, in which one emptied oneself of the world, and humanism, in which one cultivated the world of human affairs, the life of praxis.96 The special status accorded to the practical life found its paradigmatic setting in the theatre, which was seen to be elevated above everyday affairs but removed from heaven. In fact, the peculiar qualities of this domain promoted a reciprocity with mysticism, as we have seen. Moreover, the expression 'all the world's a stage' became something of a working reality; and the occultation of the boundary between the spielraum and praxis, between the vita contemplativa and the vita attiva, instituted a remarkable analogical speculation. In his De Hercule eiusque Laboris, Salutati had taken Hercules, the established paradigm for the life of praxis, as the point of departure for proposing that scientia, properly understood, was to be identified with the work of the nine Muses.97 Similarly, Manetti was among the most forceful in promoting the view that the work of homo faber bore a strong analogy to the divine creation.98 It is, however, Leonardo Bruni who most succinctly touches the nerve of the proposition.99 Bruni's deep understanding of Rhetoric enabled him to argue that language is grounded in the human situations of praxis. The power of ingegnum, and therefore of metaphor, is that it instantly spots the similitudes, the unity in diversity, needed to make judgements and decisions. These decisions are the very essence of the practical life. During the time of indecision, the domain of evil, forgetfiilness, misunder? standing, fear and disorientation is alive; and it is the matrix from which arises its opposite. Precisely because evil and good have equal value only during indecision, the domain of goodness, con? tinuity with one's past, understanding, confidence and orientation is the very content, or meaning, of decision. In other words, what is re-enacted in each decision is what is at issue in culture itself: the disclosure of order. What is held to be good in a general sense is what is universal, which is both reaffirmed and reinterpreted in any 57</page><page sequence="11">13. Stratification of the Fountain of the Dragon, the horizon of logos and Hercules. particular moment of decision.100 What lies prior to the decision, what gives it orientation, and where the truly creative (synthetic, metaphoric) thought prevails, is the formulation of the question. It is in this light that the theme of the Choice of Hercules must be regarded; and at the Villa d'Este the theme is celebrated in the unique and powerful setting of the Fountain of the Dragon. This setting, which occupies the very heart of the garden, is composed of three vertically superimposed layers (Fig. 13). At the lowest level is the fountain itself, the famous oval basin cutting deeply into the hillside, the central four-headed dragon framed by twin stairs whose railings carry flows of water which debouch from the breasts of sphinxes.101 Originally, the water in this open grotto was at its most metamorphic, ranging from gentle fans to the explosive ver? tical jet which still catches the south light against the shadow of the curved retaining wall. Above this passes the second layer: the great lateral division devoted to logos, establishing an upper horizon in the three-tiered fountain devoted to the Metamorphoses. The third level is a small platform which projects from the hill, centrally aligned with the dragon, and high above the Metamorphoses fountain.102 This platform or terrace, sheltered by the adjacent trees, is equipped with two opposed benches, appropriate for a disputd, or exercise of contemplatio. The very end of this platform was occupied by a statue of Hercules holding his club, and cradling the infant Telephos in his other arm.103 Viewing this arrangement from below and reading vertically, we see that the agon of question and decision is embodied in the violent rift in the earth which opens for the metamorphosis of water into light. We are then led upwards, through the horizon of logos carry? ing the mythic context for History and Poetry, to what is effectively the resolution of the question, in the form of an allusion to the apotheosis of Hercules,104 who is suspended out over the garden against a gap of light in the dark trees. With the last element of this configuration we are by now well familiar. What is new is the explicit emphasis upon the earth in relation to the drama of the question within logos. It seems that, as the analogical speculation begins to run away with itself, the ancient symbolic tradition is being deployed as a guide for a quite literal effort at regrounding. If the analogical possibilities have become as dense and as multi foliate as the metamorphoses of water which are the very soul of this garden, the inordinate devotion to paths, nominally a methaphor for 58 a purposive life of praxis, only calls attention to the possibility that the visitor is in fact transformed from Hercules into homo viator, the homeless pilgrim. Hercules' primordial contest with the con? ditions of human finitude has become here a search for those con? ditions, set in an everywhere meaningful, enchanted garden of the world. The very capacity for disclosure, the constitutive power of situated metaphor, threatens to acquire the latent, reiterative tem? porality of the ancient symbols of the mountain or of water, which are of course the very basis of this garden. It is important also to recollect, however, that these are the archaic setting of origins, indeed of the origin of origins. The conflation here of the original Christian paradise (Eden) with the classical paradise marking the Western limits (guarded by the Hesperides) establishes the initial conditions for a more elaborate speculation on origins, in which the apple of the Tree of Knowledge is redeemed in the agon of the Golden Apples of the Hesperides. In accordance with Ozment's rendering of cultural possibilities, we may say that the life of spec? ulation on uni versals is redeemed in the agon of the life of praxis. Following Salutati, we may say that knowledge (scientia, from the Greek episteme) involves the play of all the elements of culture. Following Manetti, we may say that the agenda of the practical life is creativity as such (that is, the drama of origins), whose ultimate destiny is exemplified in the apotheosis of Hercules.105 Following Bruni, and recognizing the deep affinity between the theatre and practical life, we may say not only that ingegnum is the essence (origin) of both poetics and of praxis, but also that metaphor is the essence (origin) of the logos that is the vehicle of both. If what is essential about both physis and metaphor is metamorphosis106 (a concept preserved in the philosopher's stone of the alchemists, which comprises a metamorphosis of matter into knowledge), the metaphoric fusion of word (logos) and image (physis) appropriately carries the Christian incarnational and eschatological content. In view of all this, finally, we recognize that Ligorio's garden is a topo? graphical metaphor for humanist culture, the essence or origins of which reside in the always prevailing reciprocity of physis and logos as the context for a redeeming understanding, through the agon of the question and decision. In other words, everything about the garden is attuned to the thematics of origins as the vessel of renewal. To speak of 'redeem? ing' in this context is not simply to deploy a convenient Christian metaphor. The fundamental sense of this term is the recovery of something lost. The ancient notion of 'buying back' which permits this recovery is rooted in the concrete world of sacrifice, of offer? ings, tribute and the exchange of gifts. This milieu of analogical reciprocities is interrelated as a matter of measure, in the context of the vicissitudes of human relations. It constitutes a primitive form of logos, not yet differentiated from physis; and it begins to account for why Anaximander can speak of redemption as a matter of cos? mic justice and time, and why Second Isaiah, at about the same date (late seventh to early sixth centuries bc), can speak of redemption as creation. From this perspective, it is possible to see that what is in play in Ligorio's garden bears comparison with the ancient sense of redemption, guided by the Christian emphasis upon redemption as rebirth and reconciliation with God. However, the Christian emphasis discloses here its own indebtedness to much older specu? lation. The disclosure of order that we saw in the drama of the ques? tion always involves the illumination of origins. The concern for origins is always both a return to essences and a return in the tem? poral sense: a recovery of time, that is, of a just measure, or, in Platonic terms, of a mediated relationship to the Highest Good. The disclosure of Order corresponds to the recovery of an orientation with respect to the whole, or kosmos.

The Modulor (Paris, 1954) and translated by de Francia and Bostock (Cam? bridge, Mass., 1966), pp. 29-31. The latter two paragraphs are from his article 'L'Espace indicible' (1945), which in turn grew out of work on a book of the same title, which never appeared. These passages were repeated twice in Modulor 2 (pp. 25 et seq., and p. 207 of the Harvard University Press edition of 1966). Finally, these passages from 'L'Espace indicible' also appear in English under the title of 'Ineffable Space', in The New World of Space, edited by Reynal and Hitchcock (New York and Boston, Mass., 1948), pp. 7-9. 2. The Modulor, p. 33, citing his 'Des yeux qui ne voient pas', from L'Esprit nouveau (1920) and what he renders as 'Vers une architecture nouvelle', 1923. 3. The Modulor, p. 31, also from the 1945 article. The extreme dialectic between logic and turmoil, between the grid and spurting lines, seems to antedate 'L'Espace indicible' by at least a decade (that is, the mid 1930s), and the nucleus of the idea is present from very early days. In the Appendix to The Modulor, p. 209, Le Corbusier, after observing that the measurements of the Parthenon do not seem to conform to the Modulor, describes the temple as 'the meeting-place of all possible nuances ... a true sculpture and not just a building ... [it is] not a construction based chiefly and of necessity on the recurrence of numbers, like, for instance, a cathedral, the Eiffel Tower; or the Unite d'Habitation of Marseilles.' In Modulor 2, the Unite d'Habitation at Marseilles is described as an 'ex? plosion of architectural facts whereby beauty and poetic emotion are infi? nitely multiplied' (op. cit. p. 232). Later, it is 'a bridge thrown down between the middle ages and ourselves' (p. 304). At the conclusion of the April 1948 special issue of L'Architectured'Aujourd'hui, entitled 'Unite', the Parthenon and Chartres cathedral are both depicted as paradigms for the Unite (as temple of the Second Machine Age). Despite the apparent contradiction in these two paragraphs with regard to the Unite at Marseilles, it appears that, as the reading tends towards the metaphorical temple, the possibility for 'explosive' effects increases. The Phillips Pavilion obviously conforms to this pattern, Ronchamp and La Tourrette do so more subtly. The issue affects several areas of Le Corbusier's iconography, including that of the 'sacred'. 4. The Modulor, p. 220. The expression 'crossing of the ways' is one of the avatars of the angle droit; see Le Poeme de Tangle droit (1953), section C2. 5. Ibid. p. 71. 6. The matter of content is justified through music, and proportionality, citing, among others, Rameau: 'Music is not part of mathematics; on the contrary, it is the sciences which are part of music, for they are founded on proportion, and the resonance of the body of sound engenders all proportion.' (ibid. p. 74). Versions of this idea can be found in Le Corbusier's earliest works; needless to say, he regards it as the basis of the Pythagorean tradition of symbolic thinking. 7. Although Le Corbusier may be thinking of Schelling or of Hegel, the phrase shares a certain tendency of religious thinking itself to regard the nature of the divine as something systematic, which is perceived to be its 'structure', and which in turn provides for the nature of participation in the hidden god. Le Corbusier uses two terms for God, the 'Creator' (an emphasis which fuses the God of Genesis with a theme that is to be traced back through the Hermetic literature to Neoplatonism and ultimately the Platonic-Pythagorean demi ourgos) and 'The Great Unknown' ('Le Grand Inconnu', with echoes here of Le Corbusier's fondness for A. Carrel's L'Homme cet inconnu (Paris, 1936)). In this conception of 'the sacred' (as Le Corbusier preferred over 'the religious'), the knowledge pertaining to matters of creativity is regarded as a 'key' to universal truths. This knowledge, or gnosis, transforms the problem of the reciprocity of divine and human into a dialectic of unknown and known, and allows it to become thematized as pure structure. In this regime, math? ematics has pride of place, as that which most clearly represents this form of structure, and provides for the character (potential certainty) by which all other analogical possibilites might be related. 8. The Modulor, p. 71. This is certainly one sense of the meaning of 'radiant', applied to cities, buildings and farms in Le Corbusier's work. 9. The main purpose of the brise-soleil (sunbreakers) was to generate shadows in the interiors of buildings: 'Cette pellicule [that is, the brise-soleil, here also referred to as 'un veritable parasol' and 'une coquille'] n'a qu'un ob jectif, celui de projeter de l'ombre, ? travers un espace libre, sur le plafond des locaux habites au-dessous' (Oeuvre complete, vol. V, p. 188). 10. I, however, tend to agree with Le Corbusier's claim that he held to his poetic intentions from the earliest days. During his career he progressively found ways of both visualizing and putting into words concepts that, in the earlier work, appear to be composed of fragments, borrowed or otherwise. 11. On this point, see 'Natura Morta', Modulus 20, 1991. In brief, there are a series of oppositions which lie at the heart of Le Corbusier's representational procedures ? for instance, female/male, curved/straight, blue/red, prone/ erect, ambiguous darkness/oriented light, to name a few at random. The principle itself is represented in the joining of the right and left hands of the plate which accompanies Section A5 of the Poeme de I 'angle droit, and it plays a significant role both here and elsewhere in the text. It moves within the long history of dialectical thinking; but in Le Corbusier one detects the gnostic effort to overcome the oppositions, to transcend the finitude which they declare. 12. TheModulor, p. 32. 13. Ibid. p. 74. The first two appositional clauses of this quotation are also ap? plied to the 'Sun, master of our lives', in the Poeme de I 'angle droit (AI), and the section of The Radiant City entitled 'Laws', which formed the basis of the opening portions of the Poeme. The sun is the origin of measure for Le Corbusier because it 'brutally' divides the day into two parts, the basis of all further division (the drawings for this part of the Poeme make clear that the reticulations of harmonic divisions in his grids are meant to embody this temporal content). 14. The ambiguities here may arise from his possible substitution of 'harmony' for the nous and phronesis of Plato's Philebus 28d. See note 17. 15. The rendering is unorthodox, but consistent with what we observed earlier: one would expect the universe to be understood as the one, individuals as the many. He may have picked up the expression Tautre' from contemporary philosophical discussions in Paris; his usage shares its ambiguity concerning the transcendent. 16. The Modulor, pp. 74-5. The expression from the book of Revelations (8:1, at the opening of the Seventh Seal) reappeared in his 'testament spirituel' (1965, full text in Mise au point, edited by J. Petit (Geneva, 1987), p. 61). It may be argued that this half-hour is not isolated from 'cosmic time', but represents it essentially. The main point, however, is that Le Corbusier ack? nowledges the difference. 17. Ibid. p. 75. Once again, Le Corbusier seems to have the Philebus in mind. However, what for Le Corbusier is a question of composing with elements is, for Plato, a preliminary explication of the problems of the disclosure of the reciprocity of the one and the many through dialectic. Plato, at 17bff., shows how the unity of voiced sound differentiates into the letters of 'grammar' and the tones of music. Proper discussion of the relationship between Le Cor? busier and Plato is beyond the scope of these notes. Two items bear mentioning, however. First, at 16c, Plato calls the art of dialectic a 'gift of the gods, a Promethean fire'. Le Corbusier deploys this imagery in Modulor 2, p. 156, citing Aeschylus) and in the Poeme, Section B2, devoted to the Mod? ulor. Second, what Plato says at 17a (concerning the need to pay attention to the intermediate structure between the limited and the unlimited, between the one and the many) may be taken as a motto for this essay. 18. This particular metaphor together with those relating to 'fusion' possesses a crucial importance in the Poeme, where they indicate the moments of recon? ciliation of opposites, of primary metamorphosis, of metaphor. 19. No. 895 ( F27 December 1952), Le Corbusier Sketchbooks, vol. 2 (London and Paris, 1981). The basic principle is quite old in his thought, going back to his notion of 'caracteres' as it appears, for example, in La Ville radieuse, and as it still identifies the E section of the Poeme. The formulation of the Signs seems to have occurred to him while considering his 'bestiary' (nos. 700, 702, 707; F 24 March 1952; Le Corbusier Sketchbooks, vol. 2): 'intuitively over the past 20 years I have evolved my figures in the direction of animal forms, vehicles of character, force of the sign, algebraic capacity for entering into a relationship between themselves and thereby producing 1 poetic phenomenon'.

He regularly insists on his own geometrical construction of the Modulor dia? gram, against more rigorous versions, because 'the data were such as might be conceivable for a grid of proportions, namely: Man-with-arm upraised ? 2 squares of 113' (Modulor 2, pp. 47-8). 22. No. 855 (F26, November 1952), Le Corbusier Sketchbooks, vol. 2. The identi? fication here of nature with the 'cosmic', and the distinction between human and cosmic, is symptomatic of the larger issue. Anciently, earth and men, sky and gods were intracosmic. The cosmos prevails within the reciprocal tran? scendence of the given embodiment of physis and the potential disclosure of truth. Le Corbusier has treated the potential disclosure of truth as something given in nature, manifested furthermore as a code or system of signs. AA FILES 22 59</page><page sequence="13">23. The marital and procreative metaphor of the passage from The Modulor has 2 here given way to a single order. On the other hand, what was contained in that metaphor ? a distant descendant of the Platonic eros ? must now be imported, or 'implanted'. 24. These are among the topics of 'Typology and the Good', forthcoming in the Festschrift honouring Alan Colquhoun. 25. Consistent with the programme of situating the Modulor within the domain of immediate experience, Le Corbusier declares that it 'operates with "appreci? ated" measures' (Modulor, p. 177). The relation to music is established in similar terms: 'architecture is judged by eyes that see, by the head that turns, and the legs that walk. Architecture is not a synchronic phenomenon but a successive one, made up of pictures adding themselves one to the other, following each other in time and space, like music' (ibid. p. 73) ? Similarly the Modulor is made an affair of the body in two ways. First, as is well known, Le Corbusier insists upon the affiliation of the proportional ? progression, which is a numerological affair, with a geometrical represent? ation (generated by superimposing a square upon two adjacent squares of the same size, according to the 'golden' ? hence, Modul-Or ? ratio). This is then accorded a scale and given dimensions, such that a side of the initial square is nominally the distance from ground to navel of a standing man. Again, human dimensions are taken as the basis of human content, as the basis of a ratio which reconciles 'the individual with the cosmos'. Second, in his pursuit of the musical basis of harmony, Le Corbusier trans? lated what he imagined to be the literally aural content of the Pythagorean original into a species of visual equivalent. On pp. 79ff. of The Modulor, he ; develops a geometry of visual perception which takes the form of a logarith? mically divided cone of vision. In this way the symbolism of aural perception (which conventionally was represented a line or string divided proportion? ally, according to the intervals of an octave) was converted to visual perception. However, the Modulor does not appear to manifest the traditional musical intervals, despite all the claims made for affinities to that discipline. The point, however, is less to carry on in the existing 'tradition' than it is to be another Pythagoras (and/or Vitruvius), to found a new tradition (for which reason Modulor 2 concludes with the 'Metastasis' of Xenakis). 26. The Modulor, p. 74. Disagreeing with Dali, he remarked, 'Travailler n'est pas une punition, travailler c'est respirer' (C. Petit, Le Corbusier lui-meme (Geneva, 1970), pp. 160, 186). On the basis of this equality, we perceive another effort to affiliate the work/breathing of the artist with that of the universe. 27. As compared, for example, with the work of Louis Kahn, for whom the mani? festation of rhythm at all scales of the work tends to suggest the (re)iterative internal consistency of a crystal (a significant iconographic motif in the twen? tieth century, of course) applied to materials of the earth, on which see the second part of this article, to be published in AA Files no. 23, July 1992. There is a question as to whether the procedure institutes a reflective calm by contrast to the more chaotic context, or whether it is not merely the equal but opposite of that context. 28. The first of these appear in some of his earliest paintings and, in a slightly dif? ferent form, became the basis of the modulor. In Modulor 2 he calls attention to the autonomy of the geometric configuration from the boundaries of the canvas, the marginal articulation often being deployed as an iconographic element in its own right in the later paintings and lithographs. Both the shifted square and the marginal work are to be found in Villa Stein at Garches. Of the matrices more related to the literary work, the Poeme de I 'angle droit exhibits the most elaborate arrangement, with an odd-even numerological scheme (something which also appears in the serial aspects of his archi? tecture, such as levels or column-fields), a visual profile recalling a tree and a descending-ascending structure, all sustaining the linear narrative of the text. 29. The fusion of abstract system and agon, or contest, in the plan, for Le Cor? busier, is apparent as early as the well-known formulation in Towards a New Architecture, translated by Etchells (London, 1927), p. 166: 'The plan is really a cluster of ideas and of the intention essential to this cluster of ideas ... the plan is the determination of everything; it is an austere abstraction, an algebrazation, and cold of aspect. It is a plan of battle. The battle follows and that is the great moment. The battle is composed of the impact of masses in space and the morale of the army is the cluster of predetermined ideas and the driving purpose.' From the late 1920s the emphasis shifts. In both the paint? ings and the architecture, the agon becomes more explicit, and the geometric matrix more implicit, than in the earlier work. The possibility should not be excluded that the battle imagery recalls the Vitruvian ordinatione (from or do), from the Greek taxis, both of which carry the sense of ranks of troops. 0. Strictly speaking, temporal fulfilment has traditionally been the province of a cultural paradigm or symbol (for example Heavenly Jerusalem). It is my belief that Le Corbusier seeks some sort of equivalent. Since I am here speaking only of intentions, I will not analyse the merits of the proposition. I have looked at some of the aspects of this problem in other essays. The importance of practical action to Le Corbusier's vision of renewal is manifest in his texts throughout his career. The man of creative action is en? nobled as the man of droiture in the Poeme. Here his uprightness against the horizon, his uprightness in affairs, and so forth, is woven into the other puns available to the term 'droit' (most notably i'angle droit') to attain a simul? taneity of readings. The realm in which these meanings play out their con? sequences is essentially the microcosm I have sketched out here. i 1. A good selection may be found in Le Corbusier le passe ? reaction poetique (Paris, 1988). 12. And upon the Roman Renaissance generally, which 'fell asleep after Michael angelo . . . Rome is the damnation of the half-educated.' Towards a New Architecture, op. cit. pp. 160-1. He appears to be damning everything which happened in Mannerism and the baroque, since the Palazzo Barberini and the Galleria Colonna are included in the list. What is interesting about this group is that it is composed entirely of interior wall or vault frescos (the Palazzo Barberini is represented by the east cove of Cortona's vault ? Pallas destroy? ing Insolence and Pride, as it happens). This sort of work, and the related quadratura, is one of the crucial stages in achieving the representational syn? thesis upon which Le Corbusier unknowingly depends. \3. According to Modulor 2, this defect arises in the Renaissance. \4. The structuring of a garden on the basis of architectural ordering is as old as the earliest gardens, and their close reciprocity from the point of view of sym? bolism may be seen in such diverse examples as the Egyptian temple or the eighteenth-century bc 'investiture' fresco from the palace of Zimrilim, Mari, now in the Louvre. What distinguishes Vignola's effort is that this reciprocity transpires within the larger whole of the perspectival/rhetorical represent? ational synthesis. The ground is prepared, so to speak, by Bramante at the Vatican and by Raphael and Sangallo the younger at Villa Madama; and the issue is in the air in any event during the mid fifteenth century, as Ligorio's Villa d'Este at Tivoli demonstrates. Essential to the whole group is the inspir? ation of the city-palace-garden-theatre-temple of Palestrina, the Renaissance iconographic understanding of which has now been clarified by R. Potter ('The Goddess Fortuna and the Iconography of the Belvedere Courtyard', forthcoming). Much of what he has uncovered seems to confirm what has been proposed forthe Villa d'Este in the present essay. $5. His indebtedness to several aspects of nineteenth-century life (for example, the importance of mechanized transport to cities, cafes, the status of the museum, etc.) and its architecture (for example Choisy, certain elements of Ecole terminology, the notion of a block of flats ? including his own flat) is not immediately apparent in his own pronouncements. 36. In itself this is not of course a new idea. Having its roots in ancient con? ceptions of the renewal of time, it acquires a new status with the humanist attitude to the classical past, and attains the form which corresponds to Le Corbusier's understanding with German Romanticism, towards the end of the eighteenth century. Twentieth-century primitivism includes not only tribal art (the problem Le Corbusier formulates as 'primitive means, not primitive men'), but also the dispossessed in contemporary society, more primitive representational techniques, and what might be indelicately termed as primi? tive mental states such as the dream or madness. All of these are present in Picasso's Demoiselles d'Avignon. 37. For example, we have already seen that, while The Modulor makes great play of the Pythagorean iconography of musical harmony and its possible embodi? ment in visual proportions, the Modulor itself contains none of the usual increments. Rather, it is justified experientially in respect of what is called the logarithmic cone of vision (see note 25). The resulting reticulations of squares and rectangles are implicitly carrying a Pythagorean iconography, meant to be embodied in the explicit rhythmic matrix which, finally, structures the ambiguities of cubist space and the location of buildings, etc. To the original analogy between a Pythagorean-Platonic symbolic numerology and musical intervals is added that between musical intervals and linear dimensions. This much may be said to have been accomplished in the familiar Renaissance pro? portional schemes. To this Le Corbusier adds various items of logarithmic iconography (for example plant growth, which thereby becomes a living example of ornamental symbolism) and orients the proposition around vision. The cone of vision therefore prevails in analogical reciprocity with the expanding series of the Modulor. Some of this material had accumulated in medieval and Renaissance light and optical symbolism, but Le Corbusier 60 AA FILES 22</page><page sequence="14">displaces the point of this tradition to tangible human experience. The original was worked out as an ontological and eschatological measure of the relationship of human beings to God, who is a very ambiguous presence in the work of Le Corbusier (see note 7). The axonometric or isometric projection plays a dual role in this scheme. It is the heart of the cubist spatial ambiguities, which, by virtue of the emphasis upon frontality, implicates the horizonal emphasis of the visual works in the proportional analogies, and structures perception accord? ingly (logarithmic perception finds its home in the harmonies of a domain orchestrated by the Modulor). Second, orthographic projection is the province not only of architecture, but also of technological production. This projective scheme, as the vehicle of design, is one of the means by which art and tech? nology are reconciled, since in Le Corbusier's vocabulary production and creation are virtually synonymous. Finally, the whole matrix (literally, 'womb'), as the arena in which a design works itself out, is an analogy for creation and creativity in a larger sense. This is one of the reasons that the sea is so important to Le Corbusier: the matrix is a kind of Okeanos from which order emerges, and which is perceived in the terms of the ambiguous latency of space keyed to horizons, and oriented by the intentions of the inhabitant. 38. Oppenheim, writing of the cult images in temples (Ancient Mesopotamia: Portrait of a Dead Civilization (Chicago, 1964), pp. 185-6): 'We know from Mesopotamian and Egyptian sources that images were fashioned and repaired in special workshops in the temple; they had to undergo an elaborate and highly secret ritual of consecration to transform the lifeless matter into a receptacle of the divine presence. During these nocturnal [the calendar day began at even? ing] ceremonies they were endowed with 'life', their eyes and mouths were 'opened' so that the images could see and eat. . . etc' Oppenheim (op. cit. pp. 172-83) offers useful cautionary remarks concern? ing interpretation of Mesopotamian religious life, under two headings: the nature of the evidence (he reminds us how unclear is the 'purpose' of the zig gurat) and the problem of 'Western man's' inability and unwillingness to understand the 'plurality of intellectual and spiritual dimensions that sets off most of the higher polytheistic religions from the narrowness, the one dimensional pressure of revealed religions'. Whether these are relevant to what follows, the reader may decide. Oppenheim's arguments on 'the common man' are outside our present concerns; but one may agree with his argument that the mythical material is 'sublimated and symbolised' in the visual representations, without subscribing to his view that 'the world of myth remains relegated to the level of literary creation throughout the entire known history of Mesopotamia'. In what this literary activity consists we are not told, nor how it could prevail in the absence of an attention to content. The stability of the latter (within the historical processes mapped out by Jacobsen in Treasures of Darkness (New Haven, Conn., 1983)) indicates either a perverse conservatism on the part of the authors or an attunement to the meaning of the material that is indistinguish? able from mythic narration and speculation. Incidentally, the reader should be warned that my own competence in these matters does not include being able to read the ancient languages in the original. 39. In Crete and Mycenae a column often takes the position of the tree, best known from the Lion Gate at Mycenae (and the RIB A insignia). A related scene which appears in Sumerian glyptic from the third millennium, and frequently there? after, shows a large standing man holding two lions by their necks. Scholars usually describe this figure as a hero, and sometimes as Gilgamesh (who, beyond the epic which bears his name, carries the title of 'judge of the under? world' on at least one tablet). Whatever the case may be, the similarity of the scene to that involving the tree ? though not to underrate the differences ? suggests that the two configurations have a common meaning. An example published by Moortgat (among others) indicates the scope of the problem (The Art of Ancient Mesopotamia (London, 1969, translated by Filson from Cologne, 1967)). His Plate B.l a, b, a cylinder seal from the Jamdat Nasr period (found at Uruk, in fact), shows two wild oxen rising either side of a bearded and coiffed man wearing a woven skirt. He clutches to his breast two branches, each with four rosettes (like our example from Ur), whose main stems trace a large curved X across the body (a pattern very similar to that traced in representations of the Two Rivers). The place of the mountain (see below) is taken by an altar furnished with ritual vessels; and the scene is framed by woven reed-bundles terminating in a whorl or eyelet, which indicate a cult setting (and which Andrae thought were the origin of the Ionic column). What is here succinctly represented is the point behind ritual: the fusion of the universal and the particular, the divine and the human. In this light ? and bearing in mind that ritual time occupies an intermediate position between the paradigmatic time of the gods and the historical, or prag? matic, time of human beings ? we are surely considering here the fusion of the destiny of the human being with that of the tree. 40. What Frankfort termed 'the "religious landscape" par excellence' (The Art and Architecture of the Ancient Orient, fourth edition (Harmondsworth, 1970) p. 112) is annoyingly unsupported in the scholarly literature, aside from the work of Eliade, van der Leeuw, etc. A useful place to start is with R. J. Clifford, The Cosmic Mountain in Canaan and the Old Testament (Cambridge, Mass., 1972). Clifford clearly worked closely with Jacobsen, whose demonstration, in an earlier work, of the modalities of meaning (what Voegelin felicitously termed, 'a tensional network of analogies') of the reed is a salutary lesson for any attempt to understand complex notions in this culture. It is therefore somewhat surprising that he seems to have counselled Clifford towards localizing, naturalizing and limiting the meaning of something as important as the mountain; however, the same principle appears in his own recent work. It is difficult to see how such a principle could make sense of another seal published by Moorgat (op. cit. Plate N6), one of the few examples of Kassite glyptic from the fourteenth century (but compare contemporary Old Assyrian examples, plates 236, 243). This example is therefore much later, and of a different cultural context, than the Sumerian material, and it even shows cor? relations with Cretan imagery. However, I do not believe we are in the pres? ence of a completely new meaning, but rather of a continuity which sustains itself through re-interpretation and elaboration, something that is charact? eristic of primary symbols. The scene is framed at the top by a row of moun? tains, familiar from later friezes, for example, that on the Apadana staircase at Persepolis. In the main image, the crown, head and arms of a god or god? dess appear at the apex of a pyramidal form, within the confines of whose base a figure kneels in a sort of grotto, formed by an arc of water (or two rivers). The arms of the god or goddess reach out to touch the proffered forepaws of two rampant griffins symmetrically disposed to either side. Griffins are usually associated with death; and the rest of the scene would seem to indicate an interest in something like regeneration or resurrection. I count twelve long-necked birds (lack of clarity prevents further speculation on the number) flying upwards. Four more of these long-necked birds rest on the ground, two each on either side of the trunks of two large trees which frame the whole scene. These trees, finally, are each equipped with two (possibly four) of the later version of the whorls (simple rings mounted either side of a stake, sug? gesting an analogy with the measuring rod and line which became the symbol of 'just measure', best known from the scene at the top of the stele of Hammurabi's law code); and it would appear that, again, the intention was to reconcile a mythic with a cultic setting. 41. Or so would appear to be the case in the light of Kramer and Maier, Myths of Enki, The Crafty God (Oxford, 1989), p. 39 (see also the rest of this myth and both glossary and index, under Kur and kur). The authors give the impression of having been made cautious by Jacobsen's criticism (see note 40, although they do not cite his article), but they nevertheless cling to Kramer's earlier position regarding the kur (as found in, for example, the revised editions of Sumerian Mythology (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 1961 and 1972). What Kramer and Maier once describe as 'the mysterious hursag' is the only term for mountain which Clifford and Jacobsen recognize. 42. It must be stressed that the Olympian gods of Greece, or the orientation to heaven in Christianity, are not valid models for understanding the Meso potamian situation. Although anki is the Sumerian term for universe (com? prising an, or heaven (masculine), and Id, or earth (feminine)), the picture is much more complicated. The only generalizations I would offer is that hier? archies do exist, but they reside within elaborate tensions between more eternal and primordial deities and situations (for example apsu, the deep, which is the ancestor of chaos, the gap) and more temporal ones (for example Ninurta, the storm god or the south wind). 43. I would hesitate to argue that the apparent excess of materials is, as it were, simply for display, as one might say of, for example, a Faberge egg (Moort gat, op. cit. p. 44, dismisses the ram of Ur and the rest of the Royal Grave finds as 'only the work of craftsmen [whatever that means ? does he pre? suppose the existence of a separate class of 'artists'?] ... not objects of great artistic value [meaning?] but merely [?] decorations on implements and fur? nishings'). If a drumhead and a pickaxe deserve mythic treatment, one might be reluctant to make such judgements about 'implements'. Whatever 'value' means in this context, I would be more inclined to interpret the choices made by the artisans who created this artefact as a clue to the iconography of materials during this period. Frankfort, op. cit. p. 63, believes that the foil-covered stake protruding from the back of the ram originally rose to same height as the horns, forming a tripod to support 'bowls and saucers for offerings', and he cites a seal impression depicting a similar arrangement. Despite the delicacy which AA FILES 22 61</page><page sequence="15">would be required to support anything more substantial than a saucer (even in the afterlife), the hypothesis is attractive when placed in the context of the custom for the king to eat the 'leftovers' of the offerings consumed by the deity (Oppenheim, op. cit. pp. 188-9). The equipment of a royal burial does not preclude temple furnishings, but the present artefact seems to be related to palace ceremonial. 44. Although Burkert would undoubtedly prefer to see this as evidence of the archaic preference for odd numbers, passed on to the Pythagoreans. I would not exclude this possibility, but it seems difficult to restrict such an interpret? ation to one horizon of analogy, as he appears to desire. However, he is right to stress the symbolic modalities of numbers, which were not simply vehicles of calculation, devoid of content. Lore and Science in Ancient Pythagorean ism (Cambridge, Mass., 1972), pp. 465ff. 45. And to the horns of such animals as the ram and the stag, which latter our tree resembles ? although this sort of visual pun is more common in Northern Mesopotamia and Anatolia. The regenerative content of the vine or tree was, of course, preserved well into the present period. Aristotle, De Anima, II. 2-3, declares that the attribute of growth embodied in vegetation separates it from animals, who also possess sense perception, and humans, who ad? ditionally possess reason. This hierarchy was to be incorporated in more elaborate speculations by the Christian Neoplatonists. The association, into the late Hellenistic period, of the vine (both grape and ivy) with Dionysus, a dying and reviving god, moved Jesus to declare himself 'the true vine' (John 15:1). The temporality of the vine was also preserved in the genealogical eschatology of the Tree of Jesse (Isaiah 11), the Latin rendering of which inspired the pun on virga (root) and virgo (virgin). I would reserve the term 'Tree of Life' for its Christian context. Although its appearance in both the Bible (Genesis and Revelations) and the visual arts is undoubtedly indebted to the more archaic theme of the vine and tree, it seems to me inappropriate to apply the Hebrew and Christian meanings to, for example, the ancient Near East, as does Moortgat, among others. Outside that context, the term 'life' is so unspecific as to be vacuous. 46. The excavation photographs show that the piece had been crushed flat, but it is not possible that this central grouping is a product of the reconstruction. Incidentally, the length of the blank stems indicates that they were intended to support rosettes. 47. Oppenheim, op. cit. p. 176, describes as 'metaphysical1 the fact that lumin? osity and divinity always appear together. More problematic is his emphasis upon the overwhelming power of this luminosity, which, in my view, corre? sponds to the sort of imposition of Western experience which he had earlier criticized (see note 38). The frequent attribution to primitive or ancient peoples of such experiences of the numinous as the mysterium tremendum seems to me to reflect the Romantic substitution of intensity of experience for depth of understanding. Worse, this Rausch (which we have seen advocated by Le Corbusier) is often held to be a standard of religious experience in general. Were this true, one would be forced to imagine the figures closest to the centre of religious practice (the king and the temple priests) capable of organizing city-states, kingdoms and empires while being constantly im? mobilized by their religion. 48. The delicacy of this touching seems to be intentional. It is part of an elaborate structure of such gestures (face-to-face encounter, kneeling encounter, com? bat, etc.), which are as formalized in art as they would be in ritual or ceremony. Indeed, many of the most important elements of architectural arrangement (such as the so-called 'bent axis', often used to describe the relationship of the main portal of a temple to its cult focus, and therefore erroneously bearing connotations of a geometrical principle of design) may be seen to have their source in such relationships. This seems to be particu? larly true of structures which pertain to, or are derived from, the temple. The point is to establish a measured distance from the deity, as the basis of a measured reconciliation. At this level, ritual, spatial structure and ontological order are seen to grow out of the decorum of the human situation. 49. This is usually said of the cosmic waters. The mountain or hill is the first thing to appear from these waters in many myths; and they are therefore closely related in the matter of origins. In the art of ancient Mesopotamia water is represented as a series of parallel wavy lines. It therefore shares with rep? resentations of the mountain the reiterative temporality of undifferentiated rhythm. The reciprocities of mountain/waters and light/dark are richly interwoven in both texts and architectural iconography. It may have been the influence of the Indian context which enabled Le Cor? busier to exploit these themes so consistently at Chandigarh, although they are also prominent in at least two works from the mid-1920s: his mother's house and the League of Nations design. 50. The famous myth called 'Innana's descent to the underworld' includes a seven stage sequence of gates which recalls Herodotus' description of the Neo BabyIonian ziggurat at Babylon, also comprising seven stages, and coloured after the planets. At a more profound level, the rupture in the relationship to the titular deity (its death), and its recovery, accompanied by the reading of the cosmogony at the New Year's ceremony, has its primary focus in the temple of the ziggurat. The turning-point of the ceremony (in the late form by which it is presently known) is held, however, at a manor-house situated outside the walls and in a grove of regularly spaced trees (in the example from Assur), which represents the town in essence (in origin). This latter aspect of the iconography has echoes in Mycenaean and Etruscan culture. 51. Within this horizon does the intuition of the excavator (Woolley) make sense that he had discovered something relating to the 'ram in the thicket' of Gen. 22: 1-19. What is obviously common to the piece from Ur and the text from the Pentateuch is the epiphany of the divine, the ram, the tree/bush, and mountain/altar. However, the elements of sacrifice (the necessity of death to the disclosure of life, the agon which reveals a truth) and of substitution of the ram for the human child (mimetic distance, or re-enactment, as the vehicle of reconciliation) are both consistent with what is in play in the earlier example. 52. According to a custom in the ancient Near East, it was the centre of the king's residential town, Kar Tukulti-Ninurta, near Assur. The complexities of Assyrian art and architecture in respect of their relation to northern motifs, southern traditions, or Assyrian innovations are beyond present concerns. Suffice it to say that, from approximately the time of Tikulti-Ninurta I (who was the first Assyrian ruler to conquer Babylon, carrying off the statue of Marduk), southern traditions had a very strong influence on Assyrian thinking. At the same time, however, the boxed articu? lation of the frames of the mural decoration appears in the earlier northern palace at Nuzi. 53. Neo-Assyrian examples seem to show only curled leaves in this position; but taking account of other interpretations of the column base, and given the appearance of these examples, I would incline to rocks in this case. The Neo Assyrian examples would seem to exclude Andrae's reading of the braided cord as water (Coloured Ceramics from Assur (London, 1925), pp. 5, 15), although his desire to see the wall-painting in relation to tapestries (op. cit. p. 16) seems right. 54. In this respect it is worth noting that 'the Sumerian poet gets his rhythmic effects primarily from variations in the repetition patterns. He makes no use whatever of the meters or uniform line so characteristic of Indo-European epics' (Kramer, History Begins at Sumer (New York, 1956)). 55. On the Assyrian ritual, see Frankfort, op. cit. pp. 135-7 and references, and those of the more recent B. Mallowan, 'Magic and Ritual in the Northwest Palace Reliefs', in Essays on Near Eastern Art and Archeology in Honor of Charles Kyrle Wilkinson (New York, 1983), pp. 33ff., who stresses the apo tropaic content of this tree). Note also Fig. 8 of the present article, a relief from Nimrud (erroneously placed by Frankfort behind the throne of the Northwest Palace at Nimrud (see note 60) and now in British Museum) showing what Frankfort calls 'griffin-demons' (priests in ritual costume) asperging a later version of this tree. They asperge the king in another relief from the same set (Frankfort's fig. 186), lending substance to the affiliation of the manifestation of divine or semi-divine human figures with this tree (see notes 39 and 40). Here the elements of which this tree is composed are particularly legible (12 + 1 palmettes: regeneration of the year?). Columns are not prominent in ancient Mesopotamian architecture until the period of the second millennium, when cultural exchanges with Egypt and Crete begin. Certainly Egyptian use of the column precedes that of all other cultures in the area; but, in my view, the Persian and Greek situations are both heavily indebted to a complex process of reinterpretation in an area that stretches from Crete to Persia. Within this, the Assyrian contribution seems significant. It may be offered in passing, and in the light of the column-base articulation at Persepolis, three hundred years later, that the 'egg-like rocks' which I have hypothesized for the wall-paintings have become sublimated into the base mouldings of the Neo-Assyrian example. 56. This simultaneous play between the (usually linear and branched) develop? ment of a plant and its disposition as rhythmic symmetry is ubiquitous in all periods. It represents the play between generative, historical time, and tran? scendent, completed/original time. 57. Black and white, blue and red. The same colours appear in the throne room murals of Sargon II, at Khorsabad, about half a millennium later. 58. I. Winter, 'After the Battle is Over: The Stele of the Vultures and the Begin? ning of Historical Narrative in the Art of the Ancient Near East', volume 16 62 AA FILES 22</page><page sequence="16">of Studies in the History of Art (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., 1985). My attempt to solicit the temporality of narrative art into the more background, and therefore more fundamental, temporality of the vine and tree might seem to be subverted by the battle and lion-hunt reliefs of Assurnasirpal II's throne room. Here the battle, or the hunt, occupies the top register, and the conclusion the lower (see I. Winter, The Program of the Throneroom of Assurnasirpal II\ in Essays on Near Eastern Art. . ., op. cit. pp. 15-32). However, in conformity with the nature of the orthostats them? selves, this reorientation to the earth might well be read in the light of the temporal structure of that room. According to this reading, historical or dramatic time (not present in the paintings of Tukulti-Ninurta) proceeds both horizontally and downwards towards the earth, from which the primary tem? poral orientation of the sacred tree arises (ultimately towards Assur himself, in the main reliefs). 59. On column capitals, altars, walls, thrones, grave stele, etc. 60. I. Winter, in an important article reconstructing and interpreting this throne room, places a relief similar to Fig. 8 of the present article in the niche behind the throne. It differs in showing an even more elaborate version of this tree (28+ 1 palmettes: regeneration of the month?), Assur in his winged aureole directly above the centre of the tree, and two priests inside the two griffin demons. It represents, then, a more elaborate and articulate interpretation of the same themes. Additionally, she shows that a duplicate of this relief stood opposite the main door to this room. The sacred tree articulated the four corners of the room precisely: each half of the tree occupies a separate orthostat, which are then joined at the corner. Looking at the whole ensemble, we may say that the temporality of propitiation of the ruler and the agon of decision are co-ordinated with a cosmic time articulated by the tree. More? over, Winter shows that the battle reliefs appear to be placed in the room in such a way that their orientation corresponds to the geographical location of these battles in the empire. Her emphasis upon the 'historical' temporality of these reliefs allows us to see that the spatial reconciliation of throne room with empire with cosmic setting in fact reconciles the dramatic time of human praxis with original or cosmic time by means of the oriented time of the tree ('The Program of the Throneroom of Assurnasirpal II', op. cit.). 61. All the more poignant, given the prominence of the mountain elsewhere in Assyrian works, as the raised platforms for thrones, the one-story-high cult niche in the Ishtar temple of Tukulti-Ninurta I, or the Balawat gates attest. These latter, which depict Shalamaneser III on a military campaign culminat? ing in the tracing of the source of the Tigris, end in a cave whence the water emerges. It is doubtful that the scenes, or their presence on hinges of the palace gates, are simply intended to record the events of an expedition. It, and the affiliated 'righteous' campaign, has more the quality of a quest, the narra? tive passage recording the extent of the empire as a recovery of origins, not only of the river (and all that that implies), but of time itself. In other words, this may be one instance in which the reciprocal temporality of the mountain and the waters are brought together outside myth. The likelihood of this reading is reinforced by the way mountains and waters are deployed in Neo-Assyrian royal reliefs. Winter ('The Program op. cit.) observes that representation of the Mountains in the East and the Waters in the West is common to both Assurnasirpal's throne room and the raised platform for Sargon II's throne. Her contention that this is meant to represent the bounds of the empire in a geographical sense is only enhanced by interpreting it as part of an effort to reconcile the imperial setting with the original division in cosmic time. Further to the palace itself as embodiment of the time of origins, see notes 58 and 60, and note 122 in part two of this article, to be published in AA Files no. 23, July 1991. 62. In this light, it may be worth reviewing the standard description of the Assyrian throne room orthostats, which depict mainly warlike subjects, or the king en? gaged in a ceremonial lion-hunt. It seems most scholars agree (Winter is an exception) that they were intended primarily to impress or render submissive a visitor or subject. The agonic nature of these scenes, the way in which they complement the tribute scenes, the sacred character of warfare all suggest a questioning attitude to the outcome. If the outcome alone were the point, the rest of the story would not be relevant ; one would expect only subdued enemies (as one in Egyptian reliefs), and dead lions. Winter's recognition of the 'historical' nature of these reliefs seems to support this reading ('The Pro? gram. ..', op. cit.). I would suggest that, at the least, the horizon of stone established in these contests, articulated by the tree at the four corners and at the place of the throne, can be taken as just that (see notes 58, 60, 61). 63. The sort of experiment represented by the Inanna temple of Karaindash at Uruk, in which the gods appearing from the apex of the mountain occupy the customary recesses which had articulated the exterior of temples for at least a millennium, is rare, probably about as rare as the telemones and caryatids of classical times. This arrangement in fact makes up a sort of base for the temple. The deities hold vessels from which water streams symmetrically to either side and both up and down the surface. See note 40. Karaindash was a Kassite king, about 150 years before Tikulti-Ninurta I. 64. The curves of leaves, twists of vines, etc., and particularly their placement, would be controlled by geometric matrices. He seems to have had consider? able practice with this at La Chaux-de-Fonds, under TEpplatenier', and published his early drawings of mountains and trees (as it happens), designs for watch-cases and so forth. He would have known of the procedure not only from Owen-Jones, but also from the 'proper' construction of column capitals as propounded by the maligned Vignola. 65. I will not argue the point in detail here, as much Greek philosophy intervenes; but I will suggest that the so-called Vitruvian man is less about human dimen? sions and their eurythmy or otherwise, than a late sublimation of the temporal relationships as we have examined them here. For Vitruvius (to say nothing of his followers), the certainties of the geometric configurations, and of archi? tectural physiognomy, guide his thinking. Dalibor Vesely has shown how his treatment of decor shifts the original emphasis upon the qualitative meaning, which originates in praxis, to a quantitative meaning, having for its object the details of architectural physiognomy ('Architecture and the Poetics of Rep? resentation', Daidalos 6, 1987. 66. Of the three main interpreters of this painting, Gombrich, Dempsey and Wind, we are following Wind {Pagan Mysteries in the Renaissance (revised edition: Oxford, 1980), pp. 113ff.). 67. Wind, op. cit. p. 125. 68. On the iconography of which see main text below. 69. Compare Leonardo's ceiling for the Castello Sforza, in Milan. 70. Compare the dialectics of Sylva/Noys and Physis/Urania in the Cosmo graphia of Bernardus Sylvestris, whose Christian Neoplatonism anticipates that of Florence by about 250 years and is, in turn, indebted to a tradition dating back to the fourth century ? for example, Augustine, Boethius, Macrobius, Martianus Capella, Chalcidius (The Cosmographia of Bernardus Sylvestris, translated by Wetherbee (New York, 1973)). 71. Well exemplified in human perception, or, more precisely, the problem of focusing, which is as much or more a matter of attention than it is of optics. The reader may care to test this by attempting to read a word of text immedi? ately below or above a word upon which one is concentrating (that is, under? standing). The narrowness of one's clear focus is independent of size of text or distance from one's eyes; it is a matter of attention. None the less, a whole context is always already there as a kind of room or world. 72. The situation is exemplified in individual forgetting, where there appears a kind of hole in the memory: what is sought cannot be found, but there is no difficulty in rejecting the alternatives which seem to cluster about the absent object. At a philosophical level, Plato seeks to present the disclosure of truth, which is always-already-there but concealed in its transcendence, as a process of anamnesis, or recollection. 73. On this, see H.-G. Gadamer, Truth and Method (Tubingen, 1965; London, 1979), Part One.II. 1 .a-d, 'Play as the Clue to Ontological Explanation'. 74. In Renaissance Italy the throne setting was not restricted to royalty and the church. 75. They were certainly in the same building, the Medici villa of Castello, and pos? sibly commissioned by Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco. See Wind, op. cit. p. 113. 76. The term translates as 'contest', but more broadly connotes the element of sacrifice which discloses the divine, and is seen to pertain, for example, to judicial cases or to tragedy. On the sacrificial content, see Burkert, Homo Necans (Berkeley, 1983, from Berlin, 1972). To the material in Vernant (772? Origins of Greek Thought (Cornell, 1982, from Paris, 1962)), it ought to be added that the central portion of the rhetorical speeches deployed in all legal and political settings (at least after 467 bc ? Cicero, Brutus, XII, 46), that is, the portion devoted to the arguments for and against, were known as agones. 11. Of course, without the depth of meaning, and orientation to (some would say 'anxiety about') the primary context in ritual re-enactment, out of which the theatre developed and which is preserved in the reciprocity between spec? tators and dramatic action, the theatre would never have attracted or sustained the speculation on universality in the first place. Most importantly, it came to stand for re-enactment itself, and therefore for the creative power in human finitude. However, I am less concerned here with the theatre as a whole than I am with its capacity to become a particular kind of paradigm. Unlike a mythic or symbolic paradigm, which is embodied in a story, this paradigm possessed no concrete temporality which could be the basis of elaboration and of reinterpretation. Rather, it was about a fundamental set of relationships: AA FILES 22 63</page><page sequence="17">the mythos of the figures represented by the actors, this in and for the spectators, and the whole within a sort of cosmic room which, particularly with Hellenistic perspectivity, became autonomous from its urban and natural context. As this happens, it becomes clear how necessary is the architecture to the integrity of the theatre and, correlatively, how architectural integrity manifests itself as a hierarchically and systematically co-ordinated system of modules (within a specific iconographic horizon). Here a conflict ensues, \ between a closed or internally consistent unity embodied in an architecture \ structured this way, and the more open, dramatic unity arising from ritual re enactment and preserved in the mythos of a particular drama. One can see already in Vitruvius (Book V.VI. Iff.) that the fastidiousness with respect to the geometry is evidence that the authority resides with the geometry rather than with the cultural context, from which arises any possibility of meaning fulness of something like the geometry. 78. Vernant, op. cit., and Snell, The Discovery of the Mind in Greek Philosophy and Literature (New York, 1982, from Oxford, 1953). I have discussed the related issue of physislnomos in 'Natura Morta', op. cit. 79. Anciently attributed, like the term 'philosophy,' to Pythagoras; but see Bur kert, Lore and Science, op. cit. 80. While none the less retaining many of these distinctions for iconographic pur? poses well into the modern era. However, as anyone who has attempted to trace the archaic status of any of the major deities will know, the sort of codification which one finds in the iconographies of Alciati or Ripa, and which tends to inspire the expression 'the god of, is not present in the earlier material. There are simply stories involving certain issues, settings and figures. As stabilization of the figures proceeds, it becomes apparent that some sort of overall order is more important than the ambiguity and richness of any of the individuals, which are consequently reduced for the sake of the whole. It must be said, however, that the phenomenon of 'divided representation' described by Vesely in 'The Conflict of Representation' (AA Files no. 8) and dated by him to the end of the seventeenth century ad corresponds to the ad? vent of a fundamental and pervasive trust in conceptual paradigms. This is not &lt; the issue with respect to the period we are considering here, although it is a necessary stage in the longer process. The situation in the fourth century bc is instructive. On the one hand, Plato's use of myths as a 'second best' dis? course corresponds to an effort to retain the fullness of reference, the whole? ness of the cosmic domain, for logos, in response to the Sophists' claim to be able to manipulate the logos at will. Similarly, the axiomatics of Euclid, im? possible without the prior establishment of the authority and autonomy of ! logos as the pre-eminent domain of representation, must be placed alongside such speculation as Archytas' solution to the doubled cube altar problem. Here the mean (bearing all the significance of the 'just measure', and hence \ the necessity of the altar to the speculation) is discovered within an elaborate imaginary configuration in which the major elements must revolve and rotate, as if to present an analogue to the psychogony of the Timaeus. In other words, the self-recognition of the authority of logos does not at all necessarily lead to the dominance of conceptual thinking; but the latter is inconceivable without the former. 81. This has its origins in the Pauline treatment of body and soul in the New Testa? ment, and then in the eloquent argument of John of Damascus (On the Divine Images), who argued the case for icons on incarnational grounds. For the Renaissance understanding, see, as a beginning, Panofsky, Idea: A Concept in Art History (Leipzig and Berlin, 1924, and New York, 1954), and Studies in Iconology (New York, 1939); Kline, Form and Meaning (New York, 1962); Trinkhaus, In Our Image and Likeness (London, 1970). 82. The computational practices with respect to time are given in Neugebauer, The Exact Sciences in Antiquity (Princeton, 1952), and, with an interesting attempt to reconcile these with the symbolic material, van der Waerden, Science A wakening II: The Birth of Astronomy (New York and Leiden, 1974). ' 83. Timaeus 37c-39e, ending with 'the perfect number of time'. 84. De Caelum, 279a 15-25, ending with the immortality and divinity of the aeon. See also Physics, 11:218a9-219a6 and 14:223a25. 85. Although offering a somewhat revised reading of the iconography, the follow? ing description is indebted to Coffin, The Villa in the Life of Renaissance Rome (Princeton, 1979), and The Villa d'Este at Tivoli (Princeton, 1960) (for documents and sources, particularly the description, probably by Ligorio, pp. 141-150); to Lamb, Die Villa d'Este in Tivoli (Ansbach, 1966); and to del Maso, The Villa d'Este at Tivoli (Florence, 1978). 86. This ridge is a product of the huge excavation of earth from the eastern side, which was then placed on the lower, western, side, in order to achieve an east west horizontality across the south-north incline upwards to the villa. 87. As of the 1685 engravings of Venturini. It appears that Apollo and Diana were once intended for these niches. The overall iconography is more focused in the final version; but the alternative retains the basic theme. Not only were Apollo and Diana both Delians, but it was a commonplace of emblematics to compare the bow held by both Diana and Apollo to the lyre, and therefore to music. What was emphasized in the alternative was the agonic element, and, assisted by the presence of the two Dianas, a play between the chthonic and the celestial. \S. Wind, op. cit. pp. 129ff., Appendix 6 and Illustration 20. \9. According to the 1573 Duperac engraving, this Okeanos was further articulated by two small pavilions with conical roofs, which recollect the metae sudantess that marked the turning-points of the ancient Roman circus. In ancient times these symbolized the passage, or 'turning', of time, as can be seen in Etruscan funeral urns, for instance. In the loggia of Ligorio's Casino of Pius IV, whose construction dates overlapped those of the Villa d'Este, there is a frieze depict? ing putti engaged in a chariot race in the circus, with a mosaic relief of Diana of Ephesus beneath it. The frieze establishes the horizon of the vault frescos relating to Genesis (the origins of Christian time). Given that both the Diana of Ephesus and the circus occur here in conjunction with an elaborate thematic of the cosmic waters (oriented, in the Casino of Pius IV, to baptism), it would be reasonable to see the temporal iconography which we have adduced for Okeanos at the Villa d'Este to have been elaborated along these lines. Moreover, the engraving shows, at the eastern and western extremities of Okeanos, a group of four circles in squares, each in turn divided by a cross into four quarters. This sequence is itself quartered by a path which bridges a water channel, recapitulating the passage of the major paths across the Okeanos. The great tripartite water-facade which today marks the transition from the water-organ to the Okeanos is modern. Duperac shows a terrace beneath the fountain with grottoes dedicated to the Sibyls (briefly, the metamorphosis of earth into prophecy, and precursor of the Albunean Sibyl at the end of the sequence in the Parnassus Fountain), and, at the level of the water of the fish pools, a Fountain of Antinous (Hadrian's consort, 'sacrificed' in Egypt, by drowning). Venturini shows a cascade by designed by Bernini for this site. K). Coffin (Villa. . . Rome, op. cit. p. 327) hints at the Aristotelian hierarchy plants (lower garden)-animals (Okeanos/Natura)-humans (History, Myth, Poetry) from De Anima which we mentioned above (note 45), which would seem to be confirmed if the content of the upper lateral division is revised from the arts to logos. This reading does not conflict with Coffin's secondary iconography, such as that pertaining to the seven tempiettil'seven hills of the Rometta, the use of local rivers and orientation, of elements of the family crest, etc. )\. Salutati: 'It is no accident that we attribute rhetoric to Venus, the goddess of love whose task it is to inspire souls and set hearts afire', cited in Garin, Italian Humanism (Oxford, 1965), p. 33. )2 . Allowing for the requirements of perspective, this tree seems to be rather care? fully crooked to separate the ars of design (Birds, or Owl, Fountain) from the ars of politics (Fountain of the Emperors, now Persephone) in the distance; that is, it preserves the division between the part of the garden which is affiliated with the metamorphosis of nature and the part affiliated with discourse. Consistent also with the other appearances of this tree, the tree of the fresco stands against a great field of light. In this case, however, it is clearly the even? ing light of the setting sun. This is the direction of the Garden of the Hesperides, and may indicate a particular orientation to the chthonic in this garden (see the second part of this article, to be published in AA Files no. 23). Moreover, the group of birds which are clustered around the top of the tree, and appear to be flying away from it, may partake of an ancient association of birds with the metamorphosis of the soul after death. This supposition is confirmed by the presence of the hoopoe (to the left, also related to augury in Virgil), and even more by the presence of a great peacock, which stands in front of the whole scene. According to this reading, the tree recovers its ancient meaning, and may in fact stand for such a recovery. ?3. The former is positioned at the end of the primary sequence, in the east, in the retaining wall of the Parnassus Fountain; the latter is located in the extreme west, at the uppermost level of the garden proper, and in the base of an elabor? ate three-tiered dining pavilion which extends back to the main building. The final ascent to the 'Banquet of Hercules with the Gods' was made by returning to the east, as in the primary sequence. H. It may be that the Christian orientation of the frescos in the western rooms of the lower level was not simply a consequence of the counter-reformation, although the date certainly supports this view. However, the south wall of the great transverse corridor at this level, which is a retaining wall aligned with the edge of the old monastic cloister above, is ornamented with several mosaic fountains, as if the garden had been brought precisely to this depth in the house. It is then possible that the final ascent to that cloister ? now a courtyard ? is meant in fact to be the conclusion of the journey. 64 AA FILES 22</page><page sequence="18">95. In accordance with the encyclopaedic interests of Ligorio, the planting was vastly more elaborate in its diversity than at present, and the garden was popu? lated by the numerous antiquities, now dispersed, that he had scavenged from Rome and his excavations at Hadrian's Villa. Nor have we discussed the array of secondary fountains, such as those to Flora and Pomona at either end of the logos horizon, or the second dedication of the garden to Hippolytus, as recorded in Murat's poems. The resulting complexity might seem to undermine any reasonable conception of 'iconographic programme'. However, the scope of iconographic thinking at this time extended across the representational spec? trum. On the one hand, there were ephemeral iconographic games played after dinner, as recorded by Castiglione. Between these and the frescos and carvings of the most permanent monuments existed the masques and festivals, which influenced both ends of the spectrum. The learning brought to the development of a programme by Ligorio may be measured by his vast compendium of antiquities and their interpretation, now mostly in Turin. 96. Ozment, 'Mysticism, Nominalism and Dissent', in Trinkaus and Obermann, The Pursuit of Holiness in Late Medieval and Renaissance Religion, papers from conference at the University of Michigan (Leiden, 1974), pp. 66ff. 97. See Grassi, Renaissance Humanism (Binghamton, 1988), pp. 3Iff. Parnassus, as the home of the Muses, is the conclusion to the primary icono? graphy of the Villa d'Este, according to my reading. However, it is also pos? sible to see it as the source, reflecting the necessity of logos to the disclosure of physis. Before the recent construction of the cascade below the Fountain of the Water Organ, the Parnassus Fountain would have been the most assertive, and was in fact near the source of the waters which fed the garden. The possibility that the origins of the primary iconography are recapitulated in the conclusions is further enhanced if one assumes that Ligorio was work? ing with Macrobius, or the Neoplatonic material which inspired Macrobius: 'cosmogonists have chosen to consider the nine Muses as the tuneful song of the eight spheres and the one predominant harmony that comes from all of them' (in Spmnium Scipionis Expositions, Book Two, Chapter III. 1, trans? lated by Stahl (New York, N. Y., 1952)). On this reading the fusion of the two inner arches to form the openings to the water-vault may not be merely an entertaining diversion, but stands for 'the one predominant harmony'. The ten water nymphs and the ten plane trees which were to shade the piazza in front of the fountain (in the Duperac engraving, the tenth is hidden by the wall in the foreground) perhaps reflect the decadic numerology of the Pythagorean and Platonic origins of the Neoplatonic material. If so, the appellation One Hundred Fountains, which is the customary name for what I have called the Metamorphoses Fountain, may conform to this sort of numerology. Other examples might include the ten aedicules of the unbuilt Neptune Fountain, the seven layers of the labyrinths, the differentiation by twos of the central one of the central square of boschetti. Both Plato's Academy and the Pythagoreans were known to celebrate the cult of the Muses. 98. See Trinkaus, op. cit. pp. 230ff. 99. Grassi, op. cit. pp. 29ff. 100. Gadamer, Truth and Method, op. cit. Part Two II. 1-3. 101. The association of the sphinx with questioning is as much a consequence of the answer to the famous riddle (which concerns the temporality of human finitude), as the riddle itself. 102. Unfortunately, the intended topography of the upper garden at this point is unclear, although the alternatives all gravitate around the thematic structure I have outlined here. Both Duperac and the fresco view in the Salotto show the Metamorphoses Fountain broken at the centre by a single stair which extends to the base of the niche supporting the terrace. This does not appear in either the Venturini engraving or the present garden. This stair makes the relation to the Dragon Fountain more explicit; but it has the defect of making the allusion to the apotheosis of Hercules appear more mechanical and literal, and possibly for this reason it was omitted. Additionally, Duperac shows another platform above the one under discus? sion, although the fresco does not. This position is now occupied by a remark? able sculpture by Bernini. A strange fluted shaft rises from within a huge scallop shell. The iconography of the scallop shell may only be summarized here: it relates to pilgrimage (in particular that to St James of Campostella), it relates to rebirth from water (as used in images of the Baptism of Christ or the Birth of Venus), and it relates to the canopy of heaven or the descent of rays of light, or tongues of fire giving prophetic speech to the Apostles (as may be seen in the half-domes above niches, or the apse vault of S. Maria del Popolo by Bramante, or the vault of S. Ivo by Borromini). The interrelated ness of these is perhaps apparent (in short, they represent successive stages in a progress of the soul). The fluted shaft is sufficiently ambiguous to suggest not only a mysterious affinity with the scallop shell, but also the trunk of a tree or a vine, an architectural column, a vase and a jet of water. A more succinct summary of the whole proposition of the garden (to say nothing of many of the themes regarding the temporality of metamorphosis, which we have been examining here) could hardly be imagined. 103. Coffin sees here a version of the Farnese Hercules (resting on his club and holding behind him the Apples of the Hesperides), a misreading of the Ven turini engraving, which clearly shows the antique statue mentioned in the documents from Modena (del Maso, op. cit. p. 67, and Lamb, op. cit. plate 113), now in the Louvre: Hercules holding his son (the deer's head is just visible above the balustrade in the engraving), although left and right do not agree (engraver's error?). Consistent with the topographic ambiguities described in the previous note are the possible locations for Hercules. One of these includes a total of at least three, corresponding to the boyhood, the youth and the adulthood of Her? cules. This idea is attractive because it relates the Hercules theme to the Riddle of the Sphinx, but is difficult to situate topographically, unless they were each to be placed on the three terraces of the Duperac engraving (the upper terrace is now occupied by the remains of an elaborate tripod). The Venturini engraving shows Hercules on the platform on which I, fol? lowing Coffin, have located him. The statue depicting Hercules and his son raises the possibility that the previous alternative is not in fact an alternative, but a reading of the intended iconography: another Venturini engraving, taken from a higher and closer vantage point, is apparently unnecessary, except to emphasize the Sphinxes (and the reliefs depicting Ovid's Metamor? phoses, and the shell-niche containing a river god beneath the platform for Hercules). Moreover, there is an old tradition of representing the soul in the form of an infant. The final alternative places the copy of the Farnese Hercules in the niche directly behind the Dragon, where Venturini shows a Bacchic figure (as well as two female figures in the side niches, whose identity is uncertain, and what appear to be four versions of Hermes at the base of the stairs). The Venturini engraving in this case, as with that of the Fountain of the Water Organ, is wholly consistent with the reading offered here; and the latter may therefore correspond to the seventeenth-century arrangement (the Apotheosis of Her? cules is a theme generally associated with the seventeenth century). However, it is interesting that the location of the Farnese Hercules in this niche would have concealed the object of his quest ? the three Golden Apples of the Hes? perides (since the statue hides them behind his back). In other words, this is a more allusive presentation of the dialectics of the question. Again, therefore, a proper assessment of the situation appears to be that the later rendering simply makes more explicit an ambiguous arrangement of the sixteenth century. 104. 'confer the deification [in caelum fama] of renown and gratitude upon distinguished benefactors. This is the origin of Hercules.' Cicero, De natura deorum, II, 24. 105. It is from this period that the words 'divine' and 'genius' came to be associ? ated with artists, whose efforts to emancipate themselves from the status of the artes manuales to the artes liberales represents the beginning not only of the conception of art as we now use it, but, more importantly, of the special conception of creativity which is most familiar from Romantic thinking (and so important to Le Corbusier's conception of the life of action ? in this of course he agrees with most everyone else, holding the artist to be a paradig? matic figure, and the work of the artist to be the paradigm for the conception of space out of which would arise the new dwelling for the new society). 106. In strictly linguistic terms, the new meaning of the metaphor rises from the ashes of the pragmatic meanings. In the example, 'the threatening clouds', all the experience of threat is embodied in the clouds. The separate pragmatic meanings are preserved in the metaphor. See Ricoeur, The Rule of Metaphor (Paris, 1975, and London, 1978). It should also be stressed that the catalogues of figures of speech which comprise, for Cicero and Quintillian, the virtus dicendi of ornatus (or digni tas, in the earlier Rhetorica ad Herrenium) are all examples in which the pragmatic meanings of words are subverted (with the concern that this sub? version be fruitful). At the apex of these lists is always the metaphor, which, following Aristotle's Poetics, is the most difficult to discover and use prop? erly, requires the most invention or creativity, and whose invention ? like finding the question ? cannot be taught.
