<plain_text><page sequence="1">A REPLY TO PROFESSOR DRIVER Professor Driver's defence1 of his emendations and translations of certain passages in the Psalms3 seems often to wander from the point. He set out to show that P8. lxxiv. 1 should be translated ' Why ... is thine anger heavy and claimed as support a mere transliteration in Syriac and a characteristic avoidance of an anthropomorphism in the Targ. He now draws in the name עשנאל from Levy's Siegel und Gemmen,Gemmen, but omits to say that the seal is included by Levy under those mitmitmit aramaischen Inschriften. As the seal in question is Aramaic and not Hebrew it can obviously throw no light on Ps. lxxiv. 1; for just as Professor Driver is able to tell us that' the author of Ps. civ. is not a Babylonian', so it is possible to state that the author of Ps. lxxiv. is not an Aramaean. But since Dr. Driver now admits that the R.V. is 'very probably right' he has accepted my arguments. Nevertheless I should welcome an explanation of his assertion that ' smoke is not a necessary sign of heat'. As to Ps. lxxx. 5 (which was misquoted as Ps. lxxxi. 5 in a footnote4 and bracketed with Deut. xxix. 19 where 'smoke' is certainly right), I can only say that I do not share his misgivings. To justify his new rendering of בקש in Ps. lxxxiii. 17 Dr. Driver has forsaken the realm of philology for that of psychology, and there I must leave him. His arguments about the meaning of החליף are incomprehensible to me. First he agrees with me (against his former assertion) that 'changed' and not' repaired' is the meaning of Ps. cii. 27 and II S. xii. 20. Then he argues that there is a distinction in meaning between the Pi'el and the Hiph'il and that we must restore the Hiph. in these two passages 1 Lieder und Gottesspruche der Riickwanderer, p. 25, n. 3, as quoted by Smith, op. cit., p. 178.

But Ps. cii. 27 already has the Hiph., and so has Gen. xxxv. 2; obviously, therefore, no restoration is needed. Moreover it is axiomatic that in Hebrew ' in some verbs Pi. and Hiph. occur side by side in the same sense'.1 Next he says that the three passages are in a different category from that in the Psalms; then that the Hiph. must be retained (not restored as above) in Gen. xxxv. 2; and then that Gen. xli. 14 and II S. xii. 20 must be forced into the Hiph. mould! Lastly—confusion worse confounded—in Ps. cii. 27, the starting-point of the controversy—we are to read Pi. and render 'Thou dost mend them [the heavens] and they are mended'. Thus after agreeing with me that' changed' and not ' repaired' is the meaning he presents us with a patchwork after all. I cannot agree that the alteration of מבואו to מבואה in Ps. civ. 19 is ' negligible'. Rather it is tampering with most important evidence. The sex of the solar deity is a matter of great importance because it throws valuable light on the date and provenance of the various docu ments of the O.T., and we have no right to remove or obscure that evidence. I find more than a dozen texts in the O.T. where the sun is masculine1 so that I cannot agree that שמש is feminine ' in accordance with Hebrew grammar' which clearly recognizes a masculine deity in the sun. Babylonia was by no means the only country in the Near East to worship the sun-god as a male, and one would hardly suspect the Book of Jashar of Babylonian influence (see Josh. x. 12, 13). Professor Driver now claims that Ps. xix. ' is universally admitted to rest on a Babylonian mythbut in a former essay3 he claimed that the myth went back to a source common to Hebrews and Babylonians (without indicating where such common ground could have existed) and he expressly rejected a loan from contemporary Babylonian theology. I cannot but feel that the tag dies docet diem'׳ will have to be invoked again.
