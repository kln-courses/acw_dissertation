<plain_text><page sequence="1">168 On the Entrails of Architecture's Organism Emmanuel Petit - Fig. 01 The Laocoön Group (Alinari-Scala) Architecture frequently derives its principles from the notion of the body, which, in the Vitruvian tradition, epitomizes the ideal of the well-proportioned, well - structured, and self-con- scious human. In this humanist tradition, it was believed that if "correctly" translated into the geometry and the syntactic bond between the individual members of a building's construc- tion, architecture would be able to "embody" the alleged perfection of its natural precursor. As a consequence, archi- tecture would reach its classical telos and achieve Beauty. There are moments of history, however, when both the metaphysi- cal assumptions of- and the formal analogies with- this static view of the body are radically put to question; the ambition to transfer a formal logic across distinct ontologies, from bio- logical bodies to tectonic constructs, is revealed as culturally conditioned and hence is contingent on the rhetoric and self- understanding of a social group in their particular moment in space and time. I will attempt to reveal connections between a few of these "romantic" moments throughout modernity- in the 18th century and today- when the notion of the classical stabil- ity of the body has been challenged in favor of an alternative, functional, and performative aesthetics of the body- as -organism. The language of description of these organisms borrows from psychological and physiological processes of the human body, which had not usually been incorporated in the terminology of aesthetic reasoning, and had even been cast out from the classical lexicon of aesthetics. I will further speculate that architecture since the early 1990s hopes to find, in an anti- classical metaphoricity of the body's "infrastructure," a dif- ferent kind of spatiality that is eminently suited to generate an immersive experience of the biological human body. Within the conceptual frame of the classical notion of beauty, the possibility of particular transitory emotions of the body seemed to interfere with the more universal and timeless features of its humanist ideal. In the mid- 18th cen- tury, the notorious discussion between Johann Joachim Winck- elmann and Gotthold Ephraim Les sing about the Greek statue of the Laocoön opened up the conceptual dilemma posed by the question of how to represent bodily passion. n8- 01 The statue de- picts the scene in which Laocoön- the Trojan priest- and his two THE REAL PERSPECTfi 42</page><page sequence="2">169 Emmanuel Petit sons are strangled by sea serpents sent after them by Poseidon because they warned the Trojans against accepting the "poisoned gift" of the Trojan Horse from the Greeks. Despite the real suffering Laocoön must have faced while being choked, his facial expression remains calm and serene. While Winckelmann and Less- ing disagree on the reasons for which a genuine representation of Laocoön's agony is avoided, they do agree on the sculpture's representational characteristic of a "noble simplicity and quiet grandeur." On the one hand, Winckelmann sees in the art- ist's representational restraint the reflection of the serenity and composure of the Greek heroic temperament; Greek heroes faced death without exhibiting their full emotional pain. Less- ing, on the other, holds that because Beauty is the supreme aspiration of art, an overly realistic depiction of Laocoön's suffering would have violated the main principle of the spatial art of sculpture, i.e. to find the singular, most aesthetic moment to "freeze" in stone: I wanted simply to establish that among the ancients beauty was the supreme law of the visual arts. [...] If we apply this now to the Laocoön, the principi e which I am seeking becomes apparent. The master strove to attain the highest beauty possible under the given condition of physical pain. The demands of beauty could not be reconciled with the pain in all its disfiguring violence, so it had to be reduced. The scream had to be softened to a sigh, not because screaming betrays an ignoble soul, but because it distorts the features in a di s gust i ng manner. Simply imagine Laocoön's mouth forced wide open, and then judge ! [...] The wide-open mouth, aside from the fact that the rest of the face is thereby twisted and di storted in an unnatural and loathsome manner, becomes in painting a mere spot and in sculpture a cavity, with most repul- sive effect . 01 The particular contortions of Laocoön's face risk elevating nothing more than a fleeting moment of physical pain to the status of an artistic ideal, fixed in marble. Such an aesthetic basis grounded in the "real"- though ephemeral- condition of pain was unacceptable to Lessing's neo-classical mindset; the materialized scene should only trigger the mind to imagine the climax of pain. In other words, art has to follow the inter- nal principles of art, while "reality out there"- including the appearance of the tormented body- is relegated to a different, non- artistic sphere of perception. In a contemporaneous essay entitled "A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beauti- ful" from 1757, Edmund Burke makes the case for a very different aesthetic philosophy, which opposes the category of the Beauti- ful to the Sublime. Burke argues that "the ideas of pain are much more powerful than those which enter on the part of plea- sure. Without all doubt," he continues, "the torments which we may be made to suffer, are much greater in their effect on the body and mind, than any pleasures which the most learned volup- tuary could suggest, or than the liveliest imagination, and the most sound and exquisitely sensible body could enjoy."02 Against the classical prerequisite for absolute values of Beauty, Burke here substantiates an interest of all Romantic aesthetic theo- ry in the "particular," including the sick, the distorted, the grotesque, the ugly, and the monstrous.03 In the face of sublime wonder and the ensuing delightful horror, "the idea of a - 01 Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, Laocoön: An Essav on the Limits of Painting and Poetry [1766], trans.

Despite Winckelmann's and Lessing's justifications for Laocoön's calmness, the traditional "beauty" of the aesthetic body is on the verge of losing its formal autonomy and unity in the sculpture. The open orifice of the mouth and the ex- tending snakes contribute to this process of dissolution in an analogous way: while the gaping mouth stops just short of disturbing the visual surface of the body by engulfing it with a grimace, the snakes stretch the body's membrane outwards by entwining it with the bodies of Laocoön's two sons. Both the depth of the mouth's cavity and the extension of the snakes thus come very close to breaking the visual plane or "façade" of the body, pushing inwards and outwards against the classical boundaries of the body in space. In the last decade of the 20th century, architects have reactivated their attention to particular aspects of the body, an interest which, I would argue, has adopted the Romantic sub- lime as its conceptual antecedent like no other period of time since Burke's. Herein, the idea of the beautiful, autonomous body has mutated into the notion of the architectural organism , capable of new interactions with the spaces within and around the surface of the classical body. Increasingly, different physical states of the carnal body changing in time have become paradigmatic for architecture's morphogenesis- like, for in- stance, the body in a state of decomposition, or the grotesque body. Once architects emphasize the transient and singular nature of the physical body over some classical idea of formal stasis, architecture can engage in an unprecedented way with the ephemeral, the transitional, and the contingent. In this conceptual frame, the architectural body is no longer primarily articulated in space, but in time. Amongst other factors, in- creasingly sophisticated and versatile animation software- first introduced in the world of architecture in the early nineties- opened the way into an understanding of form as dynamic and, at the same time, as inhabited by some enigmatic agency with an idiosyncratic and quasi - autonomous behavior. The effects of the software- which itself has a progressively more opaque logic of operation to the architect -user- hold great poetic potential: the creative software -user relishes the ineffable effects that different algorithms produce, and we are awed in the face of the unfolding techno - subì ime . For an architect like Greg Lynn, this new paradigm has had mostly geometrical effects. Indeed, in a number of his early texts, Lynn situates his interests within a well-known formalist tradition from Rudolf Wittkower to Colin Rowe, and, against their "reductive formalism," lays out the parameters for an irreducible formalism that is based on anexact geometries. In the very beginning of Animate Form , however, Lynn explains that "animation implies the evolution of a form and its shaping forces: it suggests animalism, animism, growth, actuation, vitality and virtuality."05 Both his choice of metaphors in this quote and his reference to the series of Blob films (starting with The Blob , directed by Irvin Yeaworth, Jr. , in 1958) used to illustrate his case reveal that Lynn's interest goes beyond the potential for new geometries; in fact, he is fascinated by the changed psychological condi- tions new monstrous, dynamic, and amorphous forms could pro- voke in the beholder of architecture. 06 In Yeaworth's films, the "blob" is a scary alien life -form, which consumes every- thing in its path as it expands . n8- 02 While architectural tec- tonics have hitherto been grounded in a tradition of making THE REfìL PERSPECTfi 42</page><page sequence="4">171 Emmanuel Petit the joinery of different formal systems articulate, blobs erase the legibility of such connections altogether; hence their un- canny, "sticky" appearance. And, most importantly, the decrease of traditional categories of "understanding" in this paradigm is commensurate with the subject's lost ability to comprehend the object -world around him, as well as the ensuing psycho- logical trauma he suffers from his loss of control over the environment. At least on a theoretical level, the body of the subject and the body of architecture now influence each other interactively, which renders the autonomy of both of them unat- tainable: subject and object now have to be conceptualized in relation to one another. The motif of humans losing analytic control in face of the ineffable behavior of the blob acts as an analog to the changed relationship of the animator/ archi- tect toward his design. The architect's agency undoubtedly finds itself radically altered when feeding the computer with data while abandoning the traditional design techniques of the pa- per sketch. This type of architecture unfolds through iterative processes, instead of as a series of conscious, step-by- step, non- automat ic, and non- linear decisions. Lynn's early projects- derived from those creepy, sticky, and slimy forms- impose on both the designer and the beholder of architecture psychological sensations of fascination and, at the same time, of impotence and horror. The distinction between the will of the subject- the designer as an agent of formal decision-making- and the inter- nal "strategies" of the obj ect- designed as the "receiver" of formal informat ion- is removed. The artist's motivation to consciously surrender part of his metaphysical control over the obj ect -world is not new. Surrealist authors and painters from Hieronymus Bosch to Salvador Dali daydreamed about mysterious life forms, which erased the ontological differentiation between live and dead matter, and visibly exceeded the economy of control of "classi- cal" artistry. Fi8-03 Beyond the painterly depiction of Bosch's and Dali's quasi - self - conscious "subject -obj ects," science fiction writers such as Stanislaw Lem envisioned whole sentient planets in outer space ( "object -worlds" ) , which almost behaved like conscious subjects: in Lem's 1961 book Solaris , the planet Solaris is covered with an "ocean," which turns out to be a single living organism enveloping the entire surface of this celestial body. Because of the self-conscious environment's radical exteriority from the categories of "understanding" of human beings, the planet reveals nothing about itself through- out the course of the book and remains entirely mysterious to a group of human researchers in the narrative, who are attempting to analyze the planet from their space station. Instead of be- ing understood, the environment acts on the scientists' minds, laying bare their own repressed and daunting thoughts: they are confronted with their own psychological horror. In this way, Lem upsets the traditional master- slave association of the subj ect -obj ect relationship, which tends to be based on the one-sided agency of the subject- that is, the "thinking" subject, framed by a passive environment: "reality." This "sci-fi" idea of real-time interactivity between humans and their surrounding environments also appealed to architects in the 1960s. One of Archigram's projects, the Elec- tronic Tomato from 1969, amongst others, expressed the desire for an active subj ect -obj ect engagement, although the nature of that interaction remains crypt ic. F'g-04 Archigram's quasi-bio- logical prosthetic gizmo had a stimulating effect on the human body, causing it to abandon both a passive state of being as well as its illusion of metaphysical control over the object. - Fig. 03 Salvador Dali, El enigma del deseo, 1929. - Fig. 04 Warren Chalk &amp; David Greene, "Elec- tronic Tomato," 1969.

In a sense, the project updates the Laocoön for the 20th cen- tury: the electric wires substitute the sea snakes and, in this "new Laocoön," it is not pain, but rather the more desirable state of ecstasy which makes the human figure contort her body and open her mouth. Few have depicted the symbiosis between organic and inert matter in such a powerful way as the Swiss artist H. R. Giger, who was first educated as an architect. Giger's explora- tions of a "biomechanoid" aesthetics resulted in whole animate landscapes made of both biological and mechanical matter. F'g«-05»06 In these settings, humans have relinquished all conscious con- trol over their surroundings; Giger's environments are now con- ceptualized as vegetative organisms, which fundamentally upset the traditional separation between the realities of the subject and of the object. The formal autonomy of the humanoid body is entirely dismantled; it now establishes connections with the obj ect -world. Giger's oeuvre has, in many ways, influenced and anticipated one of the central conceptual themes of architec- ture's experimentations with a new aesthetic over the past two decades. Among those, the notion of the fusion of morphologies with dissimilar ontologies- i. e. the fusion of organic matter with technological "prostheses"- can be found in many of the most provocative projects since the early nineties, particularly in the work of Karl Chu, Marcos Novak, Xefirotarch, and many others. The formal inventions of these artists, authors, and architects- who are all associated in one way or another with the idea of the sublime- find their theoretical counter-part in the anti -philosophe Georges Bataille. Bataille most notably makes use of a wealth of grotesque body metaphors to undo what he sees as the repressive and static force of "architecture," which underlies all human efforts to structure the world around them, physically and conceptually. Indeed, for him, all architecture exists only in the service of the official power structure of the society that erects it, and, as a consequence, has its con- ceptual origin in the building of the prison: the official voice of society imposes its ethical "forms" onto the individual, who has no choice but to move within the space defined for him by society. Nevertheless, Bataille's argument is even more funda- mental, in the sense that he conceptualizes the human body- man's most intimate form- as the first site of incarceration. 07 Invested through his writing in finding ways to de -structure these author- itarian constraints, Bataille highlights their transient and artificial nature by dismantling the biological prison that the human body represents. He takes an early interest in the body in a state of "ecstasy," i. e. a body that literally breaks out of its own boundaries. This pursuit is most clearly portrayed in his first novel, the Story of the Eye , from 1928, which explores notions of human obsession, excess, and deviance.08'^-07 Here, all traditional limitations of the body's morality and physical in- tegrity are suspended and replaced with the decadent pleasures of sexuality, eroticism, and necrophilia. Bataille's bodies are penetrated or torn to pieces in sexual, brutal, and grotesque spectacles. The novel's main tropes are constructed through the exaggeration of the improper. Of course, Bataille's interest in this sort of transgression is part of a broader critique of academicism, as well as an attempt to undo the metaphysical a priori of all Western thinking. He also challenges the tradi- tional forms of epistemology by acknowledging the existence of the formless'. ". . . [F]ormless is not only an adjective having a given meaning, but a term that serves to bring things down in the world, generally requiring that each thing have its form. What it designates has no rights in any sense and gets itself THE REfiL PERSPECTfl 42</page><page sequence="6">173 Emmanuel Petit squashed everywhere, like a spider or an earthworm. [...] Affirm- ing that the universe resembles nothing and is only formless amounts to saying that the universe is something like a spider or spit."09 The analogies between "unformed" matter with such "low" bodily substances like spit, and "low" and "ugly" animal species like spiders or earthworms suggest a lexicon for philo- sophical thought, which is in radical opposition to the tradi- tional values of humanist language, society, and architecture. Each one of these unusual metaphors eschews the inertia of the formal and static universe while carrying a new aesthetic code; all three metaphors- spit , the spider, and the earthworm-are quasi -forms in perpetual morphological transition. Due to a lack of "formed-ness," Bataille's grotesque metaphors themselves are, in fact, over- saturated with meaning and constantly shift- ing with new possibilities of significance. To help understand the specificities of the grotesque, we might turn to Russian philosopher and literary scholar Mikhail Bakhtin, who by all accounts most convincingly defines the term. In Bakhtin's words, "the entire mechanism of the word [grotesque] is transferred from the apparatus of speech to the abdomen. . . [it is] the drama of the body giving birth to the word."10 The foregrounding of the "lower stratum" of the body creates a grotesque effect which, nevertheless, is eminently "productive" of new connotations of meaning. The grotesque capitalizes on the fullness of meaning by suggesting a wealth of promiscuities with the surrounding world: "It is looking for that which protrudes from the body, all that seeks to go out beyond the body's confines. Special attention is given to the shoots and branches, to all that prolongs the body and links it to other bodies or to the world outside,"11 explains Bakhtin. The recurring motifs in Bataille and Bakhtin of interweaving bodies and objects include gaping, swallowing, bulging, devouring, and defecating. In the context of this argument, Bataille's fascination with the grotesque body is most relevant, since with this focus, the distinction between the body's interior and its surround- ings is again blurred. Instead of a net distinction between inside and outside, both the body and its context are woven into some kind of labyrinthine continuum, which reveals any "form" only in a state of transition. Architectural historian Mario Frascari describes the grotesque body as: ... a body in the act of becoming. It is never finished , never completed ; it is continually being built, con- tinually created; it is the principi e of others' bod- ies. The logic of the grotesque image ignores the smooth and impenetrabl e surface of the neoclass i cal bodies, and magnifies only excrescences and orifices which lead into the bodies' depths. These outward and inward details are merged. Moreover, the grotesque body swallows and is swallowed by the world. 12 The grotto, which is at the etymological basis of the gro- tesque, figures as another archetype of the womb -like space, which engenders multiple future meanings yet to be delivered. The grotto's orifice becomes the interface between the hidden image of the body and its open appearance. This interface, due to its special function of becoming, inspires monstrous im- agery, imagery in the process of morphological formation and metamorphosis. The grimace of the monstrous Ore at the Mannerist Bosco dei Mostri (Monsters' Grove) at Bomarzo is merely one illustration of this idea. 13,n8*08 In this discussion, the THE REfiL PERSPECTfi 42 - 09 Bataille, quoted in Rosalind Krauss and Yve Alain Bois.

The same imagery of the mouth as the orifice, which con- nects the head of the human- the locus of his intellect- to the stomach and the intestines, can also be found, for example, in many of Francis Bacon's paint ings . n8-09 The mouth is a most ambiguous interface, since it is the bodily abyss which, fol- lowing Bakhtin's description, gives birth to "low" bodily se- cretions-such as spit- at the same time as it constructs "high" metaphysical words. This equivalence has been a challenge to architects since the early 1990s, and it gave them a pretext to rethink the relationship between architecture's cerebral theories and the new possibilities of materiality, physicality, and atmosphere. A whole series of architectural projects since the early 1990s can be invoked to illustrate this ambivalence. NOX and Lars Spuybroek's H20 Pavilion in Neeltje Jans in the Neth- erlands (1994-97) is of particular interest in this context since, in this project, "space" is no longer understood as a void that is delineated by a material container; rather, archi- tectural space congeals into a plasmatic atmosphere in its own right. The pavilion is conceived as a place to raise awareness of the scarcity of water, and thus it devises a choreographed, interactive water "experience." In it, the visitor's body is immersed in a dense environment, which formally resembles hu- man entrails and which performs in metabolic ways: exhibition visitors enter into the pavilion's longitudinal space and, while moving through it, activate sensors that control light, sound, digital projections, and water nozzles . Fi8s,10&gt; 11 Here, ar- chitecture is thought of in terms of an ephemeral experience which is contingent on the visitor's movements. This is Spuy- broek's way of challenging the traditional relationship between the spectator- subject and the static object of architecture: the pavilion does not define a "place" for observation, but is conceptualized as a mere passageway, embodying flux and move- ment. The visitor passes through an environment which liter- ally materializes as mist is sprayed throughout the pavilion's interior. Architectural perception here is no longer organized around a spatial interval or distance between the subject and the building, which thus creates the possibility for - Fig. 09 Francis Bacon, Head VI, 1949. - Fig. 10 INOX, H20 Pavilion aerial photo, Neeltje Jans, The Netherlands, 1994-97. - Fig. 11 NOX, H20 Pavilion interior photo, 1994-97. THE REAL PERSPECTfl 42</page><page sequence="8">175 Emmanuel Petit a contemplative and visual apprehension; instead, the subject now participates in the building's metabolic exchange as if swallowed by it. Much like the skin of the body, the building's "container" is turned into a formless membrane, ostensibly to assure the performance of the building, which is contingent on local prerequisites. The architecture's metaphorical reference to the biological "lower stratum" of the body (entrails, in- testines) cannot be ignored; the grotesque iconography puts the subject in the very unusual position of being the only recog- nizable "form" or façade in this environment. It is as if the subject visited the inside of his own body, a sensation that corresponds perceptually with the intense feeling of complete spatial immersion. The metaphorical weight of this building is not merely casual or accidental. Indeed, shortly after completing the H20 pavilion, NOX designed a project for the Expo. 02 "The Future is Now" in Biel, Switzerland; in the project brief, Spuybroek is explicit about his intentions to revisit the body's in- terior through architecture. F|s-12 In it, he explains that his architecture "is to show the future not as an 'object' far away in space, but as something hidden in the present and inside ourselves. ... One [is] surrounded by molecules, constantly dividing up and making new connections."14 Architecture here distances itself from its traditions of static and theatrical form and seeks to connect to the dynamism of organic morpholo- gies in the state of perpetual transition. It is, of course, hopelessly early to conclude what the cultural meaning could be of architecture's turn to the grotesque body towards the end of the 20th century. On the one hand, the generation of architects who constructed their con- ceptual identities in the past two decades needed to swing the pendulum away from postmodernism. This move, arguably, meant investing more energy in visiting the inscrutable performance of the formless than in tuning the superstructure of form to- ward public communication and consumption. On the other hand, the "mere" switch of the lexicon of descript ion-f rom metaphors of the humanist body to the grotesque body- could indicate both a modification of the aesthetic basis of the discipline and a thorough shift of consciousness on the part of the contem- porary subject. I submit that, in a "global" world, in which mass media promote and market the illusion of increased con- trol of the subject over an ever larger portion of his or her environment, architects feel a relative impotence in upholding their tradition of "metaphysical" jurisdiction (their "façade") over the obj ect -world. Instead of using architectural repre- sentation as a mirror of that disillusionment (which is an unavoidable by-product of the recognition of the loss of con- trol), architects have decided to venture into an alternative sphere of metaphors, a world that has always subsumed notions of the unconscious, the instinctive, the performative, and the impulsive, all of which are now accepted categories of intel- lectual inquiry. The "opening up" of the body of architecture towards the outside world, through conceptual apertures and extensions, also suggests the acceptance of the relative vul- nerability of the architect. While I have traced the formalist symptoms of this changed relationship to the environment, one can easily imagine how this new consciousness impinges on the political body in an equally dramatic way. At this very moment, when the global colonization of the world by the subject seems most possible (and the world seems "wide open"), we find that very subject compelled again to revisit the hidden places of its own being.
