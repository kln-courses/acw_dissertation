<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE INTERPRETATION OF 15 i'01' V-p, HAB. 3:4. BY PROFESSOR WILLIAM R. ARNOLD, PH.D., Andover Theological Seminary. In his article on the word "Horn" in the Encyclopeadia Biblica, Cheyne says: The usual explanation is unquestionable in such passages as the fol- lowing: 1 Sam. 2:1, "By Yahw6 my horn is exalted"; Ps. 89:17 (18), "By thy favor our horn is exalted"; Ps. 75:4 (5), "Lift not up your horn"; Jer. 48:25, "The horn of Moab is cut off" (cf. Lam. 2:3 ["He hath cut off in the heat of anger all the horn of Israel"]). In such pas- sages "horn" symbolizes power, and its exaltation signifies victory .. and deliverance. . . . . In other passages it will not suit. The difficult passages are: Job 16:15, '0:p 1Y; =n5y, "I have thrust my horn into the dust;" Amos 6:13, l   S;i D'j p, "Have we not taken unto ourselves horns ?" Exod. 34:29, 30, 35, '1' ? il p of Moses; Job 42:14, Job names his third daughter "-1 'p, literally, "Horn of stibium;" and our pas- sage, Hab. 3:4, 1 '"2 C't;'IP. Of the first passage Cheyne says: To "lift up thy horn" may be to increase in power, or to show a proud sense of greatness; but it is hardly safe to maintain, on the ground of a single doubtful passage, that "to thrust it into the dust" (Di), or to "defile it in the dust," is a Hebrew phrase for feeling the sense of deepest humiliation. In Hebrew idiom, people "roll in the dust" themselves (Mic. 1:10) not their "horn." The remedy is to examine the text, and to see what errors the scribe was most likely to have committed. Accordingly he would read ".7 'yW = " , "I have profaned my glory in the dust." In Amos 6:13, with Gratz, who is fol- lowed also by Wellhausen, G. A. Smith, and Nowack (also now by Marti, Dodekapropheton), he renders Q'' as a proper name, "Have we not taken Karnaim?" In Exod. 34:29, 30, 35, again, he substitutes for 'p, p , "lightened." Similarly in our pas- sage he would read I '177Z "pj', "He had lightnings coming out of his hand." Of the name 1'5I p he says: That the term "horn" can be used of a horn-shaped vessel is intel- ligible (1 Sam. 16:1, 13; 1 Kings 1:39). Such a phrase as "horn of pig- ment for anointing the eyelashes" is therefore itself possible. But was 167</page><page sequence="2">168 HEBRAICA there ever a father in ancient legend who gave this name to his daughter, as Job is said to have done in MT of Job 42:14 ? It seems to me that Cheyne has done important service in pointing out substantial difficulties too likely to be overlooked; but we must, as usual, be slow to adopt the drastic remedies he suggests. The first recourse in the interpretation of an obscure passage whose traditional text construes without grammatical violence is to investigate anew the meaning of the words. The most difficult, upon the basis of the current interpretation of the word "horn," and so the most inviting, is the passage Hab. 3:4. As will be recalled, this verse occurs in the graphic and more or less anthropomorphic description' of the progress of 1iK in the so-called Psalm of Habakkuk. Beginning with vs. 3: Eloah cometh from Teman, And the Holy One from the mountain of Paran; His majesty hath obscured the heavens, And his acclaim hath filled the earth. Then follows the verse, % : VT:-" . ": - .. T - There is, to begin with, a difficulty in the Massoretic vocaliza- tion of the first clause. Wellhausen, who renders it "Ein Glanz wie des Lichtes war es," admits: "Nur das Femininum ' rn lasst sich nicht erklaren." In my judgment, it can be easily explained (Gesenius-Kautzsch, 144c) by pointing 'M: and rendering: "When he gleams, it is as the daylight." On the remainder of the verse the Arabic gives us help. Under the root i~ the Lisan ul 'Arab (XVII, p. 209) has: i of the ox and such like is the horn (j..;) and its plural is ~ and it is not otherwise broken (has no other plural); and its place (the spot corresponding thereto) on the head of man is likewise '9. ... And I is the forelock (R..zi), and some limit its appli- cation to the forelock of the woman and to her braid (*i?.tb), and the plural is ? and b; . ... And the L. of the man is the crown of the head ..... (p. 211). A certain one (not Alexander)2 was called 1" Mythologisch stilisirte Gewitterbeschreibung " (Wellhausen). 2 The Arabs have various explanations of the epithet as applied to Alexander the Great in Sura 18: 82; see the Lisdn, XVII, p. 211, top, and NOldeke, Geschichte der Koran, p. 106, n. 4.</page><page sequence="3">THE INTERPRETATION OF *5 171 =Tp, HAB. 3:4 169 .y ) because he had two locks that he braided on the two horns of his head and let them hang down (JJ a .. . ,, Q+% . .

And said Abu Sufyan Bnu Harb to Ul 'Abbas Bnu 'Abd il Mutallib, what time he beheld the faithful and their respectful demeanor toward the Lord's apostle--God's peace be upon him!- and their rev- erence of him as he presided at their prayers, "I have not seen such demeanor as this to-day among any people, no not among the chivalrous Persians nor among the Greeks i ob ." They are called t) in allusion to the continuance of their dominion from age to age (y Ut (.A -Y); and others say (and these are doubtless correct) they are so named in allusion to the horns of their hair and their custom of growing it long, for they never cut it, and every braid of the braids of the hair is a horn (L.O ..) 0,1J '3J. ,~2 ) Lane would seem not to have fully understood the verse quoted in his lexicon under the word I "I swear that I will not forget one person's loan Until my horns are threaded with white." The testimony of the Arab authors is amply confirmed by first-hand evidence as to the modern Beduin use of the word and the custom which underlies it.' Doughty is worth quoting' (he is traveling among the tribes in the vicinity of Medain Salih): I rode with an acquaintance to a booth which stood upon the stony bank at a hollow seyl-side, and alighted with a present of tittun. I found the good housewife at home, her forelock hanged braided as a horn, with a threaded bead upon it--the manner in some northwest districts. 3 Cf. also Ibn Hisham, note on pp. 186 sq.; Al BelAdhuri, pp. V sq., and DeGoeje's note on p. 85; Wellhausen, Reste arabischen Heidentums, pp. 197 sq., 250; Jacob, Das Leben der vorislamischen Beduinen, p. 47. 4 See Burton, Pilgrimage to El Medina and Meccah, Vol. II, p. 81 (with illustrations). 5 Arabia Deserta, Vol. I, p. 382.</page><page sequence="4">170 HEBRAICA And p. 469 (still in the vicinity of Medain Salih): Mishwat was sturdy, but he could not be master with his wives: Abdullah's mother could so daunt him with her tongue! the other, a younger woman, had lately fled from him. Mishwat sighed manly when he spoke of her; she was gone from her place in the household, but not out of his aching heart: "She is beautiful, he said to me, she has horns that reach down to her middle [italics mine]." Seldom or never have the nomad women very long hair, and it is not thick. Side-locks are worn by men at their natural length: so it is said in praise of a young man's fortunate beauty, "he has great and long horns." Mohammed Ibn Rashid, the Shammar prince, hardly at the middle age, is of less than princely looks, but the Beduins say, commending him, "It is a fair young man, he has goodly horns." Elder men at length renounce this ornament of their regretted youth, but there are some which never do wear them. And Vol. II, p. 220: These nomad hareem in Nejd were veiled with a face-clout, but only from the mouth downward; they wore a silver ring in the right nostril, and a braided forelock hanging upon the temples. In this light, it seems to me, must be interpreted the figurative language of many Old Testament passages: Deut. 33:17; 1 Sam. 2:1, 10; Jer. 48:25; Ezek. 29:21; Micah 4:13; Zech. 2:4; Pss. 75:5, 6, 11; 89:18, 25; 112:9; 132:17; 148:14; Lam. 2:3, 17. Doubtless in some of these passages the tropical use of "horn" with conscious reference to its original physical sense is not so prominent, and it has grown to be little more than an abstract term for "honor" or "pride." In others, a knowledge of the original significance of the term helps us to a better understand- ing of the text. Coming back to Job 16:15, "I have thrust my horn in the dust" is unexceptionable when understood of the forelock. In 42:14 Job names his daughter "Horn (i. e., not "vessel," but "lock, braid") of stibium," or, as we would say, "Raven Locks." Amos 6:13, 1;'0 ?wpmz bb n:prm: ~ n W IZ7 x a: MOVp 1*. The very general character of the context prohibits the assumption of a specific reference to two all but unknown towns, '1 i of 2 Sam. 9:4, 5, and (" ' X) 17:27, and Karnain of 1 Macc. 5: 26, as Gratz, Wellhausen, G. A. Smith, Nowack, and Marti. In the first clause, 1?') 0 is of course not "Unding- Ding, welches keine Realitat hat," as Nowack represents the alternative.

Quite unneces- sary difficulty seems to have been experienced in connection with this same expression 21= N5 by all the commentators on 1 Sam. 17:29, R~W1 11 N*1 1r "- r " T. The trouble has resulted from the wrong construction of N? as attaching to the predication instead of, correctly, to the predicate "217. The sentence XRi ~R "2" is a nominal one, of which MR1 is the subject and N? 1': the predicate; the interrogative I alone modifies the predi- cation as a whole. David inquires, not "Is it not a thing ?" or "Is it not a matter of importance?"' but "Is it nothing ?"-Is the service I have rendered you nothing at all, that you charge me with coming out of idle curiosity ?7 So in our passage in Amos, '1= R X? Z is properly rendered, "Ye that make a fuss (a hullabaloo) over nothing-;" and continuing, b 'i =0 WIN ]'Dp t 1 Mp 1 :pT:1 2 "that say, Have we not in our own strength taken unto ourselves horns?" that is, "risen in the world;" calling up the picture of a strutting dandy. op of Exod. 34:29, etc., is unquestionably a verb with mean- ing "to be bright, lustrous, brilliant;" but it will hardly be denominative, if we may judge by the analogy of Arabic -), "horn," from root , "to be clear, transparent." The Arabs call amber . Finally, our passage in Habakkuk, 1 11'7Z V:I'p should cer- tainly be interpreted, "He hath horns that reach below his hand." The omission of the qualifying word (in this case "lower") on which '0 of 17"2 is logically dependent, is quite idiomatic.8 The third clause of our verse now becomes intelligible: =Vi HT. 1 r, "And there (that is, in his long hair) is the deposi- 6 As H.

But David's whole rejoinder is much improved if we construe JVn as a relative, " Ce que je viens de faire, c'est rien? " There are other passages in the Old Testament where, contrary to the current view, 'i must be con- strued as a simple relative: 1 Sam. 20: 10, ~It ip r l r -I 1 n-1-C I, "Who will notify me whether what thy father answers thee is unfavorable ?"

We are, of course, reminded of the story of Samson, whose unshorn braids (r)1E51 ) were the mysterious source of his supernatural strength. On the semi-pronominal use of C3, cf. Gen. 3:23; 10:14; 1 Kings 17:13; Ezek. 5:3. I am inclined to think that 3~'i In~rY of Gen. 14:5 should be interpreted in the same way, as the seat of "Astarte of the two braids"-which accords with the representation of the goddess. Perhaps so also the name "Saturnus Balcaranensis" (V'1p br=) of the Carthaginian inscriptions.' Professor Moore has shown that there is no respectable manuscript authority for holding that the Greek of Gen. 14:5 read n-=iP y . 9 Otherwise Moore, Journal of Biblical Literature, 1897, pp. 155 sq.</page></plain_text>
