<plain_text><page sequence="1">Charles T. Fritsch, The Anti-anthropomorphisms of the Greek Pentateuch (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1943). Pp. v, 81. This sane and carefully documented book will be found helpful in the textual criticism of the Greek Pentateuch and in the study of post-exilic Jewish theology. As is well known, the Pentateuch occa- sionally pictures God figuratively as having a human form and as ex- periencing human emotions. Moreover, it attributes thoughts and ac- tions to God which a subsequent over-scrupulous generation of Jewish theologians deemed derogatory to His dignity, honor, and character. These stylistic peculiarities of the Pentateuch are defined by the author as its anthropomorphisms. The means used by the Septuagint translators to remove or moderate these concrete representations of the deity are termed the anti-anthropomorphisms of the LXX. The author notes that they have hitherto been but imperfectly classified and for this reason improperly evaluated. His purpose is to supply this twofold deficiency. The utility of the book will be best appreciated if we give an analysis of its contents.</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 379 The introductory chapter briefly reviews some of the anthropo- morphisms of the Pentateuch and the efforts made by the inspired writers and the scribes to present the deity in more spiritual terms. The first chapter is devoted to the literary devices employed by the LXX to avoid a literal translation of such terms as man, face, eyes, ears, mouth, nostril, and hand when applied to God. The second chapter discusses the manner in which the ideas of repentance, anger, rest, refreshment, and fear, when attributed to God, were rendered by the LXX. The third shows how the name of God was at times altered to escape from any irreverence to God. The fourth reveals that the LXX consistently strove not to describe God as meeting man or as dwelling in some place. The fifth enumerates examples in which the LXX purposely and definitely tones down expressions which may seem to disparage the majesty and honor of God. In the sixth chapter we see how grammatical constructions were occasionally changed to present a more abstract conception- of the deity. The seventh chapter cites instances where circumlocutions were used to emphasize the transcendence of God. The eighth records the efforts made by the LXX to soften certairf expressions relating to sin against God. A few sentences quoted from the author's conclusion will afford us some idea of the results of his investigation. The tendency to spiritualize the conception of God in the LXX by" avoiding anthropomorphic expressions was active; it was not strong enough, how- ever, to make itself felt consistently, except in a comparatively few in- stances (p. 62). The LXX stands at that point where Greek influence begins to make itself manifest in the Jewish religion. The Seventy, how- ever, were restrained by the need of making a faithful translation, and thus did not consistently express their anti-anthropomorphic attitude. This tendency nevertheless is strong enough to give to the LXX a unique char- acter. ... There are two excellent appendices. The first compares codex B with A with respect to their anti-anthropomorphic tendencies. The second shows how Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion rendered the anthropomorphic passages of the Hebrew text in comparison with the LXX. An adequate bibliography and an index of biblical passages enhance the value of this commendable piece of research. Michael J. Gruenthaner, S.J.</page></plain_text>
