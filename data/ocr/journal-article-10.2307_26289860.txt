<plain_text><page sequence="1">£SSAl)S Worshiping the Bear-God Dalma H. Brunauer Clarkson College of Technology Potsdam, New York I In several of his major works, Faulkner grappled with weighty religious issues. In "The Bear," he reached back all the way to the origins of religion itself. From the point of view of religious anthro pology, some excellent material has been written about "The Bear," including Kenneth LaBudde's "Cul tural Primitivism in William Faulkner's 'The Bear"' and John Lydenberg's "Nature Myth in Faulkner's 'The Bear," but one can say a good deal more about this subject still. The origins of religion are, of course, shrouded in mystery. Even geniuses of the order of magnitude of Epicurus and Karl Marx managed to sound ridiculous on this subject. In our own age, fortunate discov eries have aided in the task. The cave paintings in the South of France, especially Lascaux, furnish one set of clues; researches into the cave-chapels of Neanderthal Man suggest another. Taking a giant leap backward into time, to Neanderthal Man, we find suggestions that his first divinity was the bear. Joseph Campbell's Mytki to Livi By gives support to the thesis that bear worship was probably man's oldest religion. Our first tangible evidences of mytho logical thinking are from the period of 7</page><page sequence="2">Neanderthal Man, which endured from ca. 250,000 to ca. 50,000 B.C.; and these comprise, first, burials with food sup plies, grave gear, tools, sacrificed animals, and the like; and second, a number of chapels in high-mountain caves where cave-bear skulls, ceremonially disposed in symbolic settings, have been preserved. The burials suggest the idea, if not exactly of immortality, then at least of some kind of life to come; and the almost inaccessible high-mountain bear-skull sanctuaries surely represent a cult in honor of that great, upright, manlike, hairy personage, the bear. The bear is still revered by the hunting and fishing peoples of the far North, both in Europe and Siberia and among our North American tribes; and we have reports of a number among whom the heads and skulls of the honored beasts are preserved much as in those early Neanderthal caves.2 The Lascaux paintings, dating back to about 30,000-18,000 B.C., are among man's great artistic achievements. As far as we are able to tell, they are magico-religious in nature. They are stupen dous frescoes of the animal world, which man was seeking to conquer through his magic. They are, mainly, pictures of the hunt. The so-called Main Hall of the Lascaux cave is dominated by a frieze of great bulls, but a bear figure, now partly ob literated, was there before the bulls themselves were done. The horse near it, executed in the same technique, is described by Georges Batailles as being one of the oldest in the cave. Batailles says, One of the few figures seriously affected by later additions is the little sepia bear swallowed up in the black of the 8</page><page sequence="3">third bull's chest. Apart from its head, emerging above the bull, and one paw, showing below it, the rest of the bear, although covered over, is still conveyed by the rock's relief, originally employed to heighten the bear's outline.3 The very antiquity of the bear cult seems to set it apart from other ancient cults. As Speck observes, describing bear-worship among North Amer ican Indians, "There is no messianic personage, no deified revealer, no individual founder of doctrines, no transcendental emissary who appeared on earth to teach men the sacred rituals . . . What does this mean?"4 He tentatively answers his own question by describing the outlook, or mentality, which created bear-worship in these words, "It must be an extreme ly old one, predating the age when worshippers began to place anthropomorphism above naturism. From the evidence of Lascaux, it would seem that bear worship there had, by the time of the cave's chief period, given way to a more general animal cult. There is evidence also of the exis tence of shamanism. In all the splendor of the Lascaux paintings, among the teeming pictures of wild horses, bulls, cows, bison, deer, and its faded, ancient bear, there is a single human figure. Compared to the animals, it is crudely drawn, re flecting the belief that a too-realistic likeness could give the person depicted into the power of his enemies. (The purpose of the animal paintings is supposed to have been the acquisition of magic power over the animals.) This awkward human figure is sprawling as though dying or dead. With his bird-standard at his side, he seems a caricature of a man. Yet, he is probably the key to this hunting epic: the medicine man in the throes of an ecstatic trance. The bird mask shows that he is partaking in the bird's nature for the aerial jour ney, and the bird standard is his auxiliary spirit, showing the road to heaven, to which the shaman 9</page><page sequence="4">guides the sacrificed animal.6 This ancient mentality, shamanism, still sur vives in many parts of the world, especially in the circumpolar region of the Northern hemisphere, in Asia, Lapland and Finland, and among North American Indians. It is based on the belief that heaven and earth are inhabited and ruled by spirits with whom the shaman is in communication. "The shaman is medicine man, priest and psychopompos; that is to say, he cures sicknesses, he directs the communal sacrifices, and he escorts the souls of the dead to the other world."7 Supervision of the communal hunt is one of his prime duties. "The shaman's powers are vested in his technique of ecstasy; he can leave his body at will."0 The Buryats say of the bear that it was formerly a hunter or a shaman, which was later changed into a bear. Should the animal so wish, it could regain its human form."9 By putting on his sacred bear-costume, the Yenisei Ostiak shaman even today "believes himself to have acquired the power of the bear . . . regarded by the people as an extremely sacred animal."-20 This power has its dangers, however. According to Siber ian legend, the first shaman, Doh, once, flying high, let his sacred soul-shadow fall. Evil spirits captured it and took it to the Queen of the Dead. She wanted to eat it but broke a tooth. From spite, she made it impossible for the shadow to return to the shaman by ncuLLLng -U. by kancU and to a tnze..11 I believe that Faulkner made use of bear-wor ship, including shamanism, in "The Bear." He claimed that he never did a page of research in life--and never forgot anything he did read either.12 But, as Utley convincingly argues, he read widely and must have certainly heard stories of the hunt. The manner in which Faulkner combined and re-worked and expanded the materials of his two earlier sto ries, "Lion: A Story,"13 and "The Bear," Satunday Evening ?oht version-24, into "The Bear,"-25 as we know it from the volume Go Vom, MoieA, shows a 10</page><page sequence="5">progressive mythologization of those materials, from the relatively "straight" narrative of "Lion" to the mythologically charged final version, "The Bear." The first version, "Lion," was published in HaApzA'4 Montkty Magazine in 1935. It has a more humorous effect than the other two versions. Told in the first person by a boy, Quentin, it is the story of a hunting dog, Lion, and a man, Boon, who may be said to be owned by the dog. Boon, not too bright, and utterly devoted to Lion, is part Indian. The bear, Old Ben, hunted and hunter, is a magnifi cent but minor character, and Quentin is not even an eyewitness to the fatal clash between bear and dog. It is related to him by the Negro cook, Ad. The dog attacks the bear; the bear mauls the dog, and Boon, in a desperate attempt to save his dog, stabs the bear to death. A few months later, Quentin sees Boon aqain; the man who had felled the mightly bear has broken his gun in pieces; his words and actions are those of a madman. There are other characters in the story. Quentin's father is mentioned; the chief hunter is a plantation owner by the name of Major de Spain; and, most curious, there is an older white man, Uncle Ike McCaslin, who is an expert on the wilder ness. At the time of the story's action, Quentin is sixteen years old. The incident takes place in the 1870's, in the Mississippi Delta. The second version, entitled "The Bear," was published in The Scutaiday Evening Post, in 1942. This story resembles "Lion," but also differs from it in many ways. It is told in the third person, and, by this time, it is no longer the story of a dog but of the bear, Old Ben. The sixteen-year old boy, the former Quentin, is now called Ike McCaslin. The former Uncle Ike has disappeared; his place is taken by a man called Sam Fathers, son of a Chickasaw chief and a black woman. Sam was sold into slavery by his father, but his character and gifts have earned him a place of 11</page><page sequence="6">respect among white people. Boon, three-fourths white, and one-fourth Indian, waits on Sam hand and foot; young Ike considers Sam his mentor and feels very close to him. The cook's name is changed to Uncle Ash; Ike's cousin is McCaslin Edmonds, or Cass. In this version, Faulkner introduces a little female dog, "the eleventh dog," who represents fool hardy bravery for attacking the bear.16 This dog is different from Ike's own little dog, "the fyce," called Nip,27 whom Ike saves from the bear. By stages, over a period of years, with Sam's coaching, the boy trails the bear, and is rewarded by increas ingly significant epiphanies. First, he only hears the dogs chasing the bear; next, he feels its mys terious presence; then, he sees the bear from a great distance; then, he glimpses the bear's foot prints; then, without a gun, he sees the bear close up. Eventually, he gets an opportunity to take a shot at the bear, but he does not shoot. In trying to understand himself, why he didn't shoot, hç dis cuses the incident with his father. The father quotes Keats to him, and the boy tries to understand it, and isn't sure he understands, and on this note the story ends. The final version, also entitled "The Bear," was published in the same year, 1942, in a volume of stories entitled Go Vom, Motu. Also told in the third person, it is very much longer and more elaborate than the two previous stories combined, chiefly because of the addition of Part IV. In this long section, Ike discovers his grandfather's sins: miscegenation, incest, rape. In an attempt at expiation, he renounces his title to the land and tries to live a Christ-like life as a humble carpenter. Other changes were also made. The "eleventh dog" and the "fyce" are merged into one; the result ant dog is no longer referred to as "she" but "it." Ike's parents are both dead; his cousin McCaslin Edmonds (Cass), and a group of white hunters show 12</page><page sequence="7">a fatherly concern for Ike. The most important changes, however, were made in the figure of Sam Fathers. He did not exist in "Lion," though a white man named Ike had filled his role. In "The Bear" [?o6t version), he was Ike's mentor, no more. Now, he becomes Ike's spiritual father, guiding him at every step from childhood to adulthood. It is Sam's uncanny gifts which enable the hunting party to be successful. He finds and trains Lion, the key to the hunt. He is able to foretell and interpret Old Ben's movements. When Old Ben dies, having fatally wounded Lion, Sam Fathers is found lying on the ground, semi-conscious; soon afterward, he dies, possibly having persuaded Boon to help him depart this life. Boon and Ike give him an Indian funeral and mourn Lion. Two years later, Ike revisits the wilderness and observes Boon's demented behavior. It is significant that the old bear is killed by the only two people in the hunting party who have Indian blood in their veins. Ike does not shoot at all; the other whites and the black cook shoot in vain. It is Boon whose knife finds the vital spot. Sam's new role in this version de serves our close attention. One moment, he is riding with Ike, commenting on the progress of the hunt; next, he is swimming across the river, "faster than the mules." Ike remembers seeing him dismount. Now comes the actual slaying of the bear, and when it is over, Ike sees Sam lying motionless on his face in the mud. There was no mark on him whatever and when he (Ike) and Boon turned him over, his eyes were open and he said something in that talk which he and Joe Baker (another Indian) had used to speak to gether. But he couldn't move.-1® Later, Faulkner says, 13</page><page sequence="8">Sam's eyes were probably open again on that profound look which saw further than them or the hunt, further than the death of a bear and the dying of a dog . . .only the boy (Ike) knew that Sam too was going to die.-'9 His clairvoyance and prescience in predicting Old Ben's behavior throughout the book is one example; his near-superhuman performance at the time of the final hunt is another. "A man his age (seventy) swimming rivers in December!" the doctor exclaims.20 Holmberg tells the stirring story of the shaman in a trance who in the course of fulfilling his duties swam like a whale across a lake.2i We already observed Sam's falling as in a trance, his eyes open, speaking the ancient tongue. His actual death soon after that of Old Ben puts the final seal on his career as shaman. We know from Holmberg that every shaman has a special soul-animal, on which his life and death depend. "Should the animal die of any accidental cause, the death of the shaman follows soon, also."22 Sam knew that he was going to die soon after Old Ben, and, as Ike wisely observed, "he was glad." He had no child/ten, no people, nom o&amp; kù&gt; blood anywheAe above eafitk that he. mould eveA meet again ... It u*xi aùnoàt oveA nom and he wai glad." In this description, more than anywhere else, Sam resembles his shaman-animal, "the old bear, soli tary, indomitable, and alone; widowered Childless. "23 Yet, it seems that Faulkner did not conscious ly or deliberately plan the progressive mythologi zation of Sam's character; the materials gradually shaped themselves to fall into this pattern, as it were. Neither did he stop with Sam. The behavior of Boon following Sam's death is worth examining. Boon, with Ike's help, buries Sam in a manner directed by Sam: "The platform of freshly cut saplings bound 14</page><page sequence="9">between four posts and the blanket-wrapped bundle upon the platform . . . This is the way he wanted it. He told us. He told us exactly how to do it. And by God you aint going to move him . . \"24 Boon defends Sam's burial platform, with a gun, against all comers. Compare this manner of burial with shaman burials among the Tungus of Siberia: "The Tungus of the Yenisei believe that if a shaman is buried in the earth and not on an erection in the air, the soul-bird of the shaman will return no more to his family."25 This soul-bird is the wandering soul of the shaman, and its reappearance is re garded as a great honor. It seems to me that Boon, the faithful friend and associate of Sam, is in the process of acquiring the role of the shaman. Some light may be shed on Boon's behavior by the following parallels. Among the Tungus, "When the spirit has appeared to a candidate, the latter begins to withdraw from the company of his fellows, has difficult nerve-attacks of hysteria and epi lepsy, behaving at times as though his mind were unhinged."26 Half the world away, among the Lapps of Northern Europe, "At the first call of the spirits, the Lapp (shaman-candidate) behaved like one mentally afflicted." He forsook family and home and "wandered around in the forests or on the mountains."27 As Sam before him, Boon now forsook the world and wandered alone, behaving as one mentally afflicted. Whether he eventually became a shaman, Faulkner does not say. We can safely say, however, that if Boon did become a shaman, adopting the soul-spirit of Lion, he was to be pitied. The Yakuts say that if the shaman animal is a dog, it never leaves the shaman in peace but "gnaws with its teeth at his heart and tortures his body."20 However, Boon's "madness" may be interpreted in other ways, too. It could have been a punish ment. This point will be made clear in the dis cussion of bear worship itself. 15</page><page sequence="10">II Animal worship has many forms. From the actual worship of the animal itself, it can range through veneration of gods or spirits represented by the animal to mere ceremonial behavior toward the animal. The basis of the worship may be, paradoxically, QÂXheA the strangeness and myster ious superiority of the animal, which renders it "a treasury of fitting symbols for the essentially mysterious and superior otherness of the holy,"29 ok its closeness to or near-identity with man. In the latter category, he may be thought of as an ancestor of the clan or of a chosen individual, or the repository of the life power of a group (totem ism) or of an individual (nagualism.) Veneration of or ceremonial behavior toward an animal may be designed to assure its cooperation in the hunt, or to.avert illness. Bear worship occurs in all these forms. Per haps the simplest way of dealing with its varieties is to subdivide it, roughly, into cults of the bear which involve the hunt and sacrifice, and venera tion accorded to the bear apart from the hunt. The latter category is smaller and easier to deal with. There are myths of descent from the bear. The modocs of California trace their descent from the union of the daughter of the Great Spirit she was blown down Mount Shasta--with a grizzly bear. Before this union, bears were men but now the Great Spirit made them quadrupeds.30 It is easy to see that a Modoc might rightfully address a grizzly bear as "Grandfather." The name of the city of Bern is derived from the word beai. In 1832, a statuette of the goddess Artio (cf. Greek (Ui\vLoi&gt;&gt; Latin uA6oô, Irish &lt;vUt "bear,") was found near Bern, accompanied by the statuette of a bear. 31 In Attica and Arcadia, Artemis, honored as the mother of the tribe, was regarded as a she-bear; in other cases, she was thought of as a hind.32 One of her titles was 16</page><page sequence="11">"Bear Artemis," and one of her myths had her change into a bear. In certain initiation rites, she was called Artemis Brauronia; young maidens could not marry without undergoing these.33 The girl-dancers were regarded as she-bears.34 Van de Leeuw explains, "This was to gain freedom from themselves. Man sought to unite himself with the animal who was the god . . . Sacred games and dances invested the per formers with characters of divine animals ... In search of ecstatic experience, man flees to the completely 'Other' . . . From such animal mask dances, Greek tragedy originated."35 (Piagoecica means "goat song.") Along similar lines, bear and wolf tribes in the old Germanic world were totemistic in the sense that they maintained an essential relationship with the animal and subsisted upon its power. In such intimate relations as marriage, birth, and war, men and animal were bound together. Men could become werewolves, "while in ancient Germanic times we find the beAAeAkA, the 'bear-skinned man' who can transform himself into the bear's shape."36 To return from antiquity to modern rites of the living bear, Hallowell observes that although the Indians of the Plains areas have a high respect for the bear, we find no rites in connection with its slaughter there, except among tribes which have had contact with northern tribes. All of the Plains tribes hesitate to kill the grizzly or, if killed, to eat of it. They consider it a noble antagonist rather than food. In the Plateau area, likewise, living bears are held in high respect. He mentions a Kutenai ceremony, held in the spring, whose purpose is to prevent attacks by grizzlies. The first man who dreams of the bear that season erects an altar in his lodge, with a bearskull as its central feature. People come to wish the bear good luck during the summer; they ask his help for good luck, good health for themselves; they speci fically ask him not to send them illness. Hallowell emphasizes that this rite has no connection with 17</page><page sequence="12">hunting and killing the bear or eating its flesh.37 The most widespread form of bear ceremonialism is the "name taboo." In practically every part of the world where the bear is known, a respectful circumlocution is substituted for the animal's generic name. In Hungary, the usual way to refer to the bear is by calling it 8*eg, banden, or taZpcLi, meaning the "old one," "the one with the fur coat," and "the one with the big sole." All three of these expressions are attested by Hallowell and the Enc.ycZopae.dla of, ReLLgion and Etkia as being of world-wide currency. Other popular cir cumlocutions are "short-tail," "great food," or "black food."55 The last two terms, while used of the living as well as the dead bear, are characteristic of tribes which hunt and eat the bear. This takes us to the major mode of bear worship, that of the hunter. In cultures based on the hunt, wild animals constitute most of the necessary food supply. In contrast with modern white man who considers wild animals as either enemies or legitimate booty, or both, so-called savages have long ago discovered that they ought to treat the animal world with respect. Only by doing so could they assure peace ful coexistence with the living beasts surrounding them and a continued food supply for the future. Some of the strongest taboos concern wanton killing for "sport," and waste of even the smallest part of an animal already slaughtered. Continued supply of meat is promised to man if he observes the rules: shows respect and gratitude to the animal for its cooperation. This is the sense of the many myths current about a primordial covenant between the animal and the human world, presided over by the "Lord of Life" or "Lord of the Forest."39 Such a "Lord of Life" is already found depicted in a cave roughly contemporaneous with Lascaux, the Cave of the Trois Freres.40 This fascinating figure is a composite of man and various animals. A shaman's 18</page><page sequence="13">ceremonial garb, sometimes called "a god," invests the shaman with the power of this "Lord." Hence, it, too, is a composite of parts of, or representa tions of, many animals. The best-known bear cult is that practiced by the Ai no, or Ainu, a Caucasoid race in northern Japan. J. Batchelor is our prime authority on them;42 our earliest description of the bear sacrifice, however, goes back to the seventeenth century.42 Frazer devotes many pages of The Golden Bough to the subject of "Killing the Sacred Bear"; he also attempts to give its rationale. Frazer's theory is that the Aino and other tribes like them need the flesh and skin of the bear for survival. Knowing the bear's intelligence and power, they also know that offerings must be made to give the bear satisfaction and atonement. This is achieved by rearing some young bears lov ingly and then sacrificing them with every mani festation of sorrow and respect. Such appeasement serves a double purpose: the bears should not attack their slayers, neither should they desert the land. Though the Aino bear-cult is extremely inter esting, it has relatively few parallels with Faulkner's work. Its chief distinguishing feature, the custom of capturing bear cubs and rearing them as members of families, seemingly sets it apart from the mainstream of bear-worship elsewhere. The bear is implored not to bear the Aino ill-will but rather to tell the other bears in heaven how well he had been treated during his earthly so journ.43 He is also encouraged to come back to earth again and to bring his friends and rela tives.44 Frazer stresses that, in abbreviated form, the same loving and respectful ceremonies accompany the hunting and killing of bears in the forest also. Thus, apart from the curious custom of the rearing of some bear-cubs for sacrifice, the Aino bear-cult is within the major mode of bear-worship, 19</page><page sequence="14">that of the hunter. Perhaps the most valuable book about bear worship which discloses parallels for an under standing of Faulkner's story is a scholarly mono graph, referred to earlier, The Celutcal B&amp;oa Corner Vom to Ecvuth, written by the anthropologist Frank 6. Speck and his Indian co-worker Jesse Moses. Working among the Munsee-Mahican Indians, Speck discovered an old man, Nekatcit, who had been brought up on Munsee-Mahikan traditions and was an eye-witness of the last bear ceremony held on the Six Nations Indians Reservation in 1850. Underlying the bear ceremony is a beautiful concept. Sky and earth are not widely separated; they are as close in reality as their images on the shaman's drum. The two spheres are joined by the sacred presence of the bear. In the firmament is the visible form of the Celestial Bear, the constellation of U,ua Majori on earth, there are the bears of the forest. The sky bear is eternal; earthly bears perish or are killed and return in spiritual form to the realm above. Each year, one bear is destined to become a vicarious sacrifice to attest the devotion of men to the creed of their ancestral priesthood.45 To the Algonkian mid, the parallel between Celestial Bear and earthly bear is self-evident. The Great Bear, revolving around the North Star, is upright in mid-summer, ascending head up in mid-spring and descending head down in mid-autumn. To the native, this typifies the annual life cycle of the earth bear, which is upright and active in the summer, prostrate in the winter, emerging head up in the spring and entering its den head down in the beginning of winter. Too, he believes "that spirits of slain bears return to life, born again as cubs within a year or so, provided that their slaying has been done in conformity with certain rules for killing and treating remains that govern the hungers and their victims."46 In view of the fact that the bear is the most highly venerated 20</page><page sequence="15">being in the area, a truly impressive cult emerges. "Man is here only as a voluntary actor of a part in which nature sets the stage patterned after the firmament above and animals and men here below . . . It is the bear, a vicar of human need for communi cation between man and the Creator, whose spirit plies between sky and earth."47 The Eastern Woodlands people believe that the bear submits voluntarily to being sacrificed for a destined purpose. Therefore, every aspect connected with the "dreaming of, hunting, killing, consuming and disposal of the body of the bear, all contain true magico-religious formalities."40 Indians of the Montagnais-Naskapi culture, similarly, consider the bear superior to all beasts by virtue of his human physical characteristics and his almost human intelligence."49 "His soul-spirit knows expecially when the hunters are on his trail and so he does what he thinks best to do in order to save himself or else he allows himself to be overtaken and killed."50 Sam Fathers and Ike would have agreed with these beliefs; they actually thought or voiced them. They considered Old Ben a godlike creature, an immortal. The passages describing him as such are among Faulkner's greatest. The first group presents the feelings of Ike McCaslin, age ten: ... the old bear had earned a name . . . not even a mortal beast but an anachron ism indomitable and invincible out of an old dead time, a phantom, epitome and apotheosis of the old wild life which the little puny humans swarmed and hacked at in a fury of abhorrence and fear like pygmies about the ankles of a drowsing elephant;--the old bear, solitary, indomitable, and alone; wid owered childless and absolved of mor tality--5-2 21</page><page sequence="16">To him, they were going not to hunt bear and deer but to keep a yearly rendezvous with the bear which they did not even intend to kill . . . the dogs which feared to bay it and the shotguns and rifles which failed even to bleed it, in the pageant-rite of the old bear's furious immortality.52 shadowy in the limbo from which time emerged and became time; the old bear absolved of mortality53 Old Ben is part of the timeless wilderness: the same solitude, the same loneliness through which frail and timorous man had merely passed without altering it, leaving no mark nor scar, which looked exactly as it must have looked when the first ancestor of Sam Fathers' Chickasaw predecessors crept into it and looked about him, club or stone axe or bone arrow drawn and ready5 This is Sam's appraisal of Old Ben: He dont care no more for bears than he does for dogs or men neither. He come to see who's here, who's new in camp this year, whether he can shoot or not, can stay or not. Whether we got the dog yet that can bay and hold him un til a man gets there with a gun. Be cause he's the head bear. He's the man.55 You watch close tomorrow. Because he's smart. That's how come he has lived this long.56 After a long training in "humility," we read of Ike, 22</page><page sequence="17">Then he saw the bear. It did not emerge, appear: it was just there . . . not as big as he had dreamed it but as big as he had expected, bigger . . . looking at him . . . Then it was gone. It didn't walk back into the woods. It faded, sank back into the wilderness57 And still later, he saw it cross a long corridor of down timber where a tornado had passed. It rushed through rather than across a tangle of trunks and branches as a locomotive would, faster than he had ever believed it could have moved, al most as fast as a deer55 And still, Sam the shaman teaches the boy to believe that the immortal bear can be killed, will be killed, when his time comes, when he will be ready to give his consent. "Somebody is going to, some day." "I know it," the boy said. "That's why it must be one of us. So it wont be until the last day. When even he dont want it to last any longer."59 Among many American Indians, the bear's con sent was necessary. The stages of the ceremony were the "dreaming" of the bear, followed by the hunting and killing; then came the consuming of the bear's flesh and the reverent disposal of his skull and bones. The first three of these stages were laboriously reconstructed by old Nekatcit in a connected narrative of the last bear ceremony among the Munsee-Mahicans, also called Twenyucis's Dream. Among the Delawares and the Iroquois--the Munsee-Mahicans among them--it was the office of a 23</page><page sequence="18">woman to dream the bear's hibernating place. In Nekatcit's charming story, the last time this happened among his people, the woman's name was Twenyucis. She was probably the hereditary "chief maker," the woman who selected the ruling chief. She told the chief exactly where the twelve men of the Big House--their temple--had to go, not to the oak tree, "that's a smooth bear," a taboo animal, but to the elm tree leaning toward the east. She instructed them to keep overnight vigil by that tree, to hit that tree three times, to tell the bear, "I find you." The twelve men and their leader by the name of Maxkok, probably the medicine man or shaman, did what she told them to. When the bear looked out of the tree, Maxkok told him, "Come down, the chief wants your body." "Then," Nekatcit remembers, "that bear climbed down." He went with the men and obeyed them, up to a point. Then, at a spot pointed out by Nekatcit, he lay down and refused to budge. The chief himself had to come out of the Big House and sacrifice him on the spot. When the chief said, "Right here we will have to kill you. We want your body for the Big House," the bear got up, eyes closed, waiting for the final blow. "He never kicked," Nekatcit tells us. In the Big House—which was demolished for firewood as late as 1939--the elaborate Bear Cere mony was held. The bear was skinned, its hide put in the place of honor; dreams were recounted; there was a Bear Dance and a Feast; the chief preached sermons for several nights; all these activities were regulated by the phases of the moon. The bear was captured at the New Moon in January; the first four nights and the first part of the fifth night were given over to a series of sermons and thanks givings delivered by the chief; on the fifth night when the moon had become about half full, there were chants; on the eighth or tenth night, they chanted dreams and danced the Bear Dances until sunrise. Nightly, the chief admonished the people, 24</page><page sequence="19">"Be good to one another."60 As all proper bear-worshippers know, the "black food" must be overcome in spirit by the soul spirit of the hunter. Among the Naskapi, this is sometimes done by repeated visits to a sauna-bath by the hunter. There, too, hints as to the bear's whereabouts come in a dream or by luck. The air hole of the beast is found and surrounded. The call is issued, three times, "Come out, Grandfather!"61 If that does not accomplish its purpose, they try, "Come out, Grandmother!" Once the bear complies, they insure the cooperation of next year's occupant by placing tobacco into the lair. The dead bear's spirit, too, is propitiated by a peace-pipe and other delicacies, offered on the spot. The method of killing the bear is rigorously circumscribed. Depending on the tribe, the method may be, deadfall, ax, arrow, or spear, or, extreme ly rarely, a gun. "The Montagnais-Naskapi, as well as the Penobscot, consider it proper to strike the animal with an axe as it emerges from its den. In the old days the latter people say that sometimes the bear would be attacked in the open by three or four hunters, amo-d only with theJA kn-iveA lashed on canoe poles or staves . . . Among the Cree, in the old days, the hunters engaged the bear in hand, to hand conflicts and clubbed it to death . . . Even at present, . . . bears caught in steel traps are sometimes killed by striking them over the head with an axe . . . "62 The reluctance to use a gun when hunting bears seems to have deep traditional roots. Faulkner made effective use of relevant folk beliefs in "The Bear." Ike is not even vouchsafed a close look at the bear until, at Sam's urging, he relinquishes his gun.63 When Boon's knife lays Old Ben low, Ike comments on the "little hard lumps under his skin which were the old bullets (there were fifty-two of them . . .)"64 Now fifty-two, as everyone knows, is the number of weeks in the year, and thus a num ber of symbolic value. The men of Odysseus, in 25</page><page sequence="20">killing the three hundred and sixty sacred kine of the sun-jjod, sinned by symbolically killing Time itself; they magically ended their own lives. Past bu«ters, by attempting to shoot Old Ben to death, were also guilty, if not of sacrilege, at least of futility. The sacred bear had to die by a hunter's knife or not at all. The strict ceremonialism of the bear-hunt among North American Indians has parallels in other cultures also, with the killing of the sacred king. That ritual murder, too, was done at a specific time of the year, with elaborate preparations, with prescribed weapons and ceremonial formulas. The purpose, too, was similar: to assure the tribe's food supply for the coming year. The ax of the bear-hunt has its analogue in the sacred labrum of Crete; arrows and spears likewise abound in ritual killing. A particularly horrible method involved being torn to pieces by wild women. In discussing ritual murder, Graves mentions that the king's flesh was often eaten raw by the Queen's fellow nymphs, priestesses wearing masks of bitches, mares and sows.66 From this point of view, it may be considered appropriate that the fierce little dog of the first bear-hunt in the Scutividau Evening ?o*t version of "The Bear" was a bitch.67 With respect to the role of dogs in bear cere monialism, a strong taboo emerges. This is as widespread as the Gilyaks of Asia and the Naskapi Indians of the Labrador Peninsula. While all of the bear's meat must be eaten in the course of the ceremonies, "no dogs are admitted lest the spirits of the animals (bears) be offended."6 Among the Gilyaks, "After the bear has been killed, dogs are sacrificed in couples of male and female. Before being throttled, they are fed and invited to go to their lord on the highest mountain, to change their skins and to return the next year in the form of bears. The &amp;oul the dead beat depanU . . . attended by the i&gt;ouLt&gt; oh the dog*."69 26</page><page sequence="21">In Faulkner's novel also the soul of the bear departs, attended by the soul of a dog. Old Ben and Lion go to the Lord of the Forest together. However, there is a difference. I pointed out be fore that Boon's madness may be a temporary afflic tion, the trial of the apprentice shaman. On the other hand, it may be a permanent madness, a pun ishment by the bear-god for not following the rules of the bear sacrifice. Perhaps Old Ben was not ready to die yet, perhaps he did not give his con sent. There is some evidence, however, that this is not the case. Sam was anxious to die, and prob ably Old Ben felt the same way. More likely the punishment had other reasons. Perhaps a dog should not have been used in the hunt; but this, too, is hypothetical. In fact, it seems almost essential that the soul of the dead royal bear should be accompanied by the soul of the royal dog. The most probable reason for Boon's punishment--if it was a punishment--was the indignities accorded to Old Ben after his death. His dead body was treated very differently from the dignified ceremonies the bear god should receive. His body was dragged on the earth by the mule, his paw was cut off and buried with Lion. Here is a cross-section of customs governing the bear-feast and the proper disposal of the bear's remains: As a rule, no food of vegetable origin is allowed at a bear-feast; no salt is used. Both of these taboos attest to the great antiquity of the cult. Among the Naskapi, the bear is skinned dif ferently from other animals, the incision being made at the throat, out of respect. The paw must not be cut off.70 The Ai no apologize to the bear and to their gods for "killing the dear little divine visitor." In killing it, no blood must be spilled. (It is quickly and skillfully strangled.) Its own flesh and blood are placed before it; then, everyone partakes of its cooked flesh and its blood. The "cup of offering" must be taken by all; its 27</page><page sequence="22">flesh likewise. Not to partake of this sacrament "would put the recreant outside the pale of Aino fellowship." Every particle must be consumed. These rites also include sacrifice of dogs. Frazer comments that the prayers addressed to the worship ful animal seem to point to a firm faith in the spiritual immortality and bodily resurrection of the bear.7J The Kwakiutl hunter steps up to the dead bear and says, "Thank you, friend, for meeting me. I did not do any harm to you. You came to meet me sent by our creator that I should shoot you that I may eat together with my wife and friend." The slain bear is placed, adorned, in a sitting posture before the whole assembly, food is placed before it, speeches are made. The people advance one by one, and take its paws in hand, worshipfully. Little dramas are enacted, the hunter suggesting to the bear to bring the rest of his family, and then answering in the bear's name, "I am going to do so."72 Finno-Ugric peoples have similar customs. To make sure that the dead bear will not harbor a grudge against the slayers, they pretend that it was the Swedes or the Germans who had killed it. They adorn the dead bear with jewelry appropriate to Its sex; it is considered a grave offense even to laugh in its presence. After eating every par ticle of its flesh, they carefully reassemble its bones, even the smallest, and bury it reverently, with food, drink, and cherished possessions in the grave. (Skis, knife, tools.) Funeral games are held, as to the dead heroes in the Greek world. Bear-songs are sung, bear-dramas enacted. The Ostiaks explain that they do these things to do honor to the whole race of bears. The Finns call the bear-feast "a wedding" and records of such elaborate wedding-feasts go back to the early seventeenth century. The Gilyaks deck the bear's head with sacred wood-shavings, "beg his pardon and worship him." 28</page><page sequence="23">They eat his flesh out of specially carved vessels, themselves objects of veneration. The skull is kept. Then the people sing and "both sexes dance in ranks, as bears."74 The Ai no set up the bear's head on a long pole beside the sacred wands, inao. (Compare Sam Father's grave with its freshly cut saplings.) When all but the white skull is gone, they still worship the skull, because, according to Batchelor, the Aino believe that the spirit still resides in the skull.75 The Naskapi do not burn the bear's claws "lest he could not dig out of his den in the fall when time comes for him to go hibernating."76 This clear cut belief in the bear's reincarnation is paralled by the Ostiak belief "that the bear will arise again and allow itself to be shot," if treated with re spect. Among the Escoumains, on a poplar sapling bor dering the Indian graveyard, bear skulls hang, "generations of remains of both hunters and their victims foregathered within the common precincts until their next reincarnation." They paint the skulls vermillion, believing that it will be a source of spiritual satisfaction to the bear to be thus adorned and to be placed high, to be able to oversee the landscape he has always known. Such tree burial, Speck observes, shows recognition of the immortality of the bear. To remove such a skull is a great offense.78 While on the subject of reincarnation, Frazer mentions the Gilyak belief that if a Gilyak falls in combat with a bear, his soul transmigrates into the body of the animal.79 Among Ugrian peoples, similarly, the "bear-like spirit" of the shaman, in Holmberg's interpretation, is "doubtless a meta morphosis of his soul."80 Ike McCaslin could not know any of this. No one told him that Old Ben was treated badly. But his instincts were right. Two years later, just before meeting the demented Boon in the wilderness, he meditated: 29</page><page sequence="24">there was no death, not Lion and not Sam: not held fast in earth but free . . . and Old Ben too, Old Ben too; they would give him his paw back even, cer tainly they would give him his paw back. . . .81 III We saw, in Part I, that bear worship, with shamanism, may have been man's oldest religion. In Part II, I tried to show later bear-worship in its great variety. Both of these phases of the bear cult were shown side by side with examples from Faulkner's "The Bear," to demonstrate how Faulkner used religious motifs in his book. Nevertheless, there is much material omitted here, out of con sideration of length. For instance, the whole fas cinating interrelationship of the bear with the moon and with Artemis, and the bear's double role as hunter and hunted had to be omitted because Faulkner'; interest in these subjects, while present, seems relatively slight. I can only touch now upon the development of the institution of the sacrifice also. It is per haps worthwhile to note that bear-sacrifices were later replaced by sacrifice of the sacred king, still later by that of boy-surrogates, and then by that of animals in place of boys. The sacrifice of Isaac, in the Book of Genesis, represents a border line case of the last two of these, and is alluded to by the name "Isaac" McCaslin. Perhaps the sacri fice of Old Ben in place of Ike is a parallel to the biblical story. I cannot omit, however, the role which Christi anity plays in the book. Between the ages of eight een and twenty-one, Ike McCaslin became a Christian. He made the change from the oldest religion, venera tion of the bear, to the newest, the Imitation of Christ. But, remarkably, he did not quite give up the old religion either. For as long as he lived, 30</page><page sequence="25">for nearly sixty more years, he repeated his annual pilgrimage to what little was left of the wilderness. In keeping his old religion, he kept what was best in it--which, in his case, did not differ great ly from what is best in Christianity. He has the qualities praised by his father--or, in the final version, Cass--"Courage, and honor, and pride . . . and pity, and love of justice and of liberty."82 He also has "a soul, a spirit capable of compassion and sacrifice and endurance."83 He was fair-minded, and brave, and loyal. He loved all men, and animals, and he loved God's Nature and tried to live in harmony with all of them. The two religions are in this respect very close. Chesterton, the Christian apologist, said, "We talk of wild animals; but man is the only wild ani mal. It is man that has broken out. All other animals are tame animals; following the rugged re spectability of the tribe or type."84 Mircea Eliade, in discussing bear-worship in the context of moon worship, says, "All these sym bols, hierophanies, myths, rituals . . . are bound together like one great cosmic 'net,' a vast web in which every piece fits and nothing is isolated from the rest . . . They reveal life repeating it self rhythmically."85 The rape of the wilderness, heralded by the killing of the old bear, put an end to that rhythmic repetition forever. The Indians knew this. Speck quotes an Indian sermon, God hangs a kettle, and there is plenty of food. You go there and serve yourself ... Do not take the kettle away. God has left the kettle with you. If you take it away, he will put it somewhere else.86 We haven't learned that lesson yet. But, with the help of authors like Faulkner, perhaps we are at last beginning to learn it. 31</page><page sequence="26">NOTES 2 Francis Lee Utley, Lynn Z. Bloom and Arthur F.
