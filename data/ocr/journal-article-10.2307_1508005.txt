To what green altar, O mysterious priest, Lead'st thou that heifer lowing at the skies, And all her silken flanks with garlands drest? AN INSCRIPTION from the Areopagus recently published by Meritt in Hesperia (XI, 1942, 282 if.) has thrown new light on the structure of the type of association of which the members were called orgeones. The occasion thus presents itself to bring together what we now know about this obscure Athenian institution.' The ancient records show that while orgeones, like gennetai for example, was a technical term, it lacked a corporate noun. Hence makeshifts had to be used in finding a substitute. It is a pleasure and a duty for the authors to acknowledge their indebtedness to a number of friends. Professor Campbell Bonner, of the University of Michigan, very kindly read a first draft of the whole and a second draft of Nock's part, greatly to the advantage of the paper. Professor Benjamin D. Meritt of the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, came to our aid, when consulted, with his usual courtesy; and so did our colleagues at Harvard, Professors Joshua Whatmough, George H. Chase, Werner Jaeger, John Finley, Sterling Dow, and Dr. Herbert Bloch. Ferguson is specifically indebted to Professor Dow for writing Appendix 3, and Nock to Dr. Francis R. Walton for helpful criticism. 1 Two cases are known of non-Athenian orgeones, one from Megara (IG VII 33, dated by Dittenberger on the basis of spelling "before imperial times") and the other from Teos (Michel, Recueil, 1307, ca. 150 B.c.). Though in each case the name is due in part to restorations, the restorations are not improbable. In IG VII 33 the name heads a list of four persons, in Michel, 1307, it appears in one of fourteen crowns cut on a grave monument. I am inclined to believe that we have to do with borrowings from Athens (cf. Poland, Geschichte des griechischen Vereinswesens, 15); but the use of the word in a non-specialized sense by the poets (cf. Appendix 1) may explain its appearance outside Attica in these late texts.</page><page sequence="6">62 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Gennetai could refer to themselves and could be referred to as a genos. Orgeones, however, had to designate themselves, when the situation required it, as an association simply (koinon) or as a thiasos,2 a more expressive term, but one commonly avoided because it was used in a technical sense by the phra- tries and in a general sense with a certain flavor of festive dis- orderliness. One late organization, which accommodated itself to contemporary usage by substituting on occasion for orgeones the name derived from the god it served, Dionysiastai, em- ployed as a self-determinant the colorless collective synodos. This lack of a specific corporate substantive was an embarrass- ment to the orgeones themselves in making their records and to us in analyzing them and presenting their contents to our readers. The word orgeones has no English equivalent. "Sacrificing associates" is as near as we can come to its mean- ing. I. References to orgeones were obviously not infrequent in classical literature. Hence in the lists of hard words or proper names, not self-explanatory, out of which the ancient Greek lexicons developed, definitions of the term, drawn from vari- ous sources, were regularly given. It would serve no purpose to quote all these definitions. Some of them which identify orgeones and gennetai (Pollux, III 52; Bekker Anecd. Gr. I 927; Etym. Magn. s.v. ypvvprac), or orgeones and thiasotai (Etym. Magn. 454) are manifestly incorrect. Others which elucidate the general character of the orgeones or differentiate them from other analogous organizations are helpful. Suidas gives various definitions s.v. 6py~iEvs- "Seleukos states in his commentary on the axones of Solon that persons holding meet- ings centering in various heroes or gods were called orgeones"; "orgeones are those sacrificing to gods privately founded. 'Op-yt'?Ew means to perform the 'orgies' of the gods, that is, mysteries and customary rites."3 (.2XEvKos 5' v E' in7-oLct'ra1- 2 Thiasos occurs in a poem (IG II2 2948), and its use there is determined by poetic diction and the exigencies of meter (cf.

In this text the position of iIpwas is note- worthy, and, doubtless, deliberate, since it was natural for a Greek to give precedence to OEobs. Seleukos knew, I think, that orgeones were primarily concerned with heroes. Harpocra- tion's definition runs (s.v. 6p-ye-Pas): "orgeones are those meet- ing to honor gods or heroes. 'OpytaL'EtP means to sacrifice and perform customary rites (ObELV Kal rd- voMuLtObea 6pav)." Harpo- cration and Suidas append this item: "Possibly it was after- wards the custom for individuals coming together to do honor to the dead also to be named thus, i.e. orgeones, as is to be seen from the will of Theophrastos" (M1WrorE &amp;i DJo7EpoP ,EVb- lto'rat 7" 'rrtu rTEA LV rcs,' 'i w oOrVTW OwVtLWEat; Kal bpy'ewas b6oio.s wvotEclOat, oS nL vwvtMEi dEK P OEo~pda7ov tao~lK). Pol- lux 8, 107 gives this definition: "orgeones are persons who throughout Attica (or, taking Kara distributively, "grouped some in one deme and some in another") offer certain sacrifices on set days" (o0 Ka7- l, tovs ~' TaKTa ?s -ipats Obove-s Ovoias rnYds). Harpocration s.v. rqI/ore7-EX Kai 7r1ortK a ItEph reports: "Sacrifices given at the public cost and by the demes differ from one another and from the sacrifices of orgeones and gene, as Deinarchos makes clear in his speech against Stephanos." This point is elaborated without significant additions in Bekker Anecd. Gr. I 240, 28. It must be conceded that these definitions are not very in- formative. They suffice, however, to establish the distinc- tiveness of the association, and they relate the orgeones to sacrifices offered at the shrines of heroes or gods throughout Attica on the occasions set for reunions there of the members. They list various meanings, real or supposed,4 of the word bpEWjvEs, which help us little; but they give us a basis for dis- "funeral rites" when coupled with bp-yt,ty (Nock). The word occurs only once in the official records of the orgeones. In the poem inscribed on a stele set up in the shrine of the Dionysiastai (below, 116) we find r6o ao-Ev, BaKXE, r o-O1 v,6ita (IG II2 2948). Here the word means anything but funeral rites. 4 See Appendix 1.</page><page sequence="8">64 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW tinguishing the class of orgeones - those centered in heroes or gods (Class A below, p. 73 ff.) -, the mention of which in classi- cal texts prompted the lexicographers to explain what they were, from a second class of orgeones (Class B below, p. 95 ff.), which the lexicographers neglected and which the inscriptions have brought to our attention. From the definitions, such as they are, we learn that the sacrifices offered by the orgeones were paid for by the orgeones themselves, not by the state, and that the shrines in which they were offered were established by private, not by public, action. The citation of Seleukos is important for the history of the institution since it makes it humanly certain that orgeones were mentioned in the laws of Solon. II. A second group of sources relating to orgeones consists of two Athenian laws, which both extend our knowledge of the history of the association and relate it to the state. An excerpt from the code of Solon made in the Digest (XLVII, 22, 4) runs as follows: "If a demos, or phratries, or orgeones of heroes, or gennetai, or messmates, or funerary associates, or thiasotai, or pirates, or traders make arrangements among themselves, these shall be binding unless forbidden by public writings" (~ia p1 1t7os n Op ,TOpE S '1 ipcwv OpyE jyES ' s qYPT7)tL -q JaV'aL, TOt q! 0a6oT40L i OLtaawrTat q brl XElav oi0x6lTAvot TT Ois TCyropJLav, 5 Tt, av O arv' taO^C)vl-TaL nrpos ,XXlXovs, K'pLO LaL E P ' '7raypL 6oLa ypAaa7a).5 5 The Mss. readings (} l p&amp;wv 6p'ywv - va7"atc, F.

Seleukos, as we have seen, brings rrepL 7pwas into close connection with 6pyJE&amp;vEs. I therefore propose the emendation incorporated in my text. It simply regards lep&amp;v as a corruption of 'pxowv and in other respects follows Wilamowitz. In fact the native Attic orgeones were preponderantly, if not exclusively, 'ipLwv 6pyeveEs. Poland's distinction (212) between Heroen im engerem Sinne - vergBtterte Sterbliche - and die schlichte G6tter of orgeonic cult, though correct in substance, would mislead if it withheld from die schlichte G6tter the name heroes. Our oldest orgeonic record concerns a cult of "the hero and the Heroines" (no. (1) below, p. 73). Nock would like to insert " OE&amp;v after p&amp;Wxwv.

The second reaches us without any precise attribution. It was quoted by Philochoros in the fourth book of his Atthis (Frg. 94; cf. Suidas, s.v. or- geones and Harpocration, s.v. gennetai) and runs as follows: "Regarding orgeones Philochoros also wrote: the phratries shall of necessity admit both orgeones and homogalaktes whom (Philochoros explains) we call gennetai" (rpl Uri 7rv 6p'ya~~wv ygypagCE Kal qDXXopos' robs 5E 4par6pas 7raa7yKES &amp;~XEGOaL Ka~ rovs 6p-YEWvas Kal 7 oos 6oya&amp;XaKras, oiis 'yEl'l'TaS KaXOUEYV). The historical value of the first law depends in some degree upon whether it derives from the code of 594 B.C. or from the code of 409-01 B.c., which, despite revisions, was still referred to as Solonian (cf. Demosth. XXIV 149). It can also be thought that the commentary on the axones of Solon pub- lished by the Alexandrian grammarian Seleukos (above) dealt with the code of the fourth century. As we may judge from the decree of Teisamenos (Andoc. De Myst. 83), interpreted in the light of the new fragments of the stelai of the Royal Stoa on which the code of 409-01 B.c. was cut, the revision of the old code, already pretty well completed and inscribed, was said in 403 B.c. to contain "the laws of Solon and the thesmoi of Draco" (Andoc. I 82-83; see J. Oliver, Hesperia, IV 5 ff., Ferguson, Classical Studies presented to Edward Capps, 144 ff. and S. Dow, Hesperia, X 31 ff.; also A. Koerte, Glotta, XXV, 1936, 134 ff.). While the evidence is indirect, we are 6p'yiwov i vavTra from its position in the Mss. to a position after Otaa&amp;ra&amp;, is rightly rejected by Guarducci (Riv. di Fil. 1935, 333): it makes Otaaw&amp;ra comprehend Ouaaxorac, 6py E&amp;ves, and YEvvPiTraL, if it does not omit yeyvijraL altogether. Her own suggestion is LEp&amp;v bpytov (av)v(0)bra&amp;, which is a trifle closer to the Mss. than Mommsen's Obrat, but is open to the same objections. P. J. T. Endenburg (Koinoonia en Gemeenschap van Zaken bij de Grieken in den klassieken Tijd, Utrecht Diss. 1937, 163 ff.) suggests KOLvoWol in place of Mommsen's Obrat, but this does not help; and, in general, his idea that the various KOLVWviCaL cited by Aristotle in his Ethics (Nicomachean, 1160a 14 ff., Eudemian, 1241b 24) are simply the Solonian associations differently named, is too far-fetched. TLPvs is commonly inserted in the text after &amp;aOlovrac; but a partitive genitive as subject is so common in Greek that I believe, with Adolf Wilhelm, Oester. Jahresh. XIV, 211; cf. Busolt, Griech. Staatskunde, 1 192, n. 4, that it may be un- derstood without being present. I take it that the statute envisaged two sets of recipro- cal arrangements, one of two or more of the groups, and another of the members of a single group.</page><page sequence="10">66 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW justified by it in believing that the revision of 409-404 B.c. estab- lished a substantial part of the code in the Royal Stoa which was basic during the fourth century, and was not radical in substance. Archaic terms and provisions were preserved even though they had become wholly or substantially obsolete (cf. Lysias, X 15-20; Demos. XXIII 33 ff.). It will be remem- bered that Aristotle (Ath. Pol. 8, 3) was able to quote laws of Solon which at his time were no longer used. Apart from verbal changes the revision may have consisted mainly of ad- ditions like those made in 403/01 B.c. (cf. Class. Studies Capps, 146 f.). Since the code of 409/01 B.C., which contained ref- erences to axones, and doubtless also to kyrbeis,6 was readily accessible in the Royal Stoa, even if it was this, rather than Solon's original, which Seleukos discussed, and from which the law in the Digest was derived, we may readily believe that the law bestowing rights of contract on private associations belongs to the legislation of 594 B.C. Revisions of the classical period could not conceivably be responsible for phrases like iwri Xdac or E1s 43roplav oLXgUEvotL. Piracy would certainly not be recognized by a statute originating in fourth century Athens (cf. K. Latte, Gnomon, 1927, 39), and the obvious word for traders would then be 6u/ropot. It may, however, be granted to Wilamowitz (Ant. v. Karystos, 278) that the final phrase of the law is not verbally authentic. The first word of the law, demos, should, I believe, be translated as "village," not deme (Arist. Poetics, III, 3; Ath. Pol. XVI 5). It is incredible that the villages of Attica lacked a local organization of some sort before they were engrossed as demes of the state in the Kleis- thenian system. The Solonian thiasotai were, I take it, mem- bers of thiasoi like those of Dionysos and Herakles discussed in note 12 and Appendix 2. They cannot be members of the sub- divisions of the phratries since these derived whatever rights they possessed from the phratries, whose name follows demos in Solon's list of licensed associations. Moreover, we have to take account of the probability that the internal organization of the phratries in thiasoi is post-Solonian (cf. below, nn. 37, 6 In 363/62 B.C. a provision of the fourth century code is said to be 'K Kipf3mv (cf. Ferguson, Hesperia, VII, 5, 87; L. Holland, AJA 1941, 346ff.).</page><page sequence="11">THE ATTIC ORGEONES 67 48). The thiasoi which are included in the comprehensive enu- meration of deipna given in Athenaeus (V 186a) are conceivably feasts of the associations to which Solon's thiasotai belonged. The banquets of the phratries and the orgeones are listed separately. The later thiasotai (Poland, 20 ff.) were preponderantly aliens, not citizens, and may not have possessed as a class rights of association before the invalidation in 306 B.c. of the law of Sophokles of Sunion which sought to outlaw the Peripatetics. (Wilamowitz, 266 ff.; Ferguson, Hell. Ath., 104 ff.; Bury, The Hellenistic Age, 6 f.). Poland's statement (20), "Die meisten in Frage kommenden Thiasoteninschriften fallen in die kurze Spanne Zeit von 302 bis 278/7," when checked by new finds and dates, appears to be substantially correct, and, if my sur- mise is accepted, it becomes increasingly significant. In earlier times such associations could have acquired a hieron only by a special vote of the Athenian state, as is shown by the steps which had to be taken with this end in view by the Thracians (IG II2 1283), the Egyptians, and the Kitieis (IG II2 337, 333/32 B.c.) in establishing the cults of Bendis, Isis, and Aphrodite in Athens (cf. Plato, Laws, X 909 D). It is to the point to note that the thiasotai of aliens whose records fall in the period defined by Poland either had (IG II2 1261, 1263, 1971, 1273, 1277, 1278), or may have had, hiera of their own. There is no suggestion anywhere that they had had to obtain a special vote of the Athenian people in order to acquire them. Obviously the law of Solon applied to associations of citizens alone. Its bearing on the question at issue in 306 B.C. was con- sequently only indirect. We can accordingly identify three types of Attic thiasotai, all distinct from the orgeones, the first two old, the third rela- tively late: (1) thiasotai of Dionysos and Herakles - the thiasotai of the Solonian law. The groups are called Olaao-, or, perhaps, on occasion less specifically KOLVa. They may, I think, have been at times improvisations; (2) thiasotai of Zeus Phra- trios or of Zeus Phratrios and Athena Phratria. The groups are called liaaoL, and they are subdivisions of the phratries and probably Kleisthenian in origin; (3) thiasotai of cults, for the</page><page sequence="12">68 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW most part, though not exclusively (IG II2 1998, 1997), foreign. The groups are commonly, though not exclusively (61aoos oc- casionally appears, IG II2 1275, 1997, 4985), called simply KOLPa. They arose in the course of the fourth century B.C. and for the most part after 306 B.c. They consist ordinarily of aliens, males alone or males and females combined, with only an oc- casional citizen (IG II2 2859, 965/64 B.C.?, cf. Dow, Hesperia, XII 169) in association with them before 200 B.C. (Hell. Ath. 219 n. 5; Dow, HTR, 1937, 197). In the schools of philosophy, the members of which were thiasotai in fact, if not in name (below, p. 126), citizens and aliens mingled from their founding. Orgeones undoubtedly existed before the time of Solon.7 After his legislation they had a large measure of autonomy and hence each group of them might and undoubtedly did alter its constitution as circumstances required. Two or more such groups might, for example, unite and sacrifice in common, and a single group might add to its original hero other recipients of this cult. Offices might be added or dropped. Associations might open their ranks to others than descendants ('KPoVOL). The orgeones had full control not only of their shrines with their appurtenances, but also of their capital funds, so full that they could consider alienating their possessions (KTti7aTa) al- together or in significant part (No. (6)). The date at which the second law was enacted is a subject of controversy. The text itself is evidence that, whatever date is assigned to it, the orgeones were then a considerable part of the civic society; it also suggests that in this part were included people who ranked next to the gennetai. The law was men- tioned by Philochoros in his account of the events of the out- going fifth century; but it cannot have been enacted thus late because at that time Thracians had been permitted to associate themselves as orgeones of Bendis, yet as aliens they were de- barred from being phrateres.8 Busolt (Griech. Gesch.2 II, 116, Excavations conducted on the west slope of the Akropolis in the shrine be- longing prior to 420/19 to the orgeones of Amynos (see below, p. 87) have shown that the precinct was in use in Pisistratid and pre-Pisistratid times (A. Koerte, Ath. Mitt. XVIII, 1893, 231 ff., XXI, 1896, 288 f., 308 f.); cf. below, Appendix 1. 8 In view of the many incidents of the period 412-403 B.c. which may have prompted Philochoros to cite the law it is perhaps foolish to fix upon one; but</page><page sequence="13">THE ATTIC ORGEONES 69 n. 4; cf. Griech. Staatskunde, I 252 and n. 2), Meyer (Gesch. d. Alt.' II, 803) and others enter it in their account of the Kleis- thenian legislation, though Busolt concedes that it may have been earlier and De Sanctis (Storia dei Greci, I 481) and Nilsson (A.J.P. LIX 1938, 385) claim it for Solon. I am inclined to agree with them, but I do not think that Aristotle, Ath. Pol. 21, 6, proves the point, as Nilsson affirms. What Aristotle says is that Kleisthenes "allowed all to retain their phratries, etc."; he does not exclude the admission to old phratries, or to new, of men who had not belonged to phratries theretofore (cf. below, n. 48). The law quoted by Philochoros put compulsion on the phratries to admit orgeones as well as gennetai. Such a law is intelligible in Solon's period - one of transition from an aristocracy of birth to a timocracy, not at a time when the social problem was the integration of the lowest rank of citizens with the rest. Consequently, the case for not attributing the statute to Kleisthenes rests on the determination of the level of society in which the orgeones belonged. What influences me in pushing it back to Solon is the conception I have formed that they belonged rather to the middle than to the lower classes (see Synopsis, III A 16). In other words, they could not have remained as a mass aphratores till 507 B.c.: in fact, the laws of Draco, as they appeared in the axones of Solon, took it for granted that an Athenian had phrateres (IG 12 115; cf. below, pp. 105 f.). There is only one way of dating the law as late as Kleisthenes. That is to assume that the phratries had enrolled orgeones freely prior to its enactment without being required by statute to do so, and that the point of the law lay in the compulsion it applied. I find it difficult, however, to follow this way, because, if Kleisthenes, who "took the demos into partnership" (Her. V 66; Arist. Ath. Pol. 20), had been the legislator, he would have made the compulsory admission to phratries applicable to citizen-elements lower down in society than the orgeones. the decision made when the Thracians were authorized to become orgeones with- out becoming phrateres, involving, as it did, a definite alteration or infraction of the Solonian law, created an incident which an Atthidograph might be expected to discuss. In such a discussion he could hardly fail to quote the pertinent section of the code.</page><page sequence="14">70 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW It should be observed that the law quoted by Philochoros required the phrateres to admit both orgeones and gennetai, not gene and associations of orgeones. In the fourth century there were doubtless orgeones and gennetai in every phratry, but irrespective of their membership in these outside associa- tions, phrateres were divided for phratry purposes in groups of their own called thiasoi. The evidence for this conclusion does not need restatement.' That orgeones as a group did not form a constituent unit of a phratry is made abundantly clear by Isaeus, II 14: "After my adoption he introduced me to his phrateres in the presence of my opponents and he registered me on the roll of his deme and on that of his orgeones" (rot- oa7uoEovo E aa-yat g 7- E ogS OpaS 6pag 7WlapoPTWP TOvTW, Kal ES 1oJS JoC9al IE ''yp tE KaL 6E~ TobVs 6p-ysvars).

The same line of argument, applied to Isaeus, VII 13, and [Demos.], LIX 59, shows that the gene were not sub- divisions of the phratries.12 9 Wilamowitz, Aristoteles und Athen, II 0260ff.; Ferguson, Class.

Wyse, I.c. and Bruck, Totenteil und Seelgeriit, 9240. It has been assumed by Bruck and Guarducci (Riv. di Fil. .ce.) that the two gene and two thiasoi of IG I 20723 (ca. 350 B.C.) were units of a single association because they advanced money on the security of the same piece of property. On the same basis, however, we should be forced to subordinate to a larger whole the Kekro- pidai, Lykomidai, and Phlyeis of IG I12 2670 - which is impossible. 12 A third passage in Isaeus (IX, 30) calls for a word of explanation.

Their general position after the reforms of Kleis- soldier" like Astyphilos was more apt to feel at ease with the latter than with the former. A KOLVbyV Ocaa-wrwv of Herakles (IG II2 2343, early fourth cent. B.C.) is known from an inscription cut on a trapeza. It consisted of 15 members and a priest of Herakles. This may be a group (or one of two or more groups) such as that to which Astyphilos was introduced. In all probability such groups were asso- ciated with many of the temples of Herakles in Attica (cf. e.g. Theophr. Char. XXVII 5). The scene of Aristophanes' Daitaleis was set in a temple of Herakles. "On y c1elbrait un festin, sans doute A la suite du sacrifice, puis des choeurs de danse. Le thiase d'Heraclks, cite par Is&amp;e, n'6tait peut-etre pas autre chose" (Foucart, Assoc. relig. 153). Suidas, s.v. AaLraXkeis says: baLrvybVres Kal Ocaaw'raL Kal avyrb-rat. Cf. Hesychius, s.v. Oaowves" oLKo, iv o4 s aVULrO7EVs eL7TrvoLat o Ola Oacoo. Cf. also Diod. IV 241, 6, and below, Appendix 2. Modern editors have taken exception to OtLAovs, and Sauppe, followed by Wyse (cf. 643), has replaced it with Omaa&amp;ras, others with Otaoo,. I think with Forster (Loeb Classics) that no change is required. It seems to me likely that Harpo- cration had a text which contained robs OLaoovs. He cites Isaeus specifically to show that the members of thiasoi (7- v Otdawv) were called thiasotai. He also cites Demos. XVIII 260 (cf. XIX 199). There OtLaovs appears and thence he draws the definition that a thiasos was 7i-6 8pot6erO iov XrkOos O~~ 7tLerX^ Kal "rt, pL Ocv. "a throng assembled to render worship and honor to gods." TEXET? is Demosthenic. If Ot, aovs in Isaeus is taken to imply, as it does in Demosthenes, an organized throng, Sauppe's objection (Ausgew. Schr. 788) falls to the ground. Olaoaos often means an association or club. Its plural in this sense would be a group of clubs, and it may be, as Ziehen (Leges sacrae, II 1 33 n.) maintains, that the plural is so used in IG II2 1177, 67riiws av cdsr - - Oth[ovs] ovvayet (oUvvayeu means to "found," cf. IG II2 1297, 1. 4; 1322, 1. 1); but in this awkwardly constructed sen- tence OL&amp;[aovs] occurs in a sequence of plurals and may mean simplly "a thiasos." In his speech against Phryne Euthias declared (Sauppe, Fr. Or. Gr. II 320): b rzcitQa i-rotvvv LVO daOePfl7 4plyV7V, KWh tacTYav avaL,,S, KatvoV OEOV E.TloY7p'7rptav, OtaLhovs &amp;v p&amp;v ekOC'Ei ovs Kal yvvaKwAv avvayacyovoav.

By following his lead we might justify robs Otldovs = "banquets" in Isaeus, but probably it is better, in so doing, to follow the lead of Harpokration and the example of Demosthenes. If Olaoov had stood in the text we should expect KOLVOv instead of KOLvCOias. The definition of thiasos given by Hesychios (xopoi abo-raaos; O8Laa7ra = Xop- EVTral) may reflect uses of the word in the Athenian poets, Euripides (Bacch. 680), and Aristophanes (Frogs 156), quoted by Poland, 16ff. where Ot6aovs may be translated "bands." Thiasoi = "throng of banqueters" are as intelligible in the cult of Herakles as thiasoi = "throng of bacchanals" in the cult of Dionysos. P. Roussel (Isae, Discours, 171, n. 1) puts the matter tersely when he says: " Ce dieu, grand buveur et grand mangeur, 6tait le patron d6sign6 de societes dont l'existence se manifestait sans doute surtout par des banquets." The text quoted from Isaios shows that the members of these thiasoi were called thiasotai.</page><page sequence="16">72 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW thenes seems to have been like that of the old Attic phylae and trittyes (Class. Stud. Capps, 151 ff.), and the phratries and gene. They continued to exist, tolerated and undisturbed.'3 Aristotle (Eudemian Ethics, 1241b, 25) affirms, for what it is worth, that orgeones and phrateres were alike parts of the polis. It is to be noticed, however, that while the polis made use of the old phylae, trittyes and gene to have certain state services performed, and that while it called on phrateres to participate in certain procedures connected with cases of homi- cide (IG I2 115, cf. R. Bonner and G. Smith, The Administra- tion of Justice from Homer to Aristotle, II 208 f.), and required them to enroll aliens upon whom it conferred citizenship, we have record of its having put demands of this sort upon orgeones only in the case of the orgeones of Bendis (see below, p. 103).14 This association, however, was exceptional in that it was au- thorized as well as controlled by the state. The lexicographers generally define the orgeones as privately organized and sup- ported. It seems clear that, while the state recognized the genus, it left it to its citizens individually to plant and culti- vate the species. Orgeones thus differ from phylae and phra- tries, gene and trittyes in that these could be created by the state alone - a point of public law which is not affected by the facts that one genos is known to have become two by fission (Hesperia, VII 19) and two phratries seem to have become one by coalescence (IG II2 1241). The view that there were two kinds of orgeones, one public and the other private, results from a misunderstanding (cf. notes 9 and 11). While it is true that the orgeones both before and after Kleisthenes were left to their own devices it is also true that their vitality was not sapped by the creation in 507 B.C. of parallel organizations integrated with the new Kleisthenian state system. Membership in orgeones was hereditary, as it was in the demes and the gen8 and the phratries. What entitled a man to membership was descent from a member. In the case presented 13 See below, p. 105 f. 14 The vooOkTrat who are said by Athenaeus (V, 185 c, ef. n. 19) to have ordained "the so-called" orgeonic feasts are to be taken as "law givers" in general - the ebperal of legislation. The passage gives no warrant for supposing that the code of Solon (Athens) required the orgeones to give "feasts."</page><page sequence="17">THE ATTIC ORGEONES 73 by Isaeus (II 14) an adopted son was entered by his legal father on the roll of his association. The orgeones affected by the law quoted by Philochoros were potential phrateres, hence Athe- naioi. Once this law was put into effect its work was done, and associations of orgeones constituted after the date of its enactment would have to be reserved to Athenaioi (see above, p. 68 and below, p. 106) both because of the existence of the law itself and because it is incredible that groups of aliens could acquire citizenship - a jealously guarded privilege - by form- ing associations of which the members called themselves orgeones. III. A third group of sources relating to the orgeones con- sists of records of their proceedings inscribed on stone on their own order, or on their own behalf (No. 5). The information they yield is, accordingly, direct and authentic. They emanate from at least a dozen different associations and are spread thin over a long period of time - from ca. 450 B.C. to ca. 70 B.c., with the majority lying between 340 and 170 B.c. These associations fall into two classes: A. orgeones of whom the characteristic feature is the cult of heroes or heroines or both, and B. those of whom the characteristic feature is the cult of higher deities, mostly of foreign origin. CLASS A (1) At the head of the records of Class A we place the new inscription from the Areopagus. This was cut on stone early in the third century B.C., and it was then that the decree of the orgeones which ordered the anagraphe was enacted. The order, however, required the inclusion in the anagraphe of the decrees of the orgeones which came down from ancient times, and the first of these is preserved almost intact on the stone. It runs as follows: "Decreed by the orgeones: the Host (hestia- tor) shall offer the sacrifice on the 17th and 18th of Hekatom- baion. On the first day he shall sacrifice a suckling pig to the Heroines and a full-grown victim to the Hero and he shall set up a table, and on the second day, a full-grown victim to the</page><page sequence="18">74 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Hero.15 He shall reckon up his expenses and spend no more than the revenue. [He shall distribute] the flesh as follows,'6 to the orgeones present (a portion), to sons a portion not exceeding a 15 In the ancient decree he is nameless. In the early third century he is Echelos. The chances are that if he had had a name at the time of the ancient decree he would have got it in a text of this sort. Echelos, paired with lasile and associated with other heroes, heroines and higher deities (IG II2 4545-4548) had a cult in Echelidai near Phaleron; and the most probable explanation of his appearance in a text cut on a stele found on the Areopagus is that the koinon of orgeones of the Hero consisted of people who lived in Echelidai near the Hippodrome (cf. Milch- h6fer, PW V, 1911; Walter, Eph. Arch. 1937, 97ff.; Ferguson, Hesperia, 1938, 25 f.; Meritt, Hesperia, 1942, 284 ff.), and assembled for joint sacrifices with the orgeones of the Heroines in a hieron which belonged primarily to the latter and was situated in the asty near the locale of Kalliphanes. 16 Beginning at this point the text translated runs as follows: [lv iqu] at rd Kpfa o7S {oL itOtpe w rome brapono- .

The only restoration which calls for comment is the conditional clause [4av p fl]o.s) in line l0. Meritt fil's this lacuna with [tiEr' air]obS, which must mean that, after the orgeones and the sons received their portions, the appor- tionment to the women began. The position of [fer' abe]owbS seems to me difficult: we should expect it before ra t yvvahti. A further difficulty is that the stone has not room at the beginning of line 20 for six letters after 6p-ercvdov and before 0, one of which is mu and none an iota. The excess is at least one letter and prob- ably more (see Dow, Appendix 3, below, p. 135). The restoration suggested by me (4r spaces) fits nicely. In any case [ tr' aiur]obS is otiose since the order of listing the recipients of portions is ordinarily the order of apportioning, cf. F. Puttkammer, Quo modo Graeci victimarum carnes distribuerint, p. 58; and even though the substitution of 6p-ywv for iptyc'voOv (below, p. 82), against which the form 6pY4o0L weighs heavily, would make [t6r' a'r]ovs epigraphically possible, it should, I think, be rejected. Otherwise the "ancient decree" does not contain a single redundant word. The restoration [O.v 74jL fl]o3s makes the distributions of meat to the womenfolk contingent on the size of "the full-grown animal" sacrificed to the Hero. (For 7aXaOTvj's = "suckling" contrasted with rEX&amp;Mo = "full-grown" rather than "per- fect" - all victims had to be perfect - see IG II2 1361; Ziehen, Leges Sacrae II 1, 41, p. 117 n.; cf. Ditt. Syll. 6012, 31 = 10153 and 6152, 35 = 10243: TfOELov Kal 6EKa [&amp;ap]uis]. If a definite animal had been required it would have been named. How wide a latitude in the choice of sacrificial animals was permissible may be seen from Ziehen, no. 119). If a sheep or a goat were the utmost that the funds at the disposal of the Host allowed him to purchase without exceeding the revenue, the yield of flesh would, it is assumed with my restoration, have sufficed to provide portions for the orgeones and their sons alone. There would have been nothing for the women. A contingency of sacrifice of this sort accords with Attic and Greek usage.

The Greek for "half share" would, however, be 7rT' aapEav or Tr i~AoU. Cf. Athen. IV 143 c, e, from which we learn that the juniors, i.e. sons, received half portions at the Cretan public mess.

If it meant as Meritt (287) assumes, one maid-servant and only one, her portion would have been defined precisely, sipce she would have to be a definite person attached to the orgeones as a whole. Tvy els n 'Ieav implies a plurality of receiv- ers. It seems to me doubtful whether ?XebOEpae would have been used if there were only one aKbXOUvOS. "8 Meritt writes (287, n. 28): "The primary meaning of yXEvO6pats here in line 20 seems to be 'independent'; the dative form depends on laaiav." He takes Trats AevO&amp;paL~ to be "women who were orgeones of their own right" as distinct from "the wives of the male orgeones." It seems, however, perfectly clear that only adult males were orgeones. I take yvvat(i to mean, not wives, but the women (of the orgeones) generally as, for example, in Plato, Phaed., 116B, 117D; Ditt. Syll.2 552, 46 = Syll.8 695; 589, 45 = Syll.3 1004 (cf. Aristoph. Peace, 969.ff.). They get Kp&amp;a only when the animal sacrificed is an ox. The portions are then specified for the several classes of women, al XEVbOEpaL, al Ovyaripes, and al &amp;K6XovOo0. Ex- cluding the second and third classes, at XEbOrepat comprise the wives, widows, and spinsters (possibly aunts and married daughters) of the orgeonic families. The choice of AXEibpac as the designation of this class was probably prescribed by the wish to distinguish it from the &amp;KbXovOoL, who were commonly, though not always, slaves (Westermann, PWK Suppl.

[He shall deliver] the portion of the woman to the man (i.e., husband, guardian, master)." The decree is designated as "ancient" (pxaZov), and it has the crisp style, with parataxis, characteristic of the middle fifth century B.C. It also uses the word ioaaos, which, apart from one appearance 19 in the Laws of the Milesian Molpoi (Ditt. Syll.3 57, 10) dated in 450/49 B.c., is, according to Liddell- Scott-Jones, a late poetical form of t'los. It seems to have been in usage in the middle of the fifth century B.C. in texts deal- ing with the distribution of sacrificial meats. In our third century B.C. context it was undoubtedly an archaism. The ancient decree is unquestionably the oldest official record of orgeones to come into our possession. From the ordinance of the early third century in which the publication of "the ancient decrees" was ordered we learn that the orgeones consisted of two distinct associations (KoPa') - one of the hero Echelos, the more important of the two ob- viously, and the other of the Heroines "whose locale was near the property of Kalliphanes." 20 Their union for purposes of common sacrifices ([rwV OvBUtS 1P KowpcW]a, cf. below, p. 156 and n. 56) was of long standing,21 and measures were taken in the FGH II B 115, 143); and in Menander (Frg. 546, Kock) ,XeuOvpg yvyaLKL may be translated with propriety "lady"; cf.

The name ebfyeveZt was not available since it was appropriate primarily for the womenfolk of gennetai (cf. Roussel, Melanges Bidez, 819ff.; Hesperia, 1938, 51ff.).

Otherwise, why did the ancient decrees have such authority?</page><page sequence="21">THE ATTIC ORGEONES 77 early third century to insure that it endure "for all time." The mover of this decree, Lysias, son of Periandros, of Plotheia, was an Athenian citizen - a member of a known family.22 What do we learn from the "ancient decree" itself? The orgeones consist of the adult males. They alone participate in the decree-making body and they are the principals in the sacrifice. Their sons as the orgeones-to-be shared in the sacrificial feast on all occasions, but their portions of the flesh of the vic- tims were half, or, according to their age, less than half of the portions given to their seniors. Two full-grown victims were sacrificed to the Hero on consecutive days in July of every year; but it was contemplated that the funds at the disposal of the association might not suffice to purchase an ox, but only a less expensive animal like a sheep or a goat, for either or even both days of sacrifice. When there was no ox there was no meat for the womenfolk of the orgeones; when there was, the adult females of citizen status received share and share alike with the orgeones while their daughters and maidservants were given portions on the same basis as their sons. The chances are, I think, that the women stayed at home on the day or days when there was no ox unless their greater piety, or desire for company, and the encouragement maybe of a basket led them to be present anyway.23 A case is reported by Pausanias (VIII 48, 5) in which the women monopolized the flesh of a victim and denied a share to the men. The size of the portions depended upon the amount of meat available and the number of participants, and consequently was incapable of advance definition. Naturally it could not be made so small as to satisfy nobody. We have it on record 22 His deme, Plotheia, was one of the inland demes of Aigeis, located by Milch- hoefer (P. W. II, 9203) north of Pentelikon near Ikaria. Of course he need not have lived in his deme. 23 Isocrates (VII 99) affirms by clear implication that a heorte possessed su- perior attractiveness when it was accompanied by a hestiasis. The reunions of the orgeones of Echelos and the Heroines followed immediately after the national trieteric fete of the Synoikia which was celebrated on Hekatombaion 16th on the Akropolis (Class. Stud. Capps, 155). On the same day, beginning perhaps in 374 B.c., an annual sacrifice of something like 200 animals was made to Eirene (IG II2 1496, lines 94, 197). The orgeones (men only) of Echelos who came to the asty for these fetes may have stayed over-night, for their own fete, in the temenos, which probably had at least one dwelling house.</page><page sequence="22">78 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW that the flesh of one good ox sufficed to provide portions for the fifty prytaneis, the nine archons, the (ten) hieropoioi, and an undefined number of pompeis (IG II2 47, 35 ff., ca. 350 B.c.). Absent orgeones received nothing and the same was doubtless true of absent sons and womenfolk. The provision that the women's portions should be delivered to the men was probably designed to aid the Host in distributing the meat among those present. The Host was obviously one of the orgeones, and his post an assignment which rotated among them in some settled order. The objects of worship are specifically a hero and heroines, yet in making the sacrifices the orgeones violate every pro- vision of the ritual normal in the cult of the dead (below, p. 165). On the stele on which the "ancient decree" was inscribed, in the lost lower portion, the names of the debtors of the associa- tion together with the amount of capital owed and the accrued interest were posted. Had this account been preserved we should probably be able to make some inferences as to the funds of the association, their investment, and the annual yield in interest (rd imtbYE6j6 a, line 24). As it is, we know nothing about its finances, except the fact that they were in such a state as to require a permanent record of the association's invest- ments to be made and published. A definite basis for a fresh start was thus laid. Assuming, as we may, that one ox, one sheep and one suckling pig were normally sacrificed each year the income cannot have been less than 90 drachmas. The group of families was probably small.24 Only one table was set up.25 A cautious inference as to their social position is permissi- ble from the provision that one female attendant 26 per matron was allowed to receive meat. The presumption that each 24 The orgeones of Egretes numbered from 12 to 30, those of Asklepios from Prospalta 16, and those of Dionysos 15.

Even the mean-spirited man (Theophr. Char. XXII 10), who denied his wife a maid notwithstanding that she had brought him a dowry, hired a slave girl so that she should not be unaccompanied when she appeared in public processions. The proprieties were important for people who could afford them. The denial of meat to more than one at- tendant implies that there were families in the group which had the means to come to the reunion with two or more maid- servants. The possession by the orgeones of female slave at- tendants is conclusive evidence that they did not belong to the class of the "poor" (&amp;5ropot). The poor had to use their wives and daughters to perform the services for which the well-to-do employed female slaves, because, says Aristotle, "they had no slaves" (5&amp;d rnvy abovXlav, Arist. Pol. IV 15, 13, p. 1300a; VI 8, .3, p. 1323a. Cf. Ferguson, Hell. Ath. 85, Newman, The Politics of Aristotle, IV 567 f., and Westermann, Harv. Stud. Class. Phil. Suppl. Vol. I, 1940, 468 f.). The associated orgeones of the Heroines and Echelos had a sacred precinct with an altar (lines 6 f.) in which the sacrifices were made and the reunions of the orgeones were held. Con- sequently sacrifices were accepted by either Echelos or the Heroines, or both, in a hieron to which he or they were not indigenous (cf. n. 15). This association was a bicellular organ- ism like the genos of the Salaminioi. In the case discussed under no. (6) the split of the orgeones was probably based simply on a disagreement as to policy, since the cult was cen- tered in a single "Goddess." In general the orgeones seem to have been isolated unicellular groups. The two associations of orgeones of Bendis were independent of each other and united only to participate jointly in the spectacular part of the Bendi- deia. The orgeones of the Mother of the Gods (no. 14) were obviously sui generis. (2) The text from the Areopagus did not call for a descrip- tion of the sacred precinct and we have no further information</page><page sequence="24">80 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW about it. We may, however, form a picture of a sacred precinct of orgeones by drawing on a record of another old Attic associa- tion of this type. We have in our possession a lease, executed in 306/05 B.c. by the orgeones of the hero Egretes (IG II2 2499). The stone from which it comes was found in Athens at the foot of the Hill of the Nymphs. These orgeones let their sacred precinct for ten years to a certain Diognetos, son of Arkesilos, of Melite. The terms of the lease are informative as to the nature and equipment of the property. The rental was 200 drachmas per year, payable to the treasurer in two equal semi- annual installments. There were buildings and fruit trees - probably olive trees- in the precinct, the buildings being roofless and doorless. During the period of the lease the pre- cinct remained a precinct, available for unimpeded use by the orgeones for their sacred purposes. The tenant had the obli- gation of keeping the walls stuccoed and otherwise repaired, of caring for the trees and replacing any that died; but he was permitted to add and, on the expiring of the lease, remove roof and doors. The orgeones met for their annual sacrifices to Egretes in the month of Boedromion (September) and on this occasion Diognetos had to put at their disposal with the doors open the dwelling house in which was the cella (called a hieron, not a heroon), the roasting place or kitchen, an improvised shed or shelter (cf. Ditt. Syll.2 II 937, n., 4 and 13 = Syll.3 III 1097, n. 3 and 11; Ziehen, Leges Sacrae II 1, 79 n.), dining couches and tables large enough for two triclinia, i.e., for 12-30 persons.27 27 Tphre7Ea means ordinarily in ritualistic records the mensa sacra on which were placed the offerings intended for the gods (cf. Aristoph. Plutus, 676 ff.); but in IG II2 1358 it means the mensa domestica on which, according to Ziehen, the portions assigned to the priests were placed. Here 7rpI&amp;reaLt must also mean mensae domesticae, but the viands placed on them must be those which the orgeones ate (cf. Ziehen, 123 f., n. 5). Els bo TplKXtwa is, I take it, a definition of capacity. If the couches and tables were part of the permanent equipment of the shrine, KXivas Kal 7rpa7ICas would have been preceded by the article and their capacity would not have needed to be a matter of contractual arrangement.

It is commonly stated that the Greeks ordinarily reclined two on a kline, but Professor G. H. Chase informs me that "a series of vases of the late fifth century style certainly shows anywhere from two to five. There is a fairly good series published in E. M. W. Tillyard, The Hope Vases.

IG I2 94). In this record of the orgeones of Egretes is made explicit what is implicit in the "ancient" decree of the orgeones of Echelos and the Heroines - that the flesh of the sacrificial animals was not only divided, but roasted and consumed on the spot. Absentees, whether male or female, might enjoy the spiritual benefits of the sacrifice, but not the material; and their enjoyment of the intangible benefits was contingent on these being vouchsafed to those who did not partake of the sacrificial meats. Doubtless here, as in civic and other cultus generally, all that mattered was the performance of the rite. Again we have evidence for the observance of decorum, of orderly feast- ing, of shelter from the sun or rain, and of economic well-being. (3) We have another orgeonic record, in which orgeones of the "god" Hypodektes leased their shrine to a citizen and his descendants for all time with a rental of 50 drachmas per annum (IG II2 2501, end of fourth cent. B.C.). The stone bearing the lease was found in "the western part of the city of Athens." The lessees in this case had not only to keep the premises (temenos, hieron, oikia), stipulated to remain a hieron, open on the occasion of the annual reunion of the orgeones (14th of Boedromion, the day on which the hiera were brought from Eleusis as a preliminary to the Eleusinian Mysteries which ran from the 15th to the 23rd), but they had also to have the shrine garlanded at daybreak on the day of the fete and the cult image oiled and unveiled.28 What is obvious in the case of the bein, Collection of Engravings from Ancient Vases now in the Possession of Sir William Hamilton, III pl. 10) shows three men on a couch with a woman sitting on the end of it; Hope 165 (= Tischbein, II pl. 55) shows four; and Hope 154 (which is not published) is described as having five men on the couch" (cf. Cic. In Pis. 67). R. Zahn in Buschor, Furtwiingler-Reichhold, Griech. Vasenmalerei, Series 3, p. 192, Abb. 96, has three persons on a couch. The number per kline was probably less the more the occasion was formal or sumptuous (cf. Macrobius, Saturnalia, III 13, 11). The mensae sacrae were "grosse altarftirmige massive Basen" (Stengel, Opferbriiuche, 208, n. 1). It is to be noted that it was on the side of a rpoarea of this description that No. (10) (below, p. 93) was cut. 28 Instead of (KaO') "uipa[v] in line 8 something else should be restored. The</page><page sequence="26">82 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW orgeones of Echelos and the Heroines is explicitly disclosed in this instance - they had archives of their own in which they kept their records. Hypodektes is named 6 0Ebs in line 22 of the inscription (cf. also 11. 8 f.). Koehler (IG I1 1061) classifies him as "a god or hero." He was obviously one of the deities "in a small way" who, like the Hero latros in IG II2 839 11. 33, 45 and 840 11. 6, 14, is given the honorific appellation E6bs (cf. Poland, 212 f., and below, pp. 85, 163 ff.). (4) An orgeonic decree of ca. 300 B.C. is published by Meritt in Hesperia X (1941), 56 f. It was enacted on the motion of a certain Mnesigeiton and conferred honors on a certain Mnesarchos. Meritt's remark, "The formulae imply that Mnesarchos probably was not an Athenian, for his goodwill toward the Athenian demos holds a prominent place in the motivating clauses of the decree," seems to me to lack cogency. The attitude of citizen-members to the Athenian demos is cited by phyletai (IG 112 1148, 1163) and demotai (IG I12 1194, 1201, 1214) as a consideration reenforcing services to themselves as a basis for grants of honors. It is in the records of civic groups like these rather than in those of alien thiasotai that parallels valid for orgeones are to be sought. In view of the interrelations of families characteristic of orgeones and best attested in IG II2 355 (cf. No. (8), p. 91 below) I venture to sug- gest that Mnesarchos was a relative of Mnesigeiton. The stone containing this decree is broken away at the bottom so that we do not know in what capacity Mnesarchos served the association. He may have been Host (hestia- tor). He was, I take it, a citizen of some distinction. The fragment does not mention the patron of the cult. iHence these orgeones may be identical with one or other of the associations included in our list, if the use by them of the shorter form of the name is not a decisive distinctive. The most remarkable novelty in this decree is that the association called itself a koinon [b]pyr4v [the dative plural may have been bpyErit, quite as well as bp-rE&amp;at, since the word is restored]. 'Opy'wv is the genitive plural of *p-ydrsz, an unattested variant of bpyEr&amp;v. Its genitive plural occurred, "in- stead of bpy-y&amp;vwv," according to Harpocration (s.v. 6bpy'wv), in a lost speech of Lysias (Frg. 112 ed. Sauppe). Moreover, it is found in the Eudemian Ethics of Aristotle (1241b, 25), where it has been substituted by J. Solomon (Oxford Translation, IX 2), properly as now appears, for the Mss. reading bp'ylwv, which is hardly tolerable. The passage runs as follows, "The other partnerships are [either] (retaining ~ which Solomon brackets) a part of the civic partnership, e.g. those of the phratries and priestly colleges, or pecuniary Arcadian peasant who, according to Delphi, excelled all others in piety wreathed and polished the images of Hermes and Hekate once a month (Theopompus, ap. Porphyr. De abst. II 16 = Jacoby, FGH II B 115, 344). The stone is lost. Ranga- be's transcript shows juEpat. Before ~O~pac he read only AAAI.

I have given Solomon's transla- tion, but I believe that "sacrificing associates" comes nearer to the meaning of p'pyowv than "priestly colleges." The writer of the Eudemian Ethics ob- viously thought of the orgeones as a civic institution and not of the type of free associations (Nock). It is possible that the genitive plural ppy'w o is also found in Aeschylus, frg. 144 (see below, Appendix 1). On the relation to each other of the two forms Professor Whatmough has very kindly given me the following note: "The evidence for the gen. pl. 6py'owv beside the nom. sg. bpypz&amp;v (gen. pl. bpyrozvv) is beyond question irrefragable. The question is: what is the relation of these forms to one another? The poetical 6pyELt&amp;V provides conclusive evidence; for the acc. pl. 6bpyEovas (so W. Schulze, Quaest. Epicae, 255, rightly, for bp-ytoas) at h. Ap. 389 indicates a stem bpY'7ov- (whence Attic pyyErwv-), and that in its turn indicates a stem 9pyTF-, nom. sg. *bpyEvs, gen. pl. bpywov." A precise analogy for *6pyEbs - Op-ye)V is roKEVS - TOKEWV, as Professor Werner Jaeger has pointed out to me. (5) Among the creditors of a fugitive condemned for sacrilege are listed in the accounts of the poletai for 367/66 B.c. (a) Kichonides, son of Diogeiton, of Gargettos and the koinon of 'phrateres Medontidai,' and (b) Aeschines of Melite and the koinon of orgeones. The latter had taken a mortgage on the delinquent's house for 24 drachmas. Miss Margaret Crosby, who has pub- lished these records (Hesperia, X (1941) 14 ff.), argues that the koinon of orgeones was a thiasos of the Medontidai since otherwise they would have been nameless and unidentifiable. I question the validity of this argument. The Attic orgeones have an irritating way of being anonymous. The deity they worshipped is titular for the orgeones in two instances only (Amynos, Asklepios, and Dexion, and Herakles at Kome in Lemnos). In all other cases, they are individualized only by matter entered, mostly incidentally, in the body of their records. Normally the orgeones are ol bpye^6vs simply. There is therefore no reason to associate the orgeones of the proceedings of the poletai with the phratry of the Medontidai. They are there designated with all reasonable precision by the name of the one of the group (Aeschines of Melite) who entered on their behalf the episkepsis which succeeded in sav- ing for them their investment. Aeschines was probably the chief of the orgeones for the year (hestiator), or he may have been an advocate (synego- ros; cf. IG II2 1183, 1258, and Mdlanges Glotz, 350 ff.) chosen by the orgeones to act for them in the judicial proceedings. Incidentally it is wholly by the name of a similar individual that the phrateres of IG 112 2723 are identified in this mortgage record. Regularly a single name sufficed in the decisive records to define who the eranistai were who loaned money on the security of real property (IG 112 2699, 2700, 2701, 2719). In the same way the orgeones of IG 112 1294 (below, No. (11)) were probably distinguished by the name of their head. We do not know to whom the shrine was consecrated in which the orgeones of 367/66 B.C. sacrificed and held their reunions. The hero or god is normally titular for the shrine. Naturally the poletai had no occasion to mention either it or him. In the circumstances we have no means of determining whether this decree belongs to one of the associations already known and listed in this article or to a new association.</page><page sequence="28">84 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW (6) There is yet another orgeonic record which after some hesitation I attribute to the same class as those thus far con- sidered. IG II2 1989 (early third century B.C.) was inscribed in letters carefully arranged stoichedon on a stone which is broken away at top and bottom. Yet enough is preserved to show that it contained a record of the proceedings of a trial before Athenian private arbitrators.29 The case arose out of a dispute between one group of the orgeones and another. The object of the cult is simply "the Goddess." The arbitra- tors decided that the property of the Goddess could not be disposed of by sale or hypothecation, and that its revenue must be used for the sacrifices which the priest was to offer to her with the participation of the orgeones. The fragmentary lines at the top of the stone indicate that both disputants had agreed under oath to accept the findings of the arbitrators (cf. Hesperia, VII, 47 ff.), but nonetheless "the Goddess," who is nameless, through the mouth of a certain Kallistratos, solemnly inter- dicted any orgeon (6[p]y[EC0a])30 from alienating any of her property or diverting any of her income from her sacrifices."3 Since the stone was found in Athens, at the church of St. Irene, and not in the Piraeus, it is most improbable that "the Goddess" was Bendis, or the Mother of the Gods, or Hagne Aphrodite, or any other deity localized in the harbor town. The interdict begins: 'ra'yopE~EtL 65 KacL t~0 E0s K[al .... . ..... KaXXi'orparos, KTX. If the goddess had had a name we should expect it to be given to her in a prohibition of this character. The alternative is that she was simply "the Goddess," as a hero is simply "the Hero" (cf. above, p. 74, n. 15). In Attica 7q bE6S might be Athena; but as Poland (175, 183) has pointed 29 Orgeones were defendants in a suit in which Isaeus wrote the speech (cited several times by Harpokration) for the plaintiff. The action "appears to have been concerned with the possession of a piece of land"; Forster in Loeb Classics, 456; Thalheim, Frg. 112-113. They also figured in some way or other in a process regarding an inheritance so as to be mentioned by Lysias in the speech which he wrote for one of the litigants (Harpokration s.v. 6py~c&amp;w). Perhaps they were called on to give evidence as to legitimacy of birth or adoption. 30 The only instance of the singular found in the inscriptions. 31 The submission of the case to arbitrators and the measures taken to insure execution of their findings suggest that it was thought possible to dispose of the property of an association of orgeones and thus, perhaps, disband the association itself.</page><page sequence="29">THE ATTIC ORGEONES 85 out, Athena (without a specifying epithet) was never the ob- ject of the cult of Attic private associations. Hence she is not to be thought of in this instance. The title of Kallistratos is lost, but, allowing one space for the article, it had precisely eight letters. Wilamowitz suggested rpo'7n#s and Kirchner has so restored the text in IG II2; but, however plausible this may seem at first glance, it does not meet the case - the issuance in the form of an order of the findings of a court. Moreover, we do not find a rpoo'ins on the staff of any association of orgeones. The only title with eight letters which is found in the orgeonic records is ?arderWp.32 Strictly the name Kallistratos is unneces- sary; but, since it was undoubtedly Kallistratos himself who formulated the interdict, it accords with Athenian practice for him to insert his own name in the text. Moreover, the pro- hibition envisaged a situation which was immediately acute. Kallistratos had to handle it. The insertion of the title hestiator sufficed to transfer the responsibility to his successors should the occasion arise. When, however, hestiator is restored in our text, IG II2 1989 takes its place in our Class A - and then Class A includes not only orgeones of heroes but also orgeones of "a Goddess." My initial hesitation to include it in this category sprang in part from the designation of the object of cult as "the Goddess" - a hesitation that is removed when "the Goddess" is regarded as simply a honorific synonym for "the Heroine" (cf. above p. 82 and below 162 ff.); it sprang also in part from the fact that these orgeones had a priest. Nowhere else is a priest associated with a Host in our official records.3" There is, indeed, an historical notice in the Vita of 32 Nock noticed that e'tyTrfi has the required number of letters. I think, however, that an exegetes had no place in this transaction. The content of the prohibition had just been formulated in an arbitral decision. There was nothing to expound. The Goddess appears in propria persona because she had been de- clared the owner of the property which the interdict was designed to protect. Once the priest is excluded - the name lepebs is too short for the space - the proper person to be associated with her in a prohibition addressed to the orgeones was the chief executive official of the association which administered her property. That was the hestiator. I do not think that we have to imagine, as in the case, for example, of the prostagmata of non-Greek deities, an epiphany of the Goddess in a dream or vision. She appears in the text simply as a property owner. 33 Poland (352), following Koerte (L.c., 297), wrongly identifies a public priest of Asklepios (IG 112 4457, second half of second century B.C.) as a priest of the</page><page sequence="30">86 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Sophocles, 11, which, as restored by Koerte (Ath. Mitt. XXI, 1896, 311; cf. Berl. Phil. Woch. 1925, 1412 f.),34 is to the effect that Sophocles held the priesthood, a lifelong priesthood seem- ingly, of the hero Amynos. Yet the orgeones of Amynos, Asklepios, and Dexion were, as we shall see, headed by two Hosts. There is a possibility that the priest of "the Goddess" was a life-long priest like Sophocles and Agathokles and Dionysios (below, No. (15)), and another that, like the treas- urer of No. (2), he was an orgeon designated annually to assist the hestiator. We have no evidence which enables us to choose between the two. (7) In another orgeonic record (IG II2 1259) dated in 313/1-0 B.C. - one of a group of three decrees (1252, after the middle of the fourth century B.C., 1253, same date, and 1259) of the orgeones of Amynos, Asklepios, and Dexion - two Hosts (histiatores) are mentioned. Like others connected with this association they were members of known families (Koerte, l.c., 307). Their functions are briefly described as "manage- ment of the association's affairs and sacrifices." Two other individuals (brothers) appear in 1252 as deserving praise for attending to the association's affairs. Their office is not given orgeones of Amynos, Asklepios, and Dexion; cf. Dinsmoor, Archons of Athens, 288. IG II2 4385 and 4424 (as well as 4457) record votive offerings to Amynos. 34 Despite the hesitation of v. Blumenthal (PWK 2te Reihe V 1044 f.) and Wilamowitz (Glaube der Hellenen, 1I 224 f.) and the refusal of E. Schmidt (Ath. Mitt. 1913 73 ff.) Fr. Pfister (Der Reliquienkult im Altertum, 121 n. 434) and Otto Kern (Rel. d. Hellenen, II314, n. 1) to accept Koerte's substitution of AMY N OY for the Mss. reading AAWN 0:, I think that the change is sustained by the weight of the facts and presents no real palaeographical difficulties. Sophocles is certainly connected with Amynos. It is most unlikely that he was simultaneously priest of another, potentially rival, Asklepian hero, of whom, moreover, there is no trace among the many ex-votos found in the Amyneion and the Asklepieion in Athens. In an unfamiliar proper name some copyist misread pv as Xo (an easy enough thing to do, cf. GGA 1903, 843), preserving a six letter word; and no later copyist knew enough to suspect an error.

As Koerte pointed out, among the mem- bers of this association were persons of considerable standing in the community (were not Sophocles, the great tragedian, general, and Hellenic Treasurer, and lophon, his distinguished son, of their number?), while the association itself did not lack funds: it voted two gold crowns on one occasion, each to cost 500 drachmas. There is no trace of any non-citizen in its records or in any of the orgeonic records thus far discussed. The orge- ones known to us were quite respectable Athenians, preponder- antly persons of the propertied classes. This association had two shrines, one of Amynos and Askle- pios, and one of Dexion (IG II2 1259). Its history is well known since Alfred Koerte in a brilliant article (Ath. Mitt. XXI 987 ff.) reconstructed it in 1896. The orgeones of the hero Amynos were an ancient association reaching back to the sixth century B.C. and beyond. They extended their cult to include Asklepios after his migration from Epidauros to the Piraeus and to Athens in 420 B.C. (IG II2 4960), and later (after 406/05 B.c.) they admitted Dexion, the Receiver, the hero into whom they transformed Sophocles after his death.35 Asklepios 35 Cf. also Foucart, Le culte des Heros chez les grecs, 11 ff., 125, and F. R. Walton, Harvard Studies in Class. Phil. XLVI (1935), 170 ff. The hieron of Dexion was, I think, a memorial chapel. It was constructed, according to our best source, the Vita of Sophocles (11) (cf. Jahn-Michaelis, Sophoclis Electra, 1 ff.), by lophon, his son, with the concurrence necessarily of the orgeones (cf. IG II2 1326). The Etym. Mag. s.v. Ac-Lov reports (4aaoiv) that "the Athenians" constructed a heroon for Sophocles and named him Dexion, and Istros mentions a decree passed by them ordaining the offering of a sacrifice (ObLEv) to him every year (FHG I, p. 425). It is probable in the case of the lexicographer, and intelligible in the case of Istros, a non-Athenian who can hardly be expected to have had personal familiarity with the jurisdiction of the orgeones and is respon- sible for several erroneous statements in the Vita of Sophocles, that an enactment of the association was conceived to be an act of the Athenian state. Sophocles was buried in the tomb of his ancestors on the road to Deceleia, eleven stades from the wall of the city (Vita, 15). That, if anywhere, was the place for a heroon; but our report is so circumstantial that it seems excluded that he received heroic honors at his tomb; and a public heroizing of the poet at the time of his death is incredible both on general grounds and in view of the negative evidence of Aris- tophanes' Frogs. Foucart (125) seems to me to have interpreted the transaction correctly: "I1 6tait done impossible aux Orgeons d'installer dans leur chapelle un</page><page sequence="32">88 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW entered the hieron of Amynos, Dexion received a shrine of his own - a small chapel abutting on the main hieron - so that the orgeones, who remained undivided, though possibly not unenlarged, came to possess two sacred precincts. Since they held annual reunions in each shrine on distinct dates (IG II2 1252, line 11) they had two Hosts instead of one after ca. 406 B.C. The story of Dexion can be pieced together from our various sources to run as follows. According to the temple-chronicle of the urban Asklepieion (IG II2 4960) compiled by Telemachos of Acharnai, who was chiefly instrumental in founding and equipping it, Asklepios "came up from Zea (the little harbor) at the time of the Great Mysteries (420 B.c.) and entered the Eleusinion." This statement undoubtedly rests on an epiphany of Asklepios (cf. Plut. Non posse suaviter vivi, 22, p. 1103 B), which revealed his presence not only in Athens but also in the Piraeus. What follows chronicles a bit of human history, reminiscent of the Pisistratus-Phye legend: "He (Asklepios) sent for, and brought, in a chariot, from Epidaurus, a snake (cf. Paus. II 28), (his own living symbol) while Telemachos stood by his side" (TiX[e],adXo[v 7ra[paorrvro]s- my restora- tion), and drove the horses (Wilamowitz, Glaube der Hellenen, II 222, 223, 1). The snake was presumably in a box or jar. A precise parallel to this incident is reported by Pausanias (II 10, 3): "The Sicyonians say that the god (Asklepios) was carried to them from Epidaurus on a carriage drawn by two mules, that he was in the likeness of a serpent, and that he was brought Heros apelle Sophocle. Ils eurent I'idee, me semble-t-il, de le dedoubler et de tirer de lui une personnalite fictive qu'ils designerent, comme on le fit souvent pour les Heros, non par son nom, mais par un surnom. Et ce surnom, AElowv, le montrait accomplissant l'acte de piete le plus glorieux pour lui-mgme et pour la confrerie, l'accueil fait ' une divinite nouvelle venue ' Athenes." In the Greek cult of the Ptolemies the deified rulers were defined by their epithets as Soteres, Euergetai, Philadelphoi, etc., Alexander the Great alone being a god in his own name (Wilcken, GGA 1895 141 n. 1). Fr. Pfister (Reliquienkult, 121 n. 435) rejects the interpretation of Dexion given by Etym. Mag. (wr' 7~s 70o- 'Ao-KX7rLto beLar:ws), and substitutes for it one of his own, "nattirlich hat der Heilgott seinen Namen nach der heilenden rechten Hand." This gesture of the outstretched right hand was, however, too constant a feature of the iconography of Greek deities (cf. e.g. below, 102, 109, n. 52) to be name-giving for any one of them.</page><page sequence="33">THE ATTIC ORGEONES 89 by Nicagora of Sicyon, the mother of Agasicles and the wife of Echetimus" (Trans. by W. H. S. Jones, Loeb Classics). For similar transplantings of Asklepios in the form of a snake see Paus. III 23, 6; Livy, Epit. XI. On the arrival of Telemachos in Athens, the Asklepieion was not yet constructed: its inaugu- ration was delayed by a claim of the Kerykes to the projected site (419 B.C.).36 In view of the opposition of the Eleusinian s6 The Eleusinion was situated on the north-west slope of the Acropolis (Wachs- muth, PW V 2335; Shear, Hesperia, VIII, 207; IX 268). It had been enclosed so completely that in 431 B.c. it could be kept free from refugees (Thucy. II 17, 1). Thus its delimitation (bpLaur6s) was effected much earlier than 420 B.c. The Eleu- sinion cannot have had frontier troubles in 419 B.c. We have nothing but the counter-claim of the Kerykes to the site ([a8 X]wpto, IG II 4960, 1. 15) projected for the Asklepieion to lead us to suppose (cf. Hiller, IG I1, p. 293; Wilamowitz, Glaube der Hellenen, II t23) that the partisans of Asklepios proposed to encroach on, i.e., take a portion of, the Eleusinion for the new god. That is not enough. The Kerykes may easily have contested his establishment in the area on the south slope of the Acropolis in which the Asklepieion was constructed for good, though unknown, reasons. Since the Asklepieion was initially a private hieron (cf. Robert Schlaifer, Harv. Stud. Class. Phil. 1940, 240; Class. Phil. 1943, 40, n. 13), equipped largely, if not exclusively, by Telemachos at his own expense, the Kerykes may have represented simply the public interest. In Rome Asklepios was brought from Epidaurus in 293 B.c. because of a pestilence (Livy Epit. XI). The back- ground for his importation by Athens was undoubtedly the Great Plague, the oc- casion the Peace of Nikias, which gave again to the Athenians access to Epidauros between 421 and 419 B.c. It is conceivable that there were Athenians who thought that a shrine in the Piraeus was sufficient; but it is intelligible that others, mindful of the horrors of 430-427 B.C., thought it wise to leave nothing undone to secure the aid of the god of healing. The Kerykes were necessarily participants in the action taken (by the state?) in establishing the Epidauria, a fete intercalated in the middle of the Great Mysteries to celebrate the day (fixed as Boedromion 18) of Asklepios' arrival in the Eleusinion; and, regarding this outstanding public recognition as completely adequate, they may have sought to head off projects for founding private hiera of the god in the asty. From ancient times there were many little shrines and altars of gods and heroes on the slopes of the Acropolis (Broneer, Hesperia, 1I 346, 415 ff., IV 118 if., VIII 428). The stretch west of the theatre of Dionysos can hardly have been an exception (cf. Judeich, Top. von Athen,2 320, n. 3). In it were two springs (IG 12 874, 875), and to it may have descended in ancient times a path from the top of the citadel. The Kerykes would doubtless have had specific grounds for intervention if an altar or shrine of De- meter, for example, existed in this area. We do not know at what moment the state took over the Asklepieion and created a public priesthood of Asklepios. It may have been at the time, whatever that is (post 412/11 B.C. in any case), at which the temple-chronicle of Telemachos ended. The earliest known public priest is dated by Pritchett and Meritt (The Chronology of Hellenistic Athens, 75) at about 360 B.c.</page><page sequence="34">90 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW genos the Eleusinion was hardly available for the reptile. Sophocles, a man of equal kindliness, piety, and distinction, whose interest in Asklepios was well known - he composed a paean in his honor (IG II2 4510) -, and whom a tradition pre- served by Plutarch connects with the epiphany, stepped into the breach and "received" the snake in his own house (ir 7r abTro o'Kla, Etym. Mag. 1. c.; cf. Plut. Numa, IV 6; Wilhelm Schmid, Gesch. d. griech. Lit. I Q 320, n. 1), thus assuming the function of "receptionist" which at a later date Publius Cor- nelius Scipio Nasica, the vir optimus in civitate in the judgment of the Senate, performed on the arrival in Rome of the Black Stone which symbolized Magna Mater (Livy, XXIX 10, 14, Graillot, Le culte de Cvyble, 51 ff.). It has been thought that the olKla was in the Amyneion, but the text excludes this. An Arcadian decree (IG V 9 265, lines 21 ff.) shows how easy it came to the Greeks to use a private house as a sacristy: "fur- thermore she (the priestess) received the goddess (Kore) in her own house as is the custom for those who successively become priests" ([,]wilr aro aE Kal TraV BV E iTV l Lrv 1C oK' cav KaKOCS iEaYT EOos roLs [ 1]e[i] vo'votos itpdaLtv). It was doubtless more convenient for Sophocles to give the serpent of Asklepios tendance, including sustenance and an altar, in his own house than in the precinct of Amynos, where moreover, even though he was priest, his presence was so rarely required that the snake would have been less safe. It is a precious detail to find the idol of the Athenians, then a genial, serene, dignified gray- beard, conversant with, but untroubled by, the moral and re- ligious contradictions of his great age, doling out eggs to a sacred snake and sacrificing cocks to Asklepios on a domestic altar. The orgeones did their bit by associating the newly arrived god with the old hero in their cult. Once the Askle- pieion was ready Sophocles was naturally rid of his charge. After his death and his heroization by the orgeones as Dexion, Telemachos, whose services tended to be eclipsed by those of the famous tragedian, recorded on a stone the fact that he it was who provided thefirst altar for Asklepios in the Asklepieion (IG 112 4961, 4355; cf. Poseidippos in Athenae. VII 318d). Other writers could with equal propriety affirm that the first altars</page><page sequence="35">THE ATTIC ORGEONES 91 were set up by Sophocles, one in his house and a second, prob- ably in the Amyneion (Palatine Anthology, 6 145). He was, it seems, life-long priest of the orgeones, and hence we can hardly go astray if we assume that it was on his initiative that Amynos got Asklepios as synnaos and with him a long lease of life (below 191). A sculptured figure of the "Receiver" was probably set up in the small chapel to confer on Sophocles immortality of re- membrance (cf. Isocr. V 134, IV 84). A cult of "Sophocles" might have been a cult of the dead: a sacrifice to Dexion had, it seems to me, no such implications. No ex-votos to Dexion have come to light (cf. p. 86, n. 33, 191). None was to be ex- pected; since, as Nock points out (CAH X, 481), "The touch- stone of piety in antiquity is the votive offering, made in recog- nition of supposed deliverance in some invisible manner from sickness or other peril. This we do not find directed to rulers dead or living." Sophocles' metamorphosis into Dexion clearly emanated from an Asklepian environment. Dexion the Receiver, in fact, served as a link between Amynos and Asklepios. (8) Orgeones, probably of Asklepios, but quite distinct from those of Amynos, Asklepios, and Dexion, appear, possibly in the third century B.C., in a catalogue of Prospaltioi, found at Keratea in the Mesogeia, who made a dedication to the god (IG II2 2355). They were sixteen in number and, as their names show, they belonged to a small group of closely interrelated families (cf. Kirchner PA 93 and 8816). In the first family the names are Agatharchos, Agathaios, Autokles, Ameipsias, Ameinias; in the second we find Theomnemon, Theagenides, Theophantos, Theomnestos. We are in- clined to believe that such was the internal complexion of the old Attic orgeones generally."3 Possibilities to hold in mind in their case are whether they made a dedication to Asklepios and were orgeones of some other deity 37 In size, interlocking of families, and homonymity of names the rural thiasos of a phratry whose members, twenty in number, are catalogued in IG II2 2344 (cf. A. Koerte, Hermes, 37, 1902, 587; Ferguson, Class. Phil. 5, 1910, 257 ff. and Class. Stud. Capps, 157 n. 60; De Sanctis, Atthis2, 59 n. 1; Premerstein, Ath. Mitt. 35, 113) is strikingly like this association of orgeones. The essential differ- ence is that the thiasos had Zeus and Athena as its patrons; these orgeones, like all others, did not. Thiasoi of the Demotionidai might contain, on occasion, fewer than three members (IG IF 1237, lines 76 ff.). Gennetai, on the other hand, who lacked any tie of real kinship (cf. Ferguson, Hesperia, VII, 23 f., and, in addition to the records there cited, [Demosth.] LIX 61), disclose no such inter- locking of families or homonymity of names.</page><page sequence="36">92 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW and whether they constitute a roster of the entire association or only of such members of it as belonged to the deme of Prospalta. Judging from the size of analogous associations (above, n. 24) we may say that sixteen was prob- ably the full complement of its members. If it had the normal organization its Host of the moment need not have been designated by title. His name may have headed the catalogue. The definition of Pollux (above, p. 63) will therefore apply to it: its members were all grouped in one deme. The prima facie indications are that the god of their dedication was the god of their cult; had they been worshippers of a different god they would be expected to name him even in a dedicatory inscription. This being so, the orgeones of Prospalta can hardly have been organized for the worship of Asklepios earlier than 420/19 B.c. They were probably a rural counterpart of the urban orgeones of Amynos, Asklepios, and Dexion; and like this association they may have practiced the cult of a hero, in this case some rustic hero, before adopting Asklepios. In such circumstances they could hardly have escaped making dedications to the new god alone. Asklepios made great progress in Attica in the Hellenistic age. Hence it is not surprising to find another association of Athenian citizens incorporated to do him service (IG I2 1293, 2353). They called themselves Asklepiastai. Corporate names ending in -stai ordinarily denote eranistai (Poland, 30), the notable exception being no. (15) below. This type of eranistai is post- Aristotelian, and, mutatis mutandis, may be thought to be analogous, shall we say, to Les amis du Louvre. It is derived from an ancient institution quite distinct from that of the orgeones. (9) Another association of orgeones of heroes is known from two mortgage records (IG XII 8, 19, 314/13 B.C., and 21). The stones on which they were inscribed were found on the island of Lemnos and are to be connected with the Athenian cleruchs resident at Hephaistia. The association loaned 1000 drachmas on the security of one farm and 400 drachmas on the security of another. It was obviously not impecunious. The hero was Herakles iv Kb6EL. Kome, now Komi, was one of the many villages on Lemnos in which the Athenian cleruchs on the chora of Myrina and Hephaistia lived. The arable land of the fertile island yielded in 329/28 B.C. four-fifths as much wheat and barley as Attica (IG II2 1672, 11. 263 ff. cf. Beloch, Bevblkerung, 3, Griech. Gesch.2 II I 1, 300; De Sanctis, Storia dei Greci, II, 153). It was so extensive that only a fraction of the cleruchs - Beloch estimates the num- ber of their adult males at 7000 - could reside in the two political centres. At Kome, as the extant ruins show (Fredrich, Ath. Mitt. XXXI, 251 f., PWK XII 1929 f.), there was a shrine of Herakles with a substantial temple (15 X 32 m.). With this the orgeones were associated, possibly as owners, certainly as officiants. They were doubtless well4to-do cleruchs (zeugitai) of the neighboring countryside (cf. IG XII 8, 91 n.), and the chances are that their ancestors formed the association after they settled on the island rather than transplanted it from Attica, though a nucleus of immigrant orgeones is not excluded. Whence they got the funds which they invested in mortgages on real estate we do not know; nor for that matter, do we know how any of the orgeones - excepting those of Dionysos (below, no. (15)) - came to possess their endowments.</page><page sequence="37">THE ATTIC ORGEONES 93 (10) Two badly mutilated inscriptions, of which the second was cut in large letters on the side of a trapeza on top of the first, which, however, it did not obliterate completely, contain decrees of what is undoubtedly one and the same association of orgeones. The later of these inscriptions (med. s. III?), conjecturally assigned in IG II2 (1246), incorrectly as now appears, to the Mesogeioi, uses the word do[gma] instead of psephisma - a usage which is paralleled in IG II2 1343 - and is natural enough. The earlier, which will be published in a study of cult tables by Sterling Dow, its discoverer, dates from the late fourth or early third century B.C. and contains the phrase ~v io OttdawtL. This is without a strict parallel (cf. above, p. 62, n. 2). As pointed out by Poland (17 ff.), the corporate term, thiasos, is avoided in the earlier records of private associations even by the thiasotai (cf. above, p. 68). Thiasos was then the technical name for the subdivisions of the phratries (above, pp. 62, 67). Nonetheless the embarrassment in which the orgeones found themselves of not having a corporate name of their own (above, p. 61 f.) obviously led them to substitute thiasos on occasion for the completely colorless word koinon. In the body of an orgeonic decree inscribed on an orgeonic trapeza it could mislead nobody. Persons who officiated in some capacity and commended themselves to the orgeones were, in the unpublished decree, more than one in number, as is shown by the plural verb r eAXr nxl07av. Such they would be if the association were the orgeones of Amynos, Asklepios, and Dexion. But the trapeza (a large stone affair) was found near the Acharnian gate, a long way from the hiera of this triad. The Piraeic associations (below, pp. 95 f.) are, of course, ruled out of consideration. Provisionally it is wise not to identify the orgeones of the trapeza with any thus far known. For that matter they may belong in Class B. (11) A fragment of stone found in Athens on the street by "the Plaka" (near the gate of Hadrian) gives us the beginnings of six lines of an inscrip- tion from the fourth/third centuries B.C. recording some financial transac- tion of an association of orgeones. Professor Meritt has very kindly sent me his readings of a squeeze of the fragment by which the text in IG IIP (1294) is appreciably improved: [01OpyE4WE~ o- /L ET[cl [. .] 'ErLy6p 'Evsbo[v [. r0oV ALOs ro70 'E7r a[Kplov EaLav]o~tdiL [ipa]xjyW^[ 1ct6]oPs chiraV~aT[ [...... iE aro[ The major part of the stone is obviously lost, hence a restoration is hopeless. It should probably proceed from a comparison with documents like IG IP1 2499 and 2501 (cf. above, Nos. (2) and (3)), and Ditt. Syll.2 831 = Syll.3 1200. The orgeones apparently sold or leased something to Epigonos the son of Endios (of Lamptrai?, cf. Kirchner, P.A. 4705, 8812 and Hesperia, IX No. 38, 1. 3, p. 330), with whom the phrase [Tr]o ALObs To70 'Elra[Kpiov] is probably to be connected. The place in which the stone was found makes it improb-</page><page sequence="38">94 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW able that the stele was set up in a shrine of Zeus Epakrios."8 Presumably the shrine of the orgeones, in which the record should have been placed, was in Athens or its immediate neighborhood. With the purpose of indicating how the first three lines could be connected (and with that purpose only) I com- plete the sentence as follows: [O] bpyyeWves ol .rT[d name, demotic, dr 3ovro T76 epbY T70 name of deity] 'Eirty'vwt 'Evblo[v AaAirTp4e Kal 7TL KOLYVwL -V av6v7wv (or d at6Twv) EdS TO lEpbV (or T70 flwPv) T]ov Ato 70o 'Ewra[Kplov birt XVaEL t:xxi 3PaX/IXcv]. The transaction, as imagined, left the orgeones in possession of the hieron and entitled them to recover ownership by repayment of the sum for which it was "sold," i.e., the sum which they borrowed. An interval, in which was entered the verb essential for our understanding of the connection, separates [&amp;tav]oA-[ [epa]xAW&amp;[v] from what precedes. The absence of the article suggests that [apa]xpi&amp;[P] was followed by a numeral, and that the "distribution" affected only part of the cash received. (12) In IG II2 2947 (third/second centuries B.C.) we encounter orgeones, but their cult is not indicated. They come to our knowledge through having recorded on stone the grant of a crown to a certain Asklapon of Maroneia. Asklapon may have been a member of the association, if, like the orgeones of the Mother of the Gods (below No. (14)), it contained aliens; but he can have been equally well an outside benefactor. The stone was found in an olive grove in the region of the ancient Academy. Its provenience suggests that it belongs to an association otherwise unknown, since no other orgeonic record has turned up in or near the Academy. This association too may be- long in Class B. There is just a trace of a second "ancient decree" in the new inscription from the Areopagus. Enough of its first line remains, however, to bring the Host (hestiator) into relation with the revenues. It looks as if he were the head of the association: he sacrifices, divides the flesh, and may have had charge of finance. In all probability the office was liturgical in character, like that of the officials of the same name who administered the public liturgy of providing feasts (hestiaseis) for their fellow tribesmen (Demosth. 20, 1; 39, 7; Arist. Pol., 1321a, 37). A. Koerte (Ath. Mitt. XXI 305) makes the orgeonic Host a borrowing from the tribal institution. The two are undoubt- edly related. In each case the office of host was assumed in rotation by one after another of the members; but it seems to me that the tribal institution is the one that was borrowed, unless it be that the hestiaseis of the phylae 38 Zeus "on the heights" (Epakrios) is mentioned in a fragment of the Come- dian Polyzelos (Kock, CAF I, p. 791; cf. Etym. Mag. 352, 50). He had altars on Hymettos and Parnes, where there were altars of Zeus Ombrios also (Paus. I 392 ); cf. A. B. Cook, Zeus, II 873 2, n. 1, Rodney Young, AJA, 1940 1 ff. Altars of Zeus Ombrios stood in the Athenian agora in Roman times; Raubitschek, Hesperia, XII 79 f. Logically Zeus Ombrios could be worshipped anywhere but Zeus Epakrios only on "the heights."

The heads of the old Attic phylae were the phylobasileis. Hence, even if the tribal hestiaseis were pre-Kleisthenian, there would have been no need for special Hosts to give them. The orgeones need not have been as old as the old Attic phylae, but they were very ancient and passed from the sixth to the fifth century without violent readjustment. The Host acts as priest and perhaps as treasurer in the association of the Hero (Echelos) and the Heroines; and in the association of Amynos, As- klepios, and Dexion the two Hosts seem to have performed equally compre- hensive functions (p. 86). If my restoration of line 9 of IG II2 1989 is cor- rect (above, pp. 84 f.), the Host of the orgeones of "the Goddess" was the head of that association also; but there was a priest to perform the sacrifices. Apart from (4) and (10), fragments of decrees which tell us nothing to the point, the records of the other associations of orgeones in Class A are in one case a dedication, in another a judicial record, in another a citation of crown- ing, and in the rest leases or mortgages. They do not call for any mention of the Host. The orgeones collectively were naturally the principals in making leases, and acted as a group without the intermediation of their officials. In one lease, as noted above, a treasurer appears as the recipient of the rent. He was an orgeon designated year by year to serve in this capacity. The association thus staffed, with a treasurer, in addition, presumably, to a Host, was probably larger and richer than the others (cf. pp. 80 f. and n. 24), excepting perhaps the orgeones of Amynos, Asklepios, and Dexion. The importance of the Host attests the importance of the hestiaseis or deipna (Athen. V, 185 E) in the activity of the old Attic orgeones. Like the vari- ous associations (KOLVyCWlat) spoken of by Aristotle in the Nicomachean Ethics (1160a 19) "they combined to perform sacrifices and hold festivals in connexion with them, thereby both paying honour to the gods and provid- ing pleasant holidays for themselves" (Translation by Rackham, Loeb Classics). CLASS B The association of Amynos, Asklepios, and Dexion serves as a transition to the rest of the orgeones of whom we have knowledge. They have in common the worship of gods or goddesses; and the cult of imported deities. Asklepios is an importation like Bendis, the Mother of the Gods, and Aphrodite Hagne, the divinities with whom (excepting Dionysos who came to Attica so early that he was thoroughly at home there long before the third century B.C.) the remainder of the orgeonic records now to be discussed is concerned. These were all living deities. Hence the adoption of the orgeonic type of organization by their votaries shows of itself that the institu- tion did not belong distinctively to the cultus of the dead.</page><page sequence="40">96 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW It is hardly an accident that all these further records come from the Piraeus. It was there that these orgeones had their sacred precincts. The Piraeus was a deme of which the mem- bership was limited to the descendants of those enrolled in it at the time of Kleisthenes. The Piraeus was also, however, substantially a new town and it was inhabited by a large popu- lation of non-demotai - men who with their families had migrated without changing their deme affiliations from other parts of Attica -, and of aliens, Greeks and non-Greeks, from many parts of the Mediterranean world, whom the business of the Piraeus drew to it. The deme came to be a small politically organized enclave set in the midst of a population of unorgan- ized aliens or of citizens whose political, gentile, orgeonic, or phratry affiliations were with groups centered in other parts of Attica.39 The situation was thus uniquely favorable for the organization of new local religious ties and associations. In fact the Piraeic deme was compelled to take official action in the middle of the fourth century B.C. to control the use of one of its most important precincts (the Thesmophorion) by un- authorized groups (thiasoi) or persons (IG II2 1177). The orgeonic records in question concern Bendis, the Mother of the Gods, Dionysos, and Hagne Aphrodite (the Syrian Goddess), and they will be taken up in that order, which is also, it seems, the order of their creation. (13) So far as our records go the orgeones of Bendis present us with a novelty and something quite unique, an association of this type constituted wholly of aliens. Our first reference to this association is found in the opening lines of Plato's Re- public: "I went down yesterday to the Peiraeus," says Socrates, " - to pay my devotions to the Goddess, and also because I wished to see how they would conduct the festival since this was its inauguration. I thought the procession of the citizens very fine, but it was no better than the show made by the marching of the Thracian contingent." 40 What Socrates had seen was 39 The demarch of the Piraeus, unlike the demarchs of the other demes of Attica, was a public official selected by lot from the citizens generally (Arist. Ath. Pol. 54, 8). His authority was correspondingly wide. 40 Trans. by Shorey, Loeb Classics.</page><page sequence="41">THE ATTIC ORGEONES 97 the arrival in the Piraeus from Athens of the pompe of the na- tives and the pompe of the Thracians, both in honor of the Thracian goddess Bendis. After he had started to walk back to Athens he learned that the proceedings were not yet finished. There remained a torch-light race in the evening in which horse- men --a Thracian innovation (Nilsson, Griech. Feste, 252; Kazarow, PWK 9te Reihe, XI 505 ff.), and an expensive one - carried lighted torches and passed them along to one another as they raced (for a condensed illustration see P. Hartwig, Bendis, pl. II); and, in addition, a night festival (pannychis). So he turned back. From another even more authentic source (IG II2 1283) we learn that the Superintendents (epimeletai) of the Thracian orgeones met the procession on its arrival in the Piraeus and furnished its members in the Nymphaion with sponges, basins, and water with which to refresh themselves, gave them crowns which were de rigueur for banquets, and had lunch ready for them in the shrine of the Goddess. Presumably the epimeletai of the citizen orgeones did the like for the participants in the procession of Athenians. The fRte - the Bendideia, celebrated annually on the nine- teenth/twentieth of Thargelion 41 - was accordingly inaugu- rated at the dramatic date of the Republic, which is thought to be ca. 411/10 B.c.,42 after the return of Polemarchos to Athens in 412/11 B.C. Bendis was recognized by Athens some twenty years or so before 411/10. In the year 429/98 B.C. she appears among the Other Gods whose holdings of gold and silver were assembled on the Acropolis by the decrees of Kallias enacted in 434 B.c. (IG 12 310, 1. 9207 (BE[Ki68os]); cf. IG 12 91/2); and the presumption is that she already had a hieron from which her treasures were withdrawn. Giving effect to an oracle from Dodona the state conceded to the Thracians, what it had not conceded theretofore to alien groups (Cubvos rc2v aXXwv ovipv), the right to found and own a sanctuary of their national 41 Scholion on Plato, Republic, 327a. 42 Shorey, Loeb Classics, Introduction, viii.

This was probably done in the time of Pericles, the most likely moment being 431 B.c. on the conclusion of the treaty of alliance between Athens and Sitalkes, the powerful king of the Odrysians (Thucy. II 29, 96; Aristoph. Achar. 141 ff., cf. Ed. Meyer, Gesch. d. Alt. IV 74, 319, 391, 339, Leuk in PWK 9te Reihe, XI 4?91 if.). Her acquisition of a shrine must have antedated the organiza- tion of the Bendideia. With her was associated in the Piraeic cult the Thracian hero Deloptes (IG 11 1324), and on his ac- count both associations of orgeones had priests as well as priest- esses. It may be inferred from the constitution of the orgeones of the Mother of the Gods, which was modelled on that of the orgeones of Bendis (below, 109), that the priestess of citizens and Thracians alike was allotted annually from the womenfolk of the orgeones. The priest was undoubtedly an orgeon simi- larly designated. We know that the procession of the Thracians was conducted by the Thracian orgeones (IG II2 19 83, ca. 260 B.C.), and the evidence is that the procession of the citizens was conducted by the orgeones of citizens (cf. IG II2 1324). Official records of both associations have come into our possession; arranged in chronological order, with those of the Thracians marked by an asterisk, they are: IG II2 1255 (337/36 B.C.), 1256 (329/ 28 B.C.), 1361 (second half of the fourth century B.C.), 1324 (late fourth or early third century B.C., Dow, HTR, 1937, 197 n. 54), *1283 (961/60? B.C.), *19284 (259/58? B.C.). Accord- ing to an observation of Wilhelm (Oester. Jahresh.) V 1902, 132; cf. Kirchner IG 112 1361, n., Ferguson, Athen. Trib. Cycles, 81, n. 1), those which are dated on the second day of the month or crown bene meritos with a crown of olives (IG II2 1324) belong to the citizen orgeones, as does the orgeonic law of the latter half of the fourth century B.C. in which the second of each month is fixed as the day of meetings (IG II2 1361, 11. 16 ff.). Those records which are dated on the 8th day of the month (IG 112 1283, 8th of Hekatombaion, 1284, 8th of Skirophorion), or which use oak leaves in their crown (IG II2 1984) belong to the Thracian orgeones." Each association had superintendents, 43 Two records lack these criteria for assignment to one specific association,</page><page sequence="43">THE ATTIC ORGEONES 99 who had general oversight of the association's affairs, a priestess and a priest, a treasurer and a secretary (IG II2 1255, 1324). In addition the citizens had Makers of Sacrifices (hieropoioi, cf. IG II2 1361, 1. 16), who had the duty, over and above what the name implies, of collaborating with the superintendents in con- voking the meetings of the orgeones. In organization both differ markedly from the orgeones of heroes whom we have been considering heretofore. They are much more completely staffed. The Host (hestiator) is lacking. Obviously we have larger associations, with more complex affairs. The association of citizens consisted originally of members and their male descendants (IG II2 1361 1. 2).44 Succession was therefore hereditary. But in a law passed in the latter half of the fourth century B.C. provision was made for an increase in the membership and the association was opened to anyone who was willing (6 povXb6pEos) to pay the stipulated fee. As IG II2 1255 (337/36 B.c.) and 1956 (329/28 B.c.). If 1255 really concerns Bendis, as is probable, I should assign it to the citizens. The space in 1. 2 is too long by one letter to permit us to restore 'OXVb'Arov from IG 112 1284. On the other hand, there is a possible connection between IG II2 1255 and 1324. Thallos, secretary in 337/36 B.c., may be the father of Stephanos, epimeletes in the later document, if both are descendants of Stephanos son of Thallos of Lys. XIX 46; cf. Kirchner, P. A. 12883. IG 112 1255 honors three Athenian hieropoioi, o lriri (pvixov aipxov- Tos with a gold crown, because they had "well and loyally cared for the proces- sion, the distribution of flesh, and all other affairs." If these were the hieropoioi of the association, the association certainly consisted of citizens; if, as is more probable, they were three of the ten public hieropoioi (Arist. Ath. Pol. 54, 6), citizens would be more likely to command their services than Thracians. The receipt of a gold crown rather than the one of olive or oak normally conferred on the orgeonic officials suggests that the hieropoioi were public magistrates. IG II2 1496 does not make clear from which hieropoioi the dermatika (in 334/33 B.c. to the amount of 457 drachmas) came to the state annually after the time of Lycurgus, but it is commonly assumed, correctly, as I believe, that they were the public officials. All the dermatika obviously came from victims sacrificed by the state. The officials who handed over the dermatika were, I think, those who procured the animals: they may or may not have performed the sacrifices (cf., however, U. Kahrstedt, Untersuch. z. Magistratur in Athen, 289 f.). 44 Since orgeones regularly kept rolls of their members (Isaeus, II 14; IG II2 2355, 1325), which they on occasion transcribed on stone tablets, the problem raised by line 2 of this text and discussed by Ziehen (II 1, 41, n.) concerns only the occasion which called for the stele in question. The names of the KyovoL were not recorded on the stele, on which, however, new names were to be added as the new recruits contemplated were approved for admission to the association by the orgeones (lines 20 ff.).</page><page sequence="44">100 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW is not uncommon, even when this phrase occurs in laws, the words ols eTTv are understood with it (Demosth. XXIV 105, XLIII 54, XXIII 28; Arist. Ath.Pol. 56.6, 48.4, 9. 1). In a case in which non-citizens were comprehended Demosthenes (XXI 45) used &amp;vcra 7rw povXopuiv4. We are not justified in assuming that the association was opened to non-citizens. The purpose of the innovation was to insure that "the orgeones were as numerous as possible." Thereafter admission to the citizen association was not wholly hereditary. A further provision of the law empowered the orgeones to impose a fine of 50 drachmas on any member who presented, or put to vote, a motion nulli- fying the new ordinances, and to exclude him from the society. A member could accordingly be dropped for cause. The orgeones of the Mother of the Gods (No. 14) had a similar capacity (IG II2 1328 1. 15). The spectacular effect of the pompe depended upon the num- ber participating in it. Its size was accordingly a matter of concern to both associations of orgeones responsible for it. So far as we know all the participants were orgeones.45 Their ob- ligation to make the procession was imposed by public law. This is explicitly affirmed in a decree of the Thracian associa- tion (IG II2 1983, ca. 2961/60 B.c.). It is there stated that a public law "ordered" the Thracians to make the procession in honor of Bendis from the prytaneion in Athens to the Piraeus. 45 Since the Bendideia was a public fete the civic hieropoioi were concerned generally with its management; hence they had a care for the pompe (IG IF 1255). This, however, does not imply that non-orgeones marched in the pro- cession. Three decrees of thiasotai of Bendis have been found on the island of Salamis at the same spot (IG II2 1317, 1317b, and SEG II 10). The formal meetings of this association were held, like those of the citizen orgeones in the Piraeus, on the second day of the month. This suggests that there was some con- nection between the islanders and the Athenian (rather than the Thracian) association in the harbor-town; in fact all three decrees from Salamis were passed on the first second day of the month after the Bendideia, i.e., Skirophorion. These decrees are all votes of honor to the officials of the thiasotai. It is conceivable that they had celebrated the Bendideia on the island at the regular time, the 19/20th of the preceding month; but it is also conceivable that they had taken part in the great celebration in the Piraeus. The association on Salamis differs not only in its name from those in the Piraeus but also in its organization, in that it was served by a priest, not by a priestess and priest. Its members were ob- viously non-citizens, and doubtless non-Thracians.</page><page sequence="45">THE ATTIC ORGEONES 101 The orgeones apparently acted for the entire Thracian ethnos (for the ethne as recognized groups in Athens see IG II2 956, 11. 13, 53 f.), and the suggestion is strong that, while at any given moment the orgeones were a definite group of enrolled Thracians, all Thracians living in the Piraeus who cared to enter the association and to assume its obligations might do so (1983 11. 29 ff.). At a later time the Thracians in the asty created a separate association of orgeones and took steps to set up a hieron of their own (ca. 261/60 B.C.). Negotiations ensued between the two associations regarding the pompe. Arrangements were concluded for the two groups to march together and for the old association not only to make available to their city confreres on their arrival in the Piraeus all the services they furnished their own members, but also to include them solemnly in the prayers offered with the sacrifices; "so that, this being done (the text runs) and the whole ethnos being in harmony, the sacrifices may be offered to the gods and all else pertaining thereto done, according to the customs (patria) of the Thracians and the laws (nomoi) of Athens." Urban orgeones were permitted to join the Piraeic association, without, it appears, paying dues. During the afternoon victims were sacrificed and the orgeones banqueted from the flesh. Since the state, in and after 334 B.C., claimed the skins, animals for the Bendideia were furnished by the polis both then and earlier. To meet the costs of the sac- rifices offered by the association of citizens at the time of the Bendideia a fee of two drachmas was levied annually on each member (IG II2 1361); and the Thracians were doubtless sub- ject to a similar assessment. With payments of two drachmas per person it would take the contributions of some 35 persons to buy an ox (Stengel, Kultusalt.3, 115). From the sale of the skins of the victims sacrificed at the Bendideia the state realized 457 drachmas in 334/33 B.C. (IG II2 1496). At the rate of 3 drachmas per skin (Boeckh, Staatsh.3 97) or 41 (id. II 21*) 150 or 100 victims would have been required to yield this amount. The sacrifice was probably a hecatomb. Obviously the flesh of the animals furnished by the state was distributed among the magistrates and people (cf. IG II2 334); and it may</page><page sequence="46">102 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW have been carried home raw. Manifestly the Bendideia was a public fete. The orgeones may have banqueted privately, each asociation, or perhaps the Thracian alone, in its own hieron. Even though it had its own sacrificial animals and its own hieropoioi, the citizen group undoubtedly shared in the flesh of the victims furnished by the state. Such was certainly the case if the hieropoioi of IG II2 1255 were the public officials of that name. The chances are that the native orgeones took their portions of the public victims home with them. A pannychis, or night festival, was part of the Bendideia. Regarding this all we know is what is said in Plato's Republic (328a). Polemarchos suggests to Socrates, "and besides, there is to be a night festival which will be worth seeing. For after dinner we will get up and go out and see the sights and meet a lot of the lads there and have good talk." 46 What "the sights" were which a "lot of the lads" and others were "to see" by twilight or the light of the full moon 47 we do not know. Like Artemis, Bendis was a goddess of the wild-lands and the chase, and her cult images in Attica represented her as a strapping long-legged girl, clad in Thracian clothes with a kilted tunic, a jerkin made of the hide of an animal (panther, wolf?) with the tail, or its like, pendant in front, a peaked cap with an apron back, a cloak falling behind from her shoulders to her heels, and soft leather boots turned over above the calf. She is ac- companied by a hound, and holds her spear in her left hand while extending a patera, for the receipt of gifts or the bestowal of blessings, with her right (Cumont, Rev. Arch. II 1903, 381 if., P1. XVI; Foucart, Le culte de Bendis en Attique, Melanges Perrot, 95 ff.). Presumably the "sights" had a Thracian char- acter. Deloptes is less tangible (cf. Kern, Rel. d. Hell. II 39, n. 1; Kazarow in PWK ete Reihe, XII 475). Plastically repre- sented he is a bearded man leaning on a staff (P. Hartwig, Bendis, Taf. 1; Th. Wiegand, Ath. Mitt. XXV 172). His resemblance to Asklepios may or may not be significant. In the Samian inscription (Wiegand, l.c.) he has the title Hero. It is clear that the hieron which the Thracian orgeones 46 Shorey's transltion in Loeb Classics. 47 Nineteenth of the lunar month.</page><page sequence="47">THE ATTIC ORGEONES 103 founded and owned in the Piraeus was not the hieron in which the citizen orgeones met and sacrificed. The chances are that the latter was not established till the Bendideia was organized by the state in 411/10 B.C. or thereabouts; and, indeed, it is doubtful whether either association of orgeones antedated this event. The procession, from the civic hearth in Athens (&amp;ii- 7rs Trlar T? EKK 70o rpvravelov) to the Piraeus, with which the orgeones were primarily concerned, is, to be sure, affirmed by the Thracians in ca. 961/60 B.c. to have been covered by the original oracle from Dodona (IG II2 1983 11. 3 ff., but cf. 11. 10 ff.); but since it was clearly a novelty of the first celebration of the Bendideia its inauguration must have been deferred for some time after the Thracians founded their hieron in the Piraeus. Starting where it did the procession was an official linking of the Bendideion with the centre of Athenian civic and religious authority. The citizen orgeones contemplated that non-members would sacrifice in their shrine, but they re- quired that specified portions of the sacrificial animals should be given to their priestess and priest, the priestess getting hers from the female and the priest his from the male victims; and they imposed severe penalties for illicit sacrificing in their shrine. In their hieron there was a house which they let for profit and also a spring or a well the water from which they sold. The keeping of the house and the hieron in repair re- quired expenses which the orgeones had themselves to defray. In general they disposed of the shrine as they saw fit (cf. IG II2 1324 11. 25 ff.). As we have seen, the Athenian state had granted to the Thracians the right, denied to aliens, of acquir- ing real property and the privilege of consecrating it to Bendis. As owners they undoubtedly had charge of the upkeep of their shrine, but their records are of such a nature that they give us no information on the point. The two shrines may have been adjacent and together constituted the Bendideion which lay on the broad road leading from the agora of Hippodamos to the temple of Artemis Munychia (Xen. Hell. II 4 11; cf. Threp- siades, Praktika, 1935, 195). Upon these associations of orgeones the state put certain demands: as we have seen, it compelled the Thracians to make</page><page sequence="48">104 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW the procession; and the obligation of the natives to do likewise was one which, as citizens, they could not escape even if they had wanted to. The torch-race and the pannychis were prob- ably subject to the same constraint or obligation. The Ben- dideia was a national fete and the relation of the orgeones to it was like that of the genos of the Salaminioi to the Oschophoria (Hesperia, VII, 1938, 33 ff.). The orgeones of Bendis and Deloptes, both the citizen and the Thracian association, belong to the class of those worship- ping gods or goddesses. The action of the citizen group in calling themselves orgeones did not constitute much more of an innovation than the assumption of Asklepios by the orgeones of Amynos; but the use of the name orgeones by the Thracians was quite extraordinary and is, in my opinion, grounded in the performance by them, by order of the state, of a public func- tion (cf. above, n. 8). If their offices had been purely private they would probably have been called thiasotai; such at any rate was the nomenclature of associations of aliens in the fourth and later centuries. The state may have thought it expedient not to draw distinctions of nomenclature between the citizens and Thracians who assumed jointly responsibility for the spectacular part of the Bendideia. During the epoch in which the Bendideia was inaugurated the Thracians were of importance both for Athens and Athenian policy. They were employed as mercenaries (Thucy. VII 29 f.; cf. Ed. Meyer, Gesch. d. Alt. IV 363) and they served as operatives in the mines (Xen. Ways and Means, IV 14; Cumont, Rev. Arch. II 1903, 381 ff.). After the Athenian disaster in Sicily, when the Lacedaemonians and the Athenians became competitors for the materials for oars and triremes, and the waters connecting the Aegean and the Black Sea became the chief area of naval operations, it must have seemed opportune to the Athenians to treat the Thracians resident in their land with peculiar consideration. We must now ask ourselves, who were the men from whom the citizen orgeones were formed? Two answers are possible: (a) Athenians who were already orgeones - men who might add membership in the association of Bendis and Deloptes to that which they already possessed and (b) Athenians (non-</page><page sequence="49">THE ATTIC ORGEONES 105 gennetai) who lacked membership in any association of orge- ones. Neither of these possibilities can be excluded. The case of Simon of Poros discussed below (p. 117) shows that at least in the later third century an Athenian who belonged to one society of orgeones became a charter member of another newly formed. Dual membership was accordingly permissive. On the other hand, the legislation providing for the enlargement of the citizen orgeones of Bendis in the late fourth century (IG II2 1361) would doubtless have been formulated differently if the new recruits had had to be drawn from existing groups of orgeones. There accordingly existed at this time and earlier a reservoir of potential orgeones. A full explanation of the source of this reservoir would re- quire an examination of the entire internal history of Athens; and this is not the place for that. All that is possible here is to enunciate dogmatically a series of pertinent propositions. (1) At Solon's time - the date of the second law quoted above (p. 68 f.) - the citizens automatically registered in the rolls of the phratries were either gennetai or orgeones, the former rep- resenting Solon's pentakosiomedimnoi and hippeis, the latter his zeugitai. The keeping of written catalogues by the phratries was a comparatively recent innovation (cf. Rodney Young, AJA, 1940, 8). The general assumption underlying Draco's laws on homicide was that all Athenians were phrateres, but until systematic registration was completed many citizens of, shall we say, the under-privileged class, whose citizenship was passive until Solon's reforms, were presumably without demon- strable phratry connections, and, so far as they got any phratry protection at all, they got it through the championship of their claims by interested nobles. Solon's law settled the problem for citizens who belonged to the associations of gennetai and orgeones, but apparently left it to the phratries to use their discretion in registering the others, who had to be dealt with individually. In this particular, as in his political program generally, Solon compromised. But by shifting the basis of citizen privileges and rights from birth to property, he enabled individual orgeones to become potential gennetai and individual thetes to become potential orgeones. At some time or other</page><page sequence="50">106 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW the list of the gene - the "so-called gene" of the lexicographers --became closed. One of the latest gene to be created was that of the Salaminioi. Its origin seems to belong to the cen- tury covered by the lives of Solon and Pisistratus (Hesperia VII 1938, 42 if.). Obviously the list of the orgeones remained open: new associations of this type were being created as late as 420/19 B.c. (cf. No. (8)) and later. The various associations of Solon's first law (above p. 64) were, of course, not mutually exclusive: "men going forth for plunder" (pirates, raiders), for example, must have been phrateres and, on occasion, gennetai, and gennetai were certainly phrateres. (2) Kleisthenes ex- tended active citizen rights downwards and made them de- pendent upon membership in the demes and phylae, the latter being fictitious kin-groups connected each with a divinely designated Ahnherr of Attic provenience. All Athenian citizens thus became in established theory potential phrateres, and it seems unquestionable that all phyletai who applied were admitted thereafter to phratries. The identification of IG II2 2344 as the roll of a single thiasos, not of an entire phratry, disposes of Koerte's idea (cf. above, n. 37 and below, n. 48) that in the fourth century B.C. only a small fraction of the Athenians were phrateres. (3) It may have been in 507/06 B.C. that the phratries, adjusting their organization to the new members, created their own subdivisions - the thiasoi -, thus carrying out systematically the fusion of new "citizens" and old which was one of the primary objects of the Kleisthenian system (Draco's and Solon's phratries had been aristocrati- cally controlled, IG I12 115 11. 18 f.). Aristotle (Ath. Pol. 21, 6) has been taken to prove that the list of the phratries was closed before 507/06 B.C., but the point is arguable, and it may be that it was not till Kleisthenes had completed his reforms that the creation of new phratries ceased.48 In any case, as we have 4s In Ath. Pol. all that Aristotle says is that no phrateres were dispossessed of membership in their respective phratries. In his Politics (1319b 20) he clearly implies that Kleisthenes increased the number both of phylae and phratries. The two statements are not contradictory. What seems contradictory is Kleisthenes' policy of manning new phratries with new citizens and his policy of fusing new elements and old in a common brotherhood. This contradiction becomes less flat if we assume, as we may, that many old citizens (thetes?) lacked registration</page><page sequence="51">THE ATTIC ORGEONES 107 seen, the list of orgeones remained open after 507/06 B.c. Thereafter phrateres who were not members of orgeonic as- sociations might continue to found new associations of this type. Naturally the largest accumulation of such potential orgeones was to be found in the Piraeus, but not exclusively there (cf. No. (8) above). In the view of Athenian internal development thus outlined the creation of citizen orgeones of Bendis and Deloptes near the end of the fifth century presents no difficulties. (14) A second non-heroic cult with an association of wor- shippers distinguished by the name orgeones is that of the Mother of the Gods. The decrees of this association,49 ar- in phratries in 507/06 B.c., so that the new phratries contained them as well as the VoorroXraL. The division of the phratries, old and new, into thiasoi, them- selves kin groups (cf. n. 37), would have brought it about that in many cases thiasoi of the old brotherhoods and the new were hardly distinguishable socially. Without dismembering or adulterating the existent phratries Kleisthenes could go no farther along this line in carrying out his policy of civic fusion. De Sanctis (Atthis2, 58 if.) is right in rejecting the view that the number of the phratries was ever fixed at twelve. His comment on my argument (Class. Phil. 1910, 271) is quite justified. The Aristotelian scheme which includes twelve phratries (Ath. Pol. frg. 3) purports to give the constitution of Ion, not the constitution of con- temporary times. The number twelve is probably due to an unwarranted identifi- cation of phratries and old Attic trittyes, which were in fact twelve in number (Class. Stud. Capps, 151 ff.). We now know the names of eight phratries, the seven listed in the article just cited (154) and the Medontidai (above, No. (5). For the Etionidai see below, Appendix 2). There were doubtless many others. For the ruins of what was probably a phratrion, with a well-preserved inscribed altar of Zeus Phratrios and Athena Phratria, see Kyparisses and Thompson, Hesperia, VII 615 ff. 49 Though the stone was found in the hieron from which the records of the or- geones have come (Foucart, Assoc. relig. 199), IG II2 1273 (284/83? B.c.) does not belong to them. It is a decree (two decrees rather) of thiasotai, not orgeones, and they were served, not by a priestess, but by a priest. The priest, moreover, held office for a half-year only, the calendar year being divided into two halves, one beginning with or in Boedromion, the month of the autumnal equinox, and other with or in Elaphebolion, the month of the vernal equinox. A semestral term of office is not without precedent: it existed for example in Delphi for the bouleutai and in Thessaly for tamiai (IG IX 2, Index, 315) and was apparently quite com- mon throughout Greece (Arist. Pol. 1999a, 1308a). A term of office shorter than a year was doubtless more practical for an association of aliens whose business, when it was foreign trade, did not permit them to be in the Piraeus throughout the year. Even in the case of the orgeones the annual term of their treasurer en- tailed makeshifts (IG II2 1329, cf. below, p. 114). The plenary assembly of the</page><page sequence="52">108 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW ranged in chronological order, are: IG II2 1316 (246/45? B.C.), 1301 (220/19 B.C.), 1314 (213/12 B.C.), 1315 (211/10 B.C.), 1328 I (183/82 B.C.), 1327 (178/77 B.C.), 1328 II and 1329 (175/74 B.C.), 1334 (ca. 70 B.C.).50 It is to be observed that the sanctuary of this association was a private Metroon located on the peninsula of Akte in the Piraeus, not the civic Metroon situated, along with the Bouleuterion and the Tholos, on the west side of the Agora in Athens. The Mother Goddess of the temple in the city was originally an Athenian parallel, with- out the Mysteries, to the Demeter of the Thesmophoria and Eleusis: 51 the Mother of the Gods of the Metroon in the Piraeus was the Great Mother of Pessinus in Phrygia, privately im- ported and worshipped in the Piraeic Metroon first by an as- sociation of aliens (thiasotai, IG II2 1273) and then, at some point between 984/83 and 246/45? B.C.,52 by orgeones, who thiasotai, for passing decrees and choosing officers, was held in Anthesterion, two months earlier than that of the orgeones (cf. Pritchett and Meritt, The Chronol- ogy of Hellenistic Athens, 91 ff.). "Les ceremonies de rite phrygien duraient du 15 au 27 mars" (Graillot, Le culte de Cybele, 116). The vernal equinox (March 91) fell in their midst. The beginning of the semester of the thiasotai thus pre- ceded the time of the chief fete of the Mother of the Gods while the &amp;yopP Kvpia of the orgeones followed it. Its officials were aliens, not citizens. In 284/83 B.C. it was this association which owned the hieron of the Mother of the Gods in Akte (IG II2 1273, 11. 7, 24, 31). 50 See Appendix 4. 61 H. Thompson in Hesperia, VI, 1937, 205 ff., cf. William A. McDonald, The Political Meeting Places of the Greeks, 159 ff. Her cult statue, made apparently by Agorakritos, shows, however, that at a relatively early date she was so repre- sented plastically as to be in fact an Atticized Kybele. Cf. A. von Salis, Jahrbuch, XXVIII, 1913, 1 ff., 23. This image, which was famous in Roman times (Paus. I 3, 5; Pliny, Nat. Hist. XXXVI, 17; Arrian, Peripl. 9) had much influence on the subsequent iconography of the Mother of the Gods. There is, I believe, no trace of Attis in the civic cult. Could the presence of two images of the Mother in each of a considerable number of Attic naiskoi be a recognition (made at some one time perhaps and expressed in a doubled cult-image in a particular shrine) that the goddess was two in one? Cf. below, p. 138. 52 The thiasotai were building their oikos in 984 B.c.; cf. IG II2 1273. The earliest datable dedication in the hieron was made by Manes and Mika, apparently aliens, about the end of the fourth century B.C.: (IG II2 4609; cf. Conze, Arch. Zeitung, 38, 1 Taf. 2). This does not need to date the founding of the hieron earlier than 306 B.C. (cf. above, p. 67). For the transfer of the shrine to the or- geones see Appendix 4. The hieron was excavated in 1855 by le corps d'occupa- tion franCais du Pir6e. Louis Robert (BCH 1936, 206 f.) refers for the history of the dig to E.

The general organization of the orgeones was identical with that of the orgeones of Bendis from which it was obviously copied, either directly or indirectly: epimeletai, treasurer, secretary, priestess (but no priest and no hieropoioi). The priestess was elected by lot annually from the womenfolk of the association,"5 and could serve more than du Louvre), M1Imoires de la Soc. Nat. des Antiquaires de France, 75 (1918), 5, Serie 8, pp. 91-129, and, for a catalogue of the dedications taken from the shrine, to H. Graillot, Le culte de Cybele, 507, n. (cf. Foucart, Assoc. relig. 199 ff.). Arranged in their chronological order, the inscriptions attached to these dedica- tions are as follows: IG I 4609, already commented on; 4687a, dated by the name of Glaukon, priestess of the orgeones in 214/13 B.C. (IG II2 1314), taken from a votive offering to Men; 2950/1, inscribed on a lustral basin given by Nikias, tamias (of the orgeones), and dated in the second century B.C.; 4696, from a dedication to Artemis Nana, and 4703, from a round marble altar, dated before the middle of the first century B.C.; 4714, dated in the archonship of Epikrates early in the principate of Augustus, from a dedication to "the Mother of the Gods accessible, healing, Aphrodite"; 4038, dated in the age of Augustus; 4760, dated in the first/second centuries A.D.; 4759, dated in the second century A.D.; 2887, dated by the name of the archon Philistides in 163/64 A.D. (Oliver, Hesperia, XI 86), from a dedication made by Melitine, an ex-priestess (of the orgeones) in the priesthood of Philemon, son of Praxiteles of Phlya, a well-known man; and 4814, dated in the second/third centuries A.D., from a dedication made by a paidagogos to Hermes Hegemon. There is also a lot of uninscribed votive offerings in Graillot's catalogue, notably terra cotta statuettes of the goddess, seated, with a lion on her lap or crouched at her side, and holding a patera in her right hand and a tympanon or a sceptre in her left. From IG II2 2887 we may infer that in 163/64 A.D. a publ|c priest was associated with the priestess of the orgeones in the cult of the Mother of the Gods in the Piraeus. In other words, by that time the state had taken over the Metroon (cf. above, n. 36). There is a good chance that this step is connected with the transformance of the cult of the Mother of the Gods throughout the Roman Empire with which it can have syn- chronized, cf. Wissowa, Rel. u. Kultus d. Rimer2, 392 ff. The bringing of Artemis Nana (cf. Foucart, Assoc. relig. 101) and Aphrodite into association with the Mother of the Gods calls for no comment. For dedica- tions to Men and Hermes it will suffice to quote the following inscription from Rome (CIL VI 499 = Dessau, Inscr. lat. sel. 4147, 374 A.D.; cf. Robert, Mdlanges Bidez, 802 f.): "Matri Deum Magnae Idaee summae parenti Hermae et Attidi Menotyranno jnvicto." 53 For the selecting of priestesses by lot from the womenfolk of an association see the record of the Salaminioi published in Hesperia, VII 1938, pp. 2 ff., 11. 12 ff.; cf. pp. 50 ff. Neither in this instance nor in the one with which we are now con- cerned is it implied that the womenfolk were members of the association except insofar as they were such through being wives, sisters, daughters, etc. of members; cf. above, p. 75ff. In IG II2 1328 II we have the phrase iTasT re lepeaics Kal ro^s 6p-yercv. In a Coan document regulating the appointment of a priestess of Demeter (Ziehen, Leges sacrae, II 1, 132) it was provided that women absent at</page><page sequence="54">110 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW once if the lot so decided. The treasurer and the secretary were appointed without limit of time or regularly reappointed year after year, while the epimeletai changed, it seems, each year. In their business they thus followed the pattern of Athens. Their religious practices, however, were taken over from the homeland of the Mother of the Gods, with the omission, how- ever, of some of the more repulsive features, notably the serv- ices of galloi (Cumont, PW VII, 676) and metragyrtai. We should look for no analogies to them in the practices of the old Attic orgeones. These yielded them their name with the im- plied reservation of membership to the descendants of mem- bers. The second implication of the name - the exclusion of aliens (cf. M. N. Tod, Sidelights on Greek History, 74) - does not hold. The orgeones took over the hieron from its founders, who were thiasotai and aliens (its two officials in 284/83 came, one from Troezen and the other from Herakleia); and part of the transaction was apparently the incorporation of at least some of these with themselves. By their inclusion, we may assume, the orgeones escaped the necessity of raising a consider- able sum of money for land and buildings. The Athenians were naturally the predominant element, and accordingly they arranged it so that their wives were the priestesses, they them- selves controlled the civil offices, and it was they exclusively who made the motions at the business meetings. The inclusion of aliens was a deviation from ancient practice. The orgeones of Bendis did not furnish a complete analogy since there the Thracians and the citizens formed separate associations; but nonetheless, and however sanctioned, Thracians had been orgeones long before 284/83 B.c. As we have seen (above, p. 68), Athenians kept pretty well away from the associations of thiasotai during the third century B.C.: participation in them meant for citizens a social let-down. The aliens among the orgeones of the Mother of the Gods were probably zealous workers in a small way because they had a sense of privilege. Foucart (Assoc. relig. 139 ff.) demolished effectively exag- the time of allotment could be represented by their Kbpcot. Normally the women themselves would have to draw the lots.</page><page sequence="55">THE ATTIC ORGEONES 111 gerated notions as to the r61le of social uplift and humanitarian- ism in the activities of Greek private associations; but the example of the orgeones of the Mother of the Gods in putting an Ergasion on their board of epimeletai in 178/77 B.C. (IG II2 1327), and perhaps one alien each year, indicates a certain weakening, attributable to the intermingling of citizens and aliens in a religious fraternity, of deep-rooted prejudices. The influence of the great Athenian schools of philosophy (thiasoi in fact if not in name), which ignored considerations of nation- ality and, in the Garden, of sex, was, however, more powerful as a social solvent and at a higher level. The transfer of the Metroon in the Piraeus from thiasotai to orgeones undoubtedly strengthened the association both socially and administratively. It also put this cult of the Mother of the Gods in the hands of people who were likely to be more sensitive to Athenian public opinion, which had long reacted strongly against many of its features (Foucart, Assoc. relig. 153 ff.). Certainly there is no evidence for these fea- tures in the records of the orgeones. The substitution of a priestess for a priest must mean something. It probably regis- ters a defeat for Attis. The ladies of the old Attic orgeones participated in the an- nual sacrifices-feasts; but the stroseis and the agermoi with which the women of the orgeones of the Mother of the Gods were particularly, if not exclusively, concerned were foreign to them. The ex-priestesses of the Mother of the Gods formed a permanent group which was capable of formulating a collective request for presentation to the association by one of the orgeones. In other words it might on occasion be a sort of probouleutic body regarding matters which concerned it directly.54 Part of the staff of the association was a corps of woman "cupbearers" (phialephoroi) and "ladies in waiting on the Goddess" who, adorned with a silver kosmos furnished by the priestess, formed the cortege of the Goddess and her consort in the processions, presumably through the streets, at which 5 On the known occasion they intervened to support a policy of the secretary of setting limits to the expenses to which the orgeones in general and they in par- ticular were exposed (IG IP2 1328 I and 1329).</page><page sequence="56">112 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW collections were taken (cf. Ziehen, Leges sacrae, II 1, 44, p. 126, notes: Ditt. Syll.2 601, 25 = Syll.3 1015). As Ziehen points out, citing Ovid (ex. Pont. I 1, 39), these solemn processions gave the public an opportunity to offer their mite to the Mother of the Gods. The processionals were anything but vagrant metragyrtai (Hell. Ath. 225 is wrong). The priestess, alone or with the help of her husband, officiated at the sacrifices of the orgeones (IG II2 1316), opened the hieron on the specified days and stayed there till she closed it, and recorded the dedications made and the moneys received (fees paid by outside sacrificers, perhaps, cf. E. Ziebarth, Das griech. Vereinswesen, 161) in the course of her year of service (IG II2 1316). She also served as leader of the women connected with the society. Perhaps not at first, certainly later, she appointed a zakoros to assist her. During some period prior to 183/89 nB.c. a certain Euaxis per- formed model service in this capacity. For seven years (183/ 89-176/75 B.c.) the priestess was limited in her choice to ex- priestesses and was forbidden to reappoint anyone till all the ex-priestesses had had their turn. Then this limitation was removed and the zakoros in office was given by the orgeones a lifelong term. As befitted an association formed for the wor- ship of the Mother of the Gods, the womenfolk of the orgeones were unusually prominent in the cult-offices. The Mother of the Gods was worshipped by the orgeones in the same spirit as Magna Mater was worshipped in Republican Rome outside the Palatine. There is no analogy in Athens to the purely Phrygian cult established on the Palatine. What Rome imported and isolated on the Palatine was not the Great Mother alone but a complete Phrygian staff dedicated to her service (Dion. Hal. Rom. Antiq. II 19, 4: cf. Wissowa, Religion u. Kultus der Rimer, 319 f.). In the Piraeus the staff of Phrygians was absent. The rites performed at the Attideia were such as an Athenian priestess could perform with pro- priety; and if, as seems likely (Appendix 4), there was one Attideia for aliens and another for citizens, the rites for both must have been in greater or less degree Hellenized. There is evidence for a couch with two seats (Op6ot) in the proces- sion. There is evidence for the beating of kettledrums - the</page><page sequence="57">THE ATTIC ORGEONES 113 tympanon is present in the symbolism of the Mother of the Gods - and consequently of some emotional tension. There is evidence for at least some elements of the Phrygian myth (cf. the ex-voto to Nana); but there is no evidence for self- mutilation. The orgeones were the proprietors of the Metroon. It was a precinct enclosed by walls, ordinarily kept closed, but opened by the priestess on specified days. Before it was taken over by the orgeones it contained a house. In 220 B.C. there was in it a kitchen which was then in need of repairs. In it was a naos in which eikones ( 7rivaKL) of officials honored by the association were set up. Before this was a court in which on occasion stelai were ordered to be erected. Here it was that the sacrifices and ceremonies peculiar to the cult were performed, the participants feasted, and the processions were ordered. The orgeones rendered services (philanthropa) to the humbler population of the town (61771orLKoi),55 and in this and other ways made their presence felt in the community. They opened their shrine freely to men and women who sought by votive offerings to manifest their gratitude to Men, Artemis Nana, Hermes Hegemon rather than to the Mother of the Gods her- self or Attis, her consort. There is, however, no evidence that they sought to increase their membership by proselyting. The eisiteria which the priestess sacrificed were the sacrifices cus- tomarily offered at the opening of an association's new year on the occasion of the induction of new officers (PW V 2149, Po- land, 253). There is, indeed, a case (Poland, 306) in which the absence of the demotikon (otherwise non-significant, cf. Poland, 303 ff.) creates a strong presumption that in 178/77 B.c. (IG II2 1327, 1. 33) Ergasion, one of the epimeletai of the association, was an alien. He was probably a well-to-do descendant of one of the alien charter-members. Apart from the Thracians he is the only non-citizen known to have been an orgeon. A lex sacra of orgeones, IG IP2 1361 - an enactment of the citizen orgeones of Bendis - demonstrates that associations of this type could and did enlarge their membership by admitting to their ranks 11 Poland (314) translates S3niorwcoL "Demengenossen." If demesmen had been meant I6TpbTraL would have been used.</page><page sequence="58">114 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW citizens with the desire and capacity to assume the obligations of the society. Since the orgeones of the Mother of the Gods had aliens on their roll the possibility must be held open that they added Athenians after their incorporation. New mem- bers of civic status would, for us, be indistinguishable from old. The large, complex, highly staffed associations of Class B had less of the liens and intimacies of kin which barred new- comers in the old Attic orgeones. The orgeones of Bendis, both citizen and Thracian, had civic shows to stage which made it advisable for them to keep their circle large. As far as we know the orgeones of the Mother of the Gods had no such incentive. As an organization they had probably two con- flicting purposes, to impress the public by their spectacular rites, their processions combined with collections, their philan- thropa, 'their hospitality to would-be dedicants, and at the same time not to dilute too much the society which ran things. Since we are practically certain that the association possessed a cook-shop (IG II2 1301) we are assured that it also combined feasting with sacrificing, and, consequently, had the same reasons as the old orgeones to set limits to the recipients of portions of the sacrificed animals. The orgeones of the Mother of the Gods wanted to widen the appeal of their patron deity for religious reasons, and to preserve their integrity for social and practical reasons. There is reference in three decrees to special assessments (epidoseis) laid upon members, and it was by these apparently that the society was able to keep the premises in repair. In time of need financial aid was rendered to it by its officers. The secretary who had then held office for twelve years is said in an honorary decree of the year 175/74 B.c. (IG II2 1329) to have advanced money to the association without interest on many occasions when the treasurer was out of town. Pre- sumably his business took him abroad and it may be that the business of other members of the association also was foreign commerce. There is a prima facie basis for such a surmise in the fact that the orgeones had their headquarters in the Piraeus and included well-to-do people. This does not mean that mem- bers were exempt from the economic reverses to which all</page><page sequence="59">THE ATTIC ORGEONES 115 Athenians were liable. Since gennetai are known to have be- come impoverished ne'er-do-wells (Kirchner, PA 14990) the same is true afortiori of orgeones. To make sure that suitable obsequies should be rendered to deceased members, rich or poor alike apparently, the association possessed a burial fund, to supplement which, when the treasury was empty, the treas- urer on occasion provided the wherewithal from his private purse (IG II2 1397 11. 10 ff. 178/77 B.c.). This is the only as- sociation of orgeones for which anything of the sort is attested. It may have come to it with the thiasotai. Burial of their members with proper respect is known to have been one of the functions of certain clubs of aliens in Attica (IG II2 1975, 1977), and there is no reason to think that others did not possess it also (cf. Poland, 506). (15) A third non-heroic cult with an association of worship- pers distinguished by the name of orgeones is that of Dionysos (hence called Dionysiastai) known to us by three of its decrees, two preserved intact (IG II2 1325 11. 1-33, 185/84 B.c.; IG 112 1326, 176/75 B.c.), the other badly mutilated (IG II2 1325 11. 34-39); also by a poem (IG I 2 9948). These records carry the history of the association over three generations of the family which founded it. The association adopted the practice of heroizing its priest, who held office for life, at the time of his death, and of setting up his statue beside that of Dionysos.16 The priesthood was hereditary in the family of the founder. The office devolved on the oldest living son of the deceased priest, but his succession had to be approved by the orgeones in plenary assembly. The conjunction of the two forms, hereditary succession and orgeonic approbation, is intelligible if the association had the power to elect its priest should there be no eligible eldest son or should the eldest son be a minor. 56 Cf. Foucart, Le culte des Heros, 125 f. The heroizing of the first priest of the association, Agathokles, was the work of Dionysios, his son and successor. Perhaps Dionysios had in mind the action taken two hundred years earlier by the orgeones of Amynos when they heroized as Dexion their lifelong priest Sophocles. Foucart writes: "Pour leurs membres, c'est-"-dire pour une vingtaine de personnes, Sophocles et Dionysios etaient des HWros; pour les autres Ath6niens, leur condi- tion, apres leur fin, n'etait en rien superieure a celle de tous les mortels."</page><page sequence="60">116 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Their avowed purpose in heroizing their dead priest was (to quote their own words) "that there should be a memorial of him, and that the fairest, for all time" ('lva ,7Tr-cpXEL KaXX'LTTO' bv7rb6/v?7/a avTrov Els Tri iravra Xpbvov). A hero figured in mar- ble in a shrine possessed an immortality of remembrance. The shrine was not a heroon of the priestly family. Agathokles and Dionysios, like Sophocles, belonged to the class of Athe- nians who had -ipla of their own (cf. Arist. Ath. Pol. 55. 3), and they were doubtless buried in Marathon. After the death of Agathokles I, at some time prior to 185/84 B.C., Dionysios, his son, upon succeeding to his inheritance and the priesthood,57 presented the association with a place of meeting, built the temple of Dionysos, equipped it with ves- sels of gold and silver and the other articles needed for the sacrifices, had the image of Dionysos made (at a cost of 500 drachmas) and set beside it the statue of his father whom the association had just heroized. He also endowed the associa- tion with a fund of 1000 drachmas to the proceeds of which the cost of the monthly sacrifices was chargeable (IG II2 13Z6, 2948). This may have bought him, not a life membership merely, but, an eternal membership in the society (cf. Cumont, AJA, 1933, 237). A poem inscribed on a marble tablet some- where in the premises has outlasted the heroized image in which such high hopes were placed. Translated freely into English verse by John Finley, it discloses the thoughts of Dionysios when giving the god's "company" (Olaaos) its endowment: Shrine, precinct, images and all within Did Dionysius dedicate to thee, Esteeming wealth less worthy than to win A name for ritual propriety. Wherefore, O Bacchus, save him and his kin And save in kindness all thy company. How long the association had existed before it received its ma- terial equipment we do not know; but it may well be that 57 His treasurership extending over several years probably antedated his priesthood. It may be conjectured that Solon of Cholargos, honored in the muti- lated decree, IG II2 1325 11. 34 ff., was his successor, having been appointed when Dionysios became priest, or possibly later. In that case he was succeeded by Agathokles II on the death of Dionysios.</page><page sequence="61">THE ATTIC ORGEONES 117 Agathokles I was its first life-long priest. In 185/84 B.c. the association had fifteen members. The law of the association was that a member's oldest son might share his father's place before his death and that, should be predecease his father, he in turn might be replaced by his oldest brother. Normally, however, the eldest son did not succeed his father while his father lived.58 The orgeones of Dionysos were thus a small closed corporation, in which the preponderance of one family -- that of the founder - was established in perpetuity. Besides the priest the association had only one other officer, the treas- urer, who was, it seems, regularly reappointed for year after year, and might on occasion combine the priesthood with this charge (IG II2 1326, 11. 37 f.). A group of some fifteen men did not need further organization. It assembled monthly for sacrifices, paid for, in part at least, out of the endowment, and held annual meetings for business purposes in Posideon, the month of the rural Dionysia. This association, which called itself the Dionysiastai, was a small club of prosperous citizens, resident in the Piraeus, but not members of the Piraeic deme. They lacked political, religious, and social affiliations of a corporate character in the deme in which they resided. One of their number in 185/84 B.c., Simon of Poros (IG II2 1325), was at the same time a leader of the orgeones of the Mother of the Gods (epimeletes IG II2 1397, orator IG II2 1328). This is not surprising. In the second century B.C. Athenians belonged even to more than one genos (Ferguson, Hesperia, VII, 1938, 50 ff.; Meritt, Hesperia, IX, 91 ff.). In the case of Simon we do not need to resort to the idea of consanguinity on his mother's side with one association and on his father's side with another to explain his dual membership. The explanation is much simpler. He or his father or grandfather was undoubtedly of a family which had belonged for some time to the orgeones of the Mother of the Gods and had associated himself with the Agathokles- 58 The only son listed in the roll for 185/84 is Agathocles II. If we had the roll for ten years later Agathocles II and Dionysios II might very well have been the only father-son combination entered in it. The succession inter vivos was in fact limited to the family of the founder of the association.</page><page sequence="62">118 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Dionysios family of Marathon in forming the new, much more exclusive, association of orgeones of Dionysos. Agathokles I seems to have come naturally to an interest in Dionysos, since this god was especially at home in the Marathonian tetrapolis, the region from which he or his antecedents had migrated to the Piraeus. Doubtless the other charter members of the Dionysiastai were not averse to a cult of the god of wine, ecstasy, and release from cares (B. I. Wheeler, Dionysos and Immortality, 40 if.); but I believe that what they formed was primarily a social club. In calling themselves orgeones they were actuated perhaps by snobbishness - the name had an ancient flavor of respectability -, perhaps by a desire to em- phasize the citizenship of the members and the reservation of membership to sons, even in their case to the exclusion of "second" sons. This association has some features in common with the old Attic orgeones of heroes: it was small, simply or- ganized, and single-minded. The heroizing of its founder and priest links it, through unknown intermediaries perhaps, with the orgeones of Amynos, Asklepios, and Dexion, who had heroized Sophocles. Dionysios too was a poet, if he did not get someone else to write IG II2 2948 for him. But in other respects it differs sharply from them: it was new, dynastically constituted, and more plutocratic. It lacked a hestiator. Though it held a business meeting once a year its reunions were monthly, not annual, and they were obviously not family af- fairs. There was no place in them for women and children - no indication that these orgeones held family picnics. There were practically as many families as there were individuals in the association, with no demonstrable interlockings by mar- riage. The fifteen members came from twelve distinct demes. Their bond was not one of kin but of neighborhood in the Piraeus and relationships established by business and activity in public affairs. An Ahnherr, even a fictional one, is un- imaginable. Through the passage of time the orgeones may have become more closely knit together, but we know the composition of the group only when the association was new. They had sacrifices at each reunion. We are not told what the nature of these sacrifices was, but we are permitted to sur-</page><page sequence="63">THE ATTIC ORGEONES 119 mise that they consisted primarily of libations. There was a naos in their hieron but an altar is nowhere mentioned. It was not included in the furnishings given to the shrine by Dionysios. The chances are that the association met in the mansion of Agathokles I in the Piraeus until Dionysios fitted out its courtyard as a temenos, and that it had used there- tofore and continued to use thereafter the fine altar which stood in its vestibule.59 On the other hand the organization of the association was quite different from those of the orgeones (native and Thracian) of Bendis and of the Mother of the Gods; and it had none of the public or popular features of these associations. Though it has more in common with the associations of Class A than with the associations of Bendis, Cybele, and Hagne Aphrodite, I have put it in Class B because of the late- ness of its creation. The indications are that it was founded after 929 B.c. It attached itself to an ancient institution which, however, it adapted to its own needs. (16) A fourth non-heroic cult with an association of worshippers distin- guished by the name of orgeones is that of the Syrian Goddess, who was es- tablished in Athens and Athenian Delos, as Hagne Aphrodite. One record alone of this association has reached us, IG II2 1337 (97/96 B.c. found in the Piraeus). The business meeting of this association was held in the month of Skirophorion, not in the month of Munychion, as was the case with the orgeones who in IG II2 1315 and 1329 are said to have offered sacrifices to "the Goddesses," that is to say, on the theory of Foucart (already rejected), to the Syrian Aphrodite and the Mother of the Gods, combined, it is alleged, in a common cult. In the third and second centuries B.C. the Syrian Goddess was far too distinctive a divine personality to be served in a single orgeonic cult with the Mother of the Gods from Pessinus. She carried with her from Hierapolis to Delos and Athens rites and connotations peculiarly her own.60 59 The foundations of the house of Dionysios have been unearthed close by the temenos of Dionysos, which, in fact, seems to have been the courtyard of the building. For their identification see Koehler, Ath. Mitt. 1884, 296 ff. They in- dicate that he had quite a spacious residence. In its vestibule there was a good big altar (Doerpfeld, Ath. Mitt. 1884, 282 and plates XIII and XIV). 60 Cf. Laidlaw, A History of Delos, 225 f. If, as Ed. Meyer maintains (Gesch. d. Alt.2 I 9, pp. 650 ff.), the Syrian Goddess (Atargatis) is die Gattin die durch den Attisdienst charakterisiert ist, i.e. the Mother of the Gods, who, he argues, was carried from Anatolia to Hierapolis in the days of the Hittite Empire, the thousand years of their separate history since then had sufficed to destroy all con- sciousness of their original identity. Both submitted to the processes of conver-</page><page sequence="64">120 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW In Delos she was first given public recognition and a public priest between 122 and 118 B.C.06 Her acceptance in the metropolis doubtless synchronized with her establishment on the island. The formation of a private association of Athenian orgeones may have anticipated her public recognition, but it is improbable that it antedated the first setting up of the private cult with a Hierapolitan priest (six of whose names are known)"2 in Delos in 128/27 B.c. (Inscr. d. Delos, 2226). The orgeones of Hagne Aphrodite are thus, so far as founding goes, the latest association of this type to be considered in this article.63 The most striking innovation of this association is that, while its members were apparently citizens, the priestess, invariably selected in earlier associa- tions, usually by lot, from the womenfolk of the members, was a foreigner, in 97/96 B.c. a certain Nikasis, daughter of Philiskos, of Corinth. Like the Egyptian whom the temple administrator at Priene was required by law to provide so that the sacrifice to Isis should be performed " in an expert way,"'4 gence active in Hellenistic thought but retained their essential peculiarities of personality and cult. Cf. Nock, AJP, 1942, 223 f. 61 Roussel, Delos, 256 ff.; Athenian Tribal Cycles, 162 ff. 62 Sarapis at Delos had much the same career, cf. Roussel, Les cultes egyp- tiens A Ddlos, 71 ff.; Nock, Conversion, 50 ff. Dow (HTR 1937 198 ff.) shows that Athens had a public priest of Sarapis before 166 B.c. (IG II2 4692). 63 The orgeonai of Belela, known to us from a record of the early third century A.D. (IG II2 2361), are an altogether different association from any thus far con- sidered. Hesychius equates 6p-yW'vac with lipecac, but our orgeonai are males and the priestesses of their cult are listed separately. It is obviously a neo-Attic creation which has little historical continuity with the ancient institution whose name, slightly modified in form, it adopted. In addition to Belela it served the three associated goddesses, Oraia (Mother of the Gods), Aphrodite, and Dea Syria. Its members numbered 18. Orgeonai seems to be a collective title for a group of sacred officiants like orgeones in the Hymn to Apollo, 389. The name may in fact be a poetic rem- iniscence. Their full title was orgeonai and ankonophoroi (vase-bearers). Probably IG 112 1351 belongs to this society. " Hiller von Gartringen, Inschriften von Priene, 138, No. 195; cf. Nock, Con- version, 55, Graillot, Le culte de Cybele, 74, Plut. Nicias, 13, 4, Tac. Annals, 1I 54. We do not know where Philiskos, the father of Nikasis, lived. Just as there were Olynthioi after 348 (AJA 1935, 155) and Delioi after 166 (Roussel et Launey, Inscr. de Delos, 1700 and notes), so there were, it seems, Korinthioi after 146 B.C. It may be that he had his home in Attica itself. IG II2 Part III Fasc. 2, when it becomes available, may enable us to say whether Corinthians died there between 146 and 44 B.c. (cf. John Day, Econ. Hist. of Athens under Roman Domination, 79 ff., 213). There was no Corinthian among the foreign ephebes known to have been enrolled in the Athenian corps between 119/18 and 39/38 B.c. (0. W. Rein- muth, The Foreigners in the Athenian Ephebia, 21 ff.). During this interval, for all we know, Corinthians may have lived in Korinthia, attached to local cults, of which one of Aphrodite was famous (PW I 2740 f.). Others must have been living in foreign cities (Delos, for example, cf. Roussel, D0los col. Athen. 85) when Corinth was sacked, or survived the catastrophe by escaping abroad (PWK XVI 1197, CAH VIII 304, 644). The probability is that these, whether living in</page><page sequence="65">THE ATTIC ORGEONES 121 she was, I imagine, chosen because of her professional competence, and held an appointment without limit of time. For a similar reason, their scientia peregrina et externa, the priestesses of Ceres in Rome were imported, ordi- narily from Naples or Velia (Cicero, Pro Balbo, 55). It is, however, possible that in an association of orgeones founded as late as 122/18 B.c. aliens were enrolled as members. At this time the social system of Athens disintegrated: citizens intermarried with foreigners, foreigners were enrolled in the ephebe corps, the genA were no longer mutually exclusive, citizens and aliens con- sorted freely as eranistai (IG JI2 1335, 2358), and the ancient stock of family names was badly corrupted (Ferguson, Hell. Ath. 492 ff., Dow, HTR 1937, 216 ff. Day, Economic History of Athens under Roman Domination, 76 f.). The example set by the orgeones of the Mother of the Gods may have worked on the orgeones of Hagne Aphrodite: it was not difficult to advance from the epimeleia of Ergasion to the priesthood of Nikasis. In the decree which has reached us Nikasis was honored by the society on the occasion of a report presented to it by her regarding the sacrifices which she had offered on its behalf "to Aphrodite the Syrian and the other gods ols 7ra?7Tpov v." Among these other gods was undoubtedly Hadad, her consort at her home in Bam- byke (Hierapolis) in Syria. IV. We have only two orgeonic decrees enacted after ca. 130 B.c. (Nos. (14) and (16). For IG II2 1351 see above n. 63) - both by associations in Class B. Apart from official records preserved on stone the only sources for the history of the orgeones are the lexicographical definitions of the name, the ancient laws, casual references in the classical literature, and the datable ex-votos found in the shrines. Of these the ex-votos alone are of serv- ice for the period following 130 B.c. Only two hiera of or- geones have been excavated, the Amyneion on the west slope of the Acropolis (Class A) and the Metroon in the Piraeus (Class B), the former by competent archaeologists, the latter in 1855 by a detachment of soldiers. The Amyneion has yielded an inscribed votive offering made as late as 130 B.C., not by the orgeones, but by a private individual (IG II2 4457). The shrine was, however, in use in Roman times (Koerte, Ath. Mitt. 1893, 233, 244; 1896, 292, 309), for anything we know, by the orgeones. The inscribed ex-votos from the Metroon in the Piraeus are listed in note 52; they prove the existence of the orgeones as late as 163/64 A.D. The association prob- ably endured to the end of paganism. Two of the other as- Athens or elsewhere, retained their ethnika even though their polis was non- existent. Nikasis may have learned the technique of her job at Delos.</page><page sequence="66">122 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW sociations in Class A appear, the one (No. 1) after an interval of nearly 200 and the other (No. 10) after an interval of about 50 years; the rest (omitting the orgeones of Amynos, Asklepios, and Dexion (No. 7)) appear only once in our records. Long disappearances and single appearances are inevitable, and, in themselves, of no significance, in a record so defective and sub- ject to chance as ours is. Even though they were small, as- sociations which were self-perpetuating, and sustained by endowments which belonged, not to them, but to the heroes and gods whom they worshipped and consequently were in- alienable, had a high survival value, especially since the feel- ings and ideas which they embodied, being undefined dog- matically, could renew their strength by changing with the times. All that we can say as to the end of the orgeones is that, with the exception of those of the Mother of the Gods, they drop out of our sight in Roman times. V. The establishment of orgeones of the Class B type added new associations to those already existing; but it is probable that in the fourth, third and second centuries B.C. the type represented by Class A preponderated throughout Attica. With two exceptions (Nos. 8 and 9) the stones with records of the old Attic orgeones have been found here and there in Athens or its environs; but we must not conclude from their provenience that these associations were primarily a phe- nomenon of urban or suburban life. They do not figure in the reliquiae of Attic comedy or in the Characters of Theophrastus. Aristophanes had other fish to fry and Menander depicted a society to which they did not ordinarily belong. They were too normal and old (without being bizarre) to attract the at- tention of the comedians. Theophrastos suited himself in selecting the illustrations of his Types and it just happens that he fails to mention either gennetai or orgeones. The chances are that most of the old Attic orgeones with their Hosts and their decorous sacrifices and feasts had their precincts in the demes (Pollux, 8 107), and either published no records 65 or inscribed 65 The "ancient decrees" of the new inscription from the Areopagus were ap- parently left unpublished between ca. 450 and ca. 275 B.c.</page><page sequence="67">THE ATTIC ORGEONES 123 them on stones which have perished. Attica was alive with heroes and heroines, many of them nameless (cf. IG II2 1195, 1356, 1358; Hesperia, VII, 1938, 1 ff.), others with sufficient personality to be given eventually a name (cf. above, p. 74, n. 15). With what ideas or feelings in mind did the Athenian burgh- ers with their wives, children and female attendants assemble in their precincts to sacrifice and feast? The purposes by which their forebears were actuated in founding the associations in the first place is one thing, and they must be sought in the con- ditions of pre-Solonian times; the motives of those participat- ing in the reunions in classical and post-classical times is another thing. They are disclosed to us only in the name of the official (hestiator) by which they were headed.66 The hestiasis was the name-giving function of the association, so far at least as its administration was concerned. The sacrifices were offered to the heroes or heroines or to "the god" or "goddess" (in reality apotheosized heroes or heroines) on behalf of the orgeones and their families, and endowments and contributions (IG II2 1252 1. 11) had to be available to provide the sacrificial animals; but the picnic, the barbecue, was probably the main attraction. The prayers which accompanied the sacrifices were directed to the deity or deities and they may have been quite general, a supplication that 7t wrp6s rob~s pw&amp;as or 6Eob' might be KaXw S Kal wac/iJ&lt;s for the orgeones. The passage from Isaeus (II 14) quoted above (p. 70) shows that the orgeones possessed a roll of their members. This, of course, had to be kept up to date by the omission of the dead and the addition of the KYOZOLo (IG II2 1361). Isaeus' client was an adult at the time of his enrollment, but since he was an adopted son his legal father could not present him to his orgeones until he had adopted him. In the "ancient decree" the sons of orgeones, though they participated in the feast, 66 Athenaeus (V, 185e, Gulick, Loeb Classics, II 320; cf. above, p. 71, n. 12), in speaking of the "so-called orgeonic beZirva," defines the function of the orgeones no more than he defines that of the phylae in speaking of the VXEdTLKh betrva. Athenaeus, a native of Naukratis, undoubtedly knew of these feasts, not from personal knowledge, but from the sources which he used. We have, therefore, no reason to conclude from his text that they survived at ca. 200 A.D,</page><page sequence="68">124 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW were not yet orgeones. Hence it is probable that sons were enrolled only when they came of age. If registration were per- missible to others than sons, the citation by the orator of his client's admission to the society would have had no evidential value. It meant for the orator and the jurors a recognition of his filial relation to the orgeon by whom he was proposed for membership. The admission of members to some of the associations of Class B was, or was later put, on a different basis. It is known, for example, that the citizen orgeones of Bendis, some time in the second half of the fourth century, opened their doors to any (citizen) who wished to assume the obligations of their association; but this was done relatively late and was obviously a departure, motivated by the public duty which this society performed (above, p. 103). In Class B other departures were probably not uncommon. The orgeones of the Mother of the Gods, for example, admitted a limited number of aliens at the time of their organization, while the Dionysiastai moved in the other direction and gave certain priorities of admissions to the oldest son alone (above, p. 117). What the orgeones of Bendis and the Mother of the Gods did once they could, of course, do again. Whether or not they did so we do not know. As to the raison d'etre of the original associations the latest summary expression of opinion which I have seen is that given by Ziebarth in PWK s.v. 6pyewves. It runs as follows: "Ihre Aufgabe ist der gemeinsame Kult eines Gottes oder auch eines Heros durch Besorgung der voyte6geva, so Bruck Totenteil 234. Sie sind nicht Geschlechtsgenossen mit eponymen Ahnherren, sondern ersetzen ihren Genossen die fehlende Geschlechts- gemeinschaft durch den Heros, z. B.

Wie der Sippenkult Zusammenhang und Macht der Geschlechter ausdriickt, so schliessen sich auf ihnliche Weise Leute ohne Geschlechter, kleine Leute oder Fremde zu Orgeonenverbainden zusammen, die nach Brucks ueberzeugenden Ausfiihrungen oft den fehlenden Sippenkult ersetzen .... Was das Geschlecht seinen Mitgliedern bietet, z. B. Bestattungsgeld, Totenpflege, Hilfe bei der Adoption, das leisten auch die Orgeonen fiir ihre</page><page sequence="69">THE ATTIC ORGEONES 125 Mitglieder (Bruck 237 ff.). - - Der Unterschied zwischen den Vereinen der 6pTE~vs, der 6oaairac und der ipapto-ral ver- schwindet spaiter viillig." There is much in this summarization which provokes com- ment. First as to vo/LO6/Eva: Harpocration assigns to O6pYLtarE two meanings, "to sacrifice" and "perform customary rites." Suidas equates it with ra c ?Tv OWev 6ppyta rEXEi^, adding that 6pyta means tvari'pta Kai V6IhLa. The words 6pytLd6Etv and 6pyta do not appear in the records of the orgeones (cf. be- low, Appendix 1). "Customary rites" are commonly rites of burial, "all that custom requires after the funeral" (6aa volujtErat ET r 7T7V EKjopdv. Diog. Laert. V 61); but, as pointed out above (p. 62, n. 3), they are also more comprehensively rites which are appropriate to any cultus, and such they must be when associated by the lexicographers with 6p-ytaet-w, and what is more important for this study, such they were in the only instance in which the term employed by Suidas as a synonym for vo~Ati6Eva is used in the orgeonic records. N6tA1La in IG II2 2948 means simply "Bacchic rites." Neither in the official records of the associations nor elsewhere do we find any- thing to suggest that the orgeones collectively acted for or with the next of kin (7rpo1KOVes, cff. [Demosth.], XLIII 58) in render- ing obsequies to the dead, and their possession of Bestat- tungsgeld is demonstrable only in one instance in Class B - a decree of the orgeones of the Mother of the Gods (IG II2 1327, 178/77 B.C.; cf. above, p. 115). This is an inadequate basis for generalizing. It is certainly risky to transfer to the old Attic or- geones of heroes data attested only for an association organized to carry on in Attica the worship of a goddess so alien in cult- practices as Cybele. The possession of a "burial fund" has, moreover, no implications for a cult of the dead. There is no ref- erence to Totenpflege in any of our records unless it be in the hesitant item appended by Harpocration (repeated by Suidas) to his definition of orgeones (above, p. 63). The lexicographer suggests that the word orgeones was possibly used later (i.e., sub- sequent to the date of the classical text in which he had found orgeones mentioned) to designate associations formed to do honor to the dead (-i TL rtA rc wv wTroOaivProw), "as," he says, "is</page><page sequence="70">126 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW to be seen from the last will and testament of Theophrastos." His knowledge of Theophrastos' will was apparently defective. We have this document (Diog. Laert., V, 51 ff.). In it Theo- phrastos designated ten men to live as a community of phi- losophers attached to the hieron of the Muses in which the school of Aristotle had its sacral headquarters, but he did not designate its members as orgeones. He lists them individ- ually, calls them his friends and joint holders of the property, but gives them no collective title. They were undoubtedly thiasotai in fact if not in name (cf. Wilamowitz, Ant. von Karystos, 263 ff.). It is the clear implication of the definition reaching us through Harpocration (and Suidas) that the orgeones of the text in which the word was found were not an association in honor of the dead: they were something differ- ent, "worshippers of gods and heroes." The possibility is simply raised, on inadequate evidence, that associates joined together to do honor to the dead were so named in later times. Returning to Ziebarth's summarization, I should like to query whether, even if we should concede that an Amynos, or an Egretes or a Hypodektes could be regarded as an Ahnherr of orgeones, we can possibly regard "the Heroines" of Hesperia, XI, 289, no. 55 as capable of playing such a r8le (cf. Latte, Gnomon, 1927, 42: Latte denies that the orgeones were Sip- penersatz). Yet "the Heroines" were the sole objects of the cult of one of the two associated KOLV1 Of orgeones of this record. With this query and the larger question which it raises, Does the cult of heroes and of heroines inherently involve a cult of the dead? I turn the investigation over to Professor Nock. But before doing so I venture to challenge two further statements of Ziebarth. He alludes to the orgeones as "Leute ohne Geschlechter, kleine Leute oder Fremde." Certainly they were not gennetai. They were much too closely knit together by bonds of real kinship to be placed in the same category with, or to be conceived as imitations of, "the so-called gene," which might be so large and were so lacking in ties of blood that it is only in the case of their leading families (o1KOL), when they had any (cf. Hesperia, VII 43 f.), that they possessed anything (apart from cultus) in common with orgeones (cf. above, n. 37).</page><page sequence="71">THE ATTIC ORGEONES 127 In Athens the Ahnherr seems to belong to the associations (gene, phylae) in which the kinship of the members with one another was fictional rather than real. I hope that I have shown that the old Attic orgeones were not "kleine Leute" in the sense that thetes were; nor were they aliens. If I were to classify them in Solonian terms I should call them zeugitai. Ziebarth affirms that "the distinction between orgeones, thiasotai and eranistai disappeared later wholly." I am con- vinced that, despite the anomaly presented by the Thracians and the transaction by which the association of the Mother of the Gods absorbed an enclave of aliens, the name orgeones re- tained a tone of its own until at least 130 B.C. Far from prov- ing the identity of thiasotai and orgeones, the records of the Metroon in the Piraeus, when properly interpreted (cf. Ap- pendix 4), indicate that the distinctiveness of the two names was recognized. It is easier to say what the old Attic orgeones were not, and to define their social and economic status, than to determine what they were originally. But let me say what this study has led me to think. In the second article of this pair Nock will urge that the heroes and heroines were not all of one type, that some of them were dead men and women, that others were faded gods and goddesses, and that many of them were simply gods and goddesses "in a small way." The complete absence of chthonic ritual in the orgeonic records and the universal use by the orgeones of non-chthonic rites and sacrifices, while they do not exclude the idea that the heroes and heroines of these organizations were dead men and women, put the burden of proof - of which there is no vestige - on those who affirm that this is what they were. Practically all the rites used in the cult of the dead (E. Rohde, Psyche8, 149 ff.) are violated by the practices attested in case no. (1), above, 78 cf. below, 144: ObvE not iva-yl1av, Ocobs not iaXa'pa, victims of any color not black-skinned animals, sacrifice by daylight not after dark, eating of flesh of offerings not holocaust, and worship in a common hieron not at the place of alleged burial. There can be no doubt that the Hero (Echelos) and the Heroines were worshipped by the orgeones with the rites of Olympians and</page><page sequence="72">128 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW that these rites date back to ancient times; but the rites of sacrifice do not disclose infallibly the character of their object. In view of the evidence collected and assessed by Nock (below, 147 f.) we can only say that, if these heroic persons were not akin to the Olympians in nature, their cult resisted with complete success the normative processes which tended to give to Toten- kult its special ritual of sacrifice. A positive index that the hero Egretes was not thought of as a dead person may be found in the fact that his chapel (lp6v) was situated in the dwelling house in which the tenant of the orgeones in 306/05 B.C. pre- sumably lived (above, 80). There is not the slightest intimation that Echelos, Egretes, Amynos, and Hypodektes were ever great deities who had fallen by neglect to their lowly state. It remains for us to classify them and their like as small deities, each attached to a definite spot (which need not be always the place of worship, above, p. 79), and thought by persons living near-by to have supernatural powers for good or evil which these persons should control by suitable sacrifices (below, 162 ff.). There is no evidence that these persons, who organized themselves on an exclusive basis as "sacrificing associates" (orgeones) to ensure the regu- larity and continuity of these sacrifices, ever thought that they were the offspring of the heroes or heroines in question. Those of them who were nameless and known simply as the Hero or the Heroines, as was the case with the objects of orgeonic cult in our "ancient decree," can hardly have been thought of as capable of parenthood. With the lapse of time belief in the potency for good or evil of these little deities may have waned and the heroes and heroines become essentially symbols; but nonetheless the sacrifice went on, sustained by tradition, so powerful in all religious matters, and by the corporate life which developed among the "sacrificing associates " themselves. Marriage in Athens was always a matter of family arrangement and based on the acquaintance of families one with another. Propinquity was an efficacious coadjutor of Hymen. The families constituting the typical association of orgeones were ordinarily neighbors and necessarily intimate with one another. Membership being hereditary, the members came in time to</page><page sequence="73">THE ATTIC ORGEONES 129 take on the aspect of one large family, and the names used by the individual families came to assume a family aspect. There must have been something deliberate about name-giving to account for the homonymity displayed by the orgeones of No. (8) above. The annual reunion of orgeones was thus in a sense a family party. Since the group was small, the kinship real, and the people just normal simple folk they did not bother about a pedigree or the fiction of a common ancestor (cf. Busolt, Griech. Staatskunde, I 252, 525). The leading men of the group of families took turns in acting as hosts on the oc- casion of reunions, and their name, Hosts (hestiatores), and their acceptance as heads of the association for the year, are prima facie evidence that the feasts (hestiaseis) which accom- panied the sacrifices (thysiai) were, early and late, an essential part of the ceremonies. The Hero or Heroine doubtless got his share of the victims - this was presumably burned on the altar - but the main portion of the flesh went to the orgeones and their sons and womenfolk - this was roasted and eaten in the precinct. A holocaust, the most characteristic practice of a chthonic cult, was unthinkable and unheard of. The precinct was naturally equipped to enable the hestiator to do his job and the orgeones to have their feast as conveniently and comfortably as circumstances permitted. In the age that lay back of Solon, an age of piety and of the dominance of the idea that every permanent association, private and public, was based on kin, the organization of orgeones among the middle- class farmers of Attica was natural, not necessarily imitative, and was carried out widely in town and village; for, as has been said already, Attica was alive with the little deities whom it was their function to cultivate. An injunction, traced back doubtfully to Draco (Porphyr. de abstin. 4, 02), laid upon the Athenians the duty of "worshipping publicly the gods and the heroes that dwelt in the land, according to the custom of their fathers." Upon the orgeones, small self-perpetuating groups of neighbors and kinsmen, privately organized and supported, devolved the task of maintaining good relations with the mul- titude of Attic heroes and heroines whose supernatural activity was locally limited and hence did not concern the people as a</page><page sequence="74">130 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW whole. The state might concern itself with a Theseus, but lesser heroic personalities were left to them and to the larger more aristocratic societies of gennetae and to local territorial organizations like the Marathonian Tetrapolis. These however practised not only their cult but also that of major deities. The orgeones were more single-minded in their devotions. To end with a further negative: there was nothing Dionysias- tic or orgiastic about the religious or social practices of the old Attic orgeones. The religions sponsored by the new orgeones, notably those of the Mother of the Gods, evoked protests in Athens on the stage and elsewhere because of their incitations to emotional outbursts and superstitious crudities; but it may be that the orgeones checked and regulated these rather than promoted them (cf. above p. 111). The sodales of the civic cult of Magna Mater in Rome were members of the governing society. Cato the Elder was one of their number (Cic. de senect. XII1 45). Athens had no governing society and the state had nothing to do with her private association of cultores of the Mother of the Gods. But the Athenian orgeones and the Roman sodales had more in common than Graillot (Le culte de Cybele, 90) was aware of when he wrote "Les sodalities nobles ne risquaient pas de degenerer en orgeons."</page><page sequence="75">APPENDIX 1 THE ETYMOLOGY OF THE WORD bpyeijve AND ITS USE BY HOMER, AESCHYLUS, AND OTHER POETS The lexicographers connect the word bpyeW^Ps with 6pyta and 6pytdl~Lr and interpret it in the light of the meanings of these words: ITrjpta is exegesis of 6pyta. These interpretations may repeat ac- curately enough what Greeks of later times thought; but in their own records the orgeones always speak of Ovalta and ObEL, never of 6pyta and bpYtLadeLv. The latter pair of words seems to me to have been brought into the picture by folk-etymologizing because of their homonymity with bpyeWeves. We cannot depend upon guesses of this sort for the significance of the word p'yeves (*bpyets; cf. above, p. 82) in the centuries lying back of Solon. Harpocration and Suidas, in fact, record other guesses. Otto Hoffmann (Mitt. der Schles. Gesell- schaft fur Volkskunde, 13/14 Breslau, 1911, 187), cited by E. F. Bruck (Totenteil und Seelgeratt im griechischen Recht, 937, n. 2), dissociates the word wholly from 6pyta and 6bp-ytieLv (which are probably cognate with 'Ep'w), and derives it, by way of 6pya'w and 6py a, from Epyc (enclose), thus enabling him to assign to 6pyrzWes the primitive meaning of members of a Verband or union. We could come thus to the idea that orgeones were so named because they were closed groups. The lexicographers report that the poets used the word with the meaning "priest" (epebs) simply, noting as examples Aesch. frg. 144 (HIoraCod KatKov XacZpe rpwros bp'yeov, Ebxals be awoots .oEaroro s sratwvlas), and Antimachos, Lyde, fig. 67, ed. Wyss, (Kag3prvovs OjKEpv &amp;LyaKXias 6pryew.vas). We can add two further examples: Hom. Hymn to Apollo, 389 (Kal rbmre 6 Kart aUOvjo?v pdaiero 4?oigos 'AArbXXwC OiX6s rwas vAp.P.rovs 6pylovas Elaay'ydotro, O~ Oepareaovrat IIvOo tvt, lrErp iofay), and Her- mesianax, Leontion, line 19 - in the stanza placing Antiope-Deiope and Mousaios in an Eleusinian setting as in the fifth century vase painting published by Richter, AJA, 1939, 1 ff. In this line a corruption of the text occurs (the Mss. have Phptov opytwvavet,&amp;otarotrrwtovoa A/ArlTpa) which makes any restoration uncertain. Hermann restores bpyenwt v jPcy, taking the word as an adjective with the meaning sacerdotal (cf. Gulick, Athen. XIII 597d, Loeb Classics, VI 220, n. a). In the Hymn to Apollo (see for the form above, 83) and the Lyde of Antimachos the word is a collective nontechnical plural and it is in this same sense that it was used by Aelian in his.

The cultores sacri at Delphi and Eleusis are well known by name. In Paros the officials were called Kabarnoi (IG XII 5 292). Hesychius encountered somewhere (cf. n. 63) the form 6bpEWovat - a collective feminine plural perhaps - and ascribed to it the meaning Uipetac. There is no evidence in any of these texts for an individualized priest called an orgeon. Is this usage demon- strated by the Aeschylean text? I think not. The word is commonly accented 6py'cWv and taken as a singular. It may now (above, 82) be accented bpy'wv and taken as a genitive plural. The rp&amp;ros, with- out a further context, is ambiguous. It might mean "first" orgeon as rpWTos a pxwv in Athens means first archon; or it might mean "first" of the orgeis-orgeones, as in the phrase 7rpwTos T7s 7brEws it means first man of the state. So taken it would imply a group and 7p&amp;wros 6pyerv, bpyEiwv would stand to this group in the relation in which hestiator stands to the Athenian orgeones with whom Aeschylus was of course familiar. It is only when rp&amp;wTos is taken to mean "earliest," as is equally possible in a tragedy, i.e. the first of the series of successive annual or lifelong orgeones, that it would compel us to translate orgeon as priest irX. In that event the etymology of bpy^ev pro- posed by Otto Hoffmann would be inappropriate. Professor Whatmough has very kindly allowed me to quote from a letter written to me at my request as follows: "As to the etymology the evidence is only presumptive. The epigraphic usage, as you say, lends no weight to the traditional, generally accepted, derivation from the same root as 6prLa. Hence Otto Hoffmann's suggestion holds the field, being at least possible; but only a context in which the required meaning (on that etymology) is certain and clear would be decisive enough to be convincing." In these circumstances it is prudent not to attach any etymological significance to the term orgeones, but to derive its notion of exclu- siveness from the well-established heredity of membership in the as- sociations which it primarily denotes, and from the reservation of orgeonic activities to the members enrolled at any given time. If their name were derived from the same root as 6pyta they would be simply rite-performing associates. "Opya, of course, are intrinsically not orgies, but "acts religiously done."</page><page sequence="77">APPENDIX 2 THE THIASOS OF THE ETIONIDAI Lately in a mid-fifth century B.C. inscription from the base of an altar set up by it in the vicinity of the Piraeus 6 B6tdos ['Er]tovt6Ov has come to light (Palaios, Polemon, I, 1929, 107 ft.; cf. Guarducci, Riv. di Fil. 1935, 337 ff. and Mem. Accad. d. Lincei, Cl. di Sc. Mor., vol. VI, Serie VI, 45, 52, 90). Guarducci concludes from the patronymic that the Etionidai were one of "the so-called gene," and goes on to argue that the thiasos, one of the units of a phratry, consisted of the gennetai in the phratry in question who belonged to the genos of the Etionidai. I find this argument difficult to accept. The members of a thiasos of a phratry were those who knew a man's family best, i.e. his closest of kin (IG II2 1237, 11. 68 ff., 2344): it is doubtful whether these were to be found among his fellow gennetai (cf. n. 37). The seg- regation in a phratry of the gennetai of a particular genos, assuming it to be possible, seems irreconcilable with gentile interests. It was in- evitable for the gennetai to be fractionalized by their dispersion among the Kleisthenian phylae and phratries; why increase yet further gen- tile disunity by, so to speak, incorporating the fractions? It is to be observed that most of the names of phratries known to us are patro- nymics (Class. Stud. Capps, 154; Guarducci, Mem. Accad. d. Lincei, 8). An alternative explanation, therefore, is that the Etionidai were a phratry and the thiasos one of its ordinary subdivisions. It is true that the inscriptions thus far known designate these thiasoi as 'AyvoOio Olaaos, 'AvnTdvYOs Oiaoo, Atoybros Olaoos, ,)X. (IG II2 2345), or even more informally as phrateres ot eETa T70v - tva (IG II2 2723; in The- ophr. Char. XXX 16 6 "erva is seemingly called 6 Xepiwco), or as phrateres simply (IG II2 92344); but the departure from the normal is the same whether the Etionidai were a genos or a phratry, since in either case the thiasos is taken to be a thiasos of a phratry. Why, then, should it call itself a thiasos of gennetai? In the records of the poletai (Hesperia, X 14 ff., cf. above p. 83) the KOLCVb /paTrEpwv MEovTLiC^'O was the phratry as a whole, of which the name was Medontidai (id. p. 21). What tells against this alternative explanation is the article 6. This indicates that the thiasos was not one of many thiasoi but a unique association, the Thiasos of the Etionidai. Is there yet a third explanation? However the thiasos was manned it could not be called a thiasos of Herakles and remain a unit of a phratry. The deities of phratries were of course Zeus Phratrios and Athena Phratria. Herakles has no</page><page sequence="78">134 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW known connection with the phratries or the Apaturia. Yet Palaios thinks that the altar which the thiasos of the Etionidai set up was an altar of Herakles. He does this because the base came from the area in which the tetrakomia of Herakles had its centre and because he reads the final letters of line 1 as -KXEOS], which he restores as ['Epa]- KXcOS[]. Unfortunately for once Meritt does not have a squeeze. He writes, "It seems to me clear from the photograph that this, -KXEO[S], is not the reading. I should have to take the K on faith, but there is certainly a letter between the E and the 0. To judge from the spac- ing and the visible stroke, it looks to me like iota." We might there- fore restore ['Epa]CKXE O[L] or ['Epa]KX Eo; or some form of ['Epa]KXLO[W] -a proper name. Accepting Herakleion on the weight of the pro- venience of the stone we should conclude that the altar was set up in the shrine of Herakles. Without examining the stone an attempt to restore the inscription is labor lost; but what follows would make sense: [T0]'.E[TiOVL or, neglecting the ., [T6v pop v i'v ]T][~ hEpa]KXd0o[ I KaO]LIpve b Oiaocos ['E]-ovYL6v. The thiasos could be an association of men living in Etioneia, named the Etionidai, formed for the worship of Herakles, and have nothing whatsoever to do with a phratry.

The letters, when plotted on graph paper, are seen to be spaced fairly regularly throughout the entire inscription. The principle of syllabification (i.e. of ending lines with the ends of sylla- bles) is certainly violated once (line 13) and probably again in line 17. The final nu should probably be kept in line 24, according to the re- quirements of spacing. Only these three lines appear to violate the principle. The fact that no other lines do so may be due partly to ac- cident; in the second decree the ends of most of the lines crowd close to the right margin. Except as noted below, Meritt's restorations are upheld by study of the spacing. Lines 18-19. Space certainly existed at the end of line 18 for one letter more than is now restored there. This is apparent from the plotting of all the letters in relation to a vertical line drawn 21 letter- spaces from the margin next the right edge of the stone. On the other hand, the beginning of line 19, when similarly plotted, is seen to be unduly crowded. Hence the upsilon of bots should be moved from the beginning of line 19 back to the end of line 18. Line 20. There was space for the first nu of bp-y~4[vlwv] at the end of line 19, and this arrangement (the editor's) here appears to be preferable, despite the principle of syllabification. The number of letters to be restored at the beginning of line 20 depends on the de- gree of regularity of the spacing at the beginnings of lines. A line drawn 61 spaces from the left margin, with the preserved interven- ing letters plotted as accurately as possible, shows that in the first decree (lines 1-11) no line has more than 7 or less than 5? letters in the 6' spaces. In the second decree (line 12 being taken as the norm for the whole), line 17 has 61, line 13 has 6, other lines have 7 (lines 14, 18, 19, 21?, 22?); only lines 15 and 16 have 8 letters. Line 15 has three iotas, and the fact that they actually require less than one half space each accounts for the excess. Line 16 thus remains the one gross irregularity. In line 20 the editor's version has 9 letters in the space in question, all but the last of which (omicron, dotted) are restored. One of the restored letters is mu, which in this inscription (though I have counted</page><page sequence="80">136 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW it as one) actually occupies the space of about 1i letters. Hence the restoration 6pyEJ[vlwv E7T' ab-6obs can hardly be accepted. In conformity with the neighboring lines of the second decree, the number of letters in line 20 may be put down as preferably 7, i.e. bpye[v w,,.V. ...]ovs. In place of the 4 spaces left blank here, 31 (or even 3) could be admitted; or 4A (or even 5, as in line 16). In view of the regularity of the inscription as a whole, more should not be considered. Line 24. Only the second half of the line is preserved. The editor has restored the beginning identically with line 12, but it should be noted that the same letters (all preserved) in line 12 occupy three full spaces more than in line 94. This fact, taken in conjunction with the fact that the (preserved) second half of line 24 is spaced so loosely that it contains 1i letters less than the corresponding portion of line 10, raises the question whether the restoration in line 24 is correct. At present 24- letters are restored in a space where (again judging by the preserved end of the line) about 19 would be expected. Since the restoration seems to be inevitable the scribe may have omitted some letters accidentally.</page><page sequence="81">APPENDIX 4 THE RECORDS AND SHRINE OF THE ORGEONES OF THE MOTHER OF THE GODS The attribution of IG II2 1316 to this association is contestable; the attribution of the rest is assured. All have this in common that in the texts of their decrees they call, or may have called (IG II2 1301), them- selves orgeones. 1315 is linked with 1314, 1327, 1328 I, 1328 II and 1334 in that it like them belongs to an association of which the &amp;yopa Kvpta was held on an unspecified day of Munychion. It is linked with 1316 by the conjunction with the priestess of a man, in 1316 her husband, in 1315 probably her husband, who was crowned with her or by her without indication of the office he held, or that he held any office. This association of husband and priestess was probably an Atticized form of la dualite du sacerdoce oriental of which Graillot (Le culte de Cybele, 76, 251) speaks. 1316, on the other hand, was voted in Hekatombaion, at a meeting which, however, is not designated as Kvpla. Simon of Poros links 1327, in which the Metroon is mentioned, with 1328 I and II; and 1328 I is, in turn, proved to be a decree of orgeones of the Mother of the Gods by the references in it, as in 1329, to ay'Ep/ot and oTrpcaEs, rites characteristic of the cult of the goddess and her consort Attis. There is more than a good chance that IG II2 1301 (920/19 B.C.), which comes from a stone found in the Piraeus, belongs to the or- geones of the Mother of the Gods. The month of the business meeting (Munychion), the epidoseis, the epimeletai, the crown of olive, the Goddess, are all consonant with this attribution; and there is nothing which tells against it. If this is correct, the association had a cook- shop (mageireion); cf. H. Graillot, Le culte de Cybele, 506; Judeich, Topographie von Athen2, 454. The idea that two associations are concerned arose because of the following observations (Foucart, Assoc. relig. chez les Grecs, 99 ff., 198, no. 11): (1) that a dedication attributed to the Metroon in the Piraeus was addressed to Aphrodite Urania, and (2) that in IG II2 1316 the object of the sacrifices is "the goddess," as in 1314, 1328 I, 1328 II and 1334, whereas in 1315 and 1329 (which was voted on the same day as 1328 II) the object is "the goddesses" and in 1327 it is "the gods." It now appears that the dedication to Aphrodite Urania came from the shrine of the Cyprian Aphrodite (IG II2 337, 4636). I am still inclined, with Schaifer (Fleckeisen's Jahrbiicher, 1880, 420 ff., cf. Hell. Athens, 219, n. 6), to explain differently the use of</page><page sequence="82">138 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW OE6v, Beds, and OEobs in the records which did come from the Metroon (cf., on the other hand, Poland, 10 ff., 216), and to recognize neither a distinctiveness of associations nor the fusion of the cult-groups of two goddesses. The former is quite out of the question; the latter must have been temporary or occasional, if it really existed. The two bodies must have met jointly and one of them separately on the same day (1329, 1328 II). The association which is thought to have united with the orgeones of the Mother of the Gods is that of the orgeones of the Syrian Aphrodite. This was not created until half a century later; see above, 119 if. "The goddess," and "the gods" are reconcilable in view of the association of Attis with the Mother of the Gods in the cult of the Athenian orgeones - an association which is vouched for by the allusion to two Opbvot in 1328 I and by the designation of the fete which the orgeones of 1315 cele- brated as r&amp; 'ATrrl6Ea. The feminine plural Trs Oehs is more diffi- cult. It may have been used, instead of the more natural mas- culine plural, ro s Eobvs, to emphasize the predominance of the Mother of the Gods over her consort. It is also possible that in the cult-apparatus of the orgeones a naiskos with two images of the Mother of the Gods was used, as frequently in Attica, though no example, it seems, has turned up in the Piraeus, and that 7Tas O ds designated only one goddess (Graillot, 506, n. mentions only one double naiskos, but cf. H. Hepding, Der Attiskult, 138, n. 7; Usener, Rh. Mus. 58, 1903, 191 ff., 204); or that a second minor female divinity was associated with the Mother of the Gods in this cult, thus creating a divine pair like the Mother of the Gods and Parthenos (Persephone?) at Phistyon in Aetolia (IG IX2 1, 1. 96, Nock, Conversion, 59, 282; cf. Latte, Gnomon, IX, 1983, 409). It is, however, a fact that at Phistyon the Syrian Aphrodite "was worshipped in a temple which she appears to have shared with Mar~ip Tr&amp; v GEV Kal IIapOEvos." Temple- sharing does not, however, imply a single set of rites. I should like to add, for what it is worth, that in Catullus, LXIII, 6 ff. Attis be- comes feminine after emasculation. IG II2 1316 has a feature peculiar to itself. Notwithstanding that in the text of the decree the members of the association call them- selves orgeones (the word occurs four times), in the crowns carved two above and two below the text they are called thiasotai. It can be thought that the peculiarity of the inscribing in the crowns is traceable to the stone-cutter. He doubtless received the text of the decree from the treasurer and epimeletai of the orgeones. He may have received the order to inscribe on the stone in addition as many crowns as the space permitted, with identical names, it being left to him to insert within the crowns the title of the grantees. By this time associations of thiasotai had become so numerous in the Piraeus that the name thiasotai was the usual appellation of members of</page><page sequence="83">THE ATTIC ORGEONES 139 private cults. The stone-cutter's business in the Piraeus must have been normally with thiasotai rather than with orgeones and this was probably the name he cut in crowns when he was not given contrary instructions. Even if the orgeones had noticed his mistake and dis- liked it they may easily have let it go rather than mutilate the sur- face of the marble by having it corrected. Stelai were frequently set up without revisions of the texts being made after they had been engraved (cf., for example, Hesperia, VII, no. 1 and pp. 8 f.). Some such explanation as this is preferable to the one now commonly given (Wilhelm, Oester, Jahresh. 1909, 132) - that by the middle of the third century B.C. thiasotai and orgeones were interchangeable terms - because this is the only instance known to us in which the two designations are seemingly synonymous. There is, however, an alternate explanation of this abnormality which must be taken into account. Now that the archon Lysitheides, in whose year IG II2 1316 was passed, is certainly dated in the middle of the third century B.C. (246/45, Pritchett and Meritt; 9.53/52, Dinsmoor, The Athenian Archon List in the Light of Recent Discoveries), it is the earliest record of the orgeones of the Mother of the Gods in our possession. In the series of decrees which came from the hieron in Akte it falls between IG II 1273 (284/83 B.C.) and the group which belongs in the last quarter of the third century. As pointed out above (n. 49), the owners of the hieron in 284/83 B.C. were thiasotai. In 246/45? B.c. (IG II 1316), as in the last quarter of the third century and thereafter, the control of the Metroon is in the hands of the orgeones. Since two distinct associations cannot have been the owners of one shrine simultaneously we must accept one of two things, either that two shrines of the Mother of the Gods co-existed in the same area or that a change in the title and composition of the controlling association occurred between 284/83 and 246/45 B.C. For the first of these alternatives, which might have been proved or disproved if the area had been excavated scientifically, the parallel of the orgeones of Bendis (above, p. 102) might be adduced; but there we have two distinct associations simultaneously active, here the KOLYVO, that is to say, a corporate body of tliiasotai disappears completely; and the only remaining traces of thiasotai are found in the records of the orgeones. The second alternative is clearly preferable. The thiasotai must have been hard hit by the economic vicissitudes of the foreign traders and sea-merchants of the Piraeus during the critical epoch in which the association ceased to exist. Transfers of hiera from private to public control are so well attested as to be normal in Athens; but so far as I know there is no parallel to the transfer of a hieron from aliens to citizens. Yet this is what most probably occurred with the Metroon in the Piraeus between 284/83 and 246/45 B.c. At some point between these dates, perhaps not long before 246/45 B.C., a</page><page sequence="84">140 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW group, undoubtedly a relatively large group, of citizens organized themselves as orgeones with an annual priestess instead of two semi- annual priests, and a civil staff, modelled perhaps on that of the orgeones of Bendis, of epimeletai, treasurer, and secretary, and ac- quired control of the shrine and cult of the Mother of the Gods. It may have taken into its membership the residue of the thiasotai or its elite. Assuming this to have been the genesis of the society four abnormalities in its records are explicable. 1. Ergasion becomes in- telligible. In fact he may have obtained the office, not as an exception, but in consequence of an arrangement made when the orgeones took over the shrine whereby one of the three epimeletai had to be an alien. 2. The incorporation of thiasotai among the orgeones would also ex- plain the stone-cutter's procedure in inscribing Ot aorkat instead of bpyEyvEs in the four crowns which he engraved on the stele from which IG I2 1316 is copied. The association was in fact a composite of thiasotai and orgeones. 3. The burial fund is in order. An association of orgeones, without thiasotai, did not need one. The Athenian law ([Demos.] XLIII 57 f.) placed the responsibility for the inhumation or cremation of freemen upon their heirs or kinsmen and of slaves upon their masters, and empowered the demarchs in cases of default to do the necessary and collect the costs from those responsible. The presupposition is that freemen had either property or kin. This might be true for citizens and metics; but it cannot have accorded with facts for many non-resident aliens. For these private associa- tions with burial funds would guarantee decent obsequies (cf. above, p. 115). 4. The difficulty raised by the phrase At6brEpa rd 'ArrTIELa in IG I12 1315 disappears. Deubner (Att. Feste, 999) writes: "Entweder handelt es sich um zwei gesonderte Feste des Jahres, oder, ?ihnlich wie in Rom, um eine Feier, die sich tiber zwei Tage erstreckte, von denen beide den Namen Attideia fiihrten" (Foucart, Assoc. rel. 92, Hepding, Attis. 137). The second suggestion is contrary to Greek practice, according to which a single name designated fetes whether they occupied one day or several. There was only one Apaturia even though each of the three days consumed by it had so distinctive a character that it had a name of its own (Schol. Aristoph. Achar. 146; cf. Deubner, Att. Feste, 232). Two separate Attideia in a year re- quire an explanation. A time interval between the two is demanded. We may conclude that a, b'repa derives from the union of the thiaso- tai, with one calendar, and the orgeones, with another (cf. n. 49). The priestess spread the couch for both, but the one may have been attended by the aliens and the other by the citizens. The rites of the former may have been more purely Phrygian than those of the latter. If they were identical their performance at a different time may be attributed to the desire of the aliens or of the citizens to have a fete of Attis by themselves.</page><page sequence="85">THE CULT OF HEROES ARTHUR DARBY NOCK HARVARD UNIVERSITY I THE text discussed p. 73 ff. is a measure to ensure equitable and uncontentious distribution of the flesh of the two 'full- grown victims,' and presumably of the young pig also.' There is no mention of the burning of portions in honor of the heroines or of the hero, and outside Greece we know of sacrifices in which the worshippers took all.2 Such detail would be irrele- vant to the purpose of our inscription, which is not a lex sacra; and the use of ObeZv and the presence of an altar (for the restora- tion in line 6 is almost certain) strongly suggest that conven- tional symbolic offerings were made by fire. Certainly the worshippers got most of the meat. Now it is usual to draw a sharp distinction between (a) sacrifice to Olympians (wherein the worshippers shared the victim with the gods), and (b) sacrifice to gods of the underworld, com- monly called chthonic, and to heroes (wherein the worshippers received no part),3 and to think of the first as implying table 1 For the problem of division cf. Plut. Prov. Alex. (ed. Crusius, Progr. Tiib. 1887), p. 11 f. 2 Herodotus I 132 asserts this of Persian sacrifices (but cf. J. Rom. Stud. XXX, 1940, 194, n. 18). The Salaminioi inscription (n. 18) does not mention the giving of portions to the supernatural beings worshipped, but the purpose of that text also is to keep peace between the men concerned. In general, I suspect that in Greek practice the beings worshipped almost always received something, however little; yet cf. the texts mentioned in nn. 27 and 28 and the 'cup of Hygieia,' n. 60. 3 E.

A brief reconsideration of the question may be of service. We shall now review first some of the evidence for this dis- tinction and for the ideas associated with it, secondly a list of exceptions; in Part II we shall ask how far table fellowship was implicit in participation in sacrifice; in Part III we shall con- sider what was involved in non-participation; in Part IV we shall survey some of the meanings of the term heros. Herodotus II 44 praises those of the Greeks who have two temples (or cults) of Heracles, one for him as immortal and with the epithet Olympios, the other for him as hero.4 Anti- quarians and grammarians went too far in schematic analysis of divergences in detail, but the distinction in general had a solid basis and corresponded to differences in status and myth between gods and heroes. The heroes of a given city were jointly invoked,5 heroes as Homeric characters made an inter- related group, and certain heroes were thought to have gone to the Islands of the Blessed; but the category of heroes in general represents no more than an aggregate of individuals each having his story, habitat, or function,6 and neither, like war zugleich Grab und Kornspeicher.' [On chthonioi, cf. also Wilamowitz, Glaube, I 210 f.] The opposite category of Olympioi is perhaps somewhat clearer (cf. H. Herter, Pauly-Wissowa, XVIII 21), and the classification as such must have influenced the views taken of deities; yet after all Hecate was identified with Artemis. * Cf.

Further, certain leges sacrae show that sanctuaries of heroes and offerings made to them sometimes entailed such measure of ceremonial uncleanness as clung to ordinary death. An inscription of Cos (in its present form, of the first half of the third century B.C.) ordains that the priestess of Demeter Olympia is not to have contact with anything impure, nor to eat by the tomb of a hero nor to set her foot on a heroon, just as she is not to enter a house in which there is childbirth, and prescribes the purification necessary if she does otherwise; the priestess of another Demeter cult on Cos was forbidden to set foot on a heroon.9 At Cyrene, any burial-places other than those of Battos and the Tritopatores and Onymastos convey uncleanness.10 Apollo's oracle, quoted as the source of the regulations, thought it necessary to state exceptions to the general rule. Pausanias V 13. 2 f. describes the sacrifice at Olympia of a black ram into a pit in honor of Pelops and the custom of giving the victim's neck to the so- called 'woodman,' and adds, 'Whoever - native Elean or stranger - eats of the flesh of the victim offered to Pelops, may not enter the temple of Zeus." At Pergamon, on the river Caicus, the same thing happens to persons who sacrifice to Telephus: they may not go up to the sanctuary of Asclepius till they have bathed.' The Thasian ordinance for sacrifices to the heroic Heracles shows an earnest desire that people should avoid mistakes on this as on other points.'2 We have here a matter of well established practice, familiar to intelligent Greeks. Yet there is a substantial body of ex- ceptions, partial and total. By partial exceptions, I mean those in which a figure frequently regarded as a hero was spoken 7 Nilsson, Neue Jahrb.

Even such instances are relevant, since these characters had heroic legends and Amphiaraus 15 and Trophonius are attached to particular spots and belong to the underworld. Sophocles, Electra 841 describes Amphiaraus as ruling beneath the earth in full vitality. Accordingly, whatever the terminology and whatever the nominal status of these supernatural beings, their cultus in divine forms is an explicit contradiction of any hard and fast line between celestial and 'chthonic,' always divine and once human.16 There are numerous total exceptions, as follows: (1) Our text, in which Echelos is 'the hero,' and the heroines are described by that title. (2) The cults of Egretes (pp. 80 f.), and probably Hypodektes (pp. 81 f.); it may fairly be assumed that orgeones in general partook of sacrifices. Hestiator as the title of the chief official is conclusive. (3) The Attic Theseia, at least as amplified in the fifth century. The skins of the numerous animals sacrificed were sold, which excludes the idea of holocaust; and the banquet given to the people appears to have utilized their flesh. Nevertheless, Theseus was hero, not god: much importance was attached to his relics, and apparently choai, funerary libations, were made.'7 This exception is very significant, since the conservative Cimon took the lead in bringing up the relics of Theseus from Skyros to Athens, and presumably 13 IG VII 219, where O[Eov] seems certain; if the art type of a child suckled by a goat refers to him (cf. Pley, Pauly-Wissowa XV 393), he may be a faded pre- Greek deity. Asclepius, in spite of the legend, is treated as fully divine: cf. the Pergamene ordinance just noted. 14 Note Pausan. IX 39.5 (those waiting for revelations fed lavishly on the victims offered to Trophonius, hi? children, and certain deities). 15 In spite of the story of his ascent as a god (Pausan. I 34. 4). 16 After all, many heroes had a place in the precinct of the deity. Again, as early as the time of Philpchorus, an object in the inmost part of the Delphic sanctuary and next to the golden image of Apollo was regarded as the tomb of Dionysus and the tale was not thought incongruous (the supposed inscription as cited in Malplas II 52 p. 45, cannot be ascribed to Philpchorus and hardly, I think, even to Kephalion; cf. Fr. Jacoby, Frag. gr. Hist. II C, p. 298. It is a copy of the familiar 'epitaph of Zeus'). 17 Cf. L. Deubner, Attische Feste, 224 f.; H. Herter, Rh. Mus. LXXXVIII (1939), 292ff. For the Athenians, Theseus was a human hero, even if he was perhaps originally more than man; cf. L. Radermacher, Mythos u. Sage bei d. Griechen, 262 ff.</page><page sequence="89">THE CULT OF HEROES 145 in the establishment of the festival, and this at a time when the Areopagus still had its power. (4) The ceremonial of the Salaminioi, who in their 'offerings to gods and heroes' gave to Ioleos a sheep burnt whole; the absence of the term holokauton shows that they shared the victims sacrificed to Eurysaces, 'the heros at the Hale,' and apparently those sacrificed to the hero Phaiax, the hero Teukros, the hero Nauseiros, and Skiros.18 (5) The offerings of the M1arathonian tetrapolis to various unspecified heroines, and heros Pheraios, etc.19 (6) Offerings to another heroine, mentioned in an Athenian inscription.20 (7) The regular distribution of 'portions' after sacrifices to Paralos, whose status as an Attic hero is not explicit in the ordinance but is in literary texts.21 (8) The Phocian custom of bringing victims daily to a hero-founder at Tronis, pouring the blood through a hole into his grave and consuming the flesh on the spot (Paus.

We should perhaps add the Eleu- sinian heroes listed in the portion of the restored Solonian code published by J. H. Oliver, Hesperia IV (1935), 21, 11. 65 ff. There is not here as with other cults in the list a mention of lepeweavva, but these heroes are coupled with deities as receiv- ing sacrifice from the Eumolpidai: [Oboavr] may be regarded as certain; and, though we should not press the word, it is applied to both categories without distinction. Triptolemus, though in popular legend an heroic figure, had a share in divine cultus. I am inclined to regard him as from the beginning a subordinate deity humanized by mythology; cf. Strabo X p. 468 for the notion of 7rp6'ro2ot, super- natural and human. Such figures are commonly plural, Silenoi, Satyroi, Okeanides, and occasionally Panes, and their individual naming would in general be secondary. Are the figures named in Oliver's text and Hom. H. Dem. 153 ff. just such a group ? (Cf. P. Mazon, Mdl. Bidez, 607 f. on Ploutoi; the Incubo of Petron. 38. 8 should perhaps be compared.) Minoan-Mycenaean art objects represent various daemo- nic cult attendants (e.g. Nilsson, Minoan-Mycenaean Religion, 327, etc.). These are often shown as part-animal; but such could be humanized (cf. also aLUL6v5v &amp;'ycevos in the 'hymn of the Curetes'; Diehl, Anthologia lyrica, II 79 ff.). Subordination is sometimes the result of the superimposition of one cult on another (e.g. of that of Apollo on that of Hyakinthos), but need not always be; cf. n. 73 below. (It must of course be remembered that, as Wilamowitz and Nils- son have taught us, the word daimon is extremely rare in cult. It is a word of reflection and analysis.)</page><page sequence="90">146 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW offering of oxen, and all of the Phigaleans feast together with their slaves; sons sit on stones, without outer garments, and dine .. at the banquets.' 2 (10) The custom at Tarentum of offering heroic sacrifice (enagizein) to the Atreidai and Tydeidai and Aiakidai and Laertiadai, and also on one special day a thysia to the Agamemnonidai, of which women did not partake - and therefore presumably men did.23 (11) A lex sacra at Mykonos (ca. 900 B.C.) recording a sacrifice to an Arche. getes (probably heroic), of which people partook.24 With the possible exception of the Tarentine practice, these are old rituals. We should recall also three new foundations.25 (1) Epicteta's foundation at Thera (210-195 B.C.) provides for sacrifice to the Muses and the heroes (two dead sons, her dead husband, and herself); certain offerings, including fish, are reserved to the heroes, but of others they, like the Muses, receive only the portions due to them; the rest is available for human consumption, a fact the more striking since the division of the victim for each pair of heroes exists side by side with the strictly funerary offering of fish.26 22 Harmodius of Lepreon ap. Athenae. IV p. 149 C. The heroes in question have been thought to be the soldiers from Oresthasion, buried in the marketplace (so Ernst Meyer in Pauly-Wissowa XIX 2084); we may follow Nilsson, Griech. Feste, 455 n. 2 in leaving the question open. May the festival have been one for all the heroes of the city? Certainly there is no mention of a grave or bothros. (The fact that the sons sat to eat does not indicate anything funerary: children usually sat at meals, while their elders reclined; cf. Th. Klauser, Die Cathedra im Toten- kult, 5 n. 16; 21.) 23 [Arist.] mir. ausc. 106, p. 840a. Cf. G. Giannelli, Culti e miti della Magna Grecia, 42 f. 24 Dittenberger, ed. 3, 1024, 39 if. We should probably add J. von Prott, Fasti sacri 36 no. 15. 11 (= Coljitz-Bechtel, Sammlung 4650, IG V i 1447), if KXaLKO4P6pw~ is there as at Epidaurus the name of a hero; but Meister (cf. M. N. Tod, J. Hell. St. XXXII, 1912, 103) regards the word as the title of a religious functionary. Another possible instance is afforded by Dieuchidas ap. Athenae. VI p. 263 A. Phorbas ordered his friends to have free men perform his enagismoi 'and the custom continues in the sacrifice (Ovlui) of Phorbas. The attendants are free men and a slave may not come near.' Ovaia is not to be pressed, but ol ta- KOVPTES, 'the attendants,' above all in the context in Athenaeus, strongly sug- gests a cult-meal (cf. Plut. Q. G. 44 p. 301 E). Whatever Phorbas was in origin (cf. n. 73) he was deemed to have been a man; cf. Diod. Sic. V 58, where we read 25 We might be tempted to include Philopoemen: cf. Dittenberger, ed. 3, 624 (the restoration in line 37 rT a' Kpia r7[] pcj'a[LtLa] K[arTaKa ELV] can hardly be right, since the skins were not burnt, as in holocaust; perhaps K[araK67TTELr]) and Foucart 142ff.

This is further illustrated by Plutarch, Arat. 53. The Sicyonians secured from the Achaeans the body of Aratus, 'but since they had an ancient ordi- nance that no one might be buried within the city walls, and a strong religious scruple (&amp;tertatLtuopla) attached to the ordinance, they sent to Delphi to consult the Pythia on these matters.' The Pythia approved and they turned their mourning into joy, and with garlands, white robes and paeans (cf. n. 78) and dances brought the body into the city, and established a shrine for Aratus as founder and savior. This story indicates the strength as well as the vari- ability of Greek scruples, powerful here in spite of an eager popular desire to pay perpetual honor to the remains of a beloved servant of the city. (It should be remarked that Sicyon had a double cult of Heracles, as god and as hero: Pausan. II 10. 1 and p. 142 above.) To resume, there is a formidable body of instances, early and late, in which departure from the norm of heroic cultus is attested and we cannot dispose of them by supposing that all the heroes in question were formally honored as gods, not as heroes, for the texts prove the opposite. Nor can we maintain Foucart's view that exceptions are due to a fading of distinc- tions: 29 the text from which we started goes back to the middle Dolger, IXOT2, II 377 ff. - E. Dyggve-Fr. Pouleen - K. Rhomaios, Das Heroon v. Kalydon (Mem. Acad. Copenhagen, VII s&amp;r. 4, iv, 1934) publish the remains of the structure of what might have been a comparable foundation not later than about 100 B.C. The finds give no detail as to the cult, but the excavators identify as 'Speisesaal, fiir Mahlzeiten und Symposia kultischer Art bestimmt' (107 [395]) a room next to the larger one with an apse in which was found a 'cult-table.' The interment was under the apse and inaccessible (100 [388]; cf. Fr. Matz, Die Antike, IV, 1928, 270, 276). 27 IG XII vii 515 (Laum II 57 ff. no. 50), 11. 74 ff.

Laum II 38, no. 31, making provision for sacrifice at the tomb and a public banquet of a commemora- tive kind, but not calling the dead man a hero (the text is incomplete). 29 Le culte des heros, 106.</page><page sequence="92">148 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW of the fifth century (p. 76 above), and the practice must be older, while various of the other rituals listed are clearly ancient. Heroic cults created from the latter part of the sixth century onwards might be expected to follow an accepted classical norm; until we come to private foundations of the Hellenistic period, divergences are likely to be survivals rather than innovations. Ada Thomsen has shown that there is no simple formula for these matters.30 When the sacrifice is a holocaust, the victims dark, not light, and the time night rather than day, then the cult in question is usually directed to heroes or to deities of the earth or underworld, but we cannot make even this proposi- tion universal (cf. p. 159 later). Certainly we cannot reverse it, and say that, where such rites were not employed, the objects of cult were gods or goddesses of the Olympian type. Nor, again, can we safely forget Thomsen's reminder that the high point of Greek popular religion is the joyous festival, and that the Greeks were not dominated by any fear of ghosts.31 II 'Ye shall eat before the Lord your God and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto.' We come now to the general question of table fellowship, and to two particular propositions. First, participation in the flesh of a sacrificed victim did not involve conscious table fellowship with the supernatural recipient of other parts of the animal, and, although a god was now guest, now host, man kept his distance. Second (pp. 156 ff.), the semblance of table fellowship with heroes and with the dead was not avoided. (1) It is now widely held that, when part of a victim went to the gods and part to the worshippers, this division once in- volved a communion between the two in the flesh of the victim 30 Arch.

Nilsson, Greek Popular Religion, 102ff. for a corrective against any ascription to them of a thoroughgoing rationalism.</page><page sequence="93">THE CULT OF HEROES 149 and created a bond of table fellowship. This hypothesis can be made to explain much that would otherwise be obscure. Nevertheless, we must not impute to the ancients anything like a conscious awareness of the idea, still less any inferences which it may suggest to us, e.g. 'the apprehension lest by en- tering into communion with the shadowy world one should be brought under its power.' 32 To the Greeks, laymen and theorists alike, sacrifice was primarily a matter of gift or first fruits or tribute and of effective action by the offering of these: 'gifts persuade the gods, gifts persuade revered kings.' Even if the god's part of the victim was small, the giving of it recog- nized his superior prerogative, just as the payment of a nominal or 'peppercorn' rent acknowledges ownership of land; the god received time, honor (Porph. Abst. II 20). So, after first fruits had been offered, it was legitimate to consume the remainder of a crop. The same principle is seen in the cup of the Agathos Daimon at the end of dinner and the cups of Zeus Olympios (or Zeus Olympios and the Olympian gods), the heroes and Zeus Soter in a symposium (n. 60). The god received only a liba- tion and the rest was consumed by the guests. Nevertheless the cups were called those of these supernatural beings and were hallowed by their names, not shared with them. Philosophers who speak of the fellowship, koinonia, between gods and men 33 do not draw any inference from the fact that the flesh of victims was divided between them. This is not specially noteworthy, for we should not expect Stoics to draw an inference from ritual. It is, however, significant that Iamblichus and Sallustius, in their attempts to show how 32 L. R. Farnell, Greek Hero Cults, 354: in fairness I should quote the words which immediately precede 'whether through fear of the wrath of the ghost or through.' E. Rohde remarks, Psyche I 949 n., on the abstention of initiates at Eleusis from certain foods, 'Wer von der Speise der Unterirdischen geniesst, ist ihnen verfallen': but, after all, the initiates were deliberate~y brought into a specific relpation to Demeter and were given reason to fear the underworld less, not more. Persephone and the pomegranate seeds (Hom. H. Dem. 373) are not relevant. Cf. Iambl. V. Pyth. 109 on the avoidance of what belongs to chthonic deities; but the same tradition forbade participation in what belongs to the gods; cf. p. 164 later. 31 Cf. Hauck in G. Kittel, Theol. W~rterb.

There are certain apparent exceptions to what has been said. First, Dion of Prusa III 97 asks 'What sacrifice is acceptable to the gods without men who feast with them?' "5: the question reflects the idea of divine philanthropia and the notion of the deity as host rather than the division of the flesh of the victim into a 'divine part' for the gods and other portions for the worshippers. Secondly, Aristides says in his prose hymn To Sarapis (026-8): Among gods he is at one and the same time the greatest lover of humanity and the most terrifying .... But he is the more inclined to mercy. What Homer said of all the gods, that they may be turned and appeased, is con- firmed most strikingly by Sarapis: so many turns does he turn for the well- being of those who at any time need him. Wherefore men have the true partnership in sacrifices with this god alone above all others: they invite him to their hearths and set him in the chair as guest and entertainer (hestia- tor): so that where some make up one party and some another, Sarapis alone makes up all parties and is lord of the feast for those who at any time come together under his auspices .... He is at the same time participant in liba- tions (6dby6rovbos, usually of men) and the receiver of libations .... There is a similar partnership - as of equals in honor with an equal in honor, - of men with him in other matters: so merchants and sea captains do not just give him tithes, but they share with him equally as a fellow merchant and partner in all their undertakings. Before commenting on this, we may note also Philo's expres- sion of the Jewish sentiment of intimacy with God in terms reminiscent of Greek humanism, when he writes of the sacri- 34 De mysteriis V 5 ff., p. 205 ff.

Prusa, 428 f. and Wilamowitz (Hermes LXIII, 1928, 381) are right in bracketing OEo-s. Certainly the latter goes too far in finding the utterance blasphemous; it is of a piece with many Greek utterances (cf. Nock, Proc. Am. Philos. Soc. LXXXV, 1942, 477 f. etc.), and in the same section of Dio we have (107) ' Kal ro 0s Oo^s xaXE6rV. - avEvvcwoXo abr7iTowV ab'T4, addressed to a man who is to make a magical figure (K.

I a21): 'The meals are now the property not of him by whom but of him to whom the victim has been sacrificed, the benefactor, the bountiful one, who has made the festive company of those who perform the sacrifice partners of the altar and sharers of the table.' 36 (As so often in Philonic applications of Greek ideas, the purpose is homiletical.) The whole context in Aristides is important as showing how he envisaged partnership, koinonia. The specific reference is to the widespread habit of having meals of fellowship called 'couch of Sarapis,' 37 but, as A. Hzfler saw,38 Aristides is think- ing not only of these but of all meals in which worshippers of Sarapis had him in mind. Some symbolic offering or act of homage was probably made before a representation of the god. Yet we should not press too hard the word 'sacrifices,' for as early as Herodotus VIII 99 it had come very near to meaning 'dinner party.' Thirdly, we have a passage of Porphyry de Philosophia ex oraculis hauri- enda preserved in Euseb. Praep. evang. IV 9. 7 p. 147 c. Porphyry has quoted a late 'theological oracle' which defines modes of sacrifice and says of victims offered to the starry and ethereal gods, 'Give the extremities to Hephaistos (i.e., burn them), and eat the rest.' He comments: obpavloLs 6U Kal aiWeplots rda ETr rTPo ,cWv KOVqUrEpa, airEp E'art aKpa, OS KOLVhWVfV 7TS 'Ovalas 6z. 6OTr0prs -ydp o0rot yaOC8V, o 61 biXXot T'V KGaK' KCWX UTOpes.

Such a remark would fit Porphyry's application of the principle, 'like rejoices in like,' and Seguier de Saint-Brisson, retaining b6t, so translates. Nevertheless, the words which follow, 'for these gods are givers of blessings whereas the others are averters of evils' do not agree, and, if A's reading is correct, we shall have to postulate a lacuna - which is in any event possible. 31 Spec. leg.

We must translate, as Gifford, 'and with these gods we must participate in the sacrifice' - which corresponds to rd a X6o'rad w 7raacrOat of the oracle. This is the nearest thing to an exception that I have found: joint partici- pation between gods and men, declared to be of the essence of a rite. Yet the rationale is to be noted: we must share because these gods are givers of good things. We receive a gift from supernatural beings whose nature it is to give; our share of sacrifice is like 'all the blessings of this life.' With such deities we must share: I do not press the point, but the verb is 5Ei, not 7rpTrIE 'it is fitting,' or 7rpoOlKEt 'it is a duty' (cf. the contrast in Porph. Abst. II 2 where 8d occurs by itself two other times to mean 'is inevitable'). The function of these deities is positive, while that of the deities with whom we do not share is negative. This is not a distinction between chancy and un- chancy table companions. (For what looks like an exception in Julian, cf. Appendix 1.) Here as elsewhere the god is primarily host: so were Apollo to the other gods at the Delphic Theoxenia, Heracles and other deities to their parasitoi 39 (specific groups meeting on stated occasions for sacrifice and eating as a sacred duty and in fact a civic obligation), Heracles to his synetheis in Macedonia,40 Zeus at Astakos to his synestai 41 (whether a gild or, as I suspect, an official group comparable with the parasitoi), 'the god Asclepius' to his synmposiastai at a place in Bulgaria,42 a region in which he had a great standing, Artemis at Scillus, in the cult established by Xenophon (Anab.

III 336: cf. Dorieus ap. Athenae. X p. 412 F iv ALbs ElXarivaLs), and the gods could be seen dining with the Phaeacians (Odyss. VII 201-203). The Delphic Theoxenia was accompanied by a meal for worshippers (nn. 50, 52). So at Rome the epulum louis was accompanied by a feast for the senators on the Capitol, i.e. in the presence of the triad of deities. Aulus Gellius XII 8. 3, in describing the reconciliation at one such banquet of two great Romans who had quarreled, says tumrn quasi diis inmortalibus arbitris in conuiuio louis optimi maximi dexteras eorum con- ducentibus.47 This is a fine imaginative touch and even more, for Ovid's account of offerings to Pales (Fasti IV 743 ff.) clearly implies something like a divine presence at the meal, though the explicit purpose is (777) his dea placanda est (cf. ibid. VI 305-308; the annual domestic rite of luppiter Dapalis shows the same spirit). The Romans had a deep feeling for the sacra mensae (Tac. Ann.

Yet the Ro- mans, as far back in history as our knowledge goes, were marked by a strong legal instinct to define the purpose of action. It is therefore the more significant that the formulas which they employed in sacrifice 49 express the desire that the god may be magnified or placated or that the sacrifice may be deemed well done or (Liv. XLI 16. 1) that the god may give a blessing, but have never a word on this establishment of table fellowship. (Cf. Appendix 2.) Participation was between the men concerned, as in confar- reatio, which made a bond that was hallowed by deep religious sentiment and sanction. The relation of those who met to do sacrifice was to one another and not to the gods - in fact, a personal relationship, other than one of dependence and grati- tude, to a numen, is barely thinkable. The Greeks were much more given to anthropomorphism, but with them also the situation is that men ate of the god's table as a privilege, or had meals associated with the god's meal,"5 or again enjoyed what might be called a secondary vicarious consumption of food set before the god. (So priests and others ate food which had been set on tables before deities,51 49 So of the meal to Iuppiter Dapalis, macte hac illace dape pollucenda esto .. macte istace dape pollucenda esto, macte uino inferio esto; and in other rites, macte suouetaurilibus inmolandis esto. te hisce suouetaurilibus piaculo, te hoc porco piaculo, tibi hoc boue mare pulchro sacrum fiat, etc.: G.

Again, Pindar's descendants enjoyed the poet's share at the Delphic Theoxenia and members of the lobacchi were given the portions of the deities whose names they bore in the ceremonies.)52 Men kept their place, just as in the Pickwick Papers 'Mr. Weller, seated at a respectful distance, though at the same table with his master, was accommodated with a pint of porter,' a concession which did not alter his status. (A Latin counterpart may be found in Columella XI 1. 19.) Unlike Mr. Pickwick, the Greek gods formed a constant background and, we may say, consecration of conviviality (Athenae. 192 B): their blessing rested on wine and food, as on the pain benit of the Asklepieion of Cos.53 No doubt there was at times some feeling of fellowship with the gods, but it was not explicit and, after all, common meals and common sitting places of men and gods belonged to the Golden Age (Hesiod fr. 82 Rzach = p. 186 no. 59 Evelyn-White; Pausan.

Aristotle illustrates associations supposedly made for the sake of pleasure by reference to thiasotai and eranistai (p. 95, above). Aeschylus Agam. 151 brings out the horror of the sacrifice of Iphigenia by the epithet ~batros 'whereof no one could partake.'55 The vic- tim was hallowed and slain, and then in the meal which fol- lowed man enjoyed what man might lawfully eat, except in those cults in which by tradition nothing was available for men. KOLyVWvTa 7Tv tLp&amp;v was a joint participation, by persons entitled through birth or invitation, in ceremonies and sacrificial food and in the blessings which rested thereupon." There was a conscious fellowship of the worshippers with one another, rather than of the worshippers with the deity honored (I Cor. 10. 20 is a Pauline interpretation of pagan worship). Accordingly, I see nothing in ancient ideas about sacrifice to create an intrinsic antipathy to participation in victims offered to the gods of the underworld and to heroes. (2) In spite of ceremonies of aversion, such as formed part of the Anthesteria, the Greeks had no such fear of ghosts as haunts the Navaho: in fact, they had little sense of repugnance for the dead and for the underworld. We have seen Sarapis as 'lord of the feast for those who at any time come together under his auspices' (p. 150): and yet Sarapis, for all the ex- tension of his functions, was a god of the world of the dead, and Artemidorus classifies him among the chthonioi (II 34 p. 131). Artemidorus again, and though late he is a good witness for popular beliefs at a fairly unsophisticated level, speaks of a dead man as receiving his friends and being host at the meal given at his grave.'5 In the epic, funeral ceremonies were fol- 65 Cf. 1. 43 of oracle in H.

III Before we come to a consideration of the range of the term heros, a word may be said in answer to a question which the reader will perhaps ask: If participation in sacrifice did not involve a notion of table fellowship with the supernatural be- ings worshipped, and if furthermore there would have been little if any repugnance to table fellowship with the dead, why were there sacrificial ceremonies in which the victim was com- church and at the grave); D.

The answer must needs be provisional; it involves matters lying outside the scope of this inquiry, and I cannot claim to have made an adequate examination of the evidence which is extensive, scattered, and confusing (our sources are only too often either careless or schematic). Any neat general formulation is almost certain to do violence to the facts.62 There are two categories of holocaust. First, there are of- ferings to persons who have lived and died and who are sup- posed to need real sustenance and nourishment - and this need is naturally ascribed to unhistorical characters once they are supposed actually to have lived and died. Secondly, there are offerings which may best be called heilige Handlungyen, cere- monies wherein an animal was consumed (not always by fire) in a proceeding intended to exercise direct and efficacious in- fluence upon divine powers or upon forces of nature. As for the first, though the hero at Tronis was content with blood, which is what the dead in Homer craved, and though liquids and vegetable offerings and cakes came to predominate in funerary offerings,63 the mighty dead were often thought to require a whole victim. For naive Greeks, sacrifice was the food of the gods also, but it was far less natural to suppose that the gods needed their share of sacrifice. The heroes could be credited with appetite and jealousy for their rights; an element of malignity is at times imputed to them. Secondly, we have such ceremonies as the fertility rites of the Thesmophoria, wherein pigs were thrown into a chasm, and the symbolic offering of puppies to the war god Enyalios and purifi- catory rites with the use of the same animal (we may compare 62 I am in substantial agreement with Ph. E. Legrand (in Daremberg-Saglio, IV 972), save that I reject any supposed scruples against partaking in company with the dead, etc. There is a great range of possible variety; cf.

After all, liquids are obviously absorbed into the ground.</page><page sequence="103">THE CULT OF HEROES 159 the augurium canarium, the October equus, and the Robigalia at Rome). Again, there are sphagia in general, oath-sacrifices (except for Pausan. V 24. 10, which is perhaps explained by its setting in the Olympian festival), offerings of victims in a crisis, cathartic sacrifices (wherein the animal or its blood, like the 'fleece of Zeus,' is good magic) and various ceremonies to avert evil. The destruction of the animal was complete in almost all of these, whether the gods invoked in historical time came from the clear air of Olympus or from the earth or from the underworld.64 Human sacrifices, whether offered or said to be offered to Zeus Lykaios, Zeus Laphystios, Artemis, or Dionysos Omestes or again without the naming of any super- natural character, constitute a classic instance. They are powerful forms of action: the slaying of Iphigenia is 'a cure for a bitter storm' (Aesch. Agam. 198 f.: to Clytaemnestra in her bitterness, 'a spell against the Thracian blasts,' 1418. For her, Agamemnon's death is sacrificial; 1432 f.). For this second category, would it not be true to say that non-participation followed upon the purpose and atmosphere of the ritual and upon the disposition or aspect imputed to the deities rather than upon their identity or supposed habitat? After all, Jahwe received holocaust and communion sacrifice alike. In fact, Pausanias VIII 34. 3 tells how when the Eume- nides were about to make Orestes mad, they appeared black to him; but, when he had bitten off a finger, they appeared to be white and he recovered his reason and made enagismos to the first, by way of averting their anger but did sacrifice (rovau) to 64 Cf. Julian's remarks as discussed in Appendix 1 and S. Eitrem, S. Oslo., XVIII (1938), 9ff. There is something of an analogy between the slaying of Polyxena for Achilles and that of Iphigenia for Artemis. I say 'the gods invoked in historical times,' since a number of such ceremonies are predeistic or at least antedate the specific deities ultimately concerned. Cf. M. P. Nilsson, J. Hell. Stud. XLIII, 1923, 144 on fire-festivals as a striking in- stance of this type of ceremony; A. Bertholet, Sitzungsber. Berlin, 1938, 175 f.; S. Eitrem, S. Oslo. XVIII 16 ff. (this last for the idea that the keres etc. were kept at arm's length). [Demosth.] LIX 73 -rpa?e, 75 illustrate the idea of specific action (though nb. facio of any sacrifice).

This may or may not reflect historic duality of ritual; it certainly shows the significance of the aspect of the deity.65 As Fairbanks remarked in this connection, we know a Zeus and a Hermes of the earth; in developed mythology Arte- mis has three aspects, and so later has Aphrodite; even the Winds have two.66 Hecate was notably associated with darkness and death but even she had a wider range of action. Not only rough characters, such as Demosthenes LIV 39 describes, but also the poor, who were presumably not less superstitious than the rich, were said to eat the meals set out for her; to do so was contrary to good custom, and might be credited with unpleasant results (Petron. 134); but it was not, like a high-voltage wire, a major danger which could not be ignored. After all, Hecate was also a goddess who gave blessings and many personal names were derived from her. Again, Persephone was corn goddess as well as goddess of the dead and Pluton had a similar duality of functions. Gods of the dead as such received little formal worship. They might inspire fear and aversion, but with the exception of the Erinyes and sometimes Hecate, they did not harm the living (cf. Appendix 3). Further, most forms of supernatural activity are common to Olympians and chthonioi. Both are invoked in curses. Again, the gate is guarded by Apollo as well as by Hermes, Hecate, and heroes; oracles are given by the powers of the earth and by Zeus and Apollo; epileptic possession and the like come from 65 Cf. Fairbanks, Am. J. Phil. XXI, 1900, 258. He infers participation also in the offerings to the Semnai (Eumenides) described by Pausan. I 28. 6, a conclu- sion to which some support is lent by Schol. in Soph. O. C. 489 (which suggests though it does not prove that the Hesychidai, unlike the Eupatridai, shared in offerings to these goddesses). Nilsson, Symbolae Danielsson, 224 f. has shown how Zeus Meilichios was transformed and Pausan. X 38. 8 may indicate a phase of transition. If, as has been postulated (n. 19), lepcavva imply participation, the Marathonian tetrapolis had communion-sacrifice in its cults of the Tritopatreis and Akamantes (J. v.

Enagismos is distinct also in that it commonly involves an altogether different and positive emphasis on the blood of victims. When animals were offered in sacrifice with partici- pation, thysia, their blood was shed with due solemnity, at or before an altar. Often it was caught in a bowl, and what fell on the altar was not cleaned away - any more than the ashes of the sacrificial fire were removed. Nevertheless, the blood had not here any such specific function as it had in offerings to persons and powers of the underworld. In such sacrifices, the blood was deemed to satisfy a specific desire. So again it was 'good medicine' in various rites of purification or atone- ment. It is possible that some of the associations of the use of blood in propitiation entered the mind of a worshipper when he was making a sacrifice with participation, but if so, they were 67 On guardians of the gate, etc., cf.

The contrast with Semitic sacrifices and with any emphasis on the blood as being the life is clear. IV Finally, we must remember that the term heros often meant 'minor deity' and not 'man who lived and died and subse- quently received veneration.' Hero-cult, like Greek ritual in general, represents the result of a gradual development in which we can see notable influences of the period of legalism which Nilsson has taught us to understand.7 Enagismnos became normative for hero-cult in general, but sacrifice with participa- tion was the natural thing for a Greek in ordinary circumstances. Does not Theophrastus ap. Porph. Abst. II Q6 observe that if the Jews bade us Greeks sacrifice in their way (i.e. as holo- caust), we should give up the practice? (Cf. Appendix 4.) Special reasons apart, a Greek could not waste so much good meat. Enagismos to heroes was a development of the homage paid to outstanding individuals in prehistoric (at least later prehis- toric) and historic times. Their cult had firm roots in local soil and its place in the civic pattern was enhanced by Homer and Hesiod on the one hand, and by Delphi on the other. The idea that heroes were dead men whose relics might be trans- ferred 72 became dominant in thought and writing, but not equally in cult. Many figures called 'hero' or 'heroine' were not of this kind and were intrinsically little gods or goddesses - not faded gods necessarily, but little local deities who never rose to wider regional or universal greatness, or again super- natural beings subordinate or subordinated to gods.7" Perhaps 7' History of Greek Religion, 180 ff. - Cf. the argument of R. J. Bonner- G. Smith, The Administration of Justice from Homer to Aristotle, I 53, II 192 ff., that the whole idea of pollution by homicide is secondary and artificially grafted onto court procedure. 72 Cf.

Otherwise, the heroes are highly disparate; Farnell in his classic work makes seven categories. It is not surprising that there was diversity of usage,"4 and that a ritual with participa- tion was employed even in the cult of heroes who had been men. Terminology and ritual were not stereotyped; two official Attic inscriptions refer to the Heros latros by that name, and then quote the Council as proposing a measure in which he is called 6 oEbs.75 It should not be forgotten that the Pythagorean pre- cepts in Diog. Laert. VIII 33 (cf. A. Delatte, Vie de Pythagore, M6m. acad. roy. Belg. XVII ii, 1992, 229) include 'gods and heroes must not be accorded equal honors: the gods must always be worshipped with silence, in white garments and purity, the the end of a list of gods). Artemidorus speaks only of Ovala, never of i&amp;ayw,6A&amp;, etc.; so also the quotations in F. Cumont, L'egypte des astrologues, from as- trological texts, which reflect a social level similar to that of Artemidorus. When heroes are set in relation to deities, it is by way of individual or generic subordi- nation, not of the contrast between two opposite worlds; cf. Aristophan. fr. 488 for a comparison between the cult of the gods and of the dead. For the genesis of the category of heroes, cf. L. Radermacher, Mythos u. Sage bei den Griechen, 274, 'Man konnte sich denken, dass die Gestalt des Heros ihrer Konzeption nach und von Haus aus Gott und Mensch zugleich ist, ein Mittler zwischen beiden Sphiren, in dieser Art Geschopf glaubiger Phantasie nicht anders als Zeus, und Mischwesen nicht anders als der Kentaur und seinesgleichen. Zum Heros wird dann auch ein Mensch emporgestiegen oder ein Gott hinabgesunken sein,' a passage to which Professor Bonner drew my attention. Cf. n. 91 above for the view that the subordination of a hero to a god is not always secondary. Against any exaggerated denial of the historicity of heroes, cf. W. R. Halliday, Indo-European Folk-Tales and Greek Legend, 61. The term 'patron' was proposed by B. Schweitzer, Gatt., gel. Anz. 1928, 2 for minor supernatural beings such as are here discussed. 74 Cf. Th. Schreiber, Studien tiber d. Bildniss Alexanders d. Gr. (Abh. suchs. Ges. Wiss. XXI iii, 1903), 243 ff. The control of Delphi was present but not ubiquitous: contrast pp. 143, 147 and Arrian Anab.

Many of the accompanying ordinances agree with our extant leges sacrae, but it is perhaps significant that the prohibition should have been thought necessary. Further, the same Pythagorean source forbids the eating of fishes as sacred 'for the same things must not be allotted to gods and to men any more than they should be to free men and to slaves' (Diog. Laert. VIII 34). A. Delatte, Etudes sur la litterature Pythagoricienne, 291 remarks that a parallel passage (noted n. 39 above) shows that the gods by reason of whom we should ab- stain from fish are gods of the underworld; nevertheless the statement is general. Again, Plato's emphasis on a separation of chthonic and heavenly gods in his Laws (IV p. 717 A, VIII p. 828 C) represents a theoretical hardening of the division of categories into a sharp contrast; and the former passage is contrary to common custom and may draw on Pythagorean formulations (cf. Fr. Boehm, De symbolis Pythagoreis, 58 f.; G. Rohde, Kultsatzungen, 37). We may compare Laws XI p. 914 B, on which Wilamowitz comments, Glaube, I 176. There is a certain parallel in the taboo on picking up food which has fallen; cf. Boehm 26 f. and H. J. Rose, Univ. Calif. Publ. Class. Phil. XII, 1941, 99 n. 8. Pliny, N. H. XX 113, quotes a prohibition on the use of parsley: as is there said, parsley was commonly associated with the dead, but it also adorned the brows of the victors in the Isthmia (Plut. Timol. 25. 3) and of Horace's friends (Odes I 36. 16). Further, though the use of the bean in ceremonies for the dead is sometimes given as a reason for taboos on its eating, these taboos were very far from being generally observed, and other grounds were freely assigned for them. Normally the dead were given things acceptable to the living. We must always be on our guard against schematism and oversimplification: cf. n. 5. We see a striking absence of differentiation between celestial and chthonic deities in Iliad XV 193, 294; Aesch. Ag. 88 ff. (pwool of all types of gods); Eur. Hec. 146; and even Plato, Laws XII p. 958 D. As Wilamowitz said in a much larger sense (Glaube, II 946), Plato saw the need of a new religion; when he follows tradition, it could be of the Pythag- orean rather than of the civic type. After all, though the ubiquitous influence of epic,76 the meter of which is called 'heroic' as early as Plato, caused the word to have a primary association with the mighty dead of the Heroic Age, the word itself was once a term of respect, like kyrios, do- minus, Messire, my lord; that is certain, even if ipco Abvvu-e in 76 Cf.

So at least the names Ioleos and Eurysaces (p. 145 above) are due to general Hellenic, and not Attic, mythology.</page><page sequence="109">THE CULT OF HEROES 165 Plut. Quaest. Gr. 31 p. 299 B is open to doubt.77 Heros com- monly denoted also minor supernatural figures, sometimes simply called 'the hero' (as is Echelos in the old orgeonic regu- lation); sometimes with a functional title, e.g. the 'Hero Healer.' There is no indication that any orgeonic hero had relics, a grave, a bothros or a tube through which offerings could be poured into the earth. Heroes of this type were like the Nymphs 78 and the 'gods in a small way';7" and they were very numerous, perhaps particularly so in Attica.80 How far the word heros was from necessarily involving chthonic associa- tions or a human past is shown by Aristoph. Nub. 314-315. It has thundered and the Clouds have sung two odes in response to the prayers of Socrates but neither he nor Strepsiades has seen them. Strepsiades asks, 'Who are these women, Socrates, who have made this solemn utterance? Surely they are not heroines of a kind, are they?'81 As Nilsson has remarked, such minor supernatural figures were probably closer than the high gods to the ordinary man; 77 Cf.

A Heros of Menander almost certainly appears in Latin as Lar fami- liaris;82 he was a patron saint of a modest order of magnitude. We read in Aristoph. Vesp. 819 ff.: Philocleon. 'If only you would bring out to me the shrine of Lykos!' Bdelycleon. 'Here it is, and here is the Lord himself.' Philocleon. 'O master hero, how stern your aspect is after all.' Lykos - in the shape of a wolf - had his abode by the courts; Philocleon's fevered imagination craves a sight of the 'hero,' and he is shown a painting of his dear if unlovely patron.83 Parody is a distortion of fact; it is not fiction. Lykos might be the juror's hero; but Echelos and the Heroines evoked the gentler piety of the religion of the good earth and of the annual reunion of those who met year by year for their inherited duty and privilege. 81 Wilamowitz, Glaube, II 16 n. 3 denies this on the ground that a hero does not usually dwell in a private home; but the hero of some little shrine before the gate could be deemed to dwell in the house, as Heracles is said to do in a couplet used to ward off evil b rol) ALbs 7raL- KaXXLPLKOS 'HpaKXs EaOd 6L KaTOLKE. p/fl'V EiLTOr KaKVp (references in O.

Julian has been concerned to explain the taboo on the eating of orirpara at the time of Cybele's spring festival (p. 174 A), and passes to the taboo on fish. The chief reason for this is, he says (p. 176 C), that we ought not to eat things which we do not sacrifice to the gods.84 Julian then meets the objections of a supposed adversary who had referred to exceptional sacrifices. He allows that unusual victims were offered in certain solemn sacrifices,8" 'as the Romans offer a horse, and as Greeks and Romans offer dogs to Hecate'; Kal 7roXXa rap' XXoLs 'n rc7v rEXE~YrLKWv, Kat ~57UOoiulr tsrasbXwecrv iira roi erovS 7 bis rotavra Obitara, dXX' oK V rTas TrL/rlTrplots86 (sc.

Cyril's comment Kal, Kara 'ye rb abir4 bo3oK^, r&amp;t.1r4'ipa (Iuliani Contra Christianos, ed. Neumann p. 217. 6). It arises naturally out of the general char- acter of ancient sacrifice; a linguistic influence of the Latin honorarium or of the use of the adjective honorarius to describe voluntary offerings, as distinct from prescribed or piacular offerings, is at best a remote possibility (Julian does speak of the October equus: and he was thinking of Rome, p. 159 C). The elaborate treatment of sacrifice and honor by Arnobius VII 13 ff. is well discussed by W. Kroll Rh. Mus. LXXII (1917), 89 ff. He points to various con- tacts with Porphyry, e.g. the principle that men do not sacrifice that of which they do not eat. Further study might be rewarding; certainly there was a large literature on sacrifice, as again on Pythagorean taboos. Julian p. 191C speaks of the swarms of writings on vegetarianism. 87 Hertlein emends to Abovwv; as Professor Jaeger remarks, this is hardly neces- sary; cf.

J. Dailger, IXOYT2, II 18); W. C. Wright 'in which alone the gods deign to join us and to share our table.' Liddell-Scott-Jones 1811a, while indicating a doubt as to the reading rpa'refovv, also makes it 'receive an offering.' KOLVCY06V is always a difficult word, but rpa'refovv, though rare, is clear: 'set on a table (before)'. Again, the force of 5ltov should not be attenuated in translation: it means not 'it is legitimate or lawful' but 'it is right and proper' (&amp;CLov Kali IKaLov, dignum et justum est in the Christian liturgies). Surely we must render KOLWVEV, not as 'take a share of' but as 'give a share of,' just as in Julian Orat. I 36 (p. 56. 11 H., p. 63. 34 Bidez), and in two other instances in his works (F. Boulenger, Essai critique sur le syntaxe de l'Empereur Julien, 74). KOLVOVE9V states in general terms what rparczo^v puts concretely. The whole means 'of which alone it is appropriate to give the gods a share and to set it before them'."8 This implies that we keep and use part - but that is no more than a commonplace of practice and of obser- vation from Hesiod onwards. [KoLvovia is probably applied to sacrifice in an Epicurean fragment, P. Oxy 215 ii 33. The papyrus is defective at this point but Diels was clearly right in restoring the general sense: 'Diese Gemeinschaft aber zwischen Gittern und Menschen, wenn sie wirklich bestiinde, wiirde ich filr ein grosses Ungliick halten, da sie iiber das Grab hinaus ihre Wirkung erstreckte, bis nach den Leichenfeierlichkeiten, wenn man verbrannt wird' (Sitzungsber. Berlin, 1916, 904). It is the relation- ship to the gods involved in paying tribute to them from fear or from other prudential considerations.] 8s Sacrifices of the 'telestic' type are performed before the gods, but are not offered to them in the normal way; the victims are destroyed and there are no portions to offer on a sacred table.</page><page sequence="113">APPENDIX 2 (see page 154) EVIDENCE AGAINST TABLE FELLOWSHIP IN ROMAN SACRIFICE We can, I think, offer formal proof that, at least for certain ancient Roman sacrifices, the idea of table fellowship with the gods is com- pletely excluded. Cato says of the annual meal for Juppiter Dapalis, ubi daps profanata comestaque erit (50) and loui caste profanato sua contagione (132; cf. G. Rohde, Die Kultsatzungen der romischen Pontifices, 85 if. The difficult problem presented by the last two words does not concern us here). Profanum is the antithesis to sacrum, and profanare means 'to desacralize.' The food and drink had been sur- rendered to the deities: that surrender applied to the total offering, not simply to as much as man did not propose to consume, and the Romans said macte hoc porco, etc., not macte his extis (0. Skutsch- H. J. Rose, Cl. Q. XXXVI, 1942, 17). Yet when the appropriate portion had been given to the gods, the worshippers might properly and safely partake of the rest as of ordinary food. We do not know of any specific rite of profanation, but in effect the taboo was lifted. It is the more noteworthy, since the daps is a ceremony particularly capable of suggesting table fellowship; and there are similar if some- what puzzling indications for thank-offerings to Hercules Inuictus at the Ara Maxima (cf. G. Wissowa, Religion u. Kultus, ed. 2, 278 f. and K. Latte in Pauly-Wissowa, IX 1132; Krause, ibid. Supp. V 279. Here, as in very few old cults at Rome, none of the food offered might be carried away)."9 We may perhaps be justified in generalizing, as Wissowa does (op. cit. 419), from these instances. Again, contrary to Greek custom, the Arval brothers partook of certain expiatory offerings, piacula, and this also was probably common Roman prac- tice (cf. S. P. Tromp, De Romanorum Piaculis, e.g. 126, 131 f.). The essence of the act lay in the presentation of an offering; thereafter the substance or remains of the offering became or were neutral and indifferent; this fits the legal precision of the Roman mind.90 89 Did statim ibidem consumito (Cato, R. R. 83) involve a feeling that the action of offering must be visibly completed? Neither at Rome nor in Greece, where the obligation to complete the eating of sacrifice on the spot is somewhat more frequent, is this obligation reinforced by any expressed fear of consequences such as we occasionally find in other cultures (cf. F. B. Jevons, Introduction to the History of Religion, 147). 90 Sanguinem gustare antea frequenter solebant in a new fragment of the Fasti Praenestini, discussed by G. Wissowa, Hermes LVIII (1923), 378, has apparently</page><page sequence="114">170 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW To sum up, the available evidence suggests that the Romans did not think of a communion with deities in food, and, unlike the Vedic Indians and, apparently, the Greeks, did not even feel that some meas- ure of blessing attached to food after its consecration in sacrifice (cf. n. 53. Servius on Verg. Aen. VIII 183, nam de hoc boue immolato Herculi carnes carius uendebantur causa religionis is part of a wrong attempt to explain perpetui bouis in Virgil; so Wissowa remarked, op. cit. 279, n. 2. At Rome, as in Greece, the use of the skin of a sacrificed animal was mandatory for certain purposes: cf. J. Pley, De lanae in antiquorum ritibus usu, 15, 38 f. and, for the Luperci, H. J. Rose, Mnemosyne, LX, 1933, 393 ft. Was there some idea that this skin was lucky, since a victim sacrificed was proved to be accept- able to the gods? In any event, with the Greeks, the skin of the victim, except in holocaust, was just a marketable commodity.) There was a transfer and a partial resumption of ownership: and that although, for Roman as for Greek, participation was not only the end, but also an integral part of the whole act of sacrifice. Need I refer to the Decian libelli? no special significance; at least no significance is made explicit. Warde Fowler, Religious Experience of the Roman Republic, 33 f. has remarked on the slight. ness of the importance attached by the Romans to blood. Sacroque cruore in Virg. Aen. V 333 is a mere phrase; the blood had been allowed to flow freely on the race- track; cf. p. 161 above.</page><page sequence="115">APPENDIX 3 (see page 160) DEITIES AND RITES OF AVERSION Isocrates V 117, by way of encouraging King Philip to beneficence, draws a contrast between the gods responsible for blessings and called Olympians, and the gods set over misfortunes and punishments and less agreeably named: to the first, he says, private individuals and cities erect temples and altars, while the second are not honored in prayers and sacrifices, but we perform ceremonies to keep them away (apopompai). What is this second category? Probably Hecate, the Erinyes (when not made kindly), figures seldom worshipped like Hades (Soph. Aj. 607) or hardly ever like Thanatos: perhaps also vague powers not strictly deified, e.g. the entourage of Hecate, and again alastores (avenging spirits: this word is name or epithet), the keres, the strinx (0. Weinreich, Gebet u. Wunder, 12 n. = Genethliakon W. Schmid, 178 n.), or something like Envy or the evil eye, as they later appear in Roman texts. They were powers that could harm or punish (cf. the warning to the jury in Antiphon I 31): you placated them when necessary, but you kept your dealings with them at a minimum. There may well be a somewhat wider implication. Ceremonies to avert evil are a normal part of worship (Theophrast. ap. Porph. Abst. II 24) but could easily assume a sinister aspect: Porph. Abst. II 44 speaks of purification after them. They can in a measure project something of this character upon the deities to whom they are directed, even though these deities are invoked as protectors. Apo- tropaios and apotropos have a double sense, 'averting' and 'to be averted' (so Suidas s.v. arorpOraLos). After all, you were asking such deities to remove something, &amp;rowroyrit,, orotLolro/Arri e0a, airo- rportaobs, etc., not to come with blessing. 'Averting' is parallel to the propitiation of the anger of deities (cf. Plut. Fab. 18 rpb s Xaaobus Oewv i7 rephTWr arorporwds). Such action, like purifications, continued to be a familiar type of ritual proceeding (cf. P. Tebt. 140, for an actual instance in 792 B.c.: Ptol. Tetrab. 1 3. 16 p. 32 Robbins and Cat. codd. astrol. V i, 211 for the generic type. Astrological texts give considerable evidence for belief in demoniac possession and for states of religious anxiety. Cf. also Plut. Is. Os. 30 f. pp. 362 E, 363 B on rites directed to Typhon). The implications were the more sinister when you propitiated Hecate as queen of the world of darkness (cf. Herbert Scholz, Der Hund in der griechisch-rtimischen Magie u. Re- ligion, Diss. Berlin 1937, 40 ff.), or Hermes chthonios and the Eumen-</page><page sequence="116">172 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW ides as representatives of the offended dead (Phlegon, Mirabilia, 1. The character of the act is not changed by the fact that the king's representative was on this occasion bidden to sacrifice to Hermes, Zeus Xenios, and Ares). This will explain the narrow range frequently ascribed (e.g. in Plut. Q. Cony. VII 6, p. 708 F) to apotropaioi, in spite of the wider application of the epithet (n. 67: cf. also J. W. Hewitt, Harv. Stud. Class. Phil. XIX, 1908, 109 ff.; ibid. 107 f. he gives parallels for the statement of Isocrates from which we started). We may compare what Cornutus says about Hecate (ch. 34, p. 72 f. Lang), probably on the basis of Apollodorus (cf. fr. 109 f. in Jacoby, Fragm. d. gr. Hist., II, no. 244, p. 1073 f.). Apollodorus shows a clear understanding of the dual aspect of deities, fr. 97, p. 1060 f., and fr. 10Q, p. 1065 (the Styx is in itself destructive; the gods are not in intentions and disposition). We have probably lost much in the sixth book of his treatise Concerning the gods, in which he discussed wrowo/rato. oo01 (fr. 93, p. 1045; cf. Jacoby, Komm. 763 f.). Hecate, like other deities concerned, had her different side (p. 161, above; n. 78; Plut. Is. Os. 44, p. 368 E): and, in spite of outbursts, in momentary fear or panic or loss, against gods or the gods, the Greeks have no category of divinities generally recognized as essentially malignant, no real Devil or devils such as Ahriman came to be (Nock, J. Rom. Stud., XXX, 1940, 194 f.). Plut. Is. Os. 46, p. 369 E is a vivid instance of something foreign. Plutarch in his De Superstitione speaks of fear as directed towards the gods in general and not towards one category; so did Epicurus earlier. Does not Pausanias observe (I 28. 6) that there is nothing terrifying about the images of the Semnai or the representations of other underworld deities in the sanctuary of the first at Athens? It is instructive to look at the long list of deities addressed in the so-called Orphic Hymns. The Erinyes are mentioned as with real fear (69); there is some such feeling towards Keraunios Zeus, (19), Nereus (23), Korybas (39; invoked to avert his anger and all ghostly perils), Ares (65), and Meilinoe (71; she is asked to show a kindly face), and the Titans are addressed with mild deprecation (37 7-8 as interpreted by H. J. Rose, J. Hell. Stud. LV, 1935, 260; they are theoretical figures). Yet even Thanatos, though asked to come late, is invoked as though kindly (87), and Hermes chthonios is requested to give the initiates a good end (57), while Hecate is placed first (1), and she and her equivalent Antaia (41; cf. 2 to Prothyraia, invoked for aid in childbirth and for deliverance. Wilamowitz, Glaube, I 171 n. 1 regards 1 and 2 as constituting one hymn), and Pluto (18), and Persephone (29) and the Eumenides (70) are invoked to be present or to come. Again, Artemidorus, in dis- cussing the significance in dreams of theoi chthonioi (II 34, p. 131,</page><page sequence="117">THE CULT OF HEROES 173 and 39 p. 144 f.) clearly does not regard them as constituting a hostile group. Anything that looks like dualism in this area is a matter either of the associations of apotropaic ritual or of a theoretical systematiza- tion. We have seen earlier (p. 163) how Pythagoreans occupied themselves with the elaboration of the distinction between Olympians and others, and the name of the school is associated with lists of op- posites. So Diogenes Laertius VIII 32 quotes as theirs a doctrine that the air is full of souls regarded as daimones and heroes, that these send dreams, signs, and diseases, and that purifications, apo- tropaic rites, and divination are addressed to them. This is clearly based on the ideas of Plato Symp. 202 E. Even here the daimones are not like the beings described by Isocrates: the ceremonies are directed towards them, but they are not themselves averted, and the beneficent art of divination is coupled with these grimmer rites.</page><page sequence="118">APPENDIX 4 (see page 162) THEOPHRASTUS ON THE CONTRAST BETWEEN JEWISH AND GREEK SACRIFICE J. Bernays, Theophrastos' Schrift tiber Froimmigkeit, 111 ff., saw that this, though exaggerated, was a natural contrast between the regular tamid offering of a lamb in the Temple every morning and afternoon on the one hand and the infrequence of holocaust in Greece on the other. His discussion is classic and there is little to change in his results save that we should prefer Jaeger's inference, Diokles v. Karystos, 134 ff. that Theophrastus depended on a written source, probably Hecataeus of Abdera, rather than on information obtained by word of mouth. May I add one observation? The ascription of holocaust alone to the Jews need not be regarded as a blunder of Theophrastus or of Hecateus and may be exactly what a Jewish in- formant of the latter said. The daily sacrifice already mentioned was, for a Jew in Alexandria and even for many in Palestine, the most interesting and important part of the whole regular ritual. Oracula Sibyllina III 573 ff., which is with reason ascribed to an Alexandrian Jew of about 140 B.c. (Rzach in Pauly-Wissowa II A 2125 ff.), prophe- sies the advent of a holy race of pious men who will glorify great God's temple with libations and incense, yes and with holy hecatombs, with the offering of goodly oxen and full-grown rams, consuming by fire (6XoKapwrebovres) fat sheep and rams in holy fashion on a great altar. There is here reference to other forms of sacrifice, but the emphasis is on the regular daily holocaust. So we have 'holocausts and sacrifices' in 1 Mace. 1. 45, 1 Sam. 15. 2 (Mark 12. 33): cf. R. H. Charles, Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha, II 828, xiv 1, and again Strack-Billerbeck, Komm. z. N. T., II 550 for the rise of the idea that the sacrifice of peace offering was generally made as a burnt offering.</page></plain_text>
