<plain_text><page sequence="1">74 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW CRETAN EXCAVATIONS. WHAT was the Aegean race ? or should we not rather say perhaps what were the races that built up what is now often called the 'Aegean civilisation'? Where did they come from? what are their connexions with other early civilisations? The question is still unanswered, though the material for forming an opinion is fast piling up. Since 1900 Dr. Evans' excavations in Crete have shifted the centre of interest from the mainland to the Aegean, and rendered necessary a name of wider import than 'Mycenaean,' which has come to be associated with that phase of Cretan civilisa- tion which just precedes its close. Knossos remains the chief store-house of information, though its evidence is now supported and gaps supplied from half a dozen other Cretan sites and from the Cyclades, whose civilisation has now been brought into line with that of Crete. In Knossos Dr. Evans reconstructs a continuous Bronze Age civilisation, which he calls 'Minoan' (itself superimposed on neolithic foundations more than 20o feet deep in parts), which lasted roughly from the fifth millennium B.C. till the middle of the second; after which comes a period of partial reoccupation of the site, and then a blank. The place was seemingly taboo and was left untouched for centuries. These three millenniums which Dr. Evans, basing his classification' chiefly on the pot- tery, has divided into three periods, called respectively Early, Middle and Late Minoan (each of which is again subdivided into three). Within their compass he traces the rise and fall of a race whose art is so fresh and lively that thirty years ago, when the traces of this' or a kindred people were first found by Dr. Schliemann at Tiryns and Mycenae and Hissarlik, it was sometimes characterised as 'Greek,' though in the light of fuller discovery certain salient character- istics of Greek art are now rather called 'Aegean' or ' Minoan ' or' Pelasgian' accord- ing to the terminology preferred. In the Early Minoan periods, the hand- burnished black ware with white incised pattern of the neolithic age is replaced by pottery with painted design of simple geometric pattern, either light on a dark background or dark on light. Towards their close appear fiddle-shaped figurines similar to those of the Cycladic civilisation, as seen in the first city of Phylakopi2 (Melos), or again in the second city of Hissarlik; and seals displaying the earliest pictographs.3 To Middle Minoan i belong the curiously modern 'Queen Elizabeth' figurines,4 with Medici collars, high-pointed caps and bell- shaped skirts, found by Mr. J. L. Myres at Petsofa near Palaikastro, where red and orange form a new colour scheme with black and white. Polychrome is used too on vases, and curvilinear design appears side by side with geometric forms.5 In Middle Minoan 2 is placed the Early Palace,6 though certain pits and monoliths may well belong to a still earlier structure. The portico to the S.W., the West Court and Theatral Area with stepped seats for the spectators, are all closely paralleled in the Palace of Phaestos 7 (excavated by Prof. Halbherr and the Italian School), which belongs to this period, though the existing court in Knossos, while following older lines, with the conservatism that recurs again and again in Cretan building types, is actually of a later time. This is the period of 'Kamares' 8 ware, called from the cave of that name in Mount Ida where it was first found, which comprises a dainty egg- shell fabric, sometimes with repouss6 design, suggesting a metal prototype.

This bloom-time was cut short by some catastrophe, after which the art recovers slowly till it reaches the fine work of Middle Minoan 3. To Middle Minoan 3 belongs the earlier stage of the Later Palace (Later Pal. i), whose outlines Dr. Evans is recovering year by year. It is contemporary with the earliest shaft-grave finds from Mycenae. Its art was inspired by a remarkable feeling for natur- alism. Dr. Evans notes it in the freshness and simplicity of the fresco of the blue boy gathering the wild Cretan crocus;' and in the natural forms of the vase painter, who, more limited in his range of colours than the fresco painter, fell back on monochrome, and gives us the lily 2-flower, stalk, leaves and all--in white on a dull purplish ground. We see it too in such work as the tender group of the agrimi3 and her young in a delicate faience of greyish green and soft half tints, and probably also in the exquisite art of the small ivory figure of a leaping youth.4 Pictographs give place to a linear script,5 not confined to scratches on clay tablets, but used in a cursive style to sign a cup in what was certainly ink and with what was probably a reed pen. This is modernity. This period ended like its predecessor in a catastrophic convulsion, which in great measure destroyed the Palace. Crete was evidently a great trading centre, having frequent intercourse with Egypt; and it is the correlation of Cretan with Egyptian finds that has made it possible to give ap- proximate dates to the different phases of Minoan civilisation. But the limits of this Middle Minoan period are hardly fixed at present. Dr. Evans dated it tentatively at 3000-1800o B.c., roughly dating the Kamares ware of Middle Minoan 2, from its presence in Egypt in deposits ascribed to the xii. dynasty; which synchronism has quite recently received remarkable confirmation in Professor Garstang's discovery of a closed Egyptian tomb of the xii. dynasty at Abydos, containing together with cylinders of Senu- sert ii. and Amenemhat iii. a beautiful specimen of a Cretan polychrome vessel of the Kamares ware of Middle Minoan 2.6 But the limits of the xii. dynasty are them- selves by no means fixed. The interval between the end of the xii. dynasty and the beginning of the xviii. (i580 B.c.), when there is a further point of contact with Cretan art of Late Minoan 2, is at this moment variously estimated by Egyptologists at 985, 208 and 1666 years, which affords an un- comfortably elastic margin of difference. It is quite possible that the end of Middle Minoan 3 may have to come down as far as 1700 B.C. Late Minoan i, beginning possibly in 800oo, occupies some 250 years, during which period the great Palace was rebuilt and ex- tended (Later Pal. 2), and Late Minoan 2 closes before 1400 B.C. with its destruction. The full measure of this Palace has not yet been taken. Year by year Dr. Evans thinks to bring his work of excavation to an end, and an expectant public ventures to entertain hopes of the publication of his book; and each year new areas for work reveal them- selves. In a letter to the Times of July 15, 1907, Dr. Evans describes the amazing results of last summer's work, which include the discovery of a large new palace area to the S.W., where 'according to all foregone conclusions no palace should have been'; a huge, primitive beehive tomb, full of sherds belonging to Middle Minoan i, and the site of a shrine of a type7 familiar through many representations on seals and frescoes. Already the area comprises a vast com- plexus of rooms and passages, built round a Central Court with an entrance to the N., whence the road leads to the old harbour, IB.S.A. vi. described p. 45. 2B.S.A. viii. p. 91. fig. 51. 3B.S.A. ix.

Half a mile to the N. is the Late Minoan cemetery of Zafer Papoura. To the W. is a second Court with the Theatral Area in its N.W. corner, whence a paved way leads W. again to the 'little Palace' 300 yards away. To the E. where the ground slopes to the river, the Palace rose to the height of five storeys, and the great stairway is still in situ. To the S. is a second entrance nearly facing that to the N. To the N.E. lies the 'Royal Villa,' the prototype of the house of the archon basileus at Athens and again of the Roman basilica. With its halls, workshops, magazines and living rooms, its provision for public and private, secular and religious life, the Palace of the ' Priest Kings' of Knossos was almost a city in itself. Its walls are of limestone foundations with rubble or clay above, coated with plaster or faced with gypsum, not brick as in East Crete; the inner walls carried gay frescoes. It is characteristic of this Palace and of that at Phaestos that there is no central hearth as in the 'Mycenean' palaces at Tiryns and Mycenae and in the late Aegean type at Haghia Triada (near Phaestos)1 and Phylakopi,2 developed perhaps under main- land influences. The halls were heated by moveable braziers and lighted by 'light- wells,' an unroofed space at the back or side, with hard cemented floors and a drain to carry off the rain-water, which was connected with that elaborate system of drainage on scientific lines which modern Europe has only lately rivalled. In the western portion, serving presumably as the substructure of an upper storey of living rooms, were the magazines containing the great pithoi or jars of Alibaba dimensions, where corn and oil were stored, with cists in the floors dating from the days of the Early Palace, which may once have been treasuries, but in the latest Palace were closed and made shallower to serve as receptacles for oil; and the throne room, with its grey gypsum throne in a niche, and frescoes with Nilotic design of sedges and wingless griffins, and a tank which may have served as an impluvium or a light well. In the eastern portion is the group of living rooms that Dr. Evans calls the Hall of the Double Axes and the Queen's Megaron, with the domestic quarters overhead. In the frescoes of this period of the Cup- bearer,3 the dancing ladies and others,4 we have grown familiar with the dark-haired, slender-waisted Cretan type, whose long- haired men wear loin-cloth and belt and high boots, and whose ladies, with un- naturally brilliant lips and heads elaborately coiffed, wear tight-fitting, low-necked bodices and frilled and flounced skirts. The art of Late Minoan I finds striking illustration in the gaming board 5 of gold and silver, crystal and ivory and blue glass paste, (the kuanos of Homer), and in the black steatite vase6 found recently at Haghia Triada, representing in relief a company of Cretan harvesters, armed with flail and scythe and reaping-pad (though some would call them soldiers), preceded by a figure in what may be a priestly cope (though again some say a coat of mail), and accompanied by an open-mouthed Egyptian, who rattles a sistrum while he sings. The pottery still reproduces natural forms drawn from sea and country; but in Late Minoan 2 the grasses and plants and shells are growing stylised and in the 'Palace style'7 of conventional design, where lustrous brown-black pattern on a polished buff-clay slip, showing dark on light, is gaining the ascendancy, we come into line with some of the 'best Mycenaean' types of the mainland. There is one feature of the Palace, occur- ring here and elsewhere in Crete and also in Phylakopi, that undoubtedly belongs to the most primitive times, but is consciously reproduced in the later. It is the large single pillar, sometimes but not always serving as a structural support, but originally at least of religious import as the habitat of 1 B.S.A. xi. p. 220, fig. 4. 2 Excavations in Phylakobi, p. 56, fig. 49. 3Monthly Rev.

The sacred pillar1 or tree of Crete finds its analogue in the bethel or ashera of the Semites, and both may derive from a common origin rather than from adoption or imitation on the one side or the other. In the aniconic stage of religion other objects too served as the habitat of deity, notably at Knossos the double axe which, with or without the 'horns of consecration '(paral- leled again by the Hebrew 'horns of the altar'), occurs repeatedly in the Palace, in miniature in the little shrine, and engraved on gems and painted in frescoes in ritual scenes. Whether the double axe engraved on the monoliths and on the walls of the 'Hall of the Double Axes' and elsewhere has the same ritual signification or is only a builder's mark-it occurs as one of the signs of the pictographic script-is still undetermined, as also whether we are to connect the Carian word Ad/3pv3, double axe, with the word labyrinth, and see in the labyrinth of legend, which Dr. Evans identifies with the intricate palace of Minos, simply the House of the Double Axe. As the aniconic stage yielded to anthropomorphism representations occur, crudely fashioned in the round as idols and with greater freedom upon gems2 and walls, of a goddess, seated on her sacred stone or under her sacred tree, guarded by heraldic lions and accompanied by the symbol of the double axe. This goddess seems to have re- tained her supremacy throughout the range of this civilisation, differentiated sometimes by the attribute of the snake3 as a chthonic deity, sometimes by the dove4 as a sky-descended spirit. With her is associated in ritual a god who shares the double axe, but who, whether as son or husband, remains subordinate, until after many years this Southern civilisation broke up before the downward movements of the Aryan Northmen with their supreme god Zeus, and that fusion of ritual and religious conceptions took place, which resulted in the differentiation of the primitive Cretan nature goddess into various Greek goddesses and in the old Greek stories of an infant Zeus born in Crete of Mother Rhea, who became paramount over an older order; though in some districts of the South and East the supremacy of Zeus was never very strong, and when his religion gave way in turn to Christian influences, the old primitive feeling resurged in the dominance of the Virgin Mother over the Christ, which persists to this day in certain parts of Asia Minor.5 In Cretan ritual the bull figures largely as a sacrificial beast (there is a representation of a bull-sacrifice with double axe and horns of consecration on an unpublished larnax from Phaestos),6 and perhaps also as the very god 7 to whom the sacrifice was made. The bull's head in gesso duro8 is a spirited, vigorous piece of Later Palace work; and bull-fights and bull-catching are among the liveliest scenes represented in their art. One of the steatite vases9 found at Haghia Triada has, in addition to boxing scenes, a bull-snaring in relief, which, when coated with gold leaf, must have closely resembled the Vaphio cups of beaten gold, which may themselves have come from a Cretan workshop. The bull- ring is shown in a lively fresco,10 not yet published, where a cowboy and cow-girls, clad alike in the national loin-cloth and distinguishable only by the conventional red flesh for men and white for women, are engaged in acrobatic feats, or more probably in a dangerous struggle with a bull. This was conceivably the lot of the prisoners of Minos, and accounts for dark Athenian tales of human tribute to a Minotaur in the days of Minoan thalassocracy, till their own hero Theseus mastered the intricacies of the labyrinth and slew the monster with the help of Ariadne the king's daughter, whose marri- age with Theseus it has been suggested may point to a racial tie between the Cretans and Athenians, or again to a moment when the ' J.H.S. xxi.

Homer 1 tells how Daedalus made a 'dancing place in wide Knossos for lovely- haired Ariadne.' Are we to seek this in the little Theatral Area, where ritual dances, not unlike the mazy Cretan peasant dance of to- day, may conceivably have been performed ? Such a scene seems to be represented in the miniature frescoes, not yet published, which show dancers performing before a crowd of onlookers. And is this Ariadne (the very holy one) no other than the Cretan goddess herself ? For detailed accounts of the work that has been done in Knossos, in Phaestos and in East Crete we must still turn to the original articles by the excavators and others scattered up and down specialist periodicals both English and foreign, notably the Annual of the British School at Athens (B.S.A.), vols. vi.-xii., the Hellenic Journal (J.H.S.), Monu- menti Antichi, vols. xii. and xiv., and the publications of the American School of Archeology. But their work has been ably summarised by Prof. Burrows in his Dis- coveries in Crete, published last year. The book lacks illustrations; but their absence is an inducement to turn for these, with the help of its admirable bibliography, to the original publications; or to supplement the reading of the book by a visit to Dr. Evans' collection of Cretan specimens and replicas in the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford, un- rivalled in interest except by the museum at Candia. The civilisation of this dark-haired, wasp- waisted race is growing daily more familiar, and still the riddle of the race remains unread. The burial finds of early periods are still scanty, but Dr. Duckworth, reinforced by Mr. C. H. Hawes, shows that the cranio- logical evidence as far as it goes points to a race mainly dolichocephalic, but with some admixture from the first of a brachycephalic type." This suggests that there was not one race only to be accounted for. In any case the relations of the 'Aegean' people and the primitive population of East Crete, called Eteocretans, are still to be defined. The civilisation has been ascribed to Aryan and non-Aryan, Semitic and non-Semitic sources; to Phoenicians and to Carians, to Pelasgians and Achaeans. The Cretan script no doubt contains the clue, but though affinities are found with Egyptian, Hittite, Phoenician and Cyprian script, the script itself remains unread and its language un- discovered. There is however a growing consensus of opinion in favour of a non- Aryan and non-Semitic origin, whose source has so far been mainly sought in Asia; but Dr. Mackenzie, following lines already in- dicated by Dr. Evans, supports another view. In an interesting article in B.S.A. xii. on 'Cretan Palaces' he argues convincingly in favour of Africa as the home of the various races who have covered the Mediterranean shores and islands with the civilisation that we call 'Aegean.' In Cretans, Carians, Pelasgians, and also seemingly the people that made the highly artistic Neolithic vases of S. Russia, he sees non-Semitic and non- Aryan, pre-Hellenic peoples who exhibit kinship, not identity. He refers the common characteristics of clothes, palaces and art of the Aegean islands and the mainland to West and East to a common source in the pre- dynastic Libyan people of the Nile valley, and their differences to variations induced by varying habits and climatic conditions as the race moved north. Startling as it may appear at the first moment, the loin-cloth and belt of the pre-dynastic Egyptian is persuasively shown to be the direct ancestor of the modish costume of the 'Parisiennes' of the Cretan frescoes. Their decollete bodice is the first stage in the evolution, not the last in the decadence of the body garment, and the elaborate flounced skirts are but the repetition at varying lengths of the original loin-cloth, of which the belted panier of the Petsofh figurines is an intermediate stage. The man's dress remained little altered to the end. The mainland type of Palace too, with its central hearth in a closed megaron, is attributed not to the amalgamation of the Northern with the Southern type as by Noack,3 but to a modification of the Southern type of megaron due to colder climate as the race moved up. Under stress of similar con- ditions of climate the Southern megaron 11Z. xviii. 591. 2B.S.A. xi. p. 297 and ix. p. 353. 3 Homerische Palhiste.</page><page sequence="6">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 79 unconsciously assimilated itself to the narrow- fronted single room megaron of the North, which itself no doubt grew common later on, as the successive waves of the fair-haired Aryan Achaeans and Hellenes and other kindred tribes from the North superposed their ruder civilisation on the older and more artistic civilisation of the South. This view seems at least to have far more to recommend it than the counter theory that we must look to the North itself as the source of the Aegean civilisation.
