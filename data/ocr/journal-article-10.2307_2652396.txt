Gottingen: Van- denhoeck und Ruprecht. 1997. Pp. 443. Yes, the master narrative is definitely dead, at least judging from Olaf Blaschke's treatment of Catholic anti-Semitism in the German Empire, which consists of 360 pages of topical analysis without a narrative of any sort. Almost wholly missing from this monograph are the historical struggles, the clash of personalities, the interplay between earthly and spiritual motives that gave German Catholicism its characteristic con- tours. Instead we are dropped into a nearly seamless Catholic "milieu," dissected with the aid of seven theses, three anti-Semitic macrostereotypes, seven ste- reotype groups, five functions for anti-Semitism, three Hochphasen, and seven working hypotheses. Preferring the static finished product to the devel- opmental process, Blaschke teeters perilously close to the teleological. He ascribes to nameless "milieu man- agers," an undifferentiated church hierarchy, and an all but homogenous Center Party great powers of discernment and foresight and a considerable knack for Machiavellian manipulation. At times, sweeping generalizations depict an anthropomorphic "Catholi- cism" that knows what it wants, where it has to go, and what nefarious stratagem it must pursue to get there. The end result is the author's presentation of a Catholic milieu deeply tainted at all levels and in all regions of the country by an anti-Semitism only slightly less pernicious, but far more damaging, than that practiced by the small, feckless, anti-Semitic political parties of the era. Blaschke rejects any suggestion that party or church should be viewed as less infected by anti-Semitism than other elements of German society or that they deserve to be congratulated for their rejection of anti-Semitic extremism. This is not as new an idea as Blaschke would like his readers to believe. (He rather grudgingly acknowl- edges the beginning of a revisionist view in the work of David Blackbourn, Helmut W. Smith, and James Har- ris but refers to them infrequently in his exposition.) What is new in this work is the repeated insistence that the milieu was essentially a monolith, a closed system AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW FEBRUARY 2001</page><page sequence="2">Europe. Early Modern and Modemn 279 in which anti-Semitism played an essential role for more than a century. Despite Blaschke's polemical tone and ungenerous judgments of previous scholarship, there is much of interest and value here. For example, the author is right to warn against too narrow a focus in the study of Catholic anti-Semitism in Germany. Limiting attention to the Center Party's behavior in the Reichstag will produce a distorted picture of the reality. By investi- gating the local and regional press, associational liter- ature, clerical journals, and a wealth of other sources, Blaschke is able to paint a considerably darker picture than those of us who have not done as thorough a job as he. Building on an extraordinarily diligent reading of published materials, he argues that Catholic identity formation resorted to anti-Semitism in reaction to an increasingly threatening world. The response to the Edgardo Mortara affair, the Syllabus of Errors, and the outrage over the doctrine of papal infallibility served to create and then entrench ultramontane solidarity. Once ultramontanism discovered the utility of anti-Semitism, it could not dispense with it; the two became inextricable. It was not the material conflicts between Catholics and Jews or the vastly exaggerated role of Jews in the Kulturkampf but rather the "ghetto mentality" of Cath- olics that led them to tar their critics within and without as either Jews, their dupes, or their willing tools. Materialism and modernity, loss of faith, a heartless capitalism, cultural depravity-all these were laid at the feet of the Jews by clergy, politicians, writers of devotional literature, and a far-flung, effective Catholic press. Blaschke claims a broad-based attempt to instill hatred and suspicion of Jews among all the faithful, and he provides convincing documentation to support this view. Certainly, various elements within German Cathol- icism practiced an anti-Semitism that went well beyond anti-Judaism or the venting of unremarkable anti- Jewish prejudices. Catholics wrote, preached, and ag- itated against Jews for a wide variety of political purposes; they resorted to their own brand of "better anti-Semitism" to achieve political mobilization and as a standing argument against movements and trends they found to be un-Christian. Blaschke will not grant Catholics a superior form of anti-Semitism, but he recognizes qualitative differences between them and the professional anti-Semitic politicians and ideo- logues. For Catholic purveyors, anti-Semitism always remained just one weapon among many, neither the only arrow in their quivers nor the sharpest. They gave little support to exceptional legislation aimed at Jews, shying away from the kind of laws that victimized them during the Kulturkampf. They rarely indulged in the sole-guilt-of-the-Jews rhetoric that was standard for the anti-Semitic political parties. And, in fact, they almost never advocated doing anything specific against Jews. Re-Catholicization, a return to Christian values, would automatically solve the Jewish question (and also the Protestant and Freemason questions). In a truly Christian society, Jews would find it impossible to spread their poison. This was ugly but a far cry from the call to disen- franchise Jews, or worse. Yet Blaschke remains reso- lutely unimpressed by the differences and evidences an unseemly need to condemn Catholicism root and branch. Catholics who spoke out against Jew-hatred, the Center Party that stood against the programatic demands of the anti-Semitic parties, and clergymen who rejected racist fanaticism-these count for noth- ing. Self-interest, pure and simple, not brotherly love or equity, explains these rare deviations from the milieu mentality. Instead of putting such acts in his- torical perspective, Blaschke belittles them by de- manding of Catholics a standard of altruistic purity in the defense against anti-Semitism that no party or group could live up to, not even the Jews who were most affected. The reader will have to get past this special pleading in order to derive the full benefits of Blaschke's scholarship. RICHARD S. LEVY University of Illinois</page></plain_text>
