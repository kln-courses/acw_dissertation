<plain_text><page sequence="1">Thoughts Addressed to an Analytical Thomist* I cannot claim to be an "Analytical Thomist" for two reasons: first, I am a practicing Jew, and Thomism is a philosophical tradition within the Roman Catholic Church. (Perhaps I could be an "Analytic Maimonidean"?) But not only do I philosophize within a different religious tradition than Thomists do, there is also the fact that my own approach to philosophy is, I think, quite different. My purpose here, however, is not to reject Analy tical Thomism, or even to criticize it, but rather to enter into a dialogue with it. Thus, even if I do not put the remarks that follow in the form of questions, they are intended in a sense as a set of questions (of the form: "What do you think of this?") addressed to those who do consider them selves to be Analytical Thomists. I shall organize these remarks around two topics: (1) the question of "proving the existence of God"; and (2) the question of "predication with respect to God". "Proving" the existence of God "Can one prove the existence of God?" seems to me less a clear question than a tangle of questions which are rarely if ever sorted out and carefully distinguished. To most secular (i.e., atheist) philosophers who consider the question at all, the question seems clear and the answer seems all too obvious: the traditional (e.g., Aquinas' or Maimonides') "proofs of the existence of God" are one and all fallacious, and the very idea of proving the existence of God is absurd. Moreover, the majority of these philosophers take it to be quite clear what a "proof is: a demonstration that something is the case using the standards (or supposed standards) of, if not science, then, let us say, analytic philosophy. In addition, it is supposed that a sound proof ought to be able to convince any rational person who sees it. (Why the arguments of analytic philosophers them selves?not even the philosophical, as opposed to technical logical, arguments of Frege, or Russell, or Quine, or Davidson, or David Lewis?

Copyright? 1997, THE MONIST, La Salle, Illinois 61301.</page><page sequence="2">488 hilary putnam all fail to meet this test is not something that analytical philosophers discuss a great deal.) Of course I cannot in this short space do what I just called for, that is disentangle and carefully distinguish all the strands of the nest of ques tions hidden in the seemingly simple question, "Can one prove the exis tence of God?". (Perhaps there is no limit to the number of strands that could be distinguished.) Instead, I will respond to the familiar secular answer to the question just mentioned (and the construal of the question that it presupposes). The view that the traditional proofs are fallacious rests, I think, on a straw-man idea of what those proofs are. As readers of this issue of The Monist are likely to know, each one of those proofs can be put into a form which is clearly valid (although the premisses, are, of course, nowadays controversial). For example, the causal argument for the existence of God does not, as has often been supposed (even by some medievals) presup pose that an infinite temporal regress of causes [a sequence . . . A_3, A_2, A_!, Aq, such that for each natural number , A_(n +1} is the cause of and prior in time to A_n] is a logical impossibility.1 Of course the arguments have premisses that are unacceptable to an atheist; but the idea that they are one and all invalid, that they proceed by invalid reasoning from their premisses, is just wrong. Indeed, each of the traditional proofs can be stated in a form in which it proceeds validly from its premisses (ones which an atheist cannot of course accept, but which, I shall argue, are not simply question-begging). To take the causal proof as an example. It is quite true that there is no logical contradiction in the idea of a universe in which there is an infinite regress of causes backwards in time. However, from the point of view of the philosopher who accepts the causal proof (e.g., Aquinas, or Maimonides) that entire sequence, and indeed the entire physical universe of which the mereological sum of ... . A_3, A_2, A_b Aq is a proper part, is itself a paradigm case of an utterly contingent being. But (as Immanuel Kant recognized), even if it goes beyond what we have come to call "sci entific thinking" to apply this to the universe as a whole, there is something in the human mind itself that makes us want to think that there is a cause for anything whose existence is contingent (and ultimately makes us want to posit an "unconditioned" cause for everything that is "conditioned," to put it in Kantian language). Properly stated (although I</page><page sequence="3">THOUGHTS ADDRESSED TO AN ANALYTICAL THOMIST 489 will not do it here),2 that intuition can be expressed as a formal premiss from which (with appropriate additional premisses) the existence of a Self-caused Cause can be derived (although the argument I have in mind is far from trivial). Needless to say, the "Proof does not yield the existence of a Being with all of God's "attributes"; but it does yield?for one who accepts the premisses!?the existence of a Necessary Being (in the sense of a Being which is its own sufficient ground for existence) of everything that is contingent. Certainly, this is not a "proof in the (absurd) sense of an argument which will convince everyone who reads it, for the very simple reason that the premisses will not be accepted univer sally; it does nevertheless do a certain service?a service, I think, which even the atheist should grant?namely the service of bringing out one source of our present idea of God,3 a source which is deep in a very natural conception of reason itself. The fact that one philosopher felt that he had to end a book vigorously defending atheism4 with the words, "Still, why is there something rather than nothing?" testifies to the depth of this intellectual urge, or idea, or intuition, or whatever you want to call it. If anything, it was the triumph (at least in secular thought) after David Hume5 of the idea that there is nothing problematic about the idea that the universe as a whole should exist wholly contingently that represented an enormous break with what was long taken to be a fundamental principle of human reason as such. To repeat: in addition to rejecting the idea that the traditional proofs are "invalid," I reject the idea that they are simply "question begging." On the contrary, even if in the end you reject the view of reason which is implicit in the proofs?that is, the view according to which reason itself tells us that contingent existence requires a cause outside itself, and tells us, moreover, that there have to be necessities which are not simply "con ceptual"?you ought, I think, to recognize that that view of reason speaks to and expresses intuitions which are very deep in us (and the idea that those intuitions are ones which have been "refuted" by the modern scien tific way of thinking is one which deserves critical examination). What of the other element of the critique of the traditional proofs that I alluded to, namely that they do not produce universal assent (in the way in which, say, proofs in mathematics produce universal assent among those who understand them)? If Analytical Thomists agree with their secular critics that proofs of the existence of God ought to produce</page><page sequence="4">490 HILARY PUTNAM universal assent in this way (and I hope they don't), then I have to differ with them too, or rather I have to ask the question: "How are we to under stand the notion 'among those who understand them' in the religious case?". Two things seem obvious. First, in order to understand talk about God, whether or not that talk takes the form of a "proof," one must be able to understand the concept 'God'. But there are very different possible con ceptions of what it is to understand the concept 'God', in a way that has no analogue in the mathematical case. Secondly, even if one understands the concept 'God', to accept any of the traditional proofs one has to find a connection between that concept and the highly theoretical philosophi cal principles involved in those proofs, such as the ones just mentioned (about conditioned and unconditioned existence, and about what sorts of necessity there can be). Some of the most profound religious thinkers of the last hundred years have had no use at all for this sort of philosophiz ing; and I would be the last to say that they lacked the concept 'God'. What the traditional proofs of the existence of God in fact do is connect the concerns of two different salvific enterprises: the enterprise of ancient and medieval philosophy,6 which, after all, is the source of the materials for these proofs, and the enterprise of monotheistic religion. While it is certainly possible to have a deeply worthwhile religious attitude which combines these two elements?indeed, the effort to do so has contributed profoundly to Judaism as well as to Christianity and Islam?it is also possible to have a deeply fulfilling religious attitude while keeping far away from metaphysics. Speaking for myself, I would say that while I do conceive of God as a "transcendent Being," as a "necessary Being," as an "unconditioned ground for the existence of everything that is contingent," I feel that insofar as I have any handle on these notions, I have a handle on them as religious notions, not as notions which are supported by an in dependent philosophical theory. (Certainly not by the theory of Aristotle's Metaphysics.) For me the "proofs" show conceptual connections of great depth and significance, but they are not a foundation for my religious belief. (In spite of Maimonides' great prestige, they have never played a very important role in Jewish belief.) Nor are "proofs" the way in which I would try to bring someone else to Judaism, or to religious belief of any kind. Predication with respect to God I just remarked that there are many different conceptions of what it is to understand the concept 'God'. On some conceptions the concept</page><page sequence="5">THOUGHTS ADDRESSED TO AN ANALYTICAL THOMIST 491 'God' is straightforwardly definable in familiar terms: to be God is to be powerful, knowing, good, etc., without limit, where the terms "powerful" (i.e., able to bring about what one "wills"), "knowing" (i.e., having justified true beliefs7), etc., mean in the Divine case just what they do in the human case. But such conceptions have long been challenged by religious thinkers, including, of course, Alfarabi, Avicenna, Maimonides, and Aquinas. On my own view8 religious language and the languages of ordinary empirical description and scientific theorizing are, in a way, incommensu rable.9 The religious believer (qua religious believer) is not?or should not be?engaged in the prediction of empirical phenomena, and religious faith is not refuted by this or that empirical happening or scientific discovery. To suppose, as many people nowadays do, that "science has refuted religion," is to have a deeply confused understanding of what real religious belief is. As I emphasized in Renewing Philosophy (168ff.), this does not mean that religious belief is immune from criticism (although I am saying that one sort of criticism is utterly misguided). One may find what the believer says unintelligible: for instance, one may find that it violates one's sense of what life means; or one may find that religious belief has lost its hold on one (or one has lost one's hold on it), and it now appears as something strange and alien; but what one should not do is claim that one's view, whatever it is, is mandated by "present day science".10 Nor? or so I argued in Renewing Philosophy?should one hope that philosophy of language, or analytic philosophy, will be able to tell one whether religious language makes sense and, if so, what sort of sense it makes. There is simply no uncommitted place to stand with respect to the religious dimension of human life.11 This thought was beautifully expressed to me as long ago as 1960 by Elizabeth Anscombe, when, in the course of a conversation, she compared the difference between the atheist view of religion and the view of the believer to the difference between "seeing the stained glass windows from the outside and seeing them from the inside." But the fact that religious language is in this way incommensurable with ordinary descriptive language does not mean that it is simply a self-enclosed "language game." On the contrary, as Cora Diamond has written, criticizing this very idea, "The questioning expressed in [great religious questions] is anyone's; the possibility of such questions belongs to language itself, and not to any</page><page sequence="6">492 HILARY PUTNAM particular language game. The tendency to ask them does not depend on any form of life other than speech itself; it is as much something primitive, something given. ... as responding to other people (and indeed found in small children)."12 Putting together these remarks?Elizabeth Anscombe's and Cora Diamond's?I am inclined to say something like this: that while the po tentiality for religious language, the possibility of making it one's own, is a basic human potentiality, the exercise of that potentiality is not a real possibility for every human being at every time. For some human beings it seems never to be a possibility (although something deeply spiritual in them may find another mode of expression). I myself believe that it requires something experiential and not merely intellectual to awaken that possibility in a human being. Indeed, if I met a person who had been a diehard atheist, and who one fine day came to believe in God simply on the basis of a metaphysical argument, I do not know what I should think. It could be, of course, that the metaphysical argument was simply the trigger that released something deeper. But what if the belief in God were simply a belief in the strength of a certain philosophical argument? (As David Lewis claims to firmly believe in the existence of real possible but not-actual worlds on the basis of a philosophical argument?) On the sup position that that is all that was going on, I would say that this was not belief in God at all, but a metaphysical illusion. To say that there is this sort of gap between what the believer means and understands and what the secular critic thinks he means and under stands, does not, of course, mean that no fruitful dialogue between a religious thinker and a secular thinker is possible. It may be perfectly ap propriate for an atheist philosopher and a religious philosopher to explore together the arguments that each offers. Indeed, it seems to me an important task, not just for religious philosophers but for religious intel lectuals generally, and one that John Haldane performs extremely well, to try to show secular philosophers of a so-called "naturalist" bent that their attempted "naturalizations" (i.e., reductions) of such notions as "inten tionality," "causality," "justification," "truth," are failures in their own terms. In the same way, it is appropriate for a secular thinker to try to convince a religious thinker that some of his or her views are indefensible in the thinker's own terms. But that is a very different thing from trying to explain what it means to be religious in a purely intellectual way.</page><page sequence="7">THOUGHTS ADDRESSED TO AN ANALYTICAL THOMIST 493 I titled this section "Predication with respect to God," and what do these remarks have to do with that ancient topic? They have everything to do with it, for the following reason: even if Haldane, or I, or someone else could succeed in convincing someone as intelligent and honest as J. J. C. Smart13 that his views on the topics just cited ("intentionality," "causality," "justification," "truth") do not work, that the world is myste rious in a way that he has tried to deny,14 still that thinker, as long as belief in God remains something external, as long as he or she sees the stained glass windows from the outside, will feel that the notion 'God' is too prob lematic to represent a possible way out of any intellectual problem?feel, indeed, that it is only dubiously intelligible. There is an enormous gap between anything one could "show" the atheist philosopher by arguments he must accept from his own standpoint (and even the idea that one can do that is tremendously optimistic, of course), and belief in God. And the atheist's feeling that the concept 'God' is problematic is not without good reasons. For once the monotheistic religions passed?irreversibly, I believe?from thinking of God in anthropomorphic terms to thinking of God as a transcendent being, the notion of God did become deeply para doxical. (Not that it was not paradoxical before!, but that the paradoxical character of the notion became more profound, as most religious thinkers recognized.) Not all religious thinkers agree that it is paradoxical. A few years ago a distinguished Christian philosopher told me that he thought that the problem of predication with respect to God was the result of a sort of "hang-up" that the medievals had about God's "unity," and that we should simply drop the idea that we have to think of God in that way. I was somewhat surprised, and I recall that I asked him, "Well, do you think that God is literally a mind (or literally has a mind), i.e., that He has states of consciousness that succeed one another in time?" (A question I remember encountering in Bertrand Russell's writings somewhere.) My interlocutor replied, "Why not?" I replied that time, we now know, is something whose properties are contingent, for example, according to General Relativity, whether there is a finite or an infinite amount of future time depends on such things as the average mass-density of the physical universe, and I asked whether putting God in time wouldn't amount to abandoning utterly the idea of God's transcendence. He did not reply. Frankly, this concep tion of God?if it really was my interlocutor's?the conception of God as</page><page sequence="8">494 HILARY PUTNAM a being undergoing change in time?seems to me unacceptably anthro morphic. It certainly would have seemed so to Maimonides or to Thomas Aquinas. But what I want to discuss is not my interlocutor's conception of God as a being in time,15 but his very interesting remark that the medi evals16 had a "hang-up" about God's Unity. What I want to suggest is that, even if some of the reasons these thinkers had for thinking that God must be a Unity may no longer seem compelling, there are good reasons?good religious reasons?for at least moving in this direction. The idea of Unity is not simply something that Neoplatonism, as it might be, foisted on the theologies of the monotheis tic religions. Consider, for example, the supposition that God has a faculty of Knowledge and a separate and distinct faculty of Will. On such a view, for God to think that something exists and for Him to desire that it exists are two utterly separate things. Such a separation of the faculties makes perfect sense in the case of finite beings, who may well think (or even know) that something exists although they do not desire it to exist, think (or even know) that something does not exist although they desire it to exist, etc. But for God to think that something exists is for it to exist, and for God to desire that something exists is for it to exist. The links, that is, between God's thinking that something exists, His desiring that it exist, and its existing are necessary links. Of course, what I have given is not a metaphysical proof of Divine Unity, and, indeed, a number of answers have been proposed to this sort of argument. Leibniz, for example, may be read as proposing that God's Intellect is distinguished from His Will precisely by the fact that what his Intellect grasps is the whole realm of Possibility: what makes a possible thing into a real thing is precisely an act of the Divine Will. The distinc tion between Possibility and Actuality, is thus, on this account, what points to the difference between Divine Intellect and Will.17 (But it is certainly not true that human will guarantees the existence of what is willed!) Again, some have argued that even Divine Omnipotence does not extend to responsibility for what is brought about by human Free Will, and so God may, after all, desire something which is not actualized (although traditional theology draws back from concluding that the created world as a whole is or can be less good than it might have been). Thus, it is clear that while we can easily explain what it is for will and knowledge to be distinct attributes in the case of human beings (and</page><page sequence="9">THOUGHTS ADDRESSED TO AN ANALYTICAL THOMIST 495 analogously for knowledge and perception to be distinct, etc.), the expla nations are not ones that can simply be carried over to the case of God without modification. What I desire to be the case and what I know to be the case have no necessary connection, but if there is a difference between what God knows to be the case and what He desires to be the case, it is a difference between states which?apart from the cases in which Free Will is involved?are necessarily related, and not just necessarily related but conceptually related, since if anything is part of the traditional concept 'God' it is Omniscience and Omnipotence. The problem, for one who tries (as the great medieval philosophers tried) to theorize about God is that the attributes cannot really be thought of as functioning in the case of God as the "analogous" attributes do in the case of creatures we understand, in particular ourselves; and this problem, I claim, is not simply the artifact of some dubious metaphysical doctrine. The danger that faces one who tries to give up the notion that God's attributes are in some way One (or at least that each necessarily implicates all of the others) is that one begins to threaten the idea of God's Transcendence, and that idea is a religious and not merely a metaphysical idea. Moreover, abandoning the idea of God's Transcendence also threatens another religious idea, the idea of God's Necessity; for to the extent that we make God "intelligible" by giving in to the temptation to think of him as having a lot of separate "states" with functional relations (or as a lot of separate "experiences," as in William James's explicitly anti-transcendental theology in A Pluralistic Universe), then he begins to seem like?as Haeckel notoriously charged?a "gaseous vertebrate"; and a vertebrate, however immaterial, isn't the sort of thing that can exist necessarily, on any conception of necessity. We are then?or at least I am, and I assume "Analytical Thomists" are as well?stuck with a paradoxical conception of God. I shall close with a word about how one might think about the consequences of that fact (consequences beyond the remark that the notion of proving the existence of God to an atheist seems problematic). I have discussed Maimonides' (and, briefly, Aquinas') solutions to the problem of ascribing "attributes" to God elsewhere,18 and I won't repeat that discussion here. But I will say this much: neither Maimonides' solution (his so-called "negative theology") nor Aquinas' solution (via the notion of analogia) seem to clearly resolve the problem. The problem with negative theology is that it leaves it unintelligible why we should say the things we do about God. What the doctrine of analogia comes to is</page><page sequence="10">496 HILARY PUTNAM itself a question on which interpreters of Aquinas disagree; but one problem I find with it is that it isn't clear that it really is a different solution from another of Maimonides' solutions (namely, that we are "permitted" to predicate "attributes of action" to the Deity19; a solution which seems20 like a failure to carry through his negative theology to the end). For example21 discussing the application to God of such terms as 'being' and 'good' and 'wise', after having said that these terms are neither applied univocally nor equivocally, but analogically, Thomas writes, It should be said therefore that names of this kind are said of God and creatures according to analogy, that is, proportion. This occurs in two ways in naming: either many things have a proportion to one, as "healthy" is said of medicine and urine insofar as each is ordered to the health of the animal, of which the latter is the sign and the former is the cause; or one is propor tioned to another, as "healthy" is said of medicine and animal, insofar as the medicine is the cause of the health that is in the animal. And in this way some things are said analogically, and not purely equivocally or univocally, of God and creatures. We can only name God from creatures as was said before. Thus, whatever is said of God and creatures is said insofar as there is a certain order of creature to God as to its principle and cause in which pre exist in an excellent manner of all the perfections in things. The analogy between medicine and health in the animal that Aquinas employs seems to mean that when we call God "good" or "wise" or a "being" we so refer to him not because he is good or wise or a being in the sense that a creature is, but because God is the "principle" or ground of (what we call) goodness and wisdom and being in creatures. And this is exactly Maimonides' account of the attributes of action! On the other hand, if (following a different interpretation) analogia is understood by taking literally the notion of "proportion," that is by employing such a formula as: (1) God's Knowledge is that F which is to God exactly as Socrates' knowledge is to Socrates ?then the explanation seems to be wholly inadequate. There is no clear sense of "A is to as C is to D" that I am aware of which will justify supposing that such a formula as (1) has a unique solution. Just to consider the right hand of the formula, is there a single way in which Socrates'</page><page sequence="11">THOUGHTS ADDRESSED TO AN ANALYTICAL THOMIST 497 knowledge is to Socrates? Surely God's knowledge isn't to God in every way just as Socrates' knowledge is to Socrates! My own view is certainly not Aquinas', but it does seem in keeping with something at least suggested by the following words:22 . . . some words are used neither univocally nor purely equivocally of creatures, but analogically, for we cannot speak of God at all except in the language we use of creatures. . . . this way of using words lies somewhere between pure equivocation and simple univocity [Et iste modus communi tatis m?dius est inter puram aequivocationem et simplicem univocationem], for the words are used neither in the same sense, as with univocal usage, nor in totally different senses, as with equivocation. To put the thought in my own words, it is possible for us to think about God and to talk about God, but doing so essentially involves uses of language which are sui generis (medius inter puram aequivocationem et simplicem univocationem). Obviously there are deep philosophical problems (as well as confu sions) in this area. I will only mention two: First, we have a tendency to believe (and philosophers are profes sionally inclined to believe) that such notions as 'univocal' language and 'literal' language are themselves clear and unproblematic. I would argue that, on the contrary, 'literal' and 'univocal' are themselves context dependent notions, and that there is no one form of discourse which is in some absolute sense "literal."23 Secondly, and perhaps this rests on the foregoing tendency, philoso phers have a professional tendency to believe that even if "non-literal" forms of language are useful and even indispensable for certain purposes, it must be possible to give a "theory" of these non-literal forms, where the notion of "theory" involves two further assumptions: (1) That "theory" means "scientific theory;"24 and (2) That scientific theories can, of course, be stated in literal lan guage. In my view, if there is one thing that there isn't going to be a scien tific theory of (either in the Aristotelian or in the contemporary sense of "scientific theory") it is how religious language works, and how it connects us to God. But how does this speak to the problem of predication with respect to God? In this way : we can agree that when we call God Wise, or Good,</page><page sequence="12">498 HILARY PUTNAM or All-Powerfiil, we are using these terms in a special way (I would not say "non-literal," because, as I have already remarked I don't think there is a single way of using them which is the "literal" way. And while God's Goodness and Knowledge are inconceivably different from human goodness and knowledge, I would not say that the difference either is or isn't a difference in the "meaning" of the words). And I would say that I cannot explain how that way works except in religious terms, by showing how the use of those terms figures in my religious life, showing how pro jecting those terms from my non-religious to my religious life is an essential part of that life. And neither can I explain what I mean by 'God', except by showing how my use of the term figures in my religious life? and that is not something I can do at just any time or to any person. Of course, this disbars me from claiming that I can "prove" that God exists to an atheist. But I have already indicated that that is not a claim that I think a religious person should make. I said at the outset that the present remarks are intended as a set of questions (of the form: "What do you think of this?") addressed to those who do consider themselves to be Analytical Thomists. It is time to stop, and hope that eventually they will respond. I am sure I will learn from the responses.
