SCHEIDENHELM ABSTRACT Salvage operations were carried out at an ex- tensively pot-hunted Zoned Bichrome period (300 B.C. to A.D. 300) cemetery in northwestern Guana- caste Province, Costa Rica. This is the first "pure" Zoned Bichrome site of this type to be studied and yielded a cross-section of ceramics representative of other Late Formative sites in the area and of contact with the Maya lowlands. In addition, it solidified the impression of this period being an entity distinct from subsequent regional developments. This distinction is seen in terms of adaptation to the exploitation of marine mollusca, a pattern not present in Zoned Bichrome sites known at the present time, but very important in succeeding Polychrome periods. Department of Anthropology Beloit College February, 1971 The Las Pilas cemetery, so-called because of 2 abandoned water tanks on an adjacent bluff, is located 2 km south of the town of La Cruz in the Nicaraguan-frontier area of Guanacaste Province, Costa Rica. It is 3 km west of the Sapoa River, on a volcanic ridge overlooking the Bay of Salinas to the west and the plains at the base of the volcano Orosi to the east (Fig. 1). The site has been known to huaqueros, or professional grave-robbers, for a number of years and was recorded as site #15 in the Rio Sapoa valley survey (Lange 1969). Salvage work at the Las Pilas cemetery was but one phase of 2 seasons' fieldwork in the Sapoa River area. The overall project was a survey, testing, and excavating program designed to test the extent and intensity of Mesoamerican influence in the region. (A total of 112 sites were located in a 75 km2 survey area, 24 of which were tested.) General pre- liminary results of the overall project are being published in the Informe Semestral of the Geographical Institute of Costa Rica (Lange n.d.). The cemetery consists of approximately 80 precolumbian tombs, 65 having been looted. With the exception of 3 graves located on a flat portion of the eastern slope, all tombs are distributed randomly along the top of the 300 m long ridge. The graves had been dug from volcanic rubble and rock and most appeared to have been rectangular in shape, approximately 1 m wide by 1 /2m long and between 1 and 2 m in depth. Most graves were individual units, al- though a few were connected by short, sub- surface tunnels. Whether this, and other features of grave construction, represent original dimensions or are the result of looting, or both, was impossible to determine. The graves have no particular orientation in their interrelationships and in their relationships to cardinal points and prominent geographical features. Undug graves are identified by a concentrated circle of rock approximately 2 m in diameter at ground level. The cemetery has produced many ceremo- nial stools, heretofore erroneously referred to by this and other writers as "metates," and fine jade specimens, and this was probably a principal reason for its almost complete de- vastation. A reliable informant, who partici- pated in some of the early "excavation," stated that little pottery was found in any of the graves and that human skeletal material had decomposed rapidly on exposure. Surface collection during 1969 revealed the presence of Zoned Bichrome ceramics from the earliest known cultural period in northern Costa Rica (300 B.C. to A.D. 300; Coe and Baudez 1961:512) and one that is still very imperfectly understood. For this reason, a decision was made to salvage as much data from the site as possible during the 1970 field season. Salvage methodology was designed to pre- serve as much of the original grave association and context as possible. The "backdirt" was mounded and almost always clearly associated with the grave from which it came. The total adjacent surface debris, along with all loose soil from the bottoms and exposed wall profiles of graves, was sifted through a /4 in mesh screen in order to recover cultural materials. The most recent plundering had resulted in the loss of prize breeding stock from falls into open holes and the landowner was under- standably reluctant to grant permission to dig in undisturbed graves. This was unfortunate, since important social information could have been obtained from the sex, age, and artifact associations of interred individuals. All 65 looted graves were completely sampled, and 40 yielded cultural material. All ceramic material found was from the Zoned 240 [Vol. 37, No. 2, 1972</page><page sequence="2">REPORTS Fig. 1.

Bichrome period, predominantly Bocana Incised Bichrome (Baudez 1967:63) and Rosales Incised Bichrome (Baudez 1967:68). The general scarcity of ceramics is reflected in the total of 619 sherds recovered. Of these, 109 were decorated and could be assigned to existing typological categories (Table 1). The condition of all ceramic materials had deterio- rated due to surface exposure and sherds that were undecorated were not utilized in the analysis. Using Munsell notation, the sherds had a 7.5 YR 6/6 yellowish red paste, and were tempered with volcanic sand. Many sherd frag- ments were fragile and less than 2 cm square. While the limited ceramic sample does not permit more than a presence-absence typolog- ical tabulation, it does suggest distinctive socio- mortuary practices when compared to the succeeding Polychrome periods. If we can accept the informant's statement that few vessels were associated, this and the distinct lack of primary surface material are a marked contrast to the potsherd-strewn graves of later times (Stone 1966:34). 241</page><page sequence="3">ameRican antiquity Table 1.

XXXVI, 8); and the jadeite amulet pictured in Fig. 21 was surface collected during the 1969 survey. A number of ceremo- nial stool fragments were also recovered. A detailed preliminary description of the Zoned Bichrome period was given by Coe and Baudez (1961) and amplified by Baudz (1967) and will not be repeated here. However, a comparative discussion seems in order. The map (Fig. 1) shows the location of the Las Pilas cemetery and its geographical relation- ships to Zoned Bichrome phases defined by Coe and Baudez (1961). The Las Pilas ceramics, following Baudez's 1967 typological de- signations, show their closest affinities with the Monte Fresco phase of the Matapalo site and with the Catalina phases of the La Guinea, Ortega, and La Bocana sites, being represented by Rosales Incised Bichrome (Fig. 2D) and Bocana Incised Bichrome (Fig. 2E, F) respec- tively. Toya Incised Trichrome (Fig. 2H), the predominant type in the Chombo phase at Chahuite Escondido, is otherwise represented only at Ortega and is also a minor type at Las Pilas. Ballena Incised (Fig. 2C) was reported from neither Chahuite Escondido nor Matapalo, of the Tempisque sites was found only at Ortega, and was also represented at Las Pilas. In addition, the following types designated by Baudez (1967) were found: Mojica Shell Impressed (Fig. 2G); Diria Incised (Fig. 2A); Pozon Channeled; and Tamino Incised (Fig. 2A). Indirect trade with the Maya lowlands at this time appears to be indicated by three Paso Caballo Waxy Ware Sierra Group (Joseph W. Ball, personal communication; after Smith and Gifford 1966:167) medial flange vessel frag- ments and presages the strong Maya influence in succeeding Polychrome periods. The rather distinct distribution of pre- dominant and minor types throughout the region suggests that some sort of organized trade may have been involved in their spread. The upper Tempisque River rises on the southern flanks of the volcano Orosi, while the Sapoa River rises on its northern flanks. A distance of only 10 km separates the 2 head- waters and this may have been the main route of travel between the lower Tempisque and the Chahuite Escondido area. Zoned Bichrome material has also been identified from adjacent southern Nicaragua. Norweb (1964:558) reported the Rosales Incised Bichrome type in the Isthmus of Rivas, although he referred to it as Rosales Zoned Engraved, the appellation originally used by Coe and Baudez (1961:506) and technically more accurate than "Incised" in describing the decorative technique employed. Haberland (1961:157) illustrated a Diria Incised vessel encountered in the process of excavating a grave on Ometepe Island. This grave differed from those at Las Pilas, having been placed in a midden deposit rather than in a formal cemetery. The Sapoa River flows into the southern shore of Lake Nicaragua and Ometepe is easily connected with locations to the south. The only other known Zoned Bichrome cemetery is that of Bolson, partially excavated by Baudez in 1960 (1967:37-44). In this cemetery, complete ceramic vessels were found associated with both primary and secondary interments. In contrast to La Pilas, Bolson began temporally in the Zoned Bichrome period and continued in use into Early Poly- chrome times (about A.D. 500; Baudez 1967:44). While B audez has stated elsewhere (1963:47) that there was no jade-working 242 [Vol. 37, No. 2, 1972</page><page sequence="4">REPORTS I F Fig. 2.

The appearance of jades at this site and not at others, and the contrast between the high artistic perfection and the dispersed, small population of this period cannot at present be explained, but only attributed to insufficient data. One interesting feature of Las Pilas is that there are no known Zoned Bichrome habitation sites in the immediate area. Testing at 2 sites on the adjacent Bay of Salinas and surface collections from twelve others failed to yield any materials from this period. One site ex- tensively tested was the largest on the Bay of Salinas and located in an ecological niche similar to Coe's Chahuite Escondido site on the Santa Elena peninsula; the other was a single component Late Polychrome (A.D. 1200 to A.D. 1500) manifestation. The volcanic plain to the east was intensively surveyed, but no ceramic sites were found. 243</page><page sequence="5">ameilcan antiquity The nearest known Zoned Bichrome sites are Chahuite Escondido, 12 km south of Las Pilas, and 10 small, single component sites in the San Dimas Valley, 17 km to the north (McKenzie 1969; Lair 1970). In both areas, Zoned Bichrome occupation appears to have been relatively light. Ceramic analysis of San Dimas collections in general shows the range of types already discussed. In addition, both Las Pilas (Fig. 2J, L) and San Dimas (Fig. 2K) assem- blages contain some sherd varieties not previously described for the area. Schettel Incised (Fig. 2K) was previously reported in the immediate area only from Nicaragua (Norweb 1964:558). This type is actually incised, in contrast to other "incised" types from this period that are in reality engraved, and is particularly interesting because typologically comparable ceramics are present both in the Conchas phase at La Victoria, Guatemala and at Valdivia, Ecuador in the Chorrera phase (Evans and Meggers 1966:251). While it is not unusual not to find a habitation site in the immediate vicinity of a cemetery or to suspect that persons may have come or been brought from some distance to utilize it, it is somewhat baffling that a people having the artistic specializations to produce jade amulets and the social stratification implied by the ceremonial stools and formal cemeteries, did not leave a more distinct mark on the landscape. Possible explanations may lie in the local ecological adaptation to the tropical environment. Building a solid-walled, perman- ent house in the tropics serves little functional purpose when compared to the open-air, breeze-catching style. Meggers and Evans (1956:156) noted the problems of finding the latter structures archaeologically and a study of a modern house site in the San Dimas area (Rydberg 1970) also indicated some of the problems that would be involved. Neither the Chombo, Monte Fresco, Catalina, nor San Dimas phases were apparently related to the exploitation of marine mollusca which leave obvious midden refuse. Very few artifactual indicators of subsistence have been found, but subsequent patterns in the area suggest that the Zoned Bichrome peoples practiced a forest regrowth system (Gordon 1969) that fully exploited collecting and gathering potentials in conjunction with some shifting cultivation. Dispersed settlements of peoples practicing this subsistence pattern would tend to leave very faint traces of their presence and this appears to be what we find in the known Zone Bichrome sites in the region. This may also explain the absence of this period from the Bay of Salinas excavations. In the Chahuite Escondido excavation, Coe stated (1961:506) that the Chombo phase level under- lay the subsequent shell-bearing levels. While the adjacent backland there offers numerous subsistence alternatives, there is much less terrestrial potential around the Bay of Salinas and other sectors of the Pacific coast parallel to the Sapoa River. The concentrated population along the Sapoa during this period is reflected in the San Dimas material. All available data tends to emphasize the distinctive nature of the Zoned Bichrome period in northern Costa Rica and this is reinforced by the "pure" temporal association and descriptive mortuary features of the Las Pilas cemetery. The ecological anomalies between Zoned Bichrome and succeeding periods, and a total lack of preceding cultural strata anywhere in the area at present prevents a more careful linkage of this region with Intermediate Area Formative developments.

STEIN ABSTRACT Chemical analyses of soil samples from the Utz site, Missouri, provide results which make it possible to distinguish between soil stains of human origin (postmolds) and similar stains produced by other agencies (for example, rodents). Based on the com- parison of the concentrations of magnesium and phosphates in the stains with those of the immediately surrounding soil, postmolds were correctly identified with 96% accuracy in a limited sample. Other soil disturbances in the site (bulldozer drag, an old excavation, and so forth) were also localized on chemical grounds during the course of the research. Department of Anthropology State University of New York at Binghamton Department of Anthropology Brandeis University August, 1970 Chemical analyses of soils of archaeological interest, carried out during the 1969 excavation season at the Utz site near Miami, Missouri, provide considerable information about chemical variations in deposits created by human occupation, as well as a new field technique for the identification and diagnosis of certain man-made features.

In addition, areas of recent soil disturbance-the result of bulldozing, building, and road con- struction-were defined. The Utz site was occupied by Missouri Indians from about A.D. 1550 until the 1700's. The site is one of the largest known in the country; surface scatters of lithic material, potsherds, and so forth, extend over an area which is as much as 2 miles across. Extensive building and rebuilding of simple (and ap- parently highly impermanent) houses are evident; it is possible that annual rebuilding took place. Excavation reveals large numbers of postmold stains which are often nearly impossible to arrange into meaningful patterns. The prob- lem is further complicated by extensive burrow- ing by rodents, creating stains indistinguishable from postmolds when the burrows are revealed on the excavation floor, and which can only be diagnosed when cross-sectioned. Storage and refuse pits, sub-floor burials, and so forth, complete the inventory of excavated features in the site. In order to achieve better definition of activity areas and to help in the diagnosis of postmolds, chemical analyses of relevant soil samples were employed. A soil testing labora- tory was set up on the site in a building which had electricity and running water available. The 245</page></plain_text>
