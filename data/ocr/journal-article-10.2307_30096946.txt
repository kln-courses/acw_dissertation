<plain_text><page sequence="1">LACONIAN TERRACOTTAS OF THE DEDALIC STYLE (PLATES 7-I I.) LACONIAN figurines have been found on four sites at or in the neighbour- hood of Sparta: by the British excavations at the Sanctuary of Artemis Orthia,1 at the Menelaion,2 and on the Acropolis at the Sanctuary of Athena of the Brazen House: 3 and by the Greek and, subsequently, the German excavations at the Amyklaion.4 So far as I know only three archaic Laconian figurines have been found on sites which are not Laconian. Of these, two are from Tegea, a site which was open to Laconian, Argive and Corinthian influences; these two objects will be mentioned below. The third is the late archaic terracotta head from Olympia, which Langlotz classes as Sicyonian,5 but which is much more akin to late archaic Laconian heads. One would expect that seventh-century figurines of Laconian style would have been found at Tarentum,6 but as almost no archaic terracottas from that site have been published it is impossible to say whether such exist or no: the few I have seen in Berlin do not present any striking similarity with those from Laconia, although one of them is akin to the Cretan heads of about 625.7 In importing terracottas from other fabrics Laconia seems to have been equally unenterprising: there are fragments of two East Greek alabastra of the well-known middle sixth- century type from the Orthia site and a third from the Acropolis,9 though these must be counted as vases; among figurines proper an Argive figurine of the 'Ornate' class from the Menelaion,'o and a possibly Cretan head from the Acropolis,' form the sum of importations, at least among those in the Sparta Museum. 1 Farrell, B.S.A. xiv, 65 ff.; Dawkins, Artemis Orthia I45 f. 2 Thompson, B.S.A. xv, I6 ff. 3 Mrs. Woodward, B.S.A. xxix, 75 if. 4 'Eqapg. 1892 13, 14, with P1. iv, 4, 5; A.M. ii, 39 ff- 5 Olympia iii, P1. vii, 2, 3.

I hope shortly to publish a com- parative study of the parallel development of the Dedalic style in Crete, Sparta, Corinth and Rhodes; but for two reasons the Laconian series deserves a separate article: first, because its extreme richness of material, far surpassing the other collections, cannot be adequately surveyed in a study of general principles: second, because the Laconian Dedalic style is of a strongly individual and provincial character which makes the Laconian heads stand somewhat apart from the others. Clay and technique have been adequately described by Dawkins 2 in his publication of the Orthia figurines; Dawkins does not, however, distinguish two separate methods of decoration which seem to have been used without discrimination during the seventh century, as we find them both employed on contemporary figurines: the first consists in painting the face with a thick cream slip and the hair and eyes with black lustrous paint: the second in leaving the face unpainted but with a good surface finish, and coating the hair with a light red wash; examples of these two methods will be noticed as we proceed; they are never confused-we never find red hair with a cream face or black hair with an undecorated face. The well-modelled terracotta figurine has, like other artifacts, a very long history at Sparta. The small head from the Menelaion (profile view in B.S.A. xv, 122, fig. 4, no. 54) is clearly very primitive, although carefully modelled and incised. Its globular skull and sharp thin nose recall the bronze figures of the New York Centauromachy and the Samos Lion Hunt: 3 it is probably datable well back into the ninth century. The two Geometric heads from the Amyklaion are ably dealt with by Laconian figurines before the sixth century, nor are ' a few large flecks ofmica ' a common ingredient of Laconian clay; in fact, the head is of a type common and of long duration in Crete, the distinguishing features being a straight thick mouth, a broad but not pro- truding nose, and plastically ringed eyes.

JENKINS Kunze.1 There is one more Laconian head of pure Geometric style which has for some reason evaded publication; it is an interesting plastic vase from the Orthia site2 (P1. 7 no. i): the orifice runs up through the neck and the vase was apparently suspended upside down. The head, though stylistically far inferior to the Amyklaion head, is modelled with the vigour and individualism of Geometric plastic art. The face is flat and disc- like, but this defect is softened by the enclosing beard, carefully dotted: while the well-conceived skull, the short, plastic locks of hair, and the accurately related features command our respect. The head anticipates one characteristic of the Laconian Dedalic of the following century, namely the curving bridge of the nose; this awkward peculiarity, though it tends to disappear in the Late Dedalic period, crops up again even in the sixth century.3 Turning to the Subgeometric period we have the head from the Acropolis published by Mrs. Woodward (P1. 7 no. 2).4 It is, as Kunze notes,5 Pre-Dedalic, but is made in a mould (one of the earliest known moulded terracottas in Greece) and has the flattish face which the early use of that technique involves. Mrs. Woodward's comment that it cannot be dated as early as the eighth century will require consideration; her comparison of it with the Late Dedalic janiform head has been correctly rejected by Kunze." Now, if we compare these last two heads with those of the class which immediately follows them (P1. 7 nos. 3-5), we get a very good idea of the contrast between the Geometric and the seventh-century or Dedalic traditions. The Geometric face is broad, ill-defined, and spreading: the features are pronounced, the nose high and projecting; moreover, both heads shew an individuality and an almost naturalistic treatment which is utterly different from the Dedalic; certain conventional features they do indeed shew, but they are not modelled in obedience to any preconceived and binding principle of construction, as are their successors. With these 1 I cannot, however, agree with Kunze that one of these heads is Mycenaean and the other Geometric. The 'Mycenaean' head is certainly an inferior work, and the mouth is very feeble; but it is difficult to suppose that two heads which are as close to each other in the rendering of eyes, chin, jaw, and neck (cf. A.M. Iv, Beilage xliii), can be divided by an interval of three centuries and are products of two different civilisations (even Kunze finds the correspondence ' tiuschend '). As the nose of the 'Mycenaean' is lost we cannot guess with certainty its original appearance, and the eyes set too low down below the brows illustrate a characteristic of numerous clay Geometric heads. To my mind there is no doubt that the heads are contemporary (if no closer tie unites them) and that both belong to the late Geometric period. 2 At any rate, it is now in a case with other finds from that site. 3 Cf.

The little group of which two members are illustrated (P1. 7 nos. 3-4), though they are still rough and boorish in appearance, are for this reason important, that they are the first in the Laconian series which shew the new spirit of the seventh century. How fundamentally unchanging, despite improvements in detail, was the Dedalic formula which governs their construction may be seen by a glance at their successors of the Middle period, in the zenith of the style (P1. 9 nos. 2-5). The six extant examples of this ' Proto-Dedalic ' group (as we may call it) all come from the same mould; all were found at the Orthia site, and are unpublished.2 They represent the usual standing goddess type; body is moulded as well as head, and the curious proportions of the figurine will be noticed with reference to the following class. We should note in the profile view the almost entirely flat 'two-dimensional' treatment of the face, which is an invariable characteristic of the Dedalic head.3 In the same early group, though representing a rather later stage, is a large protome from Orthia (P1. 7 no. 5), embodying an effort to produce a longer face with a less angular chin: it is no doubt the protome mentioned by Farrell B.S.A. xiv, 60, C, I, 3. The technique is that of the red-wash hair. A parallel is seen in the rough bronze protome,4 which shews the same long face wide at the cheek bones, and tapering chin. Even closer is the clay protome from Crete now in New York, published by Mrs. Dohan.5 We next arrive at a group of figurines which may be said to represent an Early Dedalic phase: the Dedalic style is now a reality with its long U- or hairpin-shaped face, flat low forehead, and large eyes. The heads belonging to this period are placed in chronological order on the plate (P1. 8), and we observe how in heads which occur towards the close of the period the long shape is tending to widen out slightly above into the broader face of the Middle group. It is with these somewhat more developed heads (P1. 8 nos. 4, 5) that we must compare a singular limestone statuette now in the museum at Mistra (P1. 8 no. 6); as this object has never been published-or so far as I know referred to-before, it is worth while to give a brief description of it.

JENKINS museum was unable to inform me how such a piece reached a museum otherwise devoted to Byzantine relics: he said that another foreign visitor had told him that it belonged to the seventh century, though quite naturally he supposed that the seventh century A.D. was meant. The object is made of Spartan limestone, and in its present truncated condition measures about 45 cms. high and about 20 cms. broad: its curiosity lies in its shape. A cylindrical and columnar block of stone is hollowed out at the top to form a shallow cup, whose rim is pierced to form a runnel at one side. On the periphery of the column is carved in high relief an exceedingly archaic Kore: below the waist she is broken off, and the face is very badly destroyed, yet enough remains to shew the outline of the face, part of the modelling of the cheeks, the position of the mouth, and the hair. Below the neck, the torso is, comparatively, well preserved as far as the waist, and the vigorous but very archaic modelling of the breasts is plain. Above (see profile view), the lip or rim of the columnar stone is extended giving a polos-like effect over the head, which is inclined from and projects in front of the body. We are not much concerned here with the purpose of the object as a whole-it naturally at first glance brings to mind the Laconian tripod with three caryatids, which is presupposed by the Laconian Kore at Olympia1 : but a moment's thought shews that our figure is com- plete in itself and cannot have formed part of a larger composition. It is perhaps reasonable to regard it as a columnar altar with a small receptacle cut in the top to receive libations if, as seems probable, the receptacle is contemporary with the carving: in this case, our Kore would be the god- dess, perhaps in some chthonic capacity, though it might be hard to find a parallel to this type of archaic altar, if such it is.2 More important, however, is the style. We may anticipate the chronological study which follows, by saying that according to the com- parison here made with the Early Dedalic group of terracottas, the piece must be dated not later than 660 B.c. and is in consequence one of the oldest examples of Greek stone sculpture in existence. The evidence for this rests partly on the style of the head, which we have brought into relation with the terracottas on P1. 8, and partly on the proportions of the body. It is noticeable that the proportions of the stone statuette and those of the two female figurines here given for comparison, roughly correspond: and very odd proportions they are. Head with neck, bust, and skirt form three almost equal divisions, the first and last of these being in consequence far too large and far too small respectively. This immense predominance 1 Olympia iii, P1. v, 4, 5; cf. J.H.S. I896, 275 f. 2 Dr. A. B. Cook has suggested to me that the object may illustrate an intermediary phase between the time when the God was his own (aniconic) altar and the time when he was a separate anthropomorphic entity with an altar set up to him; cf. on ZeCs Bcop6S his Zeus i, 519 f.</page><page sequence="6">LACONIAN TERRACOTTAS OF THE DEDALIC STYLE 7I of the head in relation to the body had been a feature of all Greek modelling from the Subgeometric period onwards, and is in contrast to the accurate sense of proportion shewn by the few good statuettes we possess of the pure Geometric style.1 Now, in the next (Middle) period which we come to in a moment, although the head remains too large the principle of construction of the body is quite changed; the bust is very much shortened and the part below the waist has become very long indeed-sometimes absurdly so; and this gives the whole figure, though still incorrectly propor- tioned, a much more balanced appearance.2 It is obvious that the Mistra statuette belongs to the more archaic canon; the depth of the bust, which is relatively long and pear-shaped (cf. particularly P1. 8 no. 5), instead of being very short and sharply triangular as in the following group, is sufficient to prove the point; it is interesting to note that beside the Laconian Proto- and Early Dedalic figurines, several other statuettes from different Dorian sites, statuettes which can be attributed to this period solely on the style of the head, exhibit the same archaic proportions: compare the clay relief Kouros from Cameirus 3 and the bronze illustrated by de Ridder, Cat. des Bronzes trouvds sur l'Acropole d'Athlnes no. 775. The elongated and affected proportions of the following group have also numerous represent- atives outside Laconia. The projection of the head forward reminds us of another early archaic trait, that of modelling the head in high relief and leaving the body either painted in outline below or else in very low relief.4 The figurines of the Early Dedalic period here illustrated all come from the Orthia site. Two more heads come intermediately between these and the Middle group. The large plastic head on P1. 9 no. I looks very crude and primitive, but this is largely due to the fact that its chin, owing to a technical fault, has slipped round under its right cheek. Apart from this, the features, especially the mouth, suggest that it is an early specimen of the following Middle Dedalic group, datable about five years before those on P1. 9 nos. 2-4; true, it belongs to a group of plastic heads which Dawkins places before 675;5 but this is evidence drawn from pottery, and the date is certainly too early for the head figured at Artemis Orthia P1. xxxviii no. 3, which is of the same group according to the stratification. To the same intermediate period belongs the remarkable figure of a 1 Cf. A.M. Iv, 158 f. 2 V.

JENKINS bisexual deity from the Menelaion,' which is bearded and has male genitals, but also female breasts held in the traditional fashion of the naked Oriental goddess, and a painted design obviously meant to represent female dress: I hope to discuss its significance elsewhere in connection with a curiously similar figurine from Perachora; for the present we note the similarity of the face to those of the next class and the incipient smile so characteristic of the latter. The great Middle period which shews the style at its zenith is particularly well represented on all three sites at Sparta. It subdivides itself most naturally into three phases, according to which we shall briefly consider it. (i) The first phase differs from the second principally in the outline of the face. That of the first is oval, the chin is smoothly curved, and, apart from the fact that the face is broader at the temples, and has a greater depth from front to back, the modifications from the Early Dedalic period are slight. This phase of the Middle Dedalic style shews Laconian Dedalic at its most individual, and it is worth while to notice its predominant characteristics. To begin with, the eyes are not modelled, nor even ringed about with a plastic rim, but merely cut oval blobs which rely entirely on painted decoration: this is a purely Laconian characteristic 3 (the Proto- Dedalic protome is exceptional) and continues down to the last quarter of the century; the nose is broad, long, and heavy; hanging well down over the mouth (a rare feature in the Dedalic style) and curved in the bridge (cf. P1. 9 no. 3b): the mouth is heavy and definitely curved in a smile, a characteristic almost confined to Laconia and even there seen only in this Middle group in its three phases. The hair is most usually Perlenlocken; occasionally the Etagenperiicke or layer-hair is found, but is not the rule as it is in Crete. The two first heads (P1. 9 nos. 2-3) both belong to. standing female figurines from the Orthia site, which shew the elongated proportions above referred to. The next head (P1. 9 no. 4) is a protome (a shape extremely popular both in clay and bronze at Sparta) from the Menelaion: this has the red-wash technique. The last two heads of the phase come both from the Acropolis: the first preserves much of its fine decoration, and we can see that the painted eye was by no means ineffective; the characteristic flat-topped head is also very noticeable. The second (P1. 9 no. 6) is even more interesting, being the face from a plastic head-vase. This remarkable piece is certainly Laconian, and as we shall see is not much later than 650.4 1 B.S.A. xv, I20 fig. 3, no. 34. 2 Cf. the 'incised' dress of the Olympia bronze (Olympia iv, P1. xv, no. 266 and J.d.L I906, i80 f). 3 Cf.

The black glaze-paint, curl- fringe, and painted eyes of the Acropolis vase recall the technique of late seventh-century Ionian head-vases, particularly of Brit. Mus. A. 450o,4 but the simple tubular orifice of the Laconian 5 differs both from the spreading Ionic lip and from the bored orifice of the Corinthian. The face is strikingly plastic; although restricted in depth by the Dedalic convention, the front of the face, the cheeks and chin are beautifully modelled; yet there is no doubt that we are right in placing it in this group, for the heavily curved mouth and oval chin are unmistakable, and the modelling of the more cheaply made Menelaion protome is not vastly inferior. The piece is the finest Laconian head of the Middle period extant. (ii) The second phase of the Middle period is distinguished by a much squarer facial outline (P1. Io nos. I, 3, 4, 6); the face is equally long, but the jaw is angular and the chin vigorous and protruding. The head thus produced is remarkably similar to that of the Auxerre statuette (P1. Io no. 2), and the rendering of the mouth in both is identical. Such similarities have led to a supposition on the part of A. M. Woodward 6 that the Auxerre statuette might be of Laconian fabric; this is, however, inadmissible, as the statuette exhibits certain other characteristics which are peculiar to Crete. But that she is contemporary with the Laconian group under discussion, and that Crete and Sparta hung very close together at this time, there can be no question. Perhaps the nearest to the Cretan statue is P1. Io no. I, which is now in the Fitzwilliam Museum. The specimens figured all come from the Orthia site. It is observable that in no. 3 the proportions of the figure are more normal, and that a reaction has set in against the affected shortening of the bust seen in the previous phase. To the Laconian Dedalic of this period must be related the one sur- viving head on the curious 'Peleus and Atalante' relief plaque from Tegea 7 (P1. Io no. 5); the head of Atalante is a trifle worn but the ' blob ' eyes and upward-curving mouth clearly indicate the Laconian style. It 1 Cf.

JENKINS is interesting to note that Studniczka describes her costume as a lakonisches Maedchenkleid. (iii) The third Middle phase is distinguished by a much shorter though not narrower face. It is the group to which the Protocorinthian metope from Mycenae belongs, and a good Laconian representative is the Acropolis protome on P1. Io no. 7. The small protome from the Menelaion P1. Io no. 8 illustrates the tendency towards the elimination of provincial features first observable in this class, for the mouth has resigned its rich curve and is well on the way to becoming straight. Here we must also include two plastic heads from a large Laconian vase which Droop calls Subgeometric (Fig. i); 1 they stand close to the last-named protome. And finally the FIG.

I);2 we see how at length body and head are almost in correct proportion; not merely has the head shrunk in size but the body has become broader and more solid. The final or Late Dedalic phase is best illustrated by the fine janiform protome from the Orthia site (P1. I I no. 2); it is rightly regarded by Kunze as one of the finest Laconian terracottas,3 and we can only echo his astonish- 1 Artemis Orthia 68, fig. 41 c (!). Cf.

The division between Middle Dedalic III and Late Dedalic may seem artificial in connection with Sparta, which is (as an exception) rather poorly repre- sented at the very end of the style; in contrast with Crete, whose numerous representatives allow the final stages to be traced with precision.</page><page sequence="10">LACONIAN TERRACOTTAS OF THE DEDALIC STYLE 75 ment that there should be no mention of it in the final publication of the site. It obviously greatly resembles the plastic heads from Droop's 'Sub- geometric' vase, but is, I think, certainly a little later. We see in it very clearly the elimination of those features which are peculiarly Laconian: the eyes are no longer rough-cut discs, but outlined with plastic rings; the mouth is now quite straight and comparatively thin-lipped; and, what is perhaps most significant of all, the nose is straight in profile, has no widespread nostrils, and a very greatly reduced projection. It seems probable that the influence which produced these modifications was Protocorinthian. For the rest, the wide square chin gives the face an outline familiar to us from other late Dedalic works such as the Eleutherna statue. After this period, which, as will be seen, cannot be dated lower than c. 620, ends the Dedalic style properly so called. The restrictions are exceeded and the formula is relaxed. The Laconian version of the style which we have been studying offers something of a contrast between careful workmanship and up-to-date technique on the one hand, and the clumsy and boorish style of the heads on the other. Laconian clay is soft and easy to model; painted decoration was carefully and effectively applied: the flat mould-no doubt imported from Crete-was in use uncommonly early, and Sparta was moulding whole figures at a time when many schools were content to set a moulded head on a mere unmodelled block. But for all that the best Laconian Dedalic fails to please, from a lack of delicacy in the modelling of details and a general coarseness of feature. The short thin nose, the straight sharp mouth, these are features characteristic of the finest Dedalic heads, and Laconian faces provide their very antitheses. Yet their artists had a good eye for decoration in bright colours, among which were a good clear purple,' orange, excellent black glaze, a thick cream slip, and a thin light red wash. It is disappointing that the damp soil has robbed so many figurines of their decoration, which would doubtless do much to mitigate their coarse and provincial aspect. It is a point of great interest to see how the various schools develop their Post-Dedalic styles from the common formula; confining ourselves to Sparta in this respect, the immediately Post-Dedalic phase is represented by two beautiful little heads from the Acropolis (P1. 11 no. 3); 2 the contrast between these and the pure Dedalic figurines is clear: the face has no longer the graceful triangular shape in one frontal plane, but has a smaller, 1 The Protocorinthian coroplast did not apparently use purple to decorate figurines, which is curious, as both vases and plastic vases of the Protocorinthian period have purple paint; on figurines I have noticed only red and black varnish, and a dark red wash for cheaper figurines; the finely-finished surface does not require white slip. Not until the last quarter of the seventh century do purple and (occasionally) yellow make their appearance. There is little evidence for the colours used in Crete and Rhodes. 2 B.S.A. xxix, 93, no. 46.</page><page sequence="11">76 R. J. H. JENKINS rounder form with a very much greater degree of depth; the eyes are treated in the later manner, and the forehead is not confined by the earlier flat horizontal line passing immediately above the eyes, but by a faintly arching fringe which leaves a reasonable depth of forehead beneath. Ears, again, reappear for the first time since the Subgeometric head. It would be true to say that these two protomes are the Laconian counterpart of the Argive Cleobis and Biton, and of their terracotta contemporaries from the Heraeum.1 But they have closer parallels yet; first, in the fine bronze head in the Louvre said to come from Cyprus;2 and second, in the bronze mould for the fabric of protomes found at Olympia; 3 I do not wish to affirm that both these objects are Laconian-they are merely contemporary examples illustrating the same stage of development: we may note, however, with respect to the Olympia mould, that protomes both in bronze and terracotta are much commoner in Sparta than else- where, a fact which, taken in conjunction with other Laconian bronzes of the seventh century from Olympia, suggests the possibility of its Laconian origin; Miss Lamb notes the significance of the shape, but thinks that the mould is not Spartan.4 Post-Dedalic again is the large and finely modelled plastic head from the Orthia site 5 (P1. 11 no. 4); although not well preserved it is obviously a stage beyond the small heads just mentioned and must fall at the very end of the seventh century. A contemporary but much less carefully executed series is that of the standing Orthia with the rampant lion; 6 Dawkins rightly says that all the specimens appear to come from the same mould, although, as Kunze remarks, this being the case, it is a little unreasonable to give them chrono- logical range of two centuries. Farrell (B.S.A. xiv, 64) rightly says 'none are later than the end of the seventh century'; nor indeed is any earlier. The following type, which starts either at the very end of the seventh century or more probably at the beginning of the sixth, is mentioned here because to it belongs the second of our three Laconian terracottas found outside Laconia; it also comes from Tegea (Fig. 2b).7 A considerable advance is observable in the high arch of the fringe, recalling the style initiated in the Corinthian fabric.8 Parallels to this Tegean head are the Orthia figurine illustrated with it, and also the mounted Orthia (Artemis Orthia, P1. xxxiii 7): the finest clay head of this type comes from the 1 Cf.

Finally, a magnificent Laconian bronze statuette, very similar in style to our group, has been published recently among finds from Samos.2 a b FIG. 2.-LACONIAN FIGURINES: a, ORTHIA SITE; b, TEGEA. (SCALE I: I.) CHRONOLOGY Farrell and Dawkins have based their chronology wholly on what has now been shewn to be the insufficient and often misleading evidence of the pottery with which the various groups of terracottas were found. Kunze has dealt with the pitfalls of this method; 3 even if the groups do fall within the limits assigned to them by the stratigraphical evidence, these limits are much too wide to be of any value in a specialised study of early archaic art. This method having failed us there are two other sources which might afford assistance: the first is ceramic evidence from Laconian vases which were decorated with plastic heads; but the chronology of Laconian vases itself is as yet not quite certainly made out, and again, the limits given are too wide for our purpose: it is not helpful to be told that the head on Fig. I, which Kunze quite rightly assigns to the second half of the seventh century, adorns a vase in Droop's 'Subgeometric' class. In certain cases the parallel technique of decoration in vases and figurines may afford a basis for chronological conclusions, and a point of this kind is well made by Mrs. Woodward 4 in discussing the Pre-Dedalic head on P1. 7 1 B.S.A. xxix, 97, no. 47. Note the characteristic 'feather' polos on each. 2 Altsamische Standbilder, ii. pp. 32, 33.

JENKINS no. 2, but generally speaking we may class this method too as of little value. We are left with the comparative method, which bases itself on stylistic evidence, and this requires a brief explanation. The Dedalic style of the seventh century is distinctively Dorian, and we have very adequate evidence, mostly from terracottas, for tracing the successive stages of its rise and fall almost without a lacuna in four great Dorian centres, Cameirus, Corinth, Sparta, and Crete: at Argos (strangely) and at Athens (more naturally) we find only a few objects of very late or Post-Dedalic style. Now, the four great schools mentioned develop each a local variant of the Dedalic style, which has numerous characteristics of purely local origin; but it would be easy to shew that all the fabrics pass through stages of development which are essentially analogous to each other; we distinguished above in connection with Laconian terracottas groups which we called for con- venience Proto-, Early, Middle, and Late Dedalic, and the other three schools shew precisely the same development on lines which, though differing in detail, are yet fundamentally parallel. This being so I main- tain that we are justified in concluding that this parallel development went on contemporaneously, or very nearly so, in each centre: it would be gratuitous to suppose, let us say, that Sparta was making Middle Dedalic, while Cameirus produced Early and Corinth Late Dedalic heads. If this conclusion is warranted, it would obviously assist greatly in determining our chronology, for certain Dedalic heads in terracotta from other schools can for one reason or another be dated with some certainty; and we are thus able to link up with them those products of other schools which, as far as we can observe, exhibit the same stage of the style's development. It is hardly necessary to observe that full use of this method cannot be made until a comparative study has shewn in detail the relationship between the schools during the seventh century, and it is impossible here to publish sufficient figurines of other fabrics for comparison as one could wish to do; but where possible we shall try to help ourselves out by the comparative method, using the assumptions made above. The head on P1. 7 no. 2, Mrs. Woodward maintains, is decorated in Subgeometric style, but at some date after the beginning of Laconian I (i.e. after 700 B.c.), for it has certain Orientalising elements in the rendering of the hair and dress. With this seventh-century dating Kunze seems to agree.1 The question is of great importance, as it involves the dating of the first emergence of the Dedalic style in Greek plastic art. Mrs. Woodward and Kunze are perhaps right in dating the head after 700, a dating which receives support from the circumstance that the head is made in a mould; yet it is definitely Pre-Dedalic, and (if 700 is the correct date for the beginning of Laconian I) it cannot be dated much later than 1 Kretische Bronzereliefs, loc. cit.</page><page sequence="14">LACONIAN TERRACOTTAS OF THE DEDALIC STYLE 79 about 690.1 This allows a date in the latter half of the first quarter of the seventh century for the Proto-Dedalic group which follows; there are one or two non-Laconian heads which represent an even more primitive stage than the Orthia figurines, and these latter with the protomes of clay and bronze may best be put into the decade 68o-670. The Early Dedalic group will cover most of the second quarter; the long hairpin face of P1. Io no. I recalls a parallel type in Protocorinthian 2 which is certainly a good deal before 65o, probably fifteen or twenty years before. P1. To no. 4 is later, and this head and the Mistra statuette may be set at about 66o, together with the small Orthia figurine cited by Miiller.3 The head with the contorted chin suggests a date about 655. The plastic head on the Middle Protocorinthian aryballos in the Louvre is dated by Johansen and Payne to 650 on the evidence of the style of the vase painting.4 Now, the Laconian group which approximates most closely to this head is clearly that of the first Middle Dedalic phase: we have the same long face and oval chin not yet shewing a trace of the squarer jaw characteristic of the Auxerre type. The Orthia and Menelaion heads should date about 655-65o, and the Acropolis protome and head- vase, which have a foreshadowing of angularity, will come about 650-645. The Auxerre group will fill the next decade (645-635) and the third Middle and Late phases will occupy the next fifteen years; the plastic heads from the ' Subgeometric' vase must be put about 630, while the janus protome of the Late period (consequently between 630-620) is, as Kunze pointed out, some half a century later than the head with which Mrs. Woodward compares it.5 The remaining heads with which we have dealt, with the exception of that from Tegea and its contemporaries, all fall into the last twenty years of the century. The Dedalic style at Sparta, then, and thus ex hypothesi in other Dorian schools, occupies between sixty and seventy years in the middle of the seventh century. Its zenith is reached in the years immediately following 65o, and by the last quarter of the century the strict formula which is its governing principle is becoming relaxed. We found that Laconian Dedalic was at its most characteristic about the years 655-645; whether this be true of other Dedalic fabrics also is the task of a fuller study to determine. R. J. H. JENKINS. 1 The dating of the head has been most recently essayed by Miss Dorothy Burr (Hesperia ii, 607); she will make it contemporary with the Athenian Agora relief plaque, about the middle of the seventh century. This is much too late; the question is rather whether we should not place it earlier, in the eighth century. The problem is one for the student of Laconian ceramics. 2 From Perachora; unpublished. 3 Friihe Plastik, fig. 321.
