In this respect cognitive approaches need no defense - or at least not more than any other approach" (MENZEL &amp; JOHNSON, 1978, p. 586). Quite a few scientists are nervous about what they consider the uncritical acceptance, based on preliminary evidence, of cognitive capacities such as intentionality, selfawareness, and planning in monkeys and apes. At the same time, it is often taken for granted that these very capacities are involved in virtually everything humans do (MICHEL, 1991). This double-standard in cognitive assumptions places an unfair burden upon scientists who consider it only natural that all members of the primate order, including humans, share fundamental mental characteristics. These scientists are challenged to prove higher cognitive faculties in nonhuman primates, whereas one could with equal justification challenge the skeptics to prove beyond any doubt the absence of these faculties (MENZEL &amp; JOHNSON, 1978). This is not to say that there is no need for empirical definitions of higher mental functions, or for their 1) Plenary lecture, 22nd International Ethological Conference, Kyoto, Japan, 1991. 2) Writing was supported by grant RR-00167 of the National Institutes of Health to the Wisconsin Regional Primate Research Center.

M. DE WAAL systematic investigation; on the contrary, this is a very important field of inquiry. At the same time it is obvious that scientific progress would come to a halt if every new perspective were to be held hostage to the availability of the final answers. By far the simplest assumption regarding the social behavior of the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), for example, is that if this species' behavior resembles that of ourselves then the underlying psychological and mental processes must be similar too. To propose otherwise requires that we assume the evolution of divergent processes for the production of similar behavior. While acceptable in connection with distantly related species, this assumption is never made when the comparison concerns nonhuman organisms with only a few million years of separate evolution. Historically, our own species has been considered an exception in this regard, yet arguments for this position have never been purely or even largely scientific (GALLUP &amp; SUAREZ, 1983). At our previous meeting (the 21st International Ethological Con- ference, in Utrecht), Hans KUMMER defended parsimony in the explana- tion of primate behavior in order to get away from "our anthropomor- phic first choice" of overly demanding cognitive hypotheses. He criticized the use of functional (instead of descriptive) labels for animal behavior, and advocated a path of small experimental steps towards an understanding of primate cognition while questioning the bold specula- tions and claims of recent years by scientists who rely primarily on obser- vational methods (KUMMER et al., 1990). Since I had the privilege of being mentioned in this context, I feel compelled to comment on these opinions before addressing the main topic of this presentation, which is the complementarity of research methods in the study of social cognition. As evident from my opening remarks, the main difference between KUMMER and myself is that, whereas he believes in a gradual change of paradigm conditional upon evidence along the way, I subscribe to a wholehearted adoption of cognitive assumptions and a clean break with the Cartesian view (cf. GRIFFIN, 1976). This is one of those philosophical differences, I am afraid, that one can debate for a long time without ever resolving. I will therefore focus instead on the more concrete issue of functional language. The question here is not one of philosophy, but of the pros and cons of a vocabulary colored by one's hypotheses. One of the more powerful metaphors in ethology came from a hard- nosed experimentalist who referred to a special form of insect locomotion as Tanzsprache, or dance language (von FRISCH, 1965). Contrary to the suggestion that functional language is a recent vice, it has a long and dis-</page><page sequence="3">COMPLEMENTARY METHODS AND CONVERGENT EVIDENCE 299 tinguished history. Terms such as "appeasement", "warning call", "greeting", "submission", "courtship", and so on, differ from more recent functional terms only by our greater familiarity with them; as a consequence we hardly reflect upon their meaning anymore (ASQUITH, 1984). Non-descriptive labels accepted in primatology include "notifica- tion" for a baboon's presentation of his hind region, and "respect of possession" for the absence of contest over a resource (KUMMER, 1968; SIGG &amp; FALETT, 1985). Such language is inevitable when one studies acting agents instead of merely moving objects. People think in terms of causes, functions, and intentions, and human language has been so framed to carry this information (MIDGLEY, 1978). The one level at which descriptive terminology is advisable is that of the ethogram, that is, when defining the displays and behavioral units that form the building blocks of our data base (TINBERGEN, 1959). The facial display in which primates bare their teeth, for example, is com- monly described in the primatological literature as the "fear grimace" or "fear grin". In Old World monkeys, however, the display is con- sidered to have tranquilizing qualities (ALTMANN, 1962; van HOOFF, 1967), and about half the instances in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) are unaccompanied by flight or withdrawal responses (de WAAL &amp; LUT- TRELL, 1985). In chimpanzees and bonobos (Pan paniscus), it is not unusual for the display to occur in affiliative and sexual contexts; during approach rather than withdrawal, and in high-ranking individuals (de WAAL &amp; van HOOFF, 1981; de WAAL, 1988). In humans, finally, the display evolved into the smile, with its largely affiliative meaning (van HOOFF, 1972). Obviously, "fear grin" is too narrow a label, and a descriptive label such as "bared-teeth face" is preferable. A serious problem with labels that presume narrow functions arises when these functions do not appear to be served. When "food calls" are uttered in the absence of food or "alarm calls" in the absence of danger-or when the appropriate environmental stimuli fail to trigger these calls-scientists are sometimes tempted to speculate that their sub- jects are withholding information, falsifying signals, or otherwise deceiv- ing one another (MARLER et al., 1986; MUNN, 1986; HAUSER &amp; WRANGHAM, 1987; CHENEY &amp; SEYFARTH, 1990a). These speculations may well be correct, yet it is also fair to say that they are partially a product of the selected behavioral labels. Had "food calls" been labeled "grunts" instead, the conclusion would simply have been that grunts are often but not invariably used in the presence of food. The next question might have been which characteristics the feeding context shares with the</page><page sequence="4">300 FRANS B. M. DE WAAL other situations that trigger the same grunts (e.g. euphoria about a desirable situation; DITTUS, 1984), thus initiating a line of inquiry con- siderably broader than the issue of deception. An example of such an empirical approach to call function in primates, starting from predictions rather than assumptions, is ROBINSON (1982). The higher the level of analysis, however, the more difficult it becomes to maintain a purely descriptive attitude, and the less sense it makes to even try. At higher levels we organize the stream of behavior into categories, types of interaction, and social relationships. Because this process involves theory and interpretation, there is no reason to pretend, in the language selected, that it is a mere extension of our descriptive activity. Some systematizing takes place already at the level of percep- tion, which is the reason that most of us would not think of replacing the human observer by an imaginary apparatus capable of perfectly complete behavioral records in terms of postures and muscle movements. The human observer is highly selective, and sensitive to both the context and Gestalt of behavior, whereas the apparatus would just record a ridiculous amount of detail; one would have great trouble making sense of its out- put. As Gerard BAERENDS once warned me: under the microscope, an elephant and a hippopotamus look the same. "Play" is no doubt the category that would pose the greatest challenge to such a descriptive apparatus. This behavioral category is recognized in a great variety of species despite the virtual impossibility of pinpoint- ing its distinguishing features (FAGEN, 1981). Could it be that, when identifying play, we rely in part on our sensitivity to intent, and on our ability to empathize with the element of "fun" that is said to defy both definition and logical analysis (HUIZINGA, 1950)? Substituting the term "play" with a more descriptive term, such as "rearranged elements drawn from other types of behavior" (part of a definition by MARLER &amp; HAMILTON, 1966) would not change much. Such a label may sound more objective, yet the problem then would be to decide which rearrangements of behavior to include, and which to exclude. We should not forget that the central methodological issue is not the concreteness of our definitions, or even the role of subjective judgement, but the replicability of behavioral codification. Since competent observers are known to make extremely complex judgements reliably, BAKEMAN &amp; GOTTMAN (1986) consider it a fallacy to equate objectivity with physically based observa- tion schemes. "Play", with its connotation of lack of seriousness, is one of many anthropomorphic terms commonly used by ethologists. Another such</page><page sequence="5">COMPLEMENTARY METHODS AND CONVERGENT EVIDENCE 301 term is "threat", defined by my Random House Dictionary as "a declaration of an intention or determination to inflict punishment". I do not see any reason to fear such intentionalistic labels, particularly not in relation to primates. If one accepts that similar psychological mechanisms underlie similar behavior of closely related species, anthropomorphism becomes almost a non-issue. As pointed out by ASQUITH (1984), p. 138): "Anthropomorphism can be said to occur only if it is presupposed that self-awareness and purposeful behaviour are uniquely human." Mental complexity in nonhuman primates is indeed the most parsimonious explanation of their evident behavioral affinity with ourselves (unless, of course, one feels that human mental abilities are grossly overrated). Adoption of this point of view does not provide a license to ascribe to animals any intention or motivation we can think of any more than adap- tationist assumptions provide a license for uncontrolled evolutionary speculation. DENNETT (1983) was the first to point out the similarity in arguments by critics of cognitive and evolutionary approaches; according to these critics each paradigm makes it too easy to invent spectacular stories that distract from the nitty-gritty details of empirical science. KUMMER'S remarks are very much along the same lines (e.g. field observers are chided for their "flights of fancy"), with the important distinction that he does not reject cognitive explanations altogether. Yet, unless biology and psychology are irrelevant to the way one organizes behavioral information, functional, causal, intentionalistic, and anthropomorphic labels are the only honest means of communica- tion. Words should convey the structure we impose upon the world. Insofar as the structuring is done secondarily (i.e. after data has been col- lected with the aid of an ethogram of well-defined behavioral units) it does not burden the observer with difficult judgements. For example, "reconciliation" is a label introduced by de WAAL &amp; van ROOSMALEN (1979) for non-agonistic body contact between two individuals following an agonistic encounter in which they opposed one another. The label's connotations do not preclude a straightforward empirical definition. The best way to look at such labels is as heuristic devices that re-orient our views and provide new frameworks for research. In addition, they facilitate communication. The inclination to interpret what we see is indeed so basic that a purely descriptive language would be the surest way to kill interest in animal behavior. There is of course another side to the heuristic coin: interpretative labels are only as good as the hypotheses that they generate, and we</page><page sequence="6">302 FRANS B. M. DE WAAL should be prepared, even glad, to discard these labels if the hypotheses are contradicted (de WAAL, 1987). Evidence may come from a great variety of sources, which brings me to the main point of KUMMER et al. (1990), namely their championing of experimental procedures. The paucity of experimental data in current ethological research on primate social cognition is increasingly felt, and it is particularly important that this lacuna is pointed out by a primatologist who has so successfully integrated field observations and experimentation on the same species (e.g. KUMMER, 1984). It is precisely through this integration that the ethologist makes a contribution that is distinct from and biologically more relevant than that of the experimental psychologist. The study of primate social cognition can be divided into two main areas. First, the documentation of features of social organization that appear to require that animals understand their own relationship net- work (including relationships among others); are capable of complex decision-making based on their prediction of behavioral effects; have a detailed memory of social events; communicate about the physical and social environment; act in a goal-directed manner, and so on. This area has been explored by a number of primatologists (reviewed by CHENEY et al., 1986). Second, determination of the precise psychological and mental mechanisms underlying the complex sociality of nonhuman primates. Specific hypotheses are being developed and tested either by means of systematic observation of spontaneous social interactions or by means of experimental manipulation. This area is presently most in need of attention. My purpose here is to emphasize the close connection between these areas of research, the complementarity of various research methods, and the necessity of converging evidence. Each method makes an essential contribution to our knowledge so that evidence for a particular phenomenon cannot be called complete until agreement exists between data obtained with a diversity of procedures. On this central issue, there appears to exist agreement as KUMMER et al. (1990, p. 86) suggest the ideal research strategy to be "a continuous chain of conditions from the field to the experimental chamber that carefully monitors and minimizes the distortions which we have to accept in return for solid answers." Ever since the collaboration between Konrad LORENZ, the maestro of observation, and Niko TINBERGEN, the meticulous experimentalist, com- plementarity of methods has been the hallmark of the ethological approach.</page><page sequence="7">COMPLEMENTARY METHODS AND CONVERGENT EVIDENCE 303 Qualitative description "I am a firm believer that without speculation there is no good and original observation" (DARWIN, 1857, in BRENT, 1981, p. 409). "This practice [anecdotalism] is by nature restrictive and nonstatistical, promoting the selection of given events for description without much consideration of the wide popula- tion of events in the classes to which these belong" (SCHNEIRLA, 1972 [1949], p. 201). We know from experience how consequential single events can be. We need to be deceived only once in order to distrust a person for the rest of our lives, and many an academic reputation has been built on a single discovery. In view of the great importance attached to events that can by definition happen only once to a person (e.g. defloration, death), it is curious indeed that science should look down upon unrepeated events. The current fashion of labeling qualitative accounts of remarkable animal behavior as mere "anecdotes", does not do justice to the significance of naturalistic description. With the increasing availability of number-crunching machines, statistics have become the final arbiter of scientific truth so much so that a self-proclaimed "old-timer" recently complained that the reliance on graphs and tables is taking the behavior out of the study of animal behavior (KORTLANDT, 1990). Whatever the merits of quantification- and there are many-we should not forget the fundamental importance of N = 1 type observations. Counting is something every student can learn; inspired observation is a talent that requires basic curiosity, atten- tion to detail, and ceaseless speculation about cause and effect. Progress in ethology owes a great deal to non-systematic observations. Experiments on sign stimuli were inspired by the response of sticklebacks to red mail-delivery trucks in the streets of Leiden (even though the specificity of this response may be questioned; van den ASSEM, 1989), and the study of infanticide in primates began controversially with a missing infant and circumstantial evidence pieced together by SUGIYAMA (1965). The attention of primatologists to one-time social events partly arises from their fascination with their subjects' obvious social intelligence, which manifests itself most strikingly in successful solutions to unusual problems (e.g. GOODALL, 1971, 1986; de WAAL, 1982, 1989a; SMUTS, 1985; WHITEN &amp; BYRNE, 1988; CHENEY &amp; SEYFARTH, 1990a). Some of these solutions are so complex that it is hard to see how they could ever have even been achieved on a trial-and-error basis; it appears more likely that the animal has applied a brand-new combination of past experiences. De WAAL (1982), viewing the joining of separately acquired</page><page sequence="8">304 FRANS B. M. DE WAAL bits of knowledge as indicative of higher cognition, furnished the exam- ple of two female chimpanzees hesitant to break up a sudden quarrel between their offspring; maternal interference often engenders conflict between the mothers themselves. One of the two females solved the apparent dilemma by activating the oldest female of the colony, who was asleep nearby, and pointing at the screaming youngsters. The old female then broke up the fight, and peace was restored. By documenting such rare incidents, primatologists hope to learn how much their animals understand of their relationship network; what their social goals are, and how they try to achieve these. No human observer can do so without preconceived notions. Since these notions are not necessarily explicit, the most telling "anecdote" is ofen like a key: it fits a keyhole that we were unaware of, unlocking a line of thought for which the groundwork had already been laid unconsciously. LORENZ (1981, p. 45) referred to this mysterious preparedness in relation to his own obser- vations: "One day, after a long period of unconscious data accumula- tion, the Gestalt that has been sought is there, often coming completely unexpected and like a revelation, but full of the power to convince". Qualitative accounts contribute significantly to our estimation of a species' mental level, which estimation in turn affects what kind of hypotheses we are willing to contemplate. MORGAN (1903) appreciated the importance of congruous evidence when he added a little-known qualification to his famous canon concerning the desirability of low-level explanations: "...the canon by no means excludes the interpretation of a particular activity in terms of the higher processes if we already have independent evidence of the occurrences of these higher processes in the animal under investigation" (p. 59). This qualification, brought to the attention of ethologists by BURGHARDT (1985), encourages us to consider a wide array of hypotheses in case of the mentally most advanced animal species. It is of course precisely this issue of convergent information with which I am most concerned here. What replicability is for systematic research, consistency is for qualitative accounts. For no other animal species do we have as consis- tent a picture of higher mental capacities as for the chimpanzee. Reading through the corpus of available accounts of tactical deception in this species, for example, one cannot but recognize a common pattern (de WAAL, 1986; BYRNE &amp; WHITEN, 1990). Deception is expected to be rare almost by definition, and each instance has its unique characteristics, yet with so many observations pointing in the same direction the whole becomes more convincing than the sum of its parts. What it convinces</page><page sequence="9">COMPLEMENTARY METHODS AND CONVERGENT EVIDENCE 305 us of is that there is definitely something worth further investigation, or as WHITEN &amp; BYRNE (1988) put it, that there is a jumping off point for more systematic work. This is the most important function of qualitative accounts of rare social events: to dramatize questions about behavior and provide food for thought and continued research. In a time in which scientific journals discourage the submission of purely descriptive papers (e.g. ethograms)-based on the erroneous assumption that ethology has reached the lofty stage of a deductive science-it is good to realize how much our field still depends on the naturalist's eye, which is capable of raising questions that no one could anticipate because it sees details that no theory talks about (see HEINRICH, 1989, for an illustrative nonprimate example). Ultimately, control over variables is required to prove the existence of a particular mental or social capacity. The dilemma of the ethologist is that experimental settings enabling such control tend to obscure or distort the biological meaning of the capacity. A second purpose of qualitative accounts of rare social events is, therefore, to indicate how a particular capacity is used in daily life, hence what its adaptive significance might be (KUMMER, 1982). Take WOODRUFF &amp; PREMACK'S (1979) experimental evidence for deception in chimpanzees. Considered in isolation, it is hard to make sense of their results as chimpanzees do not normally find their food in containers, and thus lack the opportunity to mislead competitors by pointing at empty containers. A functional understanding-as well as an appreciation of the value of naturalistic observation for experimental design-requires that WOODRUFF &amp; PREMACK'S (1979) experiment be tied in with MENZEL'S (1971) elegant open-field tests on communication about food location; numerous accounts of deception of humans by apes (e.g. HEBB, 1946; HEDIGER, 1955; HUBSCH, 1970; SAVAGE-RUMBAUGH &amp; MCDONALD, 1988), and reports of spontaneous deceit regarding food among chimpanzees (e.g. GOODALL, 1971, p. 96; de WAAL, 1982, p. 74; NISHIDA, 1990, p. 286). It is this combination of diverse information that makes the strongest case that chimpanzees can be intentionally deceptive, and that the laboratory results do not represent some conditioned pseudo-capacity a la Clever Hans. Despite the crucial role of qualitative description, the approach has obvious limitations and dangers if used in isolation. The business of science is to formulate and compare alternative hypotheses; qualitative methods are simply not suited for this purpose. They may play a restricted role in that one could, for instance, collect examples of animals</page><page sequence="10">306 FRANS B. M. DE WAAL not taking advantage of rare opportunities, which may indicate their lack of understanding of a situation. Efforts to establish the skills and capacities of our subjects could thus be matched by efforts to establish their cognitive limitations. Yet, it is evident that if it comes to comparing alternative hypotheses, quantitative description and experimentation are the only suitable instruments. Quantitative description "What I am calling for is a critical anthropomorphism, and predictive inference that encourages the use of data from many sources (prior experiments, anecdotes, publica- tions, one's thoughts and feelings, neuroscience, imagining being the animal, naturalistic observations... etc.). But however eclectic in origin, the product must be an inference that can be tested or, failing that, can lead to predictions supportable by public data" (BURGHARDT, 1985, p. 917). Uncontrolled observations. It is a matter of debate whether, when judging the parsimony of an explanation, greater weight should be assigned to the number of assump- tions or their level. Proximate explanations of behavior range from mechanistic, cognitively undemanding hypotheses to hypotheses that assume a high level of social awareness and intentionality. The task of the investigator is to narrow this range as much as possible. At the low end of the spectrum, this is accomplished by determining the cognitively least onerous hypothesis than cannot be rejected: animals could be acting at random; on a stimulus-response basis, or as a result of "mere" condi- tioning. Instead of being satisfied with the most conservative explanation, however-as behaviorists would like us to be-a second goal is to deter- mine the highest level explanation that appears reasonable given the species' general intelligence level. We obviously should avoid introduc- ing capacities for which absolutely no evidence can be produced, yet we would do wise to consider hypotheses involving capacities for which evidence does exist in the species, even if this evidence is of a qualitative nature and only indirectly related to the behavior under consideration (cf. MORGAN, 1903, quoted above). This is particularly relevant if our obser- vations are more elegantly explained on the basis of advanced cognition, i.e. if the number of assumptions and causal steps can be reduced, and the range of circumstances under which the behavior manifests itself can be better accounted for, by moving up on the scale of cognitive assumptions.</page><page sequence="11">COMPLEMENTARY METHODS AND CONVERGENT EVIDENCE 307 This usually leaves quite a number of possible explanations as the "workspace" of the open-minded investigator. To occupy the entire workspace may lead to an occasional overestimation of cognitive com- plexity, yet this can hardly be considered dangerous after decades of systematic underestimation. We certainly have enough accumulated evidence to analyze primate behavior with a much richer set of cognitive assumptions than the behavior of, say, sticklebacks. I will illustrate this research strategy with the problem of so-called separating interventions. A separating intervention occurs when one individual breaks up an affiliative contact between two others through inter-position, aggression, or threat display. In the chimpanzee colony of the Arnhem Zoo, the majority of such interventions is performed by adult males in response to an approach between other adults. The actor will either charge directly at the other individuals or display in close vicinity until one of the two, or both, depart. The generally short response latency to a newly established contact and the abrupt ending of the male's display once the targeted contact has been terminated strongly suggest goal-directedness (i.e. a feed-back loop in which the behavior's duration is regulated by its effects). I have interpreted separating interventions as the actor's attempt to protect his own alliances while politically isolating his rivals, i.e. as a "divide-and-rule" strategy preven- ting the formation of alliances hostile to the actor. This hypothesis is based on the observation that interveners almost exclusively target con- tenders for their own rank at moments when these contenders are in pro- ximity to suitable alliance partners, such as other adult males or high- ranking females (de WAAL, 1978, 1982). This high-level hypothesis may be contrasted to one that does not assume strategic calculation. For example, adult males may display against rivals regardless of the kind of activity in which these rivals are engaged. This may occasionally result in the disruption of ongoing activities, such as an affiliative contact, without any intention on the actor's part. Such indiscriminate intervention would mean that the rate of interventions by A in B's contacts with C would be proportional to the amount of time B and C spend in association. By determining the association rates of each male with other adults we were able to correct for the number of opportunities for intervention. The study was con- ducted by Otto ADANG, in the summer of 1979, when the alpha male was Nikkie, who had achieved his rank with the support of a senior male, Yeroen. Nikkie was by far the most active intervener in the colony. He was</page><page sequence="12">308 FRANS B. M. DE WAAL observed to make 125 separating interventions, the majority of which targeted his rival, Luit. Had Nikkie's interventions been distributed according to the association rates among adults, only 11% of his interventions in Luit's contacts would have concerned contacts of Luit with Yeroen. The observed percentage of 45% interventions by Nikkie in Yeroen-Luit contacts significantly exceeded this expectation, however, whereas the frequencies for all other triadic combinations involving Luit and Nikkie fell below expectation (ADANG, unpubl.). We therefore reject the idea that separating interventions are indiscriminately made. There remain other minimalist explanations, however. It could be that Nikkie's own association with his alliance partner, Yeroen, created greater opportunities for Nikkie to intervene in Yeroen's contacts. Com- bined with Nikkie's tendency to display against his rival, Luit, this might have led him to frequently disrupt Yeroen-Luit contacts. Note the increased number of assumptions in this explanation. It is contradicted by observations of Nikkie hurrying from great distances to make an intervention after he had noticed Luit together with Yeroen (yet, never if Luit's partner was a low-ranking adult or a juvenile). Thus far, the divide-and-rule hypothesis has offered the best predic- tions of the distribution of separating interventions in the colony. The above result is a case in point: association between one's main supporter and one's main rival is potentially a very dangerous situation, precisely the situation to which a consistently negative response is to be expected. Changes in the colony's alliance structure, such as those caused by the death of one of the adult males, have been followed by changes in the pat- tern of separating interventions that corroborate the idea that this behavior serves to protect existing alliances and prevent the formation of alliances that might undermine the alpha male's position (de WAAL, 1989a; ADANG, pers. comm.). Furthermore, this explanation does not appear to introduce any new or improbable cognitive capacities as there exists empirical evidence for planning and foresight in the chimpanzee (e.g. D6HL, 1968, 1970). Another partially cognitive hypothesis concerning primate social strategies is the grooming model of SEYFARTH (1977). Accordingly, female cercopithecine monkeys compete over access to dominant females, resulting in disproportional contact and grooming between close-ranking females. The hypothetical reason for the competition is that dominant females offer agonistic support, tolerance at feeding sites, or other benefits to females who regularly groom them. This model has inspired a number of detailed observational studies that test its predic-</page><page sequence="13">COMPLEMENTARY METHODS AND CONVERGENT EVIDENCE 309 tions or try to account for observed grooming distributions with a simpler set of assumptions (e.g. kinship among close-ranking females). Whereas our studies on rhesus monkeys suggest that frequent grooming between females of similar rank is the product of mutual attraction rather than social competition, other aspects of the model have been corroborated (e.g. SEYFARTH, 1980, 1983; SILK, 1982; de WAAL &amp; LUTTRELL, 1986; MEHLMAN &amp; CHAPAIS, 1988). A correlation between preferential associa- tion, including frequent grooming by the subordinate, and reduced com- petition over food and water, based on tolerance by the dominant, sup- ports the idea of an exchange of benefits between female rhesus monkeys (de WAAL, 1991). The well-known limitation of correlational approaches makes addi- tional evidence necessary before we would accept a contingency between the performance and receipt of beneficial behavior; a requirement for genuine reciprocity (TRIVERS, 1971). One way to address this issue is through sequential analyses of the exchange of grooming, agonistic sup- port, and social tolerance. Consistent with the reciprocity hypothesis, rhesus monkeys tend to contact supporters immediately following an incident in which support was received (de WAAL &amp; YOSHIHARA, 1983), and vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops) pay more attention to experimental playbacks of agonistic vocalizations if the vocalizer recently groomed them (SEYFARTH &amp; CHENEY, 1984). In chimpanzees (which may possess a more developed reciprocity system than cercopithecine monkeys), finally, it was demonstrated that an individual, A, is more likely to share food with B after B had groomed A, but less likely after A had groomed B. This suggests a turn-taking rule in the exchange of favors, which rule may prevent a one-sided accumulation of benefits (de WAAL, 1989b). Quantitative description of social interactions and relationships, a staple ingredient of primatological research (e.g. ALTMANN, 1974), thus helps narrow the range of tenable hypotheses about social strategies. Yet, if the rejection of certain simple explanations makes us look more favorably at high-level cognitive explanations, it is good to realize that this is where research into social cognition begins, not where it ends. The cognitive implications of social reciprocity are scarcely understood, and the above studies indicate but cannot prove that reciprocity in nonhuman primates is regulated by some of the same complex abilities present in our own species. This leaves a range of possible explanations if primates mutually assist one another. Thus, according to BERCOVITCH (1988), NoE (1990), and NOE et al. (1991) cooperation is largely based on oppor-</page><page sequence="14">310 FRANS B. M. DE WAAL tunistic but intelligent choices in a "market" of suitable partners, whereas de WAAL &amp; LUTTRELL (1988) and de WAAL (1989b) suggest men- tal record-keeping of both beneficial and harmful acts. Controlled observations. Controlled observation is a pseudo-experimental procedure open to field workers and students of animals in naturalistic captive settings. The principle is that one waits for a spontaneous instance of a social behavior of which the effect needs to be measured. Immediately following the occurrence of the behavior, its performer (or recipient) is made the focal subject of an observation session during which the ensuing events are recorded. This post-behavior observation is compared with a control observation that was not preceded by the behavior in question. Each con- trol observation is matched to a post-behavior observation in as many characteristic as possible, i.e. focal subject, duration, time of day, loca- tion, etc. Pairwise comparisons between a large number of post-behavior and control observations allows the investigator to evaluate the effect of the one characteristic in which all observations differ, namely the prior occurrence of the behavior. This observation procedure follows the same principle as an experimental procedure by trying to control as many variables as possible in order to isolate the effect of the one independent variable in which one is interested. One obvious limitation, compared to an experiment, is the reliance on spontaneous events. Consequently, the distribution of obser- vations over subjects and circumstances cannot always be predicted. Because it is impossible to control for all possible variables (e.g. weather conditions, activity level of the group), all that can be done is match the two types of observation with respect to those variables most in need of control. The procedure of controlled observation, introduced by de WAAL &amp; YOSHIHARA (1983), has been applied in studies of primate reconciliation behavior. Two individuals are followed for a certain length of time following a fight in which they opposed one another. The purpose is to measure their tendency to initiate nonagonistic contact or proximity. Apart from the null-hypothesis that aggression does not affect subsequent behavior, the following two hypotheses have been compared. Dispersal hypothesis, i.e. if aggression is a spacing mechanism, one predicts a decreased probability of contact between individuals following aggressive behavior (e.g. HEDIGER, 1941; SCOTT, 1958). Reconciliation hypothesis, i.e.</page><page sequence="15">COMPLEMENTARY METHODS AND CONVERGENT EVIDENCE 311 if individuals try to undo the damage that aggression inflicts upon valuable social relationships, one predicts a) an increased contact proba- bility following aggression, and b) the use of special affiliative gestures (de WAAL &amp; van ROOSMALEN, 1979). A variety of control procedures has been employed in reconciliation research, ranging from control observations on the next day, starting at exactly the same time of day as when the agonistic incident had occurred, to control observations starting when the two individuals under con- sideration initiated proximity in the absence of agonistic behavior. Despite the variation in control procedures, attraction between former opponents has been reported by all investigators (i.e. an increase in con- tact, or at least proximity, during post-conflict as compared to control observations), and in several species behavior during post-conflict re- unions differed dramatically from behavior during control contacts (de WAAL &amp; YOSHIHARA, 1983; de WAAL &amp; REN, 1988; YORK &amp; ROWELL, 1988; AURELI et al., 1989; CHENEY &amp; SEYFARTH, 1989; JUDGE, 1991; REN et al., in press). Controlled observation can be applied to a wide range of behavior (e.g. vocal communication; BAUERS &amp; de WAAL, in press), and may prove particularly useful in the study of social strategy. The procedure has the great advantage over sequential analysis that it sets up a test situation with a clear "yes" or "no" answer as to the outcome of predictions. Natural experiments. Certain social phenomena cannot be transferred to the laboratory. For example, it would be impossible to recreate the dominance struggles observed in the Arnhem chimpanzee colony, in all their intensity, in a more restricted environment. It takes a very strong motivation on the part of the males to engage in these drawn-out processes, a motivation probably requiring the presence of females. Furthermore, escape routes would be necessary to prevent bloodshed, and a fair number of potential alliance partners would be required for the strategic choices that make these processes interesting in the first place. In short, one would end up with a situation similar to the Arnhem exhibit. Our method in Arnhem was to collect both qualitative and quan- titative data in order to take full advantage of spontaneous dominance struggles. Every social event was considered of significance; some events could be quantified (e.g. grooming, coalition formation), other events were too rare for this (e.g. physical fights, deception). The rare events</page><page sequence="16">312 FRANS B. M. DE WAAL taken together, however, constituted an essential part of the overall pic- ture without which the quantitative data would have been meaningless (de WAAL, 1982). In relation to spontaneous rank upheavals, CHANCE et al. (1977) and SMALL (1990) show a similar combination of attention to rare but socially significant events and traditional quantitative measures. When the established order is challenged or otherwise dramatically upset we encounter a rare opportunity to document the "high end" of a species' abilities for social manipulation. It is during these situations that we expect the animals to demonstrate their social skills and knowledge at full capacity because there is much at stake (sometimes their lives and always their social future) and they are, through years of experience with one another, thoroughly familiar with the setting. Each of these "natural experiments" is of course unique, yet never totally so. Careful study may allow the compilation of a list of common strategic choices for a species. The cognitive capacities implied by these choices may then inspire experimental research on strategic abilities. Experimentation "... it is the holist who sees and understands the dimensions of the problem and it is the reductionist who in the long run will produce the most satisfying type of explanation" (BONNER, 1980, p. 8). Experimental research on primate social cognition can be divided into a) studies manipulating the social system to measure the interplay between its components, and b) studies explicitly concerning the animals' knowledge of social relationships, of others' perceptions, of the effects of their own behavior on others, and so on. The first category of studies, while not producing direct evidence on cognition, document causal rela- tions that are often hard to explain without assuming detailed social knowledge in the subjects. These experiments generally underpin and extend knowledge gained from observational research, such as research on alliance formation (VARLEY &amp; SYMMES, 1966; CHAPAIS, 1988), and male-female bonding (KUMMER et al., 1974; BACHMANN &amp; KUMMER, 1980). A good example of this type of approach concerns the function of reconciliation behavior. As reflected in its label, the hypothetical function of this behavior is the restoration of a peaceful, operative relationship. Yet, it is not enough to establish (as done by Gerard WILLEMSEN and myself in an unpublished study of the Arnhem chimpanzees) that the probability of revival of aggressive conflict is significantly reduced follow-</page><page sequence="17">COMPLEMENTARY METHODS AND CONVERGENT EVIDENCE 313 ing reconciliation because there exist two competing explanations for such a result: 1) a friendly reunion between former opponents may cause a reduction in antagonism, or 2) a friendly reunion may reflect a low level of residual antagonism. The second explanation needs to be excluded before a conciliatory effect of reconciliation can be accepted. Experimental approaches to this issue may take advantage of competitive responses to food in order to measure the effect of aggression on subse- quent behavior (cf. de WAAL, 1984; CORDS, 1988). One year ago, CORDS (1990) reported an original experiment in which affiliative contact following food-induced aggression between two longtail macaques (Macacafascicularis) was either prevented or allowed. After this, the two monkeys were presented with a resource that could be jointly exploited. Pairs that had engaged in affiliative contact following their aggression showed greater compatibility, as measured by proximity during the resource test, than pairs that had been distracted by the experimenter in order to prevent reconciliation. This experimental result strongly supports a conciliatory function of post-conflict reunion, i.e. the restoration of a tolerant attitude in the dominant and a corresponding reduction of fear in the subordinate. Experiments explicitly addressing social cognition began with MENZEL'S (1971) demonstration that chimpanzees recognize the knowledge of one among them about the location of hidden food. His tests further strongly suggested the occurrence of intentionally misleading communication, an aspect brought under closer experimental control by WOODRUFF &amp; PREMACK (1979). As to the attribution of knowledge to others, it has been suggested that this capacity requires self- consciousness and should correlate with the capacity to recognize oneself in a mirror. The idea is that a concept of self allows an organism to use its own experience as a model for the experiences of others under similar conditions (GALLUP, 1983). The outcome of recent experiments is consis- tent with this prediction in that macaques, which lack mirror self- recognition, failed to show sensitivity to the knowledge states of con- specifics, whereas chimpanzees, which do show self-recognition, appeared capable of modeling the visual perspectives of others (CHENEY &amp; SEYFARTH, 1990b; POVINELLI et al., 1990). These two experiments were far from identical, however, and further comparisons remain needed. STAMMBACH (1988) investigated the related issue of recognition of another individual's special skills. He trained a low-ranking longtail macaque to manipulate a food-dispensing apparatus. Other monkeys in the group soon learned to take advantage of this individual's abilities,</page><page sequence="18">314 FRANS B. M. DE WAAL and even began treating this individual differently outside the experimental situation. Their increased grooming of the "specialist" agrees with the previously discussed reciprocity models according to which grooming may be part of beneficial exchanges. A very promising experimental paradigm is the presentation of specific visual or auditory stimuli. Visual representations of conspecifics have recently been tested on primates by DASSER (1987, 1988), DEMARIA &amp; THIERRY (1988), and JUDGE et al. (in press). Of particular interest is DASSER'S (1988) finding that macaques can correctly discriminate and match slides of group members using a category analogous to mother- child bond, thus exhibiting knowledge of relationships in which the sub- ject itself is not involved. Known as "triadic awareness" (de WAAL, 1982), this capacity has also been implicated by systematic studies of spontaneous social behavior (e.g. CHENEY &amp; SEYFARTH, 1986; de WAAL, 1990; JUDGE, 1991). Auditory stimuli, on the other hand, have been used extensively in field experiments with wild vervet monkeys. For a review of this research see CHENEY &amp; SEYFARTH (1990a), who designed critical tests of the knowledge involved in the matrilineal social organization of cercopithecine primates. As this incomplete overview shows, experimental research on primate social cognition is a growing area. It nicely complements observational studies, while increasing the precision of our understanding through manipulation of the animal's experiences and available information. Such manipulation brings a final touch to studies of social cognition that is often critical for a conclusive comparison of competing hypotheses. Apart from this confirmatory role, it is conceivable that experimental research will reveal forms of social cognition unsuspected by the field observer. In this case, the roles will be reversed, and capacities discovered in the laboratory will be investigated in naturalistic settings. Confirmation of experimental findings in the field is all the more important as such findings can be profoundly misleading, particularly if the experimenter had no regard for a species' natural behavior. As a war- ning, we have the amusing case of GUTHRIE &amp; HORTON (1946), who thought they had trained domestic cats to perform a rather complex response. This response, however, turned out to be a species-typical greeting gesture (flank-rubbing) that occurs in response to friendly humans regardless of reinforcement (MOORE &amp; STUTTARD, 1979). Intimate knowledge of the species under consideration, and close obser- vation of its behavior during the experiment, distinguish ethological experiments from the Skinnerbox approach.</page><page sequence="19">COMPLEMENTARY METHODS AND CONVERGENT EVIDENCE 315 Conclusion "The objective categorization missed something in the behavior of the chimpanzee that the ill-defined categories of emotion and the like did not - some order, or relationship between isolated acts that is essential to comprehension of the behavior" (HEBB, 1946, p. 88). There are many elements involved in the subjective judgement of behavior, from past experience with the performing individual to the behavior's apparent goal-orientation as reflected in the way it is regulated by its effects. Whereas the human ability to read subtle clues and judge an animal's feeling and intentions is of proven value in relation to captive primates (HEBB, 1946; MENZEL, 1979), the insights it provides are difficult to make explicit. As a consequence, these insights are not always respected by or directly useful to science. For example, de WAAL &amp; HOEKSTRA (1980) successfully predicted aggressive behavior among chimpanzees on the basis of intuitive assessments of unpleasant (and probably frustrating) social situations, yet were unable to translate these intuitions into equally predictive objective definitions. Intuition is never eliminated from science, however. It is a major hid- den influence; the source of many of our best ideas. Once these ideas have reached the stage of empirical research, theoretical and methodo- logical considerations take over, and the research is elevated to a level of precision and quantification that makes naturalistic descriptions, anec- dotes, and subjective judgements seem soft and unscientific. Such a con- demnation, however, would be like biting the hand that feeds us. It seems more constructive to recognize the strengths and weaknesses of each of the links in the chain of knowledge. In the same way that we will be skeptical about an experimental result that counters everything we know about a species' natural behavior, we will question causal relations derived from descriptive research if none of these relations, not even in simplified form, can be experimentally replicated. Students of social cognition need to develop a methodology that negotiates between the richness of context and the multitude of social options open to the animal under natural conditions and the more con- trolled but also more limited experimental setting. The study of natural- sized groups of animals in captive settings provides an important intermediate between these extremes, with limited control over variables. Instead of the traditional dichotomy between field and laboratory, naturalist and experimentalist, holist and reductionist, we need every technique and approach we can muster at the present stage of research into social cognition. Ideally, evidence from a great variety of sources converges on particular explanations.</page><page sequence="20">316 FRANS B. M. DE WAAL Summary Studies of primate social cognition aim at a) documentation of social behaviors that appear to require an understanding in the animals of their own relationships and the rela- tionships among others; an ability to anticipate behavioral effects; intentionality, and so on, and b) determination of the psychological mechanisms and mental abilities underly- ing this complex sociality. Thus far, the first area of investigation, which is largely descriptive, has reveived more attention than the second. The most parsimonious assumption concerning nonhuman primates is that if their behavior resembles human behavior the psychological and mental processes involved are probably similar too. This is not the same as uncritically accepting the existence of these processes; alternative hypotheses need to be formulated and tested. The present paper advocates research over a broad spectrum, with reliance on a variety of methods, and emphasis on covergent evidence. Because each method has its own strengths and weaknesses, the most convincing support for a particular explanation will involve data from a number of sources, both observational and experimental. Four research methods are discussed: Qualitative description. Sometimes referred to as "anecdotalism", this method seeks to document the animals' spontaneous solutions to unusual social problems, and exploita- tion of rare opportunities. This method provides a starting point for research if it suggests remarkable cognitive capacities. It is unsuitable, however, for a conclusive comparison of alternative explanations. Quantitative description. The first goal of systematic research is to delineate the range of tenable hypotheses about the phenomenon of interest, i. e. to establish the cognitively least demanding explanation that cannot be rejected as well as the most demanding explana- tion that seems reasonable given the species' general intelligence level. The second goal is to compare alternative explanations. The advantage of quantitative description is that it can be applied in natural or naturalistic settings; the disadvantage is that it lacks control over variables. Controlled observation. A pseudo-experimental procedure that aims at controlling certain variables. An observation following a particular event is compared with an observation unpreceded by the same event but matched to the first observation on a number of other dimensions. A disadvantage, compared to experimentation, is the dependency on spon- taneous events. Experimentation. Manipulation of the animal's experience and available information is a powerful tool to select among alternative cognitive explanations. The disadvantage is that this procedure requires an unusual environment and human involvement, both of which may alter behavior. Experimental results are particularly convincing, therefore, if they agree with knowledge gained by means of observational techniques. References ALTMANN, J. (1974).
