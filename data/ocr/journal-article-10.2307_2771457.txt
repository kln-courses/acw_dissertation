Such a society is small, isolated, nonliterate, and homogeneous, with a strong sense of group solidarity. The ways of living are conventionalized into that coherent system which we call "a culture." Behavior is traditional, spontaneous, uncritical, and personal; there is no legisla- tion or habit of experiment and reflection for intellectual ends. Kinship, its relationships and institutions, are the type categories of experience and the familial group is the unit of action. The sacred prevails over the secular; the economy is one of status rather than of the market. These and related characterizations may be restated in terms of "folk mentality." In studying societies comparatively, or one society in the course of change, with the aid of these conceptions, problems arise and are, in part, solved as to the necessary or probable interrelations of some of the elements of the ideal folk society with others. One such relationship is that between disorganization of culture and secularization. I Understanding of society in general and of our own modern urbanized society in par- ticular can be gained through consideration of the societies least like our own: the primi- tive, or folk, societies.' All societies are alike in some respects, and each differs from others in other respects; the further assump- tion made here is that folk societies have certain features in common which enable us to think of them as a type-a type which contrasts with the society of the modern city.2 I Neither the term "primitive" nor any other is denotative, and none has sufficient generally ac- cepted precise meaning to allow us to know in just what characters of a society to discover the degree to which it is or is not "primitive," "simple," or whatever. The words "nonliterate" or "preliterate" do call attention to a particular character, literacy, but understanding is still required as to when a society is "literate" and as to what form or degree of literacy has significance. There are head-hunting tribes, in other respects as primitive as were the Pawnee Indians in the seventeenth century, that have knowledge of writing. In certain Mexican villages most children and many adults have formal knowledge of the arts' of reading and writing, but in most other respects these village societies are much more like tribal societies than they are like our west- ern cities. The word "folk," which will be used in this paper, is no more precise than any other. It is used here because, better than others, it suggests the in- clusion in our comparisons of peasant and rustic people who are not wholly independent of cities and because in its compounds, "folklore" and "folk song," it points, in a rough way, to the presence of folklore and folk songs, as recognized by the collec- tor of such materials, as a sign of a society to be ex- amined in making up the characterization of the ideal type with which we are here concerned. But the question of the word to be used is of small im- portance. 2 The reader may compare the conception de- veloped in this paper with the ideal "sacred society" characterized by Howard Becker in "Ionia and Athens" (Ph.D. dissertation, University of Chicago, I930), pp. i-I6; with similar conceptions developed 293</page><page sequence="2">294 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY This type is ideal, a mental construction. No known society precisely corresponds with it, but the societies which have been the chief interest of the anthropologist most closely approximate it. The construction of the type depends, indeed, upon special knowledge of tribal and peasant groups. The ideal folk society could be defined through assembling, in the imagination, the characters which are logically opposite those which are to be found in the modern city, only if we had first some knowledge of nonurban peoples to permit us to determine what, indeed, are the characteristic features of modern city living. The complete pro- cedure requires us to gain acquaintance with many folk societies in many parts of the world and to set down in words general enough to describe most of them those char- acteristics which they have in common with each other and which the modern city does not have. In short, we move from folk society to folk society, asking ourselves what it is about them that makes them like each other and different from the modern city. So we assemble the elements of the ideal type. The more elements we add, the less will any one real society correspond to it. As the type is constructed, real societies may be ar- ranged in an order of degree of resemblance to it. The conception develops that any one real society is more or less "folk." But the more elements we add, the less possible it becomes to arrange real societies in a single order of degree of resemblance to the type, because one of two societies will be found to resemble the ideal type strongly in one char- acter and weakly in another, while in the next society strong resemblance will lie in the latter character and not in the former. This situation, however, is an advantage, for it enables us to ask and perhaps answer questions, first, as to whether certain char- acters tend to be found together in most societies, and then, if certain of them do, why. Anyone attempting to describe the ideal folk society must take account of and in large degree include certain characteriza- tions which have been made of many stu- dents, each of whom has been attentive to some but not to all aspects of the contrast between folk and modern urban society. Certain students have derived the character- ization from examination of a number of folk societies and have generalized upon them in the light of contrast provided by modern urban society; the procedure defined above and followed by the writer. This is illustrated by Goldenweiser's characteriza- tion of five primitive societies. He says that they are small, isolated, nonliterate; that they exhibit local cultures; that they are relatively homogeneous with regard to the distribution of knowledge, attitudes, and functions among the population; that the individual does not figure as a con- spicuous unit; and that knowledge is not explicitly systematized.3 In other cases the students have com- pared the state of certain societies at an early time with the same, or historical descendant of the same, society at a later time. In this way Maine arrived at his in- fluential contrasts between society based on kinship and society based on territory, and between a society of status and one of con- tract.4 In the case of this procedure, as in the case of the next, broad and illuminating con- ceptions are offered us to apply to folk so- cieties as we contrast them with modern urban society, We are to find out if one of the contrasting terms is properly applicable to folk society and the other term to modern urban society. In the work of still other students there is apparent no detailed comparison of folk with urbanized societies or of early society with later; rather, by inspection of our own in chapter i of Social Thought from Lore to Science by Harry Elmer Barnes and Howard Becker (Bos- ton, New York: D. C. Heath &amp; Co., 1938); and with the application of the conception in The Sociology of the Renaissance by Alfred von Martin (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Truburn &amp; Co., Ltd., I945). 3A. A.

This procedure is perhaps never fol- lowed in the unqualified manner just de- scribed, for in the instances about to be mentioned there is evidence that folk or ancient society has been compared with modern urbanized society. Nevertheless, the emphasis placed by men of this group is upon characteristics which, contrasting logically, in real fact coexist in every society and help to make it up. Here belongs T6n- nies' contrast between Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft, or that aspect of society which appears in the relations that develop with- out the deliberate intention of anyone out of the mere fact that men live together, as con- trasted with that aspect of society which appears in the relations entered into de- liberately by independent individuals through agreement to achieve certain recog- nized ends.5 Comparable is Durkheim's dis- tinction between that social solidarity which results from the sharing of common atti- tudes and sentiments and that which results from the complementary functional useful- nesses of the members of the group. In the "social segment"-the form of society exist- ing in terms of "mechanical solidarity"-the law is "repressive"; in the "social organ"- the form of society existing in terms of "organic solidarity"-the law is "restitu- tive."6 It may be asked how closely the con- structed type arrived at by any one in- vestigator who follows the procedure sketched above will resemble that reached by another doing the same. It may be sup- posed that to the extent to which the real societies examined by the one investigator constitute a sample of the range and variety of societies similar to the sample constituted by the societies examined by the other, and to the extent that the general conceptions tentatively held by the one are similar to those held by the other, the results will be (except as modified by other factors) the same. For the purposes of understanding which are served by the method of the con- structed type, however, it is not necessary to consider the question. The type is an im- agined entity, created only because through it we may hope to understand reality. Its function is to suggest aspects of real so- cieties which deserve study, and especially to suggest hypotheses as to what, under cer- tain defined conditions, may be generally true about society. Any ideal type will do, although it is safe to assert that that ideal construction has most heuristic value which depends on close and considered knowledge of real folk societies and which is guided by an effective scientific imagination-what- ever that may be. II "The conception of a 'primitive society' which we ought to form," wrote Sumner, "is that of small groups scattered over a terri- tory."7 The folk society is a small society. There are no more people in it than can come to know each other well, and they remain in long association with each other. Among the Western Shoshone the individual parental family was the group which went about, apart from other families, collecting food; a group of families would assemble and so re- main for a few weeks, from time to time, to hunt together; during the winter months such a group of families would form a single camp.8 Such a temporary village included perhaps a hundred people.

The folk society is an isolated society. Probably there is no real society whose members are in complete ignorance of the existence of people other than themselves; the Andamanese, although their islands were avoided by navigators for centuries, knew of outsiders and occasionally came in contact with Malay or Chinese visitors.I0 Nevertheless, the folk societies we know are made up of people who have little communi- cation with outsiders, and we may conceive of the ideal folk society as composed of per- sons having communication with no out- sider. This isolation is one half of a whole of which the other half is intimate communica- tion among the members of the society. A group of recent castaways is a small and isolated society, but it is not a folk society; and if the castaways have come from differ- ent ships and different societies, there will have been no previous intimate communica- tion among them, and the society will not be composed of people who are much alike. May the isolation of the folk society be identified with the physical immobility of its members? In building this ideal type, we may conceive of the members of the society as remaining always within the small terri- tory they occupy. There are some primitive peoples who have dwelt from time immemo- rial in the same small valley, and who rarely leave it." Certain of the pueblos of the American Southwest have been occupied by the same people or their descendants for many generations. On the other hand, some of the food-collecting peoples, such as the Shoshone Indians and certain aborigines of Australia, move about within a territory of very considerable extent; and there are Asiatic folk groups that make regular sea- sonal migrations hundreds of miles in extent. It is possible to conceive of the members of such a society as moving about physically without communicating with members of other groups than their own. Each of the Indian villages of the midwest highlands of Guatemala is a folk society distinguishable by its customs and even by the physical type of its members from neighboring villages, yet the people are great travelers, and in the case of one of the most distinct communi- ties, Chichicastenango, most of the men travel far and spend much of their time away from home.I2 This does not result, however, in much intimate communication between those traveling villagers and other peoples. The gipsies have moved about among the various peoples of the earth for generations, and yet they retain many of the characteristics of a folk society. Through books the civilized people com- municate with the minds of other people and other times, and an aspect of the isolation of the folk society is the absence of books. The folk communicate only by word of mouth; therefore the communication upon which understanding is built is only that which takes place among neighbors, within the little society itself. The folk has no access to the thought and experience of the past, whether of other peoples or of their own ancestors, such as books provide. Therefore, oral tradition has no check or competitor. Knowledge of what has gone before reaches no further back than memory and speech be- tween old and young can make it go; behind "the time of our grandfathers" all is legend- ary and vague. With no form of belief estab- lished by, written record, there can be no historical sense, such as civilized people have, no theology, and no basis for science 9 Julian Steward, "Economic and Social Basis of Primitive Bands," Essays in Anthropology Pre- sented to A.

The only form of accumulation of experience, except the tools and other enduring articles of manufacture, is the increase of wisdom which comes as the individual lives longer; therefore the old, knowing more than the young can know until they too have lived that long, have prestige and authority. The people who make up a folk society are much alike. Having lived in long in- timacy with one another, and with no others, they have come to form a single biological type. The somatic homogeneity of local, inbred populations has been noted and studied. Since the people communicate with one another and with no others, one man's learned ways of doing and thinking are the same as another's. Another way of putting this is to say that in the ideal folk society, what one man knows and believes is the same as what all men know and believe. Habits are the same as customs. In real fact, of course, the differences among indi- viduals in a primitive group and the different chances of experience prevent this ideal state of things from coming about. Never- theless, it is near enough to the truth for the student of a real folk society to report it fairly well by learning what goes on in the minds of a few of its members, and a primi- tive group has been presented, although sketchily, as learned about from a single member. The similarity among the members is found also as one generation is compared with its successor. Old people find young people doing, as they grow up, what the old people did at the same age, and what they have come to think right and proper. This is another way of saying that in such a society there is little change. The members -of the folk society have a strong sense of belonging together. The group which an outsider might recognize as composed of similar persons different from members of other groups is also the group of people who see their own resemblances and feel correspondingly united. Communicating intimately with each other, each has a strong claim on the sympathies of the others. Moreover, against such knowledge as they have of societies other than their own, they emphasize their own mutual likeness and value themselves as compared with others. They say of themselves "we" as against all others, who are "they."'3 Thus we may characterize the folk so- ciety as small, isolated, nonliterate, and homogeneous, with a strong sense of group solidarity. Are we not soon to acknowledge the simplicity of the technology of the ideal folk society? Something should certainly be said about the tools and tool-making of this generalized primitive group, but it is not easy to assign a meaning to "simple," in connection with technology which will do justice to the facts as known from the real folk societies. The preciseness with which each tool, in a large number of such tools, meets its needs in the case of the Eskimo, for example, makes one hesitate to use the word "simple." Some negative statements appear to be safe: secondary and tertiary tools-tools to make tools-are relatively few as compared with primary tools; there is no making of artifacts by multiple, rapid, machine manufacture; there is little or no use of natural power. There is not much division of labor in the folk society: what one person does is what another does. In the ideal folk society all the tools and ways of production are shared by everybody. The "everybody" must mean "every adult man" or "every adult woman," for the obvious exception to the homogene- ity of the folk society lies in the differences between what men do and know and what women do and know. These differences are clear and unexceptional (as compared with our modern urban society where they are less so). "Within the local group there is no such thing as a division of labor save as be- tween the sexes," writes Radcliffe-Brown about the Andaman Islanders. ".... Every man is expected to be able to hunt pig, to harpoon turtle and to catch fish, and also to cut a canoe, to make bows and arrows and all the other objects that are made by men.".4 So all men share the same interests X3 Sumner, op. cit., pp. I3-I5.

We may conceive, also, of the ideal folk society as a group economically independent of all others: the people produce what they consume and consume what they produce. Few, if any, real societies are completely in this situation; some Eskimo groups perhaps most closely approach it. Although each little Andamanese band could get along without getting anything from any other, exchange of goods occurred between bands by a sort of periodic gift-giving. The foregoing characterizations amount, roughly, to saying that the folk society is a little world off by itself, a world in which the recurrent problems of life are met by all its members in much the same way. This state- ment, while correct enough, fails to em- phasize an important, perhaps the impor- tant, aspect of the folk society. The ways in which the members of the society meet the recurrent problems of life are convention- alized ways; they are the results of long in- tercommunication within the group in the face of these problems; and these conven- tionalized ways have become interrelated within one another so that they constitute a coherent and self-consistent system. Such a system is what we mean in saying that the folk society is characterized by "a culture." A culture is an organization or integration of conventional understandings. It is, as well, the acts and the objects, in so far as they rep- resent the type characteristic of that society, which express and maintain these under- standings. In the folk society this integrated whole, this system, provides for all the re- current needs of the individual from birth to death and of the society through the seasons and the years. The society is to be described, and distinguished from others, largely by presenting this system. This is not the same as saying, as was said early in this paper, that in the folk so- ciety what one man does is the same as what another man does. What one man does in a mob is the same as what another man does, but a mob is not a folk society. It is, so far as culture is concerned, its very antithesis.'s The members of a mob (which is a kind of "mass") each do the same thing, it is true, but it is a very immediate and particular thing, and it is done without much reference to tradition. It does not depend upon and express a great many conventional under- standings related to one another. A mob has no culture. The folk society exhibits culture to the greatest conceivable degree. A mob is an aggregation of people doing the same simple thing simultaneously. A folk society is an organization of people doing many dif- ferent things successively as well as simul- taneously. The members of a mob act with reference to the same object of attention. The members of a folk society are guided in acting by previously established comprehen- sive and interdependent conventional under- standings; at any one time they do many different things, which are complexly related to one another to express collective senti- ments and conceptions. When the turn comes for the boy to do what a man does, he does what a man does; thus, though in the end the experiences of all individuals of the same sex are alike, the activities of the so- ciety, seen at a moment of time, are diverse, while interdependent and consistent. The Papago Indians, a few hundred of them, constituted a folk society in southern Arizona. Among these Indians a war party was not so simple a thing as a number of men going out together to kill the enemy. It was a complex activity involving every- body in the society both before, during, and after the expedition and dramatizing the religious and moral ideas fundamental to Papago life.'6 Preparation for the expedition involved many practical or ritual acts on the part of the immediate participants, their wives and children, previously successful warriors, and many others. While the party '5 Herbert Blumer, "Mass Behavior and the Motion Picture," Publications of the American Soci- ological Society, XXIX, No. 3 (August, I935), II5-27. i6 Ruth Underhill, The Autobiography of a Papago Woman ("American Anthropological Association, Memoirs," No. 46 1I936]).</page><page sequence="7">THE FOLK SOCIETY 299 was away, the various relatives of the war- riors had many things to do or not to do- prayer, fasting, preparation of ritual para- phernalia, etc. These were specialized ac- tivities, each appropriate to just that kind of relative or other category of person. So the war was waged by everybody. These activities, different and special as they were, interlocked, so to speak, with each other to make a large whole, the society-during-a- war-expedition. And all these specialized activities obeyed fundamental principles, understood by all and expressed and re- affirmed in the very forms of the acts-the gestures of the rituals, the words of songs, the implied or expressed explanations and admonitions of the elders to the younger people. All understood that the end in view was the acquisition by the group of the su- pernatural power of the slain enemy. This power, potentially of great positive value, was dangerous, and the practices and rituals had as their purposes first the success of the war party and then the draining-off of the supernatural power acquired by the slaying into a safe and "usable" form. We may say, then, that in the folk society conventional behavior is strongly patterned: it tends to conform to a type or a norm. These patterns are interrelated in thought and in action with one another, so that one tends to evoke others and to be consistent with the others. Every customary act among the Papago when the successful warriors return is consistent with and is a special form of the general conceptions held as to supernatural power. We may still further say that the patterns of what people think should be done are closely consistent with what they believe is done, and that there is one way, or a very few conventional ways, in which everybody has some understanding and some share, of meeting each need that arises.'7 The culture of a folk society is, therefore, one of those wholes which is greater than its parts. Gaining a livelihood takes support from religion, and the rela- tions of men to men are justified in the con- ceptions held of the supernatural world or in some other aspect of the culture. Life, for the member of the folk society, is not one ac- tivity and then another and different one; it is one large activity out of which one part may not be separated without affecting the rest. A related characteristic of the folk society was implied when it was declared that the specialized activities incident to the Papago war party obeyed fundamental principles understood by all. These "principles" had to do with the ends of living, as conceived by the Papago. A near-ultimate good for the Papago was the acquisition of supernatural power. This end was not questioned; it was a sort of axiom in terms of which many lesser activities were understood. This suggests that we may say of the folk society that its ends are taken as given. The activities inci- dent to the war party may be regarded as merely complementarily useful acts, aspects of the division of labor. They may also, and more significantly, be seen as expressions of unquestioned common ends. The folk so- ciety exists not so much in the exchange of useful functions as in common understand- ings as to the ends given. The ends are not stated as matters of doctrine, but are im- plied by the many acts which make up the living that goes on in the society. Therefore, the morale of a folk society-its power to act consistently over periods of time and to meet crises effectively is not dependent upon dis- cipline exerted by force or upon devotion to some single principle of action but to the concurrence and consistency of many or all of the actions and conceptions which make up the whole round of life. In the trite phrase, the folk society is a "design for liv- ing." What is done in the ideal folk society is done not because somebody or some people decided, at once, that it should be done, but because it seems "necessarily" to flow from the very nature of things. There is, more- over, no disposition to reflect upon tradi- tional acts and consider them objectively and critically. In short, behavior in the folk T7 Ralph Linton, The Study of Man (New York: D. Appleton-Century Co., 1936), chap. xvi, esp. p. 283.</page><page sequence="8">300 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY society is traditional, spontaneous, and uncritical. In any real folk society, of course, many things are done as a result of decision as to that particular action, but as to that class of actions tradition is the sufficient au- thority. The Indians decide now to go on a hunt; but it is not a matter of debate whether or not one should, from time to time, hunt. The folkways are the ways that grow up out of long and intimate association of men with each other; in the society of our con- ception all the ways are folkways. Men act with reference to each other by understand- ings which are tacit and traditional. There are no formal contracts or other agreements. The rights and obligations of the individual come about not by special arrangement; they are, chiefly, aspects of the position of the individual as a person of one sex or the other, one age-group or another, one occupa- tional group or another, and as one occu- pying just that position in a system of rela- tionships which are traditional in the so- ciety. The individual's status is thus in large part fixed at birth; it changes as he lives, but it changes in ways which were "foreordained" by the nature of his par- ticular society. The institutions of the folk society are of the sort which has been called "crescive"; they are not of the sort that is created deliberately for special purposes, as was the juvenile court. So, too, law is made up of the traditional conceptions of rights and obligations and the customary pro- cedures whereby these rights and obliga- tions are assured; legislation has no part in it. If legislation has no part in the law of the ideal folk society, neither has codification, still less jurisprudence. Radin has collected material suggesting the limited extent to which real primitive people do question cus- tom and do systematize their knowledge.'8 In the known folk societies they do these things only to a limited extent. In the ideal folk society there is no objectivity and no systematization of knowledge as guided by what seems to be its "internal" order. The member of this mentally constructed society does not stand off from his customary con- duct and subject it to scrutiny apart from its meaning for him as that meaning is de- fined in culture. Nor is there any habitual exercise of classification, experiment, and abstraction for its own sake, least of all for the sake of intellectual ends. There is com- mon practical knowledge, but there is no science. Behavior in the folk society is highly con- ventional, custom fixes the rights and duties of individuals, and knowledge is not critical- ly examined or objectively and systemati- cally formulated; but it must not be sup- posed that primitive man is a sort of autom- aton in which custom is the mainspring. It would be as mistaken to think of primi- tive man as strongly aware that he is con- strained by custom. Within the limits set by custom there is invitation to excel in performance. There is lively competition, a sense of opportunity, and a feeling that what the culture moves one to do is well worth doing. "There is no drabness in such a life. It has about it all the allurements of per- sonal experience, very much one's own, of competitive skill, of things well done."'9 The interrelations and high degree of con- sistency among the elements of custom which are presented to the individual de- clare to him the importance of making his endeavors in the directions indicated by tradition. The culture sets goals which stimulate action by giving great meaning to it.20 It has been said that the folk society is small and that its members have lived in long and intimate association with one an- other. It has also been said that in such so- cieties there is little critical or abstract thinking. These characteristics are related to yet another characteristic of the folk so- is Paul Radin, Primitive Man as Philosopher (New York: D. Appleton-Century Co., I927). '9 A. A.

A "person" may be defined as that social object which I feel to respond to situations as I do, with all the sentiments and inter- ests which I feel to be my own; a person is myself in another form, his qualities and values are inherent within him, and his sig- nificance for me is not merely one of utility. A "thing," on the other hand, is a social ob- ject which has no claim upon my sympa- thies, which responds to me, as I conceive it, mechanically; its value for me exists in so far as it serves my end. In the folk society all human beings admitted to the society are treated as persons; one does not deal impersonally ("thing-fashion") with any other participant in the little world of that society. Moreover, in the folk society much besides human beings is treated personally. The pattern of behavior which is first sug- gested by the inner experience of the indi- vidual-his wishes, fears, sensitivenesses, and interests of all sorts-is projected into all objects with which he comes into con- tact. Thus nature, too, is treated personally: the elements, the features of the landscape, the animals, and especially anything in the environment which by its appearance or be- havior suggests that it has the attributes of mankind-to all these are attributed quali- ties of the human person.2' In short, the personal and intimate life of the child in the family is extended, in the folk society, into the social world of the adult and even into inanimate objects. It is not merely that relations in such a society are personal; it is also that they are familial. The first contacts made as the infant be- comes a person are with other persons; more- over, each of these first persons, he comes to learn, has a particular kind of relation to him which is associated with that one's genealogical position. The individual finds himself fixed within a constellation of fami- lial relationships. The kinship connections provide a pattern in terms of which, in the ideal folk society, all personal relations are conventionalized and categorized. All rela- tions are personal. But relations are not, in content of specific behavior, the same for everyone. As a mother is different from a father, and a grandson from a nephew, so are these classes of personal relationship, originating in genealogical connection, ex- tended outward into all relationships what- ever. In this sense, the folk society is a familial society. Lowie22 has demonstrated the qualification that is to be introduced into the statement of Maine23 that the primitive society is organized in terms of kinship rather than territory. It is true that the fact that men are neighbors contributes to their sense of belonging together. But the point to be emphasized in understanding the folk society is that whether mere contiguity or relationship as brother or as son is the circumstance uniting men into the society, the result is a group of people among whom prevail the personal and categorized rela- tionships that characterize families as we know them, and in which the patterns of kinship tend to be extended outward from the group of genealogically connected indi- viduals into the whole society. The kin are the type persons for all experience. This general conception may be resolved into component or related conceptions. In the folk society family relationships are clearly distinguished from one another. Very special sorts of behavior may be ex- pected by a mother's brother of his sister's son, and this behavior will be different from that expected by a father's brother of his brother's son. Among certain Australian tribes animals killed by a hunter must be divided so that nine or ten certain parts must be given to nine or ten corresponding relatives of the successful hunter-the right ribs to the father's brother, a piece of the flank to the mother's brother, and so on.:4 The tendency to extend kinship outward 21 Ruth Benedict, "Animism," Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences. 22 Robert H.

In many primi- tive societies kinship terms and kinship be- havior (in reduced degree) are extended to persons not known to be genealogically re- lated at all, but who are nevertheless re- garded as kin. Among the central Aus- tralians, terms of relationship are extended "so as to embrace all persons who come into social contact with one another ..... In this way the whole society forms a body of relatives. "25 In the folk society groupings which do not arise out of genealogical con- nection are few, and those that do exist tend to take on the attributes of kinship. Ritual kinship is common in primitive and peasant societies in the forms of blood brotherhood, godparental relationships, and other cere- monial sponsorships.26 These multiply kin- ship connections; in these cases the par- ticular individuals to be united depend upon choice. Furthermore, there is frequently a recognizedly fictitious or metaphorical use of kinship terms to designate more casual relationships, as between host and guest or between worshipper and deity.27 The real primitive and peasant societies differ very greatly as to the forms assumed by kinship. Nevertheless, it is possible to recognize two main types. In one of these the connection between husband and wife is emphasized, while neither one of the line- ages, matrilineal or patrilineal, is singled out as contrasted with the other. In such a folk society the individual parental family is the social unit, and connections with relatives outside this family are of secondary impor- tance. Such family organization is common where the population is small, the means of livelihood are by precarious collection of wild food, and larger units cannot per- manently remain together because the natu- ral resources will not allow it. But where a somewhat larger population remains to- gether, either in a village or in a migratory band, there often, although by no means al- ways, is found an emphasis upon one line of consaguine connection rather than the other with subordination of the conjugal connec- tion.28 There results a segmentation of the society into equivalent kinship units. These may take the form of extended domestic groups or joint families (as in China) or may include many households of persons related in part through recognized genealogical con- nection and in part through the sharing of the same name or other symbolic designa- tion, in the latter case we speak of the groups as clans. Even in societies where the individual parental family is an independent economic unit, as in the case of the eastern Eskimo, husband and wife never become a new social and economic unit with the com- pleteness that is characteristic of our own society. When a marriage in primitive so- ciety comes to an end, the kinsmen of the dead spouse assert upon his property a claim they have never given up.29 On the whole, we may think of the family among folk peoples as made up of persons con- sanguinely connected. Marriage is, in com- parison with what we in our society directly experience, an incident in the life of the in- dividual who is born, brought up, and dies with his blood kinsmen. In such a society romantic love can hardly be elevated to a major principle. In so far as the consanguine lines are well defined (and in some cases both lines may be of importance to the individual) 30 the folk society may be thought of as composed of families rather than of individuals. It is the familial groups that act and are acted upon. There is strong solidarity within the 25 A. R.

"The clan is a natural mutual aid society .. A member belongs to the clan, he is not his own; if he is wrong, they will right him; if he does wrong, the re- sponsibility is shared by them."X' Thus, in folk societies wherein the tendency to main- tain consanguine connection has resulted in joint families or clans, it is usual to find that injuries done by an individual are regarded as injuries against his kinship group, and the group takes the steps to right the wrong. The step may be revenge regulated by cus- tom or a property settlement. A considerable part of primitive law exists in the regulation of claims by one body of kin against an- other. The fact that the folk society is an or- ganization of families rather than an aggre- gation of individuals is further expressed in many of those forms of marriage in which a certain kind of relative is the approved spouse. The customs by which in many primitive societies a man is expected to marry his deceased brother's widow or a woman to marry her deceased sister's hus- band express the view of marriage as an undertaking between kinship groups. One of the spouses having failed by death, the un- dertaking is to be carried on by some other representative of the family group. Indeed, in the arrangements for marriage-the selec- tion of spouses by their relatives, in bride- price, dowry, and in many forms of familial negotiations leading to a marriage--the nature of marriage as a connubial form of social relations between kindreds finds ex- pression. It has been said in foregoing paragraphs that behavior in the folk society is tradi- tional, spontaneous, and uncritical, that what one man does is much the same as what another man does, and that the pat- terns of conduct are clear and remain con- stant throughout the generations. It has also been suggested that the congruence of all parts of conventional behavior and social institutions with each other contributes to the sense of rightness which the member of the folk society feels to inhere in his tradi- tional ways of action. In the well-known lan- guage of Sumner, the ways of life are folk- ways; furthermore, the folkways tend to be also mores-ways of doing or thinking to which attach notions of moral worth. The value of every traditional act or object or institution is, thus, something which the members of the society are not disposed to call into question; and should the value be called into question, the doing so is resented. This characteristic of the folk society may be briefly referred to by saying that it is a sacred society. In the folk society one may not, without calling into effect negative so- cial sanctions, challenge as valueless what has come to be traditional in that society. Presumably, the sacredness of social ob- jects has its source, in part, at least, in the mere fact of habituation; probably the indi- vidual organism becomes early adjusted to certain habits, motor and mental, and to certain associations between one activity and another or between certain sense ex- periences and certain activities, and it is almost physiologically uncomfortable to change or even to entertain the idea of change. There arises "a feeling of im- propriety of certain forms, of a particular social or religious value, or a superstitious fear of change."32 Probably the sacredness of social objects in the folk society is related also to the fact that in such well-organized cultures acts and objects suggest the tradi- tions, beliefs, and conceptions which all share. There is reason to suppose that when what is traditionally done becomes less meaningful because people no longer know what the acts stand for, life becomes more secular.33 In the repetitious character of conventional action (aside from technical action) we have ritual; in its expressive char- acter we have ceremony; in the folk society ritual tends also to be ceremonious, and 3I Edwin W.

The sacredness of social objects is ap- parent in the ways in which, in the folk so- ciety, such an object is hedged around with restraints and protections that keep it away from the commonplace and the matter-of- fact.34 In the sacred there is alternatively, or in combination, holiness and dangerous- ness. When the Papago Indian returned from a successful war expedition, bringing the scalp of a slain Apache, the head-hairs of the enemy were treated as loaded with a tremendous "charge" of supernatural power; only old men, already successful warriors and purified through religious ritual, could touch the object and make it safe for incorporation into the home of the slayer. Made into the doll-like form of an Apache Indian, it was, at last, after much ceremonial preparation, held for an instant by the members of the slayer's family, ad- dressed in respect and awe by kinship terms, and placed in the house, there to give off protective power.35 The Indians of San Pedro de la Laguna, Guatemala, recognize an officer, serving for life, whose function it is to keep custody of ten or a dozen Latin breviaries printed in the eighteenth century and to read prayers from one or another of these books on certain occasions. No one but this custodian may handle the books, save his assistants on ceremonial occasions, with his permission. Should anyone else touch a book he would go mad or be stricken with blindness. Incense and candles are burnt before the chest containing the books, yet the books are not gods-they are objects of sacredness.36 In the folk society this disposition to re- gard objects as sacred extends, characteris- tically, even into the subsistence activities and into the foodstuffs of the people. Often the foodstuffs are personified as well as sacred. " 'My granduncle used to say to me,' explained a Navajo Indian, "'if you are walking along a trail and see a kernel of corn, pick it up. It is like a child lost and starving." According to the legends corn is just the same as a human being, only it is holier . When a man goes into a corn- field he feels that he is in a holy place, that he is walking among Holy People..... Agriculture is a holy occupation. Even be- fore you plant you sing songs. You continue this during the whole time your crops are growing. You cannot help but feel that you are in a holy place when you go through your fields and they are doing well.' "37 In the folk society, ideally conceived, nothing is solely a means to an immediate practical end. All activities, even the means of pro- duction, are ends in themselves, activities expressive of the ultimate values of the society. III This characterization of the ideal folk society could be greatly extended. Various of the elements that make up the conception could be differently combined with one an- other, and this point or that could be devel- oped or further emphasized and its relations shown to other aspects of the conception. For example, it might be pointed out that where there is little or no systematic and reflective thinking the customary solutions to problems of practical action only imper- fectly take the form of really effective and understood control of the means appropri- ate to accomplish the desired end, and that, instead, they tend to express the states of mind of the individuals who want the end brought about and fear that it may not be. We say this briefly in declaring that the folk society is characterized by much magic, for we may understand "magic" to refer to ac- tion with regard to an end-to instrumental action-but only to such instrumental ac- tion as does not effectively bring about that end, or is not really understood in so far as it does, and which is expressive of the way the doer thinks and feels rather than adapted to accomplishing the end. "Magic is based on specific experience of emotional states.... 34 Imile Durkheim, The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life (London: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1926). 35 Underhill, op. cit., p. i8. 36 Benjamin Paul, unpublished MS. 37 W.

What is done tends to take the form of a little drama; it is a picture of what is desired. The nature of the folk society could, in- deed, be restated in the form of a description of the folk mind. This description would be largely a repetition of what has been writ- ten in foregoing pages, except that now the emphasis would be upon the characteristic mental activity of members of the folk so- ciety, rather than upon customs and institu- tions. The man of the folk society tends to make mental associations which are per- sonal and emotional, rather than abstractly categoric or defined in terms of cause and effect. ...... Primitive man views every action not only as adapted to its main ob- ject, every thought related to its main end, as we should perceive them, but .... he as- sociates them with other ideas, often of a religious or at least a symbolic nature. Thus he gives to them a higher significance than they seem to us to deserve."39 A very similar statement of this kind of thinking has been expressed in connection with the thinking of medieval man; the description would apply as well to man in the folk society: From the causal point of view, symbolism appears as a sort of short-cut of thought. Instead of looking for the relation between two things by following the hidden detours of their causal connections, thought makes a leap and discovers their relation, not in a connection of cause or effects, but in a connection of significa- tion or finality. Such a connection will at once appear convincing, provided only that the two things have an essential quality in common which can be referred to a general value..... Symbolic assimilation founded on common properties presupposes the idea that these prop- erties are essential to things. The vision of white and red roses blooming among thorns at once calls up a symbolic association in the medieval mind: for example, that of virgins and martyrs, shining with glory, in the midst of their perse- cutors. The assimilation is produced because the attributes are the same: the beauty, the tenderness, the purity, the colours of the roses are also those of the virgins, their red color that of the blood of the martyrs. But this similarity will only have a mystic meaning if the middle-term connecting the two terms of the symbolic concept expresses an essentiality common to both; in other words, if redness and whiteness are something more than names for physical differences based on quantity, if they are conceived of as essences, as realities. The mind of the savage, of the child, and of the poet never sees them otherwise.40 The tendency to treat nature personally has recognition in the literature as the "animistic" or "anthropomorphic" quality of primitive thinking, and the contrast be- tween the means-ends pattern of thought more characteristic of modern urban man and the personal thought of primitive man has been specially investigated.41 In the foregoing account no mention has been made of the absence of economic be- havior characteristic of the market in the folk society. Within the ideal folk society members are bound by religious and kinship ties, and there is no place for the motive of commercial gain. There is no money and nothing is measured by any such common denominator of value. The distribution of goods and services tends to be an aspect of the conventional and personal relationships of status which make up the structure of the society: goods are exchanged as expressions of good will and, in large part, as incidents of ceremonial and ritual activities.

"42 The conception sketched here takes on meaning if the folk society is seen in con- trast to the modern city. The vast, compli- cated, and rapidly changing world in which the urbanite and even the urbanized coun- try-dweller live today is enormously differ- ent from the small, inward-facing folk so- ciety, with its well-integrated and little- changing moral and religious conceptions. At one time all men lived in these little folk societies. For many thousands of years men must have lived so; urbanized life be- gan only very recently, as the long history of man on earth is considered, and the ex- treme development of a secularized and swift-changing world society is only a few generations old. The tribal groups that still remain around the edges of expanding civilization are the small remainders of this primary state of liv- ing. Considering them one by one, and in comparison with the literate or semiliterate societies, the industrialized and the semi- industrialized societies, we may discover how each has developed forms of social life in accordance with its own special circum- stances. Among the polar Eskimos, where each small family had to shift for itself in the rigors of the arctic environment, although the ties of kinship were of great importance, no clans or other large unilateral kinship groups came into existence. The sedentary Haida of the Queen Charlotte Islands were divided into two exogamous kinship groups, each composed of clans, with intense pride of decent and healthy rivalry between them. Among the warring and nomadic Comanche initiative and resourcefulness of the individ- ual were looked on more favorably than among the sedentary and closely inter- dependent Zuni. In West Africa great native states arose, with chiefs and courts and markets, yet the kinship organization re- mained strong; and in China we have an example of slow growth of a great society, with a literate elite, inclosing within it a multitude of village communities of the folk type. Where cities have arisen, the country people dependent on those cities have devel- oped economic and political relationships, as well as relationships of status, with the city people, and so have become that special kind of rural folk we call peasantry.43 And even in the newer parts of the world, as in the United States, many a village or small town has, perhaps, as many points of re- semblance with the folk society as with urban life. Thus the societies of the world do not range themselves in the same order with regard to the degree to which they realize all of the characteristics of the ideal folk so- ciety. On the other hand, there is so marked a tendency for some of these characteristics to occur together with others that the inter- relations among them must be in no small part that of interdependent variables. In- deed, some of the interrelations are so obvious that we feel no sense of problem. The smallness of the folk society and the long association together of the same indi- viduals certainly is related to the prevailing- ly personal character of relationships. The fewness of secondary and tertiary tools and the absence of machine manufacture are cir- cumstances obviously unfavorable to a very complex division of labor. Many problems present themselves, however, as to the con- ditions in which certain of these char- acteristics do not occur in association, and as to the circumstances under which certain of them may be expected to change in the direction of their opposites, with or without influencing others to change also. A study of the local differences in the festival of the patron village saint in certain communities of Yucatan indicates that some interrelationship exists in that case.44 In all four communities, differing as to their de- 42 Raymond Firth, Primitive Economics of the New Zealand Maori (New York: E.

In it a ritual and worship are com- bined with a considerable amount of play. The chief activities of the festival are a novena, a folk dance, and a rustic bullfight. In all four communities there is an organiza- tion of men and women who for that year undertake the leadership of the festival, handing over the responsibility to a cor- responding group of successors at its cul- mination. So far the institution is the same in all the communities studied. The differ- ences appear when the details of the ritual and play and of the festal organization are compared, and when the essential meanings of these acts and organizations are inquired into. Then it appears that from being an in- tensely sacred act, made by the village as a collectivity composed of familially defined component groups, with close relationship to the system of religious and moral under- standings of the people, the festival be- comes, in the more urbanized communities, chiefly an opportunity for recreation for some and of financial profit for others, with little reference to moral and religious conceptions. In the most isolated and otherwise most folklike of the communitieslstudied the or- ganization of the festival is closely in- tegrated with the whole social structure of the community. The hierarchy of leaders of the community, whose duties are both civil and religious, carry on the festival: It is the chiefs, the men who decide disputes and lead in warfare, who also take principal places in the religious processions and in the conduct of the ceremonies. The community, including several neighboring settlements, is divided into five groups, membership in which descends in the male line. The re- sponsibility for leading the prayers and pre- paring the festal foods rests in turn on four men chosen from each of the five groups. The festival is held at the head village, at the shrine housing the cross patron of the entire community. The festival consists chiefly of solemnly religious acts: masses, rosaries, procession of images, kneeling of wor- shipers. The ritual offerings are presented by a special officer, in all solemnity, to the pa- tron cross; certain symbols of divinity are brought from the temple and exposed to the kneeling people as the offerings are made. The transfer of the responsibility to lead the festival is attended by ceremony in an at- mosphere of sanctity: certain ritual para- phernalia are first placed on the altar and then, after recitation of prayers and per- formance of a religious dance, are handed over, in view of all, from the custodians of the sacred charge for that year to their suc- cessors. In the villages that are less isolated the festival is similar in form, but it is less well integrated with the social organization of the community, is less sacred, and allows for more individual enterprise and responsibil- ity. These changes continue in the other communities studied, as one gets nearer to the city of Merida. In certain seacoast vil- lages the festival of the patron saint is a money-getting enterprise of a few secular- minded townspeople. The novena is in the hands of a few women who receive no help from the municipal authorities; the bullfight is a commercial entertainment, professional bullfighters being hired for the occasion and admission charged; the folk dance is little attended. The festival is enjoyed by young people who come to dance modern dances and to witness the bullfight, and it is an op- portunity to the merchants to make a profit. What was an institution of folk culture has become a business enterprise in which indi- viduals, as such, take part for secular ends. The principal conclusion is that the less isolated and more heterogeneous communi- ties of the peninsula of Yucatan are the more secular and individualistic and the more characterized by disorganization of culture. It further appeared probable that there was, in the changes taking place in Yucatan, a relation of interdependence among these changing characteristics, espe- cially between the disorganization of culture and secularization. "People cease to believe because they cease to understand, and they cease to understand because they cease to do the things that express the understand-</page><page sequence="16">308 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY ings."45 New jobs and other changes in the division of labor bring it about that people cannot participate in the old rituals; and, ceasing to participate, they cease to share the values for which the rituals stood. This is, admittedly, however, only a part of the explanation. The conception of the folk society has stimulated one small group of field workers to consider the interdependence or inde- pendence of these characteristics of society. In Yucatan isolation, homogeneity, a per- sonal and "symbolic" view of nature, im- portance of familial relationships, a high degree of organization of culture, and sa- credness of sanctions and institutions were all found in regular association with each other. It was then reported that in certain Indian communities on or near Lake Atitlan in Guatamala this association of characteris- tics is not repeated.46 As it appeared that these Guatemalan communities were not in rapid change, but were persisting in their essential nature, the conclusion was reached that "a stable society can be small, un- sophisticated, homogeneous in beliefs and practices," have a local, well-organized cul- ture, and still be one "with relationships impersonal, with formal institutions dictat- ing the acts of individuals, and with family organization weak, with life secularized, and with individuals acting more from economic or other personal advantage than from any deep conviction or thought of the social good." It was further pointed out that in these Guatemalan societies a "primitive world view," that is, a disposition to treat nature personally, to regard attributes as entities, and to make "symbolic" rather than causal connections, coexists with a tendency for relations between man and man to be impersonal, commercial, and secular, as they tend to be in the urban society.47 These observations lead, in turn, to re- consideration of the circumstances tending to bring about one kind of society or one aspect of society rather than another. The breakdown of familial institutions in recent times in Western society is often ascribed to the development of the city and of modern industry. If, as has been reported, familial institutions are also weak in these Guate- malan villages, there must be alternative causes for the breakdown of the family to the rise of industry and the growth of the city, for these Guatemalan Indians live on or near their farms, practice a domestic handi- craft manufacture, and have little or noth- ing to do with cities. It has been suggested that in the case of the Guatemalan societies the development, partly before the Con- quest and partly afterward, of a pecuniary economy with a peddler's commerce, based on great regional division of labor, together with a system of regulations imposed by an elite with the use of force, may be the cir- cumstances that have brought about reduc- tion in the importance of familial institu- tions and individual independence, espe- cially in matters of livelihood.48 The secular character of life in these high- land villages of the Lake Atitlan region is not so well established as in the individuated character of life, but if life is indeed secular there, it is a secularity that has developed without the influence of high personal mo- bility, of the machine, and of science. In a well-known essay Max Weber showed how capitalistic commercialism could and did get along with piety in the case of the Puri- tans.49 So it may appear that under certain conditions a literate and, indeed, at least partly urbanized society may be both highly commercial and sacred-as witness, also, the Jews-while under certain other conditions an otherwise folklike people may become individualistic, commercial, and perhaps secular. It is, of course, the determination of the limiting conditions that is important.
