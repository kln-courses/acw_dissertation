In the past twenty years Daniel Biebuyck has clearly established himself as a lead- ing interpreter of eastern Congolese cultures. Beginning with his articles of the early fifties, he has gradually revealed the many dimensions of the societies of this region of Black Africa. His recent book, Lega Culture: Art, Initiation, and Moral Philosophy among a Central A/rican People, is his most complete statement; an important synthesis of data and interpretations based upon his ex- tensive field experience in Lega country. For those who have looked forward to this book on the Lega, this work is a rich reward, for it is a veritable harvest of facts and ideas. Carefully prepared and written, and amply supported by both field and museum photographs, it stands in many respects as a model study of the interactions between art and society within the African context. helping others to coill ecleclturingm~ Afrl~  ican lart.!Dur ingtisIperiod, II lhave been acivly ~invlved in bui ildl~ing a colcions.!IliliH lla IO have nolw deidedto offerl i i I ill. be ilad to i scu ss an ilik of c!lients.i 106i W. 69th St, New York~i, iN.i.10023 Biebuyck introduces the reader gently to the complex world of the Lega, shar- ing with him in the preface to the book those factors which originally led to the selection of this area for research in late 1951. His decision to work in Legaland, based on his earlier studies among the Bembe, was motivated primarily by a strong desire to study the Bwami associ- ation, a task of formidable proportions given the decidedly negative official Belgian posture (throughout much of the colonial period) vis-a-vis this crucial organization. He not only candidly de- scribes the Belgian viewpoint on the Lega and Bwami, but the understandably de- fensive attitudes of the Lega themselves to outsiders attempting to perceive and understand their association and culture. His odds against succeeding were con- siderable, and yet patience, almost three years of concentrated study, and a com- mitment to involve himself fully in Lega culture and Bwami enabled him to pene- trate this very difficult research climate. By describing his initial encounter with the Lega, relating how he attempted to establish his credibility in various Lega communities and by giving quite literally his timetable for research, Biebuyck en- ables the reader to further grasp the vari- ous problems that confronted him in the field. This particular aspect of the preface is a very welcome addition: personal de- tails which ultimately give the reader some insight into the method by which an author has achieved his objectives are all too often omitted. The results of Lega Culture are principally a distilla- tion of Biebuyck's work in the south- western sector of Legaland, in Pangi territory and the administrative units of Beia, Babene and Bakabango, where Bwami traditions were ".. . most strongly developed and the best preserved." Bie- buyck asserts that while his arguments and ideas on Bwami and art are based upon his experience in the Pangi region, they are applicable to Lega culture as a whole. He acknowledges that there are regional differences, and that individual Lega groups have the desire to fashion their Bwami association into unique ritual communities, but he stresses that the structural principles and the basic operations of Bwami are essentially the same. Although describing events and insti- tutions as he observed them between 1951 and 1954, Biebuyck writes in the ethnographic present which enables him to convey his narrative with a crispness and precision of style that belies the mass of data presented in this volume. In solid anthropological fashion he carries the reader into Lega country and establishes with ease, as well as with considerable documentary and first hand evidence, the various components and limits of Lega culture.

Useful demographic and environmental data are also supplied. Although by far the shortest portion of the book (and quite rightfully so) this chapter successfully describes the Lega within the wider framework of eastern Congolese cultures straddling the western shores of Lakes Kivu and Tanganyika. It can be legiti- mately said that in addition to its contri- bution to this volume, Part One should serve as a useful guide for future re- searchers in this area be they anthro- pologists, historians or those interested in the arts. In Part Two Biebuyck attempts to es- tablish and elucidate the many compo- nents of Lega culture by focusing upon such diverse elements as the economy and technology, the social organization, the arts, the values and the religion of the Lega. It is regrettable that this data is so compressed that it becomes com- parable, in presentation, to a typically conceived ethnographic index. Fortu- nately the descriptions of the attitudes of foreigners towards the Lega and Bwami, as exemplified by official Belgian policy statements and government circulars and the comments of missionaries and edu- cators, are a highly fascinating append- age to this section and thus serve as a welcome relief to the chapter as a whole. It is plain, however, that Biebuyck is not offering this section as a skeleton outline of Lega culture for the mere sake of exposition, for the chapter does serve as a necessary prelude to the main thrust of the book-a very full and accom- plished treatment of the Bwami associa- tion and its many art forms. Parts Three and Four are the raison d'Atre and high points of the book. In Part Three Biebuyck gives us a highly detailed discussion of the Bwami associ- ation. It is in this section that the true breadth and depth of his research is fully displayed, and the chapter represents a 82</page><page sequence="2">true challenge to the reader. Bwami itself is such an important and multifaceted organization that only such a broadly based coverage would do justice to it. The task of describing Bwami can be most easily understood by referring to Biebuyck's initial description of the society: "Bwami is many things in one. It has the structure and some of the functions of a voluntary association, but it also maintains and reinforces kinship, lineage, and clan bonds. Access to and advance- ment in Bwami are conditioned by a number of factors: character, kinship support, wealth, initiation. The initia- tions aim at moral perfection, the princi- ples of which are elaborately explained in proverbs, dances, and objects. Bwami is therefore a moral philosophy. It is also an arts club, for it enjoys and patronizes the fine arts. It is a school of art because it creates, produces, uses and explains thousands of pieces of sculpture. Bwami has developed its own literary arts, its dances and musical styles, dramatic per- formances, choreographies, and archi- tectural styles." Having given the reader an idea of the scope of Bwami, Biebuyck proceeds in structural-functional terms to dissect the many elements which combine to com- pose the association. The varieties of Bwami, and the numerous grades, levels, and ritual cycles of the organization are clearly presented. The origin and distri- bution of Bwami are also noted, and this is a particularly interesting segment of the chapter in that it provides a glimpse into the means by which an African culture retains its memory of key his- torical and social phenomena. How one obtains membership and the structural and organizational principles within Bwami are also discussed. Unlike most authors, Biebuyck treats in minute detail the methods of circulation and accumula- tion of the material goods that are so necessary a part of the socio-economic structure of any African "voluntary" association. By using two specific ex- amples of how the accumulation and distribution of goods is achieved (the Lutumbo lwa kindi and the Lutumbo lwa yananio grades), the whole Lega pattern is clearly established. Biebuyck goes further than simply pro- viding a structural-functional descrip- tion, for he delves into the philosophical bases of Bwami and the ideologies sur- rounding it. He feels that Bwami is a paradigm of Lega culture and is the vehicle for complete acculturation to Lega society: it is through initiation into Bwami, and through the gradual move- ment through the grades of Bwami, that the basic values, moral precepts, and principles of Lega culture are taught and perpetuated. "Bwami is a paideia, a system of in- struction in a unique moral philosophy and social ethic; it is not merely a re- ligion, but a mystery; it is an academy whose members practice and honor the fine arts. Its functions encompass all these fields." The final section of the book deals with the incredible range of art forms associated with Bwami. Within this array of items Biebuyck carefully separates natural objects (those from the vegeta- ble, animal and mineral worlds) from manufactured goods (basketry, bark, pottery and metal articles) and art work (masks and maskettes, anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figurines, stools, spoons, and a variety of tools). I do not person- ally agree with the author's strict separa- tion of manufactured goods and art work, for by doing this he perpetuates the myth of weaving and pottery traditions as "non-art." I would have hoped that at this point in time sculpture and "embellish- ment" had ceased to be the sole deter- minants of "art." Nonetheless, having described the various objects used within Bwami, Biebuyck goes on to deal with the many levels of meaning that these items possess and convey, by noting the many proverbs and aphorisms associated with them. It is in this particular section that Biebuyck contributes enormously to the study of art in Africa. The interac- tions between art, oral literature, dance and ideas are vital in Lega culture, but, more important, they are vital in Africa as a whole. Biebuyck gives data on the use and function of the vast array of art forms, and elucidates the ownership and trans- fer patterns of these objects within Bwami. The meanings, configurations, and contexts of masks, figurine types, spoons, and stools are carefully listed. A most important contribution is the dis- cussion of how the Lega classify the wealth of items used within their initia- tion system. In this section the author discusses the failure of other researchers in Africa to use local taxonomies to classify items and points out the prob- lems inherent in imposing outside tax- onomies where local ones exist. The Lega classification is amply described and re- veals how very unified the system is with respect to the wide range of items used by Bwami. Lega Culture is an in-depth study of the Lega, Bwami, and art. Because of its general thoroughness, and thought- fulness, one finds that his expectations, as a reader, are heightened. Given such a high degree of expectation, I find two gaps in the work which I consider serious enough to note here. Biebuyck mentions the general repressive atmosphere in the KARL FERDINAND SCHADLER African Art In Private German Collections A new book on hitherto unpublished treas- ures of African Art. 370 pages, over 500 illus- trations, 30 color plates. $58.00.

The aim of the book was to present Bwami within the ethno- graphic present and therefore one gets no clear idea of the responses and accom- modations that the society and the culture had to make to the many pres- sures brought to bear upon them. Infor- mation of this type would have added a dynamic dimension to Biebuyck's otherwise sound treatment of the subject. Perhaps more serious, in an "art in context" study such as this, is the lack of a complete or comprehensive discus- sion of the artist. Biebuyck stresses that by the early 1950s, due to the harrass- ment of colonial officials, etc., there were very few artists working in Lega country. Yet he does state that people had strong memories of the great Lega artists and that in fact a few Lega carvers were still working in the traditional manner. He assumes that, given the consensual nature of Lega society, the position of the artist within the culture was never very im- portant and that famous artists who were spoken of were remembered because of their importance within Bwami. Even given the truth of these assumptions, the artist is an identifiable entity and most likely does occupy a position of impor- tance. Had an individual artist (living or dead) been identified with a corpus of his work, this would have lent a dimen- sion of recognition to a body of anony- mous art forms. It also, and not inciden- tally, would have allowed for a stylistic study of individual and village group productions. These omissions notwithstanding, Lega Culture is a very major contribution to the study of an African society and its art. The work is the end product of ex- emplary field research and thoughtful and creative consideration of data: it is an impressive and worthwhile achieve- ment. Rend A.
