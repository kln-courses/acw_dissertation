      <p>What an impossible task, doomed to failure! How could any piece of instrumental music, as an immaterial collection of sound waves wafting on air, hope to evoke the concrete characteristics of specific material objects? By what means could Olivier Messiaen have imagined that his <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic> (<italic>Livre du Saint Sacrement</italic>), a concert suite for organ in eighteen movements composed in 1984, would in any meaningful way represent the bread and wine of the Eucharist at the heart of the Catholic liturgy, which, according to doctrine, really transmogrifies into Christ’s body and blood?1 The struggle to manifest such a thing as the sacrament in music would seem hopelessly futile. Fittingly, movement 1, “Adoro te” (I Adore You) strives ceaselessly without ever reaching conclusion. A set of slow chords modulates one into the other in long phrases that would each seem destined to arrive at a compelling cadence, yet none of them ever do.2 Throughout, the lower parts of complex chords are frequently sustained while one or two of the upper notes shift by a half or whole tone, as if the organist’s fingers were searching for harmonic resolutions that surely must be near but never can be found. “Adoro te” can endeavor but cannot succeed, above all, in having its chordal meanderings remain clearly germane to the sacrament of the Eucharist named in the title.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, if anyone were to venture such a musically and theologically ambitious undertaking, Olivier Messiaen (1908–92) would seem the composer most up to the task. Lifelong a devout Catholic, he had dedicated many of his compositions over the previous half century to explicitly Christian themes. He had served as titular organist at the Church of La Trinité in Paris since 1931, where his access to the grand instrument constructed by the master organ builder Aristide Cavaillé‐Coll (1811–99) positioned him to extend the legacy of French symphonic organ composition pioneered by the likes of César Franck (1822–90), Camille Saint‐Saëns (1835–1921), and Gabriel Fauré (1845–1924). Messiaen had enjoyed impeccable musical training at the Paris Conservatoire, studying organ with Marcel Dupré (1886–1971), music history with Maurice Emmanuel (1862–1938), and composition with Paul Dukas (1865–1935). Yet Messiaen could also be ranked among the leading European composers of musical modernism—which might briefly be characterized by its irregular rhythms and meters, its frequent atonalities, and its rejection of conventional larger structuring principles such as the sonata form. Fascinated by the innovations of Claude Debussy (1862–1918) and Igor Stravinsky (1882–1971), he invented a set of musical modes (roughly, scales) that, while not serialist in the manner of the twelve‐tone rows introduced by Arnold Schoenberg (1874–1951), shared serialism’s mathematical precision and disregard for diatonic verities. He incorporated into a number of his works complex Greek and Hindu rhythms and Indonesian gamelan harmonies and also experimented with the <italic>ondes Martenot</italic>, an early electronic instrument. Among his students, whom he taught both as the professor of harmony at the Paris Conservatoire and independently, he could count such leaders of modernism as Pierre Boulez (1925–) and Karlheinz Stockhausen (1928–2007). By 1984, in short, Messiaen stood as one of the musical giants of the twentieth century, commanding enormous respect and able to marshal a remarkable array of musical techniques to the challenging theological task he had taken on in <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic>.</p>
      <p>Although it was originally commissioned by the American Guild of Organists for a premiere at their national convention in Detroit in 1986 and is most often played in a concert setting (even when performed within a church for the sake of access to a quality instrument), <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic>, owing to its theme of the Eucharist, cannot help but evoke the Christian liturgy—and undoubtedly its shorter movements have been incorporated into many a church service as Communion meditation or postlude to the Mass. In some obvious sense, the organ suite was meant to give rise to some of the same spiritual sentiments that are prompted by an encounter with the host and chalice while kneeling at the rail. Music has long held a central function in Christian rite, striving both to represent the divine and to induce or deepen worship.3 Because <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic> takes as its subject the means of the sacrament rather than its numinous ends, however, the piece distances itself from the Catholic Mass even as it approaches it. In the visual arts, depictions of the Eucharist are as scarce as portrayals of Jesus are overwhelmingly plentiful; likewise, musical references to the Eucharist, as opposed to the divinity ostensibly embodied by the bread and wine, crop up in only a handful of hymns and other pieces of service music. For this reason, Messiaen with his <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic> steps outside the church as much as he bows down within it.</p>
      <p>Because of this distance rather than in spite of it, <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic> may well have found an appropriate match between medium and theme, an approach to the sacrament well served by its own impossible strivings to represent it. For if the music of <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic> does not resemble the Eucharist, the Eucharist in turn does not resemble the divine Christ.4 With each new consecration, that sacrament is meant to render present the “underlying substance,” or imperceptible essence, of Jesus, even as the “species” of bread and wine, their accidental characteristics that give themselves to the senses, remain unremarkable and unchanged.5 “What is there upon the altar before the consecration? A little bread, a little wine.” Thus catechized Abbot Dom Columba Marmion, a theologian of such importance to Messiaen that the composer both extolled the cleric in the written preface to the score of <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic> and used one of his sayings as an epigraph to movement 6, titled “The Manna and the Bread of Life.” Marmion continued in his book <italic>Christ in His Mysteries</italic> (a volume cherished by Messiaen): “And after the consecration? For the senses, still bread and wine. Faith alone penetrates beneath these veils, even to the Divine Reality therein totally hidden. Without faith, we shall never see anything but bread and wine; we do not see God.”6</p>
      <p>The Eucharist thus constitutes a paradigm of presence that stands as an alternative to modes of representation based on resemblance. It predates the high value placed on likeness that characterizes much of Western representational practice, above all in visual images, since the fifteenth century. That dominant system, reigning at least since the invention of linear perspective, posits a resemblance between picture and world, a resemblance that may affirm the presence of images but thereby also absents the things they depict. The Eucharist, in contrast, sacrifices resemblance for the sake of making present the thing. Despite the occasional gesture toward likeness—birdsong, folk tunes, and such—music does not frequently resort to resemblance of this sort. It also would seem to have a capacity for making things present: a certain note played on the organ really is that sound, not a representation of it. Thus, music may offer an excellent medium to forge an alternative to visual resemblance. Paradoxically, Messiaen allows for more aural similitude than do many composers, above all in his inclusion of transcribed birdsong in <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic> (and other earlier pieces). Nevertheless, as we will see, his manner of doing so frequently reveals the limitations as much as the prowess of such acoustic mimicry. Perhaps in Messiaen’s organ suite the irreconcilable differences that separate music from sacrament might serve to evoke the ineluctable distance Marmion describes between mundane sacrament and divine God.</p>
      <p>Such an evocation, however, could hardly be a simple matter of having one relation of dissimilitude brought to resemble another. Because the link between Eucharist and God is necessarily shrouded in mystery, human thought lacks the capacity to assess fully the nature of that connection and hence the nature of any relation to that relation. If <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic> is to engage the Eucharist, it must do so in the same elusive manner (from a human perspective) by which the sacrament in the priest’s hands might be seen to approach the divine. It is not a matter of confident matching, then, but of tentative and partial explorations, working out from the obscurity of the human condition.</p>
      <p>A passing comment by Marmion provides a sketch, not of a method for our investigation, but of the sort of field in which such probing can occur: “If in each of Christ’s mysteries, there is enough shadow to render our faith meritorious, there is also enough light to help our faith” (343). By way of example, the bread and wine of the Eucharist generate such “help[ing] light” in the form of their material likeness to the body and blood of Jesus in his human aspect. While Catholic doctrine might dismiss the theological significance of that resemblance (the Council of Trent belabored the point in 1551 by maintaining that body and blood are equally, not respectively, present in both bread and wine), there can be no question that worshippers during the Catholic Mass are openly invited to dwell on the similarity when the priest first elevates the solid wafer while repeating Jesus’s words “This is my body which will be given up for you,” and then holds up the chalice of liquid while intoning “This is the cup of my blood.”7 That likeness, while hardly obviating the need for faith as the only true manner for discerning the presence of the divine in mundane comestibles, at least aids in giving faith a trajectory by training faith in the direction of Christ. In a parallel manner, we can seek out the interplays in <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic> between “lights” that point toward the Eucharist and “shadows” that confirm the impossibility of music ever capturing that sacrament’s miraculous amalgam of the divine and the mundane. The ineffable dynamic internal to the sacrament will suggest an appropriate manner of musical interpretation. And reciprocally, the incommensurability between musical expression and sacrament might serve (better than any posited commensurability, surely) to reveal something about the nature of the relation between Eucharist and the divine Christ. <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic> provides a perfect case study of representation (if it can still be called that) not based on resemblance, in pursuit of an object that cannot be fully grasped by the senses.</p>
      <p>We commence with Messiaen’s own words, the copious textual supplements that he attached to <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic>. Because the suite was conceived for concert performance, most of these would have been provided to auditors by way of a written program: the all‐important title of the piece, the subtitles given to individual movements, and the one or more epigraphs assigned to each movement. Those consulting the score would also encounter an explanatory “Introduction” running some 1,500 words (reprinted in some CD booklets), as well as the various verbal interpolations placed within the musical score itself. With the power of the speech‐act vested in the work’s creator, Messiaen’s explicit words make the musical suite about the Eucharist, in a manner similar to the way in which Jesus’s statements “This is my body. … This is my blood” make the Eucharist just those things (Matt. 26:26, 28; Mark 14:22, 24). Had Messiaen released the work with no such textual labeling, the music alone would certainly have lacked clues sufficient to evoke the sacrament in any auditor’s mind. In the simplest sense, <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic> is about the Eucharist because Messiaen’s words say that it is. Nonetheless, as mere adjuncts to the auditory experience of the piece (“paratexts,” to use Gérard Genette’s useful term for words such as titles and prefaces that accompany a principal artifact without being fully part of it), the composer’s written additions also remove themselves from the acoustic field where theological work will be done by actual musical sound.8 When the words designate the organ suite as being about the Eucharist, they also necessarily mark themselves as being about the music (they name what it will be) rather than about the sacrament itself. Each movement’s title and epigraphs function chiefly as signposts meant to aid auditors as they ponder the music’s striving toward ineffable entities.</p>
      <p>The textual supplements describe a basic division of the movements into three large groups, a differentiation reinforced by the musical forms that Messiaen tends to use in each. The first four movements, as Messiaen explains in the introduction to the score, “are acts of adoration before Christ, invisible but truly present in the Blessed Sacrament.”9 The next seven movements, the introduction continues, “describe each Mystery of Christ in chronological order” (1), with the title or epigraph of the movements, or in a couple of cases the explanation provided in the introduction, linking them to specific episodes in Jesus’s life and death. With the final seven movements, Messiaen explains, “we are in [Christ’s] current Church, to pray to him in the Blessed Sacrament” (2), and the movements recapitulate the modern worshipper’s passage through the experience of the Mass. The three sections play two broad attitudes toward time and movement against each other. Whereas the first section suspends thematic and musical progress to enter into stasis, the second allows for compositional development and for the telling of tales.10 The third section combines elements of both, but never in a synthetic manner that would entail any real advance in human understanding of the Eucharist. That would belie the divine immutability and inscrutability of the sacrament, a sense of which the organ suite always wants to preserve.</p>
      <p>Thematically, movements of the first section maintain distance from the Eucharist in part by addressing (or having their paratexts have them address) the devout attitudes that worshippers properly hold toward the sacrament, rather than concerning themselves with the sacrament itself. Human minds, not divine substances, are at issue here. We have already encountered in movement 1 the seeking without settling pursued by the implied first‐person subject of the Latin title “Adoro te”; the epigraph, a translation of Saint Thomas of Aquinas into French (and here into English), gives the elided grammatical subject as well as affirms the absence of its venerated object: “I adore you, O hidden divinity!” (6). Like movement 1, the short movements 2 and 4, titled “The Fountain of Life” and “Act of Faith,” both maintain their own stylistic consistency that eschews musical development. The second relies on crisp timbres, produced by a combination of the quintaton 16<sup>

         </sup> stops for the melodic line, to evoke the luminosity named in the epigraph from Saint Bonaventure: “That always my heart thirsts for you, O fountain of life, source of eternal light!” (10). Nevertheless, rather than having auditors rise to the purity of that divine illumination, the atonal melody (it begins with a tritone, the span of three whole steps known as “the devil’s interval,” owing to its marked dissonance) and the slowly modulating, dissonant chords that underlie the melody without harmonizing with it keep listeners firmly in the realm of unquenched human thirst. (The chords also recall the searching tone clusters without resolution in “Adoro te.”) Movement 4, vivacious and loud, at times unsubtle and melodramatic in the manner of a theater organ, feels like a heartfelt but somewhat bombastic affirmation of merely mortal belief.</p>
      <p>Of the first four, the internal structure of the longer movement 3 best exemplifies the static nature of collected states without progression that characterizes the first section of the organ suite. Its title, “The Hidden God,” designates it as the movement within that first group most directly about the deity, although the adjective “hidden” (from whom?) and the two epigraphs return attention to the worshipper. One of the sentences quoted from the fifteenth‐century monk and mystic Thomas à Kempis serves well as a précis of the epigraphs: “In consideration for my weakness you hide behind the veils of the Sacrament” (14). In this movement, rather than a single musical mood, Messiaen presents four. The movement commences using a combination that includes the reed hautbois 8<sup>

         </sup> stop, this segment would seem to assert itself as something of a modernist rejoinder to the ancient chant, in a style that also recalls the melody in movement 2. Then there is another pause, followed by a staple of Messiaen’s compositional practice (used, in fact, in eight of the eighteen movements): a transcription of birdsong. The composer, renowned as a skilled ornithologist who had been writing down avian melodies from across France and the world since the 1920s, inserts into the score a quasi‐scientific notation identifying species and locale of collection: “Tristram’s grackle (Ein Gedi, between Masada and the Dead Sea)” (15); then another pause. Quiet chords move forward with stately calm; they are the least discordant in the piece so far, and, despite the occasional tritone, even conclude on a pleasant chord. After another pause, the four segments repeat in order, each somewhat longer but none elaborated in a manner sufficiently different in mood from its first rendition to qualify as musical development. Then, another bird; this time an “olivaceous warbler (Lod, near Tel Aviv)” (19). Finally, a short descending line of chords—a mere five shifts in the right hand while the left hand and pedal hold a constant cluster of notes—landing on a euphonious major chord.11</p>
      <p>This is strictly sequential organization (serial, in the rhetorical rather than musical meaning of the word): one thing after another. Despite the obvious potential for the playing of oppositional terms against each other—nature versus culture, modern versus ancient, melody versus harmony, and so forth—the antitheses never give rise to sustained musical argument. Modernist monody may counter Gregorian plainchant, for instance, but plainchant offers no riposte when it returns essentially unchanged. The contrast between monody in the first three segments and the chords in the fourth segment (the chords reminiscent of movement 1 and prefiguring movement 4) abjures the possibility of melody and harmony working together, as they might normally do for the sake of musical development. Even the concluding descending line of tone clusters to the final pure major chord is so stylistically differentiated and detached from the other segments that, rather than serving as their resolution, it stands as a foil against which the preceding segments appear as unmoving. To hear the first nine of the ten segments that make up movement 3 is to contemplate discrete and autonomous musical ideas, like so many disparate prayer beads strung by chance on a single strand.</p>
      <p>We have heard the grackle twice and the warbler once.12 If most of the first section of <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic> remains as humanly close as the emotions in a worshipper’s mind, the birds transport us away from ourselves. The notations of the locations attest to the composer’s voyage to the Holy Land in 1984, where he experienced the same sounds of nature that Jesus might have heard in biblical times. Messiaen aspired to scientific objectivity in his recording of such avian melodies: in addition to his listing of species and locality among the staves, the prefatory pages of the score include a systematic table listing the “names of bird songs utilized in this work, given in Latin (scientific name), French, English, and German” (4). While the precise transcription of birdsong onto staff paper may perhaps have constituted the best practical means to record such sound when the composer began collecting in the 1920s, by the 1980s, among professional ornithologists, electronic recording had certainly superseded any such manual techniques. Messiaen’s gestures toward scientific method in <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic> thus serve less to ensure fidelity than to represent it as the basis for the inclusion of avian sounds in the piece. These inhuman melodies manifest themselves as coming from someplace other than the imagination of the composer, who in these segments assumes instead the role of faithful scribe—with, to be sure, virtuosic ear‐training skills. Scientific objectivity (or at least its representation) would seem to protect this segment of the movement from the human act of musical interpretation.</p>
      <p>Held apart from the worshipper’s mental state by these various means—at a distance in place and in time, outside of culture as an inhuman source—birdsong offers to the auditor a hint of otherworldliness. Nature has long served the arts as a convenient figure for the divine, and Messiaen clearly aligns himself with that Romantic heritage. Later in the third section of <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic> for movement 15 devoted to the arrival from afar of “The Joy of Grace” in the form of the real body and blood of Christ now miraculously present in the Eucharist, Messiaen relies exclusively on the musically irregular vocalizations of three birds from the Near East, the garden bulbul, Tristram’s grackle (both noted in “Ein Gedi, Judea”; 119), and the white‐throated robin (location not mentioned in the body of the score but described in the introduction as a “bird of Iran and northern Palestine”; 2). This is the liturgical if not the dramatic or theological high point of the piece, situated between comparatively tonal, euphonious movements entitled “Prayer before Communion” and “Prayer after Communion.” Organist Susan Landale has written about movement 15: “Messiaen entrusts to [birdsong] the task of ‘expressing the inexpressible’; it is not by chance that at the moment of the Communion—the most sublime moment of all—that the composer effaces himself and leaves it to his little winged companions to express the exaltation and the joy of the Christian soul in communion with its Lord.”13 Landale’s final phrase may overstress human emotions at this moment of spiritual transport—the calm, almost saccharine movement 16, “Prayer after Communion,” would seem more apt for that humble, achievable task. But the remainder of her assessment conveys well the manner in which birdsong, in its inhuman difference, seems to give some sort of voice to that divine essence distinct from ourselves, a bit of which the sacrament nonetheless promises, by grace, to bestow upon its recipients.</p>
      <p>Once established, this radical difference of birdsong as something other than human may prove transitive, passing on its potentially divine aspects to other segments of the movement and to the overall piece. For instance, we need not regard the segments of Gregorian plainchant, incorporated into “The Hidden God” and three later movements, as the product of human authorship. They can be seen that way, of course (as I will in a moment), but they might also be heard with different ears, as if they were emerging out of nature. Plainchant, like birdsong, might be considered as taking its place in <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic> through an act of objective transcription by Messiaen rather than of his creative composition. Plainchant, like birdsong from the Near East, may seem to come to us from distant times. United in “The Hidden God” across the divide of modernist monody manifestly composed by Messiaen himself, the two can appear as direct expressions of inscrutable entities, which, unlike us, are seemingly in direct contact with higher spiritual forces. “There is probably only one truly religious music because it’s detached from all external effect, and that’s plainchant, also called Gregorian chant,” Messiaen stated, in a formulation that emphasizes the separation of such music from mundane matters.14 He added, elsewhere: “Only plainsong possesses all at once the purity, the joy, the lightness necessary for the soul’s flight toward Truth.”15 And perhaps, in a conceptual stretch, we might break our identification with the composer that we established when we were viewing birdsong and plainchant from afar with him and might even be able to cast Messiaen’s modernist passages as the emanation of a profoundly spiritual soul moved by divine inspiration rather than by human deliberation. In contrast, we others—auditors at a performance, analysts reading this essay—feel our earthbound selves distanced from such immediate grace.</p>
      <p>The contemporary philosopher and theologian Jean‐Luc Marion (not to be confused with the much earlier Abbot Marmion lionized by Messiaen) has written: “Between God and man, incommensurability alone makes intimacy possible.”16 According to Marion, any attempt to “fix the distant and diffuse divinity” by representing it in a cultural artifact “on the basis of the experience of the divine that is had by man” cannot help but reduce God to merely human measure and thus fails utterly to seize that aspect of divinity that surpasses the mundane (5). True divinity expands infinitely beyond such anthropomorphic confines. Conversely, the divine may better approach when humans acknowledge their incapacity to capture it through their own concepts and devices of resemblance. The Eucharist plays on this logic when recognition of the presence of Christ in the host and in the chalice relies not on any empirical likeness between comestibles and deity but rather on a faith that always accepts the basic incommensurability between mundane attributes and divine essence. In order to allow the divine to approach, humans must forgo trying to draw it near through resemblance. Marion articulates the paradox of proximity and distance with lapidary concision: “God withdraws in the distance, unthinkable, unconditioned, and therefore infinitely closer” (215), and “only separation can define approach, and withdrawal advent” (23).</p>
      <p>While <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic> cannot resemble the divine any more than the Eucharist can, like the sacrament it does offer manifestations of the incommensurate. When we choose to hear them in this manner (with the “different ears” I propose above), birdsong, plainchant, and even modernist monody withdraw from the precincts of our ordinary conceptions and representations to inhabit places of elemental difference. And with that remove arrives the possibility of an intimacy. Invoking the incommensurate cannot force the divine to arrive; the deity would no more be beholden to human recognition of its difference than to efforts to entrap it in resemblance. To formulate distance as Messiaen does is to proffer an invitation, not to issue a command. In this regard, the segments of “The Hidden God” play on an enabling circularity: the more we grant to them an incommensurability modeled on the deity’s necessary autonomy from human constraint, the more they become potential vessels for the unconditional presence of the divine.</p>
      <p>But certainly we need not grant them that radical alterity. We need not listen with pious ears; indeed, in many respects we cannot. Pulling back from the conceptual stretch proposed above (barely credible even then): of course, Messiaen’s modernist meanderings on the keyboard are the result of his human hand in composition, and subject to our human acts of musicological analysis. Of course, plainchant was likewise once composed. Of course, Messiaen did not simply transcribe the monody of the monks but needed to select it and regularize it to modern notation. Above all, he had need to reach decisions about how best to approximate (or not) the sonorities of the singing voice using the organ stops available to him at La Trinité. Of course, similarly, the pipes of his instrument can only roughly replicate the timbres of actual bird sounds. Because certain aspects of avian “song” (itself an anthropomorphizing metaphor) are actually undetectable by human ears—too fast, too high, with minute shifts in pitch—Messiaen had to modify his transcriptions to render them fit to be played and heard on the organ. Even when owning up to such alterations, however, Messiaen would claim: “What I restore is nevertheless exact. It’s a transposition of what I heard, but on a more human scale.”17 The composer may insist on fidelity, but with his talk of “human scale” he certainly abandons aspirations toward conveying the incommensurate, as Marion would conceive it. “The idol,” Marion writes, using his term for any human attempt to bring a god before us through a concept that describes it or an image that resembles it, “is characterized solely by the subjection of the divine to the human conditions for experience of the divine” (6).</p>
      <p>Rather than transcribing objectively, Messiaen’s musical phrases—heard now with cynical ears rather than pious ones—merely resemble birdsong and plainchant.18 Rather than opening upon the ineffable, <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic>, with all parts now equally the product of the composer’s hand, returns us to the world of human craftsmanship. By these lights, it would seem that if the organ suite is to be about the Eucharist as the Eucharist is to be about God, Messiaen has produced nothing more than (in Marion’s words) an idol. By attempting to bring monks and birds and gods into the modern sanctuary, he has caused them instead to fly far away. If incommensurability is a precondition to intimacy, then Messiaen’s attempt to bring the signs of divinity close would reciprocally appear to alienate any deity from this now comfortably recognizable human abode.</p>
      <p>Yet it would be to miss the point entirely to imagine that cynical ears thus shatter the aural illusions of incommensurability first heard by pious ears, thereby revealing the true human character of <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic> (a secular “Truth” to replace Messiaen’s religious one). Rather, the two manners of listening always work in tandem, constantly reformulating in their interplay the paradox of distance and proximity that renders possible the advent of the divine. Just as the irruption of radical difference (in the form of birdsong, plainchant, and so on) upsets the prideful conceit that the music is fully the product of (a) man, so too the inevitable recognition that radical difference appears in <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic> only as a series of resemblances has the effect of projecting real incommensurability outward, where it surely must belong: beyond the scope (Messiaen’s “human scale”; Marion’s “human conditions”) of the composition itself. The second, cynical set of ears reinvents distance just when the first, pious set of ears threatens to turn difference into an idol based on resemblance, but also, pious ears prevent cynical ears from reducing difference and distance into nothing more than their human representation. It is precisely in the failure of Messiaen’s attempt to render the incommensurate present through transcription that he succeeds in reopening the immeasurable distance of the divine, which in turn reactivates the possibility of intimacy precluded by the idol. After all, the birds and the monks first sing in the section of <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic> devoted to expressing the human moods of the modern worshipper. Their inhuman difference does its work here only within—and then, breaking beyond (that is its purpose)—that most proximate of contexts, the contemporary human mind.</p>
      <p>The second section of <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic>, comprising movements 5–11, sets aside that preceding context of current consciousness (although, in an obvious sense imposed by the ordering of the movements, it is already framed by that earlier approach). The pious monks of yore point us back in time, and the birds of the Near East direct us geographically: these movements will retell the miraculous events of Jesus’s life and death—and, ostensibly, life again—all transpiring two millennia ago in the Holy Land. With the shift in time and place, Messiaen also alters the structure of his musical exposition. Instead of being collections of static contemplative states, these later movements are driven forcefully forward by both their thematic material and their musical development. The Catholic Mass begins with the establishment toward God of a worshipful attitude by the gathered disciples (the priest intones during the Penitential Rite, “My brothers and sisters, to prepare ourselves to celebrate the sacred mysteries, let us call to mind our sins,” following which, during the Gloria, the congregation affirms: “We worship you, we give you thanks, we praise you for your glory”) before moving on to the Liturgy of the Word, during which lessons from the Bible are read aloud.19 In parallel fashion, <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic> proceeds from its initial exposition of moods of devotion—“Adoro te” and the rest—to the recounting of seminal tales passed down from the evangelists. Yet just as the contemplative states of the piece’s first section were fruitfully disrupted by irruptions of incommensurability from afar, the imparting in the second section of biblical narratives from a distant time and place will constantly and necessarily be peppered with reminders of the proximity of their retelling in this musical rendition. (In general, narrative itself may have this tendency, as it both sustains the illusion that events recount themselves as if of their own accord and reveals its own devices of dramatic tension and resolution.)</p>
      <p>The paratexts in <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic> lay out the trajectory, slightly idiosyncratic, of this telling of the Christ story. Movement 5, “Puer natus est nobis” (Unto Us a Child Is Born), begins at an obvious place, the nativity. With movement 6, the scene shifts to the topic of “Manna and the Bread of Life.” A set of epigraphs from the Book of Wisdom 16:20–21 (canonical in the Roman Catholic version of the Bible), from John 6:51 quoting Jesus’s sermon at Capernaum, and from Abbot Marmion discussing Communion, interrupt the flow of narrative time, leaping from Jesus’s disquisition on the Bread of Life backward to the Old Testament precedent of manna from heaven and forward to the inauguration of the Eucharist during the Last Supper. Movement 7, “The Resurrected and the Light of Life,” extends the digression by drawing a parallel between “eternal life” promised to “those who eat my flesh and drink my blood” and the “light of life” to be enjoyed by “whoever follows me” (the epigraphs, quoting Jesus, are from John 6:54 and 8:12) (46). Movement 8, “The Institution of the Eucharist”—the sole epigraph quotes Jesus saying, “This is my body. This is my blood” (Matt. 26:26, 28)—resumes the chronological recounting, an order that will not be broken again during the second section (52). “The Darkness,” the title of movement 9, refers to the gloom that descended on earth “from the sixth to the ninth hour,” as one of the epigraphs recounts, on the day of the Crucifixion (Matt. 27:45) (56). The final two movements of the section might best exemplify the range of Messiaen’s use of narrative: movement 10, “The Resurrection of Christ,” celebrating the greatest miracle on which a new religion would be founded; and movement 11, “The Appearance of the Risen Christ to Mary Magdalene,” which, in its complex and extended rendition of the postpaschal encounter between Savior and disciple, establishes itself as the dramatic high point of <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic>. It will reward our efforts to examine in some depth Messiaen’s means for formulating narrative in these two movements before we try to make sense of the role of narrative from this second section within the larger purpose of <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic>.</p>
      <p>“The Resurrection of Christ” is massive and muscular, a mesomorph of a movement. With a panoply of stops drawn—the score specifies the pleins‐jeux, or “full chorus” mixture—a progression of thick chords at a bone‐rattling triple forte pushes slowly but inexorably forward. Six long passages, separated by pauses of several seconds, grope through dissonant combinations of notes in search of resolution; the texture and atonality (although not the volume) recall movement 1, “Adoro te,” in which such chords, played forte, suggested human striving to know God. And is not such striving an apt description (one of many possible) of Jesus’s three‐year ministry on earth, when, having “emptied himself” of divinity to be “born in human likeness” through kenosis, he struggled to make a glimpse of the Kingdom of God visible on earth (Phil. 2:7)? The difference lies in the denouement: whereas the human spiritual quest never reaches an end, Christ, the “Son of Man,” will soon shed his mortal shell to be “seated at the right hand of the power of God” (as he declares in Luke 22:69 to the priests and the scribes during his interrogation, hours before the Crucifixion). Appropriately, in the final passage of movement 10, one protracted phrase lasting over a minute continues the atonal (earthly) searching by the notes played on the manual, but now they move obliquely against a sustained C‐sharp held by the pedal.20 That C‐sharp assumes the role of Christ’s foretelling of his grand elevation on the third day, and finally the chords on the manual work their way to that triumphant truth: the Resurrection, in the form of a pure F‐sharp major chord, built up from the tonic held by the pedal and extending for octaves, held on its own for the musical near eternity of over a half a minute. The full movement, with no previous tonal resolutions at the ends of its earlier passages, feels in retrospect as if it were elementally simple, no more than one long cadence leading to the redeeming light of this final chord.21 In terms of musical structure, it is perhaps the most compelling movement in the suite, in the literal sense of the Latin root <italic>pellere</italic>, to drive. The contrast could not be more obvious, even heavy‐handed, with the end of the previous movement, “The Darkness,” which consists of all twelve half steps of a chromatic scale—plus an octave G, making thirteen notes—held simultaneously in the lower register. Resolution into tonality (so sparse in <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic>) signals divine advent (so rare in human history); atonality characterizes the tragedy of our mundane existence cast in shadows. The latter passes miraculously into the former: from the perspective of this pious composer, is there any tale more worthy of being told?</p>
      <p>Christ has risen, but humanity does not yet know of the event. That first revelation provides the theme for movement 11, “The Apparition of the Resurrected Christ to Mary Magdalene,” the longest of the suite. The epigraph digests the story as given in John: “Mary stood weeping outside the tomb. She turned round and saw Jesus, but she did not know that it was he. Jesus said to her, ‘Mary!’ She turned and exclaimed: ‘Rabbouni!’ (which means Teacher). Jesus said to her, ‘Go find my brothers and repeat to them my words, “I am going to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God”’” (John 20:11, 14, 16–17) (64). Fittingly, the movement relates the episode from the perspective of the mortal Magdalene.22 That choice of perspective perpetuates the interplay of proximity and distance initiated in the first section of <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic>. On the one hand, identification with the Magdalene transports auditors far away from the contemporary church (the setting of the first and third sections) to biblical lands and times, to view through the eyes of someone who ostensibly witnessed not some representation of Christ but his true miraculous presence. On the other hand, <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic> can only represent such transportation rather than perform it—a failure figured, moreover, in the shift in media from the Magdalene’s pure vision to the auditors’ hearing of Messiaen’s piece and their reading of its paratexts. Moreover, even if the suite could so transport us, it would land us in the Magdalene’s human carapace, from which it would be no more possible than from our own to grasp the divine without turning it into an idol expressing only the human experience of it.</p>
      <p>Movement 11 follows the various stages of the Magdalene’s story, step by step, with a devotion to programmatic narrative that would have made proud Paul Dukas, Messiaen’s professor of composition and composer of <italic>The Sorcerer’s Apprentice</italic> of 1897 (whose storytelling potential Walt Disney realized to spectacular effect in the film <italic>Fantasia</italic> of 1940).23 Whereas divine elevation in movement 10 takes the form of simple and strong cadential resolution into eternal harmony, the extended and tonally convoluted musical development in a mixture of styles that recounts the revelation in movement 11 evokes the human experience of gradually coming into knowledge in fits and starts and then feeling it fade away into memory. Owing to its unfolding over time in this manner, narrative is in its essence human, not divine.</p>
      <p>Messiaen will not risk the train of his storytelling being lost: the score for movement 11 is sprinkled with notations linking specific musical passages to moments in the tale. “End of night” (65) is the first such notation, followed musically by (in Messiaen’s own characterization from the introduction) “confusing chromatic counterpoints that gradually ascend” to “describe this moment” (2). Although unlabeled within the score, a rising, atonal, rhythmically symmetrical monody clearly is meant to symbolize the next event Messiaen mentions in the introduction: “Marie‐Magdalene, close to the sepulcher in tears, turns around and sees Jesus without recognizing him” (2).24 After more murky rumblings gradually rising, a silent pause fills several seconds, reminiscent of the breaks between distinct segments in movement 3 and other earlier movements. The notation set into the score at this point, however, has the effect of bridging the stylistic difference between segments by slotting the shift in mood into the narrative: “Jesus says to her: ‘Mary!’” (68). Messiaen’s description from the introduction of the following musical passage leaves no doubt of the composer’s use of contrast between atonality and tonality to represent the difference between the mundane and the divine: “Mysterious and solemn chords symbolize the appearance of the risen Christ, and his gentle voice that seems to come from beyond” (2). These slow, quiet chords do begin with some atonal tension, perhaps to suggest the terrestrial and temporal act of “appearing.” They conclude, however, with a pure C‐major chord extending euphonically over octaves on top of a low pedal tonic, presumably to suggest “[Jesus’s] gentle voice.”</p>
      <p>Another pause is followed by another notation: “She exclaimed: ‘Rabbouni!’” (68). When the music resumes, however, it conveys the sense not of some sudden epiphany but rather of the Magdalene’s gradually dawning recognition (at dawn, moreover) of the true identity of the figure before her. Musical phrases striving upward—always brighter, always quicker, increasingly without intervening rests—culminate after well over two minutes of agitation in three magnificent cadences that recapitulate the tonal simplicity of Christ’s voice emerging out of atonality at the end of the previous segment.25 The decelerating and more ponderous passage that follows, although still splendid, seems to capture the Magdalene’s gradual acceptance, following the elation of pure wonder, of the gravity of the miracle entrusted to her. The introduction specifies more reason for sobriety at this moment in movement 11: “To the mysterious chords one adds the wail from the crucifixion: the glorious body of Jesus Christ has retained the marks of the five wounds”—although no obvious correlate (five chords or phrases, say) offers itself in the music (2).</p>
      <p>“Then comes the mission” (2). While the right hand twitters with the song of a white‐throated robin (native to the Near East and notated in the score as an “Iranie”), the left hand plays a modernist monody to which the word “Fils” printed in a large font at the beginning of the stave would seem to grant unambiguous meaning. Beneath the following system of staves, which musically notate a rapidly rising line in both hands, the designation “vers (directionnel)” is written (a quite similar rendition of these two words and their accompanying musical passages can be found at the bottom of fig. 1, which records their reiterated versions a few moments later in the piece). And below that is more white‐throated robin above a left hand playing a line labeled “Pere.” Messiaen has spelled out the crucial message from the Gospel, “Son … toward … Father,” in a manner that claims the clarity of strict denotation (76). Through this combination of text and music, Christ seems to be speaking to Mary Magdalene with the exaggerated diction that one might reserve for a child to whom one must trust a vital communication somewhat above his or her level of comprehension.<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg1" position="float" seq="1">

      </p>
      <p>Yet perhaps even this musical language will not prove certain enough. Individual notes now take on alphabetic specificity. Messiaen next spells out the phrase “<sc>votre pere</sc>” using the “communicable language” that the composer first formulated for his organ <italic>Méditations</italic> in 1969, whereby each letter of the alphabet is assigned a note of precise pitch and duration (77; top of fig. 1). “<sc>votre</sc>” is played out in pure octaves, while the notes of “<sc>pere</sc>” sit atop complex chords. These chords in movement 11, in fact, repeat the same pattern, now transposed by a tritone, that Messiaen used in the first measure of the passage at the end of movement 10, a musical linkage of the theologically closely related notions of Resurrection and Ascension.26 For both words, lest the reader of the score fail to recognize in the irregular melody Messiaen’s systematic communicable language, capital letters are printed one by one, directly above the notes assigned to them. After an extended reiteration of the “Son … toward … Father” device (bottom of fig. 1), Messiaen returns to his communicable language to spell out “<sc>votre</sc>” (octaves only) and “<sc>dieu</sc>” (again, above chords derived from the “Resurrection” pattern), followed by the terrifying communication not mentioned in the Gospels but interpolated by Messiaen: “<sc>apocalypse</sc>” (again, octaves only). An insert into the score reads “revelation of the Resurrection and the Ascension” (79), while the introduction explains, rather cryptically: “It is the revelation of Resurrection and the Ascension: this is why a musical alphabet renders fortissimo the word ‘Apocalypse’ (Revelation)” (2). The movement then concludes with, first, a nearly exact inversion of the opening—chromatic rumblings now descend, interspersed with descending phrases of atonal monody—and, second (with interjected notation “the apparition disappears”; 81), a reprise of “the mysterious and solemn chords of the Risen Christ” (2). The Magdalene’s immediate experience of the resurrected Jesus, it would seem, has passed into memory.</p>
      <p>What has transpired here, with this mixing of music and words in movement 11? If birdsong serves Messiaen as the expression of sovereign divinity or perhaps of grace, this musico‐textual amalgam emerges as his figure for revelation, God’s disclosure of truth to humans, realized with a denotative exactitude that would brook no ambiguity. The atonal, rhythmically irregular melody that results from the spelling out of words using the communicable language might well transfer the association to all previous and following instances of modernist monody, such as we have seen in movement 3 in the first thematic section and which also appear in movement 18 in the third section. Revelation, it would seem, has always been and always will be with us. By transporting us away from ourselves back to a distant moment when, ostensibly, Mary Magdalene actually encountered the risen Christ, Messiaen’s music reminds us of the lingering possibility of intimacy with the divine.</p>
      <p>But, of course, such intimacy once again eludes us as soon as it is brought close. Messiaen’s devices at this climactic moment in the drama can only be figures of revelation, not revelation itself. Like almost all textual figures, they are arbitrary. While Messiaen may have wished for a motivated connection linking letters lockstep to notes (the letter “A” matches pitch “A,” and so forth), both the letters and the notes are themselves parts of unmotivated systems of signs. Indeed, the fact that this dramatic high point of movement 11 juxtaposes two different systems for coordinating musical and textual phrases—the new “Son … toward … Father” device and the older communicable language—casts Messiaen’s own efforts into the fallen state of post‐Babel linguistic multiplicity, where all languages bear the all‐too‐human stamp of capricious choice among opaque symbols. The self‐conscious labeling in the score, moreover, cannot be heard by the auditor at the performance. “Apocalypse,” the greatest revelation ostensibly at the heart of the message imparted by Jesus to the Magdalene in a distant desert on that Sunday morning two millennia ago, becomes in <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic> no more than an epiphenomenal paratext, appended as if in commentary upon the music itself.</p>
      <p>And is not “Apocalypse” itself a somewhat disconcerting communiqué to find cropping up here at this dramatic climax of <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic>: not truth in its immediacy but rather in its seemingly endless deferral? While the word “apocalypse” may literally denote nothing more than “revelation,” its attachment to the final book of the Bible—the Revelation to John is sometimes known as the Apocalypse of John—and its long association with eschatological ideas means that for most of Messiaen’s auditors the appearance of the word at this central point in the <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic> would surely evoke thoughts of Judgment Day yet to come. Any witnesses to the actual Resurrection who held Messianic beliefs (and Mary Magdalene presumably belonged to such a sect) would have greeted the raising of Christ as the announcement that the end of time had indeed arrived.27 By these lights, the delay between Christ’s Resurrection and the raising (or, for the unworthy, the damning) of humans living and dead could be expected to be so short that the two should properly be considered one single redemptive event. When the Parousia failed to arrive immediately—when it became the Second Coming, in contradistinction to and in ever greater distance from the first—the relation between Resurrection and Apocalypse transmogrified from actual identity to metaphoric similarity. Our salvation would be like, not the same as, Christ’s. All of modern history under the New Covenant, a period now spanning nearly two millennia, then becomes one extended elaboration of the ever‐increasing difference, filling the ever wider temporal gap, between the two now distinct events. For Messiaen, composing within history, to have the Word “speak” (through whatever means) Apocalypse would seem a prolepsis of extravagant proportions, as if the composer had accidentally opened his Bible to the wrong John, quoting the prognosticating author of Revelation rather than the retrospective evangelist. Back then and over there, the Magdalene could well accept the risen Christ’s revelation of Apocalypse (as conveyed by word or by sight or by sound; it doesn’t matter which, for the medium disappears along with the mediation) while granting it the pure facticity of an unfolding event. In contrast, the auditor of <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic>—or rather, yet further afield, the reader of its score—confronts Apocalypse as a figure recalling from a future perspective the Easter of a distant past (or, conversely, regards Resurrection from the past as a prefiguration of future Parousia) or perhaps parses the juxtaposition as a rhetorical evocation of the very history from which contemporary auditors and readers themselves experience their own distance from God. (A Second Coming would reconvert extravagant metaphor back into identity by obviating intervening history altogether and reestablishing perfect intimacy with Father and Son. As Marion argues: “No theology will ever be able to attain the first Parousia by an adequate extension of the text to the referent; for that, nothing less than a second Parousia of the Word would be necessary.”)28 In telling its biblical tale from the Magdalene’s vantage, movement 11 actually highlights our ineluctable distance and difference from her, and from Jesus of the Resurrection.</p>
      <p>The second section of <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic> thus reverses the trajectory of the first section but arrives at much the same outcome. Whereas the static movements of the first section commence within the mind of the contemporary worshipper in order to discover a distance from God that paradoxically permits intimacy, the narrative movements of the second section transport us from the present to gain intimacy with biblical minds, only to discover there our ineluctable distance from God. Irrespective of whether we imagine that the Magdalene at that moment actually had immediate access to divine truth or not (we cannot even know whether she was a fictional character or a historical personage, let alone what she might have known), the look through her eyes at the risen Christ as provided by <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic> can never become (to reactivate Marion’s term) an idol that resembles God but rather remains always a distant and thus enabling figuration of him, a paratextual reference to an extravagant metaphoric formulation of ever‐increasing difference from the biblical event itself.29</p>
      <p>The third section of <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic>, movements 12–18, makes a partial effort toward formulating a story about the experience of the Eucharist in the contemporary liturgy but never manages to sustain a narrative flow. Appropriately, musical structure within the movements takes more the form of sequential segments, similar to those in the first section, rather than tending toward thematic development of the sort manifested in the longer movements of the second section. Only four of the seven movements attend to the actual steps of the Mass: movement 12, on “The Transubstantiation,” and the short series we have already encountered from movements 14–16 that traces the passage from “Prayer before Communion” through “The Joy of Grace” during the Communion to “Prayer after Communion.” Movement 13, “The Two Walls of Water,” develops an extravagant metaphor leaping back in time to compare the two halves of the broken wafer to the parting of the Red Sea, recounted in Exod. 14:15–30. Movement 17, on “The Multiple Presence,” comments on the expansive property of the Eucharist, whereby, in the words of Messiaen’s introduction, “Jesus Christ is present in all the consecrated hosts in the world, in all times and places” (2). Finally, the “Offering and Final Alleluia” caps the entire suite with the “offering to God of all the prayers of all the Saints” (2). Although it commences quietly (and, in passing, relies on Messiaen’s seemingly disambiguating communicable language to spell out “<sc>la joie</sc>”), most of the movement is bombastically loud and overcrowded with notes (162). The finale may highlight the human virtuosity required to perform the piece as well as provide a hyperventilating ending of the theater‐organ variety, but—much as movement 4 disappointed as a meaningful finish to the first section—movement 18 is far from the most important passage in the third section for conveying the divine.</p>
      <p>The two most telling movements are also the most expansive conceptually: movement 13 on “The Two Walls of Water” and movement 17 on “The Multiple Presence.” Each discovers whole worlds in a single thin wafer: either a signature event from the Old Testament or the collectivity of all Masses performed at every time and place. If “Apocalypse” (viewed now as something said then) stretched its metaphoric connection to the Resurrection near to the breaking point of rhetorical reasonableness, these figures may pull us beyond the limits of plausibility. The first, “The Two Walls of Water,” evokes a miracle on the scale of armies and great natural forces that—while it may qualify as a well‐rehearsed typology for the Passion, when the central saving event of the Old Testament prefigures the main such event in the New Testament—vastly outstrips the small size and material simplicity of the flat wafer used routinely in ordinary Mass. The second, “The Multiple Presence,” may be grounded on perfectly solid theological doctrine, but in the context of this musical account of the actual experience of one contemporary visit to the Communion table, it makes an excessive leap from one instance of the Eucharist, as opposed to the general principle of it, to them all. <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic> is, in fact, replete with extravagant metaphors of this sort: light is like the fountain of life, manna is like the Eucharist, atonality is like mundane struggle, harmony is like divinity, a correlation of musical notes and written letters is like revelation, and even birdsong is like the advent of the divine. The master trope of <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic> is catachresis, which the <italic>Oxford English Dictionary</italic> defines as “improper use of words; application of a term to a thing which it does not properly denote; abuse or perversion of a trope or metaphor.” In a sense, all metaphors (indeed, all tropes) are improper to the extent that they pull terms beyond their proper usage (an idealized literalness that, in any case, is impossible to achieve in actual practice); catachreses, however, call special attention to their impropriety through their patent far‐fetchedness.30 In this manner, Messiaen repeatedly underscores his rhetorical artifice by reaching too far.</p>
      <p>And yet these same expansive movements, 13 and 17, also manifest a literalness of the strictest sort. How does Messiaen express the crashing of the two walls of water down upon the Egyptian army in pursuit of the escaping Jews? “Waves” of paired four‐note runs descend in the right hand while rising in the left hand, until the two hands overlap, literally closing the once‐open gap between the thumbs (fig. 2). How to express the multiple presence of Christ in all the hosts? One note (right hand), then two notes together (right hand and left hand), then three (right hand, left hand, and pedal). Once recognized at these spots, previous instances of blatant literalness come readily to mind. In movement 6, “Manna and the Bread of Life,” manna falls downward; in movement 9, “The Darkness,” musical lines disperse outward to express, in the words of the introduction, “the tearing of distended limbs” (1); in movement 11, as we have seen, “Son” rises “toward” “Father.” Even transcribed birdsong, presented with the pretense that we might now be hearing in church or concert hall what Jesus and his contemporaries once heard in the deserts of Israel, might seem pedantically straightforward in its avoidance of musical elaboration. All these instances, owing to their conflation of figurative reference and literal means, might be considered further cases of rhetorical abuse, even meriting the label of catachresis. As Andrzej Warminski explains: “The rhetorical handbooks have a name for it: catachresis, or abusive, far‐fetched metaphor like ‘leg of a table’ or ‘face of a mountain’—in the conventional sense at once a ‘figurative’ expression because it is transferred from elsewhere and ‘literal’ because there is no other way to say it, it is the ‘proper name’ of the thing.”31 (There is a possibility that in thus finding far‐fetchedness in the literal, the rhetoricians have themselves turned catachresis into a catachresis, but what could be more aptly abusive than that?) In <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic>, water converges, and the host multiplies in just this way: in a wildly figurative yet musically literal manner.<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg2" position="float" seq="2">

         </sup>, octavin, tierce [stops], in chords of mode three (first and second transpositions) [Messiaen’s own system of scales], <italic>grey and mauve</italic> against a held pianissimo on the cor de nuit [stop] of the choir [manual], in A flat major, <italic>violet blue</italic>, very calm”; “Christ suddenly presents himself, in all the force of his glory, with a fortissimo on the organ and luminous chords in which <italic>all the colors of the rainbow</italic> shine”; and “The fortissimo conclusion superimpos[es] complementary colors: <italic>acid green on brownish red, yellow on violet</italic>” (1–2; emphases added). It seems that Messiaen was a synesthete, someone who truly saw fields of color with the sounding of certain musical chords.32 In an interview, Messiaen explained: “I think complexes of sound correspond to complexes of color. A complex of ten or twelve sounds, for example, may correspond to a red flecked with violet with orange streaks. You know I have this strange ability to see complexes of color, not with my eyes but intellectually, while hearing complexes of sound; the same sound complex always engenders the same color complex.”33 On the one hand, for most of us, the metaphor is wildly overreaching. This chord is violet blue? That one is acid green? In what way? We lack the means even to posit which attribute of color could be placed in a relation of resemblance to some characteristic of music to allow the comparison in the first place. On the other hand, for Messiaen himself—judging from the speculations about synesthesia that the neurosciences have been able to provide—the connection between color and music may have lain so deep in the brain, in the limbic system of instinct and mood, that the composer felt each pairing to be preconscious, automatic, and unmotivated.34 One theory posits that synesthesia results from a genetic anomaly whereby the brain lacks the usual functional segregation between auditory and visual areas, with a resulting direct neurological linkage of sensation that causes the synesthete to experience this particular sound and that particular sight not as two interconnected sensations but rather as one single, selfsame stimulus.35 A trope such as “the violet blue of the A‐flat major chord” thus qualifies as catachresis in both directions: it both posits an absurdly far‐fetched relation between fundamentally incommensurate entities (such as “the acreage of heaven”) and constitutes an instance where a figurative comparison collapses into literal identity (such as “leg of a table”).</p>
      <p>Messiaen’s predilection toward catachresis in <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic> could hardly be more fitting for the topic of the Eucharist. Like the sacrament, the favored trope often barely resembles the object that it engages, if it does so at all. Like the sacrament, the trope may also allow its object to become present in itself. Sometimes (during Communion, for instance) a birdsong means the arrival of ineffable grace; sometimes (when heard in the desert, for instance, or out the window during the Last Supper) a birdsong is just a birdsong. Much as the Eucharist holds God at a distance, the better to permit his advent, Messiaen’s organ suite both pushes the host and chalice (and the various other themes they evoke) into the far distance and pulls them intimately near. In its rhetorical form, <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic> opens up the same expanse as does the Eucharist, across which the mysteries of the divine may multiply, as it both manifests itself and does not in the realm of the mundane. Catachresis is like access to God: always both too close and too far.</p>
      <p>During a lecture at Notre Dame Cathedral in 1977,36 Messiaen proclaimed:<disp-quote>
            <p>There is that break towards the beyond, towards the invisible and unspeakable, which may be made by means of <italic>sound‐color</italic>, and is summed‐up in the sensation of <italic>bedazzlement</italic>. (4)</p>
            <p>The tones strike and knock our inner ear, and these multicolored things move and irritate our inner eye, and establish contact, rapport (as Rainer Maria Rilke said) with another reality: a rapport so powerful that it can transform our most hidden “me,” the deepest, the most intimate, and dissolve us in a most high Truth which we could never hope to attain.</p>
            <p>Let us allow <italic>a priori</italic> that we are all capable of connecting sound to color and color to sound. Let us allow <italic>a priori</italic> that we are all capable of being amazed, of being dazzled by these sounds and these colors, and of touching, through them, something of that beyond. (12)</p>
            <p>All these bedazzlements are a great lesson. They show us that God is beyond words, thoughts, concepts. … Musical painting, colored music … are an excellent “passage,” an excellent “prelude” to the unspeakable and to the invisible. (14)</p>
         </disp-quote> For all his enthusiasm and awe, the composer allows a subtle slippage to occur in his argument here. What, precisely, cannot be perceived? Initially, it is the “multicolored things” that “tones” induce only on the “inner eye”; their relation to sound cannot be verified empirically but can only be posited “<italic>a priori</italic>.” That first “contact” then immediately prompts a second (the grammatical form here is a chain of “and”s, as if even the action of verbs need not intermediate), this one between the self, possessor of both “inner ear” and “inner eye,” and the “most high Truth” of “God.” In essence, the first instance of “another reality” (color) becomes a figure for the second (the divine), so we can be “bedazzled” by God even when we cannot see him.</p>
      <p>But, of course, colors can be seen—which is why we can be “bedazzled” by them.37 Although we may not discern the same violet blue that Messiaen’s inner eye envisioned when he composed that A‐flat major chord, we could nevertheless easily perceive that same violet blue were we presented with a swatch of it. The reason we can so easily imagine Messiaen’s synesthesia even if we do not experience it for ourselves is that both sound and color—unlike Messiaen’s perceived relation between them, and unlike the divine—present themselves immediately to our senses. (So immediately, in fact, that they defy representation: just as an instrument plays a note rather than sounding a likeness of it, a patch of blue can only present blue, not serve as its figure.) In taking up the topic of the Eucharist by using the figures that he does, Messiaen in effect reorients the direction of his rhetorical reach. Rather than having his tropes attempt to pierce through the veil of mundane appearances to grasp after the deeper essences of the divine (whereby, in any case, success would immediately turn God into merely our idol of him), the composer links his figures laterally, as it were, across the mundane field of his musico‐textural representation. The written letter “D” is like the musical note “D”; a chord is like a color is like a mood; a ripple of fingers is like a wave of water is like half of a broken host. In the place of hermeneutics (interpreting a text—in the first instance, the Bible—to discern deeper hidden meanings), Messiaen plays at semiotics, or, more particularly, at its subdiscipline of syntax (the interplay between signs).38</p>
      <p>This reorientation need not compromise the theological aspirations of <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic>; indeed, it may radically enhance them. Once the composition leaves the divine to its own deviceless devices (because gods, as I have argued elsewhere, do not trope), the divine miraculously reappears within the work’s own rhetorical figures.39 Once the composition recognizes God’s distance, it invites his intimacy.</p>
      <p>Consider again Marion’s account of the idol, which reduces God to the necessarily limited human experience or conception of him. Is God thus absent from the idol? Hardly so, argues Marion: “In the idol, the divine undoubtedly assumes the actual face of a god. But that god takes its form from the features that we have fashioned for it, in conformity with what we actually experience concerning the divine. … The idol does not resemble us, but it resembles the divinity that we experience, and it gathers in it a god in order that we might see it. The idol does not deceive; it apprehends the divinity.”40 God may well be present in the idol; the merely human act of representation would lack the power to exile him from there. The error lies not in seeing God in the idol, but rather in imagining that what one sees there is somehow commensurate to the deity itself, rather than to the human capacity to experience it. With that liberating recognition—that any perception of an aspect of God is necessarily incomplete, only a cipher for the incomprehensible whole—the idol transmogrifies into what Marion labels the “icon,” owing to a change in the attitude of the observer, not in the properties of the artifact itself.41 To express this idea, Marion relies on an intriguing metaphor (a catachresis, actually, using “white light” to figure the divine): “The topology of the mirror, where the idol reflected back to us the authentic but closed image of <italic>our</italic> experience of the divine, is replaced [with the icon] by the typology of the prism: a multiplicity of colors breaks down, or rather orchestrates, that which a prism multiplies according to our power to see—light called white (which it is not) since it remains invisible at the very moment that it renders all things visible.”42 The icon, like the idol, is all about things seen (Marion quips that the icon is “a visibility where the invisible gives itself to be seen as such”); where they differ is that with the icon the observers acknowledge that they perceive only the partial, earthly manifestations of a greater, imperceptible force (8).</p>
      <p>Preceding Marion (and perhaps unknown to him), Marmion had made much the same case about the Eucharist. It was an argument that greatly influenced Messiaen, who quoted the following passage from Marmion in one of his epigraphs in <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic>: “The life that Christ gives us through communion is his whole life, with the special graces that he earned for us by living for us each one of his mysteries” (34). With an opening claim that much resembles Marion’s analysis of the idol, Marmion elaborates in <italic>Christ in His Mysteries</italic>: <disp-quote>
            <p>Of all the properties that Holy Scripture attributes to the manna, there is one which is particularly remarkable. The manna was a food which accommodated itself to the taste and wishes of the one who partook of it. … In the heavenly Bread, the Eucharist, we can also find, if I may thus express myself, the savour of all the mysteries of Christ, and the virtue of all His states. (350–51)</p>
            <p>Under the Eucharistic species is found only the substance of the <italic>glorious</italic> body of Jesus, such as it is at present in heaven, and not such as it was, for example, in the crib of Bethlehem.</p>
            <p>But when the Father looks upon His Son Jesus in the heavenly splendours, what does He behold in Him? He sees the One Who lived thirty three years upon earth for us, He beholds all the mysteries that this mortal life contained, the satisfactions and the merits whereof the mysteries were the source; He beholds the glory that this Son gave Him in living each of them.</p>
            <p>All these states of the life of Jesus are, in substance, given to us in Communion, with their properties, their spirit, their merits and their virtue: under the diversity of states, and the variety of mysteries, is perpetuated the identity of the Person Who lived them and now lives eternally in Heaven. (352–53)</p>
         </disp-quote>According to Marmion, all aspects of Christ are present in the Eucharist (which is to say, all of Christ, aspectless in his wholeness), even if we cannot see them all. What we can perceive are those mundane aspects of a kenotic Christ who chose to “live” some of these “mysteries” and “states” among humans on earth. Appreciation of the Eucharist—by Marmion, Messiaen, and even Marion—depends on both an acceptance of the “whole life” of Christ beyond our compass and an embrace of the multiple, partial manifestations of that life in the icons of the world, foremost in the Eucharist.</p>
      <p>
         <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic>, composed by a man who once referred to his musical language as a “theological rainbow,” offers just such a set of partial slices taken from those aspects of Christ that might conform to the spectrum of human experience, with the prospect that divine radiance generates it all from beyond the prism.43 Birdsong, plainchant, modern atonality, the letters of the alphabet, biblical events, theological precepts, current liturgy: all these manifestations of the mundane—fully perceivable and conceivable by humans—play with and against one another across Messiaen’s semiotic field. We can experience their intimate approach (the transparency of birdsong, say) and their unnerving retreat into distance (the opacity of an atonal chord). Throughout, the push and pull of catachresis, aided by the fragmentation of the composer’s antinarrative sequential organization and the aching pauses between segments, serve always to remind us of the sheer absurdity of expecting any authorizing coherence at the level of the mundane. In an almost Cubist manner, <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic> allows fragmentary aspects of the world—and through those aspects of the world, aspects of God—to take up presence in it, only to also remind us (in a manner that Cubism, so full of epistemic hubris, never does) that those disjointed fragments will never on their own equal a whole.44 Messiaen represents the extravagance of any hermeneutic leap toward the divine by using perhaps the best means at his disposal, belaboring, as a metaphor for that hermeneutic, the far‐fetchedness of any metaphoric connection between strictly literal figures stretched out across the semiotic field (figures that, paradoxically, might become graced by divine presence owing precisely to their humble mundaneness).</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, the composer (and undoubtedly our two theologians along with him) would never have dared maintain that <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic> was equal to the Eucharist, much less an idol that resembled it. The organ suite cannot do what can be done by the Eucharist, the icon in its purest form (unless Jesus himself be considered that). The sacrament, according to doctrine, makes Christ present with certainty, and that certain presence, far from being discerned by the fallible senses, can be ascertained exclusively by infallible faith. Such faith cannot be explained or justified by human means; only God himself can give it cause, and at the Last Supper supposedly he did: “This is my body. … This is my blood.” <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic>—with its hyperabundance of disparate elements and its play of extravagant tropes, overly figurative and overly literal in the same moment—would not pretend to deliver the certainty that Jesus’s speech‐act entails. It proffers instead a prompt to (or, to return to Marmion’s metaphor from the beginning of this essay, a “light to help”) fidelity to Christian truth. As he neared his conclusion to the lecture at Notre Dame, Messiaen rhapsodized: “Touching at once our noblest senses [of] hearing and vision, [colored music] shakes our sensibilities into motion, pushes us to go beyond concepts, to approach that which is higher than reason and intuition, that is <sc>faith</sc>” (15). We could hardly ask <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic>, as it eschews the middle distance of resemblance, to draw us any closer to the Eucharist, or to hold us back so far.</p>

               <p>The first such phrase, drawing to an end some forty seconds into the piece, supplements the notes of an F major triad with a disruptive D‐flat that clashes with the triad’s fifth of C; the final chord bunches together all six notes of an atonal whole‐tone scale built on a pedal C. Diane Luchese has written about this movement: “Dissonant harmonies do not resolve to consonances at ends of phrases. Even the final chord is dissonant: a cluster of closely‐spaced whole tones in a low register. ‘Adoro te’ is devoid of contrasting themes, sudden dynamic changes, textural changes, and other significant contrasts or oppositions that would introduce an element of dramatic conflict” (“Olivier Messiaen’s Slow Music,” 164).</p>

Marmion himself would have revolted against my positing of such likeness in the Eucharist.

We do not even see his Manhood” (343). This argument strikes me as forced. How can the fleshy give of bread, that staple of life, not resemble the springiness of skin? How can red wine not evoke the color and liquidity, even the slight viscidity, of blood?</p>

When Messiaen is himself quoting from previous writers for the epigraphs (including from the Bible), I translate from the French as given in the musical score rather than from the source texts, in order to preserve as much as possible a sense of the presentation in Messiaen’s authoritative version. Owing to great irregularities in the names of organ stops, I will leave these in the French as they are listed in the score. Although <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic> was written for a first performance on the organ at the Metropolitan Methodist Church in Detroit, the names of the stops in the score correspond closely to those on the Cavaillé‐Coll organ at La Trinité, where Messiaen composed.</p>

               <p>Two technical innovations developed by the composer contribute to the sense of stasis in a large number of his works: his “non‐retrogradable rhythms,” or rhythmically palindromic phrases, and his own system of nondiatonic modes, with regularized intervals across the octave. About the rhythms, Ian Darbyshire quotes Messiaen’s own claim that “[in the life of the Resurrection] we will live in a duration malleable and transformable. The power of the musician, who retrogrades and permutes his durations, prepares us, in a small way, for that state …” (Ian Darbyshire, “Messiaen and the Representation of the Theological Illusion of Time,” in Bruhn, <italic>Messiaen’s Language of Mystical Love</italic>, 41 [interpolation from Darbyshire]; original from Olivier Messiaen, <italic>Traité de rythme, de couleur, et d’ornithologie</italic>, 7 vols. [Paris: Éditions Musicales Alphonse Leduc, 1994–2002], 3:353–54 [terminal ellipsis from Messiaen]). About the modes, Paul Griffiths writes: “Where Western music since the Renaissance has drawn its progressive energy from the asymmetries of the diatonic modes, Messiaen’s music attains stasis by its use of modes that reduce distinctions among their constituent notes. … The removal of distinctions removes the arrow of time.” Roberto Fabbi elaborates: “The use of the modes is mainly harmonic, but the intrinsic recurrence of the same intervals produces an antifunctional tonal ubiquity which subtracts dynamic‐motor tension from the harmony. Thus the chords form textures of colors and timbres that follow one another without pursuing any particular direction, and with a sort of spell‐binding force that resides in the latent and obligatory cyclicity of the scale structures. … The tangible restrictive effect … consist[s] in the subtraction of a directional temporal dimension from harmonic phenomena.” Paul Griffiths, <italic>Olivier Messiaen and the Music of Time</italic> (London: Faber &amp; Faber, 1985), 15; Roberto Fabbi, “Theological Implications of Restrictions in Messiaen’s Compositional Processes,” in Bruhn, <italic>Messiaen’s Language of Mystical Love</italic>, 59. While both of these techniques play a role in <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic>, I choose to focus my analysis on characteristics of the piece that relate more specifically to the theme of the Eucharist.</p>

               <p>The composer Trevor Hold commented about one of Messiaen’s earlier pieces that used birdsong: “The overall impression created by <italic>Réveil</italic> [<italic>des oiseaux</italic>] is not of a dawn chorus but of a cageful of mechanical birds. And why not? The music is enjoyable as music. Then why all the claims to ‘authenticity,’ the exhortations to walk in the woods to study the avian models, the scientific check‐list, etc.? If we examine a sample of the bird‐songs in <italic>Réveil</italic> it will be seen that they conform more closely to certain aspects of Messiaen’s musical techniques than they do to the models.” Or, as Alex Ross has quipped, “Messiaen’s birds seem conversant with [his] modes of limited transposition.” Hold, “Messiaen’s Birds,” 118; Alex Ross, <italic>The Rest Is Noise: Listening to the Twentieth Century</italic> (New York: Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 2007), 452.</p>

               <p>Amy Bauer points out to me that the progression here is a direct transcription of the “chords of transposed inversion over the same bass note” that Messiaen presents in <italic>Traité de rythme, de couleur</italic>, 3:86–87, where he also names the color patterns that he, as a synesthete, perceives with the sounding of each chord.</p>

               <p>The pedal tones would imply a perfect cadence, with a leap down a fifth from the long‐held C‐sharp to the terminal F‐sharp—although, in fact, the chord structures above are not that simple.</p>

               <p>Earlier movements in the second section likewise had opted for a human perspective: movement 5 on the nativity, “Puer natus est nobis,” can convincingly be interpreted as a rendition of the Virgin’s experience of the Annunciation, while movement 6, “Manna and the Bread of Life,” captures various sensations of the desert as they might have been perceived by the human aspect of Jesus and by his followers at Capernaum.</p>

               <p>The phrase begins with a dissonant leap of a tritone from C to F‐sharp followed by perfect fourth to a B; on its third appearance it is supplemented by a similar figure transposed a minor third higher to an initial E‐flat that first rises a perfect fourth to A‐flat before finishing with new tritone to D.</p>

               <p>I am working here from the ideas of Group μ, which proposes that we think of the proper use of a term to be the “degree zero” of its meaning that language in practice can approach but never attain.

I explore some of these concepts in “Wagner’s <italic>Ring of the Nibelung</italic>,” in my <italic>Our Distance from God</italic>, chap. 2; an earlier version of that essay appeared as “The Debts of Divine Music in Wagner’s <italic>Ring des Nibelungen</italic>,” <italic>Critical Inquiry</italic> 28 (Spring 2002): 677–708.</p>

Later in the interview, Messiaen suggested his own synesthetic abilities were somewhat less than complete: “My visions are intellectual, for I’m not afflicted, like [the painter] Blanc‐Gatti, with synesthesia” (167). But his descriptions of his experiences, above all his insistence that the linkages he perceived remained constant, would suggest a form of synesthesia in the composer that was neurologically hardwired.</p>

               <p>The concept of bedazzlement also figures in Marion’s writings on both theology and phenomenology. In the phenomenological arguments, where Marion links the concept with the excess of the “saturated phenomenon,” bedazzlement tends to receive more positive treatment than it does in the theological essays, where it carries a more negative charge owing to its association with the idol. See Jean‐Luc Marion, “Evidence and Bedazzlement” [1978], in his <italic>Prolegomena to Charity</italic>, trans. Stephen E. Lewis (New York: Fordham University Press, 2002), 53–70 (originally published in French as <italic>Prolégomènes à la charité</italic> [Paris: Éditions de la Différence, 1986]), and <italic>Being Given: Toward a Phenomenology of Givenness</italic>, trans.

               <p>Marion, <italic>The Idol and Distance</italic>, 8. Referring to the actual artwork of Byzantium, Marion continues: “We should remark that in the art of the icon, the codified colors (gold, red, blue, yellow, etc.) do not resemble any ‘thing’ that is supposed to be intrinsically colored thus; their significance is affirmed within a purely semiotic (in this case liturgical) field, where they announce eternity, divinity, glory, humanity, etc.” (8). Like Messiaen’s <italic>Book of the Holy Sacrament</italic>, such Byzantine icons would seem to play the semiotic field without claiming likeness to God.</p>
