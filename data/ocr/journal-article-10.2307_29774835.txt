<plain_text><page sequence="1">Extinction: Bad Genes or Bad Luck? David M. Raup, xvii + 210 pp. W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1991. $9.95. With the publication of On the Origin of Species in 1859, Charles Darwin began our modern understanding of how the diver? sity of life around us evolved. Tomes con? tinue to be written on the subject of how speciation occurs. This has not been the case for the flip side of speciation?extinc? tion?although it was accepted as a bio? logical phenomenon by the early 1800s be? cause of the observations of the French vertebrate paleontologist, George Cuvier. It is not as though there is a lack of in? terest in extinction. Yet within the context of evolutionary biology, David Raup ar? gues that extinction is not receiving the sort of attention it should command. He feels that the negative, anthropomorphic baggage of thinking of extinction in terms of our own mortality has stymied research on this topic. With a few exceptions, such as Norman Newell and Leigh Van Valen, there has been a concerted effort in the study of extinction only in the past 10 years, which have been marked by the publication of the Alvarez asteroid-impact model for extinctions at the end of the Cretaceous period and by modern envi? ronmental concerns. As an unrepentant advocate of the bolide-impact school of extinctions, David Raup weaves an engaging argument as to why impacts were not only the cause of all mass extinctions in earth's history, but also the cause of the vast majority of normal or background extinctions as well. The prob? lem, which Raup discusses, is that only at the end of the Cretaceous do we find con? vincing evidence that the mass extinction of some groups is coincidental with, and possibly caused by, a single or possibly multiple impacts. In reading Raup's argument for the pri? macy of impacts as the major cause of al? most all extinction, I am reminded of the more extreme advocates of vicariance bio geography, who claimed that all modern biotic distributions are explained by vic ariant (splitting) events to the exclusion of dispersal. It would be nice to find simple, single causes for all phenomena in the nat? ural realm, but facts that disrupt simple theories have a nasty habit of appearing at the least opportune time. Raup presents a very readable and in? formative consideration of the "bad luck" portion of his theme. The odds are simply against any one group surviving for any appreciable amount of geological time. Groups possessing large numbers of cos? mopolitan species certainly have an advan? tage both in terms of genes and luck, but if a truly catastrophic event such as an im? pact occurs, even these groups are not safe. Systematics is the one area that Raup failed to properly consider in his discus? sion of extinction. Nowhere is this more telling than his statement early in the book that "...the bird lineage split off millions of years before the dinosaurs died out in the mass extinction that ended the Cretaceous period. Cretaceous dinosaurs died without issue!"(page 7). With just a few hypotheti? cal word changes one can see the problem with this logic: "...the bat lineage split off millions of years before the mammals died out in the mass extinction that ended the Human Epoch. Human Epoch mammals died without issue!" But wait, you say, bats are mammals and their evolutionarily and ecologically closest relatives disap? peared. The same applies in the case of di? nosaurs. Birds are dinosaurs and their evolutionarily and ecologically closest rel? atives disappeared. Raup appears to ac? cept the well-documented dinosaur-bird connection; yet he made the above state? ment and repeated this same major error in his Figure 1-1 where he incorrectly showed dinosaurs as a lineage separate from birds. This is not a trivial concern, be? cause throughout this book, Raup uses systematic categories (families, genera, species) rather than the actual taxa as if they had biological reality. He even derives various curves based on this belief. In all fairness, Raup is not alone in falling into this systematic trap. We have become aware of this problem only recently and are only now seeing what implications it will have for studies such as this one. Although I disagree with Raup on the importance of impacts as a cause of ex? tinction and am concerned by his lack of appreciation of the role of systematics in the study of extinction, I find his treatment of the general subject engaging. This book, which is gauged for the nonspecialist, is well worth reading.?/. David Archibald, Biology, San Diego State University</page></plain_text>
