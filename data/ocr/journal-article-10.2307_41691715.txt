<plain_text><page sequence="1">FOLKLORE IN SANSKRIT LITERATURE By Sures Chandra banerji Folklore in Sanskrit is virtually an untrodden field of study. Folklore has been studied in many other literatures, e. g. English, Bengali, etc. It is our object to make a survey of this subject in Sanskrit starting from the Vedic age. Within the limited compass of this paper it is not possible to give an exhaustive account. We shall, therefore, set forth an outline of the subject. For the sake of convenience, we shall discuss the matter under the following heads : Economic life, crimes, vices and punishments, popular beliefs and practices, popular cults and creeds, food, drink, dress and ornaments, popular amusements, ideas, manners and customs, sex-life and morality, position of Südras and other low-class people, riddles, proverbs and popular maxims. Economic Life Agriculture appears to have been the principal occupation of the Vedic people. The word panca krsti (RV. IV. 38. 10) probably means the rotation of five crops in the same field or the growing of five kinds of crops in different fields. The fact that the word krsti in the RV. denotes people in general perhaps implies that they were by and large agriculturists. Besides cultivators, we find, in the Vedic society, various other pro- fessionals, e. g. carpenter, goldsmith, weaver, and so on. The chariot-maker and the metal-worker are also known. To agriculture and various crops there are many references in the AV. too. Both the Vedas know irrigation canals. Among various occupations in the YV., mention is made of Magadha (minstrel), Sailüsa (actor), Süta (panegyrist), Pesitã (image- maker), Carmãra (tanner), Vamkinartin (pole-dancer), etc. Of agriculture as the chief occupation, there are many evidences in the Brãhmanas (e. g. Šatapatha, 1.6.1.3,7.2.2.6, etc.). This Brãhmana distinguishes two kinds of plants, viz. grãmya-osadhi and äranya-osadhi. The importance of the cow in agriculture is mentioned in the Aitareya ( 7. 32.2 ) - iyam vai vasã prsnih; this cow is indeed the earth. At several places in the Šatapatha (e.g. 3.1.4.14,3.3.3.13, etc. ) cattle are stated to be the source of prosperity. Animals are of two kinds, grãmya ( rural) and ãranya ( wild ).</page><page sequence="2">446 ABORI : Diamond Jubilee Volume Besides the four castes, there are many sub-castes springing from the intermixture of the castes in the regular ( anuloma) and reverse ( pratiloma ) orders. Various occupations were designed to suit the mixed castes. Among the crafts, we find glass-work ( kãmsya ), weaving ( vãsa ), gold-work ( hiranya ), making chariot of mules ( ašvatari-ratha ). Among women, the common occupations were sewing, knitting, embroidery {pesa). Brick-making, snake-charming ( sarpa-vidyã ), bird catching are some of the occupations of this age. Metal-making, stone-cutting and wood-cutt- ing were known. Physicians, singers, dancers and instrument-players move about in the society. Potters ( kulãla ), boatmen and rope-makers are mentioned ( Šatapatha, 11. 8. 1. 1 ). The important position of artisans and craftsmen can be guessed from the fact that, without their participation, the coronation ceremony could not be complete. Among such people were Rathakãra „ Taksã ( carpenter ), etc. The following were the main articles of merchandise : embroidered cloth, wool, gold and silver ornaments, foodgrains, cattle, etc. References to the ocean (e.g. Taittiriya , 2.2.92, Šatapatha , 7.4.1.9), etc. seem to indicate familiarity not only with the sea, but also with sea-borne trade. Money-lenders ( kusldin ) are known (e. g. Šatapatha , 13.4.3.11 ). Cities and forts are referred to. Big roads are of two kinds, viz. Sruti or Rãjapatha (royal thoroughfare), Mahãpatha (national highway). Among means of transport, mention is made of chariots drawn by horses or mules, bullock-carts ( èakata ). Ferry boats ( Aitareya , 1. 3. 2 ) and large sea-going vessels ( sairãvati ) are mentioned ( Ibid. 629. 3/5). Various units of measurement, e. g. añguli ( finger ), aratni ( from wrist to elbow ), prädesa ( from top of the thumb to that of the index finger when those are stretched ), pãda, prakrama ( a stride of a man ), sapha ( cleft hoof), were in vogue. According to Kalpasütras, craftsmen had to work for the king gratis for one day; this was the tax in kind. They formed guilds recognised by the king. Fishing, hunting, dancing, etc. are mentioned. Liquor, agricultural appliances, poison, cooked food, etc. appear among commodities sold. Labourers and slaves were perhaps used as commercial commodities. The common crops were Y ava , Vrihi, Tila , Godhüma, Mãsa , Mudga, Kulattha. Sugarcane, cotton, etc. were also grown. Varieties of rice are mentioned by Panini.</page><page sequence="3">BANĚK!! : Folklore in Sanskrit Literature 447 Niska, Suvarrta , Kãrsãpana , etc. are mentioned among coins by Patafíjali. Dairy farming was a great business in the Rãmãyana age. Of the existence of mining and metallurgy in this age, there is no doubt; there are many references to the use of iron. Ivory-work is known. Among various occupations in the Mahãbhãrata age, there were the Sairandhra ( arranger of dress for rich people ), magic, wrestling. Two broad types of mortgage were known, viz. gopya (for custody) and bhogya ( for use ). Partnership business is mentioned in the Yãjria - valkya-smrti ( 1 1 . 22 ). Generally one-sixth of the agricultural produce had to be given as revenue. On foreign goods a road-cess was levied. Duty was imposed on exports and imports. Sale of meat and running restaurants were some of the means of livelihood mentioned by Kautilya. The king had to advance anugraha-rna ( Sabhã, 5. 78 ) for the pro- motion of agriculture. Ex-gratia payments were also made. Among the various arts and crafts, mentioned in the Kãdambari , are the following : hasti-siksã, šakuni-ruta ( art of reading the language of birds ), rati-tantra (art of love-making). Vimãna and khaga appear to have been aerial transports. There was arrangement for the treatment of cattle. Of the use of metals and metallurgy there is enough of evidence. Iron was widely used for making weapons of war, agricultural implements, etc. Jewels and pearls were used for decoration. Ivory-work was in vogue. Various parts of the animal body - skin, bone, etc. were used in making various articles. Wood-work was widely in vogue. There was architecture of various designs in rural and urban areas. Cloth-making was an impor- tant industry. Manu (IX. 413 ) seems to refer to slavery, áüdras were enslaved by Brãhmanas. Besides Šilpins , Manu refers to certain other classes of people, e. g. Kãrukas ( cooks, etc. ), Ätmopajivins (earning by physical labour), etc. A number of sub-castes is mentioned by him. Candãlas are stated to have lived outside villages. Female animals used to be lent out. Ancient Indian society was not free from poverty. It has been described by many poets and playwrightsT</page><page sequence="4">448 ABORI : Diamond Jubilee Volume A very touching picture of poverty is found in Cärudatta, described in the Mrcchakatika . Some of the Kofa-Kãvyas , e. g. Sadukti-Karnämrta , Subhãsitaratnakoéa , contain verses on poverty. Crimes , F/ces Punishments Drinking appears to have been a common vice throughout the ages. Cheats, pilferers, thieves, pick-pockets, robbers, marauders, etc. abounded in the society. Punishments ranged from simple reprimand to capital punishment. For certain crimes the Brãhmanas suffered the greatest penalty. Murdering a Brähmana was the gravest form of homicide. Aiding and abetting a crime were also punished. Perjury was a common offence. The sale or pledge of a minor was punishable offence. The practice of black magic was looked upon as a crime. Death-penalty was prescribed for murder. Sedition was a great offence. As regards theft, there seems to have been a regular science. Muladeva is traditionally associated with it; müla, perhaps, means roots with which the rites in connexion with theft were performed. Sometimes we hear of noble thieves who used to help people in distress. Popular beliefs and practices We meet with many popular beliefs and practices. There was a widespread belief in the existence of spirits of forests, trees, etc. Some demons in the form of beasts and birds are supposed to move about. A funeral place is believed to be a haunt of ghosts. Traces of totemism are found in the Rgvedic names of Kašyapa ( from Kacchapa ), Matsya and Aja tribes, and so on. Gotama, Vatsa are, perhaps, derived from go (cow) and vatsa (calf) respectively. Bad dreams were looked upon with horror, and for escape from them there were prayers. Human diseases were believed to be transferable to other creatures. People believed in rejuvenation effected by divine grace. There are references to rites and practices designed to bring people under control. Miracles like restoration of the eyes to the blind, cure of leprosy, etc. could be effected through divine favour. The Vrãtyas of the Veda appear to have been either non-Aryans causing disturbance to the Aryans or Aryans of the non-conformist type. We meet with Sišnadevas who were either phallus-worshippers or who indulged in sexual sports. There is a number of omens and portents. For example, the Kapifí- jala bird was believed to foretell future events. Pigeons were believed</page><page sequence="5">BANERJI : Folklore in Sanskrit Literature 449 to cause harm to men and cattle. The owl was regarded as Yama's messenger. Of sorcery, witchcraft and magic there is a lot in the Atharvaveda. Gandharvas were fond of music, dance and women. Moving in the forms of dogs, monkeys, etc. they were believed to cause mental restlessness, addiction to gambling, etc.; they used to devour sacrificial offerings. Some demons were believed to attack a bride and enjoy her. Curses were dreaded. Amulets for averting diseases and bringing good luck were widely used. Magic was common, and invaded the domain of even politics and medicine. There are incantations and rites to prevent snake-bite and coun- teract poison. Some rites were performed to ensure the safe delivery of babies. Subhagamkarana was meant for making one full of youthful charm. There are some processes for the forecast of future events. There were certain methods for examining the suitability of brides. The burial of certain articles at cross-roads was believed to cause destruction of enemies. It was extremely inauspicious for a man to be struck by evil birds. The priests in the AV. were believed to be capable of performing marvellous deeds. The premature appearance of the teeth of a child was taken to forebode danger to parents. The dead body was weighed to ascertain the quantity of the merit and sin of the person concerned. In the Pänigrahana ceremony, one desirous of sons only should seize only the thumb of the bride. The following happenings are supposed to portend bad luck and calamities for the householder : the post of a house putting forth shoot, beehive in a house, a pigeon flying into the house, etc. Certain superstitious practices are as follows. Certain formulas are prescribed for appeasing the anger of others. Certain magical rites are provided for guarding the wife against a paramour. Yawning and sneezing are some of the incidents calling for recitation of mantras . There are practices relating to witchcraft and those for counteracting them. The remnants of the food of the preceptor were believed to cure the pupil of diseases. Among superstitious practices are not to cross the rope with which a calf is tied, birds in a flock should not be counted. The throbbing of the eyes, arms, etc. was believed to indicate different effects. In war, the following were regarded as ominous : jackals, dropping of a torso, sight of a tawny emaciated male figure peeping into the house. Unnatural birth of animals, e. g. cow bearing ass, mongoose bringing forth mice, etc., reptile in 57 Annals [ D. J. ]</page><page sequence="6">450 ABORI : Diamond Jubilee Volume a kitchen, birds crying fearfully towards the sun, restlessness of mind - these are some of the evil signs. The directions looking pleasant, birds and beasts crying pleasantly, mind delighted without any reason - these are some of the good signs. The following are some of the things which, if seen in a dream, portend misfortune of various kinds : a monkey, plunging from a mountain top into cowdung-pool, speeding towards the south in an ass-cart, drying up of an ocean, withering of trees, etc. Breathing difficúlty, shaking of the body, loss of vitality or con. sciousness are some of the signs of a person possessed by evil spirits. The following physical marks of a woman were believed to be auspi- cious : fine, smooth, black, round legs without hair, closely set teeth, gradually rounded nails on fingers, plump breasts with deeply set nipples, deep navel, standing firm on soles and toe, etc. The following signs are good in a male : broad shoulders, long arms, conch-like neck, reddish eyes, hard thighs and wrist, long brows and scrotum, high navel, abdomen and breasts, long nose, spacious back, etc. The Mahãbhãrata refers to Šakuna-vidyá by which people could interpret good or bad signs. The sight of a peacock, swan, crane, etc. following a person, smoke- less fire spreading fume to the right, swan, parrot, etc. flying around a person, etc. are good signs. The cutting of a tree on the new moon day was inauspicious. The shaking of images of deities or their shedding tears was highly ominous. The Väyupuräna believes (69.271 ) that goblins haunt an empty house, a house for delivery of babies, and cremation grounds. The Kãlikã- puräna refers to the observance of Sabarotsava in Durgäpüjä. The very name suggests its intrusion from the Šabara tribe. It consists in smearing one another with mud, covering the body with leaves, and abusing one another. Black magic consisted of Stambhana ( paralysis ), Mohana ( causing illusion), Vafikarana (controlling), Uccãtana (expulsion), Mãrana ( killing ). These are included in Tãntric Abhicãra. Chapter 140 of the Agnipurãna mentions a number of herbs and drugs possessing mysterious power for making charms effective. The Arthaéãstra believes that certain evil spirits, causing trouble, can be appeased by goats. In the Kädambari , there are references to the burn- ing of sloughs of serpents and horns of rams, mixed with ghee, as auspicious. Vyãghranakha, set in gold and worn around the neck, was supposed to protect a child against the evil eye.</page><page sequence="7">BANERJI : Folklore in Sanskrit Literature 451 The Kathãsaritsãgara refers to magical spells enabling one to fly in the air. There are references to tree-worship. There is a popular belief of Yaksinis causing mischief. Human sacrifice appears to have been in vogue (vol. 1, p. 116). Certain charms were believed to cause change of sex. There is a reference to a man's capacity for understanding the language of birds and beasts. Since the Vedic age, people have been assuming the existence of gods not only behind natural phenomena, but also underlying many other things. Anthropomorphic and theriomorphic traits have been attributed to gods. Some deities have been imagined to cause panic, safe delivery of babies, rouse love in a girl, etc. Serpent-deities are well known. Krtyã and Nirrti are goddesses causing mischief. Rudra is the protector of thieves, slayer of serpents and demons, and healer of diseases. The mount of Rudra is ãkhu ( rat ) which destroys crops. In the Asvamedha sacrifice, the Chief Queen lies beside the slaughte- red horse with its genital organ inserted into hers; this is supposed to impart virility. In the Mahãvrata sacrifice, a student exchanges abusive language with a courtesan with whom he then performs sexual intercourse; this is a fertilising practice. In the Gosava sacrifice ( Jaiminiya-Brahmana , 2. 113) the sacrificer imitates the bulls' sexual activities, and has sexual intercourse with female relatives. Popular cults and creeds Of the various popular deities, emerging in the period of Kalpasütras, are Taksaka and Vaisaleya, both being serpent-gods. Síta is an agri- cultural deity. The cow is held in veneration, though cow-slaughter is mentioned in connexion with some rites. Among popular religious practices was Agrayana or offering of the first fruit of the season to the deity. From Pänini's rule jivikãrthe cãpanye (V. 3. 99), images of deities appear to have been used as means of livelihood as well as articles for sale. Panini mentions ( V. 2. 76 ) hypocritical ascetics who used to pierce their tongues or arms with iron spikes. Reference is made to Maskarin (VI. I.jl54) who was, perhaps, identical with Makkhali Gosãla, founder of the Ajivika sect. Nãstikas and Daistikas were annihilationists belonging to the materialistic school which is mentioned by Patanjali too. Krsna as a popular deity is mentioned by Patanjali (1.1.4). Besides Vaiçnavism, Šaivism appears to have been popular. Skanda, Laksmi and</page><page sequence="8">452 ABO RI : Diamond Jubilee Volume Suparní are other prominent deities. The concept of Bhakti got a fillip in this age. Animism is evidenced by the invocation of mountains, lakes, seasons, etc. Malevolent spirits, called bhütas , were worshipped. Every house was believed to have a presiding demoness. That heretics were common in the society is proved by the fact that the king engaged them as spies. Käpälikas ( Kathãsaritsãgara, IX, pp. 12-14, Tawney) are mentioned. Besides Buddhist Bhiksus, there were Jaina Arhatas in the society. Buddhist nuns as match-makers or go-betweens appear. The cult of Sasthi is referred to in the Harsacarita (p. 119-Kale); she presides over child- birth, and protects children throughout their lives. Tãntric modes of wor- ship, including human sacrifices, are mentioned. By waving the hand round the head evil spirits could be warded off. Food and Drink Barley appears to have been a staple food. Paddy, wheat, pulses and oilseeds are also mentioned. Ajya (ghee), Amiksä (curdled milk), Väjina (whey), karambha (porridge), sãnnãyya (mixture of curd and milk), ir ita ( boiled milk ), and sara ( cream ) were some of the articles of food. Among drinks is dadhimantha which, perhaps, denotes liquefied curd or clarified butter. Of the fruits, mango seems to have been common. Among vegetables were used karanja (red garlic), ïaûuna (garlic), kyãku (mushroom), palãndu (onion), grnjana (turnip), ílesmãtaka (a kind of fruit). There were also sãka , bhãjl ( cooked vegetables ), süpa ( broth ), upadamša ( things like radish to be munched ). Khãndava , phãnita ( sugarcane juice ), modaka are some of the sweet substances used as food. Surã, madhu , maireya are some of the intoxicating drinks. Kapisã- yana9 prepared from grapes, was another drink. There are references to Pänabhümi ( Ram. IV. 28. 34 ) or bar for drinks. As regards cooking, roasting on spit was practised. Among various kinds of meat is mentioned the meat of bulls. Fish appears to have been eaten ( RV. VII. 18. 6. ). The flesh of some birds was also eaten. The meat of five-toed animals of five kinds was allowed. Dress and Ornaments Men's garments included adhivastra (VIII. 26. 13), outer cover or veil, kurira ( X. 85. 8 ), head-dress ( ? ), and pratidhi ( VIII. 85. 8 ). There</page><page sequence="9">BAKER!! í Folklore in Sanskrit Literature 453 were inner covers and chest-covers too for women. In the AV. are mention- ed nivi ( underwear ), upavãsana ( veil ), vavri ( upper garment ), usnisa ( head-dress ), kumba , and tirita, the last two also perhaps denoting kinds of head-dress. Both cotton and wool were used as fibres; silk was also known. Baldness was hated. Its cure is prayed for. Various coiffures were known. Cosmetics and lac-dye were used as beautifying media by women. Among ornaments are mentioned rucaka ( necklace ), kataka , svastika ( ? ), kundala ( earring ), valaya ( bangle ), šamkha. Popular amusements Among popular amusements were dicing, gambling with dice, use of swings, dramatic performances, quizzical questions, entertainment by gestures, hunting, fowling, music, vocal and instrumental, and horse-race. Instruments like Vinä and Dundubhi are mentioned. Wrestling, boxing, playing with weapons, etc. were practised. Angling was a pastime. Fire- work was a means of diversion. Roaming in parks, elephant and horse- riding, etc. were other means of entertainment. A popular festival was Indradhvaja performed in the harvesting season. Samãja and gosthi appear to have been like modern clubs. Ball-play ( kanduka-kridä ) and jalakridã were known. Fairs appear to have been organised in the festivals of deities. Young people used to play with Vita which means either a wooden piece or a ball. The Arthaúãsira speaks of Yãtrã. It also mentions Plavaka ( acrobat ), Kuhaka ( juggler ), Šaubhika ( organiser of dramatic shows ), etc. Ideas , manners and customs As regards the dead, it was believed that a sinner would sink into an abyss ( vavra ). Svayamvara was a common form of marriage. Intercaste marriage even in the reverse order was in vogue. There is reference to the custom of placing a boy on the lap of the bride; this was believed to ensure the birth of a male child. Sex-life Since the Vedic times, irregular sex-relations have been found. Incest, abortion, giving birth to illegitimate children are some other crimes. Bhrüna - hatyã was a common crime. Forcible marriage was in vogue. Prosti- tution appears throughout the ages in India. Raising issues by levirate was prevalent. Südras and other low-class people Panis and Dãsas figure in the RV. The former were perhaps a non- Aryan tribe engaged in causing mischief to the Aryans. The Dãsas were also</page><page sequence="10">454 ABORl : Diamond Jubilee Volume powerful non-Aryans, causing similar trouble. They were engaged in agri- culture. Šudras were called by this designation. They were neither untou- chable nor slaves. Nicya and Apãcya were the designations of some low class people beyond the caste-system. Certain other outcastes were Andhra , Pundra , Šabara, Pulinda , Mütiba , etc. Castes were not strictly hereditary. From the story of Ailüsa Kavasa ( Aitareya , 2. 8. 1 ) we learn that Kavasa, a bastard, by means of enlightenment, became an object of veneration even to the highest class. Despite discriminatory treatment against ŠOdras, their merit was recognised and respected. Salutary advice could be accepted even from a Candäla , as enjoined by Manu. Riddles , proverbs and popular maxims As stated above, riddles were a favourite pastime. These related to many things, viz. theology, common life, etc. A number of proverbs shows the people's experience of life in various spheres. The same remark may be made about popular maxims. Various works, even those of a technical nature, use various folk- elements in illustrating different matters. REFERENCES Agrawala, V. : India as known to Pãnini .
