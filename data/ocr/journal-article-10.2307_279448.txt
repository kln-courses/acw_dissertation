EUROPE SPAIN. A new, evidently rather old, pebble tool site, considered to be Lower Pleistocene in age, was sounded near Puerto de Santa Maria (Cadiz) by A. Querol (Museo Arqueolo6gico Nacional, Madrid) and Cl. Thibault (University of Bordeaux). Because of construction work planned in the area, a salvage excavation had to be undertaken, under the direction of E. Aguirre (Instituto Lucas Mallada, Madrid), in the well-known site of Ambrono, which dates to the Mindel stage of the classical Alpine se- quence and is connected with an industry of the Lower Acheulean. In the Caldas-Cave (Asturias) Sra. Corch6n (Uni- versity of Salamanca) continued the excavation begun the year before in sediments of Upper Pleistocene age, which yielded archaeological and paleontological data still to be studied in detail. FRANCE. H. de Lumley (Faculty of Science in Marseille) continued his work in the Acheulian and Tayacian horizons at the cave of Arago in the Pyren6es. These horizons date to the older Riss stage of the Alpine sequence, and human remains belonging to this stage were found here some years ago. H. de Lumley also continued his excavations in the Grotte du Lazaret in Nice, discovering more remains from Acheulean levels that correspond to Late Riss. The most important observation in these levels was a living floor with fireplaces and accumulated remains that are interpreted as traces of a tentlike construction. These are the oldest documented living quarters in a cave thus far published in detail. A. Tavaso (Faculty of Science in Marseille) worked in the Cave of Tournal (Bize) in a sequence beginning with Mousterian and reaching into Upper Paleolithic, correlated with Wiirm II, III, and IV (Middle and Up- per Wiirm of the Alpine sequence). A Mousterian com- plex (Wiirm II) was also found in the Abri de loton (Provence) by L. Meignen (Faculty of Science in Marseille). In southwestern France, F. Bordes (University of Bordeaux) has continued excavations in the well- known site of Pech-de-l'Az6 IV, in levels dating to the Older Wirm and yielding different Mousterian inven- tories. Work in the Abri Vaufrey (Vallee du C6ou) in the Acheulean and Mousterian levels was carried on by J. Ph. Rigaud (University of Bordeaux), who is keep- ing a continuous record of the actual local climate near the site to collect relative data for climatic inter- pretation. Rigaud also excavated in Abri du Flageolet I (Vallee de la Dordogne), from which remains of the Aurignacian and Upper Perigordian are reported, cor- responding to Wiirm III. In Abri du Flageolet II, there are traces of Upper Magdalenian (WOrm IV). G. C1ee6rier (University of Bordeaux) excavated in Abri du Pont d'Ambon (Vall6e de Dronne), which has levels running from the end of the Late Pleistocene through Upper Magdalenian and Azilian. Remains of the Upper Magdalenian have also been reported from the Abri de la Naison Forte de Reignac in the Vezere Valley by A. Roussot (University of Bordeaux). 499</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY G. Guichard reexcavated the Solutrean levels from Laugerie-Haute Est. An open-air site at Solvieux, yield- ing traces of Aurignacian, Upper Perigordian, and Lower Magdalenian was further excavated by James Sackett (University of California). Abri de la Madeleine (Vallee de Vezere), the type site of the Mag- dalenian, was also reexcavated by J. M. Bouvier (Uni- versity of Bordeaux/Archaeological Survey) who re- ports finds in Magdalenian IV, V, and VI. H. Delporte continued the reexcavation of the classic site of Ferrassie, with its famous stratigraphy, working in the Mousterian, Lower Perigordian, Aurignacian, and Up- per Perigordian levels. More work in France was done by A. Leroi- Gourhan and M. N. Br6zillion (Musee de l'Homme/ College de France) in the well-reported site of Pince- vent, with its well-preserved living floors and tent re- mains from the Magdalenian, making it possible to re- construct numerous details of human activities. Y. Taborin (Musee de l'Homme) continued work with Magdalenian remains at Etiolles, as did B. Schneider (Mus6e de l'Homme) at Nemours, in a site yielding Perigordian and Magdalenian, and M. Orliac (Musee de l'Homme) in La Tourasse, where Magdalenian and Azilian remains were discovered. Allain (Archaeo- logical Survey of the Paris Region) did further work in the Abri Fritsch (Solutrean and Magdalenian), in St. Marcel (Magdalenian), and in Cepoy (Magdalenian). ENGLAND. New work by Ronald Singer and John Wymer (University of Chicago) at Clacton-on-Sea, Essex (1969-1970) proved the golf-course site to be the oldest dated site yielding a Clactonian industry definitely distinct from the Acheulean hand-axe com- plexes. Further work by the same excavators in Hoxne (1971-1973) exposed large areas of Interglacial lake beds with Acheulean artifacts, bones of hunted animals, and wood in situ. This site clearly belongs in the Hoxnian Interglacial (probably identical with the Holsteinian) and is younger than the golf-course site at Clacton-on-Sea. WEST GERMANY. Work was continued by G. Bosinski (University of Cologne) in the open-air site of Gonnersdorf near Neuss, providing more data on the Magdalenian occupation with dwelling remains, art ob- jects, and the bones of hunted animals. H. Thieme (University of Cologne) continued work in the loess site of Rheindahlen (Nordrhein-Westfalen) on a living floor (East section) dated to the Riss by K. Brunnacker. J. Hahn (University of Tiibingen) went on with the excavation in the Aurignacian loess site of Lom- mersum (near Bonn). New work was also done at the Middle Paleolithic site of Rohrshain near Ziegenhain (northern Hessen) by J. Hahn and I. Campen, col- lecting new data from the quartzite quarry site known there for more than 20 years and dated to Middle Wuiirm (Upper Pleistocene). W. Taute (University of Tiibingen) closed the excavation in the Zigeunerfels near Sigmaringen, in which a well-spread succession from later Magdalenian to lower Mesolithic in at least six different horizons can be documented. G. Freund (University of Erlangen) continued work at the multilevel site of Sesselfelsgrotte in the Altmuhltal near Neuessingen. The site has a sequence of Mousterian and Micoquian industries of Upper Pleistocene (Middle Wiirm) age. SWITZERLAND. A surprisingly rich Magdalenian site was excavated by James H. Barr (Archaeological Survey of Solothurn) in the Rislisberg cave near Balsthal (Canton of Solothum). The site has produced more than 20,000 stone artifacts, over 50,000 pieces of animal remains, about 100 bone tools, and an en- graved bone art object. HANSJURGEN MULLER-BECK AFRICA SOUTHERN AFRICA BOTSWANA. J. E. Yellen (Peabody Museum) has completed the study of recently abandoned ! Kung Bushman campsites from the Dobe area. Surface plan analysis reveals that between-site variability is partly caused by subsistence and manufacturing activity. The archaeological distinction between maintenance and work camps cannot be applied. Intrasite clustering of artifacts and food waste correlates well with nuclear family units. L. Lepianka (National Museum, Gaberones) has completed excavations at the Iron Age site of Tautsue- magale, a hilltop site with two long occupation phases. The ceramics now being subjected to statistical analysis show affinities with Leopard's Kopje, in Rhodesia, and Mapungubwe, in the Transvaal. E. Voigt (Transvaal Museum) assisted in the National Museum project. Preliminary investigations of another Iron Age settlement at Motsenekuatse have been reported by R. Pahl. Further reports of rock painting discoveries come from C. K. Cooke (National Museum, Bulawayo) and A. Campbell (National Museum, Gaberones), who ex- plored the Savuti area. N. J. Walker (National Museum, Bulawayo) is studying a Later Stone Age open site at Gweta, and C. K. Cooke is examining early collections. LESOTHO. P. L. Carter and P. Vinnicombe (Cam- bridge, England) plan to start excavations at Melikane cave in the northwest highlands in June 1974. Their rock painting survey will be extended to the Upper Orange River valley where early European penetration is well-documented. Analysis of the vast collection of rock painting records from the Northeast is still underway by L. Smits (University of Lesotho, Botswana and Swazi- land). MALAWI. K. Robinson (National Museum, Bula- wayo) is writing up the results of a long-term project on the Iron Age of the Upper and Lower Shire and the Dedza district. B. Sandelowsky-Pendleton (Windhoek Museum) was awarded a Ph.D. for her dissertation on Later Stone Age excavations and analysis from Malawi. MOZAMBIQUE. N. van der Merwe (University of Cape Town) has received permission to conduct field- work in southern Mozambique and seeks colleagues interested in collaborating in a survey of this vast and totally unexplored area. REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA. Important meet- ings during 1973 included a conference on the history 500 [Vol. 39, No. 3, 1974</page><page sequence="3">CURRENT RESEARCH of the Transkei and Ciskei held at Grahamstown. Here it was resolved that an African Studies Association be formed to promote multidisciplinary research in the Iron Age. Another major Iron Age conference, entitled "The Last 2000 Years in South Africa," took place at the University of Witwatersrand at the end of 1972, and a symposium on Ancient Mining was held in late 1973. A combined conference of the South African Society for Quaternary Research and the South African Association of Archaeologists was held at the Transvaal Museum, Pretoria. Several papers were also presented in Section F of the 71st Congress of the South African Association for the Advancement of Science (University of Pretoria). Fieldwork remains concentrated on Stone Age caves in the southern and southwestern Cape Province and on Iron Age sites in the Transvaal and Natal, with very little research in intervening areas. The Orange Free State and northwestern Cape await serious ex- ploration. Several major projects continue in the southwest and southern Cape coastal belt. Research is concen- trated on problems of subsistence activities, ecological adaptations and relationships between coastal and montane sites during the so-called Later and Middle Stone Ages. Typological definitions of lithic industries remain vague, and some industries described in the classic literature of this area, particularly the so-called "Stillbay," remain elusive. It is now generally accepted that most samples of the Howiesonspoort industry are of similar radiocarbon age to the very earliest Upper Palaeolithic of Europe and the Near East. Apart from the Robberg industry, dated to about 20,000 years ago, and the Oakhurst industry, which persisted from about 15,000 to 8,000 years ago, no other industries coeval with the Upper Palaeolithic complex of Europe have yet been discovered. The long-term project on Klasie's River Mouth is being prepared for publication by J. Wymer and R. Singer (University of Chicago). Sedimentological studies have been directed by K. Butzer (University of Chicago). Molluscan analysis by E. Voigt (Transvaal Museum) and oxygen-isotope temperature studies of molluscs by N. Shackleton (University of Cambridge) have been completed. These combined results suggest that the earliest quartzite blade industry (compare the Mossel Bay industry) belongs to a final stage of the Last Interglacial and, therefore, predates the Mouster- ian complex of Europe and the Near East. Work on the Nelson Bay Cave material continues. The important sequence of lithic industries (Howies- onspoort, Robberg, Oakhurst, Wilton) is being analyzed by J. Deacon (University of Stellenbosch) and the mammalian fauna has been reported by the excavator, R. Klein (University of Chicago), who is currently excavating and analyzing faunal remains from an Upper Pleistocene coastal site at Melkbos. Dense pockets of bone plus an exceptionally high carnivore count suggest the presence of hyena lairs, coprolites of which have also been discovered. Ab- sence of Cape fur seal, usually present at coastal sites, suggests a lowered and distant shoreline presumably dating to the last glacial. Rare Middle Stone Age arti- facts occur with the bones. This carnivore-derived assemblage will be compared with the Middle Stone Age floor nearby and with the bone midden from the Sea Harvest at Saldanaha also being excavated by Klein. J. Parkington (University of Cape Town) and col- laborators have completed the vast faunal analysis (birds, fish, mollusks, mammals) from Eland's Bay Cave which duplicates the Nelson Bay Cave sequence of industries. His analysis will be integrated with re- sults from De Hangen shelter, Klipfonteinrand, and Diepkloof, in an attempt to define subsistence strate- gies between the mouths of the Berg and Olifants River. Radiocarbon dates confirm the presence of domestic sheep in the ninth century A.D. Sheep have been reported from the coastal cave of Die Kelders at A.D. 100 by F. Schwietzer (South African Museum), who reports that domestic cattle have been identified also from the same layer. Excava- tions at Byneskranskop about five kilometers inland from Die Kelders provide a deep sequence of Later Stone Age deposits absent from the coastal site. M. Taylor (University of Witwatersrand) has surveyed coastal shell middens to determine settle- ment patterns on the west coast between the Berg River Mouth and Doringbaai, while G. Avery (S. African Museum) continues a similar study along the south coast. Several hut circles and hearths have been located in middens at Pearly Beach. H. and J. Deacon (University of Stellenbosch) com- menced exploratory excavations in caves near Oudt- shoorn in the eastern Cape Province. A sequence of industries beginning with the Robberg industry has been recovered. In the northern Cape, J. Rudner (S. African Muse- um) is analyzing non-Bantu ceramics and plans to survey rock paintings in the previously unexplored Carnarvon district. A. Humphreys (McGregor Museum) is excavating a Later Stone Age sequence at Dikbosch and several other shelters along the Kaap Plateau escarpment west of Kimberley. Middle Stone Age surface collections from Riverton have also been reported. Humphreys and K. Butzer (University of Chicago) intend a col- laborative study of the Alexandersfontein pan which contains a series of ancient shorelines with associated Middle Stone Age material. In the eastern Cape, M. Brooker (University of Stellenbosch) is analyzing material from Uniondale shelter; this contains Oak- hurst and Wilton sequences. Preliminary reports of field surveys and excava- tions of hitherto poorly explored areas of the Ciskei and Transkei have been produced by R. Derricourt (National Museum, Zambia). Sites of the Smithfield Industry at Ann Shaw and Oakleigh Farm produced cattle bones, suggesting the possible presence of a pastoralist community. M. Brooker (University of Stellenbosch) has com- pleted her salvage project from the Welbedacht Dam on the Caledon River in the Southeastern Orange Free State. Records of rock paintings and Iron Age ruins as well as three excavated Later Stone Age rock shelters have been reported. G. Sampson (Southern Methodist University) mapped a series of caves in the Little Caledon valley in preparation for a longterm field project in the Eastern Orange Free State. 501</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY In Natal, J. Parkington (University of Cape Town) is excavating Dingaans Kraal, the historical site of the headquarters of the Paramount Chief of the Zulus. T. Maggs (Pietersmaritzsburg Museum) is excavating Iron Age sites in the Muden area and is working out a ceramic sequence for the Central Natal. 0. Davis (Pietersmaritzsburg Museum) continues the survey of raised shorelines and associated Acheul- ian artifacts along the Northern coast. His Iron Age excavations include two walled hilltop sites near Estcourt dated to the thirteenth century. Analysis of the plant remains from his excavations at Shongweni Cave has revealed that three species of cultivated cereal and two curcubits were present in Southern Natal at an unexpectedly early date. Further dates are being run to confirm these readings. Fieldwork in the Transvaal has focused on Iron Age surveys and australopithecine sites with little work in Stone Age research. R. Mason (University of Witwatersrand) has been excavating stone-walled Iron Age sites at Olifants- poort, Platberg, Badfontein, and Harmony. Near-total horizontal exposure of one of these has revealed six adjacent unwalled village sites of presumably earlier periods. Dates cover the periods from A.D. 1200 to A.D. 1500. A team of specialists is now at work on the excavated materials. In the eastern Transvaal near Tzaneen, excavations have also taken place at a soap- stone bowl factory, a ventilated copper mine, and a salt-making site. A complete early Iron Age village has also been excavated at the Hartebeespoort Dam area west of Pretoria. The long-term Iron Age survey of the Phalabora in the eastern Transvaal under N. van der Merwe (Uni- versity of Cape Town) continues in the tribal territory of the Venda, Sotho, and Shangane nations. Ethno- graphic studies are to be conducted, and a feasibility study for dendrochronology is underway by W. Weak- ly (SUNY, Binghampton). M. Evers (University of Witwatersrand) is surveying Iron Age sites in the Crocodile, Elands, and Komati River basins. He has also excavated at Harmony copper mine, Eiland, and Arbeilkop in the Northeast and has started a preliminary study of eastern Trans- vaal caves. Faunal remains, particularly cattle bones, from Iron Age sites in the Transvaal are the subject of a special study by R. Welbourne (University of Wit- watersrand). Bones from the Phalabora project are being analyzed by B. M. Fagen (University of Cali- fornia, Santa Barbara). Another specialized study is being conducted by U. Kusel (Provincial Museum Service) on Iron Age metal smelting techniques. This includes ethnological studies of Venda and Shona iron smelting techniques and slag analysis from archaeo- logical sites. Experimental furnace smelting is under way, and prehistoric furnace excavations are planned. P. Beaumont (Bernard Price Institute of Palaeon- tology) has conducted test excavations at Heuning- sneskraal shelter and has located a Later Stone Age sequence. Two as yet unnamed industries which precede the Oakhurst complex have been exposed as this important site which was first occupied about 30,000 years ago. Work proceeds slowly on the australopithecine sites. A. Hughes and P. V. Tobias (University of Wit- watersrand) continue the reworking of dump material and newly exposed breccia from Sterkfontein and intend to reopen work at Makapan. A. Mann (Univer- sity of Pennsylvania) plans to reopen the long-ne- glected Kromdraai locality. T. Partridge has analyzed the geomorphological dating of cavern openings at four of the australopithecine sites and has concluded that Taung is the youngest, not the oldest of them all. This would imply that the infant type specimen of Australopithecus africanus, is, in fact, a later robust australopithecine. Since this revised dating claim con- tradicts the faunal evidence, it remains uncertain whether the new chronological scheme will gain gener- al acceptance. At Swartkrans, C. K. Brain (Transvaal Museum) continues the clearance and mapping of the lower cavern. A possibly complete A. robustus face has been discovered and bone breccia is also known to be present in the still untouched lower cavern. RHODESIA. E. Voigt (Transvaal Museum) con- tinues her typological analysis of the Pomongwan, Khami, and Pfupian industries of Matabeleland. Using a standardized typology, this will be the first control- led comparison of Later Stone Age materials exca- vated in the last two decades. N. Walker (National Museum, Bulawayo) is exca- vating at Shashabukwe shelter in the Matopos Hills. A full sequence of Middle and Later Stone Age industries is being recovered. Analysis of the Wilton-related material from Mtanye shelter in the Gwanda area is nearing completion. T. N. Huffman (National Museum, Bulawayo) has extended excavations at the late Iron Age site of Chamabvepa (Khami) ruins, and has completed exca- vations at Lanbory Farm near Karoi. In addition, a detailed chronology for his Leopard's Kopje excava- tions has been prepared. Dates span the period from A.D. 700 to A.D. 1700. Other Iron Age research nearing completion in- cludes the excavation of Lekkerwater Ruins by S. Rudd (Salisbury). The ruins are contemporary with the later phases of the Zimbabwe complex. F. Bern- hard (Umtali) has completed work at Murahwa Hill, a very late ruin contemporary with the Khami complex. P. Garlake (University of Ife) has also completed fieldwork at Felixburg (Gokomere phase), Mukwiebi River, Urungwe area, and Nhunguza River, Bindura, related to the late phases of the Zimbabwe complex. Work at similar ruins at Ruanga has also been com- pleted. C. K. Cook (National Museum, Bulawayo) con- tinues the lithic analysis of Zombepata cave and re- ports a series of dates from here and the important new site of Duncombe Farm Shelter confirming the earlier sequence of readings for the deep Stone Age sequence at Pomongwe. Of particular interest is the evidence that the Tshangula (Rhodesian Magosian) dates to about 19,000 years ago, at least 20,000 years younger than its presumed contemporary, the Howie- sonspoort from South Africa. SOUTH WEST AFRICA. E. Wendt (University of Hamburg) plans to return to the Fish River Canyon area to continue excavations of a series of rockshelters yielding Wilton-related materials. J. Rudner (South African Museum) is analyzing non-Buntu ceramics 502 [Vol. 39, No. 3, 1974</page><page sequence="5">CURRENT RESEARCH from excavated and surface contexts. B. Sandelowsky is exploring Later Stone Age site distributions in the Namib Desert. ZAMBIA. Iron Age research in the Upper Zambezi valley continues under J. 0. Vogel (National Museum). Excavations are completed at Sioma, an early Iron Age village belonging to an hitherto unknown ceramic group. In the Maramba valley, sites at Musya belonging to three consecutive periods have been excavated: Dambwa, Kalamo, and Sekute. Further excavations in the early Iron Age cemetery at Chiendu have yielded additional grave goods. Preliminary testing has also been completed at Zambezi Farm, Siamatabolo, Kabondo, Kumbo, Linda, Mujala, and Njanji. K. Savage (University of California, Berkeley) is reexcavating the Wilton and Tshangula levels at Mumbwa. Related materials from earlier excavations at Kamusongolwa and Chambabulele are being ana- lyzed. B. M. Fagen (University of California, Santa Barbara) is writing up excavations from Namwala and other Iron Age mounds from southern Zambia. Investigations of the early copper mining industry in northern Zambia are being written up by M. Bisson (University of California, Santa Barbara). The copper workings at Kansashi Hill are now dated to about A.D. 1600 and the adjacent smelting area contained four different ceramic assemblages, two of which date as early as A.D. 400. The Kipushi copper workings are very much later, about A.D. 1300. Clay moulds of copper crosses resemble those from Ingombe Ilede on the middle Zambezi valley. R. Klein (University of Chicago) has reevaluated the faunal remains associated with the Broken Hill hominid and concludes that it is of late Acheulian age, probably equivalent to the fauna of Bed IV at Olduvai Gorge. This is considerably older than suggested in previous literature. R. Derricourt (National Monuments Commission) has begun a survey of Iron Age sites in the Luapula and Northern Provinces. EAST AFRICA ETHIOPIA. N. Chittick (British Institute, Nairobi), will continue to direct excavations at Aksum. The large stelae are now thought to be of the Christian period, and a large monument with underground chambers is being excavated. A team under F. Anfray (Mission franco-6thio- pienne) continues to work at the pre-Aksumite ruins at Yeha in the Tigr6 province. A large stone temple is provisionally dated to about 1400 B.C. on the basis of inscriptions. Very rich tombs have been excavated, work continues in adjacent ruins, and the complex architecture history of the site remains to be worked out. Two other ruins have been located west of Aksum at Enda-Abha-Brouh and Biet Qorqos. C. Johanson (Case Western Reserve University) has recovered limb bones of two australopithecines from a Plio/Pleistocene faunal locality near Dessie in Wallo Province. Another team, under J. D. Clark (University of California, Berkeley), will begin a two-year program in the southern Afar and the northern part of the Harar plateau to investigate the earliest appearance of agri- culture in this area and its relationship to changes in environment and settlement patterns. D. Phillipson (British Institute, Nairobi), is exca- vating rock shelters containing Later Stone Age mate- rial in the vicinity of Aksum. F. Wendorf (Southern Methodist University) will lead another expedition to central and southern Ethiopia to survey and excavate Middle and Later Stone Age localities. KENYA. R. Gramly (Harvard University), reports the discovery of a human skull cap from a rockshelter at Lukenya Hill associated with an unidentified blade and burin industry dated to about 18,000 years ago. It is the first reported occurrence of material dated to this still poorly understood period of sub-Saharan pre- history. Multidisciplinary fieldwork continues in the rich area East of Lake Rudolf under G. Isaac (University of California, Berkeley) whose team continues the slow development of early hominid living floors. Both Potassium-Argon and Paleomagnetic dating now con- firm the presence of a "KBS industry" (provisional name) older than 2.4 million years. Later beds con- taining a "Karari industry" date to about 1.5 million years ago and are broadly coeval with the wealth of hominid fossils already reported as Homo and Paran- thropus by R. Leakey (Coryndon Museum). Typo- logical studies of the lithic assemblages are underway by J. Harris (University of California, Berkeley). Taphonomic studies and analysis of Late Stone Age fauna is being continued by D. Gifford (University of California, Berkeley). N. Chittick (British Institute, Nairobi) has com- pleted a two-volume work on his excavations at Kilwa and J. Sutton is finishing a volume on the western highlands of Kenya. The Iron Age settlement of Hyrax Hill is under- going reexcavation by J. Onyango (University of California, Berkeley). SUDAN. A field team directed by J. D. Clark (Uni- versity of California, Berkeley) has excavated two sites on the Upper Nile south of Khartoum. Jebel Tomat yielded animal and plant remains of seasonally nomadic pastoralists culturally related to Jebel Moya, a local complex which survived from the second mil- lennium B.C. into Meroitic times. Shabona yielded an Early Khartoum industry produced by hunter-gather- ers exploiting the banks of the Nile, probably two or three millennia earlier in date. P. S. Shinnie (University of Calgary) has completed the analysis of ceramics from Meroe. Several wares are now recognized as chronological indicators and more radiocarbon dates are awaited. The earliest levels con- tain wares similar to those of Pharaonic Egypt to- gether with local designs. The earliest evidence for iron smelting occurs at about 500 B.C. A. Hakem (University of Khartoum) is directing a survey between Shaheinab and Wadi Saydna to investi- gate Neolithic and later settlement patterns. A second survey of early Neolithic and Iron Age sites is being conducted in the potentially important but little ex- plored region of Darfur. Major projects continue at Kadaro under L. Krzyzaniah (University of Warsaw) at Geili under Prof. Puglisi (Italian Expedition), at Gebel Mora under H. 503</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Ziegert (University of Hamburg), at the Island of Sai under J. Vercoutter (French Expedition), and in Batn al Haggar under M. Vila (Antiquities Service Survey). Mrs. Haaland (University of Khartoum) is preparing a review of Neolithic sites in the central Sudan. TANZANIA. A study of the abandoned field sys- tems and irrigation works at Engaruka and related sites is being written up by J. Sutton (British Institute, Nairobi). The Manyora and Engaruka Basins in northern Tanzania have been surveyed by C. M. Keller (Univer- sity of Illinois, Urbana). Faunal and palynological re- mains are present in earlier lacustrine deposits and several Middle and Later Stone Age occurrences are reported. Preparation of the final monograph on the Isimila Acheulian site in southern Tanzania is still underway by G. Cole (University of Chicago) and M. Kleindienst (Field Museum, Chicago). A uranium-series date of 260,000 yr on the lower member of the sequence raises the possibility that the Acheulian in the upper member is older than previously supposed. The case for stylistic and quantitative changes in the Acheulian sequence here may be a factor of changing raw materi- al availability as the local basin silted up. Work at late Acheulian localities in Olduvai Bed IV continues under the direction of M. Leakey (Coryn- don Museum), and J. Bower (Lake Forest College) will continue attribute analysis of Oldowan and Acheulian tool categories from Beds I and II. Amini Mtusi (Department of Antiquities) is exca- vating Neolithic and Later Stone Age sites in Ngororo and Ndutu. These include cairns associated with the stone bowl complex. UGANDA. Material recovered from the Islands of Buvuma and Bugaia in Lake Victoria Nyanza in 1968 have been reported by J. Nenquin (University of Ghent). Tonge Cave and Munyama Cave yielded Later Stone Age material, the latter covering a period bracketed by radiocarbon dates between 15,000 and 8000 years ago. CENTRAL AFRICA REPUBLIC OF ZAIRE. Three studies have been successfully completed by doctoral candidates at the University of Ghent. M. Celis has analyzed the polish- ed axes and adzes from Ubangi, Lower Zaire, Kasai, Shaba, and Ituri. A. Herin has conducted a typological analysis of pottery recovered from six caves in the Bushimaie valley. An early Christian cemetery at Mbanza Mbata, Lower Zaire has been analyzed by M. Vandenhoute. NORTH AFRICA ALGERIA. D. Lubell (University of Alberta) has directed excavations at Capsian sites in the Cheria region south of Tebessa. Snail heaps are located around deposits indicating marshy conditions. The Upper Capsian mound at Misteteyia was excavated to expose occupational surfaces and apparent structures. Analysis of the cultural, faunal, and floral remains are underway as well as a regional study of the modern snail fauna. E. Saxon (University of Cambridge) is excavating at an epi-Palaeolithic site on the Algerian coast. UNITED ARAB REPUBLIC. R. Heizer, F. Stross, (University of California, Berkeley), and T. R. Hester (University of Texas-San Antonio) continued analysis of ancient heavy transport data obtained during field research in Upper Egypt during 1971 and 1972. Studies have been focused on geologic source identifi- cation of quartzite used in New Kingdom sculptures and monuments, particularly the source of quartize utilized for the Colossi of Memnon, 720-ton monoliths on the western plain of Thebes. J. Plumley (University of Cambridge) continues to direct excavations at Qasr Ibrim on the shore of Lake Nasser. The past season's work has concentrated on stone houses dated to the X-group period. An early Christian church-temple was also discovered, as well as a papyrus scroll in Arabic from the Governor of Egypt to the King of the Nubians containing details of the Baqt treaty of A.D. 652, no actual copies of which have survived in previously known scrolls. F. Wendorf (Southern Methodist University) has conducted a further season's work in the Bir Sahara oasis and the Dakhla area. Palaeolithic localities with organic associations discovered during the previous year's expedition were excavated. Of particular interest was the discovery of an Aterian locality asso- ciated with large quantities of fish remains. Fossil spring vents packed with uniformly shaped Acheulian handaxes were also a feature of this area. WEST AFRICA GHANA. A survey of iron-smelting techniques in the Upper and Volta Regions is being conducted by L. M. Pole (Ghana Museum). Complete reconstructions of the procedures and timing have been recorded in Lawra, Tiza, Jipisi, Chiana, Zanlerigu, and Garu. B. Priddy (Ghana Museum) is carrying out a similar study of pottery-making techniques. A preliminary investigation of an early cemetery at Obo has been reported by E. K. Agorsah, but no sys- tematic excavations have yet taken place. B. Wai-Ogosu (University of California, Berkeley) and Miss Nygaard (University of Ghana) have exca- vated test pits into a series of raised beaches at Asokrochana, to confirm the Acheulian-Sangoan se- quence previously claimed by Davies. Only surface material was recovered, the pits being sterile. C. Flight and P. Rahtz (University of Birmingham) have reported the discovery of a quern factory near Kintampo. R. Mathewson (University of Ghana) has completed ceramic analysis from the Chuluwasi and Jimasangi River sites, and B. Swartz (Ball State Univer- sity) has finished the analysis of a stratified Later Stone Age sequence at Hohoe. IVORY COAST. R. Mauny has completed excava- tions at a series of shell mounds flanking lagoons in the Lower Ivory Coast. MALI. C. Flight (University of Birmingham) and C. Mora (Institut des Science Humaines, Mali) have re- opened excavations in the medieval cemetery of Gao at San6. Translations on the inscriptions on the tomb- stones are still to be undertaken. The town site adja- cent to the cemetery is scheduled for excavation next. 504 [Vol. 39, No. 3, 1974</page><page sequence="7">CURRENT RESEARCH A. Smith (University of Ghana) is conducting exca- vations at Karkarichinat. MAURETANIA. S. Robert continues the excava- tions at Tegdaust. NIGERIA. T. Shaw (University of Ibadn) has con- ducted a preliminary survey of the Niger delta. Testing of four Iron Age sites is planned. Work at the Experi- mental Archaeological Reserve (University of Ibadn) continues with studies of mud hut wall disintegration, ditch and earthwork weathering, soil movement, and weathering of organic metal objects. R. Soper (Univer- sity of Ibadn) will direct continuing excavations at Old Oyo. M. Meulemeester (University of Ghent) has com- pleted his analysis of material from his Iron Age exca- vations at Kororofa and several adjacent sites in the central Benue region. F. Willet has completed his classification of Ife pot- tery and is presently working on copper alloy casting technology, particularly on Ife and Benin brasses. The final monograph on excavations in Benin City is now in press. G. Connah (University of New England, Australia) is preparing a final report on the work at Daima and Bornu. Collaborators are needed to complete the ceramic analysis. C. GARTH SAMPSON ASIA WESTERN ASIA TURKEY. In southeastern Turkey, during the fall of 1972, Halet Cambel and Robert J. Braidwood di- rected the Joint Istanbul-Chicago Prehistoric Project in work at the 9000-year-old village of Cayonii. The architectural remains here are very complex and elaborate. There is evidence of domesticated food plants from the earliest levels to the end of the prehis- toric sequence, but the faunal material so far available indicates dog to be the only domesticate in the oldest horizons, with sheep and goat appearing later in the sequence. IRAQ. During December of 1972, the Oriental In- stitute resumed work at the ancient sacred city of Nippur in southern Iraq. The excavations are being carried out under the direction of McGuire Gibson. Besides uncovering the remains of Old Babylonian and Akkadian private houses, the project personnel have made collections of soil and latrine samples and are forming a comprehensive and detailed pottery corpus for the second and first millennia B.C. IRAN. Following two preliminary seasons (1971, 1972), the University Museum, University of Pennsyl- vania, is planning a continuing project of excavations at Tall-i-Malyan near Shiraz. Co-directors will be Robert H. Dyson, Jr. (University Museum) and Wil- liam M. Sumner (Ohio State University). So far, remains of three distinct periods have been excavated: the Banesh period (around 3000 B.C.), the Kaftari period (around 2000 B.C.), and a late second millennium occupation. Project objectives include: (1) recovery of ecological and settlement pattern data relevant to early urban life in this region; (2) investiga- tion of cultural diversity within the site; and (3) in- vestigation of gaps in the stratigraphic record as it is now known. ISRAEL. Beginning in October 1972, a joint Hebrew University-University of Illinois, Chicago Circle expedition has been surveying three areas in northern Sinai to elucidate relationships between the Nile Valley and the Palestinian region. James Phillips (University of Illinois, Chicago Circle) reports that surveyors in one of the three areas-a coastal strip from the Suez Canal to al-Arish-have discovered more than 500 sites, none earlier than late predynastic Egyptian (Gerzean). Inland, in the Jebal Mughara area, 35 sites were recorded ranging from Upper Paleolithic 3 through Aceramic Neolithic, with the majority being Epipaleolithic. An exchange network seems to have been operating here between Palestine and the Red Sea coast resulting in the trading of quartz, carnelian, turquoise, and Red Sea dentalium. Work in the third area, Jebal Hallal, has only begun and will be con- tinued during the winter of 1974. SOUTH ASIA AFGHANISTAN. Archaeological activity was at a minimum in Afghanistan. It was an off-year for Louis Dupree (American Universities Field Staff) and his team of prehistorians. The excellent project of Jim Shaffer (Case Western Reserve University) at the Bronze Age site of Said Qala, near Kandahar, was terminated-at least temporarily-because of lack of funds. This is extremely unfortunate because the site promised to resolve many of the chronological prob- lems so important to the understanding of pre-urban South Asia. The Smithsonian Institution Helmand Valley project, directed by William Trousdale, continued its studies into the history and human ecology of the region. Unfortunately, the author has been unable to obtain any direct information on the work. The political upheaval in late 1973 resulted in a reorganization of the antiquities service and the formulation of a new antiquities law which is said to be more favorable to foreign expeditions than the previous one. PAKISTAN. American archaeological activities were resumed on a limited scale after a seven-year hiatus. Walter A. Fairservis, Jr. (American Museum of Natural History) directed the first year of excavations at Allaha-dino, about 30 miles east of Karachi, in con- junction with the Pakistan Department of Archaeol- ogy. He was assisted by Jim Shaffer (Case Western Reserve University) and Michael A. Hoffman (Univer- sity of Wisconsin). This small site was previously desig- nated as "mature" Harappan on the basis of surface finds. This attribution proved to be essentially correct, but last summer's excavations also exposed earlier materials. An attempt was made at horizontal excava- tions with over 1000 square meters having been opened. Most of the exposure was concerned with delineating architectural features and possible func- tional areas of the uppermost occupation. Also, a 10 X 5m pit was excavated on the north fringe of the mound, in order to obtain an initial stratigraphic sequence for the site. Most of the material is presently under analysis but, tentatively, the following observa- tions can be made. 505</page><page sequence="8">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY The latest, and most extensive, occupation is Mature Harappan. Architectural units were con- structed of mud brick, sometimes on stone founda- tions. Besides habitation units, an area for kilns was discovered and a water control system constructed of stone-lined canals running from the highest point of the mound. A sluice stone was reportedly found at the junction of two of these canals. The earliest occupa- tional periods are known only from the limited ex- posures in the pit. There appear to be at least three additional occupations below the "mature" Harappan. Ceramically, the occupation immediately below Harappan is characterized by decorated pottery similar in style to that designated as Mehi (or Kulli) in this area. The majority of ceramics, however, demon- strated a continuity with those of the previous occupa- tion. Architecture is of mud brick. The lowest levels consist of two occupations differentiated on the basis of ceramic and lithic changes. While pottery decora- tions are in the Mehi tradition, definite changes can be noted in pottery shapes and types between these two occupations. No architectural features were present in the limited exposure of these two earliest occupations. The lithic industry of the lowest occupations displays a flake technology, including a few specimens of microlithic lunates. Another find reported from this lowest occupation is a sherd incised with an example of Indus script. All finds at the site were quantified in preparation for a statistical assessment of the material remains. The second season is planned for summer 1974. The project is being financed basically through the Smithsonian Foreign Currency Program. I wish to thank Jim Shaffer for the information summarized here. George F. Dales (University of California, Berke- ley) directed the initial season of excavations in Octo- ber-November at Balakot, about 50 miles northwest of Karachi, in conjunction with the Pakistan Department of Archaeology. The site was identified several years ago as a seaport of the Harappan period, and it was assumed that the entire site was basically of that period. Only rare sherds of non-Harappan attribution were ever collected from the surface. The initial exca- vations proved dramatically how incorrect this con- clusion based on surface survey really is. The dimensions of the site are approximately 200 X 250 m with a maximum height above plain level of about 10 m. It has the appearance of a small Mohenjo-daro, with the highest, most compact part of the mound being on the western side. An exploratory trench was excavated on the northeastern edge of the mound. It was 6 X 12.5 m in size and reached natural soil at a depth of 9.55 m (5.85 m below present plain level). Forty-two strata were differentiated with only the upper 15 being of the "mature" Harappan period. The excavation touched only the northern edge of the Harappan occupation, so little of the period was un- covered. Architecture is of mud brick with no stone foundations. Just outside the Harappan walls, an al- most perfectly preserved kiln was discovered. It is the best example of a kiln so far found at a Harappan site. Associated with the Harappan levels are large quanti- ties of shells (at least 14 types) and fish bones. Below the "mature" Harappan occupation there appears to be a rich, continuous development of mud brick, painted ceramic occupations. This material has not yet been analyzed but preliminary observations in the field show that excellent examples of painted ceramics usually designated Kulli, Nal, Amrian, and various other site names in Baluchistan are present in abundance. The important thing will be to determine the stratigraphic relationship of these supposedly diverse early or pre-Harappan cultures. Despite the pronounced presence of these diverse ceramics, the basic pottery technology and typology appears to be uniform throughout these early levels. Quantitative and qualitative differences will surely emerge as the material is analyzed. Wheel-made pottery is present from the earliest occupation at the site. Excellently preserved living floors are found in these early levels and large quantities of faunal and floral remains are present throughout the occupations. One tentative observation is that there was a major shift in dietary habits with the coming of the Harappan period from meats to seafoods. Eight charcoal samples were collected-four from the Harappan levels, four from the earlier occupations. They will be tested before next season's work begins. The second season will be conducted from October to mid-December. The work is financed basically through the Smithsonian Foreign Currency Program. The French continued their excavations at the unique Iron-Age site of Pirak, near Sibi, under the direction of J.-M. Casal and J.-F. Jarrige. The Pakistan Department of Archaeology opened excavations at Jhukar, near Moenjo-daro. The work, which is designed partly as a training program for younger officers of the Department, was directed by Dr. Mhd. Rafique Mughal, Superintendent of Excava- tions and Explorations. The site has special im- portance for the new information it could offer con- cerning the enigmatic "late" and "post" Harappan period. INDIA. To my knowledge, only one American archaeological project was underway last year in India. Jerome Jacobsen, working under a grant from the American Institute of Indian Studies, is conducting a project entitled, "Early Stone Age Habitation Patterns in Central India." The work, which is still in progress, is being done out of Poona (Maharashtra) in conjunc- tion with H. D. Sankalia and the Deccan College Post- graduate and Research Institute. The project seeks to determine the nature of habi- tation and exploitation patterns of Lower Paleolithic populations in the central Vindhyan-eastern Malwa region, primarily by means of surface survey and loca- tional analysis. Lithic material appears to be spread over wide areas rather than concentrated in campsite- like clusters. To date, more than 140 "occurrences" have been discovered within a five-mile radius in both forest and cultivated zones, and one "occurrence," at least 30 acres in extent, has been intensively inves- tigated. GEORGE F. DALES EAST ASIA CHINA. Chinese archaeological research carried out in Germany during the past year includes the cataloging of materials from the Northern Ch'i (A.D. 550 to A.D. 557) and the Sui (A.D. 581 to A.D. 618) 506 [Vol. 39, No. 3, 1974</page><page sequence="9">CURRENT RESEARCH and also the study of Han Dynasty motif groups and decorative schemes, by Kate Finsterbusch (Seminar for East Asian Culture and Linguistics, University of Munich). Fieldwork continued in the Choshui region of Central Taiwan under the interdisciplinary project directed by K. C. Chang (Yale University), with grants from the National Science Council of the Republic of China (Taipei) to Academia Sinica and National Taiwan University and from the U.S. National Science Foundation. The approach used involves the investiga- tion of the geology, botany, geomorphology, zoology, archaeology, and ethnology of two related river val- leys. Work within the People's Republic of China is taken from selected articles in the journals K'ao Ku and Wen Wu. Much of the research can be classified as salvage; however, a number of interpretive studies have also been completed. The ceramics of the Miao-ti-kou Neolithic site, Honan Province, have been reexamined with the con- clusion that only one period of Yang Shao is repre- sented, rather than the two suggested in earlier analyses. Excavations at a Neolithic site of Tzu-ching- shan, Pei-lai County, Shantung, carried out in 1963, have been reported (1973, K'ao Ku 1:11-15). A pre- Lungshan painted pottery layer and a Lungshan layer were discovered. A late Neolithic burial site, probably of the Ta Wen K'ou culture or a local variant, was excavated by the Shantung Museum in April and May 1971. The Hunan Museum reports the excavation of a Neolithic site in Meng-ch'i, Li County, Hunan Province, carried out in the spring 1967. The site ap- pears to be Late Neolithic. The Ning-hsia Autonomous Region Exhibition Bureau has published an account of tombs of the Ch'i Chia culture, found 2.5 km west of Ku Ch'eng. Three graves were recovered. In the south of China, the Kueichou Museum reports work on Neolithic sites in the Chung Ho region near the Yunnan border, while in Fukien, Neolithic remains as well as those of the Sung Dynasty have been worked on by the museum of Ch'uan Chou Hai-wai-chiao-t'ung City. A very interesting study of changes in shorelines in the Shanghai region has been completed by T'an Ch'i- hsiang and published in K'ao Ku (1973, 1:2-10). A number of studies of the Shang Dynasty have been completed. The Nanking Museum worked on the site of Ch'iu Wan, T'ung-shan County, Kiangsu Province, during the winter of 1959, the spring of 1960, and the winter of 1965. The site contains three strata-Lungshan, Shang, and Western Chou-and it is said that the Shang component is very similar to the Shang of the Nuclear Area. Late Shang sacrificial burials have also been found at Ch'iu Wan. Human and canine skeletons have been found in the area of four natural rocks. These sacrifices may have been made by the Eastern Barbarians since the practice is known from the historical literature. A study by Hu Hou-shan (1973, K'ao Ku 2:108-117) explores the archaeo- logical record from the Houkang site of the custom of cutting off one foot as punishment in the Shang Dynasty. A number of reports have appeared in the last year, dealing with commoners in Shang society and their cruel oppression. An important Shang excavation at Ta Hsin Chuang in Chi-nan, Shantung, has also been recently reported. Live human sacrifices have been reported from excava- tions by the Shantung Museum in 1965-1966 on Tomb No. 1, Su-fou-tun, Yi-tu County, Shantung. The owner of the tomb is thought to be someone very close to the Shang kings, and the site seems to have been a clan burial ground. Another series of excava- tions has been carried out on dwellings and tombs in Kao Ch'eng County, Hopei; the remains are dated from Early to Late Shang. One locality at T'ai-hsi- ts'un, Kao Ch'eng County, yields remains from all of the temporal divisions of the Shang. An iron-bladed bronze halberd has been analyzed by the Institute of Metallurgy; the blade appears to be made of processed iron and seems to indicate a beginning of iron metal- lurgy much earlier than previously anticipated. There appears, however, to be a possibility that the blade may be composed of meteoric iron, since it contains 1.76% nickel. The Shanghai Museum reports excavation of re- mains from the Geometric Kingdom and Western Han at the site of Ch'i-chia-tun, Chinshan County, Shang- hai. These finds have elucidated the chronology of geometric stamped pottery in the region of Hangchou Bay. The discovery of rock carvings in 1972 of the Ta Yueh Chih or Hsiung-nu tribes has been recorded near Hei-shan, Chia-yu-kuan Municipality, Kansu. A huge cache of 10,339 knife coins found in April 1960 has been reported by the Tientsin Municipal Museum; they appear to date to the Warring States Period. This is the first instance of such a large cache. Some simple metallurgical analyses have been carried out on some of the specimens. The Kwangsi Culture Bureau reports the excava- tion in 1971 of a cache of cooking vessels, wine ves- sels, musical instruments, military weapons, chariot objects, and production tools at Yang-chia, Kung- ch'eng County, North Kwangsi. While the bronzes show general similarities with Eastern Chou bronzes of the Chung-yuan, local southern motifs also occur. Twenty-five tombs were excavated in January 1972 by the Yunnan Museum at Li-chia-shan, about 40 kilometers southeast of the well-known Shih-chai- shan site. They appear to date to the late Chan-kuo or Early Eastern Han. Over 900 artifacts, including 800 bronzes, have been recovered. The Nanking Museum reported the excavation in 1965 of a Western Han tomb at San-li-tun, Lien-shui County, Kiangsu Province. The site appears to contain a Neolithic cultural deposit which was disturbed in the construction of the tomb. Four technical studies on objects from Tomb No. 1, Ma Wang Tui, Changsha, have been published. The remains of insects-three individuals of Dermestes sp. and two of Sitophilus-indicate a summer season for tomb construction. Sun Tso-yun (1973, K'ao Ku 1:54-61) and An Chih-min (1973, K'ao Ku 1:43-53) have both published interpretations of the motifs on the silk painting from the tomb. The Kiangsi Institute of Timber Industry has identified the four inner chambers as having been made of Catalpa wood (exact species unsure) while the chamber, itself, is made of Cunninghamia lanceolata. 507</page><page sequence="10">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY The Museum of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has reported the excavation in 1957 and 1963 of Han settlements in three localities in the Ulan Boha Desert, which were apparently part of the Han Shuo- fang commandery. From the archaeological evidence, continuous desiccation from Neolithic times appears to have occurred. The author of this report, Hou Jen- chih, has completed another article on changes in the Mao-wu-su Desert. He advocates extensive archaeo- logical fieldwork to document ecological changes in the region. In particular, the fifth-century settlement of T'ung-wan-ch'eng is said to be important. At the time of its construction by the Hsiung-nu, the sur- rounding area was not a desert, but an amply watered grassland. JAPAN. Of the 57 excavations carried out in Hok- kaido, only a few of the most important can be sum- marized here. Masakazu Yoshizaki worked on a pre- blade culture site at Sankakuyama, dated the at radio- carbon age of 21,400?400 years. Kiridashi knives and flake tools with inverse retouch were discovered. Mid- dle Jomon pit dwellings, carbonized through burning, were found at the Kaizuka-l-chome site, Kushiro City. The Satsukari site, southern Hokkaido, excavated for the second season, yielded pit dwellings and figurines. The Otsu site, southern Hokaido, yielded the first pottery coffin excavated in Hokkaido. From the Tsugaru Peninsula, Honshu, glass beads have been ex- cavated at the Kamegaoka site, indicating the exis- tence of glass at the end of Jomon or very early in the Post-Jomon period. Current research is focusing on the trade routes for these objects. New excavations for the Nakanoshima and Tokachibuto sites of southeastern Hokkaido are yielding information on the latter half of the Post-Jomon period, particularly settlement and mortuary practices. The Tokachibuto site, excavated by Kisao Ishizuki, Kiyoshi Sakurai, and Tetsuo Kiku- chi, offered good materials for studying the origins of Ainu agriculture, since it produced remains of cereals such as millet, barley, and hie. The Kodate site in Aomori Prefecture Honshu, studied by Kiyohiko Sakurai for the third season, is important for the study of Ainu iron production. The Institute of North Eurasian culture of the University of Hokkaido worked on the Menashidomari site in northeastern Hokkaido, while Tokyo Educational University exca- vated the Toyosato site on the Nemuro Peninsula. The Piragaoka site, Shari County, Hokkaido, now in its fourth year of excavation by Tetsuhide Yonemura and Norio Kanamori, shows characteristics of both the Satsumon and Okhotsk cultures. This section has been submitted by Kisao Ishizuki, Sapporo University. Akira Ono, of Okayama University, reports the excavation in August 1973 of the Kaigarayama site at Miyaura, Okayama City. This site appears to be an upland settlement (288.6 m above sea level) of Middle or Late Yayoi. Five dwellings have been found. Refuse dumps are thought to have been located in one place, and it is thought that cooking facilities were shared. The small community does not seem to have been self-sufficient; trade relationships with nearby villages would have been very important. The analysis of materials from the Airport site, Kumejima, and the Funaura shellmound, Iriomote, both in Okinawa Prefecture, continued in summer 1973 under the direction of R. Pearson and Susumu Asato. Soil and faunal analyses are now complete, and the site report monograph should be complete by fall 1974. KOREA. Major news in Korean archaeology this year centered on the discovery of the Silla Tomb 155 in Kyongju, dating to the fifth century. The tomb has yielded a gold crown and a painted wooden board showing two white flying horses. A belt, bracelets, and a sword-shaped decoration were also recovered. Miss Jennifer Jay and Mrs. Jazue Pearson assisted in the translation of materials for this report. Support from the Canada-Council, the Wenner-Gren Founda- tion, and the University of British Columbia Research Committee is gratefully acknowledged. RICHARD PEARSON SOUTH AMERICA SOUTHERN SOUTH AMERICA ARGENTINA. The noted Argentinian prehistorian, Professor Osvaldo Menghin, died on November 29, 1973, at the age of 85. Northwestern Argentina. Jorge Fernaindez (Mina Aguilar) has continued his research, begun in 1964, in the eastern Puna of Jujuy, combining geomorphology, climatology, and paleobotany with archaeology. He carried on excavations in several preceramic sites-a rock-shelter at Rfo Despensas, "Caverna del Indio" at Rio Pisungo, and a stratified open site at Rfo Grande, near Mina Aguilar. He worked with Juan Schobinger and J. R. Barcena (Universidad Nacional de Cuyo) in a field project that included excavation of a large pre- ceramic workshop site at Espinazo del Diablo, used by Andean hunters of about 6000 to 3000 B.C. Earlier, in 1971, he surveyed the western Puna region, locating superficial lithic sites belonging to the Andean Biface horizon. In the same area, he identified ancient re- mains of the anu (Tropaeolum tuberosum), one of the most commonly utilized tubers of the Central Andes, from which region it was probably introduced here. He continued his search for rock-art sites, locating 26 with painting and petroglyphs; one of the most im- portant is the Cueva de Tres Cruces. In order to deter- mine the Incaic horizon in this region, he climbed the Nevado del Chafii (about 6200 meters) and studied the ruins of "Jefatura de los Diablos" on the slope at 5000 m. Fernandez also did some surveying in the lower, woody part of eastern Jujuy. Near Ribo La Capilla, he located ruins of two small villages, where he collected ceramics, lithic material, and grindstones. In the same region (Ribo San Francisco, Provs. Jujuy and Salta), Bernard Dougherty (Universidad Nacional de La Plata) has continued his systematic research. From his exca- vation at El Piquete he obtained the very early date of 2750 radiocarbon years: 620?80 B.C. (A.N.U. 443) for the first ceramic phase. In 1972, Carlos Achero, Ana Marfa Aguerro (Uni- versidad Nacional de Buenos Aires), and Alicia Fer- nandez Distel (Universidad Nacional de La Plata) surveyed the Quebrada de Inca Cueva, between the Quebrada de Humahuaca and the Puna Region.They 508 [Vol. 39, No. 3, 1974</page><page sequence="11">CURRENT RESEARCH excavated in a small cave that yielded a remarkable assemblage attributed to the final preceramic stage (about the second millennium B.C.). The assemblage consisted of triangular and small lanceolate projectile points (some with the tying cord preserved), nets and twined textiles, cordage, coiled basketry (including a piece with the interior covered with sand and clay, for use as a vessel), leather bags (some tooled and painted red), decorated projectile shafts, mats, spatulas of bone and wood with engraved geometric designs, wooden flutes, shell beads, and so on. There are also remains of a cultigen, the bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria). There is a correlation between this material and the assemblage found by Alicia Fernandez Distel the previous year in her excavation of the cave of Huachichocana, in a canyon west of the Quebrada de Humahuaca. Below the ceramic levels here was another with partly similar elements, but with more cultigens-beans (Phaseolus sp.), potato (Solanum tuberosum), maize (Zea mais), and pepper (Capsicum sp.). A secondary burial was also found. These sites (and probably Puente del Diablo mentioned below) represent the first contributions to the knowledge of a preceramic agricultural stage in Northwestern Ar- gentina. Lidia A. de Lanzone (Instituto Nacional de Antropologfa) continued work already begun in the northern Puna region, and Pedro Krapovickas (Uni- versidad Nacional de La Plata) continued his work in the region of Yavi. Guillermo Madrazo, Norberto Pel- lissero, and Jos6 A. Perez worked in the Quebrada de Humahuaca and neighboring regions. In the Province of Salta, Eduardo Mario Cigliano and his staff (Universidad Nacional de La Plata), work- ing in the Quebrada del Toro and neighboring valleys, found and described new preceramic workshops (El Toro or La Hoyada, Las Cuevas, El Duraznito, among others) and excavated a new early ceramic sequence in Las Cuevas. The initial phase of this sequence has gray and red polished pottery dated at 2485 radiocarbon years: 535?60 B.C. (GrN-5852). This date and that of the Ri'o San Francisco mentioned above are now the oldest for ceramic cultures in Argentina. Evidence of a later phase, with tricolor painted and corrugated pot- tery and cylindrical pottery pipes, was found at several sites. Urns for child burials are present in both phases. In the Valles Calchaquies, Myriam Tarrag6, Victor Nufiez Regueiro, and M6nica De Lorenzi (all Museo Arqueolo6gico de Cachi) continued work. Ruins of an extensive village were studied in Las Pailas, which, ac- cording to unpublished radiocarbon dates, was flourishing in the eleventh and twelfth centuries (beginning of the Late period in Northwestern Argentina). New studies were made on the early ceramic site of Campo Colorado, where a date of 1895 radiocarbon years: A.D. ?70 (unpublished, courtesy of M. Tarrag6) was obtained. In Puente del Diablo, M6nica De Lorenzi and Maria De Ambrosis excavated a group of burials with the bodies packed in leather, which are associated with triangular points, spear- thrower (atlatl) hooks made of bone, and Phaseolus. The head of a woman showed signs of a blow; it seems to be a sacrifice. In the region of Cafayate some surveys and test pits were done by Osvaldo Heredia (Universidad Nacional de C6rdoba) and Jos6 A P6rez (Universidad Nacional de La Plata) discovering remains of the more eastern Candelaria culture. In the Guachipas area, E. M. Cigliano discovered and recorded the "Cueva Pintada," a rock shelter with anthropomorphic paint- ings of the Late Period. Spectacular excavations were carried out in mid- 1971 by Alberto Rex Gonzalez, assisted by Jos6 Togo (Universidad Nacional de La Plata), in the mountains to the south of Salta Province, near Pampa Grande. Two wide caves, used as cemeteries, yielded abundant human remains and artifacts belonging to the Can- delaria culture (first millennium A.D.)-anthropomor- phic urns, plain and decorated vessels, tools, weapons, ornaments, textiles, snuff tablets, and so forth. In Tucuman Province the principal archaeological work was directed by Eduardo Berberian (Universidad Nacional de Tucuman) on the margins of the Dique El Cadillal. Finds belong mainly to the Candelaria cul- ture. In northern Catamarca (southern Puna), Omar Bar- rionuevo (Centro de Investigaciones Antropolo6gicas de Catamarca) surveyed the region northwest, west, and southwest of Antofagasta de la Sierra, where he dis- covered preceramic and ceramic sites. He climbed the Volcan Antofalla (6100 m) without reaching the struc- tures on the summit. In the central-eastern portion of the province, he surveyed the valley of the Rio El Tala, locating five groups of stone dwellings; one of them was excavated and contained burials. In La Car- rera (Quebrada El Naranjo, north of the Catamarca city) he discovered a shelter with anthropomorphic paintings, one of them feline-headed; in Quebrada de Tipan he recorded a complex petroyglyph group. On top of the Sierra de Ancasti he discovered several groups of dwellings consisting of rectangular, semisub- terranean houses. One was excavated (Nanahuasi). All these sites belong to Aguada, the principal culture of the so-called Middle period (A.D. 650-950). In the Valle de Abaucan (W. Catamarca), Maria Angelica Borrello advanced her research on the Incaic expansion. She recorded sites and carried out brief excavations at several of them. Nicolas de la Fuente continued his survey in the Province of La Rioja, especially in the south in the Llanos de La Rioja, rich in preceramic and ceramic sites and petroglyphs. Cuyo Region (San Juan and Mendoza Provinces). The Centro de Investigaciones Arqueolo6gicas y Museo of San Juan University, directed by Mariano Gambier, continued systematic work oriented toward pre- ceramic and protoceramic cultures. As in former years, the search concentrated on the northern Iglesia Valley and the southern Calingasta area. An expedition west of the Ansilta Range led to the discovery, in caves and surface sites of the Fortuna region, of a lithic complex representing specialized hunters which resembles the Morrillos I complex from the western slopes of the Ansilta (about 6500 B.C.). Sites with ceramics related to the Chilean El Molle culture and petroglyphs were also discovered. A new excavation in the caves of Los Morrillos yielded a well-preserved funerary bundle belonging to Period III of this site (about 300 B.C.-A.D. 100). 509</page><page sequence="12">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY In the mountains east of the Iglesia Valley, Gambier discovered an Inca tambo and a probable mining place, not far from the actual mine of Gualilan. Antonio Beorchia is currently exploring the high cordilleran region of San Juan. His principal expedi- tions were to the Macizo del Potro (north of this province and west of the La Rioja) and to the Cerro Mercedario. In the first area, he discovered a great stone rectangle on top of Cerro Mogotes (about 5400 meters) and a wooden stick on Cerro El Potro (5800 m); in the second (previously explored in 1968 by Juan Schobinger), he found some sites which confirm that this Andean giant of 6770 m was a sacred place of the Incas. At 6200 m, three small circular structures made of pirca stone were excavated; they yielded two human female statuettes with woven dresses, tupus, and feathers, a small llama statuette (like the female statuettes, made of Spondylus shell), and a small purse covered with white feathers and containing coca leaves. At 6500 m, he observed and excavated another circular structure supported on the mountain slope by a pirca stone wall. The Instituto de Arqueologia y Etnologia of Cuyo University (Mendoza), directed by Juan Schobinger, carried on a survey of the Uspallata Valley and its surroundings. Among other works, the cleaning and partial restoration of the Inca tambo site, Tambillitos, was finished, and some of the dwelling structures were excavated. Pablo Sacchero (Instituto de Arqueologia y Etnologia) began a survey program in the Tupungato Valley and the upper Tunuyan River, western Men- doza Province, in collaboration with the Instituto de Geografia of the University of Cuyo. Farther south, in the region of San Rafaeol (Atuel and Diamante Rivers), Humberto A. Lagiglia (Instituto y Museo de Historia Natural de San Rafael) carried on his work in regional archaeology and continued excavations in the Cueva del Indio del Rinc6n del Atuel. He also survey- ed in the upper Rio Negro Valley (Province of Rio Negro). In December 1971, Juan Schobinger explored some areas to the south of Mendoza (Departamento Malarguie), especially sites where "clavas insignias ornitomorfas" were found, and studied a new petro- glyph site whose face motifs show influences from the Argentine Northwest (Caj6n del Chenqueco). Sierras Centrales (Cordoba and San Luis Prov- inces). West of C6rdoba, Carlos Romero (Gabinete de Arqueologia, Colegio Nacional de Montserrat) and col- laborators studied the abundant rock art of the region of La Playa which has both naturalistic and geometric painting. In Yaco Pampa, Romero excavated a camp- site of ancient hunters with projectile points like Ayampitfi. Nearby, in Agua de Ramon, he discovered a rough lithic industry without points. In Ampiza, two petroglyph groups were found, one of them of sym- bolic circular style clearly tied to the Amazonian type of petroglyphs. Alberto J. Marcellino (Universidad Nacional de C6rdoba) surveyed the northeast and northwest regions of the province. In May 1972, he discovered an extensive preceramic site in Chufia, near the Salinas Grandes. At points where the stratigraphy was pre- served, he excavated and found two well-preserved skeletons associated with lanceolate points, deep en- graved stones, and small blocks of red color. A physi- cal study done by Marcellino showed that they belong to the Lagid Paleo-American race (the same as the skulls of Lauricocha studies by B6rmida). Nicolas de la Fuente and Rub6n Tabares (Museo Arqueolo6gico Regional "Anibal Montes") surveyed the margins of the Ribo Segundo, locating some sites with late ceramic material; one of them was excavated (El Rinc6n). Luis Abel Orquera and Arturo Sala (Universidad Nacional de Buenos Aires) returned to a region whose research had been abandoned since 1967, Rio Quil- linzo in the southern Sierras. They found two new sites, belonging to the same preceramic series previous- ly identified: one with bifaces and crude artifacts of white quartz, not yet dated; the other with triangular points, similar to Intiguasi II, dated tentatively to the second millennium B.C. Santiago del Estero Province. Ana Maria Lorandi (Universidad de La Plata) is currently working in the fluvial lowland. She has published some radiocarbon dates, which place the middle-to-late culture of Sun- chituyoc at about A.D. 1300. Amalia Gramjo de Martinez Moreno (Museo Arqueolo6gico de Santiago del Estero) surveyed in the basin of the Salado and Dulce Rivers ("Mesopotamia Santiaguefia") and other regions of the province. She located many sites: settlements on flat mounds (typical of this area), burials, "earth ovens," various lithic and ceramic material, and remains of Hispanic settlements. At the end of 1972, she discovered a large site on the western slope of the Sierra de Guasayan ("Las Higuerillas," southwest of the province), with mixed material which can be divided into three occu- pation periods, one ceramic and two preceramic. The oldest has lanceolate Ayampitfi points. This repre- sents a previously unknown incursion of the Andean postglacial hunters into this eastern region. Chaco and Litoral (Parana and Uruguay Rivers). Victor Nufiez Regueiro (Universidad Nacional de Rosario) has worked on material obtained some years ago in his surveys and excavations on the banks of the Parana River (Province of Corrientes). The material belongs to late Precolumbian ceramic phases and to the beginning of the Hispanic period. Antonia Rizzo (Universidad de La Plata) continues work in Misiones Province. She shared a staff directed by Pedro I. Schmitz and Alberto Rex Gonzalez, which studied the Mini I site (near Goya, Province of Cor- rientes). The ceramic material was divided into two periods. Eduardo Mario Cigliano, and his coworkers Amanda Caggiano and Rodolfo Raffino (Universidad de La Plata), most recently did fieldwork in Salto Grande, near Concordia in Entre Ribos Province. Princi- pal results of this research are the identification of a preceramic period represented by a flake industry, "La Paloma," (found on high terraces of the Uruguay River), and three ceramic phases (on lower terraces and on the islands of the river)-El Dorado (about the beginning of the Christian era), Cerro Chico (with radiocarbon dates between A.D. 860 and 1180), and late Guarani (sixteenth century). The last represents a brief occupation by Guarani groups who arrived from the north by navigation. Rita Ceballos (Universidad Nacional de Rosario) and some students carried on excavations on islands of the Parana River near that city. Other teams did 510 [Vol. 39, No. 3, 1974</page><page sequence="13">CURRENT RESEARCH similar work on El Rinc6n (near San Lorenzo) and Cerro Cabrera (an island with an artificial mound). The ceramic material found is being studied. Ciro R. Laf6n and his collaborators (O. Chiri, L. A. Orquera, and others) pursued a plan of the archaeological de- partment of the University of Buenos Aires concerning the Litoral and northeast part of the country. Pampean Region (Provinces of Buenos Aires, La Pampa, and neighboring regions). Two similar, well- documented finds of lithic artifacts associated with extinct pampean fauna should be pointed out. First, on the laguna Las Encantadas, southwest of Buenos Aires Province, in a stratum belonging paleontological- ly to the Lujanense (uppermost Pleistocene), Antonio Austral (La Plata and Sur Universities) excavated a thick scraper associated with a plate of a Glyptodon carcass in Los Flamencos II. On the beach close to the site, he found more lithic material, probably eroded from the same stratus, including some fragments of big, percussion-worked points. Second, a team of the Instituto de Investigaciones Antropolo6gicas y Museo Municipal "Dimaso Arce," made up of Floreal Palan- ca, Leonardo Daino, and Edgardo Benbassat, exca- vated a site in Estancia La Moderna, near Azul, central Buenos Aires Province, which yielded some flakes and a pointed artifact on a flake (probably a scraper) asso- ciated with pieces of other animals of the Glyptodon family (Doedicurus clavicaudatus). Like the first site, the stratum is assigned by its faunal remains to the Lujanense. Guillermo Madrazo (Instituto de Investigaciones Antropolo6gicas y Museo Municipal "Damaso Arce") finished work in two districts of this province- Salliquelo6 in the West and Loberfa in the South. In a superficial site of the latter (Cerro Sombrero) he found some broken fishtail points of the El Inga type. A. Austral continued his systematic survey and fieldwork in the dry pampa region of La Pampa Prov- ince, mainly in superficial sites. Patagonia. A group from the University of Buenos Aires, directed by Marcelo B6rmida and Amalia San- guinetti de B6rmeda, finished fieldwork forming part of the Choc6n-Cerros Colorados salvage project (eastern Neuqu6n Province). The principal discovery is the Neuququense, a rough pebble complex found on high levels bordering both margins of the lower Neuquen River (90-100 m). The assigned age is about 10,000 B.C., a time when Andean forests reached this region. The Neuquense consists of choppers, chopping tools, and large flakes; it may be the origin of other lithic industries of Patagonia, such as the Rfogalle- guense. In addition, a wide area to be flooded has been surveyed, and two rockshelters near the dam of Choc6n have been excavated. Radiocarbon dates for three levels are expected. With the aid of the Centro de Investigaciones Cientificas de Rfo Negro directed by Rodolfo Casa- miquela, Carlos J. Gradi'n (Consejo Nacional de In- vestigaciones Cientfficas y Tecnicas) began extensive fieldwork in this province, searching particularly for its abundant rock paintings. In the Meseta de Somuncurai he discovered some groups of "parapetos habitacionales," stone circles with an opening to the northeast, explained as tent circles. The excavation yielded projectile points and other lithic material be- longing to the Patagoniense culture (Fell IV). In Paso Burgos (Cafiad6n de Supayniyeu), he discovered a new lithic complex on a 40 m-high terrace. The most char- acteristic and frequent artifacts are rough bifaces worked in white silex, conserving the crust in many cases. The complex is dated hypothetically to the fifth millennium B.C., and could be ancestral to two other, more developed biface complexes of inner and coastal Patagonia of the third millennium-Jacobaccense and Sanjorgense. Oriented by Gradfn, the Comisi6n de Investiga- ciones Arqueolo6gicas (a working group of the Instituto de Estudios Superiores), Trelew (Province of Chubut), directed by Carlos A. Luna Pont, carried on the study of rock art in the valley of the Chubut River. In 1971, the reports concerned five sites in the Los Adobes with petroglyphs and paintings of geometric and realistic style. In part, they seem to be modern. The excavation carried out in early 1971 in Cueva No. 3 of Los Toldos (northern Santa Cruz Province) by Augusto Cardich (Universidad de La Plata), with Adam Hadjuk as collaborator, was probably the most important prehistoric fieldwork of its kind in recent years. A stratigraphic pit had been dug in 1952 by Professor Menghin, who also excavated in Cave No. 2 at this site; his discoveries and views have been essen- tially confirmed by Cardich's work. Above bedrock, 12 natural levels could be determined, and four in- dustrial complexes could be clearly differentiated. Three radiocarbon dates were obtained. The lowest cultural level, No. 11 (12,600 radiocarbon years: 10,650+600 B.C.) contains well-retouched flakes; the artifacts are almost all scrapers. Cardich states that "It is the oldest date for a stratigraphic layer clearly con- nected with an industrial complex, for all the southern part of South America." The next two levels (10 and 9) represent the Toldense culture first described by Menghin, with a specialized Paleo-lndian industry which includes large triangular points. No "fishtail" points were recovered; they probably belong to another, slightly later, horizon. After a hiatus of 1500 years, represented by a sterile layer, the advanced blade industry called "Casapedrense" was exposed, with an extension of about 2000 years (5500-3500 B.C.), coincident with a climate more advantageous than that of today (Levels 7 and 6). Another hiatus of approximately 1000 years follows, represented by two layers of volcanic ash, and then the last occupation of the cave by Patagoniense hunters (Levels 3, 2, and 1) occurs. This excavation also confirms that the oldest negative Patagonian rock paintings (primarily red nega- tive hand prints) correspond to the Toldense culture level of this cave (about 9000-7000 B.C.). Carlos J. Gradfn extended his Patagonian campaigns to the west and south of Santa Cruz. He explored the Meseta del Lago Buenos Aires, finding dwelling sites and petroglyphs; in the Alto Rfo Pin- turas he completed a thorough register of the large rockshelters with superimposed paintings of negative handprints, guanaco herds, and geometric designs. An excavation in one of the rockshelters showed the exis- tence of three principal levels: the deepest with an advanced bone industry; another with triangular projectile points; and the most recent, belonging, possibly, to the Patagoniense. New excavations in this site are projected, and radiocarbon dating is in process. The neighboring Caflad6n de Charcamata was also in- 511</page><page sequence="14">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY vestigated, its painted hunting scenes were analyzed, and a test pit was dug. As part of the restudy of the Riogalleguense in- dustry discovered in 1953 by Menghin, Amalia S. de B6rmida visited the sites on terraces bordering the lower Gallegos River. She redefined this complex as a flake industry, whose beginning in this region is not older than the early Postglacial (about 7000 B.C.). Manuel J. Molina (Universidad de la Patagonia "San Juan Bosco") is currently studying aspects of Patagonian and Fueguian archaeology and ethnogra- phy, including rock paintings. URUGUAY. Archaeological work in Uruguay con- tinues to be rare; only a group directed by Antonio Taddei (Centro de Estudios Arqueolo6gicos, Monte- video) is working systematically. Some have partici- pated in a program of fieldwork directed by the Brasil- ian Institute Anchientano de Pesquisas in southeastern Uruguay, especially on the so-called "cerritos." Tabar6 Flangini has studied the site and artifacts of Playa Verde, between Sobls and Piriapolis near the shores of the Rob de la Plata (Dep. Maldonado). An advanced flake industry is represented, similar to that of Acegua, also recently studied by Taddei in the Dep. Cerro Largo in northeastern Uruguay. Another group has been formed around the Museo Municipal de Historia Natural de Rfo Negro (Fray Bentos); principal members are Ren6 Boretto and Rosendo Bernal. They organized the Primer Congreso Nacional de Arqueologfa held in Fray Bentos Decem- ber 20 to 23, 1972 at the same time as the Segundo Encuentro de Arqueologia del Litoral. The following information was presented at the congress. Two new localities, whose artifacts are roughly worked-on flakes, were explored. Osvaldo Rodriguez Saccone described the material of one of them, lo- cated in Mangarip6 on the R'o Negro in the Dep. Durazno. It consists of large basalt flakes, roughly re- touched by percussion. The three known sites are con- sidered to be those of primitive hunters and collectors; the chronology cannot yet be fixed. The third site is situated near the Salto Grande on the Rob Uruguay (across from the sites in Argentina studied by Cigli- ano); field survey and collection was done by A. Taddei, Jorge Baeza, Jorge Femenfas, and others. Femenfas analyzed the material, consisting of artifacts worked on atypical flakes of silicified sandstone. It is considered an impoverished variant of the Catalanense, studied by Taddei and B6rmida, whose sites are lo- cated in the northeast. Jorge Baeza, Carlos Echeverry, and Jos6 Barone studied a site cut by a road in Estancia Las Marias (near Melo, Dep. Cerro Largo). The collected material includes stemmed points of Patagonian type and other advanced lithic material of the type used by the classical hunters of the country. A late date is suggest- ed by a fragment of pottery. A new analysis of the geometric rock paintings of the Cerro Pan de Azucar (Dep. Maldonado), correcting some previous errors, was completed by Emilio Pelaez. Luis A. Silva surveyed different parts of the De- partamento Colonia facing the Rio de la Plata in the South. Rene Boretto, Rosendo Bernal, and others carried on an intensive survey of the margins of the Uruguay and lower Negro Rivers in the Dep. Ribo Negro and made some test pits. The abundant ceramic material was studied with the aid of Pedro I. Schmitz and Itala I. Basile Becker. Two principal pottery traditions were determined-one, with two phases, is characteristic of the middle Ribo Uruguay; the other, also with two phases, belongs to the Tupf-Guaranf tradition. JUAN SCHOBINGER CONGRESSES AND SYMPOSIA ARGENTINA. Three archaeological meetings were held in Argentina in the commented period. Segundas Jornadas Arqueol6gicas Cuyanas. The meeting was held at Mendoza, April 28-May 2, 1971, organized by the Instituto de Arqueologia y Etnologfa, Facultad de Filosofia y Letras, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo. Dissertations on recent works in this region and in the Northwest, and a symposium on "Arte Rupestre Argentino (Problemas practicos de termino- logia, registro y clasificaci6n)" were included. The paper of Carlos J. Gradin, "Notas sobre arte rupestre argentino," served as the basis for discussion. Its pur- pose was to assist scholars of different universities and museums of Argentina, and, in addition, one of Chile. Some sites of Mendoza and San Juan were visited in a two-day trip, which finished in the Museo Arqueo- lo6gico of the city of San Juan. Primer Simposio Internacional de Arqueologia del Area Andina Central Argentino-Chilena. Held in San Juan, June 11-13, 1971, the meeting was organized by the Centro de Investigaciones Arqueolo6gicas y Museo, Universidad Provincial "Domingo Faustino Sarmien- to," and its purpose was to confront research done on both sides of the Andean Cordillere between 28? and 38? S latitude, including all pre-Hispanic periods. Argentine and Chilean scholars were invited. There were dissertations on sites or specific cultural groups, and a "round table" under the direction of Mariano Gambier, in which some similiarities or connections were established, and problems were traced for future research. Segundo Congreso Nacional de Arqueologia Argentina. Organized by the Centro de Investigaciones Cientfficas of Rib Negro, directed by Rodolfo Casa miquela, this meeting was held at Cipolletti, prov. Roib Negro, May 22-28, 1972. Archaeologists (most of them young), persons interested in this branch of science, and students attended in great numbers in this little city in the high valley of Ribo Negro; as did some scholars from other countries (Chile, Peru, Brazil, Spain). Aside from the usual individual reports on recent research, papers were presented which consisted of up-to-date archaeological syntheses on each major region or culture area of the country, providing the possible basis of a textbook on this matter. The new regional museum of Cipolletti was visited-where a special exhibition on patagonian archaeology was shown by the Instituto de Antropologfa of Buenos Aires University-and an excursion was made to the area of the hydroelectric dam of El Choc6n on the Limay river (then still in construction), where some sites with coarse lithic material and one of the exca- vated rock-shelters situated near the dam were visited with members of the institute as guides. 512 [Vol. 39, No. 3, 1974</page></plain_text>
