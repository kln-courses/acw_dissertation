<plain_text><page sequence="1">214 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 15 (1988) John Rieder The Metafictive World of The Man in the High Castle: Hermeneutics, Ethics, and Political Ideology In the final incident of The Man in the High Castle, Juliana Frink forces Hawthorne Abendsen to admit that he has relied heavily on the I Ching in order to construct his highly successful alternative history, The Grasshop- per Lies Heavy. She then asks the oracle why it has written Grasshopper ("You have a disconcertingly suspicious way of phrasing your question," comments Abendsen), and the oracle delivers as its answer the hexagram of "Inner Truth." Juliana concludes (much to Abendsen's annoyance) that his book describes the real world-i.e., that the Japanese and the Germans really lost World War II. A reader who takes the trouble to consult the I Ching will find that its commentary on the hexagram of "Inner Truth" offers no straightforward support for Juliana's interpretation. The I Ching explains that the hexagram is composed of two trigrams, "Sun," the wind, above, and "Tui," the lake, below; it continues: "The attributes of the two trigrams are: above, gentle- ness, forbearance toward inferiors; below, joyousness in obeying superiors. Such conditions create the basis of a mutual confidence that makes achievements possible" (I Ching, p. 235). The I Ching's commentary could be made to bear in a number of ways upon the political situation in High Castle and on the way Abendsen's novel enters into and challenges that sit- uation. The point as regards Juliana's use of the oracle, however, is that, although her interpretation takes the "inner truth" as a metaphysical rela- tionship of correspondence between Abendsen's novel and the real world, the I Ching's commentary offers an entirely ethical understanding of truth. This observation does not merely undercut Juliana; it also opens onto a complex thematic situation in the rest of High Castle. The difference between a metaphysical and an ethical understanding of truth, and the bearing of each upon the other, are themes that run through- out High Castle. In the novel as a whole, and particularly in the ending, the border territory between ethical and metaphysical truth is occupied by political ideology: both Juliana's and the oracle's commentaries on the "Inner Truth" of Abendsen's novel become entangled in political relations between ruler and ruled, victor and vanquished, as soon as one considers their possible reference to the events of High Castle. In this essay I intend to explore the problematic relations between ethics, metaphysics and politics which present themselves in the novel's closure, and to argue that the novel explicitly refuses any resolution to</page><page sequence="2">THE METAFICTIVE WORLD OF HIGH CASTLE 215 those problems. Rather, High Castle undermines any interpretative attempt to posit "Inner Truth" either as the ground of political action or as an attribute of the work of art. Some critics have objected to the ending of High Castle. Kim Robinson, for instance, calls it a mistake, a superfluous, anticlimactic scene which merely tells us what we already know (p. 48). It is certainly not a natural or comfortable ending for a realist novel; its violation of the realist convention that the text should regard its own world as real (see Rose: 125, quoted by Robinson: 48) may account for the annoyance the ending has provoked in every group of students to whom I have ever taught High Castle. Nonethe- less, the conclusion of High Castle does not lack advocates. Many com- mentators find that it confirms the major theme of the novel, that Nazism really triumphed in World War II (e.g., Robinson, Pagetti, Warrick). Patri- cia Warrick spells it out thus (p. 49): "An equation is established in which Dick's novel is to the real world as Abendsen's novel is to Dick's fictional- ity. The winner of any war is locked into the necessity of continuing to fight, to maintain his superior power position. This effort eventually destroys him....The winner is paradoxically the loser." N. Katherine Hayles offers a somewhat more subtle variant of this interpretation: When the I Ching points to the world of The Grasshopper Lies Heavy as the real one,...the characters within High Castle are forced to confront their fic- tionality.... Evil is ultimately unreal, Dick reasons, because a world where evil is real is itself unreal. Moreover, we cannot see the real world because we see through a veil that we have created to protect us from the very evil that we believe to be real. When we cease to believe in evil, the veil will lift-and we will see clearly a world which is both good and real. (Hayles: 67, 7 1) Saying that Dick has written a poor or meaningless ending might well be preferable to agreeing with Hayles or Warrick that High Castle finally collapses into the comfortable hallucinations of ressentiment: that evil is an illusion, that we losers have really won. But the conclusion of High Castle may not lead so easily from metaphysical to political and ethical implica- tions as these critics seem to assume. Perhaps Carl Malmgren expresses the common ground which unites these interpretations when he says that the conclusion of High Castle, by making the novel's fictionality apparent and self-conscious, "asserts its own relevance through its claim to inner truth" (p. 123). Indeed, all of the novel's critics seem to be united in agreeing that the novel represents art as the world's deep truth (cf. Suvin: 166). But what if the "Inner Truth" hexagram is meant, instead, to undermine this very claim to relevance? Along this line of thought the novel's conclusion might, at least, appear as neither an aesthetic mistake nor an ethical banality. The implications of the hexagram can, in fact, be taken quite different- ly than they have been heretofore. While Juliana thinks the hexagram points to the text's (or texts') essential referentiality to the world, doesn't it merely say that some code of "inner truth" motivates the creation of one text (Grasshopper) out of another (the I Ching)? Truth points not from text to world but from text to text, and Abendsen's irritation with Juliana may</page><page sequence="3">216 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 15 (1988) simply register his impatience with her overconfident interpretation of his novel. The double reflection of High Castle and Grasshopper produces a kind of mise en abirme or liar's paradox which ought to forestall an attentive critic from repeating Juliana's error. However, because the hexagram's ver- sion of truth is inner rectitude, not hidden reference, it could be taken to imply that the ethical poise of the man of "inner truth" is the only way to sta- bilize these paradoxes. But what are we to make of the fact that Grasshop- per has resulted from the concatenation of the chance casting of the yarrow stalks and a code of meanings arbitrarily attributed to these random signi- fiers? Abendsen's irritation could just as well result from Juliana's having exposed his reliance on this mechanical procedure. Yet it is the same mechanical procedure which would now, in an exclusively ethical reading, exhort us to stabilize meaning. Ethics is being displaced in an odd way, and Juliana's interpretative procedures are an indication of the problem. She phrases her question in a suspicious way, according to Abendsen-mean- ing that she addresses the oracle as if it were a person. Yet her anthropo- morphic approach to the I Ching is matched by her own displacement from human relationships: Abendsen accuses her of being a demon, a chthonic spirit, with an "unnatural mind." And she is indeed isolated, having been drawn into a web of violence-a violent act which she performs almost without volition or cognition-by a man who travels in disguise, whose whole relationship to her is a lie, who at a crucial point in their journey begins acting almost mechanically. If ethics is called upon to stabilize truth, questions about truth may instead destabilize ethics by undermining any firm sense of the real. It seems premature, at the very least, to dismiss the conclusion of High Castle before having thoroughly examined the ways in which it may iron- ize the kind of ethical interpretations offered by Hayles, Warrick, and Juliana-or, for that matter, the I Ching. What is at stake would seem to be not merely a question of winners and losers, or good and evil, or even unreal evil and real good. Rather, the question has to do with our constructions of a sense of reality and a sense of the human. These are questions which per- vade Dick's fiction (see Fitting and Freedman). What is peculiar about The Man in the High Castle is that these themes, which in most of Dick's major work use androids, drugs, and schizophrenia as their vehicles, are carried in this novel by the vehicle of hermeneutics itself. The problem of hermeneutic activity within High Castle turns largely upon the status of the enigmatic moral advisor many of the characters con- sult, the I Ching. Juliana's interpretation of the hexagram of "Inner Truth," for instance, cannot be evaluated without asking what it means that Nobu- suke Tagomi receives the same hexagram immediately after he has killed the two Nazis in his office. Tagomi himself is finally led to suspect (in chapter 14) that the inner truth of things is death. But what Tagomi cannot know about the hexagram is what is finally most striking for readers of High Castle: the fact that the same hexagram appears at the same moment in different places. This happens repeatedly in the novel: for instance, when Tagomi, Frank Frink, and Robert Childan simultaneously receive the hexa- gram of Oppression (chapters 6-7). It does seem that the "Inner Truth" of</page><page sequence="4">THE METAFICTIVE WORLD OF HIGH CASTLE 217 the world of High Castle is indeed the I Ching, in the unusual sense that the I Ching is a prior text which governs the coherence of the novel. The I Ching is actually the active metaphysical principle of the universe of this book. The "passive chance workings" of the yarrow stalks are random, yet inevitable precisely because their random movements are the principle of coherence in the universe itself: "Random, yet rooted in the moment in which [Frank] lived, in which his life was bound up with all other lives and particles in the universe" (1:11). "Random" individual moments cohere in the seamless whole, which bears the static structure of the hexagrammatic code of the Book of Changes. Nonetheless, the fatefulness of the I Ching sometimes plays rather uneasily against its patent artificiality-for instance, when Tedeki calls it merely an "external frame of reference" (12:192) for its users to establish connections between themselves and the world. The treacherousness of such textual constructions is emphasized by the novel's preoccupation with the real and phony artifacts in Childan's store. The most interesting moment in this regard is Wyndam-Matson's discus- sion of "historicity" (5:58-60). Wyndam-Matson's lecture to his bored girl- friend serves no function in the novel except as a counterpoint to the passages where Frank, Juliana, and Tagomi faithfully consult the I Ching. The lighter which was on FDR's body when he was assassinated possesses "historicity" in the I Ching's version of the universe: it was woven into the unified moment of a great event. But Wyndam-Matson points out that the lighter is quite indistinguishable from any other lighter of its type. Its "his- toricity" is wholly contingent on the document which attests its authentici- ty. A concatenation of chance and textual commentary constructs the object's aura. Its historicity thus bears a strict formal homology with the oracle's pronouncements. Wyndam-Matson's point, however, is that the lighter itself has no significance; it is only the testamentary document, or, more precisely, the credence one lends the document's narrative, which makes the lighter valuable. This incident immediately follows Frank Frink's masquerade in Childan's shop, where he poses to Childan the horribly disruptive question: "Is it possible, sir, that you, the owner, dealer, in such items, cannot distin- guish the forgeries from the real?" (4:52). It is no accident that Grasshop- per also appears for the first time in the Wyndam-Matson scene. All three cases raise questions about the interrelationship of reality, history, and text (or artifact). And just as the I Ching seems to act as the metaphysical glue in High Castle's world, these doubtful objects fill out that world. In fact, the structure of High Castle's world can best be understood not as an alter- native history constructed by reversing the roles of conquerors and con- quered in World War II, but rather as a complex set of metafictional possibilities concretized by objects and texts within the novel. The princi- ple of this construction is much the same as the one Fredric Jameson ana- lyzes in his essay on Dr Bloodmoney. Jameson interprets that novel's odd array of intelligent animals, mutants, schizophrenics, speaking dead, and ordinary people in terms of the configuration of Greimas' semantic rectan- gle (p. 191):</page><page sequence="5">218 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 15 (1988) ORGANIC LIFE THE MECHANICAL (ordinary humans) (vermin traps or protheses) S -S -S AS NEITHER ORGANIC LACKING ORGANS NOR MECHANICAL (the dead) (abnormal spiritual powers-the gifted animals) For High Castle this diagram must be rewritten in terms of the metafic- tive possibilities generated by objects and texts, where the initial term (S) is simply the "real world," the everyday objects like cigarette lighters, Life magazine, and the streets of San Francisco which establish this world's strong familiarity for us. This initial term can be understood as a realist code of signification and narrative; it consists of a set of representations of objects which do not disturb the sense of reality of either the characters in the novel or of a reader contemporary with Dick or familiar with his histor- ical situation. The other terms in the diagram would represent various ways of violating this realist code of representation. The contradiction of the real world (-S) is the unreality represented by Nazi and Japanese dominance. This is the alternative history proper, generated by the premise of the Allies having lost World War II. The fictional code which directly opposes the realist one can be called the S-F code, since it is here that one finds the standard SF objects and themes: space travel, rockets, atomic war, and, in Dick's Japanese-occupied San Francisco, estranged social relations between whites and non-whites. The contrary of the realist code (s) is the realm of the artificial or counterfeit, consisting of all those realistic objects which the characters in the novel recognize as mere representations or fic- tions. It includes the phony artifacts in Childan's store and the faked identi- ty of Joe Cinnadella; but it also includes the novel-within-the-novel, Grasshopper, which allows for some self-reflexive discussions of the gen- res of alternative history and SF. Grasshopper further distances the realism of High Castle by undoing the trope of simple reversibility between fiction and reality, since its upside-down version of the characters' reality yields a history markedly different from Dick's own. In fact, all of the counterfeits in High Castle tend to unsettle binary oppositions like truth vs. falsehood or reality vs. illusion; the operative metafictive code is a reflective or critical one. Finally, the uncanny position of the text which is neither realistic nor</page><page sequence="6">THE METAFICTIVE WORLD OF HIGH CASTLE 219 unreal (-s) certainly belongs to the oracular I Ching and its hexagrammatic code, which is both outrageously artificial and profoundly true. The re-drawn diagram looks like this: THE REAL WORLD UNREALITY (familiar objects) (Nazi/Japanese dominance) Realist Code SF Code S -S -S Ev S NEITHER REAL NOR &lt; &gt; REAL BUT ARTIFICIAL UNREAL (fake antiques; The (I Ching) Grasshopper Lies Heavy) Oracular Code Critical Code There are two quite different ways in which this metafictive structure and the novel's ethical themes come to bear upon one another. The diagram illustrates one of these: the way that the novel systematically generates a series of alternative narrative and hermeneutic codes which contradict, unsettle, and reflect critically upon the characters' (and presumably the reader's) sense of the real. The novel's two major ethical crises-Tagomi's after killing the Nazis in his office, and Juliana's after killing Joe Cinnadel- la-can also be read as syntheses of the metaphysical conflicts generated by these permutations of the concept of reality. Tagomi's crisis involves him in a struggle to maintain his sense of the real world against the violent challenge presented to it by the unreal, nightmare world of Nazism. In terms of the meta-fictive structure of High Castle, rather than those of Tagomi's metaphysics, he suffers through a crisis of estrangement or defa- miliarization; and the rest of his actions-from his desperate recourse to the I Ching, to his meditation upon the Edfrank ornament which Childan forces upon him, to his strange walk through the tomb-world of "our" San Francisco, to his heart attack and his final conviction that death itself is the inner truth that the oracle was pointing out to him-all show him attempt- ing to find a narrative code which will restore coherence to his world. The parameters of Juliana's crisis are quite different. If Tagomi's crisis involves the cognitive dimension of the SF genre, Juliana's has to do with its utopi- an impulse. Rather than disturbing her sense of reality, her crisis sends her upon a pilgrimage which ends in a confrontation between the phony and the transcendental. Her story thus synthesizes the problematic relations between an oracular advisor and a fictional construction: the I Ching and Grasshopper, but also, more importantly, between her "demonic" determi- nation to achieve some kind of (libidinal, ethical, political) freedom, and</page><page sequence="7">220 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 15 (1988) the false promise of liberation offered her by the fictional character, Joe Cinnadella. It is much less a problem of essential reality than one of the authority afforded to a narrative which promises her-and America-a more dignified future. The two crises are united, however, by a quality of fatal contagion. Both Tagomi and Juliana find their everyday existence disrupted by the entrance into it of disguised Germans, and the result, for each of them, is the eruption of a moment of extraordinary violence. The fateful weight of "the moment" which descends upon all the characters who consult the I Ching seems to turn into literal fatality when mere interpretation gives way to full-fledged involvement in the larger scheme of things. The metaphysi- cal implications would seem to be more adequately expressed by Stanislaw Lem's paraphrase of Dick's fundamental position-"We exist, therefore we are damned" (Lem: 81)-than by Hayles's argument that evil and unreality are one and the same. But an important qualification needs to be made to Lem's position or to Tagomi's realization that evil is actual, "like cement." Reality itself is an unreliable term-or, more precisely, in High Castle the fabric of reality is metafictional rather than metaphysical. If the ethical authority of the good is to rest upon its freedom from illusion or its access to a higher plane of reality, ethics itself is in trouble: "We do not have the ideal world, such as we would like, where morality is easy because cogni- tion is easy" (15:236). There is, however, a different way to explicate the relation of the metafictive objects in High Castle to its ethical themes. A certain slippage occurs between the novel's critical transformations of the concept of reality and the status of its primary ethical term, the authentic human relationship. It is not at all obvious that ethical possibilities are supposed to be grounded in objective knowledge. Quite the contrary: the characters' constructions of meaning can be taken as projections of their various ethical situations. The best example is the semiotic career of the Edfrank artifacts. For Ed McCarthy and Frank Frink, the bits of polished metal are pleasing designs, and (they hope) saleable commodities. For Childan the jewelery initially means nothing. It is merely an occasion for enacting his desires-first, by exploiting Ed and Frank's powerlessness when he takes their handiwork on consignment rather than paying for it; and later, by attempting to use it in order to gain a private audience with an upper-class Japanese woman. His class position and his racism determine the jewelry's purely instrumental meaning. But for Paul Kasoura, who speaks from the very heart of Japanese tradition, the object Childan has given him possesses "wu"; it has the status of a sacred object, like a saint's relic. When he returns it to Childan, it becomes an emblem of authentic American ethnicity and the rebirth of an American sense of identity. Finally, Tagomi's meditation on the piece he buys from Childan enacts the very process of turning an empty signifier, a "squiggle of silver," into a profoundly meaningful "microcos- mos in [his] palm" (14:218-21). Yet this transformation is clearly a wish- fulfillment, the action of a man grasping at straws. Similarly, the ornament's final meaning for Childan remains tainted by his racism ("Anglo-Saxon fanaticism," as Childan calls it [14:216]). At every point in</page><page sequence="8">THE METAFICTIVE WORLD OF HIGH CASTLE 221 the career of the Edfrank jewelry, the meaning of these objects is deter- mined, and often undercut, by the interpreter's ethics. Grounding these various interpretations would seem to be the presence or absence of an authentic human relationship. This is perhaps the way to understand Tagomi's contention that some books, like the I Ching and the Bible, are "living organisms." (Juliana's anthropomorphic approach to the oracle is a mystified version of the same idea.) These books represent and keep alive the collective human relationships of a tradition of wisdom. The "evil" counterpart of such an authentic community is, of course, Nazi soci- ety, with its conspiratorial politics, its brutal economic exploitation, and its reduction of individuals to racial types. The list of the Nazi contestants for power is a veritable catalogue of the modes of reifying or rejecting authen- tic humanity, and both important German characters appear in the novel in disguise. The various forms of isolation and alienation suffered by Childan, Frank, and-more spectacularly-Juliana and Tagomi all result, although with widely different kinds of mediation, from the intrusion of Nazi racist ideology or political intrigue into their lives. But the permutations of the novel's humanist ethics, unlike its metafictive metaphysics, never reflect in a critical manner on their founding term, the genuinely human. The unreal and the fictional infect and undermine the concept of reality, but the exploitive, the egocentric, the alienated, the racist-none of these terms seems to be given the universalizing power to challenge the primacy of the human. In fact, they refer all too unproblematically to that genuine humani- ty which they obscure or abuse. It is not a case where one can choose between the two interpretations. Consider, for example, the persistent double focus of Tagomi's attempts to come to terms with the horror of Nazism. On the one hand, the pathos of his situation consistently refers to a loss of humanity. His confrontation with the Nazis forces him to conceive of human beings as blind moles or insects "groping toward something terrible or divine"; it is certainly some- thing inhuman that the Nazis introduce into the world. On the other hand, the Nazis represent a metaphysical problem, the concrete reality of evil. They threaten his religion, his understanding of the organization of reality, rather than his humanity; and his resolution of this doubt has a metafiction- al cast: "Vital sometimes to be merely cardboard front, like carton. Bit of satori there, if I could lay hold of it. Purpose in overall scheme of illusion, if we could but fathom. Law of economy: nothing is waste. Even the unreal. What a sublimity in the process" (14:226). Yet even though the boundaries of his crisis are clearly constituted by the conflict between his sense of the real world and the challenge to its coherence posed by Nazism, Tagomi's final act of defiance-his refusal to process the papers which would extra- dite Frank Frink-is resolutely humanist, an insistence on individual per- sonality and compassion. All that holds together Tagomi's metaphysical speculations and his heroism, however, is his own integrity; and when Juliana, rather than Tago- mi, is the central character, the difference between ethics and hermeneutics becomes a deeply troubling antagonism. This antagonism comes to a head in the closing moments of High Castle, where the tension between oracular</page><page sequence="9">222 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 15 (1988) pronouncement and ethical interpretation, between metaphysical truth and human artifact, arises to highlight the problematic relation between her- meneutics and ethics. Far from offering an analogical key to the novel's interpretation, the conclusion rehearses the impossibility and inevitability of establishing such a meaning. I offer the following reading, then, of the mise en abime into which the hexagram of "Inner Truth" throws interpreta- tion at the end of High Castle: the relation between a sense of the human and a sense of the real in High Castle is such that one's cognition of reality cannot reliably guide ethics, and yet one's sense of the human nonetheless inevitably produces an ethically determined interpretation of reality. The concept of truth is thus impossible to establish, but also impossible not to produce. This conclusion does not offer comfort or resolution; rather, it fails to do so precisely because there is none to offer. This play-for it is not exactly a contradiction-between the real and the human is also the crux of High Castle's political ideology-i.e., of the novel's articulation of its fiction with "our" history. The founding device of the novel, its reversal of the positions of power and subservience occupied by whites and non-whites, works by maintaining a sense of the essentially human as against the arbitrarily disposed roles of social reality. Dick thus wields a liberal humanist ideology against racism, mirroring the strategy of much civil rights' protest (e.g., Black Like Me), but also producing a demystified version of the reversed colonial situation of Wells's The War of the Worlds, the archetype of the SF novel of modem warfare. Thus Dick's novel could be said to interpret the non-human invaders of Wellsian tradition as those humans (and particularly those imperialistic Americans of the Cold War period) who choose to deny their common humanity or who elevate racial and political differences over it in the pursuit of power and wealth. Yet Dick's novel is more than a protest against racism or against rapa- cious imperialism and capitalism, for High Castle is far too pessimistic about political or economic solutions to allow the survival of any liberal faith in an ethically reformed free enterprise or democracy. It is Dick's pes- simism which sets him apart from the Wellsian tradition as well as from civil rights' ideology. This pessimism entails a sharp break from the colo- nialist ideology of providential intervention which survives, however dis- placed, in the resolution of The War of the Worlds. Rather, the moments of hope or salvation available to Dick's characters depend entirely on the abil- ity of their sense of humanity to survive the dehumanizing pressures of an unreliably "real" world. The individual conclusions to the stories of Tago- mi, Wegener, and Frank Frink each reinforce this basic theme. Consider once again the denouement of Tagomi's story. His meditation on the Edfrank ornament is interrupted by a severe disruption of his sense of the real, a brief trip which takes him out of his own realist code (this loss is marked by the disappearance and subsequent reappearance of the pede- cabs) into a realist code that belongs to the San Francisco of the Embar- cadero Freeway. The nightmarish quality of this world for Tagomi inheres in the loss of his social status; in this world Tagomi becomes "Tojo," an insignificant Oriental to whom whites do not give place. This is, of course,</page><page sequence="10">THE METAFICTIVE WORLD OF HIGH CASTLE 223 one more turn of the anti-racist screw. But it also highlights the metafictive, contingent status of Tagomi's social identity, and thus severely qualifies the reformist hope that could perhaps be attached to Tagomi's later anti- bureaucratic heroism. Thus Tagomi's subversion of the German bureaucra- cy which would condemn Frink for being a Jew, and his dismissal of Reiss's protest that "You're making this all bitter and vindictive. Where it ought to be mere formality with no personality embroiled" (14:229), is also a moment when Tagomi radically isolates himself from the social structure within which he must live. His heroism lies in his ability to retain his human- ity against the pressure of the dominant political and social versions of reality. The sense of the human offers hope only, precisely to the extent that it unshackles itself from the social illusion. But that liberated moment is chilled by the shadow of impotence which falls over Tagomi as he walks past the Embarcadero Freeway. Given the contingency and fragility of social identity (in many other Dick novels this will be figured as the otherness of the android), Dick's ethical protests yield what one might call a version of doomed liberalism. Wegener, the humanist German, is reduced at the end of the novel to the feeble hope that perhaps the Nazis will destroy one another "and leave the rest of us here and there in the world, still alive" (15:236). Rather than hop- ing for an eventual political solution, Dick can only allow his character to anticipate the dissolution of the social fabric, leaving behind the merely human individuals "here and there in the world" who have survived its influence. Here Dick's pessimism radicalizes liberal humanism into anar- chistic individualism. Perhaps the most telling moment, however, is that offered in the final appearance of Frink, when, after being mysteriously released from jail, deportation, and certain death, he returns to his ship and resumes his labor: "Working and not thinking, not looking up or trying to understand" (14:232). Nowhere else in the novel is the bearing of the epistemological undecidability of the real on political understanding so clearly and paradox- ically expressed. The value of this moment is not its relevance to the real world; nor is it even its sublime coherence with the "overall scheme of illu- sion" (14:226). It is quite the opposite: the very possibility of a resolution filled by artisanal construction without determinate signification is dictated, both in its possibility and in its apolitical, fatalistic constriction, by the unreality of the real. If Frink enjoys some kind of liberation here, it would seem to be a freedom from all those codes of interpretation-and therefore concepts of reality-which generally exercise such a negative, limiting force over the characters, particularly in the "evil" forms by which they fetishize or reify the relationships which produce them. Although Hawthorne Abendsen and Grasshopper are obviously mirror images of Philip Dick and High Castle, it is probably Frank Frink's unthinking production of empty-yet, as we have witnessed, profound and even redemptive-signifiers which stands as the most fitting emblem of the role of the artist in Dick's novel and the political ideology it produces. For all its provocative play with social and political history, the novel explicitly undermines any determinate reference of its alternative histories to a politi-</page><page sequence="11">224 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 15 (1988) cal agenda-at the same time as it insists that this reference will and must be made. Dick has not erected a High Castle or fortress of vision. Rather, like Frank's dogged and contentless work, the novel promises only to cre- ate among its readers a form of community like that of the random coher- ence among the "moments" of hermeneutic activity codified in the I Ching: an apolitical collectivity, without a center or a goal.

Dans le Haut Chateau, la relation entre le sens de l'humain et le sens du reel est telle que l'e'thique ne peut pas se baser aveugle'ment sur notre connais- sance de la re'alite' mais malgre' tout, notre sens de l'humain produit ine'vitablement une interpre'tation du re'el fonde'e sur I'e'thique.

(JR) Abstract.-The primarily ethical commentary the I Ching gives to the hexagram of "Inner Truth" does not support the referential interpretation given to the hexa- gram by Juliana Frink in the concluding incident of Philip Dick's The Man in the High Castle. In fact, the problem of interpretation in the closing incident involves a complex thematic conflict between ethical and metaphysical modes of interpreta- tion in the rest of the novel. The structure of the novel's world can be understood as a manifold of hermeneutic codes generated in contradiction to and critical reflection upon a fundamental code of realist referentiality. The same kind of criti- cal reflection does not, however, take place upon the novel's ethical valuation of authentic human relationships. It is this tension between ethics and metaphysics which governs the mise en abime presented to interpretation in the final incident. The relation between a sense of the human and a sense of the real in High Castle is such that one's cognition of reality cannot reliably guide ethics, and yet one's sense of the human nonetheless inevitably produces an ethically determined inter- pretation of reality. The concept of truth is thus impossible to establish, but also impossible not to produce. (JR)</page></plain_text>
