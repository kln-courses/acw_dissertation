<plain_text><page sequence="1">determinism was gradually extended from the phenomenal world to the human mind, either negating free will altogether or reducing it to a mere epiphenomenon. Well-trodden ground perhaps, but Thorslev's survey of eighteenth-century theo- dicy and the origins of Romantic vitalism is well documented, and although there may be few startlingly new insights here his lucid discrimination of terminology which is all too frequently misused (e.g. destiny, fatalism, determinism) is most valuable. In the second half of the book Thorslev examines how freedom and destiny inform Romantic thought as opposing principles, varying in inverse proportions like Blake's Reason and Energy. He classifies the Romantic age into three dominant world views or hypothetical 'universes'-the 'organic', the 'Gothic', and the 'open'-each of which reacted against 'the myth of the mechanized universe of eighteenth-century physics and rational theology' to restore to man 'some sense of individual freedom, and some sense of a social and universal destiny'. The 'organic universe', in Thorslev's account, is characterized by belief in an immanent destiny which unites man and nature in the freedom of purposive self- determination. This world view proposed to remove man's alienating self- consciousness either by assimilating mind to nature or nature to mind, restoring to man the security of participating in a universal destiny. Such an approach entailed the assumption of an immanent moral benevolence in nature, often made explicit in what Thorslev (by analogy with Hegel's 'Cunning of Reason' (die List der Vernunft)) terms Wordsworth's 'Cunning of Nature'. A more courageous alternative to this compromise fusion of consciousness with nature was the 'Organic Sublime'. This denied any moral teleology in the universe, substituting instead an amoral delight in the sheer plenitude of the creative force. It is here, I feel, that Thorslev's argument is least convincing. His selective account of the sublime fails to grant sufficient weight to the theological assumptions which had become conventionally inextricable from this genre, while his thesis that the sublime in nature is essentially amoral requires, at best, more extensive justification. Destiny in the 'Gothic universe' by contrast is not immanent but transcendent. In this fatalistic world view suprarational powers operate through anthropomorphic deities whose intermittent influence on man is generally malevolent and from the human perspective remains inscrutably capricious. Man's freedom and dignity are assured only by resolute opposition to this transcendent destiny. This is a useful chapter, economical and stimulating. The third world view which Thorslev considers is that of the 'open universe' in which there is no destiny, whether immanent or transcendent. Here man in isolation assumes the burden of existentialist freedom, forced to create his own provisional order in an apparently contingent universe which confronts him with indifference. Thorslev's survey ranges from Godwin to Pater, analysing rigorously various theories of Romantic irony. I noticed only three oddities in this attractively designed and well-indexed book: T. S. Eliot's 'dissociation of sensibilities' (pp. 34, 35); Wordsworth's ascent of 'Snowden' (pp. 68, 98); and Kant's curiously dative Dingen-an-sich (p. 158). ALAN ROBINSON The Proper Lady and the Woman Writer: Ideology as Style in the Works of Mary Wollstonecraft, Mary Shelley, and Jane Austen. By MARY POOVEY. Pp. xxii+288. Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press, 1984. Â£I7 net. Mary Poovey's The Proper Lady and the Woman Writer focuses on the ways in 270 REVIEWS</page><page sequence="2">which the contradictions inherent in bourgeois individualism were experienced in an acute form by Mary Wollstonecraft, Mary Shelley, and Jane Austen as they attempted to reconcile the opposing roles of proper femininity and professional authorship. Assuming as her premiss an intimate correspondence between culture and individual genius, Poovey draws on a wide range of primary material, historical and social as well as literary, to detail how these authors' narratives directly represent the norm of propriety while indirectly reflecting its tensions. The latter are seen to be especially evident at the end of the eighteenth century when a conservative backlash intensified the social dichotomies highlighted by the revolutionary declarations of independence. Out of this clash between a traditional order based on patronage and the evolving capitalist individualism comes the image of the Proper Lady, which ultimately merges into the Victorian Angel of the House. It is one of the paramount values of this study that it catches the phenomenon at its inception and so is able to scrutinize an emergent code before it hardens into a narrative given. The opening Preface, detailing the genealogy of the Proper Lady and offering 'characteristically feminine' literary strategies, relates the ideology of propriety to individual style with a flexibility and critical insight that will mark the entire study. Succeeding chapters explore how each author reacts differently to the injustices and inequalities generated by the ideal of modest submission and self- denial: Wollstonecraft evades confrontation with the conventions of her society by retreating into sentimentalism while Shelley, in many ways, capitulates to them; Austen, in turn, uses irony in an attempted adjustment of propriety to allow for a mutual affirmation of private emotion and social order. Awareness of the possible discrepancies between fiction's declared programme and the values implicitly endorsed by the working out of structure and narrative voice leads Poovey to subtle and illuminating interpretations of both traditionally marginalized texts such as Wollstonecraft's Maria or Shelley's The Last Man and Falkner and the more canonic works of Austen. The specific problems encountered by each author in her attempt to meet the terms of a normative propriety are then matched by differing critical perspectives; autobiography, rhetorical analysis, practical criticism, and social and political detail are all invoked as the occasion demands. This variety of interpretative methods in conjunction with the organizing concept of the Proper Lady proves remarkably fruitful. For despite the obvious differences between the three authors, they do share certain thematic interests since each is faced with the problem of discovering a form appropriate to the expression of the vexing issues created by gender. But while Wollstonecraft and Shelley feel compelled to undercut either social institutions or individual desire, Austen's fiction sets the two imperatives together, assuming that their interaction will encourage modification of these contrary impulses. In developing this thesis Poovey builds on the insights garnered in earlier chapters, uncovering the ideological implications of genre to explore from a feminist point of view the tension between romance and realism. Testing theoretical inference against practical criticism reveals not only the paradoxical qualities of Austen's work but also the strategies by which she circum- vents dealing directly with those paradoxes. Poovey is an eminently logical writer whose carefully reasoned arguments absorb, without confusion, a multiplicity of historical, economic, and literary perspec- tives. The elegance of her style is matched by the incisiveness of her commentary, an accomplishment especially noteworthy in her sophisticated use of the now unfashionable autobiographical criticism. More current methods, such as feminism and Marxism, are adapted with equal success to create a genuinely illuminating and challenging study. APRIL LONDON REVIEWS 271</page></plain_text>
