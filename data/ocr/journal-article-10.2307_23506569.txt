<plain_text><page sequence="1">UNMEANT MEANINGS OF SCRIPTURE* ABRAHAM CRONBACH Hebrew Union College - Jewish Institute of Religion, Cincinnati AMONG the striking aspects of Judaism, of Christianity, and perhaps of other religions, is that of extolling certain texts as sacred and then using those texts to convey meanings far different from anything that their authors had in mind. The most prevalent example of this is the sermon — the homily, the Derush. The sermonic alteration of meanings is so commonplace that we dispense here with illustrations. The propounding of such unmeant meanings, however, has not been limited to sermons. The Bible has undergone manipulation not only in the act of preaching. Aside from preaching, some of the weightiest thoughts emerging from the Bible have been thoughts which never existed in the minds of those who wrote the Bible. Man doth not live by bread only (Deut. 8:3). Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil (Ps. 23:4). Worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness (Ps. 29:2). As one thinketh in his heart so is he (Prov. 23:7). Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him (Job 13:15). I know that my Redeemer liveth (Job 19:25). * An article with the same title and by the same author appeared in the student publication, The Hebrew Union College Monthly, for October 15, 1931. The present article is a totally different venture, completely rewriting and extensively amplify ing that earlier article and rectifying its many flaws.

What do we mean by weighty thoughts and deathless utterances? We mean something that appeals to us personally, something that moves us, that stirs us. We imply, at the same time, something that measures up to our ideals and, for that reason, fascinates us. Illustra tion of this is furnished by today's authors who dwell upon the ex cellences of Judaism and enthusiastically acclaim what "Judaism teaches." Excellence implies a standard, and the standard is the out look of the modern author himself, and presumably also that of his readers. The Judaism expounded may be ever so ancient, but it is judged by a criterion as modern as our own day. Meanwhile, that which appeals to our own generation is not always the same as that which appealed to generations of long ago. As time passes, cultures change. As cultures change, standards change. The simplest procedure would be candidly to acknowledge that standards change. But an assumption has somehow become em bedded in the human psyche that antiquity assures reliability. By being ancient, a thought acquires prestige. This prompts the inclina tion to impute to ancient writers the views of a later age. Passages of the Bible get vested with meanings other than those which they bore at their inception. Since those unmeant meanings are the more recent meanings, the standards on which they rest tend to approxi mate our own. That is what makes them weighty for us and deathless. i. Detachment from the Context The unmeant meaning is sometimes achieved by quoting a passage out of its context. A curious example is Gen. 31:49: The Lord watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another. There are Protestant churches in which that verse, called by them the "Mizpah Salute," is recited as a benediction at the close of the service. In its context the verse conveys well-nigh the opposite of a benediction; it amounts almost to a threat. A conflict has raged between Jacob and Laban. That verse, inscribed upon a monument, betokens a provisional suspension of the conflict. Its purport is: "The Lord keep watchful against clandestine wrongdoing on the part of either of us against the other." As a benediction, the verse carries a meaning of which its biblical author could not possibly have dreamt.</page><page sequence="3">[3] UNMEANT MEANINGS OF SCRIPTURE 101 An unmeant meaning is also borne by the verse which, among Jewish people, is better known than any other verse in the Bible, the "Hear, O Israel" of Deut. 6:4. That sentence has served as the Jewish declaration of monotheism. Yet the wording hardly sustains that im plication. The verse has been variously translated: Jehovah our God is one Jehovah.1 Jehovah our God, Jehovah is one.2 Jehovah is our God, Jehovah is one.3 Jehovah is our God, Jehovah alone.4 The Lord our God, the Lord is one.5 The Lord our God is one Lord.6 In no event do the words signify that Yahweh is the only God in the universe. The commentaries apprise us that the passage makes no statement concerning the existence or the non-existence of other gods.7 The reality of other gods is at least nominally recognized in verse 14:8 Ye shall not go after other gods, the gods of the peoples that are round about you. In the admonition to love Yahweh, Yahweh becomes contrasted with gods other than Yahweh.9 One of the commentaries points out that, if the meaning were that, besides Yahweh, no god exists, there would stand in place of the second word "Yahweh," the word Elohim.10 The prima facie import of the passage is not that there is only one God in the world but that there is only one God whose name is Yahweh. That the Book of Deuteronomy is not entirely committed to monotheism in our sense of the term is evidenced by its passages which forbid the worship of gods other than Yahweh." There is no I LXX, Vulgate, AV, RV, RSV. Where the RV says "Jehovah," all the other versions translate "The Lord." » JPS, RV, RSV. נ RV, RSV. * RV, RSV, Nowack H, New JPS quoting Ibn Ezra and Rashbam. ־JPS. 6 LXX, Luther, AV, RSV. י Nowack H, Cambridge B, New Century Bible, Edited by Walter F.

See also Deut. 32:39.</page><page sequence="4">102 ABRAHAM CRONBACH [4] point to inhibiting the worship of other gods if there are no other gods. The unduplicated Yahweh contrasts with the multiplicity of Baalim.12 According to one of the commentaries, "The people of Judah conceived Him, as Baal or Ashtoreth was conceived, not as one but as many deities with different characteristics and powers over different localities."13 That is perhaps the notion which Deut. 6:4 combats. The purport of the verse could perhaps be that the Yahweh worshiped at Bethel was identical with the Yahweh wor shiped at Hebron and also identical with the Yahweh worshiped at Mizpah and at Shiloh and at Gilgal. At the time of the Deuteronomic Reformation there may have been an especial pertinence in proclaim ing that the Yahweh worshiped at the various shrines was one and the same Yahweh. The Reformation had outlawed all the shrines except the one at Jerusalem. How vital, therefore, the assurance that, though the shrines had ceased, the worship of Yahweh had not ceased! The Yahweh adored at Jerusalem was identical with the Yahweh previously adored at Bethel or Mizpah or Hebron or Shiloh or Gilgal. Could not this be a possible sense of "Yahweh our God, Yahweh is one"? "Hear, 0 Israel," as a declaration of monotheism could thus be another of those unmeant meanings. A further example is the observation in Deut. 8:3: "Man doth not live by bread only." It is customary to use these words as an affirmation of the spiritual. The verse is taken to signify that our physical needs are not our only needs. There is also need of love and beauty and aspiration. Yet such is not the sense allowed by the con text. The words refer to the manna of the wilderness. The passage declares that bread is not the food exclusive. Manna is also food. Manna is food divinely supplied, as bread is food prepared by man.14 According to the commentators, the passage stresses the Divine intervention in behalf of Israel's sustenance.13 But that is not identical with what we of today call "the finer things of life." Here "the finer things of life" enter as an unmeant meaning. Similarly with Ps. 107:9 which reads: For he satisfieth the longing soul, And filleth the hungry soul with goodness. 12 Int. Crit.

But the context invokes a different frame of reference. The import of the passage lies in the domain of the physical.16 The passage alludes to a caravan which had lost its way in the wilderness and had almost died of starvation before it reached an inhabited place where food could be procured. The spiritual meaning is the unmeant meaning. Though we shall, in another connection,17 be considering Isa. 1:18, Though your sins be as scarlet, They shall be as white as snow; Though they be red as crimson, They shall be as wool, it is in place here to mention the explanation that the utterance is sarcastic, the prophet's real opinion being that, for sins of such enor mity, pardon is out of the question.18 There would then arise a de cidedly unmeant meaning when the passage, taken out of its context, is quoted as a sober promise of forgiveness. Hab. 2:4 contains the famous words: "The just shall live by his faith." In the sixteenth century of the Christian era those words became the slogan of the Lutheran Reformation. At the time of Martin Luther they sounded the protest against the sale of indul gences. An attitude of mind — not the demands of the Roman Church — was predicated by the dissenters as the requisite for salva tion. Such could, of course, not possibly have been the sense of Hab. 2:4. The word 'Emunah means not faith in the sense of belief but faith in the sense of reliance.19 The original import appears to have been that some military disaster was impending but that, as a divine reward for his trust in God, the upright person would escape with his life. The meaning generated by the Lutheran Reformation was distinctly a meaning unmeant by the biblical author. A memorable instance of unmeant meanings presents itself in the Union Union Prayer Book, Volume II, page 84, edition of 1945. The passage reads : All ye dwellers on earth, when the Shofar is sounded, hark ye, and when the great trumpet is blown, come ye and worship the Lord at the holy mountain. The Lord of hosts shall be a shield unto you. 16 Cambridge B, Int. Crit. Com. 17 Infra p. 114. 18 Marti H, Nowack H, Int. Crit. Com., New Century Bible. 1י The Kahana C reminds us that 'Emunah means not pistis or fides but fidelity, reliability. The Cambridge B and the New Century Bible remind us that Hebrew has no word for "faith" in the sense of adherence to a creed. This apparently differs from the Marti H which translates: "Wird durch seinen Glauben leben."</page><page sequence="6">104 ABRAHAM CRONBACH [6] Though reminiscent of the traditional blowing of the ram's horn, the passage is, on the Jewish New Year, sung by the choir in the Reform Temples to ravishingly beautiful music. The cornet obligato, with the organ accompaniment, is unforgettably moving. In the prayer book the passage looks like a quotation from Scripture and reads like a declaration of universalism. But what the sublime response sings is not the same as that which the Bible says. The prayer book cites here not one biblical verse but three: "Ye dwellers on earth . . . when the Shofar is sounded" comes from Isa. 18:3. But this refers to nothing benign. It refers to the terrifying military power of Egypt. "They shall come . . . and they shall worship the Lord in the holy mountain" stands in Isa. 27:13 where "they" refers not to the "dwell ers on earth" but to the people of Israel who are "dispersed in the land of Egypt" and "lost in the land of Assyria." "The Lord of hosts will be a shield unto them" (not "you") stands in Zech. 9:15 where "them" refers not to the "dwellers on earth" but to "thy sons, 0 Zion." The unequivocally nationalistic is rendered superbly universalistic by those opening words, "All ye dwellers on earth," taken from a totally different, completely irrelevant, context. In the Orthodox, the traditional, source of that Reform paragraph, Isa. 18:3, Isa. 27:13, and Zech. 9:15, while quoted contiguously, do not merge into an integrated theme. They merely belong to a list of Bible verses re lated to one another in no way except that every verse contains the word "Shofar." It is out of this that there has been distilled what an exquisite unmeant meaning! Harriet Beecher Stowe was the author of a hymn which begins: Still,Still,Still, still with Thee, When purple morning breaketh, When the bird waketh, And the shadows flee; Fairer than morning, Lovelier than daylight, Dawns the sweet consciousness, I am with Thee. The cue to that hymn is Ps. 139:18. Assuming that Heqizoti is de rived from a root quz, "to awaken," the verse is translated: "When I awake I am still with thee";20 the interpretation being that, while ' Thus translated in LXX, Luther, Spanish of De Reina (1569), AV, RV,</page><page sequence="7">[7] UNMEANT MEANINGS OF SCRIPTURE 105 pondering God's wonders, the Psalmist fell asleep. Then, upon awakening, he found his mind still thus occupied. Assuming that HeqizotiHeqizoti is derived from qazaz, to make an end,21 the verse has been translated: "When I come to the end of them, I am still with thee," meaning that the thought of God's marvels persists with the Psalmist beyond the end of all other thoughts. Neither context anticipates the fervent mysticism of Harriet Beecher Stowe. That hymn by Harriet Beecher Stowe is redolent with unmeant meanings. Again we recall how, in old-fashioned Jewish circles, people quote Prov. 10:2 and 11:4, Zedaqah tazzil mimaweth. The Bible alludes to righteous conduct in general and to some future Day of Judgment.22 Post-biblical usage employs the word Zedaqah for righteousness of a specific kind, namely, that of almsgiving.23 In popular quotation the statement accordingly asserts that almsgiving will be divinely re warded by the lengthening of the almsgiver's life. The death men tioned is not the death to be decreed on some eschatological day of doom but death as an ordinary occurrence. When the verse in Prov erbs serves to say that the giving of charity will prolong one's life, we obviously perceive another unmeant meaning. It is supposed that the adage, "As one thinketh in his heart so is he," derives from Prov. 23 7.24 But Prov. 23:7 envisages a different thought. Prov. 23:7 refers to the stingy host who urges the guest to partake of more food and drink, but urges it grudgingly and insin cerely. The Jewish Publication Society's version renders the verse: For as one reckoneth within himself, so is he: 'Eat and drink,' saith he to thee; But his heart is not with thee. That is by no means identical with observing that "as one thinketh in his heart so is he." Detachment from the context generates that memorable aphorism as an unmeant meaning.

The Kahana C pauses to ex plain that Zedaqah does not mean "alms"; it is the equivalent of δικαιοσύνη and the antithesis of Ozroth Resha' in Prov. 10:2a. In its Aramaic form Zidqah, it means "alms" in Dan. 4:24. 2323 In the De Reina Spanish translation it reads: "cual es su pensiamento en su alma, tel es el," just like our adage.</page><page sequence="8">106 ABRAHAM CRONBACH [8] 2. Latitude of Translation A number of unmeant meanings ensue from certain latitudes of trans lation. The recurring example is the translation of the tetragram maton as "The Lord." Whether one says "The Lord" or says "Yahweh" (or whatever the correct vocalization may be), the differ ence is fundamental. The polytheistic and the anthropomorphic im plications of the proper noun "Yahweh" cannot be ignored. In rendering "The Lord" we gain an unmeant meaning of extraordinary consequence. Gen. 12:3 is commonly translated: "In thee shall all families of the earth be blessed." This translation imparts that Abraham is to foster a religious commitment which all nations of the earth will eventually adopt, and adopt to their advantage.25 The reasons for rejecting this interpretation are assembled in the Nowack Hand kommentar.kommentar. It is shown there that the passage does not pertain to anything missionaristic. What the passage asserts is that the career of Abraham will be marked by such happiness and accomplishment that people everywhere, when wishing themselves felicity, will men tion Abraham as the model which they yearn to duplicate.26 This conception is that adopted by the Revised Standard Version which reads: "By you all families of the earth will bless themselves."27 If this articulates the original sense of the passage, the customary translation, with its missionaristic import, becomes another unmeant meaning.28 In the Union Prayer Book and in the Jewish Publication Society's version, Exod. 15:11 is translated: "Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the mighty?" Were the translation precise, it would read: "Who among the gods is like unto thee, O Yahweh?"2« Those Jewish translations reverently efface the polytheism which the biblical author found not at all objectionable.30 Another unmeant meaning! 23 This is explicated, for example, in Ecclus. 44:21 ; Gal. 3:8; Acts 3:25. 2626 Also stated in the Int. Crit. Com. and Bible for Home and School. Marti H refers to Gen. 48:20; Jer. 29:22. New Century Bible refers to Gen. 18:18; 28:14. 27 The New JPS words it similarly. 28 The Kahana C, referring to Isa. 19:24; Zech. 8:13; Ps. 21:7; 37:26; Prov. 10:7, says that the verse admits of both interpretations. Similarly the Cambridge B which refers to Gen. 22:18, 26:4, 48:20, and Ps. 72:14. If this conclusion be cor rect, we shall have to remove this verse from our list of unmeant meanings. 27 Cambridge B. 30 In all the Christian translations, the word is "gods," also, with few excep tions, "Lord." Among the exceptions are RV which, instead of "Lord," reads "Jehovah," and the Nowack H which reads "Jahve." The New JPS renders: "Who</page><page sequence="9">[9J UNMEANT MEANINGS OF SCRIPTURE 107 Isa. 26:3 has been translated: "Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee."31 But there are other renderings. The Septuagint words it: "Let the nation enter that keeps righteous ness and keeps truth, supporting truth and keeping peace." Luther's translation reads: "Du erhàltst stets Frieden nach gewisser Zusage." The Marti Handkommentar prefers: "Unversehrt (in Gliick und Heil) bewahrst du wahrhaften Sinn unerschutterlich fest." The Nowack Handkommentar Handkommentar has it: "Getreue Denkart gedenkst du mit Heil." The Cambridge Bible says: "A steadfast disposition thou guardest in constant peace." The Kahana commentary paraphrases the verse into a modern Hebrew which states: "Thou wilt keep in perfect peace the mind of the righteous who relies upon and reclines upon thee."32 Yet another exegete regards, as the subject of tizzor, the word 'Ir of the preceding verse, thus making the passage mean: "She (the city), in a firm spirit, preserves peace."33 Aptly does the Nowack Hand kommentarkommentar observe that the varied interpretations are so numerous as to require a prohibitive amount of space. If any of those conjectures touches the original sense of the verse, the customary translation becomes an unmeant meaning. In terms of modern psychology, life does bring moments of serenity — moments so rare and precious that inevitably we identify them with Divinity. This fact supplies one of the most imposing thoughts sponsored by religion: the unmeant meaning resident in the words: "Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee." Ps. 8:5 has been translated: "Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels."34 The word rendered "angels" is Elohim which normally means "God" or "gods."35 Like the word "mighty" in Exod. 15:11, "angels" is evidently a euphemism; its motivation, a theological scruple.36 We have another unmeant meaning. is like you, O Lord, among the celestials?" All of which translations aim, of course, at presenting the original sense. ג■ Spanish of De Reina, AV, RV, RSV, JPS. An AV footnote renders it: "whose imagination" or "whose thought." An RV note renders it: "whose imagination." מ The Kahana C refers to Ps. 112:8, 14. 33 The late Professor Eugen Taeubler. 34 LXX, AV, JPS, RV footnote. 3s "God" is the rendering in RSV, Nowack H, and Marti H, also in the New Century Century Bible which observes that "God" is indicated by the attendant reference to Gen. 1:26. 3® Luther translates Ps. 8:6: "Du wirst ihn lassen eine kleine Zeit von Gott verlassen sein." An unmeant meaning à outrance! "Angels" is the word in LXX, Vulgate, Targum, Syriac, and AV. "God" is the word in Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion.</page><page sequence="10">108 ABRAHAM CRONBACH [10] Ps. 15:4 is commonly translated: "He that sweareth to his own hurt and changeth not." But some translations read: "He that sweareth to his friend (or "to his neighbor" or "to another") and changeth not."37 The view has furthermore been advanced that lehara'lehara' is an abbreviation of lehara' 0 lehetiv which, as in Lev. 5:4, means "to anything whatsoever," "good" and "bad" being all inclusive — its import, "everything in the world."38 If either of these latter interpretation revives the sense of the original, the bold altruism of "sweareth to his own hurt and changeth not" emerges as another unmeant meaning. The Authorized Version translates Ps. 19:13b, 14: Cleanse thou me from secret faults. Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins. But the word translated "cleanse me" is naqqeni which is a juridical term meaning to acquit in a law court.39 With that import the sense would be not that of purification from unrighteous urges but that of a a verdict exempting from punishment. The word translated "pre sumptuous sins" is zedim which means not presumptuous sins but presumptuous people.40 If these strictures are valid, the inwardness of the translation in the Authorized Version and those like it, did not characterize the original. That inwardness would constitute an un meant meaning. זג LXX, Syriac, Luther, Cambridge B, Int. Crit. Com. One commentator main tains that "to his friend" would have to be lere'ehu. 38 Marti H, Int. Crit. Com. and Kahana C substantiate this by reference to Gen. 3:5; Aquila and Theodotion by reference to Gen. 24:50; Lev. 5:4; 27:10, 33; Num. 24:13: The Cambridge B by reference to Lev. 5:4 and Num. 24:13. Lev. 5:4 and Num. 24:13 are also the reference of Le Bible, L'ancien Testament, Bibliothèque de la Pléiade, (1956). The Marti H surmises that lehetiv is omitted in Ps. 15:4 be cause there is no need of saying that a person fulfils his oath if doing so is to his advantage. יג In accord with "cleanse thou me" is the LXX and the Spanish of De Reina, also of Luther who renders "Verzeihe mir." "Vergib" is the word in Das Alte Testa ment ment Deutsch (Gôttingen, 1950). The juridical sense resides in the rendering of the Cambridge Cambridge B: "Acquit me. Do not hold me guilty"; also in the "clear me" of RV, RSV, JPS, Int. Crit. Com., and Nowack H. The Kahana C proposes: "Do not judge me adversely"; "pronounce me innocent." The Marti H reads: "Erklare mich fiir rein," and then makes some comments about a casuistic and complicated legalism. The New Century Bible comments: "The Psalmist prays that he may not be held guilty with respect to such wandering desires." 40 "Presumptuous sins" is the rendering of De Reina, RV, RSV, JPS, Int.

But "soul" removes the utterance from the imagery of the shepherd and his sheep. The Nowack Handkommentar keeps within the picture by translating "Fiihrt mich zuriick."42 In fact the dictionary tells us that "In many cases נפש serves (as airos) only for an emphatic or fuller expression of the pronoun as in Ps. 3:3; Isa. 51:23."43 Likewise external to the pastoral imagery is the word "righteous ness." Various versions accordingly translate: "He leadeth me in straight paths" (or "in right tracks").44 "Soul" and "righteousness" may miss the intent of the ancient author. But the unmeant meanings which they embody have enthralled mankind. In that same Psalm "shadow of death" translates the word Zalmaweth.45Zalmaweth.45 Scholars are virtually unanimous in holding that Zal mawethmaweth does not mean "shadow of death." Zalmaweth is not a com pound of Zel, a shadow, and Maweth, death. Zalmaweth derives from a root zalam which means "to be dark." Zalmaweth means "dense darkness."46 Numerous Hebrew proper nouns are, like "Jeremiah," "Obadiah," "Jerubaal," combinations of two words. But it appears that, in Hebrew, common nouns are not compounded.47 Beliya'al looks like an exception.

It is therefore not likely that Zalmaweth is a compound word. ZalmawethZalmaweth seems to represent a variant of the ending uth, which ap pears in such abstract nouns as Demuth, 'Avduth, Malkhuth, Almanuth, Peduth.Peduth.The gripping reference to death in Ps. 23:4 arrives as another unmeant meaning.51 According to the commentators, the phrase "beauty of holiness" crystallized also from a latitude of translation.52 A number of versions read: "Worship the Lord in holy array" or "in holy attire."55 It is explained that the ministrants in heaven are pictured as clothed like the priests on earth. If that be the original sense of the passage, the enchanting phrase "beauty of holiness" would also exemplify an unmeant meaning.54 Ps. 84:8 is commonly translated: "They go from strength to strength." But the word Ifayil, translated "strength," ordinarily means "an armed force." Luther renders: "Sie erhalten einen Sieg nach dem anderen." A footnote in the Authorized Version proposes: "from company to company." The Kahana Commentary renders it: "They go from place to place." Should any of these divergent render ings bring back to us the original intent, those oft-quoted words, "from strength to strength," would have to be accounted an unmeant meaning due to latitude of translation.

There are versions which render Ps. 127:2: "He giveth His be loved sleep."57 Elizabeth Barrett Browning's tender poem "The Sleep" is based on this translation: His dews drop mutely on the hill, His cloud above it saileth still, Though on its slope men sow and reap ; More softly than the dew is shed, Or cloud is floated overhead, He giveth his beloved — sleep. But such is not the import of the biblical passage. A more precise translation would read: "He supplieth His beloved while they sleep."58 The thought is like that of Prov. 10:22 and Matt. 6:28 that life's boons are acquired only with the aid of the Most High.59 Even more differentiated is the rendering of the Marti Handkommentar: "Genug gibt er seinem Liebling," in which Ken is understood as "sufficiency," "enough," and Shena is regarded as a gloss or as a "Variante zu ShebetShebet vom Rande eingedrungen." Thus it happened that, from an unmeant meaning, Mrs. Browning derived the incentive for her touching poem.

Again an unmeant meaning! We have previously noticed how, by an unmeant meaning effected through separation from the context, Prov. 23:7 has yielded the aphorism, "As one thinketh in his heart so is he."63 But that is not the only factor. Translation also plays a role. A footnote in the Re vised vised Standard Version apprises us that the Hebrew is obscure. The New New Century Bible, upon translating the passage, appends that the translation is, by no means, certain. The International Critical Com mentarymentary lists a variety of renderings. Some of the translations are astonishing. The Septuagint thinks it means: "He eats and drinks as if any one should swallow a hair." Luther renders it: "Denn wie ein Gespenst ist er inwendig." Our aphorism thus owes its existence also to that prolific source of unmeant meanings: latitude of translation. "Though he slay me, yet will I trust in Him." Such, according to most versions, is the profession of the Qeré to Job 13:15.64 But the Cambridge Cambridge Bible reminds us that Delitzsch translates the passage: "Behold, he will slay me. I wait for him," that is, I wait for his final stroke. If that sinister expectation rested in the mind of the original author, an unmeant meaning resounds in the brave words of the usual renderings. The noted utterance, "I know that my Redeemer liveth," stands in Job 19:25. The word translated "Redeemer" is Go'el, a word sus ceptible of varied definitions.65 More recent translations offer not the 61 Luther, Nowack H, JPS. Marti H holds that the translation "He addeth no sorrow with it" would require 'aleha (Jer. 45:3) instead of 'immah. Int. Crit.

Com. regards as the original reading "He addeth no sorrow with it" and rejects as the original "toil addeth nothing thereto" on the ground that "such a sharp separation between man's work and God's work is hardly an O.

For those who maintain the original to have been "He addeth no sorrow therewith," "toil addeth nothing thereto" would be the unmeant meaning.

According to the com mentators, the thought is that, in the debate between Job and his visitors, God will one day intervene, proving that Job is right and his interlocutors wrong.66 That makes "Vindicator" the appropriate expression. The scope of "Redeemer" is more general than that of "Vindicator." The English word "Redeemer," as applied to the Deity, embraces rescue from evils of all kinds, even from that of mortality. "Vindicator" alludes only to Job's hoped-for dominance in his debate. If "Vindicator" is the original meaning, "Redeemer" is the colossal unmeant meaning. The Authorized Version translates Eccles. 3:21: "Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?"67 Most other versions translate it: "Who knoweth the spirit of man whether it goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast whether it goeth downward to the earth?"68 This way of translating is not precluded by the full vowel under the ה in ha'olahha'olah and hayoredeth. Referring to Lev. 10:19; Num. 16:22; Isa. 27:7! Job 23:6, some scholars apprise us that there are instances in which the interrogative ה takes the full vowel and not the FLatef, the half-vowel. The hopeful sentiment of the Authorized Version would then be an unmeant meaning, while the original purport would re side in the skepticism of the other renderings. ness. Similar is the rendering of Marti H and of the New Century Bible. The LXX gives the unique translation: "I know that he is eternal who is about to deliver me." Go'el can mean an avenger (Num. 35:12, 19; Deut. 19:6, 12). Sometimes it means a ransomer (Lev. 25). Sometimes it means a kinsman with certain marital obligations (Ruth 3 and 4). When applied to God it means a deliverer (Isa. 43, 44, 47,48,63; Ps. 19) or a defender (Josh. 20:3; II Sam. 14:11; I Kings 16:11; Ps. 119:154; Prov. 23:11). 66 "It is important not to read into the term 'Redeemer' any of its Christian sense. 'Vindicator' manifests Job's universe, related to Job 16:18, 19 where Job names God as his witness" (Cambridge B). "The meaning 'Vindicator' is the sense required. It is not redemption from She'ol but the clearing of his fame to which Job looks forward. We must not translate 'deliverer' or 'redeemer.' " (New Century Bible).Bible). The Kahana C says it means: "One who argues on my side and pleads my cause and rescues me from your arguments."

The Translator's Punctuation Unmeant meanings sometimes issue from the peculiarities of the translator's punctuation. Let us refer again to Isa. 1:18.69 What a difference it makes whether Isa. 1:18 terminates with a period or with a question mark! The passage as an assertion reads: Though your sins be as scarlet, They shall be white as snow; Though they be red like crimson, They shall be as wool. As an interrogation, it would read: If your sins be as scarlet, Shall they be white as snow? If they be red like crimson, Shall they be as wool? The likelihood of an interrogation is perceived by the Nowack Hand kommentarkommentar which points out that a non-interrogatory sense of the passage would leave nothing about which to "reason together."70 "Wenn Jahve sie vergeben wollte, so bedtirfte es keines Disputierens." The customary rendering signifies that forgiveness is possible no matter how grievous the sin. If the passage was interrogatory at its inception, the source of the heartening prospect was not the prophet but the translator, whose translation would hold a meaning decidedly unmeant. A well-known example of an unmeant meaning arises in Isa. 40:3 which various versions translate: "The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness."71 Such also is its wording in Matt. 3:5; Mark 1:3; Luke 3:4; John 1:23. Other translations read: "The voice of one that crieth: 'Prepare ye in the wilderness the way of the Lord,' "72 the phrase "in the wilderness" modifying not the verb "crieth" but the verb "pre pare." "The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness" is needed in 69 Supra p. 103. "&gt; Wellhausen also regards it as a question (Pro/.5 p. 423). The Int. Crit. Com. concedes that "the interrogative interpretation, though grammatically question able, would accord with prophetic teaching." The New Century Bible dissents, in sisting that there is no sign of an interrogation. Also dissenting is the Int. Crit. Com.Com. which quotes an authority as saying "No clear case occurs throughout the O. T. in which the question is assumed to be implied in the speaker's tone (without the use of an interrogative particle)." 1י LXX, Luther, De Reina, AV, RV footnote. מ RV, RSV, J PS, Nowack H.</page><page sequence="17">[17] UNMEANT MEANINGS OF scripture 115 the New Testament to fulfill the image of John the Baptist. That meaning was, of course, not the meaning of the Old Testament author. An article which appeared in the Hebrew Union College Annual73 proposes a different punctuation — this time, Hebrew punctuation — for the oft-quoted remark in Amos 7:14, "I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son." That noted retort was an unmeant meaning if the conjecture is valid that what Amos really said was: "No! I am indeed a Navi (prophet), but not a Ben Navi (professional prophet)." Amos, according to that new construction, does not deny that he was a prophet. He denies that he was a prophet in the sense of being a professional prophet, a prophet for hire. He insists that he was a prophet of a different type, a prophet in the sense of having been truly and divinely called to his mission. If this be the burden of the passage in its origin, the familiar understanding of the passage comes to us as another unmeant meaning. For a third time we must mention Prov. 23:7 and the aphorism "As one thinketh in his heart so is he." We found that the aphorism resulted not only from quotation out of context but also from latitude of translation.74 There remains to be noted a third feature, namely, that of the translator's punctuation. The Nowack Handkommentar reads : Denn nachdem er in seiner geizigen Seele berechnet hat, so spricht er zu dir: 'iss und trink.' Our aphorism treats the first part of that deliverance not as a sub ordinate clause but as a complete sentence in its own right. The English equivalent would be : Greedily reckoning within his soul, thus he saith to thee 'eat and drink.' The aphorism is created by terminating the sentence with the word "he," and inserting "is." If the Handkommentar has caught the original intent of the passage, the divergent punctuation of the trans lator becomes yet a third of the devices which produce the unmeant meaning of our celebrated adage. 4. Changes of Hebrew Vocalization Sometimes the unmeant meaning sprouts from modifications of Hebrew vowels. A recurring instance is the Nif'al of the verb ra'ah in such passages as Exod. 23:15, 17; 34:23, 24; Deut. 16:16; Ps. 42:3. מ Simon Cohen, "Amos Was a Navi," HUCA, Vol. XXXII (1961), p. 177.

The original author may not have been troubled by that consideration.76 A similar scruple may have influenced the vocalization of the tetragrammaton. It is not difficult to discern resistance to anthropo morphism and to polytheism77 in the substitution of the common noun Adonay for the proper noun Yahweh78 (or whatever the original vocalization of the tetragrammaton may have been). The familiar Adonay,Adonay, "the Lord" in English, became long ago an unmeant mean ing.ing. We have already dwelt upon the unmeant meaning in "the shadow of death" translating Zalmaweth of Ps. 23:4.79 The Marti Hand kommentarkommentar maintains that, like Demuth, Peduth, 'Almanuth and the like, Zalmuth was the vocalization originally.80 Someone has surmised that the vocalization Zalmaweth aimed, by its suggestion of death, to enhance the word's impressiveness. Ps. 84:8 (7) is customarily translated "They go from strength to strength."81 But, citing II Sam. 20:15, I Kings 21:23; Ps. 48:14; and Lam. 2:8, some would change the vocalization from mehayil el hayil to mehel el heZ2 and translate "from walled city to walled city" 83 or 75 Int. Crit. Com. on Deut. 16:16, Das Alte Testament Deutsch and Kahana C on Ps. 42:3. 76 On Ps. 42:3 Int. Crit.

The Ndtscher edition observes: " 'Erscheinen' weil Gott mit leiblichen Augen schauen als unzulàssig und lebensgefahrlich gilt" (cf. Gen. 32:31; Exod. 33:20). Cambridge B states that "this was changed since (Exod. 33:20) man cannot literally see God." Cf. also I Sam. 1:22; Isa. 1:12. 77 Other theories have been advanced such as that of protecting the Deity from sorcery, the operation of which required the pronunciation of the victim's name. 78 It has been maintained that, in the course of time, the tetragrammaton ceased to be a proper name and got to be the equivalent of Elohim, "God."

That cherished expression about going "from strength to strength" would accordingly become another unmeant meaning due to change of vowels.86 Ps. 106:32b is rendered: "It went ill with Moses for their sakes"87 or "It went ill with Moses because of them"88 or "It went ill with Moses on their account."89 Yet the Syriac version reads not wayera' "It went ill" but wayara' "He did ill."90 As in Num. 11:11, God is, according to the Syriac, represented as injuring Moses. If the Syriac preserves the original reading, the masoretic vocalization would introduce an unmeant meaning prompted by the qualm, like that connected with Ps. 8:6 or Ps. 104:26, to avoid an unworthy concep tion of the Deity. We have already considered Eccles. 3:21 and its differing transla tions.91 Some see, behind those different translations, a difference in the Hebrew vocalization. They would read not דזעולה and ןזי1ךךת but העולה and היוךךת, changing the full vowel of the interrogative ה into the usual half-vowel. Geiger and Gesenius are mentioned among those who held that, for dogmatic reasons, the vocalization was altered. That would make the present instance a case of unmeant meaning brought about by change of vowels. 5."5. Consonantal Changes Unmeant meanings burgeon also from changes of the Hebrew con sonants.

While these assumptions are homiletic and of little consequence in gauging the primary structure of the verse, they do nonetheless intimate a divergence from the customary rendering. 8ז AV, RV, Nowack H, Int.

That projects, of course, a distinctly unmeant meaning. Judg. 8:4 offers the picturesque phrase "faint yet pursuing."93 The Septuagint reads not rodefim, "pursuing," but re'evim, "hungry" which, in view of the reference to food in the next verse was, in all likelihood, the original.94 The fascinating words, "faint yet pursuing," would in that event also illustrate unmeant meaning. We have noted the unintended thought lurking in Isa. 26:3, "Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee."95 We noted the unmeant meaning which may have been created by that translation. Here we note an attempt to restore the original text by means of emendations. The Kittel edition, basing itself upon the Hexapla, reads not Yezer but Yizro, with reference to the Goy zaddiq of the verse preceding. "Because its attitude is trustful, Thou wilt keep it in peace." The promised peace thus becomes destined for the righteous nation. That would additionally make the customary trans lation an unmeant meaning. The emendation further deletes the second Shalom. Assuming that these emendations restore the original reading, the masoretic text of this verse becomes itself an unmeant meaning on which is based the further unmeant meaning of the translation. The masoretic wording of Ezek. 3:12 is commonly translated: "Blessed be the glory of the Lord from his place."96 But again there has supervened an emendation. By the change of one letter, barukh has been altered to read berum which gives the meaning: "As the glory of the Lord arose from its place." The Nowack Handkommentar calls this "one of the most brilliant conjectures ever attempted with regard to the Old Testament, and one which has been accepted by virtually all modern scholars."97 According to this emendation, the original sense of those words was a somber one. They enunciated Ezekiel's doctrine that, in retribution for Israel's sins, God no longer note 38. The Bible for Home and School instances Judg. 2:1; 6:11, 14,20; 13:3.

Ascending from that Temple, He left Jerusalem exposed to the foe.98 By contrast, the sense of the verse in its masoretic form is a joyous one. Words bearing originally an ominous import acquire, in their unmeant meaning, a happy import. This becomes especially striking when the passage appears in the liturgy. The Union Prayer Book offers as the English equivalent: "In all places of Thy dominion Thy name is praised and glorified"99 or "Praised be the glory of God in all the world"100 or "Praised be the glory of God throughout the world."101 A far cry from "As the glory of Yahweh rose from its place"! What a range of unmeant meanings! The Revised Standard Version translates Ps. 16:3: "As for the saints in the land, they are the noble, in whom is all My delight." The rendering of several other versions is approximately the same.102 But, following the Septuagint, various translators emend the text to read: Ya'adir Yahweh kol Hefzo ham, with the resultant translation: "The Lord will exalt the saints in the land: in them is all His de light."103 Others render: "As for the saints in the land, whom Yahweh honors, in them is all My delight"—that or approximately that.104 Also: "To the saints who are in the land (Yahweh) makes wonderful all His good pleasure in them."105 If any of these emendations brings back the original reading, the masoretic text holds an unmeant meaning. For the humanistically inclined, that unmeant meaning would be the superior meaning. It speaks in terms of human interests and endeavors, while the theo logical language of the purportedly original might, by comparison, seem time-worn. We have noticed the unmeant meaning contained in the phrase, "the beauty of holiness,"106 the outcome of translating the word 8י Cf. Ezek. 8:6; 9:3; 10:4; 10:18; 11:23.

If any of these surmises is valid, the author of Ps. 73, like most of the Old Testament authors, would not be professing a belief in a here after. That belief would have found its way into Psalm 73 only as an unmeant meaning. Prov. 11:30 is translated: "He that winneth souls is wise"121 or "He that is wise winneth souls."122 But these translations have been questioned.125 On the basis of Prov. 1:19 it is pointed out that Loqeah NefashothNefashoth has a sinister import. It does not mean the attracting or the persuading of people; it means the taking of lives. Various trans lators accept the emendation of Hakham "wise one," into Hamas, "violence," as hinted in the Septuagint. The upshot is: "Lawlessness takes away lives"124 or "Rapine destroys lives."125 If that emendation rehabilitates the original text, we surely acquire an unmeant meaning in the attractive thought, "He that winneth souls is wise" or "He that is wise winneth souls." Prov. 14:32 is translated: "The righteous hath hope in his death,"126 "The righteous has hope even in his death,"127 "The right eous hath a refuge in his death,"128 "The righteous, even when he is brought to his death hath hope."12« But the Septuagint and the Syriac read not bemotho, "in his death." They read bethumo, "in his integ rity."150 The Revised Standard Version, like the Nowack Handkom mentar,mentar, translates accordingly: "The righteous finds refuge through his integrity." If bethumo is the original reading, that intimation of immortality belongs not to the original but to the unmeant. We have, in another connection, pondered Job 13:15: "Though he 120 Sheldon H.

Marti H apprises us that bethumo rests on Aquila, Symmachus, Theodotion, and Targum. That statement is incorrect as regards the Targum which reads למאת•</page><page sequence="24">122 ABRAHAM CRONBACH [24] slay me, yet will I trust in him."131 This rendering follows the Qeré. Yet scholars point out that the subsequent words show the original reading to have been not the pronominal 10 of the Qeré but the neg ative 10 of the Ketiv.132 The acceptable translations run: "Ja, er wird mich tôten, ich hoffe auf nichts,"133 "Sieh, er wird mich doch erwurgen, und ich kann es nicht erwarten,"134 "Sieh, er tôtet mich, ich hielt's nicht aus,"I3s "Behold, he will slay me, I have no hope,"136 "If he killeth me'—well and good! I have nothing to hope for."137 There is virtually a consensus among scholars that the Ketiv carries the original reading. The Qeré would thus become the unmeant meaning. And what a profound meaning! Among the foremost ob jects of religion is the reminder that, whatever life's adversities, there remains forever the possibility of some happier hour later on. "Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him." Those towering words grew out of that experience. Our final illustration is Job 36:15 translated: "He delivereth the afflicted by their affliction and openeth their ear by adversity."138 This has been explained as referring to "the redemptive power of misfortune and suffering,"139 especially by reason of the ensuing re pentance.140 "Die Ziichtigung des Menschen durch Leiden ist fiir ihn heilsam, wenn er sich bekehrt, so rettet sie ihn vor dem Untergange."141 "God uses the suffering inflicted on men by their fellowmen as a means of delivering and instructing sufferers who receive suffering in the right temper."142 This relates the passage to the educative effect of pain and sorrow — a thought pre-eminent in all advanced religions. There is, nonetheless, a dissenting voice. The late Moses Butten wieser, following the Vulgate, reads instead of Oznam, Ozno, "His ear," that is, God's ear.143 As Dr. Buttenwieser understands the passage, its author wrote: 131 Supra p. 112. 132 The New Century Bible, Kahana C, Nôtscher edition, Buttenwieser. !33 Nowack H. 134 Luther. «5 Marti H. 136 RV, RSV. 13' Moses Buttenwieser, The Book of Job (New York, 1925), The Kahana C regards the 10 ayahel as an explanatory note, and the preceding words as an aposio pesis. 138 RSV and approximately the same are: RV, JPS, Luther, De Reina, Marti H, Int.Int.

The thought then becomes the familiar one of heavenly rescue from calamity. If that restores the text to what it was at the outset, the exalted spiritual note of the masoretic utterance proffers another un meant meaning. ******* When we recognize these unmeant meanings, we do not belittle the Bible.144 On the contrary, those unintended insights count among the Bible's finest assets. Sacred literature must show some distinctive traits that make it sacred. Why may not one of those traits be just that capacity for endowing one and the same verse with more than one denotation? Jewish tradition comports with such a view. The Judaism of the past has long imputed to biblical passages four levels of interpréta tion : the Peshat, the Derush, the Remez, and the Sod — the plain meaning, the homiletic meaning, the hinted meaning, and the cryptic meaning. That classification does not, to be sure, coincide with the distinctions traced in this article. It does nevertheless demonstrate that Judaism finds it not at all incompatible with sacredness for a verse of the Bible to be imbued with more than one signification. Consider also the Tiqqune SoferimP5 Are these not the same as our unmeant meanings in everything but the name? As a rule, the unmeant meanings constitute what we of today deem the loftier meanings. One might hesitate to challenge the con ten tion — should such contention ever be voiced — that the unmeant meanings of Scripture rank among Scripture's foremost treasures. '■« LXX and the Targumim abound in translations whose meanings diverge widely from those of the masoretic text. In order not to become unwieldy, our present study had to exclude these areas. Gen. Rab. 49:12. J. D. Eisenstein, Ozar Yisra'el, III, 158. For example, "Abraham stood before the Lord" (Gen. 18:22) is a Tiqqun Soferim for "The Lord stood before Abraham," because of the double sense of "stood before" which can mean "to stand in the service of." Other examples are: Gen. 11:12; Num. 11:151 12:13; I Sam. 3:13; I Kings 21:13; Ezek. 8:17; Zech. 2:12; Job 1:5; 2:9. Num. 11:15 substitutes "my wretchedness" for "Thy wretchedness." I Sam. 3:13 substitutes "a curse upon themselves" for "a curse upon God." Ezek. 8:17 substitutes "the branch to their nose" for "the branch to My nose." Zech. 2:12 substitutes "the apple of his eye" for "the apple of Mine eye." The word "bless" is at various places substituted for the word "curse."</page></plain_text>
