<plain_text><page sequence="1">166 The uses of cover-chewing Esmay CKHiggins enlists the help of some young reviewers A familiar book can be a very useful thing if you are stuck with a two-year-old in a waiting room, at a church service or on a journey. The child has oppor tunities for pointing, looking, discussing, page-turning, cover-chewing and finally floor-throwing and retrieving. These situations may well lay the basis for his understanding that books are things to be enjoyed, shared, rejected? generally speaking that they have potential. These are good lessons and need to be learned at home because the child's first books in primary school are no fun at all, being peopled by a terrible pair of woodeners called Ann and Barry. In recent years there has been a terrific growth in books for young children. Some cover specific topics such as going to the doctor or going into hospital, asthma, men tal handicap, the arrival of a new baby? even potty-training. Although Waddell's books do not quite fit into this category, several of them treat such things as the dark or staying with grandparents (the best book I have come across on the latter subject is Nicholas and Finnegan by Sybil Marshall, from Puffin). The Park in the Dark. Martin Waddell, illustrated by Barbara Firth. Walker Books. 30 pp Stg?6.95 0-7445-0716-2. Three soft toys go for a trip to the park at night, which is a bit frightening. They dash home to the warmth and security of the little girl's bed and fall asleep. Good bed time reading; reassuring too, because the child knows exactly what has frightened the animals. (2-5) We Love Them. Martin Waddell, illus trated by Barbara Firth. Walker Books. 28 pp Stg?5.95 0-7445-1278-6. In this book too it is the children who are in command, but this time they are caring for pets. Ben is a family dog and Zoe is a baby rabbit found in the wild. Then Ben dies ?and Zoe goes off her greens for a while! Then another companion turns up. A sensi tive account, dealing with two difficult things: both the losing and the replacing of pets. (2-5) AN LEANBH NUA The arrival of a new baby?one of a new series, 'Na Chead ImeachtaC, from Gill &amp; Macmillan, which includes Ag Aistri? Tt and Ag Dul ar Scoil, with comic illustrations rather than the hyper-realism favoured for the Waddell books. Once There Were Giants. Martin Waddell, illustrated by Penny Dale. Walker Books. 26 pp Stg?6.95 0-7445-0484-8. I loved this book. The little girl starts as the baby, and then she grows up and has a baby of her own. One young reader pointed out that the rug on which the baby girl lies is the same one as she uses for her own baby?but is just a bit faded. The idea is simple and the drawings full of interest ing detail. (3-7, girls particularly) "Jocko, the laughing jackass, teaches Fionuala an Irish jig." Anthropomorphic animals will always be a bas tion of fantasy for the young against encroach ring realism. Fionuala the Glendalough Goat by Vera Pettigrew (160 pages of reading!) and Cornelius in Charge (a rabbit who hails from Tang) by Mary Flynn are due this month from the Children's Press, both illustrated with all Terry Myler's joy fulness, and both at ?335. Rosies Baby's. Martin Waddell, illustrated by Penny Dale. Clavis, Hasselt, Netherlands. 16 pp NPG 90-6822-079-9. There may well be an English edition, but we were sent the Dutch version. One multi talented reader was able to translate, and the pictures illustrate it beautifully. Rosie's Mum has a new baby, and while it is being fed and changed Rosie tells her all the things that her teddy and toy rabbit have done during the day?a quiet way of con sidering the amount of time new babies need. Would be enjoyed by children experi encing the situation. (3-6) My Great Grandpa. Martin Waddell, illus trated by Dom Mansell. Walker Books. 24 pp Stg?6.95 0-7445-1286-7. Great Grandpa is confined to a wheel-chair, and sometimes the old man and the great grand-daughter go out together and she pushes him along. An excellent subject, but this book does not work?1 tried it on young children and even on some of our more elderly relations, and nobody liked it. (5-7)_ Judy the Bad Fairy. Martin Waddell, illus trated by Dom Mansell. Walker Books. 30 pp Stg?5.95 0-7445-1140-2. A funny book about a contrary young sprite who only wants to loll about in the woodbine. Others feel that she should be up and doing. She does up and do, and then they are all sorry. In the end she is left to her lollings, untroubled by 'doings in the dell'. (5-7)_ Amy Said. Martin Waddell, illustrated by Charlotte Voake. Walker Books. 28 pp Stg?6.95 0-7445-1277-8. Concerns children staying with a busy grandmother. Having wreaked havoc around the place all day, they understand when Grandma finally calls a halt to their activities. A funny book. (3-6, and possibly grandmothers!) ^^^^ "77ie one throwing porridge is me" from Once There Were Giants. Books for young children can extend their perspectives on real life and still he entertaining and well within their comprehension.</page><page sequence="2">BOOKS IRELAND Octoberl990 1^7 The Hidden House. Martin Waddell, illus trated by Angela Barrett. Walker Books. 26 pp Stg?7.95 0-7445-1266-2. A little house has been abandoned. Three wooden dolls have been left sitting at the window. Time passes and the house gets overgrown and inhabited by insects and mice. It gets damp and plants start to grow inside. It has a life of its own, seen only by the three dolls. Then a family comes and restores the house and the three dolls. Beautiful pictures: you can almost feel the cobwebs and smell the fresh paint. (4-7) Saint Patrick and the Snakes. Patricia Egan, illustrated by Jim Kilgarriff. Beehive Books (Veritas Publications). 29 pp ?4.95 1 85390-059-1. A funny mixture of adult and children's humour, and everyone who read it for me found it funny. In early Christian times (as we all know) Ireland was scourged by snakes?small spiteful ones, middle-sized slimy ones and very nasty big ones whose fangs dripped with poison. As things had gone beyond a joke the chieftains asked the druids to get rid of the snakes. Having held a seminar and tried mixtures and incanta tions, they were unsuccessful. Saint Patrick is then called upon, and he manages very well?with just one exception. Children re ally liked Kilgarriff's drawings. (4-8) "I really loved it. The pictures were great" ?Jerome (8) "Quite good, but too short for ten-year olds. The drawings are very funny." ?Bernard (10) Kathus Genie. Sandra Larmour, illus trated by Maria Holland. The Women's Centre, 19 North Street Arcade, Belfast BT1 1PA. 24 pp Stg?1.20 brochure 0-948599-02-2. The blurb on the back describes it as being an "original anti-sexist children's story" which seems a bit of an overstatement. Kathy has been sent to her room for bad behaviour, and a genie appears from the cassette recorder. As happens, Kathy gets three wishes which she misuses. Then the genie takes it on herself not only to give her another wish but also to refuse to grant one. Every child knows that genies are not in a position to do either of these things. "The genie said that you don't show off with real friends. You do show off with friends; of course you do! The punchline TAgirlwith determination can do anything she wants'] is silly. It doesn't come from the story." ?Madeleine (10) Where is God? Donal CXLeary and Kath leen Dalton SC. Kerryman, Tralee. 20 pp ?2 brochure. The little boy goes along the road in search of God. Written in rhyming verse which makes it very easy to read aloud. The illus trations are poor, but the poem is good and could be used in most primary school pro grammes in Christian religion; for example it would fit in well with the Children of God programme. Proceeds go to the Kerry Par ents and Friends of the Mentally Handi capped. (4-6) "Ifs quite nice, but I wouldn't want to buy it." ?Claire (7) From Jim Kilgarriff's cover for Saint Patrick and the Snakes by Patricia Egan (see left).</page></plain_text>
