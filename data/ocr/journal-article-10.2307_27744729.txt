<plain_text><page sequence="1">History of Philosophy Quarterly Volume 14, Number 1, January 1997 WILLIAM JAMES ON FREE WILL: THE FRENCH CONNECTION Donald Wayne Viney From the time that he became acquainted with the writings of Charles Renouvier (1815-1903) until the end of his life, William James (1842-1910) held the French philosopher in the highest regard. At the heart of James's admiration were the inter related questions of free will and pluralism. James attributed his conversion from belief in determinism to belief in free will to Renouvier's influence. Furthermore, James's mature theory of free will is a development of the ideas he first learned from Renouvier. This story of Renouvier's influence on James is often repeated in treatments of James's philosophy, of which there are many in recent years (Ford, 27; Barzun, 17; Bjork, 18; Feinstein, 307; Jones, 46; Myers, 46; and Rychlak, 323). A story that is not so well-known is the story of the intellectual debt that Renouvier owed his close friend Jules Lequyer (1814 1862).x If James was generous in recognizing the influence of Renouvier, Renouvier was even more insistent on the importance of Lequyer's genius for his own philosophical maturation. More over, by Renouvier's account, Lequyer's lasting contribution to his thought was on the question of free will. What has yet to be appre ciated by the vast majority of James scholars is how Lequyer's influence on Renouvier provides a missing piece in the jigsaw of James's views on free will and determinism. To date, only a hand ful of scholars have recognized Lequyer's importance to James's views on free will (Brimmer, 475-496; Hartshorne, 60; Viney 1986, 558; Viney 1993, 260). In what follows the familiar history of James's relation to Renouvier on the question of free will is related first. Next, the influence of Lequyer on Renouvier on the same issue is traced. Finally, in a return to James, the pieces of the historical argu ment will be pieced together. We shall see that James knew of Lequyer and admired his work. Moreover, as Ralph Barton Perry 29</page><page sequence="2">30 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY averred, one must acknowledge an indirect influence of Lequyer on James through Renouvier (Perry v. I, 658). On the other hand, Perry erred when he claimed that "there is no evidence of any important direct influence" of Lequyer on James (Perry v. I, 661). It is true that nowhere in the extant documents does James credit Lequyer with his ideas on free will and determinism. However, there is evidence that James took more from Lequyer than these same documents make explicit. James and Renouvier James first read Renouvier's works during his third trip to Europe. He traveled in part to seek relief from his many health problems, but also to satisfy his curiosity about experimental physi ology, especially as it was developing in Germany (Perry v. I, 234). Near the end of his travels, in October 1868, he wrote to his father that he had read Renouvier's introduction to Fran?ois Pillon's L'Ann?e 1867 Philosophique. James praised its author as "un equaled by anyone," . . . for vigor of style and compression, going to the core of half a dozen things in a single sentence, so different from the namby pamby diffusiveness of most Frenchmen . . . (Letters v. I, 138). James continued to read Renouvier and two years later he found ideas in the Frenchman's works that would inspire him and in form his philosophy henceforth. In the now-famous journal entry of April 30, 1870 James men tions Renouvier and relates his resolve to believe in and act on the idea of his own freedom. I think that yesterday was a crisis in my life. I finished the first part of Renouvier's second "Essais" and see no reason why his definition of Free Will ? "the sustaining of a thought because I choose to when I might have other thoughts" ? need be the defini tion of an illusion. At any rate, I will assume for the present ? until next year ? that it is no illusion. My first act of free will shall be to believe in free will. For the remainder of the year, I will abstain from the mere speculation and contemplative Grublei in which my nature takes most delight, and voluntarily cultivate the feeling of moral freedom, by reading books favorable to it, as well as by acting. After the first of January, my callow skin being somewhat fledged, I may perhaps return to metaphysical study and skepticism without danger to my powers of action. For the present then remember: care little for speculation; much for the form of my action; recollect that only when habits of order are formed can we advance to really interesting fields of actions ? and consequently accumulate grain on grain of willful choice like</page><page sequence="3">WILLIAM JAMES ON FREE WILL 31 a very miser; never forgetting how one link dropped undoes an indefinite number. Principiis obsta ? Today has furnished the ex ceptionally passionate initiative which Bain posits as needful for the acquisition of habits. I will see to the sequel. Not in maxims, not in schauungen, but in accumulated acts of thought lies salva tion. Passer outre. Hitherto, when I have felt like taking a free initiative, like daring to act originally, without carefully waiting for contemplation of the external world to determine all for me, suicide seemed the most manly form to put my daring into; now, I will go a step further with my will, not only act with it, but believe as well; believe in my individual reality and creative power. My belief, to be sure, can't be optimistic ? but I will posit life (the real, the good) in the self-governing resistance of the ego to the world. Life shall [be built in] doing and suffering and creating (Letters v. I, 147-148). The mention of suicide could serve as a gauge of the gravity of James's condition as well as the importance of Renouvier's influ ence. In any event, most of the characteristic Jamesian views about free will are expressed in this passage: the primacy of the will over speculation, the location of the phenomenon of will in effort of attention, freedom's affirmation of itself, the creation of one self through cumulative action, the centrality of habit, and the doctrine of meliorism. We shall see that James borrowed much of this picture from Renouvier. Howard Feinstein argues that scholars have misinterpreted James's 1870 "crisis" as a turning point in his life. According to Feinstein, A careful reading shows that the Renouvier "crisis" was not unique, nor did it mark a change in William's beliefs, and it had no dra matic impact on his health. Furthermore, Alexander Bain, the associationist psychologist, was more important than Renouvier in James's 1870 struggles (Feinstein, 308). Feinstein is correct that James had other crises and that his health did not improve simply as a result of reading Renouvier. More over, the importance of Bain's psychology for James, especially on the question of habit, cannot be denied (James 1981 v. I, 127-131). It is an exaggeration, however, to say that Bain's influence eclipsed that of Renouvier, and it is bizarre in light of James's own testi mony to claim that the reading of Renouvier brought no change in James's beliefs. If one is to assess the influence of Renouvier on James, one must look first to James's own assessment. In March 1869 James wrote to Thomas Ward that he was "swamped in an empirical philosophy." He continued,</page><page sequence="4">32 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY I feel that we are Nature through and through, that we are wholly conditioned, that not a wiggle of our will happens save as the result of physical laws; and yet, notwithstanding, we are en rap port with reason. ? How to conceive it? Who knows? (Letters v. I, 153). This passage indicates that James was trying to reconcile a belief in determinism with the evident fact of the efficacy of rea son and will. The route often taken by determinists in James's day ? and in our own day ? is to equate significant human freedom with the freedom to act in accordance with one's aims. Manifestly, this sort of freedom is possessed by everyone, even though every "wiggle of our will" may be subject to deterministic laws. James came to reject this "soft determinism," as he called it, as a "quag mire of evasion" (James 1979, 117). He conceded that we are free in the soft determinist's sense, but he insisted that "the issue of fact" in the free will controversy is untouched by the soft determinist's legerdemain. The solution to the problem James set for himself was in Renouvier: reject determinism and locate will in effort of atten tion. Renouvier defined volition as, . . . the character of an act of consciousness which does not simply represent itself as given, but which represents itself being able or having been able to be or not to be sustained or continued, with out any other apparent change than that which links itself to the representation itself insofar as it summons or removes the repre sentation (Renouvier 1912, v. I, 194).2 Renouvier says that what makes an act voluntary is the element of effort, which can be more or less in any given case (Renouvier 1912, v. I, 196). James agreed; he maintained in The Principles of Psychology that "Effort of attention is . . . the essential phenom enon of will" (James 1981, v. II, 1167). Renouvier took the next step and identified volition so defined with freedom. "In defining the will I have defined freedom . . ." (Renouvier 1912, v. I, 198). Finally, Renouvier pinpointed what James called "the question of fact in the free will controversy" (James 1981, v. II, 1175). . . . the question [of freedom] always consists in knowing if the representations of imagination and passion are or are not preor dained in possible cases, and if the representation called voluntary is an appearance that they sometimes present; or if, furthermore it is a real act by which they are sustained when others would be able to be (Renouvier 1912, v. I, 263). This passage most closely resembles James's paraphrase in the April 1870 journal entry, "the sustaining of a thought because I choose when I might have other thoughts."</page><page sequence="5">WILLIAM JAMES ON FREE WILL 33 Contrary to Feinstein's thesis, James's reading of Renouvier made a lasting impression. In his first letter to Renouvier, dated November 2, 1872, James wrote, "Thanks to you, I possess for the first time an intelligible and reasonable conception of Freedom" (Letters, v. I, 163; emphasis mine). Four months later, in March 1873, James expressed the same sentiment to his father. Henry James Sr. reported in a letter to his son Henry that William attributed his recovery from a hypochondriacal frame of mind in part to Renouvier's vindication of the freedom of the will (Letters I, 169). James's first published statements on Renouvier continue this line of thought. An 1873 note in Nation, penned by James, praises Renouvier for saying "something original and simple" on the free will debate, to wit, that freedom's first act should be its own self affirmation (James 1987, 266). Three years later James published a review of Bain's The Emotions and the Will and Renouvier's Essais de critique g?n?rale. There is some ceremonial praise for Bain's work; for the most part, however, Bain is a foil against which Renouvier's greatness is compared. James says that while the English empirical school of Mill, Bain, and Spencer had made important contributions to psychology, it was still deterministic and materialistic. On the other hand, Renouvier at a stroke clears the [free will] question of a cloud of quibbles by stating it in simple phenomenal terms. For him it is merely a question as to the ambiguity of certain futures, those human acts, namely, which are preceded by deliberation (James 1987, 324). For Renouvier and for James, the question of the freedom of the will is whether, in any particular case, more effort of attention could have been exerted, or if, as the determinists believe, the amount of effort was exactly fixed by the antecedent conditions of the act. Bain had argued that, in fact, we expect people to act predictably, and hence we presuppose determinism. James called Bain's argument "rubbish" (James 1987, 324). James, like Renouvier, adopted the Kantian view that free will is a postulate required by the moral life. James accepted Renouvier's phenomenology of the will. In ad dition, the April 1870 journal entry makes clear that he made a conscious decision to believe in free will. He had decided that the conflict between free will and determinism could not be de cided on empirical or rational grounds. The theoretical impasse between free will and determinism would be broken by an act of the will, using a moral argument as justification. The sentiment of</page><page sequence="6">34 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY the 1870 journal entry is echoed in the review article where he quotes Renouvier as saying, "I prefer to affirm my liberty and to affirm it by means of my liberty" (James 1987, 326; Renouvier 1912, v. II, 138). Renouvier and Lequyer James was clearly indebted to his reading of Renouvier for the way he framed the basic questions about free will and determin ism. Renouvier, for his part, took no credit for the very ideas that James found so valuable. On the contrary, he insisted throughout his life that he owed his own views on free will to his friend and "master," Lequyer. William Logue suggests ? without, however, providing any evidence ? that Renouvier gave excessive credit to Lequyer for his conversion to belief in free will (Logue, 31). Be that as it may, Renouvier borrowed considerably from his friend on this question. Lequyer and Renouvier came from opposite sides of France, Lequyer from Quint?n in Brittany in the northwest, Renouvier from Montpellier in the far south. They met in 1834 while they were students at the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris and discovered that they shared a love of philosophy. Renouvier called Lequyer "one of my dearest comrades, whose passion for philosophy was no less than my own" (Renouvier 1886, v. II, 381). Lequyer left Paris in 1838, but he returned to teach at the ?cole ?gyptienne from 1843 to 1848. By this time, however, Renouvier had returned to Montpellier. From at least 1844 until Lequyer's death in 1862, the two friends kept abreast of each other's activities through correspondence (Lequier 1952, 535-551; henceforth, OC). The fortunes of the two philosophers were strikingly different. Renouvier embarked on his long and phenomenally productive career in 1842 when his first book was published. In the later part of the century, Renouvier's name became widely known, especially in France, through his multi-volume tomes. In the words of Louis Foucher: Renouvier wrote a lot. If one adds to the forty volumes published under his name, the forty volumes of the Critique philosophique, in large part edited by him, one almost has a library, to which it is still necessary to add the articles given to several reviews and especially, in the last years of his career, to the L'Ann?e philosophique edited by his friend and former collaborator, Fran?ois Pillon (Foucher, appendix, I). Marcel M?ry estimated that Renouvier wrote 25,000 pages (Logue, 20). Renouvier also busied himself translating articles and</page><page sequence="7">WILLIAM JAMES ON FREE WILL 35 books (he translated some of James's articles and he and Pillon translated Hume's Treatise). To the end he was intellectually active. Les Derniers Entretiens was dictated to his friend Louis Prat and records his thoughts as he lay dying. Lequyer, on the other hand, is an obscure figure in the intellec tual history of nineteenth century France. He was a devout, eccentric, and disturbed man who inspired fierce loyalty and ad miration in those who knew him. Nevertheless, his life was marked by setbacks, failure, squabbles, poverty, law suits, institutionaliza tion, unrequited love and unrealized dreams of glory. His death by drowning was not ruled a suicide, but it is known that he was deeply distraught in his final days. Although Lequyer had ambi tious plans to publish his philosophical ideas, and although he wrote a great deal, he published nothing. Lequyer's friends be lieved that his passion for perfection in the turn of a phrase prevented him from completing his work. In the words of Le Gal la Salle, "The poet in him impeded the thinker and the thinker impeded the poet" (quoted in Dugas in Lequier 1924, 57). Lequyer might have suffered a second death, the literary equiva lent of drowning, had Renouvier not come to his rescue. Renouvier says that he saved Lequyer's work from sinking (Renouvier 1886, v. II, 382). In 1865, three years after his friend's death, Renouvier underwrote the publication of 120 copies of La Recherche d'une premi?re v?rit?, a collection of Lequyer's most polished manu scripts edited by Renouvier and including his sketch of Lequyer's life. The book was distributed to Renouvier's and Lequyer's friends and was not put up for sale. The book was not widely available until 1924 when it was reissued with a biographical introduc tion by Louis Dugas (Lequier 1924; see also Lequier 1952 and Lequier 1993). The publication of the Lequyer book might be called Renouvier's first memorial to his friend. The second was a monument with a statue made to resemble Lequyer, which he and another of Lequyer's close friends, Madame Agathe Lando, erected over his grave in Pl?rin. The inscription reads: This monument was raised to the memory of an unhappy friend and a man of great genius, in 1868, by Renouvier. Jules Lequyer, born at Quintin in 1814, deceased at Pl?rin in 1862. Pray for him. His works: The Hornbeam Leaf ? Abel and Abel ? The Search for a First Truth ? The Dialogue of the Predestinate and the Repro bate (Viney 1995, 12).</page><page sequence="8">36 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY The works mentioned on the monument are all contained within Renouvier's edition of La Recherche d'une premi?re v?rit?. Renouvier's third memorial to Lequyer was an abiding grati tude to the one who throughout his life he called "my master" (Perry, v. I, 663; Renouvier 1912, v. I, 371; Lequier 1936, 302; Renouvier 1930, 64). Renouvier first expressed his debt to Lequyer, without mentioning his name, in his Manuel de philosophie ancienne, published in 1844. He says ? for reasons unknown ? that it was not yet the time to reveal Lequyer's name. However, he speaks of his and Lequyer's "long conversations on the fundamen tal questions of metaphysics" and he emphasizes how Lequyer's analyses, especially "on the questions of faith, freedom, and on the intervention of the idea of freedom on those of knowledge and certitude" made an impression upon him (Renouvier 1844, xii). In the first edition of Essais de critique g?n?rale, deuxi?me essai, published in 1859 ? the book that was pivotal to James's development ? Renouvier again credited Lequyer, this time by name, with his ideas about freedom, and reveals that Lequyer was the person named in the earlier book. I borrow the principal idea of this chapter, and almost all that concerns, in this second part, the establishment of the fact of freedom and its relations with certitude, from a philosopher that it is all the more necessary to cite since his works have not yet appeared. It has been some years since I recorded the same decla ration in my studies of the philosophers of antiquity anuel de philosophie ancienne, 1844, t. I, Avertissement). I ever hope for and greatly desire the publication, and the complete publication of a work of which the friends of M. J. Lequyer were able to admire certain parts, and where the public will be surprised to find brought together the most formidable labors of thought, a powerful imagi nation, and consummate artistic style (quoted in Brimmer, 486-487). It should be noted that Renouvier was not an uncritical admirer of Lequyer. For he also comments in this same acknowledgment that there is a "chasm between [Lequyer's] religion and my feelings," and that Lequyer's work mixes "old errors" with "new and forceful truths," the latter of which, Renouvier was certain, would insure its success. Jean Grenier argues convincingly that Renouvier found his friend's religiosity embarrassing, absurd, and out of date. Renouvier did not want to expose Lequyer to the ridicule and severe judg ments of the philosophers (Grenier 245).3 Grenier's caveat is important if only because, in addition to the publication of La Recherche d'une premi?re v?rit?, Renouvier published lengthy</page><page sequence="9">WILLIAM JAMES ON FREE WILL 37 extracts from Lequyer's writings in his own books, but he published those excerpts with the least theological content. Consequently, one who reads only the excerpts that Renouvier published in his own books might well get a mistaken impression of the trajectory of Lequyer's thought. This said, it is noteworthy that in the Trait? de psychologie rationnelle (the second edition of the Essais), pub lished in 1875, Renouvier included extracts from Lequyer's writings totaling fifty-six pages of text (Renouvier 1912, v. I, 369-393; v. II, 50-52, 109-139). Shorter extracts were to follow in Esquisse d'une classification syst?matique (Renouvier 1886, v. II, 91-93) and in Philosophie analytique de l'histori? (Renouvier 1897, v. IV, 428-431). Renouvier maintained that Lequyer's influence freed him from the debates about freedom and necessity. Before meeting "this superior spirit," Renouvier understood freedom only as an "ex emption from constraint," a freedom that determinists have no difficulty in conceding. However, he could not see how, allowing this definition, our actions could have merit. Acting out of rever ence for duty presupposes the contrary possibility of not acting out of reverence for duty. Lequyer familiarized him with the idea of ambiguous futures, and showed him that the question of free will turns on "the reality or the illusions of these futures and of these possibles considered in themselves." Finally, Renouvier re ported that Lequyer persuaded him that free will "concerns our judgments no less than our acts" (Renouvier 1886, v. II, 382). Without a doubt, all of the doctrines concerning freedom that Renouvier found valuable are central features of Lequyer's thought. Lequyer makes a sharp division between freedom and determin ism. This is not to say that he denies that the will is free in a sense that is compatible with determinism. "That my will deter mines itself without constraint is not doubtful," says Lequyer, "the interior feeling guarantees it" (OC, 50). Thus, Lequyer, like Renouvier and James after him, acknowledges that one may be a determinist and embrace some sense of freedom. However, the sense of freedom that a determinist can recognize apparently occurs whether or not the deliverances of the will itself are fixed in advance by antecedent conditions. Lequyer argues that the process of deliberation itself, wherein one hesitates be tween two courses of action, reveals a deeper sense of freedom. Lequyer remarks that, ... to represent to oneself two contradictory courses of action between which one is undecided is as much as it is possible to live two times at the same instant and to enjoy mutually exclusive goods . . . (OC, 52).</page><page sequence="10">38 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY In such moments there is what Lequyer calls a "presentiment" that one could have willed otherwise, that under the selfsame condi tions in which one deliberated, either of the two paths could be taken. Real or illusory, all free acts that I think I produce have this in common, that at the moment I make a decision, I have the idea that I have this power to will in another way; since I do not use this power I should not say that I have a present feeling of it, but [that I have] a presentiment; the presentiment of something that will be as though it did not exist since I do not make use of it at the moment when in fact I will. In free acts then, I do not feel that I can will otherwise than I will, but I feel that I could; in the other acts that only seem to me to be free, I believe I feel that I could (OC, 52-53). This presentiment of free will, unlike the feeling of acting without constraint, is the presentiment of an illusion if determinism is true. With this meaning of freedom, freedom and determinism are incompatible notions. Lequyer concludes, "It is necessary to chose either the reality of free will with the ambiguity of futures, or the appearance of free will with infallible futures" (OC, 75). Lequyer concedes that free will, in the sense required by the presentiment of ambiguous futures, presupposes a certain arbi trariness of the will. He declares that "Freedom without the arbitrary is the thing without the word, or the word without the thing" (OC, 56). The idea of an arbitrariness at the heart of voli tion may be regarded by some as a "barbaric notion," like "a sort of madness of the will" (OC, 56, 54). However, Lequyer insists that when all motives, habits, prejudices, and secret causes within the heart have been accounted for, Something still remains, something unexplained and unexplainable that escapes all law, that produced itself without any reason, that is dependent only on the fact of its own existence (OC, 56). The mention of law is significant, for the doctrine of necessity requires that the determinations of the will be subject, at least in principle, to the same laws that govern any other occurrence in nature. Moreover, the laws of nature with which Lequyer was fa miliar were deterministic, modeled on the deductions of an axiomatic system. Free will, in the sense that Lequyer defends it, escapes these laws. Lequyer gives no clear account of the agent who makes free decisions, but he resists the temptation to dilute agency by trac ing decisions to causes that antedate the decision. On the contrary, Lequyer claims that,</page><page sequence="11">WILLIAM JAMES ON FREE WILL 39 It costs nothing, then, to animate with a certain ind?termination all the movements of this apparently disorderly becoming through which passes the will which, as one says, determines itself. One takes the sudden but infallible occurrence of the efficacious will as a throw of the dice of which one is oneself the chance, so as to have its determination in one's power . . . (OC, 55). He concludes, "If then I had the right to speak thus without being mad, I would also have the right to add, It is I who am the absolute author of this action; I acknowledge it and adopt it'" (OC, 56-57). For Lequyer, it is in the very moment when the choice is made, and not before, where one finds the locus of responsibility for the choice. In the final analysis, Lequyer believed that neither necessity nor freedom could be established empirically or be rationally dem onstrated. There is a stalemate between belief in determinism and belief in free will, a standoff that Lequyer argues must be broken, if at all, by an act of the will. Of course, this act of will is either necessary or it is not. In Lequyer's succinct phraseology: "Two Hypotheses: freedom or necessity. To choose between one and the other with one or with the other" (OC, 70). Lequyer's strategy is not to adduce evidence for free will or to deduce it from other truths, but to argue for the propriety of postulating freedom by an act of the will. Lequyer says that "it is an act of freedom that affirms freedom" (OC, 67; cf. 17 and 400). Lequyer's fragments leave little more than an outline of how he meant to pursue this line of reasoning. His sketch of the argument is as follows: either Freedom is or Necessity is Freedom with the Idea of Freedom Freedom with the Idea of Necessity Necessity with the Idea of Freedom Necessity with the Idea of Necessity (OC, 398). Renouvier calls this "Lequyer's dilemma" or the "double dilemma." It is interesting to note that the excerpts from Lequyer's writings that Renouvier published most often in his own books were his reconstruction of this dilemma and his explanation of the reason ing. In Renouvier's version, the order of the four alternatives is different and the wording is altered: "Necessity affirmed necessarily;</page><page sequence="12">40 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY Necessity affirmed freely; Freedom affirmed necessarily; Freedom affirmed freely" (Renouvier 1912, v. II, 138). Lequyer believed that neither freedom nor determinism could be demonstrated. He writes, This hideous dogma of necessity cannot be demonstrated. It is a chimera which conceals absolute doubt in its bowels. It vanishes in the face of a serious and attentive examination, like phantoms formed of a mixture of light and shadow which inspire terror only where there is fear and are dispelled by the hand that touches them. But what cannot be emphasized enough is that freedom, as real as it may be, is no more demonstrable (OC, 393). Lequyer's feeling of revulsion at the thought of determinism is iterated throughout his writing ? it is an idea that revolts his entire being (OC, 17), a hideous dream (OC, 224). In any event, since neither freedom nor necessity is demonstrable, he believed that it fell to an act of will to decide the issue. The problem then is to trace the consequences of each belief, considered as a postulate. Whereas determinism "conceals absolute doubt in its bowels," freedom ... is the necessary condition making possible both the imperfect and admirable work of human knowledge and the work of duty which follows it, and this is perhaps enough to assure us that it is not a vain conception of our pride (OC, 393). Lequyer agrees with Kant that freedom is a postulate of morality. However, he goes further and, contrary to Kant, postulates free dom as necessary to the pursuit of knowledge, even the pursuit of knowledge in science. Lequyer's argument seems to follow these lines: The pursuit of knowledge presupposes an element of doubt; however, the pursuit is short-circuited by absolute doubt, by the radical skepticism that knowledge is not possible. The doctrine of determinism engenders absolute doubt, especially about its own truth. This is because any judgment one makes, including the affirmation of necessity, could not be otherwise; likewise, to affirm freedom is to be in error of necessity. One's "truths" as well as one's "errors" are necessary. In a deterministic universe, people are destined to make the judg ments they make, when they make them; however, no one is in a position to know that they are among the elect whose judgments are in preestablished harmony with the truth, including the truth of determinism?hence, the specter of absolute doubt. Xavier Tilliette, in his commentary on Lequyer's dilemma, re marks that there is a "flickering of equivocation" in the reasoning</page><page sequence="13">WILLIAM JAMES ON FREE WILL 41 between the idea of the ability to escape causal necessity and the idea of the uncoercibility of profound and victorious feelings (Tilliette, 185). This is true, although due to the incompleteness of Lequyer's work, one does not know how he would have responded to such a criticism. Lequyer's argument may turn on the fact that the necessity linking cause and effect is fundamentally different than the necessity involved in valid inference. He explains the difference between the postulates of freedom and necessity this way: But the act by which my will adheres to this Postulatum is free and necessarily free. I am armed with a double-edged will that can proceed at its discretion on the yes or the no. If it proceeds on the yes, man recognizes within himself Reason which is the power to distinguish, within the legitimate limits of our awareness that form the understanding, true from false judgments. If it proceeds on the no, man denies himself as a rational being and declares him self deprived of the Power to distinguish truth from error within whatever limits. (From which it follows that complete skepticism is logical in its own way.) (OC, 400). Suppose one could deduce, by laws that at present we do not possess, that someone would make a given judgment ? a process that itself presupposes a grasp of the rules of inference ? the deduction itself would not yield any information as to the truth or falsity of the judgment. Lequyer apparently saw no way for the determinist to bridge the gap between causes and reasons, be tween the causal laws that govern the universe, which the determinist believes necessitate our judgments as well, and the rules of evidence that govern our judgments (see Viney and Crosby, 135). James and Lequyer Lequyer's influence on Renouvier concerning the questions of free will and determinism was no less profound than Renouvier's influ ence on James concerning the same. Thus, the evidence for an indirect connection between James and Lequyer is convincing. It only remains to examine the evidence for linking James more directly to Lequyer. That James knew of Lequyer is unquestionable. His first men tion of the Frenchman is on November 2, 1872 in his very first letter to Renouvier. Indeed, the occasion for the writing of the letter is James's unsuccessful attempts to obtain a copy of Lequyer's La Recherche d'une premi?re v?rit?, Renouvier's edition published in 1865. The correspondence begins: Monsieur, ? I have just learned by your Science de la Morale that the work of M. Lequier, of which you make reference in your second</page><page sequence="14">42 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY Essai de Critique, has never been put on sale. This explains the lack of success with which I for a long time have tried to procure it for myself through the bookstore. Would it be too much to ask, if you still have copies, to send me one which, after having read it, I would present to the University library of this town in your name? (Letters, v. I, 163).4 Renouvier sent James a copy of the book which James gave to the Harvard library in Renouvier's name on April 9, 1873, as he had promised. James must have read the book during the first months of 1873, but he made no marginal annotations in it (Brimmer, Appendix III). Renouvier offered James a copy of the Lequyer volume for his personal library. In his letter of May 23, 1873 he thanks James for a letter and for the receipt of the 1873 Nation notice. Renouvier then asks, You do not, then, wish the copy of Lequier's work which I was happy to offer you? In any case be assured that it remains at your disposition, for yourself or for anyone else whom you may desig nate. At the first indication of your wish it will be sent to you, for I still have several of these volumes at hand, and I know few appreciators of its merit to be compared with you. I have received the acknowledgment of its receipt from the Library of the University at Cambridge [i.e. Harvard] . . . (Perry, v. I, 663). This letter seems to presuppose other letters that would have been exchanged since James's first contact. It is not known whether such letters were written, but it is known that many of James's early letters are lost, including letters to Renouvier between July 1876 and December 1879 (Perry, v. I, 663). These lacunae are truly unfortunate, for if James made any comments to Renouvier about Lequyer's book it would have been in these missing letters. James mentions Lequyer in his published work, but curiously, not by name. In the 1880 article, "The Feeling of Effort," which was incorporated into the chapter on the Will in The Principles of Psychology, James argues that, in the absence of conclusive evi dence for or against free will, we may choose one or the other. He writes, But if our speculative delight be less keen, if the love of a parti pris outweighs that of keeping questions open, or if, as a French philosopher of genius says, "l'amour de la vie qui s'indigne de tant de discours," awakens in us, craving the sense of either peace or power, ? then, taking the risk of error on our head, we must project upon one of the alternative views the attribute of reality for us; we must so fill our mind with the idea of it that it becomes</page><page sequence="15">WILLIAM JAMES ON FREE WILL 43 our settled creed. The present writer does this for the alternative of freedom, but since the grounds of his opinion are ethical rather than psychological, he prefers to exclude them from the present book (James 1981, v. II, 1176). The "French philosopher of genius" is Lequyer and the quotation is from Lequyer's book. It may be translated: "the love of life which is indignant of so much discourse" (OC, 69). James would cite this phrase, slightly altered, one more time, without mention ing the one from whom it was borrowed. In Some Problems of Philosophy, he says that some people reject determinism in favor of the naive belief in creative activity. "'Le sens de la vie qui s'indigne de tant de discours,' awakens in them and snaps its fingers at the 'critical' view" (James 1979, 105). Either because he disremembered it or because he intentionally changed it for his own purposes, James writes "the sense of life" rather than "the love of life." The extent of James's explicit mention of and use of Lequyer in his own writing is paltry. Furthermore, at the very point at which one might expect James to comment on Lequyer, the correspon dence is missing. These facts, taken together with a blithe acceptance of Perry's assessment of Lequyer's relation to James, may explain why most James scholars find no important connec tion between the Frenchman and the American. Nevertheless, much more needs to be said, for the indirect evidence for a more direct influence from Lequyer to James is compelling. Consider first the essay "Bain and Renouvier," published in 1876. We have noted that this is basically a review and an enthu siastic endorsement of Renouvier's Essais de critique g?n?rale. However, whereas James originally read the 1859 edition of this work, it was the 1875 edition from which he quoted in his 1876 review. The difference is important because the later edition, un like the earlier one, contains extensive excerpts from Lequyer's writings, and James's remarks demonstrate that he carefully read those excerpts and adopted their philosophy. James's attention was focused on chapters XIV and XVII. Chapter XIV is where Renouvier acknowledges Lequyer as the one from whom he bor rowed "everything that in an essential way concerns, in my book, the establishment of freedom and its relations with certitude" (Renouvier 1912, v. I, 399; cf. citation from the first edition; cf. Foucher's remark about the difference, Foucher, 92). Both chap ters are the places where Renouvier includes the most extensive excerpts from Lequyer's works. We have already documented how James praised Renouvier for stating the free will issue in terms of the ambiguity of futures. Of</page><page sequence="16">44 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY course, this idea was borrowed entirely from Lequyer, although James fails to mention it. James moves next, following Renouvier's text, to the question of certitude. He condenses quotations from different pages into a single passage. Thus, he cites the following (the pages from Renouvier's book are added): The radical sign of will, the essential mark of that achieved development which makes man capable of speculating on all things and raises him to his dignity of an independent and autonomous being, is the possibility of doubt. . . . The ignorant man doubts little, the fool still less, the madman not at all. . . . Certitude is not and cannot be an absolute condition. It is, what is too often forgot ten, a state and an act of man ... a state in which he posits his consciousness, such as it is, and stands by it. Properly speaking, there is no certitude; all there is is men who are certain [v. I, 366]. . . . Certitude is thus nothing but belief [v. I, 367] ... a moral attitude [v. I, 368] (James 1987, 325). James is preparing the reader for Renouvier's penultimate case for free will, where "he posits his consciousness, such as it is," that is to say, as free, "and stands by it." Again, however, we find Renouvier borrowing heavily from Lequyer. The finale comes when Lequyer's dilemma is resolved by affirming freedom freely. James writes: Renouvier boldly avows the full conditions under which alone we can be right if freedom is true, and says: "Let our liberty pro nounce on its own real existence." [v. II, 97] (James 1987, 326). James continues with another freely edited quotation: I prefer to affirm my liberty and to affirm it by means of my liberty [v. II, 138]. . . . My moral and practical certitude begins logically [James's emphasis] by the certitude of my freedom, just as practically [James's emphasis] my freedom has always had to intervene in the constitution of my speculative certitude [v. II, 97] (James 1987, 326). The first part of this quotation is from the thirty page addendum to chapter XVII that is comprised of excerpts from Lequyer's works. The statement, "I prefer to affirm my liberty and to affirm it by means of my liberty," is Renouvier's gloss on Lequyer's dilemma and is nested between quotations from Lequyer. Once again, it is Renouvier whom James quotes and credits but it is the ideas of Lequyer that are being promoted. Once James was introduced to the idea of affirming freedom freely, he never ceased to promote it in his discussion of free will and determinism. It runs like the theme through all the counterpoint of his philosophy. The 1870 journal entry is the first mention of</page><page sequence="17">WILLIAM JAMES ON FREE WILL 45 the idea (Letters, v. I, 147). However, it is iterated in the 1873 notice in Nation (James 1987, 266) and in the 1876 review (James 1987, 326); it is in the 1884 essay, "The Dilemma of Determinism" (James 1979, 115); it is in The Principles of Psychology (James 1981, v. II, 1176); it is in an 1893 review of Renouvier's third Essai (James 1987, 442); finally, it is in the 1899 Talks to Teachers (James 1925, 192). In this idea ? that freedom should affirm itself ? an idea that is so central to the Jamesian position on free will, it is not enough to say that James was influenced by Renouvier. Renouvier is at best the messenger, but the message belongs to Lequyer. James ends his review of Renouvier's second Essai with an other quote. Freedom, he says, is the cornerstone of Renouvier's philosophy, by which "the minimum of faith produces the maxi mum of result" (James 1987, 326). Ironically, it is not Renouvier whom James quotes here, but Lequyer who is being quoted by Renouvier (Renouvier 1912, v. II, 137; OC, 64). It is appropriate that Lequyer should have the last word, although in keeping with his silent presence in James's work, Lequyer's name is not men tioned and his words are attributed to another. James continued to use and expand upon the basic ideas con cerning free will that he first learned from Renouvier, using Lequyer as a kind of palimpsest. Whether James was fully aware of the debt to Lequyer is unknown, although his careful reading of the 1875 edition of Renouvier's second Essai could not have failed to alert him to the importance that Renouvier placed on Lequyer's influence.5 In any event, James's mature reflections on the free will issue, both in "The Dilemma of Determinism," and in The Principles of Psychology, bear the unmistakable impression of Lequyer's thought. Were it not for the mediating influence of Renouvier on James the coincidence of so many points of agree ment between James and Lequyer would seem remarkable. Let us summarize the points of agreement that we have touched upon throughout this essay. For James, as for Lequyer: (1) There is a meaning of freedom that is not compromised by the truth of determinism; however, this sense of freedom ? that is, acting with out constraint ? is a dodge where the question of free will is concerned (OC, 50; James 1979, 117). (2) The disagreement be tween determinists and defenders of free will, the issue of fact as James calls it, is whether possibilities outstrip actualities; a uni verse in which there is free will is indeterministic in the sense that in some instances, at the point of deciding between two or more courses of action, both courses are equally possible given the identical initial conditions of the deliberation; both philosophers</page><page sequence="18">46 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY use the word chance to describe this indeterminacy of the will (OC, 55; James 1979, 117). (3) Neither determinism nor free will are susceptible of proof or carry the weight of evidence on their side (OC, 393; James 1981, v. II, 1176). (4) The hypothesis of free will undergirds our moral judgments; determinism renders moral ity problematic or nonexistent (OC, 399); James's own dilemma of determinism is a moral argument against belief in determinism. (5) It is most fitting to consider free will as a postulate that the will freely gives itself. There is a sixth and final point of agreement between Lequyer and James that brings us to the more global dimensions of James's philosophy. In the dedication of his last book James speaks of Renouvier's "masterly advocacy of pluralism" (James 1979, 85). James explicitly connected the monism/pluralism debate with the free will/determinism controversy. He wrote to Renouvier on De cember 6, 1882, that "pluralism and indeterminism seem to be but two ways of stating the same thing" (Perry, v. I, 686). Renouvier approved of this equation, calling it "very profound" (Perry, v. I, 689). James's famous expressions "iron block" (James 1979, 118) and "block-universe" (James 1977, 140) are interchangeable de scriptions for determinism and monism. Indeterminism and pluralism, on the other hand, characterize a universe unfinished and in the making ? a universe that grows, like experience, in "buds or drops" (James 1979, 80). One of James's most perspicuous characterizations of the is sues is in the essay "The Sentiment of Rationality." In quasi-mathematical fashion he distinguishes the "mass of mun dane phenomena," labeled M, independent of one's own subjectivity and the subjective complement, labeled x. The equation M + x expresses the state of the universe at the moment one's subjectiv ity is figured into the total set of facts (James 1979, 83). The issue of determinism and free will or monism and pluralism is whether x adds something to M that was not contained within it implicitly. If the answer is yes, then two things follow: first, the world may be regarded as "a machine whose final purpose is the making real of [an] outward good" (James 1979, 128); second, we are in some fashion creators of ourselves; James clearly affirms this sense of self-creation when he rejects the argument for determinism from character and says that we are "habitually fashioning our charac ters" (James 1981, v. I, 130; cf. Viney 1986, 558-559). Lequyer anticipates James's views. He argues that strict de terminism makes of the universe a single unchanging whole. "All is then one; all is then a great fact . . ." (OC, 369). In</page><page sequence="19">WILLIAM JAMES ON FREE WILL 47 contrast, free will introduces novelty into the universe by way of alternate possibilities. A single cause, me, capable at a single instant, as though I were double, of two completely opposite effects! And, by one, or by the other, author of something eternal, for whatever my choice, it would henceforth be eternally true that something would have taken place at this point of time that it had pleased me to decide (OC, 14). One's free decisions bring something new into existence that, before the decision, was one among several possibilities. Like James, Lequyer sees the implication that, by our decisions, we are part creators of ourselves. Lequyer expresses this by saying that the free person is a "dependent independence" (OC, 70). Freedom is not absolute, for one does not bring oneself into existence nor is one responsible for what James calls the mass of mundane facts; but freedom is not nonexistent, for one's decisions are not inevi table products of the universe's unfolding. To acknowledge the profound similarities between Lequyer and James on the questions of free will and determinism is not per force to say that there are not important differences. Three of these differences have specifically to do with the free will issue. First, James makes the concept of "effort of attention" the center piece of his psychology of the will. Lequyer recognizes the phenomenon but, because his interests lie elsewhere, he puts no special emphasis on it. Another divergence between Lequyer and James is that Lequyer leans heavily on the idea that free will is a condition not only of morality but of knowledge itself. After James's review of Renouvier's Essais, this argument does not appear again in James's work. He relies rather on the moral argument, as one finds in "The Dilemma of Determinism." The third difference between Lequyer and James concerns reli gion. Lequyer was a devout Catholic; he was a mystic for whom God was a real and sometimes sensible presence. Lequyer was continually attuned to the theological applications of his philo sophical reflections. Indeed, Grenier claims that Lequyer's true aim was "to found a Christian philosophy" (Grenier, 245). Lequyer's encyclopedic knowledge of the positions and arguments of medi eval philosophy gave him the necessary tools to patiently challenge them in imaginative and ingenious ways. Lequyer's ideas about free will were intimately tied to his religious belief. Thus, if there is a central affirmation of Lequyer's thought it is his belief in "God who created me creator of myself" (OC, 70 and 538). James was sympathetic to religion, even to its more bizarre manifestations, as is apparent from his classic The Varieties of</page><page sequence="20">48 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY Religious Experience. In his moments of greatest crisis he clung to religion as an anchor of stability and sanity (Letters, v. I, 145 147). On the other hand, he had little patience with the scholastic theories about God ? he spoke of "the metaphysical monster" they offer for worship (James 1985, 353). Ironically, Lequyer came to a similar conclusion; he found many of the classical ideas about God, such as absolute foreknowledge, unqualified omnipotence, and divine immutability nightmarish. However, James was no mystic, and because he did not allow himself the luxury of sus tained theological reflection, he professed belief in a God the conception of which is vague and anthropomorphic: "A power not ourselves . . . which not only makes for righteousness, but means it, and which recognizes us . . ." (James 1979, 98). Despite James's familiarity with Lequyer, he seems never to have attained to the conception of a God who creates other creators. Conclusion James was not a carbon copy of either Renouvier or Lequyer, even on the subject of free will and determinism, for which he most admired them. Nevertheless, the extent of his debt to them was profound. Throughout his life he acknowledged Renouvier's contri butions to his philosophy, but he mentioned Lequyer only in passing or not at all. By focusing on Renouvier's importance, the majority of James scholars have contributed to the impression that James's views on free will and determinism can be understood without mentioning Lequyer. The evidence presented in this paper shows that the "French philosopher of genius" was not only Renouvier's "master," but that James also owned part of his legacy. Lequyer once mused that his future importance would depend not only on his own accomplishments but on many other factors beyond his control. Who knows what the first movement I am going to make will decide in my future existence? It may be that from circumstance to circumstance my entire life will be different, and that, later, by virtue of a secret connection which, by a multitude of intermediar ies, reconnects the least things to the most considerable events, I will become the rival of men whose names my father only pro nounces with respect, in the evening, near the hearth, while one listens to him in silence (OC, 14). The respect due Lequyer stems from his contributions to philosophy, which have yet to be appreciated. This respect might begin by recognizing the "secret connection" which is here uncovered between Jules Lequyer and William James.</page><page sequence="21">WILLIAM JAMES ON FREE WILL 49 Pittsburg State University Received April 15, 1996 BIBLIOGRAPHY Barzan, Jacques.

In Pl?rin, where he lived much of his life, an attractive tombstone marks his grave and a school, Coll?ge Jules Lequier, is named for him. Lequyer's name is often spelled "Lequier," although "Lequyer" is the official orthography and is found on both the plaque marking his birthplace and his tombstone. 2. All translations from French are mine. 3. The religious dimensions of Lequyer's character and thought mystified Renouvier. He reports, [Lequyer] would speculate on the word of the Savior in the Vulgate exactly as though Jesus Christ had, not only said it, word for word, but had spoken Latin, the Latin of Saint Jerome. . . . There was something touching about this although quite strange, in so great a spirit (H?mon, 179). Renouvier says that Lequyer would often bring up the subject of the Trinity, but that Renouvier found the subject boring (Lequier 1993, xl). Renouvier could accept his friend's theological reflections only on the condition that they be demythologized to express philosophical insights. Thus, he called Lequyer's "Dialogue of the Predestinate and the Repro bate" "a dramatic metaphysical masterpiece, probably without equal in any literature." However, apart from its literary merits, he found the chief value of the dialogue in its "mythical expression" of the philosophi cal issues of determinism (Renouvier 1897, v. IV, 428).</page><page sequence="24">52 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY Renouvier's nervousness about Lequyer's religiosity was a concern to Lequyer's friends. When Renouvier announced his intentions to publish La Recherche d'une premi?re v?rit?, Charles Deville objected that Renouvier's selections might give readers the wrong idea about Lequyer's religious convictions. An agreement was reached in which Deville and another friend, Paul Michelot, would publish an edition of Lequyer's works containing writings that Deville and Michelot believed to be more representative of Lequyer's views. Deville left the task to Michelot who, "overwhelmed by the exigencies of daily life," never finished the project (Pyguillem, 663). Deville's and Michelot's concerns were probably unfounded so far as La Recherche d'une premi?re v?rit? is concerned. This book contains Lequyer's most important theological works. On the other hand, the excerpts from Lequyer's writings quoted in Renouvier's books are the least theologically colored. I have completed a translation of Lequyer's dialogue and am preparing it for publication. 4. This letter presents a minor puzzle. The edition of Renouvier's Essai to which James refers appeared in 1859 and it mentions only that Lequyer's work is not yet published. Renouvier's Science de la Morale was published in 1869 and mentions that Lequyer's book was published but, as James says, was not put up for sale. If James knew that the book had not been put up for sale, then why had he been asking the bookstore to acquire it as his letter states? Another curiosity is that James reports in a letter to Renouvier dated May 8, 1882, that he hadn't yet read Science de la Morale (Perry, v. I, 677). 5. Houghton Library at Harvard possesses James's annotated copy of the 1875 edition of Renouvier's second essay of the Essai de critique g?n?rale (WJ 675.61.4). However, James's annotations, especially for chapters XIV and XVII, amount to little more than underlining and do not provide any further comments about Lequyer. I would like to thank T. Ravindranathan, formerly of Wheelock College in Boston, for giving generously of his time to examine James's copy of Renouvier's book for its annotations.</page></plain_text>
