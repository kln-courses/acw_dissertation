<plain_text><page sequence="1">1901 January - June ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS' SUMMARIES OF ORIGINAL ARTICLES CHIEFLY IN RECENT PERIODICALS GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS The Representation of the Gallop in Art.--In R. Arch. XXXVIII, 1901, pp. 26-45 (24 figs.) and 224-244 (2 pls.; 31 figs.), S. Reinach continues his treatise on the representation of the gallop. (See Am. J. Arch. 1900, p. 521, 1901, p. 225.) Gold plaques and the like from Siberia show the galop volant, in which the forelegs are extended forward and the hind legs back- ward. This motive was found in lMycenaean art. From this it probably spread by means of colonies on the Black Sea to Siberia. The same motive is found in Sassanide and Chinese art, both of which probably derived it from Siberian (Scythian) art. Japanese art received it from China. The Evolution of Decorative Motives. - In the Am. Architect, 1901, pp. 29-32, 51-53, Professor Hamlin completes his series of articles on the ' Evolution of Decorative Motives' by treating of the Rinceau or foliated scroll motive. He shows how this motive persists under varying forms in the art of Europe and of Asia from the fourth century B.c. to the present day. Ancient Places and Names of Places.- In R. Arch. XXXVIII, 1901, pp. 94-124, Victor Berard continues his study of 'ancient "topology and toponomy." (See Am. J. Arch. 1901, p. 226.) Several instances of Semitic names in Greek are brought forward. The subtitle of this instalment is ' The Phoenicians and the Odyssey,' and the greater part of the discussion consists of an elaborate comparison between the activity of the ancient Phoenicians in the eastern Mediterranean and that of the Franks in the same region. The article is continued ibid. pp. 213-223. History of the Bilingual Inscription C.I.S. I, 122.-In C. R. Acad. Insc. 1901, pp. 17-35, HIron de Villefosse publishes an account of the his- tory of the bilingual inscription from Malta in the Louvre, correcting pre- vious statements. 1 The departments of Archaeological News and Discussions and of Bibliography of Archaeological Books are conducted by Professor FOWLER, Editor-in-charge, assisted by Miss MARY H. BUCKINGHAM, Professor HARRY E. BURTON, Professor JAMES C. EGBERT, JR., Professor ELMER T. MERRILL, Dr. GEORGE N. OLCOTT, Professor JAMES M. PATON, and the Editors, especially Professor MARQUAND.

V, 1901 Parthian Coinage. - Students of Parthian history will be interested in a paper ' On the Rearrangement of Parthian Coinage,' by Mr. Warwick Wroth of the British Museum, in Num. Chron. 1900, pp. 181-202. Ancient Bronze-casting. - At the February meeting of the Berl. Arch. Gesellsch., L. Lewin discussed ancient bronze-casting, speaking of the mixture of the metal, --an art declining in the time of Pliny, - the cire-perdue and the sand or clay mould processes, the repairing of defects, the practice of casting statues in separate pieces, and the various methods of joining them. The Benin bronzes from West Africa, made by the cire- perdue process, he thinks cannot be the work of the negroes. This last view was combated by v. Luschan. (Arch. Anz. 1901, pp. 15-16.) The Oxo-Caspian Trade Route. - The question of an ancient water connection between the Aral and the Caspian, the origin of the Greek belief in it, and the nature of the traffic via the Oxus, are discussed by W. W. Tarn in J.H.S. XXI, 1901, pp. 11-29; map. The Monument at Adam-Klissi. - In the volume recording the pro- ceedings of the Congres arche'ologique de France LXVe session, held at Bourges in 1898 (published in 1900), G. Tocilesco (pp. 305-311) maintains that the monument at Adam-Klissi was erected by Trajan. Four slabs of inscription found near the trophy read memoriam fortis [simorum] and pro rep. morte occubuerunt. Another fragment reads tri]b(unicia) pot(estate). The whole inscription is restored: Imperator Caesar divi Nervae filius Nerva Traianus I Augustus Germanicus Dacicus tribunicia potestate XIII consul V pater patriae in honorem et me- moriam fortissimorum virorum I qui pugnantes pro republica morte occubuerunt bello Dacico. In the list of soldiers which follows, the soldiers of each legion are from various countries, which was not the case after Trajan, and the gentilicia fail to show the names of later emperors. A large tumulus near the trophy and mausoleum was probably a military work, perhaps an out- look tower. The town, Civitas Tropaeensium, has been explored and in part excavated. Three gates and some well-preserved walls have been found, and within the walls are remains of many buildings, among them three basilicas, one of Byzantine times, one earlier, and one of the time of Trajan. This was 56 m. long and 23 m. wide, and was divided by two rows of eighteen columns. Ancient Battlefields. --At the December meeting of the Berl. Arch. Gesellsch., Kromayer gave a clear account of the Battle of Sellasia (the defeat of Cleomenes by Antigonus in 221 B.c.), based on detailed study of the ground and on Polybius's narrative, which has hitherto been considered inexplicable. He called attention to the great importance of such topo- graphical study, both for the proper understanding of critical events in ancient history, and for a true appreciation of the writers who describe them. (Arch. Anz. 1900, pp. 204-211; 2 plans.) The Battle of Dionysus and the Indians in Ivory Carvings. - In Jh. Oesterr. Arch. I. IV, 1901, pp. 126-142 (3 pls.; 7 figs.), Hans Graeven discusses representations of the conflict of Dionysus and his followers with the Indians, found in ivory carvings at Vienna, St. Gall, Florence, Cologne, and Paris. The carvings are rude, but the groups are well composed. Indian weapons and costumes are represented with great realism. The reliefs are probably derived from some Hellenistic original, which was itself inspired</page><page sequence="3">EGYPT] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1901 455 by a Hellenistic poem describing the deeds of Dionysus in India. Passages in Lucian's Dionysus agree with the representations of the reliefs. The Rosalia at Philippi. - In B. C.H. XXIV, 1900, pp. 299-323, pl. xiii., P. Perdrizet discusses the rosalia in the East. This Italian feast in honor of the dead was held in May, when offerings, especially roses, were brought to the dead, and at the funeral banquet the feasters were crowned with roses. The Italian custom can be traced in Asia Minor, where Romans had settled, and in the Danube provinces, and is especially common at Philippi. Seven inscriptions, of which five are in Latin, are given and discussed at length, with many illustrations from unpublished inscriptions. Perdrizet finds no connection between the Thracian worship of Dionysus and the rosalia. The latter are Italian and brought to Philippi by the colonists of Augustus. Our inscriptions are almost all of the secotld century after Christ. The dead were honored, not only by the escae rosales in the spring, but also on the day of their birth or death, in other words by the Italian parentalia. An inscription now at Salonica is published which mentions the rosalia, and also two Thiasi of Dionysus, called Prinophori and Dryophori, names which show the importance of trees in the Dionysiac cults of Macedonia. Mohammedan Art in India. - Under the title 'L'Islam monumental dans l'Inde au Nord,' in the Gaz. B.-A. 1901, pp. 277-291, Robert d'Hu- mieres begins a survey of Mohammedan art in northern India. The pres- ent article treats of the monuments of old Delhi. Baghdad during the Abbasid Caliphate.- A book of some archae- ological interest is Baghdad under the Abbasid Caliphate, by G. Le Strange (Oxford, 1900, Clarendon Press, xxxi, 381 pp.; 8 plans). The foundation of the city and its history under the Abbasid Caliphate are narrated, and its streets, roads, canals, mosques, palaces, markets, gates, tombs, and other buildings are described from contemporary Arabic and Persian sources, and the statements of these sources are verified, when possible, by those of later writers. The plans of mediaeval Baghdad are, to a certain extent, tenta- tive, but appear to be in the main correct. EGYPT The Date of the Monuments at Hieraconpolis. -In C. R. Acad. Insc. 1900, pp. 695-696, G. Foucart fixes the dates and attribution of the royal monuments discovered in 1898 at Hieraconpolis by means of the inscrip- tions. The name of one king he reads Qab-Bouhi; that of the other Bou- taou. The last king of the first dynasty is, according to the lists of Abydos, Turin, and Saqqarah, Qabouhi; the list of Abydos places Boutaou imme- diately after Qabouhi. Boulaou has been identified with the Boethos, whom Manetho places first in the second dynasty. These results show the his- torical value of the lists and enhance the importance of these monuments of Hieraconpolis as the earliest dated Egyptian monuments. The processes leading to these results are explained in C. R. A cad. Insc. 1901, pp. 228-252, where Foucart discusses the objects represented by the signs denoting the names of the two kings, and shows that they were pronounced Qobouh and Boudja (Qobhou and Boudjaou). As these kings are, respectively, the last of the first dynasty and the first of the second, it is unnecessary to assume a dynasty earlier than Menes. A more elaborate paper is to follow.</page><page sequence="4">456 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. V, 1901 Manetho's Trustworthiness. - In Biblia, XIII, 1901, pp. 390-395, Orlando P. Schmidt discusses Egyptian chronology, with special reference to Borchardt's article in the Agypt. Zeit. referred to by F. L1. Griffith in the Archaeol. Report of the Egyptian Exploration Fund for 1899-1900, p. 22. Schmidt finds that Manetho is absolutely trustworthy (though his work has been tampered with by later writers). He also rejects the theory of a new " dynastic race" from the East, and declares that the Egyptians were from the beginning of one and the same race. BABYLO NIA A Babylonian Inscription. - In Biblia, XIII, 1901, pp. 402-405, a letter to the Times by W. St. Chad Boscawen is printed, in which he calls attention to the importance of a Babylonian inscription found by de Mor- gan at Susa. It is dated about 4500 B.C., and records the purchase of land by "Manishtuirba, King of the city of Kish." The careful survey of the land, the calculation of the value of its produce, and the stipulations as to payments, etc., all show the high organization of society. The Dream of Gudea. - In C. R. A cad. Insc. 1901, pp. 112-128, F. Thu- reau-Dangin gives a translation of part of the inscription on the large cylin- der A from Tello, now in the Louvre (cf. Z. Assyr. III, pp. 232-235). The part translated contains a record of a dream of Gudea, in which Bel urges Nin-girsu to cause a temple to be built at Shirpurla. Gudea prepares to build a temple, but does not know to whom, nor on what plan, to build it. Through Nin-girsu and the goddess Gatumdug he appeals to the goddess Nina, from whom he learns that the temple is to be dedicated to Nin- girsu. Nina also gives advice about making a chariot. Nin-girsu pre- scribes the plan of the temple and the manner of its construction. The rest of the inscription describes the building of the temple. A Dedication to Ghimil-Sin. - In C. R. A cad. Insc. 1901, pp. 256- 257, is a publication of a translation by F. Thureau-Dangin of an inscrip- tion from Tello, dating from about the twenty-fifth century B.c. It records the dedication by Arad-Nannar, patesi of Shirpurla, of a temple to Ghimil- Sin, one of the most powerful of the kings of lower Babylonia. Such dedi- cations to living kings are unusual. SYRIA AND PHOENICIA An Archaeological Journey near Damascus.- In a book entitled Voyage arche'ologique au Saft et dans le Djebel ed-.Dru2z (Paris, 1901, Leroux, 224 pp.; map; 17 pls. 12 figs. 8vo.), R. Dussaud and F. Macler give an account of an archaeological trip in the regions near Damascus, chiefly to the southeast. They publish 412 Safaite inscriptions; almost all mere sig- natures, e.g. "by 'Abd son of Nadam." The grandfather's name is often added. A list of names is appended. From the Djebel ed-Drfiz 104 inscriptions are published. Most of them are Greek of late date, but a few are Nabataean, and still fewer Latin. An Anthropoid Sarcophagus in Venice. - In the A tti del Reale Isti- tuto Veneto di Scienze, Leltere, ed Arte, LIX, 1899-1900, ii, pp. 505-517 (3 pls.), Angelo Scrinzi publishes and discusses a fragment of the lid of an anthropoid sarcophagus in the palazzo Boldih (formerly Bembo) in Venice. The head and bust of a woman are preserved. The work shows Ionic-Greek</page><page sequence="5">ASIA MINOR] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1901 457 influence, though the type was originally Egyptian and the hair reminds us of Assyrian work. Probably the sarcophagus is Cypriote work of the sixth century B.C. The Triad of Heliopolis.-In C. R. Acad. Insc. 1901, pp. 191 f., P. Perdrizet restores the inscription C. R. A cad. Insc. 1900, p. 255, to read, lines 1, 2: I(ovi) O(ptinzo) M(aximo) H(eliopolitano), Veneri, Mercurio; lines 4-5: Ex[responso] divi M(egrin) B(almarcodis). Jupiter, Mercury, and Venus were the sacred triad of Heliopolis. Ibid. pp. 218-221, Perdrizet explains the relief on the soffit of the "temple of the sun" at Baalbek, an eagle holding in his talons a caduceus and in his beak a garland, the ends of which are carried by two putti. The eagle represents Jupiter, the cadu- ceus Mercury, the putti the morning and evening star, both of which are really the same, Venus. The whole is a symbolic representation of the three great deities of Heliopolis. Their Semitic names are unknown. Contributions to the Knowledge of the Syrian Steppe. - In the Z. D. Pal. V. XXIII, 1900, pp. 97-158, Martin Hartmann completes his 'contributions to the knowledge of the Syrian steppe' by publishing a number of late inscriptions (most of which were already known), addenda, and an index of names of places. ASIA MINOR Gargara and the Altar of the Idaean Zeus.--In Jh. Oesterr. Arch. I. IV, 1901, pp. 111-125 (4 figs.), W. Judeich describes a great rock-hewn altar on the Adatepe, north of the Scala of Tschibne, some fifteen miles east of Assos. The ancient Gargara he finds, by examination of ancient texts and comparison with the actual topography, to have been situated in the neighborhood of Tschibne. The early settlement lay inland, probably on the part of the Dikeli Dagh called Odjak Kaya, where are remains of an early settlement. A description of these remains by E. Fabricius is given. The rock-hewn altar is probably that of Zeus. The other sites proposed for Gargara are discussed. On the Sculptures and Inscriptions of Antioch. - In Jb. A rch. I. XVI, 1901, pp. 39-55 (8 figs.), R. Foerster discusses certain of the objects found at Antioch, presenting arguments and parallels to prove that the group of wrestlers is of Egyptian origin, and the crest upon the head of Hermes, a lotos leaf; that the statue of an orator does not represent Julian, and that a rock inscription ascribed to Trajan is a late boundary mark. The German Excavations at Priene. -In the Century, May, 1901, pp. 103-114, A. L. Frothingham, Jr., gives an illustrated account of the excavations at Priene conducted for the Berlin Museum, introduced by a sketch of the history of the city. Mysian Reliefs. - At the Institut de Correspondance Hellinique, January 25, 1899, P. Perdrizet described five Mysian reliefs with inscrip- tions in the British Museum, Athens, and Triglia in Mysia, and reached the conclusion that they were dedicated in the same sanctuary by a thiasus which worshipped Apollo, Artemis, and Cybele, but was especially devoted to the cult of the ?Eb ,"Yfrt-Tro and called itself - 70ro^ At crvvaywy4. The monu- ments belonged to a Megarian colony of the Propontis, probably the ancient Bayllium, on the site of the modern Triglia. They are probably dated by the Bithynian era, and belong in the years 119, 121, and 123 B.C. To the</page><page sequence="6">458 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. V, 1901 same period and place, if not to the same thiasus, belongs the relief in the British Museum discussed by Conze in Athen. Mliitth. XVI, 1891, p. 191. Mysia is particularly rich in native reliefs, and their collection and arrange- ment are much to be desired. (B.C.H. XXIII, 1899, pp. 592-599; p1s. iv, v.) The Bilingual Inscription from Dorylaeum. - In A then. Mitth. XXV, 1900, pp. 445-446, P. Kretschmer publishes notes to the Phrygian text of the inscription Athen. Mitth. XXIII, 1898, p. 362. Lines 6 ff. should read: 'Evaorapva- I S? 1 8ov1O KE. OtLOVO I av av8aKET opov Iav. The last words probably correspond to the close of the Greek text Tai)' 5 7raUrjp 'AqKXq7rtLd, and aSSaKET to a missing verb. GREECE ARCHITECTURE The Origin and Development of the Greek Temple. - In the Gaz. B.-A. 1901, pp. 188-202 (6 figs.), Henri Lechat begins a series of articles on the Greek temple. He finds that it developed from the "i\Mycenaean" megaron. The fagade was first added for adornment; this suggested the peristyle; and finally the opisthodomus was added that the building might be symmetrical. In a second article (ibid. pp. 336-349; 8 figs.) the change from wood and crude brick to stone is treated. The introduction of stone columns brings with it the diminution from the bottom upward instead of the previous inverse diminution. Triglyphs and metopes, mutules and guttae, are survivals from the period of wooden beams. The triglyphs along the sides of the building did not exist when wood was used, as at that time there was no peristyle, but were adopted to make the adornment of the sides agree with that of the faqades. The "Mycenaean " megaron had a flat roof, but sloping roofs of wood must always have existed, and when tiles were invented the sloping roof and gable ends were naturally adopted for temples. The Greek Temples of Sicily and Southern Italy.- At the Novem- ber meeting of the Berl. Arch. Gesellsch., B. Graef reviewed Die griechi- schen Tempel Siciliens und Unteritaliens, by Koldewey and Puchstein, which describes forty temples, besides altars and other buildings, and analyzes the results in a most important supplementary chapter. The authors note the existence of a distinct Achaeo-Doric style, trace the transition from early irregular Doric to the fixed canon, distinguish colonial development from that in the home country, date the Heraeum at Olympia at about 700 B.c., disprove, apparently, the connection of Doric with Mycenaean architecture as well as its origin in wood structure, and trace the Ionic style back to Mycenaean plant-motives through the so-called Aeolic capital. (Arch. Anz. 1900, pp. 200-203.) The Old Temple of Athena on the Acropolis not Restored.--In Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, XII, 1901, pp. 319-326, W. N. Bates shows that the old temple of Athena on the Acropolis was not restored. The Greeks took an oath not to restore temples injured by the Persians (Demosth. in Leocr. 81; Pausan. X, 35, 2-3; Diod. Sic. XI, 29, 1-4). This was revoked about 450 (cf. Plutarch, Pericles, Chap. XVII). The Parthenon was then built to take the place of the old temple, which had not been restored. Examples of other temples which were never restored and of</page><page sequence="7">GREEK ARCHIT.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1901 459 temples rebuilt about 450 B.c. or later are given. The arguments against the existence of the oath are refuted. The Gymnasium at Delphi. - At the Institut de Correspondance Helld- nique, January 11, 1899, Th. Homolle described The Gymnasium at Delphi. It lay (Paus. X, 8, 6-9) near the late church of the KoL4ro-tV T' IIlavay[as. It is mentioned in a number of inscriptions, of which the earliest is the accounts of the TraLt'a1 in the archonship of Caphis (331 B.C.), and the most important the accounts connected with the celebration of the Pythian games in 258 B.c., under the archon Dion II. The accounts include work on the gymnasium, stadium, and hippodrome. The $vTor6, 7rpltarvvXo;, 7rapaspo/l', aoacaptqrcTpta, d7ro8v'rptov, and oXETr'6 are mentioned. It seems that the gymnasium and palaestra were in existence at the end of the fourth century, and that they were used for the training of the native youth and for the accommodation of the athletes who took part in the games. The entire lack of ephebic inscriptions and Delphian dedications seems to show that the natives paid little attention to gymnastic training. Excava- tions in 1898 between the Arachova road and the ravine of Castalia brought to light foundations on two terraces. On the upper terrace nearest the road was a portico, about 180 m. long by 7 m. deep, with a row of Ionic columns in front. At the front of the colonnade, away from the modern road, was a conduit, and 6.50 m. distant a small trench, thus forming an open space equal in length to the portico. We have here the covered (vorrdO, the open 7rapaspotutl (the i-'racOpov of Pausanias), and the oXcrdo which brought the water from Castalia. On the lower terrace was the palaestra, containing a court (13.85 m.), surrounded by several porticoes, from which on two sides chambers opened. To the north of the palaestra proper is a pentagonal area, containing along the east side eleven waterspouts, and in the centre a large basin, 10 m. in diameter and 1.80 m. deep. To the north of these cold baths, a Roman bath was later erected. The building seems to have been altered and repaired in Roman times, but without essential alterations of the plan of the fourth century. (B.C.H. XXIII, 1899, pp. 560-583; pl. xiii.) The Stadium at Delphi.- At the Institut de Correspondance HellM- nique, February 22, 1899, Th. Homolle spoke on The Stadium at Delphi. The situation, indicated by Pausanias (X. 32, 1) as in the highest part of Delphi, has always been known, but the stadium was gradually filled with earth washed down the mountain, and this mass finally destroyed the south side, while the north remained almnost intact. The stadium was nearly a rectangle 177.55 m. long, from flots to Tr1E'Pa, and 25.25 mn. and 25.65 m. wide at the extremities, but 28.50 m. at the centre. The start and finish were marked by slabs of stone cut as at Olympia and Epidaurus. At the west end was a semicircular o',cvdv8rv ; at the east, the semicircular plat- form was occupied by a large gate or triumphal arch, of very poor workman- ship, erected in Roman times. On the north side were twelve rows of stone seats for spectators, at the west and south only six. There were thirteen stairways on the north and south sides, and five in the o'Ev&amp;dvrv. In the centre of the north side is a bench 7 m. long and 1.50 m. deep, evidently the place of honor. In its present form the stadium is the work of Herodes Atticus, but the supporting wall bears one of the oldest inscriptions of Delphi, containing a reference to the sanctuary of Eudromos, and making it</page><page sequence="8">460 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. V, 1901 certain that the Delphic stadium was established in this place in the fifth century. Pindar's language shows that in his time the stadium was at Cirrha as well as the hippodrome. The change to Delphi probably took place dur- ing the Phocian hegemony (458-421 B.C.). The length of the stadium does not accord exactly with the Roman foot, but indicates that the Delphic sta- dium was based on a foot very near the Roman foot of 0.296 m. (B.C.H. XXIII, 1899, pp. 601-615; pl. xiii; 3 cuts.) The Greek Stage. - At the February meeting of the Berl. Arch. Ge- sellsch., B. Graef reviewed O. Puchstein's book, Die griechische Biihne, eine architectonische Untersuchung. The author considers the podium above the proscenium as a real stage, and according to its form distinguishes three types of theatre: (1) with podium extending around the ends of the scene- building, Priene, etc.; (2) with podium reached by inclined approaches, Epidaurus, etc.; (3) with wooden stage erected between large projecting towers. In the third class he puts the first stone building of the Dionysiac theatre, as well as the first period of the theatre at Eretria, and places them both in the fifth century. To the second class he refers the second, which he calls the Lycurgan period of the Dionysiac theatre and the second period at Eretria. His views of pinaces, parascenia, rolling-tracks, etc., are opposed to those of D6rpfeld. (Arch. Anz. 1901, 1, pp. 12-15.) The Supposed Hellenistic Stage. - In replying to E. Bethe's recent article on the Greek stage (Jb. Arch. I. XV, 1900, pp. 59 ff.; see Am. J. Arch. IV, 1900, p. 525), W. Dorpfeld welcomes the admission that the dithy- ramb and the fifth century drama were performed in the orchestra, and over- throws all the proofs of an elevated stage in the fourth and third centuries. The scene on the Assteas vase, in particular, he reminds us, is of a class espe- cially excluded from Greek theatrical representation. (Jb. Arch. I. XVI, 1901, pp. 22-37; 1 cut.) SCULPTURE Sketch of Greek and Roman Sculpture.--In Progress (Chicago), VI, No. 4, January, 1901, pp. 235-275 (32 illustrations), Edmund von Mach publishes a brief history of Greek and Roman sculpture. The Lead Idol in Athens. - In Athen. Mitth. XXV, 1900, pp. 339-340, P. Wolters shows that the lead idol in the National Museum at Athens was bought by Finlay at los, and is identical with the lead image whose genu- ineness was doubted by Ross. Cf. Athen. Mitth. XXIII, 1898, p. 462. Glaucus of Chios. - In Jb. Arch. I. XVI, 1901, pp. 62-68 (1 fig.), E. Per- nice argues that the L~n8pov KO~M'XqTcL invented by Glaucus of Chios was the welding of two heated surfaces, and not any kind of soldering, that being a process already known for some metals in the Mycenaean age. The Mask of Artemis with Two Expressions. - In R. lEt. Gr. 1901, pp. 1-7, M. Collignon discusses Pliny, N.H. XXXVI, 12, where a mask of Artemis by Bupalis and Athenis is said to exist at Chios, which appears to have a sad expression to those who enter, a joyous one to those who go out. The remark is derived from the ciceroni, not from any learned source. The explanation is sought in the fact that in several works of early Ionic art the corners of the mouth turn up, thus giving the appearance of a smile, but the cheeks project so that the corners of the mouth are hidden if the face is seen from the side. The lips of these works are so full that, when the cor- ners of the mouth are hidden, the mouth appears to be pouting.</page><page sequence="9">GREEK SCULPTURE] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1901 461 The Eleusinian Goddesses.- In a book entitled Die Eleusinischen G6tt- innen. Entwickelung ihrer Typen in der attischen Plastik (Strassburg, 1901, K. J. Triibner, 108 pp.; 3 pls. containing 9 figs.; 3 figs. in the text. 4to.), Max Ruhland discusses the types of Demeter and Cora in Attic sculpture. In the fifth century a type of Demeter represented by statues in Berlin and Cherchel and the great Eleusinian relief is found to be slightly earlier than the Athena Parthenos; a type represented by the Demeter of the Capitol (Helbig, Fiihrer, 1, 503) is ascribed to Alcamenes, another type to Praxiteles the elder, to whom, however, no known type of Cora can as yet be ascribed. A type of seated draped Demeter belongs also to the fifth century. In the fourth century, types of Demeter with a veil, Cora with a mantle, and Demeter with a mantle are distinguished. A group of Demeter on a cista, with Cora standing, is discussed, as is also the work of Damophon at Lyco- sura. The latter, ascribed to the second century B.c., had little apparent influence upon the types of the goddesses. The book contains much careful discussion of detail. The Caryatides of the Treasury of Cnidians. -'At the Institut de Correspondance Hell6nique, March 8, 1899, Th. Homolle discussed The Caryatides of the Treasury of Cnidus, one of which has been completely restored by uniting the scattered fragments and supplying in simple fashion the missing parts. The figure belongs to the last half of the sixth century B.c. Eleven fragments show that there were originally two of these figures, symmetrically placed, each with a polus on the head, on which rested a capi- tal. They were therefore architectural, and as the fragments were found near the treasury of Cnidus, as the style of the reliefs on the polus agrees well with that of the Gigantomachia of the treasury, and as the proportions are correct, there can be no doubt that they formed the columns of the front of the building. The necessary effect of solidity is obtained by the firm pose, while the employment of the pedestal and the high polus make need- less a colossal figure, which would be out of proportion to the rest of the building. The figure is taken directly from a well-known Ionian type in sculpture, and the earliest caryatides known, the Horae and Charites on the Amyclaean throne, were the work of an Ionian, Bathycles of Magnesia. The Vitruvian story of the origin of the type has long since been discredited. Caryatides come from the hydrophori and canephori of the cults by the substitution of one weight for another. The type is used early for the sup- ports of mirrors, vases, seats, and thrones, and its development is traceable through early Greek art. It does not seem to come from Chaldaea or As- syria, but may have been derived from Egypt. The polus is Oriental; it is worn by divinities of Asia Minor, as Artemis, Aphrodite, Cybele, and Deme- ter, and their priestesses. The calathus also belongs to the cult of Demeter, and in this figure the polus and capital together form a calathus. Demeter is the special goddess of Cnidus, and also honored at Delphi, hence the choice of this type by the Cnidians seems natural. The word KapvraT7s appears in the terminology of art in the fourth century to denote dancing girls, seemingly in somewhat violent motion. It denotes also the dance of the Laconian girls at Caryae in honor of Artemis. The caryatides, like the calathephori, have a religious origin, and seem to be distinguished by the gesture of the raised hand, with which they sustain the burden on their heads. The two types have been confused in the language of the later</page><page sequence="10">462 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. V, 1901 writers. During the fifth and fourth centuries the name for these compan- ions or worshippers of a divinity was simply KopaL, maidens. (B.C.H. XXIII, 1899, pp. 617-635; pl. vi-viii; 2 cuts.) The Birth of Athena.- In the R. Et. Gr. 1901, pp. 127-137 (1 pl.), S. Reinach publishes a somewhat fragmentary marble relief from Kadi-Keui, the ancient Chalcedon, now in the imperial museum at Constantinople. Zeus is represented between two goddesses, the Ilithyiae, just before the birth of Athena. This is the first known relief representing this scene, and belongs to the latter part of the sixth century B.C., as is shown by its style and the letters of the fragmentary inscription. The vases representing this scene - the moment before the birth - are exclusively black-figured. The birth of Athena is not represented in Corinthian vase-paintings nor in the Ionic series of hydriae from Caere. Two vases with the birth of Athena have inscriptions which may be Megarian, though the vases themselves ap- pear to be Attic. Megarian vase-painters might work at Athens, and put on Attic vases a scene well known at Megara. Chalcedon was a Megarian colony. At Megara there was a temple of the Ilithyiae, the walls of which were doubtless decorated with votive reliefs representing the birth of Athena. From these reliefs the vase-painters and the maker of this relief derived their motives. A Megarian influence in Greek art of the sixth cen- tury is thus seen to have existed. A Statue of a Youth at Athens.- In Athen. Mitth. XXV, 1900, pp. 373-391 (pls. xv, xvi), R. Delbrtick publishes and discusses the statue No. 692 of the Acropolis Museum, a nearly life-size figure of a youth, of fine Parian marble. The measurements of the head correspond very closely to those of the Piombino Apollo. The head certainly belongs with the torso to which it was joined in 1900. The statue is a work of Samo-Naxian art about half a century later than the statues from Ptoos and Megara. A careful comparison with the Ptoan figure (B.C.H. X, 1886, pl. iv) shows the Samian elements in the later work. It is the earliest figure showing a somewhat free movement; the left leg is advanced and slightly bent at the knee, and the head is turned slightly to the left. Other works are discussed in comparison, and the type is traced through later works to the Olympian pediments. The type is probably Parian. The relations of Samian art to the rest of Ionia are not clear; but if the Piombino Apollo can be called Samian, the Ptoan statue may well represent the contemporary Chian school. Samian art reaches Attica only after the younger Parian style has developed, which succeeds a period of Chian influence, and lasts until the time of Polygnotus. The man with the calf shows the earlier stage of Attic art, and the pediment sculptures of the temple of Athena show the modifi- cations due to Chian influence. At the end of the sixth century the Parian influence is seen in a torso now in Athens, seemingly representing a youth striking down an enemy. Later in this series belongs the torso from Daphni (Am. J. Arch. IX; pl. xi). The Acropolis statue cannot well be earlier than 520 B.C. The Group of Harmodius and Aristogiton.- In Rom. Mitth. 1900, pp. 219-222, B. Sauer discusses details of the group of Harmodius and Aris- togiton, with reference to a reconstruction. Two Terra-cottas.- Two terra-cottas are published by R. Wuensch in Rn6m.

One is an archaic female head from</page><page sequence="11">GREEK SCULPTURE] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1901 463 the acropolis of Acrae in Sicily; the other a standing youth, probably from Boeotia, and probably the votive offering of an ephebus to Apollo. New Replicas of the Head of the Athena Parthenos. - In Jh. Oesterr. Arch. 1. IV, 1901, pp. 144-150 (1 pl.; 5 figs.), Ludwig Pollak pub- lishes a marble head in the Glyptothek Ny Carlsberg at Copenhagen, a mar- ble head in his own possession, a small marble head in the National Museum at Athens, and a glass-paste seal in the Berlin Museum. The Ny Carlsberg head has lost the tip of the nose, the sphinx on the helmet, most of the two-winged horses, and almost all the further adornment. In style it is, however, nearer what that of Phidias probably was than any other extant replica. The seal also shows more characteristics of the art of the fifth cen- tury B.C. than do most other copies of the Parthenos. The two other heads are of less importance. The Ny Carlsberg head resembles that of the Ares in the court of the palazzo Borghese. The Ares is therefore from the studio of Phidias. Two further replicas, on ornaments in the possession of the Russian ambassador to the Quirinal, A. J. Nelidow, are to be published elsewhere. A full list of replicas or copies of the Parthenos is given. The Washing of the Feet of Odysseus. - In A then. Mitth. XXV, 1900, pp. 325-338 (pl. xiv; 1 cut), C. Robert publishes (1) a marble relief from Gornphoi in Thessaly, now in Athens, which shows the scene between Eury- cleia and Odysseus in close dependence on the Odyssey. Penelope is stand- ing at the loom, with her back to the other group, apparently unravelling the web. Composition and style of the relief mark it as Thessalian, and of the last part of the fifth century. (2) Somewhat earlier is a "1Melian " relief in Athens, of which only the left half is preserved, containing the seated Odysseus, the head of Eurycleia, and a youthful figure, probably Telemachus, in the background. Probably Eumaeus was represented be- hind Telemachus, while Penelope seems to have been omitted. The pres- ence of Telemachus and Eumaeus is not due to a literary source, but to the desire of the early artist to represent all the important persons of a story. The relief shows a certain resemblance to the Olympian sculptures, and con- firms Furtwiingler's view that the "Melian" reliefs belong to the Ionic art of the islands. The Diomedes of Cresilas. - Brunn's interpretation of a statue in Mu- nich as Diomed carrying off the Palladium is confirmed by a marble hand found in Rome, which must come from a similar original. It is a left hand grasping the base of a long-robed statuette. (P. HARTWIG, Jb. Arch. I. XVI, 1901, pp. 56-61; 5 cuts.) The Argive Hera of Polyclitus.--A marble head in the British Mu- seum, with half-short hair and a broad hair-band, which has been called a Bacchus, so closely resembles the head on Argive coins of the latter part of the fifth century that there can be no doubt it is, like the coins, copied from the gold and ivory statue of Hera made by Polyclitus for the Argive He- raeum, about 420 B.c. In addition to the familiar Doryphorus and Diadu- menus, the metope heads, and even the sculptured anthemion ornament found in the American excavations, give a basis for comparison of style, and show an interestingly close connection between the statue and the sculptures of the temple. The head, with the same distinction of technique between hair and face, seems to be reproduced also in a terra-cotta fragment from the excavations. The form of the crown on some of the coins suggests that the</page><page sequence="12">464 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL.

Pliny, Pausanias, and the Hermes of Praxiteles.--In the Transac- tions of the American Philological Association, XXXI, 1900, pp. 37-45, H. N. Fowler discusses the testimony of Pliny and Pausanias with special refer- ence to an article by Miss Sellers in the Gaz. B.-A. 1897, pp. 119-139. He tries to show that Pliny, N.H. XXXIV, 87, does not refer to the Hermes found at Olympia, and that even if he did his testimony is not to be pre- ferred to that of Pausanias unless its source is known. The Ex-voto of Dacchos.--In B.C.H. XXIII, 1899, pp. 421-485 (pls. ix, x, xi, xii, xxiv, xxv, xxvi; 2 cuts), Th. Homolle publishes the statues of the bases already described in B.C.H. XXI, 1897, p. 598; Am. J. Arch. III, 1899, p. 292. Starting from Preuner's discovery that a similar group, the work of Lysippus, once stood in Pharsalas, Homolle discusses the whole question. He finds that the original monument consisted of seven figures, and that the figure of Sisyphus II at the left, which is some 40 cm. taller than the others, and the missing and uninscribed figure at the right were added later; the latter last of all, and possibly representing a stranger. Preuner's inscription only proves that the statue of Agias at Pharsalus was by Lysippus. It is probable, however, that his brothers were commemo- rated with him. Such a group to three victors nearly a century after their successes can be due only to Daochos. The conclusion is reached that Daochos erected two groups of seven figures, one of bronze at Pharsalus, the other in marble at Delphi; that the marble figures were probably copies of the bronzes; that the statue of Agias and probably those of his brothers, Telemachus and Agelaus, were by Lysippus, and possibly the rest of the group also, though it may have been divided among two or more authors. A care- ful analysis of the sculptures from Delphi leads to the conclusion that the sculptor of the Agias can be found only in the school of Lysippus; that the other nude statues, including Sisyphus II, show such close resemblance to the Agias that their origin must be sought in the same school; that the draped statues may well be of the same school, but the resemblances are not so close as to preclude the hand of an Attic follower of Praxiteles or Scopas. Lysippus borrowed something from Praxiteles and more from Scopas, and in all his innovations kept something from Polyclitus; and therefore the school of Sicyon is connected with the two great preceding schools of Argos and Athens. The inscription of Pharsalus shows that in the Agias at least we have an authentic contemporary copy of a work of Lysippus. The story that Lysippus was self-taught is seen to be greatly exaggerated. He is not independent of the past, but he is above all a faithful pupil of nature. The story of the influence of Eupompus has a basis of truth in the influence of painting on the sculpture of the fourth century in the school of Sicyon. The famous passage "volgoque dicebat ab illis (veteribus) factos quales essent homines, a se quales viderentur esse " is to be interpreted much in the sense proposed by Brunn, that Lysippus endeavored to secure a natural effect by representing things as they appeared to the eye, rather than with the mathe- matical accuracy of a Polyclitus. An Attic Relief at Constantinople.- At the Institut de Correspon- dance Hellinique, on March 8, 1899, G. Leure described a Funerary Bas-Relief</page><page sequence="13">GREEK SCULPTURE] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1901 465 of Attic style in the Museum of Tchinily-Kiosk. The relief is a fragment in the style of the Attic reliefs of the fourth century B.C., and probably came from the Thracian coast. It shows a little maid holding a toilet-box for her mistress, who evidently was represented standing in the portion of the relief now lost. It belongs, therefore, with A ttische Grabreliefs 871 and 875, and is to be interpreted as a combination of the toilet and departure scenes. (B.C.H. XXIII, 1899, pp. 615-617; 1 cut.) The Recently Discovered Greek Bronzes.- In the MIonthly Review, June, 1901, pp. 110-127 (5 pls.; 5 figs), Charles Waldstein publishes a popu- lar discussion of recently discovered Greek bronzes. The bronze youth from Anticythera (Cerigo) he ascribes to Praxiteles or his school, and interprets conjecturally as Hermes the Orator or the Coinfoiter. The crouching marble youth from the same place is regarded as Hellenistic, perhaps Pergamene or Rhodian, and interpreted as fighting, with raised shield on the left arm and sword or spear in the right hand, against an enemy on horseback. The drawing made for the Marquis de Nointel of the metope No. XI of the south side of the Parthenon is cited in comparison. The bronze youth found in November, 1900, at Pompeii (see Figs. 1 and 2), is connected by Waldstein with Pasiteles and regarded as a "precursor of the statue by Stephanos." The bronze charioteer from Delphi is hesitatingly ascribed to Calamis. This figure and the bronze "Hermes" from Anticythera are spoken of as the finest extant Greek bronzes, if not even the finest specimens of Greek sculpture of any kind. The article contains many remarks on the rarity of genuine Greek works, and the reasons therefor, as well as on the styles and motives of the works discussed. In the Gaz. B.-A. 1901, pp. 295-301 (4 figs.), Th. Reinach ascribes the bronze youth from Anticythera to some sculptor of the fourth cen- tury B.C. who was influenced by Polyclitus, possibly the youthful Praxiteles or Euphranor. He interprets the figure as a youth holding a ball, bird, or other rotund object, perhaps playing with a dog which would be at his left side. Ibid. pp. 302-304 (pl.; fig.), S. di Giacomo publishes the bronze from Pompeii, which he regards as a copy of a work of an Attic artist a little earlier than Phidias, who was inspired by the masterpieces of the artists of Argos. The. discoveries at Anticythera are described by P. Cav- vadias in Arch. Anz. 1901, pp. 17-19 (4 figs.), J.H.S. 1901, pp. 205-208 (5 figs.), R. ?t. Gr. 1901, pp. 122-126 (5 figs.), and C. R. Acad. Insc. 1901, pp. 58-63 (3 figs.) and 158-159 (3 pls.). Besides the sculptures, Cavvadias mentions the remains of a ship, an anchor, and sailors' utensils. The Barberini Faun.--In Jb. Arch. I. XVI, 1901, pp. 1-18 (8 cuts), H. Bulle reviews briefly the history of the Barberini Faun, and following out indications of the original parts, suggests changes in the restoration, chiefly the extending of the right leg, which bring out its resemblance to the bronze Sleeping Faun from Herculaneum, and which conform more nearly to ancient ideas. A Votive Relief to Men.- In B.C.H. XXIII, 1899, p. 389 (pl. i), T. H. publishes a very curious relief from the British Museum in honor of Men, of careful workmanship, and uniting a great variety of the attributes and em- blems of this Asiatic divinity. The discussion of the relief by Cecil Smith is to appear later. The Aphrodite of Melos.- In Chron. d. Arts, February 9, 1901, S.

This cannot be restored as Furtwiingler (Masterpieces, p. 377) proposes (cf. I. G. Ins. III, No. 1091), and there is. no reason to connect it with the statue.

The Discovery of the Poseidon of Melos. - In Chron. d. Arts, May 4, 1901, S. Reinach gives, with some comments, the report sent by Charles Tissot, minister of France at Athens from 1876 to 1880, to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. With the Poseidon were found in 1878 an equestrian statue, two statues of draped women, and one of a draped man, in addition to the base with the inscription of Theodoridas. The equestrian statue has dis- appeared. The others are Nos. 235-238 in the National Museum at Athens.</page><page sequence="16">468 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. V, 1901 The Hecate of Menestratus.-In R. Arch. XXXVIII, 1901, pp. 82-93, S. Reinach discusses Pliny, N.H. XXXVI. 32 (Vol. V, p. 110, Jan.), In magna admiratione est Hercules Menestrati et Hecate Ephesi in templo Dianae post aedem, in cuius contemplatione admonent aeditui parcere oculis, tanta mar- moris radiatio est. Cf. Strabo, XIV, p. 641. The statue was probably in the temple. The expression about the marble comes from a misunder- standing of the Greek word upappualpeLv. The statue was so perfect that the goddess seemed to be present in person, in all her divine radiance. To look at the goddess in person was of course dangerous for human eyes. Reliefs in the British Museum.--At the Institut de Correspondance Hellinique, January 11, 1899, P. Perdrizet discussed unpublished Greek reliefs in the British Museum. 1.

The Greek Originals of Figures on the Basis from Sorrento.-- In R6m. Mitth. 1900, pp. 198-210 (2 figs.), W. Amelung discusses the reliefs of the Sorrentine basis (see Rfm. Mitth. 1889, pl. x). The figures of Apollo, Artemis, and Leto represent the three statues of the Palatine Apollo-temple, the work respectively of Scopas, Timotheus, and the younger Cephisodotus. This is the first authentic copy of a work of Scopas. The writer is led to this conclusion chiefly by a new interpretation of Propert. III. 31, 5 f. On another side of the basis, the figure of Mars Ultor is a representa- tion of the statue in the temple of the Forum of Augustus, -a statue from a Greek original, contemporary with the acrolithic statue of Mars at Halicar- nassus. At the left of Mars is the Genius of Augustus; at the right, a figure of Venus has been lost. VASES Primitive Painted Pottery in Crete. - The pre-Mycenaean pottery of Crete, first known at Camares, has been found in great quantities in the lower town of Cnossus and in a few examples in the Dictaean Cave. These finds are classified, described, and illustrated by D. G. Hogarth and F. B. Welch in J.H.S. XXI, 1901, pp. 78-99; 31 figs. The ware shows the same patterns as the earlier dark incised pottery, but is quite distinct from Mycenaean, both in the stiff conventionality of the ornament and in its technique, the chief peculiarities of which are a body-glaze, plastic ornament, and imitation of metal work.

C. Hoppin publishes a red-figured Attic hydria in his possession. The date is not later than 470 B.C., probably between 480 and 470. Hermes with a sword is pursuing Argos, beside whom runs Io in the form of a heifer. Zeus, Hera, and a priestess are present. Tile Heraeum is indicated by a column and an altar, the sacred grove by bushes. Other representations of the myth are cata- logued. In the nineteenth ode of Bacchylides and in the Supplices of Aeschylus, Io appears, as on this vase, in the form of a heifer. Other vases show the same form as late as 475 B.c. In the Prometheus of Aeschylus, Io is a horned maiden, and in this form she appears on a vase certainly later than 475 B.c., and oil all later monuments. The Supplices is then earlier than 475 B.C., therefore the earliest extant play of Aeschylus. The Pro- metheus is later than 475 B.c.; probably the date adopted by von Christ-- not much before 468 B.C. - is correct. Assteas and the Greek Stage. - In Hermes, 1901, pp. 81-86, B. Graef discusses the vase by Assteas in Madrid, with the representation of Heracles killing his children, which E. Bethe, Jb. Arch. I, XV, 1900, pp. 59 ff., thinks gives us information about the Greek stage. Graef shows that this is not the case. He also discusses the S. Angelo terra-cotta with its representa- tion of a Roman stage, which Bethe, l.c. p. 61, republishes after Petersen, R6m. Mitth. XII, 1897, p. 340. A corrected drawing of the scene on the vase by Assteas is given in Arch. Anz. 1900, p. 224. Silenus'before Midas. - A vase in the Naples Museum, published by H. Lucas in R6m. MIitth. 1900, pp. 229-234.(2 figs.), shows in relief six figures, the central one Silenus, who is brought before Midas, seated on the right. The scene has been elsewhere explained as representing Heracles before Busiris. A Vase with a Scene of a Drama.--In R1m. Mirth. XV, 1900, pp. 261-269 (1 pl.; 2 figs.), Giulio Em. Rizzo describes a vase found at Centu- ripe and now in Catania. He assigns it to Cumae and to the middle of the third century B.C. On one side is represented a ekna$, on a stage ap- proached by stairs in front, about 1 m. high. The characters are Heracles, Hermes, and a woman, and it is suggested that the subject is drawn from the Alcestis of Euripides. Notes on Greek Vases. - In Hermes, 1901, pp. 94-96, B. Graef inter- prets as Dionysus the figure hitherto regarded as female which follows Hephaestus on the vase published by Loeschke, Athen. Mitth. XIX, pl. viii. Ibid. pp. 96-97, he explains that the goat satyr on the black-figured vase published by Bethe, Prolegomena zur Geschichte des Theaters, p. 339, is not beardless, but his beard is supposed to be hidden, as his head is turned away. Ibid. pp. 97-102 (fig.), he shows that the figure fighting with bow and arrow among the gods to the left of the chariot of Ares and Aphrodite on the Melian vase with representation of the battle of the gods and giants (Monuments Grecs, 1875, pls. i, ii, Wiener Vorlegebldtter, VIII, 7) is Bendis. Her headdress, with a griffin's comb upon it, was first given to Thracians, then to Asiatics. ibid. pp. 102-106, he shows by comparison with Attic and Italic vases and other works of art that the vase from Ruvo with the Talus episode of the Argonautic myth is not Attic, but was made in lower Italy.</page><page sequence="18">470 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. V, 1901 INSCRIPTIONS Studies in Greek Agonistic Inscriptions. -In the Transactions of the American Philological Association, XXXI, 1900, pp. 112-137, Edward Capps discusses agonistic or choregic inscriptions, especially those of Delos and Delphi. He identifies a number of persons mentioned, and corrects some readings given by editors of the texts. The omission of the mention of the didascalus after the mention of the choreutae in Soteric inscriptions of Delphi shows that the chorus was trained by the same man who trained the actors, and therefore that it had an essential part in the play even in the days of the New Comedy. The Inscription C.I. G. I, 1118.--In Rhein. Mus. 1901, pp. 233-246, M.

III, 1900, pp. 144 ff.), and a new reading. He finds it impossible to assign any definite date, though the decree is earlier than the time of Alexander. Not the Decree of Archinus. - The Athenian decree in honor of those who joiied in the return from Phyle (Athen. Mitth. XXIII, 1898, pp. 27 ff.; ibid. XXV, 1900, pp. 34 ff.; cf. Am. J. Arch. III, 1899, p. 131; V, 1901, p. 239) is not the decree of Archinus (Aeschin. III, 187), for in this decree the metics could not have been given precedence over the citizens. It is rather the parallel decree giving similar rewards to the metics, and this is confirmed by the list upon the back of the stone, where the names are for the most part accompanied by the occupations, a procedure unknown in lists of native Athenians, but common enough in the case of metics. The list contains the names of the new citizens arranged by tribes. There seems no place for this decree in the archonship of Pythodorus, and the restoration 4Evat'vcr]os is therefore to be preferred, and the decree of Archinus probably to be dated in the same year. (A. K6RTE, Athen. Mitth. XXV, 1900, pp. 392-397.) Ancient Cretan History.- In the A tti d. R. Istituto Veneto di Scienze, Lettere, ed Arti, Vol. IX, Series vii, 1897-98, pp. 1509-1591, Angelo Scrinzi publishes an account of the war of Lyttos (220 B.c.) and the Cretan treaties, with especial regard to the treaties preserved in the archaeological museum of the Ducal Palace at Venice. The treaties are discussed in detail, a general sketch of Cretan history is prefixed, and an appendix on the KOLWOV TWV Kpn- Tratiov is added. Amphictyonic Decrees in Honor of Dionysiac Artists. - Under the title 'Inscriptions de Delphes: DIcrets amphictyoniques en l'honneur des artistes dionysiaques d'Atheines,' G. Colin publishes in B.C.H. XXIV, 1900, pp. 82-123, two decrees in favor of the Dionysiac artists of Athens. The first is in two parts: First, a decree of the first part of the third century granting the artists various privileges and exemptions; secondly, a con- firmation of these grants in the second half of the second century. A copy set up at Athens, found in 1866, is published in C.I.A. IT, 551. The two copies make possible an almost complete restoration. Colin gives a colla- tion of the documents, and shows that the ancients did not set a high value on minute accuracy in such cases, pointing out the importance of these divergencies for the criticism of the text of Thucydides (V, 47). The docu-</page><page sequence="19">GREEK INsc.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1901 471 ment enables us to complete two lists of hieromnemons. The second decree also existed in Athens, and two fragments are preserved in C.I.A. II, 552 a, and IV 2, 551 c. Colin gives a detailed discussion and commentary on this decree, in the course of which he restores the fragment published by Couve in B.C.H. XVIII, 1894, p. 249. After the preamble the document contains a long account of the services of Athens as the first to form a college of artists, to raise men from barbarism to civilization, to spread abroad the gift of the mysteries, to give men that knowledge of grain which had been received from the gods, and especially as the first to institute thymelic and scenic contests, and as the mother of tragedy and comedy. Because of all these services of Athens, and other good deeds of the artists, the latter are granted the right of Xpvyrocop'a, which they seek, and all Greeks are for- bidden to interfere with its exercise. In B.C.H. XXIV, 1900, pp. 216-221, A. Wilhelm adds some notes on the text of these inscriptions, and observes that the Eleusinian decree (DITTEN- BERGER, Sylloge2, 20) existed in another copy on the Acropolis, of which the small fragment preserved shows several divergencies from the Eleusinian text, although it is contemporary, and apparently by the same stonecutter. New Readings of a Milesian Decree. - In R. -Et. Gr. 1901, pp. 92-96, Maurice Holleaux reprints, with many new readings, the text of lines 1-26 of the inscription published by Haussoullier, R. de Philologie, XXIV, 1900, pp. 243-271. It is a decree of the first years of the third century B.c., passed on the motion of Demodamas, who was strategus of Seleucus Nica- tor and Antiochus I, in which the people of Miletus thank the Prince Antiochus (afterward Antiochus I) for his generosity to the temple of Didymaean Apollo. A Naxian Inscription. - The rock-cut Naxian inscription, C.I. G. 2422= I.G.A. 411, is published in facsimile by Paul Kretschmer, Jh. Oesterr. Arch. L IV, 1901, pp. 142-144, and read Aopo04a Ka(' ) Kapt'wv. oidfAiys. The last word is equivalent to 7-rpvo.o A rude graffito of a plough below the inscription may refer to the relation of the two slaves, Carion and Dorophea. The New Fragments of Archilochus. - In R. -t. Gr. 1901, pp. 71-91, Am. Hauvette discusses the new fragments of Archilochus published from papyri in Strassburg (by REITZENSTEIN, Sitzb. Berl. Akad. 1899, pp. 857 ff.), and an inscription at Paros (by F. HILLER VON GXRTRINGEN, Athen. Mitth. 1900, pp. 1-22; cf. Am. J. Arch. 1901, p. 98). He finds that the papyrus fragments are properly ascribed to Archilochus, and gives a variety of notes on all the fragments. On an Inscription from Patmos. -In R. PAt. Gr. 1900, pp. 464-466, M. Holleaux suggests in the inscription from Patmos (DITTENBERGER, Sylloge 2, No. 681), at the beginning of 1. 17, rh 'EpE/ata for TacroLcuaa, and at the end of the inscription 8 Tpepo';v[y 70 'Epoi Jcrrao] 'Hycrcvpov. Unpublished Rhodian Inscriptions. -In the A tti d. R. Istituto Veneto di Scienze, Lettere, ed Arti, LVII, 1898-99, pp. 252-286, Angelo Scrinzi has published, from the manuscript of the Swedish Dr. Hedenborg, who lived many years at Rhodes, and died in 1864, forty-six inscriptions. Several of these supplement fragmentary inscriptions published elsewhere, the most important being HILLER V. GXRTRINGEN, Inscriptiones Graecae Rhodi, etc. (in the new C.LG.), Nos. 108 and 926.</page><page sequence="20">472 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. V, 1901 Inscriptions from Tegea, Antioch, and Dokimion. -In B.C.H. XXIV, 1900, pp. 285-299, pl. viii, P. Perdrizet publishes (1) A Tegean inscription (B.C.H. XVII, 1893, p. 14; DITTENTBERGER, Sylloge,2 No. 700) from a new copy and a photograph. It is of great interest for the history of Greek dramatic contests. (2) Two inscriptions from Antioch on the Orontes. The first, q luadKpa ropyovlov clpKa, shows LadKpa (= UacKTpa) in the sense of sar- cophagus or tomb, and the mixture of Latin words in the Greek of Antioch, since apKa=arca. The second is an epitaph of the ordinary Syrian type, followed by an extract from the will, which contains the word KLpKILra = circensia. (3) A Christian inscription from Dokimion in Phrygia (B.C.H. XVII, 1893, p. 291; RAMSAY, Cities and Bishoprics of Phrygia, p. 745, No. 689), which is here interpreted as a talisman against 06ovo;, i.e. the Evil Eye. This use of 500vo; is studied, and the inscription discussed from lit- erary and historical points of view. Inscriptions from Thebes and Charadrus. - At the Institut de Cor- respondance Hellinique, January 25, 1899, Th. Homnolle presented two unpublished inscriptions. One from the Cabirium of Thebes, probably of the second half of the third century, runs as follows: - 'Acro-7r0KX.'0mo cpXOVTO ?E/EL.vU 7r0 TOJV TEXEcTTP ELppV To 7rp~ VpOV Ka/lpv K) rrat8L, lapEtd88ovroT Fo$ vw 'A0avo8oplo', 'IlEELtVtKETRo a.LaMo6, KCfLtpL- apxt6vrJwv KpTroXado Kov8owvW, A-roXado XapXdalo, I r0vovos TqL6;vkao, ypal.- pwa'rvov ro L NLKLIO [ EVOKparTEIJ. The other is an inscription in honor of Septimius Severus from Charadrus in Cilicia, in which that town is called rrwivEov of Lamos. It is thus of importance for the situation of Lamos, the exact position of which has been disputed. It is now clear that it must have been in the upper part of the valley of the Charadrus. (B.C.H. XXIII, 1899, pp. 587-592.) Carnea at Thera. -In Hermes, 1901, pp. 134-139, F. Hiller v. Gdrtrin- gen publishes an inscription of about 500 B.C. cut in the rock, not far from the Zoodochos Pege in Thera. He reads the inscription 'AyXrlE'X-q ,rpr-L(c- -o cdyopav hLKd&amp; I Ka[p]vita Oe6v rwrv [t]$ev ho(;)vt7ravT'UIa Ka  AaKapfr, and gives as its meaning: " Agloteles, son of Enipantidas and Lakarto, first of all in public speaking, prepared for the God a Carnean feast on the twen- tieth (of the month Carneus)." Two Inscriptions Containing Curses. - In Jh. Oesterr. Arch. I. IV, 1901, Beiblatt, pp. 9-18 (2 figs.), A. Wilhelm shows that the curse in Buka- rest (DITTENBERGER, Sylloge 2, 816) is not the one published in Le Bas' col- lection (Iles, 2054; cf. Expedition de More'e, III, pl. 13), which is now in the National Museum at Athens. The text of the two inscriptions is given. They are alike but for the names, Heraclea and Marthine, of the dead women whose murderers are cursed, and one superfluous word in the Bukarest in- scription. They are from Rheneia, and belong to the second or early first century B.C. The writers were evidently Jews. The gravestones of a'Hpd- KX-qa and MapOdvy (C.I.G. II, add. 2322 b, 69 and 78) may be those of the persons referred to in the curses. The Pontarch and the 'ApXLpEiEST II6rov. - In the R. Et. Gr. 1901, pp. 138-141, Franz Cumont comments on part of an inscription copied by An- derson at Sebastopolis in Pontus (Soulou-Serai) in 1899 (see J.H.S. 1900, p. 154). It celebrates a man who has been made a citizen of Tomi, M.</page><page sequence="21">GREEK INSC.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1901 473 'AvTrv&amp;ov Zepyla Po0 ov ... 7orovrapXoavra IT v El Tl/rp-vprOXE 70^ T IvrovT NEoKaLrTapcla. The title "Pontarch " is analogous to Asiarch, Galatarch, etc. There were three Pontarchs; (1) of the Pontic hexapolis, the metropolis of which was Tomi, (2) of the Greek cities of the northern coast of Asia Minor, the metropolis of which was Amastris or Heraclea, (3) of the Pontus Medi- terraneus. This inscription states that the Pontarch at Tomi wore a crown of gold and a purple robe. These were insignia of the &amp;ppXepcvg. The view that the Pontarch and the chief priest were identical therefore receives confirmation. The Greek Inscription of the Temple of the Dioscuri at Naples.-- In the Arch. Stor. Nap. 1901, pp. 315-322, Vittorio Spinazzola publishes a fragment of the inscription C.I.G. 57962; I. G. Sic. It. 714. The fragment was found in the cloister of the Certosa di S. Martino on the back of an inscription in honor of D. Didaco Manriquez, Marquis of Casella, dated 1637 A.D. The inscription on the epistyle of the temple is now seen to have been in two lines. The reports of earlier writers about this temple, now the church of San Paolo Maggiore, are discussed. A Greek Inscription from Pozzuoli. - In C. R. A cad. Insc. 1901, pp. 192-196, R. Cagnat publishes the inscription from Pozzuoli (Not. Scavi, 1901, p. 167) now in the museum of the University of Michigan, and restores it as follows: 'Er v"7droaTwv AOVKOov Kate-.......

Berger confirms the connection of 'ApeiErrwvYd with Arfa. Ibid. p. 200, Clermont-Ganneau suggests for ?OEs ['HX] to (1. 4), Oco- &lt;r[E'f3[to. The reference would then be to a journey by a Tyrian Theosobius, and 'yayiv s~ "HXeqt would refer to the accomplishment of some sacred rites by him. Inscriptions from Various Places.-- In R. Et. Gr., 1900, pp. 493-503 A. E. Contoleon gives the text of seven simple epitaphs from Athens, two from Peiraeus, one longer epitaph dated 205 A.D., from Thessalonica, a short inscription for a base of a statue from Volo, a dedication to Hermes Kranaios from Crete, an epitaph from Pergamum, three epitaphs and three fragments from Ephesus, an epitaph (?) from Magnesia on the Maeander, nine inscriptions from Smyrna, one of which is part of a list of daphne- phori, another a dedication, the rest apparently epitaphs, an epitaph from the Cilbian Plain in Lydia, a lead seal from Coloe, two epitaphs (one with a curse) from Magnesia ad Sipylum, a record of a sale from Philadelphia, an epitaph (?) from Thyatira, twelve inscriptions from Tralles, most of which are epitaphs, one an inscription of some mystae, an epitaph from Apamea, an epitaph from Attuda (?), three from Philomelium, and two from Isbarta. Notes on Inscriptions. -In the Revue des Etudes Anciennes, 1901, pp. 115-130, Maurice Holleaux gives notes on the following inscriptions: DITTENBERGER, Sylloge,2 No. 247, No. 330, No. 790; DITTENBERGER, Sylloge,j No. 158; 0.

Ancient Stenography. - Two articles on ancient short-hand, in the new Archiv fir Stenographie, were discussed by M. Rubenstein at the March meeting of the Berl. Arch. Gesellsch. He reasoned from the occurrence of Greek short-hand signs on. the tablet on the gravestone of a schoolboy, found in Dalmatia, that short-hand was a part of ordinary education. If this tablet could be read, it might give the key to the numerous, as yet undeciphered, papyrus documents in short-hand. (Arch. Anz. 1901, p. 16.) GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS The Discoveries at Cnossus. - In the Annual of the British School at Athens, VI, 1899-1900, pp. 3-70 (2 pls.; 12 figs.), Arthur J. Evans describes the excavations conducted by him in the palace at Cnossus (see Am. J. Arch. 1900, p. 490; 1901, p. 94). This is the most detailed account yet published. Ibid. pp. 70-85 (5 pls.; 14 figs.), D. G. Hogarth describes excavations and explorations at Cnossus outside of the ancient palace. Houses and walls were found of various dates, some belonging to the period of the Kamares pottery, the time to which the earliest walls of the palace belong, which Mr. Evans places approximately at 2000 B.C. In rooms here and at Melos square pillars are found which have no structural purpose. Perhaps they were objects of worship. Ibid. pp. 85-92, F. B. Welch contributes 'Notes on the Pottery.' The earliest pottery of Cnossus belongs to the neolithic age. This is followed by Kamares ware, and this by Mycenaean ware. The Mycenaean ware is for the most part of the third class with Firnissmalerei distinguished by Furtwiingler and Loeschcke. Geometric ware is poor. The discovery of some ware similar to vases found in Palestine, Syria, and Cyprus indicates Phoenician manufacture. At the March meeting of the Berl. Arch. Gesellsch., R. Zahn discussed in some detail the Mycenaean palace at Cnossus. He noted the superiority of the frescoes over similar work in Egypt, the social atmosphere indicated by the position of women, the religious meaning of the pillar and horns, the Artemis-character of the Mycenaean goddess, the probable Cretan origin of "1Mycenaean" pottery, and especially the cult-origin of the Cretan picto- graphic symbols, which he interprets differently from Evans, and which he considers as at a less advanced stage than the earliest Egyptian hieroglyphs. (Arch. Anz. 1901, pp. 19-25.) Prehistoric Crete. - In the Chron. d. Arts, June 15, 1901, S. Reinach begins a series of articles on prehistoric Crete. The first article tells of the discoveries of various men, from Buondelmonte, in 1422, to Halbherr, Orsi, and Fabricius, with special mention of W. J. Stillman. In the second and third articles (June 29) the discovery of the great inscription at Gortyn and of some dome tombs is described, and to Milchhoefer the credit is given of first seeing clearly the importance of Crete in the study of "Mycenaean" civilization. The connection of Crete with southern Italy, as shown by Ettore Pais, is emphasized. In the same number is a summary of a discus- sion by E. Pottier of the recent excavations at Cnossus, at the meeting of</page><page sequence="23">GREEK MISc.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1901 475 the Academie des Inscriptions, June 7. In this attention is directed to evi- dences of Egyptian and Babylonian influence at Cnossus. Recent Discoveries in Greece and the Mycenaean Age.--In the North American Review, March, 1901, pp. 431-444, Charles Waldstein con- tributes an article on recent discoveries in Crete, at the Argive Heraeum, and elsewhere, emphasizing the importance of the new light they shed upon early ages in Greece. Mycenaean Tree and Pillar Cult.- An article by A. J. Evans in J.H.S. XXI, 1901, pp. 99-204 (1 pl.; 70 cuts), presents and interprets, under thirty sub-headings, the mass of available evidence on the Mycenaean religion with its widespread connections and survivals. It was an aniconic cult, allied to the primitive Semitic worship, the divine presence being adored in trees and in pillars of stone or wood, either free-standing or structural, which became sacred symbols like the Christian cross. Cult scenes, or at least the sacred object, often with guardian beasts, are found on Mycenaean cylinders, ring- seals, frescoes, vases, sculpture, as the Lion Gate, and in actual existence, in the megalithic sepulchral structures of the Mediterranean islands. The divinities, a male and a female, originally a light-god and his consort, sur- vived as the Cretan and Carian Zeus, the Thracian and Roman Mars, the Amyclaean Apollo, as Dione, Cybele, and the various forms of Aphrodite. The aniconic character was never wholly superseded, even in Greece, by the Hellenic anthropomorphic conception, and it continues almost unchanged in Moslem usage down to the present day. Scenes on the Shield of Achilles.- In R. Arch. XXXVIII, 1901, pp. 198-212 (11 figs.), A. Moret compares paintings on the walls of Egyptian tombs with those parts of the Homeric description of the shield of Achilles which relate to tilling the soil (Iliad, XVIII, 541-547), harvesting (ibid. 550-560), the vintage (ibid. 561-568), and the cattle attacked by lions (ibid. 573-586). The Ionic poets might have known the Egyptian paintings directly or through the Phoenicians. The Connection of Phidias with the Parthenon. - In Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, XII, 1901, pp. 211-220, Harold N. Fowler discusses the origin of the statements contained in Plutarch's 'Life of Pericles,' Chap- ter XIII. He finds that the statements connecting Phidias with the Parthe- non are derived through Ephorus from Stesimbrotus, who wished by them to cast a slur upon Pericles. The statements deserve no credence. There is, therefore, no evidence of any connection of Phidias with the Parthenon, unless it be derived from the style of the sculptures. Primitive Arcadian Worship. -- At the Institut de Correspondance Hellinique on March 22, 1899, P. Perdrizet spoke on terra-cottas from Lycosura and Arcadian mythology. At Lycosura many terra-cottas have been found representing a draped female divinity with the head of a cow or sheep. These are the &amp;ydacXpara which were offered to ArtroLva accord- ing to the ritual, and seem to belong to Roman times. They are soon to be published in the B. C.H. Pausanias (VIII, 42) says that at Phigalia a horse- headed Demeter was worshipped. Arcadia preserved the original pre-Dorian cults, and to them belong these deities with the heads of animals. Such divinities are found in precisely those places where Dorian influence did not penetrate, as in Cyprus, Ionia, and Etruria, which is influenced by Ionia. These divinities are not to be attributed to Egyptian or Semitic influence,</page><page sequence="24">476 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. V, 1901 but to primitive cults of the Pelasgian Arcadians. Zeus Lycaeus is a wolf- god. (B.C.H. XXIII, 1899, pp. 635-638; 1 cut.) The So-called Capuchin Plans of Athens. - In Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, XII, 1901, pp. 221-230 (2 pls.), J. R. Wheeler discusses two plans of Athens, the one published by Guillet de St. Georges in 1675 and the one published by Laborde in 1854. The second is derived from a drawing brought back from the Levant by French engineers in 1685. The conclusions reached are that Guillet's plan is derived from an older original than the plan of the engineers, but that it is not safe to draw inferences from it touching the continued existence in the seventeenth century of the ruins which the map shows. Dbrpfeld's contention that Guillet's plan proves the existence of the Enneacrunus west of the Acropolis in the seventeenth century is not justified. History of Investigations at Paros.-In A then. Mitth. XXV, 1900, pp. 341-372 (pls. v, vi), O. Rubensohn, in the first of a series of articles on Paros, publishes, from a manuscript of the fifteenth century, Buondelionte's account, completed in 1420. It is accurate, but the map is defective. Ciriaco of Ancona was at Paros twice in 1445). Rubensohn publishes his description from a Munich manuscript, and also a letter now in Florence. Several of Ciriaco's drawings are also published. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries only Francesco Piacenza, who was at Paros in 1660, left a record of any importance. More recent works on the island are briefly discussed. Aegis-'Aypiv6v.--In B.C.H. XXIV, 1900, pp. 254-262 (2 cuts), Miss Jane E. Harrison supplements her discussion of the omphalos (J.H.S. XIX, 1899, p. 225) by a consideration of the fillets or network with which it is often covered. Aegis denotes not merely the goatskin worn in the time of Herodotus (IV, 188-189) by the Libyans, but also T - Sth ra\ Uc/tdrov 7rcrk/yeY- vov 8t'KTVOV (Suid.). The dyprjvdv is defined by Pollux (Ono7n. IV, 116) as E-y/Aca de Epiov LK-VOEL~tE \7rEpL 7r' -6V r5 ori/La, 6 TcLpcota, 31rcf3cXkcro y 7tL XAAoq MCdvrtL. Therefore the &amp;t'Krvov of the omphalos is an &amp;ypvovdy. The ropyo'vo (Eur. Ion, 225) are also remains of the primitive skin garment. The Gorgoneion is originally the goat's head, worn with the skin. When the oracle was transferred to Zeus and Apollo these heads, which had remained as prophylactic masks, became the eagles, frequently represented on either side of the omphalos. The Modesty of the Scythians. - In Hermes, 1901, pp. 86-94, B. Graef discusses the golden gorytus from Nicopolis (Compte Rendu, 1864, pl. iv; Wiener Vorlegebldtter, Series B, pl. 10), which Robert, Arch. Anz. 1889, p. 151, Nekyia (Sixteenth Hallisches Winckcelmannsprogramm), p. 38, connects with the art of Polygnotus. Graef shows that the work is of a date much later than Polygnotus, and can have no immediate connection with his work. Its execution is good, but the workman has no artistic ability. He was per- haps not a Greek at all. The drapery is, as is often the case in modern works, unnaturally arranged so as to cover the private parts of the men. This is not a Greek trait, but shows that the gorytus was made for a Scythian buyer. Weights from Thera. - In Hermes, 1901, pp. 113-133, F. Hiller v. Gair- tringen describes some weights found at Thera, and C. F. Lehmann discusses the development of the system of weights from early Babylonian to Roman times.</page><page sequence="25">ITAL.

ITALY ARCHITECTURE The Arch of Tiberius. - Near the temple of Saturn, between the rostra and the Basilica Julia, foundations have been found which are certainly those of the arch of Tiberius. (Berl. Phil. W. February 23, 1901.) The Temple of Venus Pompeiana. -A. Mau describes in detail in rnm. llitth. XV, 1900, pp. 270-308 (2 pls.; 10 figs.), the remains of the Tem- ple of Venus Pompeiana recently excavated at Pompeii, west of the Basilica. The earliest temple and surrounding colonnade were of tufa. At the begin- ning of the empire, a marble temple was built, hexastyle, with antae, of which the remains are considerable, not only of the foundations, but of the marble decoration. On the completion of this temple, a two-storied marble colonnade was begun, on a larger scale than the original one of tufa. This was incomplete when, together with the temple, it was overthrown by the earthquake of 63 A.D. A new and larger temple was begun, but the founda- tions were unfinished in 79 A.D. If it had been completed, it would have been the largest and finest temple in Pompeii. SCULPTURE A Roman Imitation of a Greek Demeter. - In Ram. Mitth. 1900, pp. 181-197 (2 pls.; 3 figs.), W. Amelung discusses a draped female figure. The face is Roman, is possibly a portrait of the wife of Lucius Verus, but the remainder of the figure, including the head, is a good copy of a Gr1eek original of the second quarter of the fifth century B.C. The origintal was of bronze, and probably represented Demeter. Other existing works are com- pared, especially the Hestia Giustiniani and the Aspasia in Berlin, antd are shown to be of the same origin. The writer believes this type to have been developed by Onatas of Aegina, though he admits that the proof is insufficient. The Dioscuri of the Quirinal. - E. Petersen has made a minute study of the Dioscuri of the Quirinal, of which he gives the result in R6m. Mitth. XV, 1900, pp. 309-351 (3 figs.). Marks on the figures and their artistic treatment show that both men and horses originally stood in high relief against a flat wall. They have always occupied the same relative positions as at present. The Dioscuri are commonly connected with springs or foun- tains; for example, in the precinct of Juturna, their statues stood ill the middle of the lacus, an altar between them. It is probable that the statues of the Quirinal formed a part of one of the numerous fountains of Rome. Reliefs relating to the Dioscuri.--In R. Arch. XXXVIII, 1901, pp. 46-58 (4 figs.), G. Gastinel discusses five fragmentary terra-cotta reliefs</page><page sequence="26">478 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. V, 1901 from Tarentum. Three represent each a youth beside or near whom is an amphora. One youth stands beside a horse. One relief represents the Dioscuri riding in triumph, and one represents them coming to a sacred banquet. All the reliefs relate to the Dioscuri. The amphora was a regular attribute of the Dioscuri at Tarentum. These reliefs were probably set up in the houses of members of a fraternity of Dioscuriastae. The Relief with the Inscription C.I.L. VI, 426. --In the Sitzb. Berl. Akad. 1901, pp. 387-398 (2 figs.), R. Kekule v. Stradonitz discusses the relief with the inscription I(ovi) O(ptimo) MA(aximo) Summo Exsuperantis- simo, first published by Spon and then by Winckelmann. The relief had disappeared, but has recently been bought by the Berlin Museum. It repre- sents Zeus with a cornucopia. The drapery, beard, and hair are archa- istic. It is shown that this relief was one side of a square base. On the side adjoining to the left was a relief of one of the Dioscuri with no archaistic qualities. The other two sides have disappeared. The in- scription belongs at earliest not much before 200 A.D., perhaps somewhat later. Reliefs and inscription belong to the same time. This is interest- ing, as it fixes a later date than has hitherto been assumed for a " New- Attic " relief. The Poros Statue in Munich. - In Athen. 3litth. XXV, 1900, pp. 447- 450 (1 cut), C. Walzinger identifies the statue of a warrior published by Furtwingler (Athen. Mlitth. XXI, 1896, pl. i) with a figure bought at Chiusi in 1827 by Dorow, and published by him in his Voyage arche'ologique dans l'ancienne Etrurie, Paris, 1829. The work therefore belongs to Etruscan art, where it has many analogies, and not among the Greek poros sculptures, where it was placed by Furtwifngler. VASES AND PAINTING Pottery from Pitigliano. - In Jb. Arch. I. XV, 1900, pp. 155-195 (32 figs.), J. Boehlau discusses the pottery from five early Etruscan tombs at Pitigliano (ancient Statonia?), the contents of which, illustrating the development of Italian ceramics under the influence of Greek importation down to the sixth century B.C., have passed to the Berlin Museum. He notes the frequent application of foreign decoration and detail to native forms and vice versa, the metallic origin of many forms, the Eastern origin of the crater and its pedestal, among others, and the effect of the change from burning to burial of the dead. The Frescoes of Boscoreale.--In the Gaz. B.-A. 1901, pp. 15-26 (8 figs.), S. di Giacomo describes the house where the new frescoes were found (cf. Am. J. Arch. 1901, p. 102) and the one where the treasure of silverware now in the Louvre was found some years ago. The new frescoes show a style of architecture not like any of the styles hitherto known in Pompeian wall paintings, and not corresponding with the statements of Vitruvius, VII, 5. Perhaps in the last period of Pompeii there may have been an awakening of better art and more reasonable decoration. Even the human figures represented in the new frescoes depart from the earlier traditions. The Alexander Mosaic at Pompeii. - In some sixteenth-century woodcuts and possibly in Raphael's cartoons and compositions by Leonardo, J. Kemke sees such resemblance to the Pompeian mosaic of Alexander's</page><page sequence="27">ITAL. MIsc.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1901 479 battle with Darius, discovered in 1831, as to suggest direct imitation. Some form of the entire picture seems then to have been accessible to artists of the Renaissance. (Jb. Arch. I. XVI, 1901, pp. 69-73; cut.) INSCRIPTIONS The Archaic Inscription from the Comitium. - In Rhein. Mus. 1901, pp. 161-166, R. Thurneysen proposes some new readings and explanations of parts of the early inscription found in the comitium at Rome. His dis- cussion is chiefly linguistic. He accepts as the date the second half of the sixth century B.C. In Jh. Oesterr. Arch. I. IV, 1901, Beiblatt, pp. 47-56, O. Keller reviews some recent discussions of the inscription, the grave of Romulus, and the two lions, with special reference to the two lions and the scholia of the Pseudo-Acronius. The date of " about 500 " is accepted. In Archaeologia, LVII, i, 1900, pp. 175-184, is a description of the early monu- ments in the comitium by Giacomo Boni, translated by St. Clair Baddeley. The paper was read Janluary 25, 1900. A photographic facsimile of the archaic inscription on the stele is given. COINS The Arch on the Bronze of Antoninus. - In R6m. Mitth. XV, 1900, pp. 352-354, E. Petersen argues that the arch on the large bronze of Antoninus Pius is a part of the Aemilian bridge, and does not represent the ship houses by the Aventine. GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS Some Antiquities in Sicily. - In Rom. Mitth. 1900, pp. 237-260 (1 pl.; 4 figs.), Giulio Em. Rizzo describes a collection of antiquities found in the necropolis near Randazzo, Sicily, and owned by Paolo Vagliasindi of Ran- dazzo. The necropolis was in use from the first quarter of the fifth century to about 125 B.C. The collection includes Attic and Italian vases, terra- cottas, bronzes, etc., most of which are of little value. Most important is a red-figured oenochoe, of Attic make, dating from about 350 B.c.; it shows the sons of Boreas freeing Phineus from the Harpies. In the same article the writer describes an archaic Panathenaic amphora, privately owned in Catania. It was found in the Greek Catania, and is important, because such vases have been rarely found in Sicily. The Sarcophagus recently found near Perugia. - The sarcophagus, described Am. J. Arch. 1901, p. 103, is described by F. Moretti, Not. Scavi, 1900, pp. 553-557; 7 figs. Continuing the discussion of the tomb in which the sarcophagus was found (pp. 558-561), L. Savignoni shows a remarkable similarity between its equipment and that of a tomb at Todi (Not. Scavi, 1886, pp. 358 ff.), and assigns them both to the third century B.C. He thinks that the winged female figure on the engraved mirror is not Venus, but one of her attendants. The Gallic Cemetery at Montefortino.- A burial-place of the Seno- nian Gauls near Arcevia, which was opened in 1895-96, and is described by E. Brizio in Mon. Antichi, IX, 1901, pp. 617-792 (12 pls.; 31 cuts), gives important evidence of the high degree of civilization attained by the Gauls in the fourth century B.C., their wealth, mode of life, and commercial rela-</page><page sequence="28">480 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL.

Mitth. 1900, pp. 223-228, M. Rostowzew shows that gladiatorial combats were a regular form of exercise among young Romans of good family. They eveni assumed the titles of professionals. This explains the words pinn. iuvenum in a recently found inscription. (Not. Scavi, April, 1900, p. 141), which are to be compared with pinnirapi iuvenes in Juvenial, III, 158, and the scholiast on the passage. The Great Mother of the Gods.- Vol. I, No. 3, of the Philology and Literature Series of the Bulletin of the University of Wisconsin (110 pp.; 4 pls.; 2 cuts; Madison, 1901), is entitled 'The Great Mother of the Gods.' The author, Dr. Grant Showerman, aims in this work to give the complete history of a single pagan religion, and has presented in orderly narrative all available information regarding the Great Mother, from her first appearance in Asiatic and Greek history to her fall in the last days of the Roman Empire. The work is divided into seven chapters, of which the first relates the circumstances of the introduction of the Great Mother at Rome, and the events which led to it. The second relates what is known of the cult of the Mother prior to its introduction at Rome, and deals with its history in Asia Minor and Greece before 204 B.c. The third chapter treats the cult under the Republic, the fourth, fifth, and sixth its prosperity under the early Eiipire, and its decline and fall, while the last is devoted to a consid- eration of the Great Mother in the art, literature, and religion of the ancient world. This work was done by the author while Fellow in the American School of Classical Studies in Rome (1898-1900), was accepted by the committee, and would have appeared in this JOURNAL had its length permitted. Was Attis at Rome under the Republic ? -In the Transactions of the American Philological Association, XXXI, 1900, pp. 46-59, Grant Showerman finds by investigation of literary and archaeological evidence that the wor- ship of Attis was probably not introduced at Rome until after the end of the Republic. Indians in Ancient Art.--In Jb. Arch. I. XV, 1900, pp. 195-218 (9 figs.), H. Graeven discusses the characterization of Indians in ancient art as shown in a mosaic, a silver plaque, and some ivory carvings, all late work. In the Roman sarcophagi with Indian Bacchic scenes, a list of which is given, no such characterization appears. SPAIN Alhauran the Ancient Iluro ? -In the Bulletin Hispanique of the Revue des Etudes Anciennes, 1901, pp. 1-15, M. R. de Berlanga finds that the mod- ern Alhauran, in the province of Malaga, probably represents the ancient Iluro, not the ancient Lauro. Incidentally, he shows that Lauro cannot have beell in the province of Malaga, and that the ancient Munda was not on the site of the present Monda. Sculptures from Cerro de los Santos. - In the Revue des ttudes An- ciennes (Bulletin Hispanique), 1901, pp. 147-168 (8 pls.; 18 figs.), Pierre Paris gives a catalogue (eighty numbers) of sculptures from Cerro de los Santos not in the National Archaeological Museum at Madrid. The sculp-</page><page sequence="29">AFRICA] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1901 481 tures are, with the exception of a few small bronzes, very fragmentary. They are in various collections at Yecla, Albacete, Alicante, Madrid, Bonete, and in the Louvre. FRANCE Ancient Sculpture in the Department of Charente.-In R. Arch. XXXVIII, 1901, pp. 272-284 (14 figs.), G. Chauvet describes the ancietit statues, statuettes, and figurines in the department of Charente. Few are of artistic value. The materials used are bronze, marble, various stones, and terra-cotta. Most of the objects are of the Gallo-Roman times, some are earlier, and some are rude work, hard to date. Roman Oculists' Seals. -In C. R. Acad. Insc. 1901, pp. 140-152, the Abbe Thiedenat publishes two inscribed oculists' seals found near the village of Gran in 1898 and a bronze ring from Naix (Meuse) with the inscription merinto tle amo. The seals are similar to those previously kiown. The inscription of the ring was impressed by meanls of separate letters in relief. The First Coin of the Colony of Lyons. - In C. R. A cad. Insc. 1901, pp. 82-100 (cut), Henri de la Tour discusses a bronze coin found at Gergo- via, and now at Vienne. On the obverse is a female head with a mural crown. Inscription COPIA FELIX. On the reverse Hercules and a bull. Inscription MVNATIA. The first name of the Romiai coloniy at Lyons was Copia Felix Munatia. L. Munatius Plancus founded the colony in the summer of 43 B.C. When Antony obtained control of Gaul he gave the place its old name of Lugudunumn, and his influence was so great that the town was spoken of as colonia Marci. Augustus returned to the name Copia, which was afterward supplanted by the old name in the form Lugdunum. Inscriptions from Germany in the Correspondence of Oberlin. - In R. Arch. XXXVIII, 1901, pp. 59-71, Seymour de Ricci publishes from the Oberlin manuscripts in the Bibliothbque Nationale forty Latin inscriptions from Germany. Some of these copies were made before the copies used in the publications of inscriptions, some are copied from stones now lost. Several are here published with drawings of the stones. on which they are cut. Only a few are entirely new, many being contained in Brambach's Corpus Inscriptionum Rhenanarum. GREAT BRITAIN The Excavations at Silchester in 1899.--In Archaeologia, LVII, i, 1900, pp. 87-112 (3 pls.; 10 figs.), is an account of the excavations at Sil- chester in 1899 by W. H. St. John Hope, with notes on the objects found by George E. Fox. A plan of insula xxii and a plan of the ancient town, showing all discoveries up to November, 1899, are among the plates. For a summlary account, see Am. J. Arch. 1900, p. 507. In the same issue of Ar- chaeologia, pp. 113-124 (4 figs.), W. Gowland describes the remains of a ,silver refinery found at Silchester, and discusses the method practised. AFRICA Some Ancient Sculptures in Algeria. -In R. Arch. XXXVIIIT, 1901, pp. 72-81 (7 figs.), Stephane Gsell publishes, with brief notes, seven sculp- tures at Cherchel. (1) A statue of a youth, lacking head, both arms, both feet, and the right leg. It is compared with the figure by Stephanus and the</page><page sequence="30">482 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. V, 1901 "Pylades " of the group in the Louvre. Inedited. (2) The seated statue Muse'e de Cherchel, pl. xiii, pp. 135-137, is interpreted as Asclepius. (3) The Pan and Silenus Muse'e de Cherchel, pl. xi, figs. 1 and 2, are published as a group. Pan and Silenus are wrestling. (4) A Telamon in the form of a Silenus, lacking the head and arms, is published. The work is poor. (5) A portrait head of Juba II in the possession of Mr. Boucher, at Cherchel (purchased and offered to the Louvre by the Association historique de l'Afrique du Nord) is published. Juba appears about forty-five years old. (6) A head published in the B. Arch. C. 7'. 1895, p. 56, is identified as Livia, the mother of Tiberius, at about forty years of age. (7) A bust of a chthonic deity of poor workmanship of the third century after Christ, found at Philippeville, is published. It recalls the " Eubouleus " from Eleusis. Attention is called to the chthonic deity published Muse'e d'Alger, p. 38. A Punic Inscription from Carthage. - In Biblia, XIII, 1901, pp. 385 f. (pl.), E. J. Pilcher publishes an inscription found by P. Gauckler at Carthage. The inscription is earlier than the capture of Carthage by the Romans. It reads: "Malkipeles son of Bodmelqarth, son of Malkipeles, son of [-son of] Malkipeles, son of Melqarthpeles of the place of the gods, son of [- son of] Malkikhorem. A pillar of stone [I have erected to the honor of the gods] and my bones [are laid with] the holy ones. [I have preserved] the lives of the holy ones, serving [faithfully. May the] Sun-god [bless] the son of my steps and son of my strengths. My lord [shall inscribe his name in the] books of the register .. " The Colony of Uthina. - Discussing an inscription recently found in the Roman Forum (see Not. Scavi, 1900, p. 569 ff.), Lorenzina Cesano gives a detailed account of what is known of the colony of Uthina in Africa. (Rend. Acc. Lincei, 1900, pp. 681-688.) The foundation of the colony is assigned to Julius Caesar. CHRISTIAN ART GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS Relics from Constantinople. - In the R. Art Chret. 1900, pp. 491-507, F. de M~ly completes his treatise on the Sacred Thorn. This will form Volume III of his forthcoming work, Exuviae sacrae Constantinopolitanae. Statuette of the Good Shepherd. - At the Institut de Correspondance Hellenique, January 25, 1899, Laurent gave an account of a statuette of the Good Shepherd now in the Museum of Tchinili-Kiosk at Constantinople. The type is well known, but this copy is valuable as preserving much of the left arm, which is missing in the other examples. In this case the hand seems to have rested on the hip, a restoration impossible for some of the other statuettes. It confirms the popularity of the type, which is essentially the same throughout the entire Roman Empire during the first Christian centuries. (B.C.H. XXIII, 1899, pp. 583-587; 1 cut.) A Sketch of the History of Sculpture.- In Progress (Chicago), VI, No. 4, January, 1901, pp. 276-296 (13 illustrations), William Ordway Part- ridge publishes a brief sketch of Mediaeval, Renaissance, and Modern Sculpture. Essay on Architectonic Decoration. -In the R. Art Chre't. 1900, pp. 481-490, 1901, pp. 25-36, 212-234, L. Cloquet begins an ' Essai sur la deco- ration architectonique.' This bids fair to be a veritable treatise of which</page><page sequence="31">CHRISTIAN ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1901 483 three chapters only are as yet published. The illustrations already number over two hundred. The Illustrated Physiologus in Smyrna. - In the Byz. Archiv, II, p. 2, Strzygowski had written an article entitled ' Der Bilderkreis des griechischen Physiologus,' in which he noticed various irregularities difficult to explain. He has now discovered that the manuscript in Smyrna was bound in a way to disturb the original pagination and the applicability of the illustrations. To reestablish the original pagination and to reconsider some of the minia- tures is the object of an article which he has published in the Byz. Z. 1901, pp. 218-222. French Furniture at the Paris Exposition.- In the Gaz. B.-A. 1901, pp. 123-135, Emile Molinier, without specific attention to the objects ex- hibited at the exposition, presents a succinct and interesting r6sume of the history of French furniture up to the end of the eighteenth century. French Furniture in the Louvre.- In 1881 the French Government established a Museum of French Furniture in the Garde-Meuble; in 1901 this collection was transferred to the Louvre. Here it receives recognition as a section of French art. A general notion of this collection is given by 1mile Molinier in the Gaz. B.-A. 1901, pp. 441-460. Early Playing Cards. - In Archaeologia, LVII, i, 1900, pp. 185-200 (3 p1s.), Robert Steele has ' A Notice of the Ludus Triumphorum and some Early Italian Card Games; with some Remarks on the Origin of the Game of Cards.' Two Italian cards of about 1440 and four cards of the fifteenth century in the Bibliothbque Nationale are published. BYZANTINE AND MEDIAEVAL ART Byzantine Seals. -In R. At. Gr. 1900, pp. 467-492, Gustave Schlum- berger describes 158 inedited Byzantine seals, twenty-two of which are published in cuts. GREECE Byzantine Architecture in Greece. - R. W. Schultz and H. S. Barns- ley, former members of the British School at Athens, have made an impor- tant contribution to our knowledge of Byzantine Architecture in Greece by their publication, The Monastery of Saint Luke of Stiris in Phocis and the Dependent Monastery of Saint Nicolas in the Fields near Skripou, in Boeotia (London, Macmillan &amp; Co., 1901, 4to, XII, 76 pp.; 48 figs.; 60 pls.). Not- withstanding the fact that the same monastery will shortly be published by M. Diehl for the 3Monuments de l'Art byzantin, this volume is welcome for the clearness of its descriptive text and for the abundance of the illustrations. For the historical portion of their work, the authors of this volume have had the assistance of the three volumes published in Greek by G. P. Kremos, Athens, 1874-80, and in the consideration of the mosaics they have had before them the valuable publications of M. Diehl. The merit of their volume consists chiefly in the section dealing with the architecture. The various ground plans, sections, elevations, details of ornament, etc., set before us very clearly the architecture of this once famous monastery of St. Luke of Stiris. Built at the end of the tenth century, this monastery shows strongly in its architecture the influence of Hagia Sophia of Constantinople, while its decoration does not yet betray the stereotyped forms of the Mt. Athos</page><page sequence="32">484 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. V, 1901 manual. It is much to be regretted that neither in England nor in America is there any permanent endowment for the furtherance of researches in this important sphere of Architectural Archaeology. ITALY The Crown of Iron at Monza. --In the R. Art Chre't. 1901, pp. 12-24, Mgr. X. Barbier de Montault completes his study entitled ' La Couronine de fer, au tresor de Monza (Loinbardie),' adding a very thorough bibliography. The So-called Dalmatica of Charlemagne.- In the Second Congress of Christian Archaeology, held in Rome in April, 1900, M. Battaudier spoke of the Dalmatica in the treasury of S. Peter's, Rome, as dating from the end of the eleventh century. Tradition placed it still earlier, as having been worn by Charlemagne. In the R. Art Chre't. 1901, pp. 52-54, Jos. Brann as- signs his reasons for believing that it was made during the fifteenth century. Pontifical Golden Roses. - Under the title ' Les Roses d'or pontificales ' in the R. Art Chret. 1901, pp. 1-11, Eugene Miintz presents the first instal- ment of his researches in the Vatican archives, concerning the origin and history of the papal ceremony of the Presentation of the Golden Rose. Hitherto only ten recipients of the Golden Rose have been known for the fourteenth century. Miintz enlarges the list to forty. PRANCE A Sculptured Head at Dijon. - Under the title 'T Tte Sculpt&amp;e ' Notre- Dame de Dijon (XIII Siecle),' in the R. Art Chret. 1900, pp. 472-480, Henri Chabeuf discusses a striking portrait head which still survives in the north transept of Notre Dame de Dijon. The sculptures of this church repre- sented the flower of Burgundian sculpture of the thirteenth century. The figured sculptures were almost entirely destroyed at the time of the French Revolution. This vigorous head is, therefore, an important survival. Mural Paintings of Forez.-In R. Arch. XXXVIII, 1901, pp. 10-16 (2 pls.), Joseph DIchelette discusses mural paintings in Forez, giving an analysis of the book Les peintures murales du moyen adge et de la Renaissance en Forez, published by the Socidte' de la Diana, under the direction of Joseph Dichelette and E. Brassart, with the collaboration of Charles Beau- verie, Abbd Reure, and Gabriel Trivoux (Montbrison, 1900, E. Brassart, 68 pp.; 20 pls. 29 figs. folio). Paintings in the priory of Charlieu, the church of Saint-Romain-le-Puy, Sainte-Croix-enJarez, Saint-Bonnet-le-Chateau, and the castle of Valprivas are especially mentioned. The last is a Renaissance work of the last years of the sixteenth century, the others belong to the Roman- esque period, and are important for the study of French art at that time. Laon Cathedral. - In the R. Art Chre't. 1901, pp. 36-50, E. Lambin gives a general account of the Cathedral of Laon. The merit of this article lies chiefly in the careful study made of the sculptured flora of the capitals. The Church of Saint-Leu-d'Esserent. - The church of Saint-Leu- d'Esserent, noted by Ernest Renan in the Revt. d. Deux Mlondes, July, 1862, as a remarkable example of architectural unity, is the subject of an article by E. Lambin in the Gaz. B.-A. 1901, pp. 305-317. The details of the architecture, as well as the flora of the capitals, are carefully described. Episcopal Chapel at Meaux. - Amongst the many organizations for the study of local history and archaeology in France may be mentioned</page><page sequence="33">MEDIAEVAL ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1901 485 that at Meaux. From the local Bulletin are taken the plans and details of the twelfth century Episcopal chapel, published by Canon Jouy and repro- duced ill the R. Art Chre't. 1900, pp. 540-543. BELGIUM The Church at Messines. - The church at Messines is described and illustrated by B. Bethune in R. Art Chret. 1901, pp. 193-211. Founded by Adele of France about 1060, the church retains parts of the original eleventh century structure. Other parts date from the thirteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries. This church is one of very few in Flanders, the central tower of which is crowned with a cupola. GERMANY The Treasure of the Abbey of Reichenau. - In R. A rch. XXXVIII, 1901, pp. 177-197 (4 pls.; 7 figs.), Jean J. Marquet de Vasselot writes of the treasure of the Abbey of Reichenau in Lake Constance. An ivory pyxis, not earlier than the eighth century, the reliquary of St. Mark, a fine example of French work of the fourteenth century in gilded silver, and the reliquary of Sts. John and Paul, also French work of the first half of the fourteenth century, are especially discussed. Other interesting works are a stamped book cover of silver with repouss6 medallions of gilded silver, of the fifteenth century, the reliquary of St. Fortunata, German work of the fifteenth century, the reliquary of Sts. Felix and Regula, also of the fifteenth century, a bronze cast of a Romanesque bronze vessel for holy water, a plaque of green glass, a reliquary in the form of a bust, and several crosses and other objects of mediaeval date. Objects of the seventeenth and eigh- teenth centuries are also numerous. The Treasures of the Church of S. Matthias at Trier. -In the R. Art Chre't. 1901, pp. 179-192, X. Barbier de Montault describes under eleven titles the treasures of the church of St. Matthias at Trier. The oldest of these treasures is the girdle of St. Oswald (seventh century); the most im- portant is the thirteenth century reliquary of the Holy Cross. GREAT BRITAIN An Ivory Book-cover in the South Kensington Museum.-Under the title ' Die Madonna zwischen Zacharias und Johannes,' H. Graeven dis- cusses in the Byz. Z. 1901, pp. 1-22, an ivory book-cover in the South Ken- sington Museum. (Cf. Maskell, Ancient and M ediaeval Ivories in the South Kensington Museum, p. 53, No. 138, 66.) He concludes that it was executed under the Abbot Salmann (972-998) at Lorsch, was copied from a Byzan- tine ivory of the sixth century, and that an ivory book-cover in the Vatican (Garrucci, V, Tav. 457) adorned the opposite cover of an Evangelium cata- logued in the eleventh century as in the library at Lorsch. A Byzantine Silver Treasure. - In A rchaeoloqia, LVII, i, 1900, pp. 159-174 (3 pls.; 17 figs.), Ormonde M. Dalton describes a Byzantine silver treasure from the district of Kerynia, in Crete, now in the British Museum. There are three larger objects and a number of spoons. Originally the spoons numbered about thirty-six, but eleven or twelve of these are now missing. The larger objects are a flat dish, or paten, a basin, and a hex- agonal vessel for suspension, perhaps a lamp, or censer. The basin has a</page><page sequence="34">486 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. V, 1901 double border round the rim and a medallion in the centre; round the medallion is a border in niello; in the medallion is the bust of a saint, probably St. Sergius. On the under side of the flat dish, or paten, are four stamps, with monograms, busts, and designs, probably to identify the owner or donor. The dish has a moulded rim of fine workmanship, and in the centre a niello cross. The censer is adorned with six busts in two groups; the bust of Christ is between those of Sts. Peter and Paul, that of the Virgin between those of (probably) Sts. James and John the Evan- gelist. On the bottom are four stamps. The spoons have engraved palm leaves on the back of the bowls; eight have no further ornament; one has the inscription OCOAWPOY; four have the inscription AY + AA; the re- maining eleven have running animals in relief in the inside of the bowl. Comparison with other works of industrial art make it probable that the greater part, at least, of this treasure should be ascribed to the second half of the sixth, or beginning of the seventh, century. A Pre-Norman Cross at Nunburnholme, Yorkshire. -In Reliq. 1901, pp. 98-106 (4 figs.), J. Romilly Allen publishes a cross-shaft at Nunburn- holme. The shaft, broken and incomplete, is adorned on its four sides with figures and patterns in relief, of a decidedly Scandinavian character. The only obviously scriptural subject is the ' Virgin and Child.' A centaur is of course derived from classical prototypes, but is not unusual on Scandinavian monuments. As a possible date of this cross-shaft, the time about 627, when Coifi destroyed the idols at Goodmanham, is suggested. Lacock Abbey, Wiltshire.--In Archaeologia, LVII, i, 1900, pp. 125- 158 (5 pls.; 4 figs.), Harold Brakspear gives a brief sketch of the history of Lacock Abbey from its foundation in 1232, followed by a careful descrip- tion of the remaining parts and examination of the evidence regarding the parts destroyed. In 1540 the abbey was converted into a manor-house, and at that time some parts of it were destroyed, but the rest is admirably pre- served. The cloister and chapter-house are especially fine. Of the church only so much remains as was needed to form a wall of the manor-house. Some Interesting Essex Brasses. - In Reliq. 1901, pp. 73-88 (12 figs.), Miller Christy and W. W. Porteous publish and discuss brasses in Essex. The earliest published dates from about 1320, the latest from 1639. An Illuminated Manuscript of the Fifteenth Century. - In A rchae- ologia, LVII, i, 1900, pp. 29-70 (5 pls.), Harold Arthur, Viscount Dillon, discusses a manuscript collection of ordinances of chivalry of the fifteenth century belonging to Lord Hastings. The subject-matter of the manuscript is interesting, and its illuminations are remarkably fine. Those published represent English shipping in the fifteenth century, jousting at the tilt, a mounted combat between John Astley and Pierre de Masse, 1438, a fight with axes between John Astley and Philip Boyle, January, 1441-42, arming a man for a fight on foot, and the arms and crest of Sir John Astley, K.G. RENAISSANCE ART ITALY The Ducal Palace at Venice.- In the Am. Architect, 1901, pp. 21-23, C. Buckingham writes on the 'Traceries of the Great Painted Win- dows of the Ducal Palace,' at Venice. Only four windows still retain</page><page sequence="35">RENAISSANCE ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1901 487 their original tracery, the rest having been destroyed in the fire of 1577. The article emphasizes the original polychromatic character of the Ducal Palace. Beato Angelico and Benozzo Gozzoli.--In L' Arte, 1901, pp. 1-29, A. Venturi writes concerning Beato Angelico and Benozzo Gozzoli. After giving their distinguishing characteristics, he reaches some striking conclu- sions concerning the co6peration of Benozzo with Angelico in the Cappella Nuova at Orvieto, and also in the frescoes of the Chapel of Nicholas V in the Vatican. The hand of Benozzo as well as that of Angelico must hence- forth be looked for in these frescoes. Francesco Bianchi-Ferrari.- In the Gaz. B.-A. 1901, pp. 376-384, Herbert F. Cook discusses the Madonna with Sts. Benedict and Quentin, now in the Galerie des Septs M1Ttres of the Louvre. Il 1725 the painting was in the church of St. Quentin, Parma, and was then attributed to Fran- cia. It was afterwards attributed to Lanfranco and to Badalocchio. When it reached Paris it was ascribed, in 1814, to Francesco Bianchi-Ferrari. The basis for this attribution is now unknown. Mr. Cook justifies this attribu- tion and assigns other paintings to this artist. Roberto Oderisi and the Incoronata Frescoes. --In the Rep. f. K. 1900, p. 345, Paul Schubring attributes the celebrated Incoronata frescoes in Naples, with some hesitation, to Paolo di Maestro Neri. In the same per~- odical, pp. 448-450, B. Berenson ascribes the frescoes to Roberto Oderisi, an attribution which Dr. Schubring is (p. 450) unwilling to admit. The So-called Portrait of Maddalena Doni. - The portrait by Raphael in the Pitti, known as that of Maddalena Doni, cannot be a portrait of that lady, since the records of births in Florence show that she was born in Feb- ruary, 1489, and the burial records that she was "about fifty " years of age in December, 1540. During Raphael's Florentine period (1505-1508) Mad- dalena Doni was from sixteen to nineteen years old, whereas the lady in the portrait is some ten years older. (R. DAVIDSOHN in Rep. f K. 1901, pp. 451-452.) Raphael Tapestries.- Under the title 'Les Actes des Ap6tres, Tapis- series d'aprbs Raphael,' in the R. Art Chre't. 1900, pp. 91-123, Gerspach gives an excellent account of the tapestries made for the Sixtine Chapel after cartoons by Raphael. He concludes that from a decorative as well as technical point of view these tapestries have been overestimated; that better tapestries were made at the same period. Tintoretto. - In the volume on Tintoretto in the Kiinstlermonographien published by Velhagen und Klasing, Henry Thode gave a general outline of the life and works of Tintoretto. In a series of articles in the Rep..f. K., of which two are already published (1900, pp. 427-442, 1901, pp. 7-35), he enters more into detail. The chronological material which Thode has gathered and the list of paintings which he is publishing should greatly facilitate the comprehension of the most productive of Venetian masters. FRANCE Sculpture at Troyes. - In 1900, R. Koechlin and Jean J. Marquet de Vasselot published a volume entitled La Sculpture ' Troyes et dans la cham- pagne meridionale au X Ve siecle (Paris, Colin), making a thorough use of documentary and monumental evidence. In an appreciative review in the</page><page sequence="36">488 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. V, 1901 Gaz. B.-A. 1901, pp. 260-264, Paul Vitry characterizes this book as an important contribution to the study of French sculpture and an excellent example of the proper method of study in the history of art. NETHERLANDS Hubert van Eyck.--In the Gaz. B.-A. 1901, pp. 474-482, W. H. James Weale writes on Hubert Van Eyck. By a consideration of the cos- tumes, architecture, botany, and other details represented in the pictures he assigns to Hubert the following paintings usually attributed to Jan Van Eyck: (1) The St. Francis in the Metropolitan Museum, New York, and the replica or copy in the museum of Turin. (2) The three Maries at the Sep- ulchre, Cook collection, Richmond. (3) Calvary, Berlin Museum. (4) The Madonna and Saints, Gustave de Rothschild Collection, Paris, and the replica of this painting in the Berlin Museum. (5) The Donor protected by St. Anthony, Museum of Copenhagen. Jan Van Eyck in France. - It is customary to assume that the artistic activity of Jan Van Eyck lay between 1432, the date of the altarpiece of the Mystic Lamb, and 1440, the date of his death. In the Gaz. B.-A. for 1901, pp. 215-229, Karl Voll argues against the probability of this assumption and points out as early works of Jan the Annunciation at St. Petersburg, the Madonna of Chancellor Rolin in the Louvre, the Madonna with the Carthu- sian monk in the possession of Baron Gustave Rothschild in Paris, and the Burleigh house Madonna in Berlin. A Painting wrongly attributed to Roger van der Weyden. - In the museum of The Hague is a fine Deposition from the Cross attributed on the authority of Dr. Waagen to Roger van der Weyden. A. J. Wauters, how- ever, assigns it to Memnling. Kaemmerer rejects both attributions and assigns it to an unknown master whose style resembled that of Memling and also that of Roger van der Weyden. W. H. James Weale agrees with Kaem- merer. (R. Art Chret. 1900, pp. 124-125.) Josse of Ghent and the Ideal Portraits from Urbino. -It is known from Vespasiano da Bioticci (I, p. 295) that Duke Federigo of Urbino em- ployed a Flemish painter, skilled in oil painting, who executed for him a series of ideal portraits of philosophers, poets, doctors of the church, etc. Baldi, the biographer of the Duke, gives us the name of this painter as Josse van Ghent. In the Rep. f. K. 1901, pp. 54-59, Karl Voll enumerates 28 such portraits painted in 1476, some of which are now in Rome and others in Paris. Joachim Patenier. - In the R. Art Chret. 1900, pp. 463-471, Jules Helbig writes a general notice of the work of Patenier. The article is an extract from a forthcoming book entitled Les peintres des Bords de la Meuse. Patenier was the pupil and associate of Gerard David and was praised by Albert Diirer as an excellent landscape painter. GERMANY Diirer's Adam and Eve of 1504. - In the Rep. f. K. 1901, pp. 453-454, Hans Brenner calls attention to the painting of Adam and Eve by Palma Vecchio, formerly ascribed to Giorgione, now in the gallery at Braunschweig. It is not easy to determine, however, whether Diirer was influenced directly or indirectly by Palma Vecchio, or whether Palma was influenced by Diirer's</page><page sequence="37">RENAISSANCE ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1901 489 engraving, or whether both derived the same composition from a common source. Adam Elzheimer.- The position of Adam Elzheimer, a precursor of Rembrandt as a painter-engraver, has long been known, although the list of etchings ascribed to him by Nagler, Monogrammistes, I, 236, does not con- tain a signed example. In the Gaz. B.-A. 1901, pp. 401-412, S. Sheikd- vitch publishes an etching from his own collection which is signed A. Elzheimer f. A modified copy of this by Jan Van de Velde, entitled 'Ignis,' is in the Bibliothbque Nationale. The engraving known as a 'Sorceress,' by Jan Van de Velde, appears also to be a copy of a similar composition by Elzheimer. Peter Vischer. - In the Rep. f. K. 1901, pp. 36-53, Ludwig Justi gives the results of a critical study of Peter Vischer's works. After establishing a chronological series of his works, Justi considers the question as to how far Vischer was aided by his sons and by other artists and how much is to be attributed to Italian influence. An Old German Painting at Milan. --In the Museo Poldo-Pezzoli is an important German painting until recently attributed to Quentin Matsys. It consists of five panels in a Gothic frame. The central panel represents the' Annunciation,' the other panels contain pictures of saints in pairs. In L'Arte, 1900, pp. 30-34, Emil Jacobsen attributes this altarpiece to the painter from Cologne, who painted the ' Glorification of the Virgin,' now in the Walraf-Richartz Museum at Cologne. To the same master is attributed an ' Adoration' in the Berlin Gallery. GREAT BRITAIN A Triangular Lodge at Rushton. --In the Am. Architect, 1901, pp. 67- 68, L. Viajero, under the title' An Architectural Curio,' describes a strange triangular building erected at Rushton in 1595 by Sir Thomas Tresham. The building in its plan, elevation, and decorative details emphasizes the number three. It is supposed that Sir Thomas erected the building to com- memorate his mental struggles on the subject of the Trinity.</page></plain_text>
