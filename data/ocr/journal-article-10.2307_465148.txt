I believe that, after considerable struggle and often great reluctance, feminist theory has finally reached the stage at which it not only is able to defend itself from outside incursions and external criticism-from positions committed to antifeminism, phallocentrism, patriarchalism-but is prepared to speak out against some of its own commitments, some of the stages and positions that were perhaps historically necessary for its current forms but to which it now no longer adheres and in which it is still implicated. As part of its coming-to-maturity, feminism (as a political movement with theoretical aspirations and commitments) must be prepared, as it were, to air its dirty laundry, to make public as well as private criticisms of feminists, to be seen as a terrain over which feminists or feminisms disagree. This may well prove confusing, unsettling, and disappointing to outsiders (who may like to believe in generally agreed- upon base issues and platforms, who may be shocked that feminists can disagree with each other at least as strongly as they may disagree with phallocentric or male positions), but it is something that most feminists themselves have probably long recognized and that many have evaluated as one of the positive strengths of feminist politics, its diversity, its commitment to multiplicities and specificities, its nonunified functioning. Derridean deconstruction has posed a series of the most difficult challenges to the self-conception of feminist theories, challenges-not simply critiques or objections- that have raised questions about the status of subversion, the position of subordination, and the possibilities of transgression that feminists now need to address if feminism is to remain a viable and effective political force into the twenty-first century. The general suspicion that many feminists have of that work now most easily categorized as postmodern,1 the wariness of projects to "decenter subjectivities," sexualities, agencies, A longer version of this paper will be published in Feminist Interpretations of Derrida, ed. Nancy Holland [Austin: U of Texas P]. 1. This general label ofpostmodernism has always seemed to me to be a shorthandformula of dismissalfor the various-and highly disparate-positions thus categorized. It is not at all clear that writers like Lacan, Derrida, Deleuze, Foucault, and Lyotard, not to mention Kristeva and Irigaray, share a common denominator that could be calledpostmodern. This label designates the giving up of certain features that characterize the project of modernity, including the opposition between structuralism and humanism, but beyond this shared negative concern, the names thus lumped together seem to me to share little in common. The label ofpostmodernism has helped serve as a justification for treating thesefigures together withoutpaying any particular attention to their diacritics 25.2: 115-24 115 diacritics / summer 1995</page><page sequence="3">political platforms, and revolutionary goals, has caused many feminists to cling stead- fastly to humanist and enlightenment values or to naturalist and essentialist commitments that may ultimately harm more readily than help various feminist projects. My goal here is to provide something of a feminist revaluation of some of the writings of Jacques Derrida, a revaluation that will function as a mode of criticism of both those feminists who have resolutely attacked deconstruction (often in the name of postmodernism) without any familiarity with his writings2 and those feminists who have actively struggled with his texts only to reject them as outside of or hostile to feminist concerns. My purpose here, though, is not to criticize other feminists (although I no longer want to shy away from this necessity when it occurs); it is to demonstrate that feminist demands for a clear-cut position, for answers, for unequivocal boundaries and divisions, for certainties in political judgment can afford to learn much from deconstruction. I do not want to suggest that Derrida's works are feminist in themselves; nor do I want to make the contrary claim that his writings are antifeminist in any straightforward sense. His position defies ready-made categories and clear-cut characterizations. It is perhaps this apparent slipperiness, this refusal to state or stay within a singular definitive position, more than anything else, that may explain the suspicion his work seems to generate among feminists and political activists of various kinds. Although his work cannot be assigned a definitive position on one side or the other of a divide separating feminist from antifeminist positions-indeed it problematizes this very dividing line-and although his work is not easily assimilable into a kind of feminist appropriation, nonetheless I believe that deconstruction provides a series of challenges and insights that may serve to make feminist theory more self-critical, more aware of necessary conceptual and political investments and the cost of these investments, and thus make it more effective and more incisive in its struggles than it may have been before or beyond deconstruction. Moreover, deconstruction provides a way of rethinking common conceptions of politics and struggle, power and resistance by insisting that no system, method, or discourse can be as all-encompassing, singular, and monolithic as it represents itself. It is inherently open to its own undoing, its own deconstruction (deconstruction is not imposed from outside a discourse or tradition but emerges from its own inner dynamics). Resistance, too, cannot be conceived as simply outside or beyond dominant regimes but is conditioned and made possible by them. They do not have a relation of exteriority, for each is the other's internal condition of effectivity. It is for this reason that, rather than being construed as critique or destruction, Derrida insists over and over that deconstruction must be understood as a mode of affirmation, indeed as a mode of double affirmation. In a feminist context this means that discourses influenced by or in some way involved in deconstruction are committed to both an affirmation, a saying-yes to patriarchy (the gesture of phallocentrism), and an affirmation of feminism, the overcoming of patriarchy. The first affirmation is perhaps the one many feminists hope is unnecessary, that they can simply and resound- ingly say no to patriarchy. Without both moments in this affirmative investment, however, specific contributions, to their major differences and inconsistencies, to the various debates and disagreements that have marked their complex and often uneasy relations. And perhaps more alarmingly, postmodernism has functioned as a marketing label to designate what is new, difficult, and hip, to mark the contemporaneity of the various academic or intellectual "products" or "commodities" thus being marketed-a book, a conference, a seminar, a program. 2. The best that can be said of such a position is that it is intellectually dishonest even if politically well intentioned. To criticize any position on the basis of hearsay, rumor, or gossip is to abrogate one's intellectual responsibility to ensure that the criticism is justified, that it hits its mark, that it is "fair." Such a position is exactly analogous of the attitude of the popular or commercial press in the face of the present complexity of feminist theory and politics. At best, a caricature can be drawn, but any broad understanding is precluded. 116</page><page sequence="4">feminism remains in danger of repeating and being unable to recognize the very implications it believes it has repudiated. Derrida does not question the mistakes, errors, or false assumptions of feminist theory: he is not really interested in how to correct or improve any particular theory (indeed such a notion presupposes that deconstruction somehow knows what a theory means to say and can say it better, more rigorously or more accurately, than the theory it corrects). Rather, his work raises difficult, possibly irresolvable questions regarding the internal and essential implications of feminist theory and practice in an often-unrecog- nized complicity with the very forces feminists have commonly identified as outside of, other to, and different from feminism itself-patriarchy, phallocentrism, racism-forces from which feminists believe they have separated themselves in order to see feminism as beyond or outside their laws of operation. Here Derrida is not addressing an error that, by ingenuity or careful rethinking, could somehow be rectified but a constitutive binding, of feminism or any oppositional mode of political struggle, to the law it undertakes to subvert. He poses the necessary implication of feminism in phallogocentrism, of antiracism in racism, of philosophical texts (most particularly Nietzsche's, Heidegger's, and de Man's, no less than his own) in Nazism and fascism, of the "revolution" in what it revolts against-possibly the most unsettling and disquieting charge that can be leveled at any political position that strives to ameliorate or transcend given situations and power relations. This is not the claim that feminism is doomed from the start, that it cannot hope to accomplish its aim, but rather that feminism can hope to succeed only insofar as it is implicated in and part of-admittedly a recalcitrant part of-patriarchy itself. Not only does Derrida suggest that there can be no definitive break with the past; he poses the inherent or necessary investment of the proponents of the canon and of tradition in their own undermining and undoing, the constitutive "openness" of every theoretical and textual position to its own outstripping. It is not as if one has the luxury of either remaining faithful to a given, settled, finalized, and "objective" history which passively accepts its textual reconstitution in truth (as conservatives and traditionalists assume); nor that we have any control over the kind of future that will necessarily rewrite our present in the historical terms and frames we ourselves choose (as the revolutionary, feminist or otherwise, hopes for). This question of complicity is probably the most forceful and disturbing challenge-I cannot call it a critique, because there can be no correction, no truth, no supersession of this complicity-that can be posed for any discourse or practice that regards itself as oppositional: the claim that one's struggles are inherently impure, inherently bound up with what one struggles against, that even as one struggles against a system or position, its force and power are actively reaffirmed. This assertion of complicity, while certainly not the claim of a conscious collusion, is nonetheless the refusal of a space beyond or outside, the refusal of the fantasy of a position safe or insulated from what it criticizes and disdains. If feminism does not occupy a space outside of patriarchy and phallocentrism, if it is implicated in the interstices of patriarchal function- ing, then the security of its identity, the definitiveness of its borders as other than and outside of patriarchy, its very self-representations as a bounded position are problematized. I do not see this as an antifeminist gesture but as a measure of the maturity of feminism to accept its internal limits and to use them in enabling and productive ways. The Ontology of Sexual Difference The question of the ontological status of sexual difference is probably one of the most central issues facing feminist theory today: at its center lie a whole series of issues that seem to occupy the major concerns of feminism in the 1990s. It provides probably the broadest way of raising the more "regional" questions of the status of the "given" in diacritics / summer 1995 117</page><page sequence="5">feminist thought, whether this is conceived in terms of the status of the female body, the origins of patriarchy, or the power of phallocentric discourses. To take the body as a particular example, in recent work3 I have asked the question that seems central for any corporeal feminism: what is the ontological status of the sexed body? Is the sexed body (a body presumably given by biology) the raw material of modes of social inscription and production? Or do modes of social inscription produce the body as sexually specific? Which comes "first"-sexed bodies or the social markers of sexual difference? Similarly, if feminists take patriarchy as a given term in feminist analysis, the question can always be asked-what is the origin of patriarchy? Is it men's natural strength, aggression, and competitiveness that produced a system of patriarchal domination over women; or rather, did a system of patriarchal domination produce men's strength, etc. as the relevant explanatory factor in the devaluation of women's attributes? How could such questions be resolved? How could one decide what a suitable answer to these questions might be? It is these constitutive types of feminist questions that Derrida's analysis of the ontology of sexual difference may help to resolve or at least understand. In what follows, I will present a highly selective reading of some of Derrida's key texts on the ontology of sexual difference. His purpose in "Geschlecht: Sexual Difference, Ontological Difference" (1983), among others, is to raise the question "How do you think by those words [sexual difference] or through them?" [66]. How is one to recognize what it means to speak of sexual difference, especially if sexual difference is not reducible to the sexual identities of male and female? What is its referent if it is difference and not an identity that is articulated? If Heidegger does not speak of sexual difference as such, it may nonetheless pervade his text, in spite of his attempts to keep it contained and beyond the scope of Dasein, despite his ambition to render Dasein neutral, clean, unbounded with the complications of sexual and anthropological specificity. Basically Heidegger seems committed to two positions that sit uneasily together and whose tension will provoke a reexploration and reinterpretation of both. On the one hand, Heidegger insists thatDasein is a neutral term, a term that must be stripped of its humanist, egoist, anthropomorphic associations and characteristics in order to be understood in terms of fundamental ontology, in terms prior to any concrete specification, at the origin of any particularity. Dasein is thus construed as outside of or beyond the reach of sexual difference, preceding it. It is being minus its sexual, cultural, historical, ethical, and political determinations, a pure relation, involving nothing but Dasein's relation to itself: "This neutrality also indicates that Dasein is neither of the two sexes" [Heidegger 136]. Yet on the other hand, Heidegger also acknowledges forDasein an inherent openness to sexual specificity and the centrality of sexual difference to Dasein in its very neutrality. Heidegger affirms that Dasein is the well or source of all concreteness, the "intrinsic possibility of every factual humanity" [137]. Dasein in its neutrality, free of any predetermination, is nonetheless implicated in the dispersion or dissemination that comes later to constitute the specificity, determinacy, and sexual coding of any being. Sexual difference cannot spring from nothing; it is not an artificial imposition from outside. Dasein contains within itself the very possibility of its dispersion into multiplicity, the very condition of the attribution or acquisition of any qualities or properties, including sexual specification. Dasein is both what neutralizes all determination, including that implied by sexual difference, and what provides the precondition and possibility of the sexual determination of things, humans. Derrida suggests that Dasein is not simply neuter, without trace of sexual markings, but rather that 3. This is one of the central concerns I attempt to address in Volatile Bodies: Toward a Corporeal Feminism (1994). 118</page><page sequence="6">it neutralizes any prior sexual marking, that of the oppositional or binarized model of sexuality. Derrida is very careful to distinguish (as he or we may not in fact be capable of doing as clearly as he suggests) between sexual opposition and sexual difference, between a binary structuring of the relations between the sexes and a nonbinarized differantial understanding, in which no single model can dictate or provide the terms for the representation, whether negative or positive, of all sexes. His reading stresses that Heidegger (and presumably Derrida himself) actively distances himself from the model of sexual binarity, through the neutralizing activity of Dasein: IfDasein as such belongs to neither of the two sexes, that doesn't mean that its being is deprived ofsex. On the contrary, here one must think ofapredifferential, rather a predual, sexuality-which doesn't necessarily mean unitary, homoge- neous or undifferentiated. Then, from that sexuality, more originary than the dyad, one may try to think to the bottom a "positivity " and a "power. " [Derrida, "Geschlecht" 71-72] In short, Derrida wants to claim that there is a sexuality more primordial than the binarized opposition between the sexes, a sexual difference that is neutral with respect to the sexes as they are currently represented, a "raw material" that, through dispersion and splitting, is rendered concrete and specific. This primordial sexuality is Dasein, an order before sexual determination that is in itself sexual. This same sort of reading appears in his second text on Levinas, "At This Very Moment in This Work Here I Am" (1991). Here he again interrogates the relations between a foundational concept-no longer Dasein but the Levinasian absolute Other as articulated in Totality and Infinity-and the question of sexual difference. The same sorts of questions remain appropriate in this new context: is the absolute Other beyond or before sexual determination? Or is sexual determination part of the very establishment of the concept of the Other (the Other as feminine)? Are sexual difference and femininity (and even the collapsing of sexual difference into femininity, as if only the feminine side of the opposition can represent difference) primary or secondary? As with his analysis of Heidegger, Derrida's goal is not to criticize or punish the Levinasian double-take on the question of sexual difference, but to show its unacknowledged reliance on precisely that which his model must refuse, deny, or cover over. While on the one hand, unlike virtually an entire history of Western philosophy, Levinas seems prepared to write as masculine, as a man-an "I-he," as Derrida describes it-to sign (with) his masculine signature, to own up to the position of authority and articulation usually unmarked as male but occupiable only by men; on the other hand, he participates in a certain effacement of the question of sexual difference, a certain investment in the phallocentric covering of women under the generic human. Derrida recognizes in the well-known gesture of neutralization or humanization the ruses of a masculine domination that leaves itself unmarked as such. The emptying out of particular determinations is a prerogative of the masculine position. Derrida raises what seems to me one of the central questions of feminist theory: "How can one mark as masculine the very thing said to be anterior, or even foreign, to sexual difference?" [40]. Elsewhere he reformulates this question as a question of the relation of primacy between sexual difference and difference: "Must one think 'difference' 'before' sexual difference or taking off 'from' it? Has this question, if not a meaning (we are at the origin of meaning here, and the origin cannot 'have meaning') at least something of a chance of opening up anything at all, however im-pertinent it may appear?" [Derrida and McDonald 172]. For Levinas, man is prior to and generic-before the division of the man-human from the woman-human-not of woman but rather of sexual difference, which woman now diacritics / summer 1995 119</page><page sequence="7">comes to represent. Humanity in general, before its division into the two sexes, is sexually neutral, that is, masculine. With the later advent of sexual difference comes woman. Like Heidegger's gesture of removing all traces of sexual difference from Dasein only to restore a (different) notion of sexual difference, Levinas removes all traces of sexual specificity from his ontology while at the same time seeking to retain an ontological base that is the ground or prior condition of sexuality. If the wholly Other is beyond all determination, then the wholly Other cannot be identified with the other sex, with femininity. The indifference of the relation with the Other, the relation that, for Levinas, precedes ontology and founds the domain of ethics, is prior to and the precondition of sexual difference. Now, on the one hand, this gesture of the neutralization of the domain of the other is perhaps a necessary condition for the very existence of an ethics. Can there be an ethics between men and women that does not rely upon or presume a common or neutral ground, a ground that the sexes (or races) share? Does it even make sense to talk of an ethics for women and an ethics for men as two different projects, if one of the implications of an ethics is that it regulates relations between the different sexes? (This kind of ethics is indeed the kind Irigaray seeks: she is not looking for a women's ethic, a feminist ethic, a set of principles or prescriptions governing women's behavior, because such an ethics leaves women's relations to men, and men's relations to each other and to women, completely untouched: instead she is seeking an ethics of sexual difference, an ethics that is cognizant of the specificity and autonomy of each sex.) On the other hand, the attribution of the masculine pronoun to mark the wholly Other, to mark the domain of the ethical, is clearly an attempt to master and control not simply the terms by which sexual difference is thought but the very conceptions of the feminine and of woman, which now have to take their place under the label of the "he." The problem here is not simply that Levinas encloses the feminine in a masculine/ universal model, which cannot but privilege the masculine at the expense of the feminine, but also that this entails that even the masculine subject has effaced the wholly other status of the Other, the fundamental openness to alterity that he also attributes to the masculine. In defining the Other in the terms of the masculine, Levinas in effect reduces this otherness, converting it into a version of the same, thus obliterating the very possibility, in his terms, of an ethics.4 A different version of his analysis of the relations between sexual binarity and sexual difference has marked Derrida's much observed and contested interviews on the question of femininity, feminism, and sexual difference. Instead of affirming women's specificity through some reference to some kind of independent authenticity (as some have been tempted to do) or positing women's subversive powers and capacities in some inarticulable beyond of language (as psychoanalysis tends to do), Derrida refers both to the historical tenacity of the binary dividing the sexes, which prioritizes the masculine at the expense 4. See Simon Critchley's analysis of this text: One might say that sexual difference is Levinas's "blind-spot." But what economy governs this blind-spot? ... [T]wo enclosures can be detected in Levinas's work: 1) By making sexual difference secondary and by seeking to master the un-said alterity of the feminine, the "il" of the wholly other would risk enclosing itself within the economy of the same. 2) By seeking the enclosed sexual difference within ethical difference, the feminine is enclosed within the economy of the same. ... Levinas's work encloses the trace of illeity within the economy of the same and encloses the feminine within a crypt.... Levinas's work can only go unto the wholly other on the condition that feminine alterity is circumscribed and inhumed. The strange consequence of the latter is that Levinas's work is itself engaged in a denial of (feminine) alterity and thus remains enclosed within the economy of the same which it has constantly striven to exceed. ["'Bois'" 183] 120</page><page sequence="8">of the feminine (the implication being that it is not so easy to dislodge the privileged masculine term in order to put the feminine in its place), and to the logical openness of our capacity to understand sexual difference in terms other than the binary type of model. Derrida interrogates the very conditions under which women have been attributed a secondary social status on the basis of biological, natural, or essential qualities; he is suggesting a fundamental indeterminacy of sexuality before the imposition of sexual difference (and presumably he must also be committed to the claim that this indetermi- nacy is not quite captured by the sexual identities of males and females, that it exerts a kind of resistance to its reduction to binarization). And in doing so, he is not simply speaking as a woman or appropriating women's right to speak. Unlike the vast majority of other male philosophers, particularly those labeled postmodern,5 Derrida takes feminist issues seriously; he doesn't dismiss them as minor or regional problems reducible to or subsumable by the resolution of other problems. But neither does he (nor could he) provide solutions for these issues insofar as feminism is not resolvable through the acquisition of certain specific rights and values, or through the enactment of a program or specific path. Indeed, with and through his reading of Nietzsche in Spurs (1979), he remains generally critical of an egalitarian feminism in which women seek formal and legal equality with men. Such a feminism, as he rightly suggests, aspires to make women like men; it is inherently reactive. He is quite explicit about differentiating this kind of reactive feminism, which aspires no further than the emulation of men's accomplishments and positions, from other, more active and positive forms: Can one not say, in Nietzsche's language, that there is a 'reactive 'feminism and that a certain historical necessity often puts this form of feminism in power in today's organized struggles ?It is this kind of "reactive "feminism thatNietzsche mocks, and not woman or women. Perhaps one should not so much combat it head on-other interests would be at stake in such a move-as prevent its occupying the entire terrain. [Derrida and McDonald 168] This is not, however, to suggest that Derrida's work should be accepted wholesale as feminist or as readily compatible with feminism. Two factors make this a difficult assertion: first, it seems to me that Derrida has a good deal to offer feminist theory that is not generally there in feminist works (except those that have been strongly influenced by him). His work mounts a productive challenge to many of the underlying assumptions, values, and methods in much feminist writing, and insofar as he provides insights into what might be called the "politics of representation," his work is both other than and useful for feminist theory. Second, perhaps more problematically, there remain residual feminist problems with Derrida's work, which mitigate against too easy an identification with and acceptance of his position. I have in mind here a certain strategic ambiguity in Derrida's use of the notion of an indeterminate or undecidable sexuality, a sexuality before the imposition of dual sex roles, a sexual that is somehow ontological but entirely without qualities and attributes. I believe that Derrida is hovering between two uses of the notion of sexuality, sometimes using one to evade the implications of the other. It is clear that sexuality, in the sense of "pleasurable drive," could quite valuably be understood as a mode of prior indeterminacy that gains its specific form and qualities a posteriori, and largely as an effect of binary polarization. It is not so easy to see how sexuality, in the sense of sexed subjectivity, male 5. I believe that an exception to this generalization is probably Lyotard, who has also addressed the question of sexual difference and the struggles of women in what I believe is a sensitive and productive way. See Lyotard. diacritics / summer 1995 121</page><page sequence="9">and female, can be understood as indeterminate.6 By this I do not want to suggest that a ready division can be made between these two conceptions, for they are clearly bound up with each other-how one lives one's sexuality in the first sense depends on how one is sexed in the second sense. This is what I presume the framework of sexual difference implies: that there is an irreducible specificity of each sex relative to the other, that there must be (at least, but not necessarily only) two sexes. In short, one lives one's sexual indeterminacy, one's possibilities for being sexed otherwise differently depending on whether one is male or female. This is not to predetermine how one "is" male or female, but simply to suggest that there is an ineradicable rift between the two, in whatever forms they are lived.7 Unless such a presumption is made, sexual difference remains in danger of collapsing into a sexual neutrality of precisely the kind Derrida problematizes in Heidegger and Levinas: I would like to believe in the multiplicity of sexually marked voices. I would like to believe in the masses, this indeterminate number of blended voices, this mobile of non-identified sexual marks whose choreography can carry, divide, multiply the body of each "individual, " whether he be classified as "man " or as "woman" according to the criteria of usage. [Derrida and McDonald 184] Derrida's dream of a multiplicity of "sexually marked voices" seems to me worthy of careful consideration, as long as the question of the limits of possibility of each (sexed) body is recognized. Each sex has the capacity to (and frequently does) play with, become a number of different sexualities but not to take on the body and sex of the other. Deconstructive Politics Derrida does not offer any political solutions for either feminism or any other politics. This has tended to evoke suspicion. If he does not offer any solutions, if his goal is to demonstrate the complex and paradoxical nature of any political commitment-or for that matter any conceptual commitment-then it is commonly and naively assumed that his work is nonpolitical, apolitical, or, worst of all, allied with the forces of conservatism or even fascism. What is usually not recognized is that his work has the effect of rethinking entirely the ways in which politics and theory have been considered. This does not amount to the creation of a new political theory or epistemology, but the reordering-or perhaps the disordering-of the ways in which politics and theory have been understood. Politics can no longer be understood in terms of clear-cut heroes and villains, the politically correct position and its incorrect alternatives, which has dominated so much of feminist and leftist politics. Instead, things are now murkier: saying no to a political or conceptual structure can no longer remain unequivocally, unilaterally opposed to any (conservative) 6. Here I do not want to simply suggest that there are not individuals of indeterminate sex- so-called "intersexed " individuals-who are ambiguously neither clearly male norfemale but have characteristics of both. But such individuals can be understood as indeterminate only in the sense that they do not conform to the binary division of the sexes into two clear-cut categories. Such individuals remain concrete, determinate, specific in their morphologies. 7. This rift need not, indeed should not, be understood simply in anatomical or biological terms, for these themselves are in constant social transformation, as Derrida acknowledges: ... "hymen" and "invagination," at least in the context into which these words have been swept, no longer simply designate figures for the feminine body. They no longer do so, that is, assuming that one knows for certain what a feminine or masculine body is, and assuming that anatomy is in this instance the final recourse. [Derrida andMcDonald 181] 122</page><page sequence="10">yes. It is implicated in a yes, it is implicitly also a yes. One cannot say no to the law, to requirement, to history, to power without being committed at the same time to affirmation of precisely that which one wishes to deny. Derrida is concerned to complicate politics, to make it no longer simply readable as the setting out of a clear-cut, unambiguous, solid set of guarantees. This necessarily disturbs those who seek to be reassured of the rightness of their positions, who seek to be sure that, in all contexts and in all situations, they have a position that remains on the "right" side. Indeed, I suspect that this was precisely the appeal of a vulgar Marxism or feminism that claimed to provide a position, a perspective, from which to judge other political positions and claims without accepting the right in turn to be judged by them, to submit to their perspectives.This amounts, fundamentally and in effect, to a wish to end politics, to stop contestation, to have an answer which admits of no complications and ramifications.8 To know, to be right. Such a will to silence others, to prevent contestation, to adjudicate once and for all and with definitive status the rightness, the appropriateness, the truthfulness, or justice of any position is not a will that cannot be readily repudiated. In claiming a position, one must remain committed to its ability to explain, enact, produce, and outperform its alternatives, that is, in a certain sense, to its "rightness," its "truth," its value over and above others. This is what it is to have a position. Yet at the same time, this will to overpower, to master, to control must undermine itself, must remain bound up with the very disturbances unsettling to, uncontainable by it-its others.The no is always committed to a (prior and stronger) yes. Derrida's complication of the political thus involves the acknowledgment not only of the complexities and ambiguities of any position (this formulation still implies the possibility of resolving or at least clarifying these complexities) but of the aporias, the irresolvably contradictory tensions within each claim, the impossibility of assigning a singular assessment and a definitive and settled value. This may explain why those who have pretensions to any political certainty or of having answers for political issues seem so hostile to what deconstruction may offer in rethinking the political. They see Derrida's work as an alternative that competes with their own positions without having anything commensurable to offer by way of political solutions. All he offers are complications, modes of unsettling. We return, finally, to the question of the ontological status of sexual difference.To presume either the one or the other side of this question-that is, the claim that ontology is sexually neutral and thus precedes sexual difference and the claim that sexual difference is ontological-necessarily involves the implication of the one in the other. If ontology is claimed to be sexually neutral, then it has to be shown how, out of such a neutrality, it is nevertheless able to generate sexual difference, how, in short, there must always already be a trace of sexual difference even within the postulation of an indifference. And equally, if sexual difference is an-if not the-ontological bedrock, nonetheless, it must also be clear that sexual difference takes the forms in which we recognize it today only through a later inscription or production (a binary ordering) which both contains and retranscribes it. Sexual difference as ontological difference remains committed to a fundamental 8. See also Geoffrey Bennington's similar justification of what might be understood as Derrida's politics: That there is political concern among Derrida's readers does not worry us, on the contrary: but it could easily be shown that this "worry" claims in fact to resolve politics in such a way that one should no longer have to worry about it, so that nothing should happen in it, so there should be no more politics.... It is precisely where one protests most against a supposed lack of political reflection that such reflection is most sorely lacking. [Bennington and Derrida 197] diacritics / summer 1995 123</page><page sequence="11">indeterminacy, such that it must explain its own ontological openness, its own incom- pleteness and its possibilities of being completed by a (later) reordering. The question remains inherently undecidable, which is not to say that it is unintelligible. One cannot opt for one side of an opposition without at the same time (whether wittingly or not) remaining implicated in and complicit with its opposite. This does not mean one must accept both sides as equal in value, or that one must abandon the opposition altogether and produce a middle or compromise path between them. None of the binary oppositions structuring logocentric and phallocentric thought can be simply avoided, and no compromise between them is possible. One must accept the tangible and singular irresolvability of oppositions in their concrete contexts, and in contexts to come. I believe that this remains one of the great strengths rather than a weakening of feminist theory: not its closure of certain positions with which it disagrees, but its openness to its own retranscriptions and rewritings.
