This agent is designed with a hybrid persona that  simulates a mentor and plays both motivation and companion roles. Based on the theoretical grounding in  motivation and change agency and related research, we propose that a computer-based change agent will impact  pre-service teachers’ attitudes toward technology integration and improve their abilities to be effective users of  educational technology. The impact on learning and instruction is explained as a process of changing  perceptions and concerns about the value of using technology to support their learning. We build on models of  innovation-decision processes and attributes of adoption of innovation and concern-based adoption. Practical  considerations for the design of a virtual change agent are provided with respect to appearance, voice and  emotional expression. Further research is also discussed, especially regard to empirical validation of specific  components of the framework and longitudinal studies of teacher attitudes.

As a result, there is an increasing demand on teachers to develop the skills to make effective use of  technology (Ertmer, Conklin, Lewandowski, Osika, Selo, &amp; Wignall, 2003). Much technology has been placed in  schools such as computers, educational software, etc., and much training for teachers’ skills and knowledge of  teaching with technology has been provided. Despite these efforts, many teachers still do not integrate technology  effectively even when they have the technology and initial training (Beavers, 2001; Hope, 1998). This situation is  attributed to a variety of factors, including lack of proper teacher education (Ward, West, &amp; Isaak, 2002).  Researchers have suggested that teacher education with regard to technology integration should go well beyond  teaching technical skills. Specifically, training and education should take into account teacher motivation regarding  the use of technology (Llorens, Salanova, &amp; Grau, 2002).    Pre-service teacher education provides fundamental experience for the use of technology (Thompson, Schmidt, &amp;  Davis, 2003). Our focus is on issues involving pre-service teacher motivation (Doering, Hughes, &amp; Huffman, 2003).  Time and curriculum constraints in pre-service teacher training courses often limit an instructor's ability to provide  support beyond introduction to and limited use of specific technologies. Methods to supplement the instructor's  supportive role are needed. Methods of support such as mentoring and networking among teachers have been studied  (Ward et al., 2002; Weidmann &amp; Humphrey, 2002). However, these human-mediated supports are not always  accessible or convenient. Therefore, pedagogical agents – animated human-like computer interface characters  designed to facilitate learning – may be a potential solution in cases where human resources are not available  (Baylor, 2001). The use of such agents to provide additional support for technology integration in pre-service teacher  education is the specific focus of this paper.    Pedagogical agents respond to the learner in a social manner through human-like interactions (Kim &amp; Baylor,  2006b). The human-like characteristics of pedagogical agents are advantageous for enhancing more positive and  vivid interactions with pre-service teachers. In addition, pedagogical agents may also be perceived as empathetic,  credible and trustworthy, positioning them to serve as effective agents of change. When pedagogical agents are  perceived as empathetic, credible and trustworthy, they have been demonstrated to be effective in influencing  attitudes (Baylor &amp; Plant, 2005; Ryu &amp; Baylor, 2005).    In situations where the adoption of an educational innovation is a desired outcome, the concept of a change agent  is  relevant  (Fullan &amp; Stiegelbauer, 1991; Rogers, 1995). A change agent is generally an individual who facilitates the  ISSN 1436-4522 (online) and 1176-3647 (print). © International Forum of Educational Technology &amp; Society (IFETS).

The concept of a change agent has been highlighted  in the context of educational technology innovations (Ellsworth, 2000; Huberman &amp; Miles, 1984). However, most of  the research has focused on the effects of a human as a change agent and has not considered the problem of  insufficient human resources.     “Situational dependency” (Silverman et al., 2001, p.227) suggests that pedagogical agents are helpful when there is a  need to increase companionship and decrease complexity. A pedagogical agent, then, would be valuable as a change  agent in the context of educational technology integration given that it can provide virtual human companionship and  can help decrease the perceived complexity of technology integration.    A variety of roles and functions of pedagogical agents have been studied. Four major roles for pedagogical agents  have been identified: (a) an expert who provides information, (b) a mentor who advises, (c) a motivator who  encourages, and (d) a companion who collaborates (Baylor &amp; Group, 2003; Baylor &amp; Kim, 2005; Kim &amp; Baylor,  2006a, 2006b). Many studies investigating pedagogical agents have focused on their impact on learning outcomes.  Even in studies where positive effects on motivation were observed, motivational changes were considered  secondary to learning outcomes and were not often studied independently (Ryu &amp; Baylor, 2005). Recently  motivational outcomes have been receiving more attention, and studies have shown that pedagogical interface agents  can be effective in promoting motivation and attitude change (Baylor &amp; Plant, 2005; Moreno et al., 2002; Moreno,  Mayer, Spires, &amp; Lester, 2001; Silverman et al., 2001). However, few studies focus specifically on motivation. In  addition, despite the fact that pedagogical agents can be designed with specific characteristics beneficial for learners,  there have been few attempts to study pedagogical agents that incorporate multiple roles or functions (Baylor &amp;  Ebbers, 2003). Instead, studies have tended to focus on agents with single and separate roles.     Given the limitations of prior research and the need for facilitating teacher motivation, this paper proposes a Virtual  Change Agent (VCA) to improve pre-service teachers’ attitudes towards technology integration. A VCA constitutes  a blend of agent roles, including mentor, motivator and companion. For a VCA the expert-like characteristics are less  relevant because pre-service teachers already have an instructor who plays the role of an expert. In discussing VCAs  to motivate pre-service teachers to integrate technology, we address the following questions: (a) How could a  pedagogical agent effectively play the role as a change agent? (b) What characteristics of a pedagogical agent would  enable this role? (c) What theories, models and empirical research support the use of a VCA? and, (d) What design  aspects should be considered to optimize the characteristics of a VCA? To investigate these questions, we examine  established models of innovation adoption together with empirical studies on pedagogical interface agents. Our  purpose is to elaborate a framework for a VCA to motivate pre-service teachers to effectively integrate technology  into their classrooms.      A Virtual Change Agent (VCA)    A VCA should incorporate the roles of mentor, motivator and companion. As a mentor, a VCA should guide and  coach learners as well motivate students and stimulate reflection as in Multiple Intelligent Mentors Instructing  Collaboratively (MIMIC; see Baylor, 2002; Baylor &amp; Kim, 2005). As a motivator, a VCA encourages learners to  perform a task and sustain at the task (Baylor &amp; Kim, 2005). As a companion, a VCA accompanies learners in an  empathic relationship throughout their learning processes (Kim &amp; Baylor, 2006a). These companion characteristics  are consistent with the characteristics of a motivator agent developed in MIMIC where the agent serves as a coping  model and models solving a difficult learning task to enable an empathic relationship with the learners (Baylor &amp;  Kim, 2005).    These selected characteristics of a pedagogical agent as a mentor, motivator and companion enable the change agent  to function as indicated by Rogers (1995) to:  • Match the pre-service teacher’s need;  • Deal with the problem of information overload;  • Select the most relevant message for the individual;  • Establish relationships with pre-service teachers by being perceived as credible, competent, and trustworthy;  • View the situation empathically from their perspective;  • Seek to motivate their interests in technology integration;  310  </page> <page sequence="3"> • Stabilize new behavior through reinforcing messages; and  • Develop their ability to be their own change agents.    The characteristics of a VCA are operationally defined to include: a) a mentor to guide and coach pre-service  teachers in developing their ability to be their own change agents by responding to individual needs and situations; b)  a motivator to encourage them to integrate technology by relating technology integration to their situation and  interest and providing reinforcing messages; and c) a companion to collaborate by establishing and maintaining  credible, competent, and trustworthy relationships.    What justifies the inclusion of these three roles in a VCA? Pre-service teachers require a change agent who facilitates  their adoption of technology innovation – a change agent who can perform the functions indicated in the list above  can satisfy this requirement. Using technology for educational purposes is, surprisingly, an innovation for pre-service  teachers, and it requires integrating technology into curricula (Doering et al., 2003). Teachers see technology as an  important educational innovation. This attitude is quite different from the ways that teachers have been taught to use  technology for such purposes as email, Internet searches, document production, and so on.     Pre-service teachers already have an instructor from whom, as an expert, they can obtain knowledge about the  educational technology innovations; it is not necessary, therefore, to implement expert functionality in the VCA.  What is needed is a change agent who can influence their motivation, not just their technical skills and knowledge.  Further, an important feature of a change agent is homophily, which is the degree of similarity between a change  agent and the adopters (pre-service teachers in this case), as this impacts the adopters’ motivation (Rogers, 1995).  This suggests that the VCA should possess abilities and attributes similar to those of the pre-service teachers. This  concept is of importance with respect to designing the physical appearance of the agent.    Well-known models of the diffusion of innovation are examined next, including the innovation-decision process  model, the attributes of adoption of innovation model, and the concern-based adoption model. These models provide  a conceptual basis to support the use of a VCA to motivate pre-service teachers to integrate technology.       Conceptual Frameworks for a Virtual Change Agent (VCA)    Motivation for Change    The use of educational technology is typically an innovation for pre-service teachers since it is different from their  personal use of technology and requires them to adopt technology for teaching and instructional planning. What then  makes pre-service teachers want to change their behaviors and attitudes regarding technology integration? This can  be explained by three concepts: (a) the extent to which teachers are persuaded of the value of integrating technology,  (b) how teachers perceive technology integration, and (c) what concerns teachers have about educational  technologies.      Persuasion    Pre-service teachers need to be persuaded of the value of integrating technology into teaching and learning activities  (Brush, Glazewski, Rutowski, &amp; Berg, 2003; Christensen, 2002; Doering et al., 2003; Nelms, 2004; Weidmann &amp;  Humphrey, 2002). To become persuaded of the value of educational technology, existing beliefs often need to be  changed, which is possible through a conversion process (Ertmer, 2005; Hall, George, &amp; Rutherford, 1986). That  process is explained by Rogers (1995) who points out that an individual’s decision about an innovation is a process  occurring over time and consisting of a series of actions and decisions. He proposes the innovation-decision process  model that reflects the nature of sequential stages with five stages: knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation  and confirmation.    When applied to technology integration, the knowledge stage occurs when pre-service teachers obtain knowledge  about the existence of a technology and how it works. At the persuasion stage, knowledge shapes pre-service teacher  attitudes about technology integration. The decision stage involves activities that influence adoption or rejection of  311  </page> <page sequence="4"> the technology. The implementation stage involves the actual integration of technology into teaching. The  confirmation stage involves a decision to continue or stop using a particular technology.    In order for an innovation-decision process to proceed, pre-service teachers should obtain both awareness- knowledge, which refers to acknowledging the existence of technology integration, and how-to-knowledge, which  refers to understanding how to appropriately use technology for educational purposes (Rogers, 1995). However,  studies suggest that it is more difficult to acquire the latter than the former (Christensen, 2002; Mills &amp; Tincher,  2003). According to Rogers (1995), how-to-knowledge does not necessarily occur only at the knowledge stage;  activities at the persuasion stage can help teachers obtain initial knowledge about a particular technology and its  value in learning and instruction. Support in the persuasion stage can facilitate acquisition of how-to-knowledge.  Further, such support can encourage positive attitudes toward technology integration and carry through to the  implementation and confirmation stages (Rogers, 1995).        Perception     According to Rogers (1995), how people perceive the attributes of an innovation is important in forming a favorable  or unfavorable attitude toward that innovation. Rogers (1995) identifies five relevant attributes: relative advantage,  compatibility, complexity, trialability and observability. In case of technology integration, the notion of relative  advantage is the degree to which pre-service teachers perceive technology integration as being better than what they  are currently doing. It depends on “the degree of economic profitability, low initial cost, a decrease in discomfort,  social prestige, a savings in time and effort, and the immediacy of the reward” (Rogers, 1995, p. 216). Technology  integration as discussed in this paper is less dependent on economic factors since the infrastructure already exists.  Rather, our focus is on the notion that technology integration primarily requires time and effort on the part of  teachers. Compatibility is the degree to which users perceive technology integration as being consistent with their  values, experiences and needs. Complexity is the degree to which users perceive technology integration as being  difficult to understand and implement. Trialability is refers to the degree to which users can experiment with  integrating technology. Observability is the degree to which the outcomes of technology integration are visible to  users.       Concerns    The use of technology for teaching requires the development not only of knowledge, skills, and behaviors but also of  appropriate attitudes (Llorens et al., 2002). Attitudes might be influenced by concerns, confidence, and so forth. For  example, pre-service teachers’ attitudes toward a technology are affected by their confidence in using it (Rovai &amp;  Childress, 2002). Even though technology is available, and teachers have the requisite skills and knowledge, if they  are not confident in using technology for teaching, they might be unwilling to do so.     The Concerns-Based Adoption Model (CBAM) is often used to assess pre-service teachers’ attitudes toward and to  guide support for their adoption of technology (Bradshaw, 1997; Hope, 1998; Mills &amp; Tincher, 2003; Ward et al.,  2002). This is especially true with Stages of Concern, which is one of the diagnostic tools developed in the model  and used for probing potential adopters’ attitudes toward an innovation as well as their progress (Hall et al., 1986).  The Stages of Concern tool can assign pre-service teachers to these stages: awareness, informational, personal,  management, consequence, collaboration and refocusing.     At the awareness stage, pre-service teachers are aware of the existence of a technology but they have little concern  about it. At the informational stage, teachers want to know about it. At the personal stage, teachers are uncertain  about the demands of technology integration and their ability and roles. At the management stage, teachers are  concerned about technical challenges related to technology integration. At the consequence stage, they start inquiring  about how technology integration affects students. At the collaboration stage, they consider how to work with their  peers in the process of technology integration. At the refocusing stage, they start searching for ways to improve their  technology integration.     We discuss next the implications for a VCA based on view of motivation and change agency.    312  </page> <page sequence="5"> Implications for a Virtual Change Agent (VCA)    How are pre-service teachers likely to become persuaded of the value of technology integration, develop their  perceptions of technology integration, and become less concerned about or threatened by technology? What  experiences are necessary for these changes? If a change agent can facilitate positive changes and supplement  insufficient human resources, is a VCA capable of providing the experiences needed for the changes? These  questions can be explored through three strategies based on the diffusion of innovation models explained in the  previous section. These strategies are illustrated through a VCA’s characteristics as a mentor, a motivator and a  companion, as summarized in Table 1. Empirical research associated with these strategies are worthwhile pursuits, as  indicated in the conclusion.    Table 1.

A VCA with hybrid characteristics of a mentor, a  motivator and a companion can serve to facilitate pre-service teachers' acquisition of how-to-knowledge and their  formation of favorable attitudes toward technology integration. First, pre-service teachers need to go through a  vicarious trial in order to mentally apply the innovation of technology integration to their situations (Rogers, 1995).  This activity requires them to interpret the information that they receive and hypothetically project the interpretation  onto their own situations. A VCA can guide the process by coaching them (as a mentor) to select a technology and  envision using it, while providing them with essential advice. For example, the agent might ask: “How would you  use this technology in your teaching? How would you have your students use it? Think about one example and then  write down your ideas.” Such a message is intended to reflect how a human mentor or tutor might respond to a  student in that situation. The challenge is creating such automated agent responses is in recognizing the problem  from the student’s perspective and then providing an appropriate level of support. This paper does not address the  diagnostic aspects of a VCA; rather, our focus is on the identification of appropriate messages once the situation has  been diagnosed.    Second, pre-service teachers need a cue-to-action that crystallizes favorable attitudes toward technology integration  (Rogers, 1995). Acknowledgment of the need for the innovation and its accessibility are not sufficient to adequately  314  </page> <page sequence="7"> motivate a teacher to integrate technology. A VCA can present a cue-to-action through the characteristics of a  motivator to provoke interest with relevant messages related to individual. For example, the agent can inspire pre- service teachers in English Education by suggesting that students could illustrate the synopses of their stories with a  concept map created using Inspiration as a way to integrate technology into teaching creative writing.    Lastly, pre-service teachers need social reinforcement of positive attitudes toward technology integration from their  peers (Rogers, 1995). This activity allows them to observe their peers’ positive evaluation on technology integration  as well as to confirm their personal beliefs in the innovation. This activity is important as individuals tend not to  adopt technology integration without interpersonal communication with satisfied peers (Tsai, 2001). A VCA can  provide social-reinforcement as a companion to positively evaluate the technology integration and express feelings  similar to those of other pre-service teacher peers.       Perception    A VCA can facilitate pre-service teachers’ in acquiring positive perceptions of the five attributes of technology  integration. For relative advantage, a VCA implements the characteristics of a motivator who encourages them to  believe that their current amount of time and effort in technology integration will decrease and that they will be  confident in its advantage. For compatibility, the characteristics of a motivator are also used for relating technology  integration to their current values and ideas. For instance, a VCA could arouse pre-service teachers’ attention by  mentioning their pedagogical belief and encouraging them that their belief holds true when incorporating technology  into their lesson planning.     Pre-service teachers can become overwhelmed and puzzled by technology integration because of its complexity. A  VCA can help them manage complexity through serving as a mentor to coach them through a simple case. Such an  agent might say: “What do you think about this? Just have students use Inspiration to sequentially list things to do for  their projects and logically set timelines.” To help users perceive the trialability of technology integration, a VCA  could  guide them by presenting the opportunities of hands-on activity that match their needs. For example, the VCA  might say: “Your major is Art Education. Take look at this Website. How might you use this site with your  students?”    For observability, it is necessary to show that their peers succeed in acquiring the positive effects of technology on  students’ learning. The characteristics of a companion can be used for a VCA to empathize with pre-service teachers’  feeling that they want to see others’ successes and to share his own success story.       Stages of concern    Research suggests that once proper supports are provided to pre-service teachers according to their particular level of  use and development, their motivation toward technology integration improves (Bradshaw, 1997; Hope, 1998; Mills  &amp; Tincher, 2003; Ward et al., 2002). Hall and his colleagues (1973) emphasize the role of a change agent to  understand potential adopters’ needs and to provide them with interventions to facilitate their moving toward a more  positive stage to adopt an innovation. However, they also caution that the movement should not be forced (Ellsworth,  2000). In this way, a VCA could be advantageous given that its non-humanness will likely be perceived as less  forceful, providing the pre-service teachers with more freedom for their own decisions to accept or reject the  information (Baylor, 2001).     A VCA can facilitate pre-service teachers’ moving toward more positive stages of concerns about technology  integration. For those who are at the awareness stage, it implements the characteristics of a motivator to draw their  arousal to technology integration and to provoke their interests in it. For those at the information stage, a VCA can  coach them in learning about technology integration by presenting a simple example. For those at the personal stage,  the characteristics of a mentor can guide them to the understanding that what technology integration requires is  beyond technical skills and knowledge. In addition, the characteristics of a motivator are used to encourage their  confidence in their ability and self-efficacy. For those at the management stage, a VCA utilizes the characteristics of  a motivator to encourage them to be concerned about the issues related to students’ learning with technology. For  those at the consequence stage, the characteristics of a mentor are used in order to guide them to the understanding of  315  </page> <page sequence="8"> how effective technology integration could be, by offering examples that show students’ development resulting from  technology integration. For those at the collaboration stage, the characteristics of a mentor are used for collaborating  in the process of integrating technology. For those at the refocusing stage, the characteristics of a mentor are used to  guide the ways in which they want to improve their technology integration.     So far, how a VCA can persuade pre-service teachers to have more positive attitudes toward technology integration  with better perception of technology integration while addressing their individual concerns about technology  integration was examined through three activities for persuasion, five attributes for perception, and seven stages of  concern. The use of the characteristics of a mentor, a motivator and a companion for each activity, attribute and stage  was proposed. How then, can those characteristics be embedded in a VCA? What should be considered in order for  each message to be effectively conveyed through the characteristics of a mentor, a motivator and a companion?  Based on the empirical studies on pedagogical agents, critical design considerations are examined in the next section.       Design Considerations for a Virtual Change Agent (VCA)    The role characteristics of mentor, a motivator and a companion that constitute a VCA are summarized according to  the diffusion of innovation models, as listed in Table 2. Next, a set of design considerations will be derived from  empirical studies on pedagogical agents to suggest ways to design appropriate characteristics for the VCA, including  its appearance, voice and emotional expression. Figure 1 illustrates how these design considerations are integrated  into a design framework for virtual change agents.    Table 2. Summary of VCA characteristics within the context of diffusion of innovation models  Characteristics of a Diffusion of Innovation Models  Virtual Change Innovation-decision Attributes of adoption of Concern-based adoption model:  Agent process model: innovation model Stage of concern  Persuasion stage  Mentor Vicarious trial Complexity Information stage  Trialability Personal stage   Consequence stage  Refocusing stage  Motivator Cue-to action Relative advantage Awareness stage  Compatibility Personal stage   Management stage  Companion Social reinforcement Observability Collaboration stage      A Single Virtual Agent    The characteristics among a mentor, a motivator and a companion are embedded in a single virtual agent. This is  contrary to the suggestion of Baylor and Ebbers (2003) that two agents may be better than one agent. They found that  two agents, one as an expert and one as a motivator, had more positive effects on learning, especially recall, than one  agent acting as a mentor in which the expert and motivator functions were combined (Baylor &amp; Ebbers, 2003).  However, the purpose of using agents in their study was different from the purpose of the conceptual framework of  this paper in that the former was to facilitate learning and the latter was to motivate changes in persuasion,  perception and concerns. That is, the former is more related to cognitive aspects and the latter is more related to  affective and attitudinal aspects.     Their explanation that one mentor agent with the combined roles of an expert and a motivator might have increased  students’ cognitive load as compared to receiving the information separately as needed from two agents with  distinctly different personas and messages, is not necessarily applicable when affective and attitudinal aspects are the  outcomes of interest. Rather, if multiple agents of a mentor, a motivator and a companion are used, the agents would  have multiple channels to provide messages that would likely be perceived as overlapping; this would likely make  the pre-service teachers confused as to the purpose of each agent (particularly as the agents’ appearance and voice  would not facilitate classification of them in a distinct role), leaving them to feel overwhelmed or distracted.  316  </page> <page sequence="9"> Therefore, a single agent is considered a better choice in order for the characteristics of a mentor, a motivator and a  companion to be embedded for a change agent.       Figure 1. Conceptual framework for the design of a virtual change agent    How, then, can the multiple characteristics be embedded effectively in a single VCA? In order to answer this  question, the next sections will examine specific design considerations with regard to appearance, voice and  emotional expression.      Appearance     According to Bandura (1986), an individual tends to be persuaded by others with whom he identifies; that is, the  degree to which others are perceived as being similar to himself affects his changes. In fact, Baylor &amp; Plant (2005)  investigated how pedagogical agents influenced the change of female undergraduates’ attitudes and beliefs about  engineering, and they found that the appearance of pedagogical agents was a critical aspect in impacting female  undergraduates’ perception of a social model for engineering. Although female students perceived male agents as  more knowledgeable since those agents looked more like engineers to them, the agent that they perceived as most  similar to themselves was the most effective in impacting their self-efficacy, stereotypes and attitudes toward  engineering (Baylor, Rosenberg-Kima, &amp; Plant, 2006).      Along this line, a young female agent would likely serve most effectively as a VCA. Pre-service teachers tend to  perceive teaching as a female occupation since the majority of them are in fact female; therefore, they would be  likely be most persuaded by a young female agent with whom they would identify. However, a slightly older  appearance is suggested for a VCA given the need for it to mentor the pre-service teachers as a slightly advanced  317  </page> <page sequence="10"> companion. In addition, other research has shown that for a pedagogical agent to effectively impact motivational  outcomes it is best when the agent is slightly older (Kim, Baylor, &amp; Reed, 2003).      Voice and Emotional expression    How, then, can the characteristics of a mentor, a motivator and a companion be included in a young and slightly  older female agent? One answer might be to adapt the agent’s voice and emotional expression. In fact, many  researchers have suggested that careful design of both verbal and visual communication is necessary to carry out a  particular role or functionality within a pedagogical agent (Baylor, Ryu, &amp; Shen, 2003b; Lester, Towns, &amp;  FitzGerald, 1999).    Considering that pedagogical agents’ voices impact communication (Atkinson, 2002; Atkinson, Mayer, &amp; Merrill,  2005; Mayer, Sobko, &amp; Mautone, 2003; R. Moreno et al., 2001), it is justifiable that a VCA would appropriately  utilize her voice according to the characteristics of a mentor, a motivator or a companion as needed. As simulated in  prior research, a professional but approachable voice for the characteristic of a mentor, an enthusiastic, energetic and  supportive voice for the characteristic of a motivator (Baylor &amp; Kim, 2005), and a friendly and empathic voice for a  companion (Kim &amp; Baylor, 2006a) can be used for a VCA.    In addition, emotional expression through the VCA’s verbal and non-verbal communication needs to be considered.  Many researchers found that contextually appropriate “facial expressions, eye contact, gestures, and emotional  responses” improved interaction between students and pedagogical agents (Lester et al., 1999; Warren, Shen, Park,  Baylor, &amp; Perez, 2005, p.3). Thus, a VCA should have synchronized emotional expression with a human or human- like expressive voice.    To summarize, possible ways to design a VCA have been examined based on prior research on pedagogical agents in  terms of the use of a single agent and its appearance, voice and emotional expression. These design considerations  are proposed on the premise that the messages that a VCA convey are constructed according to pre-service teachers’  motivational needs for change in their persuasion, perception and concerns toward technology integration.       Conclusion    In order to account for the application of a VCA to motivate pre-service teachers to integrate technology for their  future classrooms, this paper illustrates how a VCA can persuade pre-service teachers to have positive attitudes  toward technology integration with better perception of technology integration while addressing their concerns.  Based on the innovation-decision process model, the attributes of adoption of innovation model, and the concern- based adoption model, this paper explains pre-service teachers’ changes toward technology integration through  implementing the characteristics of a mentor, a motivator and a companion VCA. For the effective embodiment of  those characteristics, design considerations grounded on prior research have been proposed in terms of the use of a  single virtual agent and its appearance, voice and emotional expression.    Future studies could and should examine the impact on attitudes of preservice teachers toward technology integration  based on the VCA framework presented here. It would also be interesting and probably revealing to examine the  effect of individual components of the framework in isolation from other components. For example, comparisons of  a VCA’s message construction based on one or two selected components that are theoretically neutral with regard to  change agency stages or motivation theory might verify the need to include all of those components to attain desired  effects. Development of various appearance, voice and emotive aspects of the agent, tailored to individual student  characteristics, are worth investigating as part of a research agenda aimed at the personalization of instruction.  Furthermore, even if one small scale experiment showed that preservice teachers’ positive attitudes toward  technology integration were improved through a VCA, longitudinal studies might be necessary to determine whether  or not their attitudes would be easily interfered with through subsequent experiences.    Although the rationale for the use of a VCA and suggestions for future research have been made, a few practical,  technological issues still remain: To what extent can interactions between pre-service teachers and a pedagogical  agent be dynamic? Is it feasible to satisfy individual motivational needs? It might be possible to use annotated  318  </page> <page sequence="11"> concept maps as a way to assess changes in preservice teachers’ perceptions and attitudes with regard to specific  technologies (see Spector &amp; Koszalka, 2004; Taricani &amp; Clariana, 2003).    In spite of these unresolved issues to be tested through empirical study, the framework presented here can serve to  provide future research directions and initial design guidelines for a VCA to motivate pre-service teachers to  integrate technology in their teaching and instruction.
