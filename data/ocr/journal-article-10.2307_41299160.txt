<plain_text><page sequence="1">Afterword: The Quest for Theoretical Competence in the Study of Religion Daniel H. Krymkowski During our panel at the 1996 Meeting of the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion (SSSR), Luther Martin and I remarked the difficulty of positing religion as a causal variable if one lacks a working definition of the concept. It is absurd to claim that x causes y when one has only a vague idea as to what constitutes x. However, it is difficult to develop a definition of a concept without a theory that explicates the concrete nature of the relationship between variables x and y. Why should we view x as a cause of y? What are the specific mechanisms via which changes in x come to produce changes in y? What empirically testable (and falsifiable) predictions are implied by the theory? Many sociologists who study religion do little more than include various operational definitions of religion (e.g., attendance at religious services) as independent variables in their models, without a well-argued and precise theory concerning why these particular aspects of religion can be expected to exert a causal influence upon a dependent variable. It is not surprising, then, that such ad hoc analyses have revealed generally weak empirical effects of religion on various dependent variables. Issues of definition and theoretical specification are what we Daniel H.

All these articles have their interesting features, but I do not believe that discussing conceptual definitions in the abstract is likely to provide a fruitful approach to the study of any phenomenon, including religion. Such discussions routinely end up going around in circles. It is fitting, then, for Jeppe Sinding Jensen in this volume to speak of "the perpetual story about the definition of religion." Sometimes these discussions lead to such nonsense as the claim that religion includes basically everything. The term "religion" refers to a large, "fuzzy set" of phenomena, and attempts to discuss or explain "it" as a whole are unlikely to be productive unless the aim is to account for the existence of religious institutions in a general sense (see Armin Geertz in this volume). Circular discussions are commonplace in immature scholarly fields. Instead of getting to work and trying to explain some phenomenon of interest, researchers expend considerable effort arguing about what should Ъе done. Since the "proof of the pudding is in the eating," it would be more profitable to simply work on concrete research questions. That way, the scholarly community can view and judge actual explanatory results of different approaches, as opposed Xopromises. This is essentially what Stewart Guthrie and Benson Saler maintain at the end of their articles in this volume. For instance, let us say that I am interested in why some Americans are more religious than others. That is, I intend to investigate individual religiosity as a dependent variable. Obviously, to proceed, a definition of religiosity is required. The fundamental work in this area was done by Glock and Stark,2 who placed individual religiosity in five categories: (1) the experiential; (2) the ideological; (3) the ritualistic; (4) the intellectual; (5) the consequential. The ideological aspect, for instance, includes religious beliefs. Exactly what constitutes a religious belief will depend on what the researcher wants to explain. An example, however, might be a belief in life after death. After specifying a working definition of religiosity, the next step is to consider factors that lead some individuals to be more 1 .

Guthrie's analyses of religion as a type of anthropomorphism might be helpful in this regard. Alternatively, one might want to understand why some religious organizations in the United States are increasing in size while others are decreasing. The researcher would need to decide exactly what qualifies as a religious organization in order to undertake such a study, and different researchers might come up with different definitions. Typologies of religious organizations offered in the past include the following: church, sect, cult, denomination. It maybe that the differences among these four types help to explain changes in membership vitality over time. If one is dealing with religion as an independent variable, an appropriate definition should be suggested by the theory that deals with the behavior of the dependent variable, as mentioned above. Say one is interested in explaining why some people enjoy more income than others. In order to include some aspects of religion among our independent variables in this situation, it is necessary to have a theory about the income attainment process that details exactly why and how religion uniquely influences income. My particular interest in religion comes from a social-scientific perspective. For me, science involves an interplay between theory and data that seeks to make general, law-like statements transcending time and space. A fundamental difference thus exists between the "human sciences" and the "humanities" (see Brian Smith in this volume): the latter tend to be much more interested in cultural and historical specificity. The data present in such studies might serve as grist for the theorist's mill, but such work itself is unlikely to be productive from a scientific point of view. Three general approaches to social-scientific research have been especially fruitful as of late, and their utility should be further explored in the study of religion. The first involves the use of the deductive, rational-choice perspective, which has yielded much of interest in the field of economics. Iannaccone identifies the basic assumptions of such an approach, both in general and as regards the study of religion, and he provides examples that illustrate just how extensive its yield is in terms of testable hypotheses.3 It has become quite fashionable to criticize the assumptions of this perspective, but such criticism often retards the development of theory: it is best to start with simple (though unrealistic) models and see what they yield 3.

All scientific explanation necessarily involves abstraction from what is a very intricate and complex reality. No two human beings are exactly the same physically, but medical science has nevertheless made great advances. For example, Iannaccone argues that religious organizations are susceptible to "free-rider" problems.4 Free riders are individuals who enjoy the benefits of something without incurring any of the costs. Residents in a neighborhood association, for instance, benefit from the work done by its governing board without actually dealing with the headaches that come before the board. What this means in the context of religion is that members of religious organizations can reap the benefits of membership (place to worship, counseling, etc.) without really contributing very extensively to the ongoing needs of the organization (money, time, etc.). This temptation not to contribute can readily lead to the decline of the organization, and membership problems experienced by old-line Protestant denominations may illustrate this. One way to deal with the free-rider problem is to impose strictures to discourage uncommitted people from joining. This implies that strict churches will be stronger than lax ones, a prediction confirmed by empirical analysis.5 Notice the powerful nature of this rational-choice theory: not only is an association between strictness and membership posited, but the mechanism linking these two factors (dealing with free riding) is also provided. The second method differs from the first in that it pays more attention to systemic as opposed to the individual concerns, and, as such, seeks to construct models of the structure of systems. Lawson and McCauley, for instance, propose a theoretical scheme to examine the cognitive representation of religious ritual.6 They account for religious phenomena utilizing a method similar to the static-structure laws from physics, and what is called structuralism in sociology7: explanation is accomplished by referring to something as being part of a larger whole. Specifically, they are interested in explaining why people engage in religious rituals, and they view this type of action as emanating from the cognitive 4. Ibid., p. 35. 5. Ibid., p. 36. 6. E.

To explain why young Zulu males ritually ingest love potions, for instance, an appeal is made to the entire series of rituals that must be performed before a young man becomes eligible to marry.8 The action of drinking the potion is thus simply one piece in a much larger puzzle. The third method involves the use of mathematical demography. Demographers view population change, for instance, as being comprised of three fundamental processes: fertility, mortality and migration. In the migration vein, scholars of religion have studied interdenominational mobility patterns.9 Marriage trends are also of considerable interest to demographers, and there has been some very interesting work on religious assortative marriage.10 The causal modeling approach to the study of religion (and other sociological phenomena) involves attempts to partition quantitatively the variance in a dependent variable among several independent variables. The methods just mentioned improve on this approach in a variety of ways. Rational-choice theories specify the actual individual-level behavioral mechanisms that lead to observed associations between variables. This is very different from the murky nature typical of causal models, in which it is usually not clear how independent variables come to exert their effects. Structural methods do not seek to account for variation at all, but rather for what is constant. Lieberson has argued that the focus in sociology on explaining variation is often misguided, because what is of primary interest is often constant and not variable (e.g., the structure of religious ritual).11 Demographic methods at times employ causal reasoning, as in the example above, but need not do so: the Malthusian model of population growth simply says that populations grow according to a geometric progression. Social-science research desperately needs more attention to theoretical development. I do not have in mind here efforts that are often included under the rubric of "theory," which are often little more than unproductive, ideological "critiques." To my mind a theory involves a precise specification of concepts and relations, preferably in mathematical form, which leads to a variety of readily testable 8.

The queen of the social sciences in this regard is certainly modern economics. General Equilibrium Theory, which describes the consumption and production structure of the entire economic system, taking only a small set of economic fundamentals as inputs, is but one example of the power of a social science. Scholars of religion who want to make similar strides in understanding their phenomena of interest would do well to utilize fields like economics as exemplars.</page></plain_text>
