Fresco paint ing became an integral part of this unified and archi tectural planning, and as the style developed, painters seemed to attain almost inexhaustible variety and talent within the limitations of the medium. Working in churches and palaces of Austria, South Germany, Poland, and Hungary, they learned from Italian pre decessors and adapted variegated styles to the intricate and original designs of the architectural planners, achieving in many areas individual local styles in the use of stucco and various architectural features. Among the most interesting on the Austrian scene, and one of the last, was Franz Anton Maulbertsch (1724-1796), a native of Langerargen on Lake Con stance, whose individual talent produced a style however dependent on a long tradition-of unmis takable quality and individuality. Maulbertsch worked mostly around Vienna, but also in Hungary and Bohemia. His chief monumental fresco decorations are in the Vienna Piaristenkirche Maria Treu (1753); in the Heiligenkreuz-Gutenbrunn Pfarrkirche (1758) and the Korneuburg Augustiner kirche (ca.1770), both located near Vienna; as well as in the Riesensaal of the Innsbruck Hofburg (1776) Figure 1.

Marlatt Fund. 63.326 in the Tyrol.2 Besides these and other heroic monu ments, Maulbertsch's genius appears in numerous smaller paintings in oil-bozzetti-often as not in tended as studies for larger undertakings, or used as such, but containing the visible personality of this rare genius whose invention and imagination, whose han dling of subjects, and whose use of color and composi tion set him apart as a creator of singular originality. As a decorator on a large scale, Maulbertsch pos sessed an uncanny sense of architectural loftiness and mystery, at the same time manifesting dramatic in tensity and awareness in the minutest details. He maintained in his small canvases - as conceived in larger paintings-a monumental vitality and force. One of these smaller canvases, and a little-known early work of Maulbertsch, The Presentation of Christ in the Temple (Fig. 1),3 has been acquired by the Mu seum this past year. Maulbertsch's work is rare out side the regions of his activity; it is infrequently seen in European galleries and as yet hardly at all in Amer ica. This example of his work, in excellent condition, represents his manner. Rich in coloring, it possesses the imaginative fantasy of his peculiarly personal in vention. Upon its first appearance in private hands in the late 1950's, the Museum's Presentation was published by Charles de Tolnay.4 De Tolnay considers it a work of the 1750's, painted early in Maulbertsch's career, and relates it closely in style to others of the period, particularly the newly-discovered ceiling fresco in Kirchstetten in Lower Austria; the Marriage of the Virgin (1775), a sketch for the high altar of the Vi enna Piaristenkirche, in the Baroque Museum of the Belvedere; or the sketch of St. Sebastian Receiving the Hungarian Crown in the Bavarian Staatsmuseum, Munich. 15</page><page sequence="3">De Tolnay draws a comparison with the monumental altar sketch by Giambattista Pittoni of a Presentation of Christ in the Temple in the Correr Museum in Ven ice.5 The position of Simeon in the center and the kneeling Mary to the right, the architectural compo sition with the circular steps in the foreground, the over-dramatic monumental classical peristyle, over shadowed by the curtain, the floating angels pushing away folds of the drapery seem inspired, he thinks, by this similar composition. He likens the facial types to Pittoni's manner. Yet, they appear somehow more readily the invention of Maulbertsch himself, main taining uniformly a family resemblance to be found throughout his painting. Maulbertsch created lofty compositions which he may have derived from Pit toni, but also from Piazzetta, Pozzo, and others. He definitely created his own melodramatic ambiance by using overshadowing curtains, as here, inexplicably attached to a base. An aura or sftumatura of eery mys tery in the variations of his sources of light and sha dows, reminiscent of Rembrandt who certainly influ enced him, give peculiar rich nuances of dark and :r ~~~~~~:?ic, )~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~?c~~~~~~~~~~~~~-?~~~~~~~~~~~~~;~~~~ light, in that order, and set his figures in silhouette against a smoky, lighted background. In his use of colors, atmospheric blues and yellows in the distance contrast with his darkly-lighted foregrounds which in turn are filled with vivid highlights (Fig. 2). Whites, deep blues and reds, bole-browns (Fig. 3), and somber shadow colors, notably in the costumes (Fig. 4), sug gest Piazzetta6 and the early Giambattista Tiepolo most of all. Maulbertsch was familiar with the decorations of preceding masters of fresco painting in Austria: Cos mo Damian Asam, as at Weltenburg; Matthaus Gin ther, his more immediate contemporary in the Pfarr kirche at Wilten, Innsbruck; Rottmayr at Klosterneu burg near Vienna; and especially Paul Troger, per haps his greatest predecessor as a fresco painter in Austria, at Melk, among others. Otto Benesch7 claims that Troger anticipates what he terms "certain transfigurative and fantastic ele ments" formed later in Maulbertsch's work; but that the latter carried these qualities further, making them visionary, fragmented, and almost anthropomorphic.

S",I ?</page><page sequence="4">Benesch suggests that he used iridescent colors as scintillating accents to heighten the ecstatic expres sions, filling them with inner intensity; expressionis tic where Tiepolo's were buoyantly materialistic. The tradition of fresco ceiling decoration in Italy, stemming as it did from the fifteenth century of Man tegna and Correggio, was on the one hand developed in Venice by Veronese and later by Piazzetta and Tie polo; and on the other hand brought to its dizzy heights in Rome by Andrea Pozzo (following Raphael and the Bolognese) in the magnificent ceiling of Sant' Ignazio, around the performance of which Pozzo had written his treatise on perspective. Lent by his patron, Pope Clement XI, Pozzo went to Austria around 1702, where he worked the last seven years of his life creating two masterpieces: the ceiling of the great hall in the summer palace of the Liechtenstein at Rosau and the interior of the University Church in Vienna, which he "turned ... into a little temple of glory and apotheosis in the Roman manner."8 These, Maulbertsch also knew, and from Pozzo's unmatched skill, he derived ideas of virtuosity in perspective.

'A2r ~</page><page sequence="5">Perhaps Maulbertsch's greatest compositional at tainment was his understanding and use of spiral ef fects, giving all his pictures a centrifugal aspect-as in the Museum's Presentation. The circular steps, the placing of the round column, and the arrangement of the figures around Simeon holding the Christ Child in the center contain the spiral motive. Another ver sion in oil (Fig. 5) of the same subject (the first de sign for a ceiling painting for the dome of Szombathe ly Cathedral, Hungary, a roundel with circular archi tectural background) is a related scheme, different only in the arrangement of the figures. Another early version (Fig. 6) has less lofty space in the setting. Maulbertsch's The Presentation of Christ in the Temple is the first Austrian baroque painting in the Museum collection, and adds a rare painting of high quality to accompany the sculpture discussed by Henry Hawley in this issue of the Bulletin.

Cooney has been appointed curator of the Department of Classical Antiquities. Mr. Cooney was formerly curator of the Department of Ancient Art at the Brooklyn Museum where he spent 25 years devel oping its Egyptian material into a major collection. He will take up his new duties in Cleveland on February 1. Mr. Cooney has concentrated his years of study on the art, rather than the archaeology of Egypt. Cleve land's new antiquities curator is also uniquely quali fied by his knowledge of several less well-known arts of ancient Egypt, particularly its glass. At the request of the British Museum he is compiling a catalog on their Egyptian glass and related collections. Mr. Cooney has been a frequent visitor to Egyptian collec tions in the United States and Europe; he has also ex cavated and studied in Egypt and was Director of the American Research Center in Cairo during 1952 and 1953. He graduated from Harvard College and later studied Semitic languages at Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania.
