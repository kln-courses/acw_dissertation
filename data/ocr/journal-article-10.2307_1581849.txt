<plain_text><page sequence="1">PATTERNS AND PECULIARITIES OF ISLAMIC REFORM IN AFRICA BY ROMAN LOIMETER (University of Bayreuth) ABSTRACT African Muslim societies were characterised, in the 20th century, by the emerg- ence of reformist movements that have gained, since the 1970s, major social, reli- gious and political influence in a number of countries, including Northern Nigeria, Senegal, Zanzibar and Sudan. These movements of reform are, however, not recent phenomena. Rather, they look back to a history of several generations of reformist endeavour and thought that may have been influenced, to a certain extent, by external sources of inspiration. This contribution shows how the biogra- phies of major reformist personalities such as Cheikh Tour6 in Senegal, Abubakar Gumi in Northern Nigeria and 'Abdallah Silih al-Farsy in East Africa reflect a number of common features of Islamic reform in Africa, while their programmes of reform were shaped, at the same time, by local frame conditions. * * * Introduction The development of African Muslim societies was characterised, in the 20th century, by the emergence of reformist movements that have gained considerable social, religious and political influence in a num- ber of African countries, including Northern Nigeria, Sudan and Zanzibar. These reformist movements were often (but not always) opposed to established traditions of Islamic scholarship, in particular the Sufi brother- hoods. They were also often (but not always) critical of specific aspects of the secular colonial as well as the post-colonial state. Reformist move- ments were, thus, often (but not always) characterised by anti-estab- lishment positions. In addition, Muslim reformist movements were active with respect to the development of modern Islamic education and have, in some cases, stimulated the development of social emancipation move- ments among Muslim women. At the same time, the development of movements of reform has also led to the multiplication of transnational ?

Muslim movements of reform in Africa are, however, not a recent phenomenon. Rather, they look back to a history of several generations of reformist endeavours that were based on even older Sufi traditions of reform. These traditions have continued to develop until today in a process of interaction with non-Sufi-oriented traditions of reform. Yet, Sufi-oriented and earlier movements of reform have often been omit- ted in a widespread and popular (and essentially colonial) paradigm of interpretation that presents Islamic reform as well as 'radical Islam' in Africa as an essentially 'foreign' (i.e. Arab, Near Eastern, Saudi, Iranian) 'phenomenon', which has been introduced only recently into suppos- edly 'innocent' African Muslim societies that are turned, thus, into out- posts of radical, anti-Sufi and 'Arab' Islam (for the development of these patterns of thought see Coulon 1978, Loimeier 2001 and Otayek 1993). As 20th-century movements of reform have indeed gone through phases of anti-Sufism in specific stages of their development, it was not difficult to project a temporary stage of development of reformist move- ments into the past. Yet, a dichotomic view of reformist Islam and Sufi 'Islam' is as misleading as the dichotomy of 'radical Arab' and 'accom- modating African' Islam. The emergence of local traditions of reform in Africa was, thus, not only influenced by external poles of orientation such as Egypt or Saudi Arabia, but also formed by local frame conditions. In fact, the local context has always been decisive for the success or failure of a specific movement of reform. Although we have, for instance, a number of suc- cess stories as far as Muslim movements of reform are concerned, such as Northern Nigeria or Zanzibar, where Muslim reformist movements have gained considerable social as well as political influence, there are also some cases where movements of reform have had, so far, only marginal, partial or even negligible influence on the development of Islamic societies. In Senegal, Kenya and Tanganyika, reformist move- ments have had, for instance, a long tradition and may have even been able to influence some parts of society but they have not been able to gain the support of a majority of the Muslim population. Finally, movements of reform have not brought about an increasing homogeneity of African Muslim societies and also do not form a united front of reform as their poles of orientation in the 'northern' Muslim world (Morocco, Algeria, Libya, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait, Iran and Pakistan) are characterised by strong political and religious antagonisms as well as a long tradition of internal rivalry. In addition, 238</page><page sequence="3">Patterns and Peculiarities of Islamic Reform in Africa 'Northern' Muslim movements of reform should be seen as a 'spec- trum' of different expressions and historical experiences of 'reform' reaching from the rather accommodating and intellectualist Salafiyya movement as inspired by Muhammad 'Abduh (d. 1905) and, later, Muhammad Rashid Rida (d. 1935), to the populist mass organisation of the 'Muslim Brothers' (al-Ikhwdn al-Muslimin), as founded by Hassan al-Banna (d. 1949), to, finally, the politically radical Islamist networks such as the Jamdaat at-Takfir wa-l-Hjra, which were often inspired by Muslim intellectuals such as Sayyid Qutb (d. 1966) from Egypt and Abu l-A'la al-Maududi (d. 1979) from Pakistan, whose writings have gained considerable influence in the last decades as they were mostly kept in English and, thus, were easily understandable to the majority of non-Arab (and Arabic-speaking) Muslims in Africa and India. On account of these vast differences in programmes, styles, orientation, financial backing and claims for spiritual superiority in the Muslim 'North', the Muslim movements of reform in Africa have always been able to 'play' with these rivalries and to balance 'Northern' influences in their own national and local strategies of development and political orientation. Issues of Reform Before looking closely at the biographies of these major personalities of Islamic reform in Africa, it is necessary, however, to dwell on the concept of 'reform' that might possibly evoke associations with Euro- pean Protestant reformism, in particular when we speak about Muslim movements of reform from a religious perspective. In fact, it may look somewhat far-fetched to compare Muslim movements of reform in sub- Saharan Africa in the 19th and 20th centuries with the emergence of European Protestant reform in the 15th and 16th centuries as the his- torical background is rather different. Yet, when we look at the struc- tural features of European (or, at least, German) Protestantism in the 15th and 16th centuries, we might come to the conclusion that there are a number of structural similarities. Thus, a group of researchers at the Max Planck Institute for History in Gottingen has stressed that the 15th and 16th centuries could be regarded, in Germany, as a period of 'cultural reformation', characterised by a thorough process of reli- gious, social and cultural re-orientation, which led to a change in the 'Deutungsmuster', the 'patterns of explanation and interpretation' of the world (Ehrenpreis/Lotz-Heumann 2002: 1-3). Protestant movements in 15th and 16th century Germany were, thus, 239</page><page sequence="4">Roman Loimeier united by the fact that they combined the quest for theological truth, in particular with respect to the meaning and content of the Bible, with political aims. Also, European reformism was connected with Luther's dictum that 'the meaning of the Bible has to be understood by every- body', an opinion which led not only to the translation of the Bible into Europe's vernacular languages, but also to a boom in the print- ing of Bibles and many other texts, including theological pamphlets (Streitschriften). This development provided, for the first time in European history, for individual access to the holy text. With the teachings of Luther, an interpretation of the faith also gained influence that tended to stress the direct link between man and God, and rejected interme- diaries such as the Church and the clergy, or practices such as Fiirbitte (intercession, in Arabic tawassul) and absolution (SiindenablaJf). By con- trast, the responsibility of the individual with respect to God (Selbstver- antwortung vor Gott) as well as the paramount role of the Bible (and not the dogmas of the church) were emphasised. At the same time, a move- ment of purification of the faithful as well as the churches started, icons (in particular saints) were destroyed, a number of ceremonies, even bur- ial ceremonies, were restrained or abolished (for instance in Calvinist Geneva). Thus, a distinct anti-iconic turn took place and established beliefs were criticised and attacked as superstitions. Finally, the discourse about religion started to dominate society, while popular religious prac- tices were marginalised: a 'second' Christianisation of Europe began, as more and more people started not only to read but to also inter- pret religion, a movement which led to new (but different) forms of religiosity (Ehrenpreis and Lotz-Heumann 2002: 41, 65, 83-85 and 90). With respect to Muslim movements of 'reform', or tajdid (renewal, rejuvenation), as Muslim reformers often describe their own endeav- ours to achieve social and religious change, we should see 'reform' as a conscious and intentional effort to achieve social, religious, cultural, political or economical change with respect to a specific society or specific aspects of social life. Muslim initiatives of reform, in fact, often concentrate on issues such as education, the proper ritual or the role of women and are therefore easily identifiable. Yet, in a longue duree perspective on processes of reform we come to see that issues of reform are increasingly difficult to isolate. They tend to disappear in the maze of social change and the various processes of transformation, which are again influenced by many different forces and factors. Initiatives of reform tend to blend into these general processes of social change and thus to lose their specific character. This impression may also prevail when we look at the history of 240</page><page sequence="5">Patterns and Peculiarities of Islamic Reform in Africa Muslim movements of reform in Africa. Again from a longue duree per- spective of historical change, we will see that these movements were united by a number of features such as the popularisation of educa- tion as well as the development of new concepts of education. Muslim movements of reform have also often stressed independent access to texts and, as a consequence, supported the translation of holy texts into vernacular languages. Furthermore, they have tended to attack estab- lished scholars and institutions, and criticised conspicuous expenditure for social and religious rituals. In addition, they have been very out- spoken with respect to spiritualistic interpretations of religion and con- demned many different forms of alleged 'superstition' and popular ritual as unislamic innovations (bid'a, plural bida'). Finally, they have instru- mentalised religion as a platform to express political protest and to dele- gitimise political authority often described as 'unjust'. And although these features of reform may not be shared by all movements of reform at all times, they form the core of reformist initiatives since, probably, the 19th century, and seem to have, if reduced to their very abstract structure, an almost 'Protestant' reformist quality, even when we take into account that a number of important differences still exist, such as, for instance, the attributed nature of Bible and Qur'an. In fact, one of the critics of the radical reformist ansdr as-sunna group in Zanzibar men- tioned with respect to the social and religious concepts of reform of the watu wa bida ('people of innovation', as the ansdr as-sunna are locally known) that 'they are like Protestants' (conversation with Mwalimu Ishaq, 14.7.2002), thus reflecting the popular perception of this move- ment of reform. In this paper I aim to show how major reformers such as Cheikh Toure in Senegal, Abubakar Gumi in Northern Nigeria and Shaykh al-Amin b. 'Ali al-Mazru'i as well as 'Abdallah Salih al-Farsy in East Africa reflect local peculiarities in the development of their discourse in addition to programmes of reform. Their biographies show how the founding fathers of 'modern' reformist thought in Senegal, Nigeria and East Africa have not only influenced the more recent generations of Islamic reform but also drawn inspiration from former movements of reform. In fact, the biographies of Cheikh Toure, Abubakar Gumi, Shaykh al-Amin b. 'Ali al-Mazrui' and 'Abdallah Salih al-Farsy may be interpreted as representing an anti-Sufi 'turn' in the development of Islamic reformist thought in Africa. Yet the religious and ideologi- cal as well as political convictions of even these founding fathers of 20th-century Islamic reform in Africa also show that their positions have been changing all the time and thus reflect the development of 241</page><page sequence="6">Roman Loimeier their respective societies. A longue duree perspective on the development of Islamic reform may reveal the peculiarities of reformist movements in Africa and will show that, as a Nigerian saying goes, 'no condition is permanent'. Cheikh Toure (Senegal) While many secondary sources usually connect the emergence of a Senegalese tradition of reform with Cheikh Toure (born 1925) and the 'Union Culturelle Musulmane' (al-Ittihdd ath-Thaqdfi al-Isldmz, ITI, estab- lished in 1953), reformist thought is, in fact, much older, in Senegal, and goes back to the mid-19th century. In the context of the emer- gence of the 'quatre communes' (St Louis, Goree, Dakar and Rufisque) in Senegal after 1848, a Muslim civil rights movement started to develop, fighting for the public recognition of distinctive Muslim norms, customs and rites as well as, in particular, Islamic personal law (see Johnson 1971). This movement was connected with the activities of Muslim intellectuals and scholars such as Ahmad Ndiaye Hann, Muhammad Seck and Ndiaye Sarr (Loimeier 2001: 90). In the early 20th century, the Muslim civil rights movements acquired additional weight as Muslims struggled to gain control over the organisation of the hajj and to extend the annual pilgrim quotas. In order to improve the conditions of the haji, a Union fratemelle des Pelerins Musulmans de lA.O.F. was established in 1922, followed by many other local pilgrims' associations. In 1936, the French colonial administration estimated the number of these 'asso- ciations' to be more than fifty in Dakar alone (Loimeier 2001: 168). Also, by the early 1930s, a new type of reformist organisation had been established which started to campaign for a more encompassing pro- gramme of reform, such as modern concepts of Islamic education. The avant-garde of this new form of reformist organisation was formed by the Liwd' Ta'alkh al-Muslim as-Sdlih (Brigade de la Fraternite du Bon Musulman) founded in 1934. However, these associations were still mostly confined to urban areas and essentially fought for limited goals such as the improvement of the pilgrimage, Islamic personal law and a distinctive Muslim code of dress. Also, the majority of members of these 'associ- ations' and, in particular, their leadership, was still affiliated with a Sufi brotherhood, in most cases the Tijaniyya (Loimeier 2001: 168). The establishment of the ITI in 1953, may, thus, be seen as the real watershed in the development of modern reformist organisations, as the ITI, under the leadership of its major inspirer, Cheikh Toure, was the first organisation to develop an encompassing programme of reform. 242</page><page sequence="7">Patterns and Peculiarities of Islamic Reform in Africa 243 This programme has influenced all subsequent movements of reform in Senegal and has also exerted considerable influence on Muslim move- ments of reform in neighbouring countries, in particular, Guinea, Mali, Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso. In its programme and public discourse, the ITI was strongly influenced by North African traditions in reform, especially the Algerian Jam'yyat al-'Ulamd' al-Muslimfn al-Jaza'iriyyzn (see Merad 1967). In addition, the ITI cultivated a discourse that was not only critical of French colonial administration policies but also attacked the Senegalese Sufi brotherhoods, in particular, those marabouts (reli- gious leaders) who cooperated closely with the colonial administration. Yet, when we take a closer look at Cheikh Toure as well as the pro- gramme of the ITI, we discover that neither Cheikh Toure nor the ITI categorically refused to cooperate with the (colonial) state or con- demned Sufism as a whole. Thus, Cheikh Toure, who went through the career of a typical 'dlim (religious scholar), never relinquished his links with the Tijaniyya. In a personal communication he even main- tained that 'concerning my affiliation with the Tijaniyya, I never really renounced it, neither in the 1950s, nor earlier, or later. It is only that my numerous activities have prevented me from practising the ritual regularly' (Cheikh Toure, 13.4.1992; for his biography see Loimeier 1994). In fact, Cheikh Toure was born as a member of one of the most respected families of religious scholars of the Tijaniyya in Senegal, the Toure family in Fass Toure. In Fass Toure, he studied the Qur'an as well as Arabic, kaldm, sira and hadith, with his uncle, Shaykh Hady Toure. Yet, in contrast to other families of the Tijaniyya in Senegal, the Toure family never practised the system of maraboutage, that is, com- plete submission of the students to the authority of their teachers, and was, thus, regarded by other prominent Tijani families as 'dissident' (Cheikh Toure in Le Musulman, No. 26, 1989). After his basic educa- tion, Cheikh Toure went to St Louis to continue his talab al-'ilm (search for knowledge) and studied with a famous Mauritanian scholar of that time, Mukhtar Uld Hamidoun, who introduced him, from 1944, to the writings of Muhammad 'Abduh and other Salafi thinkers. The final 'conversion' to reformist thought came, however, only in 1952, when Cheikh Toure was able to stay for some months, as part of a group of Senegalese students, at the Centre Bin Bddis in Constantine (Algeria), where he was able to witness the efforts of the Algerian Jam'yyat al- 'Ulamd' al-Muslimzn al-J7azd'iriyyzn to reform Algerian society. These efforts of reform had not only weakened the social role of the Algerian Sufi brotherhoods, which had already been discredited on account of their cooperation with the French colonial administration, but had also brought</page><page sequence="8">Roman Loimeier about the establishment of a huge network of reformist schools that came to constitute one of the backbones of the Algerian struggle for liberation after 1954. The Algerian experience also turned out to be the model for the foundation of the ITI, which was established after Cheikh Toure's return to Senegal, on September 6th, 1953. Yet, although the ITI took up some of the issues of the Algerian reformers and cultivated, at least for some years, an anti-tarnqa as well as anti-colonial discourse, as may be seen, for instance, from the major programmatic text written by Cheikh Toure, Afin que tu deviennes un croy- ant (Dakar, 1957), the ITI also cooperated with marabouts such as Ibrahim Niass or Cheikh Ahmad Mbakke who were known for their, at times, critical position with respect to the colonial administration. Finally, the UCM was closely affiliated with the Mamadou Dia wing of the Union Progressiste Senegalaise (UPS). The UPS, which was to rise to political power after 1958, advocated serious reforms that were, at least in parts, inspired by the programme of the ITI and threatened the dominant position of the great marabouts. As a consequence, both Tijani and Mourid marabouts supported Senghor's coup against Prime Minister Mamadou Dia in late 1962, which led to the demise of Dia's pro- gramme of structural reforms that might have broken the power of the marabouts as Sekou Toure's reforms did in Guinea in the late 1950s. In the 1960s and 1970s, Senghor managed to 'tame' the ITI and to inte- grate Muslims reformist groups into state-controlled associations such as the Federation des Associations Islamiques du Senegal (FAIS). Only in the late 1970s were Muslim reformers able to free themselves of state con- trol and to establish, inspired again by Cheikh Toure, new reformist organisations such as the Jamd'at 'Ibdd ar-Rahmdn (JIR) or the Harakat al-Faldh (HF). The JIR may today be regarded as Senegal's most impor- tant reformist organisation, although even the JIR has not managed to break the overwhelming position of power of both Tijani and Mourid marabouts (see Gomez-Perez 1991). Externally, the JIR was strongly influenced by the Iranian revolu- tion and established contacts with a number of 'Northern' Muslim coun- tries as well as reformist organisations of Saudi Arabian as well as Libyan and Egyptian extraction. Internally, the JIR initially continued the reformist discourse of the ITI with respect to the so-called 'un- Islamic innovations', the bida, such as excessive spending for marriage ceremonies, burials, the practice of the dhikr, as well as specific features of local Islamic ritual and religious concepts such as the wearing of amulets (gri-gris) which are produced in Senegal in vast amounts and are exported, interestingly enough, to Saudi Arabia where Senegalese 244</page><page sequence="9">Patterns and Peculiarities of Islamic Reform in Africa amulets seem to enjoy great popularity among the Muslim masses. In the 1980s, the JIR seems to have realised, however, that the struggle against the marabouts and the Sufi brotherhoods was largely counter- productive on account of the on-going popularity of the Tijaniyya and Muridiyya. In the late 1980s, the JIR has, thus, suspended its polemics against the marabouts and redirected the emphasis of polemics against the secular state. Thus, the JIR has also managed to escape the dilemma of being accused of creatingfitna (disruption, chaos, anarchy) by fighting against fellow Muslims. More recently, the JIR even seems to cultivate a public discourse that concentrates on topics such as the 'moral decay of contemporary Senegalese society', issues such as drug abuse, prosti- tution and other undesirable effects of modernisation that may easily be pinned on the secular state and its incapability to provide for a bal- anced social development of the society. Thus, bida' marabouts and Sufi brotherhoods are no longer the major target of the critique of the more recent reformist organisations in Senegal. Rather, they concentrate on the development of modem Islamic schools and social activities, in particular, activities connected with the youth and the women. In fact, the Jamcdat Ibdd ar-Rahman as well as Cheikh Toure or the Harakat al-Falah nowadays seem to focus largely on education. Their educational efforts have stimulated again, in the 1990s, the establishment of numerous reformist Islamic schools which not only teach traditional Islamic sciences such as Arabic, Qur'an and hadith, but which also stress the importance of the so-called 'marketable skills' as well as female education. The success of these new schools has again forced the Sufi brotherhoods to follow suit with educational programmes of their own. As a consequence, modern Islamic educa- tion has today become a viable alternative to state-controlled secular education. Abubakar Gumi (Northern Nigeria) While Islamic reform has had a long tradition in Senegal, going back to the mid-19th century, one might say that, by comparison, the tra- dition of Islamic reform in Northern Nigeria is much shorter and essen- tially starts with Abubakar Gumi (1922-1992) and his efforts towards Islamic reform in the 1950s. Yet, I would like to argue here that we might also interpret the Sokoto jihad (1804-08) in the early 19th cen- tury as a distinctive movement of reform. Murray Last, at least, has stressed that 'the jihad was primarily a reform movement, reforming lax Muslims not converting pagans' (Last 1979: 273). A major element 245</page><page sequence="10">Roman Loimeier of the jihadist discourse was, in fact, their critique of the bida' which were perpetrated or tolerated by the Muslim rulers of the Hausa states and an important result of the jihad was the emergence of an educa- tional movement that tried to address, for the first time in Northern Nigerian history, Muslim women, as the efforts of Nana Asma'u, Usman dan Fodio's daughter, show. The legacy of the Sokoto jihad was so important for the development of Islam in Northern Nigeria that Abubakar Gumi, who was known for his pro-Saudi positions and who was in fact often accused of 'Wahhabi' ideas and policies, strongly defended the legacy of the Sokoto jihad, although the jihadists were known for their affiliations with the Qadiriyya Sufi brotherhood, and maintained that 'his own efforts of reform (or tajdid, renewal) would have been meaningless without the achievements of Usman dan Fodio' (personal communication Abubakar Gumi, 17.9.1987). When we look, now, at the development of 'modern' reformism in Northern Nigeria, we have to accept that this 'modern' movement of reform was intrinsically connected with the life and work of Abubakar Gumi (for his biography see Tsiga 1992 and Loimeier 1997), the Grand Qadi of Northern Nigeria in the 1950s and 1960s, who became, like Cheikh Toure in Senegal, the inspirer of a major modern organisation of Islamic reform in Northern Nigeria, namely the Jamd'at Izalat al-Bid'a wa-Iqamat as-Sunna or, 'Yan Izala, as this movement is publicly known in Northern Nigeria (see Loimeier 1997). Yet, when we take a closer look at Abubakar Gumi, we see that he had not always been in the forefront of Islamic reform. After follow- ing the typical formation of an 'dlim and attending British colonial gov- ernment schools, he was thus, until the late 1940s, in close contact with the Qadiriyya Sufi brotherhood. In fact, he nurtured a life-long rela- tionship of competition and critical dialogue with Nasiru Kabara (1925- 96), the major leader of a reformist movement within the Nigerian Qadiriyya. In contrast to Nasiru Kabara, who was to remain an 'dlim throughout his life, Gumi trained at the School of Arabic Studies (SAS) in Kano, to become a Qadi in the British colonial system of jurisdic- tion. After a number of rather personal clashes with representatives of the local administration, which was still dominated by the Sultan of Sokoto (see Loimeier 1997a), Gumi finally joined, in the early 1950s, the party of the modernisers of the North, the Northern People's Congress (NPC), led by Prime Minister Ahmadu Bello. Under the leadership of Bello, the NPC fought a bitter though successful struggle against the established authorities in Northern Nigeria. In the context of this devel- opment, Gumi rose to become the Grand Qadi of Northern Nigeria 246</page><page sequence="11">Patterns and Peculiarities of Islamic Reform in Africa 247 and used this position to marginalise his opponents among the religious scholars. Since the early 1960s, Gumi also played an influential role in the Saudi-based Rdbitat al-'Alam al-Isldmf (Muslim World League), prob- ably the most important Muslim international organisation (see Schulze 1990). When his mentor Ahmadu Bello was assassinated, however, in the context of the 1966 military coup in Nigeria, Gumi lost his polit- ical mentor and had to continue his struggle against the scholarly estab- lishment on his own. Yet, his efforts to acquire public support for his ideas of reform largely failed, as, among other reasons, his texts, in particular, his most important polemic against Sufism, al-'aqida as-sahiha (The right faith), were written in Arabic. Gumi finally decided to change his strategy in the 1970s and not only translated the 'aqida into Hausa under the title Musulunci da Abin da ke rushe shi (Islam and the things which are destroying it), but also started a translation of the Qur'an into Hausa, which was finally published under the title Tarjamar Ma'anonin Alkurani Maigirma zuwa harshen Hausa, in 1978. In addition, he initiated the foundation of a reformist organisation that became soon know as 'Yan Izala. Since their foundation in 1978, the 'Yan Izala have become famous for their harsh critique of any kind of bid'a and of the practices of the Sufi brotherhoods, the Tijaniyya in particular (see Umar 1988). Externally, the 'Yan Izala movement cultivated strong links with Saudi Arabia and were, in fact often depicted in Nigeria as a 'Wahhabi' movement. However, the struggle of the 'Yan Izala against the Tijaniyya and, to a lesser extent, against the Qadiriyya, which had been the major issue of 'Yan Izala strategies from 1978 to the late 1980s, was stopped in the late 1980s on account of strategic considerations: the leadership of the 'Yan Izala realised that their constant attacks on the Tijaniyya and the Qadiriyya effectively split the Northern Nigerian Muslim umma and, thus, brought about Jitna. This was seen to be highly problematic in the context of the growing influence of Protestant mission activities in Northern Nigeria since the mid-1980s. In fact, a number of Sufi polemics had focused, in the 1980s, on the fitna the 'Yan Izala had started among the Muslims by their constant attacks against the Sufi brotherhoods and had raised the question as to why the 'Tan Izala would abstain, for instance, from fighting the increasing influence of Christian mission organisations. The rapid expansion of Christian churches and mission organisations in Northern Nigeria in the 1980s as well as the need to achieve Muslim unity in order to enhance the chances of Muslim politi- cians to win national elections, finally forced Abubakar Gumi to come to terms with his opponents among the Sufi scholars. As a consequence,</page><page sequence="12">Roman Loimeier he proclaimed, in a famous interview with the Gaskiya newspaper in 1987, that 'politics was more important than prayer (syasa tafi muhim- manci da salla)', and that Muslim men should allow their women to vote and 'to mix' in public, especially in times of impending elections: '. . if this is not done, even to the point of letting unbelievers predominate, then what is our position?... It is a necessity that every man takes his women and children above the age of eighteen to register so that we can predominate over the Non-Muslims' (A. Gumi in Gaskiya as quoted by A. Christelow 1987: 323-4). In order to achieve Muslim unity, Abubakar Gumi finally even overcame, in 1990, his opposition to Nasiru Kabara and visited his former teacher in his house in Kano, an event commented on by Bature Idris Gana, reporter of the Kano daily The Triumph with the words 'Dare daya Allah kanyi Bature' (if God wishes, he may turn [a black man] into a white man) (Loimeier 1997: 309). As a consequence of these processes of change and their effect on strategy, the 'Yan Izala movement has undergone a serious crisis of ori- entation in the 1990s. This crisis has been connected with Abubakar Gumi's death in 1992 and the fact that the organisation has since then not been able to find a new murshid 'amm (spiritual guide) who would have been acceptable to the different wings of the movement which have developed, in the 1990s, in the context of questions of strategy with respect to the organisation's positions regarding the Nigerian state as well as the Sufi brotherhoods. In addition, the 'ran Izala have not managed to monopolise the field of Islamic reform in Northern Nigeria. Thus, the Muslim Students' Society (MSS) had already won considerable support, in the 1970s, among the student population on account of their radical positions in political terms and since the 1980s, other, though smaller, and often MSS-related movements of reform started to form, introducing a decisively political discourse into public debates in Northern Nigeria. A number of these recent reformist organisations, such as the Islamic Movement under the leadership of Ibrahim az-Zakzaky as well as Yakubu Yahya, were able, in the 1990s in particular, to gain considerable popularity on account of their consequent opposition to the series of military regimes which were supported, at the same time, by Abubakar Gumi and the 'Yan Izala (see Loimeier 1997b). These recent and radical movements of reform have, however, until today stuck to a rather political and ideological discourse and have not devel- oped programmes of social reform. The 'Yan Izala, on the other side, had started, already in the late 1970s, to propagate modern Islamic education. A major reason for their popular success in Northern Nigeria in the 1980s was their effort to establish modern Islamiyya schools in 248</page><page sequence="13">Patterns and Peculiarities of Islamic Reform in Africa 249 vast parts of Northern Nigeria as well as to advocate women's educa- tion. Yet, the movement of educational reform propagated by the 'Tan Izala has again quickly triggered similar movements of educational reform within both the Tijaniyya and the Qadiriyya Sufi brotherhoods. As a consequence, the level of formal education amongst Muslims in Northern Nigeria has grown significantly since the 1980s. Shaykh 'Abdallh Sdlih al-Farsy (East Africa) What has been said for the development of Muslim movements of reform in Senegal and Northern Nigeria may also be repeated with respect to the East African Coast in general and Zanzibar in particu- lar. Thus, Islamic reform should not be regarded as a recent feature of the development of East African Muslim societies that was essen- tially stimulated here by outside, particularly Saudi or Iranian, influences. Rather, we should again see Islamic reform in East Africa as a historical tradition that looks back to several generations of Muslim reformers. Thus, Shaykh al-Amin b. 'All al-Mazri'i (1890-1947) and his disciple, Shaykh 'Abdallah Salih al-Farsy (1912-1982), in East Africa have stressed their connection with the scholars of the Egyptian Salafiyya, namely Muhammad 'Abduh and Rashid Rida, or, more recently, with the Saudi Arabian Wahhabiya, the Iranian revolution and Indo-Pakistani religious movements such as the Tablighz Jama'at (see Masud 2000). Yet, the roots of reform in East Africa go back again to earlier Sufi- oriented traditions of reform, in particular, the tradition of the 'Alawi scholars from Hadramaut and the Comoros. The 'Alawi scholars were the first to introduce new concepts of Islamic education on the East African coast in the late 1880s. They also started to introduce new dis- ciplines of Islamic learning and criticised specific practices of the Qadiriyya Sufi brotherhood such as the dhikr with dufu-drums (see Pouwels 1987). Scholars of the 'Alawi network of scholars such as Ahmad b. Sumayt (1861-1925), 'Abdallah Ba Kathir al-Kindi (1860-1925) or Shaykh Ahmad b. 'Ali 'Sayyid Mansab' al-Husayni (1863-1927) were also in contact with the writings of the Egyptian Salafiyya, in particular, the pioneer- ing journals al-'urwa al-wuthqd' and al-mandr. Still, neither Ahmad b. Sumayt nor Sayyid Mansab accepted Salafi thought as part of their own concept of reform. The 'Alawi efforts of reform, however, opened 'classical' Islamic education to a much broader spectrum of the Muslim population (see Pouwels 1987). The spectrum of reform was expanded even more, when Shaykh al- Amin b. 'Ali al-Mazrfi'i started to introduce, from the 1930s, a number</page><page sequence="14">Roman Loimeier of new ideas that led to the subsequent formation of a popular move- ment of Islamic reform in East Africa which was further extended by one of his students, Shaykh 'Abdallah Salih al-Farsy. Shaykh al-Amin b. 'Ali al-Mazru'i, the major inspirer of Islamic reform in East Africa, Grand Qadi of Kenya, founder of several reformist journals such as as-Saheefa ('the journal') and Islah ('reform'), and teacher of many sub- sequent reformist scholars, was, thus, the first scholar to start a distinct anti-bida' discourse in East Africa, which was directed against Sufi prac- tices as such. In addition, he stressed the importance of modern (not only Islamic) education as well as the importance of female education and wrote texts in the vernacular, Kiswahili. Like Abubakar Gumi in Nigeria, Shaykh al-Amin also fought a hard struggle against the Indian Ahmadiyya movement that had started to propagate its own concept of a modern Islamic society in East Africa in the 1930s. Through its translation of the Qur'an into Kiswahili, the Ahmadiyya was also able to gain considerable public attention. The struggle against the Ahmadiyya thus became a major motivation for another, 'proper', translation of the Qur'an, an effort started by Shaykh al-Amin and finished by Shaykh 'Abdallah Salih al-Farsy in 1969 (see Lacunza-Balda 1997). The biography and career of an East African reformer such as Shaykh 'Abdallah Salih al-Farsy shows again, however, how difficult it is to present a clear picture of Islamic reform, particularly on account of the 'biographical dimension' of the development of reformist ideas and posi- tions. Shaykh 'Abdallah Salih al-Farsy was appointed Chief Qadi of Kenya (1968-1980), and he became one of the most outspoken sup- porters of 'Wahhabi' (radical Islamic) thought in East Africa in the 1970s, although he consistently refused, for instance, to adopt some specific Wahhabi positions on theology such as the anthropomorphic interpretation of the ayat al-kursi (the 'throne-verse' in the Qur'an, 2:255) which portrays God as actually 'sitting' on 'his throne' (communication 'Abd al-Wahhab 'Alawi 'Abd al-Wahhab Jamal al-Layl, 2.3.2003). His translation of the Qur'an into Kiswahili, Kurani Takatzfu, spread widely in East Africa as did his numerous other works and treatises on the history of Muslim scholars in East Africa or specific aspects of the faith. These works were again often written in Kiswahili and have contributed a lot to the popularisation of Islamic thought in East Africa since the 1940s. Shaykh 'Abdallah Salih al-Farsy's diatribes against scholars affiliated with the 'Alawi tradition (in Kenya) or the Qadiriyya Sufi brotherhood (in Zanzibar), as well as his critique of specific features of local religious practice such as the dhikr of the Sufi groups or other alleged bida' have always been part of local debates and disputes (for 250</page><page sequence="15">Patterns and Peculiarities of Islamic Reform in Africa his biography see his personal file, Zanzibar National Archives, ZNA AB 86/136). Until 1967, when he finally decided to emigrate to Kenya, Shaykh 'Abdallah Salih al-Farsy had, thus, been a member of Zanzibar's local scholarly establishment. In his youth, he had studied at the feet of almost every eminent religious scholar in Zanzibar, including 'Abdallah Ba Kathir and 'Umar b. Sumayt (1896-1976). Through these scholars, Shaykh 'Abdallah Salih al-Farsy was subsequently initiated into the cir- cles of the 'Alawi scholars in Zanzibar, taught in their madaris, and rose to become Imam and khatib in some of their most respected mosques. Also, like his contemporaries among the 'Alawi and Qadiri scholars, Shaykh 'Abdallah Salih al-Farsy, who had attended a government school, joined the colonial administration by becoming, first of all, a teacher in 1933, and then, in 1947, Inspector of Religious Education in Zanzibar's government schools. In 1960, he was finally appointed Qadi of Zanzibar and thus became one of the successors of Sayyid 'Umar b. Sumayt, the pre-eminent representative of the 'Alawi tradition of learning in Zanzibar in that period of time. Even after the revolution of January 12th, 1964, Shaykh 'Abdallah Salih al-Farsy continued to work for the new (socialist) government and decided to leave Zanzibar only when the general political situation became desperate in 1967. The fact that he turned into an outstand- ing opponent of the 'Alawi tradition of thought in Kenya is, thus, per- haps only connected with the fact that the local Kenyan scholars did not like an 'outsider' being imposed upon them as Chief Qadi, while they had enough competent candidates for this office themselves. Also, the local scholars represented a long tradition of Islamic thought and scholarship and were not prepared to accept Shaykh 'Abdallah Salih al-Farsy's claim to spiritual leadership. Consequently, they started to criticise his sermons as well as to attack his translation of the Qur'an. In a counter-reaction, Shaykh 'Abdallah Salih al-Farsy fought back and thus turned into Kenya's first 'Wahhabi' (communication Muhammad Bakari, 21.10.2001). While Muslim reformist positions received a fair amount of govern- ment recognition in Senegal (at least from 1957 to 1962) and Northern Nigeria, the development of recent reformist movements in East Africa has been rather complex, because Muslims in Kenya, Tanzania (Tanganyika and Zanzibar) and Uganda have to face totally different frame conditions in each country and even within each of these coun- tries. Thus, Muslims in Kenya as well as mainland Tanzania are con- fronted with dynamic churches and Christian mission organisations, 251</page><page sequence="16">Roman Loimeier while they had to come to terms, in Zanzibar, with the legacy of the 1964 revolution and a socialist regime that frowned, for some time at least, on any religious activity. Recent movements of reform in East Africa either have tried to develop counter-strategies with respect to Christian missions (as did, for instance, Shaykh Sa'id Musa in main- land Tanzania, see Lacunza-Balda 1997) or have developed positions of political opposition to largely authoritarian regimes (as did, for instance, the Islamic Party of Kenya, under the rather short-lived leadership of Khalid Balala; see Cruise O'Brien 1995 and Chande 2000). Thus, Muslim reform movements in East Africa again reflect the peculiarities of their respective societies. As a result, Muslim movements of reform in East Africa are split today, even more than in Senegal or Nigeria, into a multitude of different and competing organisations, which have not yet found the energy to develop, for instance, convincing structures of Islamic education that would constitute a challenge to respective Christian efforts. Muslims in East Africa, therefore, often convey the impression that they are pushed against the wall. Patterns and peculiarities of Islamic reform in Africa We have seen, so far, that it is possible to speak about several gen- erations of reformist movements in countries such as Senegal, Nigeria and Zanzibar or on the East African coast. These movements of reform have seen several stages of development we may describe as a genesis and formative period as well as a stage characterised by the increas- ing popularisation of these movements and their cooperation with some of the colonial and postcolonial administrations. Since the 1980s, a new stage in the development of reformist movements has started and a new generation of reformers has come forward, characterised by a much more distinctive discourse of opposition to the (secular and/or author- itarian) state. This most recent generation of radical Muslim reformers in Northern Nigeria, in Zanzibar as well as Senegal is again connected with 'Northern' sources of inspiration such as the Iranian revolution, the radical branches of the Ikhwdn al-Muslimin or other politically rad- ical organisations of the recent past such as the Jamd'at Isldmiya and their different branches in Pakistan, South Africa, Malaysia, Indonesia, Lebanon and Palestine. Members of these radical movements have often studied at al-Azhar, at the Islamic University of Medina in Saudi Arabia, in Pakistan, Sudan or Malaysia, and receive funds from these coun- tries. Recent reformist groups, thus, really seem to stress the struggle against the (secular) state, whereas earlier traditions of reform were often prepared to cooperate, at least in limited terms, with the state. 252</page><page sequence="17">Patterns and Peculiarities of Islamic Reform in Africa 253 Thus, the scholars of the East African 'Alawi tradition of learning, as well as later reformist personalities such as Shaykh al-Amin and Shaykh 'Abdallah Salih al-Farsy, have never actually fought against colonial rule or the post-colonial state, although they might have been critical of some aspects of colonial administration. Rather, they, like their Senegalese and Northern Nigerian counterparts, were always quite willing to work with the colonial as well as post-colonial administra- tion. Cheikh Toure was in fact a Senegalese civil servant until 1978, Abubakar Gumi was Chief Qadi of Northern Nigeria until 1966, while Shaykh al-Amin b. 'Ali al-Mazrfi'i and Shaykh 'Abdallah Salih al-Farsy were employed as Qadis by the colonial and postcolonial administra- tions of Zanzibar and Kenya. Often, these Muslim reformers even sup- ported the strategies of development pursued by the different colonial or postcolonial administrations, in particular when these strategies of development were presented publicly as 'Islamic'. This kind of 'Islamic state reformism', as for example Mamadou Dia's policies of develop- ment in Senegal, was again characterised by its modernising orienta- tion, and was often directed against specific groups of the establishment, for instance, the Sufi brotherhoods, the opponents of the reformers or the opponents of the reformist programmes of the particular adminis- tration. As a result, leading members of Sufi brotherhoods like the late Khalifa Gineral of the Tijaniyya in Senegal, Shaykh 'Abd al-'Aziz Sy, have labelled Muslims reformers who support these policies of mod- ernisation as 'Islamologues fonctionnaries' ('Abd al-'Aziz Sy, Khalifa General of the Tijaniyya in Senegal, in: Wal Fadjri, No. 258, 25.4.1991). The recent anti-government discourse of Islamic reformist groups is connected again, in East Africa, as well as in Senegal and Northern Nigeria, with the specific dynamics of internal/national political devel- opments of these countries. Authoritarian structures of political devel- opment or the monopolising position of ruling parties (in Nigeria the diverse military regimes, in Tanganyika, Zanzibar and Kenya as well as Senegal the political structures dominated by the respective ruling party) usually provide for a good basis of a religiously defined opposi- tion. In addition, the failure of the state to implement policies of devel- opment and to provide for education and social security have supported the development of Muslim movements of opposition which point to the shortcomings of secular regimes. Recent movements of reform have, thus, also acquired a decisively political character that is probably rein- forced by the fact that many representatives of the most recent move- ments of reform have not gone through the established career of Islamic education and have consequently become 'ulamd', but have to be seen rather as products of a modern and essentially western oriented system</page><page sequence="18">254 Roman Loimeier of education. Thus, many leading representatives of recent Muslim reformist movements in Africa are doctors, teachers, bureaucrats, tech- nicians, engineers or natural scientists and consequently define themselves as 'professors' (asadtidha, singular ustddh) and not as 'religious scholars' ('ulama', singular 'dlim). Recent movements of reform also stress 'new' disciplines such as tawhid (dogmatic theology) and tend to de-emphasise established disci- plines of Islamic learning such as fiqh (law), as is shown in many writ- ings of the reformers as well as in the curricula of their schools. The shift to 'new' sciences such as tawhid or language-connected disciplines such as lugha (language), nahw (grammar), sarf (morphology) and so on, has, however, again already been a major feature of the religious dis- course of earlier movements of reform which also tended to emphasise, for instance, the importance of hadith (prophetic traditions) with respect to law (fiqh). Thus, reformers such as Cheikh Toure, Abubakar Gumi and al-Amin b. 'Ali al-Mazrfi' have pointed out the importance of tawhid and hadith, as well as language-related disciplines in their respective writings. The emphasis on 'new disciplines' is connected with the fact that any movement of reform which stresses the importance of the sources of the faith, as well as the example of the Prophet for the renewal (tajdid) of Islamic society, must de-emphasise disciplines linked with post-prophetic developments in Islam, such as iqh (law) or tasawwuf (Sufism). In addition, the religious discourse of the reformers has stressed the struggle against other seemingly 'secondary' disciplines such as fal- safa (philosophy) or 'ilm al-falak (astronomy, astrology) and a series of practices of divination connected with 'ilm al-falak such as numerology which are often depicted, nowadays, as pure superstition or manifesta- tions of (unislamic) veneration of saints. As a consequence, the reformers tend to attack the authority of the established scholars and their role as mediators and interpreters as a feature of pure legalism and blind imitation (taqlid). In order to over- come taqlid, reformers stress again the primacy of the Qur'an as well as of the religious foundations of Islam as described in the dogma of tawhid, while the stress on the language-related disciplines is connected with the conviction that a good mastery of Arabic would enable any Muslim to study the sources of the faith without a mediator. The recent tradition of Islamic reform as represented by the 'professors' is, thus, even more distinctively than older generations of reform, connected with a specific religious discourse characterised by its opposition to any form of spiritualism, in particular, Sufi-inspired forms of saint venera- tion, the celebration of the mawlid an-nabi, the birthday of the Prophet</page><page sequence="19">Patterns and Peculiarities of Islamic Reform in Africa or other forms of 'superstitions' which were usually characterised as bida. This anti-spiritual turn of Islamic reform may even be charac- terised as having a 'secularising' character, in Max Weber's sense of secularisation as a process of 'disenchantment of the world' and a process of gradual rationalisation of religion and society, in which all forms of magic are rejected as superstition (Weber 1920/1988 I: 94/5). The anti-spiritual discourse of the most recent Muslim movements of reform again seems to be not very consistent, as a number of Muslim reform movements have been prepared to discard their anti-Sufi positions in the context of strategic considerations that stress the importance of Muslim unity and the struggle against the oppressive (unislamic) ruler (state). Thus, the radical Islamist movement in Zanzibar, the ansar as- sunna or watu wa bid'a, had cultivated a distinctive anti-Sufi as well as anti-bida' discourse in the 1980s and early 1990s. Since the mid-1990s, however, they have more or less stopped such discourse for the sake of Muslim unity. The same is true for the 'Yan Izala movement in Northern Nigeria and the JIR in Senegal, even when individual members of these organisations still express their aversion to the veneration of saints privately (see Villalon 1995: 219-220). At the same time, recent radical reformist groups also cultivate a moralistic discourse which con- demns imperialism as well as Zionism, Christian mission as well as freemasonry, drug abuse, prostitution and other features of moral decay that, in their eyes, corrupt Muslim society. This discourse is not only directed against 'the West' but also against the political elite of the par- ticular (Muslim) country which is often accused of following blindly policies of westernisation. Recent reformist groups, thus, also often view local Muslim society as jdhil (ignorant, or worse, pre-Islamic) and con- sequently tend to threaten 'deviant' Muslims with takfir (expiation). This element of thought goes back to the Egyptian thinker Sayyid Qutb and his treatise ma'dlim fi-t-tarnq ('Milestones') and has become, for many recent Muslim reformist organisations, a major source of inspiration. However, the moralistic discourse of Islamic reform has also created a new awareness among reformers that specific aspects of Sufi thought, such as the concept of zuhd (asceticism), may bridge the gap between modern traditions of reform and older Sufi-oriented traditions. It is, thus, not surprising that some representatives of original Wahhabi ori- entation have started to turn away from their former mentors on the Arabian peninsula and to try to rediscover Sufi traditions of learning, even when they still maintain that many 'modern' features of Sufism are corrupted by popular practice. Apart from that, it is nowadays not difficult to find reformers who would say that the 'sources' of Sufism 255</page><page sequence="20">Roman Loimezer and the great founding personalities such as Ahmadu Bamba, Usman dan Fodio or Ahmad b. Sumayt 'were different' and basically 'sound ancestors' (see, for instance, in Senegal the journals Le Musulman and Wal Fadjri, in Zanzibar Ma'arifa). The more recent movements of radical reform also seem to have discovered education as an important sphere of competition with other social and religious groups. A major feature in recent concepts of Islamic education is that contemporary reformers, like their predecessors, again stress the importance of the vernacular languages as means of com- munication and religious discourse and support the translation of the holy texts into Kiswahili, Hausa and Wolof. We have, thus, in Senegal as well as in East Africa, in Nigeria as in Mali, an increasing number of texts written in the vernacular language, i.e. Hausa, Fulfulde, Wolof, Bamanan or Kiswahili. With respect to Tanzania and Kenya, Gerard C. van de Bruinhorst was, for instance, able to point out that only thirty percent of the (700) titles he was able to collect in about thirty local bookshops in ten urban centres were still written in Arabic, while approximately fifty percent were written in Kiswahili and an astonish- ing twenty percent in English (van de Bruinhorst 2001: 6). 'Abdallah Salih al-Farsy has even stressed, in a text translated byJusto Lacunza- Balda, that 'Islam does not want colonialism in religion. Arabic is not at all necessary (Uislamu hautaki Istimaari wa dini. Si lazima lughaya Kiarabu)' (quoted in Lacunza-Balda 1993: 233). The endeavours of Muslim reformers such as Sidi Khali L6 (a major leader of the JIR in Senegal), Ibrahim Sulaiman (a major representa- tive of the Muslim Student Society in Nigeria) or Shaykh Sa'id Musa (the director of the Simbom Centre for the Propagation of Islam in Dar es-Salam, who has written more than 200 texts in Kiswahili), to pop- ularise and also implicitly to commercialise religious discourses and knowledge is, however, not confined to texts but may be observed also with respect to other media such as public or semi-public sermons, cas- settes and videos, radio and TV programmes, internet discussions in African and even non-African languages such as French and English (for the role of modern media in religious discourse in Mali see, for example, Schulz 2003). The efforts of the Muslim reformers to trans- late classical and 'sacred' Arabic texts into vernacular languages, to popularise religious knowledge and to enlarge, in this way, the popu- lar basis for issues of reform, as well as to offer each Muslim capable of reading an individual and autonomous access to the sources of the faith, have created the basis for a new interpretation and understand- ing of the faith. Today, the mediation of the established 'ulama' is 256</page><page sequence="21">Patterns and Peculiarities of Islamic Reform in Africa increasingly becoming superfluous, a development which is going to influence their future social role and position in society considerably. Yet, this development of popularisation of texts is, again, not really new to African Muslim societies: texts in Fulfulde and Hausa had been written in Northern Nigeria already in the context of the Sokoto jihad and texts in Kiswahili are recorded, for the East African coast, at least for the 18th century. What is new, however, is the size and volume of this movement of popularisation of (sacred) texts, or, in abstract terms, of the 'sacred' as such. A final major feature of recent Muslim movements of reform in Africa seems to be their efforts to develop new forms of social organ- isation, not only with respect to the role of women in society (see, for instance the development of FOMWAN, the Federation of Muslim Women's Associations in Nigeria, in Bosaller and Loimeier 1995), but also with respect to features of everyday life such as sports and the general organisation of leisure time. Thus, virtually every major madrasa in Zanzibar is today home to a football team of its own and the foot- ball team of Zanzibar's biggest reformist madrasa, the madrasat an-nur, already won Zanzibar's first league national football championship in the 1990s (Penrad 1998: 318). Football is also a major feature of the social organisation of the reformist movement on the Kenyan coast, in particular Lamu, where the local Sufi brotherhoods have, however, quickly reacted by setting up teams of their own. The same is true for Northern Nigeria, where the 'Yan Izala have encouraged the formation of football teams and managed to gain a foothold in the old city of Kano, until recently controlled by the scholars of the Qadiriyya as well as Tijaniyya Sufi brotherhoods, to the extent that many young people rather tend to take part in the activities of the football clubs than to attend the dhikr-groups of the Sufi shaykhs (see Haruna and Abdullahi 1991). And although football may not be a major topic for Senegalese reformist organisations, they cultivated their own forms of social organ- isation by setting up 'reformist' theatre groups in the 1950s, and by actively supporting the organisation of scouting activities. Holiday camps and scouting have thus become, today, major features of the social pro- gramme of the Jamd'at 'Ibdd ar-Rahmdn. These efforts to restructure social activity, social space as well as to organise time, in particular, leisure time, have also already been features of earlier Muslim reformist organ- isations and have been advocated by the Algerian Jamd'at al-'Ulamd' al-Jazd'iriyzin in the 1930s and 1940s as well as the Egyptian Ikhwdn al-Muslimizn. The third annual conference of the Ikhwan al-Muslimin in 257</page><page sequence="22">Roman Loimeier 1935, for instance, actively supported athletic training, and later, scout- ing, as an essential feature of social organisation. The major slogan of the Ikhwan al-Muslimizn even defined the movement as 'a Salafiyya mes- sage, a Sunni way, a Sufi truth, a political organisation, an athletic group, a cultural-educational union, an economic company, and a social idea' (Mitchell 1969/1993: 14/201, emphasis by the author). Conclusion A general resume of our observations with respect to the develop- ment of Muslim reform movements in Africa has to conclude with the almost tautological affirmation that we have, in Africa, a long history of movements of reform or, rather, a history of a number of waves of reform. These waves of reform seem to have been changing their direc- tion again and again: from a Sufi to an anti-Sufi to a mass-movement and popularisation orientation to a political bias. In structural terms, the character of these movements of reform was, however, remarkably similar: reformers tended to argue, thus, in anti-bid'a and anti-spiritual terms, while they advocated (modern Islamic) education and the imple- mentation of a moralistic system of Islamic norms. At the same time, reformers also seem to have complained, from wave to wave of reform, about structurally similar issues, such as the superstitious beliefs of the population, their ignorance and their indulgence in seemingly uneco- nomic expenditures for popular festivities. From wave to wave of reform, only little seems to have changed in the character of Muslim societies, but this impression results from a short-range historical perspective on Muslim society. Over a long period of analysis, the 19th and 20th cen- turies, we would see some rather fundamental changes in the charac- ter of Muslim society in Africa that are connected with the gradual intensification as well as the cumulative impact of reformist endeavours and achievements in the 19th, and particularly the 20th century. The analysis of these reform movements forces us, however, to accept that this history of reform is again rather complex and ambiguous. Thus, it is necessary to: 1. differentiate between regions that have a long tradition of Islamisation (such as Northern Nigeria, Senegal and Zanzibar), and areas which have become Muslim (at least in parts) only fairly recently (such as Burkina Faso, Ghana, mainland Tanzania and up-country Kenya). Also, it is necessary to distinguish between regions where Muslims form a more or less clear majority of the population (such as Senegal, 258</page><page sequence="23">Patterns and Peculiarities of Islamic Reform in Africa 259 Mauritania, Zanzibar or Northern Nigeria) and regions where Muslims represent only a minority of the population. This minority may again be integrated into the respective national society (such as Ghana) or be in a marginalised position (such as Ivory Coast). Muslim minori- ties may also be in a strong and respected (South Africa) or weak position (Kenya) with respect to national politics. 2. It is necessary to make a difference between regions that may point to a long tradition of Sufism and regions where Sufi brotherhoods have never played a decisive or important social, political or reli- gious role in the development of Muslim society. 3. At the same time, we have different speeds in the development of Muslim reformist movements. Thus, we have regions with a long tradition of reformism, such as Zanzibar, where reformist thought and reformist positions have gone through several stages of devel- opment and we have other regions where Muslim reformism is either an isolated or rather recent and/or weak phenomenon. 4. It is also important to see that something like a unified, homoge- nous Muslim movement of reform does not exist. Rather, we encounter a large spectrum of different expressions of reformism (and have to add that ideas of 'reform' are again not confined to 'reformist' groups proper, but may be found among Sufi brotherhoods as well). Thus, we encounter Muslim reformist groups willing to cooperate with Sufi brotherhoods or, at least some of them, for a limited period of time. Yet, there are other reformist groups that reject such a cooperation with Sufi groups (and vice versa). 5. In addition, it is necessary to accept that there are differences and antagonisms among the reformist groups themselves. They compete with each other as well as with other Muslims on issues of Deutungs- hegemonie, the power to interpret and define questions of everyday life as well as religion (or politics) in a specific Muslim community. 6. Finally, it is essential to pay attention to the policies of the different administrations with respect to Muslim reformist movements as well as Islam in general. Thus, we have (colonial as well as post-colonial) administrations willing to support specific forms of Muslim reform and even to instrumentalise Muslim reformist movements for their own politics of reform. On the other side, we also have administra- tions that were prepared merely to tolerate Muslim reformist move- ments or try to marginalise any form of Muslim reformism. All these different positions of the State have influenced and still influence positions and strategies as well as the development of Muslim reformist movements as well as the biography of Muslim reformers.</page><page sequence="24">260 Roman Loimeier Inevitably, these frame conditions change all the time and the devel- opment of Muslim reformism is intrinsically connected with respective local frame conditions. Still, there are a number of traits which man- ifest structural similarities with respect to the development of Muslim reformist movements in Africa. Thus, most contemporary Muslim reformist movements try to find and cultivate a proper place for Muslims in present-day African societies which would give Muslims the chance to lead a life according to the prescriptions of the faith in a world characterised by rapid modernisation, industrialisation, urbanisation, and, in the eyes of many Muslims, westernisation. The responses of many Muslim reformist movements to these social and economic changes are again manifold and necessarily ambiguous. Yet, they seem to point to a new understanding of 'Islam' and society as well as the faith. This new understanding and interpretation of society and religion stresses the position of the individual and his/her right to interpret, indepen- dently and in an autonomous way, the sources of the faith as well as his/her right to define or redefine social space, gender relations, time and so on, and to reject established authorities and mediators as well as institutions. The responses of the Muslim reformist movements are, in addition, characterised by the stress they put on translation and pop- ularisation of (sacred) texts as well their moralistic and often 'puritanical' discourses which are directed against the manifold features of disrup- tion of life connected with the general process of social change. Finally, reformist movements oppose many features of popular ritual, attack 'superstitions' such as the veneration of saints or the trade in amulets and other forms and manifestations of alleged bida' and represent, thus, a de-mystifying trend in religion. When we accept, now, a longue duree perspective of Islamic reform in Africa and look at processes of reform from a phenomenological as well as chronological perspective, we may indeed talk about a new dimension of Muslim reform in Africa and come to the conclusion that these movements of social and religious protest represent a dimension of 'reform' which could be described as having an almost 'Protestant' quality, or better, in French, 'une qualit&amp; protestantisante', as these movements of reform seem to have a number of, yet not all, the struc- tural features that were characteristic for European Protestant reform in the 15th and 16th centuries, or, as Bjorn Olav Utvik has stressed, with respect to Middle Eastern traditions of reform: Islamism is the product of Middle Eastern societies undergoing rapid social change on a comprehensive scale; change of a kind that started much earlier in Europe, and was well under way in England already by the time of Cromwell. In both</page><page sequence="25">Patterns and Peculiarities of Islamic Reform in Africa cases processes of urbanisation, commercialisation, and to a certain extent indus- trialisation were cutting large groups loose from their traditional position and from the social control of their traditional environment. At the same time the growth of a centralised state bureaucracy and increased literacy connected with expanded education, were increasing the strain on old parochial social and political loyalties and creating new social groups with an increased awareness. These changes are usually seen as central features of the transition from tradi- tional to moder society in Europe. Without backsliding into obsolete theories of universal stages of development that all societies must pass through, and without postulating that the Middle East (or subsaharan Africa, emphasis by the author) will be like Europe today, it seems fair to assume that similar processes might pro- duce social movements sharing important traits (Utvik 1997: 131).
