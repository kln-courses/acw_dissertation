<plain_text><page sequence="1">271 Art. IX.? The Initiative of the Avesta. By the Rev. Professor Mills, D.D. I have announced as my subject in these introductory lectures! the general relation of the Avesta to other systems of theology and philosophy. And I have especially mentioned its interest for Biblical criticism, because a re lation, or a supposed relation, between the Avesta and Exilic and post-Exilic books of the Old Testament has been notorious for half a century. We cannot, however, so well judge of the relation between the Scriptures and the Avesta until we know to some further extent what each of them is in its relation to other creeds; and, as is usual in similar cases, our knowledge as to each grows with our knowledge of the other, the stones on ono side of the arch supporting those opposite We do not yet know the Avesta in all its analogies until we know more of the Bible, and we can hardly be said to be fit to expound the Bible with ultimate opinions, until we can answer conscientiously the question as to how closely it may have been connected with the lore of the Avesta, or with some older system, out of which certain features in both the Avesta and the Exilic scriptures sprang. If this supposed original faith were the only subject under discussion its examination would be very desirable indeed ; how much more worthy of investigation that sister lore of 1 This article was read as curtailed on October 20th last, at the Indian Institute iu Oxford, as an inaugural to the Professorship of Zend Philology in the University.

But in order to approach this part of the entire theme, it is naturally necessary to examine beforehand what it really is as regards those particulars where its connection with other systems becomes of special interest. I proceed to state the items in a synoptic manner,1 quite unadorned, pausing only to say that a relation between the Avesta and any other literature may consist in an inherent parallelism without any immediate historical connection; or, again, it may be an analogy which has resulted from an actual external influence; and the first is quite as important as the last, and in some respects more so. The most striking feature in the lore of the ancient Avesta is the advanced intellectual tone of much of its terminology. We take up the documents which originated, as we believe, in ancient Bactria, or slightly to the north west of it, and some 700 (?) to 1,200 years n.c.2 We open the texts, and what do we find in a book originating from such a place and at such a time P The locality had long been settled indeed, but we naturally suppose it to have been rough in its social and political features. At the very beginning of the Gathas, however, we see expressions which may be fairly said to be technical in a philosophical -religious sense: they are such as "the bodily life and the mental"; and "in thought, in word, and in deed" as the lines for the analyses of character, " the laws by which at the first this world into being entered," etc. This terminology, if recurring only rarely in these especial forms, is yet of very great exegeticai importance, for it controls the exegesis of the Giithas as to some capital particulars; it shows that we should expect the more subtle and less realistic idea in various places throughout 1 And I would remind the reader that this present writiug is merely a popular delineation. a It hcing universally difficult to fix more closely tho dates of such documents ; compare the differences in opinion as to the age of Homer, of the Rig Veda, etc.</page><page sequence="3">THE INITIATIVE OF THE AVESTA. 273 them, whereas we should be in doubt as to the existence of these ideas in very many passages were it not for these remarkable, if somewhat widely separated, occur rences. And they are, of course, important to a history of intellectual development, as showing a capacity to define conceptions in this refined manner at a time prior to other attempts, aud in a place and under circumstances amidst which one might least expect to find such a state of things. Where in all the then extant literature of which we have any certain knowledge can such penetrating distinctions be found ? It is generally conceded that Zarathushtra antedated the earliest of the speculative Greeks who philosophised at all on his lines;l and if ancient Iran was not as bereft of intellectual culture as we naturally suppose it to have been, the possibility that it was not thus untutored is only shown by this very terminology and the other related characteristics. Here, then, is a hegemouy in intellect as to this particular, so far as I can see. If there were not a mechanical historical priority, so to speak, in the actual dates of the enouncement of these distinctions and all that they implied, then there was indeed a rational priority, if not an actual isolation, in the appearance of such an advanced development as arising out of such apparently unpromising antecedents, and main taining itself in despite of the still persisting concomitant circumstances. Unless we deny that the Rig Veda is closely related to the Avesta (so that they belong almost together in such a discussion as this), where do we find such a refined system arising out of an unknown abyss, and where in the early Rk itself do we find such astonishing discriminations P Also, the altogether remarkable grouping of those abstract names which afterwards became the Ameshaspends, although loosely traceable in the Rig Veda, is a proof of the advanced development. Imagine a people almost in Middle Asia, whose gods were Benevolence, 1 Putting the death of Ileraclitus at 470-478 b.c. j.u.a.s. 1899. 18</page><page sequence="4">274 THE INITIATIVE OF THE AVESTA. Justice, Government, Devotion, Healthful Weal, and Death less Long-life; ? the words speak for themselves ? what a public there must have been in early Iran to make such terms possible. And if these distinctions marked an epoch in the history of thought, how much more do they mark an epoch in the history of religious, or philosophical religious, thought. Take their chief feature, dualism. Whether they were anterior, posterior, or contemporaneous with certain parts of the Rig Veda, they show a startling advance upon the state of theological opinion as to this subject which prevails in those richly poetical productions. The mixed elements in the recognized characters of deities have all been sifted out. Nothing at all corresponding either to an Indian Iudra or a Greek Hercules (or Zeus for the matter of that) is any longer visible in the Gathas. Ahura Mazda is a spiritual God (in the Gathas) even more bereft of anthropomorphic paganism than the early Jewish Yahveh in some of His manifestations. All con ceivable good is gathered and centred in Him (the Good God), Ahura, and all conceivable evil is gathered in Angra Mainyu; a polarity of thought becomes pronounced; and the most marked theological dualism which has ever been formulated presents itself: the Good God could not prevent the evolution of evil characteristics in the beings whom He created, nor could the evil force prevent the evolution of what is good. Surely this was no trivial phenomenon. It seems to mc to have been eminently important and decidedly hard headed. It gathered up all those elements of dualism which had been recognized in all religions previously, and which have been recognized in other religions ever since. Even our Christianity must acknowledge that the possibility of evil inheres in the possibility of good, it being incon ceivable that God Himself could have made a world without it; it is the most commonplace of questions. But no one had at any previous period of time pretended to state its chief condition so bluntly as Zarathushtra. Instead of saying, with a contradiction in terminology, " there is an</page><page sequence="5">THE INITIATIVE OF THE AVESTA. 275 Almighty God who was powerless to create a universe without sin," he simply cut the matter short; there was no such being (so he thought) in such a sense almighty that He could have undone the fundamental laws of morals and of anterior logic (in the Hegelian sense). If a supreme God could have avoided the toleration of misery in the existing universe, it is difficult to see how He could have been good if He had not in fact so avoided it. There was a 'limit* in the very nature of things which made unmixed prosperity an impossibilityl as well as un alterable holiness. The texts do not go into the details which I have mentioned, but there were two great limited forces, and they are described naturally enough (after the fashion of the time) as personal: " There were two original spirits."2 " Thus are the spirits primeval who as twain by their deeds are famed; In thought, iu word, and in deed, a better they two and an evil. Of these let tho wise choose aright; choose ye not as the evil-minded ! "Then those spirits, created as first they two came together, Life and non-life, decreeing how all at the last shall be, ordered; The worst life, at last, of the wicked, but to the righteous the better mind." Then cf. Y., xlv, 1: " Thus forth I announcing speak this life's first two spirits, Of whom the more bounteous thus the evil accosted: 1 Never our thoughts, nor creeds, nor understandings; Never our beliefs, nor words, nor yet our actions, Nor can our souls, or faiths, ever be one !'"3 1 It could not he defined and so ' perceived.1 2 Of. Y., xxx, 3. 3 A repudiation par eminence.</page><page sequence="6">276 THE INITIATIVE OF THE AVESTA. The ' mixture' was abhorrent to their keen logic, and the word became later a terra of derision. Whether true or false, and as much so if true as if false, the doctrine was important. Somebody had to propose it, and no-one at that period had ever dreamed of stating it so boldly, nor has any analogous suggestion been put in clearer light. But the speculative interest is surpassed by the moral. If we could trust our selves to a literal translation of the Gathas, we should bo quite astounded at the singular depth of their tone, considering their age, or, we might almost say, without any particular consideration either as to their age or circumstances. The literal words express almost the enthusiasm of a re ligious brotherhood, and they have been considered the most marked productions of antiquity in this respect aside from our Semitic scriptures.1 Those who from want of knowledge care less for them have betrayed their own sense of their extraordinary moral elevation by finding fault with its recurring expression; yet this is exactly that which we should recognise as a priceless quality, even if it were produced at the total sacrifice of rhetorical animation. It is, however, true that this vivacity cannot be given up, and for a curious reason. Strange as it may appear, in one light fortunately and in another unfortunately, we arc not always permitted to accept the plain recurring words in their first and obvious sense. If we were we should be well content to accept even a far larger measure of iteration than that which some superficial observers object to in these hymns, for we should have the words ' holiness,' ' benevolence/ ' ruling power,' and ' devotion' recurring at every turn with a resulting effect so remarkable as to recoup us for the surrender of every claim to rhetorical point and life; but unhappily (or happily) we cannot lay claim to tlio right to render the words always exactly in their natural meaning. Facts show that the clear terms may sometimes be taken in a realistic sense, as referring to persons or to the commuuity, although their literal meaning includes no 1 See the Critical Review, Jan., 1896.</page><page sequence="7">THE INITIATIVE OF THE AVESTA. 277 such idea; and it is our ungrateful task to try to break down their supreme morality, gaining therefore more historical detail. We must do all that it is possible for us to do to show that the terms do not always convey an actual meaning which corresponds to their literal force; and just in so far as we can give them an application to the scenes of tho contemporaneous experience, just in so far wo gain brightness of colour to our picture, while we sacrifice to a corresponding degree tho depth of the thought. And we can indeed make out that the composer was at times talking of men when wc had thought that he was talking of principles, of tho Htato when wc had thought that he was talking of holiness. But our victory is very far from being complete ; for believe as we may that he often used the name of a principle, such as the c good mind/ ' righteousness/ ' devotion/ or ' rule/ to designate certain good men, holy communities, devoted partisans, or govern ment officials, we can yet never get rid of the deep sentiment which pervades the whole; for the good ' men' were only alluded to as constituent members of a sanctified community, dear to Zoroaster as holy church is to a Catholic, and the enthusiasm for a holy race was a passion deep as the Jewish, because it could save the soul. To illustrate for a moment. If he spoke of holiness and meant by it the church, it was of course only the church as an ' embodied holiness' (which, wonderful to say, was one of his own expressions). If he spoke of the ' good mind' and meant by it tho ' good man/ it was because the individual member of a beneficent community was, after all, the only object in which a sane benevolence became real ; if he spoke of tho ' ruling power' and meant by it (as we indeed often do) the administration, or the army, it was because he viewed authority as the inexorable condition of prosperity, national or individual, spiritual, moral, and material, and because it was only made actual in the executive of his religious nation; and so of the other sometimes personified ideas. After all our iconoclasm these concepts remain what they have been declared to be, and</page><page sequence="8">278 THE INITIATIVE OF THE AVESTA. that is pre-eminent in the history of the moral sense, so far as we know of that history up to their approximately estimated date. As the embodiment of the great moral ideas in different representative classes or individuals among the community by no means eliminates the moral force from them, neither does their full supranatural personification in sub-gods or archangelio beings extinguish the vitality of the principle, though hypostatisation iu my opinion introduces a lower stage. And as a technical phenomenon, this personification of the main ideas of Zoroastrianism seems also to mark an era in religious mental development, and I might indeed have touched upon it while dwelling upon the speculative interest, but its place is on the whole here, as it involves a strong moral element. Of course, a quasi-personification of similar abstracts appears often in the ltk of the Veda, and we may safely admit (or indeed claim) that wherever the mental habit became set toward the poetical personification of religious principles, an analogous development took place; but where do we find it so clearly defined as in the Avesta P Ahura addresses Asha, tho ' personified holiness of the law/ and "Asha to Him makes answer." The saint prays, " 0 Asha, when shall I see thee P" and the same of the Good Mind. Araraaiti, the ready mind of devoted zeal, is likewise addressed in the vocative, and she is termed Ahura's daughter, while all the leading four are bidden to listen and to come: " Ye, the most bounteous Mazda Ahura, and Piety with Him, And Asha the settlement furthering, thou Good Mind, and thou the Dominion, Hear ye me, all, and have mercy for all deeds which I do whatsoever." In the later Avesta the personification of these powers or attributes becomes quite the predominant usage, issuing in one passage of a truly sublime type, where the souls of the seven 'Immortals' are represented as being of the "same</page><page sequence="9">THE INITIATIVE OF THE AVESTA. 279 thought and word and deed, seeing each other thinking of good thoughts and words and deeds; having one father and commander, Ahura Mazda." ! To be sure, a deterioration becomes apparent later on, and it is indeed foreshadowed in the earlier parts of the later Avesta, if not possibly in the Giithas themselves, but this does not alter the curious interest of the circumstance. The thoughts, words, and deeds of the supremo good God are naturally qualified by adverbs; lie speaks with Ilis truth, acts with His benevolence, and rules with His authority ; but how interesting it is in the light of technical philosophical history to see this truth, this benevolence, this authority treated as personal subjects subordinate to Him and yet closely related to Him. The fact that this hypostatisation does not totally emasculate the virility of the ideas, I have already asserted on the same authority which supports us in defending their application to the human individual and to functions among the people. If the Zoroastrian felt that Asha, the holiness of the law, was more actual as holiness when he thought of it as alive within a community who were striving to live up to it, with what emotion must ho have adored an archangelic Being whom he thought existed, and for the purpose of making his holiest ideals real. Surely it must have helped him to love the law better when he believed that there was a mighty spirit close iu the presence of Ahura, whose separate function it was to watch and help ou the universe in obeying that law, and who to this end especially furthered its proclamation and confirmed its influence in populations and within the moral sense of individual men. And so of the Benevolence, Government, and Devoted-zeal. All these noble concepts were the thoughts of God, but as such alone they might have been impaired by confusion in their effect upon our limited receptivity, and each might be lost in the other; the Archangels embodying each of them severally kept them apart for us. They remind us at once of the Greek 1 Yasht, xiii, 83.</page><page sequence="10">280 THE INITIATIVE OF THE AVESTA. logos with the daimones of Plato and the Stoics, and they recall the dynameis of Philo and the aeons of the Gnostics; but the Zoroa8trian development was vastly earlier, for it was closely allied to the Vedic, as I have already hinted. Surely this hypostatisation is a feature of signal value. The personification of mental abstracts appeared in rough Bactria hundreds, or decades at least, of years before an analogous development took place in the most favoured land of the ancient West. We cannot say that the Amcshaspenta were distinctly termed ' emanations' from the Deity; nor can they be said in more theological termiuology to ' proceed' from either a Father or a Son, but that ' truth' with which God speaks ' proceeds' from Him, and when at the next step this truth is called a 'person,' to establish a more obvious means of communication with the Almighty, the resulting ideas constitute something which is indistinguishable in its effect, but not in its motive1 from tho Platonic, Stoic, and Philoniau analoga. As to the practical virtues in social life, it is hardly necessary to particularize. That justice was urged needs not to be asserted, while vindictive retribution is perhaps too emphatically insisted upon. Benevolence has been already mentioned ; either the love of God is expressed or His delighted good wish for us; and it was, of course, to be imitated. Mercy toward enemies cannot be traced, but the Avesta seems to afford the earliest examples of charity to the poor in an organized shape. " Your rule, what is it ? Your riches P how I may be Your own in my actions, Through Righteousness and Thy Good Mind, to nourish Your poor in their sufferings ; Foremost of all we declare You, before Demons and demonised men." Yasna, xxxiv, 9. 1 The motive of the Platonic emanation was the impurity of matter which Odd could not touch without au intermediary, au idea radically opposed to Zoroastiianism.</page><page sequence="11">THE INITIATIVE OF THE AVESTA. 281 " Thine is the Kingdom whence to poor and right-living Thou givest, Lord, better." Yasna, liii, 8. And in Vendldud, xxi, which deals in supranatural imagery, we read of a spiritual heavenly home, which seems especially to exist for tho purpose of combating diseases; and the idea may have been new to literature. Among domestic virtues, respect to parents stood high, for the question is asked at Yasna, xliv, 3, " Who hath made dutiful the son to the father P " Tho bestowal of significant names came into vogue in a manner which reminds of Puritan England or New England. Pouruchista, * the much taught one/ shows how the generation affected pious training; it reminds us also, of course, of uses which were subsequent to original Zoroastrianism, but which as regards us were still early Orientalism. The virtues of home life are beautifully touched upon in the bridal song in Yasna, liii,1 and in correspondence with these moral features in temporal life there was a judgment in store for those who failed in attaining them. "Thus I'll conceive thee, bounteous, Ahura Mazda, As in creation's birth I foremost saw Thee, When deeds, most just, rewarding, and words Thou givest 111 to the evil, pure blessing to the good. By Thy great virtue in this world's last change ! In which last changing Thou a spirit bounteous Comest with Thy Good Mind and Thy Kingdom, Mazda, By deeds of whom the settlements in Right are furthered Laws unto these to teach Armaiti striveth, Laws of Thy holy Realm which none deceives." Yasna, xliii. 1 " Let each one the other devotedly cherish ; so the home shall be happy."</page><page sequence="12">282 THE INITIATIVE OF THE AVESTA. " Who e'er to roe, be he or man or woman, Our tribe's gift gives which Thou as best perceivest, Prize for the holy gives with good men's ruling, Whom praising You I urge as comrade leading, Forth to the Judge's Bridge with all I go." Yasna, xlvi, 10. So in Yasna, xlix, 3? "These give I safest, Lord, in Thy protection, Men living yet, and souls of saints on high ; " and again of the evil? " Then evil rulers, evil doers, speakers, Those believing ill and spirits evil minded, With poisoned food the souls to meet are coming, In Falsehood's home at last their bodies lie." And as quite an astonishing fact these rewards and punish ments are subjective; the retribution is in the soul's own self; compare Yasna, xxxi, 21, where it is said, "This be your world, 0 ye foul; by your deeds your own souls will bring it." " Cursed by their souls and selves, Their being nature, ever in Demon's home their dwelling is." Yasna, xlvi, 11. And to show the continuity of tho doctrine, tho external particulars, which, though scattered, were yet so plainly marked in the Gathas, are preserved and restored in the later but still genuine Avesta. There lost souls come to meet the condemned man as well with poisoned food and reviling words; pleasing features are, however, first detailed. In a passage which has been greatly admired, the man's own conscience comes to meet his soul under the form of a beatified being. The saint is bewildered, and asks, "Who art thouP"; and she answers, "I am thyself; thy good thoughts and words and deeds." The soul, incredulous, like the one in the Gospels, inquires, " Who hath desired thee</page><page sequence="13">THE INITIATIVE OF THE AVESTA. 283 hither with his love?" She answers, "Thou hast called me hither," and 6he recites his good deeds, one of which is, curiously enough, exactly the same as iu St. Matthew: "Thou didst care for the stranger coming from near and from afar."l Fanoy such expressions occurring in remote Iran some centuries before Christ (if only a few), and, as proved from the passages cited, evidently repeating details which had been formulated still earlier! The matter is more fully traced out in the Vendidad,2 where the evil are dragged to Hell, and where Vohu Manah, the Archangel of Benevolence, arises like Christ from his golden throne to meet the saved man, who passes on to endless bliss. We may have had adumbrations of the like, as I suppose, in other ancient religious systems, but to no degree like this; it was a realistic picture frescoed upon the religious imagination. Whether it was (together with other highly coloured delineations as to resurrection, etc.; see below) the original of Daniel's Judgment scene, depicted in what might bo called a Jewish-Persian book, or whether they both pro ceeded from an earlier original, are propositions which can never be definitively proved nor refuted. The golden thrones of the Ameshaspentas recall the thrones of the apostles in the Apocalypse, and in view of the 'consummation' the saints strive with holy emulation to bring on Frashakard, which was the 'restitution of all things.3 Those features in eschatology which have less of the moral point in them are also represented, and perhaps in a manner even more advanced than they are in the New Testament; the righteous dead arise, and enter upon a life 1 "When saw I thee a stranger/' etc., tho soul asks; and the answer is, " Inasmuch as ye did it," etc.?Matt., xxv, 38, 40. 8 Fargard, xix. 3 ' Yea, may be like those who bring on this world's perfection, As the Ahuras of the Lord bearing gifts with Asha's grace, For there are our thoughts abiding where wisdom dwells in her home." Ya$nat xzz, 9.</page><page sequence="14">284 THE INITIATIVE OF THE AVESTA. imaging, without disease, deformity, death, or the evil passions ; they eat imperishable food, etc.1 A question in ethnology of the utmost moment presses itself upon our attention. No one doubts, as I suppose, that the Indian Aryans, tho people who spoke early Sanskrit, once lived with the people who spoke Zend, for tho Aryans went down iuto India through territory named in tho Avesta, or reported by tho Greeks, as being deeply coloured with Zoroastrian associations. It is indeed safest to suppose that the people who worshipped God under the old name of Daevas, and who are so prominent in an evil sense in the Avesta, were only the lingering remnant of the tribesmen whose vanguard had already long since gone south.2 If they were, indeed, no more than a last shred of them, yet the conjunction of circumstances is of rare interest. It is seldom that we see two distinguished ancient peoples, later separated bjf hundreds of miles, in close connection, even if one of them is but a feeble residue; yet it is undoubted, while a possibility conies into view which might be almost regarded as of overpowering moment in such questions. Were these Daeva-worshippers who wore so fiercely fought in the Gathas not a forgotten shred of a people, the masses of whom had long previously migrated to India P; but were they actualty the vanguard of those masses themselves, whose descendants only afterwards reached the Indus, and became the Aryan Hindoos, so that they were not merely their distant cousins lingering at a later day in the north P Their gods were largely the same as those in the Avesta, with the peculiarity that some of the chief ones among them have exchanged their characteristics, being devils in one lore and deities in the other; the languages also in which these details were written were closely cognate. The question arises?were, then, those tribes on the frontier of Iran when the Guthas were first sung, against whom the 1 Yasht, xix, 89, and elsewhere. 2 Centuries earlier. That they were closely connected by ties of kindred with these early emigrants is absolutely certain.</page><page sequence="15">THE INITIATIVE OF THE AVESTA. 285 bloody border wars, which are everywhere so apparent in the Avesta, were directed, actually the fathers of the future Indians P If they were?and no one can say that they certainly were not?we have in the Avesta documents of such importance for ethnology that it is impossible to exaggerate their value in this connection to attest a profoundly impressive episode in the history of races; and the possibility of the fact must for ever hang over the subject. To proceed: apart from ethnology itself, we have an actual history in the Gathas. If my venerated friend Prof. Oppert could give as a title to an exposition of one of the columns of the Behistuu Inscriptions " The People and the Language of the Medes," how much more appropriately might something like that bo the title of the Gathas, with 'Iranians' for 'Medes'! They are as personal as the Psalms, if not, indeed, more so; everything being ' I' and ' Thou,' and the figures of the four chiefs stand out in bold relief. They exhort and pray; now furious at the Daevas-men and anxious over their progress, now in suspense before the encounters, now heart-broken at defeat or jubilant in victory ; while all ends in a political marriage fragment of a characteristic description. I can only repeat what I have said before: l in the Gathas all is sober and real. Grehma and Bendva, the Earpans, the Kavis, the Usiks are no mythical monsters; no dragon threatens the settlements, and no fabulous beings defend them. Zarathushtra, Jamaspa, Frashaoshtra, Maidydmah, the Spitamas, the Hvogvas, the Haechataspas are as real as any other characters in history, and they are mentioned with a simplicity which is as unconscious. Except a possible claim to inspiration there are no miracles; all the action is made up of the exertions and passions of living and suffering men. Lot the Zeudist study the Gathas well, and then let him turn to tho Yashts and tho Vendldad; lie will go from the land of reality to the land of fable. He leaves in one a toiling prophet to meet in the other a phantastic demigod.1 1 See SUE., xxx, Introd., p. xxyL</page><page sequence="16">286 THE INITIATIVE OF THE AVESTA. There are few documents extant which afford indirectly a more genuine portrayal of events. While all annals which make so-called historical assertions are liable to the strongest suspicion (one might almost say that they by their very affirmations make a supposed fact more improbable at once), indications wliich are both indirect and un conscious are, on the contrary, tho sole source of sound conclusions as to the reality of supposed past events. We know from the Gtithas that a little nation in mid Asia were impassioned in their religious convictions, and as refined as the Greeks in their modes of religious thought; that they possessed an organization which aimed at the regulation of agricultural and other forms of industrial civil life; that they were of our Aryan blood; that they were closely related to the Indian Aryans ; that they struggled through border wars with tribes whom they deemed half pagan; that they ultimately founded a branch at least of the great Medo-Persian nation, and spread their religion over vast territories among millions of inhabitants through successive generations; and tho most memorable figure among them bore the name of Zarathushtra. Data in the history of politics are involved in this, and wo have in the Gathas, I believe, for the first time in the Aryan world, a union of Church and State. A contribution to the history of logic is involved in what has been already said at the outset. A history of rhetoric, if one existed, would gain a memorable particular. That such a state of mental culture should have prevailed as could make possible such expressions as " This ask I Thee; aright, Ahura, tell nie," is truly astonishing when we clearly see that they were used with no slightest approach to a foolish belief that God would either physically hear or vocally answer. " This ask I Thee, aright, Ahura, tell me: Who ever earth and sky from falling guarded ; Who hath save Thee brought forth forests and rivers ; Who with the winds hath yoked storm-clouds to racers; Who of the good man's grace ever was source P</page><page sequence="17">HIE INITIATIVE OF THE AVESTA. 287 This ask I Thee; aright, Ahura, tell me: Who with skilled hand the lights | made, who the darkness; Who with wise deed hath giv'n sleep, or our waking; Who hath auroras spread, noontides and midnights, Warning discerning man, duty's true guides ? "l It might have been written yesterday. It is simply certain that tho interrogatives are thoso of rhetoric, though this seems incredible for tho period. The uses of such terms as ' son of Ahura,' ' daughter of Ahura' were more to bo expected. Coming to more technical matter, we have an almost equally interesting item in the matter of metre. I fear we hardly realise the very exceptional nature of this circumstance. The metres of the Big Veda have been sacred and studied for (say) at least two thousand years; some of them are mentioned in the Veda itself, but one of the oldest and most valued of them was found in the Zend Avesta some forty years ago.2 Zend philology has the reputation of being the most difficult of Oriental subjects in an Aryan tongue, as it requires a serious knowledge of several ancient languages. The Pahlavi in which the ancient native commentaries are chiefly written is the most inscrutable of all characters which have been preserved in manuscripts. The Sanskrit of the Yasna translation is also of a peculiar cast, disturbed in the sequence of its words by the fact that it is a rendering of a. rendering, while the Parsi-Persian is as irregular as it is indispensable. No man living has ever yet sounded these ancient expositions to their depths in all parts of their extent, though Spiegel has given us enormous help.3 1 Yusua, xliv, 3 et Rcq. 2 Somo of tho most precious parts of tho Gathas are written in tri*h(npt and others in tri$h(up with the simple addition of a line. ' Since Spiegel'a pioneer attempt no second edition of the Pahlavi translation of the Yasna has appeared outside of the Gathas. Spiegel did the great foundation work here as from tho beginning, but most valuable as his contribution was, having been based upon a single manuscript, it was as of course just in so far limited as a means of permanent assistance, and it is now well-nigh half a century old. So also his very valuable text and partial rendering of Neryosang; it is now, of course, to some degree antiquated, while the exceedingly precious</page><page sequence="18">288 THE INITIATIVE OF THE AVESTA. Very few indeed have ever made the shadow of an attempt to explore these regions, and from among the excessively1 small number of scholars who pretend to be independent experts some of the most prominent have advanced to the highest enterprises of Zend philology with the open statement that they have left these original translations unmastered.8 But lest I should be misunderstood, let me hasten to say that the lore of the Avesta is by no means alone as to this particular. As a simple matter of fact, the human family has not been in a position in which it has been able to support a sufficiently large class of persons fitted and willing to grapple with these nearly endless and too often thankless tasks, and the report which those who have sacrificed themselves sometimes bring in is enough to repel many who might otherwise be both competent and ready. But we must not despair. Slowly and little by little the pioneers are clearing the forests, and the minors aro extracting the ore; while the very mass of the work still left, undone offers an opportunity to enterprising minds, and enough has been discovered to whet the flagging appetite. We need first of all a thoroughly critical edition and explanation of the Asiatic commentaries, and we need translations made only after they have been thoroughly studied. And here I suppose that it is proper for me on this occasion3 to give some general idea of the plan of my own Parsi-Persian rendering, often the key to the Pahlavi, has not been at all repro duced, except in tho Five Zarathushtr'iau Gtithas. Nor does any full aud modem explanation of tho Pahlavi of the Yemlidad exist, while partial translations are of leu silent when we wish them most to speak; and so of the Parsi- Persian version of the Vendidnd. Justi's masterly dictionary, of which Roth could write as the " musterhaft eiugerichtetes zweckmassiges Handbuch," is, of course, now to some degree too old; it was published in 1863, and needs to be supplemented by the labours of scholars who understand alt parts of their business. This is only a part of what needs to be done on the texts of tho Avesta itself, not to speak of tho Pahlavi literature. 1 Who call name more than a very few units P 2 Writing to others to decipher their texts for them, and, as too often in similar cases, with difficulty forgiving their heuefactors for doiug them the favour. 3 Let it be kindly remembered ou what occasion this paper was first read.</page><page sequence="19">THE INITIATIVE OF THE AVESTA. 289 well-meant labours, and of those which I propose for my pupils. Spiegel's bahnbrechend texts, translations, and commentaries were, indeed, a foundation on which any man might be proud to build, though criticised by men who did not know the chief alphabet involved. But my objects were different in kind: Spiegel's work was necessarily spread over an enormous territory; my object was to take a single field and explain every part of it in all its details. So vast had been the lack of labour since Spiegel's main works in this respect, that editors and translators had been, and have been even till to-day, forced to furnish provisional editions and renderings which must for ever bear the mark of liiciiM preparation. I saw, as others did, the astounding gap many years ago. The particular work, as attempted in the only manner in which it ought to have been attempted, had at that date been attempted by nobody living, and nobody was willing to undertake it. It being left wholly unattended to in the manner desired, I set out as an autodact to do what I could toward an exhaustive rendering of the Gathas, with the Asiatic commentaries edited with the collation of all the MSS., and interpreted by that well-nigh endless trans lation and re-translation which their peculiar circumstances required.1 1 See tho " Fivo Zarathushtriatt Giithas," Introduction, p. xiv et sea. I am far from underrating tho very useful suggestions which have been in ado by the pupils of ltoth (for I am of their number). On the contrary, that very great interpreter did an inestimable service (strauge to say) in attempting to read the Gathas (at first only) with a practical disregard of the Asiatic commentaries, even being, as ho told me more than once, without "any experience*' of their chief language (later, however, even writing upon it, in Z.D.M.G.; Zend was with him, let it bo remembered, only a secondary study). H was an indispensable service for some scholar of supreme authority to read the Gathas as pure .Sanskrit (so to spoak), giving us all tlio courage to say that the Pahlavi commentaries are by no means slavishly to ho followed, and great is my own personal indebtedness to him. I understood from him that Hung was his pupil also on tho Zend ; and at the date of JIaug's great work on the Gathas he, too, evideutly had no know ledge of the Pahlavi language, affording, nevertheless, the most valuable preliminary results; but 6uch provisional and tentative expositions should be followed by others attempted only with a mind prepared by exhaustiug the materials. (1 need hardly remind many of my readers that Haug became later a high authority on Pahlavi, giving us discoveries and hints of inestimable value. Roth also, as I have said, later conceded its importance.) j.k.a.8. 1899. 19</page><page sequence="20">290 THE INITIATIVE OF THE AVESTA. It was for this reason that Professor Darmesteter so urgently1 requested mo to take his place in writing the then still needed translation of tho Yasna (which contains the Gathas) in the thirty-first volume of the "Sacred Books of the East." 1 " Tn the hope of a favourable answer." The rcmainiug parts of this note aro in answer to erroneous statements which aro carelessly contradictory to my own printed remarks (see below); these errors have also been given a wide circulation in a publication of an importance of its kind second to none. I gladly take this opportunity to correct them. Iu the preface to the thirty-first volume of the " Sacred Books of tho Enst," f. 5. I had snid: "My work on the Gathas had been for some time in his Professor Darmestetor's] hauds, and he requested me as' a friend to write the still needed volume of the translation.Although deeply appreciating the uudesirablcness of following one whose scholarship is only surpassed by his genius, 1 found myself unable to refuse." Yot there appeared so long afterward as 1895 actually in the Annuaire of the University of Paris the extraordinary remark?" Avec cet oubli de soi (!) qui chnractoriso lo vrai mcrito .... il mln a M. Mills rhomieur d'nehover la publication," and distinctively gave the impression in some other words that I suggested (!) the arrangement. The exclamation points are my own. This very siugular version of the facts lingers iu Paris to contradict me till this day. The renderings afterwards published in my Gathas (let me repeat once for all) were iu Professor Darmesteter's possession in an unfinished condition, though provisionally printed, nnd he wrote poiutcdly asking me to repeat them in the nook which he was urging me to write as liis con ti nun lor: " Vous n*avez qu'a. detacher de votre travail [the Gathas] la traduction rhythntiquc avec quelqucs notes explicatives et le mot-u-mot [Latin] quand vous en e*cartcz trop.

(Nov. 5, 1883, some sixteen years ago.J I was also so fortunate as to be of servico to other distinguished persons; ami a somewhat similar occurrence forces me to allude to it to explain to students of Zend who may be using certain books aud may wonder why they do not see my name in them. This time it was gentlemen on the other side of the Rhino whom I was able to help. But, unlike my great colleague, these beneficiaries, to whom I had extended assistance immeasurably greater than acts of decipher ment, resorted to the strauge policy of total silence, combining together to omit all mention of my name m some books bearing ou this subject (a course which is considered among scholars oue of the most aggravated forms of indignity which it is possible to devise). Darmcstcter could speak iu noble terms of thankfulness with Pischel and Justi, and that not in private comniuuications but in leading publications: see tho Qbtt. gelehr. Am. of May 13, 1893 ; liame Critique of Sept. 18, 1893 ; Z.D.M.G., July, 1896 ; etc., etc. Put what will au honourable public say of professed old friends, who had received the closest form of personal leaching by long proviously advanced copies of an unpublished pioneer work, put often at tlieir own request gratuitously mto their hands, and then combining to boycott the scholar who had taught thorn their rudiments. And this is the explanation of a fact noticed as curious by a very distinguished friend of all Zendists in the London Daily Telegraph of August 10, 1894. h ortunately the circumstance has been as harmless as it was contemptible. My sole otfenee, I need hardly say, consisted in the original treatment of things hitherto unattempted, and the very stroug expressions of recognition which followed them. Though I was warned by Darmestcter of the fate of all pioneers, nnd though the actual result has beeu favourable beyond measure, yet one cannot forget the stiug of a degraded ingratitude.</page><page sequence="21">THE INITIATIVE OF THE AVESTA. 291 And if life be spared I must continue on with precisely this same plan so long since adopted, and produce an exhaustive treatment of the rest of the Avesta. As Professor Pischel was so kind as to say, my procedure (after a work of 650 pages) includes a dictionary.1 A large fraction of this is at this moment in type, and I hope soon to offer the University a first section of it, to be followed by others without interruption, save such as may temporarily take place from the pressure of inevitable duties. Side by side with this effort I hope to progress with a preliminary treatment of the Pahlavi Sanskrit and Persian texts of other parts of the Yasna and Vend id ad on the plan mentioned. I should also report that I seem to have secured a serious adhesion in reference to some reforming suggestions as to the decipherment of the Zend alphabet itself as distinguished from that of the Pahlavi. A somewhat full article which appeared in the last (October) Heft of the Zeitschrift of the German Oriental Society engaged the acquiescent sympathy of certain distinguished scholars who saw it in manuscript before its publication, and this I regard as important in view of the new matter suggested. If but one-half of what specialists report as to tho el emeu ts of interest involved in the study of it be in fact the truth, many who have no time to enter into the professional details of this laborious speciality will greally desire to acquire a general view of it based upon the solid results already attained. For the benefit of such persons let me say what indeed will seem to them somewhat unaccountable: it is that the extraordinary difficulties of the Gathas have reference largely to technical detail. Just that which makes them most difficult to advanced experts, viz., their sparse expression, makes them to a certain degree all the more accessible to one who values them chiefly for 1 Mills' "Werk, das ergcbnks langjahriger Miihc und entsagungsvollcr Arbeit, vereiuigt bis auf ein Worterbuch das in Aussicht gestellt wird, alios was fur die Erklarung der G&amp;thas nothwondig ist . . . .

Incredible as it may appear to a novice, some of the most difficult strophes in the Gathas (that is to say, some of the most difficult to those who exact an absolute certainty as to the precise literary point of the detailed sentences) are made up of words of the simplest description, so that the translation of the actual terms of the greater part of the strophes into the cognate Sanskrit possesses no difficulty at all;! and even word-for word imitations in Latin can often vary from each other only in the choice of synonyms. An acquisition of a knowledge of the consecutive terras is, with the exception of inscrutable forms here and there, by no means a very intricate undertaking, and these literal terras convey what Biblical students most admire, viz., the depth of the moral sentiment and the height of its fervour. We might even leave all the more difficult words untranslated, indicating the spaces whioh their rendering would occupy by blanks, and very much of great importance would be left; indeed, it would not be too much to say that the most of what we value them for would still be preserved. One reason for this state of things has been already stated: great difficulties may occur on a part of a strophe which bears on ideas of a secondary or qualifying importance (to the general theme). But these differences in opinion as to exegesis are also robbed of their fatal severity by that cause to which I have already alluded, but which I will now state again in a new form, aud draw from it a vitally important conclusion. It was this, as expanded (see above on p. 277) : one of two, three, or even four slightly or flagrantly differing renderings, as is usual in similar cases, may be the correct one; but, what is seldom indeed the case, not one of the two, three, or four varying views, grossly as they may differ, can possibly avoid expressing what we most value in our researches. If the c good mind' when meaning the f good man' has that sense only with a full inclusion of all that the good 1 See Roth's " Festgruss," p. 192.</page><page sequence="23">THE INITIATIVE OF THE AVESTA. 293 mind meant in the Gathas (see above) ? if Asha never meant the 'church9 in them without a solemn reference to the 'law* which the church embodied, etc. (see above on page 277)?why, then, the terminology absolutely shuts out the purely commonplace sense (almost, if not quite, totally) everywhere, and it shuts in the expression of moral and religious depth.1 I am the first Professor who has taught on Zend philology in Oxford since Thomas Hyde expounded such parts of it as had been then discovered in the year 1700.2 That the subject should have been so long neglected is, indeed, to be regretted; and it is to be hoped that we may pursue it now with vigour. As is implied in what I have already said, the first duty of an accredited specialist on such a subject is to contribute toward its completion as a legitimate branch of science, and this can only be done by printed books. Knowledge which is locked up in a single memory has but a precarious tenure; and becomes also exaggerated in public estimation. It must, moreover, perish with the life of its possessor. Every specialist on such a subject as Zend philology is, or should be, well-nigh overwhelmed with labour, all of which must ultimately come to press. I offer, of course, no exception to this rule, and I cheerfully give the rest of my life under the providence of God to this duty. I will close by citing the remark of a respected writer in the Critical Review of January, 1896: " The Gathas, or 1 Surely to many of us it is (for instance) of inferior importance whether a sentence means ' finding tbe way to God' or ' finding His throne '; the ' way' must lend to the * throne,' and ' the throne' is found by ' the way'; and yr.t this uncertainty occurs iu a passage of the utmost difficulty, where a positive decision is almost impoHsihle. 2 It was in this year that he published his "Ilistoria Religion is Vetcrum Pcrsarum."
