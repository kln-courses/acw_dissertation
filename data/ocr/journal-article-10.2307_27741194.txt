<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOS? MORENO VILLA, THE "RESIDENCIA," AND JACINTA LA PELIRROJA SALVADOR J. FAJARDO State University of New York, Binghamton University Jos? Moreno Villa (1887-1955), perhaps because he did not join ranks with either the generation of'27 or the generation of'98, seems to have wandered off the edges of our critical horizon. Moreno VUla was neither a "modernista" nor an "Ultraista"; he knew cubism well and responded to surrealism but remained always his own man, a spectator of the world around him and, one at times feels, of himself. For Guillermo de Torre, Moreno Villa's poetry marks a conclusion: "Se?alaba ... el cierre o liquidaci?n del almac?n modernista" (512). Luis Cernuda finds in his early poetry, though in a very subtle, inteUectual key, some anticipations of the folkloric vein that Lorca and Alberti were to develop later: "Lo curioso en el caso de Moreno Villa es que siendo un poeta nada f?cil, ni colorista ni andalucista, sabe infundir a su visi?n y a su expresi?n la espontaneidad graciosa del folklore andaluz" (125). In my comments on Moreno Villa's Jacinta la pelirroja, I want to relate the collection both to its vanguardist milieu and to the poet's personality, in particular his sense of the transitoriness of existence. This feeling of "interinidad"?as he would term it?pervades the compositions o? Jacinta. ... It is also related to his desire to capture the instant in time through the frequent use of ekphrasis, the verbal equivalent of his activity as a painter. Moreno Villa's early collections, Garba (1913), El pasajero (1914), Luchas de pena y alegr?a (1915) show a preference for the landscapes 67</page><page sequence="2">68 ALEC, 19 (1994) and topics of Southern Spain. Evoluciones (1918) is a rather heteroge neous collection, transitional toward the stronger, sober voice that would mark his later poetry, and which begins to be felt in Colecci?n (1924).2 The evolution begun in Colecci?n culminates with Jacinta la pelirroja (1929) which is composed according to the most advanced poetics of the day. Subsequent to Jacinta . . . and until his departure from Spain, Moreno Villa moved in the direction of surrealism, beginning with Carambas (1931), which he describes as "escritas dejando [se] llevar por la fuga de ideas" (Vida en claro 158). Puentes que no acaban (1933) and Sal?n sin muros (1936) also belong to the poet's surrealist stage. Moreno Villa continued to publish poetry during his exile in Mexico; these collections (Puerta severa [1941], La noche del verbo [1942]) address the concerns of the 'desterrado' as well as those elicited by his love for his new family (he married in Mexico). In order to locate the work of Moreno Villa properly in its moment, it is necessary to reconsider some received notions on the poetic movements of the period. An efficacious way to break the hold of traditional classifications is to situate the various moments of Spanish literature (and poetry in particular) within a broad European, or Western, context: in this sense "Modernismo"?I am thinking of Salvador Rueda and Manuel Reina, as well as of Rub?n Dar?o and Jos? Mart??is simply a version of Symbolism and has little to do with what is today generally understood as "modernism." The latter actually takes form in Spain under the impact of the "vanguardia," a period that would begin with G?mez de la Serna's introduction of Futurismo through his translations of Marinetti in the review Prometeo, in 1910, and end with the last numbers of Gim?nez Caballero's Gaceta Literaria in 1931. In its impact the avant-garde represents an artistic and cultural revolution that can only be compared to Romanticism, and it is to Futurism that we owe the initial, and in some respects the most powerful, impulse in the revolution. It was partly through Futurism that the hold of "Modernismo" was broken, and that "modernism" entered the Peninsula. Futurism proposed an unremitting attack on the romantic-symbolist tradition on all fronts: through the d?structuration of language (attack on syntax) and the resulting dislocation of poetic rhetoric; through the promotion of illogicallity and the introduction of the unintelligible?as Marinetti said, poets should "rinunciare ad esseri compresi" (Aull?n de Haro 106)?; through the unavoidable distancing from a wider public that such radical practices would entail. Poetic expression must be broken apart, typographical disposition freed: artistic writing must become both autonomous and self-aware. Another notion introduced by Futurism is that of the "internationalism" of poetry, something which in Spain was truly needed.</page><page sequence="3">SALVADOR J. FAJARDO 69 In fact, Futurism remained for almost two decades the most innovative and striking poetics of the "vanguardia." It is at the origins of cubism in poetry as well as of dadaism, of "creacionismo" in Hispanic letters, and ultimately of Surrealism. These vanguardist movements, though they took for the most part an ideological direction diametrically opposed to Futurism's rightist tendencies, assumed many of its technical innovations. It seems clear that if we see the development of pre-Civil War poetry in terms of a wider modernism, we may break the habit of concentrating on the so-called generation of'27 and open the door to other important modernist poets. Many of the poets of the "vanguardia" have been overshadowed by those of the generation of'27 who, if at times superior in their achievement, are not in all regards more interesting. Jos? Moreno Villa is precisely one of these individuals. He was often referred to by better known poets and major intellectual figures of the time as an important presence and was ahead of most of his contemporaries in his understanding and application of vanguardist poetics. He displays an imaginative grasp of such poetics in Jacinta la pelirroja, one of the most fascinating books of poetry in a decade that saw the appearance of such major collections as Salinas's Presagios and Seguro azar, Lorca's Romancero gitano and Poema del cante jondo, Alberti's Cal y canto and Sobre los ?ngeles, Cernuda's Un r?o, un amor, and Aleixandre's Pasi?n de la tierra. Born in 1887 in M?laga, to an upper middle class family of wine merchants, Jos? Moreno Villa was at first guided toward the sciences by his family's expectations and went to Germany to study chemistry. There, however, he became interested mostly in literature, philosophy, and art. He returned to M?laga with no specific plans except for the certainty that neither chemistry nor the wine business held any attraction for him. He had also acquired a profound interest in, and fair knowledge of, European artistic movements. With Alberto Jim?nez Fraud acting as intermediary, he was asked to do some translations from the German and, on the strength of such vague prospects, he moved to Madrid. In his autobiography, Vida en claro, Moreno Villa, having become a more or less permanent guest at the 'Residencia,' recalls Ortega and other friends asking him: "?Pero es que se va a quedar toda la vida ah??" To which Moreno Villa comments: "Yo sonre?a y me encog?a de hombros. No me tomaba la pena de responderles que mi destino era la interinidad ... y que en mi cuarto tuve siempre a la vista la maleta para el momento preciso" (102). On the face of it this is a curious statement from one who was to live in the 'Residencia' for 20 years, from 1917 to 1937. What kind of "transience" is Moreno Villa speaking about? He</page><page sequence="4">70 ALEC, 19 (1994) specifies that it is a "catholic concept," meaning either catholic as religious or catholic as universal. But in both cases it raises the notion to the realm of universals and turns it into a quality, or condition, of the mind. In retrospect, as he writes Vida en claro from Mexico in 1947, Moreno Villa sees his life as variations on the transitional. The autobiography traces a series of circulations across diverse spaces where the self is impelled by external dynamics. The first chapter of Moreno Villa's Vida en claro is entitled "Topograf?a de la casa paterna." It constitutes an effort at orientation as both direction and origin. Moreno Villa seeks both together because seizing an origin is tantamount to seizing a direction, but also, more specifically, because in that originating orientation he wants to find the meaning of his life's trajectory: he is seeking centeredness. As Rodolphe Gasch? suggests: "Without the notion that an origin can be lost, forgotten, alienated into what springs forth from it, an origin could not be an origin" (157). Moreno Villa's own room was situated between North and South, with light from the East. In the morning, when his room was bathed in sunlight, the noises of housekeeping chased him from it. In the afternoon he sought the sunlight of other rooms: Yo quer?a hacer de mi cuarto un refugio donde, reinando el orden, pudiese abrir o extender mis planes, mis creaciones juveniles, sin que mis hermanos me revolviesen nada, sin que la vida exterior penetrase en la vida que yo iba forjando dentro de m?. Pero mi cuarto estaba entre norte y sur y decidi? sobre mi vida. Mi destino fue abandonarlo y vivir siempre, desde entonces, interinamente (Vida 18). Moreno Villa has sought such orientation not because space is itself the finalizing component of the self, or its principal determinant, but because within one's own space one can perhaps reduce the instabilities of the self and begin to grasp its origin: "En resumen, que la sencilla consideraci?n de los cuartos de mis padres conduce a una pregunta de las m?s serias que puede hacerse el hombre: ?qu? soy, c?mo soy?" (Vida 11). By analyzing his orientation, the direction of his space, in terms of the space of his parents, Moreno Villa seeks to uncover the fundamental relations of his being. While the self is defined by the boundary between inside and outside, externally it obeys the law of "interinidad" as it seeks an internal space of "[m]ovimientos en busca de apartamiento, reposo y voluptuosidad" (Vida 17).</page><page sequence="5">SALVADOR J. FAJARDO 71 The search for a personal "room" responds in Moreno Villa to a love of solitude. Only in a private space does he feel that he can write or dream. He would find just such a space in the 'Residencia.' He had settled in Madrid, to study and work at the 'Centro de estudios hist? ricos,' doing research on Gothic art. In 1917, devastated after losing the first woman he loved to ?lness, Moreno ViUa answered Jim?nez Fraud's invitation to join him at the 'Resi': "Vente a la Residencia de Estu diantes. Yo necesito en ella unos cuantos hombres j?venes que, por su rectitud moral, su afici?n al trabajo y su entusiasmo por las cosas nobles, influyan sin reglamento ni cargos determinados en el ambiente de la casa. T? no vas a ser pedagogo, pero vas a ayudarme m?s de lo que te figuras" (Vida 101). There Moreno V?la would find the ideal conditions that he had been looking for: a room where he could retreat to, surrounded by the investigative and artistic activity that made the 'Resi' the most exciting cultural center in Spain. Under the guidance of Jim?nez Fraud, the 'Residencia' became a full-fledged institution of advanced learning. Don Alberto wanted it also to shape young men into cultured gentlemen (or the liberal-progressive notion of what a 'cultured gentleman' should be), and not merely se?oritos. The 'Resi' was a center for scientific research, artistic creation, social interchange. The director invited the greatest minds of the time to lecture: Keynes, Unamuno, Le Corbusier, Einstein, Aragon, Val?ry.... There was a pervasive spirit of youthfulness and enthusiasm. The British hispanist J.B. Trend said it was like Oxford and Cambridge in Madrid. Soon the 'Resi' attracted some of the most brilliant and interesting young people in Spain. Dali spent years there, as did Lorca and Bu?uel?the latter could often be seen indulging his love of physical exercise, stripped to the waist in aU seasons. Machado visited often, and so did Juan Ram?n Jim?nez, Guillen, Cernuda ... all those who were, or were to be, the greatest poets of the time. In the midst of all this extraordinary activity, Moreno Villa contin ued his work as art historian and librarian and continued as well to paint and write. His poetry had appeared in the most prestigious reviews of the time (for instance, the Revista de Occidente, whose founder Ortega y Gasset, Moreno V?la's friend, was particularly receptive to his work), and he was held in high enough regard to be a member of the jury for the National Prize for Literature. It was his and Antonio Machado's vote that swung the jury in favor of Rafael Alberti's Marinero en tierra in 1924. With characteristic modesty, Moreno Villa reveals little of his intellectual success. It is through the testimony of friends and colleagues that we learn of the weight that his opinion carried. His preference was always for the moments of reflection that allowed him to paint and</page><page sequence="6">72 ALEC, 19 (1994) compose poetry. His desire for solitude and independence made him appear more aloof than he actually was, and his exacting nature led him to always expect more of himself, judging that he had hardly accom plished anything. In 1927 Moreno Villa met Jacinta at the house of Jim?nez Fraud: "Era una joven yanqui, rubia y admirablemente formada y vestida. Yo qued? embobado, pero m?s triste porque pensaba que mis medios de vida eran insuficientes para enamorar a una muchacha como aqu?lla. Charlamos de cosas insustanciales o divertidas y me desped?. Pero aquella misma noche vino a buscarme y me sac? vivamente de la Residencia" (Vida 123). Jacinta and Pepe fell in love. They decided to marry, but, at Pepe's insistence, not without the approval of Jacinta's parents. The latter sent Jacinta's married brother and his wife to Italy, where Pepe and Jacinta met them, en route to New York. Soon after the meeting Jos? began to notice that all was not well. Jacinta's brother and sister-in-law, while quite charming to Pepe, seemed to be making Jacinta unhappy. Once in New York, Pepe realized that Jacinta's family, her father in particular, was opposed to the marriage. They were wealthy Jews?the father was a banker?who did not intend to see their daughter marry an 'outsider,' especially one with so few prospects. Although Jacinta wanted Pepe to take her with him and leave, eager to marry him with or without her father's permission, Pepe's sense of propriety would not permit it. He also realized that Jacinta might come to regret having abandoned the cultural and material environment of her home. Moreno Villa returned to Spain, knowing that he and Jacinta might meet again, but that the relationship was essentially over. It had been indeed a detour in his life, one that extracted him from the pattern that he had so come to love at the 'Resi,' but, he saw, did not for all that separate him from what the institution meant to his creative life. It is true that the encounter can be described as a coup de foudre for Moreno Villa and for Jacinta. Curiously, we have scarce preparation for the event in Vida en claro. Moreno Villa actually reveals little of his sentimental life until the meeting. The successive approaches to, or delineations of, his self that we may gather in the first hundred and twenty pages of his autobiography must be deduced from the sense of place that he conveys, but as at the outset when he orients himself and his room with regard to his parents' spaces, he has continued to position himself in relation to others. He looks back upon his past as a series of scenes in which he acts or reacts within a context, a set of snapshots with little sense of duration or continuity. His inner self remains elusive, taking form only in relation to its outer shell. The Jacinta episode, however, offers a textual layering that does reveal portions of</page><page sequence="7">SALVADOR J. FAJARDO 73 the inner man. Moreno Villa himself specifies the uses that poetry, as a whole, had for him, when he says: "La poes?a fue para m?: 1. Una v?lvula de seguridad; 2. Fue fijaci?n de estados por los cuales pasa el yo presionado por las circunstancias; 3. Fue ritmo para acompasar la atropellada emoci?n o hacerla m?s aceptable; 4. Fue comunicaci?n efectiva con el pr?jimo" (Cirre, 32). Jacinta la pelirroja fully deploys vanguardista poetics, while at the same time it captures the spirit of its period, the late twenties, with great accuracy. It turns its back decisively on the rhetoric of late romanticism and the affectation of much love poetry still written at the time. It was one of the newest and most refreshing collections of poetry to appear in the decade and came, surprisingly, not from a member of the so-called "generaci?n del '27," but from one of its elders. It is a report, light-hearted, enthusiastic, unsentimental, on the beginning, growth, and inevitable undoing of Moreno Villa's love affair with Jacinta. There is a sense in which Jacinta la pelirroja may be described as an expression of the spirit of the 'Resi.' All those who have tried to capture the atmosphere of the place mention a seriousness of purpose together with lighthearted bantering, creative energies, and iconoclasm produc ing a sense of excitement. At the 'Resi' nightlong bouts of conversation and laughter would alternate with periods of intense work; Lorca, Alberti, who came often, Gerardo Diego, were just as likely to spend an hour over an an?glifo as over a sonnet, and someone lavished consider able ingenuity on the famous ped?metro. The knowledge that undertakings of permanent value were going on did not interfere with play, even high jinks. Traditional values were not held in high esteem: bourgeois society was populated by putrefactos (an expression of Dali's), and the younger residents took some time in fully accepting, if they ever did, Jim?nez Fraud's esp?ritu de la casa, in which they detected too strong a dose of seriousness. Moreno Villa, though he was somewhat older and was expected to set a tone to help represent this esp?ritu, was fully engaged in both the serious and less serious activities of the house. Both at the 'Resi' and outside, the younger poets invariably included him in their formal and informal poetic ventures, naturally including his poetry as part of the vanguard that they professed. Certainly the spirit that pervades Jacinta is reminiscent of Marinero en tierra or La amante of Alberti, and Jacinta, while not as anguished, is in many ways as iconoclastic as Cernuda's first surrealistic collection, Un r?o, un amor (1931). At once genuine in the love and sympathy it expresses and irreverent toward traditional trappings of emotion, playful and shrewd together, Jacinta la pelirroja, though it</page><page sequence="8">74 ALEC, 19 (1994) tells the story of a transatlantic love, might well have had the 'Resi' for its setting. The sense of transitoriness, or "interinidad" that Moreno Villa lived with, permeates many of the compositions of Jacinta la pelirroja. It is an attitude that cubism, with its insistence on emotional "distancing," on an intellectualized grasp of reality, and on the spatialization of time, was perfectly suited to convey. Jos? Moreno Villa's narrative account of the erotic episode in Vida en claro strongly communicates the feeling of displacement: 1. it does so concretely because Moreno Villa, when he had to travel with Jacinta to Italy and then to New York, left behind all the familiar spaces of his employment and residence; 2. it does so in a still more disorienting sense because he was thrust into a linguistically and culturally alien context?he could understand neither the language nor the thinking of Jacinta's family; 3. finally, it does so at the level of intimacy because Jacinta exhibited some sentimental unpredictability that Moreno Villa could never quite grasp. The fourth poem of the collection illustrates such transitoriness on all three levels, while substituting space for time through the effect of simultaneity produced by repetition: IV. Y el chofer volv?a la cara En aquel taxis, aquella noche, y en aquel parque, llorando como de verdad, tu naricilla fr?a y mi barba rapada . .. ??Recuerdas??el chofer, curioso y rabioso, volv?a la cara de apache. (Parque central de Nueva York, cinco minutos cruzando la noche; la pelirroja venal, llorando en mi hombro, y, delante, la vacilaci?n criminal del chofer). (14) In a few quick strokes the first five lines convey the essential components of this transitoriness: a moving vehicle, an instant of time, and seemingly feigned emotion ("llorando como de verdad"), or emotion as play. The repeated "aquel" seems to frame the event as a temporal snapshot whose fugacity is further underlined by the interjected "??Recuerdas??" The last four lines are a somewhat more reflective reiteration that emphasizes the notion of transit's uncertainty, implying imminent danger: "la vacilaci?n criminal del chofer,"?criminal because his curiosity may cause an accident. But, though "criminal" seems a word slightly out of place, it expresses the charged emotion of the instant, the speaker's slightly disproportionate trepidation that causes</page><page sequence="9">SALVADO/? J. FAJARDO 75 the triple rendering of the event. One of the most interesting features of the piece is its reiterative technique whereby the incident is reported three times; in lines 1-5, in lines 6-9, and in the entire poem. (The triple rendition is announced by the thrice repeated "aquel" of the first two lines.) Each moment is a coUection of synecdoches of an instant, and the whole itself stands in synecdochal relationship to the speaker's reminiscence, as a selected instant in a sentimental journey in New York. In a more general sense, the poem is thoroughly modernistic: apparently unpoetic vocabulary (taxi, driver, "naricilla," "barba rapada," etc.), quick, syntactically disconnected impressions, ironic distancing. The poem belongs to the first part of Jacinta la pelirroja, which generally recalls the blossoming of infatuation. Yet even in this early piece, there is a hint of uncertainty on several levels (including Jacinta's feelings) and the threat of an abrupt, almost farcical, ending. No doubt Moreno Villa's recasting of his amorous experience in such ironic tones had therapeutic value. Jacinta's emotions, labile, disposable almost, are those of a "flapper." For instance, upon seeing a seagull take flight ("la mecano del aire"), Jacinta "sentir? el pellizquito en el coraz?n" (15). Even in intimacy, love is a visitor to Jacinta's heart: "s?lo conoce el declive / de su alma cuando el amor la visita" (23). But that is her attraction for Moreno Villa, that she is "Jam?s sensiblera / jam?s caediza, /jam?s inflada o roma, / pesada o cautiva" (23). Jacinta teaches the poet to surrender to the intensity of the instant: "?Jacinta muerde tan bien la cereza! / Jacinta tiene ?spera la melena, / pero con ondas largas, como sus piernas" (30). Dynamism is the keynote of her character. She rushes in leggy strides to meet the world, like a sporting Diana in a short frock. The second part of the collection is entitled "Jacinta es iniciada a la poes?a." Here Moreno Villa turns inward, as if considering whether Jacinta has modified his inner self sensibly. He explores formal aspects of his craft, objectifying his sentimental self explicitly through the poetic process. Some of the poems are a clear echo of the concerns expressed in Vida en claro, as in "Causa de mi soledad," where he says: "No es af?n de apartamiento / sino atenci?n al secreto. / Soy yo mi medio" (45), or in "El alma en acci?n": "El alma no reza. / Ya no reza el alma, / el alma que fue rom?ntica / tir? su rom?ntica peineta. / Es tiempo de hacer" (59). On the other hand, the modernistic tendencies that characterize the collection now acquire explicitly cubistic and meta poetic contours, as in the appropriately titled "Cuadro cubista," where the poet seeks to distance himself from daily concerns through an exercise in revisualization. I shall attend to this poem in some detail because it is one of the best known in the collection and because it is a fine illustration of "cubist" poetics.</page><page sequence="10">76 ALEC, 19 (1994) VIL Cuadro cubista Aqu? te pongo, guitarra, en el fondo de las aguas marinas, cerca de un ancla. ?Qu? m?s da si aqu? no vas a sonar? Y vas a ser compa?era de mi reloj de pulsera que tampoco ha de marcar si es hora de despertar. Vas a existir para siempre con la cabra sumergida, la paloma que no vuela, y el bigote del suicida. Ti?ndete bien, entra en forma, sost?n tu amarillo p?lido y tu severa caoba; conserva bien las distancias o busca la transparencia. Lo dem?s no me hace falta. (50-51) In her compact and insightful reading of the poem, Birut? Cipli jauskait? suggests that the connecting element between the poem's disparate objects is "la negaci?n: ninguno de los elementos enumerados cumple su funci?n original. Con esto se subraya el fracaso total que est? a la ra?z del poema" (55). The poem announces its ekphrastic nature in the title. A closer analysis reveals some interesting elements in this composition that would suggest some qualifications to Birut? Cipli jauskait?'s conclusion (with regard to the interpretation of "fracaso" in particular). The poem's frame, established as empty space by the title, is further defined within the poem by means of two syntactical isotopies. The first establishes the exclusion of the frame's outside through the speaker's initial gesture ("Aqu? te pongo ...") and final negation ("lo dem?s no me hace falta"). The second defines the "cuadro's" interior space, by means of the speaker's organization of its "represented" (described) objects and their respective locations. An initial consideration of the first isotopy shows that the framing proceeds by means of: a) a negation of the guitar's proper locus upon placing it in an unlikely one. "Aqu?" acquires its significance retroac tively as the reader arrives at "en el fondo de las aguas / marinas." It becomes a purely rhetorical deictic, that is to say, it has lost its force as</page><page sequence="11">SALVADOR J. FAJARDO 77 spatial referent and initiates the move away from the plane of reality to that of language. It asserts a linguistic space as it negates a referential space; b) a negation of the world outside of the frame ("Lo dem?s")? yet, as we shall see, that outside is there, pressing in, in spite of the overforceful "no me hace falta." The second isotopy is a double one. It creates the frame's interior space through the organization of its objects and by means of syntactical connections: "te pongo," "no vas a sonar," "vas a ser," "tampoco ha de tocar." The objects themselves represent the second aspect of this double isotopy, and, beginning with the guitar, stand in synecdochal relationship to the initial framing assertions, "Aqu?. . . / en el fondo de las aguas / marinas" and the final "Lo dem?s no me hace falta," as well as the internal syntactical connections. These isotopies are assertions of the artistic will that wants to put into play the double force of poetry and pictorial art. The objects are given and resituated synecdochically through: a) a suppression of semes related to their use (i.e., guitar as instrument, anchor as ship's hook, watch as timepiece, etc.?following Birut? Ciplijauskait?) and to their customary location (except for the anchor, whose role is metaphorically also that of "anchoring" the objects "en el fondo"); b) an addition of semes related to their shape that grows out of their new propinquity ("guitarra" - "ancla" - "reloj") and their new space. In the first part of the poem, the semes that the guitar loses are substituted by those it gains. In the second part, the guitar gains further semes by newly asserted relationships that introduce the concept of time and ask the framing function to delimit both space and process. In terms of cubist painting, this move is analogous to the multiplicity of lines and perspectives in a picture, i.e., the artist's effort to render time through space by depicting several perspectives at once. The painting process is transposed linguistically through the continued syntactical component of the second isotopy: "vas a existir," "Ti?ndete bien y entra en forma, / sost?n . . .," "conserva bien," "busca." The guitar acquires the new seme of temporality. At the same time, the new set of items that are situated next to the instrument are a continua tion of the synecdoche of objects and relate to the guitar through a similar suppression of semes ("cabra sumergida"?the goat deprived of its ability to climb; "paloma que no vuela"?the dove deprived of its ability to fly; "bigote del suicida"?one moustache over a mouth that cannot speak; all three, under water next to the guitar, are, of course, drowned). This negation of what may be termed the "ascensional" potential of these disparate objects is replaced by an assertion of their implicit extensionality. The reader is also led to imagine similarities of design, relating perhaps the rising curves of the guitar to those of the</page><page sequence="12">78 ALEC, 19 (1994) goat's unmentioned horns, the dove's negated wings, the suicide's moustache. In this second part, the guitar also gains compositional and anthropomorphic semes: "en forma," "amarillo p?lido" ("en forma" introduces the human and formal code), "severa caoba" ("severa" has the same effect for "caoba"). Thus "conserva bien las distancias" functions according to the double code of space and personal character. The same is true of "busca la transparencia" : to keep one's distance and to seek transparency have the same effect of not allowing objects (people) to affect one's space. That is truly to effect a disappearance. The syntactical isotopy has related all the objects in the "cuadro" to the guitar, whose semantic content has become disseminated into them. The penultimate line, "o busca la transparencia" iterates this dissemina tion as the instrument's disappearance. But with such disappearance, as the central element in this ekphrastic construction dissipates, so do the other items that were situated in relation to it. "Lo dem?s," though it is forcefully rejected, rushes in and obliterates frame and contents. Thus the unstable tension between container and contents that had sustained the construction from the beginning collapses as its keystone?the guitar?evaporates. "Lo dem?s" cannot ultimately close the frame. It was meant to stay the dissemination of the central signifier (guitar), but fails in its task. The entire representation is "unanchored," drifts into the transparency of "las aguas marinas." Finally, though it appears at first that the guitar confers space and form to the objects, an inversion of hierarchies suggests that these objects actually end up conforming the submerged guitar. Similarly, though "[l]o dem?s" wants to define the frame with relation to the world of objects outside of it, it is the rest of the world that becomes hierarchically superior to the framing?it becomes the framing's possibility, the condition of possibility of the frame and the picture. As an example of ekphrasis the poem is quite successful, reminiscent in its formal precision to the great compositions of Alberti in A la pintura o? thirty years later. It is also strikingly effective as a transposi tion of the representational effects of cubism. The very notion of multiple perspectives is rendered through the introduction of the temporal code and through the reading experience proper as we are led retroactively to reconfigure the various objects and spaces, thus effecting several simultaneous readings at once. For instance, "Aqu?" is made explicit by the following three lines; later, each reassertion of the guitar's space in relation to the other items functions also retroactively. According to Birut? Ciplijauskait?, "[l]a guitarra ... se puede considerar como el doble del poeta y se enlaza con el ?ltimo detalle disgregado: el bigote. El asesinato de la guitarra corresponde al suicidio sentimental del autor" (56). Yet, there is a playful tone in the poem that</page><page sequence="13">SALVADOR J. FAJARDO 79 runs counter to the notion of suicide, if merely on the sentimental plane. Even at the level of negated functionality (the guitar that does not sound, the watch that does not tell time, the dove that does not fly, etc.), such negation serves to frame the objects as shapes. It is not a reduction but a transformation for ekphrastic ends. The guitar is then not assassinated, but rather made to function in a different artistic medium. Its new locus "en el fondo de las aguas / marinas ..." marks the object's inaccessibility to any use as an instrument. If we remain within its own confines, the poem responds successfully to a strictly "modernist" reading. Its "failure" surfaces only within the slightly deconstructive reading that we have suggested and it hints at the intrinsic instability of the ekphrastic form in general: "Ekphrastic ambition gives to the language art the extraordinary assignment of seeking to represent the unrepresentable. Yet, every tendency in the verbal sequence to freeze itself into a shape ... is inevitably accompanied by a countertendency for that sequence to free itself from the limited enclosure of the frozen, sensible image into an unbounded temporal flow" (Krieger 9-10). In poem V of the collection's second part, Moreno Villa explores the graphemic potential of the letter &lt;D (written in longhand) and generates another pictorial moment that works in reverse of customary poetic activity: Hice una &lt;D tendida como una barca y todo mi cuarto se hizo playa sent?a el rumor rizado de la orilla y el alquitr?n que hay bajo la luz marina. Instead of projecting a mood into a poem, the poet allows the shape of a letter to transform his setting and to change his own writing self into a graphic sign: Aqu? est? la &lt;D ladeada, lancha en la orilla encallada, perdida yo no s? donde y hallada sobre mi nombre. (48) In this piece Moreno Villa turns to the workings of written language. The poem flows entirely from the first line wherein the T&gt; rolls on its side and extends ekphrastically into a "barca." Thereafter, ekphrasis is reversed, i.e., it suggests both an internal landscape and a written landscape: "y el alquitr?n que hay bajo la luz marina" becomes a metaphor for the written composition by the poet ("marina" = Moreno, "alquitr?n" = ink). Selected graphemic components of the poem are also</page><page sequence="14">80 ALEC, 19 (1994) reorganized by the last line that joins all the previous occurrences of "d" and "11": Challada sobre mi nombre," Moreno Villa - Marina Villa). Here the poet, rather than asserting the "semiotic desire for the natural sign" (11) as Krieger feels ekphrasis seeks to do, underlines the arbitrary suggestiveness of language in its graphemic and semiotic potential. In fact, the poet seems to be anticipating aspects of the practice of today's concrete poets who, according to Wendy Steiner, aim to "increase the apparently nonsemiotic properties of their work at the expense of the semiotic ones, and what this usually involves is the maximizing of iconic properties at the expense of symbolic ones" (198). Not that Moreno Villa was writing concrete poetry avant la lettre; but he is representative of the more imaginative poets of the period, and his own practice confirms the view that the seeds of postmodernist poetry were planted by the vanguardist poetics of the twenties and thirties. In this instance Moreno Villa's world is a playful, ironic, self-parodying one, where poetic creation can fill any available signifier, even the most seemingly empty and elementary ("CD"), and transform it into a seashore of the mind. The last three pieces of the collection are the poet's farewell to Jacinta as well as an affirmation of the insights that the poetic process has afforded him. These insights allow the poet to understand his experience in its proper perspective. In XVIII, "Jacinta empieza a no comprender," the poet accuses the young woman of a lack of perceptive ness: Jacinta no v? que siendo dulce es amarga, no v? que su figura es de hueso y de carne, de marfil y de cuerno, de sangre, de piel, de cabellos, de agua, de memoria, de voluntad, de inteligencia, de amores y de odios de pasiones confusas y enso?aciones claras. (66) Jacinta's sight slips over the surface of things and does not plumb the terse contradictions of reality, those that made her so desirable: "No v? la divina tramoya" (66). The poet's loss is ultimately Jacinta's very straightforwardness, the very modernity that allows her to be at one with her days, not grasping their history. She understands immediate value and not the world's fruitful complementarities: Al lado del taca?o me siento manirroto, Jacinta. Se crearon los p?jaros al ver los elefantes, y nuestra tierra en vista del inmenso vac?o.</page><page sequence="15">SALVADOR J. FAJARDO 81 Abre, Jacinta, los ojos a la creaci?n las manos y todo tu ser. ("Jacinta me culpa de dispendioso" 68) And yet, this blindness was present in Jacinta even when the poet saw her as an energetic child of the American twenties or as the young woman who buys a Picasso "Para su casa rectil?nea" (24). She is of her time and irremediably in it. It is the poet who can be in this time and can also look upon it, who moves on. He had taken her with him, bypassing the world, circumscribing spaces without inhabiting them?an old habit of his: Al pueblo, s?, pero contigo, Jacinta. Bordeando la v?a del tren y el r?o. Bordeando todas las flores del camino, Bordeando la iglesia, el castillo, la nube y los bellos esp?ritus. ("Al pueblo, s?, pero contigo" 20) The poet can return to the village?the place of origin?with Jacinta as talisman of the outside, modern city world, transiting within the interstices of the permanent. But, ultimately, only he could reside within a moveable space while his beloved remained captive of a world left behind. On his way back to Spain from New York, after realizing that his future with Jacinta was off limits, Moreno Villa looks ahead from a world that seems modern and timely, but is merely attached to the materiality of existence, toward one that is more truly forward-looking: "Una gran cosa obtuve de esta verdadera aventura: el triunfo sobre el romanticismo" (135). In Madrid he knows that Ortega est? preparando su clase de filosof?a o su follet?n para "El Sol," que Men?ndez Pidal redacta su libro "La Espa?a del Cid"; que Arniches ensaya un sa?nete; que Manuel Machado entra y sale en la Biblioteca del Ayuntamiento . . . que Garc?a Lorca lee, con ahogos de alegr?a, su nueva comedia; que los eruditos afinan, que afinan los poetas y los fil?sofos; que Valle Incl?n depura en las tertulias de caf? la manera eficaz de contar un esperpento. (141) And he recalls, as he writes this in Mexico, in 1947, that in the Resi dencia, "?Qu? maravilla! Durante veinte a?os he sentido este ritmo emulatorio, y he dicho: As? vale la pena de vivir. Un centenar de</page><page sequence="16">82 ALEC, 19 (1994) personas de primer orden trabajando con la ilusi?n m?xima, a alta pre cisi?n" (Vida 141). In A Generation of Spanish Poets. 1920-1936, C. B. Morris stated that "what made Moreno Villa's poetry more valuable than a graph of literary fashion was his view of poetry as the 'confession' of authentic feelings" (177). Jacinta la pelirroja does confirm this view, though not in the expected sense of actually showing the poet's coeur mis ? nu, to quote Baudelaire. Actually, Moreno Villa makes use of vanguardist poetics both to analyze and to objectify his feelings for Jacinta, in a sort of poetic exorcism. The extent to which his redhaired muse could embody the new esthetics was circumscribed by her very represen tativeness, her singular 'modernity.' Moreno Villa understood the new poetics as a re-centering of the poetic activity, a reorganization of poetic language in the wide-ranging modernist sense reported by Ortega in La deshumanizaci?n del arte, where he notes in the young poets of the time a rejection of sentimentality, the shrugging off of any extra-poetic burdens, the adoption of a dynamic self-awareness in the poem, art as play. Moreno Villa was a man of his time and transcended it as well, in the same sense that modernist poetics, which grew to maturity in the twenties and thirties, sought to set aside the baggage of romanticism and opened new horizons to the poet. NOTES 1. Guillermo Carnero makes this very point in his essay on the poet: Jos? Moreno Villa (1887-1955) es uno de los muchos escritores espa?oles de este siglo necesitados de revisi?n y examen, y no solo por lo que en ello pueda haber de reparaci?n moral postuma, sino porque un exacto conocimiento de la aportaci?n de quienes, como ?l, tuvieron la mala surte de venir al mundo literario entre dos ?pocas bien definidas y dotadas de figuras de primera magnitud reside la ?nica posibilidad de entender org?nicamente y sin transiciones bruscas la historia de los decenios segundo y tercero de nuestro siglo XX. (181) With regard to his relationship with the generation of'27,1 should mention that Moreno Villa maintained very friendly relations with all its members, and that, for instance, he joined them on the occasion of their celebration of G?ngora's tercentenary. 2. This volume was praised by Antonio Machado in the Revista de Occidente (diciembre 1924, 435-440). Machado notes in the poetry a balance between emotion and thought rarely seen in the "Vanguardia" (Carnero 188). 3. Pedro Aull?n de Haro does this for pre-Civil War poetry in general, in La poes?a en el siglo XX (Hasta 1939). In The Conflict of Light and Wind, C.</page><page sequence="17">SALVADOR J. FAJARDO 83 Christopher Soufas addresses specifically the generation of '27 in terms of European modernism. 4. Quoted by John Crispin in his little book on the 'Resi' (which took the statement for its title): Oxford and Cambridge in Madrid. 5. The poem "En la selva fervorosa," from El pasajero, was widely discussed and particularly impressed Ortega. 6. Moreno Villa's exacting nature sometimes made him appear aloof even to longtime friends. "Con usted hay que comenzar la amistad cada d?a" (Vida 119), Lorca once remarked to Moreno. 7. Actually, Moreno Villa had given up his not inconsiderable inheritance in favor of his sisters. 8. "AnagUfos," were minimaUst, humoristic compositions "que constaban de tres sustantivos, uno de los cuales, el del medio, hab?a de ser la gallina. Todo el chiste estribaba en el que el tercero tuviese unas condiciones fon?ticas impresionantes por lo inesperadas. Ejemplo . .. El t?, el t?, la gallina y el Teotoc?puli." (Vida 113) As for the "ped?metro" Rafael Alberti describes it thus: "Otro invento, que como era natural se mantuvo en secreto, fue el 'ped?metro'. Dentro de una caja cuadrada de madera se alzaba un cabo de vela. A cierta distancia de la llama y coincidiendo con su altura, pend?a un cordoncillo de hilo. El m?rito consist?a en la intensidad del viento que cada concursante expeliera por el orificio. Se necesitaba un pedo de gran fuerza para lograr que la llama se doblase y llegara a prender el hilo. Juego de verdaderos colegiales .. ." (La arboleda perdida, 1215). 9. Wendy Steiner's comments on cubist art are equally applicable to cubist poetry: "The emotional distance of the artist is connected to the fact that the work of art signifies not reality, but the process of perceiving and conceiving of it. Thus, cubist art is definitionally self-reflexive" (181). In "Los 'cuadros cubistas' de Jos? Moreno V?la," Birut? Ciplijauskait? remarks that "[e]s el cubismo ... lo que cautiva primero la atenci?n de Moreno Villa" (49). 10. The poem has been anthologized in, among others: Federico de On?s, Antolog?a de la poes?a espa?ola e hispanoamericana (1882-1932); Gustavo Correa, Antolog?a de la poes?a espa?ola (1900-1980); Arturo Ramoneda, Antolog?a de la literatura espa?ola del siglo XX. 11. The original edition of Jacinta la pelirroja has "enferma" (line 14) which I take to be a misprint for "en forma." The "en forma" is reproduced by Ramoneda in his Antolog?a, but Correa and de On?s follow "enferma." 12. Baudelaire's Mon coeur mis ? nu is a s?ries of 95 prose pieces usually included among his Journaux intimes.</page><page sequence="18">84 ALEC, 19 (1994) WORKS CONSULTED Alberti, Rafael.
