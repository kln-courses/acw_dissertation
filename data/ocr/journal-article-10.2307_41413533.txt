<plain_text><page sequence="1">" Willing Liberates": Nietzschean Heroism in Tsitsi Dangarembga's Nervous Conditions Amanda Waugh University of Massachusetts, Amherst Women have often read Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophy with discomfort. In Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Nietzsche compares women to playthings and gems. In the same text, he argues that a man's highest aspiration is to become the Übermensch or Overman, master of his own world and creator of his own moral code. Women, on the other hand, can hope only to give birth to the Übermensch (66). Largely considered a misogynist, Nietzsche presents a dilemma for contemporary philosophers. Some disregard him entirely because of his sexism, while others read women as a metaphor for objective Truth.1 While twentieth-century literary critics and scholars acknowledge Nietzsche's influence on deconstruction and postmodernism, feminists have been more hesitant to acknowledge his work, in no small part due to his problematic polemics against women. Consequently, Nietzsche's influence on feminist theory has largely been indirect, with few feminists claiming Nietzsche as an important predecessor or foundational thinker. The elements in Nietzsche's philosophy that appeal to feminist theory - suspicion of dichotomies and oppositions, of objective truth, and of universal values - are especially attractive within the lens of postcolonialism. Recognizing the potential significance of Nietzsche to postcolonial feminism, Ofelia Schutte describes the aims of postcolonial feminism as "problematizing the Western concept of self" and "questioning] the regulative use of gender in national and postcolonial narratives, but also the Enlightenment concept of individualism that fails to notice the complex, multilayered, fragmented, contradictory aspects of the self" ("Cultural" 49). Both a Nietzsche and postcolonial feminist scholar, Schutte draws on Nietzsche's perspectivism to justify a view of the self that emphasizes its multilayered aspects and membership in a larger postcolonial community. Nietzsche's perspectivism, his call to overcome binary oppositions, and his condemnation of value systems that claim universality are all clearly useful for postcolonial feminism and theory. However, other concepts in his work, like will to power and the dichotomy of master and slave moralities, appear to support a politics of domination that simply replaces one form of oppression with another. In the Genealogy of Morals, for example, Nietzsche declares, "To demand of strength that it should not express itself as strength, that it should not be a desire to overcome, a desire to throw down, a desire to become 80</page><page sequence="2">"Willing Liberates" 81 master, a thirst for enemies and resistances and triumphs, is just as absurd as to demand of weakness that it should express itself as strength" (45). This declaration presents two problems; it utilizes a language of domination and implies that people are essentially weak or strong. The latter is the most frustrating for Ofelia Schutte, who ultimately concludes that the "reversion to repression undermines all the liberating aspects of Nietzsche's philosophy" (Beyond 160). Nevertheless, by focusing on Nietzsche's theories of overcoming, becoming, will to power, and language, his philosophy can still be interpreted as a philosophy of liberation, and one that does not revert to a politics of domination. To show this, I will revisit Nietzsche's concepts and offer an interpretation that speaks to his philosophy's liberating potential. I will then turn to Tsitsi Dangarembga's postcolonial novel Nervous Conditions. Reading concurrently Nietzsche and Nervous Conditions provides a framework for understanding why the narrator-protagonist Tambu "escapes," in her words, and why her cousin Nyasha remains "entrapped" in the colonial mindset (1). Tambu will be shown to be what I call a Nietzschean heroine - a woman who embodies the Übermensch by resisting binaries, overcoming good and evil, emphasizing becoming over being, and demonstrating creativity in language and values. Her process of overcoming externally imposed systems of value demonstrates a way to consider Nietzschean will to power as escaping rather than repressive domination. Nyasha, on the other hand, remains caught within existing binary conceptions of good and evil. Unable to express her will to power externally in Dionysian creativity, she embraces asceticism by developing anorexia, a strikingly life-denying act. Working with Nietzsche in a postcolonial context illuminates the need for individuals to resist imposed constructions of values as well as the concomitant dichotomous thinking that compels cultural hybrids, or those situated in between the categories (colonial /native, black /white) to assimilate to one over the other. Moreover, the Nietzschean declaration of the death of God can be likened to the postcolonial need to condemn both the elevation of secular colonial values and the deification of whiteness associated with the Christian missionary project. Whether the influence is directly acknowledged or not, feminists and postcolonial feminists alike have been drawing on Nietzschean philosophy for decades in order to deconstruct and question dichotomous thinking and the universalization of value. The model of heroism that emerges from Nietzsche's writing is embodied in the Übermensch , proclaimed by the eponymous prophet Zarathustra to be the status after which every human ought to strive. Rather than adhering to established views of morality, the Übermensch creates values for him or herself.</page><page sequence="3">82 Amanda Waugh Thus Spoke Zarathustra illustrates the process of overcoming as a metamorphosis of the heroic spirit, which begins as a camel, evolves into a lion, and ends as a child (25). Initially, the spirit resembles a camel, accepting burdens placed upon it by forces outside its control. In the context of Zarathustra's discussion of destroying old values and creating them anew for oneself, these burdens represent systems of values and morality imposed by culture, society, and tradition (26). Cognizant of its burden, the camel becomes a lion when it confronts and fights its "last god." The term "last god" is applicable to any value system that demands compliance and delineates good and evil for the individual. Saying no to any such system is a necessary step in catalyzing the final metamorphosis from lion to child. The latter is distinguished by its ability to say "Yes" to itself, to "assume the right to new values," and thereby to act according to its own will (27). Saying "Yes" to the creation of values is an affirmation of life, individual desire, and will to power. Nietzsche contrasts the Übermensch with its antithesis, the ascetic individual. Whereas the former celebrates and achieves transcendence beyond existing value systems, the latter embodies nihilistic tendencies. Nietzsche's paradigm case of ascetic nihilism is the Christian who divests the world of its meaning and purpose in favor of the afterlife, or "afterworld." The ascetic individual characteristically endures and obeys, willing to sacrifice against immediate impulses and desires in order to gain entrance to Heaven; in other words, eternal life-to-come is privileged over the life-lived-now. According to Nietzsche, the impetus for this life-denying philosophy is "the brief madness of bliss which is experienced only by those who suffer most deeply" (Zarathustra 31). He describes this revaluation as an inversion of aristocratic values, most clearly seen in the Judeo-Christian tradition. The ascetics say, "'the wretched alone are the good; the poor, impotent, lowly alone are the good; the suffering, deprived, sick, ugly alone are pious, alone are blessed by God . . . you, the powerful and noble, are on the contrary evil'" ( Genealogy 34). Weak qualities are reinterpreted as strengths while the strong are vilified. Nietzsche believes that the impulse to revaluate is founded in the weak individual's inability to express will to power externally. The ascetic individual, according to Nietzsche's argument, adopts a nihilistic point of view by divesting the world of meaning and transferring it to the next. Ultimately, the weak individual reveals the intention to be the strong by positing a kingdom of Heaven in which the "strong" are punished and the "weak" are blessed (Genealogy 49). In this way, this life-denying, nihilistic point of view is also an expression of will, as "all forms of life aim to will their meaning, even if that meaning is a conviction about the meaninglessness of (natural) life" (Hatab 110). Although Nietzsche concedes that the first revaluation of value was a creative act, it quickly became oppressive and</page><page sequence="4">" Willing Liberates " 83 repressive by first claiming universality, and second, affirming humility, chastity, and poverty. These are the "three great slogans" of the ascetic ideal, which is opposed to the Übermensch in its self-effacement. The ascetic individual has "an insatiable instinct and power-will that wants to become master not over something in life but over life itself" (107, 118). In doing so, the ascetic represses the creative impulse. The Übermensch and the ascetic ideal represent Nietzschean heroism and its diametrical opposite respectively. By encouraging creativity and eschewing limiting systems of values, the Nietzschean hero exults and revels in total freedom; the process of willing is liberating (Zarathustra 87). The ascetic ideal, on the other hand, is stuck within the binary of good and evil. As a reaction to another morality, the ascetic individual requires an "external hostile world" against which to define itself ( Genealogy 37). Rather than create anew for itself, the ascetic individual merely inverts the strong's conception of "good," remaining trapped within predefined terms and values. In this way, rebellion is also not equal to Nietzschean escape or heroism. Rebellion occurs at the lion stage, where the aspiring hero stands in opposition to duty and created value. To become a hero, however, the lion must transcend these systems by metamorphosing into the child. While the lion is still caught between "Yes" and "No," the child moves beyond the rebellion to create anew. Simply rebelling against established values and categories does not challenge and dismantle existing modes of classification. In fact, rebellion requires the existence of some value against which to react, and in actuality reinforces the existent binaries by affirming dichotomous "either /or" oppositions. As such, rebellion only denotes a stage in the Nietzschean metamorphosis, not its final product. When the child creates new values for itself, it transcends the restrictive nature of existing categories of good and evil. If this final stage is unreached, the individual remains trapped. In an effort to overcome these systems and create a space for individual creativity, Nietzsche famously declares, "God is dead!" When connected to Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra and The Genealogy of Morals , the repercussions of God's death become clear; the responsibility for giving life meaning, previously placed in God's hands, is now given to human beings. This has several possible connotations for the postcolonial feminist philosopher. First, God can represent a patriarchal religious tradition in which God and his Son instruct the herd to follow with unquestioning obedience. In God's death, we can read the death of a tradition that privileges the male as authoritative figure. In Africa in particular, God's death entails the freedom to question critically the ideological ramifications of marriage between the colonial civilizing mission and the Christian missionary project. The Way, as both salvation and the myth of development, is undermined once objective</page><page sequence="5">84 Amanda Waugh Truth is questioned because it depends on the notion of God as an absolute, giving universal validity to all of its claims. God's death, however, requires humans to become creators of values and consequently, become free by moving beyond the binary of good and evil demarcated by the church. Although Nietzsche posits the Übermensch as a model of heroism, his perspectivism undercuts any charges leveled by Nietzsche's critics that the Übermensch is his own variation of an objective truth. Zarathustra's overall message reflects this; he challenges, "'This is my way; where is yours?' Thus I answered those who asked me 'the way.' For the way - that does not exist" (36). Though figured as an authority and prophet, Zarathustra resists the claims to universality that are characteristic of Christian mission work and colonial philosophies of progress and civilization. Perspectivism, by refusing to privilege one point of view over another, is useful in preserving the autonomy and reaffirming the legitimacy of alternative worldviews. With respect to morality, perspectivism deflates the strict Christian demarcation of good and evil, makes the categories flexible, allows for multiple interpretations, and is predicated on an individual's point of view, experiences, and desires. The emphasis on perspectivism similarly undercuts charges of domination and oppression. Zarathustra encourages his followers, "This is my good; this I love; it pleases me wholly; thus alone do I want the good. I do not want it as divine law; I do not want it as human statute or need: it shall not be a signpost for me to overearths and paradises" (36). By resisting the urge to universalize through divine law or human statute, the individual refrains from imposing his or her values on another. This reading of Nietzsche precludes any notion of domination that the will to power may imply, favoring instead an interpretation that finds creativity to be the true way that will to power is expressed. I draw my interpretation of will to power as a creative overcoming from The Genealogy of Morals , Beyond Good and Evil , and works like The Birth of Tragedy and "Truth and Lying in a Non-Moral Sense," which describe the Dionysian worldview. In Genealogy , Nietzsche delineates the way in which the Christian demarcation of good and evil works to construct ideas of truth and in turn, becomes universal and prescriptive. The earlier text Beyond Good and Evil prefigures this shift in Nietzsche's philosophy, decrying the "fundamental belief of metaphysicians ... in the oppositions of values" (6). These oppositions limit the possibilities that an individual can see. Instead, Nietzsche praises the man who "knows that he is the one who gives honor to things in the first place, he creates values " (154). This creativity reflects the Dionysian world view presented in The Birth of Tragedy and defined as "an affirmative instinct for life, turned against morality . . . purely artistic and anti-Christian" (9). This view is defined in contradistinction to the Apolline, which is</page><page sequence="6">" Willing Liberates " 85 characterized by regularity and evenness. The Dionysian resists rigidity and structure in its overflowing intensity of emotion and sound, allowing one to feel connection with fellow man and a "total liberation of all symbolic forces." As the God of breaking down boundaries, Dionysus celebrates the kind of life- affirmation that is incompatible with oppositions like good and evil and, to extrapolate from Nietzsche's philosophy further, even oppositions like black/ white, colonizer/ colonized, native/ foreign, and male/ female. Just as dichotomous concepts like good and evil are misleading in their claims to objectivity and universality, language itself creates oppositions and differences that obscure its own constitutive role in constructing reality; bywords appear to correspond - stably and uncomplicatedly - to reality-in- itself. In the essay "On Truth and Lying in a Non-Moral Sense," Nietzsche puts forth his most complete exposition on language, calling language a "way of designating things . . . .which has the same validity and force everywhere, and the legislation of language also produces the first laws of truth ..." (143). In our use of language, Nietzsche suggests, we forget that the concepts and words we use do not correspond to some objective reality. Instead, words and the truth we presume to correspond to them are "illusions about which one has forgotten that this is what they are ..." (146). To acknowledge that language, which Nietzsche calls an "imperfect mechanism," is restrictive, limiting, and illusory does not mean that language itself cannot be used as part of Nietzsche's liberating philosophy. On the contrary, recognizing the arbitrary correspondence between words and reality in-itself presents the opportunity to re-name, calling things into existence and structuring the world around the individual's perspective. The creativity that is entailed by the act of renaming is characteristic of the Child, the last stage of the Nietzschean metamorphosis. After Zarathustra's lion says "No" to duty, convention, and systems of value, he must transform into the Child. The child names his own good, using language to express will to power through the creation of values. At this point, it is useful to turn to Nervous Conditions , as the narrator of the story, Tambu, clarifies Nietzsche's views on creativity and heroism. She retrospectively retells the events of her childhood and adolescence, and her interjections and judgments of those events demonstrate an understanding of language, reality, and values from a Nietzschean perspective. Tambu's abrupt declaration at the beginning of the novel, "I was not sorry when my brother died," is immediately followed by, "Nor am I apologising for my callousness, as you may define it, my lack of feeling" (1). By immediately acknowledging the reader's capacity to define words for him or herself, she recognizes their lack of fixed meaning and thus, their incapacity to define things in terms of absolutes. Just as Nietzsche rejects the claims of good and evil to objective values and reality, Tambu rejects the teleologica! definitions of words as rigid</page><page sequence="7">86 Amanda Waugh structures referring - descriptively rather than constitutively - to reality. There is a Dionysian sense of creativity and flexibility in her redefinitions, which include the concepts of squalor as well as good and evil as she moves from her rural homestead to her uncle Babamukuru's home. Babamukuru is Tambu's childhood source for the delineations of good and evil. Educated by white missionaries and employed by them as headmaster of the mission school, he derives his notions of good and evil from his religious upbringing and attempts to inculcate them in Tambu and his daughter Nyasha. After Tambu enrolls at the mission, Babamukuru announces the terms of her education. He recognizes her as an "intelligent girl," but one who needs to develop into a "good woman" (88). Goodness, in his view, is associated with the Christian precepts of chastity, humility, and obedience. Her concession to Babamukuru's definitions of good and evil situate Tambu at the camel stage of the Nietzschean metamorphosis. In Nervous Conditions , Babamukuru functions at the intersection of traditional patriarchal and colonial systems of values, and represents the "last god" that Tambu must confront before being able to create values for herself. While Nietzsche uses the term "god" to encompass any prescriptive system of values, the adoring language that Tambu uses to describe Babamukuru underscores the link I see between him and the "god" that must figuratively "die" in Nietzsche's philosophy. Tambu lives in a society that reveres male authority, wealth, and whiteness, and consequently she deifies Babamukuru as the embodiment of those traits. Variously linked to skin color, purity, goodness, and holiness, whiteness is connected to Babamukuru because of his interaction with the colonial white missionaries. Tambu's achievement of Nietzschean heroism occurs at the moment that she renounces his authority and allows her actions to be governed by an independent assessment of goodness based on her individual wants and desires. The moment of escape is occasioned by Babamukuru's insistence that Tambu's parents have a Christian wedding. Confronted with the implications of the wedding, Tambu begins to reconsider the identity that Babamukuru - as representative of colonial religion and patriarchal structure - has thrust upon her; as a bastard, she is living in sin by association and by definition. Tambu refuses to be defined in these terms, and instead tells Babamukuru, "I do not want to go to the wedding" (167). She expresses this want without reference to any external value system. Babamukuru warns her, "'Anyone who defies my authority is an evil thing in this house, bent on destroying what I have made,"' but Tambu rationalizes, '"I knew I was not evil to have endured all that terror in order to be sure of my decision.'" This deliberate act moves her beyond the oppositional categories of Englishness and Shona and</page><page sequence="8">" Willing Liberates " 87 black and white to a space of self-definition. When Tambu recognizes that she is not evil for having a desire incompatible with those she ought to have, she confronts the contradictions that exist in society's expectation of a good, poor, African woman. This awareness is necessary if one is to transcend value systems, as it is "only by understanding the contradictions inherent in women's location within various structures that effective political action and challenges can be devised" (Mohanty 346). The act of renaming her choice and desire as "good" for herself, despite Babamukuru's accusation, is the creative process that completes Nietzsche's metamorphosis and establishes Tambu as a Nietzschean heroine. In contrast, Tambu's cousin Nyasha remains entrapped because she is unable to redefine and rename the world around her. Nyasha constantly struggles between what she believes to be right and what Babamukuru claims is wrong. When she suffers a mental breakdown in the novel's final pages, Nyasha rages, "T am not a good girl. I'm evil. I'm not a good girl'" (200). She knows that she cannot fulfill the requirements of goodness, either by Christianity's or Babamukuru's standards. Nyasha rejects both the "good girl of her father's myth of ideal Shona femininity" as well as "the good compliant kaffir girl of the white Rhodesian imagination" (Thomas 192). Even in her own mind, Nyasha cannot see an alternative to the binaries of good and evil, African and English, and male and female. By appealing to existing definitions of good and evil, she is in fact trapped within binary constructions of values instead of creating her own classifications. Nyasha ends her frenzied speech with the concession, "'I'm not one of them but I'm not one of you/" signaling her inability to navigate the liminal space and an awareness that cultural hybridity has become the central component of her identity. Rather than surpass the binaries of good and evil, she identifies with being evil. The established binaries are upheld, not dismantled, through Nyasha's point of view. While she continually rebels against her father, she nevertheless concedes to his categories and definitions. She utters a "No" to duty and her father, but is unable to affirm values in the void that is left. The combination of accepting these binary categorizations and applying them to herself accordingly, as well as controlling her body through anorexia, makes Nyasha a model of the ascetic ideal. Throughout Nervous Conditions , Nyasha tenaciously strives to break out of the compounded systems of patriarchy and colonialism by reacting against her father's expectations. However, her obsession with history and view of others as "historical artifacts" encourage her to see herself as similarly immutable, and consequently, the hybrid condition as inexorable. This point of view undermines her desire to escape, leaving her entrapped within the systems she abhors. Incapable of changing her environment because she considers it</page><page sequence="9">88 Amanda Waugh incontrovertible, her will to exert power is turned inward against herself, seen in her disciplined diet and anorexia. The ascetic life is characterized by this inward move, a sign "of an insatiable instinct and power-will that wants to become master not over something in life but over life itself" (Genealogy 117). The anorectic condition, however, is self-defeating instead of empowering because it limits the body's power, weakening it physically. As Susan Bordo argues, anorexia's "obsession with slenderness is hopelessly counterproductive" because the body is deprived of nutrition and thus the energy to resist masculine expectations and pressures (159). Nyasha's strict eating regiment is intended to help her cope with the pressures of conforming to Babamukuru's expectations. When Nyasha assumes the role of an anorexic woman, she actually increases rather than lessens the mental and physical toll. Nietzsche's book Thus Spoke Zarathustra is subtitled "A Book for None and All," suggesting that the heroism embodied by the Übermensch's transformation from obedient camel to creative child is attained by few. In Nervous Conditions , this is certainly the case as Tambu's mother, aunt, and cousin are unable to arrive at heroic status. Nietzschean heroism is not easy to accomplish, evinced by Tambu's long struggle against Babamukuru's mandates, and it is impossible to maintain. After her moment of "overcoming," Tambu explains to Nyasha that she welcomes the punishment Babamukuru orders because it is "the price of my newly acquired identity" (169). This perspective illustrates the danger posed by interpellation for Nietzschean heroism because Tambu depends upon Babamukuru's recognition of her subjectivity in order to validate it. A Nietzschean heroine, to maintain her status, must be in a continually creative relationship with her environment, constantly exerting will to power in a way that resists the burdens and duties of externally constructed values. Although her view of punishment indicates a momentary relapse in her consideration of Babamukuru's presence and desires, it does not negate the previous achievement of Nietzschean heroism, even if it is attained only for a moment. Instead, Tambu reinforces Nietzsche's conception of the Übermensch not as a state of being, but rather a constant state of becoming and overcoming. Nietzsche introduces the idea of eternal return to emphasize the Übermensch as a state of becoming rather than being. Described as the "heaviest burden," eternal return challenges the individual: "This life, as thou livest it at present, and hast lived it, thou must live it once more, and also innumerable times; and there will be nothing new in it ... " (Joyful 270). The eternal return is developed further in Thus Spoke Zarathustra in the section "On the Vision and the Riddle." Zarathustra and the dwarf stand before the gateway "Moment" and Zarathustra asks, "Must not whatever can walk have walked on this lane before? Must not whatever can happen have happened, have been done, have</page><page sequence="10">" Willing Liberates " 89 passed by before?" (158). Yet the call to overcome valuations and to aspire to become Übermenschen seems to contradict eternal return; if the Übermensch has not already been achieved, eternal return would suggest that it never will be. How the concept of eternal return ought to be read - as a cosmological theory or a normative ethical system (live one's life in a way such that one can affirm or will it to recur endlessly), metaphorically or literally - is a contentious, unresolved issue among Nietzsche scholars. But even if the Übermensch as a state of being is not achievable, which any interpretation of eternal return would suggest, the process itself is still affirmable as a continual process of overcoming values and laws. Just as Zarathustra goes over and under in his interactions with Man, so must we overcome external, already-existing values, erect our own values, and overcome those individuated values again. The outcomes of this mutually-illuminating application of Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophy to Tsitsi Dangarembga's Nervous Conditions are twofold. In addition to demonstrating Nietzsche's relevance for postcolonial feminists, pairing his philosophy with Nervous Conditions suggests a new way to interpret key elements of his philosophy. Both of these outcomes are, in their own ways, relevant for contemporary Nietzschean discourse; Nietzsche has not often been applied to postcolonial or feminist contexts, nor have the debates on the best interpretations of Nietzsche's will to power, heroism, and creativity been settled definitively. To disregard Nietzsche's philosophy entirely, based upon the apparent misogyny within his writings, is to overlook his widespread influence and relevancy in contemporary philosophy, literary theory, and gender studies. Like Nietzsche over a century ago, contemporary postcolonialists and feminists desire to break the domination of the traditionally Western epistemologies that posit objective, universal Truth and emphasize binary oppositions like good and evil, colonizer and colonized, and man and woman. Nietzsche's perspectivism is one way that Truth is undermined. Perspectivism destabilizes Christianity's claims to universality, and the Christian emphasis on Christ as The Way is echoed and challenged specifically in Zarathustara's words as well. Although the language of Nietzsche's prophet seems to recall and target Christianity explicitly, the consequences of perspectivism continue beyond religious systems and contest philosophical enquiry itself. One of the challenges that critics have leveled at Nietzsche's perspectivism include the assumption that if perspectivism allows for many viewpoints, which produce a range of truths and other values, then it would also permit a conceptual scheme that counters perspectivism. In other words, if perspectivism argues that all value systems are anchored in a particular perspective, isn't perspectivism itself just one of many? If this were the case, it would follow that Nietzsche had violated his own philosophy by both</page><page sequence="11">90 Amanda Waugh advocating perspectivem and suggesting the Übermensch as humanity's single goal. However, Nietzsche is careful to account for this possibility, albeit with subtlety, in Zarathustra' s remarks to his followers. The seemingly objective statement, "For the way - that does not exist," is qualified by the earlier question, "This is my way; where is yours?'" Presumably, Zarathustra's way not only includes his moral values, but also his very proposal of perspectivism. The same argument used to affirm a language of creativity over a language of domination in Nietzsche's philosophy can then be employed here to combat the charge of objectivity. What appears to be an objection to Nietzsche's perspectivism in actuality reinforces it; even if it is argued that perspectivism is just one of many views, it remains that the counter to perspectivism would be, in the end, also a perspective. Under this interpretation, Nietzsche consistently resists objective claims to ethics and epistemology, even when he appears to make unqualified prescriptions. Still, the Übermensch is introduced as humanity's single goal. After surveying the tablets of other societies, which indicate their culture's demarcations of good and evil, Zarathustra presents the Übermensch as the one unifying goal toward which humanity must strive. The Übermensch appears to be established as a goal for every member of humanity (that is, all men, if Nietzsche is read with misogynist views intact and uncontested). But the Übermensch is not to be understood as a static standard or endpoint, particularly when the prerequisites for Nietzschean heroism are remembered. The necessary and sufficient conditions for Nietzschean heroism include a transition from a camel-like acceptance of inherited values to a lion-like rejection of those values, and finally, the development of childlike creativity through the creation of individual values. Every Nietzschean hero will meet these conditions, but the Übermensch as humanity's goal still should not be confused with an "objective" goal for humanity. Objective ethical and epistemological knowledge claims are still resisted by the Übermensch , whose valuations are predicated on each individual. Perspectivism does not preclude the existence of the Übermensch as humanity's goal because unlike the other "goals" written on relative societies' tablets, the Übermensch creates his or her individual values. The process of becoming the Übermensch and the imperative to do so still leave space for multiple ethical and epistemological "truths." The Übermensch recognizes perspectivism through its flexibility of value at the child stage, which allows for the total freedom of creativity. The relevance of perspectivism for postcolonial feminists lies in its support for the validity of multiple viewpoints. Recent Third Wave feminists are committed to recognizing both diversity and particularity and to challenging</page><page sequence="12">" Willing Liberates " 91 the idea of dualism (Mack-Canty 154). Whereas Nietzsche justifies perspectivism by asserting the nonexistence of objective value and truth and refocusing the creation of value on the individual, postcolonial feminists defend the diversity of experience and perspective because "their social locations provided them with different vantage points and different conceptions of themselves other than those being articulated" by others (158). Perspectivism, while originally emphasizing the need for individuated valuation, can be expanded by postcolonial feminists into an argument against an "essential female experience." Nietzsche's philosophy is particularly pertinent to the recent insistence by Ofelia Schutte and others that Western feminism "still harbor[s] the hope that its own views of emancipation are universally valid for all the world's women" ("Cultural" 59). Nietzsche never directed his affirmative philosophy toward women, but postcolonial feminists can nevertheless find utility in his perspectivism, which confirms the complexity of experiences across gendered constructions. Among the different experiences and perspectives that need to be recognized and affirmed are the cultural hybrid's fractured experiences. When a value system becomes overly restrictive and deterministic by resting on dichotomous "either /or" oppositions, which occurs in Nervous Conditions , there is no space for the cultural hybrid to occupy. Although Nyasha and Tambu both feel the influences of multiple cultures, Nyasha experiences the cultural hybrid condition more acutely, presumably because she lived in England for five years. Upon her return, Babamukuru hopes to make her completely conform to his idea of a "good woman," itself a product of both African and colonial definitions, but Nyasha is painfully ambivalent when confronted with these categories. One of the problems with this construction of identity is the assumption of an authentically African or English experience. As Tambu and Nyasha exemplify, the influences of colonialism make an "authentic" or "essentially" African experience unattainable, if it ever existed at all. These points of view and experience, located in what Gloria Anzaldua calls the borderlands of experience, where two or more cultures collide, have a space in Nietzsche's perspectivism. Nyasha's values and beliefs are shaped by her cultural hybrid position. Occasionally, her ideas of good behavior and values coincide more with African culture, other times more closely with colonial Christian culture; and still other times, they are not easily categorized into either point of view. Rather than forcing reconciliation to either value system, Nietzsche's philosophy affirms the validity and possibility of in- between perspectives and places. The fact that Tambu successfully achieves Nietzschean heroism ultimately suggests that Nietzsche's overall negative attitude toward women may be an internal inconsistency in his works. A closer examination of his use of the</page><page sequence="13">92 Amanda Waugh man /woman opposition, despite his encouragement to overcome oppositions, confirms this suspicion and locates the underlying problem: the construction of essential differences between man and woman based on biological rather than cultural variation. The definition of Nietzschean heroism that I apply to Nervous Conditions is taken from Nietzsche's own works, which are directed exclusively at men. But whether women can be Übermenschen according to Nietzsche's personal views or despite Nietzsche's socio-historical period are separate issues. Nietzsche may have objected to my classification of a woman as a Nietzschean heroine. As a result, one might wonder about my appropriation of Nietzsche, particularly in a feminist context, to which he would seem to object strongly. At this point, it appears that we must choose which facet of Nietzsche's philosophy is to be given more weight: either his misogynist views, or his stress on overcoming value systems and moving beyond artificially constructed oppositions. Why would Nietzsche maintain a seemingly obvious contradiction in his philosophy? One reason could be that he may have taken biological differences between males and females to correspond with culturally constructed binaries. Nietzsche identifies good and evil to be cultural constructs, but he does not view the qualities that he ascribes to men and women to be similarly culturally constructed. Treating Nietzsche's misogyny as separate from his philosophical oeuvre would have obfuscated this internal inconsistency in Nietzsche's writing. Separating the biological male and female binary from the culturally constructed categories of man and woman has largely been a twentieth-century movement, which may explain Nietzsche's contradiction, but does not excuse it. Nietzsche often returns to Christianity's construction of good and evil as an example of an opposition that must be overcome. One value system that Nietzsche does not identify, however, is the patriarchal system. As mentioned above, conflating biological and cultural differences could account for this oversight. But if he had considered patriarchy to be a system based on cultural, not biological differences, and with its own specific ideas about value and behavior, not only would it have to be overcome as per Zarathustra's instructions, but also he might have seen patriarchal values subsisting in his own writing. He places man and woman into an opposition, despite his simultaneous call for overcoming oppositional thinking. In Beyond Good and Evil , Nietzsche strongly argues that despite the metaphysicians' "belief in oppositions of values . . . we can doubt, first, whether opposites even exist" (6). Elsewhere in that same text, however, Nietzsche discusses the relationship between man and woman in a way that contradicts his earlier dismantlement of oppositions: To be wrong about the fundamental problem of 'man and woman'; on the one hand, to deny the most abysmal antagonism and the necessity of an</page><page sequence="14">" Willing Liberates " 93 eternally hostile tension; and, on the other hand, to dream, perhaps, of equal rights, equal education, equal entitlements and obligations; that is a typical sign of a shallow mind . . . (127) The fundamental problem of man and woman is based in a perceived fundamental inequality. The inequality that Nietzsche senses exists between the sexes takes biological difference and transforms it into an argument for woman's inferiority. Admittedly, Nietzsche never claimed to have met his own conditions for heroism to become the Übermensch. His misogyny ought to be viewed as a personal limitation that demonstrates both Nietzsche's fallibility and the difficulty of becoming the heroic ideal. By "unmasking" Christianity, Nietzsche unwittingly introduced concepts and strategies that make contemporary feminist philosophy possible; the perspectivism speaks to multiple worldviews and the multiplicity of truths, and the process of becoming the Übermensch focuses on the necessity of recognizing the limitations and oppression of will inherent in external value systems. Christianity as a superstructure has also been implicated in the proliferation of anti-feminist philosophy, from the anthropomorphic view of God as a "He" to the elevation of Mary, Mother of God, by virtue of her role in the birth of Christ.3 Although Nietzsche's personal misogyny is evidence of his inability to distinguish and overcome a value system, this limitation is not necessarily built into his philosophy. Working with Nietzsche and Dangarembga's Nervous Conditions shows the value of Nietzsche's philosophy for postcolonial feminists. The very unmasking of Christianity, itself a value system that has traditionally privileged the masculine, provides the framework for the eventual overcoming of all oppressive systems, including misogyny. More than just explaining the difference between entrapment and escape in Nervous Conditions , applying Nietzsche in a postcolonial context demonstrates the liberating potential in his philosophy and its applicability to postcolonial feminist theory. As a Nietzschean heroine, Tambu clarifies that will to power does not entail oppression or domination. Instead, she emphasizes becoming over being and demonstrates creativity in language and values. If liberation begins with language, then the study and creation of new post-colonial and transnational texts assumes additional political importance. Tambu's successful psychological escape is an affirmation of Nietzschean heroism, achieved through the creation of values and naming. Through Tambu's determination to move beyond roles, duties, already-existing values, and her uncle's authority, she also escapes the binaries of good and evil as constructed by colonial Rhodesian society. Tambu succeeds where Nietzsche fails, recognizing the limiting function of every value system she experiences - Christianity, colonialism, Shona culture, patriarchy - and transcending them.</page><page sequence="15">94 Amanda Waugh In Tambu' s character, the opposition between man and woman is illuminated as one further binary construction that Nietzsche leaves unidentified and uncontested. But in accessing Nietzsche's legacy, influence, and applicability in a twentieth-century postcolonial feminist context, the focus on gender opposition in Nietzsche's works must be transcended. Regardless of Nietzsche's misogynist views, Tambu meets the qualifications of a Nietzschean heroine, and in the process, elucidates Nietzsche's inconsistency in leaving the patriarchal values in his work unquestioned. The act of will, consisting in a definitive "I do not want to go to the wedding" and the subsequent disobedient act of refusing to define her actions as evil, fulfills Zarathustra's prophesy: willing is liberating. Notes 1. Judith Shklar shares the former view in Ordinary Vices (222), finding his misogyny limiting in terms of his applicability to and utility for political science. Sarah Kofman offers a reading of woman as objective Truth; just as objective Truth has no place in Nietzsche's philosophy, it would follow that women do not either. Kofman' s reading, however, is unable to account effectively for moments in Nietzsche's works where his disparaging remarks toward women are directed at and concretized in comments about his mother and sister. For example, in the revised edition of Ecce Homo, based on manuscripts discovered in 1969, Nietzsche alters an entire section in order to address the women in his family; he writes "But I will admit that the greatest objection to 'eternal return', my truly abysmal thought, is always my mother and sister" (78). The women-as-metaphor argument is thus complicated by Nietzsche's literal relationships with women. Finally, as one of the most recent studies on Nietzsche and gender, Frances Oppel's interpretation asserts that the "apparent misogyny is part of his overall strategy to demonstrate that our attitudes toward sex-gender are thoroughly cultural" and treats Nietzsche's views on women as part of his larger purpose (ix- 1). Oppel's view represents a thoroughly anachronistic interpretation of Nietzsche, in which twentieth century post-modern, feminist thought is superimposed on Nietzsche's philosophy. Ruth Abbey's "Beyond Misogyny and Metaphor: Women in Nietzsche's Middle Period" offers a useful assessment of the way women philosophers have dealt with Nietzsche's misogyny. 2. Pairing Eternal return and the Übermensch together prevents an oversimplification of Tambu's achievement as well; "escape" in this framework needs to be continually affirmed and achieved. The achievement of Nietzschean heroism is neither linear nor permanent - as a process, it is impossible to attain as a state of being; Nietzsche stresses overcoming even individually-created values through the affirmation of eternal return, which requires Tambu and other aspiring Nietzschean heroines to be in a continually creative relationship with themselves and others. 3. Individual sects of Christianity provide different perspectives of Mary, with Catholicism strongest in its adoration. Regardless, Biblical texts are rife with passages that are unsympathetic to women and have required extensive exegesis to make them compatible with contemporary views, from Eve's role in the fall of Man to the New Testament prescriptions for women's inferior roles in the Church.</page><page sequence="16">" Willing Liberates " 95 Works Cited Abbey, Ruth.
