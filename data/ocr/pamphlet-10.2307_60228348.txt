Anonymous Yes, Reader and Why Not Some of the finest gems in the English language have been, as you know, ''by the celebrated writer 'Anon !' " So the want of a signa¬ ture is no reason why this production should go unread. It is also true that some of the most prominent and distinguished men have not proudly refused to conduct long correspondences with writers wholly unknown to them ; and many such anonymous discus¬ sions have not only proved exceedingly interesting to those who read them, but also highly important for the Public Good. So the want of a Signature is no reason why this production should go unconsidered. Therefore, Reader! read on And, more especiallj', as there is a very good reason—one wholly un¬ answerable—why this pamphlet should be anonymous—namely, it is not only desirable, but absolutely of vital consequence to the com¬ munity, that the opinions herein advanced should be judged entirely on THEIR own merits, and you could not judge them thus if you knew who the writer is. If you knew the writer you would place your confidence in him— not knowing him, you are compelled to put your confidence in God, if you have any (we mean any confidence). Whether you like to do so or not, you are compelled to say to yourself, "If this thing is of men it will come to nought ; but if of God it cannot be overthrown." Can you trust in your God? If so, do it! and tiy your very best to honourably " overthrow " what you think is not " of Him." But, Honourably is not negligently ; Honourably is not tyrannically; Honourably is not sneaking!)'; Honour is diligent; Honour is careful; Honour is just ; Honour is kind; Honour is fearless; Honour is straightforward. So never mind about the writer; but Honourably, and for your God's sake, literally and really for His sake, overthrow what is not "of Him." It is for this reason that the writer remains unknown ; and he puts it to the personal honour of the very few who may suspect his identity to ask no questions. If the time arrives that he can do more good by declaring himself he will not hesitate to come to the front, and will no longer remain, as he now does, The Reader's most Sincere Friend, And truest Well-wisher, AN UNKNOWN FREETHINKER. London, December, 1878.</page><page sequence="3">BETWEEN THE BRADLAUGHS; OR, WHY AM I A FREETHINKER " What Are there two of them God forbid !" ejaculates the orthodox reader. We endorse the sentiment, good friend. God be praised there is only one of the kind you seem to know about; for such as he are both difficult and disagreeable to deal with. But there are two, nevertheless, as different from one another " as chalk from cheese." Whether they are of the same family or not we cannot say, but we consider it a great deal more than likely that they are ; in fact, they are probably something like brothers, for " their contentions are like the bars of a castle " (Prov. xviii. 19), and so are the contentions of the Bradlaughs. Moreover, there is another reason why they are most likely actually brothers; it frequently happens that the whole of the family allowance of one quality goes to one son, and the whole of another to his brother. In this case one happy brother—if they are brothers—has monopolisjd all the piety, and the other poor unfortunate only the common sense; the one all the "childlike faith," and the other all, at least, nearly all the " true religion." But the writer knows nothing, and cares little, about their personal relationships—if they have any.* He simply takes them up as public characters, happening to have the same name, but representing, by their published writings, the two extreme poles of religious belief or opinion ; the said writings having, moreover, almost the same titles, mutatis mutandis. One, your friend—Oh! Orthodox Reader—has produced a valuable work, called " Why am * The^Author was not aware when this was wiittcn, that they art brothers</page><page sequence="4">4 the christian's "reason"!! I a Christian?" (John Snow &amp; Co., 2, Ivy Lane, Paternoster Row, E.C.)—at least it ought to be very valuable to you, because it is a thousand chances to one you never dreamed of such a question, much less the answer to it; and it is high time, you knew. The other Bradlaugh would possibly have titled his similar work, "Why am I an Atheist?" but that title had already (at least, we suppose already) been employed by another admirable free-thought writer, Charles Watts (84, Fleet Street, E.C.) ; so he calls his production " A Plea for Atheism," (Freethought Publishing Company, 28, Stonecutter Street, E.C.). The author of " Why am I a Christian " is MR. WILLIAM ROBERT BRADLAUGH. His name must be in capitals, and have a line all to itself. The other is Charles Bradlaugh, of pretty nearly world¬ wide reputation (take him as he is, there is always quite enough of him for most people). And here is this poor little " me ".—going in between these two great big fellows !— a miserable, insignificant nothing!—a plain, simple Free¬ thinker They say that " between two stools one comes to the ground." Ah but one " beauty o' me " is, that I can get up again, and the chief "beauty 0' me" is, I don't want to sit down ; in fact, I should not be myself if I sat down anywhere. I am always ready to stand and chat with any " fellow " till we cither agree to differ, or move on together. So here I am between these two, and I am going to " have it out" with each of them : just^a. little friendly tiff—it does not matter much who wins—and then I shall proceed a little further on my own account. Mr. William Robert Bradlaugh propounds the astounding question, " Why am I a Christian ?" and most astounding it certainly is. Who could have conceived such audacity for, one half of the community are perfectly satisfied that it does not want an answer, and should never be asked, "and the other half that it need never be asked, because it cannot possibly be answered. Nevertheless, he boldly propounds it, as, indeed, a few adventurous spirits have dared to do before him. He devotes fifteen closely-printed pages to his answer. This is how he begins :— - " I am a Christian because I believe in the truth of the Gospel of our Blessed Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ, In that Gospel and in the testimony of the</page><page sequence="5">CANTERBURY TO THE RESCUE. 5 Apostles I find revealed God the Father's wondrous love." And this is how he ends. He quotes :—• " Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ." Then he adds as his climax:— "My firm and unshaken belief in the truth of which is the only answer I can give to the question " ' Why am I a Christian ?" The thing is perfectly splendid altogether unanswerable It carries magnificent and irresistible conviction to the heart of every Christian. " I am a Christian because I believe in Christ." Why, good heavens! it is the aphorism of a genius! Walker, Webster, and Johnson; Euclid, Colenso, and Hamilton, all rolled into one And, indeed, it would take the united powers of all of these to controvert the argument. But the triumph and the glory of it is, that he, and all his hearers, consider it perfectly satisfactory I Well, so do we—for them. But, just in case there is a stray reasonable Christian here and there, a rara avis amongst them, who understands the difference between Why? and What? and is startled into reflection by the sudden propoundingof this "Searching" question, we shall venture to put another—the second, in fact—to which he must find an answer. It is also rather a staggerer, but we shall do our best to soften it off by dressing it in a garb with which timid Christians are familiar, namely, " Tlie birth of Christ—was it from Heaven or of men ?" There! Your Grace! My Lord Archbishop of Canterbury! The great head and chief exponent of Protestant Chris¬ tianity I frankly throw you down this gauntlet! Pick it up if you dare And if you do, give a plain, straightfor¬ ward answer (if such an answer is in your " line"). I followed you on the benches of the same school. You were a " big chap " when I was a " wee one." You're a good deal bigger than I am still, but I'm not afraid! You "punch my head," if you can. I defy you to give an answer And when you and your fellow-Pharisees consult amongst yourselves, I know what you will agree to do. Back out of it! Pass by on the other side Pretend not to hear—</page><page sequence="6">6 UP BISHOP AND AT HIM like the deaf adder. And this is what you will whisper to one another, very quietly, so that no one shall hear—• "Very awkward this very! for if we say, 'from heaven,' he will say, ' How then is His geneaology—in God's revealed iwrd, given through Joseph? and if we say,' 'Of men,' will he not ex¬ claim, ' How then is He begotten by the Holy Ghost ?' and people would laugh, even at us, if we pretended it was of no con¬ sequence." Nay my Lord Archbishop your Faith is you may fill up the proper word ; and your preaching of it is again, my Lord, fill up the word. I dare not, for fear of the quondam Jew, Sir George Jessel, who is " dead nuts " (slang but even you know what it means) on Freethinkers. And,besides, you are a dignitary of "the Church" respected, ostensibly, by my Queen, and most of my fellow-country¬ men. I am bound, for the sake of common politeness, to stop short where the only epithets appropriate are those of profound contempt. My Lord if your creed and your office are not to be despised, answer me You may affect to despise me. I have not your exalted rank ; I make no pretence to such learning as yours; but I am not so very far beneath your Grace in Social Rank. You cannot pass me by, with honour, as you would an irate costermonger, or a combative navvy. I will fight you with your own weapons, and I intentionally provoke you. I distinctly assert you are not honest mentally. You have either not examined this thing, or you have examined it and remain silent. Who was the Father of Jesus Christ? Tell me that, Archbishop and help him to decide, each and every Chiistian, throughout all the world; and, when you have decided, tell me how it is that God Almighty " makes such a mull" of his pedigree? God says (Matt. i. 16) Joseph was the husband of Christ's mother. But He, that same God, says, almost in the same sentence (Matt. i. 18) that, b&amp;fore they were married, she was " with child " That is a bare statement of my first difficulty, and I ask you, as simply honest men, without any fine phrases or mystification—either of which are alike unworthy of honest man, or honest God—I ask you : Supposing Christ's claims to his "inheritance "were laid before any plain-spoken British Jury, such as tried Arthur Orton's " claims," how could they possibly come to a decision First, you would have to prove the genuineness and authenticity of the " Records." What faith can a man have in a " record" which says</page><page sequence="7">FOR SHAME ARCHBISHOP J Joseph, and within fifty words completely and for ever des¬ troys his claim through Joseph. In an age of superstition and ignorance it was a very pretty tale, something for people to puzzle over, but now, in the so-called "great" Victorian age, we have both telescopes and microscopes, and see through and through and all round a mystification. It is now an insult to a man's moral sentiments to ask him to believe that God Almighty is fond of giving conundrums. The Church propounded this conundrum, and she knows the answer, that is, half the men within her " folds" either know it, or refuse to know it, like a cowardly prisoner who shuts his ears lest he liear his doom. But the doom is pronounced all the same. The public—the "great un¬ washed," if you will—have puzzled out the riddle, and they cry Shame Shame on the men who make God a liar Shame on those who limit God's straightforwardness Shame on those who say He is not Almighty, and able to protect His own " Records " through untold ages of miser¬ ably bungling men 1 Nay, my Lord We cry " Halt!" We " shame " you no more; we have done. We are ready for your onset, if you have such a thing about you. Nobody has seen one yet, and that is why, not content with my glorious name— "iowthinker"—which is an offence and loathing in your nostrils, I also shout defiance in your ear, and fling contempt on your office, and your creed. Will you? can you? fight for either?* Yes, " Dear Christian Brethren " (we are not " chaffing,"_ we use the phrase in sober, not to say solemn, earnestness) ' Yes, " Brethren in Christ" (for, go where you will, you are brethren still, and can't help it).

And, by Jupiter we positively can scarcely get ahead for the happy smiles that will go on disturbing our features, and will persist in turning eyebrows up that should be haid pressed down. It is " simply horrid, you know," to have to fight against a woman. Its " nasty !" it is nasty. Must be done tho'sometimes; and is it not "jolly"—"quite a relief, you know !"—when it is all over Happy Mr. William Robert! Dear, good Archbishop We really could not help it, and we do so admire your childlike simplicity, your gentle goodness, your calm contentment, your delightful womanliness, your too charmingly delicious inconsequence in reasoning, and your beautifully naive dis¬ regard for the meaning of words. It is so hard, so posi¬ tively cruel, to be obliged to irritate, provoke, rouse up " such dear, sweet creatures." Depend upon it, we shall not do it again—till the next time. No, hang it! Confound these women Old and young, male and female; they are, except one in every ten thousand, the very bane of a man's life. Always were, from Adam and Solomon, and all " the Lord's Anointcds," down to— well—you, reader, and me. And, what is the antidote? Why! a man, to be sure. And here we have one—no mistake about it. Your hand, sir! and a right cordial shake of it! We know perfectly well that you can " knock us into the middle of next week," and, what is of vastly more consequence to you, you can make people believe you have done so when you have done nothing of the kind. But that is only because you have, and most deservedly, a numerous, enthusiastic, and vociferous following, whereas your unknown antagonist has not only no following, but, so far as he knows, not even a friend, not even "a second." Never mind one or two may turn up by-and-bye, and if they do, that is what we want. We hardly expect to pro¬ duce much effect on Chailes Bradlaugh, but we do hope to bring the Freethinkers to the front. That's all we are working for, in the meantime. If a sufficient number do come to the front, tve shall then go in for victory. And victory means here leadership. Not, of course, the paltry</page><page sequence="9">AND WHAT A MAN 9 individual leadership of the writer. Surely surely no true man would imagine for a moment that that was our aim. Nay but the leadership of the attack on superstition and idolatry, which we long to see taken boldly, yet gently, by True Freethinkers, and not violently, and offensively, as we think it is, by persons who call themselves " Atheists." If the reader does not know who the said Charles Brad¬ laugh is, he had better find out before he reads any more of this. It will not be very difficult, for his Autobiography can be had for threepence at 28, Stonecutter Street, E.C. ; and the man himself may be seen almost any day—almost certainly any Sunday—at 142, Old Street, E.C., if, indeed, he is not " brought before the judges;" for they all know him, and invite him frequently to Westminster, and other places where the rights of British subjects are (sometimes) defended. He says he is " an Atheist"—that is, a man of " extremely debauched and vile conduct," according to Dr. Smith ; " vicious in act, in temper savage, fierce," according to the poet Cowper. Consequently, as British Justice is guided by the opinions of doctors and poets, who never " differ," and never have fancies, this "'vile, debauched" Atheist has been " summoned," time after time, to give an account of his " abominable doings." We almost engage to say this " immoral " " savage " has been "summoned" far more frequently than any man in existence to answer for the " crimes " he has committed. And—by Gad, Sir he's alive yet Alive Good heavens there is not a more strong, sturdy, healthy man, mentally or physically, in Britain !—Really You know What are things coming to Here, in this grand, free country, they have ranged against him—a poor, penniless cavalry soldier—all the finest talent of the Bar to plead against him ; they have lavished untold wealth to make sure his conviction ; they have employed cunning police officers and huge organisations to compass his condemnation. And not in one single instance have they been able to achieve their designs. It The thing is a perfect farce a black and infamous dis¬ grace a gross and abominable insult to the intelligence and common sense of Patriotic Britons Do you, Reader, appreciate the circumstances? you have a man perfectly insignificant, of extreme Here extremely defi-</page><page sequence="10">10 A SPLENDID FELLOW. cient early education—a man who literally filled one of your saddles as a common soldier, absolutely unknown to anybody, and completely inoffensive : the moment that man begins to think of his religion the eyes of the world are upon him, and the instant he says, " I think differently from you, and I mean to say so," he is suspected, watched, dogged like the vilest scoundrel, and all the machinery of the law, the police, and the Church put in motion to com¬ pass his destruction Oh no! my Lords and Gentlemen excuse me I am not talking of what happened " long ago," " in a benighted age," or " during the Inquisition." I do assure you, on my word of honour, it happened here, just the other day. Here in Britain Yes, Friend, in Britain in your Britain ; and I ask you, " What do you think of it ?" Now I shall tell you what I think of it. No I won't. I don't want, if I can help it, to have a " Simmons " on my track. I'm not even a match for a miserable little Vice Society, far less for Lords-Justices and Masters of the Rolls. Nay but I'll tell you what I think of him, Charles Brad¬ laugh, ex-trooper and uncondemned " Atheist." You may suppose that, as we are " in the same boat" with him—at least nearly—that he is a personal friend, and that we are about to defend his personal character. Not a bit We know nothing about it. We have not seen the man over half a dozen times, but quite often enough for our taste; we do not know one of his personal friends, and have no curiosity about them ; we only once spoke about three minutes with him, and that was plenty. In fact, to speak plainly—and he is not the man to mind that—he is not at all our " sort," and we are not at all his " sort." There are many things he does and says that we emphati¬ cally object to, and the manner in which he does the rest we particularly dislike. But we consider that the man's public character is far and away beyond all praise. " Debauched !" " vile !" " im¬ moral !" " dishonest !" Pardon me, good friend we are not speaking about Christian Bank-Managers ; we were talking about " Atheists." And a true, honest, reasonable, thinking "Atheist" is a man thoroughly permeated, through and through, with the most genuine religious principle ; a man who must of necessity be an enthusiastic, far-reaching philanthropist, to the very marrow of his bones. Your</page><page sequence="11">AN ISHMAEL. It genuine, sincere, hearty, stubborn, contemplative " Atheist" is not a religious " Adullamite." That man is an "Atheist" only because he is " in distress," or " in debt," or " discon¬ tented" (i Sam. xxii. 2). (And these are not at all bad reasons, philosophically speaking.) Nay! not "an Adul¬ lamite !" but most truly an Ishmael of Society, despised, rejected, turned out! No wonder, then, that he is a " wild man," an accomplished " archer," who shoots true and to the quick; "whose hand is against every man, and eveiy man's hand against his." Aye but he " dwells in presence of his brethren." Yea even in presence of Judges and of Vice Societies! And " he shall become a great nation" (Genesis xvi. 12 and xxi. 20). Yes such men as your " Atheist" will sooner or later make up every great nation. And such a man is Bradlaugh In all the charges ever brought against him was there ever one of dishonesty, theft, licenciousness, forgery, fraud, murder, or Christian money making? And what is the man doing every day, and all day long coining money rolling in wealth scrambling for power fawning on the rich living in style fairing sumptuously forgetting God Not exactly. He writes a little. What about? About what he con¬ ceives to be the wrongs of " the poor and the needy." He lectures a great deal—Who to Go and see for your¬ self, or if you can't, get the Contemporary Review for July, 1878, where, at page 828, in as slovenly and as heartless an article as you will see in even any Christian periodical, you will find'—without the faintest meed of praise for the man— a cold, cruel, soapy-water account of the miserable people he personally mixes with, and whose condition he devotes his whole life to improve. " There was an unusual number of abnormal people not deformed, as usually understood, but so many of them were ' queer' the proportion of stunted figures was alarming pale wan wizzend pinched very-small-back-parlour-style," and so on. These—My Lords!—are the sortof peoplewho have "Gos¬ pels preached unto them." The first they heard was by a man called " Jesus." Did you ever hear of him His preach¬ ing was so intensely admired that it became the fashion, and his people are now rich ; but they hate all preaching, and detest personal contact with " queer " people; so they hire others to do their dirty work. One of these gets</page><page sequence="12">12 BRADLAUGH V. TAIT. ,£15,000 a year, and most of them get p£6o. You should just see their congregations Not deformed, as usually understood. But Bradlaugh is not hired; his audience, poor tho' it be, pays him. Now, candidly,—remembering God's own " inspired " definition of true Religion (James first and twenty-seventh). Do you, or do you not, consider that " Atheist" a Religious Philanthropist according to the light, which you must acknowledge, jwrGod hath given him? I have said plainly that I do not know the man per¬ sonally, and that the very little I have seen of him en¬ genders an emphatic dislike, although I am nearly sure that might pass away on intimate acquaintance. But the man's public character is perfectly splendid. Honest as the day, straightforward as a little child, courageous as a lion, un¬ bending as an oak, he has again, and again, and yet again, and yet once more—done what Fought the Battles of the " poor and the rejected," " the Queer People," " the-very- small-back-parlour-style." Now, Sir, if you have a heart within you, if you have a faint spark only of chivalry, I ask you, on your word of honour, as a gentleman, how does that compare with the doings of your great Archbishop—a man who has not clone one single thing in this life, except that he has, by good luck, achieved the paltry, personal, selfish ambition of his boyhood, and now sits permanently in the chair (or " throne " is it into which he threw himself when a youth I demand of you Reader which is best which is most noble? which is most honourable? which is most deserving of gratitude, of sympathy, of love, of profoundest ad¬ miration Which, I say, the Christian leader, or the " Atheist ?" We have thus spoken strongly our intense admiration of Bradlaugh—the people's Bradlaugh—th at "fellouf' Bradlaugh for two reasons:—First, we may never again have a chance of doing so as a perfectly uninvolved onlooker; that is, we might hereafter come to be fairly charged with partisanship of which there is not the faintest tinge at present,—and, secondly we consider there is no man in Britain more shamelessly maligned, traduced, black-guarded; so thoroughly mis understood, and so treated, because persons calling them¬ selves men and women " of honour "—" free and inde-</page><page sequence="13">THE PROFESSORS MISTAKE. T3 pendent Britons (God save the mark are so completely "hauden-doon" by their greatest of all gods, "Mrs. Grundy " that they dare not even look at the man, much less listen courteously to what he has to say. But having thus most cordially shaken hands with him— a long and hearty shake, eh ?—let us get on the gloves and clear the ring. Bradlaugh says he is "an Atheist." I calmly tell him to his face that he is nothing of the kind Many many thousands of men have ere now " mis¬ taken their professions ;" he is one of them, because he is an intelligent, sensible, reasonable, and very logical man. Such a man cannot possibly be an Atheist. Here we feel the intense satisfaction of dealing with a man who knows how to handle his weapons, and who when you make a cut at his head does not parry " outside leg," and so let you floor him at once. So our friend (or enemy), at once parries this cut with the query—What is an Atheist then And that is precisely the position we wish to force him into, because now we can get at him—below the arm. We say he is completely mistaken in his definition of the word, but we frankly acknowledge that he has an unusually good excuse for the mistake he makes. For he shelters, or at least, may shelter, himself beneath the wing of an authority no less than the great English Professor of Language, Max Muller! It is indeed presumptuous on our part—but as we are by no means afraid to openly challenge an Archbishop on the one hand, and stand face to face with an exceedingly com¬ bative, hard-hitting Atheist on the other, so we do not shrink from plainly saying that this great Professor has made a blunder, not only inexcusable, but quite unneces¬ sary. We regret exceedingly that we cannot give day and date and quote his exact words, but in his celebrated " Lectures," published some months ago, he distinctly laid down the law—for his word is law in such a matter, and has moreover a very serious legal effect—the law, that an Atheist is " a person who does not believe in the God (or gods) of the State," and if we are not mistaken he actually went so far as to say, that the man who told others about " the unknown God," was an Atheist! (Acts xxiii. 17.) Against this dictum we most vehemently protest, and earnestly entreat those who think with us to do so too,</page><page sequence="14">14 THE REAL MEANING OF "ATHEIST." simply for the sake of their mother tongue, and for the following reasons :— First. It is diametrically opposed to the etymology of the word. Strange to say, the Professor himself admits this, and it can be verified by a reference to any dictionary of the English language. Second. A word with the original, true meaning of "Atheist" is absolutely necessary to the English lan¬ guage. Without such a word religious and theological discussions, which are increasing every clay, will become more confused, and therefore more bitter than ever. Third. It is perfectly unnecessary to change the meaning of the word. There are already at least three admirable words to express a disbelief in the Gods of the State—"Unorthodox," applic¬ able to a man who is only a little unsound, and may be re¬ claimed ; "Infidel," a man who emphatically declares his disbelief; and "Heretic," an active Infidel, a propagandist of another faith. These are three, perfectly irresistible reasons for retaining* and retaining most strictly, the exact meaning of the word " Atheist"—that is, not a man who says r " There is no Jehovah; there is no Christ; there is no Holy Ghost; there is no Buddha; there is no Chrishna; there is no Allah ;" but a man who says: " There is no God of any sort or kind—no 'over-ruling power,' no 'supreme intelli¬ gence,' no ' universal mind,' no ' all-pervading influence ;' there is absolutely nothing beyond or above." Now, it is quite necessary to be able to express the idea of a man in that extraordinary and inconceivable mental condition, because, not only are there persons who believe themselves to be in that state, but, in their eager yearning and " seeking after " God, there are thousands of impatient minds, which, like the long-perplexed child at " Blindman's- buff," or " Hide-the-handkerchief," will throw up their hands and say, "There is none for I can't find it." And, if the simple, plain, old-fashioned word " Atheist" is not to express that idea, another, or some long phrase, must be invented to take its place. We appeal most earnestly to every edu¬ cated Briton—to every one who has any appreciation of the beauties and old associations of his or her mother tongue —to resist this barefaced attempt to seriously injure the community by thus murdering a most useful member of the Queen's English.</page><page sequence="15">THE "ATHEISTS" MISTAKE. 15 But we cannot quite let the matter rest even here. Pro¬ fessor Max Miiller says that even among the Greeks the word was sometimes used in reference to those who did not believe in the orthodox deities, that it was used as a reproach, and we think he inferred that it was used against those whom we now recognise as the pioneers of civilisa¬ tion, the propounders of new, and therefore disagreeable, truths and theories. But whether he said this last or not, it is impossible to deny that modern so called "Atheists" have seized the idea. In fact—although we do not like sayingit—we have long held the opinion that people call themselves " Atheists" simply to create a sensation, to make themselves conspicuous, to force themselves into martyrdom, but " glorying in their shame " all the time, and losing no opportunity of enlarging most fully on all that has been achieved for the public good by former so- called " Atheists." This we have always considered the weak point of modern so-called " Atheists." It looks as if they were forced to adopt what is usually considered a vile and most insulting epithet as a foil to their really admirable and loveable characters. In fact, to put it plainly, it is simply a "dodge," done, we admit, from good motives ; but a " dodge," never¬ theless ; a clear indication of a certain smallness and vanity —sad blemishes in really great and noble natures. And by far the worst of it is they are exceedingly apt to reproach those who object to fight under their colours, as being scared by the opprobious epithet, and in mortal terror of the legal consequences ; just as if any real, true, genuine, hearty Freethinker cared " two straws " for either epithets or dis¬ abilities; and no other style of thinker is much good to any cause. So now for Bradlaugh again. We've been pummelling him a bit, but he does not mind. Not he He's quite used to that sort of thing, and decidedly likes it. He has his answer ready—" Plea for Atheism," page 4 :— " I cannot deny God, because I cannot deny that of which I have no conception, and the conception of which, by its affirmer, is so imperfect that he is unable to define it tome I know not what you mean by God I am without idea of God." But somewhere, either in another book, or on some plat¬ form, he stated this, in much better language, 10 this effect;</page><page sequence="16">16 THE ANALOGY OF POLAR MAGNETISM. 'Tell me," said he, "what God is, where he is, or anything about him, and I will tell you whether I believe in him or not."* Most distinctly, this is exactly equivalent to saying : " I cannot believe in that of which I have no conception. I can¬ not believe in that which you cannot define." We challenge any man to deny that this is the essence, the sum-total, the " complete achievement," of Bradlaugh's argument; it contains the whole explanation and definition of his Un¬ belief, and what he calls " Atheism." Now, let us see if we cannot sift this to the bottom. First, however, remember it is absolutely necessary for " us men " to speak of God in human and terrestrial terms, —and they are very insufficient for such a theme, must often be very imperfect, and never capable of expressing the whole of God. So, also, it must be with any simile or analogy ; nevertheless, we shall venture on one. Tell us, Bradlaugh what is Magnetism We know exactly what it does; we can measure it to a nicety; we know that it pervades, and acts over, the whole earth. We can even go to the place where we fancy it starts from ; but if we go back in twelve months, behold! it has moved away.+ But tell us, Can you, or any one else, define it Can you say precisely where it is, and what it is, absolutely is? And now, as a man of honour, do you know what I mean by " magnetism "? Have you, honestly, no conception of it Have you no idea of magnetism If you say you have none, I give you up, frankly and fairly, as not the man I took you for, because, to say that, you must be capable of the quibbling and mystification practised perforce by His Grace the Archbishop " aforesaid;" and all intelligent supporters of the Christian faith, and I thought you were above that. J * "Let us here say that the whole of the rest of his " Plea for Atheism " is a refutation of the idea of a "Personal God," in which, as will be seen further on, we entirely concur. The above statement is all thai requires special notice from us. + It has always seemed to the writer that Polar magnetism affords a very good means of picturing God in terms-terrestrial. It is an all- penetrating Influence, of whose action and nature we know a great deal, but whose source is constantly evading capture. It is by no means a perfect analogy, but, perhaps, more close than almost any other. t Let the curious reader here puzzle this out ; very few, and cer¬ tainly no so-called " Atheists," can see through it. You cannot deny that which you know nothing about; therefore, no sensible "Atheist "</page><page sequence="17">A NOTION OF NOTHING—'IMPOSSIBLE. I? But, if you admit that you have an idea of Magnetism, I shall try to give you a faint idea of God. Of course, yoiv will remember it must be a very faint one, just as it were the slightest possible soupcon, the merest passing whiff, of something, the bulk or source of which is far far away. And if I give you that, it will be enough for you, because I expect you understand that \ou cannot have even a whiff of that which is not. In fact, you can't possibly have a notion of nothingj* If you have even the faintest and most evanescent feeling, there must be something; and it makes no difference whether that feeling titillates your skin or your mind. If it titillates your skin, you probably know what it is ; but, if it tillitates your mind, you may not know what it is, but you must know that it Is. [It is a curious thing that the idea of titillation arose on the spur of the moment; but a brief examination of it, in passing, will almost answer the whole question at issue ; for, if we are not mistaken, Bradlaugh is one of those who would say that lilillalion of the skin and 'titillation of the mind are exactly the same in essence, because both of them produce "an effect on matter;" or, as Bradlaugh possibly prefeis to say, "mind is only a mode of matter " !—in fact, we rather think he actually does say this. Now, if that be so, I ask him, "Is it possible for matter to be titillated by that which is 'not-matter'?" If it is possible, then 'the ideas that titillate his mind may be not-matter ; but, if it is impossible, then his poor mind can never be titillated except by "matter"—something which acts directly on the fibres of his bod)', by touch, sight, hearing, &amp;c. In other words, the man is absolutely devoid of what is usually called "mind," and has only "matter," which can be titillated by other matter, in which case he would indeed be a maiwais sz/jet.J asserts positively " there is no God," because, for anything he knows, God may be. But "Atheists " fail to see the converse—namely, you are absolutely compelled to admit that which it is perfectly impossible for you to deny. There is no middle course. You must either admit or deny. Either there is God or there is not. It is not a question of definition. You may object to every definition and every statement about Magnetism that you ever heard ; but you cannot deny a Some¬ thing. Moreover, the meie fact that youventuie to say that everybody is wrong, and that you )ouiself can say nothing about it; is proof posi¬ tive that you admit the existence of an IT which everybody is wrong about. Theiefore, it is a case of a reductio ad abmidiim for a man to call himself an "Atheist," and still go on telling us what God is not: and every syllable that Bradlaugh utters about God's not being this, and not being that, stultifies the name he glories in. * This idea may not be new to the reader; but it was to the wiitei ; and it may be interesting to the psychonomist to know that he was never so dislmbed in composing by fits of laughter—fit after fit—at the " notion of Nothing." It is most curious thai, if one thinks it out, there is noth.ng in all the world so intensely comical as Nothing</page><page sequence="18">15 A "WHIFF OF GOD. Now can we give him a " slight whiff" of that which, in default of a better name, is called " God " One is, indeed, sorely tempted to range over the whole universe, and scent the fragrant gales which blow, strongly laden with the glorious perfume, o'er every field of science, indicating the presence of That, which, though not seen, is strongly felt; which, like the unappreciated ozone, insensibly invigorates the jaded mind of man, and carries him on and on to the very utmost limit of human existence, to the extreme verge of human inquiiy. And, in all the varied range of human knowledge there is none so suitable for our pur¬ pose as an even momentary glance at those regions beyond our little earth. The stupendous grandeur, the sublime magnificence, the dazzling glory, the superb mechanism, the calm solemnity, the awful incomprehensibleness, of the universe beyond this little globe strike on the baffled mind of man a dreadful wonder, which leaves him utterly de¬ pressed and crushed, with scarcely breath enough to whisper " Why ?" Why Can we not answer in the memorable words of the poet ?— " What tho' in solemn silence all Move round this dark terrestrial ball? What tho' no real voice nor sound 'Mid all their radiant orbs be found In Reason's ear they all rejoice, And utter foith a glorious voice, For ever singing, as they shine, ' The hand that made us is divine.' " i [Now, Bradlaugh, don't go and cavil about nothing ; I told you it was absolutely necessary for "us men," even in common talk, to speak of God in " terms terrestrial." No reasoning man, when reasoning, speaks of God having "hands;" and no reasonable man can at any time conceive an act called "creation." Even the aphorism, "Ex nihilo nihil fit" does not go far enough. Y'ou can't get even a "notion of nothing" out of nothing. You must have something even for that And, hackneyed as they are, these lines are for ever immortal, because of their intrinsic gran¬ deur and inherent truth.] Reason that's ih. whole and quite sufficient answer When you spent that breezy day beneath a cloudy fky, as you lay upon the bank, you saw the clouds sail past</page><page sequence="19">questions and the answers. 19 athwart a matchless blue. Did you never ask, " Why clouds ?" " Why blue ?" And as you turned over in the grass, you saw the busy ants and tiny atoms each diligently pursuing his own private business. Did you never ask, " Why ants ?" and " Why ant's business ?" And in the evening, as you tickled the rippling water with the dainty fly, there—before you—sank the sun in unutterable gran¬ deur behind his bars of glowing gold, did you never ask, " Why sun ?" "Why splendour?" Or—in another region— when you sat among these Irish and Italian patriots, with the eaole eyes and set tetth, did you never'ask, " Why this enthusiasm ?" " Why this self-sacrifice ?" Or—just the other day—when you stood beside a British mother to help her to a right that even no God ever invented could justly deprive her of, did it not occur to you to ask, " Why this fiendish cruelty?' "Why this monstrous tyranny?" In fact, did you never in all your life try—in any thing, great or small, in " mind " or in " matter," on this Earth, or beyond it, did you never try to carry your reason back and back, and through everything, and over everything, till your reason could go no further If you have not done so, try it; and although your reason stops, you know another must go on. That's God, and you know it! Yes, you know it thoroughly well. Let a man call it what he likes—Nature, a supreme Power, a pervading Essence, a penetrating Influence, an almighty Force, a universal Mind; you may accept no name he can offer; you may reject and repudiate every definition and descrip¬ tion he can give, but that Great Unknowable is, and you cannot—it is absolutely impossible for you to do without it, and you know that that Unknowable is God. It is absolutely impossible for you to resist the question, '• Why ?"* The instant you drop that question, you be¬ come, ipso facto, an idiot—that is, devoid of reason ; and the instant you admit it, you have a whiff, a sniff, a soupcon, of Something beyond. That Something is God, and you say yourself you cannot deny that IT IS. Therefore, my friend even you are no Atheist, Q.E.D. Corollary.—Of course, Bradlaugh says, "this all depend* on the meaning of the word ' God !'

But such an objection, if offered, is a mere quibble. " God " is a universal word for—the Unknown and Unknowable. As soon as a God is." found out," he, she, or it, is qualified. Thus we speak, and always contemptuously, of " the Gods of the Egyptians," " the Gods of the Heathen," " the Scan¬ dinavian Gods," &amp;c, and the last that has been " found out" is a personal God ; an anthropomorphic God ; a God that is "angry;" a God that is "pleased;" a God who " listens " and " answers ;" a God who is " jealous ;" a God who " punishes ;" a God who " rewards." Going back, and back, and back, we come before long to a point where such a God is C/"«reasonable; therefore, his is not the ear in which "they all rejoice, and utter forth a glorious voice." Unreasonable Why surely a child can see that the nstant you say " God is angry," you declare that you have " found out," at least, one thing that is positive about God. Moreover (but in another line of thought), it is folly—nay, actually wicked—of God to be " angry," because he must be what Christians call " Almighty," and, if so, it is both un¬ just and unreasonable of him to allow anything to "anger" him. Therefore, if you say, " God is angry," you not only make an assertion about God, but you have also " found out" that he is unreasonable. Which is absurd. No you cannot get away from the Unknown, and the unknown always is God. As soon as any one " declares him unto you " that God is God no longer, but still God, goes on, continues, is. Now, Bradlaugh remember we told you it was absolutely necessary " for us men to speak of God in terms terres¬ trial." It is, therefore, puerile of you to object, as you are pretty sure to do, that this is simply saying, " God is the unknown and unknowable." " The unknown and unknow¬ able " is only one phase of God, or, as you may prefer to call it, one " mode " of God. But God is not simply a con¬ crete thing which we know exists, but cannot get at, like the contentsofa bottle at thebottom of the sea. God is also, if we may,for the sake of the alliteration,coin a phrase for the occa¬ sion^ discreetthought something which, even if IT be "not matter," produces an effect on matter. But we say " also," because it is not absolutely inconceivable that God may be a fh'./g; although it is monstrously absurd to speak of God</page><page sequence="21">A JUST GOD AND A BLACK NEGRO 21 seriously as a thing like a man But a thing? Certainly it is quite conceivable. We spoke before of " whiffs of God." Now, what is a whiff of, say, musk? You bring the tiniest particle into a room, and for days, and even years, there is a whiff of musk in that room. What is the whiff 2 It is all very well to theorise and say, "the whiff is a nasal sensation, produced by particles of musk, borne by the air to the nasal cavities." We mean it—it really is well to sav so, because the whiff cannot be explained otherwise. But has any one ever seen, or measured, or weighed these, and similar, imagined particles? Not that we have heard of. But, yet, without a certain thing in that room, we don't get the whiff. It is, therefore, reasonable to infer that, without another certain thing, we could not get " the spacious firmament on high, and all the blue ethereal sky." In the meantime, however, we must be content with whiffs of musk, and of God. When any one actually sees the "germs" of the one, we shall have made a distinct advance towards "finding out" the germs of the other; and when we do, it will be God, but not " a God."* Then again, Christian reader we said (page 20) " You call God ' Almighty.'" Here is a term not only terrestrial, but also anthropomorphic. All such terms are only childish—a poetical way of speaking about God. You cannot correctly speak of God having " attributes " accord¬ ing to the usual signification of that word. It is mere poetry to say " God is just," because God cannot possiblv be unjust. It is on a par with talking of Uncle Tom—he who had the celebrated cabin—as being "a black negro." A " negro " must of necessity be black. Of course you might, by a lusus naturce, have a white negro—an albino negro, but it is inconceivable to imagine God subject to a lusus natwce. If you say simply "negro," you mean a black man. If you dont mean a black man, you must qualify " negro." In fact it is only when you mean a negro that is not " negro," who has not negro characteristics, that you give him an attribute. So with God. If you say simply " God," you mean that which is just, if you mean a * Observe in passing how an apparently necessary theory in things purely physical—in mere "matter"—helps us on in Theology, in things which we consider "not matter," and which are sometimes spoken of, in " terms terrestrial," as "spiritual."</page><page sequence="22">22 OUR PUPIL TEACHERS. God which is not God, then you give your God an attri¬ bute. But for all that it is not only not improper, but highly appropriate, and even necessary, to speak of God in poetic language to those who are mentally children. If you want to interest and amuse your little boy, and teach him lessons of chivalry and so on, you " tell him a story " about Jack and the Beanstalk. At first both Jack and his Stalk are absolute realities to the child, and, if he is a highly poetic child, he will ask no end of puzzling questions —" But where was it, papa ?" " Do get me a bean to grow such a stalk," and so on. Poor, dear, little thing what a rude shock he gets when he realises that it is only a story." From that day forward he receives all " stories" with a " mental reservation." But he does not the less delight in them, far from it—they " titillate " his imagination, and the titillation is so exceedingly delightful that he makes no end of stories for himself, and lives in a world of his own, a real "creator" of "modes of matter," as some philosophers would, on their own premises, he forced to admit. And that is precisely what Christians, and all believers in Gods with " attributes," do, and have done from all generations. But, there is this grand difference between the in¬ structors of children in years, and the instructors of grown up people who are children in mental capacity and educa¬ tion—the former are not only careful to tell their children when it is " only a story " they also conscientiously do their best, if they are in any doubt, to find out if it is " only a story," or if it is absolutely true ; the latter are by no means so careful, nor so conscientious, but they have a sort of excuse. It is not difficult to imagine—in fact, we appeal to educationists to say if the following circumstances have net actually happened in their experience.—Some little pupil teacher, a young girl say, is instructing a number of smaller children by reading to them an enchanting fairy tale, and at the close she says, " Now you understand it is only a story, told by way of illustration, &amp;c. ;"—has it never happened that one or more of the little ones have bitterly resented such an idea, and even, in their disappointed passion, struck at the little teacher, "just as if she could know that what wis in a great big fine book could be un¬ true ?"</page><page sequence="23">POl-BOtlERS. 23 Now, those who instruct us in things mental are, in the world, much on the same footing as little pupil terchers in a school, and if they venture to tell us what we don't approve of we refuse to listen, or indeed,—ah, how Very often has it been the case even strike them, for destroying our happy dreams. Consequently, as they have no higher authority to appeal to, they " knuckle down," and go on telling us the stories that we like to hear, and at the same time they cease their own enquiries into the said " Stories " w case they should find out that they were only fables, for if they made that discovery, they fear their scholars would, not only go off to other teachers telling " smooth things." I ut give them a good " drubbing" into the baigain. This is to a nicety the position, not of fifty per cent., not even of nine-tenths, but of ten-tenths, of all the men "in the Church," and in any and every " Chutch." There are many thousands of them who have never thought for one. moment what they are doing, or what they are preaching. Every " mortal thing " they do and each sermon especially is notoriously a " pot-boiler," literally their " bread and butter," deliberately manufactured to suit the public taste, not to enlighten, not to instruct, and, above all, not to " shock " or startle. But there are many many hundreds who have actually thought for half an hour, or a week, or a year—who have put to themselves such questions as, " Who was the father of Jesus Christ ?"—and not, being able to find an answer, have meanly shuffled back to " the flesh pots of Egypt!" And as we know, from 1 Sam. ii. 15, the priests' custom is this —they come while the flesh is in seething (always), with a flesh- hook of three teeth ("church-rates," "fees,"and "collections"), and they strike it into the pan (Churchman), or kettle (Jew), 01 cauldron (Freethinker), or pot (Dissentei), and all that the flesh- hook biings up they keep for themselves. So they do in Nhiloh to all, whither they go thither or not. They cry, " Give flesh to roast for the Priest, for lie will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw" (aye! raw and quivering!) And if anyone objects, they say, "Nay! but thou shalt give it me now; and, if not, I will take it by force." Wherefore the sin of these youths is very great before " the Lord," for men abhor the offering of the Lord. There are, however, many thousands of worshippers who are afraid to resist these sons of Eli, and many who never go to " Shiloh " by any chance ; but, to these the priest's servant (the tax-gatherer) comes, and he "dabs" in the flesh-hook quite successfully—in the meantime</page><page sequence="24">24 AN " EXAM BY THE VOX DEI Yes, the instructors of the People in things mental, and especially in Theology, are mere pupil teachers, who have only just learned what they teach, and are by no means sure about it, and are moreover in " mortal terror " of their pupils. So, instead of teaching them " lessons,"1 they go on deliberately telling them " stories ;" and not only allow the children to " trifle away their time," but even actually romp with them, and thus keep them in good humour, and get " lots of fun " with them. But teachers and pupils alike forget that there will be an Examination Day before long, when both parties, the teachers especially, will be very closely questioned, and will have to yield to that imperious and unbending Board of Examiners, which has always been known to speak with that which cannot be gain-said,—the terrible and irresistible Vox Dei Now Bradlaugh is a member of that Board, indeed, being President of the Secular Society, he miy be called Chair¬ man of the Chief Committee. He is always "getting up" difficult "papers," and has even held some very stiff "viva voce exam's ",of some ol the naughty pupil teachers, none of whom can " pass," and so the wh'ole Board are beginning to say, with its terrible Vox Dei, that the School is thoroughly disorganised, and must be put to rights. Your humble servant, the writer, is on no committee, but he is also a member of the Board. He too has been quietly watching the conduct of these pupil teachers for some time, and he sees that things cannot last as they are much longer. It is just a question whether these pupil teachers will first learn their own lessons properly, and tell the real truth to their scholars after having honourably searched after it, or whether there shall be " a regular shindy." If there is, all manner of " Benches " and " Seats " will be rudely turned over, and lots of " Ink," even the " Red Ink," spilt, and hard, yea even iron " Rulers " knocking people's heads Now that would be a vast pity. Heads would be broken, the floor of the school irretrievably stained, the pictures and models broken, and no end of expense incurred to put it to rights. Moreover, all the scholars, without any exception, would be " severely punished." Reader, you are one of them. So I, as a member of the Board, will just whisper in confidence how you may escape, at least, nearly free. Listen. Join the Board that's all! you dont require to be voted, for you have a right to join it.

We presume the reader to have noticed that when we said to Bradlaugh some time ago (page 26): "Therefore, good friend, even you are not an Atheist, Q.E.D.!" we con¬ sidered we had given him such a " oner" that he would take, at least, a little time to " come round." Possibly it was nothing to him, but he saw we wanted to let off a little superfluous steam, to go sparring around "promiscuous like," and he has kindly stood aside till our little by play was over. But now he " comes up smiling," ready, no doubt, to give us a " knock down crusher." It is a vast pity we cannot stand up to "take it," but, alas the umpire —that is the Devil—cries " Time's up."

We do not believe In any other, but we do moy. firmly in that "imp of fame," the only thing, nowadays, that devils can be imps of, and of that, they all most certainly are the "veriest imps."] Yes time is "up !"—but, before we actually " draw the ropes," we must, as we said, "proceed a little further on our own account," that is, we must give some kind of answer to the question we ourselves propounded, Why am I a Freethinker To answer the question, " Why am 7"—the writer—a Freethinker?" would be much too long a business for the present occasion, and also quite out of place. Yet it should be exceedingly interesting to all of " the orthodox"—of whom the writer was one—a veritable " Pharisee of the Pharisees,"—and it might also be so, in a small degree, to the Psychonomist. If that question is ever propounded, it may be answered then. Meantime, we shall take the liberty of altering the question, so as to enable us to assign a reason for every I that reads this, and shall state it thus : "Why should you, Reader, be a Freethinker?" which will be very much more to the point. Why should you be a j^wthinker Now just think for half-a-second If you are not a Breethinker, what sort of thinker are you? There are only two kinds of thinkers (at least, in this line of enquiry), you must belong to orfe or other. You must be either a. Free or a Fettered Thinker 1 A Fettered Thinker You A Briton Fettered And yet you boast with hollow mockery, " Britons never, never, never will be slaves." You have the accomplished effrontety to stand in the face of enlightened Europe, and call your self " Free and Independent!"—Pharisee !—You stand in the Temple of the Nations, and say : " I thank thee, God,</page><page sequence="27">YOU M'SERABLE CUR 2 7 that I am not as other men are, Exterminators, Unchris¬ tian, Adulators, or even as this Foreigner I am too rich to fast, but I give " tithes" of all that I possess."

In other words, and plainly, the mere signification of the term "freethinker" commends itself to every Patriotic Briton, and without naming one other consideration, I fearlessly call upon every one of you, for the sake of your Mother Country, to join the ranks of real Freedom and not only claim the right of Freedom each for himself, but to be exceedingly jealous and dangerously pugnacious if any one, be it a cat's-paw king upon the throne, a time-serving judge upon the bench, or even a miserable legal sneak, tries even, to oust any of your fellow-countrymen, or women, from that perfect Liberty which has in all ages been the proud boast of every British subject. And now you will ask, " What is a Freethinker ?" And rightly so, for you have not the faintest idea. If you had, you—being, we admit, a reasonable sort of man—would never have treated us as you do; but again, if your reason were of a fine quality, you would have found out long ago. Time would fail to answer your question fully, for it is the same as asking, What a Freethinker thinks? and you might as well ask for an account of all the places the wind blows to Nevertheless, we shall try to give you an idea of the sort of thing a Freethinker is—in other words, adapting our¬ selves to your inborn taste for poetic language, we shall give you a picture of him; and we hope to make it so attractive that you will not only be disposed to like, but to be like, the original. Now listen There is a certain sea-coast town pelebrated for its sandy beech and its numerous schools. One of these is a large one on the " Kindergaiten" system. The mistress often takes the children, who range from four to fourteen, to play on the sands, where they have a good deal of liberty if they do not get too wet. It is most interesting to observe how they divide themselves, By far the greater</page><page sequence="29">THE LITTLE BUILDERS. 29 number set to work digging, and building " castles." The very little ones, eager to begin, are content to stay far up, where the sand is just sufficiently moistened to build with ; some a little older go further down, where they are able to make "lakes" and "moats" round their castles; and some, older still, venture near the great sea, where the sand is so wet they can scarcely " build " at all, and are more given to " canals " and " rivers." And there are a few rest¬ less, inquisitive creatures who join none of these groups, but go popping about from one to the other, admiring and criticising the " works" of each in turn ; and then away they wander along the edge of the sea, picking up no end of " treasures ;" a pebble now, and now a shell, a bit of sea¬ weed next, and then a star-fish, and some of them, defiant of " the powers that be," actually venture to wade in the water, under various temptations ; but, truth to tell, they always " catch it" for so doing. Now, here you have, " in a figure," the religious history of the human " Kinder Garten." The little children long long ago built religious " systems " out of the physical elements they first came to, with just a sufficient moisture of thought from the great deep theological ocean beyond to make them " stick" to¬ gether for a time. These were the believers in Jupiter and Juno, Cupid and Minerva, Pinto and Proserpine, and all " that lot," also in Thor and Valhallah, the Great Spirit, Happy Hunting Grounds, and so on. Then we have an older group who manage to dig down to the actual water of thought, and surround their "structures" with puddles and ditches of it. These are the believers in Gods with " hands" and "feet," Gods who are "Almighty," " Omni¬ scient," and " Everlasting," Gods who are " merciful " yet "devouring," "pleased" yet "repent." They also believe in "heavens" and "hells," in "angels" and "devils," in "mansions" and in "brimstone" But they are decidedly wet, these little builders, only they keep all the wetness outside their structures, as a barrier, preventing alike ingress or egress. Then you have those very much more advanced, in whose religious structures the physical elements are so saturated and penetrated with thought that they will scarcely cohere, but are for ever slipping gently down into the mass of thought that saps their foundations. These are represented by those grand old Eastern religions whose devotees strive in vain to give a definite shape to their " Nhvana." fa^^m^mmt</page><page sequence="30">30 AND THE BUSY BEE. And, flitting from one to the other, and anon prowling off on " his own hook," seeing beauties, finding fault, pick¬ ing up " treasures " everywhere, is your Freethinker ; one who literally reads sermons in "stocks and stones," beauty in Bacchus and Buddah, and God in everything. He admires the arches and towers of the little tots far up the beach, wonders at the holes and pitfalls of the middle group, and watches with curious interest the annihilation of those buildings by the sea. And then off he goes, " ploutering " along the shore, picking up this, "chucking away " that, and, looking cautiously round, he—off with his shoes and stockings, and right into the water he goes And, does he not always "catch it"? and why pray?—be¬ cause he " makes such a mess of his clothes "—his appear¬ ance before others Why can't he do as the rest do Just so! Why indeed?—because he is getting too big for the school, which is not as yet on a scale sufficiently large to accommodate those daring, advanced pupils, with whom building days are done, and the age of fearless enquiry begun. There, Reader that's our picture of a Freethinker, and it will give you a vastly better idea of him than a whole dictionaiy of definition. Nay now don't go and say he is a mei-e discontented spirit dazzled by every new thing he sees. Nay your Freethinker is not a moth in a room with a number of lights, that goes darting madly from one to the other, till at last he falls bruised and burned, never to rise. Nay But he is a busy Bee that doth improve each shining hour, and gather honey all the day from every opening flower. One day he hies him to a garden of rarest exotics, and drinks deeply at each nectar cup; another he takes a " bee-hive " for the rugged hill-side, and sips an atom of good from every heather bell; another you hear his busy music in a per¬ fumed avenue of limes. Moreover, leave him to himself, and he will not trouble you, and you may profit not a little by watching his curious ways ; but irritate him, deprive him of his food—his mental nourishment—or take away his little ones, and the quiet hum of work changes to the threatening buzz of anger, and woe betide the wretch who hears it round his head This is " another view of the same subject." It shows that the Freethinker is not only restless and inquisitive, but has work on hand, and a sharp sting for those who interfere</page><page sequence="31">HONEY AND THE HONEY MAKER. 31 with him. Reader you have your choice of three courses. You may help him—that's what you ought to do. You may " clear out"—that might suit you ; but is it not a trifle cowardly Or you may do nothing—that's what you are doing ; he does not like it. You'll be stung To " a dead certainty " you will; the hhe is a very great deal stronger than you think, and an angry, indignant murmur may be heard, if only you would listen And the scouts are calling in the stragglers from all their various honey-grounds. You may knock one or two down with a wave of your hand; but they are beginning to swarm, and, if they do—Look out! And yet" if you would only take a little trouble to make his acquaintance, you would find him a pleasant companion, and most easily managed. He hates stinging. His business—the Freethinker's sole business in life—is to make honey. Honey! pleasure! happiness, enjoyment, the honey of life for all, rich and poor, the wise and ignorant. You are most completely mistaken if you suppose that a Freethinker makes it his business to " convert " people to his " views." Not a bit of it. He will tell you his ' views " if you ask him, and he \Vill listen to yours if you have any. But his business, his end, his aim, his sole am¬ bition, is to make honey. Honey of life, pleasure, happi¬ ness, comfort, good-fellowship for all, and among all; and especially for those who are "not deformed, as usually un¬ derstood," from the " hawdy daudy " dandy of Pall Mall, to the " very-small-back-parlour style " of Old Street. And —are you a Briton Say, then, what is sweeter, what more dear to you than Liberty? And of all things bitter, what is more repulsive than slavish, cringing. Fettered Thought That, Reader, is the answer to the question : Why should you be a Freethinker But, the Curtain moves Ladies and Gentlemen, we thank you for your courteous, &amp;c, &amp;c, &amp;c., as you know. But before we part, a word of sincerest thanks to the two who have so ably sustained their " parts," "lugged forward," as they have been, for my benefit. To Mr. William Robert Bradlaugh I cannot sufficiently express my gratitude. Not only does he wear a name which exactly "suits my book," but he has a clnracter " to match." An exact and truthful representation of the Christian advocate everywhere he exhibits a quiet earnest¬ ness, a gentle enthusiasm, a kind self-devotion, a con-</page><page sequence="32">i 32 ADIEU fidinor simplicity, that all—Atheists. Freethinkers, and Christians—may alike envy. If he think? I have been " making fun " of him, I cannot deny it; but I do assure him theic is no bitterness and no malice in our "little jokes." We can (there is our advantage) and do heartily wish him " God speed." His preaching comes like jam to the dry daily-bread of his (mentally) small hearers; they don't as yet know anything "nicer," and can't have any¬ thing better for their growth. Therefore, Mr. William Robert it is in all earnestness that we wish you, and all • of your kind, unlimited success. t^ As for Bradlaugh—The Bradlaugh, Our Bradlaugh, " that fellow " Bradlaugh—he is quite accustomed to be "lugged forward," "willy, nilly;" he does not mind, not he nor does he want thanks. After the manner of the " holy Apostle," he wants works. 1 can't say if he considers that he has got any out of me; but that is no matter, be¬ cause we are friends, coadjutors, members of the same "Board." Aye! and'we are Ishmaels both ; we are "wild men," not up to book-keeping; so if he thinks he is in my debt, we Isjimtels trust one another; he will not forget it. But / am bound to thank him all the same. And, so is every "true and independent" Briton, not for the part he has been made to play in these pages, but for what he has done on a far, far nobler stage, a stage on which all the world looks ; on which, eighteen centuries and a half ago, a perfectly new character was introduced, one which has ever since then raised the enthusiastic admiration, the pro- foundest gratitude, of every true and generous heart, a character which contemporary writers seek vainly to dis¬ parage by calling it : Champion of "The-very-small-back-parlour-style." Thus, then, I stand between these two, giving to each a hand of undisguised, unfeigned friendship; for your real Freethinker is a veritable Gamaliel. " Whose soever work," says he, " is of men will come to nought; that which is of God cannot be overthrown." Reader, have you sufficient faith in your God to say the same If so, give a helping hand to each, and so stand with me between the two. (Atheist) " A Freethinker." (Christian)</page></plain_text>
