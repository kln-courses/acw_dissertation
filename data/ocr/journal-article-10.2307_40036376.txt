<plain_text><page sequence="1">Deliberate commission of category mistake. Crombie vs. Ryle PHILIP BASHOR Philosophy Department, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville,AR 72701 ARIFA FARID University of Karachi Abstract Crombie's acceptance of the deliberate commission of a category mistake in his defense of the meaningfulness of theological statements raises a pointed challenge to the phi- losophy of Ryle which seems not to have been specifically addressed in subsequent literature. We review the analysis which leads Crombie into it, including concepts of anomaly, deficiency, affinity, and inadequate notion, noting basic differences in method and attitude from Ryle. We express our own agreements and disagreements in keeping with an overall concern for the preservation of rationality in this sphere of language, finding acceptable distinct contributions to that end from both. Philosophy of Religion 21:39-46 (1987) Â©Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, Dordrecht - Printed in the Netherlands I.M. Crombie's papers analyzing the meaningfulness of theological state- ments1 seem to have elicited more attention to issues of eschatological verifi- cation, falsifiability, analogy, authority, and parable, than specifically to his notion of deliberately committing a category mistake.2 Moreover, attention to the latter notion seems not to have been discussed in its relation to Ryle whose concept is here rather directly challenged.3 In this paper we wish to highlight Crombie's position on category mistake in theological language, formalizing it to some degree and referring it to Ryle, then to conclude with some judgment about differences between them. Our overall concern is for preservation of rationality within these differences, which seems to be in danger if Crombie's language is taken seriously. Crombie finds that talk of spirit - a being outside space and time - is neces- sary to fix the reference of theological statements, admitting, in deference to Ryle, that talk of such spirit as an independent entity is a category mistake. But, Crombie asserts, "how the word is used (and this, of course, defines such meaning as it has for us) in the theological context is by the deliberate com-</page><page sequence="2">40 mission of a category -mistake under the pressure of convictions which require us to depart from normal language-practice in this way." (60) A category mistake is committed, according to Ryle,4 when two expres- sions or proposition-factors which are not compatible with each other are coerced together in a sentence. Such sentences are absurd. They are ab- surd, argued Ryle, because one does not know what it would be like for them to be true. They are a result of logical type confusion. They are incompatible because of some important type- distinctions between them. To place mind in the category of entities and to envisage it as independent of body is, Ryle believes, a classic example of such absurdity, type -crossing, and probably incoherence. To talk of knowing/believing (mental functions) as events and to talk of choosing/thinking as occult acts taking place in some private world parallel to or in correspondence with bodily acts are other examples of this category mistake. Dualists have completely confused basic type distinctions, as a result of which they promote the notorious dogma of the ghost in the machine (so spoken of by Ryle with a "deliberate abusive- ness" which likely produced its echo in Crombie's "deliberate mistaken- ness"). Talk of mind, soul, or spirit as independent of body or as an entity or sub- stance in itself is a category mistake because it is impossible to imagine or to conceive what it would be like for something to be a spirit independent of body. Again, talk of knowing and desiring as "faculties" does not really make sense. These are attempts to describe mind and mental operations in idioms appropriate, perhaps, for the description of body or matter. Category mistake is committed when attempts are made to describe one thing in idioms appropriate to another. Further, Ryle seems to believe that sentences which are instances of type crossings or category mistakes are in most cases inco- herent. They might not be straightforwardly self- contradictory but they entail some inconsistency or contradiction. Whether entailing contradiction or not, they are absurd, and meaningless. In strict sense they are "unthink- able." In the face of such avalanching objections to any metaphysics of pure spirit, how does Crombie arrive at his own position? Why does he choose this particular response? Let us summarize his argument in a series of ten points leading up to his views on category mistake, and beyond it. 1, Crombie firmly rejects the adequacy of an attitude theory. "There are certain factual beliefs which are fundamental to Christianity." (32) 2. He does not wholly reject verificationist criteria. It is not that basic theological meaning can be dependent on specific sense experiences but, more correctly, what is in general necessary for an utterance to be a mean- ingful statement "... is that it should be governed by rules which specify what it is about, and what it asserts about it." (35)</page><page sequence="3">41 3. Nor does he wholly reject possible falsification: "Suffering, indeed, is not in itself a [decisive] objection, but utterly and irremediably pointless suffering would be." (72) Crombie's distinctive answer to Ryle, however, arises from his acceptance of anomaly coupled with his assertion of affinity and description of defi- ciency which we summarize in the following six points, (#4-9). 4. There is in theological assertion, he admits, a subject term anomaly. Both God and Tom are proper names, unlike "the average man," which is not. Yet, like the average man, and unlike Tom, "God" cannot be intro- duced to anyone directly. "The symbol 'God' might therefore be described as an improper proper name" he writes. (40) While in this respect God is some- what like a mathematical point which is claimed to be in space but without size, and somewhat like the fictional Titania who is described as the wife of Oberon, serious theistic claim is quite different since it purports to stand for a real individual. This is the first (subject term) anomaly of theological statements. 5. There is also predicate term anomaly. If Tom loves Mary, Tom is re- quired to do certain things or types of things for Mary and not to do certain other things or types of things. But God "loves man" and "made the world" not in any everyday sense. It is predicate anomaly to claim that loving and making are factually meaningful and true but not knowable in any scien- tifically testable or otherwise empirically discernible way. Also, "the theist denies that there are any situations which fall outside the range of 'God loves us,' or 'God created the world,' and he denies this without claiming an ex- haustive knowledge of all the situations which there are." (45) 6.Crombie admits that such subject and predicate term anomaly is in itself negative in content meaning, but it does, at least, satisfy a minimum rule requirement for meaning by specifying certain formal properties of speech in this area. The outsider may rightly claim that "the rules laid down about how such utterances are to be taken (e.g., that 'God' is an [improper] proper name ...) are such that he cannot see either what its reference can be or what its content." (48) Still, Crombie argues, "formal rules used to de- lineate the object of belief furnish no evidence that there is no such object," (49) and the way is thus left open for more concrete determinations such as those which follow. 7 . Supplementing the rule distinguishing theological statements from empirical ones is the rule that "since the subject-matter of theological state- ments overlaps with the subject-matters about which empirical generaliza- tions and moral judgments are made, theological statements are sensitive to, and have affinities and relationships with, statements of other kinds." (51) By a selection of affinities a conception of the divine is given determinate direction and a certain reference range. More particularly, "God as infinite</page><page sequence="4">42 spirit" can be accepted as the most fundamental positive tenet of theism. Crombie knows that he is here heading directly into Ryle's critique of philo- sophical mind-talk. He knows that it is a logical mistake to think of spirit as a common noun (like "mouse"), nor can it be accepted for theological purposes as merely an abstract noun (like "digestion"). All we actually ex- perience of spirit, Crombie agrees, is adjectival and adverbial: that we are (partially) spiritual beings, and that we act (sometimes) mentally in certain ways. (These are "aspect words" in Crombie's idiom.) Frank characterization of God as infinite independent spirit thus forces Crombie into his admission of category mistake. 8. Yet this category mistake is deliberate. The cause of it is not, like be- lieving in platonized universals, a mistaken logical theory or an illusion in- advertently derived from language structures by overzealous philosophers, remediable once correct grammar is made evident. On the contrary, the notion of God, Crombie affirms, "... can even survive a clear realization of the logical anomalies of such a belief." (57) It can do so because it has a genuine basis in experience . One source is "our inability to accept with com- plete contentment the idea that we are ourselves normal spatio-temporal objects." (57) Even if we are not two separate entities, duality remains, oc- casionally intensifying into an acute sense of alienation, i.e., that we are strangers and sojourners upon earth. (59). Complementing the deficiency so experienced is posited a spiritual world to which we really belong, and an infinite spirit with appropriate plans and powers. Herein lies the main "pres- sure of conviction" which impels deliberate commission of category -mistake for its expression. (There is also the deep feeling of the contingency of this world, 64f.) 9. Crombie provides a final point of logical defense: inadequate notions. "Spirit" in its original expression is not a common noun nor a generalized abstraction. Neither is it in Berkeley's sense, nor in that of Descartes, either a lively, or a clear and distinct, idea. Nor is it meaningless. While we do not know infinite spirit, "there are many different grades of not knowing what is meant." (58) "I claim only that it is extravagant to say we have no notion whatsoever of how the word is used." (60) Thus our conception of divinity contains at its core an elusive, nonprecise but partially determined notion of infinite spirit, upon which we depend and to which we belong. Using this notion in accordance with rules and from experiences mentioned above, category mistake thus becomes inevitable and, seemingly, justifiable. 10. Let us add brief mention of some additional ways in which meaning- ful positive content to core theistic belief is attempted to be shown by Crom- bie. "Infinite" has no less imprecise sense than the independent "spirit" which it qualifies; nor is the "contingency" of the world to which it is addressed any more exact and unambiguous; nor can the arguments of natural theology</page><page sequence="5">43 be "proven" any more strictly; since all these are based upon similar pairs of inadequate notions. Yet, when coming from experience, they appropriately express not only belief but also that religious attitude of worship and adora- tion which philosophical analysis can observe but does not create nor, proba- bly, destroy. Crombie also goes on to illustrate how there may be "... within the space-time world, persons or events whom one is impelled to treat as having a divine origin" (68) of which "God," analyzed above, is the "indica- ting expression." These are parables of divinity, not to be taken literally but not misleading as to the nature of the underlying reality. (71) Due to both deficiency and affinity in which both verification and falsification have roles to play, check and balance occur in a developing spiritual life: "In the process of testing faith against experience one is to grow in the understanding of each by the reaction of one against the other." (72) Our critical questioning of Crombie 's explanations centers on whether Ryle's theory would allow any such deliberate transgression of categories, and if not, whether rejection of it is warranted.5 As we have already seen, for Ryle a category mistake is committed when two incompatible expressions or concepts are coerced together in a sentence. Such a sentence is absurd and probably incoherent. Its words are not proper- ly used. Is Crombie to be interpreted as deliberately sanctioning absurd, in- coherent, and not possibly proper forms of speech, all in the name of re- ligious conviction? Ryle's theory of category distinctions further implies that words and expressions can always be used to signify adequately what they are supposed to signify, and that our meanings can always be expressed in right words. If common usage contains many borderline meanings, these can be distin- guished and made clear. The philosophical task consists precisely in clarifying ambiguities and putting words to their proper use. While not an easy task its results are most desirable. Repeatedly Ryle shows by many examples and admonitions how it is to be done: paraphrasing, translating, using expressions properly, learning logical powers of expression, discovering grammatical form, mastering types and type distinctions, describing in proper idiom. The result is elimination of pseudo-notions, the dissolving of dilemmas and paradoxes. Is Crombie to be interpreted as affirming that in basic theological cases such clarification cannot be achieved and therefore should not be expected, per- haps should not even be tried? Crombie seems to think that in this case we need not grant Ryle's theory of language, or attitude toward it. Perhaps Crombie is not speaking here as a philosopher, or if he is, perhaps he has a somewhat different task for phi- losophy. Does he presuppose somewhat different methods and criteria of clarification: that for certain sentences rules can be given but not paraphrases; that for certain words meanings can be suggested but not indicated?</page><page sequence="6">44 Perhaps Crombie should restrict his analysis to one which merely takes advantage of what Ryle calls "elasticity of signification." Should the theist be satisfied with metaphorical uses, with extended meanings, not directly chal- lenging logical category restriction itself? We see two possible lines for a Crombie defense here. The basic convictions of deficiency and contingency to which he appeals may require (emotively? evocatively?) a more radical language departure than mere affinity alone can express. And, more formally and fundamentally, without the language break indicated by a deliberate category transgression (or "subject term anomaly") the theist might appear to have no good answer to the root referential question: to what or to whom does this metaphor apply? to what or to whom is this affinity directed? Ryle's view of language is very idealistic. Not that it can be satisfied by inventing an "ideal language." It can only be satisfied by persistent efforts with many forms of present language, using much information, many skills, great ingenuity. He seems to think that success at this task is possible, or at least that unrelenting effort in this direction is preeminently worthwhile. For this purpose categories are absolutely necessary, and complete respect for categories is demanded. Does Crombie express lack of belief in such a view of language? The crux of his argument appears to be that where Ryle's theory of language is granted as a working philosophy, factual theological discourse (essential to Christianity) becomes impossible. Perhaps, therefore, we do not need to grant that theory, at least not to respect its authority in this sphere. In Crombie we sense less linguistic idealism, more an attitude of toleration - for inadequacy, anomaly, ambiguity, uncertainty, para- doxicality, even a somewhat defiantly deliberate mistakenness - so long as there is personal honesty and good intentions within minimum meaning conditions. Our own judgements on this issue include the following. 1 . We accept inadequate notion6 as Crombie's most important contribu- tion. Given the actual situation, the unconditional demand for precision and completeness implicit in Ryle is unreasonable because it is not possible to be satisfied. Learning how to deal with our own inadequacies and those of others is no less philosophical. Nor is theology the only relevant applica- tion. Wherever mental growth is possible, inadequate notions must be used if communication is to be achieved. But where notions are not adequate, cate- gories are not clear. Crombie's examination of theological meaning helps to establish some formal characteristics for a broader view of language and philosophy than found in the main works of Ryle. 2. We are also prepared to agree with Crombie that a deliberate commis- sion of category mistake - something like a deliberate act of civil disobe- dience in a wrongly overstructured society - may be justified in certain contexts where the given language (or "normal language-practice" in his</page><page sequence="7">45 words) is too restrictive to allow effective communication of deeply felt ex- periences of overriding interest. "Effectiveness" in this context, however, also requires being subject to that kind of criticizing process for which phi- losophy (e.g., Ryle) has always been responsible, including tests for co- herency and indefeasibility. 3. But we would also preserve Ryle's basic rule against category mistake as of far more enduring value than its exception. If justified as stimulative within too restrictive contexts, deliberate categoreal mistakenness must, in the end, yield to categoreal re- examination and revision. Normal language is living language, and philosophical responsibility with respect to it is a living task for which Ryle's commitment is exemplary. 4. Finally, without presuming the ability to define a complete set of rationality criteria, we believe that the work of both thinkers, despite sharp differences, clearly operates within them, and importantly contributes to showing others how to do so, in the following ways. Crombie shows (a) an appropriate existential criterion, in honestly facing an inescapable ele- ment within the human condition (his basic conviction of duality, deficiency, and contingency); (b) an effective formal criterion, in clarification of rules relevant to communication of such conviction (through anomalies of the inadequate notion of spirit); and (c) a teleological criterion, in responsibly promoting highly desirable results (his reference to the role of religious life in spiritual development). But Ryle's influence on this question is not less acceptable, showing (d) a responsible pragmatic criterion, in demanding ac- cessibility of meaning claims to common frameworks of ordinary experience; and (e) a persistent idealistic criterion, of uncompromising insistence on highest logical standards for good philosophy work. Some reasonable accommodation of both points of view is therefore in- dicated. Notes 1. I.M. Crombie, contribution to "Theology and Falsification," in New Essays in Philosophical Theology, ed. Antony Flew and Alasdair Maclntyre (London: SCM Press, New York: Macmillan, 1955), pp. 109-130; and "The Possibility of Theo- logical Statements," in Faith and Logic, ed. Basil Mitchell (London: Allen &amp; Un- win, 1957), pp. 31-83. Important differences of content, emphasis, and formula- tion occur between the two sources but nothing contradictory, we believe, nor ef- fecting our subject. His references in the earlier paper to some possibly devas- tating criticism, to improper use and distortion of language, anticipate the open confrontation with category mistake we find in the latter. Parenthetical numbers in our text refer exclusively to the "Possibility" paper which can be viewed as the more developed expression of his position. 2. For example in Frederick Ferre, Language, Logic, and God (New York: Harper &amp;</page><page sequence="8">46 Brothers, 1961), William Blackstone, The Problem of Religious Knowledge (Engle- wood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall, 1965), Malcolm Diamond and Thomas Litzenburg, The Logic of God (Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1965), John Hick, Faith and Knowledge, 2nd Edition (Ithaca: Cornell University, 1966), and Ninian Smart, The Philosophy of Religion (New York: Random House, 1970). Richard Swinburne helpfully formulates for his own project the basic theme of Crombie s account as necessary modifications of semantic rules and syntactic rules for theologically used words: The Coherence of Theism (Oxford: Clarendon, 1977), pp. 82-84, 58-62. The major exception to critical neglect of our particular issue is Kai Niel- sen's recent work,,4w Introduction to Philosophy of Religion (New York: St. Mar- tin's, 1983), devoting a whole chapter to Crombie (pp. 148-170), recognizing and rejecting deliberate category mistake as part of a central and independent argument justifying factual meaningfulness. While we think Nielsen's critique, using empiricist verificationism to hasten the elimination of "God" (in both anthropomorphic and nonanthropomorphic senses) from the English language fails to get Crombie right and makes mistakes of its own (and is substantially covered by Swinburne), our attention in this paper is on a broader view of rationality values in relation to Ryle, rather than on the degree to which Nielsen is able to sustain against Crombie "the Flew Challenge." 3. Although Crombie does not himself cite Ryle, other members of the same discus- sion group who contribute to the Mitchell volume do, showing how much Ryle's work is clearly in mind, cf. J.R. Lucas, "The Soul." 4. Summaries of Ryle's views are drawn from standard sources including "Categories," "Proofs in Philosophy," "Ordinary Language," "Systematically Misleading Expres- sions," "Philosophical Arguments," "Theory of Meaning," "Use, Usage and Mean- ing," and, of course, The Concept of Mind (London: Hutchinson, 1949). See Gil- bert Ryle, Collected Papers (New York: Barnes and Noble, 1971). 5. Since Ryle gives us no developed discussion of possible theological meaning, his views on the subject cannot be certain. Brief reflections in his later work on the historical science-versus-theology feuding do not seem to close any doors, showing, for example, "how theorists of one kind may unwittingly commit themselves to propositions belonging to quite another province of thinking" and "how difficult it is even after inter-theory litigation has begun, to realize just where the 'No Trespassing' notices should have been posted," Dilemmas (Cambridge: University Press, 1954, 1966), p. 7. 6. This is our term compressing what Crombie says about theological notions with his numerous other comments about their elusiveness, their lack of clear or precise sense, their character as sketch map or symbol, often being unimaginable or even inconceivable. He uses the especially nice example of being dissatisfied with one's written sentence and seeking a correct version which cannot now be conceived but would certainly be recognized and welcomed if once given. (66) (Nielsen thinks to counter this example by having such feeling "gradually emerge" - presupposing an inexplicable beginning of it - and "known in general" - requiring an intuitive- deductive application of it - while its use as analogy would fail due to lack of [the essentially impossible] observable contrast between this world and some other, op.cit., p. 157.)</page></plain_text>
