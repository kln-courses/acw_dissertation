Entering a region devoid of malaria and in some cases with geologically complex landforms, the Austronesian colonists, who arrived about 1000 BC, developed specific trends of the Lapita Cultural Complex, which can be characterized as a regional Southern Province. I first present a general background of the Lapita period in New Caledonia, focussing on chronology, geo- graphical spread and the major characteristics of the postulated Southern Province. This allows the identification of cultural devel- opments internal to the Lapita period of New Caledonia that are significant for understanding changes and relationships between the different Lapita Provinces. Discussion mainly points to sources of cultural origin, rates of first settlement and regional transforma- tions, and local relations between the islands. Introduction In his pioneering work on the Lapita spread, Roger Green (1979a) correctly pointed out the major differ- ences visible in the ceramic material between a western region, comprising the Melanesian chain, and an eastern region, formed by Fiji and West Polynesia (Kirch 1997). Subsequent studies have since refined this picture, spe- cially in northern Melanesia, with the distinction of a Far Western or Early Lapita (Anson 1983, Summerhayes 2000). For southern Melanesia, the picture was until recently ambiguous, with a poorly understood concept of Lapita as a possible - but not certain (Garanger 1972) - founding culture. In New Caledonia, its characteris- tics were unclear, with proposals of a pre-Lapita settle- ment of the archipelago by pottery-making people (Galipaud 1992a), and of dentate-stamped pottery pro- duced for over 1500 years (Frimigacci 1999) without any visible changes in decoration motifs (Galipaud 1992b). In the last few years the local Department of Archaeology has initiated new studies on the Lapita sites of New Caledonia. We have aimed to better understand the phenomenon from local and regional perspectives, in order to evaluate the importance of this part of the chronology to Département Archéologie, Service des Musées - Nouméa, New Caledonia the overall prehistory of the archipelago (Sand 1995a, 1996a). Excavations on recently discovered sites, as well as new excavations of known sites, have led to a réévalua- tion of the Lapita period in this part of Remote Oceania, with the study of a large corpus of ceramic and non- ceramic material, new sets of datings and a refinement in the analysis of the economic characteristics (Sand 1996b). To further refine Kirch's (1997) proposal of a "Southern Lapita Province", I have tried to individualize local speci- ficities (Sand 2000), necessarily leading to a reappraisal of the Lapita phenomenon in this region. This paper compares the Lapita data from New Caledonia with its regional neighbours to the north and the east, in order to see what similarities and differences can be identified through the archaeological results. I first outline the major characteristics of the "Southern Lapita Province", focussing on problems of settlement and expansion, and the major characteristics of the period, as identified in New Caledonia. I then turn to regional comparison, or the meaning and demise of Lapita pots in a wider perspective. This will, I hope, make the best use of the data from this southern end of the Lapita expansion in Remote Oceania. The "Southern Lapita Province": an overview Archaeologists have long recognised the importance of the crossing of what could be called the "Malaria line", in the south of Vanuatu. Entering a region devoid of this disease, the Lapita colonists found themselves also con- fronted with a particular landmass in the most southern large island of Melanesia, the "Grande Terre" of New Caledonia. The complex geological and natural charac- teristics of the main island are due to its long history as a fragment of Gondwanaland (Paris 1981). Its long isola- tion had led to the development of a peculiar set of endemic fauna and flora, scattered on diversified types of landscapes (Morat et al. 1981). The lagoon, the most extensive of the entire Pacific and in some areas over 15km wide, had nothing in common with the small reefs of Vanuatu for example. Combined with the position of the archipelago south of the tropical zone (with possible cold weather periods and regular long droughts), these two important local characteristics - healthy environ- ment and peculiar landscapes - must have led to new adaptation strategies from the very beginning of the first 65</page><page sequence="2">Figure 1 . Position of the Lapita sites discovered in New Caledonia. Austronesian settlement phase. Although not discussed in this paper, this might explain the particular economic picture appearing in recent studies of New Caledonia's Lapita sites, with few endemic terrestrial fauna remains (Balouet and Olson 1989) and particular types of fish catches (Leach, pers. comm. 1997). Chronology The latest results obtained on different Lapita sites have dated more accurately the period of production of dentate- stamped decorated vessels in southern Melanesia, which I recognize as the only cultural marker in the New Caledonian archipelago of a Lapita occupation. There are now over 75 14C dates from this period, firmly placing its limits between a start around 1 100-1050 BC and an end no later than 800-750 BC (Sand 1997, 2000). The first settle- ment of Southern Melanesia falls chronologically midway between the Bismarcks and Western Polynesia. These results are in marked contrast to the supposed 1500 years of Lapita presence proposed in recent papers (Galipaud 1996, Frimigacci 1999). Although not discussed here, I am convinced that a short Lapita period of around 300 years has major implications for the meaning of the phenomenon from a social perspective (Sand in prep.). Spatial spread and local site developments With such a short period, defined only by 14C dates, the significance of minor dating differences must not be over- emphasized. Nevertheless can we point out some trends in site chronologies. Recent datings on a classic Lapita site in Maré island, in the Loyalties, have given a first settlement result (3 dates) around 1050 cal BC (Sand, et al in press). This brings the picture for the east of the archipelago (the closest to southern Vanuatu) in parallel to the earliest Lapita sites of the Grande Terre (WKO013A and WBR001 (Sand 1997, 1998a)), and before the first dated settlement of southern sites like St Maurice-Vatcha (Sand 1999c), about one century later. These results suggest that the absence of classic large Lapita sites in nearby southern Vanuatu has probably more to do with the complex local tectonic history of that archipelago than with historical avoidance or non-settlement. The New Caledonian Lapita sites were linked together by regular ties, as is shown by the importing of pots and stone tools from the Grande Terre to the Loyalty Islands and Ile des Pins. The major sites excavated to date - Kurin (LMA023), Lapita (WKO013A), Nessadiou (WBR001), St Maurice-Vatcha (KVO003) - are not intermittent settlements (Fig. 1). On the contrary, it is clear from the sediment formation and from sets of con- 66</page><page sequence="3">Figure 2. Example of carinated vessel with the two levels of dentate-stamped motifs (drawing K. Coote). trolled dates in stratigraphie order that these sites were permanent occupations for at least two to three centuries, without any sign of abandonment during this period. This might not be the case for other, less rich and possi- bly slightly more recent sites with only a few Lapita sherds present (Galipaud 1988, Sand and Ouetcho 1992, 1993; Sand 1995b, 1998b). These could have been occa- sional camps for economic activities (fishing, resource exploitation etc.). We thus seem to have a first period of rapid settlement (less than one century) on some major locations, each separated by about 100-200 km, along with the founding of less permanent sites. This continues until the demise of Lapita pots. In this general synthesis, it must be remembered that to date the situation on the east coast of the Grande Terre remains poorly known, as only one classic Lapita site has been discovered on the southern point (Sand et al sub.). Major characteristics of the Southern Lapita kit Here I point to important characteristics of Southern Lapita from a regional perspective, for use in the second part of the paper (for a larger review, see Sand 2000). Ceramic forms. Ceramic production during the Lapita period was characterized by three major types of pottery: undecorated or lip-notched globular pots, paddle- impressed lightly carinated "Podtanean tradition" ware, and finally the complex Lapita forms with dentate- stamped or incised patterns. The Lapita wares can be subdivided into five typolog- ical forms: carinated pots with an out-curved rim and a partially raised shoulder under the body part (by far the most common type), flat bottom dishes, flat or lightly rounded bottom dishes with a pedestal, ovoid pots with incurved rims, and carinated vessels with composite rims and lids (Sand 1999b). Diameters vary for each form, with minima between 20-25cm and maxima over 60cm (Sand 1999a, Siorat 1999). One of the local characteris- tics of the carinated pots is the nearly systematic pres- ence, over the main carination angle, of a parallel clay band, that forms a raised angle. Ceramic decoration. Basically, the Lapita design in New Caledonia can be characterized as one central dec- orative band, with a complex repetitive motif, sur- rounded by sets of parallel friezes with variable designs (Fig. 2). The preliminary inventory of the major deco- rated sherds from the excavated sites, as well as the dis- covery of the nearly complete pots on site WK013A 67</page><page sequence="4">Figure 3. Location of the four proposed Lapita Provinces, the Kava homeland and the prehistoric distribution oiRattus praetor (after Spriggs 1997, White et al 2000). (Sand, et al. 1998), and more recently on other sites, have helped to divide the Lapita motif inventory into about 10 major categories for the central band, varying in complexity but adhering to the same principles (Sand 1996b). These categories can be subdivided into geo- metric designs and stylized anthropomorphic representa- tions (Sand 1999a). Three dimensional nubbins and clay bands are very rare: some carinated pots are decorated with vertical strips either of applied nubbins or clay bands pierced of a series of small holes. Certainly the most important new data from ongoing studies is the indication, for the first time, of a chronological evolution in design motifs, iden- tified by S. Chiù for site WKO013A of Lapita (pers. comm. 1999). In New Caledonia there is a slow transfor- mation of the design inventory and of the clay composi- tions of the pots over about 300 years, and not a static corpus that suddenly ceased production (Galipaud 1992b: 189). Non-ceramic material. The number of non-ceramic items has been greatly augmented during the last decade, helping to better define local characteristics (Sand 2000, 2001). Adzes are mostly dark-green in color, long with a piano-lateral section as well as flat-faced with a lenticu- lar cross-section. A large number of rings, mostly of Conus, Trochus and Tridacna, is present in all the sites: some of these are decorated with incisions or dentation marks. Pendants are represented by rounded beads as well as short rectilinear units with two holes. Fishhooks are rare and of particular forms not found in later con- texts. Finally, a whole set of stone, shell and coral tools have been identified. Data from the Southern Province in regional perspective What can the data of the previous section tell us in a wider regional picture? The somewhat isolated position of populations in the Southern Lapita Province probably placed them in a kind of conservative situation, like a relic society, keeping longer some founding cultural char- acteristics of Western Lapita, that evolved rapidly in the more inter-connected Lapita groups to the north. At the same time, the development internal to the Lapita period of New Caledonia as part of the dynamics of a founding society, compared to those of the other Provinces of the region, should help identify trends that shed light on some of the key points of the Cultural Complex. In this part, I will try to identify some of these points. Directions and timings of the Lapita settlement in Remote Oceania The chronology of Lapita formation in the Bismarck Archipelago and spread into Remote Oceania is still a matter of debate. In the last few years, different models, with related proposals of dates, have been published (Kirch and Hunt 1988; Spriggs 1990). One of the most important is probably the idea of a step by step settle- ment of the South- Western Pacific by Lapita sailors (Fig. 3). Getting away from a rather instantaneous settlement of the whole area (Kirch 1997), the latest image is one of succeeding steps towards the east (Specht and Gosden 1997; Sand 1997; Anderson and Clark 1999; Burley et 68</page><page sequence="5">al. 1999). Dates from the Lapita sites of the Melanesian part of Remote Oceania indicate a north to south move- ment from the south-east Solomons, first settled around 1200 BC (Green 1991), to Vanuatu and New Caledonia. The recent dates from the Loyalty Islands definitely con- firm this direction of settlement (Lynch 1999) and dis- prove, in my view, the idea of a Lapita settlement in New Caledonia directly from the Solomons. Clearly, the dis- persal was through the Vanuatu archipelago, even if in the southern part of this archipelago no large Lapita site has been found to date (Spriggs 1997; Bedford et al. 1998). Austronesian colonizers reached the southern tip of Melanesia between 1100 and 1000 BC, which con- firms that they were in central Melanesia - about 1200 km to the north - at least a century before. D. Burley has recently hypothesized that the early dates for New Caledonia might be due to the "old wood" effect (Burley et al. 1999), but I still believe that the general starting date proposed is correct, for reasons discussed later. Relations between the central and northern parts of Melanesia during Lapita times have been characterized as regular (Green 1996; Green and Kirch 1997), identi- fied archaeologically for example by the inflow of obsid- ian (mostly from Willaumez Peninsula) to the south-east Solomons (Sheppard 1993). There are fewer data on relationships farther south at present. Although some obsidian flakes from Kutao/Bao have been found in Lapita sites of New Caledonia (Sand and Sheppard 2000), their low number has nothing in common with the thousand of grams found in the Reef/Santa Cruz region. It thus appears that the links and relationships of the first settlers of New Caledonia (and probably southern Vanuatu) did not extend on a regular basis to the Solomons. The presence of some Lapita sherds of possi- ble "Grande Terre" origin in the northern Vanuatu site of Malo (Dickinson 1971) marks probably the largest extent of the southern relations sphere during the early period. These relatively extensive early links may have rapidly split into several different ones covering more restricted geographical areas. This proposed picture emerges from the dispersal history of kava in the Pacific. Botanical studies have shown that kava {Piper methys- ticum) was first domesticated in northern Vanuatu, possi- bly on Santo Island (Lebot et al. 1992). If Kirch is cor- rect in hypothesizing that the first Lapita settlers came to Fiji and Western Polynesia with the root (Kirch 2000:219), then this domestication must have taken place between 1200 and 950 BC at the latest. By contrast all the data confirm that kava was only introduced during the last millenium in southern Vanuatu from the east (Bonnemaison 1986) and was never accepted in New Caledonia. As a parallel, recent studies have shown the spread of Rattus praetor up to Central Vanuatu and Fiji possibly during Lapita times, but not to southern Vanuatu and New Caledonia (White et al. 2000). The absence of a Lapita period introduction of kava and Rattus praetor to southern Melanesia might be a sign of the existence, already around 1000 BC, of two major interaction spheres, as also hypothesized through linguistic studies (e.g. Lynch 1999) (Fig. 3). The first sphere - or maybe part of it - in central Melanesia was at that time the nursery for the future Eastern Lapita complex. The sec- ond sphere comprised southern Melanesia, developing local trends and creating the "Southern Lapita Province". The consequence of this proposed regional pattern was probably that, by the time of the first discovery of west- ern Fiji, links between central and southern Melanesia had already attenuated, and the provinces were evolving in different directions. If Fiji was really discovered and settled at or after 950 cal BC (Anderson and Clark 1999), it means that a period of about 200-250 years of local development of the Lapita Cultural Complex in central Melanesia had already passed before the Lapita spread towards the east. During this long time period, represent- ing between 8 and 10 generations, there was ample time for local evolution. If we keep the idea of a settlement of Fiji-West Polynesia coming from the immediate South- East Solomon/North Vanuatu region (see Anderson and Clark 1999 and Summerhayes 2000 for discussion), then future studies will identify the local evolution of Lapita in that area, similar to those known today for northern as well as southern Melanesia. This cannot at the moment be documented archaeologically (Green 1976, 1991). Now that Kirch (1997), Summerhayes (2000) and Chiù have independently shown the existence of chronological evolution in Lapita in the Bismarck Archipelago and in New Caledonia, we can postulate the same type of phe- nomenon in between. On this basis, we can expect the presence around 1000-900 BC somewhere in central Melanesia of pottery traditions ancestral to the Lapita types found in the earliest Fijian sites (Mead 1973), with special pottery forms, motif distributions on the wares and the regular presence of the particular three dimen- sional design elements so characteristic of Eastern Lapita, but generally uncommon in island Melanesia (Fig. 4). The Sinapupu site of Tikopia, founded around 900 BC (Kirch and Yen 1982), might be one of these late Lapita sites of the region: the dates and the nature of the Kiki ware fit nicely in this overall picture. This conclu- sion would explain the marked differences seen between the western and eastern Lapita complex. Looking at the differences visible in Fijian dentate-stamped material, rapid evolution from this founding cultural set occurred from the very beginning of Lapita settlement in Western Fiji, on a scale that present archaeological studies have not clearly measured.1 In this perspective, what can be seen through the New Caledonian data is a profound evolution, in the Eastern Lapita design organisation, away from the very first step of motif construction found in Far Western, Western and Southern Lapita: one or two complex central bands with surrounding friezes. The general patterning of motifs in 1 . One sign of rapid local changes is the presence of flat bot- tomed dishes very similar to Reef/Santa Cruz wares (Green 1978, Parker 1981) in Viti Levu Lapita sites (e.g. Birks and Birks 1973, Davidson et al 1990), but not in Eastern Fijian sites (e.g. Best 1984). 69</page><page sequence="6">Figure 4. Eastern Lapita pots, and sherds with the characteristic three dimentional nubbins and clay bands (after Poulsen 1987, Birks and Birks 1973, Sand nd). Figure 5. Comparison between Lapita carinated pots from the (a) Western, (b) Southern and (c) Eastern Provinces (after Green 1976, Sand 1999a, Kirch 1988b). Eastern Lapita is more simple, with successions of more or less open bands, in striking opposition to the Western pattern of a main central motif bounded by thinner friezes. When looking at the reconstruction of pots from Fiji-West Polynesia (Birks and Birks 1973; Poulsen 1987; Davidson et al. 1990; Kirch 1988b; Burley 1998; Sand 1993), it appears that it is not merely the motifs that change (although R. Green has shown that specific motifs were produced in the Eastern Lapita region (1978)), but far more the way the patterns are put on spe- cific pot forms. The similarities identified by Summerhayes between late Western Lapita and Classic Eastern Lapita motifs, comprising mostly West Polynesian sites (2000:164-166), although supported by design comparison, seem in my experience to be less certain when pottery forms are taken into account: the pots with their decorations do not look the same between Island Melanesia and Fiji-Tonga around 900-850 BC (Fig. 5). Apart from dentate stamping, the incised motifs, widely shared in Island Melanesia but rare in West Polynesian Lapita (Poulsen 1987, 11:135; Burley, pers. comm. 1999), can be used to test this idea. These differences are also visible in other types of material. For example, there is at present no indication of the existence of the long unit shell ornaments in any classic Melanesian Lapita site, while there are no partic- ularly 'Melanesian' Lapita fishhooks in Eastern Lapita sites (Sand 2000). If continued contacts had been main- tained, of the sort proved for the first period of settle- ment in east Polynesia (Weisler 1997), we should expect not only "information exchange" (Summerhayes 2000:233) but also more archaeological material from Melanesian origin than is found in Eastern Lapita sites (Green 1996; Kirch 1988a). In fact, there seems to be a consensus amongst archaeologists that apart from a few stones and pots, the vast majority of artefacts are pro- duced in the local area (Davidson 1979; Best 1984; Dickinson et al. 1996; Shutter et ai 1994). This rein- forces the hypothesis, I feel, that the eastern Lapita Complex originated not from a wide area but from a restricted area, which had already culturally evolved pro- foundly since the Classic Western period. If we accept that the Lapita motifs were not only present on pots but also on other items like tattooing and barkcloth (Green 70</page><page sequence="7">Figure 6. Comparison between Lapita dishes from the (a) Far Western, (b) Western, (c) Southern and (d) Eastern Provinces (after Kirch 2000, Summerhayes 2000, Green 1978, Sand 1996b, Poulsen 1987, Kirch 1988b). 1979b), possible similarities in motif inventories - as Summerhayes (2000) has identified between Late Western Lapita and West Polynesian Lapita - might have more to do with a widely shared set of simple designs (contrary to Summerhayes' first observations, as data from the Southern Province now show) than with movement of ideas (Fig. 6). Lapita pots for what use? The environmental particularities of Southern Melanesia certainly had consequences for human behaviours. Settlement strategies in the malaria-free region of southern-most Vanuatu and New Caledonia between 1100 and 1000 BC must have been unusual for Austronesian societies. For the first time, instead of having a high death rate, especially in children, as experienced in most of the tropical region, the coloniz- ers had to deal with an un-preceded population growth rate. This major change in the basic form of social life unquestionably had consequences on the speed and organization of the Lapita spread in New Caledonia, as well as on the rate of change that the founding groups were ready to accept.2 This spread seem on archaeolog- ical grounds to have been rapid, with the establishment of permanent hamlets from the beginning of first dis- covery, occupied throughout the period, in particularly favorable settings (Frimigacci 1980; Sand 1996b). Possible non-permanent sites are characterized by low frequency of dentate stamped Lapita sherds and are sit- uated in less favorable environments (Sand 1995a). The absence of data for the east coast of the Grande Terre does not allow a complete picture, but it appears that in the New Caledonian archipelago there was a network of some major large and permanent Lapita hamlets, linked together by formal exchange relationships. All the large sites (Boirra (NKM001), Lapita (WKO013A), Nessadiou (WBR001), Vatcha (KVO003), Kurin (LMA023), Hnaeo (LLI002)) were abandoned at the end of the Lapita period, with new habitations develop- ing nearby. 2. P. White (pers. comm. 2000) has raised the point that a group with numerous young people would be more ready for cultural changes - pushed by the younger part of the population - than a group with limited demographic repro- duction, where cultural stability appears more vital. 71</page><page sequence="8">Figure 7. Lapita pots from (a) New Caledonia and (b) Tonga (from Sand 1996b, Kirch 1988b, Burley 1998). This picture is in marked contrast to what seems to be identified in Fiji, where most of the Lapita sites have been characterized as possible non-permanent transient camps during the first phase of exploration (Best 1984; Clark 2000). Remembering that the settlement of Fiji- West Polynesia is another case of colonization in a malaria free environment, from a Melanesian area where malaria is present, we should expect the same pattern of site formation between the south and the east. At present, more relationships have been identified between the north and the east (Anderson and Clark 1999), with a comparable spread of dates around 900-700 BC in the two regions. This is somehow unexpected and difficult to explain, as one zone is malarial and the other is not. Future studies will probably give clearer answers to questions of varying settlement strategies during Lapita times, but I suspect that part of the differences visible at present between the south and east provinces might be due to a shift, before the Fijian colonization or very early in Fiji itself, of the fundamental "meaning" of Lapita pottery, or to say it differently, of the way the Austronesian people symbolically considered and used the dentate stamped pots. Scholars have already pointed out the important difference in amount of decorated sherds between the western sites (between 20% and 50%) and the eastern sites (mostly less than 15%- 5%). At the same time, ongoing analysis seem to confirm the idea of a very short period of Lapita production in Fiji- 72</page><page sequence="9">West Polynesia (Burley et al 1999), as I had proposed some years ago (Sand 1992), strengthening the idea that dentate stamped pots were of marginal significance in Eastern Lapita societies. All this might be due to a change of the symbolic functions and meanings of the Lapita pots in the Eastern Province, in a bottle neck evo- lution of the ideas at work in the different parts of the Melanesian chain (fig. 7). But what were the Austronesians in the non-permanent Lapita sites of Fiji doing with these fragile non-utilitarian pots in simple camps? Future studies might show that only a handful of decorated pots was carried to these sites at each stay. The hypothesis of a shift in symbols related to the dentate stamped pots underpins the existence of different mecha- nisms under way in each Province at the end of the Lapita period, with divergent reasons for the demise of the dentate-stamped pots. Although the fade-out of Lapita in the whole region seems to occur concurrently, I am not sure if this is not due more to calibration curves than historical reality. Future research might show, over such a vast area, slight differences in the end of Lapita between sites and archipelagoes, demonstrating unre- lated evolutions (Bedford and Clark 2000). This last point brings me to a wider questioning on the way Lapita wares are studied. Most of the time con- fronted by rather badly preserved sets of ceramic assem- blages, archaeologists cannot go further than reconstruct often incomplete motifs, shapes and typological forms. The Lapita assemblage is considered as a whole, charac- terized primarily by the dentate decorations. In some Bismarck archipelago sites, a second step has been achieved, by identifying some relation between special motifs and special forms. This is for example the case of the elongated faces, which seem in the Early or Far Western Lapita to be mostly present on flat bottom dishes with pedestal feet (Kirch 1997:139). The good conservation of Lapita deposits in New Caledonia may allow for a third step in the distinction: that of possible differences in meaning and/or uses. The more than 150 Lapita decorated pots that can be nearly completely reconstructed show a remarkable variety of sizes, with the same form having diameters ranging from less than 25cm to more than 60cm. I feel that, even if these pots are morphologically similar, their amazing difference in size and weight reflects a difference in use. This might also be the case between carinated pots and flat bottom dishes, that we probably associate too much because of the designs. A clear distinction in the way these two types of ware were "disused" can for example be noted: about 15 purposefully buried carinated Lapita pots have been found to date in pits throughout the archipelago, but not a single flat bottom dish 3. Dentate stamped decora- tion might have been only one of different "meanings" encapsulated in the decorated Lapita pots. 3. This remark highlights the point made earlier in the paper about the abandonment, east of western Fiji, of the deco- rated flat-bottom dishes. A shift in "symbols" may again be the main reason. Conclusion The more archaeologists get into the details of the Lapita Cultural Complex, the more the picture that emerges is one of complexity. Starting with the first general regional scheme proposed by Green in 1979, it seems to me that subsequent studies have been able to reject the extreme view of Lapita being "only pots" in Melanesia (Terrell 1989). At the same time, these studies have shown the divergent cultural paths followed by the founding (probably rather homogeneous) Austronesian societies of Near and Remote Oceania once they had progressively settled the different geographic regions of the south-west Pacific, each with its own environmental characteristics. The step-by-step chronology of Lapita spread built up during the last decade explains satisfac- torily, in my view, the differences that we can today identify in the different Provinces. Taking into account local evolutions and changes within the Melanesian chain between 1200 and 1000 BC is, I believe, the best way to properly understand the characteristics of the founding culture that colonized the Eastern Province (Fiji and West Polynesia) at the beginning of the first millenium BC. These characteristics will not be found in southern Melanesia, and probably not in northern Melanesia either, but in between - in the area where no-one is doing work at the moment. Although I am still not convinced that we have got the correct date for first settlement in Western Fiji, the proposed analysis from a Southern Lapita view is that the 8 to 10 generations which first settled the central Melanesian chain, devel- oped internal changes over this rather long time span that led to cultural characteristics ancestral to Eastern Lapita. Rapid changes in Western Fiji after first colo- nization and before the spread farther east must also be considered, but I am still convinced that the roots of the characteristic simple Eastern Lapita baggage are some- where in central Melanesia. One of the most interesting topics to be developed in this core area in the future will certainly be to identify archaeologically the local evolution of the Lapita Cultural Complex, especially in the critical period between 1200 and 900 BC. Similar attempts have suc- ceeded in northern Melanesia and in New Caledonia for some Lapita sites, as well as in central Vanuatu for con- temporaneous and later contexts. To test the proposed hypothesis, archaeologists have to locate the proper type of site allowing for a good chronological control. The Fijian examples remind us that it is not always easy task (Anderson and Clark 1999), but the Manganasi re-exca- vations (Bedford 2000; Spriggs and Bedford 2000) sug- gest that such a site is waiting somewhere in central Melanesia. The whole picture of the Lapita expansion and the understanding of its regional differences would be profoundly enlightened by a clearer understanding of what happened in the 'center'. Future studies might show the need to create a final region there (see Kirch (1997:72) for the first input), as a simple look at a map (Fig 3) suggests the "Central Lapita Province". 73</page><page sequence="10">Acknowledgments This work is part of the ongoing Lapita program of the Department of Archaeology of New Caledonia for the Northern, Southern and Loyalty Islands Provinces.
