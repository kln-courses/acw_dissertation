<plain_text><page sequence="1">Stories to Remember Narrative and the Time of Memory Jens Brockmeier It has often been noted that the vividness and imme diacy with which we remember certain events is in dependent of their remoteness in time. Days or years are no valid currency in the realm of remembrance. Our psychological life, as Freud stated, is timeless. Why does the unremarkable furniture of the kitchen in which my family ate dinner when I was a child still stay with me? What's so special about my old child's chair, which became increasingly rickety over the years due to my constant teetering? We all live in the midst of memories of rickety chairs, first kisses, and painful separations, irrespective of their age and ours and of whether we want to or not. For some, invol untary memories are a precious gift, as we know per haps most famously from Marcel Proust, who seemed to have dedicated most of his life to the psychological and narrative experience of such memoirs involontaire.</page><page sequence="2">Proust was well aware that our mnemonic life ignores the rules of com mon time and that memory has its own time. For a human being, he wrote, "is that ageless creature who has the faculty of becoming many years younger in a few seconds, and who, surrounded by the walls of the time through which he has lived, floats within them as in a pool the surface-level of which is constantly changing so as to bring him within range now of one epoch, now of another" (1983:3:627). Understandably, faced with this Proustian scenario of simultaneity, experimental psychologists have sensed fundamental problems with the traditional notion of memory. And they are not alone. Landy (2004) wonders whether Prousts involuntary memories are proper memories at all; for "when?according to Proust?an odor, texture or sound re turns us to a former state, we are not dragging into the light a set of impressions that have long since departed but, instead, summoning up a part of us that is still very much present within our mind" (110). Prousts pool of time as an allegory of our simultaneous existence in different temporalities, with remembering as the central mode of creat ing and mediating this simultaneity, may have been an original trope? as certainly was much of the narrative repertoire he employed to ar ticulate the sudden time shifts between different pasts and presents. But the phenomenon he aimed to capture was anything but new, as was the awareness of it. Other writers, philosophers, and scientists had already described the simultaneity of multiple temporalities in which human beings live, and probably everyone had (and has) experienced it in one way or another, even if this experience was not necessarily conscious ly searched for and reflected upon. Here, however, we find one of the reasons why Proust's meandering explorations of the weave of memory and time in his Recherche were so spectacular?namely, that its narra tor intentionally seeks the experience of involuntary remembering, an experience that allows him to float in the pool of time by being simul taneously in touch with different epochs of his life, epochs that by com mon standards may be separated from each other by years and decades. For the French writer the multiple temporality of memories, in all their nonlinear and achronological randomness, represents most authenti cally the time of human memory, in fact, of our life. As a consequence, both the narrator and the author of the Recherche have come to live 116 STORYWORLDS VOLUME 1 2009</page><page sequence="3">their lives with almost complete disregard for what they perceive as the external, mechanical and mindless, time of clocks and calendars. There is a second aspect of Proust's investigation of memory and time that is, I think, similarly important if one wants to examine their interwovenness: both appear as narrative phenomena. And they are not just narrative in the sense one would expect in the work of a narrative artist, but in a strong philosophical and psychological sense, because they only take on a gestalt in narrative form. Differently put, both mem ory and time, as well as their fusion, only become intelligible in as far as they exist in linguistic form; they are only thinkable and imaginable as autobiographical discourse and narrative time. In this essay I want to take a closer look at this narrative weave of memory and time, a weave I have elsewhere tried to describe under the concept of "autobiographical time" (Brockmeier 2000). In particular, I am interested in the following question: what is it that ties the time of memory?of autobiographical memory, to be more precise?so inex tricably to its narrative form? Subsequently, having drawn on Proust in the first part to explore this question and its implications for our un derstanding of time and memory, I compare in the concluding part its Proustian articulation with that of another autobiographical writer, Walter Benjamin. The Weave of Time and Mind: The Newtonian and the Narrative View Time and memory are essential dimensions of human existence and, not surprisingly, highly contested areas of investigation und contempla tion; they are the subjects of many opposing views. I want to discuss two of them. For brevity's sake, I call one the Newtonian view, the other the narrative view. The ontological assumption underlying the Newtonian view, which can safely be called the standard view, claims that time is an objective and absolute system, a fixed background against which all events in the universe are spatiotemporally localized or, at least in prin ciple, can be identified. Since all knowledge is perspectival, this view does not preclude that time appears in different and changing subjec tive versions?in human experience, memory, and narrative. Nor does it Brockmeier: Stories to Remember 117</page><page sequence="4">rule out that time is perceived and reflected upon in phenomenological, cultural, and historical terms. But whatever the specific interrelation ship between mind and time, the basic supposition is that ultimately it can be represented in terms of an underlying Newtonian trajectory?in the same fashion as, in classical narratology, the "discourse time" of all narrated and narratable events and experience can be mapped along the linear and homogenous trajectory of "story time." The narrative view assumes that our concepts of time are neither uni versally given entities nor epistemological preconditions of experience but outcomes of symbolic constructions, constructions that are by their very nature cultural and historical. The more complex these construc tions become?for example, when they go beyond basic representations of duration, chronology, speed, and frequency and comprise simultane ous combinations of different times and time orders, including times of possible, "subjunctive" worlds, as typically is the case in autobiographi cal narratives and other life stories?the more they create scenarios like those with which Marcel Proust is concerned. In other words, the more we deal with human temporalities (and these are the subject of Proust's contemplations), the more the construction site is language, and in par ticular the language of narrative.1 Narrative discourse is our most advanced way to shape complex temporal experiences, including remembering. All natural languages provide a broad spectrum of grammatical and semantic resources and, on an overarching and integrative level, narrative forms and models by which humans temporalize themselves, that is, by which they localize themselves in a self-woven symbolic fabric of temporality. In telling sto ries about ourselves?and this is the type of discourse in which I am first of all interested?we not only give meanings to experiences pres ent and past, as well as question given meanings and reflect about pos sible new and future meanings, but also unfold, explicitly or implicitly, temporal scenarios. These scenarios not only align events and experi ences in time, but they also define and evoke "time" and its meaning in the first place?for example, by configuring an experience as past or present, or as a mix of both, or as simultaneous with another ex perience.2 In this way we are marking the surface level in Proust's pool in which we "float" up or down, "in a few seconds," to other epochs of 118 STORYWORLDS VOLUME 1 2009</page><page sequence="5">time. Temporal structures, in this view, appear not as a condition for narrative (nor as a condition of the possibility for narrative experience, as the Kantian might put it), but as a consequence of narrative acts of meaning, to adopt a term by Jerome Bruner (1990). In this sense an im portant portion of our time constructions can be understood as a re sult or effect, indeed, as the side effect of meaning constructions, with narrative as our most powerful "anthropomorphic operator of time" (Brockmeier 1996). All theories, in the strong sense of the word, try to recast different and opposing theories in their own terms. While the Newtonian view incorporates the narrative view as a subjective or phenomenological version of a universalist given, the narrative view frames the Newtonian view as a particular cultural-historical conception that emerged in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and was itself replaced at the be ginning of the twentieth century. Bender and Wellbery (1991) have ar gued that it is particularly apt to characterize the difference between the Newtonian and the post-Newtonian modern and modernist concep tion of time as that of two distinct "chronotypes." Chronotype is a varia tion on the term chronotope that was introduced into narrative theory by Michael Bakhtin (1981). Bakhtin borrowed the term from Einstein's physics to portray the fusion of temporal and spatial structures that characterizes space-time formations in specific narrative genres, such as the romance, the folktale, and the picaresque novel. "Bakhtin's term," Bender and Wellbery state, "is suggestive because it points to the diver sity of prototypical cultural forms within which time assumes signifi cance" (1991: 3). Yet even if we agree with Bender and Wellbery's argument that the post-Newtonian chronotype tends toward a more constructionist, prag matist, and contingent point of view?an argument elaborated in detail by Richard Rorty (1989)?and that the new chronotype thus encom passes "the drive to comprehend temporal construction as a function of narrative formation" (Bender and Wellbery 1991: 3) this still does not answer our question regarding the narrative fabric of the time of mem ory. Why should we accept the claim that narrative plays a pivotal role for our understanding of the temporal dynamic of remembering and forgetting? Brockmeier: Stories to Remember 119</page><page sequence="6">Temporal Self-Localization Let me offer two reasons. The first emerged with the historical devel opment, beginning in the eighteenth century and culminating with modernism, in which narrative evolved as the royal road to the repre sentation and study of autobiographical memory. Countless autobio graphical authors?writing for literary and personal motives, published and unpublished, famous and unknown?have dedicated themselves to examining their own practices of remembering and forgetting; and among these practices, again, narrative has proved to be essential. For many, this dedication has even turned into an obsession, an all-con suming way of life. Autobiographers, as the anthropologist would say, tend to live permanently in the field, blurring the limits between object and subject of observation, third- and first-person perspective, teller and told, the fictive and the factual. Their field notes and research re ports have yielded numerous thick descriptions: undercover investiga tions that often have extended over years and decades, and sometimes over entire lives. Once more, Marcel Proust is an exemplary figure. Between 1909 and the time of his death in 1922 he continuously worked on In Search of Lost Time, of which a 3,200-page version was published in seven vol umes. Although not strictly autobiographical in terms of genre and plot, this unparalleled endeavor of self-examination attributes to its protag onist personal experiences, concerns, and micropsychological observa tions that undoubtedly originated in the life of its author?even if the relationship between narrative and life, as has often been emphasized, is anything but direct, linear, and mimetic, and this is all the more true with Proust. Much of his life, as Tadie (2000) describes it, happened analogously to his work: as something that only gradually took shape and brought out its themes, motifs, and structures of intentionality. Most of these themes and structures never found any definitive closure. A case in point is Prousts fascination with the multiple times of memory and the remembering self. In Prousts narrative universe, these events are pivotal to the entire process of narrative identity construc tion; they are a vital concern of the novels protagonist, the younger Marcel, and its narrator, Marcel at the time of the story's telling, for the 120 STORYWORLDS VOLUME 1 2009</page><page sequence="7">continuous oscillations in the pool of time are closely related to the dy namic of the "innumerable 'selves' that compose our personality" (1981: 3:437). Thus it makes no difference whether one self becomes another self after a lapse of years and in the putatively natural sequence of time, or whether one self changes at any given moment into another, expos ing in this way "the incompatible persons, malicious, sensitive, refined, caddish, disinterested, ambitious which one can be, in turn, every day of one's life" (657). On a narrative level, this becomes manifest by Proust's permanent use of anachronisms that suggest, as Jauss (1986: 139) ob served, that the narrator continuously turns the hand of his clock back and forth, so that his protagonist simultaneously dines with his lover and plays ball with his nanny. Hence the concept of a natural flow of time reveals little about the shifting simultaneity of different experienc es, temporal states, and, in fact, different "selves" of the experiencing or reminiscing narrator. Eventually the assumption of a given "time" with in which we are to localize ourselves appears itself to be an effect of our fundamentally unstable identity and our narrative strategies to make sense of such fluid existence. In terms of autobiographical memory, Proust arguably brought to its fullest expression an age-old idea: namely, that the remembered self is unavoidably intermingled with the remembering self (Bruner 1994; Olney 1998). Since the Recherche, the nexus of autobiographical remem bering, time, and narrative has become an almost natural concern at the heart of innumerable writers and generally accepted in the world of let ters; which is not to say that all shared Proust's version of this nexus. Proust has predisposed us to interpret much of twentieth-century liter ature as autobiographical in one way or another. It either explicitly deals with the lives and minds of the writers themselves, with their selves in time?in remembered (autobiographical and historical) time?or it in directly draws on and exploits the dramas of their lives. And what is more, the texts in question are about the project of self-understanding and the activity of self-examination itself. Put bluntly, if we want to know what it means to look at one's own existence and the existence of others from a first-person point of view, clearly literary narratives are a privileged site for investigations of this sort. Autobiographical writers, as Ender (2005) remarks, are "exemplary Brockmeier: Stories to Remember 121</page><page sequence="8">architects of mnemonic scenes"; through their detailed descriptions of processes of remembering they reveal "the artifices of imagination and rhetoric that bring the past to life" (5). Enders goes on to say that writers who have "a vocation for remembrance have long known about its subtle complexities"; especially, "they have learnt that memories are constructions, that they are dependent on mood and context, and above all that there is no ready-made template to be found somewhere in the brain that reproduces an initial impress or trace" (5). Many autobio graphical writers have especially emphasized what seems to be true for all autobiographical remembrance: that it is a process of meaning con struction that includes the simultaneous configuration of scenarios in very different times, times that are inextricably tied to their narrative reality. My point is that this multifarious autobiographical discourse, as it unfolds in many works of self-writing, allows for insights that no cog nitive and neuroscientific memory research can provide. It opens a window on the workings of the autobiographical process that are not reduced to cognitive (or neural) operations of encapsulated memory systems but, rather, are revealed as a form of life fundamental to human existence. This leads to the second reason why I think narrative is crucial for our understanding of the temporal dynamic of remembering and for getting: because this dynamic is itself fused with that of the narrative process. We are not only talking about narrative representation (or re flection) of a prior entity "memory" or distinct cognitive memory sys tems responsible for "mental time travels"; rather, the focus is on narra tive as carrying out the autobiographical process?which implies that there is no autobiographical process "in itself," independent of narra tive.3 This is especially manifest in the intricate scenarios of temporal self-localization unfolding in the autobiographical process. I suspect that what Bruner (1993) pointed out about human life in general also holds true for this dynamic, namely, that to look at it "as if it were in dependent of the autobiographical text that constructs it is as futile a quest for reality as the physicists search for a Nature that is indepen dent of the theories that lead him to measure one rather than another phenomenon" (55). 122 STORYWORLDS VOLUME 1 2009</page><page sequence="9">The many narrative experiments that we can observe in the autobio graphical process invite us to study how modern individuals try to lo calize themselves in a world that does not provide any existential stabil ity; how they are engaged in the special human activity of interpreting and making sense of themselves in continuously changing time frames; and how they employ, in the process, the narrative models, genres, and strategies offered to them by the cultural world in which they live. In this view the human condition appears to be tantamount to an ever changing construction site for meaning. Exploring, in this light, mod ernist attempts at autobiographical self-construction reveals how such practices of self-writing exemplify what Foucault (1984) called le sou ci de soiy the care of the self. Foucault saw this kind of self-care deeply rooted in the Western tradition, where it seems to have become, over the last two centuries, more of an obsession than a care. This obsession, in turn, may reflect what sociologist Zygmunt Bauman (2000) has de scribed as the increasingly "liquid nature" of modernity, its dissolution of earlier certainties and foregrounding of the precariousness of hu mans' existential situation. With this in mind, the approach to the narrative linkage between time and memory that I propose can be formulated this way: The auto biographical process offers a most appropriate venue for the study of the temporal structures of our attempts to make sense of our experiences? all the more as these experiences are part and parcel of our modern and postmodern reality. In opening a unique window on how we come to terms with the diachronic dimension of our being in the world, we wit ness how we try to endow the Heraclitian fleetingness of our existence with meaning. In fact, we observe how the structures of such meaning change as our experiences and their affective make-up change. It would therefore be misleading to imagine the autobiographical process as a closed system, akin to the traditional idea of memory as a unitary faculty (or system) of the individual mind or brain. The au tobiographical process does not lead to or depart from an archive of the past. Nor can it be categorized in terms of cognitive constructs such as "semantic memory" and "episodic memory"?distinctions that have been criticized for their artificial status that makes them fail each time we leave the memory laboratory and are confronted with the narrative Brockmeier: Stories to Remember 123</page><page sequence="10">complexities of real autobiographical processes. Rather, it is through a multitude of autobiographical forms and practices, intermingled with all kinds of material and social forms of life (including language), that we localize ourselves, our experiences, thoughts, and feelings within a temporal horizon (Brockmeier 2002). The study of the narrative dy namic of this process reveals that this temporal horizon reaches much farther than the economies of clock and calendar time could possibly capture. Memory, Time, and Intentionality Let me return to the multiple temporality of memory. The argument that I have presented in tandem with the narrative view is that our ideas of time are side effects of our meaning constructions, rather than their (ontological, epistemological, or narrative) preconditions. How and whether we qualify, in the autobiographical process, experiences, emo tions, hopes, fears, and fantasies in terms of the Newtonian trajectory of past, present, and future (or as combinations of them), depends on the specifics of the meaning-making process in which they play a role. Clocks, calendars, and other forms of societal time regulation are ex tremely useful in our everyday life; yet as soon as it comes to the auto biographical process such devices, as sophisticated as they may be, are of no great help. Reading them has to be replaced with the effort to un derstand the meanings of narrative time scenarios; and these meanings relate to the time of clocks like the meanings of our lives relate to the chronologies listed in a CV. To take a closer look at such meaning-based temporalization, I want to distinguish two sides of this, to be sure, very dialectical process. On the one hand there is, as already mentioned, the cultural and historical world with its specific semantic and grammatical resources, its discur sive orders, concepts, and narrative models of time and memory. On the other hand there is the individual as a subject of intentionality, a person with a social life, emotions, motives, and desires that, embedded in this social life, drive and orient his or her meaning constructions, in cluding their temporalization. Without recognizing the subjects inten tional attitude toward temporality and the personal significance of re 124 STORYWORLDS VOLUME 1 2009</page><page sequence="11">membrance as well as of specific memories we cannot comprehend the concrete temporal scenarios that emerge in his or her autobiographical discourse. This view resonates with a renewed focus in narrative theory on the role of intentionality in discourse and narrative understanding, an interest inspired by research in several areas about humans' tendency "to read for intention" (Herman 2008) or, differently put, to reach for meaning (Brockmeier 2009). For Herman (240-41), storytelling, stories, and storyworlds are "irreducibly grounded in intentional systems," while "intentional systems are grounded in storytelling practices." Drawing on this hermeneutic rationale, we can view autobiographical narrative as, to use Herman s terms, a "primary resource" for (re)constructing psy chological states and, more generally, states of consciousness, "thanks to which circumstances, participants, actions, and intentional states of various kinds can be connected together into (more or less) coherent representations of social scenarios" (241). Now, within the Proustian universe of discourse, I want to highlight one element of such a sce nario: the narrator's (and, in this respect, also the author's) intentional stance toward time and memory. Consider, once more, Proust's picture of the pool of time and his idea of human life as encompassing at any given moment a multitude of different epochs. We understood this as essentially suggesting the si multaneity of experiential states and temporalities that, in traditional terms, would be conceived of as situated at distinct past and present moments in chronological time (with the moments in the past simply called "memories"). Can we discern a profile of intentionality behind this vision of time and memory? Let me make this picture the starting point in attempting to indicate an answer. Of course, this can only be a short hint, for the entire Recherche is nothing else but an extended proj ect of temporalization. Time?as discussed by philosophers like Ricoeur (1985), critics like Jauss (1986), narratologists like Genette (1980), and writers like Beckett (1957)?is the great theme of Proust's work (Marcel's entire existence is a search for lost time); it also is the domain of origin of art ("time regained" is the very material of artistic beauty) and its foremost subject of reflection; it furthermore is supposed to define the form of the work as well as its overall composition (at the end of his Brockmeier: Stories to Remember 125</page><page sequence="12">search, after Marcel has undergone a series of experiences in the resusci tation of time lost, he resolves to write a book that will have "the shape of time," the book the reader just finished). A concern with time even insinuates itself into Proust's style?think of Proust s notorious syntax as a form of reminiscing that assumes a timeless or even multitempo ral universe of discourse, with meandering sentences whose epic depen dent clauses are like mnemonic search movements, determined at the onset but then all of a sudden hesitating, moving back and forth, to the side and ahead and returning again, as if they had forgotten something and came back for it. What I am most interested in, however, lies on a more elemental psy chological or, perhaps, more existential plane. Is there a distinctive qual ity of Prousts overall attitude to time and memory, an intentional stance that shapes not only the stories he wants to remember but also his tem poralization of certain events as memories and of others as immediate experiences in the here and now? With this question in mind, compare Proust's writing with that of another autobiographical writer, Walter Benjamin. This comparison is far from random. Benjamin was an early admirer of Proust; he was not only an addictive reader, as he called it, but also a translator, commentator, and sympathetic philosophical crit ic of Proust's work. Benjamin's own autobiographical prose, first of all the collection of short pieces of his Berlin Childhood around 1900, re veals many features reminiscent of Proust?the bittersweet memories of the beloved mother, the noises from the courtyard and thus from a foreign world, and the places whose magic caught the boy and never left him. Not least, there is what Peter Szondi (2006:10) describes as the key insight of Proust's work: "that almost everything childhood was can be withheld from a person for years, suddenly to be offered him anew as if by chance." Further, at the level of theoretical reflection, Benjamin comes close to Proust's vision of the simultaneity of multiple times in the autobiographical process, for example, when he ventures the idea that a remembered event is infinite, because as a memory it is a key to everything that happened before and after it (Benjamin 1968). Nevertheless, Szondi (2006) suggests in his analysis of the relationship between Proust's and Benjamin's work that ultimately little is gained by such comparisons; it would be difficult to refute the objection that such 126 STORYWORLDS VOLUME 1 2009</page><page sequence="13">similarities reflect only that both writers tackle typical autobiographical raw material situated in the same fin-de-siecle epoch?material whose presence in their lives they attempt to trace in many-layered scenarios of time and memory. Can we even be sure, Szondi asks, that "Proust and Benjamin really share the same theme? Does their search for 'lost time' arise from the same motive? Or is the common element merely an appearance that should be pointed out because it could obscure the fact that the intentions of the two works are not only not related but are in fact totally opposed" (n). To understand Szondi's suspicion, we first have to follow his reading of Prousts work. It tracks the meaning of Prousts search for time past as evolving out of two main emotions, a painful one and a happy one. Both run through the entire Recherche. The inexplicable feeling of happiness seizes the hero first when, with the madeleine dunked in tea, the whole world of his childhood reappears; whereas the other feeling, that of consternation, takes hold with the rec ognition that there is one, existentially threatening dimension where he does not stand outside of linear and chronological time, but is subject to its law. The high point of Marcels autobiographical endeavor is at the end of the book when he recognizes that these two feelings of happiness and terror are intrinsically connected. "That," writes Szondi, "which un derlies the feeling of happiness in the one case liberates him from the terror of the other" (12). It is interesting to see that this point is illustrated by a passage from the Recherche in which Marcel, in describing his feelings of happiness and his memories of them, also reflects on their temporal status. The experience of the simultaneity of different times coincides with the lib erating emotional experience of breaking free from the sway of tempo rality itself. I caught an inkling of this [...] when I compared these various happy impressions with one another and found that they had this in common?namely, that I experienced them simultaneously in the present moment and in some distant past, which the sound of the spoon against the plate [...] , or the peculiar savor of the madeleine even went so far as to make coincide with the present, leaving me uncertain in which period I was. (Proust 1983: 2:995) Brockmeier: Stories to Remember 127</page><page sequence="14">For Proust, this sense of "identities between the present and the past" that accompanies his search for time lost allows him to escape from the threat that the idea of the irreversible flow of time exerts on him and, instead, to "live and enjoy the essence of things [...] entirely outside of time" (995). For Benjamin, both time and memory have a different meaning. The intentional stance behind the evocation of his autobiographical Berlin Childhood can be readily perceived?and again I follow Szondi?from scenes that present moments of departure, emerging, and first times. Consider the moment when Benjamin (2006) recalls the walks of the boy to the Tiergarten, to the "the strangest part of the park," where he feels drawn not to the statues of the royals but to their pedestals, the place of a first time sensation: "Here, in fact, or not far away, must have lain the couch of that Ariadne in whose proximity I first experienced what only later I had a word for: love" (54). Like the Tiergarten memory, there are many experiences in which Benjamin detects signs of his later life, early traces of things to come that are irrevocably gone once those things have come: "I can dream of the way I once learned to walk. But that doesn't help. I now know how to walk; there is no more learning to walk" (142). Such observations and memories?which do not limit themselves to personal concerns but in clude historical and social matters?are not so much about the past as about a perspective in which present and future are brought together, where the premonition of the child and the knowledge of the adult are merged. What Benjamin is interested in, as Szondi concludes, is not the past in itself but the invocation of those aspects of his childhood "in which a token (Vorklang) of the future lies hidden" (21). Proust's search for time lost is driven by his desire to defend himself from the idea of chronological temporality. The real goal of his absorp tion of all times past and present in the simultaneity of the autobio graphical process is to escape from the present and, perhaps even more, from the future, with all its uncertainties and threats, of which the ulti mate one is death. In contrast, the future is precisely what Benjamin seeks in the past. Almost every place that his memory wishes to rediscover bears "traces of what was to come," as he puts it at one point in Berlin Childhood. 128 STORYWORLDS VOLUME 1 2009</page><page sequence="15">And it is no accident that his memory encounters a personage from his childhood "in his capacity as a seer prophesying the future." Proust listens attentively for the echo of the past; Benjamin listens for the first notes of a future which has meanwhile become the past. Unlike Proust, Benjamin does not want to free himself from temporality; he does not wish to see things in their ahistorical essence. He strives instead for historical experience and knowledge. Nevertheless, he is sent back into the past, a past however, which is open, not completed, and which promises the future. Benjamin's tense is not the perfect, but the future perfect in the fullness of its paradox: being future and past at the same time. (Szondi 2006:19) Benjamins autobiographical quest for time gone by, for lost time, is, in sum, a quest for the lost future. This future never became real; it only emerged briefly in moments of promise and Vorklang in the past?and we have to keep in mind that even this past only emerges in hindsight, in the act of remembrance that takes place in the here and now as the invocation of a Utopia that never came true. The here and now consists of Benjamin writing his memories in the 1930s, trying to escape from fascism?a man haunted and hounded without any hope either for his own future as a writer and philosopher or for the future of humanity. Without being aware of this cultural constellation of "intentionality" (of which the individual intentional stance of the author is only one el ement), the temporalization of Benjamins autobiographical scenarios remains unintelligible?as it does for Proust's elegiac visions of a past that he tries to evoke as a timeless present. This difference between their ideas of time and memory is also re sponsible for what Szondi calls the formal difference of Proust's and Benjamin's narrative works, "that gulf which separates the three-thou sand-page novel from the collection of brief prose pieces" (21). But de spite their differences, both texts resonate with the chief claim made in this essay: namely, that the emerging scenarios of autobiographical time are more adequately understood as results and side effects of nar rative worldmaking than as mnemonic representations of "the" past in "the" present. Autobiographical scenarios do not unfold "in time," along a Newtonian trajectory; nor can they be reduced to or projected onto such an ontological model of time. Rather, if we closely investigate such Brockmeier: Stories to Remember 129</page><page sequence="16">scenarios of memory and time they prove to be inextricably intertwined with their very narrative construction?a construction whose under standing, as both Proust and Benjamin suggest, necessarily reaches be yond mere narrative analysis. Notes 1. By human temporality I mean a temporality that is specific to and fundamental for the human being in the world. On a more general plane, this human-specif ic dimension of time (which includes phenomena discussed as social, cultural, historical, phenomenological, and noetic times) is to be distinguished from concepts of time that refer to biological and physical temporalities (see Fraser 1992; 1987, ch. 3). 2. Drawing on the ideas of Ricoeur and Wittgenstein, I have discussed this argu ment in greater detail elsewhere (Brockmeier (1995/2001,1996,2008). 3. This claim does not exclude, on a psychological and philosophical plane, the possibility that one can have a sense of self and identity despite the absence of narrative?or even the absence of language and memory (Eakin 1999; Freeman 2008; Medved and Brockmeier 2008).
