ALAIN THOTE Chinese art of the Bronze Age (circa 1500-221 b.c.e.),1 at least as it is known through the innumerable vestiges excavated by archaeologists, offers a striking contrast with Western art of the same period: until the sixth century b.c.e., representations of the human figure are very rare. Certain single-figure depictions exist as exceptions to the rule, but there is a complete absence of representations of human figures or anthropomorphic deities engaged in activities within a natural or architectural setting.2 The reasons for this are difficult to gauge with any certainty. A first hypothesis that could be advanced is that the examples of ancient Chinese art come for the most part from tombs, and that the human image did not necessarily have a place in a funerary or ritual context. But this explanation is in itself insufficient. After all, to the extent allowed by chance discoveries, such objects as weapons or sumptuary items, which were employed by aristocrats in their daily life or to enhance their prestige and augment their power, could conceivably have revealed a different iconography, one closer to human society and not solely indebted to the animal world (real and imaginary). Yet this has not happened. In a civilization as important and rich as the Chinese, this very unusual situation never ceases to astonish. In ancient Greece, Egypt, and I would like to thank Jonathan Hay for his attentive and faithful translation of my text, as well as for his stimulating remarks. My thanks go at the same time to the anonymous reviewer who kindly shared a number of suggestions with me. It goes without saying that any errors of interpretation that may appear here are my responsibility alone. 1. In China bronze was of such importance during the centuries preceding the foundation of the empire that it seems appropriate to consider the Bronze Age as having lasted until 221 b.c.e., whereas in western Asia the Iron Age had already begun by the end of the second millennium. Iron came into use in western China toward the eighth century b.c.e., but its development did not truly take off until the fourth, or more certainly the third, century. 2. Counterbalancing this reluctance to depict human beings in the diversity of their activities is the presence of cast intaglio inscriptions on a certain number of bronzes from around the eleventh century b.c.e. These very schematic graphic combinations of signs are thought to represent the insignia of aristocratic clans or families. In them can often be seen human figures, who may brandish halberds with banners attached, and are sometimes associated with animals. But these signs were not made to be seen, since they are situated on the interior surface of the vessels and are very small in scale. The contrast to the vessel decoration of solely zoomorphic inspiration is striking. Mesopotamia, by contrast, figurai representations abound, illustrating the world of legend no less fully than human society.3 From the Chinese Bronze Age until the sixth century b.c.e., there is a cruel lack of iconographie data that would permit a precise idea of costume, hairstyles, temple architecture, or domestic architecture. In fact, archaeologists have found only a few representations of the human figure, most of which are highly stylized. In the current state of scholarly knowledge, therefore, the pictorial vessels on which the human figure constitutes the main decorative element have no prototype. They make their appearance suddenly, at a date that has not yet been determined with any great accuracy, but can be estimated to be about 500 b.c.e. They also are innovative in another important way, by not only taking human beings as their principal subject matter, but also showing them engaged in all sorts of activities?hunting and warfare, for example?sometimes within a specific environment. This latter innovation is all the more curious given that these figurai representations appear on bronze vessels, traditionally considered to be ritual objects. Previously on such vessels, only real or imaginary animals had been depicted, either independently or, from the eighth century b.c.e. onward, interlaced. They had always been depicted without any natural setting, without reference even to an environment, and with a certain degree of idealization. On the large pictorial vases, the scenes are depicted in horizontal registers around the full circumference of the vessel (figs. 2-3). It is thus necessary to turn the vessel in order to see the image in its entirety. (On this point, archaeologists' drawings such as figure 3 are misleading, since they give the impression of an image that can be entirely grasped by the eye). But the fact that each register includes several distinguishable scenes in turn suggests several possible ways of reading the ?mages: either (1) the juxtaposed scenes depict separate subjects, or (2) several consecutive scenes from one event were brought together within a single 3. On this, see the joint publication of the Institut d'Arch?ologie et d'Histoire Ancienne (Lausanne) and the Centre de Recherches Compar?es sur les Soci?t?s Anciennes (Paris), La cit? des images, Religion et soci?t? en Gr?ce antique (Paris: Fernand Nathan, 1984).</page><page sequence="3">12 RES 35 SPRING 1999 *%v &lt;HU.U.&lt;&gt; B,i^b..[2, Beijjng ?^ ?

If different modes of reading are possible, it appears that this form of decoration was directly inspired by a kind of pictorial art of which all traces have been lost. It was, in fact, executed using two quite distinct techniques: either inlay, in the bronze, of a kind of pigmented paste, or the use of a needle to incise the surface of the vessel. The images produced are therefore probably a rather schematic transposition of paintings executed during the same period, no doubt in larger formats and on a different media from bronze?wood or lacquer, for instance, or possibly silk.4 Because this transposition probably entailed a diminution of scale, it led to the suppression of details judged superfluous or difficult to reproduce clearly. The depictions on the pictorial bronzes show little detail. They present us with figures 4. See Charles D. Weber, Chinese Pictorial Bronze Vessels of the Late Chou Period (Ascona: Artibus Asiae, 1968) (reprinted from Artibus Asiae 28, nos. 2-4 [1966]; 29, nos. 2-3 [1967]; 30, no. 1 [1968]). The earliest known examples on silk are, after all, no more than one or two centuries later in date.</page><page sequence="4">Thote: Intercultural relations as seen from Chinese pictorial bronzes 1 3 Figure 3.

What mattered for the artisans and their patrons was to visualize, even summarily, gestures and places and not recognizable individuals.5 And in this respect these vessels conform closely to some sort of canon. One often finds the same scenes: scenes depicting musicians, ceremonies, a hunt with figures riding in chariots, an archery tournament, and so on. These images contain all sorts of information about aristocratic life around the fifth century b.c.e.; it is quite clear that the activities of the dominant social classes are shown.6 The pictorial bronzes have been the subject of numerous studies, both in China and the West as well as in Japan, in which several different approaches can be identified.7 Generally, there has often been a desire to see in the pictorial decoration images of Zhou dynasty China, and these images have been thought all the more important given that they could not be seen anywhere else and were (and are) the oldest such images known. Thanks to them, it was finally possible to have depictions of a world forever lost. The various studies largely follow two tendencies. Certain scholars concentrate on the styles, the origins, and the geographical distribution of the vessels and on the documentary data on aristocratic society in ancient China that can be extracted from the images. Others have privileged the interpretation of the different scenes in the light of ancient texts.8 The general use of these two approaches, which do not preclude each other, has had an important consequence. Implicitly, it has been thought that the depicted reality ought to be the same on all the pictorial bronzes, and that their images referred to ancient China taken as a whole, with discrepancies or nuances seen in each case being attributed to different artisans or workshops. Charles Weber, who was one of the rare scholars to have posed the question of the geographical origins of the different bronzes and who advanced a number of astute hypotheses, did not really have at his disposal the means to elucidate the problem. At the time when he was working, a very large proportion of vessels?and this is still partly the case today?had no clear provenance. Consequently, it was difficult for him to localize the workshops. Moreover, even when one does know the provenance, this site is not necessarily located near the site of production. Finally, as we shall see, the sites where the vessels have been excavated are dispersed over a very large part of present-day Chinese territory, which complicates the identification of one or more regions of origin.9 I would like to demonstrate here that once the site or sites of production of these pictorial vessels are known, their decoration emerges as more varied than it was thought and that the observable differences among them are significant as expressions of cultural differences within what is, today, conventionally termed "China/' The most interesting option seems to be to view these scenes as more or less faithful reflections of the customs of the period and place where the images were conceived. This leads me, on the one hand, to analyze them from the inside, so to speak, by studying their internal coherence, and on the other, to confront their visual account of material culture with archaeological findings of the same cultural milieu. 5. As has been convincingly demonstrated by David Keightley, who contrasts Greek representations with their individualized figures depicting gods and heroes with Chinese representations of the same period with their stereotypical and anonymous figures. "Ancient Chinese Art: Contexts, Constraints, and Pleasures," Asian Art 3, no. 2 (Spring 1990):2-6. 6. For example, hunting or archery. It is known that hunting, in ancient China, represented a form of training for warfare. A similar argument can be made for archery. See H. G. Creel, The Birth of China: A Study in the Formative Period of Chinese Civilization (New York: F. Ungar Pub. Co., 1967), p. 321. 7. On these different approaches, see the synthesis given by Esther Jacobson in 'The Structure of Narrative in Early Chinese Pictorial Vessels," Representations 8 (Fall 1984):61-62. 8. Numerous authors have sought to identify these scenes by attempting to associate them with particular historical events and with certain activities specific to princes and high-ranking aristocrats. See, in particular, Du Heng, "Shilun Baihuatan qiancuo tuxiang tonghu," Wenwu, 1976, no. 3:47-51; Mary H. Fong, "The Origin of Chinese Pictorial Representation of the Human Figure," Artibus Asiae 49, nos. 1-2 (1989):5-38. In the author's opinion, the possibility of historical identifications can immediately be excluded. In fact, it would depend on three assumptions: that the artists wanted to depict historical events, that these events were described textually in the same period or later, and that these ancient texts have survived. This approach does not take into account the fact that out of the considerable number of ancient texts that were written, only a small body of historical texts and annals, and so on, have survived, on the basis of which the events depicted could be identified. 9. One recent study that combines different approaches, textual and cultural, is Li Xiating, "Guanyu tuxiangwen tongqi de jidian renshi," Wenwu jikan, 1992, no. 4:45-54.</page><page sequence="6">Thote: Intercultural relations as seen from Chinese pictorial bronzes 1 5 1. Vessels with incised decoration The vessels with incised decoration form a relatively homogeneous group, if only by virtue of the decorative technique, little used in ancient China.10 I have identified a total of about 40 vessels, complete and fragmentary, plus a cylindrical box and several round, pierced plaques whose function remains unknown (see table 1).11 The typology of the vessels is very limited, consisting essentially of yi, or "pourers" (18) and basins known to archaeologists under various names (fig. 4): '?'?an (6) when they are deep, and pan (12) and pen (1) when they are shallow. To these vessels can be added a container with a globular belly, termed a pou,u and fragments of vessels whose form cannot be identified. It immediately appears that the typology has a certain coherence, since the basins held water for ablutions, and the yi was used to pour the water into them. The designation of certain basins as jian, however, is problematic. The term pan is more appropriate, in the sense that it has traditionally been associated with pourers.13 Most likely, the total number of archaeologically excavated vessels with incised decoration is far higher than the number I have arrived at. The reason is that almost all the vessels were discovered in a bad state of preservation. The excavation reports sometimes note their existence without reproducing them, providing simply a summary description of the remaining decoration. The fragmentary character of the objects is due to the extreme thinness of the bodies, which in most cases are less than a millimeter thick; this differentiates them from most other ritual bronzes, which are thicker. Their technique of manufacture is indeed an unusual one. With just a few exceptions, they were not cast in molds but hammered by hand. Laboratory analyses have made possible the reconstruction of the manufacturing technique in some cases.14 The hammering of the metal sheet, which contained a high proportion of copper, was accompanied by reheatings. To avoid the metal becoming brittle and bring back its malleability, a mechanical cooling treatment and heating treatment were alternated. The objects studied by HeTangkun reveal the complexity of these operations, which ended with a polishing of the surface in order to give it brilliance.15 Only then came the work of incising, practiced with a very hard needle manipulated by hand. This produced a line that is apparently fluid, but under a magnifying glass can be seen, in fact, to be discontinuous (fig. 5).16The handles and animal masks that held the movable rings [pushou] for holding the vessel were attached to the walls of the vessel by riveting, a technique that seems to have been restricted to this type of vessel.17 These vessels have another particularity: almost without exception, the main decoration is found on the interior surface, and only very secondarily on the 10. This category corresponds to Charles Weber's group 4 (see note 4, pp. 271-302). Several updated surveys of the material have since been written in the light of new archaeological discoveries. See, in particular, Zhang Guangli, "Dong Zhou qingtong kewen," Kaogu yu wenwu, 1983, no. 1:83-88; Ye Xiaoyan, "Dong Zhou kewen tongqi," Kaogu, 1983, no. 2:158-164; Liu Jianguo, "Chunqiu kewen tongqi chulun," Dongnan wenhua, 1988, no. 5:83-90. 11. One can add to the pictorial bronzes a few minor objects with incised zoomorphic decoration, which attest to a parallel but marginal use of the same technique, for example, for spatulae {bi) (objects nos. 51-54 in table 1) and a pair of vessels (no. 50). Abridged bibliographic references accompany table 1. Fuller references are given below wherever necessary. 12. Klaus J. Brandt, "Ein kugeliger Bronzetopf mit graviertem Dekor," in Zur Kunstgeschichte Ostasiens, 50 Jahre Lehre und Forschung an der Universit?t K?ln (Cologne, 1977), pp. 67-77. 13. A deep basin identified as a ?'?an, containing an yi pourer, was found in a tomb at Huqiu, near Suzhou (Suzhou bowuguan kaoguzu, "Suzhou Huqiu Dong Zhou mu," Wenwu, 1981, no. 11:51-54, figs. 9-10, 13). A jian held the water necessary to cool down or warm up the beverage contained in a hu. 14. Six objects from a tomb at Huaiyin in Jiangsu have been analyzed. The study involved five vessels with incised decoration and one undecorated pourer of the same type as the vessels, that is, with extremely thin walls, between 0.5 and 0.9 mm thick. The surface of the vessels was covered with a very thin, protective coating, whose color was variously yellow ochre, dark yellow, green, or copperish yellow. See HeTangkun, "Kewen tongqi kexue fenxi," Kaogu, 1993, no. 5:465-468.

They were absorbed into the mass of molten bronze at the moment it was poured into the mold and in this way became one with the vessel wall. This technique, first elaborated under the Shang, was no doubt improved over time while retaining the same basic principle. See Robert W. Bagley, Shang Ritual Bronzes in the Arthur M.

The decoration of a pourer from Jinshengcun, nearTaiyuan (Shanxi), even if it has only survived in part, is quite characteristic. It is divided into three registers, marked off at the bottom by a series of inverted triangles. The upper register is decorated with a line of trees?in passing, one might note that the first artistic references to the world of plants appears on this type of vessel. The middle register, the most complex of the three, was probably originally composed of three scenes, of which only two survive: to the left, one sees a target mounted on two poles standing on the ground, flanked by two lines of trees. Further on, an archer lets fly, while another prepares his bow. Beneath the spout, and thus occupying a choice placement, is another scene centered on a table supporting two large jars in which ladles are standing. Above the table hangs a bow. On either side of the table, there arrive processions of figures holding either goblets (or drinking horns) or stem cups, the former for a liquid, the latter for items of food. It would thus appear that two successive episodes are depicted here: the archery contest, followed by festivities in honor of the victor(s). In the lower register, figures exchange cups, perhaps again in some relation to the archery contest of the middle register. In these 18. One exception is a pou mentioned earlier (note 12), because of its globular form. Moreover, among all the objects known to this author, it is one of only two that were cast rather than hammered. The other example is a zhou in the Shanghai Museum that similarly has part of its decoration incised on the exterior surface. See Ma Chengyuan, "Man tan Zhanguo qingtongqi shang de huaxiang," Wenwu, 1960, no. 10:26-30.

The target is placed opposite two large jars and the archers are placed on either side of the target, as if they were shooting from the two sides. On the first pourer, the presence of water is suggested by intertwined serpents placed at the bottom of the belly and by fish?silurids, perhaps?and wave motifs engraved on the spout. It seems likely that the aquatic theme would have had a direct relation to the function of all these vessels; but it may also be related to the arrangement of scenes around the circumference of the vessel?scenes that take place in a natural setting and perhaps in a marshy region well served for fish. The design reproduced in figure 4 now becomes clearer, although it is much more complex than the two previous examples.20 The two large jars are placed at the center of a large building, with a bow hanging to the right. Various figures occupy themselves around two tripods placed over fires, while a third arrives with fowl suspended from a long pole. A banquet is in preparation. The whole scene is in some sense framed by a schematically drawn wall, through which access is afforded (at far left on the drawing) by a gate. To the right of the building, occupying the whole of the second half of the wall of the vessel, are two juxtaposed scenes?an archery contest on the upper level, a 19.

Two other important themes were developed in the incised designs: hunting, summarily indicated on the basin from Sanji Gucheng (fig. 4), but fully developed on other vessels21 (fig. 8), and the description of a supernatural world inhabited by strange, hybrid beings, sometimes hidden or living in cave-mountains22 (fig. 9). One further notes the depiction of a scene of warfare23 (fig. 10). These various themes are not mutually incompatible, even in their most contrasting aspects. Thus on a pourer discovered in Houchuan Tomb no. 2144 at Shaanxian (Henan), two cave mountains are depicted facing the libation scene centered on two jars placed on a kind of trestle.24 Similarly, on the cylindrical box from Liulige, the supernatural world is only separated from the world of human beings by a sort of perimeter wall that we see in section (fig. 16).25 One has to bear in mind that all these scenes were incised on a very small scale, in general on the interior 21.

As a result, only one person at a time was in a position to contemplate them close-up, while turning the vessel in his hands. Under his eyes unrolled the miniaturized depiction of a world, allowing him to discover one after another its real and supernatural aspects. The vessel's function for its owner, therefore, was of a completely different order from that which one usually sees in ritual vessels, whose size, weight, and even decoration were intended to impress a large audience. Thus one is tempted to see these incised pictorial bronzes, light and easy to handle, whose function almost always seems to be connected to water, as objects that would have served other rituals than those dedicated to the ancestors, for example, rituals marking an important event in a person's life such as a marriage. Alternatively, they may have more simply been destined for domestic use. They were, in any event, rare and precious objects.

After Kaogu Xuebao, 1988, no. 2:205, northerly in the area of Beijing.29 However, one notes a larger concentration of objects in the lower Yangzi region, accompanied by a gradual thinning-out as one moves away from that region. Conversely, within the region once covered by the kingdom of Chu, where thousands of tombs have been excavated revealing very rich burial contents in a good state of preservation, only a single tomb?that of Changsha?contained one of these objects. Several factors suggest that Jiangsu-Zhejiang was the region of origin of all the incised vessels, no matter how distant the sites where they eventually ended up.30 No less than 23 objects have been discovered in the single province of Jiangsu, approximately half of the total 29. Cheng Changxin, "Beijing shi Tongxian Zhongzhaofu chutu yi zu Zhanguo qingtongqi," Kaogu, 1985, no. 8:649-703, esp. fig. 9. On the few fragments of an yi that are reproduced, fish are arranged head to tail together with motifs of waves on the spout, and underneath are two jars with ladles and a figure nearby holding a drinking cup. These are all standard motifs on incised pourers. 30. Other authors have also suggested that the technique of incising pictorial decoration originated in the lower Yangzi region, or more broadly the southeast region. However, they have done so on the basis of weak arguments. The fragments considered to be the earliest in date, which were found in two Jiangsu sites dated by the excavators to the end of the Chunqiu period, according to these authors display a still-primitive technique. They explain the presence of similar vessels at sites far away from Jiangsu with the hypothesis that the technique spread to Henan. This is notably the opinion of Du Naisong, "Tan Jiangsu diqu Shang Zhou qingtongqi de fengge yu tezheng," Kaogu, 1987, no. 2:1 69-1 74.

At the same time, all the themes identified above, with the exception of warfare, are illustrated on the Jiangsu objects?archery tournaments and hunting, as well as the scenes involving supernatural creatures. Despite this thematic diversity, their designs retain a stylistic coherence; they also share in common numerous minor motifs. At Gaozhuang (in Huaiyin county, Jiangsu), for instance, lines of trees, rows of inverted triangles, cordlike dividing lines, and intertwined serpents are recurrent motifs. Moreover, the Gaozhuang tomb contents include a small cover of convex form with a bird-shaped handle (fig. 13). This bird perched at the top of an object is characteristic of the local culture of the lower Yangzi region during the Warring States period, as seen on ceramics and bronzes (fig. 20).33 The decoration was incised with a stylus and depicts wild animals, birds, and a horned hybrid being with a double body shown full-faced. This cover closed a pot of a very special kind, as yet unparalleled. It is a globular jar on three feet. Joined to the central opening, which is very small (3.5 cm), are two cylindrical tubes (21 cm high). The excavators identify this relatively tall object (40.5 cm) as an incense burner. The body is, effectively, pierced with 31. Apart from the Gaozhuang tomb, which contained eighteen objects, two fragmentary vessels were discovered in two tombs in the county of Liuhe, at Heren and Chengqiao.

In addition, three objects, large fragments of which survive, were excavated from Wangjiashan tomb no. 1 at Jianbi in Dantu county near Zhenjiang. The objects were an yi pourer and two basins, a pan and a ?'?an. See Zhenjiang bowuguan, "Jiangsu Zhenjiang Jianbi Wangjiashan Dong Zhou mu," Wenwu, 1987, no. 12:24-37. 32. The sites in question are the Chengqiao tomb (object no. 20, fig. 18a) and the Wangjiashan tomb (objects nos. 7, 19, 33, fig. 12), datable to beginning of the fifth century b.c.e. See note 31. 33.

But if the form has no known equivalent, the light green glaze covering a pale grey body is characteristic of the ceramic production of the lower Yangzi region. Everything points to local production, therefore, not only the method of manufacture but the grooved decoration as well. The cover was made at the same time as the object, and in the same region, perhaps not far from the site where it was discovered. Once it is recognized that the incised pictorial bronzes from Jiangsu sites form a coherent group despite their iconographie diversity and that they were produced locally in the lower Yangzi region, it is not difficult to demonstrate that all the other incised pictorial bronzes, wherever they were discovered, are related to this group. In fact, one can begin by noting that several vessels discovered far from the lower Yangzi region are related to one or another of the vessels excavated in Jiangsu: for example, the basin from Sanji Gucheng in Hebei (fig. 4) compared with the basin from Wangjiashan (fig. 12b), or the pourers from Jinshengcun (fig. 6) and Zhonghuocun (fig. 7) in Shanxi compared with that from Wangjiashan (fig. 12a).

In all, 29 of the 35-40 known objects with a surviving spout or bottom are decorated with one of the above motifs. When all the different elements shared by all the incised bronzes are added together, it can be seen that these vessels form a homogeneous group, clearly distinct from any other class of metallurgical production. Their various characteristics can be listed as follows: the function (water containers, in most cases) their method of manufacture, by hammering, an atypical procedure in China, which made it possible to make light objects with very thin walls (less than a millimeter thick) the presence of riveted handles, little used in China the decorative technique, incising, otherwise unknown in China, which produces a "hair's width" line35 the placement of the decoration, preferentially on the interior surfaces of the vessels a rich iconography based on certain highly specific themes minor motifs shared by several objects and similarly organized on the vessel surface 35. This expression recurs in all the descriptions of decoration. 34. Another three pan basins have this same motif, as does one pourer of unknown provenance. And even if they differ from the other pourers noted in table 2, it is worth noting the close relationship between the pourer from Fenshuiling tomb no. 12 (Shanxi) and that from Heren (Jiangsu), the latter reproduced here in fig. 11. Once again, the link is confirmed between objects in metropolitan China and others discovered in Jiangsu. The Fenshuiling site is published in Shanxi sheng wenwu guanli weiyuanhui, "Shanxi Changzhi shi Fengshuiling gu mu de qingli," Kaogu xuebao, 1957, no. 1:103-118, esp. fig. 2.</page><page sequence="19">28 RES 35 SPRING 1999 One is thus tempted to view this entire group as the production of one and the same group of artisans from, and no doubt working in, the lower Yangzi region. This first conclusion entails further questions. How, for example, should one interpret such a broad distribution of objects across states as distant as Qin, Jin, Yan, Zhongshan, Qi, and Chu were from Wu and Yue? And does the relatively homogeneous character of this group of objects concord with the estimated dates given by the excavators for the sites in question? The unusual dispersion of all these vessels and objects may be due to several reasons. It is possible that unlike the cast bronze vessels, whose decoration belongs to a many-centuries-old tradition, the pictorial designs on the incised bronzes held a certain fascination because of their novelty and iconographie diversity, and that they were therefore much in demand. Moreover, even if these objects required great skill on the part of the artisans who made them, they did not necessitate the elaborate workshop infrastructure of cast bronze vessels. The latter required the supply of large quantities of metals, clay, and fuel. They could only be produced in foundries with a complex organization ensuring a division of labor among the artisans. The manufacture of a hammered vessel, in contrast, could be undertaken by one, or perhaps two, artisans.36 One might also speculate that this simplicity in the organization of labor may have enabled these artisans, more easily than others, to take their art with them far from their home area of the lower Yangzi region.37 In such a case, no doubt still exceptional in the China of the fifth century B.c.E., not only would the objects have circulated, but also their makers. It is difficult to say more on this question, since we remain ill-informed with regard to the status of artisans at the time?they probably had little personal freedom. The group of incised bronzes presents a definite homogeneity, whose characteristics I have outlined. However, when one compares the various objects, stylistic differences are also to be seen, as between the decoration of the basin from Sanji Gucheng (fig. 4) and that of the pourer from Jinshengcun (fig. 6), despite the fact that these were excavated at sites separated by no more than 150 kilometers (as the crow flies). In my estimation, the manufacture of incised pictorial decoration probably lasted several decades at least, but not more than a century (calculating generously). There is not a sufficiently significant evolution in the treatment of the decoration for its development to be considered a very long one. An estimate of this kind is, of course, subjective, but it is corroborated by two factors. On the one hand, the manual procedure left room for great freedom of expression on the part of the artisans, a freedom evident in numerous small details, such as the depiction of edifices and their roofs (figs. 4, 11, 12). On the other hand, despite this potential freedom, the choice of themes never departs from a certain range, while the compositions are limited to models transposed from one decorative program to another, and the secondary motifs remain approximately the same. This unity could not have been long maintained without external artistic elements, and also economic and social factors, upsetting or destroying it. Since this seems not to have happened, the manufacture can only have lasted for quite a limited period, at least in the forms identified here.38 Because of the wide distribution of sites, the archaeological contexts of the discoveries are extremely varied. Given the general problems posed by the chronology of Eastern Zhou period tombs, based on a few dependable reference points but above all on complex comparative studies, it is not possible here to enter into the question of dating in any detail. On the whole, the dates proposed by the Chinese excavators can be retained. Among the 20 or so known sites, the Jinshengcun tomb occupies a central place. It is the only 36. Donald Wagner, writing on iron metallurgy, has noted that the Wu-Yue region was characterized by small workshops, on a scale far below that of the workshops of central China or Chu {Iron and Steel in Ancient China [Leiden and New York: E. J. Brill, 1993], pp. 142-144). Only the pushou masks were cast, but these were small objects that the artisans must have been able either to obtain from elsewhere or to cast themselves. 37. This is a complex question since it bears on the very organization of society. In order to verify the hypothesis, one would need to have information that can be found neither in the texts of the period available to us nor in other sources. Donald Wagner (ibid., chap. 3) has demonstrated both the uniqueness of Wu-Yue culture and the particular aptitude of its inhabitants for metallurgy. 38. Some other objects also exist with incised decoration, but of a very different character. One example is a hammered bronze box decorated with geometric motifs incised with a stylus, which was discovered in Baoshan tomb no. 4, near Jiangling (Hubei). This Chu tomb is datable to the fourth century b.c.e. The box possesses a form and style of decoration quite different from that of the objects in the general corpus. See Hubei sheng Jing-Sha tielu kaogudui, Baoshan Chu mu (Beijing: Wenwu chubanshe, 1991), fig. 189.</page><page sequence="20">Thote: Intercultural relations as seen from Chinese pictorial bronzes 29 site for which the temporal parameters can be determined with some accuracy, circa 475-425 b.c.e. The other sites are considered to be from "the end of the Spring and Autumn period" (Heren and Chengqiao sites in Jiangsu) and "beginning of the Warring States period" (Changsha in Hunan), with one of the latest, perhaps, being that at Gaozhuang (end of the fifth century b.c.e.).39 2. Inlaid pictorial bronzes The vessels with pictorial decoration inlaid with a kind of pigmented paste are much better understood than the incised bronzes, no doubt because of the sumptuous effect created by their colors.40 The intentional contrast of colors that characterizes them is all the more visible, since the registers of decoration are displayed on the exterior surfaces of the vessel and never on their interior surfaces. And yet the scale of the depicted scenes is not larger than on the incised bronzes. Numerous other differences separate the inlaid bronze vessels from the incised ones, even though some of the same themes are illustrated; these are seen not only in the techniques employed, but also in the spirit of the decoration. Furthermore, the forms of the vessels are different. They are, for the most part, food vessels (stem cups [dou] and oval cups [zhou]) and vessels that either held drink (hu) or, in the case of basins (jian), held water to cool down or warm up the drink. Large in scale, these latter basins are unrelated in their function to the small incised basins sometimes associated with pourers (y/).41 While the pictorial designs created with inlay survive in large numbers and are well represented in museum collections, only a small proportion are of known provenance. Less than ten come from identified sites, and two of these are paired: in 1923, a dou inlaid with a kind of red paste (Liyu site, Hunyuan county, Shanxi)42 in 1935, a pair of basins (jian) (Shanbiaozhen Tomb, Jixian county, Henan)43 in 1951, a hu with pigmented-paste inlaid decoration (JiagezhuangTomb no. 5, Tangshan county, Hebei)44 in 1965, a hu (Baihuatan Tomb no. 10, Chengdu municipality, Sichuan) (figs. 2-3)45 in 1977, a pair of hu (Gaowangsi hoard, Fengxiang county, Shaanxi)46 in 1981, a dou originally bearing inlay of a pigmented paste or another unidentified material (Sanji GuchengTomb no. 8101, Pingshan county, Hebei) (fig. 14)47 Thus there are only six sites, which moreover are widely distributed between Sichuan and the far eastern part of Hebei (fig. 1 ).48 The datings of the various sites cover a period of a little more than a century, from the first half of the fifth century for the sites considered the earliest (Liyu, Jiagezhuang, Gaowangsi) to the beginning of the fourth century (Baihuatan). Given the period of use of the objects (and their geographic distribution) before they were deposited in the tombs, this temporal spread 39. See note 22. The tomb furnishings were only partially preserved. Since the exterior coffin was of compartment construction, the excavators considered it evidence for a Chu influence, which could only have been exerted from the end of the fifth century b.c.e. onward. In this author's opinion, however, the furnishings show no Chu influence and are of diverse character, including some pieces? notably, a brazier?from the second half of the sixth century b.c.e. The tomb is thus probably of fifth-century date, but it is not possible to be any more specific. 40. The present article takes into account only those inlaid bronzes whose decoration is comparable in its subject matter to that of the incised vessels, in other words, Charles Weber's categories VIII and IX (see note 4, pp. 169-223). I leave aside his group VII. 41. The large-scale jian basins are roughly 30 cm high and 50 cm in diameter.

The most recent funerary items at a site, through comparison, provide an approximate date for the site in question. In particular, the group of bronzes from Liyu, typical of metallurgical production from Houma at the height of its activity, furnishes the most dependable dating, in the first half of the fifth century b.c.e.49 An examination of the vessels reveals that the inlays were produced using one specific process, which was probably subject to local variation: recessed areas were cast in the vessel and later filled with a colored substance. Since the pigmented paste is red on the Liyu dou and on the hu from Jiagezhuang, the inlay has often been erroneously reported as copper.50 On other bronzes, such as the hu from Chengdu Baihuatan, in Sichuan, the initial color and nature of the inlay are difficult to establish. About ten themes appear on the Baihuatan vase, which is the densest in iconographie terms and the most complete. The following themes are depicted: a scene of tree harvesting; an archery contest; a libation scene in an architectural setting?no doubt the victory 49. Robert W.

These scenes are depicted in separate registers, and some of them are juxtaposed within a single register. A comparison of the hu and the dou appears to demonstrate that such juxtapositions were left to the initiative of the artisans (or patrons), giving rise to several variants. On the dou, the harvesting scene is depicted next to a hunting scene where a hunter is in combat with strange animals, whereas on the hu the same scene is coupled with a pavilion from within which archers are shooting. In their visual organization, as well as their impersonal character, the scenes seem to function like quotations, or allusions. The principal register of the dou's cover includes, juxtaposed, a ceremony or celebration in a pavilion accompanied by music, war dances, and a hunt for wildfowl. On the hu, the same themes are illustrated in a register that also includes an archery tournament and figures under a tent resembling those who participate in the hunt for wildfowl. What is more, the large scene mixing hunters and wild or hybrid animals on the side of the cup is found in almost identical form on the Liyu dou and in an abbreviated version on the smallest register of the hu. It would appear that several scenes make reference to aristocratic life, illustrating ritual, pleasure, and martial activities, whereas the scene depicting the hunting of wild or supernatural animals seems, in contrast, to evoke the opposition between the world of civilization and the untamed natural world not yet dominated by human beings.52 The reference to aristocratic activities does not mean that the artisans depicted them simply because their contemporaries or patrons could recognize themselves in such activities. They no doubt had some more important goal in mind in choosing one subject over another. Nonetheless, whether the events they represented were contemporary or of the past, real or legendary, they located these events in a setting that they knew well, incorporating precise details that would establish the credibility of their images?details such as the musical instruments or the manner of kneeling on a platform when presiding over a gathering. A difficulty faces modern scholars in the interpretation of these images, however, that is inherent in the very principle of quotation noted earlier. The scenes appear to refer to larger-scale representations and clusters of representations that, together and perhaps in association with other representations as well, had an overall coherence. On the vessels, the scenes take on a short hand form (without necessarily losing legibility); the juxtapositions of scenes also vary, showing that the artisans were not bound by, or did not feel themselves bound by, any real constraints in their combination. It can be noted, however, that the Liyu dou and the hu from Jiagezhuang, which are a little earlier than the others, have as their principal theme the hunting of hybrid creatures and wild animals. The themes that refer to human society, on the other hand, appear to have been added to this first theme at a later point. The simple descriptions of the themes depicted on the inlaid vessels are enough to indicate a certain parallel with those on the incised vessels of the lower Yangzi region, notably in the inclusion of the archery contest, ceremonies in architectural settings, and hunting scenes. Yet, when one considers the inlaid vessels, they give a somewhat stereotyped impression, unlike the incised bronzes.53 The art of quotation seemingly practiced by the artisans responsible for the inlaid designs in fact takes advantage of the technique employed. If the inlaid decoration seems rather standardized and repetitive, it is because the mold in which the vessel was cast was made up of several sections stamped out of fresh clay in negative with matrices, which themselves were 51. This scene is sometimes unconvincingly interpreted as the depiction of the douhu, a game described in the Liji in which arrows are thrown into a vase. See E. von Erdberg Costen, "A Hu with Pictorial Decoration: Werner Jannings Collection, Palace Museum, Peking," Archives of Asian Art 6 (1952):18?32; Laurence Sickman, "Painting and Sculpture," in The Art and Architecture of China, 3d ed., ed. Laurence Sickman and Alexander Soper (Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, 1971), pp. 47-48. The description of the game is the subject of a chapter of the Liji ("Douhu"). See S?raphin Couvreur, M?moires sur les biens?ances et les c?r?monies (1899; reprint, Paris: Cathasia, 1950), vol. 2, part 2, pp. 591-599. 52. As suggested by Jacobson (see note 7), p. 77. 53. Numerous connections can be made between those vessels with inlaid decoration from archaeological sites and those in museum collections. Such connections reinforce the impression of somewhat standardized decoration, despite the precious character given by the inlay technique. Thus, for example, the Baihuatan hu can be related to the Curtis hu in the Mus?e Guimet, as well as other similar vessels; similarly, the Pingshan dou has an identical twin in the Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore. See Weber (see note 4), figs. 54-55, 67-68 (for hu) and 52, 66 (for dou).</page><page sequence="23">32 RES 35 SPRING 1999 reproduced with the aid of models.54 This highly sophisticated technique, which was perfected during the sixth century b.c.e., implies, by definition, the identical reproduction of the designs.55 It allowed the artisan to adapt the same design to different object forms. And indeed, it can be seen on the Baihuatan hu (fig. 3) that the archery contest in the upper register takes place . . . without a target. This was omitted simply because there was no room to include its negative image in the mold used to cast the vase. An omission of this kind could never have occurred on the incised vessels. In fact, the artisans who cast the hu proceeded in the same way with scenes as with interlace motifs, cutting them off wherever necessary; but in the case of interlace, such breaks had no harmful effect on the design. In other words, the introduction of entirely new decorative designs, which were more explicitly freighted with meaning than interlace, had no real effect on the artisans' manner of working. They felt as free as ever to break off or repeat the motifs when it was necessary from a technical point of view, whereas on the incised vessels no motif is ever cut off or even repeated in identical form on the same vessel (or even on other vessels). The manufacturing technique thus had a very strong effect on the conception of the inlaid designs. But an art of quotation is capable of accommodating repetitions, and for that matter, an incomplete image missing certain details must have retained a large part of its evocative power for the patrons. So it is hard to say whether the technique in question encouraged this mode of production of repetitive and economical images, or was simply a response to a latent or explicit request on the part of the patrons, or even just corresponded to the spirit of the times. Whatever the case, it made possible the development of an art of quotation that resonates with other, parallel practices of aristocratic society, including that of speechmaking.56 This method of design replication was developed in the foundries of the state of Jin at Houma (Shanxi). Indeed several elements allow us to see the inlaid pictorial vessels as products of those workshops. In the first place, there is a fragment of a clay model decorated with a scene of the harvesting of mulberry leaves that comes from the Houma site (fig. 15d). Its design corresponds to the motif depicted on the Baihuatan hu and the dou from Pingshan. But even more significantly, the minor ornaments play the role of workshop indicators or marks: the ducks in the round on covers, the geometric friezes, and the style of the pushou masks, the principle of which was apparently perfected in the Houma workshops (fig. 15a-c).57 All these elements mutually reinforce each other, leading to the hypothesis that these designs were produced by the artisans of Houma.58 3. Two distinct cultural environments Once the two areas of production of the pictorial vessels?Shanxi, home of the Jin state, and the lower Yangzi region, associated with the Wu and Yue cultures?are known, the depictions created in the two regions emerge as the expressions, or reflections, of two distinct cultural environments. The evidence lies as much in the themes shared by the two areas as in those specific to each. Close attention to the images reveals the presence not only of traces of the material culture of two different areas, but also of marked differences between two societies widely separated in space. The production centers, it is worth reminding oneself, were a thousand kilometers apart. Such a vast distance is significant at a time when transportation was slow and difficult within a China that was parceled out among several states that were more often in conflict than at peace with each other. By taking the existence of two pictorial traditions into account, it becomes possible to measure what, from a cultural point of view, united and divided the China of the fifth century b.c.e. It further helps us to identify the cultural 54. Using the same technique described by Bagley (see note 49). 55. By this period, China was capable of serial production, but of a kind that remained compatible with perfect quality of execution. See Robert W. Bagley, "Replication Techniques in Eastern Zhou Bronze Casting," in History from Things: Essays on Material Culture, ed. Steven Lubar and W. David Kingery (Washington and London: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1993), pp. 234-241. 56. Along different lines, it is known that the poems of the Shijing (Book of Odes) represented a very rich source of potential quotations for aristocrats, who constantly incorporated them into their speeches and remarks. See Fran?ois Martin, "La parole po?tique/' in Paroles ? dire, paroles ? ?crire, ed. Viviane Alleton (Paris: ?ditions de l'Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales, 1997), pp. 51-81. 57. Conversely, no examples of pushou are known on vessels produced either in Chu workshops or in workshops associated with Chu culture in the sixth-fifth centuries b.c.e. (sites of Xiasi in Xichuan county, Henan, sixth century b.c.e. and Leigudun, Suixian county, Hubei, circa 433 b.c.e.). 58.

There seems not to have been an important temporal disjunction between the two types of production. In the literature, there is a tendency to assume that because the incised designs are simpler, they are therefore earlier than the inlaid designs.59 However, as we shall see, the excavators7 drawings provide ample evidence that the former are at least as complex, if not more so, than the 59.

Moreover, at least two sites contained vessels of both decorative types: the hoard at Gaowangsi in Shaanxi and the tomb at Pingshan in Hebei (figs. 4, 14).60 Furthermore, several of the tombs containing incised vessels also contained bronze objects characteristic of Houma production from the first half of the fifth century b.c.e. and not before.61 It has already been noted that alongside the themes shared by the two traditions, others were specific to one or the other. This is summarized in table 3. The harvesting of mulberry leaves, hunting of wildfowl, attack on a walled town, and naval battle (fig. 3) do not appear on the incised bronzes. The victory ceremony for the archery contest always takes place in an architectural setting in the Houma versions, underscoring the solemnity of the event, whereas in the lower Yangzi images, it may just as well take place outside, no doubt next to the archery area.

The incised designs also show landscape elements (cave-mountains on which grow trees, rows of trees) and scenes with supernatural beings?themes that are excluded from the Houma repertory. An entire strange world of hybrid beings seems to inhabit nature right next to scenes of lower Yangzi aristocratic life (fig. 16). If one adds to these the numerous scenes in which all sorts of hybrid beings, reminiscent of descriptions in the Shanhaijing, are depicted, it would appear that the lower Yangzi was a region particularly rich in legendary lore, which had a powerful hold on its inhabitants.62 The pictorial conventions employed at Houma are, again, different from those of the lower Yangzi, confirming that the images come out of two milieux working independently of each other, even if the shared themes and the geographic distribution of the objects attest to exchanges between them.63 On the incised bronzes, for example, in order to compensate for the 62. These scenes are excluded from the present study. 63. In light of the archaeological discoveries made so far, the geographic distribution of objects with inlaid decoration and incised decoration would appear to suggest a diffusion from the lower Yangzi region toward central and north China, as far as Houma in Shanxi, rather than the opposite (from Houma toward Jiangnan). But it can</page><page sequence="26">Thote: Intercultural relations as seen from Chinese pictorial bronzes 35 Figure 16.

It might be objected that this is a representational device dictated by the technique employed, which may be true up to a point. But in the end, this explanation does not fully account for the differences in pictorial convention. On ?mages from the lower Yangzi region, the roofs of architectural structures, for example, are frequently "open to view" in the middle, as a modern draughtsman might show the interior of a dwelling at the same time as its exterior (figs. 4, 1 7b). The goal of the lower Yangzi artisans, it would seem, was to display the whole scene taking also be noted that certain pictorial conventions, such as the balustrades of the buildings depicted on the inlaid bronzes, recur on the cup in the Shanghai Museum (stylistically, one of the latest objects in its group, very likely dating from the second half of the fifth or beginning of the fourth century b.c.e.). This would suggest an influence from Houma on the lower Yangzi region. No doubt exchanges took place in both directions, in a sort of to-and-fro movement. place inside, together with a bit of the roof. At Houma, on the other hand, the one- or two-story palaces or temples are shown in section along their full length (fig. 1 7a, c), with the result that certain structural details are exposed to view. Still more interesting, since it is an absolutely consistent rule, ding tripod vessels are represented in section in lower Yangzi depictions (fig. 1 7d), thus revealing their contents to view, whereas on the Houma vessels the exterior decoration of the ding tripods is sketchily depicted, which prevents the viewer from seeing what they contain (fig. 1 7c). In addition, in the first case, all three legs of the ding are depicted, but only two in the second. In other words, the artisans of the incised vessel tradition sought to be as explicit as possible in providing details or decorative elements that they considered particularly important, whereas decorative inlay was an art that went straight to the representational essential, even if this meant being more abstract.

The observable differences between the two families of decoration are not restricted to pictorial conventions alone. The incising technique must have allowed greater freedom to the artisans, with the result that the images they created teem with details of material life, which are missing from the Houma imagery. The tables or trestles, for example, that support jars for beverages, appear in numerous variations in the lower Yangzi images. These tables are quite high compared with the figures standing beside them, whereas in the Houma images, the tables are low (fig. 1 7c-d). Above all, it is the depiction of architecture that appears to be of unusual richness in the lower Yangzi region. Many buildings are raised, standing on poles (figs. 4, 11-12, 16, 17b), in contrast with the structures depicted at Houma, which seem to have been erected on low earthen foundations, or to have two stories (figs. 3, 1 7a, c). This probably reflects a difference between the buildings constructed on piles, in the humid terrain of the Lower Yangzi region, and those of central China, built on stamped-earth platforms.64 The roofs of the former appear very complex, sometimes incorporating different levels. Numerous other details attract one's attention on the incised bronzes. For example, the vessels represented in groups of twos and threes, from which various figures extract a beverage using ladles, are not unlike the large, covered stoneware jars stamped with geometric motifs that are characteristic of the lower Yangzi region.65 Certain forms, with strongly marked shoulders (fig. 1 7b, d) or globular bellies (figs. 4, 6-7, 11) seem to owe nothing to bronzes. Other details specific to the Lower Yangzi images include several different, though not clearly identifiable, species of trees (figs. 4, 6-9, 11-12, 16, 17b, d, f). Like the very realistic battle scene noted earlier (fig. 10), the hunting scenes give the impression of having been taken from life, showing the prey being hunted down by the dogs, followed by the beaters (fig. 1 7f). One other scene is particularly revealing of the originality of Lower Yangzi culture, associated with the Yue peoples. It is found in notably different contexts on a b Figure 18.

It shows a figure seated, or perched, on a sort of stool, with legs pendant in the European style. Such a depiction cannot but strike one as astonishing in the ancient Chinese context (compare with the depictions 64.

In addition to the Jiangsu tombs already mentioned, in which objects with incised decoration have been found and which all contain jars of this kind, see, for example, Shaoxing shi wenwu guanlichu, "Zhejiang Shaoxing shi faxian de yinwen yingtaoqi he yuanshi qingciqi," Kaogu, 1996, no. 4:29-35.</page><page sequence="29">38 RES 35 SPRING 1999 10 cm Figure 19.

It was noticed very early on. See Mich?le Pirazzoli-t'Serstevens, "De la natte ? la chaise/' Critique 357 (February 1977):185. 67. Such cups have no equivalent among ritual bronzes. Similarly, cups of truncated form are held by the participants in numerous ceremonies depicted on both inlaid and incised vessels. They are usually described by Chinese archaeologists as gu. In fact, the gu is a ritual vessel that fell out of use at the beginning of the Zhou dynasty. These are probably objects made of perishable materials that did not belong to the usual repertory of ritual vessel forms. In fact, given that these ceremonies honor the archer who is victorious in the contest, the images do not depict ritual activities but rather festivities for which there was no reason to use bronze. This explains the presence of large ceramic jars and drinking cups for domestic use. In this contrasting treatment of dress, I see evidence for the coexistence of different customs, with one group of people still strongly marked by local Yue culture and the other already sinicized or originating from another, more central region of China. This coexistence of differently dressed people, seemingly engaged without distinction in the same activities?archery, for example (compare fig. 12a-b)?can be observed in many of the lower Yangzi images discussed here. One of the rare depictions of a figure seated in the European style is found on a situ la (a bronze pail object characteristic of the Yue cultures of southern China) discovered in the tomb of the second king of Nan Yue at Guangzhou (Canton) (fig. 19).68 Perhaps this is no more than a 68. While the tomb dates from the second century b.ce., the object may be a little older, dating from the third century.

What is more, it is worth noting the presence on the Canton boat, where a human sacrifice is depicted, of a head suspended from the prow. Similarly, the Gaowangsi battle scene (fig. 10) shows several heads attached, like trophies, to the warriors' lances. Although in this case head-hunting is certainly not involved, to my knowledge the parallel with the Canton depiction is not matched by any image from Houma or, for that matter, from anywhere in central China in the fifth century b.ce. Overall, the lower Yangzi designs reveal, it seems to me, a mixed culture in the process of sinicization. The region must have been inhabited by populations of different origins, recognizable by the adoption of customs of dress specific to the central regions of China and by the presence of local traits and objects with a distinctively southern character. Certain figures probably belong to a different ethnic group, or there were some in that society who maintained older, distinctive traditions of clothing in contrast to the others. More simply expressed, the sinicization of the local population in the fifth century b.ce. was as yet only partial, as shown by several depictions in the round of tattooed figures, locally cast in the lower Yangzi region (fig. 20). It is known from some early texts that tattooing was practiced in south China over a very long period.69 The two groups of images that have been discussed here, from the state of Jin and the southern states of Wu and Yue, bear witness in the first place to the links that existed among these different states. Only interregional exchanges, particularly among royal and princely courts, can explain the similarities that exist. The thematic connections that were exploited in these designs concern the royal or aristocratic way of life in 69. Peters (see note 64). have not benefited from intense archaeological campaigns in the same way as the Central Plain, with the result that our knowledge of them remains cursory. See Guangzhou shi wenwu guanli weiyuanhui et al., Xi Han Nan Yue wang mu (Beijing: Wenwu chubanshe, 1991), figs. 37-38.</page><page sequence="31">40 RES 35 SPRING 1999 the two regions, the exchanges between which are reflected in the images. In their mode of life, aristocrats living more than a thousand kilometers from each other shared certain activities, such as archery, and the patrons of the vessels wanted these activities visualized. At the same time, our comparisons have revealed, in the details of the scenes, notable differences between the societies from which these aristocrats came and which they dominated. In particular, the decoration of the incised vessels reflects the existence of a separate culture, distinct from that dominant in central China. The clearest proof of its specific character lies in the representation, alongside the civilized world, of a wild one inhabited by supernatural creatures. This other world is marginal, but directly juxtaposed with the environment in which human beings operate. The culture that produced these highly unusual images is one in the process of sinicization. We can see under our eyes the acculturation taking place in the lower Yangzi region in the fifth century b.ce. Apparently, this process was far from completed at that point in history. The regional society retained pronounced local traits, while the ruling class, that is, the aristocracy of Wu and Yue, had partly adopted the customs, rituals, and numerous other practices specific to the states of the central Chinese plain. In these images produced by the aristocracies of Jin and Wu-Yue in two different cultural contexts, there is the presence of two milieux, each with its own distinct mentalit?, and one of which is on the road to sinicization.
