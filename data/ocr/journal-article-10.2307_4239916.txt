<plain_text><page sequence="1">STRUCTURES OF APPREHENSION 1 George E. Slusser Structures of Apprehension: Lem, Heinlein, and the Strugatskys Fantasy [fantastyka] is richer! The Strugatskys 1. If science is knowledge, to what degree can we call SF epistemological fiction? The question is an abiding one for Stanislaw Lem. In his essay "Metafantasia: The Possibilities of Science Fiction," he faults both "experi- mental" fiction and SF for "cognitive inadequacy," by which he means that neither "draw[s] upon the paradigmatics of transformations" that character- ize modem science (p. 197).1 Simply put, there are more things in Heaven and Earth than can be dreamed of in the fictional process as it stands. Fic- tion's "models and methods of reasoning" are rigid and simplistic because they derive from myth and fairy tale. But today fiction should have one "theme" only: "the problems of categorizing and articulating new pheno- mena" (ibid., p. 196). Instead of heroism, what is called for is active "des- cription," the rapid and radical reorganization of concepts that has created scientific revolutions in our time. Fiction can no longer concern itself solely with the structure of the thing described; it must focus on the "structure of the description itself"...and in doing so, become epistemological fiction. But does Lem think his ideal is realizable? He implies there are things inherent in the very process of fiction that ensure it will always be cogni- tively inadequate. Its descriptive models remain crude because they are necessarily "humanized"-i.e., shaped by human beings in their own image. Nature as the scientist sees it, however, is morally neutral; things relate there in a mathematical rather than an existential order. Light can be both a wave and a particle because we have no moral "stake" in this duality. This is an order logically "inferred," not directly perceived (in fact, to choose one model, even in a perceptual sense, is to occlude its complement from sight). Indeed, such direct contact brings back the moral or "humanizing" tempta- tion. Clearly, science itself is acting to "dehumanize" or de-metaphorize the terms it uses for its models. By means of "objective" descriptions, concepts like "noise" and "chaos" are cleansed of valuative meanings, placed as facts and nothing more. The same is true of "singularity," a term which, despite strong metaphoric overtones, is given a carefully neutral meaning</page><page sequence="2">2 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 16 (1989) by cosmologists. It is that property of a black hole where, as Lem says in "*Cosmology and Science Fiction," fiction "goes to pieces": "What heroic characters, what plot can there be where no body, however strong or hard, could exist longer than a few fractions of a second?" (p. 207). Even physics as descriptive system, Lem fears, may go to pieces here too. On one level, these two models-science and fiction-are oppositional. On another, they can be complementary (in the Bohrian sense). But finally, in the face of the cosmos, both may be, for Lem, futilely inadequate. In the light of epistemology, then, is science fiction possible at all? True SF, Lem tells us in his essay on Philip K. Dick, should "reflect on the place that reason can occupy in the universe, on the outer limits of concepts formed on earth as instruments of cognition" (p. 111). Most existing SF Lem finds sadly wanting in such reflection. And the little he does see en- gaging the dilemma of human reason appears assured of defeat. His man of reason is Pascal's man without God. Limited by his lowly placement "on Earth," all he can ultimately know is that he is sentient, can think. Beyond this he cannot go-either to Pascal's despairing conclusion that the rest of the universe does not know or to the affirmation in faith that the other sen- tient form "out there" is God. Indeed, if (as Lem tells us) the eternal silence of these infinite spaces need no longer frighten us, their eternity can no longer console us either. He cannot rid his speculations of the existential anxiety that accompanies the Pascalian dilemma. His structures of cognition are what I would call structures of apprehension. In the case of epistemology and of fiction, both of which Lem sees hopelessly fixed in its "earthly" modalities, apprehen- sion seems the richer term. It means to perceive. But it adds to this a sense of physically taking hold of something and a further sense of feeling anxie- ty, which results from the tension between this need to take hold, to ground our speculations, and the apparently ever-growing epistemological gap between reason and nature. If SF, in the light of modern science, is to have status as epistemological fiction, Lem is surely right to invoke as yardstick Pascal's terrible sense of the unknowable, of the limits of human know- ledge, rather than the simplistic opposition of known and unknown. Lem's pursuit of the "possibilities" of SF would place us at the limits of fiction as well. Yet scientific description, as long as it remains part of fiction, will by the very human nature of the vehicle continue to convey the terror of knowledge as well as the silence of the infinite spaces it scruti- nizes. If we are to examine the epistemological nature of SF as it exists today, it must be as a structure of apprehension. The first test, of course, is the degree to which Lem's own fiction reveals the hold of "mythical" forms on SF's epistemological possibilities. His essays (and to a large degree his later "fictions") offer thought-experiments without human actors. Eschewing Pascal's recourse to "transcendence," Lem gives us, in "Metafantasia," the scenario of a cosmos governed by</page><page sequence="3">STRUCTURES OF APPREHENSION 3 "metagalactically plural reason" (p. 169). Here is a field-theory approach to the problem of cosmic silence-civilizations separated by such vast dis- tances that they cannot communicate directly, but only "infer" the existence of potential communicants from observed "gradual...changes in the laws of nature" (p. 166). The concept of civilization is self-defining: it is a culture that has become noticeable through "astrotechnical activities" (ibid.), which means capable of transforming nature to its own benefit. The result is not intergalactic conflict but a "cosmogonic game" (ibid.), a synchronicity of rational projects creating a field of harmony in the universe. Yet despite the almost Panglossian optimism of this "objective" vision, it is not entirely free of apprehension. Pascal's disproportion returns here with the assump- tion of a law of "psychozoic density" ("Metafantasia," p. 168): as the num- ber of rational civilizations grows, the universe expands proportionately so as to keep the same distance between them. We will always seek contact...and it will always elude us.2 But this, Lem admits, is cosmology, not humans, writing the fiction. When, in Solaris, he narrates the fiction of a search for contact, a very dif- ferent structure results. Grounded in the human activity of the quest, des- cription is inflected by doubt, and inference becomes inquiry. The structure is skeptical, tensely combining antithetical impulsions, offering descrip- tions that are always concluding and at the same time always inconclusive (skeptikos, we might remember, means inquiring). "I could be bounded in a nutshell, and count myself king of infmite space-were it not that I have bad dreams," says Hamlet. These "bad dreams" are the doubts that counter our theoretical (from theorein, to contemplate) attempts to bridge the infini- ty that separates mind from matter. They led Hume to posit that we are indeed bounded in the nutshell of our minds.3 The skeptic's relation to the outer world is one of claustrophobia. Solaris is perhaps an ironic parody of love and heroism, the results of more bad dreams, those which keep Pas- cal's humanity from staying alone in a room for half an hour. Yet in this novel we leam that if we are driven over and over to escape that solitary room, we are by our very attempts to do so doomed to stay there forever. Since Pascal perhaps, we could say that the basic figure of all fiction that would be science fiction is the oxymoron-the violent conjunction of opposites. In hopes of resisting the temptation of solipsism-the skeptic trapped in his or her own mental theater-Lem rigorously impales his seek- ers on the horns of this figure. This is perhaps why he so roundly damns SF that resolves contradiction in what he sees as a sentimental manner. Yet sentimentality, as much a product of the 18th century as is skepticism, represents an equally genuine-and valid-response to the same mind/ nature duality. Lem is essentially blind to the workings of this countercur- rent. But it is clearly at work in a novel that could just as easily lay claim to being philosophical fiction in the 18th-century manner, Heinlein's Time Enough for Love.</page><page sequence="4">4 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 16 (1989) Heinlein's hero proceeds by converting mind into a physical entity and extending it across the realm of material phenomena. If for the skeptic it is humankind's own image that, mirror-like, endlessly blocks attempts to know, the sentimentalist hopes to avoid this pitfall by "solidifying" that image, then expanding it materially in hopes that it will become coterminous with nature itself, forming what Laurence Sterne calls "the great Sensorium." The reaction of Sentimental Man, then, is more agoraphobic than claustrophobic-a mode of apprehension that refuses to go outside, that draws the alien inside to its most intimate core. Though body be finally extended to cover infinite space, there is no fusion of opposites. However much he cultivates feeling, his faculty of empathy with the world, the senti- mentalist can never abandon himself to feeling. Sterne's Sentimental Jour- ney offers encounters where the protagonist, "letting go" to the rush of feeling, experiences momentary estrangement, both from the world and from self. Yet in what remains a well-charted tourist's landscape, these alien encounters, because they are artificially cultivated, are brought under apparent rational control. Norbert Miller sees sentimentality as essentially an epistemological device-one that multiplies these apprehensions of the heart so as to "rub down" the sharpness of the paradox structure that under- lies them.4 Sentimentality reacts to skepticism but does not resolve its dilemma. As we shall see, in Heinlein, the oxymoron, however "rubbed down," still operates at the center of the sentimental dynamic. Skepticism and sentimentality are major Western responses to the pro- blem of "human understanding" that arose as the advancement of objective science radically altered the lines of communication between mind and nature, rendering the former singular, non-participatory, and finally antago- nistic in relation to the latter. Lem may be right that fiction is ultimately inadequate as vehicle for the workings of a mind engaged, not in action, but in acts of pure description. Solaris and Time Enough for Love, however, operating as they do on fiction's far borders, offer structures of apprehen- sion that can guide us in our exploration of the "possibilities" of SF. They are clear, if imperfect, instances. They are also representative: Lem of a large body of French and other Western European SF with roots in the same skeptical enlightenment, Heinlein of that American SF Lem rejects, with its transcendental materialism, its institutions absorbed by lengthened shadows of men (to echo Emerson). We do not, then, have pessimistic and optimistic visions (the categories are merely vectors) but contractive and expansive structures. And human structures. For in each knowledge retains human limits, with all that is knowable either projected in the theater of the mind or incorporated into that of the body. In neither is there any meaningful interaction between mind and matter. Instead of these either/or structures, modern science calls for a both/ and structure. This "complementarity," as science sees it, is the property of</page><page sequence="5">STRUCTURES OF APPREHENSION 5 descriptive systems. But how can it be the property of fictional systems as well? The classical epistemologies of skepticism and sentimentality, to the degree they cleave to human limits, remain at least compatible with fictional systems. But is not complementarity the "place" where fiction goes completely to pieces? Taking things fictionally, can a human being be two things at once? Can she or he be in two places at the same time, or operate in two distinct descriptive worlds? There is a third major area of SF-Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. This is a literature that seems to escape Lem's strictures-one that does not need to try to re-metaphorize a term like "complementarity" because it never fully succumbed to the process that objectified it in the first place. Indicative of a sort of continuity is this quotation from Gogol that prefaces Arkady and Boris Strugatsky's Monday Begins on Saturday (1977): "But what is the strangest, the most incomprehensible of all, is the fact that authors can undertake such themes-I confess this is altogether beyond me." More incomprehensible than comprehending the incompre- hensible is making fiction that seeks to do so-in other words, doing what Lem (or Heinlein) will not: treating epistemology and existence as part of a same structure and seeing no contradiction. Such a fiction would subsume the oxymoronic relation of human/alien into a structure where knowing and "confessing," a secular version of Pascal's faith, somehow function in com- plementary fashion, producing within the human universe that sense of irre- ducible strangeness Lem speaks about. The Strugatskys' Roadside Picnic is just such a "strange" novel. Discussed in comparison with Lem and Hein- lein-models it subsumes-it offers a third structure of apprehension: com- plementarity. 2. The problem Solaris poses is the advancement of learning through "contact" with what appears an alien life-form. The narrative, following Kelvin's arrival on Solaris, becomes a compendium of theories and hypo- theses humankind has formulated in hopes of understanding (and thus dominating) a seemingly sentient "ocean." We have not achieved meaning- ful contact with this entity; and the major reason for this, Lem seems to suggest, may come not from "it" but from us, from our capacity for doubt: "Contact means the exchange of specific knowledge, ideas, or at least find- ings, definite facts. But what if no exchange were possible?" (9:153). In this skeptical climate of opinion one of the scientists, Snow, doubts humankind's ability to perceive, not just new, but all worlds: "We think of ourselves as Knights of the Holy Contact. But this is another lie. We are seeking only Man, we have no need of other worlds. We need mirrors" (6:81). Snow is an extreme skeptic. But he hints at a deep mystery, isolated in our mirror desires, isolated inside our minds, that blocks our attempts to know external phenomena: "Man has gone out to explore other worlds and other civilizations without having explored his own labyrinth of dark pas- sages and secret chambers, and without finding what lies behind doorways</page><page sequence="6">6 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 16 (1989) that he himself has sealed" (10:165). Failing to know itself as precondition for knowing the other, humankind has let the past, in the form of some col- lective unconscious, dominate its drive for the future. With Rheya's appearance, the doorways to Kelvin's past become unsealed. But Rheya is more than that kind of liberating influence. Emerg- ing within a library world that is the repository for collective human memo- ry, she becomes, to Kelvin the scientist, a fundamental problem-that of the nature of the percept, of the knowability of things. On the one hand, Kelvin should know her intimately, for she is (finally) the exact replica of his dead wife.5 If this is "contact," then Solaris is merely acting as a mirror, summoning an apparition, in the flesh, from the dark passages of Kelvin's mind. As such, his cognitive future is no more than a reflection of his past. And thus a fiction. For as replica of his wife at the moment of her suicide, Rheya appears to offer Kelvin a second chance, the means of restoring a continuous relationship, of finishing unfinished business. On the other hand, however, she comes claiming that she is "not the woman you once loved" (9:150). The old form, impregnated with memories and past desires, at the same time demands to be taken as something new-as a present "raw" fact, something always 20 years old, a "singularity" obdurate both to our perceptions and our fictions. Lem links the technical and metaphorical senses of "singularity" in his article "Cosmology and Science Fiction": It must be admitted that the universe presents the 'peak of indigestibility' for fiction[-]writing in the whole field of our experience. For what can you do as an author with the central subjects of cosmology-with the singulari- ties? A singularity is a place that exists in the continuum just as a stone exists here. (p. 207) And Rheya is its fictional incarnation, the embodiment of that perceptual paradox that says that the new, if it is to be known at all, must resemble the old, and that the future is bounded by the past. But at the same time the new, if it is to be a thing-in-itself, can have no past-indeed, is "indigestible" to its forms. Rheya's presence thwarts scientific speculation and personal action alike. Through her there lies no way to understanding a past-the entity that "transmits" her. Nor is there a way to human relationship; for despite her demand to be taken anew, her presence only shunts Kelvin's life into the lies of fiction. Kelvin's attempts to deal with Rheya as a new phenomenon offer an itinerary of skeptical doubt in which humankind's illusions-both cognitive and sentimental-are stripped away one by one. Kelvin thinks he is capable of overcoming bad memories and wants to love the creature for what she is now. But her way of affirming that existence, it seems, is to repeat another -in this case, the suicide the "original" Rheya committed. After swallow- ing liquid oxygen, she awakens to ask: "Who am I then? And you, what are you?" (9:149). In seeking to answer these questions, Kelvin reenacts</page><page sequence="7">STRUCTURES OF APPREHENSION 7 Hume's questioning of the activity, and ultimately the existence, of the most basic concepts of interpersonal (and by extension inter-galactic) rela- tionship: "self' and "causality." As an act implying a choice to destroy the self, suicide in a sense vindicates the idea of self. Rheya's "suicide," how- ever, does not work, and this is perhaps because there is no self to destroy or vindicate. And if she is, as Snow suggests, "a mirror that reflects a part of [Kelvin's] mind" (10:162), then the experiment that will bombard Sola- ris with an encephalogram of that mind can only raise further questions about the existence of a self. Snow tells Kelvin that he must see his deal- ings with the apparition, not in terms of personal relationships, but as an experiment. The encephalogram is to be no more than the decoding and transmission of an objective structure, in hopes in turn of being "read" by the Ocean. But to Kelvin this structure cannot be neutral; it is a structure of desires and designs, a self he feels ironically responsible for, even if its designs are unknown to him: "Am I responsible for my unconscious?...If I want her to disappear, will it happen?" (10:164). This other question is one of causal linkage. Sartorius's two experiments -the x-ray bombardment and the neutrino "annihilator"-appear to make a connection, for after the appearance of new forms, the "wings of foam," provoked by the bombardment, Sartorius succeeds in disintegrating the apparitions. But is this relationship causal? And is it due to contact which results in mutual understanding between "selves"? Kelvin's situation reminds us of Hamlet here. What we see may not be objective forms but our own mental structures. We may not be "kings" of alien space, and our "understanding" is perhaps no more than the feedback of "bad dreams." What Kelvin experiences, in the theater of his mind, are terrifying visions of self in flux, dissolving and reforming. In this dream sequence, with its sense of total loss of self in a "state of pure perception," followed by a reconstruction of that sense of self percept by percept ("until now, I thought I saw, but had no eyes: now I have eyes" [12:187]), we have a perfect example of Hume's process of perception. Kelvin is drawn, following an act of doubt that dissolves all sense of self, to reconstruct a concept of self from a primary sequence of "impressions." Self is no longer a first cause from which we deduce relationships; it is an inductive effect. But effect of what? Impressions are most likely made, and in both directions: something gets an impression of us, and we of it. But these are, at best, "contacts" in the singular sense-a sequence of percepts, facts, data. From these we may learn the "what"-in this case, the physical nature of a carbon- or neutrino-structure contact in the singular sense. But can we know the "why"? Just as the self eludes us to the degree that the skeptic can doubt whether it exists, so the same is true of those deeper motivations we consider necessary for "true" understanding of alien nature. The quandary is clear here. On the one hand, human beings are not content with objective impressions. They must read intentions and causes into them-in this case,</page><page sequence="8">8 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 16 (1989) posit that the Ocean "grasped" Kelvin's mind and acted on the wishes of a secret "self." But on the other hand, if this is true, then contact is a triumph that can only bring epistemological anguish. Snow surmises the alien may have wished to give us "presents"; Kelvin denounces these as "psychic vivisection." Not the least pain comes from the possibility that these theor- ies are only projections of the human mind's desire to create a self out of the act of having it flattered or violated. To Kelvin, whose created self strives to be "tragic," Snow may have the last, choric word: Kelvin, he says, is struggling "to be human in a situation beyond morality" (10:151). And that situation (in terms of another Oedipean metaphor) is one of "blind" probings: "'It' removed the deepest, most insolated imprint, the most 'assimilated' structure, without necessarily knowing what it meant to us" (13:201). Snow remains a spokesman of scientific doubt: his message is that, because of perceptual limitations, we can never know the meaning of Sola- ris's structures. But Kelvin learns that we cannot know the meaning of our own structures either, those of human relationship. These are the most treacherous, because we think we know them and yet do not. Rheya may be a singularity. But as long as her form is familiar, Kelvin will not kick her like a stone. Nature is not imitating us here (that would again flatter our sense of "self"); we imitate or reproduce our desires, summon the alien in familiar form (as "mimoids") to blind us. This raises, for Kelvin, the fiction of natural "law." These are mind-forms that do not legislate, in a causal sense, the movements of natural phenomena, but at best imitate them. Once this is seen, the "revolt" of humankind-scientific or otherwise-against them, as something that governs our existence as material beings, becomes not tragic but absurd: "We all know we are material creatures, subject to the laws of physiology and physics, and not even the power of all our feel- ings combined can defeat those laws. All we can do is detest them" (14:21 1). And Kelvin sees that if science, promising us a future through legislation of material nature, is an illusion, then love, that "age-old faith of lovers and poets" in the power of feeling over our material existence, is a lie. But a lie that-as we see with Kelvin's final hope for Rheya's return-is destined to repeat itself, to become a fictional "law," not of tra- gedy but of comedy. Kelvin finally, as scientific everyman seeking to master matter with mind, is drawn and quartered on the conceits of skepticism. "Are we," he asks, "to grow used to the idea that every man relives ancient torments, which are all the more profound because they grow comic with repetition?" (14:21 1). Indeed, in his relation to Rheya, he must endure a more dreadful paradox: that which links knowledge with pain. A final irony perhaps is that he succeeds in communicating with the alien through Rheya. He teaches her to be like himself, to seek human motivations and feelings, in short to become a moral being. But the result is only more inextricable</page><page sequence="9">STRUCTURES OF APPREHENSION 9 anguish. Earlier she is aware of this condition as something cruelly para- doxical; she is "an instrument of torture which loves you and wishes you nothing but good" (9:151). Now her "suicide" note is full of well-meaning torture: she chose her fate; Snow is a good man; you, Kelvin, are not res- ponsible. If the only way to forget the pain of this scientific "experiment" is to treat Rheya as an inevitable error in method, then her note, asking him to see his folly, and his recasting of the alien as a moral being, as successful, are too much for Kelvin to bear. With her disappearance Kelvin's existence in skepticism-isolated in his own mind, a place where dreams of past and future deny all possibility of engagement with the phenomenal present- becomes a void of pain. He must "hope for nothing, yet live in expecta- tion"; love is no more than the anticipation of "cruel miracles" (14:21 1). 3. Heinlein appears to offer the sentimental opposite to Lem. If his SF recognizes the paradoxes of cognition, it is to manipulate them as means of making the phenomenal world obey the individual's deepest desires. The alien encounter, for Heinlein, does not require dissection and disintegration of self; it is rather the chance to impose self on world, to substitute "love" for death. Which brings us to our titles. Solaris is an irony that limits inquiry before it begins; for to give the alien a name is to suggest, beforehand, that the goal of any human quest for knowledge is to domesticate, and that per- ception is a redundant act. Time Enough for Love, however, is not a name but a phrase. It is open to the extent we must complete it, by wish, com- mand, or simple declaration of fact-the very opposite of Lem's "lie." The title spells out clearly that love is not, as in Lem, inversely related to time. In Lem, this act of swelling the past proportionately shrinks future promise, cognitive or otherwise. To Heinlein, on the contrary, love is not bound by the past, but strives to use that past to ensure the existence of a future-its future. In physical terms, the relation of space station (the place of inquiry) to Solaris is a claustrophobic one. And the name Kelvin, given to its archetypal scientist, is a like huddling place: the name of that famous man who closed off his century of inquiry by declaring there was no more to be known. The physical landscape of Heinlein's novel, however, is agoraphobic, and the name of its hero, Lazarus Long, one to grow into rather than one to get out of. It seems the perfect sentimental vehicle, linking the ability of a single man to resurrect himself in his own flesh through the possibility of physical extension over long reaches of time and space. At one end of the scale, Lazarus is the seed from which the Howard Family has sprung; he is Methu- selah, near-immortal in his lifespan, yet born of mortals. At the other end, he is Cronus, the patriarch who not only outlives his long-lived progeny, but spawns them in order to devour them and by doing so further extend control over the galaxy. In this novel, however, his problem is that he appears to have reached his physical limits, to have run out of world and time. His lovemaking has made everybody "family." And his longevity has</page><page sequence="10">10 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 16 (1989) made it possible for his offspring to discover longevity drugs that make them all co-equal with Lazarus. Knowledge here, as active faculty of curio- sity, is not antithetical to engaging the phenomenal world, but in fact syn- onymous with it. If in Lem the paralysis of paradox comes from irreducible cleavage between mind and world, here a like paralysis derives from the exact overlapping of body-the extended career of Lazarus Long-and world. "Advancement" of learning is to be taken literally here. In a world where all bodies become co-extensive, there is no place left to go. If Lem's limits are those of the mind, Heinlein's are those of the body. But the individual not the collective body. The group entity in Have Space Suit, Will Travel (1958), for example, is not greater but lesser than the sum of its parts, for it is bound by the past traditions that comprise its "wisdom." Instead, it is young Kip in that novel who can shout, at its bar of cosmic justice, that the individual human should live because he or she has no limits. This claim to a dynamic future proves so mystifying to the group mind (acting a bit like Solarists) that it agrees to suspend all judgment on humankind until it can "ponder" the problem-giving individuals like Kip what Heinlein promises Lazarus: a reprieve, more time. But finding more time for love poses a problem of the present-of the directly and singularly perceived "fact"-just as much as it does for Lem (albeit in inverted fashion). The appearance of a Rheya would not throw Heinlein's seeker into the past but into the future. For in his world something present exists not only as a limit to be superseded, but as something more to be incor- porated into the individual body. If Lem and Heinlein offer antithetical structures of cognition, then the conflict between them centers on two problematic aspects of presentness: suicide and solipsism. The possibility of suicide hovers everywhere in Solaris. But it proves a futile act, one that actually creates a self in the pro- cess of destroying it. And as an act that moves the actor from the realm of matter to that of mind-both Rheya and Gibarian, earlier suicides, return as insubstantial, repeatable forms: simulacrum and tape recording-suicide becomes the means of preserving a self by never having it engage a mate- rial present. When Rheya finally engages the substantive present of the annihilator, she exits the feedback loop. But not quite, for Kelvin will not let her image go from his mind. Like all other quests for contact in Solaris, the final commitment to self too becomes a lie. As with all such fictions, it is rejected by Lem as another exercise in solipsism. In "Cosmology and Science Fiction," Lem describes the sort of SF Heinlein writes as promising humankind the cosmos only to "dream away its defeat in onanistic delusions and chimeras" (p. 206). The substitution of onanism for solipsism is significant, and sheds light on Time Enough for Love. Lazarus, in his physical search to know the universe, has reached an impasse-not a library of Solaristics but a hedonistic "utopia" where no further sensory exploration seems possible. With no place left to act, the</page><page sequence="11">STRUCTURES OF APPREHENSION 11 only exploratory act that remains to Lazarus is suicide-testing the limits of the expanded body by doing away with it. Kelvin becomes a solipsist when he denies the fact of Rheya's death. For him, her leave-taking is only a retreat to the never-resolved realm of mind-forms, where he hopes later to retrieve her. Playing past desires against future hopes, Kelvin erects the concept of suicide against the possibility of any real, physical act of self- destruction. Lazarus is faced with a more direct problem, for his organ of knowledge is the body, and suicide in physical terms must necessarily des- troy that. What Lazarus needs is a feedback loop like Kelvin's, but on the corporeal level. And he creates one by converting suicide not into solipsism but into onanism: a "death" that is physically renewable within the closed loop of bodily function. In this context of the "great sensorium," or world as individual body, we are justified in calling onanism an epistemological device. As sentimen- tal analogue to solipsism, the act of playing with oneself becomes the means whereby the world-body explores-and hopes to extend by a series of less cruel paradoxes-the limits of its existence. The past that holds Kel- vin is the mystery of his unconscious mind. Lazarus's past is a kind of phy- sical unconscious. His longevity is not, like that of subsequent Howards, the product of controlled breeding, but of some genetic accident. Lazarus, then, cannot fix his cause. And this proves fortunate; for his physical self, however bounded in its utopian present, contains this wild or random seed that he still can shoot, if only in onanistic acts, into the future that his world-body seems to deny him. For Lazarus onanism becomes, literally, a "hand job"-an act of indi- vidual tinkering with the structures of knowledge and being, an engineer's version of Sterne's sentimental process. Heinlein speaks elsewhere of "paradoctoring" the paradoxical ("All You Zombies-" [1959], p. 344). And for Lazarus, where body and world are one, this can only mean, physi- cian heal thyself. Utopian time-that invariance created by longevity-has circumscribed love, turned it into a circular, chiastic structure of acts that are ever-new, yet ever-predictable. The way Lazarus chooses to confront this impasse-more stalemate than conflict-is to ejaculate: to shoot the seed, even if on genetically barren ground, into places where extension and repetition has ruled out the possibility of fertile variants and where all future encounters are incestuous. Time travel, for Lazarus, is such an ejaculation. Lem considers time travel a mind-form-an "intellectual game," and ultimately a "delusional fantasy."6 To Heinlein and Lazarus, however, the game is a physical one, a means of embracing the circle of conception and death which defines the body while at the same playing with its boundaries. In the final scenes, Lazarus travels back in time to his (and Heinlein's) pre-World War I Mis- souri childhood. Here he confronts, as an adult, his mother in the flesh, and makes love to her. This is not, as Lem might have had it, an Oedipal fantasy,</page><page sequence="12">12 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 16 (1989) a sign of the hegemony of our mental past over our imagined acts. But neither is it the temptation of irresolvable paradox-here the possibility of closing the circle of life by creating oneself through an act of love with one's own mother. The solipsist might revel in such a "cruel miracle," for it seems the per- fect transposition of world into mind. Heinlein's onanist, however, does the opposite: he transposes mind and paradox into flesh. For Kelvin touching is, ultimately, a mental act: the presence of his hand, like the workings of his mind, shapes the "ocean" in its image. Limits are reinforced here by the absence of touch. Lazarus as time traveller instead wants to touch his biolo- gical origins, but only in order to play with them. He is not acting so much as re-enacting what must be (if life both as concept and as physical "flow" of energy is to retain validity) an untouchable limit: the moment of his own conception. The way to touch this untouchable is to return to the original time and place and refashion this moment out of that same flesh-to get as physically close to the vanishing point as possible without totally subsum- ing it, and in doing so engender a "sprung" paradox. To do this, Lazarus creates what could be called onanistic theater, mas- turbation as stagecraft. He returns in time in the role of a potential "father," an unrelated man, Theodore Bronson. His mother falls fatally in love with this familiar stranger-to the point where she desires an exact replay of the moment in which she conceived her favorite son, Lazarus. She stipulates the exact spot, the same conditions and clothes. But this is play-acting, a means of having forbidden physical pleasure without risking the conse- quences. As insurance, the time-double-a young Lazarus-is brought into the action. Stowing away in the car that takes the lovers to their simulated rendezvous with destiny, he is made to leap out at the last moment to pre- vent the deed. Such devices tend to wear down the tension of the threatened conceit. Lazarus (like Heinlein behind him) flirts with the single, irrevocable moment of conception in order not to commit himself to it and thereby set real limits to his existence. Raised here is unthinkable paradox-an uncreating of the created. But Lazarus blunts this paradox in the very act of maintaining, in titillating fashion, the purely formal possibility of its exist- ence. This is something similar in effect to the sentimental swoon. The swoon offers a cognitive escape valve-the cultivated ability to collapse into self at the split instant of empathy, of "feeling into" the other. It repre- sents, then, a bodily gesture towards the potentiality for communication and contact. Yet at the same time, there is no contact, for the swoon does not exceed, but merely reconfirms, the confines of the body that produces it. Lazarus cultivates, in the interval between the act and its unspeakable shad- ow, a space where he can take physical possession of the mother. He has made their "love" an onanistic act, a "paradoctored" swoon. Literal self-creation would be a form of suicide in this sense: that it turns the line of existence into a closed circle. Lazarus's gambit, however</page><page sequence="13">STRUCTURES OF APPREHENSION 13 -one of those famous "free energy" machines that hopes to tap the force of generation by controlling its external forms-aims at converting this same neat circle of self into the dynamic figure of the spiral. But can he do for ends what he does for beginnings? The time-travel paradox also offers him the possibility of witnessing his own death. Can he spring the final circle too? In the Sergeant Bronson episode, Lazarus again seeks to restructure paradox by means of onanistic fantasy. After his affair with mother Mau- reen, Bronson enters World War I and is apparently killed on the battle- field. But what for him is sacrifice, inspired by love, would be suicide for Lazarus; for the latter does not have to enter the empathic fictions of his time-surrogate, but apparently chooses to do so. Yet because this suicide is enacted by a double, it remains a staged act, a choice without consequence. And the "death" that ensues is no more than another swoon. The game Lazarus plays with time is elaborate. The final chapter, which includes both the Maureen and the Sergeant Bronson episodes, is entitled "Da Capo." And under this common heading what should be oppo- site limits-Lazarus's alpha and omega-make claims to being inter- changeable, and are thus mutually convertible in terms of a higher dynamic. In the first episode, returning to his biological beginnings, he plays with the limits of love in order to convert love into time. He does so by transforming the unique moment into a repeatable moment, one which now claims a spe- cious freedom from the hold of the past by offering a future of further replays. And in the second episode he plays with death, the limits of per- sonal time, in hopes of regenerating that end through an act of love that returns him, at least in play, to the original moment of his conception. Like Antaeus touching the earth, this "resurrection" purposes to open the circle into a dynamic spiral. Through Bronson, Lazarus engineers an onanistic harrowing of the original womb. A newspaper clipping tells us that the Ser- geant is not dead, only "missing in action." Bits of his flesh are picked up from the battlefield by time-travelling Howards and regenerated-this time as Lazarus, the sensorium that organizes all the scattered pieces of time and love-in the arms of a daughter who answers to the first mother's name: 'Maureen?' Lazarus murmured. 'I'm here, darling,' Tamara answered, cradling his head against her breasts. 'Bad...dream. Thought...I was... dead.' 'Just a dream, beloved. You cannot die.' (Coda 4:589) Solipsism, for Lem, is a totally closed form. The structuring figure of Heinlein's book, however, is not the unbreakable circle of paradox. It is the loose, sensuous return of a musical composition that, if circling back "da capo," at the same time opens out into a series of "codas," narrative flour- ishes that allow the story-line, as vehicle of Lazarus's extended body, to spiral away at the last minute from closure. In one of these codas, Lazarus, suspended in dream between death and reprieve, seems to encounter Lem's</page><page sequence="14">14 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 16 (1989) solipsistic mirror. But the figure in this mirror cannot hold Lazarus in the tyranny of paradox. He is seen playing chess with himself. But he also reserves the power to checkmate himself, as in the Bronson episode, thus hoping to defeat the mirror, to "vary the rules and play a different game" (Coda 2:586). The source of Lazarus' activity is the heart, and its place the body. Its thrust is not theoretical speculation but a physical compact with the self, which Heinlein oddly calls "morality." Snow tells Kelvin that morality is irrelevant to the speculative mind because his situation is beyond morality. The "Gray Voice" tells Lazarus: "Morals are your agreement with yourself to abide by your own rules" (p. 586). Within the extended body, this sort of moral onanism becomes the means of breaching that tyranny of past and mind which we call moral "conscience." To Lem, Lazarus's regeneration- by his own rules-would be a fantasy that sublimates the guilty conscience by symbolically sacrificing the self in order that, through its miraculous return, a new (if doubly illusory) sense of self may be reasserted. To Hein- lein, however, fantasy has become a physical process. The self is a hard structure, flesh which, if torn asunder by the conceits of time and love, can, because it remains flesh, perhaps be reformed by purely material means. To Lem, this kind of SF is simply to be dismissed as escapist. It repre- sents a retreat from epistemology into the gratifications of the body, a refuge in the fictions of morality on a basely egocentric level. But Lem seems to miss the point that escapism, in Heinlein at least, is made to serve as a means of epistemological inquiry. To Lazarus, the utopian present is frozen and eventless. Hence storyless. The way to re-energize it, then, is to re-nar- rativize it. And Lazarus does exactly that. He uses the device of telling tales of past adventures, not to escape the present, but to reactivate parallel situa- tions in that present. The goal is not contact but continuity, breakthrough into a future where there will be more time to love. An example is the tale of the "twins who weren't" (pp. 158-204). Laza- rus tells at great length of how he acted as geneticist-midwife to a pair of "diploid complement" siblings in love with each other. And the means of his midwifery is to tell stories within this story, seeking to prove to these twins, by narrated examples, that (paradoxically) they were the best possible mates after all. More importantly, Lazarus, through this act of narrating his way out of incest in the past, is moved to break free from the genetic impasse of his own present. In a world where all unions are now incest because everyone is a relative, he decides to clone "daughters." These are even more exact "twins," and certainly "daughters who aren't." But the trick here-literally enacting the scenario of the earlier tale-is to make them daughters who are. Again, Lazarus hopes to wear down the paradox by an act of staging. He will not directly inseminate any of the available biological mothers, for all are his relations. He can, however, place cloned cells in such a mother without the risk of incest. This he does, causing them</page><page sequence="15">STRUCTURES OF APPREHENSION 15 to be born, then raising them. In form, then, they become his "daughters." But because they know they are not such in substance, they claim free rein to attract and seduce him in turn. Fiction works to convert incest into onan- ism. But, more importantly, onanism again, as fantasy turned flesh, seems to promise a way out of the genetic trap. For in all these posturings, Laza- rus's sterile flesh is returned, if only in pro forma fashion, to the stream of genetic time, hence to its implied promise of continuation and growth. As projections of his narrative, the "daughters" in turn tell Lazarus stories he now must believe: they are not his daughters or sisters; because every gene in their bodies comes from him, they are him. To love them is safe, for it is masturbation, love of self. Yet at the same time, they have the form of non- self-the potentiality of becoming mistresses and perhaps, by some future twist of the helix, some day real mothers as well. Lazarus tells another story that generates empathic ties between past and future: that of Dora, his favorite "ephemeral" wife. Having died long ago, Dora seems for Lazarus what Rheya is for Kelvin: a memory hole. But Lazarus summons her into the present, not as an apparition, but as a story so vital that it moves the supercomputer Minerva physically to assume Dora's love for the teller. This leads Minerva not only to sacrifice machine eternity for (relatively) mortal flesh, but to take the fleshly form of Dora in doing so. In the iron dichotomy of mortality and immortality, fiction brings a softening-and with it more time for love, and perhaps even conception, ex nihilo, out of the sterile self. Lazarus hopes to defeat the past. But must not the future he desires eventually defeat his staged creations-and finally himself as well? For by trading time for love, Minerva has given her love over to time, to the irre- versible process of entropy. The protagonist of Heinlein's story "All You Zombies-" can be his own father and mother through time travel. But once created, cast in flesh, his mind-forms still become unalterable events in the stream of time: "a thing either is, or it isn't, now and forever amen" ("Zombies-" p. 343). There are "singularities" in the pragmatist's world too, and they mark the physical "life-line" that rules even in Lazarus's great sensorium. Lazarus has but one final gambit here: the hope of making time and love truly co-extensive by devising a future existence that is both sub- stantial and timeless. The trick is to invert narrative and real time, and by doing so divert the unalterable event out of the life-line into that of the story. Pre-World War I Missouri is Lazarus's real temporal origin. At the end of the novel he returns to this beginning, but now as a fictional charac- ter seeking to end his life. We learn of this event in an exact physical repro- duction, on the page, of the obituary column of a real contemporary newspaper. But physical death happens to a stand-in. As it does, Lazarus slips away from his pseudonym in dreams of flesh from coda back to da capo. The narrator of "All You Zombies-" says: "it is earlier when you think." Not "than" but "when." Time is not contrasted to love but incorpo-</page><page sequence="16">16 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 16 (1989) rated into it. "Thinking," then, has become a mode of digesting, and Hein- lein's world the beast, shouting love at its heart, that swallows its own tail. (To Lem, that world is "indigestible.") Quite literally "love conquers all." For Lazarus, it is later when we think as he reaches over death into the arms of a self that is as lovingly auto-constructed as the skeptic's self is analyzed out of existence. 4. Roadside Picnic is a work acutely aware of Lem and Anglo-American SF, hence of the skeptical and sentimental models. But their radical ideolo- gical claims simply coexist here, as if the characters were unable to con- clude and the authors unwilling to do so. Inconclusiveness marks every aspect of this novel. It marks protagonist Red Schuhart and the human con- dition he embodies, daring (as Gogol said) to see and not to comprehend. The fictional bedrock of the novel, its setting, is inconclusive (suppos- edly it is Canadian). As for the proper names, they represent a potpourri of nationalities: Pilman, Noonan, Burbidge, Panov, Schuhart. Nor does this international mixture seem to conceal a hidden agenda. Lem, in Solaris, offers a similar cast: Snow (in the original, Snaut, a name of elusive and clearly "foreign"-i.e., non-Polish-nationality), Kelvin, Sartorius. With these names Lem is, on the one hand, denationalizing science, perhaps in order to elevate it to a level of "pure" cognition; but on the other hand, he is using the names to cast an ironic shadow on science's pretension to such status. Kelvin's aspirations (as has been noticed) bear the mark of his famous, and erroneous, namesake. And Sartorius's theories are, as his name suggests, fashionable and superficial. Did we not know Snow's "real" name is Snaut, we would be tempted to see another such ironic naming, for his theories are icily futile. Perhaps this correspondence led the English trans- lators to alter Snaut-used in the French text they worked from-to Snow. Heinlein is also fond of presenting a multi-national, multi-racial future. Yet his tactic is not irony-here involving the separation of thought and deed-but its sentimental opposite: elision. Potentially destructive social tensions are simply "rubbed away" as they are passed over in silence, and the complexities of social evolution replaced with the homogeneity of a "world body." The Strugatskys' world, however, is a genuine mongrel, a mixture that, defying all patterns and intentions, seems merely to exist. Pro- per names are never clearly representative or satirical. Nor are they count- ers in an overt, or even oblique, political allegory. On the contrary, even the occasional Russian name-or attitude, for that matter, recognizably taken from contemporary Soviet society-occurs in such a random fashion that, by raising sporadic expectations of hidden "meaning," it only reinforces the text's general sense of inconclusiveness. The novel's temporal structure is also vague. The "visitation," by its very name, should be a precise event, the sort we begin new calendars by. Yet we have no idea when it occurred. Nor did its occurrence impart clear temporal direction to the narrative. It is said to generate a new world. At the</page><page sequence="17">STRUCTURES OF APPREHENSION 17 same time, it has revived the old, ancestral world. Its impact, in fact, is Janus-faced, yielding objects that at once gesture towards the future and the past. The "zone" gives self-recharging batteries and perpetual-motion machines; and it yields "zombies," bodies of dead ancestors rising up to restore family lines in the flesh. Seeking to understand this visitation, humans have overturned tradition and simultaneously reawakened it. Scien- tists and technicians adapt the objects to revolutionary ends. But the "stalk- ers," inversely, move back into the realm of myth, of folk nomenclature. What one calls "colloidal gas," the other calls "witches' jelly." The same ambivalence, finally, marks the ideological landscape of Picnic. The text-everywhere-echoes Western models of cognition and order. As Lem sees it in his essay "About the Strugatskys' Roadside Pic- nic," the initial problem is that of Solaris: not sentimental fantasy in the Wells tradition but genuine alien encounter, a meeting that obliges human- kind to reflect on "the fate of reason in the cosmos." Like Solaris, the Zone is a place of otherness, explored and speculated on, but ultimately not understood. Both works enact what Lem calls "an incomprehensible infringement on causal connections" as we understand them (see "About ...Picnic," p. 254). There is a difference, however; and this may explain both Lem's focus on Picnic as vehicle for epistemological speculation and his quarrel with important aspects of that speculation. In Picnic the alien seems to come simultaneously from outside-it "visits" humankind-and inside, as if it were a natural outgrowth of human institutions and society. The text may have a Lem-like problem, but this ambivalence gives it a very different epistemological "feel." One reason for this difference is the use, as vector, of a generic form quite different from Lem's. For Solaris the vector is the space adventure. And its treatment is ironic. To Lem, the "space epic" is sentimental because its method of cognition is, literally, a "growing edge," where the "frontiers" of knowled- ge are physically annexed by acts of exploration. Arriving on Solaris, Kel- vin seems to have such a "heroic" trajectory. Yet the path he takes, from the moment of arrival, is one of increasing inaction and isolation: from his fellow men, from nature, and finally from himself. If Kelvin earns the right to represent the human community in the face of the unknown, it is by the inability to act. His is the journey of Kierkegaard's Knight of Faith: to metaphysical despair. With the term "knight," Kierkegaard keeps the sub- text of the epic form his irony subverts. In Solaris, whose protagonists Snow calls Knights of the Holy Contact, Lem does the same. He builds his epistemological case throughout by confronting a "naive" fictional form with the complexities of cognition: How can we act "heroically" if we do not know what we are doing? Moreover, Lem strengthens his case by let- ting the heroic tone of his subverted vehicle flow through the work, if only subliminally. And by its tenacity this tone imparts an "epic" feel to the very irony that constantly undercuts epic pretensions.</page><page sequence="18">18 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 16 (1989) In like manner, the Strugatskys have an identifiable "naive" form as their subtext. But their model is quite different. It is (what Lem's compari- son to The War of the Worlds correctly identifies it as) the alien invasion or "it came from outer space" tale. This, in a sense, is the "tragic" obverse of the popular space epic. Thebes, after all, is visited by a plague that brings designated humans to investigate causes that are never fully explicated- causes that seem to lie, finally, not in cosmic mystery or human ignorance, but in some muddled relation between the two. The fictions of the senti- mentalist and of the skeptic are alike in that they are epic or mock-epic in nature. Their primary vectors, at least, are expansive: something, either mind or body, is initially asked to reach out and engage. But the Strugat- skys' "visitation" strikes an ordinary, unspecific community, forcing it less to act than to react, defensively and unsystematically. That community contains skeptics as well as sentimentalists. But these "epic" ideologies are held by the larger "tragic" frame. And in this frame of reaction they become complementary responses, part of a tougher bedrock, which is the capacity of a more general humankind both to endure and to exploit and profit from a situation it does not comprehend. This is a world where seekers learn to co-exist with "stalkers." Picnic offers a figure seemingly out of Lem: the Nobel prize-winning scientist Vladimir Pilman. The better part of a chapter is devoted to his hypotheses. Yet the tone and manner of his pronouncements are signifi- cantly different from those of a Snow or even of a Kelvin. He comes across less as rigorous thinker than as cafe raconteur, given to the amiable reeling off of "theories" that seem little more than tongue-in-cheek versions of explanations already familiar to readers of SF invasion tales. He is, in other words, less a skeptic than a cynic. His description of the "Pilman radiant" is an example. The Martians in The War of the Worlds invade by ostensibly shooting a "space gun" at Earth. The "radiant" appears no more than a whimsical extension of this scenario: The whole point of what you call my first serious discovery lies in the simple fact that all six Visitation Zones are situated on the surface of our planet as though someone had taken six shots at Earth from a pistol located somewhere along the Earth-Deneb line. (0:4) All Pilman's hypotheses are uttered in the same flippant manner, as if to placate the mood of the moment or the whims of the interlocutor. Pilman may, on one level, parody Lem's speculators. There is, however, an important difference. He cannot be judged by the skeptic's category of sanity or insanity (that is, believing descriptions to be somehow "true") because he never commits himself to, or takes responsibility for, his ideas. What characterizes his remarks is a persistent will to remove all trace of active agency from them, to make them seem self-generating, unattached phenomena. Even though the "radiant" bears his name, he claims he did not discover it: "According to some sources, the Pilman Radiant was discovered</page><page sequence="19">STRUCTURES OF APPREHENSION 19 by a schoolboy. Unfortunately, I don't remember his name. Look it up in Stetson's History of the Visitation" (0:3). Nor does Pilman approve the popular names for things and occurrences in the Zone, for these imply agency, hence carry with them the possibility of responsibility and blame. The zombies, for instance, he renames "moulages." The apparently more "objective" term, however, is actually an elaborate dodge that implies a deeply unspeculative attitude. These beings may have been "molded," but who did the molding? (Solaris has similar "moulages," but in that novel they generate endless, guilt-driven speculation as to their origin.) Pilman will not even admit the term "stalker" or the idea of human agency it strongly conveys. Instead he says: "there is a steady leak of materials from the Visitation Zone into the hands of irresponsible persons and organiza- tions" (0:6). This persistent need to deny agency (cognitive or otherwise) is noticed, however, and incurs judgment: "But I would be interested in knowing [his interviewer asks] just what does fall within your competence, Dr Pilman?" (0:6). For Lem, that question would be one of cognitive capacity. Here it is one of competency and responsibility. Pilman's major speculation-whose counterpart in the Solaris tradition is supposed to measure the reach of humankind's cognitive agency in the face of the inscrutable universe-is the "roadside picnic" hypothesis. But this is not only an anthropomorphic vision, it is an irresponsible one as well. The agency implied in the image of the alien picnickers is, in a sense, the magnified mirror of Pilman's care- less abdication of active, responsible agency in his own speculating: it is theoretical littering. A responsible hypothesis for Lem must never lay blame. Kelvin's fmal hypothesis speaks, for instance, of an "imperfect god," but one whose imperfection does not necessarily raise the "Manichaan question" (see Sola- ris 14:204ff.). Perfection is a logical category, and a logically superior being would seek to communicate with us, not harm us. To say a god is imperfect is not to evoke evil, but contingency, "accident." Any harm that ensues is unintentional, merely the product of some naturally flawed pro- cess of communication. The responsibility of the speculative mind is a logi- cal responsibility, which demands we carry thought to its rational limits. In the case of the alien, this means-ultimately-that we cannot have a moral "handle" on it. We must assume that like us (howsoever limited or flawed) it remains logically consistent unto itself. A tautology that mirrors our cognitive solipsism, the logically alien is a sign of the moral neutrality of the cosmos. To describe alien entities, Lem's characters frequently use domestic metaphors: Snow's "child-god," the "soup" in The Investigation. The road- side picnic metaphor, then, may be a conscious attempt on the Strugatskys' part to incriminate Lem's apparent speculative neutrality. Lem does not want us to care who made the cosmic soup or why. This figure is merely</page><page sequence="20">20 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 16 (1989) the skeptic's mirror, which presents, in paradoxical fashion, his cognitive limits in an everyday form. It familiarizes rather than estranges, renders the alien a domestic thing, one to which the speculator is unlikely to have moral objections. The roadside picnic is a different matter. We do care who had it, for that act embodies something reprehensible that lies at the heart of this too-comfortable domesticity. If the perpetrators are gods, then they remain as morally careless as their spokesman Pilman. His hypothesis marks the outer speculative limits of the Strugatskys' theoretical man, and hence mirrors the habits of the human world that formulates it. But the mir- ror here is a moral as well as a cognitive one-the dark glass of human sel- fishness that opposes the novel's crystal clear "golden ball"-and at the same time complements it. For if humans and gods are alike in making messes, do not both (according to the complementary logic of morality) have the responsibility to clean them up again? The skeptic seems not to believe in paradigm shifts or "scientific revo- lutions." Hence an alien encounter as the occasion for such a shift is one which the skeptic does not take. Held back by a past of failed "break- throughs," he or she erects these into a principle of inherent limitation. This is what Pilman in effect does when he tells us that the alien encounter can never be more than a "vicious circle" because "[h]umanity as a whole is too fixed a system, there's no changing it" (3:104). Pilman does not despair of such limits. Rather, with this banal turn of phrase he abandons an enterprise he apparently thinks is futile. The Kierkegaardian anguish of Lem's Knights of Holy Contact has become, in Pilman, pedantic complacency. Meanwhile, the technological establishment, represented by his interlo- cutor, engineer Richard Noonan, has already begun to exploit the unknow- ables of the Zone in ways that are changing the human system. This suggests an opposition between skeptic and pragmatist. And yet, when Noonan speaks, his remarks seem to echo, on a register that is complemen- tary rather than antithetical, those of Pilman. Compare with Pilman's on humanity as a "fixed system" this statement of Noonan's: "It's just that that's the way the world is. And that's the way man is in this world. If there had never been the Visitation, there would have been something else. Pigs always find mud" (3:103). We observe something similar in Noonan's contrast between the pragmatist's reaction to the alien and the skeptic's. This, it seems, is merely another "vicious circle," the cognitive dilemma reduced to tautology: "We don't understand a thing, and they understand how much they don't" (3:115). There are echoes of Pascal's opposition of thinking reed and universe. But whereas that opposition was irreconcilable, here it is made into a complementarity, like two sides of a same coin. "[I]t should never be forgotten that in our Euclidian world every stick has two ends," Pilman tells us (3:111). Nor should it be forgotten that he would apply this stick to the distinctly non-Euclidian world of the Zone. And yet, at the two ends of this stick in the Strugatskys, we find antithetical</page><page sequence="21">STRUCTURES OF APPREHENSION 21 opposites that are at the same time complementary systems. Many of the definitions Pilman throws off are of this variety: xenology is a combination of reason and fantasy; reason itself is both logic and "a complex type of instinct"; "The hypothesis of God...gives an incomparably absolute oppor- tunity to understand everything and know absolutely nothing" (3:106). Instead of conceit, Pilman gives us mixed metaphor. And instead of cogni- tive paradox, we have hybrids: "I am positive that in the vast majority of cases we are hammering nails with microscopes" (3:111). This is a scien- tist's statement of cognitive method. And it is one that strangely enough seems to work in the wild grotesqueries of this world where opposites no longer repel each other but seem to adhere in complementary fashion. At the other end of the stick from Pilman we find the "stalkers." For them, to know is physically to winnow the Zone, in an attempt to make a living out of its "mud." Indeed, the stalker-protagonist, Red Schuhart, shows a great deal of concern with knowing, both in his words and by his actions. His methods, at first glance, bear some resemblance to Heinleinian sentimentality. "What was 'thinking' anyway?" Red asks. "Thinking meant finding a loophole, pulling a bluff, pulling the wool over someone's eyes" (4:151). Red's mode of thinking seems close here to Lazarus Long's. Yet, as we have seen, Lazarus's bluffs, his onanistic stagings, pull the wool, ulti- mately, over his own eyes. The "loopholes" he explores, as ways out of the time trap, are actually internal loopings, aimed at incorporating the outer world into a "self' conceived as a sort of sensory feedback system. Red's loopholes, on the contrary, are literal ways in and out of the Zone, and consequently in and out of the social system that surrounds and interacts with it. They are active means of interconnecting two opposite yet inversely proportional worlds. Red sees a "loophole" that seems to be, in sentimental fashion, a door into some future summer: 'You're absolutely right. Our little town is a hole....But now it is a hole into the future. We're going to dump so much through this hole into your lousy world that everything will change in it. Life will be different....Every- one will have everything that he needs. Some hole, huh? Knowledge comes though this hole. And when we have the knowledge, we'll make everyone rich, and we'll fly to the stars, and go anywhere we want.' (1:37) In Heinlein, this process is a closed loop, one clearly contained in the "sen- sorium" of self. In "By His Bootstraps" (1941), for example, Bob Wilson sits at his desk writing a thesis on the relation between the conceivable and the possible in phenomena like time travel. As he takes up the latter topic, a hole opens in the wall and he is drawn into an apparently utopian world where he sees a "great future" for himself. He learns instead, as he loops back and forth between worlds, that all the humans involved in this drama are time "manifestations" of himself, and that all the future he has is a closed structure, fixed by the moment when his desire to escape tyrannies</page><page sequence="22">22 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 16 (1989) in this life coincides with the appearance of a "time gate." Red, however, is speaking of a real "we"-a group of stalkers if not a community. And he personally will not escape through this hole to the stars. Rather, he goes into the Zone and encounters the Golden Ball. The Golden Ball, as instrument of wish-fulfillment, could be the per- fect sentimental device, the means of projecting the sensorium into the future or "anywhere we want." But it is also an optical device, and as such analogous to Pilman's microscope. For just as Pilman can envision hammering nails with his instrument, so Red promises to hammer our "lousy world" with his even more delicate glass. The suggested extremes of skeptic and sentimentalist find their common denominator here in a prag- matic activity of knowing which involves placing unlikely opposites in combinations that are grotesque and yet somehow complementary. Ball, Zone, town: holes within holes. And what is dumped through them goes-simultaneously-into the future and the past. Any attempt to use these devices to spread the sensorial body encounters an equal and opposite current in Picnic-a pervasive devolution of that body. "Buzzard" Burbidge, for instance, wishes on the Golden Ball for perfect offspring, and his wish seems granted in the form of Dina and Arthur. But where Lazarus's clones provided neat loops in the genetico-evolutionary trap, daughter Dina acknowledges no genetic bonds whatsoever. Hers is at once a perfect human body and an artifact as alien as any the Zone produces. Son Arthur at first seems different. When he goes into the Zone to wish upon the Ball for the restoration of his father's legs, we are tantalized by the possibility of a Heinleinian gambit: here the wishing into existence of an impossible off- spring who then acts to restore, in the real world, something time and entro- py have irrevocably taken. Once in the Zone, however, Arthur throws away his life and Buzzard's hope for legs by uttering utopian wishes. Likewise, but in opposite fashion, emigres from the Zone spread random disorder in inverse proportion to the distance they travel. Then, too, the stalkers take objects out of the Zone into our technological future, but their surnames- "Buzzard," "Hamster"-testify to the devolutionary direction their bodies have taken. Finally, Red's daughter "Monkey" devolves chapter by chapter from autistic girl into the hairy creature whose name she bears. In response to the facts of the Zone, Picnic offers the possibility of epistemological extremes. But it is visibly not concerned with pursuing either one with rigor. Nor with parodying one in order to promote the other. They are simply two ends of a stick in a novel that is more interested in the epistemological nature of the space that connects them-in the medium less as message than as the means of knowing. In terms of both plot and charac- ter distribution, this middle ground is represented by engineer Noonan. In the middle chapter of what is in effect a five-chapter book (counting the unnumbered unit called "Introduction"), Noonan acts as physical liaison between "world-views" that otherwise would never touch. He is listening to</page><page sequence="23">STRUCTURES OF APPREHENSION 23 Pilman's theories at the beginning of the chapter; at the end, he is sitting in Red's apartment. As technocrat, he connects lone skeptic and sentimental individualist by representing the forces-socio-economic forces-that give existence to their methods of knowing by using them. Noonan provides the impure medium in which both must work, and ensures by his presence that neither extreme can be pure. The Strugatskys are subtle in their treatment of epistemological extremity. So subtle in fact that Lem, in his essay on Picnic, does not see them playing extremes against a middle realm of complementarity. Instead, he demands that they be more rigorously pure. The roadside picnic hypo- thesis, he deems, is an inadequate interpretation of the facts given. More stringent "scientific" analysis of the Visitation yields the following conclu- sions: the objects found in the Zone are "functionable"; they are "commen- surate in size" with the human body; they are often dangerous for humans; but, because they are scattered at random around the Zone, they do not seem intentionally dangerous. From what Lem calls the Zone's "resurrec- tion effect," its propensity to imitate the human form by means of "mou- lages," he deduces that the visitors knew something about us in advance of their coming. And because the objects they left are on a human scale, he concludes they were sending us something: a "gift." A gift, by definition, is not something harmful. It becomes harmful only as a result of accidental "damage." There is no "fault"; simply a breakdown in the process of trans- mission. This reasoning is elegant (see Microworlds, pp. 265-68). But a novel is not a field of scientific data. By rewriting Picnic, Lem is rejecting the "science fantasy" combina- tion as an impossible contradiction. A choice must be made between these two terms, and he chooses "science" as necessary determinant: "The sci- ence-fiction world must be...a real world: that is, one in which no one is privileged from the start, in which no fate is predetermined, whether in favor of good or of evil" ("About...Picnic," p. 250). The accident hypothe- sis then, by substituting an impartial (i.e., "real") world for one limited by an implicit moral bias, is meant to convert the Strugatskys' science-fantasy into true SF. By ignoring the facts in the case, the Strugatskys have made an "error" : [T]heir error lies in just this silence about the possibility of an accident. We understand quite well why they chose this course.. .both sides were meant to be discredited. Men agree on using the gift only in base and self- destructive ways because that is human nature; and the Senders prove their murderous indifference to humanity because beings of high intelligence do not give a damn about their intellectual inferiors. (Ibid., pp. 273-74) Instead of examining the nature of the message, we should consider the medium of its transmission, Lem tells us. He will not accept "Human nature," either as medium or as valid epistemological concept, for that can only entail our projecting of moral categories onto a neutral universe.</page><page sequence="24">24 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 16 (1989) In the Strugatskys' universe, however, humankind and nature are not separated in this Cartesian manner, any more than medium and message are. The moral muddle is the medium in which their characters operate, their only way to knowledge. Both skepticism and sentimentality desire to be morally neutral postures to the degree they seek totalities of either mind or body. But, as we have seen, no one in Picnic can assume such postures. All are taken, in the things they say or do, by what Lem calls the "Mani- chean problem." There is no stepping beyond good and evil, for these, as equal and opposite forces, contain the entire universe, human and non- human "nature" alike. Lem inveighs against another fantasy element in the novel, the Golden Ball. He sees here more than a logical fallacy. It is a genuine religious ele- ment, and as such an actively irrational presence. Acting as does Pascal's shift of "orders," the Ball offers a movement from reason to faith which breaks the SF genre in two. Lem concludes: "It is not an exaggeration for me to say that the difficulties of a fantasy writer who sides with science are generally greater than those of a theologian who acknowledges the perfec- tion of God" ("About...Picnic," p. 278). In the skeptic's eyes, perfection can never be the domain of science, for science is experimental, and the human perceptual apparatus that conducts experiments is limited by its own nature. The presence of the Ball accord- ingly inverts Picnic's generic direction. This is not the case of an SF writer "siding" with fantasy so much as one of a fantasy writer seeking in vain to deal with the question of scientific inquiry. "Fantasy writer" and "theolo- gian" are analogous categories; and because both are such (for necessarily abandoning reason), neither can offer the epistemological structure Lem reserves for science fiction. By conflating sentimentality and fantasy, and then subsuming these to religion, Lem hopes to deny the epistemological validity of a whole class of SF. Picnic, failing the promise of its rational givens, falls finally into that class. But in thus dismissing the Ball as a sentimental device, Lem mistakes the Strugatskys' use of it. "Transporter" objects in Anglo-American SF have various forms-from time machines and Heinlein's cryogenic "long sleep" to a vast array of jewels and crystals that give the contemplator access to some other or better or even "magic" kingdom. And the Strugat- skys' choice of a ball is a particularly flagrant bow to the fantasy (or magic kingdom) end of this spectrum. But what does their Ball do? On the one hand, with Dina and Arthur, it produces simulacra from the deep desires of the gazer-much as Rheya (but without the mediation of such a device) is produced. On the other, it is the receptacle of broad, eudaemonic wishes for "happiness for all." The word that describes such a wish is not fantasy or its transcendent counterpart, religion. It is utopia. Utopia, in the common sense of the word, is a skeptic's paradox. The moral quality of the good place it seems to offer is immediately dissolved</page><page sequence="25">STRUCTURES OF APPREHENSION 25 by the discovery-an epistemological one-that such is to be found no place. The Strugatskys, however, are seeking to bring this paradox more in line with their "Manichaean" complementarity-the equal and opposite combination of good place and evil place. They do not need to import a sentimental model here. They have one at home: in Efremov. Once we get behind its progressive, "collective" facade, the Efremov model is just as much a sentimental projection of the great sensorium as is Lazarus's utopia of time and love. For by postulating that human reason is the highest form of sentient existence attainable in the cosmos, Efremov is simply projecting the human form onto all future alien encounters, real and virtual.7 In Picnic, however, the utopian wish proves a radically unstable means of projecting the human form. Arthur rushes towards the Ball shouting for universal happiness and hits a "transparent emptiness" that tears his body limb from limb. The last words of the novel are Red's, and they are the same: happiness for all. But just before uttering them, he had more or less knowingly sent Arthur to his death to clear his own way to the Golden Ball. It is the utopian genre here that is dismembered. Red's wish is perhaps out of character. But is it wholly without consequence? The novel ends on a non sequitur, and on a utopian note. Red's words fall into what might be called a "transparent emptiness," or "full void." Something like a geometry of catastrophic reversal transforms the utopian conceit, and the unstable linkings of the skeptical or sentimental paradox (depending in this case whether we come down on the side of "no place" or "good place") are made to yield stable figures, yin/yang structures that combine terms on what are complementary levels of opposition. In the "transparent empti- ness" is figured the confrontation of epistemology as human desire to know nature, to make it "transparent," with that perversity in nature which humankind, finally and illogically, describes in moral terms as the full emptiness of evil. Catastrophic encounter with the full empty happens to utopians and men of science alike in this novel. And as Red describes the death of Kirill Panov in the Zone, both-sentimentalist and skeptic-enter a complementary relationship: "He struggled to remember Kirill, the saint- ed man, his swift, sure movements, his laugh, his voice, which promised unheard-of marvelous places and times, and Kirill appeared; but then a sil- ver cobweb exploded on the sun and Kirill was no more" (4:147-48). The Strugatskys preface their novel with a quotation attributed to Robert Penn Warren: "You have to make the good out of the bad because that is all you have got to make it out of." To Lem, such a statement could be no more than a tautology (the fact that a concept like "good" presumes its opposite teaches us nothing about the nature of humanity or universe). The skeptic would "translate" this into what he believes are epistemological terms: "bad" means "comprised of unknowable natural phenomena"; "good" means "subjecting these phenomena to our control through know- ledge." Heinlein, on the other hand, would not discriminate but conflate.</page><page sequence="26">26 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 16 (1989) Lem's knowable and unknowable are overlaid with a good and bad that are physical, not logical, categories. And "morality" becomes a co-opting of material evolution by grace. Defying Lem's statement that no fate be prede- termined, Lazarus (whose name means "God has helped") benefits from a material form of predestination. He inexplicably survives a "bad" gene pool-an act of physical "grace" that allows him eventually to efface the bad by extending his "good" body over the universe. The Penn Warren epi- graph is an imperative: humankind must seek the "good," and because that good depends on something unknown, the alien Zone, this search becomes an epistemological one. But for the Strugatskys' characters "good" is nei- ther knowledge nor grace in the extreme senses of Lem or Heinlein. These the Zone offers and denies in the same breath. But the real question is what the "bad" is. The skeptic would say there is simply muddle-some noise inherent in the medium of investigation. But to the pragmatist Noonan the human muddle is not morally neutral; instead it is an ignorance marked by a willful perversity: "He knew that millions upon millions of people knew nothing and wanted to know nothing, and even if they found out would ooh and aah for five minutes and then go back to their own routines" (3:124). Were Heinlein to use the term human nature, the accent would fall on "nature," by which he means (in an almost Calvinist sense) those laws of providence that remain impervious to humanity's moral imperatives. In his world, it is a question of wheat and chaff, the elect and the fallen, those who act in knowledge and those hopelessly in the dark. In contrast, Noonan is not describing the extremes so much as the stick itself. As median, the human stick is necessarily a compound of whatever terms mark its ends. The bedrock, as Noonan says, is both inattention and indirection. But, unlike Heinleinian predestination, this indirection at least allows humankind to dream of direction, to have what are (in the shadow of skepticism and senti- mentality alike) absurdly moral dreams, like Red's utopian wish. Along the length of the human stick, the problem becomes one of making knowledge out of ignorance, order out of disorder, good out of bad. The Strugatskys, then, offer an absurdly moral mode of inquiry-an epistemological morality-that subsumes the workings of antithetical sys- tems like skepticism and sentimentality. Their mode is less interested in the end of the road, the limits, than in the road itself, in the means of getting around in a world troubled by the emergence of "zones," places where the familiar world responds to our inquiries by becoming correspondingly strange. The road metaphor is not gratuitous. In an early novel, Hard to Be a God (1964), the Strugatskys raise the question of the "anisotropic road." By definition, this is a road that does not have the same properties in all direc- tions. In each direction the road is different. But is this the same as saying it is a one-way road? Such thinking leads to Pashka's final, and extreme, equation of the road and history: "Nowadays I often think back to that</page><page sequence="27">STRUCTURES OF APPREHENSION 27 road....Maybe there's some connection somewhere...the road was aniso- tropic-just as history is. There is no way back. And he went right ahead anyway. And met up with a chained skeleton" (10:204). The problem (and it is one specific to Hard to Be) is that history is not merely a physical process-analogous to the properties of the road-but a matter of human interaction with those properties. Hence Anton's choice to go back down the road. The Strugatskys suggest that there are two ways to travel in reverse: as a god and (like Anton) as a human being. The group Anton works for are cosmic social "scientists." They have discovered, on the planet Arkanar, a human society that has reached the social equivalent of our Middle Ages. Using what they know of our historical development, they seek to guide this society peacefully around pitfalls into an age of socialism. Arkanar, then, is no alien Solaris. Nor should it be for the Efre- movian historian, who believes not only that all roads go in the same direc- tion but that he has been down the road before. But, in a sense, Anton cannot touch his world any more than Kelvin can touch Solaris. And this is his paradox. For if Arkanar is a human road, then Anton must touch it if he is to follow it. But touching is a clear violation of the epistemological credo these scientists operate under: observe and manipulate, but remain invis- ible, make no physical or emotional contact. The Strugatskys' irony is to take Efremov literally. The men and women of Arkanar are not psychic simulacra like the figures encountered on Solaris. They are material facts, flesh and blood humans going down a human road. To take their road is to become mired in mud again-their mud, our mud; the situation is always the same, always human, and because of that always different, always demanding a new and total commitment. The whole interplanetary, altemate world apparatus simply falls away; and as in Roadside Picnic, the alien encounter becomes a human encounter, the strange familiar and the famil- iar suddenly strange. Most SF roads to contact, even those ironically conceived in Lem, are anisotropic in Pashka's sense. If a protagonist actually travels to a past or parallel world, he cannot engage that world unless he leaves this one behind completely. However grotesque Kelvin's question, "Must I go on living here then, among the objects we both had touched, in the air she breathed?" (14:211), he cannot go home again, and will remain on Solaris. Lazarus, if from the opposite pole, is oddly in the same situation. For in order to embrace the world of his time travels, he would have to abolish his previous existence completely. Theoretically he could do this by creating himself. Instead he plays games with his alternate world, simulating engagement but remaining all the while a detached observer. In this light, Anton's situation is unique. For he is made to live two worlds. And to open roads, to make order out of this muddle. Hard to Be asks Anton, in getting involved with Arkanar, to establish physical and emotional connections between what, in SF, normally remains shadow play between humankind</page><page sequence="28">28 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 16 (1989) and its epistemological phantoms. It is from this depth of commitment that he is brought back in extremis to this world (like Lazarus "saved" by his time-travelling colleagues). The sense of anisotropic broadens here; for the road has radically different, "historically" incompatible, properties in each direction. But in both cases it is the same road, that of humanity: irrever- sible and yet reversible, always different but always the same. Kelvin would be suspended on, and Lazarus physically torn apart by, such a conceit. Anton, because he physically occupies both worlds, renders them complements of each other. In doing so, he makes us ponder in what sense a road (or stick) with ends in non-communicating universes can be said to connect. But how can such a stick (or road) be said to have direction, in the sense of a right way and a wrong way? At one end there is scientific social- ism, at the other the chained machine-gunner. But that scientific society is already present in the Prologue: three young people, Anton among them, go on a playful outing in an Earth forest. The world they are "practicing" for, medieval Arkanar, seen from here is a step backward. Arkanar's end point is the unregenerate Don Reba. But in the Earth forest, the beginning of the one-way road is the machine gunner. The three come across the Forgotten Road, which is also a forbidden road: "A traffic sign....Do Not Enter" (0: 15). Discovering tracks of a car that has entered this road the wrong way, Anton and friend Pashka defy the sign and come across the chained skeleton at road's end. The uniform is German; and the gun has half sunk into the mud of the road, as was the car Pashka apparently repairs. The skeleton, on the one hand, marks a starting point-the road moving from chained men in Plato's cave, through fascist slavery, to the "new men" in the forest. But such enlightenment, on the other hand, only frees new humanity to challenge direction anew: Why have a road at all, Anka asks, if you cannot enter it from either end? On this road, theory and practice, knowledge and morality, inextricably interpenetrate. The Earth forest is a training area for future operations on Arkanar. But its past is the German skeleton. An unregenerate beginning to match Don Reba's end. We have two ends of a same stick, in different worlds. And both are apparently evil. How, then, can we implement Penn Warren's imperative and make good out of the bad? The problem deflects us from inherent properties of worlds to connections between them: here chains and bridge, that which both enslaves and binds, permits and prevents passage-inextricable tangles of good and evil which (however), by virtue of this, offer the possi- bility of untangling, of bringing one out of the other, good out of evil. Going down the road the wrong way, the boys also find a collapsed bridge. The thrust of both Lem's and Heinlein's epistemology is to cut the "bridge" between human morality and physical process. To Lem, morality is an anthropomorphic projection that fails absolutely. To Heinlein, it is one that succeeds absolutely: "Racial survival," Lazarus tells us, "is the only</page><page sequence="29">STRUCTURES OF APPREHENSION 29 universal morality" (Time Enough, pp. 242-43). But by going back the wrong way, across the bridge, the boys restore a path between "history" and natural process. Lem stops at "communication," and Heinlein at physi- cal connection-"survival." What the Strugatskys give us instead is partici- pation, the process of making the reversals that allow humanity's moral needs to interact with nature, for better and for worse. Such a participatory act is Anton's playing William Tell. In the original Tell story, a bridge is crossed, and the physical shooting of an apple off a loved one's head is infused with moral consequences: the freedom of a people from the same chains that hold the machine gunner. Here, in this playacting, only the pos- sibility of a bridge is raised. But that is enough to trigger the process of complementarity, where one bridge collapses-Anton fears for his friend and fires wide of the mark-and another is built. For might not the bolt fired on Earth be the one that strikes his beloved on Arkanar? A genuinely human nature, in the complementary sense, arises as good and evil find their Manichaan balance. The Strugatskys offer a profound insight here. Anton's actions show us that the properties of roads, of history and epistemology, are anisotropic in both the physical and the moral sense: that they are at every step an inter- twining of equal and opposite directions. Anton, as if sensing that "wrong ways" of classical history and epistemology are a question not of roads but of the signs we place on them, decides to play Tell in a different area. Defying the sign on the Forbidden Road, he seeks to shoot it down. But again misses. Does this mean (as the action on Arkanar seems to say) that, instead of bringing good out of bad, humankind is somehow fated to do the opposite-to bring bad out of good? Yet a Strugatsky road-the one Anton follows to the skeleton and to Arkanar-is like a Maebius band. For in the Epilogue we see him coming back the down road, and the blood on his hands from one world has become, in this twist, the innocent juice of straw- berries in another. The sign that both Lem and Heinlein ultimately place on their epistem- ological roads is "objectivity," a sign meant to exclude morality from parti- cipating in the process of knowledge. But "subjectivity" of the latter kind is again becoming a valid category to science. Here is physicist John Wheeler: May the universe in some strange sense be 'brought into being' by the par- ticipation of those who participate?...[T]he vital act is the act of participa- tion .... It strikes down the term 'observer' of classical theory, the man who stands safely behind the thick glass wall and watches what goes on without taking part. (p. 1273) This is a step back, but it does not go nearly as far as the Strugatskys, who take us back to that important crux in scientific epistemology which is the split between Descartes and Pascal. The Cartesian apparatus works by dividing wholes into halves, making these terms into functional opposites by simplifying them, purifying each of all trace of the other. Thus nature, as</page><page sequence="30">30 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 16 (1989) Alfred North Whitehead sees it (p. 118), is reduced to mere physical pro- cess, "to the notion of correlated motions with mere spatio-temporal char- acter." Pascal, however, will not accept this one-way road of observation, or of manipulation, with humans "safely" behind the glass wall of the cogi- to: "Who will unravel this tangle? Nature confutes the skeptics and reason confutes the dogmatists" (Pascal: 120). On one side is excess of reason, on the other excess of feeling. But in both cases epistemology seeks to exclude morality. For Pascal this is not possible: for besides knowing the universe, "one must know oneself. If this does not serve to discover truth, it at least serves as a rule of life" (Pascal: 15). Red Schuhart tells us he does not know anything, and could not express it if he did: "I don't have the words, they didn't teach me the words" (4: 153). Yet it is because of this confusion that he understands that knowledge or its lack is not enough. He needs a "rule of life" as well, in order to parti- cipate, to know his role in a world that will not teach him. For Lem and Heinlein alike, humankind ultimately has a place in the universe, not (in this Pascalian sense) a role. Red, however, cannot be fixed. He is Pascal's moving point, the functioning focus of every otherwise incomprehensible opposition in Picnic. He sees himself as wholly unique ("I've never sold my soul to anyone") and as an everyman. One moment he is the savage sur- vivalist, whose self-reliance is measured in the "amount of money he could snatch, grab, or bite away from the indifferent chaos" (4:132). The next he is the selfless idealist wishing "happiness for all." He is constantly seeking to define himself in relation to the universe. And at each instant that univer- se changes under his perception. In the Zone he sees two radically different balls. One is golden, and floats and dances in the air. The other is heavy: "It had not been carefully placed there, it had been left behind, littering up the Zone like all the empties...and other rubbish remaining after the Visitation" (4:150). The two balls are products of two different, and non-integrated, moments of experience by a single consciousness. They are complementary in the epistemological sense, products of a mode of knowledge in which, as Gary Zukav puts it, "our eyes are ignorant of the fact that what they see is 'impossible"' (p. 284). But this "ignorance" is also, in Red's case, a moral act, a rule of life that allows him to experience complementarity, not just perceive it-to step out from behind the glass wall and into a perceptual present where he operates as a sum without a cogito: "I was born. So here I am. People eat what they can. Let all of us be healthy and let all of us drop dead. Who is us and who is they? I don't understand a thing" (4:152). Existing in this constant (and precarious) state of creative disorder, Red would seem to obey laws and processes other than human. Apropos here is John Von Neumann's description of a quantum phenomenon, in which the word "animal" is used in a purposely metaphorical manner: This strange animal constantly would change with the passage of time. Each moment it would be different than the moment before. It would be a</page><page sequence="31">STRUCTURES OF APPREHENSION 31 composite of all the possibilities of the observed system which it describes. It would not be a simple mixture of possibilities, it would be a sort of orga- nic whole whose parts are changing constantly but which, nonetheless, is somehow a thing-in-itself. (Cited in Zukav: 272-73) We sense, in this description, a (nicely contained) desire to move back from a purely material universe to one of "organic wholes" and "things-in-them- selves," in the latter case toward entities of a moral as well as physical existence. The Strugatskys, with Red, make clear passage between these universes. He is Stochastic Man and also Traditional Russian Man, that comprehensibly incomprehensible figure Gogol describes, who existed long before quantum mechanics and who, in figures like Solzhenitsyn's Kostoglotov or the Strugatskys' own Victor Baniev, continues to endure all forms of seemingly irresolvable contradictory pressures. While scientists like Von Neumann seek, through metaphors tinged with a moral vision, to make material nature less alien, the Strugatskys, by placing their Gogolian heroes in the alien world of the Zone, seek the oppo- site: to render the familiar alien. But this road is never one-way. Victor Baniev, the hero of The Ugly Swans (1972), has endured World War II and knows there will always be war. Yet he accepts, illogically, to walk with the radiant children into their apocalyptic future. His last line, however, as he steps into the alien world, is significant: "All this is fine, but I'd better not forget to go back" (Swans 12:234). Through his power to go back he, like Kostoglotov and like Red Schuhart in his final wish, remains "young- er" than either the skeptic's dystopia or the sentimentalist's utopia, and for this reason: that he continues to exist in a never-determined, epistemologi- cally uncommitted present "time" which is always greater than any attempt to fix its direction. 5. All three writers, by testing the limits of knowledge so as to operate at what for them is the "edge" of the unknowable, produce structures of apprehension. Lem's epistemology limits itself, finally, through a fear of contact: What if the singularity were not so singular after all? For Heinlein the limit is the fear of death, the point at which body must participate in non-body. Or the fear that human beings will actually have to meet their maker, a superior being. But only the Strugatskys offer a level of tension commensurate with Pascal's remark: "The knowledge of external things will not console me for the ignorance of morality in time of distress."7 It is precisely here, because of this state of distress (our affective, existential limits), that epistemology cannot be separated from morality: not only can we know or not know the latter, but we must know it if we are to live. To Lem, because we cannot know the nature of the universe, we have no right, logically or morally, to legislate it. To Heinlein, we have this right only insofar as our laws coincide, providentially, with those of the physical world. To the Strugatskys, it is a matter of asserting an absurd right to parti-</page><page sequence="32">32 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 16 (1989) cipate in a universe that (as Pascal feared) is, if not morally neutral, at least morally silent. Lem's The Invincible (1964) responds to the Strugatskys' point of affliction. The word "invincibility" seems to add a moral imperative-that might makes right-to the epistemological search. Indeed, the protagonist, Rohan, distressed by the failure of this imperative, is tempted to push the moral argument further, and participate in the alien phenomenon he is investigating: "[N]othing was impossible at this point-he simply felt an urge to participate in this murky mystery, whose significance, he was quite sure, would forever remain beyond his understanding" ([1 1]:216). Yet ulti- mately, the promise of participation proves but another sterile mirror. His action does not produce the peace of complementarity; it only reinforces the agonizing separation of paradox by projecting his own desire for "victo- ry" onto the alien, annihilating his own being in the process: "[H]e felt so superfluous in this realm of perfected death, where only dead forms could emerge victoriously in order to enact mysterious rites never to be witnessed by any living creature" (Invincible [11]:217). Participation remains a Berkeleyan fantasy here-an illusion that disappears when no human is present to witness it. Heinlein's version of this same problem of invincibility is I Will Fear No Evil (1970). His protagonist, like Rohan, walks the valley of the shadow of death. But, unlike Rohan, he hopes to walk alone. Lazarus as sensorium expands, but Johann Sebastian Bach Smith contracts. Instead of seeking to participate in the alien materiality of death, he has his brain transplanted into another body. And he continues to cannibalize, telepathically and genetically, other selected parts of the outer world. His "morality" consists of ingesting just those parts of the "indigestible" he wants in order to save his personal spark of life. What he rejects as alien-the whole human world as we know it-is again left to enact its dying rites, non-existent because unobserved. Epistemology and fiction join to become SF when the ancient struggle against "destiny" becomes a hope of conquering material forces by know- ing them. The instrument of conquest is no longer endurance or faith, but reason. In Lem, as we have seen, the two do not join, and knowledge is necessarily a retreat both from action and from fiction. And in Heinlein epistemology becomes pure fiction-where the fantasy of the knowing sen- sorium can finally do no more, in swallowing its tale, than ingest the idea of destiny it claims to reject. The Strugatskys, on the other hand, offer a particularly satisfying com- bination of science and fantasy. They deal openly with the question of human invincibility and vincibility in their novel Definitely Maybe (1976). Strange forces here seem to impede the work of a disparate group of scien- tists. They postulate that humanity, on the way to becoming through know- ledge a super-civilization, is being checked by the nature of the universe</page><page sequence="33">STRUCTURES OF APPREHENSION 33 itself-by the homeostatic balance between reason and entropy that regu- lates it. As researchers, they have no choice but finally to capitulate in favor of their moral life-social and family obligations. Protagonist Dmitri, holding out longer than the others, describes the moral nature of his lack of action in ironically familiar terms: I was proud of myself and respected myself. I thought that a soldier who remained at his machine gun to cover his retreating comrades must feel like that. He knows he will be here forever....And he knows that it is right, that it can be no other way. (11:125) He is free but only in chains. And the road to knowledge here is a variant on the anisotropic road: "I was told this road would take me to the ocean of death, and turned back halfway. Since then the crooked, roundabout, god- forsaken paths stretched out before me" (9:104). This is the condition of Dmitri's (all-too-human) search to know. But there is Vecherovsky, the man to whom the other scientists confide their fatal discoveries, the seeker after connections who absurdly takes on the universe. If it is aliens, you fight; if it is the universe, you have to give in-this is the fatal either/or logic Vecherovsky overturns by his decision to go on. He knows he must give in, yet still he chooses to fight, just as Pascal's reed knows the universe crushes it, but continues to think. And with thinking to hope, to console himself for this terrible knowledge of the external, homeostatic universe. The search to know has grown here; and out of the complementarity that replaces Pascal's morality comes-as with Red's final wish-an act of faith. A scientist's faith: There's no hurry....There's still a billion years to the end of the world.... There's a lot...that can be done in a billion years if we don't give up and we understand, understand and don't give up. (Maybe 12:142) NOTES 1.

See the "review" of the fictitious book The New Cosmogony, in A Perfect Vacuum (NY: Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich, 1979), pp. 197-229. We have there, behind a Swiftian apparatus this time, another statement of "the idea of the palimp- sest Cosmos-Game with its unseen Players who are perpetually alien to one ano- ther" (p. 200). All this makes us wonder how seriously we should take this idea, especially in relation to Roadside Picnic. The first item in A Perfect Vacuum is, as it were, a review of the book itself, whose author is "S. Lem." This book exists, then (even if its reviewer, who is not "Lem," is fictitious). And here we read (of The New Cosmogony reviews): "Did Lem really think he would not be seen through in this machination? It is simplicity itself: to shout out, with laughter, what one would dare not whisper in earnest" (p. 7). 3. On the mental theater, see David Hume's A Treatise of Human Nature, Book I, Part 2, Sect. vi: "Of the Idea of Existence, and of Extemal Existence"</page><page sequence="34">34 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 16 (1989) (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1967), pp. 67-68: "Let us chace our imagination to the heavens, or to the utmost limits of the universe; we can never really advance a step beyond ourselves, nor can conceive any kind of existence, but those perceptions, which have appear'd in that narrow compass." Even Hume saw such skepticism, in practical terms, as too radical. 4. See Norbert Miller, Die empfindsame Erzdhler: Untersuchungen an Roman- anfangen des 18. Jahrhunderts (Munich, 1968), p. 33: Nicht umsonst gibt man dabei Eigenschaftswortern wie: zartlich, trefflich, sittsam, wehmiitig, von gezielten und eindeutig festlegenden Adjektiven den Vorzug. Der Wortschatz zieht sich in die allgemeine Verbindlichkeit des Herkommlichen zuruck, das die einzelen Worter wie Kieselsteine in einem Flussbett abgeschliffen hat. Die Oxymora der gemischten Empfindungen lassen wohl die Gegenstaze noch spurbar werden, nehmen ihnen aber den Stachel oder die Reibung. (It is no accident that [writers of the period] prefer vague adjectives of quality like 'tender,' 'excellent,' 'modest,' [and] 'sorrowful' to more pointed and unambiguous ones. Their vocabulary falls back on commonly accepted meanings of words, words which tradition has worn down and polished like pebbles in a stream. The oxymora used in this period to present the mixture or confusion of sentiments still allow traces of the original opposition to be seen, but have removed asperities and pointedness.) 5. In his article "The Cybernetic Paradigms of Stanislaw Lem," in Hard Sci- ence Fiction, ed. George E. Slusser &amp; Eric S. Rabkin (Carbondale, 1986), Robert M. Philmus sees Lem, on the contrary, challenging the skeptical or Cartesian dicho- tomy between rational mind (as faculty that defines humankind) and the extended, material world as "alien" other. Philmus argues that there are several "incarnations" of Rheya, and that through these "she" shows "herself" to be "an entity capable of self-correction," hence a "self-determining" being that "participates in her doom, and in doing so asserts her autonomy" (p. 185). Thus one can envision, as part of the process of knowing the universe, the possibility of communication with the alien that is not simply a reflexive act. If for Philmus Lem is skeptical, it is in the original sense of "enquiring" rather than dogmatic: "[Lem's] approach is explorato- ry rather than assertive... .He remains wary of answers, especially those pretending to finality" (p. 200). For Philmus, however, Lem's main interest seems to be the question, not of human knowledge, but of human identity. The growing relation with the psi-Rheyas, for Philmus, frees Kelvin from the bondage of guilt. But does it free him from cognitive limitation? Following a line of reasoning present in Sola- ris, Philmus sees Lem's thinkers increasingly confronted with the Socratic impera- tive of "know thyself": "Because he has not accurately gauged himself, man cannot stand as the measure of the universe" (p. 202). The Humean problem of the percept, however-which I argue Kelvin confronts in Rheya-more radically challenges the possibility of ever knowing a self. 6.

Est-ce un theme ou un sujet? Fonctionne-t-elle ve'ritablement comme un proce'de de recherche? Si tel est le cas, en montrant le demarche par laquelle l'ettre humain enque'te sur le monde, la science pourrait ofirir a [a fiction de nouvelles dimensions et de nouvelles formes. Ainsi, pour S. Lem, une telle fiction devrait accentuer la (*structure descriptive&gt;&gt; du texte (procede par lequel on decrit et en</page><page sequence="36">36 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 16 (1989) decrivant, on comprend le monde exterieur) plutot que la structure des actions. Mais Lem doute que la fiction soit efficace a remplir cette tache puisque les struc- tures narratives sont traditionnellement limitees au point du vue humain. Cet essai examine la question pose'e par Lem: la science-fiction, peut-elle fonctionner comme une &lt;fiction e'piste'mologique&gt;&gt;? Pour ce faire, nous proposons de substituer a l' expression de Lem, &lt;&lt;structures descriptives&gt;&gt; la locution qui va au coeur du probleme: &lt;&lt;structures de l'apprehension&gt;&gt;. Le mot signifie perception ou entendement ainsi que appre'hension et crainte. Le terme &lt;&lt;appre`hension&gt;&gt; associe la connaissance a la terreur pascalienne ressentie par 1'e'tre humain face a la nature qui l'engloutit. De plus, le motfournit le lien qui relie la science a la fiction dans la formule &lt;&lt;science-fiction&gt;&gt; et enfin, il offre un moyen de mesurer la tension entre ces extre'mite's. Confronte' a la science en tant qu'epistemologie, Lem constate que la fiction est limitee par les structures humaines inhe'rentes au genre. Mais en cultivant ces structures de l'apprehension, la science fiction est le moyen narratif qui peut donner une forme a l'absence de forme ou au vide, c'est-ad-dire a la se6par- ation qui s'e'largit depuis Descartes entre la raison et le monde des res extensa. La lecture de trois textes cles, Solaris de Lem, Time Enough for Love de Hein- lein et Pique-nique au bord de la route des freres Strougatski, nous permettra d' examiner trois * structures de l'appre'hension&gt;&gt; dans la science-fiction actuelle. Le roman de Lem pre'sente ce que nous appelons la structure sceptique et celui de Heinlein, la structure sentimentale. Le re'cit des Strougatski illustre une troisieme structure plus complexe, celle de la comple'mentarite. Dans leur re'ponse a la duali- te de la raison et de la nature, les deux premieres structures sont peut-e^tre dignes du 18e siecle qui voulait que l'entendement humain soit conside're' comme un systeme cohe'rent et invariable. En accord avec les hypotheses re&amp;centes de la sci- ence, la troisieme structure montre la science-fiction en train d'explorer les rap- ports de participation entre raison et nature et donc convertir la dualite carte'sienne en une comple'mentarite' a la maniere de Bohr. (GES) Abstract.-What is the nature of science in SF, and what role does it play in shap- ing its fictions? Is it a "theme"? Or a "subject"? Or does it, as is often claimed, operate as a method of inquiry, causing fictional structures to shape themselves around the cognitive adventure of humankind as it investigates the material uni- verse? Such fiction, for Stanislaw Lem, would have to focus, not on actions or char- acters, but on the "structure of the description." But Lem doubts that fiction, because its structures are traditionally limited to a human viewpoint, is (inherently) adequate to this task. Epistemological or "cognitive" fiction for Lem is a logical contradiction in terms. And yet Lem himself is drawn to attempt such fiction. And to do so within the traditionalframe, not just offiction, but of SF. This essay examines the limitations and possibilities of SF as epistemological fiction. In order to do so, however, it modulates the problem by renaming Lem's structures of description structures of apprehension. To apprehend is not simply to know, but to touch and to fear as well. The term is more apt than Lem's because it takes into consideration the fact that human science-precisely because, as Lem says, humankind's theories are fictions, and hence mirror-images of the human mind and the mark of its inherent limitation-is both a logical and an apprehensive process, where the fear is the loss of a human identity itself. Apprehension is the</page><page sequence="37">STRUCTURES OF APPREHENSION 37 tension on the thread that links science and fiction in the SF compound. And SF, under the sign of this apprehension, is the fictional form that most clearly addresses the increasing epistemological separation, first formulated by Descartes and Pascal, between human reason and extended nature-inner and outer space. This essay examines three existent structures of apprehension in SF: the skep- tical, as exemplified by Lem's Solaris (1971); the sentimental, as in Heinlein's Time Enough for Love (1973); and in the Strugatskys' Roadside Picnic (1972), the complementary. The first two remain essentially 18th-century responses to the mind-nature duality-responses whose apprehensive nature derives from the fact that the human mind in the first case, or the human form in the second, strives to preserve, in its cognitive dealings with the extended world, its identity as coherent and invariable system. In the Strugatskys, however, we have signs of SF seeking-in line with recent speculation in science on the human mind as a system in constant participation with the phenomenal world-to convert Cartesian duality into a relationship of complementarity in the Bohrian sense of the word.
