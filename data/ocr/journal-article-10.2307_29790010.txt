<plain_text><page sequence="1">261 AN IMAGINARY TERRITORY: THE PROBLEMATIC OF SPACE IN ZIONIST DISCOURSE Uri Eisenzweig I. THE DISCURSIVE CONDITION OF ZIONIST SPACE In the writings of the first Zionists ? that is, those who appeared during the second half of the 19th century ? there is a particularly striking characteristic: the conceptual or even abstract vision of the space necessary for the bringing together of the Jewish people. By a conceptual vision of space, I mean the privileged connection between space, a priori geographic, and a linguistic discourse. This dis? course, clearly the Zionist ideology itself, is that logical progression of ideas based on certain premises (anti-Semitism and its appar? ent permanence in the Diaspora) leading to the conclusion that the Jewish people require a geographic homeland. The diversity of view? points within the Zionist movement, since its inception, as to the character of this home? land ? cultural or state-regulated, secular or religious, socialist or capitalist, etc. ? must not conceal the fact that Zionism, in all its forms, calls for, above all, a geographic concentration (partial or total is of little importance) of that which is spatially dispersed. Yet it is precisely on the geographic plane, in these same Zionist writings, that the desired space is presented as being, to a certain extent, unspecified. To a certain extent only, because obviously the specific notion of Eretz-Israel (The Land of Israel) is present throughout in one form or another. But, specifically, what it is necessary to emphasize is this new, revolutionary fact Uri Eisenzweig is an Associate Professor of French at Rutgers University, New Brunswick, N.J This article was translated from the French oy Debra Bendel. 0304-4092/81/0000~0000/$02.50 ? 1981 Elsevier Scientific Pu within Jewish discourse: Palestine is no longer the only option for the Jewish people. Even where it is apparently a question of only the biblical Promised Land, its reality is perceived in relation to the discourse that molds it whereas, up until this time, on the contrary, the Jewish tradition had situated it in a center, a source from which all possible Jewish discourse proceeds. The true Zionist revolution is not the Return to Zion; it has already been said often enough that this return had been at the center of Jewish thought for 2,000 years. On the contrary, the real change brought by Zionism, and this cannot be empha? sized enough, is the detour leading to Zion via Argentina, Uganda, the United States and other locales [ 1 ]. It is along this route that a sort of Copernican revolution manifests itself in Jewish thought. The return is no longer the wished for consequence of the fact that the land of Israel exists, but rather, it is this land ? or possibly another ? that is henceforth necessary for the solution of the Jewish prob? lem. This point is essential to comprehending the nature of Zionist space. II. TERRITORIAL INDETERMINATION: SPACE AS EXCHANGE VALUE It is in the writings of precisely those who see Palestine as the only possible territory that the Holy Land, though still considered a religious imperative, becomes in fact a social necessity, and loses by this its holiness and exclusivity. Thus in his work Rome and Wishing Company</page><page sequence="2">262 Jerusalem (1862), the socialist Moses Hess affirms that, "A common, native soil is a pre? condition for introducing healthier relations between capital and labor among the Jews. The social man, just like the social plant and animal, needs a wide, free soil for his growth and development" [2]. Here non-Marxist socialist, later Cartesian positivist, this will always be a linguistic discourse that situates Zionist space in a system productive of meaning. And, regardless of what they intend, the proponents of Zionism, through the very logic of their arguments, cannot help but involve the land of Israel in a process of exchange: land for necessity. Thus annulling, finally, the unique character of the object, this step will eventually place Palestine in a problematic geographic equation. Problematic, certainly, for those who persist in investing this space with unique privilege. Thus, Peretz Smolenskin, in an essay written immediately after the Russian pogroms of 1881, affirms that if "there is no doubt that it would be best for people who are leaving one country to migrate together to the same new land, for they could then understand and help one another," then it is equally certain that this land is Palestine: "If the wave of emigration is to direct itself to one place, surely no other country in the world is conceivable except Eretz-Israel" [3]. Ob? viously, the same certainty does not exist in both cases. From a logical deduction or reasoning based on experience we have come to a more or less arbitrary affirmation. Further? more, this apparent, unequivocal exclusivity of Palestine does not prevent the author from enumerating, on the next page, the advantages of this location over other countries "such as North or South America" [4]. And the least one can say of these advantages ? six in all ? is that they are not all purely spiritual (I will return to this later). Thus, whatever Smolenskin himself thinks, his discourse situates Eretz Israel in a differential relationship. However, it is Leo Pinsker, in his famous Auto-Emancipation (1881), who will say out right what the others refuse to formulate: We must, above all, not dream of restoring ancient Judaea. We must not attach ourselves to the place where our political life was one violently interrupted and destroyed. The goal of our present endeavors must be not the "Holy Land," but a land of our own. We need nothing but a large piece of land for our poor brothers; a piece of land which shall remain our property, from which no foreign master can expel us [5]. And Pinsker goes on to enumerate the criteria ? all of them functional ? that should be used to select the ideal territory. His state? ment of position here is particularly important because Auto-Emancipation was clearly the first far-reaching manifesto of the ideology proposing a solution to the Jewish problem outside the Diaspora. Moreover, several years later, Pinsker (thanks to the impact of this very publication) became the leader of the Hibbat Zion movement whose goal was the implanta? tion of Jewish colonies ... in Palestine. All this, however, precedes the birth of the Zionist movement proper by several years. In fact, it is not until the rise of "political" Zionism ? that is, the official organization created by Theodore Herzl in 1897 ? and its actions vis-?-vis the various great powers of the epoch, that the problem concerning the choice of territory becomes critical. It is essentially symbolized by the question of Uganda, pro? posed as a territory for a Jewish homeland by the British government in 1903, then rejected by the Zionist congress of 1905, which led to the departure from the Zionist organization of a faction called "territorialist". It is not within the scope of these pages to relate a history of this or of other events in the Zionist saga. However, one cannot overemphasize the tremendous importance of this episode, an importance lying less in the rejection of the English proposal than in the incredible fact that Uganda was seriously considered by the Zionist organization and its militants. Certain? ly the Zionists' refusal of Uganda confirms, if need be, the specific character of the Land of Israel in the Jewish cultural universe; but it is</page><page sequence="3">263 the thinking that precedes this refusal that indicates the profound meaning of Zionism and, particularly, the purely differential posi? tion the dreamed-of space occupies in Zionist discourse. This vision is no longer that of an individual or a small minority, but of a social ensemble, whose inter-discursive dynamic un? doubtedly expresses the desires and visions of a significant part of the European Jewish population. From this point of view one can perfectly well state that the proposal regarding Uganda, far from being Theodore Herzl's personal and therefore arbitrary initiative, which is what his adversaries reproached him with at the time, is the proof par excellence that the Herzlian discourse, through its very contradictions, expressed a collective vision. This fact is significant because, as we will establish, the indetermination of the territory is at the basis of his discourse. In other words, the debate over Uganda was inscribed into the course of the Zionist movement since its birth. The publication of The Jewish State in 1896 marks Herzi's comprehensive transformation from an assimilated Jew into a symbol of the battle for recognition of the Jewish national reality. In his writings, as in those of his prin? ciple predecessor, Pinsker, the passage from assimilation to Zionism results from the brutal perception of modern anti-Semitism; Herzl confronts Dreyfus' degradation in Paris as Pinsker responded to the Russian programs of 1881. And the resulting discourse will be strangely similar to Pinsker's in that it separates the idea of a Jewish state from any specific ter? ritory [6]: "It is true that the Jewish State is conceived as a peculiarly modern structure on unspecified territory. But a state is formed, not by pieces of land, but rather by a number of men united under sovereign rule" [7]. This "unspecified territory" is for Herzl, as for Pinsker, purely functional; it serves as refuge for the Jewish people, a refuge that the people will possibly have to build themselves. Thus, in a purely Cartesian metaphor, Herzl describes the "return to Zion" (a term, moreover, that he does not utilize in the text) as a simple move: Dull brains might. . . imagine that this exodus would be from civilized regions into the desert. That is not the case. It will be carried out in the midst of civilization .. . We shall not dwell in mud huts; we shall build new more beautiful and more modern houses, and possess them in safety ... We shall not leave our old home before the new one is prepared for us [8], The metaphor, or rather the image, of the house is not merely representative; it guides the entire (ideo)logical discourse, always with? in a purely Cartesian line: "If I wish to substi? tute a new building for an old one, I must demolish before I construct. I shall therefore keep to this natural sequence. In the first and general part I shall explain my ideas." [9]. Later we will again find this enclosure of the refuge, of the new house (= solid) or the old (= shaky). This is certainly not fortuitous in the rhetorical articulation that connects the Zionist discourse to the space that is its object. For the moment let us be content with establishing the fundamental indetermination of the dreamed-of space, of the territory. This indetermination is not simply a symptom of Herzl's genuine indifference to the specific Jewish cultural heritage, but the necessary product of the positivist discourse that sees the Diaspora as problem and the territory as solu? tion-, it is the condition prerequisite to such a discourse founded on exchange. In fact, Zionism must necessarily have been created by assimilated Jews like Pinsker, Herzl and others, because only they possess this psychological indifference, which is a correlate of territorial indetermination. Hence, when the Zionist organization decided in favor of Palestine in 1905 (sym? bolically, one year after Herzl's death), it was under pressure from the Eastern European delegates, who were in the majority. Herzl himself persistently espoused a political "ter ritorialism" with Argentina (1896-97), Cyprus (1901-02), the Sinai (1902) and finally Uganda (1903?04), all geographic symbols of the negation of Palestine. Still, the latter remains</page><page sequence="4">264 within the Herzlian discourse because of the intransigence of the Eastern European Jews. But, as Haim Weizmann, who later became president of the State of Israel, observed at the 1931 Zionist Congress; Palestine and the Jewish State seem to alternate in the mind of Zionism's founder. When Herzl spoke of a Jewish State in 1896, his description of the country (moun? tains, rivers) did not correspond, to say the least, to the Palestinian landscape. And when, under pressure from the Zionist majority, Palestine became the privileged object of his actions, it was the dimension of statehood that seemed to fade. Let us add that when Palestine and the State seemed to be reunited after all in Herzl's futuristic work Altneuland, published in 1902, it was Judaism that, in its turn, had vanished. In this narrative, set in 1923, Palestine has supposedly already been a Jewish state for several years, and the social and economic structures of the state, as well as its mores, are described in detail. Now if this is an explicitly liberal Utopian society (women are fully emancipated, religion is disassociated from the state, criminals are re-educated rather than punished, etc.), a Zionist like Ahad Ha'am [10] could legitimately ask what is specifically Jewish about the new state: Hebrew is not its language, Jewish culture hardly appears in it, and the name of Zion is not even mentioned! Such an inconsistency, however, was necessary: the Herzlian discourse, through its political praxis, could not help but oscillate between the concept of space (its point of departure), and its contradictory social mani? festations ? on the one hand the State (its heritage of 19th century chauvinistic national? ism and, on the other hand, Eretz-Israel (the influence of traditional Jewish culture). Ahad Ha'am's critique provoked a signif? icant reaction from Max Nordau [11], who asserted that Ahad Ha'am could not or would not leave his ghetto [12]. In fact, if Nordau's ironic reply seems pertinent, Ahad Ha'am having been almost constantly opposed, in the name of "cultural elitism," to a massive immi gration to Palestine, it is at bottom even more reliable. Indeed, the opposition between the "territorialists" ? that is, those Zionists who placed the need for a territory above the specificity of Palestine ? and the others, generally separated Western European Jewry from Eastern, nearly assimilated Judaism from ghetto Judaism (such as it survived) in Poland, and especially in Russia (the Ukraine). In 1900 Eastern European Jewry numbered about four and a half million persons, of whom more than four million were confined by Russian law within the "residence zone". In this huge ghetto, up until then, the environ? ment had favored the perpetuation of a spe? cifically Jewish culture since the pre-industrial economy permitted an almost total segregation of the Jew in his shtetl [13]. But with industri? alization at the doors of Russia, the feudal Czarist regime began to totter, and the walls of the Jewish ghetto to crumble. The pogroms of 1871 in Odessa, and then especially those of 1881 in more than 160 Russian and Ukranian cities and villages, which were encouraged by the government, signaled that the traditional Jewish shtetl was progressively losing its raison d'etre; industrialization was eliminating the artisans and the rising Russian middle class was becoming large enough to replace the intermediary Jewish class. Moreover, the un? employment endemic to the industrial revolu? tion in Eastern Europe precluded the Jewish artisans and petits-bourgeois taking a place in the nascent economic system. So there was a large-scale emigration of the Jewish population, but in a certain sense a departure inverse to that of the Jews of Western Europe. Whereas the latter had abandoned or tried to abandon Judaism in order to integrate themselves into the new liberal society, the Russian Jews, in an ever-growing trend, left pre-industrial Russian society for other countries (especially the United States of America), or for other places; a future socialist society or the Zionist homeland. It was uncommon for these Jews to relinquish Judaism. On the contrary, it is at</page><page sequence="5">265 the heart of Jewish culture preserved in the East that the western language of emancipation will find the territory in which to take root: Palestine. On the other hand, unlike a purely geograph? ic transfer, dreamed-of spaces invoke a dis? course. Thus confronting a socialist discourse advocating an "external" transformation of Jewish social structures, a Zionist discourse emerges that seeks to transform Jewish society from within by, first of all, changing the Jews themselves. Certainly it is not too astonishing to see the fusion of these two discourses that originate from the same historical situation, sometimes on the political plane: on one side there is the Bund, a Jewish socialist non Zionist group founded in 1897, one month after the first Zionist congress, and on the other one finds the Zionist socialists, who rapidly became the dominant force in Zionism in general and in the Jewish population in Palestine in particular. However, the essential point here is the specific connection between the historic situation of Russian Judaism at the end of the 19th century and the dreamed of space of Zionism. As opposed to Herzl and the other more or less assimmilated Jews whose stand on the necessity of a national territory was the result of positivist reasoning on the subject of the Jewish problem, the Russian Zionists felt the need for a language that could express politically (that is, in a manner com? patible with the epistemology of industrial society) the desire for a specifically Jewish solution to a Jewish problem. Herzl's success among Russian Jews is due, therefore, to the fact that his language responds to a precise historic necessity. "If I wish to substitute a new building for an old one, I must demolish before I construct" [14]. It is Herzl's Cartesian discourse that makes apparent the total "im? passe" of Jewish existence in a Diaspora, even (or especially) an industrialized one; and it is ghetto Judaism that will "build," in giving a name to the negation of this Diaspora. How? ever, this unconscious schema is not as simple as it sounds: a new perspective will appear along with the space designated by the name, that is, with the location. Indeed, the new Israel will be erected ? can only be erected ? on a vacant site. And the Herzlian "demolition" goes well beyond the intention of its proponent: his positivist dis? course that analyzes so well the impasse of the Diaspora is in fact founded on a vision of the world that, at the same time, creates the peripheral void typical of ethnocentrism. Later we will examine the epistemological functioning of this discourse that is not specifically Zionist and that articulates itself around the concept of Nature, and more specifically Nature as Space. For the moment let us be content to emphasize the autonomous dynamic of the Herzlian discourse, a dynamic that renders it so desirable for the coherent expression of the Zionist project. In effect, "territorial indetermination " rejected by the Eastern European Jews, is yet incontestably useful to them; by negatively qualifying the dreamed-of space in regard to Palestine, it also inevitably does this in regard to any possible Palestinians. Without doubt the greatest tragedy of Zionism is that it was able to deploy itself only in a discursive space where all otherness is absent or neutralized. A tragedy because the Other was there, of course. But a tragedy also in the fact that this inscription of Jewish liberation in colonialism was ineluctable given the existential structures of the Judaism of the residence zone; I will return to this with what will constitute the second part of the presentation of the early Zionist discourse. We will see that the enclosed structure of Jewish society in the shtetl calls for a certain denial of the Other (the Russian Other, who forces the Jew to live as he does), a denial that operates on several levels of expression, and above all on the plane of the imaginary. Also, to the extent that Zionist discourse was put into practice by the pioneers coming from this particular world (and, in fact, a vast majority</page><page sequence="6">266 of the first, and especially the second wave of Zionist immigrants came from the Russian Residence Zone), and likewise to the extent that Israeli society is paradoxically founded even today on a value system inherited largely from shtetl Judaism, one can affirm that the relatively colonial character of Zionism (colonial less in its realizations or aims, in reality, than in its vision) is the product of the external laws (Russian and other) that former? ly constituted the residence zones for the Jews. Thus it is in its denial of the Other that the Herzlian discourse had its extraordinary impact on the heart of Russian-Polish Judaism. Cor relatively, it is through the affirmation of Self (the Name, the ancestral culture), that the refusal of the basis of this discourse and denial ? that is, of territorial indetermination ? was articulated by these Jews from the Zone. This is how we must understand the remark made in 1903 by Haim Weizmann, a Jew from the Zone, to the English Jew Israel Zangwill, a novelist known for his descriptions of the ghetto and a proponent of the Ugandan option: "You are a photographer of the ghetto; not its psychologist" [15]. So from its inception Zionist discourse ap? pears torn between theory (Herzl) and praxis (the Russian and Polish pioneers). This split in the Zionism of 1900 between the Palestinian absolute (Jewish culture) and the linear dis? course (the logic of liberal emancipation) which, alone, could lead there, is perceptible even today in a large part of Judaism. Doubt? less it is this split, this confrontation between the place and the territory, between the Name and the Concept, that, up until the 1967 war, would guarantee the astonishing yet genuine innocence of this bizarre colonialism that has few colonialists. III. THE SPACE REFERRED TO BY MODERN LINGUISTIC DISCOURSE: NATURE The first success of political Zionism: the Balfour Declaration in which the British government supported the creation of a "national Jewish homeland" in Palestine, was published in 1917. One year after the publica? tion of this document, where the colonial dis? course espoused the Zionist endeavor to inte? grate the spatial referent into the concept that proceeded from the positivist necessity, a text appeared that, from a certain point of view which we shall try to establish, could be con? sidered its theoretical substratum: Ferdinand de Saussure's Cours de linguistique generale [18]. The political discourse found its vehicle. 1. The Referent of the Saussurian Sign: Natural Space What concerns us here, due to the importance it will have in the history of linguistics and semiology ? that is, in the history of philosophy is the Saussurian definition of the linguistic sign. Integrated as it is in the autonomous sys? tem that is language, Saussure's linguistic sign is arbitrary in relation to its referent and dif? ferential within the system itself. Furthermore, due to its phonetic aspect, it is linear because it unfolds in time. This definition is too well-known today for one to dwell on. What has passed nearly un perceived, however, is the particular status of the referent as it follows from such a definition of the linguistic sign. A rapid analysis will show, in effect, that this referent is identified with an exclusively spatial universe, and that this referential space is quite specifically character? ized. The arbitrariness of the sign refers to a double determination of its referent: extra linguistic and natural. Of course it is not the arbitrary character in itself that so places the referent of the sign, but rather the very ques? tion that underlies it; one cannot state the problem of the motivation or non-motivation of the sign [17] without implying the distinct existence of both the sign and the object that it presumably designates. One need not specify that an object's distinct and autonomous existence, outside of all designation, is equiv</page><page sequence="7">267 alent to a Nature [18]: the object is what it is ? naturally. Yet, in as much as it is arbitrary, the sign refers as well, through an obvious logical neces? sity, to a nature that is partially or totally in opposition to it. In effect, if the referential universe was not essentially different from the sign that refers to it, the arbitrary character of the sign would obviously not exist. So it is here that the other characteristics of Saussure's linguistic sign come into play: being differential, it implies the existence of a continuous referent, and being linear, it indicates an instantaneous object. The referent of the Saussurian sign can therefore be integrated into a class with a quite limited extension. The object is no longer un? specified: in order to remain extra-linguistic, it must be naturally continuous and instanta? neous. Now, a priori, what can constitute such a referent of the linguistic sign? Clearly any participation of Time is precluded since it must be instantaneous, as are all conceptual elements (value, feeling, etc.), since it is neces? sarily continuous. Only the spatial remains and, in fact, what can appear continuous and instantaneous if not space? [19] "Appear": the word is pertinent because it is here, in the heart of this referential residue that is space, that the ideological arises in so far as the Saussurian sign is consistent with a certain system of representation. One again finds this ideology, above all, in the truncated equation which allows that space referred to by language is Nature but which overlooks its correlative: Nature is nothing but space referred to by language. In Zionist terms: the Herzlian tragedy is that the discourse of Jewish eman? cipation participates in an ethnocentric struc? ture that sees in Palestine (as in the whole of the Third World) nothing but natural space - that is, space devoid of the presence of the Other - and that does not understand that the very concept of such a Nature is an artifact of this discourse. Now surely the privileged and exclusive Status of space as natural referent corresponds too well to the ideological needs of Western colonialism for this connection not to have meaning. In fact, we will later see that it is only recently that the science of objective space par excellence ? that is, 19th century academic geography ? is questioned from within as to its theoretical and epistemological presuppositions. (There are exceptions, of course,. . . e.g., Ratzel, a mentor of Franz Boas, the founder of American Anthropology), but they are the exceptions that prove the rule.) It is only in the sixties, with the publication of such works as those by Jacques Derrida, that the "deconstruction" of the Saussurian sign begins [20]; this, we will try to show, also implies the deconstruction of the extra linguistic referent and, more specifically, of space considered as Nature. This did not occur earlier because until now, until the evacuation of the last American soldier from Vietnam, and generally since the end of the Napoleonic wars, the discourse of Power was ? above all ? colonial. And Western colonialism requires a certain conception of space: Natural, that is non-historic, where all otherness is absent. From this springs modern geography, an essentially linguistic discourse on a referent presented therein as pre-existant, naturally, to this very discourse. 2. Deconstruction of the Sign, Semiotization of the Referent Saussure states that the linguistic sign is linear because it is phonic. Thus, disputing the privilege of the phone in language, Derrida undermines the very basis of the linearity of the sign [20]. Of course Derrida's intention is not to do away with all function of sound in language, but to denounce the strong tendency in western metaphysics to ostracize writing, considered, as it was, as a sign of a sign, an exterior representation of speech. This de? nunciation is essentially made (at least, in Of Grammatology) on the basis of the Saussurian</page><page sequence="8">268 text itself, Derrida's reading revealing in it a fundamental contradiction. Indeed, while granting privilege to the natural bond between meaning and sound, so relegating writing to a secondary position where its only function would be to represent speech, the Genevan linguist, on the other hand, sees the basis of the system of language in difference In fact, his entire conception of language is based on the principle of a system, of a closed, autono? mous organization whose functioning is purely differential and whose elements are values about which all one can say is that they are only that which the others are not. In other words: linguistic unity is at base a non-presence. Now, appearing in the heart of such a system where all immediate, intuitive presence is ex? cluded, the Saussurian reference to a natural privilege of this "substance" that would be sound, indicates the linguist's recourse to an ontology from which he cannot escape: the metaphysical ontology where every object is necessarily presence perceptible by intuition. This recourse, that thus creates a crisis in the heart of a differential conception of language, explains, moreover, the existence of a notion like the signified. Indeed, it is the signified that constitutes here the presence which is tran? scendental to the discourse and a correlate of the phonic character of the signifier: "There has to be a transcendental signified for the dif? ference between signifier and signified to be somewhere absolute and irreducible" [21]. Phonocentrism necessarily implies logo centrism. Thus Derrida's challenge is global. Demon? strating the metaphysical, logocentric character of the signifier-signified structure, establishing the indisputable connection between this and the "natural" privilege of sound in language, the philosopher is logically led to oppose the linearity of the sign that Saussure linked to his phonic characteristic. Following Heidegger, Derrida disputes above all the linearist con? ception of time: "What is here in question is not Saussure's affirmation of the temporal essence of discourse but the concept of time that guides this affirmation and analysis: time conceived as linear successivity, as 'consecutiv ity' " [22]. This is so because the linearist con? ception of time is based on a metaphysic of presence: it is necessary that there be presence, intuition, immediacy, in order to be able to form a consecutiveness (a succession of presences) in time. Derrida emphasizes as well the existence of a structural solidarity between linearity, on the one hand, and economics, technology and ideology on the other, con? cluding that "The end of linear writing is in? deed the end of the book" [23], in that it is in the latter that the one-dimensional unfolding of a thought finds its most absolute, most pre servable form. Thus, on a trajectory that moves from the signified to linearity, and from the latter to referential spatiality, a trajectory that is in no way a detour, the metaphysical notion of the signified, of the "idea" in itself, of the indepen? dent concept of the discourse, proves to be a close correlative of the natural spatiality of the referent. This fact is emphasized because it singularly illuminates the connection be? tween the late 19th-century positivist discourse (and, more to the point, the Zionist discourse) and the conception ? the perception, even, as we will establish later ? of space as exteriority naturally pre-existant to this discourse. If the linearity of the sign does not totally disappear on the basis of Derrida's critique, it at least becomes problematic ? and the status of the referent is transformed. Spatiality, the last refuge of its "nature," of The Nature, vanishes, as the arbitrary sign no longer implies a referent that is absolutely, necessarily in? stantaneous. Certainly, for all that, the problem is not resolved so long as the end of the Book, the end of linearity, is not yet established. De construction can only indicate the boundaries of a system of representation, not replace it. Still, an essential change has occurred: all nature will be henceforth excluded and all possible spatiality of the referent will be hence</page><page sequence="9">269 forth the product of a (con)text, of a specific discourse. The grammatological critique leads inevitably to the conception of the referent as a product of discourse [24]. Which is not to say that the referent takes the place of the signified. One such perception of the above-mentioned inversion is still to be ascribed to the Saussurian perspective, where exteriority implies spatiality. Now it is precise? ly this conception that has been "decon? structed". The referent is therefore not sub? stituted for the signified in a hypothetical "inferiority" of language. What changes, what must change, is the very basis of spatial differ? entiation between that which is sign and that which is not. In other words, the Saussurian structure of signifier-signified-referent. A co? herent integration of the referent into the semiotic process implies thus a small "Coper nican revolution" in so far as it is necessary to simultaneously give up the signifier-signified structure and the conception of the reference as exteriority. The dilemma presented above is irrelevant: there is no signified-referent duality because there is no signified. Thus, since the Copernican revolution in question necessitates another conception of the sign, it is not surprising to see that Derrida places, within a few pages of the very center of the chapter devoted to his reading of Saussure, an alterna? tive to this in the form of the semiotic project of Charles S. Peirce. Here is the Peircian definition of the sign quoted by Derrida [25]: Anything which determines something else (its interpretant) to refer to an object to which itself refers (its object) in the same way, the interpretant becoming in turn a sign, and so on ad infinitum. These dense lines are, from all points of view, worth dwelling on. First to emphasize what one finds in them: a chain of signifiers (signs, in Peirce's words) that determine one another (a signifier, as determiner of another signifier, is called an interpretant) in continuously re? newed and ceaseless relationship to a referent {object). Then, to specify what one does not find in them: the signified, or any other de? limited place where meaning could possibly take root. In Peirce's triadic and perpetually dynamic structure, meaning springs forth only through the difference: that which separates a signifier from "its" Other, a sign from its inter pretant. Such a definition of the sign corre? sponds better than any other to Derrida's perspective. Thus, in his procedure which aims at speci? fying the status of the referent and that of meaning in the semiotic process, Derrida is careful to emphasize the profound richness of Peirce's perspective: Peirce goes very far in the direction that I have called the de-construction of the transcendental signified, which, at one time or another, would place a reassuring end to the referral of one sign to another. I have identified logocentrism and the metaphysics of presence as the exigent, powerful, systematic, and irrepressible desire for such a signified. Now Peirce considers the indefiniteness of reference as the criterion that allows us to recognize that we are indeed dealing with a system of signs. What broaches the move? ment of signification is what makes its interruption im? possible. The thing itself is a sign [26]. What broaches the movement of signification is, of course, difference. Difference that, in Peirce's view, is situated both between the sig? nifying chain and the object as well as between the sign, ox represent amen, of the object and its interpret ant ? since "the thing itself is a sign". The process of signification is therefore infinite ? what Umberto Eco calls an "un? limited semiosis" [27] ? due to the inherent functioning of the sign that guarantees the non-presence of the thing: The so-called 'thing itself is always already a representamen shielded from the simplicity of intuitive evidence. The representamen functions only by giving rise to an inter pretant that itself becomes a sign and so on to infinity [28], Now, if the Peircian sign fits totally within Derrida's perspective, it is due to the fact that, for the French philosopher, the essential differ? ence is situated in the always inadequate, even</page><page sequence="10">270 impossible, in a sense, relationship of writing to speech. This relationship is not external but rather essential to the function of language, to its unlimited semiosis, in that this relationship is what creates the displacement inherent in the signifying chain, where meaning springs forth only in a non-presence or rather in a presence forever deferred. This non-presence is of the referent as much as of the subject: Spacing as writing is the becoming-absent and the becoming unconscious of the subject. By the movement of its drift/ derivation (derive) the emancipation of the sign constitutes in return the desire for presence . .. All graphemes are of a testamentary essence. And the original absence of the subject of writing is also the absence of the thing or the referent [29]. A purely differential conception of language calls for the Peircian definition of the sign in that, like the latter, it encompasses no tran? scendental signified on the one hand, and that, on the other, it denies the exteriority of the referent (as well as that of the subject), that is, its spatial nature. 3. Zionist Revolution and Structural Revolution On the basis of the deconstruction of the Saussurian sign we can take up a historical perspective on the Zionist discourse on space. This is so because it is not at all accidental that the Cours by the father of structural linguistics is, within a few years, contemporary with the formation of this discourse. In effect, the same split runs through the remarks of the linguist and those of the Zionists. If the revolution con? sists in the autonomy of corpus required in the one instance for the Jews, in the other for language, and if this revolution necessarily implies a differential conception of the system where the only values ? Zionist territory, linguistic unity ? will be exchange values, then both discourses are encumbered by a residue of tradition, ? the Name of Jewish liturgy, the Idea of Western metaphysics. And this connec tion goes further, inscribing itself in historical praxis: if Saussure's extra-linguistic "residue" is equivalent to a spatial Nature, a natural space, then it is precisely the naturalness of this extra discursive space that permits the Zionist "move" to Palestine, since it implies the absence of the Other. The emptiness of the site desired by Zionism is in some way guaranteed by the un? finished character of the Saussurian revolution. And by the very fact that it is a revolution. By this I mean that what links the discourse of the Genevan linguist to Zionist discourse is, above all, their revolutionary character which resides essentially in this requirement for the autonomy of the corpus. Indeed, we have already established that Western colonial? ism in general benefits by the granting of privilege to natural space as the referential universe of the Saussurian sign; in this context no particular distinction need be made for Zionism. On the other hand, what disassociates Zionism from colonialism is precisely that which strangely draws the former nearer to the linguistic theory of Ferdinand de Saussure: the autonomy of the corpus as primordial necessity. It is only within such a reversal of perspectives that the "residue" takes on meaning, the persistance of a traditional ele? ment through the revolutionary change, the persistence of the Self within the differential. In Saussure as in Zionism, but not in colonial discourse, where there is no motivation to? wards autonomy. So both Saussure and Zionism would evi? dence in their own way some of the elements of a discourse in crisis. We must keep in mind that this crisis is not created by the revolution in itself but by the fact that the revolution is not total. It is only in the context of such a split that, at present, the question can be raised of knowing in which History this crisis arises. In this as yet unwritten History, the fol? lowing theoretical propositions of which will serve only to indicate the possible direction, there appears a parallel evolution of the colonial</page><page sequence="11">271 perception of space, on the one hand, and the modern conception of the sign, of language, on the other. So it would be, in a way, a History of the "spatial imagination of the sign": this imagination, Derrida's reading of Saussure, shows us clearly that its dynamic knot consists of the connections between the scriptural and the oral or, more precisely, of the position of writing in language theory and practice. IV. FOR A HISTORY OF SPACE: CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS AND GUTENBERG 1. The Saussurian Sign and the "geographie des professeurs" Such a History, rather than tracing back to a possible origin, determines its own essential moments. One of these moments is when the blossoming of an objectifying "naturalizing" approach to space, in the form of the geography called, in France, "des professeurs", parallels Saussure's new conception of the sign. Of course this geography is not suddenly born in 1900. But the fact is that in 1905 Vidal de la Blache published his famous Tableau Geogra phique de la France and that, especially, it is only towards the end of the 19th century that geography starts to become a truly pedagogic discourse, first in Germany and then in France (with the establishment of free public educa? tion). From our point of view, this geographic dis? course involves one fundamental characteristic: being essentially a linguistic discourse, it presents space as natural reference. Yves Lacoste [30] clearly shows the ideological functioning of high school geography as it is taught even today: The grade-school teacher, the professor, especially in the past, had the students "make" many maps. But these are not large-scale maps which each student could see as an accurate representation of a spatial reality familiar to him, but very small-scale maps, useless, in most cases, within the usual frameworks; these are in fact symbolic images that the students must redraw themselves: formerly they were not even permitted to trace the maps, perhaps in order to better absorb them. The magic image that must be reproduced many times by the student, particularly today, in textbooks, is primarily that of the Fatherland. Other maps representing other States, political entities whose schematic symbolic characteristics serve to strengthen the opinion that one's own nation is an in? tangible given [given by whom?], presented not as a historical construction but a spatial entity engendered by nature. It is symptomatic that the eminently geographic term "country" has taken the place of the more political notions of State, of nation, in all discourses [31]. This "naturalization" of space is found at all levels of academic geography, and not only in elementary school. To take a famous example, we know that the work of Vidal de la Blache establishes the "region" as the primary and natural geographic unit. Regions and countries, as well as many other entities, coexist in a sys? tem where the carving out of territory has but one ambition: to erase the memory of its true historical existence. Lacoste's demonstration is quite clear and coherent when it reveals the "epistemological deficiencies" of the "geographie des professeurs" in its choice of the scales that inform the per? ception and presentation of the spatial units studied. The essential deficiency is that the geographic discourse is not concerned with justifying the choice of such scales, which leads it to confound the various objects of study. It is unaware that a variation in scale entails a parallel variation in the object; or, in other words, that the representation determines that which is represented. Such a theoretical weakness necessarily affects the methodological level, and the "new geographers" do not fail to dispute the results of positivist geography in the field. However, geography's "epistemological defi? ciencies" do not really seem to be understood by those who denounce them, as these defi? ciencies are not integrated unto a comprehen? sive semiotic perspective. Yves Lacoste con? siders "surprising" the geographers' refusal to think epistemologically, a refusal perfectly formulated, moreover, in the lines Lacoste himself cites from the article "Geography" in</page><page sequence="12">272 the Encyclopedia Universalis: "geography can? not be defined by its object nor by its methods, but only by its point of view." This "surprise" on the part of Lacoste, whatever he believes it to be, is not mere rhetoric, and his attempt to explain the absence of any discussion of epistemological presuppositions in the "geo graphie des professeurs" only emphasizes this. Indeed, Lacoste's texts seem obsessed by the "function" that he perceives in academic geographic discourse: that of "masking the strategic importance of theories of space. (This geography) conceals from the eyes of the greatest number the efficacy of the instrument of power that spatial analyses are" [32]. This functionalism is not a true response to the question of the epistemological presuppositions appropriate to geography and, consequently, the reader is not surprised to note Lacoste's surprise on this subject. This is because the "innocent" positivism of the "geographie des professeurs" is integrated into a system of representation in which the space indicated by the discourse is conceived of as Nature, where the spatial element is the final one that still eludes the differential sys? tem that regards the universe as representation and all representation as codified. The final element: it is in emphasizing this particular aspect of geographic space that its opponents can ask a significant question, even though their own answer to it is not satisfactory: "Geogra? phy is a representation of the world. But one does not speak of it as such in those circles which nevertheless concern themselves with clearing away all mystification and alienation . . Indifference? An absence of any discussion to be arbitrated among the geographers? Is it not more likely an unconscious complicity?" [33]. Our answer to this question is that the silence as to the epistemological foundations of the "science of the landscape" belongs to a con? ception of the linguistic sign as being essential? ly phonic. As natural space constitutes the exteriority of the naturally phonic sign, so the "geographie des professeurs" represents, in a way, the theoretical limit of the Saussurian transformation. The passage from the 19th to the 20th century articulates a decisive moment in the History of the concept "space": a moment of crisis, or rather the beginning of a crisis that has not yet ended. And, to the intersection of the Saussurian shift, geography and the Zionist discourse, one must logically add the plastic representation of space. 2. The Renaissance: "Birth of a Space," Birth of the Printing Press The transformation in the plastic representa? tion of space towards the end of the 19th cen? tury precedes those in language, physics and ideological discourse, not simply chronological? ly but in that it questions directly the referential status of space: We substitute for an art descriptive of a space supposedly ruled by Euclid's laws an art representative of the dis cernable forms of the mind .... Space, then, no longer appears as an attribute of matter but of thought and, within this evolution, a new relationship between space and time becomes clear [34]. One thus conceives of the relationship that links the art of Manet, Cezanne, Degas and other artists of this period to the structural revolution (Peirce, Saussure, Derrida) in semiology. And, of course it is logical that such an activity, referring to and being ex? pressed above all on the plane of space, should be the first to realize this decisive revolution . that "denaturalizes" spatiality and integrates it into language. However, in order to fully understand the meaning of this revolution and its importance in the theoretical perspective of our project, it will be useful to return to the crucial and symbolic moment when the basic epistemological structure was worked out. The essential components of that moment, in terms of our discussion, are the transforma? tion of the social status of writing, thanks to the printing press, and the correlative trans</page><page sequence="13">273 formation of referential space. So let us examine the moment of what Pierre Francastel calles the "birth of a space". This birth is not instantaneous, of course, nor is the status of space definite and finite, during the period that elapses between the Renaissance and the end of the 19th century. Still, there is a connective scheme between the invention of the printing press (1479), the discovery of America (1492), the figura? tive revolution of the Quatrocento ? and the expulsion of the Jews from Spain. These four historical events are essential, each in its own way, to our perspective: the first three deter? mine the structuration of space in discourse up until the present deconstruction, and the fourth mythically situates the Zionist vision within this epistemological whole. The discovery of America, in this context, appears as the emergence of a new space in the discursive framework that had constituted the "known," or rather imagined, world up until then. New: that is, in fact, exterior to this framework, to this discourse. For it is necessary to emphasize the essential duality that contrasts the American continent with the world as described in Ptolemy's Geography: sought as Asia [35], it is revealed, however, to be other than Asia, and, therefore, outside of the space defined by Ptolemy's geographic dis? course. Of course, such a duality cannot re? main in the framework of an Aristotelian con? ception of identity: indeed, America not (no longer) being Asia, it is the discourse ? geog? raphy ? that will have to be modified to take this into account. Yet, what must be emphasized is that the revolution created by the discovery of America is not only such an internal modification but also, especially, the emergence of a new hiatus between the dis? course and the space that is its object. The appearance of America in the field of vision of the surprised Genoese signifies, above all, the end of the absolute power of the discourse and, more specifically, of writing (traditional learning being scriptural) as to the determina tion of reality, of the referential universe. In 1492, space discovered on the basis of a dis? course asserts itself as present in spite of the discourse, and this naturally. This process of distinguishing between the discourse ? the Word ? and the space that it refers to, is equally apparent in the plastic representation of this period as well as, a little later, in the conception of language in general. "The passage from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance occurred when the philosophy of Nature began to develop. The Middle Ages believed that everything existed in God, that the universe possessed a profound unity as well as a personality. Thus the age was satisfied with a representation of juxtaposed spaces, no distance between things, everything, man and objects, being attributes of God. Simply, out of respect, divine objects and persons are not situated within any naturalistic order, no matter how minimal. The opposition is be? tween the incorporeal ? and therefore flat ? essence, and its attributes. But the latter are only the concrete manifestations of the essence. The Renaissance conceives of the opposition, the conflict between God and Nature, and in so doing allows for the repre? sentation of the closed space of a universe where, under the eye of God but in combat with him, men and objects move according to a limited number of fixed and autonomous laws. The basis of the Renaissance perspective is perhaps a hypothesis of the existence of the laws of the world as distinct from the laws of the mind. But it is also a belief in the materiality of objects, and in their stability" [36]. This long quotation is useful because it perfectly summarizes what is important in the modification of the status of space vis-?-vis discourse at the time of the Renaissance; in? deed, one can, without betraying Francastel's thinking, substitute the term "discourse" for that of "mind" in the opposition between the laws of Nature and those of thought, of the Word. The fact is that Francastel himself raises the question of the relationship of pre-Renais</page><page sequence="14">274 sance art not simply to discourse, but to writing. The relationship affects Byzantine art as well as Franco-Flemish figurative art and expresses not only a simple submission of space to the discourse that constitutes it but (at least for Italo-Byzantine art) a unity, a synthetic totality in which all is writing and all space is real. For Byzantium, all representa? tion is tied to the Christian dogma on which rests, as well, the social hierarchy of the universe. ... In a way, this is not represented space; the space indicated is real... The essence is one, and is everywhere in its totality. The universe is the actualization of God's thought. All space is real in the sense that represented space and lived space are identical to each other and to the universe. When a Byzantine painter decorates a church, he arranges the signs in an order that reproduces the supernatural arrange? ment of the world. Only the Word exists. Painting is an initiation, an introduction into conceptual reality [37]. The relationship of Northern art to writing is more ambiguous or, rather, more distinct, in that there is greater dependence on language than synthesis between the two. Nevertheless, this relative distance that separates the space and the word is a correlative of the specifically written character of the word. The figurative art of the Franco-Flemish world "remains a minor art, linked to writing," since it consists essentially of stained-glass windows and manu? script illumination. The great art of this area (the magnum opus) is architecture, to which sculpture is bound. The masses have only a global sense of the innumerable episodes depicted on the high stained-glass windows, which produce a general effect of luminosity. The more refined decipher the text at the same time as the illumination [38]. And Francastel concludes this stage of his analysis [39] by writing: "Figurative art is here dependent upon discursive thought." Let us examine the scriptural aspect of this discursiveness and try to outline some possible overtures towards a general perspective on our project. Of course these will be extremely cautious as we will not try to analyze directly the artistic reality (such as it was during the Middle Ages or the Renaissance), but to delineate those elements in Francastel's analysis that permit us to link the plastic representation of space as it is read by the sociologist to the problematic that concerns us: the concept of space. The first overture concerns the difference between Italo Byzantine art and that of the North. All the while asserting and demonstrating the similarity of these two artistic universes, consisting essentially of a direct connection between the spatial and the discursive, Francastel neverthe? less establishes the fact that they are different. This difference, we have seen, consists in a deeper Word-locus synthesis in Byzantine art as opposed to a more articulated connection in Franco-Flemish art. And the sociologist of art tends to reduce the difference to a technical problem: A comparison between the fate of Northern figurative art and that south of the Alps is extremely difficult because neither the social conditions nor technical traditions are the same. On the other hand, it has too quickly been asserted that there is no connection between the two. North of the Alps, during the Gothic era, mural decoration was replaced by the art of the stained-glass window which achieved a high degree of perfection ? certainly superior to that of the decorative Italo-Byzantine style of the time ? but, as far as figuration was concerned, containing certain limitations: the presence of the lead armatures required the endless fragmentation of scenes. Moreover, French civilization simultaneously saw the development of another figurative art, that of illumination, also requiring frag? mented composition [40]. What is striking here is this "simultaneity" that calls for an explanation not given in Francastel's analysis. The question that should be asked here is whether there is not some cor? relation between this absent explanation and the sociologist's submission to the contingencies of "technique". In other words, whether the meaning of the simultaneity between the arts of stained glass and manuscript illumination is not identical to that of the "technical tradi? tions." Indeed, what is this fragmentation implied "also" by illumination if not the imposition of the regime of writing*7. And this</page><page sequence="15">275 division of space by lead armatures, this articulation of what is represented in a multi? plicity of scenes ? what could be a better example of this than the articulation effected by writing on the hypothetical continuum of experience? What is being proposed here, and which certainly merits a study more serious than these simple overtures, is the possibility of reading the term "limitation," used by Francastel, in a less negative manner than he intended: limit, surely, but an interior and structuring one, since it is from within that this line of lead separating one scene from an? other articulates figurative representation in successive tableaux, as writing articulates a continuum into syntagmatic sequences. The meaning of this technical limitation that is writing would explain therefore, the above mentioned "simultaneity," since in contrast to the interior limit of stained glass art there is that exterior limit, characteristic of illumina? tion, that creates a hiatus between text and image. Would it not be in this sense that we must understand the complementarity of the stained-glass window and manuscript illumina? tion indicated by Francastel [41 ] ? My second suggestion would point towards Francastel's assertion that Franco-Flemish figurative art of the 14th century is minor because it is linked to writing, whereas the "great art in this area ... is architecture." This would of course imply that architecture is not linked to writing. Here one can only quote Panofsky who, in his study of Gothic architecture [42], indicates an articulation governed by a "principle of clarification" identical to that at the base of scholastic rhetoric. Panofsky writes: "the Scholastic mind demanded a maximum of explicitness. It accepted and insisted upon a gratuitous clarification of function through form just as it accepted and insited upon a gratuitous clarification of thought through language" [43]. Without confusing the perspectives of the two scholars [44], it seems that Panofsky's conclusions in this particular case can be fully integrated into Francastel's thesis, adding to it a necessary dimension. Indeed, it is essentially on the basis of the status of writing in the determination of represented space that the synchronic connection between the new vision of the Quattrocento, the discovery of America and the invention of the printing press will be elucidated. Towards this end Bourdieu, in his post? script to the French version of Panofsky's book, rightly stresses Marichal's interesting work [45] on the relationship between writing and Gothic architecture. Marichal uncovers several surprising homologies between the graphic aspects of writing and Gothic architecture. Moreover, this connection is confirmed in diachrony, the evolution of the two spheres being parallel. Leaving aside Panofsky's onto logical realism, one becomes aware that it is difficult to accept the thesis of a heterogeneity between architecture and writing in the Middle Ages, such as it is implied by Francastel's ana? lysis in the Etudes de sociologie de I art. Let us take up the totality of the proposi? tions we have discussed. We shall see that the logic of the transition from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance, as regards spatial repre? sentation, owes a great deal to the invention of the printing press. Indeed, if space in the Middle Ages is total; if this space is governed by the Scriptures, by writing; if the reign of the scriptural is based on resemblance ? "Up to the end of the sixteenth century, resemblance played a constructive role in the knowledge of Western culture" [46]; if writing therefore is space just as articulated space is writing ? then what is the printed text if not the end of this synthetic union, the birth of the dis? similarity, of the arbitrariness between script and space? What is the printed text if not the exteriorization of this interior "limit" con? stituted, in the heart of Gothic figurative space, by the lead armatures articulating stained-glass windows?</page><page sequence="16">276 We are not speaking of causality but of a meaningful structure that arises from the con? vergence, on the chronological plane, of the invention of the printing press and the emer? gence of a distance between the world of ob? jects and that world of what Francastel calls "the mind"; between the fixing of the discursive mark, the graph, in a mold that is more or less final, more or less arbitrary, more or less uniform in its linearity, and this revolu? tion that consists in "the plastic representation of the universe, the construction according to the rules, true or supposed, furnished by the senses and not based on the qualitative givens of the spirit" [47]. Which returns us, for a moment, to Christopher Columbus. We know that his vision of the Indies as approached from the East rested on the geographic discourse of the time, basically found in Ptolemy's Geography. I need not emphasize the fact that this work ? essentially linguistic, since the maps that doubtless accompanied the original text had long been lost ? translated into Latin in 1409, did not really enter the public domain until its printing in 1475. Nor is it necessary to recall that it is the printed text (in 1483) of Pierre d'Ailly's Imago Mundi that gave Columbu the idea that the earth is round. What I would like to note here is not the obvious, that is, the exterior, technical contribution that the invention of the printing press made to the wave of maritime discoveries, but the meaning that springs from this parallelism (already noted) between the epistemological inversion that characterises both the discovery of Americ&lt; and the plastic representation of space: at the center of this parallelism, like an axis or a pivot, stands printed discourse. It is writing, in its most absolute differentiality, in its clearest detachment from subject (which contributes to it only indirectly) and from referent (which no longer resembles it), and at the same time, in its most obvious linearity that, through the printing press, indicates henceforth an extra discursive natural space. However, the conception of language itself, in such a context, would seem to create a problem, at least on the level of diachrony. We know that Michel Foucault, in The Order of Things, situates the revolution in the con? ception of language at the beginning of the 17th century, clearly later than the moment of the metamorphosis of space which is its cor? relate. Such a chronological lag, however, is significant in so far as it covers the period during which the printing press emerges. It is interesting to note the role played (or, more precisely, not played) by the printing press in Foucault's view. His analysis wavers between, on the one hand, a radical distinction between what precedes the epistemological cut ("coupure") that ushers in the classical age from what follows it and, on the other hand, an implicitly more graduated conception of the passage from the Renaissance to the 17th century. In the first perspective, the concep? tion of space that follows from the conception of language described by Foucault clearly re? sembles that of the Middle Ages as seen in Panofsky's work and, especially, in Francastel's: in the treasure handed down to us by Antiquity, the value of language lay in the fact that it was the sign of things. S There is no difference between the visible marks that God has stamped upon the surface of the earth, so that we may know its inner secrets, and the legible words that the Scriptures, or the sagas of Antiquity, have set down in the books preserved for us by tradition. The relation to these texts is of the same nature as the relation to things [48]. [And, of course, as in the Middle Ages,].. . such an inter? weaving of language and things, in a space common to both, presupposes an absolute privilege of writing [49]. i What is still problematic is that Foucault attributes this privilege of writing ? considered as the basis of this total space ? to the Renais? sance alone: "This privilege dominated the entire Renaissance, and was no doubt one of the great events in Western culture" [50]. Thus there is a notable difference (if not an opposition) between Foucault's analysis and that of Francastel. All things considered, it seems to me that Francastel's perspective is more coherent.</page><page sequence="17">277 Indeed, does not Foucault himself, one page later, arrive at a contradiction that he qualifies as "apparent" but that, we shall note, is essential? The primacy of writing, the philos? opher tells us, explains the twin presence of two forms which, despite their apparent antagonism, are indissociable in sixteenth century knowledge. The first of these is a non-distinction between what is seen and what is read, between observa? tion and relation, which results in the constitution of a single, unbroken surface in which observation and language intersect to infinity. And the second, the inverse of the first, is an immediate dissociation of all language, duplicated, without any assignable term, by the constant reiteration of commentary [51]. This contradiction in Foucault's argument returns with the concept of Nature, which he does not hesitate to connect with that of writing: "Aldrovandi was meticulously con? templating a Nature which was, from top to bottom, written" [52]. This is a contradiction, because it seems obvious that the very concept of a nature exterior to the text that describes it necessitates at the very least a minimal distinction "Between what one sees and what one reads." But the solution is to look into Foucault's very hesitation: this minimal, new? born distance (it did not exist in the Middle Ages) indicates Foucault's other perspective where, between the total space of the Middle Ages and the dissociation between space and language characteristic of the classical age, the 16th century, essentially, is inserted. During this century, if "Knowledge . . . consisted in relating one form of language to another form of language" [53], the two languages are al? ready distinct, one being that of Nature, the other of writing. Now, between Foucault's alternating posi? tions ? the first indicating the inseparable whole of space/writing before the 17th century and thus the radical cut formed by the 17th century; the second distinguishing between writing and written (or described) Nature in the 16th century, and therefore necessarily posing such a distinction as an intermediary stage between the epistemological structures of the Middle Ages and those of the classical age ? between these two positions he rapidly mentions the printing press. Rapidly, although at the head of a list of elements that, according to Foucault, characterize, if not explain, the privilege of writing during the Renaissance: Printing, the arrival in Europe of Oriental manuscripts, the appearance of a literature no longer created for the voice of performance and therefore not governed by them, the precedence given to the interpretation of religious texts over the tradition and magisterium of the Church - all these things bear witness, without it being possible to indicate causes and effects, to the fundamental place accorded in the West to Writing [54]. Yet, even in first place [55], the function of the printing press in the epistemological revolution concerning language and Nature is underestimated by Foucault; printed writing is simply not the same as writing. The "great book of Nature" is not printed, one would imagine, but written by the hand of God. The distinction, although small, between the two languages, that of Nature and that which refers to Nature, is a distinction between two writings: "natural," "directly" written (by God or by his inspired representative) and the other, that of the printing press. Here a Derridian reading of MacLuhan is called for: would not the printed text, in a certain mythical space, refer to what is written by hand, as writing refers to the voice ? that is, as exteriority, "a-naturalness"? 3. 1492: the Birth of Zionist Space Discourse forming a natural space that is exterior to it is therefore a printed discourse. With the emergence of the printing press, writing first splits into a specular structure where Nature is but another writing, that of the beginning, of God. Then, logically, a simplifying operation will follow, where "Things and words were to be separated from one another" [56] radically, where "language was never to be anything more than a particular</page><page sequence="18">278 case of representation (for the Classics) or of signification (for us)" [57] which, in both cases, implies the absolute heterogeneity of Nature, of space, in relation to discourse ? to discourse in its totality, and no longer in relation to writing alone. Finally writing, through a dialectical return, will be expelled in its turn ? from the essence of language, from its "nature." [58]. But as it is not my purpose here to follow this evolution, I will be content to summarize the essential point: the significant and possibly mythic convergence of the respective roles of the discovery of America, the revolution in 15th century plastic arts, and the printing press, in the birth of this new space, Nature, which from now on is opposed to discourse. One should not wonder, therefore, at the persistent reference in Zionist discourse to this crucial period of the second half of the 15th century, since we know that it is precisely at this very moment, from this nascent space or, rather, from the site of the discourse that constitutes it, that the Jews were expelled. Certainly, it is less a question of an estab? lished correlation between the events (although such a relationship merits study) than of what was formed in the western Jewish mind at the end of the 19th century. This corresponds, moreover, to the realistic reading of the space of the Renaissance that appeared in the European positivist discourse of the period: "It is only in the 19th century, on the eve of decadence, that man, ceasing to read the myths, also ceased to read the space of the Renaissance, and believed in the realism of its drawing [59]. We can then understand how, in such a context, a political leader like Herzl was able to establish an insistent connection between the discovery of America, the inven? tion of the printing press, the expulsion of the Jews from Spain and the Zionist solution to the Jewish problem [60]. But also, this particular vision of causality and symbolics is a component of a praxis that will itself modify a real historic space: Palestine. That is, if Francastel is content to analyze space in the Renaissance as myth [61 ], denying it "realist" significance, one cannot take the same approach to our problem: the Herzlian (Zionist) reading of the Renaissance becomes reality on the basis of its political consequences. So the voyage of Columbus being equivalent to the advent of a natural spatial reality, free of all otherness, and Gutenberg's invention symbolizing the discourse on the basis of which this new space is created ? the con? temporaneous expulsion of the Jews from Spain (as well as from Sicily and Sardinia in 1492, from Provence in 1490 and from Portugal in 1497) signifies both the prohibition against their entering this Nature, and their being pushed back into the heart of the dis? course that creates it. Indeed, let us not forget that the expelled Jews went mainly to the precise areas where this discourse was articu? lated: Italy (Genoa, Livorno, Naples and Venice) and the low countries (Amsterdam, Antwerp). At the very moment that this distance between Nature and discourse was created, the Jews were thus pushed back into the heart of the discourse ? far from this ideal Nature, outside of Paradise. Moreover, this repression was car? ried out on a spatial plane: it was in 1516 that the first Jewish ghetto was formed, in Venice, by order of the Pope. Those in Rome (1555), Florence (1571), Mantua (1612), etc., fol? lowed. So the same discourse that established a new space, a Nature devoid of otherness, at the same moment confined the Jews to the very center of its site, at an increasing distance from this heterogeneous Nature. Which is to say that with this repression Desire is born: desire to integrate into the virgin space, and so to get rid of the oppressive otherness that is European discourse. To a great extent the beginnings of Zionist space are mingled with those of modern western space. Correlatively, if since about 1850 America has played a mythic role in the European Jewish imagination [62], the reason is not merely economic, and cannot be simply</page><page sequence="19">279 ascribed to the will to survive. The reason must be sought in the simultaneity of the ex? pulsion of the Jews from Spain and the dis? covery of the new continent, both situated in the context of printed discourse. In a way, Zionism is but the political project [63] aiming at the realization of this specifically Jewish Desire that dates back to the Renais? sance: to take possession of a space from which the Other is absent. V. THE NATURAL SPACE OF ZIONIST DISCOURSE AND THE DENIAL OF THE OTHER 1. The Spatiality of the Zionist Solution As obvious as it may seem at first sight, we must emphasize that the primary aspect of the Zionist conceptualization ? that is, the positivist discourse on which the political project is based ? is spatiality. If we have hitherto emphasized the particularly abstract character of this dreamed-of space, situated in a territory a priori unspecified, we must now stress the spatial essence of this abstraction. Whereas the positivist concept of space is in opposition to the nominal Site of the liturgical tradition, the spatial character of the concept of a "solution to the Jewish problem" is in opposition to the solutions proposed by the more or less open supporters of assimilation, whether bourgeois [64] or socialist [65]: indeed, both the solution to the Jewish problem through assimilation and the solution that seeks realization within the framework of a socialist society are based on a "de-spatializa tion" of the Jewish identity, this being, of course, a reference to the ghetto [66]. Herzl forcefully expresses the spatial char? acter of the solution to the Jewish problem in his description of the future State as well as in his general argument. Already, in The Jewish State, he characteristically likens the creation of such an entity to that of the rail? roads: In the earliest period of European railway construction some 'practical' people were of the opinion that it was foolish to build certain lines.... The impossibility of comprehending how trade and commerce are to be created in a new country which has yet to be acquired and cultivated, may be classed with those doubts of 'practical' persons concerning the need of railways... . [67]. This emphasis on the railroads is not accidental on the part of the founder of political Zionism. In his article "Judaism" Herzl devotes a long paragraph to the development of the means of communication from the Merovingians (!) up to the railroads [68]. Then, for about ten lines, he discusses the telegraph, abruptly concluding that the consequence of these revolutions in communication is colonial politics [69], which gives the Jews a unique opportunity to resolve their problem by acquiring ? "like everyone else" ? a land to settle on. The same argument, such as it is, is resumed in the lecture "The Jews as a Pioneer People" [70]. This characterization of the solution to the Jewish problem, as dependent upon a spatial problematic, as incribed in a cognitive context where the social is expressed, above all, spatial? ly, is found again in Herzl's insistent visualiza? tion of the future Jewish society. Significantly, the first activity of the pioneers will be, according to him, not the production of goods for basic consumption but communication net? works: "The poorest will go first to cultivate the soil. In accordance with a preconceived plan, they will construct roads, bridges, rail? ways and telegraph installations; regulate rivers; and build their own dwellings" [71]. Next in the lecture comes the reference to rail? roads, and then a quick and rudimentary de? scription of groups of workers' dwellings where, suddenly, idea becomes vision: "The Temple will be visible from long distances, for it is only our ancient faith that has kept us together" [72]. And Herzl stresses, at great length, the standards of construction for the future buildings [73]. However we will not procede here to a detailed analysis of the visual in Herzl's texts: we will content ourselves with</page><page sequence="20">280 these few revealing indications and with a few remarks by various historians and biographers like Amos Elon who, in his biography of Herzl, emphasizes his "extraordinary visual imagina? tion" [74], and notes that, in 1898, the Vien? nese journalist develops a sudden passion for architecture [75]. This passion was particularly evident in his futuristic work Altneuland (1902). This emphasis on the visual is significant. Indeed, on the basis of our analysis of the specific status of space in the discursive approach to the referent in the 19th century, we can see that such a privilege of vision in the conception of the future society necessarily implies a naturalization of its framework. And indeed, this is what, effectively, does occur. In this respect, it is symbolic that one of the very first to rally behind Herzl, in 1896, was a painter, the Englishman Holman Hunt. The meaning of this becomes clear when one realizes that Hunt painted Victorian figurative landscapes, because it is effectively a landscape that Herzl and his peers contemplated at the time of their later visits to Palestine. A land? scape ? that is, this object rising directly out of the Renaissance Revolution in the discourse space relationship. A landscape ? that is, the humanization of Nature. With the Renaissance, Pierre Francastel tells us [76], "art becomes descriptive of a universe restored to the norms of anthropomorphism. It is no longer God but Nature that has been humanized." Which, on another level, allows the thoughtful geographer to demystify geography, that is, to reveal the epistemological presuppositions on which it is based, at least up until now: On careful examination, what is the meaning of a view of the countryside if it neither represents the inaccessible, the mythically impossible, nor, allegorically, the space sur? rounded by fortresses, the domain of the sovereign, but if it shows a total space, entirely accessible, that extends without great obstacle into the distance, a space to which one can go? Is it not the representation of a space one would like to go to in order to go yet further? And who, then, looks, not from Heaven like God, nor from on high like the sovereign in his majesty, but from an accessible spot, the summit of a hill, for example, if not an individual? The landscape, it is the view extending towards a distant space from a familiar surrounding, towards what one does not well know, towards what one has not yet seen [77]. In other words, landscape constitutes a sort of crystallization of the conception of space as Nature (and Nature as space), as a domain exterior to discourse, to all discourse. It is useful here to go beyond Lacoste's statements: the "obstacle" absent from the space of the landscape is, primarily, the Other. With land? scape we pass from the first to the second characteristic of the Zionist vision, from the specifically spatial to the exclusively natural. The space of an ethnocentric discourse can be conceived only in a context where the Other does not appear ? in Nature. The positivist Zionist discourse must "clean" the site of the future society, must not see the Other. And, beyond any narrow context of propaganda, lies or hypocrisy, the Zionists will for a long time, purely and simply, not see the Arab Palestinians [78]. 2. From Space to Nature: The Palestinian Invisibility The facts are well-known: in the various reports Herzl made of his trip to Palestine, there is not a single mention of the Palestinian Arabs. But this is true not only of Herzl: "If you look at pre-war Zionist literature, you will find hardly a word about the Arabs," Haim Weizmann asserts in a discourse in 1931 [79]. Yet the majority of historians and researchers, having emphasized this aspect of early Zionist politics, fail to provide a coherent explanation for it. A good example is the remarkably titled chapter "The Unseen Question" in the previous? ly quoted work by Laqueur, in which he tries to show that the first Zionists had already recorded the fact of the Arab presence in Palestine, and that their only real problem was in dealing with this fact. It seems to me that such an explanation, aside from not explaining much (particularly the persistent innocence of the great majority of Zionists for at least three</page><page sequence="21">281 decades, until after the first World War), does not take into account the essential difference between perceiving the natives and being con? scious of the Other. The former perception appears quite early indeed, for example when Rabbi Kalisher writes in 1862 that Arab ban? ditry could possibly create a problem for the future Jewish colonists; the perception is, more? over, present in the writings of Herzl himself, well before his thoughts turned to Palestine: "An infiltration is bound to end badly. It con? tinues till the inevitable moment when the native population feels itself threatened, and forces the Government to stop a further influx of Jews" [80]. Still, considerations such as these relate to material contingencies but do not affect moral or political judgment whereas the recognition of the Other is at base consti? tutive of the subjective discourse. In this context, nothing is more instructive than the difference between Herzl's perception of the native Palestinians (certain late remarks in his diaries take them into account) and his impression of the young Egyptians during his trip to Cairo in 1902. The Egyptians, then unde: English domination, appeared to him as the "coming masters". And he adds in his diaries: "It is a wonder that the English don't see this. They think they are going to deal with Fellahin forever" [81]. Nothing of the sort appears in Herzl's remarks about the Palestinian Fellahin, to the limited extent that he notes their existence. He writes, still in his diaries [82], that "I resolve to think of the Fellahin too, once I am in power" and, according to Adolf Friedmann's biographical work Das Leben Theodor Herz Is [83], his retort to the sug? gestion that he purchase a great expanse of land in the Valley of Esdraelon, was "we can? not disinherit these poor Fellahin." What is perceived in Egypt as a strength, a value, a political meaning, falls to pieces in Palestine, pieces symbolizing the collective non-identity of what cannot be grasped as a mass except by accumulation. This vision refers, moreover, as much to the landowners as to the Fellahin [84]. To Prince Hohenlohe, Imperial Chancellor of Prussia, who asked Herzl who owned the lands he intended to purchase, he responded: "Oh, the whole mixed multitude of the Orient, Arabs, Greeks" [85]. The contrast between his perception of the Palestinians and his per? ception of the Egyptians clearly indicates the specific absence of the Other in the former. In the colonial vision of the time, natives do not form a discourse determining the landscape in question. And if Herzl perceives an identity among the Egyptians, it is because he does not visit Cairo as colonizer but rather as a subject of the good will of the veritable master, the English colonial Governor [86]. However, in Palestine Herzl's vision is colonial, even if his motivations are not. Palestine, the necessary space, will therefore be virginal and natural; there may be individuals or, rather, natives (as there are stones, trees), but not any specific social group. This is because the invisibility of the Other must be accounted for in the structures of the perceived spatial environment or, rather: the : vision of natural space, of landscape, is a cor? relative of the absence of otherness. So in the report of his trip to Palestine published in Die Welt (November 18, 1898), it is, significantly, in the specific context of the description of the natural environment that Herzl excludes any reference to a discourse other than that of the Jewish pioneer, present or future: In many respects things look sad but a magnificent sky smiles over the desolate, neglected places, and where human hands have been allowed to be active, an inexhaustible nature has cheerfully helped them to bring forth, as if by magic, a profusion of products. The results achieved by our settlers, particularly those who are standing on their own two feet, are nothing short of amazing. One can still see the surrounding rocky, parched area which one such stalwart fellow entered a few years ago - but he coaxed from that soil an orange grove or a lush vineyard [87]. And he stresses the absence of human presence, up until now, in this nature: "Everywhere nature and opportunities wait for helping human hands that can and will again create</page><page sequence="22">282 gardens there, places where people can live" [88], the whole being perfectly summarized in the article "Zionism," written in 1899: "At present the land is poor and neglected; the slopes of the hills are bare, the places with famous names are sad piles of debris and the fields lie fallow. The Holy Land is a wilderness. But there are oases ? our Jewish settlements!" [89]. There are many more relevant quotations but it is unnecessary to add them. What need be remembered is the close bond between the vision of Palestine as "wilderness" and the non vision of its inhabitants as a social entity. Another significant fact: this correlation be? tween the nature of space and the absence of the Other is not formed in, but rather condi? tions, the historical praxis. Palestine is con? sidered by the Zionist discourse as being a natural space devoid of otherness well before it is visited by the Zionists. This vision of dramed-of space has to be ascribed to concep? tual positivist discourse, not to historical experience. It would be tedious to cite in detail the mass of Zionist writings that confirm this important point; they range from works by Peretz Smolenskin [90] to Max Nordau [91] or Ben-Yehouda [92], as well as many others. The whole is summarized (in a tone already doubtful) by Haim Weizmann in 1914: In its initial stage, Zionism was conceived by its pioneers as a movement wholly depending on mechanical factors: there is a country which happens to be called Palestine, a country without a people, and, on the other hand, there exists the Jewish people, and it has no country [93]. But Weizmann commits a significant error: it is not the pioneers who think in this way, it is not they who "conceived of ' Zionism. This conception, that is, the "naturalization" of the dreamed-of space, its clearing of all Other dis? course, all of which is, surely, adopted and utilized by the pioneers, is nevertheless pro? duced by the discourse of (formerly) assimilated Jews. The nuance is important, even crucial, to comprehending the Israeli imagination. Indeed, the respective functions of the positivist discourse and of that, more tradi? tional, of the Russian Jews, are complementary but not identical. The positivist discourse clears the way by forming the dreamed-of and natural space, that is by emptying the territory of all troublesome presence. Seeing Palestine (since it will be Palestine that is at stake) is equivalent to seeing something other than the void: the blindness that characterizes Herzl's trip in 1898 cannot extend beyond a quick and personal visit. The pioneers themselves, the Jews that settle on the land, cannot fail to see something, even if they succeed in not seeing the Other. Better: it is precisely in order not to see the Palestinian that they are obliged to form a vision that conceals him. In short emptied of all otherness, the dreamed-of space is neces? sarily seen as Self. "If I wish to substitute a new building for an old one, I must demolish before I construct," Herzl writes in The Jewish State [94]. But each discourse has a specific calling, and Herzl's will be content to demolish; not only the old building of the Diaspora, as the Viennese Jew thought but, by a displacement at once rhetorical, political and geographical, the habitat of the Other, of the Palestinian. The building that will then be constructed on the apparently empty site will be the fact of another discourse, that of the pioneers coming, essen? tially, from the Russian Residence Zone. That these two Zionist discourses are not heteroge? neous must be stressed: the efficacy of the discourse of the Russian Jews springs from the smooth working of the Herzlian "demolition." But the Russian pioneers' vision differs from that of the assimilated or formerly assimilated Jews in that it is anchored in a well-defined space whose fundamental characteristic is enclosure, that is, a fixed form of autonomy: the ghetto, the small Jewish village (the shtetl). Assimilation itself, even when it is only partial, implies, on the contrary, the de-spatialization of identity, a process that corresponds to the integration of the individual Jew into the economic system ? an integration from which</page><page sequence="23">283 the Jewish merchants and artisans were excluded due to the nascent capitalism of 19th century Russia. In other words, if the Herzlian discourse is centered in a denial of the Other (understood here as the Other of the whole of western discourse, since there is no longer a specific Jewish discourse or, more exactly, since the latter is, to a great extent, integrated into the former), then the vision of the Jews from the zone persists in a re-constitution of the Self. Thus it is when Zionism ceases to be only a linguistic discourse and becomes social and economic praxis that one passes from Nature as absence (of the Other) to presence (of Self) as Nature. Of course it is not a simply chronological evolution that is at issue (although diachrony plays its role in emphasizing certain character? istics); the two sides, the two theoretical sec? tions of Zionism, condition one another. The Herzlian discourse epistemologically founds the praxis of the other discourse, and the latter gives to the former its historical dimensions. In fact, it is almost at the same moment that positivist Zionism realizes most concretely the exclusion of the Other from the "wilderness" that is Palestine, that a Jew from the zone articulates in a Tolstoyan language, the emer? gence of Self in the heart of this Nature. This was Gordon who wrote, in 1910 [95]: "And when, O Man, you will return to Nature ? on that day your eyes will open, you will gaze straight into the eyes of Nature, and in its Mirror you will see your own image." Gordon, a Russian Jew who emigrated to Palestine in 1904 expressed, more than anyone else ? as much through his writings as his life ? the pioneer vision of the first waves of Zionist socialist immigration, where natural space ful? fills the ideal conditions for the reunion of Self and Self, outside of all otherness. On this plane, Gordon's socialist and pacifist philosophy could only unite with its "naturism" at the cost of a marked blindness towards the non-Jewish inhabitants of Palestine. This is eloquently expressed through his definition of national identity: "There is a cosmic element in nationality which is its basic ingredient. That cosmic element may best be described as the blending of the natural landscape of the Home? land with the spirit of the people inhabiting it" [96]. Let us pause for a moment at these two quo? tations. They indicate the metamorphosis that will take place in the identity-space relation? ship with the development of Israeli society. Indeed, if Zionist space is hitherto a concept arising from the positivist need to resolve the problem of Jewish identity - with the materi? alization of this concept, with the advent of Israeli society comes an inversion that will place this identity in an increasingly dependent position vis-?-vis the space in which it appears. The point of contact between these two ap? parently ? superficially ? contradictory con? ceptions consists in the denial of the Other as constitutive of the subjective discourse; in other words, in the postulating of a Nature pre-existant to all discursiveness. It is through this concept of Nature that the "first" Zionism ? a positivist, humanistic discourse, the Zion? ism of the movement's founders ? will be transformed into a metaphysical, chauvinistic ideology. And this transformation is a correla? tive of the will to "create" an imaginary space in Palestine, because such a "creation" twice implies Nature: first, in order to exclude the Other from the referred-to domain; second, to qualify as natural, as naturally there, that which springs from elsewhere ? the Self. NOTES 1 It is in Argentina that Baron Maurice de Hirsch began the realization of his projects for Jewish colonization towards the end of the 19 th century. Later on* Herzl sees Argentina as a possible territory for his Jewish State. Uganda was seriously considered as a place of implantation by the Zionist Congress in 1904-05. In 1840, an anonymous treatise Neujudaa (The New Judea), published in Berlin, proposed Oregon as a setting for a new Jewish society. Other plans or even the beginnings of realizations span from Cayenne (1659) to Birobidjan (1928), passing through</page><page sequence="24">284 Grand Island, U.S.A. (1825), Syria (1839), Crimea (1841), etc. 2 Arthur Hertzberg (ed.), The Zionist Idea.

However, in conjunction with this he poses another possibility: Argentina. His reasons for finally preferring Palestine are essentially technical. 7 Theodor Herzl, The Jewish State, An Attempt at a modern solution of the Jewish Question (New York: American Zionist Emergency Council, 1946), p. 137. 8 Ibid., p. 82. 9 Ibid., p. 84 10 Ahad Ha'am, whose real name was Asher Zvi Ginsberg, was born in the Ukraine. He called for the creation of an essentially cultural and non-political center in Palestine. 11 Born in Budapest (like Herzl) and of German cultural background, Nordau had already established himself in Paris and acquired some literary notoriety when Herzl met him and converted him to the Zionist cause. 12 Walter Laqueur, A History of Zionism (New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1972), p. 133. 13 A small village or city where the majority (or a large part) of the population is Jewish. 14 Herzl, op. cit., 1946, p. 84. 15 Amos Elon, Herzl (New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1975), p. 387. 16 The Cours, as we know, was published by Saussure's students three years after his death. The lectures that form the (problematical) source of the book were given between 1906 and 1911. However, as the essential point (at least for our analysis) is in the social aspect of the publication, the structural revolution in linguistics, along with all that is considered part of it, including the relative silence with which it was received, must be dated from 1916. 17 Motivation from the point of view of the referent, of course. The arbitrariness of the sign-referent relationship does not imply the non-motivation of the sign within the language system itself. On the contrary, from a structural perspec? tive, it is the arbitrariness with regard to the referent that necessitates a motivation within the system. This is the meaning of Emile Benveniste's reading (in his article "Nature du signe linguistique," in Acta linguistica 1939, of the Saussurian notion of arbitrariness, restricting it to the sign-referent relationship and excluding it from the signifier-signified relationship. 18 Nineteenth century epistemology posits precisely such a Nature. And this conception continues even today, as Serge Moscovici pointed out in his Essai sur Thistoire humaine de la nature (particularly in the first part). The critique of the Saussurian sign, through its critique of its referent, refers ot the concept of Nature, of this Nature. 19 Of course, one may say that these conceptions are entirely outdated, as much for Time as for Space, not to mention "feelings," etc. The Saussurian revolution is part of a more general current where Freud joins Einstein, among others, in a radical inversion with regard to positivist thought. In this context, the privilege, the resistance of space, in Saussure's view is even more significant. Even if, especially if, this space is that referred to by the prevailing ideology. 20 See in particular Jacques Derrida, OF Grammatology (translated by Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak) (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1974). 21 Ibid, p. 20. 22 Ibid., p. 72. 23 Ibid, p. 86. 24 And is by this linked to one of the most important aspects of Ernst Cassirer's work, particularly his monumental Philosophy of Symbolic Forms. 25 We know that in the frequently obscure diversity of Charles Peirce's writings there are several definitions of the sign, not all of which agree. However, we can see in certain of them, if not an adequate reflection of "the" thought of Peirce - the logician's evolution was much too radical to be referred to in terms of a synchronic unity ? at least his most fecund contribution. In these terms, the quota? tion cited by Derrida is entirely valid. 26 Derrida, op. cit., p. 49. 27 Umberto Eco, La structure absente (Paris: Mercure de France, 1972), p. 66. 28 Derrida, op. cit., p. 49. 29 Ibid., p. 69. 30 Yves Lacoste, La geographic ca sert, d'abord, a faire la guerre (Paris: Maspero, 1976), pp. 45?46. 31 Ibid., p. 19. 32 Ibid, p. 95. 33 Pierre Francastel, Etudes de sociologie de Fart (Paris: Gonthier), p. 126. 34 Ibid., p. 26. 35 We know that Ptolemy (2nd century A.D.), in longitudinal? ly stretching the known world, gave it the narrow dimen? sions that would encourage Columbus and others to believe that one could easily enough reach Asia from the East. 36 Francastel, op cit., p. 216. 37 Ibid, pp. 73-74. 38 Ibid, p. 82. 39 An analysis which, of course, must be read in its totality; Pierre Francastel's splendid work extends far beyond the limited framework of our perspective. 40 Francastel, op. cit, pp. 81-82. 41 Ibid, p. 82. 42 Erwin Panofsky, Gothic Architecture and Scholasticism (New York: Meridian Books, 1957). 43 Ibid, pp. 59-60. 44 We know that Francastel clearly separated from the "ontologism," that for him characterized Panofsky's research, such a conception granting a relatively autonomous existence to the structure of the universe in relation to the various systems of representation that refer to it. 45 R.

So it is not coinci? dental that a thesis like Laocoon would appear at this time: in Lessing as in Saussure, the opposition between plastic representation (juxtaposition) and verbal expression (succession) rests on the expulsion of the graph from language. 59 Francastel, op. cit, p. 184. 60 See his lecture titled "Feudalism" in Theodor Herzl, Zionist Writings, (translated by Harry Zohn) (New York, Herzl Press, 1973), pp. 44-58. 61 "No one can doubt that the 15th century was an age of creative battle in the domain of myths as in that of geometry," Francastel, op. cit, p. 179. 62 For instance, the idea that Christopher Columbus was Jewish. 63 Previously there had been other, religious ones, based on the identification of their initiator with the Messiah. 64 Like the movement of the Jewish Enlightenment, the "Haskala". 65 Of course, one may say that socialism never claimed to erase cultural differences. It is precisely here that a meaningful blank appears concerning Jewish identity, one that is rarely perceived as such. 66 Biro-bidjan is not a denial of this affirmation, but a variant on it: Stalin's attempt to regroup the Jewish people in this territory must not (at least in my opinion) be understood as the establishment of a spatial framework for the blossoming of Jewish identity, but rather as aiming at disintegrating the spatial universe (the Dispersion) where the identity (in its specificity) yet remained. Of course, in a way, certain aspects of this experience converge with the Zionist conception of the problem, if not the solution. 67 Herzl, op. cit., 1946. 68 Herzl, op. cit., 1973, p. 48. 69 Ibid, p. 50. 70 Herzl, op. cit., 1973. 71 Herzl, op. cit, 1946, p. 96. 72 Ibid, p. 102. 73 Which provokes a surprising remark from Walter Laqueur, op. cit., 1972, p. 114. 74 Elon, op. cit., p. 158. 75 Ibid, p. 257. 76 Francastel, op. cit, p. 123. 77 Yves Lacoste, "A quoi sert le paysage," in Herodote No. 7 (Paris: Maspero, 1977), pp. 35?36. 78 What RJ.

"Moral myopia," "unseen question," (the title of his analysis of the chapter of Walter Laqueur's History of Zionism devoted to the Arab problem) the problem of the Palestinian Other is largely situated in a visual context. And this is much more than a mere rhetorical device. 79 Judische Rundschau (a German Zionist journal), November 27, 1931, cited by Walter Laqueur, op. cit., p. 236. 80 Herzl, op. cit., 1946, p. 104. 81 Quoted by Laqueur, op. cit., p. 143. 82 Elon, op. cit., p. 369. 83 Ibid., p. 376. 84 Which is perfectly reflected in the charitable thoughts he expresses for the Fellahin in the Valley of Esdraelon. Charitable but absurd: as the Fellahin own no land they cannot be dispossessed. Herzl did not know this, not seeing with whom he was dealing. 85 Elon, op. cit., p. 278. 86 Along the geographic path covered by the "unspecified" territory of Zionist space, Herzl came to weigh the pos? sibility of establishing it at El-Arish. From this came the fruitless visit to Lord Cramer, who had to decide about it. 87 Herzl, op. cit, 1973, p. 33. 88 Ibid., p. 35. 89 Ibid., p. 120. 90 Smoleskin, in his article "Let Us Search Our Ways," in Hertzberg, op. cit., curiously speaks of sand, which could be used to develop glassworks, as one reason for choosing Palestine as the territory for the Jews. The absurdity of such an argument reveals the vision which it articulates. 91 Who writes in the article "Zionism" in 1902; in Hertzberg, op. cit, p. 245): "(the Zionists) desire to irrigate with their sweat and to till with their hands a country that is today a desert." 92 "Let us increase the number of Jews in our desolate land . .. The land of our fathers is waiting for us; let us colonize it."
