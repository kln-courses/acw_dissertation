<plain_text><page sequence="1">American Rema rks BY WILLIAM HARMON hhe earth's surface, taken as culture, has the two poles, two opposite "centers." Mediterranean might be center of the earth. And China always expresses itself as a center: Chung Hua Min Kuo, they used to say. Chung is centr, and it is with reference to this mid- dle that other countries in Asia understand their own geography. ITese poles, West and East, self-conscious and self-proclaimed foci, determine the axis of civilization and individual awareness. America is between. On the globe of culture it is equatorial. It is ambiguous and ill-named; it is Eurasian, Europe on its way to Asia for metals and peppers, an accidental and unexpected continent of miscalled "Indians." The problem for a poet is to strike through the misnomers and ambiguities to find a basis for a national-historical poem. The bulk of language is in the public domain, and the poet who would register the experiences of his general language-sharing brotherhood is him- self a pole of sorts, a center, voice, eye, a noon and a now, levering some- thing else, something not himself, into being, recording the fact and feeling 425 The Antioch Review</page><page sequence="2">of the past so that it might endure. The poet needs to gather the experience into himself as a middleman between the group on the one hand and the language on the other, connecting them by means of his mediating voice. If no other distinct landscape and language are available to him, and if he will still write on a national-historical scale, then, I think, his very body will have to be the country and the song. America lacks the homogeneity needed to realize the UNUM of the official motto. There is a double helping of the pluribus, but what quality of America can really be called uniquely and uniformly American? The place doesn't even have a name. It's just "The States" (a situation signifi- candy analogous to the situation of having poems called just "cantos" or "quartets"). The United States is not a nation, a language, a fatherland, or a religion. (In A Piece of My Mind, Edmund Wilson says, "The United States is not a nation in the sense that England or France is. It is a society, a political system, which is still in a somewhat experimental state.") It is of course not a Volk, a "people" or a "nation" in the coarse ethnic sense; it is obviously not unique in its language; by law, it is not religiously concen- trated. It is not, moreover, a settled political whole-so much so that we hardly have a native word for that concept. Fatherlnd will never do. Ezra Pound is driven, like Whitman, outside English: one book of his dreams has to be called Patria Mia, and as recently as Canto CXV he has to say, referring to America, "in meiner Heimat.' (In 1924 he characterized Joyce and himself as citizens of the Heimatlos.) If America is not a nation, a lan- guage, a religion, or a fatherland, is it any one thing at all? SPACED An American can say "my country" and "my land," so that it seems to me that America, as a unique and uniform shaping principle for poetry, is this alone: a country. I mean territory, land, real estate, earth, soil, dirt. More or less arbitrarily and flexibly laid out and filled up (by about I890, accord- ing to F. J. Turner and the Census Bureau), the country invites, again and again, metaphors of spatial emphasis, as when Charles Olson says, in Call Me Ishmael, "I take SPACE to be the central fact to man born in America. . . . It is geography at bottom, a hell of wide land from the beginning." One of Gertrude Stein's ruling preoccupations was American geogra- phy, the physical fact. Her writings are as repetitive as an atlas, and as local and as visual. American space dominates The Making of Americans, Geography and Plays, The Geographical History of America, and, most vividly, the Grant section of Four in America: our religion is what it is, unmoderated and stubborn, simply because "America has no sky." Much the same phenomenon was seen in New York by Sartre, who decocted that urban landscape: "I learned to like New York's sky. In European cities where roofs are low, the sky crawls close to the earth and seems tamed. The New York sky is beautiful because the skyscrapers push it back, very far 426 Fall/ Winter 1970-71</page><page sequence="3">over our heads. Pure and lonely as a wild beast, it guards and watches over the city. And it is not only a local protection; one feels that it stretches out into the distance over all America; it is the whole world's sky." Somewhere here, furthermore, one could probably locate also Lawrences "Spirit of Place," that sense of naked, masterless man in America, bloated by the decreased pressure, the disciplining lid blown sky high. It is hard to say precisely how this sort of landscape feeling could be displayed and verified on a graph, but it seems to be there, plain as day, registered in one way or another, mysterbously but unmistakably in our great poems-those prefaces (what Lawrence called "false dawn"), undone edifices, something (a man?) against the sky. It's the only limit. Pound's use of Patria and Heimat is a token of the poet's predicament when he goes looking for a language for ambiguous America (patriam quam odi et amo, Pound said in I9o9). Poets seem to knock together a shebang of language, a makeshift and perilously ramshackle lean-to that's hard to admire unless for its surprising hardihood, more tent than temple, more coat than tent, more an extra layer of illustrated skin than anything. If a tent, then it is perhaps like an ample bigtop that can be knocked down and dragged out, packed up and moved away on short notice. Even the language itself is essentially nameless, and such Volapiukist contraptions as Amerind and Usonian never catch on. No: we are Americans simply be- cause we squat on the fat fact of this generous acreage, and by that fiat (and fait) we get our sanction as citizens. MANIFESTATIONS The poet's problem shakes down to something like this: the landscape here will go into the language here only when the two are identified in a fusion, often even a confusion, an equation of landscape and language. The struggle to accomplish this identity appropriates, for its flux (in the welder's sense) certain mythopoeic tactics from Western and Eastern art. What our poems toss up is an iconography of our approximations of religion or daimonic magic, rebates from overpaid accounts, African and European memories Indianized so they can breathe the new air. The manifestations started in the i850s. I851: Moby Dick, that easygoing-desperate pull away from land, first south and then east, east and farther east, escape and return, farewell and hail, after the whale of a country (is Moby a place?)-whiteness one thing, whaleness another, the opposite, allegorical symbols cut and denied with a wisecrack, all spun and conjoined in the one yarn, a total novel. (Melville's own voyage in the whaler Acushnet went west around Cape Horn.) I855: Song of Hiawatha, a flop, to be sure, but maybe a poem finer than we shall ever be ablc to know, our ears having been desensitized by metronomic renditions from sophomoric tenth-grade teachers, an idiot's prosody not necessarily inherent in the poem itself. Longfellow was no fool, though, nor was he deaf to quite all the facts and nuances of speech; surcly Country, Body, Song: American Remarks 427 The Antioch Review</page><page sequence="4">he would not have countenanced "daughter OF the arrow-maker." And nothing else about the poem is patendy ridiculous. (Ideal and error get so raddled, however, that the line "daughter of the moon" in Gary Snyder's "Foxtail Pine" invites the same big thump oin the OF.) Longfellow's Song is in twenty-two rather short cantos, each of which takes up a particular American problem; there is even one canto about idcograms. He was an importer who tried, with not much durable success, to fit American na- tional-historical forms onto European hardware: undulating hexameter for Evangeline and The Courtship, Finnish meter for Hiawuatha. Finnish meter to write a poem about American Indians? Maybe he did it because he thought both the Finns and the Indians were Oriental, two notions of speculative anthropology whose coupling begot this diffusionist monster. Right between the eyes he smote him. Trochaic tetrameter will never work again. (Somebody after Longfellow tried it on some Nahuad poems, with hideous results. The format is now permanently unemployed except for odd jobs and light work in parody, ioo per cent disabled, out to pasture but not to stud. Speaking of Nahuatl, inc- dentally, I believe that there were some beautiful translations of Aztec poems done in free verse eighty years ago by an "Americanist" named D. G. Brinton, who ought to get more attention.) And I855 again, on the Fourth of July itself: also a "song of-," the loudest answer and the strongest, the wackiest and most unassimilable, out of the one great recurnng lung, Leaves of Grass scarcely a title, the whole works hardly a poem. H6las. Whitman is four- or maybe even five-fifths sheer fudge, disorderly and disordered, a furnace half flame and half clinkers, something of an embarrassment to us all, hard reading and a poem virtually impossible to promote a liking for, but, at last and in sum, the man, if thaes what he was, the American man. (Yeats said that a country gets an anti-self for a national poet. How, say, sober Scodand is attracted to un-sober Burns. Whitman is America turned inside-out, maybe.) Whitman. If he had not existed, would it really be necessary to invent him? He had a disease whose victim feels too good all the time. He is the dark side of the tall tale, Paul Bunyan bull. The poems, the poem-what- the-hell-ever it is-yields so little of value to any ordinary kind of reasoned systematic analysis. This is an allegory, this a dramatic monologue, this a pastoral elegy, this a tragedy, this bird-star-sprig a symbol of.... The instru- ments of orderly understanding, even when adjusted for extremes like Smart and Blake, simply go haywire. A technician would say that Whitman "pegs the meter," goes off the scale. Lawrence was correct: the radical American art form is the lie, the writers all "hopeless liars.' I was born about ten thousand years ago, There ain't nothing in the world that I don't know. 428 FaIl/ Winter 1970-71</page><page sequence="5">This trait, this fabulating, this lying not like truth but like the worst lying, belongs not only to the national-historical poets of whom I speak but also to the more personal-psychological writers like Poe and Dickinson. A great lie is best told with a straight face and all the circumstantial trivia of anecdote-journalistic fact if not outright gospel truth, a diary if not a novel, an unadorned yarn. Sailors still tell these tales, lies known generically as "sea stories." Fairy tales all start out "Once upon a time"; sailors will tell you that sea stories all start out "Now this is no shit." In our Navy today there are dozens of stories about USS PAUL BUNYAN, whose captain (a six-star admiral) uses a Cleveland-class cruiser as his personal gig. Ohthere told his lord, the King Alfred, that he, in a party of six, slew sixty whales in two days. One axis of Pynchon's V is just such a sea story- explicitly aboard a Navy ship or implicitly on an alligator hunt through the sewers of New York. Melville breaks out his "Affidavit," a matter of being both baptized and notarized: "I have personally known three instances where a whale... ." The idea-the pill against fear and lonesomeness-is to tell a huger lie than the next boatswain's mate. How vain it is to seek "structure" in Leaves of Grass, a principle of unity and harmony. Malcolm Cowley is to be applauded for bringing out a version of the original edition; but no thanks are due to him (or to Carl Strauch and James Miller, whom he cites) for attempting to detect the determining pattern. Cowley adduces a redoubtable bushel of those habit- forming cashews from the inscrutable East: bhakti-marga ("path of devo- tion"), but Walt, whose poem has about as much logical and metaphysical unity as a jukebox, is long gone. The sharpest hatchet is dull against the jungle of provenance. Let bibliographers toil from now until the roll is called up yonder, tracing a phrase that submerges oddly at point X in Leaves of Grass and surfaces, as suddenly, somehow at point Y, grinning, perfectly at home, a Corrigan, splendid and foolish and actual. The road to Xanadu is a treadmill. The gross manifold array of stuff disappears into one end (or beginning) of the good black box of genius and the net product of poetry emerges from the other end (beginning). The insides of the box are ineluctably complicated, and no one can figure out the inner process simply by comparing the imagined raw material and the imagined finished work. The real raw material never is essentially a reading list, and, in fact, the end product is not a finished and bounded detached product with a material objective con- crete external analyzable existence, reality, quiddity. THE TRUE AMERICAN BOOKMAKER The true American poet is a one-man minstrel show, con artist-a book- maker not because he makes books but because he makes book, a book that is, ultimately, the formula with these terms: The body is the country and the poem. Metaphor has a syntax of its own. Body: country: poem. Plus, in flux, Country, Body, Song: American Remarks 429 The Anfioch Review</page><page sequence="6">the permutations: the country is the body and the poem; and the poem is the country and the body. Plus, again, certain corollaries and consequences, for fusion is a theme and also a technique, and by a refolding of a like process of even further fusion the theme is the technique. The poet is the poem, the poem is the country, and the country is the poet. The country is construed as the landscape of the poem and its audience too. The country is more than alive, it is human; and not simply human but a maker of poems out of its own dirt and water. Ordinarily the collapsing, simplifying equation of country and body and poem is accomplished by the employment of some medium, a mediating solvent, a catalyst, a flux, a harmonizing middle and idiom, a force that can serve as matter and format. Any metaphor of mixture or fusion might do: dissolving water, merging love, family kinship, the image of the root or loom, anything in fact would work as its lexis and syntaxis register and exemplify the sense of union. Song of Hiawatha, Song of Myself, The Cantos, Harmonium, Four Quartets: these tides (for title is the starting metaphor) say that music would do. I mean, now, music as a figure, a concept. Music proper, as far as America is concerned, is almost exclusively in the dirty hands of men like Foster, Sousa, Gershwin, or Roger Miller. The "serious" music, Ives for instance, seems to dwindle into derivative or mechanical trifling in propor- tion as it is removed from the arena of the vulgate. Take away the waltzes, college songs, hymns, marches, and jingo-jingles, and all that's left in Ives is (to my ears) pretty tepid extract of Sibelius. For the business of poetry, however, the figure of music suffices. Poem and poet and country-worker, work, and audience-are joined in the grand harmonizing metaphor that makes all lesser metaphors and sub- ordinate aesthetic fictions (like plot and thought and character) redundant. The real poem, "as in itself it really is," located in the matrix of the con- trolling and containing metaphor, then consists chiefly of factual accounts, ledger after ledger full of objective clerkly catalogues of actuality rendered down into musical numbers performed by some voice or instrument. Whit- man, ostensibly a deeply personal poet, speaks for the Mass and the Land and the War, none of which he knew directly in his role of Walter W. He did this simply by making the audacious but brilliant identification-via music-of himself with the country. He heard himself mumbling and called it "America singing." The second-line similes, such as they are, seem always to be related to the incarnation of something mechanical or abstract. "The carpenter dresses his plank, the tongue of his foreplane whistles its wild ascending lisp": here the figure serves to make the tool into something human. And in "Spon- taneous Me" the poem itself undergoes a change even more radical than a simple anthropomorphic metaphor: it is fleshed out, made into a penis: 430 Fall1 Winter 1970-71</page><page sequence="7">The real poems, (what we call poems being merely pictures,) The poems of the privacy of the night, and of men like me, This poem drooping shy and unseen that I always carry, and that all men carry .. . (This work was originally called "Bunch Poem," and Whitman evidently considered deleting the last line.) Mythopoeia is unmanageable and all but impossible to describe. The paysage is moralisc, but the process has a perilous fluidity. The flexible con- cept seems beyond measurement, off the scale, and I ought to be ashamed of myself for sounding so romantic-nationalistic (a label applied with full justice by Rene Wellek to Roy Harvey Pearce), for noodling so in the twi- light of incurably subjective impressionism. This aesthetic is Heraclitean and Heisenbergian, and I measure position only by sacrificing measure of velocity. But examine the specimens, because I think they show that other approaches to our national-historical poetry are ways of reduction or exclusion. Any of a number of difficulties can arrest artists in time and fix them, freeze-dried, as either permanent children or premature presbyters, in either case deaf to music but, as compensation, more alert to static-plastic arts. I may be perverting an idea that Wyndham Lewis applied to Gertrude Stein (and better applied to Ruskin), but I agree that her confessed indifference to music, once she had passed her teens, is what lames her art-that deafness and a lack of the touch of vulgarity, common human humor (I am relying on the account in A Moveable Feast). But space and time are not at war, no matter how beguiling the game of playing with them might get, and it is, finally, an empty metaphor to talk, as Joseph Frank did, of "spatial" form in literature, or, as Norman Mailer once did, of abolishing time so as to order chaos. Even Lessing knew that all works of art exist in both space and time insofar as they have a physical existence at all. (Spengler's distinction between ornament and imitation more fruitfully divides space from time.) We are as sensitive and defensive as West Virginians: we have to say Walt by God Whitman and wait for the fight to break out. Flesh equals grass, let us say, and this is the way the flesh-poem in the grass-book looks-all tendrilly, lobed like a bladder, bulby-pulpy, moist, warm, dark, sticky, drooping, an affront to prudence and modesty. (Why does the stomach turn at the sight of a stomach?) I suppose lonely ladies read Whitman for sex thrills. Or lonely gentlemen. Qua pornography, that soft and sloping underbelly of literature, it's typical, not such a hot book after all, not even as stimulating as Clarissa. Solomon's Song of the world's body and soul, "Limitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous, quivering jelly of love, white-blow and delirious juice"; don't forget that "semitic" muscle, or "hip-strength, inward and outward round, man-balls, man- root"-probably some of the first Whitman anybody reads, in the eighth grade, say. Country, Body, Song: American Remarks 431 The Antioch Review</page><page sequence="8">It's good to remember, as a fiction of approach at any rate, that Whit- man's work (as Richard Chase says), like Whitman himself, has a comic human side. One of Jonathan Williams' poems gives a rundown of Whit- man's ailments-pleurisy, tuberculosis, parenchymatous nephritis, gallstone, pachymeningitis-and concludes, a little too nominalistically, "That he was a Kosmos is a piece of news we were hardly prepared for." (Have you taken a look at the Kosmos lately?) One could say, though, "What a wound! What a bow!" The totality of the art had to be taken to ludicrous-seeming extremes, as Walter-Philoctetes was probably aware, so that to demytholo- gize is not just easy but, now and again, necessary, to keep us from wor- shipping Parrington's ugly hero. THE GREAT TRADITION The continuity of the mythopoeic fusion of poem, body, and country can be followed through Whitman's successors down to today, and for a good deal of this material all you need to start with is The Oxford Book of American Verse. F. 0. Matthiessen's anthology (1950) gave us a chance to verify the tradition. The book reminds us that Aiken, Jeffers, Ben&amp;t, Robin- son, and Masters filled many volumes with visions and beseechments of other sorts; and that MacLeish's pursuit of mythopoeia, like Hart Crane's, was too derivative, too dependent on overpaid European formats, carried out with immediate resources altogether too meagre. But all of "Song of Myself" and all of "Tle Comedian as the Letter C" demonstrate, as does "The Dry Salvages," the strength and durability of what must be the central image-complex of the greatest tradition in American national-historical poetry. Emerson, though at his worst a tissue of sentimental and superstitious platitudes, is probably closer to one's ordinary idea of what an extraordinary man ought to be, and in our squarer moments we are likely to wish that Whitman had been more like him-more like ourselves. (Anti-self, like a mirror-image or plaster-cast, is backwards.) But Emerson had not the lung or continental tongue. He did write, in 1844, what plainly amounts to the recipe for Leaves of Grass: Our log-rolling, our stumps and their politics, our fisheries, our Negroes, and Indians, our boats, and our repudiations, the wath of rogues, and the pusillanimity of honest men, the northern trade, the southern planting, the western clearing, Oregon, and Texas, are yet unsung. Yet America is a poem in our eyes; its ample geography daz- zles the imagination, and it uwll not wait long for meters. Eleven years later, Emerson had the wit and wisdom to take off his hat to Leaves of Grass, and Whitman-as much American Adman as American Adam-swiped the hat for publicity purposes, flack of himself. In the I855 Preface, Whitman repeated the first formula: "The United States them- selves are essentially the greatest poem." Then in "So Long!" (i86o) he added the next elaboration: 432 Foll/ Winter 1970-71</page><page sequence="9">Camerado, this is no book, Who touches this touches a man.... Country equals poem, poem equals poet; it only remained for Pound to say of Whitman in I909 that poet equals country ("He is America") to com- plete the ring of identities. "Melville is a great poet only in the prose of Moby Dick," said Randall Jarrell with some justice. Melville stuffed everything into that one enormous and abnormal shebang and nightmare and billboard and crazyquilt; he experimented with the machinery, tried to reverse the wiring and run the thing backwards, back, as I have said, toward the east (though maybe John Huston put too fine a point on Melville's meaning by bringing Gregory "Ahab" Peck and his whale together at Bikini). Moby Dick the human whale takes its place alongside Leaves of Grass the human vegetable. Clarel? A classic of our prose, no better and no worse than Longfellow's novel Kavanagh (see Chapter XX thereof for an I849 answer to Emerson's I844 question). Moby Dick, full of blank verse ("I'd strike the sun if it insulted me"), is superior to Clarel even in music and meter. What is not blank verse is coarse newspaper prose, as though ill- fashioned facts could set off the apocalyptic extravagance of the expert's nar- rative, a homely handmade spool for the unanswerable yarn. There is an insistent chorus of "Don't bullshit me" in The Pisan Cantos, and this Ameri- can habit of superficially (or ostensibly) shunning outright fiction may be what uglifies some styles and goads some of the most gifted writers around nowadays out of poetry into prose fiction and from there into reportage. We should, I suppose, be grateful for the excellent journalism that we have with us always, never more than this minute. I hope our events-our stumps and their politics, and all the rest of the dirt of history-are worthy of the good writing lavished on them by Mailer, Baldwin, McPhee, Styron, Plimpton, Updike, Barthelme, and Leroi Jones. PLUS FOUR Let us return to the living landscape, the poem-poet-country in one. "The master-songs are ended," Robinson said (prosaically) when Whitman (whom Crane later called "Our Meistersinger") passed into the atmosphere and his familiar lines became, as Longfellow said of Dante's, the "footpaths for the thought" of Americans. It seems now that both Robinson and Crane misunderstood the fundamental burden of the "song" and came to grief in the laming net of regulated systematic un-American formats of myth and versicle. But there were four stronger voices-Stevens, Williams, Pound, and Eliot-and right now there are two beacons, Ginsberg and Snyder, to maintain the realization of Whitman's formula. Stevens offers, needless to say, fewer superficial resemblances to Whit- man than do such writers as Masters and Sandburg, but the physical pres- ence of Whitman can often be felt there in the poems, where the excited Country, Body, Song: American Remarks 433 The Antioch Review</page><page sequence="10">vocabulary is forever reaching under and beyond common speech. The comically mixed provenance of the Franco-Italian macaronic "douce cam- pagna" in Stevens' "Well Dressed Man with a Beard" attaches that poem to both Longfellow and Whitman. But the legacy of mythopoeia that I am tracing, as hypothesis, is most pronounced in "The Comedian as the Let- ter C." The alphabet composes the poems, and each poet, unless illiterate, is an abecedarian. C is see and sea and si and ci. It suggests Christopher Co- lumbus, Charlie Chaplin, Calvin Coolidge. It is the hook-shaped progress of exploration and exploitation from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean to New England. It is central, neutral key in music, natural (without "acci- dentals"), the middle note, the key signature sharpless and flatless, the ground and reference, what Abt Vogler called "the C Major of this life," the key in which Mencken wrote his "little book." In "Not Ideas about the Thing but the Thing Itself" Stevens describes a scrawny cry as a "chorister whose c preceded the choir." The title, seemingly inexhaustible in its sug- gestiveness, may in the end be a vacant cipher. It vibrates too much, perhaps, and shakes itself to pieces-letters adrift, floating loose in soup. But the poem remains intensely American (Matthiessen had a genius for picking poems that were at once most characteristic of a particular poet and most American as well) in the sense that it is local, timeless, geographical, na- tional-historical, and mythopoeic. It follows, across the world's body, the course of the creation of European America and simultaneously (dense poem) the creation of the individual American American's American con- sciousness, framed by the reversible and interchangeable terms of the poem- body-country motto: "Man is the intelligence of his soil" and "His soil is man's intelligence." Among the ancient and modern languages of Europe the poet-colonizer Crispin assumes a continental body that breeds daughters on the female body of the land. How far are those "Daughters with Curls" from "The Children's Hour," how far is the "Nice Shady Home" from Craigie House? Folded and re-folded, our metaphors hold such a history of self-con- sciousness. They are wanting in objective proof to please contemporary his- torians, perhaps, and F. J. Turner, like D. G. Brinton, is so discounted as a social scientist that he may survive exclusively as one of our minor prose- poets. In any event-like the idea traced by Borges dreamily back to Bona- venture's calling the world something quasi quidam Ziber-he experienced and expressed the country's body as a great book: "The United States lies like a huge page in the history of society. Line by line as we read this con- tinental page from West to East [hysteron proteron] we find-" but never mind what we find; the point is that who touches America touches a human body that keeps metamorphosing itself into a poem. (G. W. Pierson is certainly correct in faulting Turner for his romantic ignorance of statistics and better-documented examinations-less parochial, more ecumenical-of mysterious social and historical phenomena. He is also 434 Fall/ Winter 1970-71</page><page sequence="11">correct in saying that "the very language of his essays in dealing with this subject took on a warm and almost lyric quality, .. . he sang the epic of the 'imperial domain.' ") Paterson adds two elements to Whitman's mythic equation. (i) The body of man is the body of a city named for a man. (Human landscape is old, of course, and Finnegans Wake displays such paradigms in all moods and tenses.) As epigraph for Book III of Paterson, Williams uses a passage from Santayana's Last Puritan: "Cities, for Oliver, were not a part of nature. He could hardly feel, he could hardly admit even when it was pointed out to him, that cities are a second body for the human mind, a second organ- ism... ." (2) The body of man is radically differentiated from woman's. Williams' sensitivity to womanhood is the most acute and most eloquent in our poetry, I think, a poetry lacking, on the whole, such awareness (unless you count The Courtship of Miles Standish). Perhaps the lesbians in a mock-pastoral part of Paterson are an echo of the exaggerated mating cry of Whitman, our old homosexual moose and megaphone. Geography finally dissolves down into humus, the ground of humility. Spirits of place and humility are not particularly conspicuous in the first seventy-one Cantos, even though Pound once released an awkward com- munique announcing a reconciliation (first a truce, later a pact) with Whitman. The first strophe of "Beatl Beatl Drumsl" contributes a half-line to Canto IV; Whitman said, "Beat, beat . . . whirr . . . pound," and Pound changed the last word (modestly?) to "thud." The end of Canto XIII ("The blossoms of the apricot / blow from the east to the west") may owe something to "Sea-winds blown from east and west" in the tenth strophe of "When Lilacs Last." But Whitman's general mythopoeic sense of the earth is absent until The Pisan Cantos. Earlier Cantos have dealt with places, but in the Pisan group, as never before, the poems are fixed in a present place in present time, and the title identifies the place precisely. (Byron, incidentally, also wrote some Pisan cantos: VI-VITI of Don Juan-a poem that has a few other things in com- mon with Pound's.) The poet, who has heretofore thought of cultural his- tory chiefly in terms of volitional intelligence informing factive political programs, is suddenly and violently grounded, earthed, pushed in to the mud, fixed in an urnoving locus on the soil, in sight of a leaning tower. With his eye shoved so close to the chthonic humus, Pound delivers, in poetry of breathtaking clarity and freshness, descriptions of leaves of grass unprecedented in our literature. His new-found sympathy embraces butter- flies, lizards, grasshoppers, wasps, stray cats, and convicts, and he sees him- self as "the lone ant from the broken ant-hill of Europe." He grows into (kbt cin in the literal sense of a figure Frobenius used in his Paideuma) the local landscape, which, in turn, takes on human features (mountains as breasts, air as breath). "Brother Wasp" suggests, to be sure, nothing more mythopoeic than Joel Chandler Harris; but there is also the brilliant clarity of vision and compassion found in Whitman's praise of animals. The image- Country, Body, Song: American Remarks 435 The Antioch Review</page><page sequence="12">complex in Canto LXXXII includes mud and connubium terrae (con- nubium meaning both "wedding" and "sexual intercourse"). Here, imme- diately after a recollection of the status of Whitman's reputation at the turn of the century (in a letter dated I3 October 19I3 he told Harriet Monroe, "The 'Yawp' is respected from Denmark to Bengal, but we can't stop with the 'Yawp.' ") and a slightly amended quotation from "Out of the Cradle," Pound apostrophizes the spirit of the living earth: How drawn, 0 GEA TERRA, what draws as thou drawest till one sink into thee by an arm's width embracing thee. Drawest, truly thou drawest. Wisdom lies next thee, simply, past metaphor. Four Quartets are musical poems with landscape titles. "The Dry Sal- vages," the one carried in The Oxford Book of American Verse, is the peculiarly American quartet, the one American land- and sea-scape among the British. The title itself casts an image of the humanized landscape: "a small group of rocks" called (with concentric halos of meaning) The Dry Salvages-"presumably les trois sauvages." The living continent recalls Turner's homely anatomization: "Civilization in America has followed the arteries made by geology; . . . it is like the steady growth of a complex nervous system for the originally simple, inert continent." By the act of naming, rocks are transformed into trois sauvages and then, by a complex of puns characteristic of Anglicized French (consider the flowering of "Rue du Roi" into "Rotten Row" in London), dry salvages emerge. In the poem, the very continent seems to speak of its own body: "The river is within us, the sea is all about us." The publication of Eliot papers will reveal earlier treatments of the Cape Ann setting (rejected by Eliot or Pound for use in The Waste Land), but "The Dry Salvages" by itself offers a new orchestra- tion of the meaning of the body of America from the viewpoint of one of our self-exiled poets. It affords a continental page and voice, a new passage to India (the India of Krishna) not otherwise available, and, at the end, a calling-forth, in terms very like those of Stevens' comedian, of "the life of significant soil." TENACIOUS, UBIQUITOUS, PERVASIVE Whitman, similarly, once within us and now all about us (having become his admirers and detractors alike), is one of the chemicals with which our drinking water is salted. Leslie Fiedler has alluded to his presence in the work of Creeley (where it is muted to the point of parody); almost any- where you look-Louis Simpson, Nelson Algren, Lou Lipsitz-Whitman is there. Since the American testaments published by Eliot, Pound, and Wil- liams in the I940s (and perhaps that by Neruda in I950), I think we have 436 Foll/ Winter 1970-71</page><page sequence="13">been witnesses to a continued and ever clearer realization of Whitman's central dream, a more and more physical literalization of his imaginings. This phenomenon is unmistakable in Ginsberg, who obviously and explicitly and ubiquitously harks back to Whitman (who had noted, "What living and buried speech is always vibrating here, what howls restrain'd by deco- rum") much as Whitman had harked back to Emerson (who had said, "The poet knows that he speaks adequately ... only when he speaks some- what wildly," and had, on that account, excused bards' love for "wine, mead, narcotics, coffee, tea, opium, the fumes of sandalwood and tobacco, or whatever other procurers of animal exhilaration"). Allen Ginsberg liter- ally unscrews the doors, makes a literal passage to India (and more than India), and runs into a literal Whitman-"dear father, graybeard, lonely old courage-teacher"-in a California supermarket. (Some rather dry dust was raised in I96I when James Dickey put Ginsberg down in the Times Book Review and certain letters to the editor said that people had said the same thing about Whitman; plagues on both those houses.) Gary Snyder, like Ginsberg in his literalization of Whitman's myth, used to speak in a similar voice, but, at least ostensibly, the voice was more disciplined, more intelligent, more eloquent, and more factual, I think, than any American poet younger than Pound. His earlier poems spoke in an extraordinarily clear voice the evocations and indictments of what America was for the Indians, what it is today, and what it is in danger of turning into. He is a religious poet, mystic and visionary at times, but simultane- ously, as much as Williams and Pound, a factual poet, faithful to the smells and realities of external things, processes, and habits. He has even made a fine poem out of recipe for stew. Lately, as his concentration has been widened to include the whole ecumene of the "Earth House Hold," his power seems to be diminishing. Regarding Wave is a good book, but not much in it can match Myths and Texts. Out of a somewhat earlier generation, only Robert Lowell has managed to keep his purchase on local events. Finally, in Notebook: 1967-68, he has realized in powerful images and phrases the fusion of his personal pain with cognate pains in the body politic-an accomplishment not approached by parallel efforts by Dickey and Berryman, who, however witty and moral and versatile, have nothing like Lowell's intensity and discipline. Roethke also worked in this personal-public juggling act, but (unless maybe in some parts of "North Amenrcan Sequence") he never got it down on paper. A further corollary: If the main tradition in American national-histori- cal poetry since the I85os has set forth an energy-releasing fusion of the fig- ures of poet, poem, and country, then it is quite within the logic of the metaphor's universe that, sooner or later, form and stuff so coincide that the subject matter of American poetry is American poetry itself. When the poets-Whitman himself, Williams, Pound, and Eliot, say, in their later works-become most autobiographical they become at the same time most critical of the impure language of the tribe; and all through the long Ameri- Country, Body. Song: American Remarks 437 The Antioch Review</page><page sequence="14">can poems there is a continuing and deliberate dialectic, a turning inward of the poem's vector and self in the struggle to clean up the nameless lan- guage and open it to easier commerce with its roots. The nadir of this proc- ess is MacLeish's "Ars Poetica," that ladies' afternoon poem lacking both meaning and being; the zenith is Eliot's axiom that "the poetry does not matter"-not in the sense of Marianne Moore's (and A. Alvarez') "beyond all this fiddle," but in the sense borne by the almost perfectly transparent poems written by Snyder, James Wright, and Robert Bly at their best (and Bly's "Ducks" is the finest haiku in English). Tertia pars orbis, fratres, America vocatur, as I mentioned at the begin- ning; but that is not to say that the grand union of body, country, and poem is itself a unique American fact. There are analogues and precedents aplenty. There's Borges' fanciful "On the Cult of Books" plus its corrigendum in the "Epilogue" to Other Inquisitions-a reading of the world-book encyclo- pedia. Curtius' European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages furnishes a spotty but formidable rundown of the scope and history of the whole body of commonplace metaphors linking books and locations-life is reading a book. Hugh of St. Victor considered "both the creation and the God- Man . . . 'books' of God." Other corollaries turn up, I suppose, in any sur- vey of chorographic metaphors in art-the treatment, for example, of the "tree-alphabet" in Graves' The White Goddess. I argue only that the American manifestation of this complex of identity is unusual in the peculiar form it takes and in its intensity and pervasiveness. The longitudinal warp of American literary history can be read as the story of this one metaphor, this outlandish land-figure that so overpowers all other fictions that there is no "poetry" in Leaves of Grass and no "plot" in Moby Dick. I don't see how it could possibly be otherwise. 438 Foll/ Winter 1970-71</page></plain_text>
