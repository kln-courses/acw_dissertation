Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1977. xv, 263 pp. Over the past few years, most of those to whom I have confided my growing interest in the music theory of Hugo Riemann have re- sponded with puzzlement if not boredom. Their reaction is understandable, in a time when theoretical discourse appears con- strained on the one hand by the ubiquitous Ursatz and on the other by the esoteric reaches of set theory. Riemann is primarily known to us as the author of voluminous amounts of largely discredited musicology and of a theory of music noted for the two bizarre notions of harmonic dualism and rhythmic Auftaktigkeit. Still, I find it interesting to ponder his place in intellectual history-- particularly in view of his less widely known writings on aesthetics and psychology-and to wonder why a musical and social climate so close to that which nourished Heinrich Schenker should have given birth to this so radically different mind. A larger question posed by my puzzled friends seems to be: are any of Riemann's ideas actually useful to us these days (like Schenker's), or must he be read exclusively as a period piece? Riemann lived from 1849 to 1919, a scant generation earlier than Schenker, in and around Leipzig. He had an extensive education in law, philosophy, psychology and acoustics as well as music, in both university and con- servatory settings; this breadth of interest re- mained with him throughout his career, giv- ing him a vast and splendid view of the total Arbeitsfeld of music study. Every musical phenomenon that came to his attention be- came an object of scrutiny by his insatiable curiosity and was subsequently incorporated into his thought and work. Unlike Schenker, Riemann made room in his musical cosmos for early music, ethnomusicology, and-late in life-the exploratory tone-systems of Haba, Busoni, and Schoenberg. Furthermore, he is a rarity among music theorists in having created a global and completely self-contained system comprising all the elements of music from harmony to dynamics and tempo. Aspects of Riemann's work can be seen as more responsive to intellectual currents of the day than was Schenker's: the growing interest, for example, in developing positivistic methodologies for the arts and humanities, and the trend away from "great-man" theories of history toward a more continuous and rigorously formulated Problemgeschichte. In some respects his thought appears "modern" even today, particularly his orientation to an essentially phenomenological aesthetic and his analytical use of a conception of hierarchic systems which resembles that recently popularized by Arthur Koestler. Riemann is even the author of an article entitled "Der Januskopf der Harmonie, " published in Hesses deutscher Musiker-Kalender, 1907.1 'Hugo Riemann, Die Elemente der musikalischen Ais- thetik (Berlin: W. Spemann, 1900), pp. 170-71. 178</page><page sequence="2">Elsewhere he argues-like Koestler but with- out his terminology-that musical motives function both as closed units on a low level and as open elements of a larger unit forming on a relatively high level.2 The theoretical writings of Schenker are permeated by an absolute-indeed almost mystical-commitment to the favorite aes- thetic model of the early nineteenth cen- tury, the organism. This allegiance entails for him many related beliefs about works of art, including their inevitable development ac- cording to an innate entelechy (assisted by the "born, not made" genius) and the primary sig- nificance of the mysteriously unified whole which far exceeds any importance local events might have. In Schenker's hands this aesthetic notion is developed into an analytic system of immense explanatory power for certain large musical structures; but dangerous side-effects of apriority and generalization follow from his excessively literal adherence to his model. Just as it is unusual for hands, legs, and ears to grow gradually onto a human body after its birth, but far more normal that they be present at birth, so it is impossible that in a musical composition, a new member can grow to the diminution [i.e. in the foreground] that was not in one way or another al- ready born with the background and middle- ground. 3 The suggestion that surface features of a com- position follow naturally from its background structure has some obvious implications for analytical procedure and for the critic's nearly exclusive focus on the "prior" (to follow the metaphor) levels of the piece. Riemann, on the other hand, displays a more down-to-earth view of the musical or- ganism. Like Tovey and other analysts of the period, he invokes it from time to time as a criterion of coherence and unity, but without literal application or holistic effect. In sharp contrast to Schenker, Riemann argues that "organic unity" occurs in music by virtue of the logical connection of foreground events- and indeed it was the pursuit of such a "musi- cal logic" which remained the central preoc- cupation of his entire career. Instead of idealistic organicism, Riemann's aesthetic is rooted in the discoveries and procedural as- sumptions of physiology, psychology, and acoustical physics, all of which he considered to be equal partners with theoretical specula- tion in the study of music. This positivistic orientation shows itself as a passion for mor- phology, for the endlessly patient examination of tiny musical details, and for comprehensive systems of classification. In the early years of his career Riemann repeatedly expressed his ambition to turn aesthetics, and musical anal- ysis in particular, into an exact science.4 At the outset, then, both theorists are on the trail of universal, absolute principles, and this is very much in keeping with the temper of their time. For Schenker, the universal law of music grows out of rather cosmic beliefs concerning the nature of life and progress, and is irrevocably associated with the tonal music of the common-practice period in western Europe. In every progression the eternal formula of life- birth and death-is given. The progression begins, lives its own existence in the passing notes, and ends when the goal has been achieved. This is or- ganic, like all of life.5 Despite his sweeping claim, this is a formula which cannot be made to apply very well to early music, to music outside Western cul- ture, or to the dodecaphonic composition that was emerging in Schenker's Vienna. Riemann spent many years searching for universals of REVIEWS 2Koestler has used the. term "Janus-faced" to describe the role of elements in a hierarchic structure, which relate simultaneously to lower-level events or units and to the structure as a whole. His concern is that the independence and individuality of these elements not be overlooked in the desire for a holistic view. See for example his The Ghost in the Machine (New York, 1967), or Beyond Re- ductionism, a symposium edited by Koestler with J. R. Smythies (Boston, 1969). 3Heinrich Schenker, Der freie Satz, trans.

He hoped to identify the deeper absolutes of acoustics and human perception which, as he hypothesized of a certain scale formation, were fundamental to the musical practice of "alle Zeiten und V1lker."6 But what is more striking than the differences in scope and theoretical aspiration is the fact that later in life Riemann more or less abandoned the whole idea of music's adherence to such laws. By 1916 his growing interest in non-Western music forced him to doubt the "natural" basis of the art; he re- ported in the foreword to his Folkloristische Tonalitiitsstudien that musical systems may be as much the result of convention and delib- erate construction as the products of natural law-an insight which has not necessarily come to every theorist of tonal music. Riemann's interest in the role played by psychology in aesthetic behavior led him to emphasize "the normal," much in the way Tovey did. This pedagogical and illustrative criterion minimizes the significance of Schenker's "genius" as far as composition is concerned, and on the listener's side under- lines the part played by expectation and syn- tactical convention in hearing music. Indeed, the role of the listener enters into Riemann's thinking in several ways. All of his work stresses what he calls "active hearing" as op- posed to any kind of passive stimulus- reception-this, by the way, is a point equally insisted upon by Schenker, who was skeptical about the invocation of scientific principles. As Gurlitt puts it, Riemann saw the ear as standing between the two apparently irrecon- cilable worlds of science and aesthetics, the crux of the whole process.' His harmonic theory is largely contextual, particularly in the pedagogical works. He warns the would-be analyst that "one can only label with figures [beziffern] what one really hears,"8 and dem- onstrates that a single tone in the middle of a composition may represent.or be taken for one of any number of different harmonies depend- ing on its context. Ultimately he comes to an Aristoxenian belief that the ear's judgment properly takes precedence over the evidence of the monochord. This assertion is all the more instructive for students of his work since it is arrived at after a complete working-through and abandonment of an earlier, more Pythago- rean position. Riemann's focus on the listener leads naturally to a foreground orientation in analy- sis which is of some interest nowadays in view of the work currently going on in musi- cal implication, by Meyer and others. His analyses themselves remain formalistic and morphological-he was more successful in dealing with local events than with the logic of their connection-and thus they lack much explanatory power for a whole musical Ge- stalt. But he asks more interesting and pro- vocative questions than typically occur to theorists of this stripe; he is able, for instance, to present extended analytic comparisons of different works, as in the study of four eighteenth-century minuets in his Grosse Kompositionslehre.f Perhaps the most fundamental role the lis- tener plays for Riemann is in his theory of musical expression, the cornerstone of his aesthetic and analytic systems. He says in his famous Lexicon that "the movement of a [melody] resembles.., .the movements of the soul when the feelings are stirred."10 Asserting that the expressiveness of music cannot safely be overlooked by music theory, he wants however to steer clear of the impressionistic and symbol-ridden criticism characteristic of the earlier nineteenth century. Instead, he wishes to develop a methodology whereby ex- pressive qualities can be analyzed as if in the 6Riemann, Grosse Kompositionslehre (Berlin: W.

He seeks to dem- onstrate, that is, the ways in which musical process is isomorphic with the processes of cognition and affective experience. Needless to say, not all of Riemann's pro- gram worked out in quite the way he hoped. It must already be apparent to the reader that there is enormous tension in his work- indeed, outright contradiction in spots-- between the empirical and phenomenal on the one hand and the logical and deductive on the other. This single most problematic aspect of Riemann's work has kept him from becoming a major force in subsequent music theory. From book to book, and sometimes within a single work, his commitment to the primacy of perception wars against his inclination to- ward the construction of logical systems. Vir- tually all of his pedagogical and speculative theory is ridden with neat and arbitrary dualisms, originating no doubt in the major- minor dualism of which he made so much. His expressive music-psychology is founded upon a distinction between "positive" and "negative" feelings, to which polar categories all the traits of melody, harmony, dynamics, phrasing, and tempo are assigned. Furthermore, it is clear that his theory is no more free of the stifling effects of cultrual chauvinism than Schenker's-though one could perhaps argue that Riemann's has the moral advantage of inadvertence. All of his statements about musical normality, all of his universal principles of musical structure and logic-including the dualisms-are solidly based on the stylistic assumptions of the Wiener Klassik. Again, there is good evidence that much of this parochialism was going by the boards toward the end of his life, but it taints most of his extant writing. The last project he worked on, a "Lehre von den Ton- vorstellungen,"" might have overcome many of these earlier inclinations in its comprehen- sive and sophisticated aesthetic, but it was never finished. The most famous portion of Riemann's theoretical work is the harmonic theory. Based on a hypothesis of the fundamental acoustic dualism of major and minor tonality-and for a few years on the theorist's belief in the literal existence of "undertones" mirroring the overtone series-his system cal- culates and labels all chords and functions in minor keys from the top down, a practice which, as Calvocoressi once tersely remarked, "d6concerte un peu."'2 This notion all by itself calls into question Riemann's allegiance to empirical criteria since it flatly denies the ex- perience of all musicians and no doubt of Riemann himself. Other aspects of his har- monic theory have had considerable and be- neficial impact on the work of later theorists. The replacement of the traditional Stufen- lehre, for instance, with its assumption of equal status for all triads, by the broader com- pass of his Funktionslehre was an important step in the maturation of speculative har- monic theory from its thoroughbass origins to a system capable of dealing with nineteenth- century practice. Human nature is such, how- ever, that Riemann is primarily remembered for his assertion of harmonic dualism. He himself became sufficiently obsessed by it to allow the idea to spill over into the interpreta- tions of other theorists in his History of Music Theory, both subject and object of William C. Mickelsen's new book. The final book of the translated History of Music Theory has long been awaited since the publication of the first two in 1962 by Raymond Haggh.13 Materials on Riemann and English renderings of his works are scarce and must always be gratefully received. Mickelsen has given us both, an extended essay on Riemann's own harmonic theory and its chronological development as well as a trans- REVIEWS "Parts of this work were published as "Ideen zu einer 'Lehre von den Tonvorstellungen' " and "Neue Beitrage zu einer Lehre von den Tonvorstellungen," Jahrbuch der Musikbibliothek Peters 21/22 (1914-15), 1-26 and 23 (1916), 1-21.

Unfortu- nately, enough problems beset both parts of the volume to make the whole, finally, a poor book. First and foremost, it is neither gracefully nor even clearly written. Scarcely a paragraph is unmarred by some grammatical gaucherie or malapropism. Sentences like the following are not at all unusual: "The theory of parallel clangs and other feigning consonant chords are not yet conclusively developed" (p. 47) and, in reference to Riemann's notion of consonance, "The entire system inherent in musical com- position has its involution in the major and minor clangs" (p. 69). Since nothing in the surrounding text suggests any sensible in- terpretation of "involution," one can only surmise that "inception" is intended; elsewhere "consequential" appears for "con- sequent" (p. 212), "premised" for "prefaced" (p. 154), "regretful" for "regrettable" (p. 144), and "unobjectional" presumably for "unobjec- tionable" (p. 222). Nor is the fault all Mick- elsen's. It is scarcely believable that a profes- sional editor had a hand in the production of a book in which "parenthesis" appears in the singular though there are always two of them (p. 83), "principle" is used for "principal" in a direct quotation from a source that spells it correctly (p. 69), and the spelling "epitomy" is invented (p. 96). Proofreading is also dismal; there are even two errors stamped in gold on the spine, which indicates that the volume contains two books or essays by Riemann en- titled Theory of Harmony and History of Music (instead of Mickelsen's monograph Hugo Riemann's Theory of Harmony and Riemann's History of Music Theory). A first quick reading of the text reveals dozens of typographical errors, drastically undermining the credibility of the book in less immediately evident matters like page references and dates. One shudders to think of the possibilities for misprints in the fiendish complexity of Riemann's analytic notation. The translation fares not much better. We get "prehensible" instead of "comprehensible" for greifbar (p. 150) and, inexplicably as well as illiterately, "importunable" for gequilten (p. 190)-which might be rendered "tortured" or "strained" in a description of Rameau's oc- casional invocation of acoustic principles. Some cases are less egregious but would cer- tainly wreak havoc with the kind of close reading to which theoretical texts are habitually subjected. For instance, "[The basso seguente] enabled the organist to cover the eventual omission of individual parts with his accompaniment" (p. 150), which seems to imply that certain parts were intended to be left out eventually. Riemann actually speaks of "das etwaige Ausfallen einzelner Stim- men,"'14 and surely he is referring to such voi- ces as may happen to be left out in perfor- mance. Mickelsen has confused "eventual" with "in the event of." On page 186 we read that Kirnberger "discusses ... continuous suc- cessions of dissonances 'which have been much in use, especially since the time of Mar- cello,' but which have again more recently disgressed." Incomprehensible, this, until one has recourse to Riemann's verb "abkimen"15 and learns that such dissonances have become obsolete or gone out of fashion. Also, the common German Scheinkonsonanz might more helpfully be translated "apparent" or "quasi-" consonance than Mickelsen's ghastly anthropomorphic "feigning." In the essay, the sources of the musical examples are not always clear; are they quoted from Riemann's books or devised by Mick- elsen? It is urgent that all quotations from sources other that the translation at hand should also be given in the original language, for in the field of music theory whole disputes often turn on the reading of a single word. Footnotes, bibliography, and index have their share of errors and oddities. The reader pursu- ing a reference to Descartes's correspondence must look in the bibliography under Oeuvres des [sic] Descartes rather than the author's name. The list of Riemann's works in the gen- eral bibliography is chronological rather than alphabetical, so the user must read the whole list to find one unless he knows the publica- "'Riemann, Geschichte der Musiktheorie im IX.-XIX.

In the index, a large and various list is provided under the rubric "Chords," but Riemann's leading-tone-change-chord must be sought elsewhere, under "L." In the translation, Mickelsen faced the difficult problem of coping with two sets of notes, Riemann's and his own. His solution is unwieldy, providing first a collection of the original-language quotations used by Rie- mann-in a set of "Footnotes" whose num- bers are not consecutive since all other kinds of notes are omitted here-and then several pages of "Notes" which include En- glish translations of Riemann's original foot- notes plus Mickelsen's editorial comments. Both categories are presented at the ends of chapters rather than being left in situ, and this makes for a very great deal of page-flipping if one is reading closely. Concerning quotations translated into German by Riemann, Mickel- sen's decision to furnish all relevant versions of the text was the right one. Riemann's own translations are idiosyncratic and frankly dis- torted in favor of his dualistic theories, so the reader must be provided with accurate ver- sions; but since this book will likely be used more as an index of Riemann's thought than as objective history, the primary English text must reflect his bowdlerized version. To take as an example one of Riemann's more notori- ous changes, he quotes Zarlino as saying, "The essential substance of polyphonic com- position is not to be found in the variety of the consonances created by the two parts ..." (p. 107, emphasis mine), an accurate rendering of the German "nicht .... zu suchen [ist]."'16 But Zarlino actually warns only that the de- sired variety of harmony "non consiste sol- amente" in a variety of consonances,17 and Mickelsen duly provides us in addition with Strunk's more reliable translation (p. 136). In Riemann's harmonic theory, and in his interpretations of earlier theorists, there lurk a number of technical difficulties awaiting the unwary reader; one would hope that a com- mentator in Mickelsen's position would pro- vide patient and clear explanations to help us navigate these shoals. But unfortunately Mick- elsen does not always succeed in this en- deavor. In the basic discussion of dualistic harmonic theory as transmitted to Riemann from Arthur von Oettingen, the point is raised that "the descending e minor scale" is "the one used by Oettingen as the scale opposite to the major scale" (p. 33). The scale intended by the dualistic theorists, created by inverting the TTSTTTS pattern of the major scale, is in fact a Phrygian scale and not a version of modem minorl8-for which reason, indeed, the notion of dualism leans here on a weak reed. This would seem a good place for our au- thor to comment on this anomaly-or at least acknowledge it-and perhaps on the efforts of Oettingen's and Riemann's theories to deal with it, but he does not do so. Often Mick- elsen has difficulty describing certain phenomena of the theory clearly (though for- tunately his book is replete with illustrations which somewhat mitigate the problem). His description of Riemann's method of notating chord inversions is opaque: "The Arabic nu- merals 3 and 5 (in place of Roman numerals) beneath the note show which member of the chord it is. For example, c = e-g-c', and = g-c'-e"' (p. 47). Reading the first sen- tence, and in the absence of a musical illus- tration, one would assume c to be part of a triad a-c-e, and c part of f-a-c. Judging from his examples, however, the definition should say that the numeral indicates which chord member is in the bass. I am not sure, either, why these numbers are said to appear "in place of Roman numerals," which serve a totally different purpose. Riemann's "leading-tone-change clang" (Leittonwechselklang), though it is illustrated and though Shirlaw's confusion about it is duly straightened out (p. 65), is nowhere sim- ply defined as a consonant chord whose root has been replaced by its own leading tone.

The most infamous of all confusions in the History of Music Theory is Riemann's in- sistence that Zarlino was an early believer in the dualistic opposition of major and minor harmonies. This notion is based at least par- tially on the translation of Zarlino's "repli- cate" as "Oktavversetzungen" or "inversions" rather than "octave compounds" as Zarlino clearly intended. Thus Riemann develops an image of chords in thirds and fifths being con- structed mirror-like on either side of a funda- mental tone, whereas Zarlino's reference is simply to a contrapuntal style of which thirds, fifths, tenths, twelfths, and so on constitute the basic vocabulary. Riemann's error has been clearly exposed by both Dahlhaus and Wienpahl (and for that matter by Shirlaw),1" but Mickelsen's discussion only compounds the confusion by misquoting an explanation in- vented by Riemann to support his contrary thesis. "That the term Replicati means octave compounds, not inversions, is substantiated in the text when Zarlino calls the minor sixth (8:5) a consonance because the eighth is merely a replica (compound) of fourth and second" (p. 7). What Zarlino in fact does is to explain the minor sixth as a compound of minor third (6:5) and perfect fourth (4:3 = 8:6), and thus bring the composite interval 8:6:5 within the compass of the senario. That he understood the acoustic octave relation of 8:4:2 (which is what Riemann points out, p. 109) is not to say that the eighth "is a replica of fourth and second," which is meaningless in any case. Since in the preparation of this book Mick- elsen made the decision to accompany his translation with an essay on Riemann's har- monic theory, one may legitimately inquire into the purposes served by such an essay. Needless to say, I can think of any number of questions that might be profitably pursued, not least the matter of how we might view Riemann's own position in the history of music theory. Most of the present essay, how- ever, is occupied with a "reader's digest" of Riemann's various writings on speculative and practical harmony. There is little here which has not already been amply covered in Denecke's Die Kompositionslehre Hugo Riemanns, historisch und systematisch dargestellt (Kiel, 1937), Grabner's Die Funktionstheorie Hugo Riemanns und ihre Bedeutung fiir die praktische Analyse (Munich, 1923), Seidel's essay on the har- monic theory in Beitriige zur Musiktheorie des 19. Jahrhunderts (Regensburg, 1966), and Gerd Sievers's Die Grundlagen Hugo Riemanns bei Max Reger (Wiesbaden, 1967)-the latter, by the way, does not appear in Mickelsen's bibliography. Mickelsen's reliance on secondary sources seems inordinate, particularly in view of the "onion effect" inherent in his subject matter. At times we find ourselves reading Mickelsen on Shirlaw on Riemann on Zarlino. This de- pendency extends to questions of evaluation, betraying an enormous diffidence on the author's part toward making any strong argu- ment about the shape of Riemann's work and thought. The uncertainty shows itself in sen- tences like "This, according to Elmer Seidel, "'Carl Dahlhaus, "War Zarlino Dualist?," Die Musik- forschung 10 (1975), 286-90; Robert W. Wienpahl, "Zar- lino, the Senario, and Tonality," Journal of the American Musicological Society 12 (1959), 2 7-41; Matthew Shirlaw, The Theory of Harmony (New York, 1969; rpt. of 1917 edn.), pp. 47ff. 184</page><page sequence="8">is very significant" (p. 28) and has to do with much larger questions about the status of the essay as a whole, to which I will return pre- sently. (Seidel's name, incidentally, is Elmar.) The author relies for information on the psy- chology of hearing upon the 1938 text of Stevens and Davis which, though a classic in its day, must surely have been supplanted in the forty years intervening. When the essay turns toward broader questions, as in its final chapter entitled "Riemann's Successors," its author runs afoul of easy explanations and an excessive credu- lity about influence and history. The connec- tions he suggests between Riemann's theory and those of Schenker, Kurth, and Hindemith (among others) raise basic questions of defini- tion and of the relation between original thought or invention and the mere reflection of common intellectual currents. Since I made some comparisons between Riemann and Schenker earlier in this review, let me pursue this relationship as seen by Mickelsen. While noting the sharp distinction between the two, he also says that "some of his [Schenker's] most important concepts are too close to Riemann's to be overlooked" (p. 95-one gathers that he means their closeness ought not to be overlooked); he seems to have in mind such ideas as the natural origin of major harmony and the view that the church modes are defective and "unnatural." But these no- tions are the products of standard nineteenth- century ways of thinking about developmental history and the primacy of natural law, and are shared by virtually everyone of the period. To find them held in common by two music theorists is neither surprising nor suggestive of any connection between them. Mickelsen continues: The Ursatz as developed by Schenker appears to be an enlargement of the Riemann psychological con- cept that a composition is a journey from the state of consonance of the tonic center through the dis- sonant lands of other chords and keys, but con- stantly referring back, and eventually coming to rest in the consonance of the home chord (p. 97). Whatever the situation of chronological pre- cedence, and whatever Riemann's original contributions may have been, surely it is too much to suppose that a musical intelligence of Schenker's eminence would not have arrived independently at the conclusion that the tonic is the chord of greatest repose! Throughout the chapter this fuzziness of implication remains, and it is never made clear what role is genuinely played by Riemann and what played afterwards or simultaneously by others. (Such questions may be unanswerable, but since they are asked here one must protest simplistic and misleading answers.) Ultimately, virtually every scrap of familiar harmonic and pedagog- ical theory is at least imputed to Riemann's influence-a sort of dualistic guilt by association-so that there is no possibility of exploring more profound matters like the for- mation of theories and the competing argu- ments on which they rest. What is under review here is not a proper scholarly book. It would not warrant detailed attention if not for the intrinsic importance of its subject matter and the likelihood that many people will be eager to read and use it. The resuscitation of Hugo Riemann's reputa- tion as a musical thinker has yet to be ac- complished. I suspect it will be aided more by study of his aesthetics and psychology than of his harmonic theory, but even in this latter area there is much of interest to be said. It is particularly unfortunate that so much energy is spent by Mickelsen and other writers in cavilling about relatively petty matters like the objective existence of undertones. As Hellmuth Christian Wolff remarked in a per- ceptive article, "It was a prominent charac- teristic of Riemann to strive continually for new understanding, and to modify his own theories or even give them up entirely whenever they appeared too limited or incor- rect."20 But as he also says, it is Riemann's fate that most of his abandoned ideas "con- tinue consciously or unconsciously to haunt many heads." It would be nice to see a study of Hugo Riemann that helped IIdN. to exorcise these hauntings.
