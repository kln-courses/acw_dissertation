<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE AUTHORITY OF THE PAST Sickness and Society in Freud's Thought BY PHILIP RIEFF It is less as an original mind than as a summative one that Freud's was superb. The ideas at the basis of the Freudian social theory represent a climax, rather than a new departure, in a remarkable chain of reasoning about the relation between sick- ness and the past. Early in the nineteenth century Carl-Gustav Carus, a lonely figure working between the then sealed borders of physiology and psychology, suggested that the sickly part of the soul is really a repetition of the lowliest stuff of organic nature. During his Croonian lectures (1884) Hughlings Jackson, a great English neurologist whom Freud much admired, spoke of the dis- solution of the complicated system of functions, and the recon- stitution of the simplest and lowest elements of the nervous system, in psychoses. About the same time in France the psy- chologist Ribot developed a concept of "regressions/1 to explain how memory, through some injury, might take a step backward down the ladder of progress from the contemporaneous to the ancient; this he connected with certain exotic elements of spon- taneity in the civilized character - like automatic writing. Janet, a contemporary of Freud's, described a hierarchy of steps in mental functions through which the mind could descend as well as ascend to any level. The folk psychologist Lazarus constructed mental illness as a sinking into the fantasy world of the natural man - hardly a complimentary image. Freud only summed up an entire movement of poetic and scientific thought when he announced that the abnormal is the primitive.1 All these connections between sickness and the past, the abnor- 1 For a brilliant discussion of this development see "Der Aufbau der Persönlich- keit," in Gottfried Benn, Essays (Wiesbaden 1951) pp. 71-90-</page><page sequence="2">THE AUTHORITY OF THE PAST 429 mal and the primitive, depend, of course, upon some idea of parallelism or recapitulation. And indeed the theory of biological recapitulation - embryonic development sums up racial develop- ment - had frequently been carried over into psychology, becom- ing a contention that the maturing of each individual mind repeats the development of mind through the evolutionary series. But, contrary to the established image of Freud as a clinician first and a social theorist only through some misplaced ambition, it was from its use in the rising social sciences that he assimilated the recapitulation theory. Freud barely mentioned the biological and psychological forms of the recapitulation idea. A more nearly sociological version, familiar through the variety of uses to which it was put by Herder, Herbart, Comte, and Spencer, is the one he often employed. This idea - that the individual mind presents in its development a résumé of the stages of human history- reached Freud especially by way of the new science of anthropology. Because he was interested not in the end of the recapitulatory series but in the beginnings, Freud followed with special care contemporary researches into the psychology of primitives. His accent was on the conditions of individual and social deficiencies rather than on their normative completeness. 1 The first locus of the primitive which Freud found in contempo- rary mental life was the dream. Although he rightly insisted that it had not been scientifically developed, the idea was hardly unknown. In The Birth of Tragedy Nietzsche remarked on how the dream, by returning us to the narrow dark corners out of which human culture developed, offers modern man the means continually to revise his high estimate of himself. The second locus of the primitive as Freud found it in con- temporary life was even better known. All the famous anthropo- logical studies on which he depended-- Frazer's Golden Bough most heavilv, books by Atkinson, Lubbock, Tylor, Robertson</page><page sequence="3">43O SOCIAL RESEARCH Smith, Crawley, Marett, Lang - made free use of the analogy between the primitive and the child. It was more customary to construct the primitive era of civilization as the "childhood of the race" than to invert the image, making of childhood the primitive era of the individual. Nevertheless Freud was repeating a theoretical commonplace when he asserted that, in the few years of childhood, "we have to cover the enormous distance of develop- ment from primitive man of the Stone Age to civilized man of today."2 He exploited both ends of his analogy, attributing to "primeval peoples the same feelings and emotions that we have elucidated in the primitives of our own times, our children," 3 and attributing to "the psychic life of present-day children, the same archaic moments . . . which generally prevailed at the time of primitive civilization." 4 Thus materials on the irrational ways of primitives - Freud's point of departure in Totem and Taboo (1912), his first book explicitly in social theory - were readily applied, by analogy, to the behavior of children and neurotics. Freud did not fix wholly on the beginning of the recapitulatory development. He was especially fond of typologies of growth on the evolutionist model, like the sexual-characterological sequence of "oral," "urethral," "anal," and "genital" stages, and in general showed a strong susceptibility to developmental schemes and predictions. Presumably following anthropologists such as Tylor, who had been deeply influenced by the English Comteans, Freud saw "the evolution of man's conceptions of the universe" in the inevitable three stages: "animistic," "religious," and "scientific." 5 * The Question of I*y Analysis, translated by Nancy Procter-Gregg (London 1947) 3 Moses and Monotheism, translated by Katherine Jones (New York 1949) p. 128. * The Question of Lay Analysis, pp. 96-97. 5 Totem and Taboo, translated' by A. A. Brill in Basic Writings of btgmuna treua (New York 1938) p. 875. As early as 1750 the French philosopher Turgot asserted that the advance of our knowledge of nature proceeded by a gradual emancipation from those anthropomorphic concepts which first led humans to interpret natural phenomena after their own image, as animated by minds like their own. This idea was later to become a leading theme in the positivist philosophy of history, and the way of thinking it described was popularized as "fetishism," and then by the terms "anthropomorphism" and "animism."</page><page sequence="4">THE AUTHORITY OF THE PAST 431 The radical turn that psychoanalysis gave to the positivist triad (such constructions are as old as the division of time into past, present, and future) was to translate the intellectual into "the libidinous development of the individual." To the charge that Freud put. forth an exaggeratedly sexual view of mind, one might cite his strongly mental view of sexuality, of which we see an element in his assumption that the mind no less than the body expresses one's erotic capacities. Thus Freud summarized the inner meaning of mental organiza- tion as a particular layer of sexual evolution, a point made much of in the "British school" of psychoanalysis, with its overworked metaphor of the "introjection" (Ferenczi's coinage) of "good" and "bad" objects. He asserted in Totem and Taboo (pp. 875-77, italics mine) that "the animistic phase corresponds in time as well as in content with narcissism, the religious phase ... to that stage of object finding which is characterized by dependence on the parents, while the scientific stage has its full counterpart in the individual stage of maturity where, having renounced the pleasure principle and having adapted himself to reality, he seeks his object in the outer world." It is a suggestive statement, yet not one to receive elaboration. For the fact is that Freud accepted evolutionist monism only with a severe qualification - a qualifica- tion born of the idea's very familiarity. Nothing was more foreign to Freud's mind than the optimistic temper in which the positivist three-stage theory was regularly proffered. It is the ethical hope of evolutionist theory which inspired Freud's late book on religion, The Future of an Illusion (1928). But for the most part he viewed "the upward development of mankind" ambivalently. There was not only the head but also the heart to consider; and one of the ideas most popular in Freud's time was that man had developed intellect at the expense of passion. Von Hartmann tried to console himself that at least our intellects would be sharpened in the evolutionary process, but he judged this advance a horror. "Men would gradually become true devils thereby," Burckhardt commented on this prophecy,</page><page sequence="5">43* SOCIAL RESEARCH "and at the end cripples from nothing but developed intellect. " e The evolutionist vision of action without passion drove Nietzsche to his deepest nightmare: of the last man, the mass man, whose posture is reclining, whose feeling is ennui, bored in a world in which intelligence has made of living a routine. Freud's warning in Moses and Monotheism against the trend in which "the world of the senses becomes gradually mastered by spirituality" (p. 186) is thus an echo of nineteenth-century pes- simism. To fear that "the evolution of culture . . . may perhaps be leading to the extinction of the human race" reflects a period suspicion of culture, for spirituality was then supposed to have shown its power to transform sexuality, "pleasurable to our ancestors," into something "indifferent or even intolerable to our- selves." 7 As one of the late romantics in a world sick of romance (reality had become so much stranger), Freud saw the Utopian possibility as the end of possibility. He returned to an analysis of origins: if the plant appears twisted, if life begins to wither away, the condition of the root becomes the inevitable question. G. Stanley Hall, an influential proponent of the psychological theory of recapitulation, well expressed the aim of a psychology respectful of origins: "to conceive the whole world, material and spiritual, as an organic unity, to eliminate all breaks and super- naturalism, and to realize that everything within and without was hoary with age, so that in most experiences we were dealing only with the topmost twigs of vast and deeply buried trees." 8 A comparison of Freud and Hall is interesting, for although Hall received psychoanalysis most congenially, his genetic psychology was far more evolutionist than Freud's.

The play of children seemed to him to rehearse in adumbrated ways the social life of our ancestors - a conception still influential through the child psychology of Piaget, in which even in play forms the evolution from primitive magical obedience to democratic consensus is supposed to be repeated. Accelerations and retardations in the height and weight of individual children were read by Hall as traces of ancient fluctuations in the development of the race. Adolescence reca- pitulates some prehistoric period of "storm and stress," while the characteristics of children from the ages of eight to twelve, Hall conjectured, represent the culmination of one stage of life, proba- bly maturity in some remote and perhaps pygmoid stage of racial evolution.9 Freud too referred to a suppositious disjunction in primitive biological continuity in explaining the intervention of what he called a period of "latency" between childhood sexuality and the onset of mature sexuality at puberty.10 For the most part, how- ever, such biological and historical correspondences are ignored in Freud's writings. He preferred to state the analogy between primitive and child - and, further, between the sexual evolution of the mind and the evolution of culture - in highly psychological terms. Thus he wrote, in Moses and Monotheism (p. 126): "In the history of the human species something happened similar to the events in the life of the individual. That is to say, mankind as a whole passed through conflicts of a sexual-aggressive nature, which left permanent traces, but which were for the most part warded off and forgotten; later, after a long period of latency, they came to life again and created phenomena similar in structure and tendency to neurotic symptoms."

Yet it is clear enough that his description is not so much of an evolution as of a reversion. If there are original traumas in group history as well as in the life of the individual, evolution supplies no escape from them. Freud transformed the usually optimistic analogy of children and primi- tives into a grim disclosure of the power of the primitive in history and of childishness in the individual adult. The primitive and the child survive in memory, the representative of the past among the faculties. Against the over-confidence of reason, repre- senting the future, the Lamarckian Freud asserted the ancient claim of memory to a greater power than reason had allowed. The authority of the past can be modified only as the present reconciles itself to the continuing authority of the past. n Once upon a time, we read in Totem and Taboo, "psychic reality, concerning whose structure there is no doubt . . . coincided with actual reality." Freud's propensity was ever to defer to natural violence as the "real" part of mental life. And this "reality," though diluted through culture, he supposed to retain some repre- sentational importance: the egoistic, murderous wishes of the child represent the deeds of primitive man. In the beginning of human society, he said in that work (p. 930), "men really did" what now, according to psychological testimony, they only wish to do. Originally thinking and doing were identical; and the incapacity of psychotics to distinguish between thought and reality supplied Freud with a clue to what primitive life was normally like: ."There is not only method in madness, as the poet has already perceived, but also a fragment of historic truth." n Darwin's conjecture "to the effect that the primitive form of human society was that of a horde ruled over despotically by a powerful male" Freud took seriously as the historical situation 11 "Constructions in Analysis," translated by James Strachey, in Collected Papers, vol. 5.

But though Freud's theory of myth was euhemerist, in contradic- tion to modern social science, the historical figures are themselves bound to psychological ones, and the historical actions are neces- sary-granted the nature" of man. Animated by an older and perhaps more naive concern for the nature that drives history, Freud never ceased inquiring into the prehistorical causes of events. It was at the instincts that his ante-historical research ended, in a neat harmony of instinct and primordial event behind which, as we shall see, he masked his judgment of human nature. He held that while "humans have no business to exclude themselves from the animal kingdom," 13 they can be more bestial than the other animals; the difference makes social life as we know it possible. "In the beginning was the deed," Freud wrote in Moses and Monotheism (p. 111), repeat- ing Faust, and the deed was a crime. "That instinct which is said to restrain the other animals from killing and devouring their own species we need not attribute to him." 14 Discerning from adult neurotics, from children, and from the evidence of dreams that all men desire to kill their fathers, Freud supposed that primitive man really did kill his. It is "in this particular way," he concluded in Moses and Monotheism (p. 162), "that men have always known . . . that once upon a time they had a primeval father and killed him." In the beginning the will of the group - personified in the primal leader - was the will of each, a mistaken notion of the monolith constitution of the primitive group that Freud found 12 Group Psychology and the Analysts of the Ego, translated by James Strachey (London 1949) p. 92. is "Thoughts for the Time on War and Death," translated by E.

Then came the first act of individuality: rebellion, from which moment Freud distinguished between individual and collective development. Individuality gained meaning in Freudian theory as an act of libidinal aliena- tion; the trigger of self-consciousness was the killing of the primal father by the sons. Freud constructed social life to exhibit the consequences of an act of will - neither the routine repetition of animal behavior nor divine interference, but a natural drama inevitable and yet terrible. But Freud's origins myth does not imply that by murder social life was freed from dependence. Rather, another political stage - submission characterized by guilt - was laid over the primal one. The primal murder, if it cut the cord of nature, replaced it by one that was stricter. Here, politics and religion, the ways of reuniting the many under a single authority, come into existence. For man's will was ambivalent from the beginning, and parricide was an act he at once desired to commit and could never cease to regret. As he desired his freedom he missed his thralldom. Political-religious history is a record of man's irra- tional attempts to reinstate the primal father without relinquish- ing freedom. The will, so far as it was free, found itself wanting also to renounce its liberty, not just from prudence - what Freud, too, called "the war of each against all" {Totem and Taboo, p. 930) - but also out of remorse and love for authority. As children must love their parents, so did the first citizens love their ruler; his reinstatement - at least in symbolic form - was as natural as his deposition. Each of the guilty sons desired instinctual sovereignty, Freud supposed; each envied the power of all the others. Some form of inhibition was necessary to control the inclinations to rape and murder. "The first attempt ever made to regulate these social relations already contained the essential element of civilization." 15 The sexual expenditure of creative energy was dammed, and redirected toward building social restraints and defenses against i» Civilization and its Discontents, translated by Joan Riviere (London 1939) p. 39.</page><page sequence="10">THE AUTHORITY OF THE PAST 437 nature. Freud derived "each great cultural victory" from separate feats of instinctual renunciation. The use of tools was a miming of the gratifying violence of sexual intercourse, and therefore a substitute for it; the gaining of fire resulted from some first staunch soul's denial of urethral eroticism; dwellings were "a substitute for the mother's womb, that first abode, in which he was safe and felt so content, for which he probably yearns ever after." 16 But - as is clear in Moses and Monotheism - whatever cultural victories man was able to achieve in the history which succeeded the primal one, the original crime was of such importance that it "must have left some permanent trace in the human soul" (pp. 204-05). This trace, Freud thought, contributed an "archaic heritage" in human mental life that "corresponds to the instincts in animals," but differs from animal instinct so far as it includes "not only dispositions, but also . . . traces of the experience of former generations" (pp. 159-61). That difference makes it, how- ever, no less permanent. And the question remains for Freud: how are the ideational contents of the past transmitted? "In what form" does the prototypical event live on in the life of the group? To say that the primal crime must have left "something com- parable to a tradition" (pp. 204-05) is to beg the question. How is "tradition" possible? Plainly there is culture. But Freud thought that nothing "real" is to be found in civilized adults that was not already in the Urmensch, the natural man. The conscious transmission of culture was rejected for what he considered a more profound i«/Wd., pp. 51-52. In his conjectural prototypes of work and first cultural pos- sessions, Freud assumed a universal facility in perceiving subjective spatial analogies. He insisted that the forming and shaping uses of a tool are regularly "animized" as the relation of male to female. With regard to the infantile impulse to put out fire with a stream of urine, Freud asserted that "the legends we possess . . . and the later fables of Gulliver in Lilliput and Rabelais' Gargantua . . . leave no doubt that flames shooting upwards like tongues were originally felt to have a phallic sense." As he symbolically equated penis- tongue-flame from the grossest abstraction of maleness, he similarly insisted that dwellings, hearths, and all other spaces of enclosure - on the analogy of the womb - are female. But there is something more than an impertinent plastic imagination at work here, since Freud made his ana- logical objects and relations a clue to historical truth.</page><page sequence="11">438 SOCIAL RESEARCH continuity. The deepest instinctual secrets are not rationally preserved and disseminated on the family model (by parents and parent-surrogates); they are - remembered.17 But Freud's Lamarckianism did not stop at a simple linear transmission. Rather, the persistence of the primal act must be denied, for- gotten. What defines the impact of memory is one's reaction to it, against it. Prototypical events - the primal crime and its repeti- tions, like the murder of Moses, the murder of Christ - must operate in the sublimative form of tradition as a great secret, the reaction to which is, of course, unconscious. History, as the trail of the prototype, became for Freud a process of the "return of the repressed" (Moses and Monotheism, p. 201), distorting exten- sively and nevertheless eternally recapitulatory. in This curious, obviously conjectural account of the origin of society, these grotesque analogical explanations of great cultural advances, lead us back toward the genesis of the prototypical method itself, and into some assumptions of the anthropology to which Freud was indebted. The most illuminating connection (as has been pointed out by Ludwig Binswanger and Fritz Wittels) is with Goethe. In the decade or so before 1800 Goethe was engrossed in those botanical studies out of which he formulated his theory of the metamorpho- sis of plants. The form of his theory - the positing of a so-called ancestral plant (Urpflanze) which evolved into the multiformity of plants as now existing - has many antecedents. Many of the connections to Freud drawn in this paper must be set in that vaguest of frames - an intellectual climate or tradition that he shared with other minds, rather than a conscious influence - but it Freud thought that "what was acquired by our ancestors is certainly an impor- tant part of what we inherit": "Analysis Terminable and Interminable," translated by Joan Riviere, in Collected Papers, vol. 5, p. 543. The connection between psycho- analysis and Lamarckianism cannot be overestimated. Freud, Freudians, and schis- matics-including Jung, Adler, Reich- arc thoroughly and consciously Lamarckian, and assert their science would be impossible if shorn of that strain.</page><page sequence="12">THE AUTHORITY OF THE PAST 439 we know much more about Goethe's intellectual genealogy. It seems settled that he absorbed the general idea of the ' 'prototype" from Diderot and Ribonet, and only gave it new exemplification. It is worth noticing how many of the notions of romanticism, and laterally of anthropology, originated in the French Enlightenment - not only the notion of the prototype but also, as we have seen, that of animism. These connections challenge the established divisions of intellectual history and would, I think, throw a new light on modern anthropology if they were thoroughly explored. Goethe regarded the diverse appendages of the shoot in higher plants as the metamorphosed products of a single fundamental organ, the leaf. The theory of metamorphosis made a lasting impression on biological thought, and finally took a full circle from Diderot through Goethe to Freud. The primal leaf became the primal form, the Urform, and this, transplanted into psychol- ogy, became the Freudian prototype. In Goethe's words: "With this pattern, and the key thereto, one can still discover plants ad infinitum which must be consistent with the pattern; that is to say, they might exist even though they do not, and hence they are not merely poetic shadows and apparitions but have intrinsic truth and necessity. The same law is capable of application to all other living things." 18 Schiller pointed out that the conceptions that Goethe employed belong to the realm of ideas rather than of facts; Goethe did not object. The ancestral form appears to the mind, he recognized, not to the sense. Here Goethe's theory of evolution contradicts both that of Lamarck and that of Darwin. Goethe's is an "idealistic morphology." No matter that there never was an ancestral plant, lonely and nowhere, which then begot all other plants in all their varieties. The transformation by virtue of which various parts of the plant - its sepals, petals, stamens, and so on - differentiated from one common form, the leaf, is an ideal not a real genesis. is J. W. von Goethe, "Brief an Frau Stein," 8 June 1787, in Goethes Briefe (Leipzig 1923) vol. 7, pp. 25« ff.</page><page sequence="13">44O SOCIAL RESEARCH As little as Goethe's Urpflanze was a real plant was the Freudian Urmensch a real person. The Urmensch was not a factual begin- ning; it is an expedient of scientific reflection and reduction. Criticism by anthropologists of Freud's ahistoric conception has been somewhat too harsh, expressing as it does indignation at an idealism that anthropology itself has not completely abandoned, though it is hidden now behind all kinds of prefatory disclaimers. A more pertinent difficulty with Freud's anthropology is that Freud - unlike Goethe, who was less aggressive toward his imagi- nation - found the ideality of his constructs a handicap. In one place Freud does call his account of primal events a "just-so story," intended "to lighten the darkness of prehistoric times" (Group Psychology . . ., p. 90). But Darwin had professed those events as a factual beginning, and Freud could not resist the temptation to have it both ways; he insisted, in Totem and Taboo, that the primal murder was a literal historical event. The sense of deficiency in facts is one that Freud shared with the whole of evolutionary social science, but particularly with anthropology, which regularly substituted for historical documen- tation a logical history backwards along the functional lines or diffusional routes of the present. We can better appreciate the dilemma of anthropological method by recalling that the science of man is not young, nor is cultural diversity - its central problem - such a recently stated one. To press the matter no farther back than the seventeenth century, anthropology was already flourish- ing then, under the significantly different name of "cosmography." The seventeenth-century inquiry took as its subject cultural diversity on a world-wide and history-wide scale. But in the nineteenth century, when the existing departmentalization of the social sciences came into being, the scope of the older discipline was radically curtailed. Cosmography became anthropology, with- drawing from the problem of total diversity to the fascinating materials on contemporary primitive cultures. Non-literate and embryonically literate peoples, while consti- tuting a valuable perspective on humanity as a whole, are danger-</page><page sequence="14">THE AUTHORITY OF THE PAST 441 ous samples for the understanding of historic civilizations. Their history-less condition has frequently provoked anthropologists to a programmatic overvaluation of savage simplicities, and to the use of what Freud, exemplifying the practice in Group Psychol- ogy . . ., called "scientific myths'* of the primal form of human relations. Thereby a certain set of events, regarded as unique and non-recurrent, may be withdrawn from rational verification, and all subsequent (dated) history treated as repetitions of the conjectured prototype. This congruence of past with present feelings and social bonds, as the anthropologists assume it, allows the recovery of the non-literate past by observing our contempo- rary primitives in the jungle and the nursery. Needless to say, the appeal to conjectural history in the form of various devclopmentalisms is older than Goethe and modern anthropology. In the study of linguistics, for example, there have been particularly tenacious endeavors to discover the "original form" or "linguistic root" of language in the primordial past or - as in Leibnitz's concept of a lingua adámica - in an ideal future language whose objectivity our cognition must progressively approach. But the error is particularly exposed in the social developmentalisms that flourished in the nineteenth century - the theory of descent from a common ancestor, which Freud borrowed from Darwin, being one of many examples. A method that may succeed in the natural sciences - though even one of these, geology, is said to be in historical difficulties - clearly sponsors unwarranted confidence in the linear identities of past and present when appro- priated by social sciences like psychology and anthropology. Freud's implicit appeal to a doctrine of uniformism accounts for a good part (but not all) of his irritating opaqueness to his- torical change. By his slippery reasoning, any object, event, or relation can be invested with psychological gravity. More a psy- chological mold than a historic fact, the prototype or trauma may "cathect" with little regard for the context, since the object itself will stand for something else. But Freud's stress on the power of the past, while it does amount to a denial of social and historical</page><page sequence="15">442 SOCIAL RESEARCH changes in their own right, equally sustained an extraordinary sensitivity on his part to the presence of prototypical motives, often in a vestigial and distorted form, in the artifacts of culture and the private art of dreams. I have not tried to detail Freud's affinities with the other greats of nineteenth-century science, but at least one more anthropologist - Bachofen - deserves mention in this respect. The similarity between Freud's method and Bachofen's is their recourse to indirect sources in constructing conjectural history. Bachofen's theory of patriarchy as emerging from a prior matriarchal rule - which Freud thought he had corrected - is based on a study of Aeschylus' Oresteia, especially the third play of the trilogy, the Eumenides. King Lear and Faust show a similar "Aeschylus structure," Bachofen noted. One thinks immediately of Freud's penchant for finding the "Oedipus structure" in Ibsen, Dostoevski, Shakespeare, and practically every literary work he touched after he first translated Oedipus Rex as a Gymnasium student. Bachofen's method of raiding archaeology, mythology, paleon- tology, and poetry to discover "prehistoric history" is essential to psychoanalysis, in both its individual and its cultural applications. It is in myth and art that prototypes are extolled, and that is why Freud (like Bachofen) found there mines of the most significant history. By thus assimilating literary analysis to a theory of origins, Bachofen prepared the way for the elaborate and literary Freudian origins myth. IV Freud had no theory of gradual evolution from the primal events. They stand isolated in the prehistory of individual and group, persisting unchanged alongside the latest.19 Here we may note a difference from Goethe. In Goethe's theory of the metamorphosis of plants, the ancestral form of the leaves permutâtes as blossoms, i» See Civilization and its Discontents, pp. 14-15: "In the realm of mind ... the primitive type is so commonly preserved alongside the transformations which have developed out of it that it is superfluous to give instances in proof of it."</page><page sequence="16">THE AUTHORITY OF THE PAST 443 filaments, and pistils, as calyx, seed, and fruit, the primal leaf dis- appearing except as a "form idea." In contrast, Freud saw in all psychological metamorphosis the reappearance of the basic form of the instincts themselves, always present as the indestructible factors in events. But though Freud's "scientific myth" has no verifiably historical value, as I think we must conclude, it is nevertheless a powerful if one-eyed instrument of evaluation. Totem and Taboo, Group Psychology, Moses and Monotheism, and allied works of Freud cannot any more be dismissed because the anthropology upon which they drew is now outmoded than that great polemic on the emancipation of women, The Origin of the Family, is refuted by citing the discredited conjectures on matriarchy and group mar- riage by Lewis Morgan upon which Engels began his book. As evaluation, Freud's social essays stand, even after their anthro- pological shorings have buckled beneath them. We may recall what perceptive critics in the last century, like James Martineau and T. H. Green, pointed out repeatedly: that evolutionist argu- ment always shrinks from saying a thing is something, and instead prefers to report that it began in a certain way. Freud's idea of primal history - added to his psychological Lamarckianism - gives another example of the frequently tortuous attempts made in nineteenth-century evolutionary ethics to escape saying that man has a nature, and that it is largely a destructive one. Man begins as a killer, Freud argued. Society begins with a crime. If, to paraphrase Feuerbach, we must look to the manner in which such minds disclose the origin of a thing in order to find their attitude toward it, then we find it is chiefly Freud's elaborate description of the origin of society in a "primal crime" that dis- closes his basic attitude toward the history of society as a murder mystery, and toward human nature as murderous. In this sense the critical aims of psychology and anthropology were justly fused by Freud. His psychology sought to import into our sentimen- talizing on civilized human nature as harsh a truth as anthropology sought to import, by its revelations of the primitive, into our</page><page sequence="17">444 SOCIAL RESEARCH complacent sense of the progress of modern social institutions and familial customs. In anthropology Freud recognized a great polemical discipline subjoining his own, equally intent on pressing what it gauged unacceptable to the pride of civilization. Every- thing of Freud's, from his child psychology to his political psychology, is affected by the attitude veiled in this romance of origins. The quiet doctor living above a butcher shop in Vienna invented a myth of human existence as terrifying as any of those he loved to read in world literature. If he was wrong, his error was a great error. Better great errors than small truths; but perhaps, to borrow Freud's own borrowing from Polonius ("Con- structions in Analysis," p. 363), his bait of falsehood snared a carp of truth. Freud's "scientific myth" of the primal father serves other, more surprising purposes when the historical argument is consigned to a proper irrelevance and the evaluative function is exhibited alone. Totem and Taboo, where the collective prototype is first broached, is in large part a treatise on the origins of religion. Freud's origin myth of the primal father discloses his own left-handed admiration for monotheistic religion, and offers Jewish monotheism the most pervasive of modern legitimations: that of psychological truth. (This was a subject daringly amplified in his last completed book, Moses and Monotheism.) If the first father was God, then other Gods are later, and corruptions. Freud was thus at odds with the commonly held view, according to which religion begins in polytheism - the worship of vague, plural, local spirits with limited powers - and only after a long process of ethical mastery and intellection attains to the concept of a single deity. By beginning with the purest worship (of one father), from which humans regularly fall away, Freud contra- dicted the evolutionary optimism of both modern science and modernist religion.20 Totem and Taboo is a thoroughly evolu- 20 Nevertheless, a minority of scholars has supported the notion of a primitive monotheistic belief, antedating the Jewish or Babylonian or any recorded peoples.

Even Freud's Lamarckianism reflects this pessimism. While Adler favored Lamarck over Darwin because the former's teleology supported his own evolutionist optimism,21 Freud's version had a consistently gloomy cast. Not its teleological verve but that terri- fying metaphysical element of the theory which supposes, in William James' famous definition, "the same emotional propensi- ties, the same habits, the same instincts, [to be] perpetuated without variation from one generation to another" 22 appealed to Freud. While Lamarck, like Darwin, offered the "serviceability" of certain emotional forms and accidentally produced tendencies to action as the "reason" for their persistence, in Freud archaic and individual memories are neither efficient nor serviceable; once acquired, they persist in the individual (and through the genera- tions) as the final cause of neurotic misery. Because he understood the past as the direction of faith, faith seemed to Freud always a quality of one's relation to the past - rather, of one's bondage to it. In the Freudian schema, religion - as the most powerful bondage to the past - is one equivalent to illness. Like a good positivist, Freud did not entirely despair at the sense of dependence most people feel in regard to some higher Christian anthropology of Ratzel and his pupil Frobenius discovered the towering figure of one god everywhere on the "culture horizons" of the most archaic peoples. A similar notion of a primordial monotheism, from the secular anthropological point of view, was put forth by Andrew Lang, in his Magic and Religion, published in 1901. And the Jesuit scholar Father Schmidt, in his massive work on the Origins of the Idea of God (the first volume of which was issued the same year as Freud's Totem and Taboo), asserted the remains of an original monotheism among the primitives, adding that as the result of some sort of primeval guilt ^the pure idea of God had been forgotten, degenerating into the farrago of magico-authoritarian beliefs that we now understand as primitive religion. 21 Adler, in his Social Interest (London 1938) p. 270, wrote: "Lamarck's view, which is more akin to our own [than that of Darwinism], gives up proofs of the creative energy that is inherent in every form of life. The universal fact of the creative evolution of all living things can teach us that a goal is appointed for the line of development in every species - the goal of perfection, of active adaptation to the cosmic demands." 22 William James.

"It is . . . humiliating," he wrote (Civilization and its Discontents, pp. 23-24), "to discover what a large number of those alive today, who must see that this religion is not tenable ... try to defend it inch by inch, as if with a series of pitiful rearguard actions." But Freud was not only concerned to describe the power of the past; he also hoped to prescribe the model of emancipation from it. He used the "scientific myth" of origins as an intellectual weapon to break the hold of origins over human conduct. Through the scientific myth he was able, as he said in Group Psychology . . . (p. 112), to "specify the point in the mental development of man at which the advance from group to individual psychology was also achieved by the individual members of the group." Perhaps the scientific myth finally would free the individual psychology from its thralldom to primal forms. Freud may have been allud- ing to Frazer's definition of myth, as the earliest mode of scientific cognition, when he offered the scientific myth somewhat face- tiously as a substitute for the prototype. "Does not every science," he asked Albert Einstein in 1932 ("Why War?," p. 283), "come in the end to a kind of mythology?" But the mythology of science is radically different from other sorts. All modern scientific myths are myths of revolt against transcendence, and in Freud this revolt took the curious form of a critique against a transcendence dropped into the depths - as the prototype. Freud took development for granted. That children become adults, the lower the higher, the simple the complex, the unknown the known - these he sensed were optimistic commonplaces with which science no less than religion had endowed modern thought. His desire was always to find in emergence, sameness; in the dynamic, the static; in the present, persistences of the past. The analogy between individual and society was one way of stabilizing the evolutionary scheme, by viewing it structurally.28 With the 28 For a statement on the importance of analogy in Freud's method, see two articles by myself: "The Meaning of History and Religion in Freud's Thought/' in Journal of Religion, vol. 31, no. s (April 1951) pp. 114-3»; »nd "History, Psycho- analysis, and the Social Sciences," in Ethics, vol. 63, no. 2 (January 1953) pp. 107-so.</page><page sequence="20">THE AUTHORITY OF THE PAST 447 conception of the prototype, he read the same permanence in temporal relations. Psychoanalysis, to him, was a retrospective science, never a predictive one.24 Understanding was not available except from the perspective of the patient's entire life history. To comprehend a set of events and attitudes, the layers of the patient's memory were not successively and genetically but simul- taneously and logically linked. Therapy proceeded by collating an indefinite number of references and cross-references which, organized analogically and prototypically, were related to one another independent of their time sequence. Thus, for example, Freud attached the Oedipus complex and religious phenomena not to temporal developments but to structural relations, that is, to the familial, whose form persists even through changes of social context. Here Freud recognized a natural morality, interpreting the familial obligation as the primal form of all morality. It was an idea he found in The Religion of the Semites, only transmuting (in conformity with his pessimist temper) Robertson Smith's blood fellowship into a bloody brotherhood. Since the material of therapy does, however, appear in a time sequence (as the patient relates it), Freud came to develop modes of breaking up and transforming the material, in order to conform with his essential fiction of the timeless unconscious. With the notion of a linear string of events eliminated, Freud employed both analogies and the concept of prototypes as a way of seeing similarities between differences, not, as in other modes, a way of distinguishing similarities. Of course, the two tools of Freud's method have differing impli- cations. By locating in individual and social life the instinctual strife in the cosmos, he proclaimed the repetitiveness of human life and the constancy of nature-history; by analogizing society to the individual, Freud presumed the doctrine of the evolu- tion of society. In the one attitude, directed by the concept of the prototype, time is seen as the cyclical return of the ever- 2* See Freud's extended remarks on this in a clinical essay, "The Psychogenesis of a Case of Homosexuality in a Woman," translated by Barbara Low and R.

In the other attitude, directed by the method of analogy, time is a unilinear, unidirectional line of progress. The symbolic meaning of feminine and masculine, the images of the circle and the ascending line, the moods of pessimism and optimism - these express Freud's basic attitudes and characterize his rich contra- dictions. So far as one can describe Freud's more consistent attitude, I should stress his pessimism. His hopes for reason and even some evolutionary progress are quite accountable within his generally acute sense of the limits of development. Freud's primary process- image - what we have called "cosmological" - is horizontal and conservative. He saw coursing through nature "uninterruptedly two kinds of process of opposite direction, one anabolic, assimila- tory, the other katabolic, disintegrating." 25 But Freud iound no consolation in this "oscillating rhythm," this instinctual eternal recurrence. It meant to him that humans were still killers, and that war was not a setback, temporary and unfortunate, but part of the circular motion of social development. The manifold of events only reproduced the primitive prototypes. There was noth- ing new in history, as, analogously, "the experiences of the first five years of childhood exert a decisive influence on our life . . . and . . . resist all efforts of more mature years to modify them" (Moses and Monotheism, p. 198). Even the one hope, the primacy of the intellect, was secretly linked with the "death instinct"; here Freud, the positivist evolu- tionist, met Freud, the romantic conservative. The line of evolution, if drawn far enough, ends in the same place as the circle of origins. Freud's evolutionary history is as unfree as his idea of nature-history. Ethically, the two aspects of Freudian method (analogy and prototype) end in identity: both constructs are doctrines of fatalism. I have said that Freud was a romantic conservative, and perhaps the essential fact that united romantic conservatives across the eighteenth century and into the nineteenth is that they did not fancy revolutions. Revolution could only 25 Beyond the Pleasure Principle, translated by C. J. M.

The French Revolution and all its outworks have become the great divide of political doctrine, and Freud stood with the conservatives, opposed to all revolutions. This is not to say that he venerated the past. On the contrary, he respected a certain type of past: not the ages of order so much as the ages of heroes; Greeks, not Latins or Catholics; Semites, not Jews. Bismarck, the towering figure of his youth, is never men- tioned in his writings, no more than most contemporaries, heroic or not. Only great heroic figures of the antique past (such as Moses and Hannibal) appear to illustrate his values and doctrine. Indeed, for Freud, the study of the present as autonomous would be a form of fantasy. It would be to "experience the present naively, so to speak, without being able to estimate its content." 2e Freud's well known pessimism as a social thinker must be approached in terms of his model of recurrent time, as against the openness of a qualitatively different future. There was to him nothing qualitatively different beyond this life and this way of life. His answer to any failure of the future to be qualitatively different from the past must be the great jibe of all disdain of the future: not "I told you sol" but, more quietly, "I could have told you so." All observable presents point to the past. Memory is a temptation, offering greater delights than the present. There is no relief, either in succumbing to the temptation or in subduing it. Relief - catharsis - is only the sense of transition. The content of human rationality is to face up to the comfortless world as it was, is, and will be. Freud's temper was stoical. This does not, of course, disqualify the prophetic element in Freud's mission. Rather, the prophet compounded the stoic. Both prophet and stoic have as their chief life duty the mainte- nance of self-identity in the face of threatening forces. Both propose life in a permanent crisis state, and the stoic function of Freud's crisis psychology is the day-to-day maintenance of self- identity. 2* The Future of an Illusion, translated by W. D. Robson -Scott (London 1943) p. 8.</page><page sequence="23">45O SOCIAL RESEARCH Freud's orientation was in another way close to the prophetic temper. The function of a crisis psychology, as of prophets, is to heighten the sense of threat and fear in the face of uncontrolled changes, and to offer a control: hope as the psychic state supplied by adhering to tradition, with the prophet as instructor. Freud, in this sense, was on the side of tradition. For him the "past" constituted the most stable part of the present. Tradition was never remote, but in continuous process of reassertion. He sought to remind people of it, and of its importance. But Freud's prophetism must not be labored too far. To be a prophet is to assert that there is no way out of tradition, not to try systematically to abort it. And Freud's end, processionally and valuationally, was to abort tradition for the sake of a per- sonality type unknown to history thus far, the psychological man - man emancipated by rational analysis from commitments to the prototypical past.</page></plain_text>
