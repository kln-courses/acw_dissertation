<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CONCEPT OF TIME IN THE RELIGIOUS PHILOSOPHY OF MUHAMMAD IQBAL BY ALESSANDRO BAUSANI Rome The bibliography on Muhammad Iqbal has registered a signifi- cant increase, both in Indopakistan and Europe 1 in the last few years, especially after the foundation of Pakistan (I947), which considers I. its national poet. Though the works published are many in quantity, their quality is often inadequate - those by Easterners are indiscriminately laudatory in character and often mere imita- tions of each other 2, while many of those written by Westerners are still tainted, either consciously or not, by a colonialistic bias. On the one hand I. is hailed as an almost infallible "prophet" and "master"; on the other hand he is studied, with a certain ill-conceal- 1 For a partial bibliography on I. see the introduction to my Italian translation of Gdvedndma: Muhammad I qb al, II Poema Celeste.

Nicholson's translation of AsrLr-i Hudi (Lahore reprint I950), the second edition of "Reconstruction" (Oxford, 1934, Lahore re- print 1951), some of prof. Arberry's translations etc. Both in Karachi and Lahore "Iqbal Academies" (Bazm-i Iqbcl) have been founded: that of Lahore is publishing an interesting quarterly journal Iqbal (started in I952) devoted not only to the study of Iqbal's art and thought but also of any subject which might have interested Iqbal and can interest his students general: philosophy, theology, European and Oriental literatures etc. 2 There are of course good exceptions: I found S. A. Vah id's Iqbal, His Art and Thought (Lahore, I948 2) and Bashir Ahmad Dar's A study in Iqbal's philosophy (Lahore, 1944) especially useful.</page><page sequence="2">THE CONCEPT OF TIME IN MUHAMMAD IQBAL ed awe but with no real living participation, just as an aspect of the revival of Muslim peoples-a phenomenon to be scientifically analyzed, even in a sympathetic spirit, but never to be felt and accepted on a par with similar schools of thought in Europe 1. Another difficulty confronting those who intend to define his thought is I.'s peculiar form of expression: I. deals with poetical subjects in terms of philosophy, and viceversa, and maintains that the whole of his conception is Islamic, a derivation from Islam. So the Pakistani 2 philosopher-poet often develops theories that are both bold and extremely productive philosophically only to drop them when carrying them to their logical consequences would take him out of the Muslim orthodoxy 3. To this orthodoxy he always manages to return thanks to poetical-philosophical detours that, clever as they may be, are not in all instances thoroughly defensible on logical grounds. The object of this paper is to analyze and describe one of the leitmotivs of I.'s religious philosophy, the con- cept of Time, freeing it from purely poetical imagery and the more or less unnatural ties with what I. believed to be the strict tradition of Islam. Time, a central concept in any religious philosophy, is even more so in I.'s theistic system 4. Before approaching the subject we must, however, be willing to accept I.'s philosophy on the same basis, at the start, as any European system, not as a matter of curiosity for scholars. The fundamental passages for an insight into the idea of Time in Iqbal are the following: This defect is particularly apparent in papers like that by A. Jeffery, II modernismo musulmano dell'indiano "Sir" Mohammad Iqbdl in Or.Mod., XIV, 1934, pp. 505-5I3. 2 I know well that, as the state of Pakistan was created only in 1947, to call I. a "Paki- stani" may seem rather anachronistic. But he is now considered the National Poet of Paki- stan and he was one of its advocates: so I don't find illogical to maintain this attribution, generally used in Pakistan. [See James D. Brown, The History of Islam in India III in MW XXXIX, I949, p. I87: "In his presidential address at the session of the All-India Muslim League in Allahabad in I930, ... I., ... had said, '... The formation of a conso- lidated North-West Indian Muslim State appears to me to be the final destiny of the Muslims. . .' " (Islamic Culture, XIII, p. 499), and the pamphlet "Now or Never" in WI XV, I933, p. 47: "... While he, i.e. I., proposed the amalgamation of these Provinces into a single state forming a unit of the All-India Federation, we propose that these Provinces should have a separate Federation of their own".

Shorter passages from poems and other works which will be quoted individually in due time. The core of I.'s conception of Time can be briefly outlined as follows: I. starts with a criticism of the conception of Time as "another dimension" as suggested by Einstein's system, which is for instance to be found in the theories of several modem mystics or pseudomystics 3. According to I., Time thus conceived actually becomes space. Everything is already predetermined therein- "events do not happen; we just meet them" (Lect. 53). Just as a would-be monodimensional or bidimensional being could only apprehend the other dimension as succession in time, so, according to the theory which I. criticizes, a possible fourth dimension appears to us as a succession of clusters of events in time. Time would there- fore be an "imperfectly sensed space-dimension". Such a conception of Time is acceptable if by Time we only mean serial time. I., however, takes up again Bergson's conception, that such a serial time, however useful a tool in the field of natural science and essential in a purely mechanistic Weltanschauung, is utterly inadequate to explain the innermost experiences of our consciousness. In the inner- most self conscious states melt into each other, and cannot be count- ed, as they are devoided of any numerical character-they are purely qualitative. In this pure duration, free from any space ele- ments, which we apprehend, there are no reversible instants, con- trary to what could be posited once the other conception of Time as a dimension of space was accepted. The second edition of this book was published in Oxford, I934, and contains a new chapter Is religion possible ?, being the text of a lecture delivered by I. at the "Aristotelian Society" in London. A review of this book (by R. Paret) can be read in OLZ I935, 531 ff., a review of the first Oxford edition of I928 (by G. Kampffmeyer) in WI XV, 1933, I22.

In his opinion Bergson's fallacy is to make too clearcut a distinction between the alan vital and spatializing rational thinking. There is something vitalistic about thinking itself, according to I.; on the other hand he claims that if we deny all teleological character to the elan vital the final result will be chaos. Bergson would answer this criticism contending that if we admit a teleology of the elan vital the primordial freshness of -his duree would be nullified. I. admits that this objection holds true as long as teleology is meant as the acting out of a plan in view of a predetermined purpose; such a religious predestinationism would hardly differ from the mecha- nistic determinism he already rejected. Such a determinism, even if clothed up as religious and spiritualistic, would be actually just one form of materialism, destroying the freedom of both man and God. Then what ? The originality of I.'s solution to this impasse shows the philosophical productivity of a sound personalistic theism. This solution we must now analyze in detail for it stands out as a central element in I.'s religious thought. According to I., teleology can be understood differently, not as a mechanic but as a vitalistic-creative process - "the movement of the universe in time is certainly devoid of purpose, if by purpose we mean a foreseen end... A time process cannot be conceived as a line already drawn: it is a line in the drawing (Lect. 74; italics mine). Universe may grow 2; it is not a full-grown product that came out of the hands of its Maker several million years ago and now lies idle in space, as a dead mass of matter that is nothing, for Time can do nothing to it. Yet if we are to get out of that impasse while maintaining Bergson's conception of duree, we are necessarily led to postulate the existence of such a personalistic and psycholo- gical duration in a Person, a self, an "all-embracing concrete Self". According to I. Bergson was mistaken in that he considered pure time as preceding the Person, of whom alone both duration and 6lan vital can be predicated. Neither pure space nor pure time are enough to keep the multiplicity of objects and events together. 1 It seems to me that I.'s discussion of Bergson is chiefly based on Essai sur les donnies immidiates de la conscience, leaving apart some aspects of the latest developments of Berg- son's thought. 2 Cfr. Qur'an 35 : : "He adds to His creation what He wills." i6i</page><page sequence="5">A. BAUSANI It is only the appreciative act by a lasting Self that can grasp the multiplicity of nature broken into numberless instants, and build it up together into a full, organic synthesis. Thus, while in the Greek and pantheistic Hindoo thought time is bound to things visible, the only escape from it being off at a tangent through the mystical act of self-annihilation, here an element of time is boldly introduced into the very heart of God, i.e. of that supreme Self that alone can rightfully say "I am". To exist in this non-serial time 1 means to master destiny itself, or rather to be at the center of destiny, which can be defined as preserial time, a "time regarded as prior to the disclosure of its possibilities" (Lect. 67). It also means, therefore, to create, and from this special point of view each moment of the life of reality is original, unpredictable. To the supreme Self the not- self appears not as another one confronting him, for if this were the case the supreme Self would necessarily be, like our own finite selves, in a spatial relationship with the other one. "What we call nature or the not-self is only a fleeting moment in the life of God" (Lect. 76). There is no danger, however, of falling back into an all-embracing pantheism for the very reason that there is time in God and the opposite assumption (i.e. God is nature) is impossible: nature is but a "habit of God", an expression that I. borrows from the Qur'an (sunnat Alldh). Nature is therefore finite only at this moment of the life of God. Since, however, the Self it is organically related to 2 is creative, nature can grow, and is consequently infinite in the sense that none of its limits is final -nature is organ- ically finite only towards the innermost essence of God: Innd ila rabbika al-muntaha 3. I. definitely stresses that "time is an essential element in the ultimate Reality"(Lect. 77). Is then God 1 A non-serial time which would become serial i.e. distinguished in countable and numer- able instants when projected into spacial molds. 2 I. expressly says that the relation of Nature to God is similar to that between character and the individual to which it refers. So God must be known through Nature. Contrary to mystics, I. maintains that the way leading to the "Essence" passes through "Exteriority". Exteriority, too, dzhir and not only bdtin, is important religiously. 3 Cfr. Qur'an 53 :43 wa anna ild rabbika 'l-muntaha. I. translates: "and verily towards God is thy limit". This is a good instance of a characteristic habit of I.: that of interpreting in modern terms some Qur'anic passages which no doubt mean something else if literally translated. So here it seems that a literal translation would amount simply to say that every being's end is in God, a return to God (through death and Final Judgement). However, the metaphysical implications I. wants to find in the verse are in no wise, in my opinion, contrary to the spirit of the Qur'an. I62</page><page sequence="6">THE CONCEPT OF TIME IN MUHAMMAD IQBAL subject to change? Such is the shocked objection that may rise from some quarters. I. counters that: I -there ought to be nothing strange in this attitude for those who have been brought up in a religious spirit based on the Qur'an, a text which portrays a most active, changing and living God, in defiance of all classical, Greek- inspired interpretations of God as pure act and Motor Immobilis. 2-change must not be construed spatially to mean serial change. ,,The Not-yet of man means quest and possibly failure. The Not-yet of God means infallible realizing apprehension of the infinite creative possibilities of His own self, which keeps its entirety throughout the process. Every self, and by way of analogy also the supreme Self, may be considered to consist of two aspects-appreciative self and efficient self. The appre- ciative self lives in pure duration, i.e. change without succession. The life of the self consists in its movement from appreciation to efficiency, from intuition to intellect. Serial, atomic time, i.e. a discontinuous series of moments, stems from this movement. Thus the time of God's Self appears as a change without succession, as an organic whole that seems atomic and serial because of the creative movement of the self. To put it in the words of classical theology, serial time is born with the act of creation through which the supreme Self realizes and measures, as it were, the infinite wealth of its own indeterminate creative possibilities". God, therefore, just like our own selves, lives both in eternity (i.e. non-serial change, according to I.) and in serial time; it should be noted that to I. the former means non-successional change, while the latter is organically related to eternity in so far as it is the measure of eternity (Lect. IOI-II) 1. A poetical attempt to portray life in the non-serial time of the World beyond Creation, Goethe's "sanftes Wandeln deines Tags" can be found in a passage of his GdvJdndma (transl. pp. 131 &amp; ff.; text pp. 178 &amp; ff.): "I stepped past the boundaries of Creation, over into the World that hath no dimension. A world with no right and no left, devoid of nights and days. Therein flickered off the candle- like flame of my understanding, and, frightened by the Meaning, the Word died away. It is with tongue of water and mud that the Spirit speaks: to fly within a cage is hard. So push thy gaze farther into the World of the Heart, wherewith thy sight be enlightened by the light of the Self. What is the Heart ? A world colourless, scentless and therefore devoid of dimensions: a world still and yet wandering for ever, a world of feelings and thoughts. From truth unto truth doth step the Mind, and his going hath no path, no steps, no vehicle. A hundred images, and they are wide asunder-the one conversing with heaven, the other weak and inept. No one sayeth that the one that knoweth Heaven is at the right of the one that is but powerless imagination, nor that the joy coming from the sight of the Beloved one is a half step off from the air of his path! Whether thy eye be awake or asleep, thy Heart sees without the sunbeams' help. Know then that this World is even higher than the World of the Heart. What shall I say of that which nothing resembleth ? In that universe is ano- ther creation, originated by another fiat. Eternal, yet in perpetual change, it reacheth not imagination, yet it reacheth the sight. Ever again it [this creation] attaineth a new perfec- It is interesting, and I. reinarks it, that theologians, imbued with Aristotelian culture, found it difficult to accept or to explain one of the most religiously important attributes of God, that of Life, so clearly stated both in the Bible and the Qur'an (Lect. 80, where Ibn Hazm's hesitation to predicate life of God is emphasized). I63</page><page sequence="7">A. BAUSANI tion, a new beauty. Therein Time doth without moon and sun, all the nine heavens fall within its space. All that is in the world beyond appeareth, face unto face, even before the desire can blossom in thy heart. How am I ever to tell with my tongue of this world of light, of presence, of life? Tulips gently stirring on the mountains, water-streams flowing amid rose-bushes! Red, white, purple buds blossoming up under the pure breathing of the Saints! Waters of silver, breezes of sweetly-scented amber, castles with lofty domes of emerald! Ruby-coloured pavillions with strings of gold, fair maidens with nimble bodies shining like mirrors of light! Said Rfimi 1 unto me - 'O thou that takest pains to find analogies, give up all analogies taken from the world of the senses. It is from the external manifestation that all things beautiful and ugly stem out, the one taking up the shape of hell, the other of paradise. Such colourful castles as thou beholdest are made of actions, not of bricks and rock. What thou callest Kawtar, divine youths and h.iris are but reflexes of this world of ecstasy and joy. Life here is but Vision, blissful vision and Word and no more' ". The logical consequences of this philosophical-religious position involve the most important questions of theology. Our main task, however, is to show the new light I.'s position throws on the con- cepts of creation, history and community, destiny and free will, death and immortality. A quick glance at the way these problems are stated and solved in the light of I.'s conception of Time, will also give a better insight into those aspects of I.'s thought we have so far unsufficiently dealt with. i. Creation. "With his (Iraqi's) view that Divine Time is utterly devoid of change-a view obviously based on an inadequate analysis of conscious experience--it was not possible for him to discover the relation between Divine Time and serial Time, and to reach through this discovery the essentially Islamic idea2 of continuous creation, which means a growing universe" (Lect. I92). Likewise in another passage (Lect., new edition, Lahore, 195I, p. 184), concerning the experience of coming into contact with Divine Time: "It can embody itself only in a world-making or world- shaking act; and in this form alone the content of this timeless experience can diffuse itself in the time movement and make itself effectively visible to the eye of history". Cosmogonic serial time is thus in a way conceived as an instru- ment of creation; creation in turn can be understood only in so far as there exists a time tension or vibration within the very person of God. Now, the existence within Eternity itself of this tension or 1 Maulana galal ad-Din Rfmi (I207-I273) is I.'s Vergile in his 6advedndma, and one of the great personalities of Islam I. loved most. In Asrdr (text p. 8; transl. p. 5) he says: "I am a wave and I will come to rest in his sea; that I may make the glistening pearl mine own". This description of a transcendent and yet not time-less world has a striking analogy with the well known mazdaic idea of the menok world. 2 This is what I. says. I think that the idea is also Biblical. I64</page><page sequence="8">THE CONCEPT OF TIME IN MUHAMMAD IQBAL reaching out towards a continuous Not-yet or Beyond, involves a con- sequence which is one of the outstanding characteristics of I.'s religious thought, i.e. the non-fixity of this universe, its opening towards ever new creative possibilities. This is possible because the process is one of creation, not of emanation from a given, immovable, unchangeable substance, however inexhaustible. Emanation is related to a conception of divine substance as something outside of time, creation being a detour of the divine substance through the darkness of Time, followed either by reabsorption into the principle or by final loss. Emanationism thus posits space prior to time. In I.'s concept of Time, on the other hand, time is prior to space; it is the creative mold of the unfolded spaces of creation. Such a conception of a creation perpetually open towards future may however lead to an assumption that would seriously impair the orthodoxy of Islam, so it is no wonder that I. rejected it express- ly 1; the assumption is that an ever creative God may establish other historical religious communities after that of Muhammad 2 along a line perpetually open and reaching out towards what lies ahead. In I.'s own words (Lect. I96), "History as a continuous movement in time is a genuinely creative movement and not a movement whose path is already determined". No wonder, therefore, that I. makes Tahira and Hallag, the "heretics" of his Paradise, utter significant words, concerning the new creations that come out from Man once he is centered in Divine Time. So Tahira says: 1 This specially in his pamphlet Islam and Ahmadism with a reply to questions raised by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. Lahore, Anjuman-i-Khuddam ud-Din, 1936. The idea is however clearly expressed in Lect. 176 where I. writes: "In Islam prophecy reaches its perfection in discovering the need of its own abolition". 2 Cfr. (dv. p. 91-92, transl. p. 85: "The mention of the holy name of God is free from time and space, it needs not Syrian nor Greek! If God takes away from us His Name, He can propose it to another People. From Moslems I saw only blind imitation and false imaginations ... I fear lest one day they will be deprived of His Holy name, and God will kindle His fire in other hearts!" It is not difficult to follow this idea in other works of Iqbal too. So we find in Armagdn-i Ijigdz, Lahore, 1948 4 p. i8: "The moslems are intoxicated with debased poverty, wrapped in dirty beggar-clothes; their works cause Gabriel to weep. Come! let us found another Millat (Religious community), for this Millat has become a burden to the world!" In the same book (published in 1938, after the death of Iqbal), at page I25, the longing for an expected Renovator of Islam is also deeply felt and passionately sung. i65</page><page sequence="9">A.

Thus speaks Tahira, the Babi heroine 1, but I. seems here to show an unusual sympathy for one of his characters. In this canto of the Heretics, which is one of the most interesting in Gdv. 2, I. is keenly aware of the problem of the absolute creativeness of Spirit. The problem can be stated as follows-if the time vibration which is within the very heart of Eternity results in the creative production of ever new worlds and spiritual realities reaching out for the future, how can this agree with the spiritual fixity of a religion that was revealed definitely once and for all? Are new revealers (within time) possible ? Have the possible inhabitants of other worlds in the infinity of space received the same, historically determined Muslim revelation ? In the infinity of the innermost spirit can not man as a creator become God himself? Each of the three heretics in the heaven of Jupiter answer one of these questions as I. meets them in his heavenly wandering. Tahira answers the first question 3, and her answer seems to be I.'s own too; she says that divine revelation cannot disappear from the world, and though this view is sinful in the eyes of orthodox Islam, yet "out of the error of the servant mad creations may stem forth ever anew". The second question is answered by (alib 4, who says that every world in space, including those we do not know, has its own reveal- ers of the Divinity, its own prophets; he says no more, however, 1 On this interesting personality see the general works on the Babi and Baha'i Move- ments (short bibliographyin EI1 s.v. Bab and Baha' Allah) and the now very rare book: Martha R o o t, Tdhirih the Pure, Iran's greatest woman, Karachi, 1938, which contains the Persian text of various poems of her. 2 "Heretics" is here taken in the Islamic sense of deniers of Muhammad's Prophetie Mission, or of its finality. 3 I follow here rather a "logical" order. In the text I.'s doubts are solved first by IHallag, then by Tahira and (alib. 4 Mirza Asadu 1llah Calib (I797-I869), perhaps the greatest name in Urdu literature. He was not specially interested in religious topics and I still wonder why I. has chosen him as a representative of heretic thought. I66</page><page sequence="10">THE CONCEPT OF TIME IN MUHAMMAD IQBAL in the fear of falling into blasphemy: the solution set forth a few verses below, of an eternal Muhammad, a Logos similar to the Eternal Christ, is little more than a theologian's trick. To the third question Hallag answers that man can attain boundless power and creativeness only if he first becomes God's servant: Hallg's and 'l-haqq must be preceded by a deep understanding of the ex- pression banda-e Hudd, servant of God. 2. History and Community. Pondering on the unfolding of the World's Time out of Divine Time leads us to the core of ano- ther problem-the appraisal of history and community, as the former is always a history of communities. It is here assumed that the only kind of community that is both serious and possible is religious. Concerning the Muslim historian Ibn Haldiin, I. maintains (Lect. I96) that in view of the "keen sense of the reality of time and the concept of life as a continuous movement in time" which he considers typical of Islam, "only a Muslim could have viewed history as a continuous collective movement, a real inevitable development in time". On the other hand history, to be such and obey the vibra- ting creativeness that stems from Divine Time, must be a "genuine- ly creative movement", not a movement the course of which was determined in advance. It is therefore all-important that the movement of history (i.e. of time as it is unfolded) be not understood as a circle, a cycle that in the end shall necessarily return to its starting point, as in Greek philosophy. "Whatever, in fact, may be the criterion by which to judge the forward steps of a creative movement, the movement itself, if conceived as cyclic, ceases to be creative. Eternal recurrence is not eternal creation: it is eternal repetition" (Lect. I97). Now in this genuinely creative flowing of his- tory I. perceives something like a stable point-what a unique Christ, who is both historical and metahistorical, is to orthodox Chris- tianity, the Muslim community is to I. In I.'s opinion the Muslim community, based as it is on a rigidly monotheistic intuition of the unity of God (ld ildh illd 'lldh) cannot be evidently limited in space- being the vicar of God on earth, it reigns, de facto as well as de jure, wherever God reigns (Rumnuz, pp. 29 &amp; ff.; text pp. I29 &amp; ff.). For I., however, this community is not limited in time either, as it has its deepest roots in the God that vibrates with creative time (Rumiz, transl. pp. 33 &amp; ff.; text I35 &amp; ff.). One may object that I67</page><page sequence="11">A. BAUSANI this theory would be statical, sneaking back again a kind of unchangeable fixity into the all-creating flow or time. I. counters that Islam is substantially tauhzd, or affirmation of the unity of God, and the visible social organism is, from the point of view of Islam, but an "endeavour to transform these ideal principles into spacetime forces" (Lect. 216). Thus Islam, an eminently assimilating religion 1, once the principle of God's unity is safeguarded in all its aspects, would not go against the idea of a change and creative- ness of ever new realities that must rule through the historical time. One can agree with I. that the fixity of the sari'a is only a secondary fact (Lect. 229) 2 and formerly there was practically "no written law of Islam apart from the Quran" (Lect. 230); the fact remains, however, that in Rumiiz such an ideal Islam is concretely described in well-defined institutions-the time-honoured precepts of the sart'a, Mecca as the visible center of the community, the five canonical prayers, etc. It is not only the affirmation of the unity of God, but also this Islam, concrete and historical 3, that is consid- ered unchangeable in time. This is doubtless the central contra- diction in I.'s thought 4 (this does not mean that I am belittling the importance of his philosophy-no philosophy has ever been free from contradictions). My assumption is not, however, that a divine, visible law is not necessary to man as organized in society; I agree with the following verses of Rumn z (text pp. I39-I40, transl. p. 27) proving very well that a mold, or a law or set of institutions is necessary in matters religious if one is to avoid the only too easy dissolution that threatens all kinds of liberalism: 1 I. emphasizes this side of Islam, and quotes (Lect. 229) Horten as supporter and defender of the assimilative spirit of Islamic culture (cfr. M. Horten, Die kulturelle Entwicklungs- fihigkeit des Islam auf geistigem Gebiete, Bonn, z915, especially page I7). 2 It is known that I. had the idea of writing a "Reconstruction of Muslim Jurisprudence", on more or less the same lines as his "Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam" (cfr. S. A. Vahid, op. cit., p. 33). The notes and materials collected by I. for his unfinished work must be preserved in the library of the Iqbal Academy of Pakistan, and it would be a great service to the students of I. if some scholar could collect and publish them. 3 I. even says in Rumiz (text p. 143-45; transl. 40-42) that taqlid (i.e. strict conformity to fixed canon law) is better than firsthand personal study of the Holy Books, in times of decadence. 4 In my opinion there is another weak point in I.'s religious-philosophical system: the not too clear solution of the problem of the relation between finite egos and Absolute All- Embracing Ego (God).

What seems not to be in line with I.'s philosophy is rather the idea that just one concrete monotheistic religious law is chosen to be unchangeable and eternal. This would rather agree with a concept of Time as cyclical and limited, but it is not admissible in a philoso- phy that is meant to free historical time from the taint of "imper- fection" it has in pagan religions and tendentially pantheistic systems; in a philosopher who considers; the greatest of all sins to stop at one stage 1. Otherwise one would fall back into the traditio- nally Christian idea, which can be hardly called historical and pro- gressive, that the centuries prior to the historical appearance of Jesus were but a preparation to, and the centuries thereafter a development of, or decline from the only total manifestation of the Divinity, which took place in the years 1-33 A.D. 2. In I. the Christ-point in history is replaced by a community ruled by a Book, but this is all the same stopping at one stage, killing the movement. I.'s answer to such an objection 3 seems rather catchy to me: he maintains that Muhammad is the last of the prophets because these are no longer necessary, now that man has come of age. His attitude thus is to all appearances more progressive than that of his critics; but if the time of the prophets is over, it seems strange to think that therefore one ought for ever to comply with the legal precepts of the last in the series of the prophets, i.e. Muham- This is one of the leitmotivs of I.'s thought. Sentences like "on this road halt is out of place: a static condition means death", "every object lives by ceaseless striving", "life is killed by halting at a place" can be found almost in every page of I.'s poetic and prosaic works. A useful collection of I.'s statements on this subject in Tariq, op. cit., p. 266-67. a Many of the chronological calculations of different adventist sects in order to find out the time of the coming back of Christ and "the end of the world" were and are based on the idea that a more or less symmetrical time must precede and follow the central and unique event of history: the incarnation of God in Jesus. Also Martin Luther indulged in such calculations in his work written in I540: "Supputatio annorum mundi (Opera Omnia Witebergae, per Thomam Klug, I545-I558, t. VII, pp. 555-612) where he "hopes" the end of the world for the period between I540 and 2040. See p. I65, note I. I69</page><page sequence="13">A. BAUSANI mad's sary'a. In this way, far from outgrowing the age of prophecy, we actually link all the future development of mankind, with the result of determining it beyond any possibility of escape, with the prophet and his law which happen to be the last in time. 3. Destiny and Free Will. In this connection it is convenient to dwell a while on an implication of I.'s concept of Time by means of which he endeavors to solve the age-old problem of predestination versus free will. In Gav. (transl. pp. 43-44) Zurvdn 1, Time, sings to the Poet: ,,I am Zurvdn, the vanquisher of the World. Now I am concealed from man's sight, now I appear. In my will rests all decision-the silent, the talking, they are all my prey. My work is the bud blossoming out on the bough, and likewise the birdlings' weeping in their nests is my work. My flitting flight changeth the seed into a sprout, and all severance changeth into union through me. I am the carrier of reproach and exhortation, I make men thirsty to give them wine to drink. I am life, I am death, I am resurrection, I am the judg- ment, and hell and paradise and hturis am I. Men and angels alike are caught in my chains, the World of Transition is my child. Each flower that thou pickest from the bough is I, the mold of every thing that thou beholdest is I. The world is a prisoner within my charmed talisman, all this universe becometh older whenever I breathe. But whosoever hath these words firm in his heart: 'There is a time I pass with God' 2, he, that hero, can break my charm asunder. If thou willst rid thyself of nie, repeat out of thy innermost soul: 'There is a time I pass with God' ". This means that once he comes into contact with the Divine Time, man not only sees new, wonderful things, but, most of all, attains "divine power" (sultan 3) and can break the charms wrought by Destiny, through an absolute, creative act. Thus man can "ride the palfrey of Destiny" and of Time, as the stars say with envy, for they are nailed to the serial revolution of the spheres through time (Afkdr-i Angoum, in Payam-i Masriq, pp. I09-II). Thus Time be- comes a sword, as Imam Safi'i says (al-waqt saif; Asrdr, text, p. 80). I. once wrote a poem in Urdu, Taslim-u-Rizd, "Resignation" (in Zarb-i Kal7m, p. 49) which seems to me to be all-important for an understanding of his new concept of resignation to destiny: 1 Zurvdn or Zarvdn is the name for "time" in the mazdaic theology, which I. knew pretty well. The first part of his Development of Metaphysics in Persia (London, I908) treats briefly of Zoroastrian religious philosophy. Another impressive song on Time is to be found in Paydm-i Masriq, p. 102. An English translation of it is contained in R.A. Nichol- son's paper Iqbal's "Message of the East" in Islamica, I (Leipzig, I924), pp. II2-I24. 2 This is a well-known hadit often quoted by I.: li maCa &gt;lkih waqt ... ("I have a time with God of such sort that neither angel nor prophet is my peer"). 3 In this sense I. interprets, in (;dv. (text p. 15, transl. p. 38), Qur. 55 : 33 where sultan is generally rendered by European translators as "authorization" or similar, rather than "power". I70</page><page sequence="14">THE CONCEPT OF TIME IN MUHAMMAD IQBAL I7I "In every bough this subtle secret is revealed: buds and sprouts too have the feeling of the immensity of space! They rest not, piously content to thank God within the moist gaol of the earth. No! At every moment there is a seed quivering mad with the desire to burst forth in its growth. Shut ye not, then, the way to Action, alleging the 'exigencies of nature'! No! The meaning of 'resigning unto the Eternal' is far different. Dare grow, courageously dare. Not so narrow is space, o man of God, not so narrow is the kingdom of Heaven" 1. This is made possible by the fact that man does not resign himself to an immobile Aristotelian set of natural laws, but to a God that has a time bend within his vibrating personality, a God that does not demand a thing because by law this is, was and shall for ever be, but may change his mind, undergo transformations, say yes to man, nay, seek and love man Himself. This concept is adequately expressed, with a skilful use of husn-i tall's 2 of great beauty, in the following profound poem (Zabur-i cAg'am, pp. 132-133; 84-85 of Arberry's transl. Persian Psalms, Lahore, I948): We are gone astray from God; Parted from us, forlorn He is searching upon the road, He sighs with the breath of morn, For like us, He is need entire Within and out He doth stand, And the prisoner of desire.

On the tulip's petal He writes Great riot created He The message His heart indites, A creature of clay to see, Yea, and His voice is heard Fashioned the piercing view In the passionate song of the bird. To gaze upon mortal hue. 1 An Italian translation of this poem has been published by me together with other poems of I. in II Punto nelle lettere e nelle arti, Roma, II 3, 1953, pp. I6-21. It is curious enough to remark that one of the greatest Italian modern poets, Giovanni Pascoli (I855-1912) in one of his Primi Poemetti (first published in I897) entitled La grande aspirazione used similar images: Un desiderio che non ha parole v'urge, tra i ceppi della terra nera e la raggiante liberta del sole; voi vi torcete come chi dispera, alberi schiavi! Dispergendo al cielo l'ombra de' rami lenta e prigioniera, e movendo con vane orme lo stelo dentro la terra, sembra che v'accori un desiderio senza fine anelo. ,,Ali e non rami! Piedi e non errori ciechi di ignare radiche!" - poi dite con improvvisa melodia di fiori. 2 Husn-i tallil is the rhetoric figure we call aetiology. I.'s use of the classical tropes and rhetoric figures of the Muslim aesthetic "science", to express new ideas would deserve a deeper study, which could be especially important owing to the fact that I. is one of the very few Islamic poets who reached a real formal equilibrium between classical form and new contents of thought.</page><page sequence="15">A. BAUSANI He lay in the iris' fold Hidden in every grain Our loveliness to behold; Not yet is He known to man, Bright cup of the ardent gaze Though bright as the full moon's grace Whose glance is a hymn of praise! In cottage and street is His face. In our envelope all of dust The jewel of life is lost; Is it we, or Himself (0 say), This pearl that is gone astray? This idea of a mobile God who creates that He may see and love, marks the point where I.'s philosophy unknowingly approaches the most the concept of the Christian God of Saint John's Gospel, who "so loved the world that he gave his only-begotten Son". Resignation unto such a God, not Fate, is a source of power. "The Devil and Death alike tremble when confronted by the might of him who has some knowledge of [true] Destiny. Predestination (gabr) is the religion of the magnanimous, predestination is an overflowing strength to heroes. Ripe man become riper by the constraint of God, while to the unripe predestination is a sepulchral, deathly embrace" (Gdv., pp. III-II2). If the center of the spiritua- lity of the Qur'an is - and it is -- the personality of God, then, how- ever paradoxical it may seem, I.'s judgment is true that there is nothing farther from the Qur'an than the feeling of a predetermined universe. It is the heathen who say in the Qur'n: ,,We die and the Dahr only kills us" (Qur. 45: 23). To I., who is wont to quote a well-known hadit, ld tasubbu 'd-dahr, ad-dahr Alldh (,,don't vilify time, for Time is God"), the dahr is not only meant to kill. Man ought not to go through life, either in sadness or in a carpe diem mood, waiting for this fatal event to be automatically brought about by the dahr, but to live in deep joy, knowing that God is the mudahhir ad-dahr, the muqallib ad-dahr 1. To use Rimiz's own words 2, to worship Divine Time means to worship the sun', while to be fatalistic means to worship the masni', i.e. to feel God himself as 1 See a discussion of the above quoted hadit on dahr, with quotations from various Muslim thinkers in Dictionary of Technical Terms (Kassdf istilahat al-funun), Biblioth. Indica, Calcutta, I862: articles dahr, dahriyya, zaman, waqt. 2 Masnavi, III, 1360-61: sunC is God's act of making, masniuc the already made. About the significatio passiva of the divine act and the relations between this problem and Time see the interesting paper by H. Corbin, Le Temps cyclique dans le Mazdeisme et dans l'Ismadlisme, in Eranos-Jahrbuch, XX (I952), p. I89-I94. In a commentary to the Masnavi quoted in Dict. of Techn. Terms s. v. waqt a more or less "Iqbalian" distinction is made between the mystic who is ibn al-waqt, son of the time, subject to time, and the mystic who is abu 'I-waqt, father of the time, Lord of Time, or producer of divine time (creator).

This in turn means, after all, being muSrik, idolatrous, in the deeper sense of the word. 4. Death and Immortality. The passage from the Qur'an has been quoted where the heathen ascribe death to Time. Different solutions to the problem of Time, in fact, lead to different conclu- sions for another fundamental problem, that of death and immorta- lity 1. I.'s approach to and solution of this question is one of the most interesting and original contributions of his philosophy. If Time is serially infinite while all the matter that makes up the universe, however extended, is finite, one can but agree with Nietzsche that after numberless billions of years a combination identical with the present one will occur; then "Sirius and the spider" and man's smallest thoughts and all the events, great and small, of this universe will again be what they are now. Nietzsche's mistake, however, I. says, is to consider Time as an infinite series of events moving in a circle-in this case immortality does exist, but becomes an "absolutely intolerable" burden (Lect. I6o). But we have seen that true time, Divine Time, is a mold of ever new crea- tions; the total matter of the universe, therefore, is not finite but grows. On the other hand, modern scientific evolutionism, I. main- tains (Lect., new edit., p. 187), though speaking in terms of a con- tinuous development, instead of an eternal return, as Nietzsche did, is nevertheless too closely bound up with the study of one as- pect of reality, that of things that can be sensed and counted. This prevents science from stepping over the physical universe as it is now, as Nietzsche was in a way able to do with his idea of the Ubermensch. In I.'s own words ,,the modern man's secret despair hides itself behind the screen of scientific terminology" such as this: "There now appears to be no scientific basis for the idea that the present rich complexity of human endowment will ever be materially exceeded". This means, according to certain philosophers of history, that physical evolution has occurred, but is now replaced by history, but a history that is unable to outgrow itself to create new, higher values, to unfold the angel out of man. The reason for 1 The problem of the relation of Time to Death has been recently (I952) discussed by Prof. Helmuth Plessner of G6ttingen in his paper Uber die Beziehung der Zeit zum Tode in Eranos-Jahrbuch, XX (1952), pp. 349-86. I73</page><page sequence="17">I74 A. BAUSANI this is that the concept of evolution and development in modern science is bound up with a concept of Time that is essentially pre- monotheistic (or pre-islamic, as I. would wrongly say): Time, being separated from God, the Timeless one, the immobile Mover (or from nothingness according to materialistic science-which amounts much to the same thing) lacks that dlan vital that has inspired a more progressive idea of evolution into the spiiitualistic mysticism of Islam. This same idea is expressed in a splendid pas- sage from Riimi's Masnavm IV, 3637 ff.), which I. is fond of quoting with admiration: "First man appeared in the class of inorganic things next he passed therefrom into that of plants For years he lived as one of the plants remembering nought of his inorganic state so different And when he passed from the vegetative to the animal state he had no remembrance of his state as a plant Except the inclination he felt to the world of plants especially at the time of Spring and sweet flowers Like the inclination of infants towards their mothers which know not the cause of their inclination to the breast. Again the great Creator as you know drew man out of the animal into the human state Thus man passed from one order of nature to another till he became wise and knowing and strong as he is now Of his first soul he has now no remembrance and he will be again changed from his present soul". (Transl. by Iqbal). If it is Divine Time that is unfolding through man's evolutional time, then the arrow cast by God's hand reaches beyond all boun- daries. To keep the simile of the arrow, we can remark that here too I. takes sides with Rfimi (MasnavT, I, II43). Fikr-i md tiri-st az H4 dar havd "Our thoughts are an arrow He throws into the air dar havd kay pdyad? dyad tid Hudd How can it remain in the air?

The Qur'an in fact "does not contemplate complete liberation from finitude as the highest stadium of human bliss" (Lect. I63). Besides, immortality, the highest and most serious privilege, cannot be everybody's lot by right, as if the soul qua soul, by a law of nature, were to be immortal (such is the classical Greek demonstration of immortality in Phaedo). Only tlose who have grasped the meaning of the angelical evolutional Time and can harden their personality (I. borrows this word from Nietzsche) 1 can pass the final test of atemporal repaganization of man's personality that is death. Death "may mean dissolution" to the weak (Lect. I67), whereas it is a cry of victory to those who have been able to make their self ada- mant-hard, to fix their gaze into God without turning their head 2 and being annihilated by God's encompassing personality. A fanci- ful, but clear illustration of this concept is to be found in Gdv., where a "martyr", Tippui Sultan, admits and even glorifies time, so that death for the individual is something logical, the price one pays for a separate and individual consciousness 3, but has the value of a most vital act for the hero: "Oh, thou and I are but waves of the stream of Life, and this creation is changing always. Life is each moment's revolution, for it is in everlasting search of a world. The woof and warp of every creature are the going and the coming, from the going and the coming stems all this craving for self-manifestation. The roads are like wandering travellers, and every- where is the travelling concealed, the staying displayed: caravan and camel and desert and palm-tree and everything that thou beholdest complain and grieve over departure. The rose is but one moment's guest in the garden: her hues and sheen are but one moment's trial. The flowers' season is both mourning and hymn of joy, the flower has the bud in her bossom, the coffin on her shoulders. Said I unto the tulip: burn yet for a while. Said the tulip: thou hast not understood my secret yet. Existence is wrought out of dry weeds and brambles, and the manifestation's only prize is homesickness". Immortality as a law of nature that can be demonstrated is an absurd, but: In Asrdr also the means for the strengthening and hardening of the self are indicated. 2 In this connection I. is fond of quoting Qur'an 53 : 7, interpreting the verse as an indication of the perfectly hardened soul of the Prophets who could fix their gaze unto God without any fear. 3 It is a causal but interesting coincidence that even in such a primitive and distant culture like that of the Eskimos, a beautiful myth tells of how Death entered the world together with Light and Sun and Moon, whereas previously, in the indistinctly dark world, Beings were immortal (cfr. K. Rasmussen, Peoples of the Polar North, London, I908, p. IOI). Die Welt des Islams, III 13 I75</page><page sequence="19">A. BAUSANI "Life draws solidness out of self-surrender and resignation : thus Death is magic, talisman, philosophers' stone. The Servant of God is a lion, and Death a gazelle: to him Death is but one stage in his development. The Perfect Man falls down upon Death like the falcon upon the dove. The slave is ever dying killed by the fear of death, and fear of death precludes him from living, whereas the free man has a far higher dignity, death gives him a new life. His care is about himself, not death, for the noble man's death lasts but an instant. Heed not the death of sepulchres, for it is of brutes and beasts; the Believer asks God the Purest for the other death, the death that draws man out of the dust of the earth. The other death! The end of the path of desire, the final outcry of victory on the battle field of the Craving after God! Though any death is sugar to those who believe, yet Husain's death is different. The wars of the kings of this world end in plundering, the war of those who believe is the imitation of the Prophet 2. And the war of those who believe is but a departure towards the Beloved one, forsaking the world and setting one's home along the path where His abode is. He who told the peoples the word of Mystical Desire proclaimed war to be the monachism of Islam. And this subtle point is only comprehended by the Martyr, who has bought this comprehension with his own blood. Resurrection and immortality are not external events: from the point of view of history, of what can be sensed, the final event is death. Resurrection and immortality are accomplished within the self. Subtle, astral or ethereal bodies are of no use to account for immortality and resurrection (Lect. I69), for they could only mean a subtler lematerialization of the self, placing it back again into an ununderstandable post-mortem serial time, while the last serial event is actually death, and death alone. This is why I. rather than immortality prefers to use the term resurrection, which is more Qur'anic-a birth to a higher non-serial time through a good death, as in Gav. (pp. 38-4I): "Through birth, o Excellent one, hast thou come into this world of the four dimensions, and through birth canst thou escape, breaking the chains that hold thee fast onto it ... But the former takes days and nights, while to the latter nights and days are but a mount. The birth of a child rends his mother's lap, the birth of man tears the world apart... Step from the Dimensions onto Dimensionlessness, make thyself sacred and forbidden unto death. O ye who resemble dead men within the coffin of the grave, know that ye can resur- rect even without the blowing of the divine Trumpet ... Mount the horse of Time and Space, free yourselves from the twisted coils of this rope 3. A spiritually strong man ,,can win his resurrection" (Lect. 167). Resignation, obviously, in the Iqbalian sense, i.e. to a personal and living God, not to Fate. 2 To one who asked him about hdl (mystic ecstasy) I. answered that in the decadent mysticism of later Islam Mal had come to mean useless and self-denying ecstasy, but in the heroic times of early Islam the real Mdl was the Holy War. 3 "The twisted coils of this rope" is the zunnrr, the girdle worn by Zoroastrians and Christians, and symbol of heresy in Persian classical poetry. It is often used in I.'s poems as a symbol for serial time. So also in Asrdr (text p. 8I, transl. p. 8I). It is another interesting instance of how I. freely employs old symbols of the rich classical imagery of Persian art to express new meanings. I76</page><page sequence="20">THE CONCEPT OF TIME IN -MUHAMMAD IQBAL The concept of the self-redeeming death of the strong 1 also throws a new light on the hadit, which I. often quotes, miut qabl an tamiut, ,,die before ye die". There is a possibility of finding a purifying death even before the time of death; it must be borne in mind, however, that this is not a faint-hearted ascetic's repudiation of the world. The true repudiation of the world according to the Qur'an is something different, I. says in a fine Urdu couplet 2: isi Qur'an min hai ab tark-i gihdn-ki ta'lim "Such is then Qur'an's teaching on Forsaking the World, gis-ng Mu'min-k6 bandyd Mah-u-Parvin-kd amir! which has made the Believer prince of the Moon and the Pleiads". The problem of the everlasting life is thus envisaged in a remark- able poem in Paydm-i MaSriq (p. io8): "Think ye not that the Magi have finished their work: a thousand wines yet undrunk are frothing in the vine's own heart. The meadow is beautiful, but thou canst not live a bud for ever: divine breezes do tear the garment of life from thee. If thou hast well comprehended the secret mystery of Life trust not a heart that is free from the twinging thorn of Desire. Live drawn within thyself, mighty as a mountain not like a fluttering straw: beware, quick is the wind and brave and burning the flame!" With a slight modification one may thus give an Iqbalian twist to a sentence by Bergson (Donnees, p. 146): ,,Eternity should not be contemplated but lived". The man who can live actively the eternity of tension and harden himself to the utmost, cannot be swallowed up by nothingness, just as in Asrdr (text pp. 60 &amp; ff., transl. pp. 59 &amp; ff.) the bird can swallow the water-drop, but not the diamond. What his afterdeath personality shall be like is an idle question, for it means to draw back into space, into seriality, the durational time that is not related to any space extension (after all talking about what is after death is enough to false the problem). One should prove, then, that he is eternal. We have just gone through some of the main philosophical con- 1 The idea is clearly Nietzschean.

BAUSANI sequences of I.'s concept of Time. We should now discuss the subject of his historical sources 1. The question is twofold--tracing what I. actually drew from his own studies and readings and what is better accounted for by a similarity between his and other philo- sophical-religious trends, which, even without resorting to more or less unconscious ,,archetypes", seem to stem from a certain general philosophical atmosphere that was peculiar to the eastern and western environment I. lived in 2. First and foremost as a source of inspiration is the Qur'an. I.'s insight into the genuine spirit of this book was better than that of a good many Muslim theologians, past and present 3, though sometimes somewhat at the expense of the letter. The passages he most often quotes in support of his theory of Time are the following (according to I.'s own translation, which is not always orthodox from the point of view of western critical scholarship 4): "God causeth the day and the night to take their turn. Verily in this is teaching for men of insight" (24: 44). "And he hath subjected to you the night and the day" (I6 : 12). "Assuredly in the creation of the Heavens and of the earth and in the alternation of night and day... are signs for those who understand" (2: I59, 3: i88 and with only slight differences io : 6). "And it is He who hath ordained the night and the day to succeed one another for those who desire to think (italics I.'s) on God or desire to be thankful" (25 : 63). "Seest thou not that God causeth the night to come in upon the day and the day to come in upon the night and that he doeth subject the sun and the moon to laws by which each speedeth along to an appointed goal?" (3I : 28). "It is of Him that the night returneth to the day and that the day returneth on the night" (39 : 7). "And of Him is the change of the Night and of the Day" (23 : 82). Other verses are merely hinted at, "which, indicating the relativity of our reckoning of Time, suggest the possibility of unknown levels of con- sciousness". Among such verses must be 70 : 4: "To Him ascend the Angels and the Spirit in a day the measure of which is fifty thousand years", or 32 : 2: "He regulates the affair from the heaven to the earth; then shall it ascend to Him in a day the measure of which is a thousand years of what you count", and perhaps 97 : 3: "The Night of Destiny is better 1 See S. A. Vahid, op. cit., pp. 84-I45, containing a discussion on European and Oriental sources of I.'s thought. 2 For instance it is a matter of fact that more or less Isma'ili ideas found their way even into Muslim milieus which historically had no direct contact with real Ismcailism. But I find dangerous scientifically to infere from this a somewhat mysterious coincidence of ,,arche- types", as it is now fashionable even in serious circles. (See for instance Corbin, op. cit., p. I85, n. 7, when he criticizes historicist exegesis based on causal induction). 8 A similar tendency towards a revaluation of the genuine "semitic" inspiration of the Bible against the grecizing influence of systematic theology (specially Aristotelian) is appa- rent also in Christian theological circles (The entire work of Karl Barth and his more or less declarate followers is directed to this purpose). The chief difference between the Islamic and Christian theological worlds is however this, that the orthodox As'arism of Islam is much more anti-classical and anti-Aristotelian than the philosophy of St. Thomas Aquinas, which became the orthodox one in the R.C. Church. 4 Two examples of such translations we gave above p. i62 note 3 and p. I70, note 3.</page><page sequence="22">THE CONCEPT OF TIME IN MUHAMMAD IQBAL I79 than a thousand months". Other verses I. often quotes are 26: 59-60: "And put then thy trust in Him that liveth and dieth not and celebrate His praise ... Who in six days created the Heavens and the earth and what is between them, then mounted His Throne: the God of Mercy", 54 : 40: "All things we have created with a fixed destiny. Our command was but one, swift as the twinkling of an eye". The last two verses, according to I., express both the the serial and non-serial aspect of duration with the "simplicity of the Qur'anic language". The process of creation, which from an outside, serial point of view takes thousands of years, from another, inner point of view is a single, indivisible act "swift as the twinkling of an eye". Concerning the presence of God in time, with the consequent creativity of ever new forms and the added importance given to concrete historical facts, I. recalls the following passages from the Qur'an: "He adds to His creation what He wills" (35 : i). "Say: Go through the earth and see how God hath brought forth all creation and hereafter will He give it another birth" (29 : 19). "Of old did We send Moses with our signs and said to him: Bring forth thy people from the darkness into the light, and remind them of the days of God" (4 : I5). "And among those whom We had created are a people who guide others with truth and in accordance therewith act justly. But as for those who treat Our signs as lies, We gradually bring them down by means of which they know not; and though I lengthen their days verily My stratagem is effectual" (7 : x8I). "Already before your time have precedents been made. Traverse the earth then and see what hath been the end of those who falsify the signs of God" (3 : 13). "If a wound hath befallen you a wound like it hath already befallen others. We alternate the days of successes and reverses among peoples" (3 : 134). "Every nation hath its fixed period" (7: 32). As to the hadits, I. is especially fond of quoting two on Time: ld tasubbi 'd-dahr, innd ad-dahr Alldh 1 and if ma'a 'ldah waqt 2. The former I. quoted to Bergson, who was peculiarly struck by it 3, during a trip to Europe in I931-I932 4: it stresses the philo- sophical importance of Divine Time and its unfolding in history, while the latter, as I. uses it, shows the means to act divinely by harmonizing oneself with the Divine Time. To list all further possible sources in Islam for I.'s concept of Time would mean to study the idea of Time in Islam in general, a subject recently studied by Massignon 5. In Lect. IOI-IIO I. himself lists his main Islamic sources, first of all the AS'arite atomic 1 The autenthicity of this hadst is of course highly unprobable. It seems to have originated rather in dahriyya circles. In any case I. was perfectly right in emphasizing the importance given to Time by Muslim thinkers. In theMuqdbasdtbyTawhi d (Cairo, 1929, p. I72ff. quoted by Tj. De Boer in his art. Zaman in El the answer to the question: "What is better, space or time?" is: "Time is preferable because space belongs to the realm of the Sensible, Time to the spiritual Realm, etc.". 2 See p. 7o0, note 2.

BAUSANI theory of time and space 1, Mulla CalMl ad-Din Davani 2, the mysti- cal Persian poet 'Iraqi 3, Fahr ad-Din Razi 4. I. got many a valua- ble hint from the works of Ruimi, who remains his foremost source besides the Qur'an, though Ruimi's influence is in the main related to the general outline of I.'s philosophy (specifical points of contact between the two have been pointed out in the course of this paper). I.'s attitude towards all these sources is however critical. As to the As'arite doctrine of the tafra, jump, or discontinuity of the being, he admires their intuitions forestalling modern theories 6, especially concerning space, but he found the idea of an atomic time less satisfactory, deeming it a mistake due to the ignorance or neglect of the psychologically subjective aspect of time. According to I. the main fault of such a conception is that it considers Time almost a created, objectively given fact, whereas a personal, living creator is posited; now if this creator is living, one must somehow be able to predicate a time of Him which can no longer be adequa- tely accounted for by the atomic theory. A better understanding of Divine Time is gained through introspection, seizing that experience of appreciative time that alone can account for creativeness 6. In this way, according to I., time precedes space psychologically, is the source of space 7. I. prefers, perhaps, the deeper apprehensions of later philosophers such as Davani, who had realized that "if we take time to be a kind of span which makes possible the appearance of events as a moving procession and conceive this span to be a unity, then we cannot but describe it as an original state of the Divine activity encompassing all the succeeding states of that activity"; Davani, however, adds that this succession is relative in 1 On which see S.

The numerous excursus it contains assume the character of real treatises on various theological and philosophical subjects. 5 Prof. D.B.

Cfr. Also sprach Zarathustra, I. Teil, Von tausend und einem Ziele: "Schatzen ist Schaffen: h6rt es, ihr Schaffenden!" 7 Parallels of this idea of the priority of time with respect to space in Isma'ilism can be found in the already quoted paper by H. Corbin, p. I96-I97. I80</page><page sequence="24">THE CONCEPT OF TIME IN MUHAMMAD IQBAL comparison to God, to whom everything is present and who can encompass all things through a single act of perception. I. finds 'Iraqi even more satisfactory; according to the latter, there are several kinds of space and time according to the different degrees of being: "The time of gross bodies which arises from the revolution of the heavens is divisible into past, present and future, and its nature is such that as long as one day does not pass away the succeeding day does not come. The time of immaterial beings is also serial in character but its passage is such that a whole year in the time of gross bodies is not more than a day in the time of an immaterial being. Rising higher and higher in the scale of imma- terial beings we reach Divine Time - time which is absolutely free from the quality of passage, and consequently does not admit of divisibility, sequence and change. It is above eternity: it has neither beginning nor end" (Lect. 104). Thus for CIraqi "Divine Time is what the Quran describes as the Mother of Books 1 in which the whole of History, freed from the net of causal sequence, is gathered up in a single super-eternal now". Fahr ad-Din Razi sums up, according to I., the debate on Time in Muslim thought with a declaration of skepticism concerning the real nature of time (Lect. 105) 2. This is only too natural, as the Islamic sources hitherto considered (except the Qur'an, of course) take time as something objective, and "a purely objective point of view is only partially helpful in our understanding of the nature of Time" (Lect. 105). I.'s concept of "time in God" differs in fact even from that 'Iraqi's, being based on psychological experiences unknown to the Muslim philosophers 3. If we admit Divine Time as CIraqi conceives it "divine knowledge" is the same as ,,omniscience in the sense of a single indivisible act of perception which makes God immediately aware of the entire sweep of history regarded as an order of specific events in an eternal 'now," (Lect. IO8). I., however, does not hesitate to carry the robust anthropomorphic 1 Umm al-KitFb, the divine archetype of Revelation, the Heavenly Exemplar of the Qur'an. 2 Much more interesting is the debate on Time between other two Razi's, i.e. the Ismatili Abu Ijatim Razi (IX-X cent. A.D.) and Muhammad ibn Zakariyya Razi (the Rhazes of the Middle Ages, d. ca. 925/3I3) summarized in Corbin, op. cit., pp. 183-i87. But this discussion, contained in an unpublished IsmaCili work by the first of the above quoted Razis (Kitib aClim an-nubuwwa) was obviously unknown to I. 8 It could be said that this psychological experience of simultaneity in time was known to the classical Muslim philosophy of the Middle Ages. I. himself quotes in his Development of Metaphysics in Persia Ibn Miskawayh's argument for a demonstration of the immateriality of the human soul, based on the experimental fact that the soul can conceive different forms in the same time (see Ibn M isk aw a yh, al-Fauz al-A sgar, Beyrouth, 3 19/190I-02). However, this juvenile work of I., though very interesting, is precedent to the development of his philosophy of the Hrudi, and was later partially repudiated by himself, as it is clear from the Urdu preface to the Urdu translation by Mir H asan ud-Din (Hyderabad, I946 4), p. 9. I8I</page><page sequence="25">A. BAUSANI conception of God in the Qur'an to its farthest consequences, denying God this "passive omniscience" of traditional theology. "By conceiving" he says "God's knowledge as a kind of reflecting mirror, we no doubt save His fore-knowledge of future events; but it is obvious that we do so at the expense of His freedom. The future certainty pre-exists in the organic whole of God's creative life, but it pre-exists as an open possibility, not as a fixed order of events with definite outlines" (Lect. o09-italics mine). This concept is all-important for, if developed and laid down the way I. does, it leads one to postulate in a way a kind of limitation of God, in order to save his personality, his life and his creating time. I. explains this with an analogy with the human ego: "Suppose, as sometimes happens in the history of human thought, a fruitful idea with a great inner wealth of applications emerges into the light of your consciousness. You are immediately aware of the idea as a complex whole, but the intellectual working out of its numerous bearings is a matter of time. Intuitively all the possibilities of the idea are present in your mind. If a specific possibility as such is not intellectually known to you at a certain moment of time it is not because your knowledge is defective, but because there is yet no possibility to become known. The idea reveals the possibilities of its application with ad- vancing experience and sometimes it takes more than one generation of thinkers before these possibilities are exhausted" (Lect. IO9-IIO). This is the God "that changes" but is none the less perfect-on the contrary he is closer to the Gcd of the Qur'an (and the Bible, we may add). It is therefore mainly through Bergson that I. has been able to come to this psychological approach to Time. This introduces the problem of I.'s European sources. His main source is Bergson, and we have seen above where the two disagree. Nietzsche, though he had in other respects a preponderant influence on I., is strongly criticized for his theory of the eternal return and cyclical time, as we have seen. I. likewise criticizes (Lect. 77-79) another of his teachers, neo-Hegelian McTaggart 1 on account of the latter's well-known theory of the unreality of time 2. It is not too clear either to what an extent I. has been influenced by Einstein's theory of relativity. It is anyway a fact that he, (like other philo- sophers in the west too) did not understand it well, giving an ama- teurish philosophical interpretation of a hypothesis that might 1 One of the chief representatives (I866-I925) of English neo-Hegelianism and whose pupil I. was during his studies in England. 2 J.

His system has more and deeper points of contact with Samuel Alexander's 2 theory of emergent evolution, of which there is a hint in one of I.'s letters to Prof. Nicholson 3. But also Alexan- der's concept of Time is cursorily criticized in Lect. I03, where he is blamed for contradicting himself by applying "atomic time to God and conceiving Him as a Life in the making". Alexander's stimu- lating theories, however, which endeavour to narrow the dualistic gulf between spirit and matter and consider the space-time rela- tionship parallel to that between soul and body, have left a definite mark on I., who is in a way much more of an idealist than the British "neo-realist". I.'s chief source therefore remains Bergson. Bergson in fact often only gives a modem form to certain concepts that had long been intuitively perceived by the various "perennial philosophies", both Islamic and non-Islamic 4. Moreover Bergson linked the solution of the problem of time with that of such vital problems as liberty and personality (Donnees, p. Io6), thus forestalling I.'s active valua- tion of time as a sword: "Le determinisme psychologique lui-m$me et les refutations qu'on en donne reposent sur une conception in- exacte de la multiplicite des etats de conscience et surtout de la duree" (Donnees, p. Io9). As we have seen above, however, I. corrects Bergson in a theistic sense, pointing to a direction that Bergson himself was eventually to follow in the course of his reli- gious evolution. Anyway, even apart from its historical roots, I.'s concept of Time is not isolated. It has deeper and farther connections 5 with parallel This is justly pointed out by Vahid, op. cit., p. I44. 2 Samuel Alexander (I859-1938) was one of the founders of the theory of emergent evolution. His chief work is Space, Time and Deity, Gifford Lectures, I920. A resum6 of his views, with criticism, can be found in W. McDougall's work, Modern Materialism and Emergent Evolution, London, 1934 (it. transl. Verona, 1947, p. 225-228). 3 Quoted in Vahid, op. cit., p. 145. 4 For instance it seems to me that one of Bergson's central ideas (Essai sur les donnees immddiates de la Conscience, Paris, 1917 17, p. 75: "Les faits de conscience, meme successifs, se p6entrent, et dans le plus simple d'entre eux peut se reflechir l'ame entiere") is a restate- ment in modern words and forms of an idea already more or less clearly apparent in Middle Ages' European and Muslim philosophers (see p. i8I, note 3). 5 I repeat I don't want here to maintain the possibility of non-causal relations and impacts of a more or less clear metahistorical character, but simply I admit that a relation and similarity between two Weltanschauungen can subsist, which can not yet be clearly recognized through a complete historical chain of causal relations. i83</page><page sequence="27">A. BAUSANI concepts developed by several theological systems. In his important paper quoted above, Corbin stresses the extraordinary wealth of implications shown by the concept of time in Mazdeism, and the influence it doubtless had on Ismdailism. Such a conception of time differs in various respects from that of I., especially if we consider the idea of a cyclical time and a creation which is only intended to return to its origins, without the possibility of ever producing anything really new. It cannot however be denied that Mazdeism nevertheless admits of an element of transcendent time-tension within God. I. would have made his own Corbin's interpretation of one aspect of Mazdeism, the fravasis of men, angels and Ohrmazd himself: ".. cette intuition extraordinaire projetant a leur tour tous les Archetypes dans une nouvelle dimension arch6typale n'est intelligible que si cette dimension ouvre, dis-tend de la distance et de la distension i l'interieur meme de l'Eternit. I1 faut alors que l'etre d'Ohrmazd ne soit pas une existence immuable et immobile, celle de l'Acte pur des theodicees rationelles, mais soit projete dans la dimension d'un Futur eternel ... Ohrmazd et tous les etres de l'univers celeste sont entraines dans le mouvement ascensionnel d'eternites illimitees vers des horizons et des actes de pensees cr6atifs d'univers encore informulables. On peut alors parler ici aussi d'une cosmologie en 'style gothique.' 1" This is after all rather a logical consequence of the concept of God as a person, which has never been able to find a proper place in the various philosophical systems inspired by Greek thought, while even -the ordinary theological systems always seem to apologize for recognizing it. This conception is on the contrary typical of the monotheistic Semitic religions 2 and Mazdeism. In the latter the idea of a personal God seems to exist side by side with remnants of different, maybe earlier, strata of a pre-prophetical religious ex- perience, making Mazdeism an exceedingly interesting subject of study from the point of view of history of religions. I., however, with his renewed emphasis on the Semitic concept of a personal God, author of new creations, is closer to the Hebrew-Christian conception of time. In the last few years there have been quite a few attempts by Christian theologians to express a new appreciation of the lineal- productive time concept of Hebraism and early Christianity 1 Corbin, op. cit., p. i7I. 2 This adjective "semitic" is not of course to be taken in a too strictly racial sense, but rather as a useful means of easier expression. 184</page><page sequence="28">THE CONCEPT OF TIME IN MUHAMMAD IQBAL as opposed to that of apokatastasis, the cyclical time, of the Greeks 1. Perhaps the most daring and radical attempt is that by O. Cullmann, in Christ et le Temps, where he reacts against the predominant Grecizing trends of theology 2. I. would not have accepted a few points of Cullmann's system, such as the excessive emphasis laid on the lineal, serial character of time, or the idea of an ab- solutely unique, total revelation of God through the historical Christ. On the other hand Cullmann's remarks showing a new appreciation of history stemming from his concept of time parallel I.'s to a fair degree. They are both indicative of a sort of movement of reaction against Greek thought and purely rationalistic philosophies which seems to be looming today, both in the East and in the West. We are finally inclined to think that I.'s concept of time fits in nicely into the general movement of revival of personalism which is under way in today's religious philosophy. I.'s own contribution is that of Islamic experience, which we would do well to consider with greater attention and appreciation. ADDITIONS To p. I58, n. I: 'Abd ar-Rahman Tariq, Gihdn-i Iqbdl.
