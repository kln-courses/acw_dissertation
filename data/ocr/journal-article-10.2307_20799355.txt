<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CONTEXT AND PROCESS OF PUEBLO MURAL PAINTING IN THE HISTORIC ERA JULIE SOLOMETO ABSTRACT Analysis of kiva murals dating to the precontact era has the potential to shed con siderable light on pre-Columbian ritual practice, but the motif-centered approaches characteristic of the past half century of scholarship are limited in their ability to determine the ceremonial significance of the images. I focus on mural painting as a ritual act and a technology consisting of a sequence of operations requiring objects, actions, personnel, and knowledge. Accounts of murals painted in the late 19th and early 20th centuries are used to reconstruct the process and socio-religious context of Pueblo mural production. Mural production involves the application of sacred materials, technical skill, and ceremonial knowledge to create images capable of "housing" the supernatural during rituals. Similarities in the se quence of operations and technology of mural production in the historic and precontact periods suggest that pre-Columbian murals may have had similar rit ual significance. RESUMEN An?lisis de murales en kivas fechados a la era del pre-contacio tiene el potencial de ilumi nar considerablemente pr?cticas rituales precolombinas, pero las observaciones basadas en dise?os, caracter?sticas de las investigaciones acad?micas de los ?ltimos 50 a?os, tienen una habilidad limitada para determinar el significado ceremonial de las im?genes. Yo me enfoco en la producci?n de murales como un acto ritual, una tecnolog?a que consiste en una secuencia oper?ci?n?l que requiere objetos, acciones, personal, y conocimientos. Reportes de murales pintados a finales del siglo XIX y principios del siglo XX son usados para reconstruir el proceso el contexto socio-religioso detr?s de la manufactura de mura les por comunidades Pueblo. La producci?n de murales involucra la aplicaci?n de materia les sagrados, habilidades t?cnicas, y conocimiento ceremonial para crear im?genes capaces de "alojar" lo sobrenatural durante los rituales. Similitudes en la secuencia oper?ci?n?l y en la tecnolog?a de manufactura de murales en el periodo hist?rico del pre-contado, superen que los murales precolombinos posiblemente ten?an un significado ritual similar.

Over the past 1,100 years murals have varied from simple bands of color to intricate compositions featuring anthropo morphe animals, and carefully rendered ritual objects. Some of the most com plex paintings have been recovered from archaeological sites dating to the A.D. 1300s to 1600s (Figures 1 and 2). More than any other source of archaeological data, these richly detailed depictions of objects, animals, and anthropomorphs offer the opportunity to understand the nature of ancestral Pueblo ideology be fore Spanish persecution of indigenous religious practices. Despite Southwestern archaeology's frequent focus on ancient religion, sur prisingly few recent scholars have used the murals as a source of information about pre-Columbian Pueblo ideology. Among those who have attempted it, two approaches predominate. One approach seeks to find direct parallels between the scenes, personages, and objects depicted in pre-Columbian murals and modem Pueblo religious practice through close comparison with ethnographic materials and consultation with Pueblo people (Crotty 1995; Dutton 1963; Hibben 1975; Schaafsma 1965; Sekaquaptewa and Washbum 2004; Smith 1952). These studies have successfully identified a variety of ritual paraphernalia depicted in the murals as well as a handful of anthropomorphs who appear to be supernatural beings, including several named katsinas, the ancestor spirit beings of the Pueblo people. The second approach assumes that the high frequency of certain types FIGURE 1.

Reprinted courtesy of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard University. of imagery (identified also through ethnographic analogy), in particular, warfare and rain/moisture motifs, reflects a ritual focus on these themes. For instance, several authors (Crotty 2001; LeBlanc 1999; Plog and Solometo 1997; Schaafsma 2000) argue that the preponderance of shields, shield bearers, and weapons in murals dating to the A.D. 1300s and early 1400s attests to a high frequency of warfare ritual and, perhaps, war in this period. Both approaches analyze murals as collections of motifs that directly reflect predominant themes in the religious lives of ancestral Pueblo people. Although motif-centered analyses are undeniably necessary and have been fruitful, I suspect that pre-Columbian mural artists and audiences experienced the paintings as more than just representations of objects, beings, and "themes." We may better understand pre-Columbian Pueblo ideology if we recognize that the paintings were meaningful to their viewers as ritual acts executed and viewed in specific socio-religious contexts. Rather than serving as mere backdrops or reflections of ritual practice, it is likely pre-Columbian murals had an important role to play in ancient ritual. Given this expanded view of mural meaning, it is legitimate not just to determine the identity of the motifs but also to ask questions such as: Who painted the images and who viewed them? Why were certain scenes and supematurals depicted? How were murals incorporated into ancestral Pueblo religious observances? To answer these questions about pre-Columbian mural production I rely heavily on ethnographic analogy. I propose that ethnographic and ethnohistoric accounts of wall paintings be used to provide a baseline for understanding the meaning of pre-Columbian murals and mural production. The focus here is not on identifying the collection of motifs that are the end product of making a mural, but on the process and context of mural production. The "how" and "why" of motif selection is more important in this analysis than the identity of</page><page sequence="4">86 JULIE SOLOMETO the image represented. An examination of process and of production may bring us closer to the goal expressed by Watson Smith (1952:105) in his exhaustive analysis of the Awatovi and Kawaika-a murals: to attain "an understanding and interpretation of [mural paintings] as a whole in the light of Pueblo ceremonial forms and symbolism as a coherent complex." Notably this approach is also advantageous to archaeologists because it allows us to glean information from the many murals whose motifs lack ethnographic parallels. In the following sec tions I examine the cultural meaning of mural production through a contextual analysis of historic era wall paintings. TECHNOLOGICAL STYLES, SYSTEMS, AND THE CHAINE OP?RATOIRE To understand the paintings as an integral part of Pueblo ritual, the method of analysis required is one which allows the process of creating a mural to be broken down into physical, social, and ritual components, to the extent these can be separated. The concepts of technological style (Lechtman 1977) and technologi cal system (Lemonnier 1989, 1992) are compatible with such a goal (see Dobres and Hoffman 1994; Hegmon 1998; and Hegmon et al. 2000 for recent reviews of these concepts). For both Lechtman and Lemonnier, the social and physical ele ments of technological activities form a unified "package" or system characteristic of the society that uses it. Both argue that technology and technological choices? such as the design of disparate items such as wooden arrows, house forms, and airplanes (Lemonnier 1989, 1992:18-19)?have a reciprocal relationship with the social system of which they are a part. For Lechtman, technologies are "sym bolic systems" which embody and communicate cultural rules and values; tech nological production is thus an important venue for non-verbal enculturation of societal ideals. The merit of the study of technologies, as opposed to the more traditional study of formal characteristics of artifacts, is in identifying "intrinsic cultural patterns" (Lechtman 1977:7) and the relationship of material culture and social organization (Lemonnier 1989:157). Both Lechtman and Lemonnier break technologies down into their con stituent parts. Lemonnier (1992:5-6) views matter, energy, objects, gestures, and specific knowledge as the essential components of technology. Energy is applied to matter with the aid of objects, or tools, in a sequence of gestures. Specific knowledge, or "know-how," is applied throughout and comprises "the end result of all the possibilities and the choices, made on an individual or societal level, which have shaped that technological action" (Lemonnier 1992:6). Lechtman is more concerned with isolating the non-material components of technologies. She (1977:6) identifies "technical modes of operation, attitudes towards materi als, some specific organization of labor, [and] ritual observances" as some of the</page><page sequence="5">THE CONTEXT AND PROCESS OF PUEBLO MURAL PAINTING 87 critical components of technological activities. Both approaches are compatible with a methodology based on the cha?ne op?ratoire, or "operational sequences," concept developed by Mauss, Leroi-Gourhan, and Lemonnier, defined as the "series of operations involved in any transformation of matter (including our own body) by human beings" (Lemonnier 1992:26; also see Schlanger 1994 for a concise summary of the development of the concept). The cha?ne op?ratoire method explicitly recognizes that each individual operation in a sequence in volves the interaction of material, object, action, and knowledge. Identification of these components leads ultimately to an understanding of the social values and principles guiding technological production.1 Lemonnier advocates ethnographic fieldwork to identify the operational sequences of technologies, while Lechtman proposes primarily to work backward from archaeological materials. Here I use a third resource, ethnohistoric accounts, to reconstruct the cha?ne op?ratoire of mural painting. In the rest of this paper, historic era mural production is broken down into a sequence of operations, from application of a fresh coat of plaster to (in some cases) the final obliteration of the images. For each operation, the materials and tools, actions, organization of labor, technical and ritual knowledge employed, and cultural attitudes towards materials and products will be identified. Also selected for study is the relation ship of painted images to their ceremonial context, that is, the particular ceremo nies for which they were painted, the buildings in which they were painted, and the point in multi-day rituals in which they were produced, viewed, and addressed in prayer. It should be noted that the application of the cha?ne op?ratoire approach to mural painting is a departure from its usual usage. The cha?ne op?ratoire has typi cally been applied to the production of items traditionally defined as "technol ogy" from a functional and utilitarian perspective, including stone tools and ceramic vessels (for instance, Miller 2007, and studies in Stark 1998). The goal of these studies has been to reveal "mental maps" that guide sequences of techno logical choices, and to reinsert the transmission and acquisition of knowledge, human choice, and social context into analyses of technological production (Dobres 1999; Schlanger 1994). Perhaps because it is a cultural act that is more recognizably "ideological," painting is rarely a subject of technological analysis, although recent studies also consider the painting of portable objects (pots, baskets) as a sequence of operations (Odegaard and Hays-Gilpin 2002) and as involving meaningful choices (Hegmon and Kulow 2005). I argue, however, that the premise of the cha?ne op?ratoire, as a sequence of practices that engage both social and material worlds at every step, is of particular utility in understanding how mural painting is conducted, learned, and used in ceremonial and social contexts. Before reconstructing the cha?ne op?ratoire of mural painting, consider ation of the sources of ethnohistoric data is necessary.</page><page sequence="6">88 JULIE SOLOMETO OBSERVATIONS OF HISTORIC ERA PUEBLO MURALS Published observations and drawings of murals and mural painting from the late 19th and early 20th centuries are the primary source of information for the recon struction of a cha?ne op?ratoire of Pueblo mural painting.2 Table 1 presents the location, ceremonial occasion, and year of observation of all paintings used in this study3 (see also Figure 1). Historic era mural paintings were found in com munities across the Pueblo world, but observations of murals in the western communities of Zuni and Hopi are more numerous than accounts of eastern Pueblo paintings. The reason for this imbalance is not entirely clear, but is likely attributable to a variety of factors including greater anthropological focus on the western Pueblos, greater secrecy regarding religious matters among eastern infor mants and thus more restricted access to ceremonial buildings, and less emphasis on mural painting in the east, where religious persecution was more frequent and acute. The historic era murals were painted in a variety of ceremonial structures, including large public kivas open to entire communities, semi-public kivas that had more restricted access, and private ceremonial rooms open only to members of particular religious societies. The non-native observers who published descrip tions of the murals were in search of information on the practice of Pueblo reli gion and typically entered these rooms in the course of religious rituals, including initiations and annual ceremonies. Each observer provided at least a verbal description of a mural, but several provide hand-drawn illustrations which reveal mural layout and details of depiction. In some instances, illustrations indicate the relationship of the painting to other features of the room, such as altars. THE CHA?NE OP?RATOIRE OF HISTORIC ERA MURAL PAINTING To understand the context and sequence of historic era mural production, I sought information from each account on the following: the room painted and its own ership, the ceremonial occasion and the timing of its painting, the ceremonial affiliations of people present during the painting process and who witnessed the finished product, which walls were painted, the images depicted on each wall, the physical relationship of the images to other material objects involved in the rites performed in the room (such as altars or temporary paintings of sand or corn meal), and any informant testimony regarding the meaning or significance of the paintings or the painting process. Thus the emphasis in the analysis was on the social and ceremonial context of the painting. I also noted whether or not the painting was temporary or permanent (Brody 1991:140) (see Table l).4 Perma nent paintings were left up for considerable periods of time but were periodically renewed or refreshed. Temporary paintings were made as a component of a spe cific ceremony and then destroyed or covered with a new coat of plaster.</page><page sequence="7">THE CONTEXT AND PROCESS OF PUEBLO MURAL PAINTING 89 Table 2 provides a cha?ne op?ratoire for historic era mural production con structed on the basis of ethnographic accounts of murals and mural painting. The cha?ne op?ratoire outlines the objects, actions, personnel, and knowledge required in the sequence of operations involved in Pueblo mural painting, which includes replastering, preparing paint, preparing brushes, painting images, and destroying or replastering painted images. The particulars of the cha?ne op?ratoire are by no means identical for each pueblo or even for each ceremonial society. Different ceremonies often require different materials, participants, and procedures, and the secretiveness and inde pendence of ceremonial societies guarantee diversity of ritual practice. There are general similarities across societies and across pueblos, however, and where found, significant differences are noted in the reconstruction that follows. Finally, it must also be noted that only portions of the operational sequence and the contextual information outlined above could be determined for each painting. Few observ ers were interested in or privy to all of the individual operations involved in the production of each painting. The cha?ne op?ratoire that follows is thus derived from multiple accounts of mural painting, as well as supplemental information from other ethnographic and ethnohistoric sources. OPERATION 1: REPLASTERING Both renewal of permanent paintings and execution of new murals were often preceded by the replastering of the room itself. Replastering involves the gather ing and mixing of plaster ingredients, soil and water, and the application of plaster to kiva walls. The deposition of meal or other offerings and perhaps the recitation of prayer probably accompanied the removal of soil (Parsons 1939:293). At Hopi, men gather soil, both men and women provide water, and women bring the basins used for mixing (Stephen 1936:202, 210). Accounts from Hopi, Zuni, and Jemez indicate that women apply plaster to kiva walls. Assistance is provided by men in tasks such as heavy lifting and holding the bowls of mixed plaster. Ethnologist Elsie Clews Parsons notes that the horseplay that accom panies replastering is "an act of courtship, in the tales" (Stephen 1936:210 . 1). Although Pueblo accounts indicate it has religious significance, replastering lacks the "gravity" (in Stephen's words) found in other steps of the mural painting process. The few Pueblo statements we have about the ceremonial significance of replastering come from Alexander Stephen's observation of the 1893 Powamu rites at Hopi. Stephen's informants indicate that plastering serves as a prayer for rain and as a request that the rain will bring the same kind of dark, organic-rich sand mixed in the plaster to the valley floor (Stephen 1936:198), where it can enrich the fields. Replastering and kiva repair perhaps accompany Powamu because this is the important Hopi rite of renewal, concerned with purifying the earth and</page><page sequence="8">JULIE SOLOMETO 1^1 ^ 8 ?S &gt; oo _C -C vo -. vo vo \ ro ro m m oo o\ 9 ( ^ o\ ^~ v- s- ^_ C C C &lt;d &lt; &lt;d &lt; 13 -C _c _c - a a a c - &lt;u &lt; o ?j - -? -?

Renewing the kivas may promote the growth of the beans carefully cultivated and warmed by the fire kept burning in each kiva throughout Powamu and the eight days that precede it; the success of the early bean "crop" is both a harbinger of the farming season to come and an indicator that a cultivator has a "good" heart (Titiev 1992:115).5 More practically, a fresh coat of plaster may be considered a necessary preparation for the temporary paintings made shortly after plastering is finished and a few days before the close of the Powamu observances. Perhaps for reasons similar to the Hopi, who included dark sand in their plaster, the religious groups renovating the Jemez kivas add to the plastering mud "the pulverized seeds of every plant which blossoms in the area and a bit of every color of mineral pigment provided by nature" (Ellis 1952:149). This act echoes the discovery of each of the plants found in most origin myths and may have been a request for the continued viability and increase of the plant species in cluded. A different reason for plastering is offered by Stevenson (1904:451), who says Zuni ceremonialists used plaster as a "seal" to prevent fumes from the medi cine prepared during the Sword Swallower initiation from escaping the room and causing harm to non-initiates. OPERATION 2: PAINT PREPARATION Considerable information is available concerning paint preparation among the Pueblos, particularly the western Pueblos; here I provide a summary of the kinds of ingredients, equipment, and knowledge involved in making paint, as well as information on the social and ceremonial context of its production and its value to its users. The following discussion is largely based on Bunzel's (1932a) brief but thorough description of paints used at Zuni in the early 1900s and the obser vations of Stephen (1898,1936) at Hopi, as well as various paint "recipes" found in descriptions of Pueblo ceremonialism (see also Odegaard and Hays-Gilpin [2002] and Smith [1952] for reviews of Pueblo paint technology). Not all sources specify the media on which the paint was to be used; it is possible, however, that paint "recipes" varied depending on whether masks, altar objects, or walls were to be painted. Paint consists of a coloring pigment, a vehicle to make it fluid, and a binder to hold the pigment and fix it to the painted medium. A variety of materials of variable rarity and religious value are used for each of the components of paint. The pigment, however, appears to be the most "powerful" paint ingredient. Pigments differ in value and in the variety and number of uses to which they may be put. The value of a pigment is contingent upon the rarity of the mate rial used and the sanctity of the preparation process. Rarity and sanctity derive from the effort, ritual knowledge, and procedures used to acquire and prepare the</page><page sequence="13">THE CONTEXT AND PROCESS OF PUEBLO MURAL PAINTING 95 pigment. Because they require special ritual knowledge to prepare, rare and valu able paints are typically the property of ceremonial societies. For instance, at Zuni, Bunzel (1932a:859) states that an ordinary pigment such as white kaolin clay may be used by everyone, is readily available, and is appropriate for use in multiple contexts (such as pottery production) without ceremonial preparation. In contrast, pink kaolinite pigment is acquired from the sacred lake by Zuni kiva chiefs on their summer pilgrimage and is used only on the masks and bodies of the most sacred katsinas (Parsons 1939:340 ). Plog (2003) and Odegaard and Hays-Gilpin (2002) argue that blue and green paints, made from malachite and azurite, were extremely valuable to the historic Pueblo and are overrepresented on precontact ritual objects. The rarest type of black paint at Zuni is among the highly sacred items, such as obsidian knives, thunder stones, and e'to?we, or sacred bundle, said to have been brought from the innermost depths of the underworld by the priests of the U'wanami (or rain makers) at the time of emergence (Bunzel 1932b:514; 1932c:643). These pots of black paint, which take their place with the e'to?we on the altars of the U'wanami, are among the objects that give the religious leaders their authority. As in the case of the sacred black paints described above, some paints and pigments were owned or controlled by specific ceremonial societies. This may be because the paint or pigment was handed down from the beginning of this world, or because the society was responsible for its acquisition and preparation, which may have entailed exclusive possession of knowledge handed down since the time of emergence. The discovery of pigment caches in prehistoric kivas (Smith 1972) suggests that exclusive ownership of pigments by ceremonial groups has some time depth. Although paints such as the sacred black from the Underworld do not appear to be widely shared, a description of the Zuni scalp ceremonial preparations (Parsons 1924:15) suggests that some paints may be shared with ritualists who request it. Pigments that are not rare or ritually charged are commonly ground with small amounts of materials of religious value, such as prayer shell, turquoise, coral, dried flowers, com meal or pollen, carbonized com from archaeological sites, and beads. Society personnel often mix the ingredients, and groups of girls under the direction of society members do the work of grinding the ingredients. According to Bunzel (1932a:859-860), grinding of some pigments was performed "ceremo nially" in ritual dress, followed by dancing and a feast. When smaller quantities of pigment were required, society members often ground them during the private portions of that society's annual rites. Accounts of ceremonial grinding describe the use of specific mortars and pestles and/or grinding slabs brought out for the occasion, sometimes with compartments specific to pigment color (Stephen 1936: 820). Knowledge of which materials made appropriate pigments, which materials could be added to pigments to make them powerful or efficacious, and where to obtain these materials is evident in the preparation of pigments.</page><page sequence="14">96 JULIE SOLOMETO The selection of a vehicle and binder is the next step in paint preparation. In many accounts, seeds were chewed and the oil-bearing saliva or saliva and water were mixed with the pulverized pigment (Smith 1952). Stephen ( 1898:265) observes that the Hopi view saliva as a 'Votive offering/' Prepared medicine water or water collected from a particular sacred spring was also used as a vehicle (Ste phen 1936:606, 625, 898). Other materials were sometimes added to the water, such as honey, white bean meal (Stephen 1936:309, 625), and various plants (squash, black corn plant) boiled to produce a syrup (Stephen 1936:491; Smith 1952:31). Pinyon gum (which requires an elaborate preparation), eagle egg whites, and yucca syrup were used to produce a gloss. No single method was favored for the full suite of pigments used; each pigment seems to have had its own appro priate vehicle and binder. For instance, Stephen (1936:523) observed the prepa ration of paints for decorating katsina masks and noted that squash seeds were chewed to mix with blue-green pigment and muskmelon seeds for black pig ment, whereas yellow ochre was mixed with water only. The knowledge of which vehicles and binders to use with specific pigments was probably shared by those society members responsible for painting walls and objects, and each society appears to have had its own preferences, possibly specific to particular media. Several accounts of Pueblo paint preparation include reference to one or more particularly religiously charged materials added to make the paint effica cious; some ingredients make the paint "better medicine" or provide "power" (Stevenson 1915:606), some provide "strength" (Parsons 1925:16n.l6), and oth ers are added to elicit the increase of the materials used (Parsons 1939:487). Descriptions of paints made for decorating katsina masks suggest that the paints have the power of transformation as they are said to render the masks "valuable" and "make them into a living person" (Parsons 1939:341). Cushing supports the notion of the transformative power of paint, arguing that Pueblo dry paintings (and by extension the mural paintings) are and must be only temporary "for they are supposed to be spiritually shadowed, so to say, or breathed upon by the gods or god animals they represent, during the appealing incantations or calls of the rites; hence the paint substance of which they are composed is in a way incarnate, and at the end of the ceremonial must be killed and disposed of as dead if evil, eaten as medicine if good" (Cushing, in Mallery 1893:211). An extract of a prayer recorded by Bunzel (1932c:643-656), recited by a rain priest during an annual retreat to appeal for rain, also demonstrates the abil ity of the supernatural to transform objects made with ritually powerful paint. Before the retreat the priest prepares prayer sticks or "plume wands" coated with black paint, to which a small amount of the paint brought from the underworld (mentioned above) has been added. These prayer sticks are offered to the super naturals with the words:</page><page sequence="15">THE CONTEXT AND PROCESS OF PUEBLO MURAL PAINTING 97 My fathers, Grasping your plume wands, You will see your plume wands. You will see whether they have been finished with precious paint, Or else are unfinished. With your spittle, With your flesh, With your divine wisdom, They will be made over afresh into human beings; They will be strong. This poem supports Cushing's assertion above that "precious" paint enables the plume wands to be "incarnate," or inhabited by the supernatural. As Cushing indicates, once the paint is inhabited or "breathed upon" in the course of the ritual, ceremonialists have an obligation to properly dispose of it. For instance, the powders used in dry paintings may be taken home by ritual participants for use as "medicine"; they are also mbbed on the body, spread on agricultural fields, buried in a sacred place, or, like paint scraped from masks, are disposed of in shrines (Brody 1991:165; Cushing in Mallery 1893:211; Stephen 1936:395, 519; Wyman 1983; Young 1988:192). OPERATION 3: PREPARATION OF BRUSH Paint is applied with the fingers, with a piece of animal hide, a green com husk wrapped over the finger, or most commonly with a yucca leaf brush. The end of the yucca leaf is chewed and the pulp removed to leave the fibers protruding (see references in Smith 1952:31). All of these materials are readily available through out the Pueblo region, and painters appear to prepare their own brushes without ceremony. The yucca brush and other tools of paint application appear to be the only objects in the cha?ne op?ratoire of mural production that are not ritually charged. OPERATION 4: PAINTING IMAGES With all materials assembled?a freshly plastered wall, several colors of paint, and a bmsh?the next operation in mural production is to paint the images. Exe cuting a painting, however, involves far more than just the application of paint to wall. It occurs in a specific social and ceremonial context and requires extensive religious knowledge. In this section, I separately examine the timing of painting,</page><page sequence="16">98 JULIE SOLOMETO the identity of the painters and the painting's audience, and the knowledge of where and what to paint. Timing. The decision of when to paint the images is determined by the timing of approaching ceremonials. Permanent paintings are renewed in the pro cess of kiva renovations and refurbishment prior to or in the early days of specific rites in which the paintings play an important role. The temporary murals also are painted in the course of the multi-day ceremonials of which they are a part. Temporary paintings were typically made in the later days, sometimes even the final day of the ceremonial. Murals were often painted during the same private preparations in which prayer sticks were made and the altar items were refreshed and assembled. In all recorded cases mural painting took place prior to the public or semi-public rites held in the kivas. The Painters. Observations of mural production at Hopi indicate that murals were painted on kiva walls by recent initiates to the ceremonial society in charge of that kiva while closely watched by their society elders (Stephen 1936: 210, 224,235, 875). A similar division of labor is noted for Acoma (Stirling 1942: xvi) and Jemez Pueblo (Ellis 1952). Different accounts give different impressions, however, of the amount of artistic freedom given to the young initiates. Female initiates to the Marau society at Walpi refreshed permanent paintings and thus had little opportunity for artistic expression. In several other accounts describing the process of producing temporary paintings, it is clear that the ceremonial society elders told younger initiates precisely which colors and images were to be painted, but in one account of mural painting in Walpi's Nasha'baki kiva during the Powamu observances elder men tell the young men which colors to use, and "the young men seem to choose their own subject" (Stephen 1936:224). The apparent freedom given to younger painters is extremely unexpected in a ceremonial tradition in which success is dependent on careful attention to pre cise ritual formulae. It seems possible, however, that the license given to young Walpi painters is explained by the differing sanctity of kiva walls. Of the four First Mesa kivas Stephen observed in the course of the 1893 Powamu, three have depic tions of the deity Sho'tok?n?ngwa on their north, and arguably most sacred, walls (see discussion of directionality below) (Figure 3); the fourth kiva has a cloud altar similar to the ones flanking Sho'tok?n?ngwa in the three other kivas, and thus perhaps the altar is "shorthand" for this deity. There appears to be little freedom of choice in painting north walls during the First Mesa Powamu, but the content of the south wall of the Nasha'baki kiva suggests fewer restrictions and the oppor tunity for the young painters to "choose their own subject." Stephen's drawing of the south wall shows a cloud altar of different style from that on the north wall, a girl under a rainbow, and a bird atop a tree. The artistic freedom accorded to initiates in the Nasha'baki kiva is likely to have been restricted to the south wall, where ritual formulae did not dictate a particular set of images.</page><page sequence="17">THE CONTEXT AND PROCESS OF PUEBLO MURAL PAINTING 99 FIGURE 3. Sho'tok?n?ngwa and cloud altar painted on the north wall of Oak Mound kiva for the 1893 Powamu, Sichomovi, Hopi (Stephen 1936:Plate 5). Reprinted with permission of Columbia University Press. A similar distinction in content on more and less sacred walls is found in Ellis's (1952) observations of the painters of Jemez murals during preparations for the Huntuki", a ceremony of the dedication of newly built or refurbished kivas. The "religious groups," Ellis says, are responsible for painting the principal deities ?the sun, the moon, the stars, snakes, and two rainbows?on the north wall of the kiva, the wall that plays an important role in later kiva rites. Between the vari ous ceremonial performances making up Huntuki", "men and boys who can handle a brush adequately are offered recreation in decorating the remaining walls with animals, sport and hunting scenes, and birds, all done under the direc tion of the headTabush [a ceremonial leader]" (Ellis 1952:150). As at Hopi, more experienced personnel are in charge of producing sacred images on the north wall, whereas novices are welcome to participate more fully in the decoration of less important walls, where they are nonetheless supervised. An examination of the identity and responsibilities of mural artists suggests that the more sacred and efficacious designs are known by a limited number of society elders. These elders pass their experience down to younger members of the society during the painting process, ensuring that the images are correctly</page><page sequence="18">100 JULIE SOLOMETO TABLE 3.

Painting thus is an important means of transferring ceremonial knowledge to younger society members. Greater freedom is allowed in the choice of some images, including those painted on less sacred walls. However, Stephen's accounts of paintings in multiple First Mesa kivas indicate that elder ritualists invariably decide the colors of the painted images, no matter what walls they were painted on, reinforcing the notion that the efficacy and power of the images is strongly linked to the paint itself. Knowledge about Where to Paint Images. The importance of directionality in Pueblo ritual has been noted by nearly all careful observers of Pueblo religious life. Prayers must be made or ceremonial circuits must begin at a certain direction, and deities, animals, plants, and colors are typically associated with particular directions (Bunzel 1932b; Ford 1980; Hieb 1979; Parsons 1939; Tedlock 1979). Observer accounts of mural location strongly suggest that wall paintings were placed with respect to directional principles. Table 3 summarizes the placement of murals that were painted on fewer than all four kiva walls and for which direc tion is known. The data show that when one to three kiva walls were painted, painters strongly preferred the north and west walls. Painters failed to paint a north or west kiva wall in only one instance. Painters may have favored north and west walls for several reasons. As dis cussed above for Jemez and Hopi, north walls are invested with greater ceremo nial significance, perhaps because this direction is the start of the directional circuit guiding the conduct of ritual in some Pueblo communities. West walls may be favored because they face east; according to Parsons (1939:367), shrines usually face east and prayers are made while facing east. It is thus no coincidence that Pueblo altars are often constructed on the north or west walls of kivas (Jean con 1926; Parsons 1939; Stevenson 1904; Stirling 1942; Wyman 1983). Altars are integral components of Pueblo ritual practice that, like spoken prayers, also address and invite the supernatural. Altars typically consist of offerings and the sacred objects belonging to the participating society, such as "fetishes or representations of the Spirits, of their guards, and... sacrosanct supplies to be used in ritual such as medicine bowl and aspergills, prayer-meal bowl, rattles, or bear paws, includ ing objects which are to be given to the Spirits or to those participating in the ritual" (Parsons 1939:353-354). These objects may be placed atop or behind a</page><page sequence="19">THE CONTEXT AND PROCESS OF PUEBLO MURAL PAINTING 101 dry painting constructed of colored sand or cornmeal and are often framed by a painted wooden construction that provides a horizontal backdrop (Figure 4). The testimony of Pueblo informants strongly indicates that in some instances wall paintings were placed with reference to the altar. For instance, one Hopi informant told Watson Smith (1952:103) "that when he was a boy a few old men painted pictures on kiva walls ... on each side of the altar." The observations of historic era murals also seem to support this conclusion. In seven cases observers recorded the position of both altars and murals. In four of these instances altars were constructed in front of paintings. Illustrated examples such as Figure 4 show murals either framing or centered above altar objects, indicating that paintings and altars are part of an integrated construction. The three exceptions?in which paintings were not on the same wall as the altar? include two rooms in which permanent paintings were housed, paintings that may not have had a direct role to play in the ceremony for which the altar was constructed. The third exception was found in the ceremonial chamber housing the initiation of the Little Fire fraternity at Zuni, which has a painting of a cougar on the north wall. This was clearly an instance of conflicting directional prescrip tions; altars in Zuni are ideally placed on the west wall so that they face east (Stevenson 1904:423), while the position of the cougar painting on the north wall obeys the directional symbolism of the animal, which is the predator of the north. In sum, if fewer than all four walls were painted, the ritualists responsible for historic mural production favored north and west walls, likely locations for altar constructions, the start of the ceremonial circuit, and appropriate locations for addressing supernatural beings in prayer. In those instances in which single walls were painted, perhaps wall selection was based on whether the painting was perceived as a place from which to begin a ritual (north) or as a prayer bearer (west). Knowledge of Which Images to Paint. Ethnohistoric and ethnographic data indicate that the images painted and the specifics of their depiction, from wall placement to colors, are part of a ritual formula known and passed on by senior ceremonialists. As discussed above, elder ceremonialists instruct younger society members in the course of mural production, telling them which images to paint on (at least) the more sacred walls of kivas and specifying the color of all motifs. Knowledge of which images to paint is but one small part of the body of ritual knowledge required to perform a ceremony, which also includes sequences of prayers, songs, and dances that must be remembered, as well as paraphernalia such as altar objects, prayer sticks, and ceremonial clothing that are required to conduct the ritual successfully. The specifics of image depiction are thus one com ponent of ceremony-specific knowledge passed from one generation of ritualists to the next.</page><page sequence="20">102 JULIE SOLOMETO FIGURE 4. Altar and wall and dry paintings for the 1892 initiation ceremony of the tHIe'wekwe or Sword Swallower fraternity, Zuni (Stevenson 1904:Plate CVIII). National Anthropological Archives, Smithsonian Institution (BAE GN 02359c2).</page><page sequence="21">THE CONTEXT AND PROCESS OF PUEBLO MURAL PAINTING 103 In the case of permanent paintings, "image knowledge" is attained by any one allowed to enter the room in which they are found. It seems likely that refreshing permanent images would not require knowledge of how they should look (given the presence of a template that is simply painted over), but involves other kinds of know-how, such as which paints should be used. In the case of temporary paintings, image knowledge of sacred subjects is retained by senior ceremonialists, and there is only a brief period for other observers to view and thus commit paintings to memory. This short period of exposure to the image may not be sufficient to accurately reproduce the paintings. An account of dry painting at Hopi provided by Stephen (1936:916) suggests the difficulty and necessity of getting an image "just right." During the 1892 Maxau ceremony at Walpi, the ritual leader who made the sand painting in 1891 was unable to attend the ceremony, and a second painter was required to fill in. Because he was "not expert at altar painting," he copied a textile bearing the same design because he wished "to make the altar just as it appears on the cloth." This account suggests that producing images was not taken lightly, accuracy was highly valued, and some sort of image learning other than mere observation was required to repro duce the images year after year. Thus it seems that paintings can be added to those other components of ceremonial knowledge, such as prayers, particulars of cere monial dress and altar paraphernalia, and sequences of ritual gestures that must be faithfully reproduced in order for rituals to be efficacious (Bunzel 1932b: 492-493). We might assume then that, like prayers, image knowledge is felt to be owned by individuals or ceremonial societies and is guarded as precious and powerful (Bunzel 1932b; Parsons 1939:154, 315). If the analogy with prayer holds true, the most sacred images produced by mural painters are likely to be conservative in nature. The account of the dry painting made for Maxau certainly indicates that painting offers little room for error, much less innovation over time. But what is the relationship between the images specified by handed-down ritual formulae and the ceremonies in which they play a role? Determining the "logic" connecting image to ceremonies is of obvious value in understanding the pre-Columbian murals. Analysis of those cases in which mural observers also provided accounts of associated ritual shows that the images depicted on kiva walls are meaningfully related to the ceremonial society using the room and the rites of which they are a part. Permanent paintings in rooms belonging to ceremonial societies and tem porary paintings made for society initiations typically depict supernatural sub jects closely linked to the society itself. For example, four observations from 1882 to 1900 indicate that the walls of the Kaletaka or Warrior Society ceremonial room at Walpi were permanently painted with images of the four predators or animal warriors of the directions. A permanent painting on the walls of the Hunt er's fraternity at Zuni depicts the predators of the six directions following or hov ering above their corresponding prey. Patron animals are also found on the walls</page><page sequence="22">104 JULIE SOLOMETO of kivas housing the Great Fire and Little Fire fraternities at Zuni, which depict one or all four Beast Gods, beings impersonated and repeatedly invoked through out their initiation rites. Also at Zuni, the Sword Swallower fraternity painted a composition featuring ?chiyala'topa, the supernatural who first taught them the "art or secret of sword swallowing," for its initiation (Stevenson 1904:445). At Isleta, the Laguna Fathers' ceremonial chamber is painted with the four Ina!an paiunin, the "patron spirits" or "fathers" of the Laguna Fathers. On the walls of ceremonial rooms used to initiate members into the Acoma curing societies, bears?important animals gifted with the power of curing?carry eagle plumes and rattles as the performers do themselves. In this instance, the paintings mimic the actions of the ritual performers themselves (or vice versa) and the murals can be seen as a partial "blueprint" for the conduct of the ritual. In the case of the 1893 Powamu ceremonial on First Mesa, which was cele brated in many kivas, it is apparent that the images depicted are logically related to the ritual rather than specific to the group performing it. The knowledge of which images are appropriate for Powamu is apparently shared by multiple First Mesa kivas; of the four decorated kivas described by Stephen (1936), all have paintings of "cloud altars" for bringing rain. Also, appropriate to this rite of renewal and the return of fertility to the earth, the north walls of three kivas have depictions of Sho'tokunungwa, the Heart-of-Sky god, a deity associated with death and rebirth and with water, corn, and fertility (Stephen 1936:770). It is also the case that paintings in all three kivas faithfully reproduce several aspects of his depiction, including his pointed cap and association with clouds and lightning. Thus it is clear that knowledge about the images to be depicted as well as specific attributes of those images was widely shared.6 At Jemez, where ceremonial societies shared the pueblo's two kivas, the primary recurrent motifs described by observers are the personified sun, moon, and stars and a stepped altar surmounted by a rainbow. These deities, who also appear as secondary elements in Hopi and Zuni compositions, may have been "generic" powers invoked by the several groups that shared Jemez's few kivas. Paraphernalia specific to the religious societies that alternately used the kivas were perhaps entirely portable, to be set up during closed sessions in the kivas or in the private houses and chambers where society fetishes and belongings were kept (Parsons 1925:13-14). The observations of historic murals thus clearly indicate that the super natural beings depicted in kivas are ones invoked in the course of ceremonies performed there. Permanent paintings in rooms belonging to specific ceremonial societies at Hopi and Zuni depict patron animals that would have played a regu lar part in society rituals, while widely invoked deities such as the sun and moon are found on the walls of shared kivas at Jemez. Observations were available for multiple kivas for only one widely celebrated annual ritual; in this instance par ticipating kivas depicted the same or similar images that can be logically linked to the themes expressed in the rites.</page><page sequence="23">THE CONTEXT AND PROCESS OF PUEBLO MURAL PAINTING 105 The Viewers. Of the thirteen ethnographic cases in which mural observers identified the people who witnessed the paintings, two of the painted rooms? the ceremonial room of the Rain Priesthood at Zuni and the ceremonial room of the Kaletaka or Warrior Society in the Hopi village of Walpi?were entered only by society members in the course of annual observances. Both rooms were fur nished with permanent paintings. In ten instances a restricted group of ceremo nialists or relatives of ceremonial participants saw the paintings, usually in the course of the semi-public rituals, dancing, and visiting that came at the end of the multi-day ritual, often an initiation. Thus the majority of the paintings were intended for a limited audience, only for the members and relatives of members of ceremonial societies. Only the murals at Jemez were viewed by the entire community. The more sacred images of sun, moon, stars, and rainbows painted on the north wall were permanent, visible to observers from the late 1800s to the 1940s. Less permanent images on the other walls, probably redrawn or recon ceived at each kiva rededication ceremony (the Huntuki", described above), were more variable but also were viewed by all observers. OPERATION 5: TEMPORARY PAINTINGS OBLITERATED Permanent paintings, by definition, were left in place and renewed when cere monial occasions required. However, temporary paintings seem to have been destroyed or plastered over shortly after their use. In the one instance of oblit eration recorded by Stephen (1936:238), the Powamu paintings made in the Nasha'baki kiva were removed by mbbing and scraping within two days of their completion. An earlier instance of replastering occurred in 1598, when an officer of the conquistador O?ate visited Puaray Pueblo on the Rio Grande and observed paintings barely hidden beneath a layer of whitewash (Brody 1991:99). When asked why murals made for Powamu were destroyed, a senior cere monialist told Stephen (1936:238) that because the wall paintings are like altars, "it is a prescriptive matter . . . that an altar having served its purpose should at once be effaced." Cushing (in Mallery 1893:221) and Parsons (1939:358) suggest that the paintings and dry paintings must be destroyed so that the power incar nate in them will not need to be in constant control; without proper ceremonial control these objects can be dangerously powerful and a threat to the community. As in the case of the plastering done at Zuni, plaster may act as a "seal" to contain the power of painted images. DISCUSSION: THE CEREMONIAL SIGNIFICANCE OF PUEBLO MURALS This contextual analysis has examined the cha?ne op?ratoire of historic era mural painting from replastering to the obliteration of painted images. Reconstruction of the operational sequence of mural painting reveals that murals are the products</page><page sequence="24">106 JULIE SOLOMETO of traditions of knowledge that specify the acquisition and preparation of spe cial materials, the ordered actions and instruction of ritual personnel, the trans mission of esoteric and sometimes secret ceremonial knowledge, and ultimately the invocation and embodiment of the supernatural. In summary, wall paintings are closely associated with ceremonial societies and their rituals, with nearly every aspect of mural production invested with reli gious significance. Fresh plaster is seen as a prayer for rain and a necessary "seal" that contains the powerful forces produced in rituals. The preparation of paint is a sacred occasion performed in conjunction with other ceremonial activities prior to major private and public rites, and great care is taken in procuring and mixing powerful, valuable, and sacred pigments, vehicles, and binders. The images selected for representation are related in a meaningful way to the religious society per forming the ritual, to its particular powers or areas of influence on the super natural, or to the ceremony of which the paintings are an integral part. As in the case of multiple paintings of the god Sho'tok n?ngwa during 1893 Powamu cele brations at Hopi, knowledge of which image to paint is sometimes held by groups larger than the ceremonial society. Ideals of how images should look are held by older ritualists and passed down through the instruction of young painters. Given the transformative properties of the paint and the images produced, the images themselves are "powerful" and are capable of "containing" spiritual forces. Most murals are viewed by a restricted audience, reinforcing the notion that knowledge of these images and their power is intended for a very few The purpose or use of the images and their meaning to native ritualists can be further explored in the words of Pueblo informants and the Euroamerican observers who interpreted the significance of the paintings to their users. In all native testimonies, it is clear that the murals are understood to have some effect, either as prayers or as temporary incarnations of the beings they depict. Stephen's (1936:211) Hopi informants stated that paintings of "clouds and other symbols are as much prayers for rain and other blessings as the altar itself." Likewise, a Walpi chief explains the handprints and paintings of clouds and lightning made by girls while replastering as signifying "the desire of the person making the imprint to grasp at the clouds and bring rain" (Stephen 1936:198). Albert Reagan (1906:241), an observer of ceremonies at Jemez Pueblo, argues that some mural paintings were intermediaries or prayer bearers; for exam ple, he notes that the Jemez believed "that the symbols have the power to carry the prayers of the children of men to the deities they represent." Support for this comes from Zuni and Hopi, where prayer feathers were attached to paintings of antelope observed during the Marau initiation at Walpi, a wildcat in the ceremo nial room of the Walpi Warrior Society, and to the Beast Gods painted for Zuni's Great Fire fraternity initiation. This act parallels the attachment of prayer feathers to wild animals and to beings in tales such as Owl Boy and Deer Boy (Parsons 1939:287) and echoes myths in which red feathers attached to the animals of the</page><page sequence="25">THE CONTEXT AND PROCESS OF PUEBLO MURAL PAINTING 107 six directions signify a person's wish for rain (ibid.). A further parallel may be found in the attachment of prayer feathers to domestic animals and to children at Hopi as a prayer or wish "for increase" and to encourage those blessed to "grow up quickly" (Parsons 1939:288). The paintings thus are seen as "stand-ins" for live animals or supematurals capable of receiving and transmitting prayers to the appropriate powers or deities. Some paintings clearly embodied anthropomorphic supematurals them selves. The most obvious support for this comes from the images of the deified sun, moon, and stars painted on the walls of one of the two Jemez kivas. When a kiva is newly built or refurbished at Jemez, reeds are inserted through the north wall at the mouths of these painted images. During the performance of the kiva dedication ceremony, or Huntuki", ritual society members hide behind the wall and blow smoke through the reeds to herald the arrival of the various imperson ated deities that come to visit the kiva. Ellis (1952:155-160) identifies this smoke as "clouds" and indicates a parallel with other rituals in which smoke is used to signify the presence (and approval) of the cloud people. Just as human imperson ators are inhabited by deities, during the Huntuki" the painted sun, moon, and stars also come alive and "breathe" clouds. There are other indications that mural paintings are alive or inhabited by supernatural beings during ritual performances. Again at Jemez, prayers are addressed and com pollen is sprinkled before the paintings as if inhabited by potent forces (Reagan 1906). At Acoma, "seeds of various kinds" are extracted by new curing society initiates from wall paintings (White 1932:113), suggesting that at that moment the paintings represent the deities, who provide for their people as they did at the time of emergence. A correspondence between murals and altars likewise suggests that paintings could hold supematurals. Altars often incorporate a line of commeal leading from the ladder or door of the ceremonial room to the altar (Figure 4); this meal line, as in many other Pueblo ceremonial uses, "is a road for supematurals to travel upon when entering to invest themselves in their images on the altar" (Wyman 1983:203; see also Parsons 1939). U'uwa, a prominent Hopi ceremonialist from Walpi, told Stephen (1936:238) that the kiva paintings "are cloud altars ... and of the same intent and virtue as any other altar made on the kiva floor as elsewhere," and on one of Stephen's drawings of a cloud altar painted on the north wall of Chief kiva for Powamu, a thick line or border is labeled "katcin-ki" or "katsina house" (Stephen 1936:Figure 144). Smith (1952:99) summarizes Stephen's use of this term and states that "katsina house" is "a term applied to various sacred places or shrines or to the bordering lines of upright slat-altars and of sand paintings." Thus the paintings are analogous to altars, which are capable of containing supematurals summoned and "led" to the altar construction in the course of ceremonies. Wall paintings thus can be said to temporarily house and embody supernatu ral forces, just as carved fetishes and human performers are likewise temporarily</page><page sequence="26">108 JULIE SOLOMETO transformed into deities by their resemblance, the application of valuable paint (to fetishes, masks, and bodies), and the faithful repetition of the prescribed prayers and ritual actions.7 By inviting the participation of supernatural and per forming the rituals as they were taught using the original objects provided by those supernatural (such as the black paint brought from the Underworld), the power of these beings is solicited and temporarily controlled. Thus the paintings of the Beast Gods and the bodies of Zuni's Great Fire fraternity performers them selves "become the abiding places of the Beast Gods" (Stevenson 1904:493), and the Acoma curers paint and impersonate bears so they may temporarily harness the curing abilities of these powerful beings. Examination of the cha?ne op?ratoire and Pueblo testimony clearly indicate that Pueblo paintings, when executed with the appropriate materials, properly depicted, and addressed in the correct sequence of rituals are a means of com munication with the supernatural. In fact, nearly every aspect of their production, from replastering, preparation of paint, and careful re-creation of sacred images, has been executed to create an end product worthy of containing supernatural forces. The motifs selected for depiction are both the subject and the recipients of Pueblo prayers. The implications of this study for the analysis of the pre Columbian murals is explored below. IMPLICATIONS FOR THE STUDY OF PRE-COLUMBIAN PUEBLO MURALS Study of the materials, personnel, and socio-ceremonial context of historic era mural production provides a baseline for understanding the meaning of pre Columbian murals and mural production. The usefulness of the baseline deter mined here is dependent, however, on the extent of similarities between the early and later murals, which I briefly examine here. Although there are differences in the appearance of pre-Columbian murals and those observed in the 19th and 20th centuries?the most obvious being the greater detail and greater area of wall cov ered by the earlier paintings (see Brody 1991:169 and Crotty 1995 for art his torical perspectives on the differences)?there are also some important similarities in the operational sequence of mural production and the role and significance of murals in ritual practice. Chemical and other analyses indicate that most of the physical materials? the plaster, paint, and tools?employed prehistorically are identical or similar to those used in the historic era (Crotty 1995; Hibben 1975; Smith 1952). Micro scopic, spectrographic, and chemical tests performed on samples of paint and pigment recovered from Awatovi and Kawaika-a demonstrate that multiple shades of the same color were used; different chemical characteristics of similar shades of blue and of black, for example, suggest multiple sources. Use of rare pigments such as malachite and azurite and the application of ground turquoise and sheets of</page><page sequence="27">THE CONTEXT AND PROCESS OF PUEBLO MURAL PAINTING 109 selenite to mural walls are consistent with the historic era emphasis on the use of "rare" or "valuable" materials. An examination of the spatial distribution of paint types, and thus of the distribution of paint "recipes, " has not yet been attempted, but determining which kivas had access to rare paints, and which images were painted with rare paints, may provide important insights into ritual organization and assignment of value to images. Kiva murals, like the variety of media studied by Plog (2003), hold great promise for the study of precontact color symbolism. Rules of directionality also governed the location of murals and layout of precontact ceremonial buildings. Excavations of kivas have revealed regional pat terns in orientation, with Hopi kivas generally "facing" northwest (with spectators likely seated on the bench found in the southern end of the room) (Smith 1972) and Rio Grande kivas oriented east-west. In the Rio Grande, large plastered and sometimes painted altar/deflectors are found in front of the ventilator shafts (usu ally located on the east wall), and at Pottery Mound niches are invariably found in the wall opposite the ventilator shaft (Crotty 1995). The greater sanctity of the "front" wall, usually the northwest wall, in precontact Hopi kivas is suggested by the recurrent patterning of features in kivas excavated by the Peabody Museum Awatovi Expedition (Smith 1972). "Front" walls were the only walls to contain niches, and sipapus (which resembled floor drums) were found between the fire pit and the front wall. Although the later pre-Columbian Hopi murals (as well as murals at other major precontact sites with multiple paintings) are found on multiple walls, only the front walls of the earliest Awatovi kivas were painted (Crotty 1995). Additional evidence suggests that there were similarities in the function and meaning of pre-Columbian murals and those witnessed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The alternation of painted layers with multiple unpainted layers in many Ancestral Pueblo kivas (see references in Crotty 1995:90-91) strongly suggests that some of the paintings may have been temporary and thus likely had a restricted audience. If the pre-Columbian paintings were covered immedi ately after use, we might also infer that they had power that had to be controlled. The reslipping and repainting of cylinder jars from Pueblo Bonito, and even the removal of painted designs (either through firing out organic paint or washing off fugitive paints) from some vessels without immediate repainting (Crown and Wills 2003), indicate that ritual obliteration, whether to conceal or to contain the power of painted designs, was practiced on other media at least two hundred years before the Awatovi and Pottery Mound murals were created. Equivalence between altars and paintings is suggested by painted arches and other framing devices, as well as the frequent depiction of typical altar items such as prayer sticks, mounds of com, and bowls filled with com ears and cotton (Smith 1952).8 Some of the pre-Columbian altar scenes are so complex that they appear to either substitute for the altar objects or serve as a literal blueprint for altar construction. Compositions that combine altar objects and depiction of</page><page sequence="28">110 JULIE SOLOMETO apparent supernatural beings?analogous to the arrangement of wooden or stone representations of deities placed on historic era altars?further support the notion that paintings of supernaturals were intended to house these deities. Wall paint ings also are integrated with niches in some Hopi kivas, as well as at Pottery Mound and Kuaua (Crotty 1995). In one instance a mountain lion painted in an Awatovi kiva appears to "eat" a niche, and at Pottery Mound niches are found in the midst of a variety of images, including at the center of a sun shield, in a terrace that supports a legless female, and at the focal point of the "Council of Chiefs," a gathering of apparent humans and human-animal and human-rainbow beings. Ethnographic accounts indicate that niches were used to store items of ritual sig nificance (Dorsey and Voth 1902:171; Mindeleff 1891:122; Parsons 1939:342, 768, 897; Smith 1952:6), and they are found at the "front," or focal wall, of pre Columbian kivas at Hopi and the Rio Grande (Crotty 1995:70; Smith 1972:112). Niches may have been locations where prayer offerings were made, or may have held items to be extracted during ceremonies as if given by the supernaturals, just as seeds were extracted from early-twentieth-century paintings at Acoma and distributed to ritual participants. Finally, scenes that appear to represent anthropomorphs and supernaturals engaged in ritual in rooms lined with society paraphernalia?such as the "Council of Chiefs"?have a historic era parallel in the painting and impersonation of bears performing initiation rites for one of Acoma's medicine societies (White 1932). Thus at least some ethnographic data supports the notion that the prehistoric paintings served as blueprints or faithful representations of pre-Columbian ritual practice. The many similarities among historic and pre-Columbian paintings strongly suggest parallels in their meaning to Pueblo people. From this study we might conclude that to the extent they served as "blueprints," pre-Columbian paintings have much to tell us about the actual conduct of Pueblo kiva ritual, while also revealing the great variety of supernaturals invoked by the prayers of precontact ritualists. By calling attention to the context of mural production, this study has one other benefit to offer. While motif-centered analyses of the pre-Columbian murals examine and compare the details of composition and of individual depic tions of plants, clothing, and anthropomorphs, the paintings have yet to be stud ied in context as sequences of images within single structures. Examination of the paintings as sequences has the potential to shed light on pre-Columbian religious organization. Consideration of mural sequences from individual kivas at Awatovi, Kawaika-a, and Pottery Mound reveals that similar kinds of images?be they military themes, predatory animals, fertility imagery, or textile designs?are found on multiple layers, sometimes appearing in the entire recovered series of paint ings. Alternatively, in some kivas one theme alternates with or supplants another. Other kivas exhibit no coherent thematic pattern. Based on analogy with the historic era, rooms with consistent themes are likely to be private society rooms.</page><page sequence="29">THE CONTEXT AND PROCESS OF PUEBLO MURAL PAINTING 111 Rooms with alternating or inconsistent themes may best be interpreted as kivas in more general use, controlled by organizations with multiple ceremonial affili ations. Stylistic analyses that explicitly identify similarities and differences between kivas, or within individual mural sequences, may aid identification of artists or traditions of image knowledge. Finally, the spatial distribution of similar depic tions can be taken as the distribution of ceremonial knowledge within or between communities. Although there are many unique depictions confined to single kivas, some distinctive and complex images?such as sun shields?are found in multiple kivas, indicating community-wide rites; for instance, the appearance of sun shields in multiple kivas at Awatovi and Kawaika-a may be analogous to the many depictions of the deity of Sho'tok?n?ngwa painted in Hopi kivas during the Powamu ceremony. The full potential of the pre-Columbian murals to shed light on ancestral Pueblo ritual and religious organization has not been realized. The historic base line provided by this study provides a new starting point for this important task. What remains is to further examine the similarities, and perhaps more important, the differences between pre-Columbian and historic era murals. I think that this can be most usefully accomplished by using a contextual approach that views mural painting as a process involving objects, knowledge, and people operating within social and religious systems.

NOTES 1. Other archaeologists have similarly broken down technologies into their constitu ent elements. For instance, Schiffer's (1975) behavioral chain analysis outlines the sequence of activities making up a technology and describes for each activity the human and non-human "energy sources" and material items involved; the duration, frequency, and location of the action; the material "outputs" of the action; and "intersections" of the chain under study with other chains. While the ultimate goal of Schiffer's approach is to identify the spatial expression of a site's social organiza tion, the reason for the breakdown of the behavioral chain is to determine the quantity and distribution of material "outputs" in the archaeological record. 2. The handful of published Spanish descriptions of Puebloan wall painting are lacking in detail and thus are not included in this analysis. The observations of</page><page sequence="30">112 JULIE SOLOMETO a number of Spanish chroniclers suggest, however, that animals and anthropo morphs were depicted on Pueblo walls of the 16th and 17th centuries (Smith 1952). 3. Reviews of historic era murals by Smith (1952) and Crotty (1995) include the majority of the observations used in this study. Crotty (1995) briefly treats some of the issues discussed at greater length in this paper, such as the identity of the artists and the meaning of the murals to their creators. 4. Detailed data tables that present all the examined variables can be obtained from the author. 5. The association between plaster and rain can also be seen in the application of mud designs on rafters at Hopi. According to Stephen (1936:198), some girls replastering at Walpi made designs (lightning, clouds, handprints) in mud on the rafters, an "old usage" signifying "the desire of the person making the imprint to grasp at the clouds and bring rain." The reason and logic of these images/prayers should be clear, said one Pueblo informant during the Powamu ceremony, given the bean plants growing in the kiva below the rafters. Stephen was told that the designs were renewed annually, and they can be seen today on rafters in public areas at Walpi (personal observation, 1997). 6. Interestingly, Stephen does not note any appearance or mention of Sho'tok?n?ngwa in his description of the Powamu observances that accompanied the execution of these paintings. Because Stephen does not report and probably did not under stand all the prayers spoken in the course of the ritual, it remains likely that Sho'tok?n?ngwa was invoked at some point during the rites held in the kivas. 7. The interchangeability of these means of representing supernatural personages was recognized by Fewkes (1897:134) in his analysis of Hopi altars and has been more recently discussed by Brody (1991:165). 8. Smith (1952:320) suggests that these kinds of prehistoric paintings may have at times substituted for wooden slat altars, fulfilling the same function. It is interest ing to consider the possibility that the smaller, simpler mural paintings of the historic period (when compared with the elaborate, detailed, and large-scale designs recovered from prehistoric sites) are a result of religious persecution by the Spanish. While paintings of deities and ritual paraphernalia would have been difficult to conceal from Spanish observers, the portable items assembled on the altar would have been more easily hidden and protected.
