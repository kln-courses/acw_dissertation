<plain_text><page sequence="1">Carrie Jaures NOLAND What's in a Name? Yves Bonnefoy and the Creation of "Douve" Readers of Bonnefoy's first major work, Du mouvement et de I 'immobility de Douve, have long wondered who, or what, Douve is. The trend in recent criticism has been to associate Douve with a feminine presence; Mary Ann Caws, an ardent reader of Bonnefoy, has even gone so far as to identify Douve as a specific love object engaged in an erotic relationship with the speaker.1 However, Douve is not a proper name in the French language; if Bonnefoy means to designate a specific woman by the word "Douve," he is appropriating a common noun for this purpose. The Petit Robert dictionary tells us that a douve is a moat surrounding a chateau, an underground irrigation source, and a parasitic worm. The sonority of the word has suggested to critics a reference to Jouve (Pierre-Jean Jouve, a favorite of Bonnefoy's), to Dante (and therefore to his journey towards Beatrice), and to the inquiry: "D'ou vient . . . ?" (Where does [it] come from?). But Bonnefoy has resisted all attempts to pin down the significance of his allegorical heroine. In a recent interview, for instance, Bonnefoy reiterates the essential - and I choose this word carefully - ambiguity of both the figure and the word Douve: Douve n'est pas pr£cis6ment une femme. Le travail po6tique consiste h. preserver cette ouverture. Une figure de femme est 'k pour dinger les paroles; une figure de paysage est 'k pour diriger les paroles Contenu femme ou contenu paysage aide le mot po£tique k naitre. Comme 1' experience de Dieu: on ne sait pas ce que c'est, mais on a des repr6sentatifs. La th£ologie negative apprend h d6truire les representations en les opposant Tune k 1' autre.2 The logical sequence of Bonnefoy's thought might be clarified by a paraphrased reconstruction: he first claims that associations with a</page><page sequence="2">312 FRENCH FORUM female figure or with a landscape "aide le mot po6tique &amp; naitre," that is, they suggest a series of interrelated images which, in turn, facilitate the entrance into poetic language of a register of experience foreign to linguistic expression. As in a negative theology, the poem's figures act as "repr6sentatifs" for a truth - let us say, an extra-linguistic truth - beyond them. Douve, like God, Bonnefoy explains, cannot be figured in language, but may be approached by means of the necessarily inaccurate tools of representation. Thus, in Du mouvement et de V immobility de Douve, the poet narrates the confrontation of the signifying system with that which resists signification. Just as a theol- ogy, even a negative one, must find a name for God, so must the poet find aname for the extra-linguistic. "Douve," then, is the "Dieu" of Bonnefoy 's negative theology. In fact, the first letter of the word Douve, the capitalized initial D, would suggest a relation between the "Dieu" Bonnefoy mentions above - that originary Other resistant to all human representations - and the Douve of his poem. To name Douve, as to name God, is both to affirm the presence of a non-representational entity through a representation, and to deny that representation's validity.3 Naming Douve thus mimes the act of reference without referring, just as the images of God in the Bible are always slightly displaced in relation to a true experience of His presence. It is as though Bonnefoy had dubbed his heroine "Blank"; she is the missing "o" in the Judaic "G- d," a continually self-absenting cause, an "ouverture" in discourse that keeps the semantic river flowing. Douve is not simply a woman or a landscape, but, according to Bonnefoy, a word which refers to whatever ruptures the closure of representational systems. The last sentence of Bonnefoy's explanation draws attention to the fact that the "repr6sentatifs" woman and landscape are there in order to "oppose" and "destroy" each other ("La tMologie negative apprend k d6truire les representations en les opposant l'une k l'autre"). In other words, the associations Douve = Femme and douve = pay sage, and all the images pertaining to them, exist in the poem only to cancel each other out, leaving an empty place in discourse for the Douve that cannot be represented in positive terms. On the level of the poem's principal narrative, there is certainly a movement from identity to dissolution, from life to decay, metamorphosis and, finally, annihilation. As many critics have remarked, in the first part of the volume entitled "Theatre" Douve's body undergoes a violent transformation.4 Her body catches</page><page sequence="3">CARRIE JAURfeS NOLAND 313 fire ("Ce bras que tu soul&amp;ves soudain s'ouvre, s'enflamme"), her head is broken, her features dislocated ("puis c'est la tete qui craque ... A present se disloquent les menuiseries faciales"), and finally she is merged with the earth itself ("Je te vois disparaitre. / L'herbe nue sur tes l&amp;vres et l'eclat du silex"). It would seem, in the context of a negative theology, that the identity of Douve's body is precisely what is at stake in the poem. Its progressive destruction emphasizes her essential ambiguity: is she woman or matter, human being or detritus of the earth? The "contenu femme" and "contenu paysage" continually confront and penetrate each other, Assuring the physical unity of the allegorical agent, Douve. The undecidable identity of this allegorical agent serves as an ideal vehicle for the representation of the unrepresentable; the outside of figuration is, in Du mouvement et de I'immobilite de Douve, an undecidable figure. While it is clear that the two "representatifs" - -femme and paysage - derive from different material registers, the human and the inhuman, it is also important to note that the woman named Douve and the paysage associated with a douve do not belong to the same grammatical category. In the first instance, Douve acts like a proper name designating a woman and the images pertaining to the specificity of a female body derive from the grammatical category of the onomastic. In the second instance, the grammatical category of the substantive douve produces the series of images pertaining to a watery division or a source. The "contenu femme" behaves like a human subject; she raises her arm, she lies down, she speaks. The "contenu paysage," associated with the common noun douve, always contains a body of water, whether it be the "rivi&amp;re souterraine" of Poem VI ("Theatre"), the "Fontaine de ma mort presente" of Poem XI (also "Theatre"), or the more mythological crossing of the Styx in "Aux arbres" ("Derniers gestes"). Implied in the opposition between Douve the woman, and douve the liquid element is, then, the opposition between the proper and the common. This opposition re- mains unresolved; while, on the one hand, the poem seems to be treating Douve as the proper name of its heroine, on the other the poet exploits the connotative power of the common noun douve to motivate the contents of his imagery. It is the tension between these two different uses of the word douve that concerns me here. As Gerard Gasarien points out in Yves Bonnefoy: la poesie, la presence, Douve is not called by her proper name until the fourth poem</page><page sequence="4">314 FRENCH FORUM of "Th^tre."5 In the first three poems of"Th6atre" the heroine is known only as 6 or "6 plus belle." It is significant that her first appearance is as an instance of poetic apostrophe; as we will see, this apostrophic address later becomes emblematic of the proper name Douve. Poem I Je te voyais courir sur des terrasses, Je te voyais lutter contre le vent, Le froid saignait sur tes lfcvres. Et je t'ai vue te rompre et jouir d'etre morte 6 plus belle Que la foudre, quand elle tache les vitres blanches de ton sang. The appellative "6 plus belle" first presents Douve in the form of a superlative construction. But because the line break separates "6 plus belle" from "foudre," it suggests, albeit briefly, her isolation as well as her incomparable beauty. In the pause created by the breath between lines, o stands as an absolute transgression of linguistic potential; she is irrecuperable by the means of metaphor. Then immediately, in the following line, she is submerged in comparison, "6 plus belle" - enjambment - than the "foudre," whose long ou picks up the sound of jouir and anticipates the ou of Douve, while the round vowel 6 echoes the uninflected o in rompre and morte. The rapidity with which the superlative "6 plus belle" is reintegrated into a system of comparison - into, that is, the linguistic system - suggests the brevity of the blink which separates the inarticulable from textuality. This movement, from outside textuality ("6 plus belle") to inside the system of the text ("Que la foudre") parallels the phonetic closure effected by the movement from the exclamatory phoneme /o/ to the narrower, yet more prolonged, "ou" sound of Douve's mediation. The opening (of the mouth, and simultaneously, of the text) becomes smaller as a pure apostophe moves towards a comparison, and then finally towards a name. This graphic (or phonetic) symbolism is carried out in the opposition between morte and jouir as well: the death of the extra-textual 6 is at least compensated for by the jouissance of its naming in discourse as Douve. Du mouvement et de I'immobilite de</page><page sequence="5">CARRIE JAURES NOLAND 315 Douve is, after all, the story of a presence that dies as it is transformed into language; but this death is a pleasuring for the poet as much as it proves to be a source of constant frustration. The apostrophe is, as Paul de Man has pointed out, a potent form of address creating the illusion of an extra-textual presence to which the poem would refer.6 The 6 apostrophe serves appropriately as Douve's first name because the letter actually imitates graphically a hole in the page, an "ouverture" in discourse, as Bonnefoy would say, through which the extra-textual might be glimpsed. Moreover, o bears a resem- blance to the hatless mathematical zero sign, the 0 that designates an absence of value in the numerical system. In "Pascal's Allegory of Persuasion" de Man observes that, like a zero sign, the illusion of an extra-textual referent outside of the linguistic system is necessary if the system is to function.7 That is, the zero sign of referentiality marks a gap in the system, a gap upon which the entire functioning of the linguistic system depends. De Man identifies this zero sign of referentiality as, precisely, the name : The notion of language as sign is dependent on, and derived from, a different notion in which language functions as rudderless signification and transforms what it denomi- nates into the linguistic equivalence of the arithmetical zero. It is as sign that language is capable of engendering the principles of infinity, of genus, species and homogeneity, which allow for synechdocal totalizations, but none of these tropes could come about without the systematic effacement of the zero and its reconversion into a name. There can be no one without zero, but the zero always appears in the guise of a one [or an 0], of a some(thing). The name is the trope of the zero. The zero is always called a one, when the zero is actually nameless, "innommable." ("Pascal's Allegory" 10-11) How appropriate, then, that Bonnefoy's "innommable" - God, death, the denominated extra-textual referent - should appear first as a zero disguised as a name disguised as a zero (o). This implicit naming of a textual absence as o instantiates the transformation of the zero to a one that de Man observes and that, according to his analysis, characterizes the activity of the linguistic system in general. Douve's first name is thus well chosen, illustrating as it does the process whereby the poet forces the extra-textual into language, making the zero (the referent) into a one (the name). However, the hyperbolic comparison "o plus belle que la foudre" in Poem I already suggests that the story will be somewhat more compli- cated. The poet cannot communicate the essence of o (her attributes, her</page><page sequence="6">316 FRENCH FORUM allegorical function) unless she is compared to something, unless, that is, she enters the system of identity and difference that is language. The generalizing and indeterminate apostrophe, the "one" that parades as a zero, must receive a specific name, must become a marker o/specificity, must have, in all senses, a proper name. By the time we reach Poem IV of "Theatre," Bonnefoy has, in fact, advanced the story ofo's entry into language by bestowing upon her the name Douve. Poem IV Je me reveille, il pleut. Le vent te p^nfetre, Douve, lande rdsineuse endormie prfes de moi. Je suis sur une terrasse, dans un trou de la mort. De grands chiens de feuillages tremblent. Le bras que tu soulfeves, soudain, sur une porte, m'illumine k travers les ages. Village de braise, &amp; chaque instant je te vois naitre, Douve, A chaque instant mourir. The naming of Douve at the end of line one is accompanied by two other important changes in the rhetoric of the poem: ( 1 ) "Je me reveille" appears as the first reflexive construction in the volume; (2) the imperfect tense that had dominated the first three poems of "Theatre" is replaced with the striking present tense of "r6veiller."8 It would seem that the act of naming Douve coincides with the speaker's return to consciousness. "Je me r6veille," says the speaker, implying that he has left the imperfect tense associated with the dream state of the first three poems and assumed the specular consciousness of the acute present. This present, a kind of "veille" as described in Poems VII and IX, is the dominant tense of the section until Poem XIX, the final poem, which returns to the imperfect tense and the world of illusions with which it is associated ("Ainsi avions-nous cru r&amp;ncarner nos gestes . . ."). One may well ask why the speaker's return to consciousness is coincident with the act of naming Douve. Perhaps the dream state the speaker inhabited earlier is to be associated with the apostrophic address; accordingly, naming would correspond to a new state of awareness.9 The act of awakening, which initiates most of Bonnefoy's poetic volumes,10 seems to have something to do with a (re)turn to language, an emergence from unarticulated revelation (the apostrophic relationship) into poetic articulation. In Poem IV, then, the discovery of</page><page sequence="7">CARRIE JAURES NOLAND 317 a poetic language is allegorized as the discovery of the proper name. Furthermore, if Du mouvement et de I'immobilite de Douve initiates a new poetics - and I believe it does - then naming Douve in Poem IV of "Theatre" allegorizes the discovery of this new poetics, the moment at which the poet finds the proper means of poetic expression.11 Douve's first name, o, returns repeatedly in "Theatre": for example, in Poem VII, 6 returns capitalized, inscribing herself upon the solid air - metaphor for the poetic monument - in a calligraphic gesture: "O dressant dans l'air dur soudain comme une roche / Un beau geste de houille." Or in Poem IX, where O, again capitalized, is described as an eternal waiting presence (the absent referent?), who is discovered in the poem as dead, that is, already written, named: "O guetteuse toujours je te decouvre morte." In Poem XV O is "douee d'un profil ou s'acharne la terre"; that is, she has been given a "representatif" - as in a negative theology - that is being eaten away, annulled, by the earth, the "contenu paysage," her other "representatif." As elsewhere, Bonnefoy uses the imagery of the visual arts ("un beau geste de houille," "un profil") to suggest verbal representation. Interestingly, both these formulations of o's representational existence are marked by the tell-tale ou sound of douve: donee and houille. From these clues we might conclude that Douve is an allegorical figure that stands for o's written name. As might be expected, the instant the proper name Douve appears, the semantic value of the common noun douve begins to motivate rhetorical choices within the poem: "Le vent te penetre, Douve, lande r6sineuse endormie pres de moi." Her naming coincides with the penetration of both her physical form and her referential identity. Simultaneously, then, the woman more beautiful than thunder receives a name, is raised to the status of the proper, and is metaphorically transformed into a "lande r6sineuse," the aqueous matter of her common origins. This opposition between the proper and the common is conju- gated throughout the poem, but it is hypostasized to an absolute oxymoron in the final line: chaque instant je te vois naitre / A chaque instant mourir." The naming of Douve occurs at the undecidable moment between her death in one register (the human and the proper) and her rebirth into another (the agricultural and the common). The oxymoronic potential of a simultaneous death and resurrection is further realized in the oppositions vertical versus horizontal, and ephemeral versus eternal: the speaker is simultaneously elevated "sur une terrasse"</page><page sequence="8">318 FRENCH FORUM and sunk in a "trou de la mort"; he is illuminated suddenly ("soudain") and eternally ("&amp; travers les ages"). But it is the opposition which Bonnefoy identifies in his critical comments, that is, the opposition between a "contenu femme" and a "contenu paysage," that will most forcefully assert itself on the imagery of "Theatre." The semantic fields governed by the categories "human body" and "landscape" are intertwined and juxtaposed throughout the 19 poems of "Theatre." For example, Poem VI: "rivifcre souterraine quelle artire en toi se rompt"; Poem VIII: "le versant souterrain du visage"; Poem XV: "L'herbe nue de tes l&amp;vres"; Poem XIV: "bouche vertigineuse." Various combinations of light and dark, resurrection and burial also reappear frequently in the poem: Poem XQI: "dclaire par la terre"; Poem XII: "la lampe noueuse des plateaux"; Poem XVI: "au pas des soleils dans l'espace funibre"; Poem IX: "la torche du froid." The structure of antinomy - opposed principles - thus seems to underlie the imagery of the poem; these structural extremes produce a tension through which the doubleness of Douve's identity can be poetically depicted. (Note that the word double is also associated through paranomasia to the word douve .) When attempting to decipher the significance of this strange name, the reader is constantly confronted by an antinomy, so that finally the condition of antinomy itself becomes the allegorical interpretation of Douve's identity. The word antinomy seems particularly appropriate here since its etymology is derived from the Greek anti-, meaning against or opposite, and nomas, meaning the name or the law. The law of Douve's name is, in fact, an anti-law or an anti-name. It is through a juxtaposition of opposite principles or essences - human and inhuman, fire and cold, life and death - that Douve signifies; she denotes the unnameable by being an anti-name, by naming nothing except a zero. Bonnefoy has maintained in his critical essays that the proper name is categorically unassimilable to the commonness of the substantive, a position that differs radically from that which is illustrated by the poetry itself. While contemporary theory emphasizes the semiotic drift that makes creative use of the proper name, Bonnefoy wants to retain the singularity of the referential function. 12 In fact, Bonnefoy has frequently argued that the proper name demonstrates the referential function in its most crystalized form while the common noun operates in the realm of the conceptual, where immediate reference to an extra-linguistic reality</page><page sequence="9">CARRIE JAURfeS NOLAND 319 becomes problematic. In his Entretiens sur la poesie, the poet discusses the importance of proper names and the role they play in his poetry; his comments are revealing in light of the problematics of the proper name that I have been exploring: Et si j'ai 6prouv6 si intendment pour ma part l'attrait d'un vocable qu'un moment de mon ecriture avait vide de tout sens, c'6tait certes d'abord parce que sa syncope dans l'6nonc6 avait incit6, comme je l'ai dit, &amp; la d6coagulation, &amp; l'espoir, mais aussi parce que "Douve," c 'etait dijil un nom pmpre , un nom propre qui sugg&amp;re sous son enigme une veille , qui nous concerne, et non un en-soi, une indifference. Un visage, non une essence. En po£sie il n'y a jamais que des noms propres. (141; my emphasis) The appeal of the proper name is, as Bonnefoy explains, its claim to referentiality; when we call out the name of someone, we refer to a particular person, an individual in time and space, not a general category or abstract concept. The "veille" to which Bonnefoy refers is a metaphor for the relationship of the proper name to the person it denotes: one waits for that person specifically, and the fact that one can call out while waiting offers at least the hope that the person will respond, make herself visible, present. This waiting is thematized in "Theatre" as a relation Douve maintains with everything outside the text. The speaker refers to Douve as a guetteuse in Poem IX, and together they wait to encounter the life outside language which her name promises ("Douve disant Ph6nix je veille dans ce froid"). As a proper name, Bonnefoy explains, Douve is a signifier that promises a referent because it refers to a particularity, not a concept, to a "visage, non une essence." Bonnefoy borrows this last formulation from the philosopher Emmanuel L6vinas, who also considers the proper name to be the only kind of signifier that refers without recourse to the conceptual signifie. Both Bonnefoy and L6vinas are aware that they maintain the purity of the proper name in direct opposition to Jacques Derrida, whose Signeponge - a tour deforce on the proper name in Francis Ponge - proposes quite a different perspective.13 In Les Noms propres, a collec- tion of essays on various modern French thinkers including Derrida, Levinas states his own position in the form of a rhetorical question: "Les noms de personnes dont le dire signifie un visage - les noms propres au milieu de tous ces noms et lieux communs - ne resistent-ils pas &amp; la dissolution du sens et ne nous aident-ils pas &amp; parler?"14 To say the proper name, L6vinas asks, isn't that a way to retain meaning, to denote the specific (the visage )?</page><page sequence="10">320 FRENCH FORUM Bonnefoy argues a similar point in the Entretiens sur la poesie, proclaiming what I will call a "poetics of the proper name." This poetics would produce a poetry in which each word bears the potential of direct reference ("En poesie il n'y ajamais que des noms propres"). Bonnefoy's comments here would suggest that, by pronouncing every common noun as if it were a proper name (and Douve's naming allegorizes this process) the text could maintain an exact correspondence with the context from which it emerges. In a "poetics of the proper name" the extra-linguistic would find its perfect equivalent in the name "Douve"; the text would function according to a system of equivalences between names and their referents in the real world. The independent activity of the signifie, the conceptual aspect of the sign so abhorrent to Bonnefoy, would be blocked. No semantic slippage could occur, no free play of connotation, no icriture. Disparaging the conceptual realm in favor of the deictic particular is a central, if not the central, preoccupation of Bonnefoy's early poetry.15 Du mouvement et de I' immobility de Douve reinscribes this movement from the general concept to the particular referent in an allegory of naming. When Bonnefoy transforms a common noun, douve, into the proper name Douve, he performs the alchemical opera- tion that is, for him, peculiar to the poetic act. Implicitly, if not explicitly, Du mouvement et de I 'immobility de Douve is a meditation on the act of naming. However, this act, performed in the section appropriately entitled "Theatre," is accompanied by an equally forceful dismantling of the naming gesture - allegorized as Douve's reintegration into the common earth. As I have argued elsewhere, Bonnefoy's critical com- ments are often misleading, presenting a poetics that is not in complete harmony with his poetry. 16 In the case of Du mouvement etde I 'immobility de Douve, the simplified account of referentiality Bonnefoy supplies in his essays is greatly problematized by the poetry itself. At first glance, it would seem that the major thrust of Du mouvement et de I' immobility de Douve is towards an incarnation of individual presence at the expense of the conceptual common. After all, the poem is called Du mouvement et de I' immobility de Douve with a capital D. However, Bonnefoy's brief prose version of the narrative, as well as the poem itself, suggest that what is being staged in "Theatre" is not a romance, but a tragedy: "La th6ologie negative apprend h d6truire les representations en les opposant l'une &amp; 1' autre." That is, the "contenu</page><page sequence="11">CARRIE JAURES NOLAND 321 femme" - Douve as a named presence - is there to be destroyed, in turn, by the connotations of her common origin, the "contenu paysage." To oppose the common to the proper is to throw into question, to give a tragic turn to, the "poetics of the proper name." The fact that Douve derives from a common noun only underscores the tenuous nature of any referential gesture; the proper name operates in the text on many levels - as a unit of sound and rhythm (the signifiant ) and as a play of connotations (the signifie). Thus, Bonnefoy's stated poetics operate according to an error with regard to his own poetry. This is not surprising, since, as Maurice Blanchot has observed, "Tout artiste est lie k une erreur avec laquelle il a un rapport particulier d'intimit6. . . . Tout art tire son origine d'un defaut exceptionnel, toute oeuvre est la mise en ceuvre de ce defaut d'origine."17 In Bonnefoy's case, the "erreur" which charges his poetry depends, precisely, on a "defaut d'origine"; Douve, as a proper name, has no origin, or at least, no origin in the category of the proper. Du mouvement et de I ' immobility de Douve can be read as a revelation of this defaut and the complex unravelling of Douve's common identity as its rhetorical elaboration. In "Theatre," then, Bonnefoy stages a confrontation between the two opposing identities of Douve - her appearance as both a proper name and a common noun. The confrontation is produced by a thematic chiasmus that is fascinating as well as enlightening to trace. First, through the naming of Douve at the beginning of "Theatre," the common noun is transformed into a proper name; then, in an almost simultaneous reversal, the absolute referentiality of the proper name is invaded by the signifieds of the common noun (depicted as Douve's physical destruction). A reading strategy derived from Bonnefoy's own critical essays would be inadequate to account for the tension the poem maintains between the proper and the common identities of Douve, for Bonnefoy does not acknowledge the fact that this name is itself a sign, that it will necessarily be caught up in a signifying play having nothing to do with its intended referent. When, for instance, in the Entretiens sur la poesie, Bonnefoy discusses his reasons for choosing the name "Douve," he insists upon the name's resistance to signifying systems: [Avec Douve] je ne voulais pas signifier mais faire d'un mot en somme quelconque 1' agent de la d6sagregation de ces systfemes que les signifiants - comme nous disons aujourd'hui - nc cessent de mettre en place. (137)</page><page sequence="12">322 FRENCH FORUM But Douve is not a signifier "en somme quelconque" - at least, it cannot remain so. In the poetic text, the proper name both motivates and is motivated by other word choices and combinations that constitute the signifying system in which the name figures. While a reading of Du mouvement et de 1' immobility de Douve can be based on a "poetics of the proper name" (and here one might follow the narrative in which Douve plays the central role), it is equally valid to accentuate the less obvious "poetics of the common noun," in which Douve serves not as a sign with a specific referent - the unutterable, unattainable Other of Bonnefoy's negative theology - but rather as a sign that cannot be anchored by an external "real," a sign that belongs to a certain linguistic network or "6criture." If we are to discover this "poetics of the common noun," we must extend our reading strategy to include an analysis of what Roland Barthes has called the "valeur s^miotique" of the name Douve.18 A more accurate estimate of the proper name and its inevitable imbrication in a "syst&amp;me de signifiants" has been proposed by Fran$ois Rigolot, whose "Rh6torique du nom propre" can be used to supplement Bonnefoy's own commentary. Rigolot sketches out a reading method that would take into account the sometimes subversive ways in which a proper name operates in a poetic text. Rigolot calls this reading method a "lecture onomastique" and suggests that it would involve tracing not only the way in which a proper name produces a narrative, but also the way in which it is transformed into a common noun, one that produces semantic, phonetic and morphological variants observable in the text. A "lecture onomastique" would italicize the relation between a mimetic, or referential, use of the proper name and its value as a unit of semiosis. "Ce qu'il importe de d6terminer" says Rigolot, quoting Barthes, "'c'est la valeur simiotique du nom propre, ' c'est-^-dire sa capacit6 de signi- fication (d' intervention &amp; l'int6rieur du champ [litt6raire]) dans lequel il apparait" (468). The "valeur s6miotique" of the name Douve seems to derive principally from the signified content of the common noun douve, and the phonetic material of the signifier. I have already shown how the definitions of douve as a moat or underground channel motivate particu- lar metaphors in the poem, but it is also worth observing how the word operates in the poem as a unit of sound. On the level of phonetic resemblance, the word produces a striking series of echoes : for example,</page><page sequence="13">CARRIE JAURES NOLAND 323 the sound /ou/ reappears in frou, souleves, soudain, and mourir. In Poem V, the /ou/ sound recurs eight times within eight lines: souleve, tourne, pour, lourdes, bone, ou, Poxissant, vous, and of course Douve. In fact, this phoneme is remarkably insistent throughout all nineteen poems of "Theatre," motivating word choices such as boxxche, coxxle, and loups in Poem XVII, as well as the enigmatic sourire of Poem XIX, the bouche souillee of Poem VII, and Couverte, parcourue, soumise, and insoutenable of Poem XI. The poet also exploits the vibratory impact of the /v/ sound: see, for instance, the words visage (Poem XIII), ravin (Poem XVn), ravagee (Poem XII), levres (Poem VIII) decouvre (repeated twice in Poem IX), etre invincible, le venin des lampes (also Poem IX), le versant souterrain du visage (Poem VIII), and vois (repeated in almost all the poems of "Theatre"). Finally, the symbolic oscillation between the /o/ sound and the /ou/ sound that I noted earlier is not only utilized throughout the poem, but also thrown into relief by the title of the volume, Du mouvement et de I' immobility de Douve. The ou is emblematic of Douve' s written form; Douve as a "geste noir" - a sign - is associated with movement, the semantic instability of the common, while the o of morte and of 6 would evoke the immobility of absolute reference. Paradoxically, it is the name, and the vowels and consonants constituting it, which condemn Douve to the play of the common noun, another kind of death, or an ambiguous immortality. The tension created between the proper and the common - the law of the name and the play of the signifier - is by no means uncomfortable for a reader versed in the European lyric tradition. On the contrary, the tension between common noun and proper name is foregrounded in the Petrarchan tradition which informs French lyric poetry and from which Bonnefoy borrows heavily. For example, the name Laura is cut up and reconstructed throughout Petrarch's Rime sparse, appearing alternately as lauro (laurel tree, symbol of poetry), I'auro (gold) and I' aura (air or song). Meanwhile, Petrarch supplies multiple references to the real-life circumstances of the historical woman named Laura, insisting upon the existence of an individual referent for the cut-up and disseminated name. The trick that Bonnefoy plays, however, and one which his commentary almost manages to obfuscate, is that, as I have stressed, Douve is not a proper name; Douve is a common noun masquerading as a proper name. While there are several allusions in "Theatre" to Douve</page><page sequence="14">324 FRENCH FORUM as a guetteuse - a signifier implying a specific referent - in the later sections the speaker wonders whether Douve is not, after all, a simula- tor: "Es-tu vraiment morte," the speaker asks in Poem IV of "Derniers gestes," "ou joues-tu / Encore k simuler la paleur et le sang?" As the poem progresses Bonnefoy seems to doubt more and more Douve's ability to refer to something beyond language once she has entered into it, that is, once she has been named. As the poet indicates in Poem XIII, he wants to capture Douve in a poetic space where "les images ne prennent plus"; however, all he has to work with is images; "This is an image" as well, he laconically observes ("Ceci est une image"). The poet's doubt achieves its greatest expression in the last poem of the section, Poem XIX. While in Poem XVIII the speaker asserts victory ("J'ose k present te rencontrer, je soutiens l'6clat de tes gestes"), we learn in Poem XIX that this meeting with the unfigurable has, in fact, been mediated. Douve's "gestures" are theatrical; Douve has performed reference, she has simulated the entry into language of the extra-linguistic through the allegory of her own death. The "gestes noirs" traced by Douve's arm in the earlier poems have now become representations, poems themselves. Thus, in Poem XIX, the speaker is forced to admit that by naming, he has made of the extra-text a text, he has subjected a referent to the play of the signifying system, the law of the anti-name. While Poem XVHI affirms the referential capacity of the poetic word, it is Douve's existence as sign that is stressed in the last poem of "Theatre." Poem XIX Au premier jour du froid notre tete s'6vade Comme un prisonnier fuit dans l'ozone majeur, Mais Douve d'un instant cette fl&amp;che retombe Et brise sur le sol les palmes de sa tete. Ainsi avions-nous cru i&amp;ncarner nos gestes, Mais la tete ni6e nous buvons une eau froide, Et des liasses de mort pavoisent ton sourire, Ouverture tent£e dans l'6paisseur du monde. Poem XIX rephrases the ordeal of "Theatre" as a version of the myth of Icarus: the mind reaches toward the empty space of the unfigurable, only to tumble back to the earth (sol) of the common sign. The aborted</page><page sequence="15">CARRIE JAURfeS NOLAND 325 flight, however, does produce an effect; the "palmes de sa tete" - figure for the victory of the poetic word - are broken and scattered, and must be reconstructed in a new poetic form. The poem is torn apart by the flight towards its own erasure, then reborn ("renait") as the poet makes yet another attempt in the next section of the volume. The double o of ozone in line two echoes the o of Douve's first name, "6 plus belle." The o-zone is the space of the zero, that hypothetical space beyond representation where the poet would like to be, or at least, where he would like his language to be ("Je te detiens &amp; une profondeur ou les images ne prennent plus"). But Douve, the summary continues, turns the arrow of the voice back towards herself, towards the space of her own linguistic representation and the (phonetic) "play" performed within it. "Ainsi," the speaker tells us, we believed we could reincarnate the gestures that would annihilate mediation; however, the mind having been rejected from the giddy heights, we are forced to confront these gestures in the "eau froide" of language, the dead o of language - that is, in a douve. In a final ironic reversal, the speaker evokes the last meaning of Douve through a metaphor: "Ouverture tent6e dans l'6paisseur du monde." Although Bonnefoy's remarks in the Entretiens sur la poesie imply that Douve is an opening attempted in the thickness of language, in Poem XIX Douve appears as the word that would permeate the thickness of the world. Douve is finally identified by the poet as a signifier thrown out into the world to break its resistance to signing. Thus, the contradictory logic of Du mouvement et de I'immobilite de Douve results in an antinomy which poses Douve as both sign and non- sign, poetic word and referential world. It is worth noting that this antinomy - the one at the heart of the entire volume - is coded into the last line of Poem XIX. The sentence that begins with "Ouverture" and ends with "monde" is actually a tmesis which reverses the phonetic composition of the signifier douve. Ouverture tentee dans l'epaisseur du mon de. X (reversal) d[e] ouve. In between the two broken parts of Douve, the opening and what emerges from it, are the linguistic attempt ("tent6e") and an extra-</page><page sequence="16">326 FRENCH FORUM linguistic substance ("P6paisseur"). Within Douve's name we can find both language and its outside; like a moat, Douve borders the two spaces, but is completely assimilable to neither. "Th6atre" can be read, then, as a logical elaboration of the tmetic structure of Douve's name; the reversal of this name in the last poem of "Theatre" parallels the reversal of the narrative, whose telos first appeared to be the undoing of representation (the decomposition of Douve's body), but turns out to be the acceptance of representation as indispensable approach ("Ouverture tent6e"). But what about the opposition between Douve's common and proper functions? The very fact that throughout "Th6atre" the tension is maintained between the "contenu femme" - Douve as a proper name - and the "contenu paysage" - douve as a common noun - is significant. Why Bonnefoy would choose to elaborate a "poetics of the proper name" by means of a common noun - that is, a common noun that parades as a proper name - is one of those interesting perversions that turns poetry into an antagonist of its own poetics. The possibility that the referential function might be eclipsed by the play of the signifier is always present in Bonnefoy's work, despite his desire to "name," to open the text up to what it is not designed to encompass. It is specifically because "Douve" is named - projected out of silence into language - that she - or it - loses a referential identity. The extra-linguistic is just that - extra-linguistic; the unfigurable is, precisely, not susceptible to figuration. Therefore any attempt to find a "repr6sentatif" for it, to name it, is doomed to failure. As Poem XIX suggests, the poetic word is not "always a proper name"; often it is only a common prisoner, "Comme un prisonnier" - a "Comm[e]un prisonnier qui fuit dans l'ozone majeur." However, the very fact that readers continue to treat Douve as the proper name of a woman is significant in itself. Even against the backdrop of Douve's dismantling, Bonnefoy has succeeded in raising the common noun - and thus poetic language in general - to the status of a proper name. From the moment Du mouvement et de I' immobility de Douve was published, Douve became a proper name. Thus, the act of naming performed in Poem IV of "Theatre" is undone by neither the narrative nor the rhetorical play that follows. While Bonnefoy claims that the competing "repr6sentatifs" of a negative theology cancel each other out, the same cannot be said for the proper and the common "repr6sentatifs" suggested by the name Douve; Douve remains both a</page><page sequence="17">CARRIE JAURES NOLAND 327 woman and a place. Furthermore, she remains both Bonnefoy's dream of perfect nomination ("je ne pretends que nommer") and his practical tool, a sign with which to play. Put simply, the grammatical category to which Douve belongs can never be definitively determined. And this must be so, for if Douve is to represent an ouverture in representation, she must remain resistant to the categories of its system. At the very least Bonnefoy has managed to retain the undecidable status of Douve; the opposition maintained between the common and the proper forces us to read doubly, to undergo, as does the speaker, the unassimilable "eclat" of Douve's signifying gestures. Ultimately, Douve allegorizes the poet's struggle with his own medium; when he pronounces her name we can never be sure whether he calls out for an unfigurable silence or for more words.

Du mouvement et de I 'immobility de Douve suivi de Hier regnant desert [Paris: Gallimard, 1970], originally published in 1958), Bonnefoy defines what he means by a "negative theology" as it pertains to his poetics: "une po£sie veritable," he explains, is made of words which "apparaissent aux confins de la n6gativit6 du langage comme des anges parlant d'un dieu toujours inconnu" (208). The doctrine of negative theology, also known as the via negativa or apophatic theology, is linked to a mystical tradition which includes St. John of the Cross, Moses Maimonides, and St. Thomas Aquinas. Put simply, negative theology argues that God is not corporeal, thus all senses, organs, and speeches attributed to God in the Bible are merely representations, deriving from man's indirect and inadequate perception of His powers. The only way to approach an understanding of God is to negate systematically all our human representations of Him. Bonnefoy suggests his debt to apophatic philosophy in a 1958 interview with Georges Pirou6: "La po£sie doit toujours nier ce qui la porte, toutes les pr6tendues richesses du langage, tout le donn6." "Bonnefoy ou l'acte de d6gager la presence dans 1' absence," Mercure de France 333 (June 1958) 366. 4 A feminist critique of Bonnefoy's work has not yet been attempted. Such a critique would have to insert Bonnefoy into the lyric tradition which typically apostrophizes the dying or dead female figure; see Barbara Johnson, 'The Lady in the Lake," in A New History of French Literature (Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1989) and Jan Montefiore, Feminism and Poetry (New York: Methuen, 1987). When considering Bonnefoy's treatment of the female body, it is also important to take into account the context of his poetic maturation: the French surrealist movement of the 1940s. The female ideal was already being dismembered in the works of his fellow surrealists (Bellmer, Masson, Eluard, Breton); Du mouvement et de I 'immobilite de Douve may be in greater continuity with the impulses of this movement than Bonnefoy is willing to admit. 5 G6rard Gasarian, Yves Bonnefoy: la poesie, la presence (Seyssel: Champ Vallon, 1986) 45. 6 See Paul de Man, "Anthropomorphism and Trope in the Lyric," in The Rhetoric of Romanticism (New York: Columbia UP, 1984) 239-62.</page><page sequence="18">328 FRENCH FORUM 7 Paul de Man, "Pascal's Allegory of Persuasion," in Allegory and Representation , ed. Stephen J. Greenblatt (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 1981) 1-25. 8 Another interesting element in Poem IV: Douve raises her arm ("Le bras que tu soulfcves"), performing the first signifying gesture that will lead eventually to the writing of her name in Poem V: "Gestes de Douve, gestes d£jk plus lents, gestes noirs." 9 For an analysis of the act of naming as constituting a transition from one level of consciousness to another, see Jacques Lacan, "The Function and Field of Speech and Language in Psychoanalysis," in Ecrits (Paris: Seuil, 1966) 30-113. The name, like the third-person pronoun, suggests the intervention of a third party, the Symbolic Father superimposed on the Imaginary dyad of the mother-child (apostrophic) relationship. The move from 6 to Douve could mirror a progression from the Imaginary relation of the dyad ("Je te voyais") to the Symbolic relation of self- consciousness ("Je me reveille") in which language mediates the relation to the Other. 10 See, for instance, the first poem of Dans le leurre du seuil , "Le Fleuve," which begins: "Mais non, toujours / D'un d6ploiement de l'aile de 1' impossible / I'i t'6veilles, avec un cri, / Du lieu, qui n'est qu'un reve." See also the first poem of Bonnefoy's most recent volume Ce qui fut sans lumUre: "Que faire de tes dons, 6 souvenir / Sinon recommencer le plus vieux reve, / Croire que je m'6veille?" 11 1 base my belief in part on a striking image embedded in Poem IV that, to my knowledge, has never received any commentary. I associate this image ("De grands chiens de feuillages tremblent") with another text by Bonnefoy which indirectly explicates its significance. In "Sur la fonction du pofcme" {Le Nuage rouge [Paris: Mercure de France, 1977]), the poet describes an experience which led him to discover his mature, post-surrealist poetics: "J'&amp;rivais- j'entends, depuis des semaines, des mois - . . . mais brusquement quelque chose de noir, de plomb6, s'amassaitdans cette clart6 relative, etquelques mots nouveaux s'imposaient&amp;moi, qui d6chiraient, semblait-il, le parti premier d'6criture. En effet, il s'agissait . . . d' associations obscures, par m6taphore ou m6tonymie (l'id6e d'un sifflement, du changement de hauteur d'un son, assocte k l'insistance du mot feuillage, par exemple), ou d'lnonciations presque brutales de faits (l'annonce qu'un chien 6tait mort 'hier' . . . je cite deux cas pr6cis de ma r6cente experience)" (273, my emphasis). It cannot be coincidental that in Poem IV we find allusions to Bonnefoy's two privileged examples of creative interruptions ("l'insistance du mot feuillage " and "l'annonce qu'un chien 6tait mort") in the image "De grands chiens de feuillage tremblent." The perforation of a poetic text by both the extra-textual event and the phonic and connotative material of the signifier is, specifically, what is allegorized through Douve's naming. 12 For example, in "Les Tombeaux de Ravennes," an essay Bonnefoy published concurrently with Du mouvement et de I 'immobility de Douve , he defines the naming act as one which refers us directly to the object world (his "monde sensible"): "je ne pretends que nommer. Voici le monde sensible. Q faut que la parole, ce sixi&amp;me et ce plus haut sens, se porte k sa rencontre et en dlchiffre les signes" (Du mouvement [1970] 32).
