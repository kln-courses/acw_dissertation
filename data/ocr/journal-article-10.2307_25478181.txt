<plain_text><page sequence="1">REPORTS WARRIORS, NOBLES, COMMONERS AND BEASTS: FIGURINES FROM ELITE BUILDINGS AT AGUATECA, GUATEMALA Daniela Triadan Figurines and figurine fragments excavated at Aguateca, Peten, Guatemala, have unprecedented contextual information. Because the site's epicenter was rapidly abandoned, we have recovered whole and reconstructible figurines from floor con texts in elite residences. In contrast to most Maya sites, these figurines are part of assemblages that were in use or storage when the structures were abandoned, providing a unique opportunity to investigate their function and use. In addition, numerous figurine fragments were recovered from middens associated with these structures. In conjunction with the fig urines found on floors, these fragments point to a domestic use of the figurines. The distributions of the in situ figurines in the elite residences suggest that they were used and possibly made by the women of these households. The study of this data set contributes to our understanding of Late Classic elite household activities and social and gender roles. A preponder ance of male figurines, many of them warriors, may be related to this center's frequent engagements in warfare. Las figurillas y fragmentos defigurillas excavadas en Aguateca, departamento de Peten, Guatemala, tienen informacion con textual sin precedente. El epicentro de Aguateca fue repentinamente abandonado lo que permitio recuperar figurillas enteras y reconstruibles en contextos de pisos de residencias de elites. En contraste con la mayoria de los sitios may as, estas figuril las eran parte de conjuntos quefueron usados o almacenados durante el abandono de las estructuras y proveen una oportu nidad excelente para investigar lafuncion y el uso de estos artefactos. Tambien recogimos una gran cantidad de fragmentos defigurillas de basureros, asociados con estas estructuras. Junto con las figurillas encontradas en los pisos, estos fragmen tos indican su uso domestico. Las distribuctones de las figurillas encontradas in situ en las residencias elitistas sugieren que fueron posiblemente usadas y tal vez producidas por las mujeres de estos grupos domesticos. El andlisis de estos datos con tribuye a nuestro conocimiento de actividades domesticas elitistas y roles sociales y del genero en el periodo Cldsico Tardio.

Mesoamerican clay figurines have long fascinated researchers because they seem to provide an intimate glimpse into past lifeways. They are three-dimensional icono graphic representations of living beings such as people, animals, and supernatural entities, and sometimes of objects. Their function is not strictly utilitarian as is the case, for example, for pottery vessels; they are usually not tools or containers. Like representations in other media, such as poly chrome ceramic vessels, mural paintings, and stone monuments, they show various aspects of prehis toric life and actions. Within their social and cul tural framework, they reveal to some extent how people perceived themselves and their world. This does not mean that we should interpret figurines as if they directly reflect an objective "reality" of the past. Human figurines in particular may "encode only very selected themes" and may only "depict idealized social categories" (Lesure 1999:209). Researchers see figurines as "material points of reference in the negotiation and reproduction of social relations" (Lesure 1999:209, citing Joyce 1993) and a "medium for active constructions of social identity" (Joyce 1993:257). In addition, scholars emphasize the active role figurines play in shaping people's perceptions and experiences of their places in society (e.g., Joyce 1992, 1993, 2003; Lesure 1997, 1999). How figurines were made and how subjects were portrayed depend on the technical skill of the potter, but also, and perhaps more importantly, on specific social conventions and expectations. What is depicted, what is not, and how a figurine is ren Daniela Triadan Department of Anthropology University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721 (dtriadan@email.arizona.edu) Latin American Antiquity, 18(3), 2007, pp. 269-293 Copyright ?2007 by the Society for American Archaeology 269</page><page sequence="2">270 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 18, No. 3, 2007] dered represent choices of prehistoric producers and present an emic expression of some aspects of these conventions. Their function, meaning, and use are also shaped in this cultural context. Clearly, these norms and conventions vary through time and between cultural groups. Thus, as many researchers suggest, figurines should be analyzed and interpreted within a framework of social con straints and specific historical contexts (e.g., Bai ley 1996:291; Haaland and Haaland 1996; Joyce 1993; Lesure 1999; Marcus 1996). Figurines have been seen as an important source of information since the beginning of modern Mesoamerican archaeology (e.g., Butler 1935; Rands and Rands 1965). Early analyses were mostly classificatory and descriptive, and inter pretations were based on direct analogy with attrib utes observed (see e.g., Corson 1976; Robertson 1985; Schlosser 1978; Willey 1972, 1978). More recently, figurine analyses have been incorporated into theoretical frameworks of household archae ology and gender studies. Specifically, female fig urines from the Maya area and elsewhere have been used to inform on gender roles, power, prestige, and the social and political status of prehispanic women (e.g., Brumfiel 1996; Hendon 1991; Joyce 1996; Lesure 1997, 1999; Ruscheinsky 2003). For example, Joyce (1992) uses figurines and depictions on monumental sculpture, as well as ethnohistoric and ethnographic accounts, to argue for gender complementarity in Maya society. Her argument is based on an analysis of male and female activities rendered on these objects. Joyce (1992) argues that men are typically depicted engaged in ritual, dancing, and warfare, and women in reproductive and productive activities, such as child rearing, weaving, and food production. Although on sculptures women are not shown actively engaged in production activities, she pro poses that the cloth bundles and food they often hold indicate women's association with the pro duction of these items (Joyce 1992:66). On the other hand, "small scale images directly represent women's productive labor in the stereotyped roles as weaver and cook," and within the household women are the counterpart to men (Joyce 1992:68). She suggests that the activities of men and women are dichotomous but complementary (Joycel992:66-69). In Classic Maya society "gen der was represented as a product of complemen tary labor by men and women" (Joyce 1992:69). Gender complementarity as a model of gender construction and gender interactions was first pro posed by McCafferty and McCafferty (1988). They argue, based on the importance of the production of essential articles such as food and textiles, that through these activities women exerted consider able social and political power. In the case of Aztec society, McCafferty and McCafferty (1988:46) sug gest that even though gender identities may be pre sented as contrasting, they are part of a "structural whole." They postulate that 'Aztec gender rela tionships were based more on dialectical opposi tions than on hierarchy" (McCafferty and McCaffertyl988:47). "Males and females inter acted as structural complements, dialectically rene gotiating control over resources of social power" (McCafferty and McCafferty 1988:52). Another example of more theoretically based analyses is Brumfiers (1996) study. She proposes that Aztec female figurines represent women's con testation of power in the context of the emergent Aztec state and its misogynistic state ideology. She interprets an increase in the proportion of female figurines from Middle Postclassic to Late Post classic times at two sites, which had intensive inter actions with the imperial capitals, as evidence for a changing gender ideology once Aztec rule was established(1996:151-155).Athird site, much far ther removed from the direct control of Tenochtit lan, had low frequencies of anthropomorphic figurines, and there was little change from the Mid dle Postclassic to the Late Postclassic, which she interprets as evidence that here gender was not con tested (Brumfiel 1996:153). She points out strik ing and consistent differences between the depictions of women on official art and popular images of women, which had little overlap. Aztec figurines typically show women standing, some times with children, a posture that indicates high status and their association with reproduction (Brumfiel 1996:159-160). In contrast, monumen tal stone sculptures depict female deities mutilated, and women in smaller stone sculptures are usually kneeling, a posture associated with the Aztec ideal of modest and industrious women. She argues that in the face of Aztec dominance, female figurines rejected elements of official imagery and consti tuted a "popular ideology of resistance" (Brumfiel 1996:160). Though she states that figurines were</page><page sequence="3">REPORTS 271 made by craft specialists in workshops (Brumfiel 1996:146), an implicit assumption underlying her argument is that women were the producers and consumers of the figurines. However, most of the figurines she analyzed come from surface collec tions with unclear contexts. Although these theoretical approaches have sig nificantly expanded our understanding of Mesoamerican figurines, a potential problem is an unbalanced emphasis on female figurines at the expense of male images (but see Joyce 1992,1993), as well as animal representations. This apparent bias is particularly problematic in the study of Late Classic Maya figurine assemblages where male images are common, as opposed to predominantly female figurines in Preclassic assemblages. I believe this bias is partly due to an emphasis in fem inist theory and gender studies on making the activ ities and social positions of women in the past more visible (see e.g., Boyd 1997 for a short critique). In this context female figurines are often interpreted as a medium in which women express themselves and their relationship to others (e.g., Brumfiel 1996; Joyce 1992). As Joyce's (1992) study shows, the analysis of male figurine imagery adds important information to comprehensively assess gender and social roles in Late Classic Maya society, especially when one asks who made figurines for whom, and how were they used. Although both producers and users shape the social conventions of figurines, and they may be the same persons, the producers are the ones who make these depictions, and therefore have consid erable control over how to express these conven tions. Thus, evaluating who made figurines is important and many studies implicitly do so. If women were the producers of figurines, then how they depicted males reflects a female perspective on social conventions and their perceptions of the social and political roles of males. If men were the producers, then male figurines may reflect male self-awareness and their own interpretation of their social and political positions. If they also made female figurines, then those would arguably rep resent a male interpretation of female roles. Thus, incorporating analyses of male figurine images enriches our understanding of gender roles and social interactions. In addition, an analysis of ani mal depictions in figurines may provide insights into the relationships of the Maya with their nat ural environment and/or religious beliefs based on animal/human interactions (see e.g., Calvin 1997; Grube and Nahm 1994). Rich figurine assemblages from Aguateca, Peten, Guatemala, provide impor tant data on relations between male, female, and animal images. Another problem is the interpretation of figurine use. Pottery figurines from Mesoamerica, includ ing those from the Maya area, are commonly inter preted as ritual artifacts (Brumfiel 1996:147, 149; Hendon 1991: 903, 909; Lesure 1997; Marcus 1996). Inferred ritual activities range from their use as fertility fetishes (Willey 1972:7-8) to religious practices carried out by women in their homes (e.g., Marcus 1996:287). These interpretations vary lit tle from Preclassic to Postclassic objects, though the figurines themselves and how they were made changed significantly through time (e.g., Rands and Rands 1965). In the Preclassic, most figurines were solid, modeled, female figurines, although some hollow figurines and whistles occurred (Lesure 1997, 1999; Marcus 1996; Rands and Rands 1965:536-538). Early Classic Maya fig urines are generally very rare. In the Late Classic period most Maya figurines were hollow, mold made whistles and depict males as well as females, animals, and some supernatural beings with highly detailed coiffure, dress, and accoutrements. Excep tions include the early Late Classic large modeled figurines from the Jaina and Jonuta area (Berlin 1956; Corson 1976; Pina Chan 1968; Ruz 1969) and the figurines from the highland site of Lagartero (Ekholm 1979), which are mold-made and hollow, but only a few of which are whistles. In the Late Postclassic period figurines seemed to have been rare in Yucatan, but figurine censers with elaborate depictions of humans, animals, and deities were common (Brainerd 1958:162, Figure 27, 168, Figure 29, 302, Figure 93, 314-322, Fig ures 98-102, 326, Figure 104). These were most likely the various "idols" of clay that Landa men tioned in his Relacion de las Cosas de Yucatan (Tozzer 1941:94,161) as being used in various reli gious ceremonies. Seeing the dramatic changes of figurine forms, manufacturing techniques, and function, it would be surprising if their use and symbolism did not also change from the Preclassic to the Postclassic. Thus, the "ritual" interpretation of Maya figurines needs to be tested in the framework of specific time peri</page><page sequence="4">272 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 18, No. 3, 2007] ^ w-^ \ Sayaxche A/ \ J* SEIBAL ( \ ARROYO &amp; ^ x?^ DEPIEDRA S \ ^^-^^ __ A TAMARINDITO / /_v DOSPILAS C\ Lake / V) AGUATECA &gt;***?*" \ ? &lt;; ?_ _ _1Qkm I Figure 1. The location of Aguateca. ods and contexts. In addition, during many of these periods figurines may have served multiple func tions, including ritual ones, and may have had mul tiple and changing meanings from manufacture to their eventual discard (see e.g. Reichel-Dolmatoff 1961 for an ethnographic example). Other possi ble functions that have been suggested include toys for children (Ruscheinsky 2003; Willey 1972:8) and bird calls (Willey 1972:8). When analyzing and interpreting Maya fig urines, most researchers must rely on artifacts from secondary contexts. Most are from discard con texts, or in the rare case of Jaina, from burials. These circumstances may favor a ritual explana tion for figurine use. In contrast, many figurines from Aguateca were found in situ in rapidly aban doned elite residential structures. They come from use or storage contexts and are part of the systemic context of these structures (sensu Schiffer 1987). Thus, in conjunction with the rest of the household assemblages, they provide a unique opportunity to investigate who used Late Classic Maya figurines and for what purposes. The Figurines of Aguateca Aguateca is a Late Classic Maya center, located in the Petexbatun region in the southwestern Peten, Guatemala (Figure 1). The city was founded at the beginning of the eighth century as the twin capital of an intrusive dynasty that was probably related to the royal lineage of Tikal and lasted until around A.D. 810. The site is located on top of an 80-90m high escarpment and straddles a 60-70 m deep chasm that divides its center. Despite this naturally defensive position, concentric, defensive walls were built around the epicenter toward the end of its occupation, guarding the access to the main plaza, the royal compound, and elite residential areas along the causeway. Nevertheless, Aguateca was attacked, probably in the early 800s, and most structures in its epicenter were burned (Inomata 1997, 2003). This attack caused the rapid aban donment of the elite residential areas, which resulted in unprecedented in situ artifact assem blages in elite houses (see Inomata and Stiver 1998; Inomata et al. 2002). Because of this rapid aban donment pattern we can date the in situ assem blages of these structures to the latest phase of occupation. Among the wealth of artifacts unearthed during the first phase of the Aguateca Archaeological Pro ject from 1996-2003 (Inomata et al. 1996; 1997; 1998; Ponciano et al. 2000; Triadan and Inomata 2003) were 703 figurines and figurine fragments, most from rapidly abandoned elite residential struc tures and/or associated refuse contexts and middens (Table l).1 This number includes indeterminate fragments that cannot be classified as to their motif or function. Of the figurines, 86 were probably complete at abandonment and were found in situ. The figurines were found in and around Structures</page><page sequence="5">REPORTS 273 Table 1.

M7-22, M7-32, M7-34, M8-2, M8-3, M8-4, M8 8, and M8-13, as well as in various test excavations (see Figure 2). All date to the Late Classic period; in fact, they probably date to the later phase of the Late Clas sic, or the Tepeu II phase (ca. A.D. 700-810) in the Uaxactun chronology (see Smith 1955). Most are what Butler (1935:641-652) defined as X-style. They range from about 4 cm to 29 cm in height with the majority between 4-8 cm. They are sim ilar to the Late Classic figurines found at other sites in the Maya lowlands (see e.g., Brainerd 1958; Schlosser 1978; Willey 1972, 1978). At Aguateca we have not found any fine paste Terminal Classic figurines like the Jimba Phase ones from Altar de Sacrificios (see Willey 1972). All the figurines are from domestic contexts, either from floors in and around rapidly abandoned houses or from refuse contexts or middens, in most cases associated with those structures (Table 1, Fig ure 2).2 This seems to be typical for the Late Clas sic central Maya lowlands, as the same pattern occurs at other sites along the Pasion River such as Seibal (Willey 1978), Altar de Sacrificios (Willey 1972), and Piedras Negras. In clear contrast to the famous site of Jaina (Pina Chan 1968), we have found practically no figurines in burials, which is true for most Classic lowland sites (Brainerd 1958; Coe 1959; Hammond 1975; Schlosser 1978; Smith 1955; Willey 1972, 1978). Figurine Manufacture Most figurines were mold-made, and are hollow. They were manufactured by pressing clay into a mold or molds that form the frontal part. The back was probably formed freely and then attached to the leather-hard, molded frontal piece. Some of them then had modeled elements added. A few solid figurines were modeled. Because they were fragmented and lacked their heads, I could not determine whether their faces were mold-made or modeled. (The modeled Jaina figurines had faces made in a mold.) The figurines have predominantly a buff to light orange-red paste (e.g., 7.5YR 7/4 and 5YR 6/6 [Munsell 2000]) with fine carbonate temper and small ferruginous nodules, which are most likely hematite. Most were probably locally made, as these pastes are typical for Aguateca (Foias 1996; Foias and Bishop 1997:278-283; Inomata 1995:549), and we have also found molds for fig urine heads in domestic contexts (Figure 3). Another argument for local manufacture is that we found several figurines made from the same mold in different structures. The figurines are unslipped, but some have paint</page><page sequence="6">274 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 18, No. 3, 2007] Figure 2.

The back of one figurine was painted with specular hematite. Figurine Functions Most of the figurines found in and around the elite residences at Aguateca are musical instruments (Table 2; see also Stockli 2007); few are solid fig ures. The majority are small whistles with one res onator chamber and two stops of the same size on their back (Figure 4a), producing three different notes.3 The mouthpiece is usually on the bottom of the backside and together with the front legs forms a tripod, so that the figures can stand up (Figure 4b). We have also found some whistles with two or three round resonators in a row that function like a</page><page sequence="7">REPORTS 275 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ p:- Aiiiiii^^^^^^B^ j^^________w Figure 3. Figurine molds and their modern impressions from the northern front room of Structure M8-4. Courtesy of the Aguateca Archaeological Project. flute (Table 2, Figure 4c). The mouthpiece is on one end, and there are usually four stops, two on each side of the second and third resonator, allowing multiple notes. These whistles are blown from the side. They normally have a human or animal head attached to the middle resonator which faces the audience when played. The faces of these person ages and creatures were probably mold-made and other parts such as the ear ornaments and head dresses modeled. The third category of musical instruments are flutes (Table 2). They are long hollow tubes with multiple stops, and a mouthpiece that functions like a modern recorder. Figure 5 shows a complete instrument with six stops. These flutes have small animal or human figures appliqued to their upper part; their faces were probably mold-made, while Table 2.

We also found a fragment of one double flute. In addition to these wind instruments, we have found five clay bells with clappers (Triadan 2006; see Figure 6). Three of them are cats, possibly dead as indicated by their closed eyes; all are of Chablekal Fine Gray type, and of nonlocal manu facture. The clue that these ceramics were bells came when I reconstructed the animal heads, orig inally thinking they were small Fine Gray bowls, and then realized that "long ceramic pendants" that we found in association with these heads in every case were the bell clappers. All came from one structure, M8-4. To my knowledge nobody else has reported similar artifacts in the Maya area, includ ing the greater Palenque region, the proposed pro duction zone for Late Classic Fine Gray ceramics (see Bishop 2003:85-89).4 Figurines of nonmusical function include a type that we classify as hollow-head figurines (Table 2, Figure 7). They are the hollow heads of males, supernatural, or animals that have a wide open ing, like a helmet. They have holes in their eyes and around the neck or ears. Their function is not clear, but they may have been masks for larger figurines. We also have one mold-made monkey head pen dant (Table 2), and two small vessels shaped as grotesque faces. Figurine Motifs At Aguateca three classes of beings are represented: humans (both male and female), animals, and</page><page sequence="8">276 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 18, No. 3, 2007] ____________________________________________________^cm 1 iw IJ 0 5 cm 0 5 cm Figure 4.

The majority of these (70 percent, n = 175) are human, 23.6 percent (n = 59) are animals, and 6.4 percent (n = 16) are grotesques and supernaturals (Table 3). Of the male figurines that were probably com plete at abandonment and found in situ, about one third (32.26 percent, n- 10) are warriors (Figure Figure 5. Complete flute with six stops. An animal, proba bly depicting a coati, is appliqued to the upper portion of the instrument. Courtesy of the Aguateca Archaeological Project. 8). This proportion remains the same, 33.33 per cent, when all male figurines are taken into con sideration. The warriors are all standing, typically carrying a round, key-hole shaped or square tas seled shield and some type of weapon (see e.g., Fig ure 9a). They usually wear elaborate headdresses, Table 3.

Some wear quilted armor or feathered suits (Figures 9b and 9c; see also Tozzer 1941:121-122). One wears a fat man mask. Among non warrior figurines, some have rich and elaborate attire, with large and elab orate headdresses, and normally wear a loincloth or skirt-like garment and bracelets and anklets (Fig ure 9d). Others have simple attire, including two old men, although the figurine shown in Figure 9e may be a depiction of the "old god." We also found one ballplayer. Most male figurines are standing, but some are seated. The differences in the attire of the figurines may indicate differences in social sta tus or sociopolitical context. Figure 7.

They are clothed in huip iles with intricately woven designs and fringed skirts or shoulderless dresses, carry round fans, and often wear elaborate headdresses (Figures 10a and 10b). Other women wear much less elaborate attire, often a simple dress and a very simple headdress or hat (Figure 10c), or no head covering.

A few women are carrying a child, monkey, or idol. One is clearly depicted advanced in age, with wrinkles and sag ging breasts (Figure lOe). As with the males the differences in attire may signal differences in social status or sociopolitical context. The majority (85 percent, n = 149) of the human figurines, including all the females, are small, sin gle chamber whistles. Among the males, in addi tion to the single chamber whistles (80.3 percent, n - 53), seven are solid figurines, three are hollow heads, two are whistles with three resonators, and one was attached to a flute. For the rest (n = 13) a functional type could not be determined. Animals include monkeys, birds, rodents, deer, bats, dogs, coatis, and snakes (Table 4, Figures 11 a-f).

Figurine Distributions at Aguateca As mentioned above, we completely excavated Structures M7-22 (Operation 22A), M7-32 (Oper ation 22B), M7-34 (Operation 21 A), M8-2 and M8-3 (both Operation 23B), M8-4 (Operation 23A), M8-8 (Operation 20A), and M8-13 (Opera tion 14B) from 1996-1999 (see Figure 2).5 We also excavated below the floors of the previously exca vated M8-10 (Operation 14A), trenched the plaza in front of M8-10 and M8-13 (Operations 14C and D) and carried out test excavations in an area close to the chasm, called grieta (Operations 24A and B), around Stela 19 in front of L8-6 (Operation 25 A) and the top of L8-5 in the main plaza, as well as Groups L8-9, L8-8, and K8-3 (Operations 26A and B, and 27A). M8-4 and M8-8 were elite resi dential structures; M7-34 was probably a commu nal structure used for feasting; M8-2 and 3 were small ancillary structures to the unexcavated M8 Table 4.

M7-22 was probably the royal residence, while M7-32 was probably used as an administrative building by the king (Inomata et al. 2001). All structures except for M7-22 and M7-32 were rapidly abandoned and had large in situ assemblages. M7-22 and M7-32 were gradually abandoned, but showed evidence of ritual termination, probably by the enemies that destroyed the site epicenter (Inomata et al. 2001:293-297). We found figurines and figurine fragments in and around all structures, albeit in varying quantities. Most are fragments from refuse deposits, but the rapidly abandoned structures all have in situ figurines that were probably complete at abandonment and left behind either in use or stor age contexts (Table 1 ).6 It should be mentioned that operations 24A and B, 25B, 26A and B, and 27A were midden excavations and in these cases no interior spaces of buildings were uncovered. Structure M7-22. We found a total of 86 fig urines here (Table 1). The majority (95.35 percent) were fragments found in refuse contexts mixed within a thick layer of burned ceramics and other objects in front and around the sides of the build ing that we interpreted as a ritual termination deposit. There were only four figurines that were probably complete at the time of abandonment, all associated with the easternmost room of the struc ture. This room contained numerous complete arti facts, including many used for ritual purposes, and had been walled up prior to abandonment, indicat ing that the royal family had time to remove most of their belongings and store others in this room. It also indicates their anticipation of return (Ino mata et al. 2001). The figurines include two males, one female, and one animal (Figure 13). Structure M7-32. All 47 partial figurines and figurine fragments recovered from this structure came from termination deposits in front of and inside the central part of the building (Table 1). We found no figurines that were potentially complete at abandonment and left in situ in and around this structure. Structure M7-34. In and around this structure we found eight figurines that were probably com plete at abandonment and left in situ (Table 1). Five are males, two females, and one is an animal (Fig ure 13). The majority were found in front of the structure where we also found seven ceramic drums. The majority of spindle whorls were also found in front of the structure. Structures M8-2 andMS-3. In and around these structures we recovered 13 figurines that were prob ably complete at abandonment (Table 1). They included six males, three females, three animals, and one grotesque (Figure 13). The figurines were found in front of M8-3, between the two structures (the back of M8-3 is the front of M8-2), behind the northwest corner of M8-2, and one inside M8-2 near the back wall. Five spindle whorls were found in the same areas, and a ceramic drum was on the C-shaped bench of M8-3. Structure M8-4. This structure had by far the largest number of figurines and figurine fragments (n = 223), almost a third (31.72 percent) of all recovered figurines and fragments (Table 1). It also had the greatest number of figurines that were prob ably complete at abandonment (n = 37), more than double the quantity found in the other elite resi dence, M8-8. Interestingly, this structure also had the most animals. We found eight males, five females, 14 animals, and four grotesques (Figure 13). The majority came from the front part of the north room and the exterior space to the north of the north room. This distribution correlates with a high density of ceramic storage and cooking ves sels and grinding stones. Several ceramic drums, turtle carapaces, and most of the spindle whorls were also found in this area. Structure M8-8. In and around this structure we found 16 figurines that were probably complete at abandonment (Table 1). Six were males, four females, three animals, one a supernatural, and two grotesques (Figure 13). These figurines came pre dominantly from the north room and the exterior space at the back of the structure. Like M8-4 the north room is associated with numerous storage and cooking vessels and the northern and back areas of the structure are where we found most of the groundstone. The figurines were also associated with two turtle carapaces and spindle whorls. Structure M8-I3. We found seven figurines in and around this structure that were probably com plete at the time of abandonment, four males and three animals (Table 1, Figure 13). They came mainly from inside, the front and the back of the center room. One figurine was found in the west room. In this structure the figurines, as well as the spindle</page><page sequence="16">284 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 18, No. 3, 2007] 16 -j-1 14 | m Indet.Anthropomorphs 12-jj- Males 10-1 Females 8-r|- Animals 6-1-1-|-1- d Supernaturals 4-1-1-Ji"H? -1- S Grotesques 2 ?.-L-Bl-SMl?Hia?ri? m Indeterminates o I m I , B^WIl, 131,11 ****** % **? *** **/, Figure 13.

The distributions are based on figurines that were probably complete at the time of abandonment, n=86. whorls, are predominantly associated with the cen ter room and not the west room, which had most of the storage and cooking vessels. One ceramic drum was also found in front of the central room. Another drum and one spindle whorl were inside the west room. We also recovered many partial figurines, fig urine fragments, and one complete figurine from a midden right outside the western wall. In fact, 92.63 percent of the figurines came from this midden (see Table 1). It should be noted that a significant quan tity of this material may have washed down from a midden next to the adjacent Structure M8-10 and thus not all of the fragments may be associated with the household of Structure M8-13. The quantities of figurines recovered from the test excavations were considerably less. No fig urines were recovered from Operation 25A. As a general pattern, the figurines seem to be associated with one of the side rooms and/or back exteriors of the structures, areas that usually con tain high quantities of ceramic storage and cook ing vessels, groundstone, and spindle whorls (Inomata and Stiver 1998; Inomata et al. 2002). The center rooms of the structures are usually relatively devoid of artifacts but contain ceramic serving ves sels, such as plates and polychrome cylinders and sometimes scribal implements. The other side rooms contained evidence of crafting activities. These artifact assemblage distributions are consis tent for all the elite residential structures that we have excavated. Based on the in situ assemblages we argue that each structure was occupied by a sin gle household. The patterns suggest that the center room was used by the household head for admin istrative purposes, while the side rooms were used for crafting activities by elite male household mem bers and weaving and food processing by female household members respectively (Inomata 2001a; Inomata and Triadan 2000; Inomata et al. 2002; Tri adan 2000). Children probably often lived in female-associated rooms and many activities prob ably were also carried out by children (see e.g., Kamp 2002; Rothschild 2002; Sofaer Derevenski 1997). The figurines are also associated with other musical instruments such as turtle carapaces, ceramic drums, and in some cases, bone rasps. Fur thermore, every excavated residential structure con tained an assemblage of warriors, men, women, and animals. However, even though all of these general types of personages and animals were represented, each assemblage was unique and no two contained identical motifs. A large number of figurine fragments (n = 617, 87.77 percent) was found in middens associated with dwellings, which indicates frequent breakage and a utilitarian function (Table 1; see also Inomata 1995:688, 793, Table 8.1). The majority of these</page><page sequence="17">REPORTS 285 fragments cannot be classified as to specific motifs, but most were whistle parts. The high occurrence of figurine fragments in house middens argues against a purely ritual function, where you would expect curation behavior and potential heirlooms, which would decrease their quantity in the refuse (see also Stockli 2007),7 unless breaking the fig urines was itself part of the ritual. However, we nei ther find consistent breakage patterns nor a tendency for specific figurine parts, such as heads, that might have been broken off during ritual destruction. An important finding is that at Aguateca we have twice as many male as female figurines, and this ratio is consistent for figurines that were prob ably complete at abandonment as well as all exca vated figurines from all contexts. Of the 86 figurines that were probably complete at abandonment and found in situ, 31 were males and 15 females; of all figurines 66 were males and 32 females. Aguateca Figurines and Their Social Context The work at Aguateca has revealed interesting new data regarding Late Classic Maya figurines and their sociopolitical meaning. Clearly, the majority of the figurines at Aguateca were musical instru ments, and they were found as part of household assemblages. Also, for the first time we have evi dence that people used sets of figurines that con sisted of representations of different personages or characters. As mentioned above, every residential structure contained figurines of men, warriors, women, and animals. Given their distributions in and around the res idential structures, it is possible that the figurines were associated with the women and children of the household. They occur in the side rooms that have storage and cooking vessels, manos and metates, and spindle whorls, artifacts that suggest that the space was used primarily by the women of the household. Food production, cooking, and weaving are interpreted as quintessentially female activities in Mesoamerica (e.g., Brumfiel 1991; Hendon 1992, 1999). Especially weaving and tex tile production have been described as the "most strongly gendered of activities in Mesoamerica" (Hendon 1999:265) and are seen as a source of power for women (Brumfiel 1991; Hendon 1999:265). Also, in the rare cases where Late Clas sic figurines were found in burials, other than at Jaina, they were usually in women's or children's graves. Healy (1988) reports the excavation of two female burials at Pacbitun that contained figurine whistles and other musical instruments, such as ceramic drums. He suggests that these were the instruments used in the funerary processions of these women and then buried with the deceased (Healy 1988:25). Seeing the Aguateca assem blages, one could further argue that the instruments found in the two Pacbitun burials may have been the possessions of the women they were buried with. That does not mean that the men of the house hold could not also have used figurines. Even though the artifact distribution patterns in the res idences are consistent and suggest different activ ity areas used by males and females, these spaces were probably not exclusively used by either gen der. Moreover, some of the in situ artifacts in the structures may have been in storage rather than use locations. The figurines were also associated with other musical instruments, such as pottery drums, turtle carapaces, bone rasps, and in one case a small shell trumpet. These instruments are often shown being played by men (e.g., Hammond 1972a, 1972b). It is thus possible that some musical instru ments, including figurine whistles, which may have been played by men, were stored in the spaces where women were processing food and spinning. Although some ambiguity remains, if figurines were primarily associated with the activities of women and children, the presence of some figurine molds in these side rooms may indicate that women not only used the figurines, but also made them. As I mentioned above, based on their paste character istics, I believe the majority of the figurines were locally produced at Aguateca. I also think that in general the human figures are stylized or typical representations of types or classes of people rather than portraits of individuals. For example, the female "character" shown in Figure 10a, made from the same mold, occurs in two different structures. In addition, the figurines predominantly depict adults in their prime. Old men and old, presumably postmenopausal, women are only rarely shown (there are two and one respectively in the Aguateca sample), and in the male case they may represent the "old god." It is interesting that the old woman carries a child, indicating that older women may have played a role in child-rearing activities, such</page><page sequence="18">286 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 18, No. 3, 2007] as feeding and babysitting. So, in contrast to Joyce's (2003) interpretation of female figurines from the Ulua valley, these figurines do not seem to repre sent different life stages of women, or men. They seem to represent persons at one stage of their life, adulthood, and possibly of different social ranks or in different sociopolitical contexts, given the dif ferences in elaborateness of clothes and accou trements. Thus, it is possible that these figurines reflect an artistic interpretation of some social roles and classes mainly from the perspective of the elite women of Aguateca, and maybe they were also used as educational tools and toys for the children. The representations of animals were important as well. Maybe the figurine assemblages were a rep resentation of certain aspects of the universe for the children. Figurines constitute one of the media in Clas sic Maya art where women are shown prominently, and it is thus significant that women may have been the ones who created these representations. Joyce (1992:63) argues that "gender in Classic Maya soci ety was constructed through image-making." Depictions of women on stone monuments are much rarer and they are often shown in scenes that take place inside of palace rooms, as is the case of the Yaxchilan lintels (Graham 1979:73,91,95,115, 117, 119,123; Graham and Von Euw 1977:13,21, 25, 35, 37, 39, 43, 53, 55, 57) or the tablets of Palenque (Robertson 1983:l:Figure 39, 2:Figure 92, 3: Figures 38, 182, 271, 4:Figures 176, 229). Depictions of women on stelae are even rarer. Ste lae were usually erected in the plazas of the ritual precincts of Maya cities and were accessible to large segments of the population (see Inomata 2001b, 2006). The stone monuments that show women are in most cases less publicly visible than stelae. They are often panels set in building walls or door lintels, and one has to be nearby to view them. These monuments do depict women taking part in important ceremonies and events, such as ritual blood letting and royal accessions. It seems that noble women's participation was an important part of rituals, but their performances tended to be less visible to the general population than some of the actions performed by male elites. It should be mentioned that the canon of people and animals on stone monuments is much more limited than that on polychrome ceramics and figurines, and most people portrayed are male kings. Thus, these mon uments are obviously only a limited representation of society or activities that took place. Depictions of women as figurines, objects that were probably used in and around elite structures, and could be seen in their details only close-up and in intimate interactions, on the one hand may support the idea that women had somewhat less publicly visible roles than men, but on the other may emphasize the important ritual and official roles they performed. If the figurines represent an elite female com mentary on social conventions, it is significant that no females in our sample are shown engaged in domestic activities and few in child rearing ones (cf. Joyce 1992:66-68,1993:261,1996:188-189), and that children are not represented as figurines.8 Scholars who interpret gender roles in Mesoamer ican societies as complementary argue that women's domestic labor, such as weaving and food production, and reproduction are an important com plement to men's activities (Joyce 1992, 1993; McCafferty and McCafferty 1988). However, it should be noted that Classic figurines that depict women engaged in weaving and food production are exceedingly rare in all Classic assemblages. There are five figurines of weavers, presumably from Jaina (only one was found in excavations there; the others are unprovenienced [Delgado 1969; Miller 1975; Scheie 1997]). Women engaged in food production activities are also very rare and certainly not the norm for the female figurine imagery. It may then be more significant that women are so infrequently depicted engaged in domestic activities in these small-scale images, especially if they made them. It looks as if to some extent elite women at Aguateca were emphasizing roles and responsibilities that were in the same realm as that of elite men, and actually downplay ing their domestic activities. Elite women had important social and political roles outside the sphere of domestic activities, and these activities may be emphasized in the figurines. For instance, the elaborate headdress and attire of some of the noble women depicted on figurines mir ror those on stone monuments and Late Classic polychrome vases. In fact, the headdress of the woman shown in Figure 10a shows a remarkable resemblance to a headdress worn by a noble lady on Panel 19 from Dos Pilas (Houston 1993:115, Figure 4-20), as well as that of her husband, Ruler 3 of Dos Pilas/Aguateca. Both are officiating in an</page><page sequence="19">REPORTS 287 accession ritual. Thus, these elaborate headdresses may identify high-status women who participated in official and ritual acts. In the case of the figurines, which are more ubiquitous and are found in house hold assemblages, these depictions may represent one of the roles that were performed and expected of elite women. Children are rarely visible in Maya art and, curi ously, are also seldom depicted in the figurines. There are no figurines of children at Aguateca, which is also true for other southern lowland assem blages, and only a few figurines show women with children. This absence is surely significant, given that children probably constituted a considerable segment of the household and likely contributed to household labor (Scott 1997:7); they are clearly underrepresented in artistic representations. Many objects made for and used by children were the "products of adult activity" and "can tell us about adult views of childhood and appropriate child hood experiences" (Kamp 2001:24). If figurines were made by adults, possibly women, which their technical execution seems to indicate, then if they were partially used as children's toys, they may reflect what the Maya deemed important as social examples for children?adult role models. They may also have aided in the gender development of children (Sofaer Deverenski 1997:194-199). Many of the male figurines at Aguateca are war riors. Their costumes and posture are similar to those of the rulers depicted on Dos Pilas and Aguateca stelae (Graham 1967:3-29; Houston 1993:69?94). They may exemplify a pivotal and public role of elite men in the Late Classic (Joyce 1993:261). The association of these figurines with women, and potentially children, may have rein forced social and political roles of men of high rank. It should be noted that, like the female fig urines, males are not depicted engaged in daily domestic activities, such as scribal work. Many of the warrior figurines have heavy armor and very large and elaborate headdresses. Some also carry possible manoplas (see e.g., Figure 9a). This attire differs from that of warriors shown in battle scenes on polychrome ceramics or those depicted in the murals of Bonampak (Miller 1986:Plate 2). Hence some of these figurines may be representations of warriors in ritual settings or ritual battles. Maya warfare has a strong ritual com ponent and ritual battle enactments through the sac rifice of war captives or the ball game were com mon and served as participatory events for the whole community (see Inomata and Triadan 2008). The prevalence of warriors may also indicate that war was a reality or at least a major preoccu pation in the lives of the elites and especially the women at Aguateca. The presence of twice as many male than female figurines is clearly an uneven rep resentation of the actual population, especially if one takes into consideration the potential for polyg yny in elite households. If figurines were primar ily used in women's domains, and if women were their producers, the under-representation of women, especially of those engaged in domestic activities like weaving and food processing, is par ticularly significant. The themes of power and war represented in the figurines may reflect the reality of a city that was constantly engaged in warfare. In this context the ideological role of elite males as warriors may have been especially important. On the other hand, toward the end of Aguateca's occu pation, there may also have been an element of fear, and the abundance of warrior imagery may have been a reaction to it. Dos Pilas, the twin cap ital of Aguateca, may have been attacked around A.D. 760 and the fourth ruler of the Aguateca/Dos Pilas dynasty disappeared from the records. The fifth ruler moved permanently to Aguateca, and surviving populations at Dos Pilas dismantled the facades of the monumental buildings in Dos Pilas's main plaza and built two rings of concentric, defen sive walls around the area, some of which ran right up the central stairways of some of the main pub lic buildings (Demarest et al. 1997). As mentioned above, even at the highly defensible city of Aguateca, systems of defensive walls were erected toward the end of its occupation (Inomata 1997, 2003). These constructions indicate a continuous threat of invasion, which would certainly have affected Aguateca's population, including the elites. The elite residential areas were those that were ulti mately burned and rapidly abandoned. Animals, significantly represented in the Late Classic figurines from Aguateca (Figure 11), may represent spirit alter egos or wayob (Calvin 1997; Grube and Nahm 1994; Houston and Stuart 1990). Or, seeing the preponderance of owls, some of them may have been bird calls. The sound of the small single chamber whistles resembles the call of owls. Owls and other birds are almost always whistles</page><page sequence="20">288 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 18, No. 3, 2007] nil, l^^^n ^^V *"^^ a -^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 4^-Il ^^^^^^^^^H H - i^^BbuJ^^^^H^BH^H^^K^ ^^i^wv ~' r_________m^^^ij_______, ^it** ^l Figure 14.

However, owls (kuy) are also associated with warfare in Maya iconography (Grube and Scheie 1994), and they are part of the warrior cos tume (e.g, Aguateca Stela 2 and Dos Pilas Stela 16 [Graham 1967:Figures 4-7]), especially elements associated with Teotihuacan. In the Popol Vuh, owls are also the messengers of the Lords of Xibalba (the underworld) (Tedlock 1985:109-110, 115, 158). Interestingly, monkeys, the most common ani mal motif (see Table 4), never occur as simple, real istic animal figurine whistles. They appear most often attached to flutes and whistles with multiple resonators (see e.g., Figures 4c and 1 la), wearing fancy headdresses and often display humanlike poses. This seems to indicate that they are not rep resented as animals in their natural state, but as beings imbued with special characteristics and powers. In the Popol Vuh monkeys are the patron deities of scribes and musicians (Tedlock 1985:105, 119-120, 122-124), and on Late Classic ceramics they are shown as scribes. "One Monkey and One Artisan became flautists, singers, and writers; carvers, jewelers and metalworkers as well." (Ted lock 1985:105 [emphasis added]). "So they were prayed to by the flautists and singers among the ancient people, and the writers and carvers prayed to them" (Tedlock 1985:124). They are also the half brothers of the Hero Twins Hun Hunapuh and Xbal anque. These beliefs may explain their association with instruments that could play complex melodies. It is intriguing that the majority of the figurines are wind instruments that cannot only be seen but also heard, and that they were found together with other musical instruments. There was clearly a strong association between representations of liv ing beings and sound in the Late Classic. Maybe the sound gave these beings their souls? I think that the figurine ensembles that we found in the residential structures were probably played together as a group (Figure 14). The male female ratio of figurines is the same in both in situ and mid den contexts and other motifs also occur in the same proportions. These distributions support the notion that groups of figurines were used together. In addition, all of the whistles and flutes face the audience when played. Thus, the playing of these instruments was not only an auditory but also a visual and theatrical performance, though the audi ence was probably small. The small scale of the fig ures indicates an intimate setting for the audience, because details would not be visible from far away. Seeing the diverse characters involved in these groups, the scene must have been quite remarkable and potentially funny. Some of the characters are comical and may have served as clowns (see, for example, the fat rodent, third from right in Figure 14). Taube (1989) suggests that some of the com ical animals and humans were representations of ritual clowns (see also Redfield 1936). These fig urines, along with the nobles in elaborate attire and the warriors in ritual regalia, may have been rep resentations of public ritual characters. They may have been used in reenactments of public rituals in smaller, daily contexts, and may have emphasized those roles of adults. Figurine whistles are not shown in Late Classic Maya art, whereas there are many representations of other musical instruments, such as large drums, rattles, and trumpets on murals and polychrome vases (Hammond 1972a, 1972b). Usually the scenes in which musicians are depicted are public events, like those on the murals of Bonamapak, or</page><page sequence="21">REPORTS 289 take place in the rooms of palaces of rulers and other persons of high rank. The musicians in these scenes are invariably men. The clay figurine whistles from Aguateca indicate that women, and possibly chil dren, may have been musicians too, who played music in more intimate settings, including in and around their homes. It is possible that the whistles and flutes were used in some rituals that involved the playing of music. The figurines may have played a role as deities or fetishes on house altars. However, depic tions of supernatural beings or deities are limited, and incensarios are also rare in the ceramic assem blages of the elite structures. In addition, the high frequency of figurine fragments without consistent breakage patterns in domestic middens argues against a purely ritual function. The fact that most of the figurines are musical instruments rather than statuettes or censers stands in contrast to what Landa documented for the Postclassic Yucatan (Tozzer 1941). In the late Postclassic, anthropo morphic censers and other clay figurines were prob ably used in public and domestic rituals. Conclusions The Late Classic figurines found in and around the elite residences along the causeway of Aguateca were primarily household items that eventually ended up in the household trash. Most of them were probably produced locally and most were small whistles. Their absence in burials and a scarcity of supernatural representations may support the assumption that they had quite mundane functions. It is possible that women were the producers and also the main users of the figurines. Maybe chil dren also played with them. They may thus repre sent an interpretation from the point of view of the elite women of Aguateca of some of the social and political roles of gender, as well as the roles ani mals played in the society and the ideological sys tem. In this context they could have been an educational tool for children, playfully reinforc ing accepted roles, looks, and behavior (Ruschein sky 2003). Looking at the ensembles of figurines, there seems to be a whimsical and theatrical qual ity about these little figures. They remind me of the puppets of the German "Kasperletheater," shows that were produced for children (often by children), with known characters, such as Kasperle, the policeman, the robber, the grand mother, the crocodile, and so on who told tales with morals about good and bad. On the other hand, with their emphasis on males and warriors, these ensembles may also reflect the concern of the elites (especially the women) with a very unstable regional political situation that was characterized by constant engagement in warfare. This situation may have prompted the glorification of the war rior ideal expressed in the high frequencies of these figurines. Another aspect that the figurines highlight is the importance of music in Late Classic times. Ham mond (1972a, 1972b) and Healy (1988) have demonstrated the ubiquity of musical instruments as artifacts as well as artistic renderings in the Late Classic and Postclassic periods. They describe music as important in warfare, dances, processions, and rituals. It seems clear that playing music was an important activity of elite households at Aguateca and women and children may have been the principal performers in this context (see also Stockli 2007). The audience for these events was probably small, given the small scale of the figures. Different households likely had different prefer ences for specific characters, but all ensembles had some basic types in common. These activities are not recorded in vase scenes, however, while other administrative events carried out by elites are, including serving food and drink and receiving guests and gifts. Thus, the figurines add a whole set of performative activities that were carried out by elite households. The case of Aguateca strongly supports the notion that figurines need to be analyzed and inter preted within a framework of social constraints and specific historical contexts and provides important new data. These data reinforce the idea that Late Classic Maya figurines likely had multiple and changing functions throughout their uselives, many of them probably not associated with ritual activi ties.

Takeshi Inomata, who directed earlier excavations as part of the Petexbatiin Regional Project, directed by Arthur Demarest from Vanderbilt University, previously recorded and analyzed 317 figurines (Inomata 1995:Table7.12). Thus, to date we have recovered a total of 1,020 partial, recon structive, and whole figurines from Aguateca. One-hundred eleven figurines were also recovered by a Guatemalan restoration project in 1999 and 2000 thus the total number of figurines and figurine fragments found at Aguateca is higher (Valdes et al. 1999, 2000, 2001). 2. Inomata found 14 figurine fragments in Str. M8-17. He interpreted this structure as a possible shrine (Inomata 1995:190-195). 3. These three-tone whistles are often called ocarinas (Hammond 1972b:226; Healy 1988:30). 4. Some long ceramic pendants that are very similar to the Aguateca clappers have been found at Piedras Negras recently and Coe (1959:71, Figure 59e) reported one from earlier excavations at that site. They are not made of Fine Gray paste however. Terminal Classic ceramic bells are also reported from the Pacific Coast at the site of Finca El Paraiso, Quetzaltenango. At least one of them is plumbate (Shook 1947:179-184; see also Shepard 1948:126). 5. Structures are numbered according to major grid des ignations of the site map (Inomata 1995). Operation numbers pertain to excavations within a plaza group of structures and are numeric (e.g., Operation 14). Excavations in individual structures within a group are suboperations and are given a letter designation (e.g., Operation 14B designates excavations in and around Structure M8-13 of Group 2). 6. For this analysis I considered all figurines found in situ as complete at time of abandonment. 7. An exception may be the figurines from Structure M8 17, excavated in 1991. Structure M8-17 was probably a shrine (Inomata 1995:190-195). Fourteen figurine fragments were found in this structure, and six more in a midden behind the structure that was probably associated with a low plat form, Structure M8-54 (Inomata 1995:697). These figurines may thus indicate that they were used in some rituals. Interestingly, the majority were figurines rather than whistles (Inomata 1995:550-551, Table7.14), in contrast to the fig urines from the elite residences. However, even in this con text, not very many supernatural representations were found. 8. One kneeling female figurine with a metate was found by the Guatemalan restoration project in Structure M8-11 (Valdes et al. 2001:780, Figure 7). Submitted April 12, 2006; Accepted June 6, 2006; Revised January 9, 2007. No conflicts of interest were declared by reviewers.</page></plain_text>
