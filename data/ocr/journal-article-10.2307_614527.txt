UCKO : Anthropomorphic figurines of predynastic Egypt and neo- lithic Crete with comparative material from the prehistoric Near East and mainland Greece. (Royal Anthropo- logical Institute Occasional Paper No. 24.) xvi, 530 pp. London: Andrew Szmidla, [1968]. ?6 16s. This is a very ambitious book and is clearly a compilation of much painstaking and thought- ful research. The author brings together, with full descriptions and many illustrations, all the 227 predynastic Egyptian figurines which he considers undoubtedly authentic and all the known Cretan specimens (103). He has per- sonally examined over half the Egyptian figures and two-thirds of the Cretan ones. Of the Egyptian figurines, however, only one- third come from datable contexts, making their discussion and analysis of necessity more speculative than that in the Cretan section. The value of the latter is considerably enhanced by the inclusion of 36 figurines from the recent excavations of Professor J. D. Evans at Knossos. The descriptive catalogues are followed by lengthy reviews of the existing literature and finally by suggested typologies, summarized in chart form. In addition comparative material is drawn from the prehistoric Near East and Greece, although it is not the author's intention to present comprehensive analyses, as in the parallel sections for Egypt and Crete. His stated purpose is ' to establish whether specific features or combinations of specific details can be considered typical for the area or culture under consideration', and it is remarked that ' space allows only presentation of conclusions and limited discussion of individual figurines '. Following the almost excessive elaboration of principles and analyses in the earlier parts of the book, this is a surprising attitude and produces several unconvincing chapters. The material available in the Near East up to 1964 (the date of the completion of the manuscript) is far more extensive than the author seems to realize, and deductions drawn from a limited sample should not have been used in the type of statistical analyses attempted here. It is unfortunate that this incomplete treatment of peripheral material falls below the standard of the earlier sections. Perhaps the most serious weakness of the book is the deliberate omission of any discussion of the archaeological context of the figurines. The author is partly aware of this; he writes in the introduction, 'Ideally, of course, any study of figurines should include a survey of other small-find material, but this will not be attempted here. Of primary interest here are the figurines themselves rather than the character of the associated archaeological assemblages. Likewise, connections between areas as deduced from general archaeological material are of less concern here than links specifically deduced on the basis of figurines. Any correlations between the evidence of the figurines and other archaeological material must be left for another study '. Considerations of space, money, and readability must limit the quantity of material that can be included in any one book, and the extensive analyses of the Egyptian and Cretan figurines already occupy 342 pages before the author turns to the Near East, Greece, and, finally, his con- clusions. For these reasons one can perhaps find some excuse for the somewhat cursory treatment of this latter material and the author's unwillingness to extend further the scope of the book. Nevertheless, one must view the lack of any consideration of archaeological context as a serious limitation on the validity of his conclusions. An attempt is made to establish inter-country parallels on a purely numerical basis, drawing on individual characteristics numerically described and evaluated, but such links are extremely tenuous-' the absence of mouths on Hacilar and some Mesopotamian figures is perhaps the most likely feature to indicate a connection between the two countries' (p. 395). More- over, the author seems unaware, in noting parallels between, for example, ' Cretan figurines and Jarmo and 'Ubaid figurines in Mesopotamia ', that the Jarmo and 'Ubaid assemblages are 3,000 years apart in time, occur in geographically disparate areas, and are not, on present evidence, culturally connected. The concluding chapters are devoted to the question of the significance and purpose of the figurines with, again, an extensive review of existing literature. Two sections are devoted to disposing of the Mother Goddess theory, not without some tilting at windmills. A third offers a wide variety of possible interpreta- tions. The apotropaic use of clay figures, well attested in historical periods in Mesopotamia, is perhaps not adequately investigated, but the discussion is both useful and wide-ranging. Dr. Ucko is unfortunate in that, since this volume was written, extensive new discoveries</page><page sequence="2">604 REVIEWS in Greece, Anatolia, Turkmenia, Mesopotamia, and elsewhere in the Middle East have changed the previously existing picture beyond recogni- tion, but we must be grateful to him for providing a solid basis in Egypt and Crete for further comparative studies. The volume includes an extensive bibliography and many illustrations, though the drawings are curiously flat and lifeless and the inconsistent format of the half-tones can be confusing.
