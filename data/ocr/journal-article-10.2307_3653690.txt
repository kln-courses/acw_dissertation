Eubanks, Corn in Clay: MaiZe Paleoethnobotany in Pre-Columbian Art (Gainesville, Florida: University Press of Florida, 1999), pp. xvi+249 ?42.50, $49.95 hb. In this book, Mary Eubanks presents a corpus of Moche and Zapotec pottery in which maize is represented in relief. Moche and Zapotec potters made moulds by impressing clay round real ears of maize and incorporated the mould-made ears into the design of the pot. She argues that races of maize are distinct and, when shrinkage of the clay is taken into account, the clay versions can be identified on the basis of specific criteria that include measurements of kernel width and thickness, ear shape and row number. Since the distribution of maize races is localised, she considers that the moulded clay ears have a good potential for demonstrating that cultural contact occurred between the two areas. Zapotec pottery from Oaxaca, Mesoamerica, and Moche pottery from northern coastal Peru come from two widely separated regions, but she observes that their chronology is roughly similar. Chapter two, entitled 'Moche effigy jars', contains the corpus of Peruvian material examined by Eubanks. Most of the pots are effigy jars surrounded by moulded ears of maize with a face, often characterised by fanged teeth and large ear spools, depicted at the neck of the vessel. There are other types of pot in the inventory, including a few from other cultures and periods, such as the Chimu depictions of 'baskets of maize' on jars with a flaring neck. The Zapotec urns in chapter three include excavated pieces from the site of Monte Albin. Most of the urns consist of a cylindrical vessel with an anthropomorphic or theriomorphic figure built onto the front of the vessel. The maize ears are incorporated into the headgear or on other parts of the body of the figure. Other urns do not have an attached figure and they are encircled by ears of maize. Chapter four takes a closer look at methodological factors in order to assess the reliability of the identifications. On p. I63, Eubanks says that she identified sixteen maize races on 129 ceramics - fourteen races on seventy-two Peruvian ceramics and eight on fifty-six Mexican ceramics. Six races occurred on pottery from both the areas. By p. i85 and p. 20I, the numerical results have changed; she says nineteen races were identified with sixteen races on the Peruvian ceramics and ten on the Mexican ones. She adds, 'Eight of the same races appear on jars from both regions' (p. I85). Presumably this apparent discrepancy is due to the fact that some of her identifications are to more than one race. For instance the measurements obtained from many of the Peruvian examples of moulded maize ears fit within the characteristics for ear length, diameter, row number and kernel characteristics in Pira maize from both Venezuela and Colombia as well as Nal Tel maize from Mexico. On p. I86, Eubanks says that she considered Nal Tel and Pira as 'one and the same for the purposes of this study because they are</page><page sequence="2">4Io Reviews indistinguishable morphometrically and phenetically', but it is evident that she grouped together some other pairs with similar characteristics as well. In chapter five she discusses the implications of her identifications and the diffusion of races of maize between the two areas. Her study shows that the South American maize races of Confite Puntiagudo/Canguil, Oke, Karapampa and Puya were represented on Zapotec urns, and the Mesoamerican race of Chapalote on Peruvian jars. Observing that 'maize does not have a natural mechanism for seed dispersal and is therefore entirely dependent on humans for its survival' (pp. 99-200), she argues that people took these maizes from one area to the other before oo AD. Eubanks also uses stylistic evidence to support her case. She only found one example of a figure depicted with crossed-legs on a Moche vessel (fig. 40), but it is a common characteristic of Zapotec urn figures. Equally there is an example of a Zapotec pot with the vessel itself forming the body of the figure (fig. 107), a common feature of Moche pottery. Corn in Clay is a fascinating book for raising issues not only concerning the diffusion of maize, but also for highlighting implications for understanding stylistic variation in local traditions when cultural contact with anther area can be demonstrated to have occurred from independent strands of evidence. The book would have benefited from more careful editing. A comment on p. i i6 directs the reader to a pectoral glyph in fig. 88, but the item in the photo- graph is fragmentary and does not have a pectoral glyph. On p. 177 it is claimed that Oke is depicted on figs. 21 and 22, but it is not. The reference to 'Z-i6, fig. 94' on p. 178 should read 'fig. 95'. Figure 42 has an inaccurate caption. Another problem occurs on p. 177, where the Quebrada de Humahuaca in Argentina is erroneously mentioned as being at the 'southern boundary of the Inca Empire in pre-Columbian times'. Eubanks accepts rather uncritically the more recent name Ai-apaec for the anthropomorphic personage on the Moche vessels on the grounds that the identification is 'conventional' (p. 30). It is not clear to me whose convention this is. For the sake of consistency she decided to impose the term 'Classic', which is used in Mesoamerican archaeology, on the Andean material as well, going against current practice. Whereas the Zapotec ceramics have rather more provenance data associated with them, most of the Moche ceramics she discusses lack such information. With few exceptions, the publications she consulted on the Moche tend to be rather dated. Recent excavations of Moche sites are producing a wealth of data, including examples of pots with moulded maize from secure archaeological contexts (e.g. San Jose de Moro). This new material should provide Eubanks with further information to refine her intriguing research on the evolution of maize and the role of cultural contact between different regions of the Americas in the process.
