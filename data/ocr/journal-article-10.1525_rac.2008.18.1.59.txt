Evans In the opening scene of Marc Connelly’s The Green Pastures (1930), ten black children are sitting in what appears to be a classroom. They are listening with varied degrees of attention to an elderly preacher who reads the genealogy narratives from Genesis, the first book of the Hebrew Bible. The actual setting is the corner of a black church. The preacher, Reverend Deshee, is peppered with a variety of questions from these inquisitive young minds. In the following scene, we are introduced to angels who, according to the drama’s notes, “look and act like a company of happy Negroes at a fish fry.”1 At this grand fish fry are tables with piles of biscuits, corn bread, and cooked fish in dish pans. Boiled custard and other delicacies abound. The scene is one of plenty in an imaginative and placid world where divine and spiritual realities are taken for granted. This rural “green pastures” of the South is a secure place abuzz with mostly religious activity and where there is plenty of food and laughter. Less than a month before Connelly’s play opened to wide acclaim, black newspapers were busily reporting on a different ver- sion of reality in the rural South. On February 1, 1930, in the small town of Ocilla in South Georgia, news wires provided graphic accounts of the lynching of James Irwin, a black man charged with the rape and murder of a white woman. Irwin was seized from the sher- iff’s custody and tortured by a mob that cut off his fingers and toes and rammed a red-hot poker into his throat before finally burning him to death.2 Eleven recorded lynchings had occurred in the South in 1929, causing some to hope that things were getting better because lynching deaths had been on the decrease throughout the 1920s. But that number doubled to twenty-two in just the first eight months of 1930. The Depression, hard on all Americans, was particularly devas- tating in the rural South. Remote agricultural areas felt the brunt of economic disaster.3 Religion and American Culture: A Journal of Interpretation, Vol. 18, Issue 1, pp. 59–93, ISSN: 1052- 1151; electronic ISSN 1533-8568. © 2008 by The Center for the Study of Religion and American Culture.

Coming on the heels of the upsurge in black literature, arts, and drama in the 1920s, The Green Pastures prompted race debates about images of blacks in the public arena.4 It was a cultural text that joined broader discussions about black migration and the kind of religion that was deemed “good” for the black masses. I argue that the play reflected a longing by white admirers for a simple rural past that was being lost. Through the image of naïve religious blacks, it spoke to the needs of a generation who, in the words of journalist Walter Lippmann, were haunted with the need to believe, to those who wanted to kneel and be comforted at the “shrine of some new god.”5 Yet even as The Green Pastures addressed certain psychological and spiritual needs of whites, it also masked deep fears about the movement of blacks into the urban North. Blacks seemed rather quaint from a distance, but their increasing presence in the urban North posed a serious threat to older religious images of contented southern blacks. Black leaders and interpreters of the play were ambivalent about how to address it. Because of its enormous popularity, it could not be ignored. Yet it was difficult to deny that this was a view of blacks created by a white man precisely at a historical moment when black artists and literary figures were calling upon other blacks to promote and create drama as the best means for a cultural break- through. African American social scientists presented a stinging cri- tique of assertions of a bucolic and serene southern “green pastures” for blacks. Though they were implicitly and sometimes explicitly crit- ical of the kind of religion depicted in The Green Pastures, their very own studies provided unwitting support for Connelly’s play. Overwhelmingly, they denounced and found evidence of other- worldliness, emotionalism, and widespread religiosity among most blacks in the rural South. Even among those African American social scientists who sought indirectly to undermine Connelly’s portrayal of blacks as overly religious and otherworldly, the irony of their own unintended confirmation of many aspects of the play’s portrayal of black religion in the South seems to have been lost on them. But what- ever black leaders personally felt about the play, its popularity and its widespread dissemination of a particular image of blacks as deeply religious and otherworldly ensured that the play became a site for </page> <page sequence="3"> RAC1801_03.qxd  1/16/08  3:25 PM  Page 61 The Religious and Racial Meanings 61 cultural debates about the meaning of black religion and the place of blacks in the nation. Connelly’s play was particularly illuminating in its revelation of whites’ reactions and religious imaginings. Mary Austin, a lecturer in folk drama at Yale University, argued that this was a new field for the dramatist, particularly the use of folklore of black life for dramatic presentations. Austin wrote in March 1930 that it “now begins to look as though we [whites] might have to thank the Negro for mediating our spiritual experience for our own use.”6 What comforted and delighted whites prompted fears and worries for blacks. Black responses were a complex mix of appreciation for an all-black cast and the popularity of one aspect of black religious life in the rural South and a troubling sense that The Green Pastures romanticized black life. For some, the drama rendered an implicit negative judg- ment on the presence of blacks in urban America (and their growing participation in selective facets of a modern industrial nation). In this essay, I examine the social context surrounding The Green Pastures, paying particular attention to its seemingly auspicious opening at a moment when African American leaders were emphasiz- ing the necessity of dramatic works to promote better race relations. After briefly analyzing the content of the play, I explore positive responses of whites to the play. I show that the play had widespread appeal for whites in part because it reinstated “rural values” that many of them had lost in their move to an urban environment. But I also note that the use of naïve and humorous blacks allowed whites imagina- tively to work through and reflect on their own religious and spiritual experiences. By contrasting black responses (which were generally unfavorable) to white responses, I point out how African Americans were troubled by the implication that The Green Pastures portrayed them as primitive and overly religious outsiders in a modern world. In this light, I compare a few similarities between white and black responses to The Green Pastures and Harriet Beecher Stowe’s Uncle Tom’s Cabin to ascertain why the deeply religious black figure has performed such cultural work in these two enormously popular productions. Finally, I show the paradox of African American social scientists implic- itly confirming some of the stereotypical views of rural black southern religion—as otherworldly, emotional, and primitive—even as they sought to adduce economic and social reasons for widespread black religiosity in the South. The ensnaring power of racist discourse, con- cerns about migration and urbanization, and haunting images of blacks as “naturally” religious combined to create contradictory and ambiva- lent responses to Connelly’s play, which served as a site of black and white debates about the meaning of race and religion in the nation. </page> <page sequence="4"> RAC1801_03.qxd  1/16/08  3:25 PM  Page 62 62 Religion and American Culture The Context and Content of The Green Pastures African American intellectuals like James Weldon Johnson, poet and civil rights activist, and W. E. B. Du Bois, a long-time social scientist and civil rights activist, had turned to the arts and literature as strategic paths toward racial advancement and the improvement of race relations. The increasing popularity of blacks on stage, in motion pictures, and in literature heightened hopes that African Americans would develop a more positive image of themselves. Johnson wrote in 1928 that black artists would be the major force in helping to allevi- ate racial prejudice against blacks, which they could do by producing plays, creating literature, and spreading the music of black Americans. He saw these efforts as vital to changing national attitudes toward blacks.7 White admirers tended to laud what they saw as the peculiar qualities of African Americans exhibited in The Green Pastures—lack of vindictiveness, resignation under suffering, a joyful carefree spirit, and a simple innate religiosity—even as leading African Americans insisted that such qualities (whether real or depicted in fiction) had to be changed if blacks were to advance politically and economically. Although the tensions were never resolved, interpreters of black cul- ture such as Harlemites Langston Hughes, poet and writer, and Zora Neale Hurston, anthropologist and folklorist, tried to break away from “race problems” or “race relations” in their writings and dra- matic productions. Hughes and Hurston hoped to write about the laughter, triumphs, and sorrows of blacks apart from how these fea- tures of black culture helped or hindered blacks to confront the prob- lem of race in America. But writing about black culture “on its own terms” was complicated by other black leaders’ fears that a focus on the folkways and religious practices of rural and urban black culture would reinforce stereotypical images of blacks. Potential integration was jeopardized, some believed, if literary and artistic depictions pro- vided evidence of a distinctive black culture.8 This problem of the dis- tinctive nature of black culture was taken up in the 1930s and later by sociologists, but, in the hands of novelists, literary critics, and inter- preters of African American religion in the 1920s, it partially resolved itself into an uneasy combination of criticism of the actual religious institutions and beliefs of African Americans and praise for what were seen as blacks’ gifts and the distinctive aesthetic expression of black folk religion. Literary scholar Henry Louis Gates, Jr., writes that of all the African American arts, “great expectations were held for none more than for black theatre.”9 Black theater represented a quest for </page> <page sequence="5"> RAC1801_03.qxd  1/16/08  3:25 PM  Page 63 The Religious and Racial Meanings 63 “authenticity,” and, among playwrights, it was a matter of who could best represent blacks to the larger public. Black leaders in the New Negro movement desired a national theater where blacks themselves would be responsible for the representation of blacks. Montgomery Gregory, who had been involved in organizing dramas at Howard University and served there as professor of English from 1911 to 1927, expressed the aspirations of some blacks: Our ideal is a national Negro Theater where the Negro play- wright, musician, actor, dancer, and artist in concert shall fashion a drama that will merit the respect and admiration of America. Such an institution must come from the Negro himself, as he alone can truly express the soul of his people. The race must surrender that childish self-consciousness that refuses to face the facts of its own life in the arts but prefers the blandishments of flatterers, who render all efforts at true artistic expression a laughing-stock by adorning their char- acters with the gaudy gowns of cheap romance. However disagreeable the fact may be in some quarters, the only avenue of genuine achievement in American drama for the Negro lies in the development of the rich veins of folk-tradi- tion of the past and in the portrayal of the authentic life of the Negro masses to-day.10 Black leaders had grown weary of what they called polemical and apologetic literature that refused to see the good and bad in the lives of everyday black people. But this new theatrical and literary vision entailed obstacles. There was the shame of a black past haunted by slavery and racial oppression and the deep-seated apprehension of “airing the race’s dirty laundry” before an amused and unsympa- thetic white audience. Nathan Huggins rightly notes that blacks were eager to demonstrate that they were civilized and had made or could make a distinct contribution to American culture. He wrote, “Harlem intellectuals, sharing in that belief [that culture in the form of arts, lit- erature, music, and drama were the true measures of civilization] and seeing themselves as living out the moment of their race’s rebirth, nat- urally marked off their achievement by such artistic production.”11 So great were the stakes, Huggins argues, that black leaders “promoted poetry, prose, painting, and music as if their lives depended on it.”12 Yet this task of representation was no easy one because the “supersti- tions” of the masses and their “uncouth” and “unseemly” behavior, some believed, would bring disgrace to more educated blacks who wanted to prove to whites their fitness and capacity for civilized behavior.13 </page> <page sequence="6"> RAC1801_03.qxd  1/16/08  3:25 PM  Page 64 64 Religion and American Culture Then there was the long tradition of white authors holding blacks up to ridicule in their writings. James Weldon Johnson com- plained of two dominant images of blacks in the imagination of white Americans: the simple, indolent, docile, improvident, and pictur- esque black who smiled and bowed before his lordly white superiors, and the impulsive, irrational, passionate savage who hated whites and threatened civilization. Black authors and those who attempted to represent artistically the black masses, Johnson insisted, had to break out of these “hard-set stereotypes.”14 They had to figure out a way to appeal to both whites and blacks while maintaining the “sin- cerity” and “soundness” of their work. Black authors should fashion something that rose above race, Johnson argued, and that reached out to the universal in truth and beauty. It was a difficult task, he acknowledged, but one worthy of mastering.15 Other black writers and authors, among them Hughes (in his early works) and Claude McKay, a Jamaican-born poet residing in Harlem, took this one step further. Not only did they write about the black masses, the life that they personally knew, but they portrayed blacks as expressive, uninhibited, and spontaneous persons trapped by an urban white world of work, urban asphalt, and sterility. In his famous 1926 essay in the Nation calling on black writers and artists to express their “racial individuality,” Hughes contrasted the “weari- ness in a white world, a world of subway trains and work” to the “eternal tom-tom beating in the Negro soul.” The joy, laughter, and spontaneity of black life were seen as the antidote to or the superior alternative to the sterility of white life (and its “Nordicized Negro” imitations).16 This way of speaking of blacks sounded very much like racial essentialism, but what these black leaders intended to present was what they saw as an honest, unrestricted representation of black life (preferably by blacks themselves). Hughes insisted that he was among the “younger Negro artists” who would create literature that expressed their “individual dark-skinned selves” without fear or shame. They would write about racial themes and issues that derived from the life that they knew. No longer ashamed of those aspects of their culture that made them dif- ferent from whites or that was viewed as unique, they would present to whoever cared, Hughes continued, the ugliness and the beauty of black life. This variety and distinctiveness of black life, he argued, was to be found among the “low-down folks,” the black majority whose behavior was seen as scandalous by blacks concerned about what whites thought of them. Hughes announced that he would write about those who did not “care whether they are like white folks or anybody else.” Spirituals, jazz, dancing, cabarets, “shouting” churches </page> <page sequence="7"> RAC1801_03.qxd  1/16/08  3:25 PM  Page 65 The Religious and Racial Meanings 65 in the urban North, and all facets of Negro life would be material for the artist, Hughes proclaimed.17 Literary, drama, and art critics began noticing a gradual increase in novels and dramatic productions on black life in the 1920s. David Levering Lewis writes that the moment of fusion between two Manhattan bohemias in Harlem and Greenwich Village occurred in the fall of 1917 when the playwright Ridgely Torrence’s three one-act plays with all-black casts were staged. Three years later, Eugene O’Neill’s Emperor Jones appeared, with the African American actor Charles Gilpin starring. Lewis dates these events as the beginning of the “vogue of the Negro in cosmopolitan white America.” White vil- lage bohemians came in droves to Harlem’s nightspots and rent-parties in the 1920s.18 This interest was especially prompted by Carl Van Vechten, novelist, photographer, and drama critic. Van Vechten was a member of Mabel Dodge Luhan’s famous salon at 23 Fifth Avenue in Greenwich Village. Luhan’s salon members had begun meeting in 1912, and their gathering developed into a literary and cultural movement that included such noted writers and artists as Walter Lippmann, Ridgely Torrence, DuBose Heyward, Sinclair Lewis, and H. L. Mencken. Van Vechten was the important figure in Luhan’s salon to establish a link between the Harlem and Greenwich artistic movements.19 In 1924, through his connections with the publisher Alfred Knopf, Van Vechten met Walter White, assistant secretary of the NAACP, whose Fire in the Flint had just been published, and White later arranged a meeting between Van Vechten and James Weldon Johnson. By the end of 1924, Van Vechten claimed to know almost every important black person in Harlem and many who were not so famous. From this time forward, he began a regular habit of inviting blacks to his home and to parties for which he became famous. Van Vechten was fascinated by Harlem’s night clubs and threw himself into every facet of Harlem’s night life. He introduced a number of blacks to publishers and broadened the awareness of black arts and literature to the white public.20 After returning to Harlem from his medical residency at Howard University, African American novelist and physician Rudolf Fisher wrote in 1927 that Harlem, especially its night clubs, was being “stormed” by whites.21 Lewis notes that black leaders were deter- mined to exploit white fascination with black Americans in order to launch their effort at a racial breakthrough.22 Johnson, with evident exasperation, enumerated the various approaches that had been tried to solve the American race problem: religious, educational, political, industrial, ethical, economic, and sociological. He admitted that </page> <page sequence="8"> RAC1801_03.qxd  1/16/08  3:25 PM  Page 66 66 Religion and American Culture “considerable progress” had been made in these areas, but still he believed that a newer approach was now warranted. This newer approach would entail a minimum of pleas, propaganda, and phi- lanthropy. It would depend more, Johnson proclaimed, on what blacks did for themselves. He labeled it the “art approach to the Negro problem.”23 Given the new white interest in black life and blacks’ discov- ery or recovery of their own heritage, the turn to literature and the arts seemed to be the best route to affirm the unique contributions of blacks to American society and to enhance their struggle for economic power and social justice. Despite their desire for racial individuality and racial self-expression, black leaders found themselves dependent on the cultural legitimacy and beneficence of whites, particularly because of the expenses and expertise required in dramatic stage pro- ductions. In 1928, Johnson conceded, for example, that this new method of intellectual and artistic achievements had as its desired effects the amelioration of white attitudes toward blacks and whites’ recognition of blacks as a “great people” because only the production of literature and art determined a people’s greatness. As he noted in an earlier work, “No people that has produced great literature and art has ever been looked upon by the world as distinctly inferior.”24 Johnson was convinced that the folk-art creations of African Americans had done much to change national attitudes toward them. In his view, the production of great literature and art demonstrated the “intellectual parity” of blacks and whites and would raise the sta- tus of blacks while changing the “mental attitudes” of whites. When blacks drew upon their “natural endowments” and gave to America from the store of their “racial genius” such qualities as warmth, color, movement, rhythm, abandon, “depth and swiftness of emotion,” and the “beauty of sensuousness,” Johnson proclaimed, they would smash the stereotype that they were beggars “at the gate of the nation, waiting to be thrown the crumbs of civilization.” He insisted that, through their artistic achievements, African Americans would destroy the common notion that they were to be filled with education, reli- gion, culture, and morality. Instead, Johnson maintained, blacks were helping to shape an entirely new national conception of themselves and were challenging the very core of the “Nordic superiority com- plex” that supported prejudice against them. The new black artists were heralding a new age of race relations, Johnson optimistically asserted.25 In this social context of heightened expectations for black drama, The Green Pastures opened at the Mansfield Theater in New York City on February 26, 1930. No black dramatic productions made </page> <page sequence="9"> RAC1801_03.qxd  1/16/08  3:25 PM  Page 67 The Religious and Racial Meanings 67 by African Americans approached its popularity and fame during the 1920s and 1930s. It ran for a record 640 performances in New York and won Connelly the Pulitzer Prize for the 1929–30 theatrical season. The play was quickly rated a box office success. On March 15, 1935, the musical drama returned to New York after having traveled the country. By that date, it had made its 1,652d appearance in Baltimore, Maryland, and the Green Pastures company had traveled 40,000 miles, played in 203 towns, and appeared in all but eight states.26 Richard B. Harrison, the African American author who played the role of God (“De Lawd”), had become an iconic figure by the time of his death (March 14, 1935). The play was made into a motion picture in 1936, but, by then, its popularity had waned in part because of Harrison’s death and more liberal racial sensibilities.27 While lauded and admired on stage, Harrison and other black actors quickly recognized the limitations of their fame when they traveled to the South. In racially segregated southern cities, the cast lived among blacks in their homes or in segregated hotels and ate their meals at black restaurants. Management had to work out seating arrangements for black and white audiences in southern cities. When the play began its 1932–33 season’s tour to Washington, D. C., even this arrangement of segregated seating broke down. This tour was a two-week engagement at the National Theatre, the principal theater in the city, which prohibited blacks from attending any performance there. Word came to a highly educated and politically active black community that The Green Pastures would play to a white-only audi- ence in Washington, and local daily newspapers announced that tick- ets would be sold only at the box office and no reservations would be accepted by telephone or mail. When the management of the National Theatre announced that it would not change its policy and that blacks would not be permitted to enter the theater, a committee of black min- isters and representatives of the local National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) chapter went to Baltimore, where the play was showing, and petitioned the cast, through Harrison, to refuse to play at the National Theatre unless the theater revoked its policy. Harrison and the cast were taken aback by this request and raised questions about how such a refusal to play would affect their livelihood, their art, and a contract already signed. They said that the show must go on. Black newspapers denounced the policy of the National Theatre. Much dissension ensued, which incited Connelly to write a public letter of protest to the management of the theater. This did little to assuage blacks in Washington, who complained that the city was more segregated than the southernmost cities. Fraternal orders, clergy, educators, and journalists launched a </page> <page sequence="10"> RAC1801_03.qxd  1/16/08  3:25 PM  Page 68 68 Religion and American Culture furious attack on the city’s racist policies, asserting that even Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi allowed segregated seating. At least at these locations, blacks could get into a theater by a rear entrance or sit in a gallery, as humiliating as these arrangements were.28 Eventually, Harrison and the cast came to the National Theatre. Because of threats on his life (apparently by some blacks out- raged at his willingness to appear in the city), he remained under heavy guard for the entire performance in the city. After playing before an all-white audience, Harrison and the cast performed on February 26, 1933 (the third anniversary of the opening of The Green Pastures in New York), at the National Theatre under the auspices of the Improved Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, a black frater- nal order that had among its members some of Washington’s profes- sional men and a number of minor government officials. Reportedly, not many blacks attended this showing of the play. This imbroglio was a striking instance of the real world of race relations in the South over against the idealized “green pastures” presented in the play. This point was repeatedly made by a number of black critics. Although Connelly wrote the play, most drama critics argue that it would hardly have had its success and long run without the involvement of talented African Americans in the cast. For example, The Green Pastures contained a number of spirituals at various inter- ludes, which enhanced its appeal in the eyes of reviewers and audi- ences. Under the leadership of Hall Johnson, a noted black musician and choral conductor, the Hall Johnson Choir sang the spirituals for the drama. Johnson was the official music director of The Green Pastures during its New York run. The play contained two parts deal- ing with events from the Creation to the Flood and the story of Moses to the Crucifixion, all written in the idiom of blacks in rural Louisiana (outside of New Orleans). This is how Connelly described the play: The Green Pastures is an attempt to present certain aspects of a living religion in terms of its believers. The religion is that of thousands of Negroes in the deep South. With terrific spiritual hunger and the greatest humility these untutored black Christians—many of whom cannot even read the book which is the treasure house of their faith—have adapted the contents of the Bible to the consistencies of their everyday lives. Unburdened by the differences of more educated the- ologians they accept the Old Testament as a chronicle of wonders which happened to people like themselves in vague but actual places.29 Connelly wanted to make a comedy in line with Roark Bradford’s depiction of southern blacks in Ol’ Man Adam an’ His Chillun (1928), a </page> <page sequence="11"> RAC1801_03.qxd  1/16/08  3:25 PM  Page 69 The Religious and Racial Meanings 69 retelling of some of the stories of the Old Testament in black southern dialect (Bradford was a white journalist living in New Orleans). In explaining his own interest in this religious topic, Connelly wrote, “I am not a religionist. To me, any creed that has lasted more than five hundred years has some merit in it somewhere, but I have never been able to accept insistences by hierarchies or sectarian policing. As an agnostic, I recognized that I must at all times respect the faith of the black fundamentalists.”30 Writing the play was Connelly’s way of interpreting the “search of God for man, and man’s search for God.”31 Within that skeletal outline, the play could proceed without denigrat- ing the beliefs of religious persons in general, black Christians in par- ticular. Connelly used the distinctive experiences of one group to speak to a more general audience. After reading Bradford’s book, Connelly made two separate trips to New Orleans to study black spir- ituals and to visit a few black churches. Bradford accompanied him to many of the black churches that he visited. Late in 1928, Connelly signed a contract with Harper and Brothers’ publishers, which assigned him the right to make a play from Bradford’s book in return for which Bradford would receive 30 percent of the royalties.32 Connelly adapted the story of the ancient Israelites to the experience of blacks in the rural South. His audiences encountered “mammy angels,” God and cherubim smoking cigars, a grand fish fry, southern juke joints and dance halls, and all the varied colloqui- alisms of the rural South. Viewers saw God “walkin’ de earth in de shape of a natchel man.” Anthropomorphic and humorous, God stumbles into situations, experiences surprises, and, by the end of the play, even God’s understanding of humanity has been broadened. God’s frustration with humans culminates in his destroying the earth by a great flood. At one point, in exasperation, God says, “Man is a kind of pet of mine and it ain’t right fo’ me to give up tryin’ to do somethin’ wid him. Doggone, mankin’ mus’ be all right at de core or else why did I ever bother wid him in de first place?”33 After restor- ing the earth, God decides to bless the patriarchs and their descen- dants (for the most part, Connelly stuck closely to the biblical storyline, except for the comedic aspects of the play). Ultimately, God learns from humans as the drama proceeds. Toward the end of the play, God declares that only through suffering is mercy known, and he exclaims to the archangel Garbriel, “Even bein’ Gawd ain’t a bed of roses.”34 Through his experience with humans, God is trans- formed from a god of wrath to a god of mercy and longsuffering. It is God who ultimately changes, but humans are presumably all right, except that they need a little mercy and understanding from time to time. </page> <page sequence="12"> RAC1801_03.qxd  1/16/08  3:25 PM  Page 70 70 Religion and American Culture What in Connelly’s background explains his interest in the subject matter of the play? Marc Connelly was born in 1890 in McKeesport, Pennsylvania. By 1907, he had drifted to Pittsburgh and worked for a number of years as a reporter and drama critic for Pittsburgh newspapers. In 1915, Connelly went to New York and pro- duced his first play. Between 1916 and 1920, he supported himself by writing lyrics for an ultimately unsuccessful musical and composing verse for a popular comic weekly.35 Throughout the 1920s, he contin- ued to write plays and musicals and was named to the editorial board of the New Yorker in 1925. Thus, prior to his reading of Bradford’s book in 1928 and his writing of the script for The Green Pastures in 1929, Connelly had quite extensive experience in making dramas and musicals, though there is no evidence of his acquaintance with or interest in black life up to this point. According to Paul Nolan, his biographer, Connelly spent “considerable time in Louisiana” researching the subject matter for Green Pastures.36 Connelly related the story of Roark Bradford taking him to black churches in New Orleans, where he reportedly met a “dozen Mr. Deshees” (the Sunday school teacher who opens the drama). He received a call at his New Orleans hotel at two in the morning and was ushered by two police detectives to visit black “barrelhouse” dives. Returning three hours later, Connelly noted the puzzled look on the night clerk’s face. He also visited the “Big House” outside Baton Rouge, a crumbling manor built in the 1830s. Connelly cast himself in the role of Scottish poet Robert Burns’s habit of reading his poems in dialect to peasants for criticisms of their authenticity. At the Big House, he found several black servants with whom he could test the black dialogue that he had written. When venturing forth among black field hands, Connelly said that his black dialect “provoked some heartening, favorable reactions.” Not satisfied with his written black dialogue after the script was finished, Connelly made a second trip to the South and talked with “a score of unlettered” blacks. He noted that, if any word or phrase sounded strange to his listeners, he rewrote it. The final script was completed in New York.37 Connelly modestly explained the play’s progress by pointing to the audiences’ responses and his attempt at actual representation of black folk life in the rural South. He wrote, “Audiences were so gen- erous to that play, you know. You have to have an audience surrender— and that apparently is the play that has a greater persuasion to surrender than any other that I ever had a hand in.”38 Connelly regard- ed his play as a “representation” of reality, not something encumbered with abstractions, which is consistent with his view of Western theater as representation.39 He stated that his mother felt that critics finally </page> <page sequence="13"> RAC1801_03.qxd  1/16/08  3:25 PM  Page 71 The Religious and Racial Meanings 71 got what he was trying to do.40 In the author’s note introducing the play, Connelly indicated that the apocryphal additions to the story reflected the actual “meditations of some of the old Negro preachers, whose simple faith” he tried to translate into a play.41 So for Connelly, The Green Pastures was a depiction of actual black religious practices in the rural South and a realistic view of their religious imaginings and fantasies. Mediating the Spiritual Experience of Whites White responses to the play were overwhelmingly positive. They were thrilled by this vivid portrayal of the simplicity and sin- cerity of black faith and the attractive character of God (De Lawd). J. Brooks Atkinson, writing for the New York Times, called it a play of “surpassing” and “sublime” beauty. The “great emotional depth ”of the play complemented the “utter simplicity in religious conception” of the “ignorant religious negroes of the South.” De Lawd allowed one to believe in him implicitly. The play itself, Atkinson proclaimed, was “belief incarnated.”42 Louis Azrael of the New York Telegram felt that the drama “teaches that man’s suffering is not God’s punishment for man’s evil.”43 White critics were also prompted by their reactions to the play to reflect on the state of religion in the modern world. William Bolitho of the New York World journal believed that the simple reli- gious faith of the Negro depicted in The Green Pastures could redeem the Bible from “all the subtly limited rationalisms which all the Protestantisms have put into it.” Blacks possessed the “purest form of Fundamentalism.” Connelly’s expression of Christian fundamental- ism in Negro form was far more appealing than the likes of William Jennings Bryan to Bolitho’s way of thinking. Bryan could never con- vey “the touching poetry, the ingenuous conjuring away of logical difficulties, [and] the secret charm” of the “Fundamentalist vision of the universe” in the way that Connelly had done so masterfully. Bolitho wrote that, in the end, religion in the play was shown to be more than rational argument and disputations: Men may fight for their religion with arguments on their lips, but in their hearts the hidden motive is always tinseled candles they saw on the altar when they were children, the light stained glass throws on Sunday mornings, the frock coat and white tie and the old benevolent face once attributed to God. So Mr. Connelly—what is art but supernatural?—has here explained not only the Negro heart but the kernel of the Fundamentalist position, their vision of the universe. This, </page> <page sequence="14"> RAC1801_03.qxd  1/16/08  3:25 PM  Page 72 72 Religion and American Culture O [H. L.] Mencken, is what the Bible belt is trying to say: however unpleasantly they fight, they are defending a Christmas tree.44 Bolitho was critical of Marxists who argued that religion diverted attention from the problems of this world to focus on the next, and presumably better, world. He wondered, “What would this poor people [African Americans], the victim of the strangest and most terrifying fate that has ever, perhaps, befallen a race, what would they have done without the consolation of the Christian religion?” Religion is a “wine,” not an opiate, Bolitho contended, useful and nec- essary for the masses. It was fine for people to have the comforts of religion, and the modern state should regulate organized religion in such a way that religion does not become too powerful in the realm of politics. But it was cruel, tyrannical, and “probably impossible,” Bolitho proclaimed, to deprive poor people of their religion as the Russian Marxists were attempting to do. Of all people, the poor need- ed the “irrational comfort” provided by religion, and it was silly to think that they would behave like “little philosophers.” Perhaps, Bolitho wondered, Marxists were wrong if Connelly’s play was right when it dramatized that religion had indeed sustained an oppressed people like black Americans.45 Literary critic Joseph Wood Krutch’s response to the drama illustrates how the play could be used to address current religious problems. Historian William R. Hutchison argues that Krutch and the journalist Walter Lippmann were among the principal critics of reli- gious liberalism in the late 1920s.46 Krutch’s Modern Temper (1929) and Lippmann’s Preface to Morals (1929) were two signal texts that somberly pronounced the death of traditional religious beliefs and the depth of skepticism that had entered the souls of modern intellec- tuals. In his work, Krutch argued that human illusions had been “lost one by one” in the decade after World War I. “God, instead of disap- pearing in an instant,” Krutch claimed, “has retreated step by step and surrendered gradually his control of the universe.”47 A yearning for the lost anthropomorphic God who was created in humanity’s image and so who understood human desires haunted Krutch’s work. He gloomily noted that the world of religion, myth, and poetry, which represented the world “as man would like to have it,” was in conflict with science. Modern man gave up his belief in the notion of a “cozy bowl of the sky arched in a protecting curve above him” in exchange for “the cold immensities of space.” Krutch continued, “God he loved because God was anthropomorphic, because He was made in man’s image, with purposes and desires which were human and hence understandable” (emphasis his).48 But now, like adults </page> <page sequence="15"> RAC1801_03.qxd  1/16/08  3:25 PM  Page 73 The Religious and Racial Meanings 73 rudely awakened from childish dreams, modern humans had to con- front the cold fact that nature had no purpose and life had no intrin- sic meaning. The myth and poetry of the child’s world were lost to modern man.49 Though the intellect could rejoice at the findings of modern science, the emotions could not comprehend this world, and the spirit, “frightened and cold, longs to have once more above its head the inverted bowl beyond which may lie whatever paradise its desires may create.”50 Krutch confessed that he found his emotions deeply stirred by De Lawd’s character in The Green Pastures, which moved him at a level that he found hard to explain in view of his modernist senti- ments. The Negro’s “version of mythology is the only one now living enough to touch us,” Krutch maintained. Unlike “sophisticated reli- gions” (by which he meant liberal Protestantism), this Negro drama dealt intimately with what it professed to believe. Modern religion was “merely the result of skepticism unwilling to confess that it is forced to doubt anything which it allows itself definitely to conceive.” But this remarkable drama was true art because it had faith enough to embody itself in concrete images. It aroused “enthusiasm” and enabled modern audiences to feel the “religious emotions.” Indeed, Krutch implied, Negro mythology was the last thing left that would call forth the religious emotions since there was certainly no way moderns were capable of generating them for themselves.51 Bolitho’s and Krutch’s evaluations of the play demonstrate the ambivalent response of modernists to fundamentalist religion. During the height of the 1920s fundamentalist-modernist controversy, when journalists pitted enlightened, mostly urban modernists against rural and biased southern fundamentalists, older literal interpreta- tions of the Genesis narrative were regarded as unscientific and, therefore, discredited in the eyes of intellectuals and modernists.52 Yet here was Connelly’s play, which dealt with the “central religious- philosophical myth of Western civilization, the Hebrew-Christian accounts in the Bible,” though reworked through his understanding of black folk culture in the rural South, evoking a positive response from professed modernists.53 Why was this? Perhaps because this was a play and could be evaluated artistically as such. An aesthetic treatment of mostly disenfranchised blacks could hardly be taken as a cultural or political threat in the same way as numerous white southerners clamoring for the truthfulness and dissemination of their particular understanding of the Bible and science in public schools. Perhaps more important, Lippmann’s treatment of funda- mentalism indicates that modernists genuinely longed for what they perceived had been lost in the abandonment of religious belief by </page> <page sequence="16"> RAC1801_03.qxd  1/16/08  3:25 PM  Page 74 74 Religion and American Culture their contemporaries. Lippmann’s Preface to Morals, while seeking to advance a common morality without the foundations of supernatu- ral beliefs and traditional Christianity, expressed a deep sense of loss over the rejection of traditional Christian doctrines. Lippmann commended the ancient faith precisely because it confidently told a story and narrated an event that was believed to be true and histor- ical. He argued that, for most persons, “religious experience depends upon a complete belief in the concrete experience, one might almost say the materialization, of their God.”54 This point was made by Bolitho and Krutch who argued that liberal Protestantism had deprived of its historicity the old story of a god coming to earth and thereby robbed its poetry and symbolism of any significance. Lippmann’s critique of liberal Protestantism’s reinterpretation of traditional Christianity was quite similar to Krutch’s uncomplimen- tary remarks about its skepticism of the concreteness of a deity and Bolitho’s assertion of the failure of various Protestant churches’ “subtly limited rationalisms” to explain away to modern minds dif- ficult parts of Scripture.55 Whether or not they were accurate or fair in their negative judgments of liberal Protestantism, each of these men seemed to agree that Connelly was on to something in his depiction of De Lawd as an incarnate black god walking the earth. The Green Pastures allowed white modernists to mediate and reflect on their own spiritual experience in part because it presented a fun- damentalist worldview in a nonthreatening and comedic fashion. They also used the play to express their dissatisfaction with liberal Protestantism’s revising of traditional Christianity. They commented rarely, however, on the unfairness of comparing an earnest reinter- pretation of religion as belief and practice to a play that, at best, stirred “religious emotions” for the time audiences paid to be enter- tained and allowed themselves to experience belief and fantasy vic- ariously simply to escape their present unpleasant circumstances. However, Connelly was apparently able to move these modernists with his play because he was in touch with their sense of loss and dissatisfaction. Some saw an implicit rural and urban dichotomy in the play, with a denigration of the latter. Paula J. Massood argues that, in “its dichotomy between heaven and earth, The Green Pastures suggests that rural southern space is a paradise in comparison to the city.”56 Did white reactions to the play then reflect unconscious racist desires to keep southern blacks in their place, as some critics have suggested?57 Perhaps, but the responses to the play of those whites who were seri- ously interested in urban work among blacks complicates any simple analysis. </page> <page sequence="17"> RAC1801_03.qxd  1/16/08  3:25 PM  Page 75 The Religious and Racial Meanings 75 Mary Ovington, for example, had proven her devotion to black causes as one of the founding members of the NAACP, by help- ing with the work of the National Urban League, and by befriending Du Bois and a number of other black leaders concerned with urban and racial reform. When asked to explain, in the early 1930s, why she became interested in “taking up the Negro’s cause,” Ovington wrote a series of articles for the Baltimore Afro-American, a black newspaper, in 1932 and 1933. Ovington was a socialist, and so her remarks on this explicitly religious play are particularly revealing. She felt that the play had made more “converts than any evangelist who has been preaching since the play began.” Though there was “much contro- versy” concerning the play among blacks, Ovington noted, there was “none among whites.”58 She confessed that every time she talked with blacks about the play, the discussion became so heated that she was forced to drop the subject. Instead, Ovington presented her reminis- cences as the final word in her ongoing attempt to commend the play to blacks.59 Ovington was puzzled by constant complaints among blacks about the play’s folk character, especially its image of heavenly pic- nics and fish fries. Blacks could not appreciate the audience’s laugh- ter at such apparently funny scenes, she fretted, because they feared that surely these admiring whites were laughing at blacks doing silly things. Blacks always asked, “Why do they always show the ignorant Negro? Why can’t they show us at our best?” But Ovington was con- vinced that the play was successful precisely because it depicted blacks who, humble enough, belonged to a social sphere that was “deep-rooted,” whereas the “educated Negro of today has been uprooted and has rarely achieved a culture comparable artistically to the old.” By “heroically trying to keep up with the procession” of modern life in the city, blacks were simply not impressive figures. Ovington elaborated: The son of a Maine fisherman comes to New York, buys a Hart, Schaffner, and Marx suit of clothes, gets a job in a shop, and feels that these city folk ought to know how he had advanced over his forebears. But does the artist notice him? Not at all, unless it be to make fun of him. Instead, he goes down to Maine, finds the father, who, in his oilskins, has come back from a morning’s catch, hears salty talk and sto- ries of adventure and hardships as old as the sea itself. Here is reality, a culture that is secure.60 Black city folk, Ovington wrote, simply did not possess a secure cul- ture as the blacks depicted in The Green Pastures from whom Connelly </page> <page sequence="18"> RAC1801_03.qxd  1/16/08  3:25 PM  Page 76 76 Religion and American Culture gave audiences “something secure, deep-rooted, imaginative as the heart of a child.”61 So for Ovington and other white critics who lauded the play, it revealed something deeply rooted in black culture, and it contained an “evangelistic” message for white Americans.  The New York Times reported in 1934 that The Green Pastures had toured every southern state, except Mississippi because of its lack of a “suitable theater.”62 An editorial writer for South Carolina’s Columbia Record wrote that the play proved that there were “normal” people in New York City. He hoped that the play would produce “as many real conversions to Christianity” as religious revivals did.63 A writer for the Augusta Herald raved that it was an “altogether delight- ful play.”64 Some white southern critics, however, expressed concern about the lines attributed to God in the play. They considered it a sac- rilege to have God walking around on earth, smoking and handing out ten-cent cigars, and complaining because he did not have enough “firmament” in his custard. These commentators also disliked the portrayal of God speaking in southern black dialect and succumbing to frequent “grammatical lapses.” William M. Groom, the pastor of Ross Avenue Baptist Church in Dallas, Texas, said The Green Pastures was “one of the most blasphemous and sacrilegious things ever placed before the public and shamefully caricatures the Lord Almighty, the angels, and the patriarchs.” Groom called upon his con- gregation and the public to demand that this “outrageous” insult against the revealed Word of God “be immediately discontinued.”65 In general, however, it appears that most white southerners who watched the play enjoyed it and strongly warmed to its religious mes- sage. Remarks about their unique understanding of the “antebellum Negro’s conception of God” indicated that white southerners still held deep attachments to the plantation depictions of happy and con- tented blacks.66 Clowning the Black Man’s Spiritual Pose Black critics debated the play’s artistic merits and its impact on broader depictions and images of African Americans, though many were happy to see an all-black cast employed. Differences emerged particularly about the nature of the play, whether it was a sacrilegious portrayal of God or a caricature of heaven, and about how blacks were depicted religiously. W. E. B. Du Bois labeled The Green Pastures an “extraordinarily appealing and beautiful play based on the folk religion of Negroes,” but he predicted that blacks would not like the play because of its representation of God in a frock coat and its depiction of heaven as a fish fry.67 Mary Burrill, an “educated </page> <page sequence="19"> RAC1801_03.qxd  1/16/08  3:25 PM  Page 77 The Religious and Racial Meanings 77 woman of Negro birth,” in a letter to the Nation asserted that the play was not a Negro version of Christian mythology. Blacks did not think of God as black, she maintained (a point also made by some white southern critics), but as “an anemic WHITE gentleman with a golden beard, wearing a long nightshirt with bishop-sleeves” (emphasis hers).68 Burrill wrote that the situation of blacks in the South prevented them from conceiving of God as black. In her words, the “reason for such a conception on the part of the Negro is simple enough. Has he not spent his life in a country where to be black is despised? Is it therefore likely that he will want to take such a handicap with him to heaven?” Blacks did not interpret the afterlife in terms of their pres- ent experience, Burrill wrote. She called upon critics of the drama to appraise it as “a white man’s conception of the Negro’s conception of religion and heaven.”69 An Oklahoma Black Dispatch editorial opened with the simple question reportedly asked by a “young white girl” at a public talk at the local Pilgrim Congregational Church: “Is Green Pastures really a genuine expression of the Negro’s religion?” “No,” the editor replied, “Green Pastures does not reflect properly the black man’s religion. Green Pastures was written by perverse white people who sought to clown the black man’s spiritual pose.” The editor related the young girl’s relief at this response and how she indicated that “Green Pastures distressed me, and I was loath to believe that any people, and espe- cially colored people, could have any such twisted, distorted outlook at the universe and God.” This young lady, the editor assured his readers, provided “ample justification for the assault that we have continuously made against” the play’s presentation. He went on, “Here we find a liberal-minded white girl hoping against hope that black people are not like she had seen them falsely presented to her on the American stage.” The editor could scarcely conceal his rage when he uttered, “No more cruel stab has ever been thrust at the black man in America than is exposed in the derisive, contemptuous and ridiculous complex attributed to him in this ignoble, defaming play.”70 The editorial writer was puzzled that the “Negro intelli- gentsia” could not see the harm done by the play. He was deeply dis- appointed that in his native Oklahoma City eleven hundred blacks “hurried from all over Oklahoma” paying high prices for seats “to look at a drama which in its fundamentals cuts the heart and human- ity out of black folk.” He conjectured that perhaps they had been duped by the “sugar-coating” of fine music and beautiful scenery, which made the play all the more dangerous in his view. Because so few black leaders could see the perniciousness of the play, the editor vowed that he would renew his efforts to reveal its true nature. He </page> <page sequence="20"> RAC1801_03.qxd  1/16/08  3:25 PM  Page 78 78 Religion and American Culture argued that, just as he had fought against the The Birth of a Nation (1915), a very popular silent movie that lauded the Ku Klux Klan’s actions during the Reconstruction years (among other things), he would fight against The Green Pastures. The editor believed The Green Pastures was more dangerous because, unlike The Birth of a Nation, which “did damage to white people” because of its explicitly racist images, it struck at the “probity, integrity, mental poise, and morality of black folk.” “When you remove such attitudes from a man,” the editor concluded, “you have destroyed the man.”71 The editor still believed at this late date in the play’s run (1934) that it remained a threat to blacks and that he could do something to counter its images of blacks. His comments did indicate, however, the enormous issues that were at stake from the perspective of black leaders like himself. The black Harlem journalist and satirist George Schuyler was also a vocal critic of the play, offering his views even before he saw it. Schuyler believed that The Green Pastures reinforced white stereotypes of the Negro “as a child of nature unfortunately stranded in the midst of white civilization.” He dismissed black critics who thought the play was superior; he claimed that such blacks unthinkingly applauded anything that white intellectuals and critics praised. Schuyler was also skeptical of whites who lauded the play. He was persuaded that, if whites had been the central characters in the play, it would hardly have been so lavishly praised. Schuyler asserted that the play comforted and flattered whites precisely because it appealed to their stereotypical notions of blacks. Denying that the play accu- rately represented the southern rural Negro’s conception of heaven, Schuyler appealed to the authority of Zora Neale Hurston, the famous black anthropologist and folklorist, who had collected black folk tales in the South from 1927 to 1930. He quoted Hurston as say- ing that the play was the “white man’s idea of heaven palmed off to perpetuate the belief that the Negro’s status, even in eternity, will be that of a menial.” For this reason, Schuyler concluded that he could not agree with those who believed that plays like The Green Pastures did blacks a lot of good. He intimated that such productions hindered blacks from demanding their rights and reinforced the harmful images of blacks already prevalent among whites.72 Zora Neale Hurston’s most recent biographer, Valerie Boyd, argues that Hurston was prompted by the success of The Green Pastures to sense possibilities for herself as a playwright. The play rekindled her long-standing interest in the theater. Hurston never published a formal response to the play, but she wrote an unpub- lished article, in 1934, in which she praised Harrison as a “great actor” and commended Connelly for his skills as a dramatist. She argued </page> <page sequence="21"> RAC1801_03.qxd  1/16/08  3:25 PM  Page 79 The Religious and Racial Meanings 79 that the play reflected very little about black religion or folk life. “The Negro’s idea of heaven,” Hurston wrote, “is certainly not dusting out a plantation boss’s office with aprons on their wings. Nothing like work and bossy white folks in our heavenly concept.”73 She had often complained that white authors of black dramas “squeezed all Negro- ness out of everything.”74 The central concern for Hurston and other black leaders was who could more accurately or authentically repre- sent African Americans. Representations of black life on stage and elsewhere were inextricably tied up with the problems of racism and traditional stereotypical images of blacks. Here again, in their response to The Green Pastures, blacks struggled to control the discourse of race and representation after whites had already succeeded in this arena. The Return of Uncle Tom? In his book on the Harlem Renaissance, Nathan Huggins briefly discusses The Green Pastures at the end of his analysis of minstrelsy and the struggle of blacks to find a niche as legitimate actors in the theater. He argues that The Green Pastures “for a moment” was able to make “faith possible and vicariously experienced.” Huggins notes that doubt “seemed impossible in the black child’s fantasy” and that the play allowed whites to come to terms with their own guilt over the loss of belief in the decade after the First World War. The character of De Lawd, in his view, was a “transmuted Uncle Tom.” Comparisons with Harriet Beecher Stowe’s Uncle Tom’s Cabin readily come to some crit- ics’ minds. In a discussion of the popularity of The Green Pastures, a 1931 issue of the New York Times noted the “Last Days for ‘Uncle Tom’” as a play, which was supposedly giving way to modernity (which meant that motion pictures were making dramas obsolete).75 Uncle Tom’s Cabin and The Green Pastures sometimes elicited similar kinds of responses from both black and white critics. The authors used their subject matter to counter certain religious images with which they disagreed. For example, when Stowe expressed her disappointment with a stifling and abstract Calvinistic theological system and a developing critical approach to Scripture, she contrasted unbelieving or doubting white characters to Uncle Tom for whom religion was “evidently so true and divine that the possibility of a question never entered his simple mind.”76 Uncle Tom had something to teach whites about Christianity. Stowe’s comment is similar to Connelly’s description (mentioned above) of The Green Pastures as the musings of black believers “unburdened” by the speculations of more educated white theologians who struggled to interpret the Bible for their time. Similarly, when the white journalist and socialist Heywood </page> <page sequence="22"> RAC1801_03.qxd  1/16/08  3:25 PM  Page 80 80 Religion and American Culture Broun reflected on Connelly’s play, he noted that some felt that it advocated a form of slave religion. Broun maintained that, if he were a black preacher accused of practicing a slave religion, he would “accept this reproach and wear it as plume.” After all, he asked, who among us has “broken every fetter of mortality?” For Broun, blacks had redeemed Christianity and restored to it those qualities that were lacking. Black folk exemplified a form of Christian faith that was not evident among whites. Connelly’s drama reminded its audience that Christianity had in it, Broun averred, a “ferment of immediacy,” and that eager anticipation for another world was a central part of its ethos. Untutored blacks in the South also longed for deliverance from present bondage, as expressed in their conceptions of heaven. The play for Broun dramatized the most fundamental conflict of the human soul; it told of the ultimate triumph of mercy over hatred. The Negro alone of all oppressed peoples did not allow bitterness to take root in his soul. Thus the Negro “has played a vital part in bringing back to current Christianity its kindliness.”77 Modernists like Broun and Bolitho were using the drama to defend black religion in the rural South against the criticisms of com- munists and other political radicals within and outside the black com- munity who felt that religion was an opiate that deadened the painful reality of black economic and racial oppression in America. Reflections on The Green Pastures’ conception of God and its depiction of black religiosity led some to defend them in a way that is reminis- cent of Stowe’s defense of her portrayal of Uncle Tom’s religiosity from the criticisms of the radical abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison. An article in Maine’s Lewiston Journal expressed powerfully this con- cern about the effects of modernity and political radicalism on blacks just as Stowe worried about the potential harm of Garrison’s religious and social radicalism on black slaves. The author feared that the eco- nomic plight of blacks during the Great Depression was making blacks more open to “proselytizing anarchy.” Such forces, in other words, could take away blacks’ faith. In reflecting on the positive effect of Connelly’s play, in contrast to the efforts of radical political groups to recruit blacks, the author concluded: “Naturally of fervent religious emotion, he [the Negro] may perhaps be turned as emotion- ally against religion—such is the boring-in effect of Communism. If the Negro is ever convinced that Heaven is a joke—as Communism preaches—and that work is demanded of him here on the false prem- ise that he can loaf over there, there may be a real world-movement. Much depends on the Negro’s conception of God.”78 Unlike this author, however, Garrison was worried about the effect of a passive “slave religion” on blacks, and he queried Stowe as </page> <page sequence="23"> RAC1801_03.qxd  1/16/08  3:25 PM  Page 81 The Religious and Racial Meanings 81 to whether or not she was espousing Christian nonresistance only for blacks. He asked if there were two Christs, one who authorized whites to overthrow tyranny by violence and bloodshed, and another Christ who required that blacks be patient, harmless, long-suffering, and forgiving. Garrison expressed little sympathy for Stowe’s fear that his radicalism would “take from poor Uncle Tom his Bible, and give him nothing in its place.” As he wrote to Stowe, “If the infernal cruelty of [Simon] Legree [Tom’s white master] could not shake his trust in his God and Saviour, do you really think a full discussion of the merits of the Bible, pro and con, might induce him to throw that volume away?” Yet Garrison’s perspective on the Bible reminded Stowe too much of the Cicero (as representative of whites) whose head was filled with troubling questions that unsettled faith. Unlike Tom’s faith, Garrison’s approach to the Bible demanded that “neither of us accept any more of it than we sincerely believe to be in accor- dance with reason, truth, [and] eternal right.”79 Defenders of The Green Pastures preferred a suffering God or an Uncle Tom figure for whom deep religiosity was a defining feature and one who eschewed political radicalism for long-suffering and hope in a distant future or a heavenly world-to-come. When George Schuyler chided Connelly for creating a black child of nature stranded in the midst of an urban environment, he reminds us of the black nationalist Martin Delany’s angry complaint that Stowe, while ably depicting the suffering of black slaves, had lit- tle sympathy for free blacks in the North.80 His concern was a variant of the implicit question some black critics posed to Connelly: what about blacks in the urban North who were now struggling with the problems of modernity and who could no longer live in a world where belief was taken for granted? Was the heroic or romanticized depiction of blacks in the rural South necessarily a negative assess- ment of black migration to and prospects in the urban North? Was it a call for blacks to cease their quest for political and civil rights and, therefore, remain wedded to a religious past that required resigna- tion, suffering, and patience? Black critics insisted that Connelly’s play invited such questions, but their own responses provided no direct and easy answers for most blacks. Historical and Social Scientific Studies of Black  Southern Rural Religion The migration of rural southern blacks to the urban South and North in the first three decades of the twentieth century was crucial to contemporary discussions about black religion. It is estimated that, </page> <page sequence="24"> RAC1801_03.qxd  1/16/08  3:25 PM  Page 82 82 Religion and American Culture between 1915 and 1920, from 500,000 to one million African Americans left the rural South for the urban North. From 1920 to about 1930, another 700,000 to one million blacks moved to the North and West. Even so, as late as 1940, only 23 percent of blacks in the United States were living in the mostly urban North and West. Yet these numbers continued to increase dramatically between 1940 and 1960, transform- ing the lives of millions of black Americans.81 Fears of social interac- tion between blacks and whites, white northerners’ perceptions of being overrun by “Negro hordes” in urban neighborhoods, and fan- tasies of an ideal rural South uniquely suited for Africans Americans were some of the social effects of this transformation. Carter G. Woodson and Benjamin Mays (and Mays’s co- author, Joseph Nicholson) deserve special mention because their detailed studies of blacks in the rural South contrasted sharply with the representation of rural black southern religion in The Green Pastures. Mays and Nicholson, and Woodson, had spent far more time, expended more effort, and used more professional methods to study the religious beliefs and practices of rural black southerners than did Connelly.82 Yet it is certain that neither of their works had the widespread influence (among white audiences) of Connelly’s play. Woodson, a major figure in the development of “black history,” com- menced his study of rural southern black communities in 1926 and completed the project in 1929. His study was published in April 1930 as The Rural Negro. Hurston was among those who helped collect data for this endeavor. Mays and Nicholson based their study on a first- hand analysis of 609 urban and 185 rural black churches, distributed over twelve cities and four counties (in the North and South). It took about fourteen months to complete the field work and the collecting of data and ten months to prepare the material for publication. The Negro’s Church was published in 1933 under the auspices of the Institute of Social and Religious Research in New York. Mays also published the Negro’s God in 1938, which dealt more extensively with black conceptions of God and was, in part, a response to works like Green Pastures.83 The problem of otherworldliness and the way forward to a more socially active church were crucial to the works of May and Nicholson and Woodson. What troubled these critics was “other- worldliness,” which represented to them a pre-industrial, pre- modern worldview that adhered to a literal interpretation of the Bible and manifested scant concern for economic and social reform (at least as these critics envisioned it). Overchurching, which meant for critics that there were too many black churches in one area, an untrained and often absentee leadership in the ministry, emotional worship, </page> <page sequence="25"> RAC1801_03.qxd  1/16/08  3:25 PM  Page 83 The Religious and Racial Meanings 83 lack of a program for rural education, failure to focus on the specific needs of youth, and insufficient attention to economic and social problems because of an outdated, otherworldly approach to religion were the most commonly cited weaknesses of the rural black churches. Invariably contrasting the rural churches to urban churches, Woodson argued that, though the “urban church has become a sort of uplift agency; the rural church has become a mystic shrine. While the urban church is often trying to make this a better world in which to live, the rural church is engaged in immediate preparation for the ‘beautiful land of by and by.’”84 Church members in rural churches exhibited “paroxysms which could hardly be expected outside of an insane asy- lum,” Woodson complained. With pictures of blacks being lynched and burned alive scattered through his book, he had little sympathy for a romantic notion of the rural South filled with “green pas- tures.” Woodson placed his hope in outside help for the rural southern churches and in the work of those in urban areas of the South and North.85 Benjamin Mays was an ordained Baptist minister and had served as the national student secretary of the YMCA from 1928 to 1930. At the time of the publication of Negro’s Church, Mays was work- ing on his doctorate at the University of Chicago. The co-author of this work, Joseph William Nicholson, was a Colored Methodist Episcopal (CME) minister who had received his doctorate in religion from Northwestern University in 1932. Nicholson was also the pastor at the Jubilee Temple, a CME church in Chicago, until 1936. W. Clark Gilpin argues that Mays’s theology was a significant variant of the liberal Protestant contrast between traditional religion and modernist “social spirituality.” This social spirituality, Gilpin contends, was viewed as a necessary organization of “Christian forces into effective- ness” because Christianity, in the assessment of social gospel advo- cates, had passed from a dogmatic to a sociological conception of the content of religion. In many ways, the otherworldly “compensatory” religion among rural southern blacks represented for black leaders like Mays what fundamentalism represented for white liberal Protestants. For Mays and Nicholson, the church now had to become more efficient and practically engaged in concrete issues.86 Mays had studied with Shailer Mathews at the University of Chicago, and he was deeply influenced by the Social Gospel empha- sis on the social nature of religion.87 Mays’s challenge, and that of other black church leaders informed by the Social Gospel movement, was to make Christian ideas efficient tools of social reform. Gilpin and Milton Sernett note that these ideas developed from an instru- mentalist conception of the church, which regarded the church as an </page> <page sequence="26"> RAC1801_03.qxd  1/16/08  3:25 PM  Page 84 84 Religion and American Culture instrument for bringing about social and political changes in the broader society.88 Although Mays and Nicholson listed the standard litany of rural church problems, Mays was particularly troubled by the problem of “innate religiosity” and otherworldliness (a concern manifested especially in his Negro’s God). Mays was concerned about depictions of black religion as conveyed in The Green Pastures. He felt that the play perpetuated the notion of the “super-religious” Negro. Mays sought to demonstrate that the “Negro’s ideas of God grow out of the social situation in which he finds himself” and not from a prim- itive or innate religiosity.89 Mays and Nicholson defined an otherworldly sermon as “one that is concerned so predominantly with the hereafter that the practi- cal aspects of life on earth are secondary or submerged, or one in which fear or reward, not in this life but in the world to come, is the dominant note.” Such sermons placed their primary emphasis on the magical, the mysterious, and on heaven more than on daily living and familiar things. Of the one hundred sermons that they studied, Mays and Nicholson found that only twenty-six touched on concrete life sit- uations. Fifty-four were predominantly otherworldly.90 In The Negro’s God, Mays contended that the compensatory, otherworldly view was not unique to blacks but was common among poor and oppressed groups in general. He detected that migration and improving eco- nomic circumstances had brought about a reorientation away from otherworldliness among blacks in the cities. This was cited as evi- dence for Mays that blacks’ ideas of God grew out of their social situ- ations, not from a racial temperament or innate religiosity. He recommended an improvement in the economic status of blacks and an enhancement of their opportunities for education, especially for minis- ters. Mays believed that the racial caste system in the South was to blame for the unfulfilled yearnings of the Negro, which were projected into another world.91 Though Woodson and Mays (among others) had their doubts about the image of God depicted in The Green Pastures, they repeat- edly criticized rural black believers for their focus on the “by and by.” Was this indirect confirmation of the commonly held claim that blacks were naturally religious and more concerned about an afterworld than this world? Surely there is irony in the effort to reconstruct the image of blacks as not being, in Mays’s view, overly emotional and super-religious when he and Nicholson spent so much time criticiz- ing blacks precisely because they believed that they were practicing an “otherworldly” and “emotional” religion. The alleged qualities of African American religious believers that were deemed so attractive to those who appreciated The Green Pastures were those that so vexed </page> <page sequence="27"> RAC1801_03.qxd  1/16/08  3:25 PM  Page 85 The Religious and Racial Meanings 85 black critics: a rural, small-town worldview, a fundamentalist, literal conception of the spiritual life and the world hereafter, an anthropo- morphic conception of God, and a carefree spirit about the hardships of this life. Although Mays indicated that he intended to show that black religious ideas grew out of their social situation and to refute indi- rectly the “Negro’s idea of God” depicted in The Green Pastures, it is not clear how and if he accomplished his goal because Connelly’s work was about more than “ideas.” It was about fantasy, imagination, and unconscious longings of both blacks and whites. Mays did show that blacks were facing extraordinary economic and social hardships and that there was no biological or racial basis to black religion (a cen- tral occupation of black sociologists in the 1930s and thereafter who wanted to demonstrate that blacks were not essentially different from whites and, thus, could integrate into the broader culture). He also demonstrated that there was a small number of highly literate African Americans who forsook entirely religious belief. Yet Mays’s central claim that the bulk of blacks in the rural South adhered to an other- worldly religion seemed to confirm the inferences that many blacks thought whites would draw from such plays as The Green Pastures. It is true that Mays pointed to economic deprivation of the black masses and their turn to religion as a compensatory mechanism to seek the symbolic and spiritual goods that another world offered as a substi- tute for the material and psychological “goods” that they lacked in this life.92 Though the reason or motive for belief among the masses was given a new spin in social and economic terms rather than basing it on racial or biological foundations, the fact of widespread religious belief and practice was still assumed. Though innate religiosity was denied by this new interpretation, Mays may have inadvertently doc- umented what he set out to disprove, namely, that the kind of reli- gion depicted in The Green Pastures was similar to what he found in the South, as he himself testified to in his constant criticisms of the otherworldliness and emotionalism of black rural religion. Conclusion In 1936, B. R. Crisler, writing for the New York Times, made one final comment on the short-lived movie version of The Green Pastures. Crisler wrote, “It is, indeed, hard not to like the simple and gratifying theology of The Green Pastures as much as anything about it. It has concreteness and gives one a nostalgic feeling that it ought to be true and that if it isn’t we are all, somehow, obscurely the worse for it.”93 The Hebrew narrative had acquired a new life on stage in the </page> <page sequence="28"> RAC1801_03.qxd  1/16/08  3:25 PM  Page 86 86 Religion and American Culture words and actions (from Connelly’s perspective) of simple religious black folk from the rural South. I have argued that white admirers of the play were able imaginatively to relive a faith that they had put aside, forgotten, or rejected in their move away from the traditions and location of their parents. These whites, part of a recently urban- ized America, felt a nostalgic longing for what was apparently lost.94 The stage became a way of working through their own spiritual and psychological issues. Whites were salvaging through Connelly’s play a religious “past” that many blacks wanted to bury. Black religious images have long functioned in this manner in the cultural imagina- tion of white Americans. Harriet Beecher Stowe’s created character was invoked by black critics of Connelly’s play precisely because, for them, “Uncle Tom” had become a negative reference, not a heroic figure. So when Connelly’s black God looks out pensively at the crowd and another figure exclaims, “O dat’s a terrible burden for one man to carry,” this was perhaps an issue that needed to be raised again in the perpetuation of this religious and suffering black type. As African American social scientific studies of black life demonstrate, African American longsuffering and patience rooted in a Christian worldview was being challenged and criticized precisely when white audiences were trying to recover and revive a version of that lost past.

Weisenfeld devotes an entire chapter to Connelly’s work, focusing particularly on the film version of the play. The first draft of this essay was written long before her book was published, and my conclu- sions were formed independently of her book, though I find nothing in her work that contradicts the arguments that I make. Weisenfeld’s more general arguments about the reproduction and representation of images of blacks in films complements and confirms many of my own con- tentions, though she has a different focus than my work. She claims that </page> <page sequence="29"> RAC1801_03.qxd  1/16/08  3:25 PM  Page 87 The Religious and Racial Meanings 87 demographic shifts in the African American population “from rural to urban captured artistic imaginations, as did the potential consequences of this transformation for African American claims to modernity and to citizenship” (5). This is a central emphasis of my essay in my attention to white and black interpretations of Connelly’s play. I am also inter- ested in Weisenfeld’s analysis of Connelly’s and other white artists’ claims to represent the “natural qualities” of blacks or black culture authentically. I look at the implications of these assertions for black interpreters. 5. Walter Lippmann, A Preface to Morals (New York: Life, 1957 [1929]), 9. Jack Poggi’s work on theater in the United States has shown that “Broadway was in severe depression by the 1930–31 season.” Even though ticket costs increased, the risks incurred to produce a play grew (a play that ran for fewer than a hundred performances in the 1920s was generally deemed to have lost money), and there was increased competi- tion from movies, which began using sound more widely by the 1930s. The Green Pastures was still a big hit. See Jack Poggi, Theater in America: The Impact of Economic Forces, 1870–1967 (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1968), 55–56, 58, 71–75. 6.

African American anthropologist Allison Davis, while doing research among blacks in New Orleans in the late 1930s, discovered a popular religious pageant, “Heaven Is My Home,” that had first appeared in black churches in the region in 1934. Although Davis does not mention any connection between this pageant and The Green Pastures, it is difficult to imagine that the former was not influenced by the latter. This pageant was probably a small-scale southern version of The Green Pastures. The image of the naturally religious and docile black, with the specific southern nostalgia for a romanticized antebellum past, proved potent and had an enduring influence.

ABSTRACT Marc Connelly’s The Green Pastures play was one of the longest running dramas in Broadway history. Responses to the play by blacks and whites demonstrate its contested nature. Whites generally lauded the drama for its simplicity and its childlike depiction of black religion in the rural South. African Americans, though hopeful that its all- black cast would lead to more opportunities for blacks on stage, were divided between a general appreciation of the extraordinary display of talent by its actors and worries about the implications of a play that seemed to idealize the rural South as the natural environment of carefree overly religious blacks. Connelly’s widely popular drama became a site of cultural debates about the significance of black migration to the urban North, the nature and importance of religion in black communities, and the place of blacks in the nation. Precisely when black social scientists were urging rural black Christians to abandon an otherworldly and emo- tional religion, white dramatists and literary artists were making more widely available what they saw as a picturesque and deeply rooted aspect of black folk culture. </page> <page sequence="36"> RAC1801_03.qxd  1/16/08  3:25 PM  Page 94 </page> </plain_text>
