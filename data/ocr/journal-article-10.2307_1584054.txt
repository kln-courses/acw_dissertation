RUNIA Aufstieg und Niedergang der romischen Welt, Teil II, Principat, Band 36: Philosophie, Wissenschaften, Technik. 1. Teilband: Philosophie (historische Einleitung; Platonismus); 2. Teilband: Philosophie (Platonismus [Forts.], Aristotelismus). Herausgegeben von W. Haase. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin-New York, 1987. xvi &amp; 712, xii &amp; 606 p. Price DM 438, 375. These substantial tomes represent the first two of a projected four volumes on philosophy in the Roman Empire up to the death of Con- stantine. Compared with the thirteen Bande (each multi-volumed) on Religion, a single Band devoted to the subject of philosophy (Band 37 will cover Science and Technology) might seem a bit on the thin side. But quantity is not everything, as readers of ANR W will readily agree. So these two volumes, which for the most part are of a high standard, will be welcomed both by scholars working in the field and by scholars seeking useful surveys of the results of recent research (among the latter will be many readers of this journal).

As already intimated above, the general standard of these two volumes is high. The editor is to be congratulated on the team of scholars he has managed to put together. The nature of the material is too heterogenous, however, and the diversity of approaches too great to allow a comprehensive and detailed review within the allocated space. I append, therefore, a few personal impressions. Unfortunately the series of volumes gets off to a rather disappointing start. Andre's article contains much useful information on philosophers of the first two centuries in their social environment. But important questions are not even asked, let alone answered. First and foremost, what is meant by the notion of a 'school'?-a question that can hardly be avoided since the revolutionary monograph by J. Glucker on An- tiochus and the Late Academy (not mentioned). Are the terms 'syn- cretisme' (16), 'eclectisme' (47) useful for the study of this period? 406 REVIEWS</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS What, we may ask, is 'la structure universitaire' in which the four domi- nant schools are said to be integrated (74)? The following two sentences contain no less than seven mistakes or inexactitudes: 'Arius Didymus, maitre et ami d'Auguste, peripateticien qui se situe dans le sillage d'An- tiochus d'Ascalon et qui a subi une impregnation stoicienne, atteste la vogue des doxographies par son 'Epitome'. Cette anthologie contenait la doctrine de l'Academie, du Peripatos, de la Stoa et du Jardin, et Stobee a conserve de l'oeuvre la doxographie stoicienne et la doxo- graphie peripateticienne (9)'. No mention of an entire monograph devoted to Arius a few years back (edited by W. W. Fortenbaugh in the Rutgers University Studies in Classical Humanities). Another sentence that struck me was: 'Le rayonnement de l'Academie a Athenes, apres Philon, est bien etabli, avec comme chefs Eudore, Arius Didyme, Aenesidemos (16 n. 100)'. I hope we are not meant to deduce that the philosophers named were Academic scholarchs. It is a relief to turn to the introductory article by Whittaker on Im- perial Platonism, which is a model of economy and meticulous ac- curacy. Henceforth there can be no excuse for scholars who continue to regard Albinus as the author of the Didaskalikos. The extremely valuable bibliography on Middle Platonism compiled by Deitz contains 867 items, demonstrating that one can hardly say any more that this period has received 'comparatively little attention', as claimed only a dozen years ago by John Dillon in the preface of his well-known book on the subject. The long article on Apuleius, in spite of its title, places greater emphasis on the philological than the philosophical side of his activity. Here 'the school of Gaius theory', which elsewhere Whittaker regards as old hat (102), is still in full force (435). Most articles abound with references to scholarly literature. But special mention should be made of the surveys specifically dedicated to that subject, namely the research surveys on Plotinus by Blumenthal and Corrigan-O'Cleirigh, on Porphyry by Smith, and on Alexander of Aphrodias by Sharples. Smith's date 1913 is determined by the remark- able fact that no comprehensive monograph on Porphyry of any weight has been published since the work of Bidez that appeared in that year. The final pages deal with remnants-real or supposed-of Porphyry's writings in the Church Fathers. Two contributions of virtual monographic proportions deserve special mention. Brenk examines the 'kaleidoscopic manifestations of Plutarch's timid but creeping transcendentalism and theism' in a study 407</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS that runs parallel to his monograph published in 1977, but devotes more attention to the scholarly literature (note illuminating remarks on the Dorrie-de Vogel controversy at 267-275). Gottschalk's survey on the history of the Peripatos from Andronicus to Alexander is simply the best available (and much more digestible than the large volumes of the late Paul Moraux). In one respect, however, his account is rather con- servative, namely in his attitude to Aristotle's non-scholastic works, which he lumps together with 'the popular writings influenced by Aristotle's philosophy' (1172). On the controversial issue of the dating of the work De Mundo Gottschalk argues forcefully in favour of a late (Imperial) dating, which to some extent goes against the current of re- cent opinion. Of the studies devoted in whole or part to Plotinus, Hadot's analysis of Ennead VI 7 is interesting on account of the way it tackles the problem of the work's structure. The work contains certain redactional artifices which reveal a deliberate literary composition (in spite of the testimony of Porphyry, probably not all compositional details were fixed before writing began). Six questions form the backbone of the work, each being dealt with both by means of question and answer (dialectic) and in a continuous discourse (rhetoric). The unifying theme of the work, which Plotinus may not have consciously formulated, is the strong stand it takes against any flirtation with anthropomorphism, the grossest form of which was found among the Gnostics. Strange's study on the interpretation of Aristotle's Categories in Neoplatonism, though brief, introduces an interesting diachronic perspective. It is argued that Porphyry's and Simplicius' defence of this work would not have been possible without Plotinus' pioneering labours, for he had shown, especially in VI 1-3, how language about Forms must be sharply distinguished from language about sensibles (I noted a nasty misprint at the top of p. 971, where presumably 'of' has fallen out before the words 'a subject'). Finally the exhaustive study by Brisson of the difficult question of the philosophical remains and importance of Plotinus' most devoted pupil, Amelius, is warmly to be welcomed. It will replace the virtually inaccessible monograph by Zoumpos, the only comparable study published on the subject hitherto. The intriguing citation in Eusebius of a patronizing but not unsympathetic comment by Amelius on the prologue of John's Gospel is dealt with only from the viewpoint of style. Some speculation on the source of this fragment would have been interesting. 408</page><page sequence="5">REVIEWS The appearance of the other two volumes, dealing with the remaining schools of thought in the early Imperial period, will be eagerly awaited. 3762 VA Soest, Pelikaanweg 7 D. T. RUNIA R. A. Pritz, Nazarene Jewish Christianity from the End of the New Testament Period until its Disappearance in the Fourth Century (Studia Post-Biblica 37). Jerusalem-Leiden, The Magnes Press, The Hebrew University, E. J. Brill, 1988. 153 pages. The author wants to give a history of Nazarene Christianity-a branch of Jewish Christianity in general-from its beginning among the earliest Jerusalem Christians until the fourth century when they were found in the region of Beroea. The Nazarenes are usually distinguished from the heretical Ebionites. The Nazarene Jewish Christians are supposed to have had an orthodox christology but to have lived according to the Jewish Law and its inter- pretation. This picture can be found since Epiphanus, Panarion 29, and it was taken over by Jerome and later Christians who did not give, how- ever, additional information about this sect. First hand sources about them are a limited number of quotations from their Gospel, mainly found with Jerome, and a few fragments of their explanation of Isaiah, also quoted by Jerome. From this evidence the author gives a survey of the history of this group but he has to fill in a number of blank spots. He supposes that the Nazarenes are the immediate successors of the Nazoraeans men- tioned in Acts 24,5 and living in Jerusalem. He assumes that they are Christians who fled from Jerusalem to Pella (cf. Eusebius, hist. eccles. III 5 3). The author also believes that Origen who spoke about two dif- ferent groups of Jewish Christians, has had in mind the Nazarenes and the Ebionites. These ideas are not quite new and they are still ques- tionable. The author's work on the first hand sources is not always satisfac- tory. The chapter about the Interpretation of Isaiah may be useful but that on the fragments of the Gospel according to the Nazoraeans is far less rewarding. This can be understood if one starts from the following assumption: "It is our position, then, that the one earliest Urschrift (if there was only one) or collection of logia was variously adapted and ex- 409</page></plain_text>
