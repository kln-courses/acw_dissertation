<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DINGO - A REVIEW By B. C. W. Barker* and Ann Macintosh** Introduction 'T'HE late Emeritus Professor N. W. G. Macintosh, anatomist and physical A anthropologist, achieved world acclaim for his studies, frequently in collaboration with the late S. L. Larnach, M.Sc, of the crania of Australian Aboriginals from various localities. Perhaps not so well known were his studies on the dingo. These researches commenced nearly 30 years ago with the aim of discovering what the animal was, its ancestry, where it came from and when. This involved a vast and complicated task ranging from the dissecting room to field expeditions throughout Australia. It involved breeding the animal in captivity, studying its behaviour and subjecting a large collection of dingo crania and post-cranial skeletons to morphological examination, both metrical and non- metrical. In his chapter on the dingo in the recent book The Wild Canids, Professor Macintosh stated that his study of this animal commenced in 1949 and was originally an ancillary tool towards the elucidation of the region of origin, or racial derivation and affinity of the Aboriginal Australians. If one could accept the postulations of Wood Jones (1921) that the dingo was brought by sea by the first Aboriginal colonists, a search for dingo affinity and origin might solve both problems. But the search for origin and affinity of the dingo posed a problem like that of the Aboriginal Australian, apparently having no close relations anywhere in the world. The purpose of this review is to bring into focus the part played by Professor Macintosh in adding to the body of scientific knowledge concerning the biology of the dingo, and to refer to some of the mass of earlier literature on the dingo, much of which is anecdotal, collected and studied by him. Review The Australian Encyclopedia, 2nd Edition, summarized what was then known about the dingo: "Dingo, or warrigal, a wild or feral species of the genus Canis, generally believed to have evolved from a domesticated version of the Asiatic wolf or dhole (Indian wild dog) which accompanied the ancestral Aborigines in one of their earliest invasions of Australia by a sea route and Â»Associate Professor of Dental Anatomy, University of Sydney. **Widow of the late Professor N.

The theory that it is indigenous to Australia is no longer tenable in view of the absence of any trace of kindred carnivores and the improbability that the similarity between the dingo and domestic breeds of dog could have been evolved independently. There is no evidence that the dingo preceded Aboriginal man: the occurrence of the bones of dingoes together with those of extinct marsupials is attributed to the redistribution of earth deposits, and the absence of other Asiatic non-marsupials in Australia discounts the theory that the dingo reached the continent by a land bridge across Torres Strait. It is estimated that from the late Pleistocene Period onwards canoes or rafts would have been necessary for the crossing . . . The dingo's strong canine teeth and habit of silent hunting are regarded as wolf-like characteristics, while its inability to bark - it utters only a drawn out howl - possibly indicates an even closer relationship with the Indian wild dog. It shares the northern wolf strain of origin with the more typical breeds of domestic dogs and according to Wood Jones, apart from the dingo's more powerful canine teeth, dingo skulls cannot definitely be distinguished from those of cattle dogs and similar adult dogs . . . Nevertheless, it is not true that dingoes have bred so freely with settlers' dogs that thoroughbred dingoes are relatively scarce. Nor is it true, as many people believe, that any blackish-brown brindle wild dog is the result of a dingo-Alsation cross. Although dingoes are usually creamy to reddish- yellow, other colours can occur in pure strains, and early explorers referred to yellowish-white, piebald and blackish dogs . . ." (Troughton, 1958). Recognition of the Dingo Macintosh, in his first publication on the dingo (1956) says: " . . . . records of the early navigators and explorers are of tremendous importance". The first reference to the dingo in European literature appears to have been an observation made in 1623 by Jan Corstenz who observed mastiff-sized tracks on the shores of the Gulf of Carpentaria. Earlier Dutch, Spanish and English made no mention of dogs on the west coast of Australia and, while one sugges- tion about the origin of the dingo is that the animal was imported by earlier Dutch or Portuguese navigators, the earliest authentic record of European landings in Australia is in 1606. Dogs let loose on the west coast in 1606 could hardly have proliferated across the continent by 1623. The best known reference from the early navigators is that by Dampier in 1688 describing two or three beasts like hungry wolves - lean like so many skeletons, being nothing but skin and bones. Although the term "warrigal" is preferred to "dingo" by some writers, in Trench's Botany Bay 1789 (Iredale, 1947) we find "the only domestic animal the Aboriginals have is the dog which in their language is called dingo". In 1792 Kerr based the name Canis antarticus on a figure of "a dog of New South Wales" included in Phillip's Voyage to Botany Bay 1789 (Iredale, ibid.),</page><page sequence="3">THE DINGO - A Review 29 but this has been replaced by the now familiar Canis dingo, based on the figure of a dingo in White's Voyage to New South Wales, 1790. The earliest reference to Canis dingo was by Meyer in 1793, but Oliver Goldsmith (no date) refers to the dog of New South Wales as Canis familiaris Australiesiae, Desmarest. Arrival of the Dingo Herbert Basedow (The Australian Aboriginal, 1925) highlights discussions which took place as to whether the dingo was indigenous to Australia or whether it had "come hither" from some other land, possibly with man. The dingo has never been traced to Tasmania; apparently its migration had not reached so far south before Tasmania was severed from the Australian continent by the flooding of Bass Strait, and it is reasonable to assume that it came to the south of Australia subsequent to the Aboriginals who inhabited Tasmania. McCoy (1861) asserted that the dingo is not clearly related to native dogs of continental Asia nor could any near analogues be found elsewhere. He recognized dingo bones and teeth in the Pliocene tertiary strata of Colac, Victoria in company with similarly mineralized remains of Thylacoleo, Diprotodon, Nototherium and other extinct genera and stated that this proved the dingo to be one of the most ancient indigenous mammals of the country, probably present long before man appeared. He regarded the dingo as by far the most ancient of any of the living species of dogs, nevertheless a true dog of the genus Canis, not a wolf and not any variety of the domestic dog. McCoy confused the issue concerning the dimensions of fossil and recent dingo by stating in one paper that although dingo dates from Pliocene tertiary time he could find no difference on the "most minute comparison of measure- ments between the two", but in a further paper (1862) he said "the various fossils of Canis dingo are perceptibly more robust than the modern variety". Etheridge (1916) also said the Wellington Caves specimens were "of a dog somewhat superior in size to the warrigal". The uncertainty relating to dingo origin following McCoy's pronouncement that this was an animal indigenous to Australia led Etheridge (ibid.) to postulate his two alternatives "introduced or indigenous", but he would not commit himself either way. Supporters of McCoy's indigenous theory were Krefft and Ogilby, the latter also postulating that the dingo is the ancestor of the domestic dog. Other theories claim that the dingo is a wild true species of Canis which came to Australia unaided by and unassociated with man, by a land route which has ceased to exist (Lucas and LeSouef, 1909); that the dingo is a domesticated dog which, as the companion of the Australian Aboriginal, came to Australia from the north by a land bridge or a sea route; that it owes its</page><page sequence="4">30 THE DINGO - A Review introduction to early Malay settlers from Asia; and finally the dingo has been said to be a domesticated dog introduced by Dutch navigators. Longman (1928) quotes Charles Darwin "In Australia the dingo is both domesticated and wild; though this animal may have been introduced originally by man, yet it must be considered as almost an endemic form, for its remains have been found in a similar state of preservation and associated with extinct mammals so that its introduction must have been ancient". A. R. Wallace (1893) refers to the dingo "as probably not truly indigenous". He adds "it is in fact difficult to understand how such an animal could, without assistance have arrived in the country, except by means which would have equally admitted the entrance of many other animals. It differs little from the wild or half wild dogs of India and other countries and this is an indication that it is geologically speaking a recent immigrant . . .". Thomson (1922) writes that man has had a lengthy history in Australia and the dingo, co-voyager with him, has been sufficiently long in the land to develop into a distinctive race, but the relatively large size of its teeth and its feral habits present evidence of its descent from wolf-like ancestors in Asia. Wood Jones (1921) refers to his 1918 statement concerning the arrival of Aboriginal man and the dingo, when he said no land bridge let them in, else a host of eutherian followers would have crossed Wallace's line in their company. Beyond doubt they came by sea and they came not as sea tossed castaways . . . "The progenitor of the Talgai man came with his wife, he came with his dog and with his dog's wife and he must have done the journey in a seaworthy boat, capable of traversing this unquiet portion of the ocean with his considerable cargo". If the dingo had walked here so also could apes and carnivores with resulting extinction of our marsupial population. Wood Jones (1921) castigates the upholders of the theory that the dingo is indigenous to Australia. "How the evolution of a monodelphian synoid could have been accomplished in the absence of any possible ancestral forms, is a point which the advocates of the indigenous origin of the dingo should be called upon to explain. The evolution of a modified northern wolf in an isolated portion of the southern hemisphere, tenanted solely by ornithodelphians, didelphians and a few stray monodelphian rodents and bats is a thing which ie zoologically inconceivable ... the supposition that the dingo is indigenous, that is that its phylogenetic story was unfolded in the confines of Australia, is absolutely untenable, and should, once and for all, be dismissed from literature having any pretence to scientific accuracy". In 1956 Macintosh said that it was curious that the dingo whose existence was known for 330 years had received little scientific investigation because the dingo is unique, apart from bats and rats, as the only placental mammal native to the continent. This lack of scientific attention is very different today.</page><page sequence="5">THE DINGO - A Review 31 Macintosh predicted that if a complete skeleton of a dingo was found whose geological age could with certainty be estimated as between 1000-5000 years, it could be used as a standard for comparison with present-day skeletons. But up to 1956, no genuinely attested antiquity could be placed on any dingo remains derived from archaeology. In his Elliot Smith paper (1974) Macintosh states "the dingo could not have been introduced into Australia much before 12,000 B.P., when some links in the Bass Strait causeway were flooded, because it did not get to Tasmania or the offshore islands; and certainly not before 8,000 B.P., or probably 6,500 B.P., the time range for separation of Australia from New Guinea, otherwise it would also be found in New Guinea. Jennings (1959, 1971) has shown . at glacial low sea level between 18,000 and 20,000 B.P. sea deeps up to 100 kilometers wide existed between the Java-Flores arc, the Banda Islands arc and Australia plus New Guinea and Tasmania. An alternative exit from south- east Asia passing through the Philippines to the Celebes and Moluccas to the Banda Islands arc and to New Guinea was interrupted by more than two, but shorter sea crossings". The dingo therefore had to be brought to Australia by man in some sort of sea craft. At Mount Burr in South Australia, fragments of teeth and jaws are stated to be dingo, charcoal bracketted to 8,000 B.P. in "disturbed" deposit. Macintosh thought the time context of these items could be open to doubt and he was not able to examine the fragments. The almost complete skeleton of a male dingo C-14 dated at 3000 B.P., excavated by Mulvaney at Fromm's Landing, South Australia in 1960, was reassembled and described by Macintosh (1964). He observed multiple fissure cracks in the tooth enamel. Ferruginous stain had invaded the enamel via these fissures and attrition was present on every tooth. Had the skeleton been presented out of context, there would have been no reason apart from the teeth to denote antiquity, since to the naked eye, it presented no patina, mineralization or encrustation. Wood Jones (1934) referred to rapid miner- alization in Australia, but the above dingo indicates that for some regions, absence of mineralization is compatible with considerable antiquity. Gill (personal communication to Macintosh) observed from fluorene phosphate indices, that the Colongulac dingo is younger than a female Aboriginal skeleton found there, but older than European advent. The enamel of the Ml is cracked and mottled brown, indicating some antiquity. It measures 23.1 mm mesio-distally and 9.78 mm labio-lingually which is at the extreme range of large size recorded for recent dingo teeth. All other fossils examined by Macintosh are within the range. In this fossil complete eruption of permanent dentition had occurred and the pattern of eruption time of dingo dentition approximates domestic dogs.</page><page sequence="6">32 THE DINGO - A Review According to Sisson (1945), M3 erupts by 6-7 months, and in the fossil dingo they had been functional, resulting in buceos-mesial wear polishing. The presence of M3 is one of the criteria aligning the dingo with wolf, domestic dog and jackal and separating it from the Indian red dog or dhole (genus Cuori). The upper and lower first, second and third premolar in dingo and dog do not make contact in occlusion, but nevertheless exhibit attrition. Wood Jones (1921, 1925) stated the continuous cingulum on the upper first molar as seen in jackals and foxes "is reduced or wanting in the middle of its length (labial) in wolves". He claimed that a similar condition in domestic dogs and dingo indicated their true wolf affinity but in the fossil under consideration the cingulum is not "wanting" - it is continuous and uninterrupted. This claim by Wood Jones has also been challenged by Tate (1952). The fossil dingo was originally aged by Macintosh at 23-27 weeks, but in the light of his subsequent work on dingo epiphyseal closure, time patterns were found in the dingo which differed from those of domestic dogs, and he revised the age at death to 18 weeks and its size similar to that of modern dingoes of that personal age. He further stated that dingo morphological pattern has remained unchanged for 3,000 years. The teeth of the fossil lie within the range of size for those of the modern dingo and the relative size of the teeth to one another is of a similar order. McCoy (1882) illustrated Canis teeth from Gisborne and from Lake Colongulac in Victoria. Etheridge (1916) illustrated three of seven Canis teeth from the Wellington Caves, New South Wales. Fossil remains of extinct mainland marsupials were also recovered from these sites. Gregory (1906) observed similar associations at Lake Eyre. These authors thought the association indicated contemporaneity and antiquity for the dingo of early post-tertiary time. But proof of contemporaneity is lacking as the deposits at Gisborne and Wellington cannot be stratigraphically identified. McCoy in 1882 studied the fossil dingo remains at Lake Colongulac - a small portion of the left lower jaw. At the same spot Thylacoleo carnifex was found. He felt that the fossil Canis dingo with its slightly greater depth of jaw under Ml was "perceptibly more robust than the modern variety". Professor Huxley's measurements (1880) of various living species of Canis, however, showed that such differences of measurement indicate varieties only, but the differences in direction of cusps etc. mark greater departures from the type, although in these respects approaching more to the Canis familiaris of the English greyhound type. McCoy (ibid.) also studied the fossil remains recovered from Gisborne - a right upper jaw containing second, third and fourth premolare then the Ml and M2 - and found all teeth indistinguishable from teeth of the living dingo. Several young skulls with deciduous teeth also accord with young living dingo. McGilp (1921) commenting on a report that "bones of the dingo were found with those of the Diprotodon and with human teeth as fossils in certain</page><page sequence="7">THE DINGO - A Review 33 parts of Australia" suggests the dingo bones are of less antiquity. He says dingoes had been observed in hot weather scratching a deep trench in the bed of a dry salt lake and camping therein. Their skeletons had occasionally been found as deep as 6 feet in tunnels which filled up. This could explain subsequent discovery of dingo bones juxtaposed with Diprotodon fossils. In a recent publication by Milham and Thompson (1976) dealing with excavations at Madura Cave, Western Australia, dingo remains were found down to a depth which dated to 3,45OÂ±95 B.P. A dessicated dingo carcass from Thylacine Hole on the Nullabor dated 2,200Â±96 B.P., and Mulvaney (1975) reported a date of 3,230Â±100 B.P. for dingo bones from Wombah on the north coast of New South Wales. These dates together with the 3,000 year old specimen from Fromm's Landing, suggest the dingo is a relatively recent arrival in Australia and place some doubt on the apparent date of c. 8,000 B.P. at Mount Burr in South Australia. Available evidence suggests displacement of Thylacine by dingo between 4,000 and 3,000 years ago with the somewhat later decline of the Tasmanian Devil, Sarcophilus. Wood Jones (1925) stressed the degree of uniformity of skull type in the dingo and refuted the popular belief that dingoes are so freely crossed with station dogs that a thoroughbred dingo is hard to come by. Tichota (1937) further stressed the uniformity of skull type and Macintosh in 1956 also rejected the popular belief about hybridization. From his large private collection of dingo material and his comparison of dingo and domestic dog crania, he was able to conclude that the dingo is separated from the domestic dog and is skeletally homogeneous across the continent. Mulvaney's 1960 archaeological find substantiates these views and proves that the dingo morphological pattern has remained constant for 3,000 years. As nearly the oldest genuinely dated dingo, thoroughly described by Macintosh, it establishes the pattern type of the dingo. Macintosh (1950) drew up a summary and conclusions on the paleonto- logical evidence: "There are no stratified horizons from which to draw conclusions about the contemporary relationship of dingo with extinct giant marsupials. Selwyn positively indicates that the animals walked into and died in the cave already existent in the basalt at Gisborne. Thompson positively indicates that the breccia at Wellington Caves is partly a product of "washed in" and "collapsed" material. "That occasional Sarcophilus and Thylacinus specimens were living up to a very recent time is certain. That the extinct giant marsupials persisted well into Recent time is probable. That there was slight overlap in the time range of dingo and Sarcophilus, Thylacinus and perhaps other extinct marsupials is almost certain.</page><page sequence="8">34 THE DINGO - A Review "That the terminal phases of the climatic change to aridity extended into the Recent period is highly probable. That the Aborigines were in the continent as early as the terminal establishment of aridity and while the last survivors of the giant marsupials were still alive, is possible. "When the dingo remains found amongst the thousands of specimens of extinct marsupials, amount to much less than 0.01%, the dingo must be regarded as a late arrival and not indigenous." These deductions of Macintosh confirm David (1923) who listed Gisborne, Lake Colongulac, Lake Timboom, Victoria; Wellington Caves, New South Wales; and Diamantina, South Australia as sites where dingo bones were found with extinct marsupials. David concluded (1932) that the dingo was certainly contemporaneous with extinct marsupials; was almost certainly introduced by man in the Pleistocene and man was almost certainly contemporaneous with extinct marsupials. Etheridge (1916) places a different interpretation on seven fossil teeth "of a dog somewhat superior in size to the warrigal" which he discovered among a quantity of thylacine and sarcophiline jaw pieces and loose teeth from the Wellington Gaves. He considered that of the seven teeth four showed evidence of having formed portion of Krefft's collection (1869-70, 1871). Plates and des- criptions of these are presented in comparison with teeth of a large domestic dog, Thylacinus and Sarcophilus. No doubt can be entertained that the teeth are from a dog. Etheridge accepts this as adequate proof of the existence of the dog in New South Wales in tertiary times. But the conclusions are not justified, as the horizon of the teeth is not known. Krefft and Thompson, in their excavation of the Wellington Caves record a jumble of bones, without stratification. There is no means of geologically dating the bones. All that has been proved is that mineralized teeth of a dog, and only seven at that, have been obtained from a cave which also contained vast quantities of other bones amongst which are those of Thylacinus, Sarcophilus, Macropus, etc. Lydekker (1893-94) stated that were it not for the fact that Australia has so few native mammals which do not belong to the marsupial group, the dingo would unhesitatingly have been regarded as an aboriginal inhabitant of the country where it was found; in which case it would rank as what we call a natural species. The improbability of Australia possessing a native mammal of such large size as the dingo, however, is so great as to induce the belief that the animal was introduced by man and hence that it originated from some of the dogs of Asia. This supposed introduction must, however, have taken place at so early a date that there has been considerable hesitation among some zoologists in admitting any such origin; and certainly the recent arguments in favour of it being an indigenous species have been very great.</page><page sequence="9">THE DINGO - A Review 35 Ogilby (1892) said "so high an authority on Australian zoology as McCoy having the concurrence of Professor Mivart cannot be ignored". That is, that the dingo inhabited Australia prior to man. The far reaching influence of publications by such eminent zoologists of their day as McCoy and Krefft is interesting. Their finding that the dingo was indigenous to Australia was accepted and quoted, sometimes as conclusive proof, by later authorities for more than 40 years. Well known supporters were Mivart, 1890; Ogilby, 1892; Gregory, 1906; and Lucas &amp; Le Souef, 1909. On the other hand, we should note that many 19th century authorities were strongly opposed to any suggestion that the dingo was indigenous, although very varied in their ideas as to how and when it might have been introduced into Australia. They included Mudie, 1829; Selwyn, 1858; Gould, 1863; Darwin, 1875; Tate, 1879; Thompson, 1882; Lydekker, 1893 and Wallace, 1893. Notable amongst those unwilling to commit themselves either way was Etheridge, 1916. Origin and Affinities of the Dingo According to Tichota (1937) the Australian dingo has attracted great interest for a long time because of its geographical spread on the isolated Australian continent, where the fauna has developed since Eocene times entirely separated from the rest of the world. The dingo lives there as the only higher placental mammal amongst the Australian marsupials, and seems to have been there since the Pleistocene. From the point of view of systematic zoology its phylogenetic relation to the Asiatic wolves (C.I pallipes and C.L hodophylax) is significant. The "dogologists" will be interested also in its kinship on one side to the prehistoric types of house dogs, and on the other side to the various recent forms of the south and the little Asiatic half-wild pariah dogs. There is, too, the question of kinship of the dingo with the recently extinct wild Tengger dog of Java which Studer regards as the founder of his southern stem group of house dogs. However, in his monograph Prehistoric Dogs (1901) Studer was concerned only with the kinship of the dingo with members of this south-stem group (Tengger, pariah, greyhound and the Tibetan dog). With regard to the spread of the dingo into Australia, the idea of its natural entry there, particularly its older developmental forms, has no substance because from the Miocene layers until now no Australian finds are known which would present a developmental link in the phylogenetic series of the canids. Also the dog has not been found on any of the islands which constitute the passage between Asia and Australia on arrival of Europeans; this speaks against the natural wanderings into Australia of the dingo, because it would have been preserved also on the islands along which it would have had to come. "The</page><page sequence="10">36 THE DINGO - A Review question of when and how the dingo was introduced into Australia has not been solved up to now". Although the origin of the dingo, because of its isolation amidst the Australian marsupials, has attracted the interest of zoologists, it is astonishing that so little interest has been given to its systematic position among the other canids. The problem is mainly to determine on an anatomical basis, primarily on craniological signs, whether the dingo is a separate zoological type, a third species of a narrower type Canis, or whether it is a dog that is a domesticated descendant of wolves or jackals. Tichota then refers to Wood Jones (1921) who showed himself definitely opposed to autochthonous origin of the dingo, and tried in a further study to explain its phylogenetic kinship with the stem groups of dogs of the Old World. He concluded that the dingo has the same phylogenetic origin, particularly with the wolf of northern Europe, and thereby excluded the jackal entirely from the phylogenetic development of all dog stems. Wood Jones saw the explanation in the similar shape of the chewing surface and the presence of a cingulum of the first upper cheek tooth in the dingo and the northern wolf, by which the dingo differs from the jackal and the fox. Tichota, however, feels that this is a mark of higher specialisation of the dentition of the wolf as opposed to the more primitive dentition of the jackal. Bell (1837) found the osteology of wolf and dog to be similar and the cranium absolutely so. In fact, the anatomy of wolf and dog showed no more variation than that found between different dogs. Wolf and dog have a gestation period of 63 days but the jackal has 59 days. Bell regarded gestation period as certain identification of species, yet wolf, dog and jackal were shown by Hunter (1789) to interbreed, suggesting that they are all one species. Wood Jones (ibid.) also tried to ascertain closer kinship of the dingo with any of the recent dog races and concluded that in shape of skull the Chinese Chow-Chow is closest to dingo. He did not, however, say what comparative methods led him to this conclusion, for he only compared the basicranial lengths of the skulls and the lengths of the canine teeth in 11 recent dog races with the same dimensions in 22 dingo skulls. The relatively long facial part of the skull of dingo with straight profile, flat frontal angle, high sagittal crest, flat zygomatic arches and powerfully developed dentition, is just the opposite of the short delicate face with the deep frontal angle, divided low sagittal crest and small dentition found in the type Canis familiaris palustris from the Danish neolithic settlement. This is even more marked with the Chinese Chow-Chow. Tichota found that the three dingo skulls he measured presented the greatest similarity with the prehistoric type Canis familiaris matris optimae jeit, with its long and narrow face. He summed up:</page><page sequence="11">THE DINGO - A Review 37 "From Wood Jones's work it follows that the skulls of the primitive dogs of the Melanesian and Polynesian islands belong entirely to the prehistoric type Canis familiaris palustris and that therefore the dingo was in no close kin relationship with the dogs found in islands before the immigration of whites into Australia. "The remarkable similarity of the skull of Australian dingo with the prehistoric type Canis familiaris matris optimae jeit is a confirmation of the correctness of the view of Jeitteles, who displaces the origin of the prehistoric type to Asia and deduces it from the Indian Canis pallipes Sykes. "The relationship of dingo with the type matris optimae jeit, and so also the relationship of that prehistoric type with the south Asiatic pariah dog, concerns also the Russian prehistoric finding of Canis putjatini Studer, therefore raising the possibility of the derivation of Canis familiaris matris optimae jeit from those older primitive forms, and drawing attention to the striking similarity of the skull of the Australian dingo". Tichota concluded by saying the dingo has kin relationship to the prehistoric types of the house dog, but it still remains to ascertain the relationship of the dingo and the whole type Canis familiaris matris optimae jeit with the living species of wolves of middle and south Asia (C.I. hodophylax and C.I. pallipes). A more recent author, Tate (1952) expresses his views on the origin of the dingo: "On continental Asia there are three main types of canids that might conceivably have been ancestral to the dingo. They are the Indian red dogs, Cuon; the jackals, Thos; and the wolves, Lupus. The first can be absolutely ruled out on structural grounds. Cuon has one fewer lower molars than the dingo and its remaining posteriorly terminal molars in both upper and lower jaws are relatively much smaller. There are other distinctive characters. Jackals, according to Jones, also differ in the character of the cingulum of the first upper molar which is quite strongly developed, while in wolves and dogs it is nearly obsolete. Jones states of a series of dingoes that they fall in line with all the other races of dogs in being of the true northern wolf type. Yet one of our dingoes shows the external cingulum of M1 almost as fully developed as that of any jackal and others show it in more incipient form. "This intermediate condition of the cingulum of M1 leaves room for the possibility of an introduction of jackal blood into the dingo in the remote past. "That jackals can be domesticated and will readily hybridise with dogs has been attested by Jeitteles and others. Jeitteles was of the opinion that jackals may have been ancestral to some of the smaller races of dogs, in particular the prehistoric "Torfhund", Canis familiaris palustris, of Switzerland and the Rhine Valley and certain dogs of ancient Egypt. In such case it follows that jackal blood may be present in the dingoes of Australia".</page><page sequence="12">38 THE DINGO - A Review Lydekker (1916) says the dingo is nearly related to the pariah dogs of southern Asia and eastern Europe, as well as to the "half-wild tengera dogs belonging to certain tribes in Java". Although the dingo was long regarded as a species by itself and named Canis dingo, it is not specifically distinct from the domesticated dogs of other parts of the world, and if entitled to scientific title should accordingly be known as Canis jamiliaris dingo. "If this animal was not introduced by man its occurrence in the native Australian fauna which includes no carnivora is simply inexplicable". Werth (1944) thinks that C.I. pallipes is the ancestor of the domestic dog and thinks that these dogs are identical with the prehistoric C.f. palustris of western Europe. The first evidence of the existence of a domesticated dog from the mesolithic was given by Bate (1937). From a collection of animal bones at Mount Carmel, Palestine, the skull of a large canid was found and provisionally referred to as C.f- vnatris optimae. Writing on the antiquity of the dog, specifically the find from Starr Carr, and other mesolithic dogs Degerb0l (1961) considered that for hundreds of thousands of years man lived as a food gatherer without domestic animals of any kind. Only from the mesolithic is there evidence of any domestic animals and the finds show that the dog was amongst the first animals to be domesticated and to be attached to human settlements. The skeletal material judged to be that of a domestic dog was recovered from a site at Starr Carr and this dates back to 9488 Â±350 B.P. A small dog, like C.f. palustris, with teeth much larger than in the palustris forms and comparable with the teeth in the much larger Greenland dogs. Two dogs which have been claimed to be of approximately the same age are the Senckenberg dog from Frankfurt and the Palestine dog. The skeleton of the Senckenberg dog, at first assumed to belong to a wolf, was eventually classed as a dog comparable in size to the dingo and C.f. poutiatini. It is now thought, however, that C.f. poutiatini is much later, perhaps from the neolithic. "The origin of the Australian dingo, whether it is a genuine wild dog or a domestic animal gone wild, has been questioned, but it is now generally assumed that it is a domestic dog that came to Australia with the first im- migrants. But it is also commonly accepted that the dingo, as well as C.f. poutiatini are generalized forms close to original domesticated dogs". That the dingo is some sort of dog is practically the only point upon which all writers agree. But what, zoologically speaking is a dog? It has been claimed that the domestic dog had its origin in the jackal, in the wolf, or in some species no longer extant. It has been claimed that the domesticated races were</page><page sequence="13">THE DINGO - A Review 39 polyphyletic. Again it has been held that domestic dogs have arisen by the crossing of various wild stocks living or extinct. Clutton-Brock (1977) observes that all the studies that have been conducted on the behaviour of canids support the hypothesis that the wolf was the ancestor of the dog. Examinations of the morphological characters of the dog including brain shape, skeletal anatomy and dentition, all point to closer resemblances to the wolf than to other species of Canis, these being the coyote Canis latrans and the jackals Canis aureus, Canis mesomelas, Canis adustus and Canis simensis. The review of canid taxonomy by the British Museum (Clutton- Brock et al, 1976) suggests that, while the dog and Australian dingo lie closest to the wolf in phenetic characters, the jackal, Canis aureus (the only species of jackal to overlap the wolf in distribution) is not far separated from them. All the species of Canis that have been examined have the same chromosome number of 78. In some respects the Falkland Island wolf can be compared with the Australian dingo. This canid (which was not a wolf although it bore a closer resemblance to one than any other member of the genus Dusicyon australis) died out about 1880, having been exterminated by sailors, fur trappers, etc. Both the above canids showed the same characters that are associated with domestication, these being white markings on the pelage, a wide muzzle with large somewhat compacted teeth in the premolar region, and expanded frontal sinuses. "The dingo is now generally accepted as being a feral domestic dog, perhaps of many thousands of years standing; it is probably also the last 'pure' breed of dog in the world. There is in fact no reason why man could not have taken tamed canids either to the Falkland Islands or Australia at any time during the prehistory of the last 10,000 years" (Clutton-Brock, 1977). Dingo in Aboriginal Mythology Relevant to the question of the dingo's arrival in Australia, Macintosh (1956) studied Aboriginal mythology, possibly oldest on the east coast, and discovered a reference to one of the earliest "Sky Gods" having been accom- panied by the dingo on his arrival. There are equally clear cut references to the arrival in the north of what seemed to be much later "mythological beings" accompanied by warriors who performed ritual associated with the dingo totem. Findings were not conclusive, but could indicate that the dingo was contemporary with the earliest mainland Aborigines and that successive waves of Aborigines may have brought successive waves of dingoes. But it could equally well be that the dingo, as a more recent arrival, was grafted onto the old strata of myths. In unpublished work Macintosh commented that the exploration of mythology, cave paintings and rock engravings gave equivocal findings as to when the dingo might have come to Australia, and he rather leaned (in the 1950s) to the view that the dingo was a later rather than an earlier arrival.</page><page sequence="14">40 THE DINGO - A Review Exploring three rock shelters at Mount Manning, 64 miles north of Sydney, Macintosh (1965) found six dark red ochre paintings comprising a male and a female anthropomorph, each with cephalic horns, also a male and a female dingo, and a male and a female echidna. This ritual group is deduced from radiocarbon analysis of charcoal to have been painted approximately 1400 A.D. Macintosh discussed mythology surrounding the dingo with the late W. E. Harney, who was convinced that the dingo was intimately related to ritual and fertility and was rarely associated with mundane matters. "The traditional notion expressed by Wood Jones that the first Australian came by boat with his wife and his wife's dog, probably needs complete revision as far as the dog is concerned. It is beginning to seem more likely that the dingo arrived later than the advent of the first migrants into the continent, and that the dingo's arrival was contemporary with the introduction of innovations such as circumcision and subincision. These rites had only reached the far north west corner of New South Wales at the time of European advent."1 (Macintosh, 1965). In an adjacent chamber of the same cave complex at Mount Manning there are paintings in different colour, style and technique of eels, snakes, wallabies, emus and hand stencils radiocarbon dated 1750-1800 A.D. The importance of this cave is that it segregates sacred from profane Aboriginal paintings and emphasizes the importance of the dingo in Aboriginal mythology. Just when the dingo first assumed significance in mythology, painting and rock engraving is not known but Macintosh (1971) felt that it may date from about 6,000 years ago, and may well be associated with revolutionary changes in Aboriginal culture and stone technology. Returning to the affinity of the dingo and dog, Macintosh (1956) considered that to date his work suggested that "the dingo's prototype has been lost and the dingo represents a survival in an isolated environment. A great number of features separate him from the ordinary dog. Some aspects of his mating behaviour are quite different, his gait is characteristic of neither domestic dog, nor wolf, nor coyote, and is peculiarly his own. His howl and the various other noises he makes are not to be matched precisely by any other canid. His reserved and aloof attitude combined at the same time with a high capacity and apparent desire for affection is almost unique among the canids. Anatomically all the dingo's features are within the canid range; nevertheless 1 The group or groups of Aboriginal migrants who brought the dingo might well have introduced new cultural elements as Macintosh suggests, but hardly circumcision and sub- incision. These practices were much later than the arrival of the dingo. Dampier, spending two months in 1688 on the northern tip of Dampier Land Peninsula, where the ship, the Cygnet, was careened, observed tooth avulsion but not circumcision although he reported this from the Philippines. Moreover, this practice followed by subincision was still spreading fan-wise from the north-west of the continent east and south-east during early years of white settlement, and had not reached the south-west corner of Western Australia nor the eastern third of the continent (note from Professor Elkin).</page><page sequence="15">THE DINGO - A Review 41 the mean of these characteristics, or the central type is not matched by any other canid and . . . blood serum tests give different results from tests on ordinary dogs". Macintosh was unable to see the dingo as parent, offspring or cousin of the pariah dog and felt there were too many anatomical and behavioural differences basic and plastic for the dingo to be a derivative of Canis lupus pallipes (the Indian wolf). Troughton (1971) postulated the New Guinea Highland dog as the only ancestor of the dingo, but morphology separates Canis hallstromi from dingo and equates it with the Pacific Islands dog (Macintosh, 1974). While the dingo's ancestry and affinities remain enigmatic, Macintosh {ibid.) considers the only dingo-like animals which can be located along the possible routes from Asia are the recently extinct dog from the Tengger Mountains of Java, and possibly an existing dog of the Philippines. Zeuner (1946) says most palaeontologists recognize the close relationship between pariah dog and dingo, but Macintosh (1975b) regards dingo and coyote as closer than dingo and pariah. Clutton-Brock (1963) is very definite that no doubt can exist that dingo and Indian pariah dog have evolved from the Indian wolf, while the Starr Carr and Maglemosian dogs evolved from tamed northern wolves. She states that the dingo is the only breed of dog that can be considered as derived purely from the Indian wolf. Macintosh believed it would ultimately be shown that man reached North America contemporaneously with man reaching Australia, and similarly that the coyote reached America via Bering Strait contemporaneously with the dingo's arrival in Australia. He admitted that this was of course "sheer speculation" (1975b) derived from an inclination to visualize a common ancestor for Indian wolf (C.I. pallipes) and its related forms (C.I. chanco, C.I. laniger), dingo and coyote, rather than the present picture making a range of canids unlike in morphology and behaviour, descendants of the palaearctic wolf. Some Comparative Comments Longman (1928) writes that the wide ranging Indian wild dogs, usually placed in the genus Cyon or more correctly Cuon, may have a skin which closely resembles the dingo, although cranial and dental characters associated with the genus Cuon have been usually interpreted as denying close relationship with other dogs. Hodgson established the genus Cuon 1838 for these Indian dogs because of the deficiency in the mandible of the third molar. Third molar is a variable unit and Longman comments on its absence bilaterally in a grey wolf in the collection. But it is invariably present in his series of 14 mandibles of dingo and there is no wear. There are also records of its rare occurrence in Cuon itself. Thus it seems somewhat arbitrary to eliminate remote progenitors of the Indian wild dog from the lineal ancestry of</page><page sequence="16">42 THE DINGO - A Review the dingo on the sole basis of this variable distinction. But fossil Cuon show this deficiency in the molar series and it is not confined to modern species. Mivart records a Cuon in which there was no trace of the upper second molar. All domestic dogs seem to have descended from a wolf-like ancestor. Wood Jones points out that the dingo may be separated from other breeds of domestic dogs by its relatively larger teeth, being more wolf-like in this respect. It may be said that in the dingo the antero-posterior length of the carnassial is more than 10% of the basal length of the skull. In domestic breeds the length of the tooth is distinctly (usually) less than 10%. In Longman's specimen of the Indian dog the basi-condylar length of the skull is 181 mm and the length of the carnassial is 21.5 mm. The carnassial is thus relatively longer in the Indian dog than in the dingo and it is distinctly greater than the combined lengths of the following two molars. In the dingo the length of the carnassial is about equal to that of the two molars. The first upper molar of the dingo is relatively broader than that of the Indian dog. In the absence of a well marked cingulum on the upper molars, Cuon agrees with true dog and wolf and is unlike jackal and fox. As noted by Mivart (1890) the cranium in Cuon is but little elevated in the inter-orbital region when seen in profile, being very distinct from the dingo, which, owing to the development of the large frontal sinuses, has a pronounced downward curve to the nasals. There is little evidence in the Indian dog of the outward bend of the lower dental series at the junction of the premolars and molars, which is characteristic of the dingo and most dogs and wolves, but which is not found in the coyote or jackal. The talon of the lower carnassial in Cuon is unicuspid, whereas in Canis it is composed in the main of a strong outer and a lesser inner tubercle. The skull of a dingo used by Mivart for comparison with Cuon was longer than that of the Indian species but his comparative measurements show that Cuon is relatively broader. Thus the cranial distinctions between Cuon and the dingo are considerable, apart from the characteristic deficiency in the lower molar series. Comment on the Papuan dog is relevant. Basi-condylar length over antero- posterior length of upper carnassial is 146-149/16-15.5 mm. The upper carnassial is about equal to the combined lengths of the two molars and this proportion is usually found in the dingo and some other dogs. The breadth of the palate between the canines is relatively greater in Papuan dog than in dingo. The Papuan dog is a small breed of true dog, possibly not truly feral, with no obvious distinctive features and apparently not closely related to the dingo. But it is of interest to note that this race agrees with dingo, Indian wild dog and wolf in the relatively large proportion of the upper carnassial tooth which is more than 10% of the basi-condylar length of the skull.</page><page sequence="17">THE DINGO - A Review 43 Coat colour in the Dingo Macintosh (unpublished Ms) recorded variation in coat colour of the dingo population across the continent and observed that it is nearly always quoted as an indication of inter-mixture with the domestic dog; this idea is very firmly implanted in most cases, one writer going so far as to assert that there is not a pure dingo left in Australia. But colour patterns are often so variable and may change so easily that they may be among the least reliable indications of natural relationships. It has been shown recently that in the case of some mammals anyway, pure lines in the course of continual inbreeding do split up into sublines, showing sometimes greater variation than is produced by crossing between pure lines. Dingo populations are very localized in some areas of Australia and are not migratory in the true sense of the word. It seems possible that a high degree of inbreeding occurs in these regions where, in addition, hybridization with domestic dogs is almost impossible. Yet in these regions much variation in the local dingo population can be seen. This appeared to be the case in the far north-west corner of New South Wales. The colour range in the dingoes observed on that particular field study included rich yellow, tawny grey and cream. Wood Jones (1921) commented that the "first white men who came in contact with the dingo remarked that both black dogs and red ones were common". This is more than amply borne out and he could have added white, cream, yellow, tawny, rust, brown etc., also occurred. While some degree of hybridization almost certainly occurs in parts of Australia, cross-breeding nevertheless has certainly been exaggerated or over stressed in the past, and should not be assumed merely because of varied colour in dingoes seen in any area. Besides being split up into local subspecies, a species may show polymorphism, which is much commoner than is usually realized. Provided colour variation in the dingo population is an example of polymorphism, it is extremely interesting that observations made from about 1790 onwards agree closely with what Macintosh found on his surveys in widely different parts of Australia, suggesting that polymorphism is stable or balanced. On the other hand, the balance may be in part ecological, that is the environment may alter the equilibrium, because in some areas of Australia Macintosh found black dingo predominating, and it would seem that the black dingo may enjoy some selective advantage in these areas. Macintosh examined all historical illustrations, paintings and sketches of the dingo but these were not helpful, being influenced by the artistic conventions of the period and also by the subjective impression of the artist as to what other dog, or wolf, or fox, or even lion he thought the dingo resembled. Macintosh was left with the impression that in poise, proportion and ranginess the coyote and dingo have similarities, but he wanted some intermediate similarity to the dingo from regions geographically near to Australia, i.e. India, Malaya, the</page><page sequence="18">44 THE DINGO - A Review Indonesian islands and south-east Asia generally. Finding that the animals which superficially looked something like dingoes were either dholes {Cuon alpinus) or jackals {Cams aureus) or pariahs {Canis indicus) in decreasing order of similar appearance and behaviour, he realized that the problem of dingo affinity was like that of the Aboriginal Australian, but appreciably more difficult. Behaviour Macintosh (1956) stated that the dingo is popularly presented as a savage, ruthless killer with a nature which is essentially predatory, cruel and cowardly. But he strongly felt that the dingo is, if anything, less savage, less cruel and less cowardly than most other breeds of dog would be if faced with the same conditions of killing for survival. With regard to the alleged menace of the dingo to sheep and calves, Macintosh eventually concluded that the dingo served a useful role as a predator on such pests as rabbits, plagues of marsupial mice, feral rats and as a remover of carrion, while admitting its depredations on sheep and perhaps calves. "This is not to deny that sheep are attacked and bitten, but it is not on the wholesale scale formerly and still believed. My views expressed in 1956 have changed appreciably" (1975b).2 His first step was to review abstracts from all the daily or weekly newspapers of the major cities and country towns back to their inception. This led to perusal of pastoral, stock and station journals also. The derived information about dingoes was so totally contradictory that he drew up a questionnaire and distributed it continent-wide to graziers, farmers, pastoral organizations, vermin boards, doggers and trappers. The conflict of opinions was again apparent and he realized he would have to see for himself. Many field trips followed and on one of these he collected a litter of one male and three female very young pups whose coats were identically rich reddish-brown. From these four pups four successive generations, totalling 42 dingoes, were inbred in captivity at the University of Sydney. In this experiment, Macintosh observed many behavioural patterns and made other observations hitherto unrecorded: coat colour changes, growth changes; the time and duration of oestrus, the season and actual length of time of mating and alteration of behaviour at this time; the relative dominance of individual males and individual females, their preference in their choice of partners; the duration of pregnancy and the maternal treatment of the offspring; the exact time when the pups begin to crawl, when they first get to their feet, 2 A television documentary (TCN 9, Sydney, 18-1-1979) entitled "Dangerous Immi- grants", concerning the menace of buffalo and wild pig in northern Australia, showed a dingo chasing and catching a young pig. The accompanying commentary included a statement to the effect that some pastoralists were in favour of dingo numbers great enough to control the wild pig population.</page><page sequence="19">THE DINGO - A Review 45 when their eyes first open, when their ears first become erect and when they first lift their tails. (Contrary to Cuvier's (1827) observation that the nature of the dingoes transported to Paris was essentially savage and recalcitrant, Macintosh found his dingo colony, without any coercion, proved most affectionate and pleasant natured.) Sound recorders were employed day and night and every noise made by the dingo from birth to full adult life and mating was recorded. The fact that dingoes cannot bark nor can they be taught to bark was verified. Wood Jones (1925) says "Its only drawback is its dismal howl" but Macintosh, subjectively, found the howling musical and attractive, particularly when all the animals participated. The nocturnal howling concerts invariably began with one animal, then another and so on until all were orchestrating. Howling was rare in the daytime but could be provoked by howling beside a dingo. When it finally responded another might join in and then perhaps the others. The recordings were transmitted to an electronic wave recorder and compared with tracings transmitted from recordings of coyote howling, New Guinea yodelling or laughing dog, and wolf. Macintosh did not have the oppor- tunity of learning to interpret these tracings, but he observed that they were visually and obviously differential. Speed photography of the dingoes being walked, trotted and run on leads was analyzed in slow motion. The high stepping, almost mincing gait of the dingo is somewhat similar to that of the coyote and different from that of wolf and pariah. A parallel method of taking the dingoes on long leads over wet beach sand and then photographing and measuring the tracks indicates the difference in dingo and wolf placement of fore- and hind-feet. Cuvier (1824), describing the dingo taken to the Jardin des Plantes in Paris by early French navigators, stated that it was incapable of swimming. Many present-day pastoralists hold a similar belief, saying a deep river constitutes a natural barrier to the dingo. Macintosh found that none of his colony wanted to enter water, but once thrown in they invariably made for shore and proved competent and very powerful swimmers. "Rivers do sometimes demark a region in which dingoes are operating but it is because the animal limits itself to a biochore circumscribed by a variety of complex factors. These areas vary in size in different regions and at different time periods, certainly in some cases in cycles, and this explains why a district free of dingoes for some years suddenly finds itself invaded again. How analagous this appears to the Aboriginal semi-nomadism; the tribe moves within the tribal territory in cycles which subserve many complex requirements including conser- vation of game" (Macintosh, 1975b) .</page><page sequence="20">46 THE DINGO - A Review As is well known, dingoes unlike the domestic dog, breed not twice but only once a year, in early autumn, and if transported to the northern hemis- phere the pattern of autumn mating and winter whelping is picked up, after circadian adjustment. Maternal devotion to dingo pups is limited. In the first fortnight the bitch is defensive against the adult male; after that the adult males avoid treading on pups and ignore tail and heel nipping. In the wild state this lack of maternal defence, supervision and possessiveness is even more marked. Neither in captivity nor in the wild did Macintosh observe any evidence of teaching; the pups learn by experience, observation and emulation. Aboriginal and Dingo relationship Macintosh considered that the dingo was brought to Australia as a quasi- companion not in the true sense of a domesticated animal. Aboriginal association with the dingo reveals only minimal symbiosis. Many accounts exist of Aboriginal and dingo relationship, roughly divisible into half alleging aboriginal use of the dingo as an aid to hunting and half alleging the uselessness of the dingo to the Aborigines for any purpose at all. Gould (1970) visited a small group of Aborigines in the heart of the Gibson Desert in Western Australia and observed 19 dingoes in and around the camp. These dingoes were often fondled but rarely fed, and could therefore only exist by whatever their own personal hunting provided and by stealing anything in the camp. The men setting out to hunt constantly drove the dingoes back to camp. As the Aborigines hunt from concealment the dingoes would be a liability. One may ask what the dingoes did to favour their continued presence in an Aboriginal camp? It seems that they provided "blankets", sleeping huddled against the Aborigines for mutual warmth in the near-freezing desert nights. Mitchell (1839) remarked that the Australian natives evince great humanity in their behaviour to their dogs. In the interior there were few natives not followed by some of these animals and women not infrequently suckled the young pups. Meggitt (1965) examines the ways in which Aborigines have exploited dingoes and tries to estimate the utility of the animals as hunting aids. Tribesmen at Ooldea in South Australia commonly use dogs for hunting and prize those of the dingo-type most highly. Such dogs receive individual names, are fed, sleep with their masters as a means of keeping warm, and in most tribes the Aborigines show their dogs great kindness. Although fed they receive nothing but the bones and Mitchell (ibid.) also observed that the dingoes "are always miserably thin so that we know a native's dog from a wild one by the starved appearance of the former". In contrast to this view, Lumholtz (1890) and Basedow (1925)</page><page sequence="21">THE DINGO - A Review 47 assert that Aborigines as a rule fed their dogs well. Basedow also states that a native rarely allows his dogs to go with him in hunting. As to whether or not dingoes breed in camps there is little directly relevant evidence. However the long term experimental observations by Macintosh of dingoes reared at the University of Sydney, indicate that the breeding habits of the animals are considerably affected when they are under restraint, and the change is generally in the direction of a lower breeding rate. On this basis it seems to Meggitt reasonable to assume that if dingoes did breed while living in Aboriginal camps, they would not do so at a rate high enough to counterbalance the constant loss of tame dingoes through death or running away. He also thinks the association between Aborigines and dingoes must have been one of quasi-domestication, i.e. the repeated training of randomly acquired individuals in successive generations, not the domestication of the whole species. Meggitt concluded that the available evidence, limited as it is, suggests that over wide areas of Australia the tame dingo was by no means an effective hunting dog and that it contributed relatively little to the Aborigines' larder. It seems that only in ecologically specialized regions where particular types of game were abundant (as in the tropical rain forests), was the tame dingo a significant economic adjunct to the family hunting unit. Differentiation of Dingo from Domestic Dog Macintosh undertook a detailed analysis of 12 metrical and 33 non-metrical characters of femora in his dingo collection and found only a narrow range of variation in adult animals. Subsequently he found the 33 characters could be reduced to 1 1 to give the same result. Domestic dogs within individual breeds, and more strikingly where different breeds are included, give a wider range of variation, but diagnostic value is low because the domestic dog ranges encompass those of dingo. Similar results were derived from a study of humÃ©rus, ulna and tibia. Indices as used by Mivart in 1890 are useful in classifying different types of wild dogs, but are not useful in separating wild dogs from domestic dogs. Investigating the possibility of segregating skeletons into age groups, Macintosh first used radiography of corpses from his own colony where dates of birth and death were known, and assessed degrees of epiphyseal fusion. He discovered that epiphyseal unions and eruption of third molar teeth were appre- ciably earlier in dingo than in domestic dog (Table 1 ) although Sisson's quoted epiphyseal fusion gives no details about number of specimens or breeds. But as far as post-cranial measurement and indices are concerned, the overlapping ranges of domestic dogs allowed no differentiation from dingo. It was decided therefore to undertake a comparative study of the skull based on methods used on Aboriginal human crania (Larnach &amp; Macintosh, 1966, 1970).</page><page sequence="22">48 THE DINGO - A Review Table 1 Age in months at near complete epiphyseal fusion.

Skull Characters (Table 2 and Figure 1). Over a period of seven years Macintosh studied 120 metrical and non- metrical traits of dingo and domestic dog skulls. Characters which were obviously not differentiating were progressively eliminated until only 45 remained. A variety of statistical exercises finally reduced them to 11. Values of one, two or three were assigned to the grades of development of each character. These were totalled for each skull to determine its score. When the adult skulls were plotted out on the basis of their scores there was good separation between dingo with a range of 25-33 and domestic dog with a range of 10-22 (Figure 1). 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 32 DOMESTIC DOGS MIXED BREEDS 78 DINGOES ADULT ADULT Ï -ill II i Ji M i :ÏÎ¹_ ÏÎ¹-Î. .

Macintosh's collection of domestic dog crania included great dane, pomeranian, various terriers and mongrels, cattle dog and kelpie; this presumably accounts for the irregularity of the domestic dog histogram and it is noted that cattle dogs and kelpies more nearly approach the dingo ranges but are still separated. The compactness of the dingo histogram seems to confirm continent-wide homogeneity and gives no cause to suspect hybridization. Macintosh (1975) concludes his chapter in The Wild Canids by stating ". . . we believe the pattern here described represents an original contribution, which nevertheless may need modification or refinement when larger series are analyzed, it need scarcely be cautioned that this pattern of 11 traits is not of universal application; different characters might have to be used if discrimi- nation is attempted between say dingo and coyote, dingo and wolf, dingo and Tengger dog, and so on". Summary It seems suitable that a summary be drawn from the writings of Professor Macintosh. Accordingly the summary at the end of his chapter for "The Wild Canids" (1975b) is quoted in full: "A review of the literature shows that the dingo is claimed to resemble closely the pariah dog, Tengger dog, C.f. poutiatini, and is linked with the Starr Carr limb bones, the Senckenberg dog (called by Degerb0l (1961) the European Mesolithic dingo) and is therefore also linked with C.f. mains optimae, C.I. pallipes, C.I. hodophylax by various authors, and to a Canis ferns by Studer (1901) andZeuner (1963). Synonym should be Canis antarticus Kerr, 1792 followed by Canis dingo Meyer, 1793. Dingo may have been the Aboriginal word for white man's dog. McCoy (1882), Krefft (1865), Gregory (1906), and Etheridge (1916) initiated claims that the dingo is indigenous and of Pliocene antiquity, based on mÃ©langes of extinct marsupial fossil bones and fragments of dingo jaws and teeth. These are invalidated. The almost complete skeleton of a male dingo of 18 weeks is C-14 dated 3000 B.P. from South Australia and proves that dingo morphology is unchanged to the present, so supporting Wood Jones (1921), Tichota (1937), and Tate (1952) that the dingo is homogeneous and not crossed. At Devil's Lair, W.A., and Mt. Burr, S.A., slight remains accompanied by some dubiety are reported at 8500 and 8000 B.P., thus approaching the 9500 B.P. Starr Carr and Coon's (1951) 11,480 B.P.

Aboriginal rock art and mythology indicate recent introduction of the dingo.</page><page sequence="25">THE DINGO - A Review 51 Eustatic and bathymÃ©trie studies (Jennings, 1959 and 1971) show that Torres Strait was flooded 6500-8000 B.P. and Bass Strait 12,000-13,500 B.P. As the dingo has not been found in Tasmania, New Guinea, or offshore islands, it must have arrived in Australia after 13,500 B.P., almost certainly not more than 9000 years ago. Even at glacial low sea level 18,000 years ago, Australia was separated from lands to the north west by at least two deep straits up to 100 km wide. It is C-14 proven that man was established in Australia 30,000 years ago, so the first arrivals had to come by sea. Some 20,000 or more years later the dingo was also brought by sea. Discrimination of dingo from domestic dog by a pattern of 11 cranial traits is offered as an original contribution and tooth eruption and epiphyseal closure are shown to occur earlier in dingo. Brief, speculative comment is made about the relevance of the advent of man, coyote, and dingo in America and Australia. Aboriginal relations with the dingo reveal only minimal symbiosis. It is considered that the dingo cannot be domesticated, and never was; it was brought here as a quasi-companion. The dingo gait, howl, morphology, and some elements of its behaviour observed in captivity and reported in this paper are peculiar to it alone. Its ancestry and affinities remain enigmatic".
