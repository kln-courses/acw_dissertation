<plain_text><page sequence="1">125 Statuary and Surveys Robert North 1 Among recent publications on the archeology of the Near East, an outstanding volume treats all the sculpture known in the radius of Mesopo- tamia, including Iran and Anatolia but not Egypt, from earliest to Hellenistic times. Both giant and tiny statues are included, despite hesitations which this policy aroused; and for this and other reasons in the nature of the material, the classification-patterns are flexible within a broadly chronological frame- work. The earliest known statues happen to be from Palestine: a Natufian bust around 8000 from Carmel, a head from Mallaha, then (not failing to notice mysterious Anatolian efforts from Çatal Hiiyük and Hacilar; also Cauvin's figurines from North-Syria) the famous modeled-skulls of Jericho, with their parallels at Beisamoun in North-Galilee and Ramad in Syria. Beersheba and the coastal plain of Lake Tiberias, Ur and the Antioch plain also furnish earliest mute witnesses; while surprisingly animal representations are almost totally missing from this earliest period. Early Mesopotamia then merits four chapters for the third millennium alone, culminating in the golden age of Lagash 2130. In the Middle Bronze Age, Palestine comes to the fore again with statuettes in both stone and metal; while attestation of the Mesopotamian dynasties comes largely from Elam. Page 294 offers no explanations for making the period 1600-1000 a single unit, though surely not only in Greater Syria the momentous transition from Bronze to Iron Ages with accompanying historical upheavals came in 1200. Sur- prisingly also a single chapter suffices for all the statuary in the whole Middle East between David and Alexander. The final caption 'Conclusions' arouses great hopes of synthesis-cum- analysis; these are indeed adumbrated within the brief p. 440, evoking the turning-points of the preceding chapters but in a vague and faceless way; a dozen pages summarizing in detail the data furnished for analysis of art and the human spirit would have been preciously in place. One fact at least stands out: the matrix of occidental plastic art coincides with the cuneiform area! 2 A further volume of the same Handbuch der Orientalistik treats almost exclusively chariots, as is clear from the illustrations.

North that the humbler dray-carts or harness or riders are neglected, but in the nature of things our monuments preserve the pageantry and panoply of war. The chapter-headings are remarkably unimaginative, by half -millennia: late 4th, early 3d, late 3d .... really these are not classification-divisions at all; it would have been easy to pick out dominant motifs or progress in the re- spective period, while the recurring subdivisions 'four- wheelers', 'riding', 'draught- animals' surely do not represent unities which start and finish with the turn of a century. In compensation, there are ample summaries for the separate 'un-chapters', but no trace of synthesis. 3 The name of Hatshepsut evokes so inescapably the most photogenic surviving masterwork of Egyptian architecture, it comes as a surprise to learn that someone was interested in the sculpture of her era, and for a doctorate at that (Brussels Free University 1973 under Pierre Gilbert). Structurally this book is admirably organized into analysis and synthesis. Five categories of statues of the queen emerge: seated, in Osiris-form, and on her knees (sub- divided into large and small); then standing; and three kinds of Sphinx. All these materials, now scattered throughout the world, came from that photo- genic Deir el-Bahri; but the rest of Egypt furnishes valuable parallels in sketches or texts. The temple complex at Deir el-Bahri is declared on p. ix to furnish "the most favorable conditions for study", presumably of parallels , since barely a tenth of the plates are drawn from there. Each separate chapter of "analysis" or detailed description with emphasis on inscriptions has its own "summary of controvertible points and step toward interpretation", among which we learn on p. 31 that this unisex queen, despite her beard and masculine pronouns, had also her feminine moments. Her representations as Sphinx are subdivided curiously according to the material (granite and sandstone) put in parallel with the style (wig, p. 128). Finally there are four syntheses: relative chronology; consistency of development; facial expressions; place in the larger 18th Dynasty framework. It is paradoxical that for the statues of a single person was used this satisfying organic structuring which never seems to have occurred to the two preceding authors struggling with much ampler masses of material. 4 Ghana University's excavation of Meroe 200 km. southeast of Khartoum (from 1969 to 1972, published by the East-Berlin Humboldt University) is presented first in the sequence of its modern history, with a series of "episodes" but also abundant plans of strata and masonry. The rest of the book is under- standably devoted to the Pottery and the Small Finds. There are appendices on Garstang's Nachlass, Fauna by P. Carter and R. Foley, and some twenty Carbon- 14 samplings. Though there is a handy summary of strata on p. 96, that chapter and the others just dribble off, with no semblance of synthesis, 3 Roland Tefnin, La statuaire ď Hatshepsout.

Though the text is phototyped, the 46 bound-in photos are of high quality, and there is a folder of seven loose plans inviting library-users to the snatch. 5 Vila's survey of Nubia south of the Dal Cataract, on which we reported with appropriate succinctness in Or 47 (1948) 119, has now reached a fascicle of "Recapitulations, conclusions, and appendices" (No. 11), but it is largely mathematical-type graphs, and the scant three-page "Conclusions" are frankly "reflections" on how needed this conservation-effort was, and how the means used corresponded to the end. The series then takes a new lease on life with a fascicle 12 on the "Napatean" burials of Missiminia, some containing colorful jewels pleasingly illustrated. The description is orderly and satisfying: geo- graphical environment, funerary structures, inhumation, attributes, chronology. 6 The Danish excavators of Sukas south of Ugarit were perplexed and discouraged when no Phoenician or even Greek burials emerged on the tell, but chance finds along the Mediterranean coast induced them to transfer operations there. They were rewarded with the discovery of ample Phoe- nician interments from as early as the 7th century, and also a Late-Greek and Neo-Phoenician sanctuary. These finds are methodically described and illustrated by the chief excavator himself, with fairly ample interpretation relative to the deities Herakles-Melqart and Aphrodite- Aštart, and with minimal hints to key these finds into the general chronology of the site. 7 The city museum in Frankfurt possesses three Palmyra busts, and their background has now been illustrated by a survey of the desert-site and its other monuments and earlier visitors. Though the information is adequate and even impressive, it is printed rather densely and with artful concealment of publication-details which harried researchers are usually happy to discover on the front page. 8 Egyptian influence on Phoenician architecture was chosen by Peter Wagner foi a doctoral dissertation under K. Parlasca in 1980, presumably at Bonn. The materials are all subdivided surprisingly into "Sacral Archi- tecture" and "Pyramid-mausoleums". These same Leitmotivs, but with much more detailed subdivisions, govern the ensuing effort to discover and clarify 6 André Vii^a, La prospection archéologique de la vallée du Nil, au Sud de la cataracte de Dal (Nubie Soudanaise).

North the Egyptian sources of the art. Localization of the monuments seems to be of little interest; there is no list of places apart from the general index; the most conspicuous "pyramid-mausoleums" mentioned around p. 90 are in Jerusalem ! - Page 179 will say (but not why) 'By Phoenician is meant all Palestine too' though p. 169, 172, 174 distinguish "phönikisch und israelitisch" ("syrisch" scarcely seems to occur; the reference for Amrit p. 94 should be to Plate 7 or 15, not 1). There is a premature but appreciated Ergebnis on p. 177-9, whereas the final pages of the text are katalogartig. This is certainly a research which was worth doing. 9 Fanning out again from Syria but beyond its northerly border, Heinz Genge chose for his Aarhus 1976 Habilitationsschrift the dating and analysis of Anatolian reliefs. He had already done in 1964 a Freiburg dissertation on Assyrian royal stelae. His present volume warns us from the start that this work originally had the word "Syndrome" in the title (dropped by sugges- tion of some English co- jury man), and this opening notice seems to imply that we will be able to satisfy our curiosity about the full ' syndrome ' -title under the abbreviation NSR/DuB or anyway somewhere in the bibliography. Alas, no. But on p. 47 we read, "The Syndrome of the [Sam'al-] Relief was obvious for everyone since the publication of the Terqa stele in 1952; and yet it has been 'discovered' (erblickt) in the sense of Max J. Friedländer only now, some twenty years later. And that gives food for thought! It is my opinion that Angewandte Symptomatik (? knowledge of seizure-symptoms) is not only to be practiced, as here, but also to be taught". It begins to seem that what- ever archeology or chronology or art we derive from this work will come through a medical filter. Nevertheless (or therefore, really) the materials are logically organized: first a general survey of the 10th-8th century background, then the "symptomatische Einordnung" of the Sam'al stela and an Aleppo "Laparla- stela"; then the "(now) stilistische Einordnung" of the Carchemish Katuwa relief, the "Umdatierung" of the Mara§ stelas; then more clarity on Halaf, Sam'al, and Carchemish; and finally a whole concluding chapter, "Angewandte Symptomatik". The German summary on p. 187 defines "symptom" as "transitory characteristics" but fears that the reader will learn more from the two-page Danish tabular summation p. 192-3. The separate volume of Notes and Plates begins with a very helpful list of what the 124 stelas show, maiden, hunt, Adad, hoplite, dame and youth. No researcher into North-Syrian art will ever be safe without the medical certificate constituted by the under- standing of this book. 10 A Rome dissertation under Mario Liverani and Paolo Matthiae surveys the Early Bronze urbanization of Palestine. In a rapid survey of recent rel- evant studies, attention is rightly focused on the controversies about where to begin and end EB.

Then a fifty-page synthesis treats "urban structure" and the architectural types: military, sacred, public, private. The conclusion of p. 185: "With EB 1 appear large fortified cities throughout Palestine ... in close relation to changing social structures; . . . three factors are fundamental: exploitation of the terrain, trafficking, and defense". The terrain involves not only "urban-fortified", but also remote-rural and autonomous-pastoral areas (p. 191). Examples of the various types are then detailed, and on p. 204 are diagrammed "dia- chronic" developments, i.e. the North and Center had more in EB 1 than in EB 2-3, but in the South the situation was reversed. 128 pages are then devoted to an alphabetical catalog of all the sites, but there is no (other) index. 11 We should call attention here to the important study of Magnus Ottos- son on the nature and forms of sanctuaries revealed by excavation in Palestine, on which our review has appeared in Biblica 64 (1983) 127-128. 12 Also important for archeological attestation of early religious practice is the massive volume of Leila Badre treating the terracotta figurines only of EB Syria. Instead of beginning with the objects themselves and the place and manner of their discovery (which are amply detailed in the catalog at the end, pp. 159-407, in the order Orontes-Euphrates-Coast, followed by "computerized data", gestion du fichier sur ordinateur ), she begins with the technology and procedures by which the objects were produced, proceeding then to the sites. At this point is inserted a "commentary on the catalog", with its conclusions p. 122. Masculine figurines, apart from sex-organs and beard, are recognizable to some extent by the hair-styling. This is true also of the female figurines, which moreover give prominence to the navel and folded arms, while the pubic triangle is noticeably limited to the "classic" Orontes and Mari types. Local variants such as the rounded thorax are also interestingly analyzed. There- upon the thirty-page chapter called "Comparative Study" deals rather with art-history parallels from inside and outside Syria, comparing also known figures in bronze, stone, and ivory, or represented on cylinder-seals. Little can be said about the "significance" of the anthropomorphic figures (p. 155); sadly, the data on where they came from are very inadequate (some few from sanctuaries and even fewer from tombs). Pritchard and Caquot perhaps unwarrantably assume that the female figurines are to be presumed goddesses until the contrary is proved; Woolley in more secular vein is rather alone in his sensible suggestion that they are just toys; Badre seems to range herself in the midway group for whom the figurines are somehow magical, fetishes, ex-votos, or replacement of a presumed-earlier usage of sending the wife to the tomb with her husband (Äström). 11 Magnus OTTOSSON, Temples and Cult Places in Palestine.

Basically it was a 1978 Zurich symposium, to which was added the chapter which was put in first place and will doubtless be of greatest interest to the reader, a translation of Giovanni Pettinato's communication to the Italian Biblical Association on "Polytheism and Henotheism in the religion of Ebla", with rather brief emphasis on "the problem of II and Ya". Keel's own presentation of the book, citing heavily from F. Dürrenmatt and G. Steiner, emphasizes how difficult or impossible it is for us today to grasp "polytheism" in a purely descriptive way without value- judgments ("there is no such thing"), and indeed he seems right in saying that this is simply not one of the options which are open to the man of today; faddists believe in all sorts of gods and atheisms, but not in several gods. The chapter "Monotheism in Mesopotamia" adds a question-mark to this title; and Benedikt Hartmann from a number of cited hymns and cylinder- seal representations concludes that there was no monotheism at all, only the variants of polytheism which are called "henolatry" or "henotheism". In pharaonic Egypt, however, according to Krik Hornung, Akhenaten represents a real revolution, with some vague influence inside later Egypt but not in Asia. The chapter by Hans-Peter Müller is called "God and the gods in the begin- nings of biblical religion; the prehistory of monotheism"; I find it surprising that among his many sound observations he found no place for the pioneering insights of F. Kortleitner (the genuinely biblical view "our god is greater than all the other gods"). 14 A beautiful and eminently utilizable little volume subsidized by Dr. Norman P. Schenker gives the 136 seals of his collection and some others. Most had been purchased, of dubious provenance; only a few were found stratified in excavations. Here are the important subdivisions (not announced by a table of contents), each with its little preface: p. 11 officials (including any and all males!); p. 43 women; then (each also with its alphabet-chart), p. 53 Hebrew; 121 Ammonite, 141 Moabite, 149 Phoenician, 165 Aramaic. In spite of the charm and value for art-lovers and archeologists, the chief usefulness will doubtless be for philologists, and they will regret that the abundant data have not been summarized in any indices of Semitic words, recurrent themes, or provenances. There is only an index of names occurring on the seals, none of the numerous modern researches cited. The absence of a Scripture index can be borne more cheerfully, since such citations are infrequent and mostly for the less common biblical names. Altogether a momentous contribution to prosopography. 13 Othmar Keei, (Hg.), Monotheismus im Alten Israel und seiner Umwelt. Mit Beiträgen von B. Hartmann, E. Hornung, H.-P. Müller, G.

There are prefatory surveys by L. I. Lavine and A. Kloner; and then as a class apart are treated the three "Second-Temple Period Synagogues": Masada by Y. Yadin, and also by G. Foerster in comparison with Herodium; Gamia by S. Gutman and also in a wider purview by Z. Ma'oz. After that the order is geographical. First come Capernaum and the other important synagogues of Galilee, preceded by essays of synthesis (N. Avigad, G. Foerster, E. Netzer). Four synagogues of the Beth-Shan area are treated apart, then those of Golan compendiously. There are only four from Judah. The last chapter (after eight essays on "Inscriptions and Small Finds") gives "The Synagogues of the Diaspora": several combined in an article by Foerster, then Dura-Europos, Sardis, Corinth; and finally M. Avi-Yonah's musings about the mosaics of Mopsuestia. The Index has several mentions of Beth- Shearim, but it is not easy to discover whether the "synagogue" formerly pointed out there really exists or not; and in general the table of contents would seem to hint that all the synagogues treated are mentioned there, which is not the case. The quality of illustration is excellent. 16 A small volume, number 4 of the reprints from Tel Aviv Journal (of Archaeology) describes the 1977 excavations at Tell Michal four miles north of the Yarqon. Different experts treat the excavation, the geology, the scarab- flint-coin finds, and a coastal survey. The Persian period is prominent in the descriptions (stratigraphie summary p. 28: MB 2, LB, Iron, Persian, Hellenistic-Roman). Herzliya municipality intends to make the site into a park. 17 A really gorgeous volume of "Judean Desert Studies" is appropriately entitled "The Cave of the Treasure"; it illustrates the finds from Nahal Mishmar. Though Pessah Bar-Adon is solely responsible for the 200 pages of text (three seasons of excavation described; chalcolithic finds taking up almost the whole of the book, with a few pages on the Bar Kokhba period), there are five appen- dices by other experts on flora, fauna, textiles, metals. The discoveries have already been so widely publicized and accessible in museums that the only thing left for us to say is: the opulence of the publication surpasses (were't possible) the finds themselves. 18 One of Paolo Matthiae's earliest presentations of the sensational Ebla finds (1976, translated by Frances Pinnock) is made available in the series 15 Lee I.

It is amply illustrated. Another in the series gives the sixth preliminary report on the Syrian site of Terqa (third season, with extension of the work to Qraya and Khana) 19. 20 Not all (as the title would seem to suggest) but only four "North- Mesopotamian Ruins" are newly described, and they are all in Turkey. Hisar- kaya fort is forty miles north of Mardin and formed part of Justinian's defenses. Less clear is the possibility of ascribing to Justinian the Rabbe fort in the Mardin foothills. In roughly the same area apparently are the churches of Ambar and Dēr Matīna of around the sixth century. Among the 56 exquisite photographs, sixteen are in color, very evocative. 21 An imposing international conference edited by Marie-Thérèse Barrelet for the Centre National de Recherche Scientifique gives a score of essays toward emphasizing the anthropological aspects of Mesopotamian archeology, with recurrent terms like ethnoarcheology, ethnography, and ecology. The culture- atmosphere is well illustrated by the title chosen by the editor for her brief little essay on how pottery was produced (p. 55-8), "Artisan ate in clay: example of the dialogue between archeology and ethnology", and the same identical title with only the last two terms reversed (surely not without depth-psychology implications) was chosen by Hélène B alf et, p. 71-84. "Risks and hopes" similarly dominate the title of Francis Hours, p. 23-40; while "Ecological Anthropological and Documentary Interplay" at Nippur entices M. Gibson p. 193-205. Hopefully less on the frontier between dreams and poetry is Carol Kramer's "Estimating prehistoric populations" p. 315-334, with several adjacent articles on land-use and demographic pressure. There are also several routine excavation-reports, largely on Oman, Qatar, and Baluchistan; and survey-titles more informative for the archeologist, like J. N. Postgate's "Palm- trees, Reeds and Rushes in Iraq ancient and modern" p. 99-113, J.-Iy. Huot's "Goldsmith's Trade at Larsa" 113-8, and G. A.

Difficulties of pictorial transmission and of (personal versus official; chronolog- ical, local) functioning of the seals are treated, and more briefly workshops and relation to written information.

A bit snakier than we would have expected, but a very informative exposition. 23 Leonard Woolley's Ur excavation between 1922 and 1934 provides most of the beads whose detailed analysis is offered as a step toward establishing the trade-relations between Mesopotamia and sites near Mohenjo-Daro. It will be useful as the reference-catalogue for which it was intended. 24 Sylvia Matheson's attractive little archeological-tourist guide to Persia, diffused in English at the unluckiest possible time during the feud with Kho- meini, is now available in a German edition which hopefully will be put to use. The special German preface begins, "There are a quarter of a million archeo- logical find-sites in Iran, a thousand around Persepolis alone". . . and she has visited them all (with a few exceptions, and presumably meaning all mentioned in this book) . A summary history of only six pages is followed by six more of recurrent names in alphabetical order with explanation. The first chapter is de- voted to Teheran, for which 37 pages suffice since it is a quite modern city. Then come: the Caspian; Azarbaijan, Kurdistan; Kirmanshah with special attention to Bisitun and Taq-i Bustan; Luristan without much data on the now-dispersed Bronzes. The southwest area around Susa will be of special interest, not only because of the oil-fields and the Iraqi nvasion. Then comes Central Iran with Qum and Isfahan and Tepe Siyalk; but the northeast desert is expedited before the two key chapters on Fars. The plans and photos seem ideally suited to orient the tourist at the focal points of his interest, Persepolis, Pasar- gadae, and Naqš-i Rustam.

The descriptions are austerely sober but logical and usable. 26 Of the full dozen new SIMA volumes we have in hand to present, the biggest and most important gets to the bottom of the pretty little Yahudiyah juglets which rivet the land of Goshen to northern Syria during the Hyksos period. The 500-some illustrations show mostly the varying types of delicate white pinpointed band-designs, but imagination runs riot in the fish-shaped and lotos-decorated samples of Plates 125-131 whose existence most of us had never suspected. Several maps show the distribution of origin, and there is a long catalogue of known present whereabouts. The text itself is not exactly attrac- tive as to either content or typography; but from it you can dig out the Typo- logical, Geographical, Neutron Activation, and Chronological analyses, plus Conclusions. It turns out that there were two main production-centers, si- multaneous and not successive or transferred (other ateliers in Nubia and Ugarit are possible but small-scale). It is maintained as a steely certitude that the form of the vessels is "levantine" (Greater Syria), and that though the unique decorative technique is "unthinkable" for Egypt, still the ware as a whole was first produced there, in MB-2a. Surely a very valuable conclusion for the whole of Middle Bast archeology. 27 Fingerprints and Archaeology is the titillating title of a small volume which Editor Aström co-authored. It does not deal with detective-methods, as we might expect, but only illustrates and analyzes the "papillary patterns" which can be "lifted" from ancient jars; but surely some police-department will find use for the "Inventory of Ancient Fingerprints" p. 24-86, richly illustrated as far as the jars are concerned, though it takes some loyal good will to detect the whorls. 28 Ultrascientific methodology appears more clearly in Fischer's long title than in his detailed bilingual contents: (i) Eine Untersuchung der Kieferfrag- mente und Zähne aus zwei Gräbern von Trypes bei Dromolaxia, Zypern; (ii) The Jaws and Teeth of a I,ate Bronze Age Skeleton from Hala Sultan Tekke, Cyprus; (iii) Resistivity Measurements at Hala; (iv) The Use of a Metal Detector in Archaeology; (v) Geophysical prospecting at Hala. There is no real summary of the uses to which the book may be put. We may here add two further SIMA volumes on Hala Sultan Tekke (presented by us in Orientalia 51 [1982]); one treats an excavated area29. The other deals with a sherd- deposit 30. 26 Maureen F.

It notes the sites, the settlements, tombs, pottery, and other artefacts; and concludes that settlement was tenacious though threatened by invasions and catastrophes. These Myceneans were not just potters, but top-notch bronze-workers, farmers, shepherds, fishermen, and adventurous traders (p. 183). 32 Mostly the less-known sites all over Crete furnish to Kanta his con- clusions about the supremacy of Knossos and Linear B; the destruction of Knossos (1390-1375); architecture, religion, laws; tombs, art, cremation, disas- ters. Through Late Minoan III, Crete remained a major force in the whole Aegean world. Also from Crete is the Vasilike ware treated in a briefer volume 33 . 34 A study of stone anchors from Byblos, Ugarit, Crete, Egypt, and Cyprus furnishes conclusions on coastal settlements and trade-routes during the time of Moses. 35 One volume of a rather massive onomasticon gives us all known sites of the Greek mainland and islands, going so far as to estimate the size of each settlement. Another slim fascicule of the Cyprus Antiquities corpus has also appeared 36 . Bone, stone, and obsidian objects of prehistoric central Anatolia are usefully catalogued 37 . 38 The final SIMA volume deals with archeological finds at Maroni, on the south coast of Cyprus; Edith Porada contributes the analysis of the seals from Studies in Mediterranean Archaeology, Vol. XLV:6.

The general conclusion is that a long duration, from the neolithic to the medieval, was surprisingly but totally interrupted during Middle Cypriote. 39 In the Pocket-Book form, showing on the cover one of his ancient whorls, under the title Archeological Detective-Work, Aström gives in Swedish (with brief English summaries) some of his above data about pottery-finger- prints and some excavations of the SIMA series, but also "A new reconstruc- tion of the Laocoon group". In the same format is an English-language illustrated guide to Delphi and Olympia40. An imposing report on the ex- cavation of Castulo III in Spain will no doubt be of some interest to Phoenician and other Mediterranean researchers41. 42 We conclude our survey with Betancourt's elegant and urgently-needed volume on the architectural development which has been called "the Aeolic style" as the Canaanite direct progenitor of the perennially-dominant "Dorian, Ionian, and Corinthian capitals". In "The Bronze Age background" are noted only some decorative floral capitals recalling the Egyptian lotos. But the main chapter is almost entirely on Palestine, 15 sites of the biblical period 1000-500 B.c. The following development is noted: first an early series from Megiddo; then others from Megiddo contemporary to all in Samaria; then Hazor and Shechem; finally Jerusalem, Ramat Rahel, and Medeibîyeh. The Halicarnassus peninsula about 600 b.c. furnishes some examples, probably newly-imported from East Greece. The examples shown from Ionia tend rather strongly toward the more familiar Ionic design; p. 118 fortunately brings up the slight but intriguing resemblance to the Persepolis Janus-horse capitals. The concluding chapter deals with great circumspection on the possibility or nature of the influence of the Aeolic on the Ionic and eventually Corinthian capitals. This book provides materials and viewpoints sure to evoke wide resonance in many areas of Mid-East study.
