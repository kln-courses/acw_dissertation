      <p>Before there were scientists, there were <italic>savants.</italic> Over 140 of them, mostly noblemen and gentlemen, ranging from engineers to botanists, and ignorant of their destination and their projected time away from home, were pressed into service to accompany Napoleon on his invasion of Egypt in 1798. They drew and excavated tombs; surveyed monuments, mountains, faunas, and floras; learned the native languages, customs, and instruments; and, on returning to France with their magnificent collections, started a wave of Egyptomania that has never left Europe and America. Such was the spirit of <italic>post-ancien regime</italic> France.</p>
      <p>Georges-Louis Leclerc (1707–1788), later comte de Buffon, was also a savant, but of an earlier period of the Enlightenment, in a France given less to colonialism and more to scholarly reflection and activity. Dead 10 years before Napoleon's voyage and a year before the Terror forever changed the face of France, Buffon embodied the spirit of inquiry of the eighteenth century. In an age of idiosyncratic genius, he was as unusual as any, and certainly as accomplished. In this brilliant biography, the late Jacques Roger restores Buffon's glory from centuries of misunderstanding and misrepresentation. Even as he coolly appraises Buffon's faults and excesses, he shows us the brilliance, the range, and the motivation of the man.</p>
      <p>Buffon had an extravagant personality that was larger than life. Known for his learning, style, industry, and administrative ability, he was basically a country man who served in the local <italic>parlement</italic> and rose through his scientific works and financial acuity to become one of the leading scientists of his century (and, in the process, a count, for which honor the King created a new county). Buff on never actually left the country, because he was never fully comfortable in Paris, away from his lands, duties, and experiments in Montbard, Burgundy. Although he headed the Jardin du Roi in Paris for many years, he spent half of each of those years in the country, from which he disposed and instructed the staff by mail.</p>
      <p>Buffon's country sensibilities perhaps explain why, in an age of <italic>philosophes</italic> such as Voltaire and Rousseau, he was a pragmatist. His science proceeded not from the first principles of logic but from generalizations based on reasoning from empirical facts. That reasoning was often turned against naivete, whether from fellow scientists, revered academicians, honored philosophers, or complacent clerics. Buffon described natural history like his contemporaries did, but whereas they focused on intimate details, he focused on integrating ideas. His sweep of natural history ranged from the traditional life sciences of anatomy, taxonomy, classification, and biogeography to considerations of anthropology and the “generation of animals” (fertilization and reproduction) and even to the formation and history of the planets (especially the earth), celestial mechanics, and metallurgy. It is little known that Buffon's first scientific efforts were in geometry and that through most of his life he carried out long-term experiments on the strength of wood in his forests at Montbard.</p>
      <p>The centerpiece of Buffon's work is the 36–volume <italic>Natural History (Histoire naturelle, generate et particuliere),</italic> which appeared in installments and supplements from 1749 until his death. Much of the series is what we think of as a traditional “natural history,” filled with long descriptions and anecdotes, romantic and even sentimental and anthropomorphic in parts, and also with the lore of the travelogue that informed and instructed his readers. But as the breadth of his topics indicates, the subjects were not just natural history as we think of it today. That is, it was equally “natural” to consider questions of the Noachian Flood, the soul, and the evolution of intelligence—all very real issues to the eighteenth-century mind. Buffon's work was accessible to the educated public, and this accessibility (as Roger observes is no less true for scientists today) brought invidious criticisms from his fellow academicians. Probably in part because he spent so much time away from Paris at his country estate, it became fashionable and easy in some Parisian circles to criticize Buffon as more a stylist than a serious scientist. Roger shows how unjustified this criticism was, even though it has persisted in and outside France ever since.</p>
      <p>Buffon's <italic>Natural History</italic> consists primarily of well-digested, synthesized scientific descriptions filtered from the reports of travelers all over the world, as well as his own observations and experiments. From all of this, Buffon developed his ideas and theories. If hindsight is any judge, the editorial filter of the vast literature he reviewed was shrewd and reliable. Yet Buffon seldom responded to criticisms and avoided most professional entanglements, preferring instead to concentrate on his great output and his administrative duties. Besides, his books sold well, and that was perhaps his best revenge; his accomplishments and public favor were his strongest allies in Parisian politics as he gradually built his scientific empire in the Jardin du Roi (there was no yearly budget except what he could wheedle out of the King). As Roger explains (p. xvi), “his realism permitted him to take advantage of the political situation of France under Louis XV to feed his ambition, to be his own master and to depend on no one.” The creation of the Jardin itself allowed this independence; Roger wryly notes that it was an early step in “a tradition of French administration, which still endures: every time the government deems that the university has refused to adapt itself to the requirements of new scientific theories, it creates a new institution” (p. 47).</p>

      <p>For me, the most illuminating parts of the book concerning Buffon's science were those on taxonomy and the recognition of species. Roger shows how in Buffon's day, taxonomists were either observers of the minute details of the anatomy and behavior of their organisms (especially insects) or classifiers bent on determining the plan of Nature. Both groups were structuralists, but the former were inclined to explanations of form and function that extolled Divine design (natural theology), whereas the latter looked more toward secondary mechanisms of natural processes. Buffon was squarely in the latter camp. In a courageous although not unique stand, he rejected the system of Linnaeus as arbitrary because it relied on single parts or features to discriminate groups, and he mocked Linnaeus's concept of the Quadrumana, which would group sloths with scaly lizards and humans. Buffon felt that it was useless to look for inviolable consistency and for “final causes” in the distributions of features: “Why does one want each part to be useful to the others and necessary to the whole in each individual? Is it not enough that, placed together, they do not harm each other?” (p. 292).</p>
      <p>Although it is fruitless to try to make a twentieth-century thinker of Buffon (for example, he accepted the principle of plenitude and thought that variation in populations was a sort of Aristotelian degeneration from an ideal type), he did, nevertheless, have some concept of variation within a type, and he joined the naturalist John Ray in insisting that organisms of the same species should be recognized by their capacity to interbreed. Linnaeus was perhaps glad in retrospect that in 1748, a year before Buffon's first tirade against the “nomenclators” appeared, he had named a particularly foul smelling plant <italic>Buffonia.</italic>
      </p>
      <p>Part of the reason for Buffon's opposition to Linnaeus can be traced to his pragmatism. “Let us gather facts to give us ideas,” he is famous for having said. For Buffon, generalizations had to follow observations and be corrected by them. He saw grand schemes based on pure deduction, including mathematical equations, as fatuous: “everyone believes that he knows more because the number of symbolic expressions and scholarly phrases has been increased, and no one cares that all these arts are no more than scaffolding for the sciences, and not science itself” (pp. 85–86). Mathematics was tautology, and therefore useless to practical considerations of Nature. Roger shows how the early 1700s were dominated by a mechanistic, geometric philosophy that all Nature could be reduced to laws of motion; by mid-century, however, this purely deductive and therefore sterile view was replaced by a sense of curiosity about foreign lands and peoples and of natural history in general. This curiosity in turn encouraged the flourishing of descriptive accounts and inductive reasoning about principles and patterns of Nature. Pure reason ceded pride of place to experience and induction, a shift that perfectly suited the temperament of Buffon, who was able to move in both spheres.</p>
      <p>Roger's biography is magisterial, exhilarating, knowing, historiographically rich, and subtle in its arguments. This is a wonderful book for discovering the theoretical and practical problems that confronted eighteenth-century science, especially, but not at all exclusively in France, as seen through the experience of a polymath whose like, although perhaps less uncommon in the Age of Enlightenment, was still unusual for his time and virtually inconceivable today. The translation, by Sarah L. Bonnefoi, is elegant, graceful, and seamless—a model of intelligent conveyance of ideas and style—augmented by helpful notes from series editor L. Pearce Williams. Read this book not only to understand the life and contributions of a man maligned by his contemporaries and misunderstood by posterity, but also to renew your faith in scientific biography, and to see just how well it can be done in the hands of a master.</p>
