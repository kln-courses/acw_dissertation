Ryan Rutgers University Taking his title from the bumper-sticker tidings "Jesus To transform Darwin from primary disenchanter to re Loves You," George Levine argues in Darwin Loves You that demptive re-enchanter, Levine needs to rescue him from the Darwin's celebration of a natural world with no religious sig- negative connotations of his name—to show "Darwinian" na nificance offers a credible, comforting, and politically benign ture as a realm of wonder and delight—and to dissociate him alternative to super-naturalist religion. He presents this Dar- from laissez-faire economics and the deterministic theories of winian gospel as an effective antidote to the intellectual "dis- sociobiology and evolutionary psychology. These he argues enchantment" that Max Weber found endemic in the are only marginal and unfortunate parts of the legacy, "Dar modern world, resulting from, among other cultural causes, win at his worst" (61). Levine does not deny that class the assault of scientific rationalism on traditional religious prejudices, gender stereotypes, and bourgeois domestic val beliefs. "Weber's narrative of disenchantment," Levine writes, ues are embedded in Darwin's language but argues persua "leaves only these options: either a value-laden world infused sively that his achievements "outstrip the cultural limits that with transcendental meaning, or an amoral world from allowed for their very production" (173). For Levine, Dar which all value is drained as it is subject to scientific investiga- win's anthropomorphic approach to nature, if at times it dis tion" (23). Building on this reduction of Weber's theory, and torted his perception, was a triumph of sympathetic challenging the common perception that Darwinism repre- imagination. His effort to detect human-like behavior in sents the ultimate in scientific disenchantment, he argues every organism became the source of some of his most origi that Darwin's "desanctifying" of nature, his rejection of the nal insights, most notably his theory of sexual selection, natural theology that had previously dominated scientific thinking, did not diminish his own enchantment with the Of particular interest to literary scholars is Levine's natural world and should not have a dispiriting effect on analysis of the older Darwin's "anesthetic" distaste for poetry those who read his works with proper attention. Levine sees and the other arts. Levine suggests that Darwin deliberately in Darwin's writings "an act of loving engagement with the repudiated poetry because it was not only unscientific but dis natural world that allows and fosters, even without gods and honest, a distortion of reality. Poetry like Wordsworth's is in traditional forms of consolation, enchantment" (26), compatible with scientific materialism, resembling natural theology in its effort to impose moral meaning on nature and offer specious comfort for human sufferings that are finally 190</page><page sequence="2">inconsolable: "The facts are not consonant either with poetry emotional part of our nature." For Darwin, then, the loss of a or religion, and it is positively immoral to lean on untruths to taste for poetry indicated a moral deficiency, not a moral evade or deny the pain of life in the interests of either aes- victory, thetic or spiritual pleasure" (167). In this connection, Levine isn't sure whether Wordsworth, whom Darwin had once read with great pleasure, was a positive or negative influence. Dar- The primary inspiration for this book seems to be the win's insistence that "the wonders of the world are all the personal joy Levine has found in nature, coupled with indig products of the ordinary" shows that "Wordsworth remains nation at the role evangelical religion has been playing in alive and well in the very texture of Darwin's gradualist mate- American politics.

"I want primarily to and yet philosophers as different as Theodor Adorno and argue for the cultural, spiritual, and ethical value of seeing Jacques Maritain have argued that the arts are among the few the world with Darwinian eyes" (8).
