<plain_text><page sequence="1">Extrême-Orient, Extrême-Occident 21 - 1999 Divination : traditions and controversies, Chinese and Greek Geoffrey Lloyd The ambition to foresee the future is as strong and as widespread today as it has ever been. Nowadays, however, if figures in the public eye, a politician's wife such as Nancy Reagan, a football manager such as Glenn Hoddle, are caught consorting with astrologers or mediums, they are lambasted in the popular press, even though the very same newspapers are happy enough to indulge their readers with regular features on what is « in their stars ». Prediction certainly has its disreputable side. Yet no one derides it in one of its modes. Successful prediction is a feature that we all recognise in science, where it is sometimes held to be one of its defining characteristics. In the positivist historiography of science, which was where the history of science began, the frontier between legitimate, and deluded, ambitions to predict had to be firmly policed. The so-called pseudo-sciences were an occasion of mere embarrassment. Most attempts to see into the future, or to discover the hidden secrets of the present or the past, had to be dismissed as essentially deluded. Astrology, physiognomy, later phrenology, were no part of the agenda, even though they might be exemplified not just in the same periods, but in the very same authors, as those that were deemed to be central to the story of the upward march of science. A second phase in the study of divination in particular began when its rationality came to be recognised. In the debates on the irrational that were common in psychology, philosophy and anthropology from the 1950s on, it was remarked that techniques of divination have their own internal coherence and obey certain rules, and on that score and by that criterion do not fail to be rational l. It was further recognised that acquiring special knowledge was not the only function of practices of divination, nor, in certain circumstances, is it the most important one. Comparative anthropological studies have shown that sometimes, when a particularly tricky decision has to be taken, and it might be invidious for an individual to be solely responsible for it, an impersonal mode of divination may be used as the basis for a consensual verdict as to what to do 2. In which direction should the hunting party set out ? Divination can resolve the issue without implicating any individual with</page><page sequence="2">Geoffrey Lloyd blame for failure, and such a procedure may also have the effect of introducing a random element in the courses of action pursued. Again when Big Men or rulers have to be advised, the context of discussion of what the signs foretell may provide a framework for that to happen without any of the parties to the advice being in danger of losing face. On the surface, the talk is of how to interpret the omens and what they hold for the future : but what is primarily at issue is deciding what to do. Discussion of what the signs mean will enable different views about what should be done to be expressed. The contexts in which divination may be attempted are as varied as the types of practice adopted. At one end of the spectrum, a private individual may attempt some prediction purely for his or her own private purposes - with or without the approval or consent of state authorities. At the other, there are ritualised, institutionalised occasions when those in charge may be high functionaries of state, or even the ruler in person. In such circumstances, a challenge to the prediction could hardly fail to be construed as a challenge to the state authorities themselves. When the knowledge claimed for divination concerns the future, that holds out the promise of influencing it - a prospect that those authorities could scarcely ignore. The legitimacy or otherwise of the practices were not just matters of the rationality of aims and methods, for issues of state control, or its subversion, might well be at stake. These general remarks serve to identify some of the questions that a study of divination in ancient cultures may tackle. Greece and China are among those cultures where we can investigate not just the variety of modes of divination and the relations between them, but also what happens as they come to be subject to learned elaboration and to self-conscious reflection 3. I shall focus here on those aspects of those interrelations and elaborations that concern the legitimacy of procedures, their comparative prestige and status, and the challenges to which they were liable. Since challenge, in this case, may presuppose diversity, it is as well to begin by taking note of the wide variety of different modes, and roles, of Chinese divination that the studies in this number have brought to light. Two of the best known techniques, based on the interpretation of the cracks of fired turtle shells or on that of the hexagrams formed by combinations of broken or unbroken lines derived from sorting sticks of milfoil or yarrow, illustrate, on the one hand, the importance of divination, from earliest times, for state concerns, and on the other, the potentiality for elaboration and development. In the turtle shell inscriptions, dating from the 12th century on from Anyang, the divinations relate primarily to the fortunes and affairs of kings, military expeditions, hunts, births, tribute, the construction of towns 4. No higher legitimation could be imagined than that conferred on these practices by the direct involvement of the ruler himself, often imagined as communicating, by this means, with his dead ancestors (though cf. Djamouri). Then the Yijing, which with its commentaries must rank as the most popular divination text ever, numbering, as is well known, even Jung among its enthusiastic admirers, provided not just a handbook for predictions, but also a guide to the understanding of the world in general, and of the human condition in 156</page><page sequence="3">Divination : traditions and controversies, Chinese and Greek particular. Yet on one reading of that text, that of the Xici for instance 5, to get the most out of its elliptical and allusive character required the highest linguistic, literary and philosophical skills. I note in passing that Yang Xiong's variant, based on 81 tetragrams rather than 64 hexagrams, in the Tai xuan jing , aimed to make explicit what could only be derived from the Yijing itself by what Sivin has called « heroic feats of hermeneutics » 6. Yet as one contributor after another points out in these studies, the range of significance of divinatory discourse stretches well beyond issues to do with foretelling the future. Indeed both the practices and the modes of discourse associated with divination provided models whose repercussions can be detected in a wide variety of intellectual activities. Henderson explores the parallels with Confucian exegesis. Those with the law, both with the commentary tradition there and with discussion of the problems posed by the application of the general rule to the particular case, are pointed out by Bourgon and by Csikszentmihalyi. Again the introduction of predictions may, as Kalino wski remarks, serve narrative functions, as when the reader of such a text as the Zuozhuan is given advanced indication of the unfolding of events. Repeatedly, in that context as in many others, the conduct of a divination carries moral significance, whether conveying particular judgements concerning the character of the diviner or general lessons to do with the consequences of good or bad behaviour. Kalinowski's study further opens up fruitful fields of reflection on the relations between divination and early Chinese historiography - not least for the suggestions it may provide on the thorny, but fundamental, question of what precisely we may mean by « historiography » in the early Chinese context. Djamouri, meanwhile, focuses on the relationships between the development of divination and the development of writing itself. The variety of agents responsible for divinations, ranging from the kings themselves to a diversity of marginal, suspect, potentially subversive, types, opens up the possibility of rivalry and of the critical evaluation of claims to legitimacy. But before I comment on those aspects of the Chinese experience, I should first introduce some of the relevant comparative Greek materials. Although our Greek evidence cannot claim the antiquity of the Anyang oracle bones, a number of different modes of prediction is attested at least from Homer onwards. Animal sacrifices were made and the victims' entrails (liver, gall-bladder and so on) were inspected for any sign that might be thought ominous. The flights of birds were similarly scrutinised. Dreams, or at least some of them, were, as in China, thought to be significant for the dreamer or for others - one area where elaborate Greek theories came to be developed for their interpretation, as we can see from Artemidorus in the second century CE. Particular Greek sites, such as Delphi and Dodona, often independent of the centres of political power, had oracles that acquired reputations that extended beyond the borders of individual states. The reactions to predictions in these and other modes that are ascribed to particular characters already in Homer vary from the awestruck to the sceptical. Thus when at 157</page><page sequence="4">Geoffrey Lloyd Iliad 12 200ff the seer Poly damas interprets a fight between an eagle and a snake that it has captured as an omen that the Trojans will be thwarted of victory, Hector rejects this with a famous outburst : « One omen is best : to defend one's country. » But that apparently fine expression of unconcern for the seer's prediction must be put into perspective. Hector, for his part, gains his confidence from the promises he says that he has had from Zeus. Besides in the event, of course, Polydamas turns out to be correct. Many of the seers, diviners, prophets, represented in early Greek literature are greeted, like Polydamas, with disbelief, suspicion, derision, contempt - where parallels in the reactions to the predictions offered by Chinese wu are not hard to find. Cassandra's fate is to foretell the future, but never to be believed. Teiresias, in Sophocles 'Oedipus Tyr annus, is accused of malice, envy, corruption 1 . The possibility of political intervention, influencing the predictions made, was recognised. The Delphic oracle, or at least the priestess or the interpreters of her pronouncements, could be suborned 8. Many assumed that when the outcome of a state sacrifice was reported as unfavourable, that was just an excuse for doing nothing - as was often the case when the Spartans refused to leave their own territory on the grounds that the omens were inauspicious. Yet the fact that individual seers were frequently accused of cheating, obfuscation, charlatanry, should certainly not be equated with any general Greek disbelief in the practice of divination as such. On the contrary, a number of texts imply that it was highly regarded. Solon, 1 53ff, mentions seer-craft alongside medicine and poetry as arts or skills under divine aegis. In Aeschylus 'Prometheus Vinctus 484ff, Prometheus includes divination ( mantike ), alongside medicine, navigation and metal-work, among the arts ( technai ) and resources (poroi ) that he bestowed as benefits on humans. Nor is it just in poetry that we find such a theme. In the Hippocratic treatise On Regimen , from the early fourth century BCE, when the arts and crafts ( technai ) are used to throw light, by analogy, on the human body, the first to be mentioned is divination ( mantike ) 9. But another Hippocratic work introduces us to another side to the picture. The author of On Regimen in Acute Diseases (ch. 3 Littré, II 238-244) does all he can to distance medicine, as he wants to practise it, from divination. He criticises his medical colleagues for their disagreements with one another. This gives the medical art a bad name among lay people, to the point where some might even say it resembles divination. Doctors disagreeing over diagnoses and treatments seem to be no better than seers quarrelling over the interpretations of the flight of birds or the signs to be found in the entrails of sacrificial victims. Similarly in the later Hippocratic work Prorrhetic the writer opens with an attack on the idea that « marvellous » and exact predictions are possible in medicine (Book II chhl-2, Littré IX 6-10). He says he will not engage in such « divinations » but will set out the reliable signs by which one can recognise which patients will recover and which die. On the one hand, he wants to dissociate himself from « marvellous », « super- human » predictions. On the other, he still insists one can use « reliable » signs. Who decides which are which ? Well, of course, he does himself. But it is notable that the 158</page><page sequence="5">Divination : traditions and controversies, Chinese and Greek epithets he uses to denigrate the predictions he disapproves of relate specifically to the work of diviners. Similar direct criticisms of common beliefs figure in Greek writers of many different kinds and are a particular feature of the polemics in which, from the late sixth or early fifth century BCE onwards, the proponents of new styles of inquiry advocated their, « naturalistic », approach to the phenomena over against what they now sometimes labelled the « superstitions » and « magic » of traditional ideas and practices. Thus the poet and philosopher Xenophanes undermines any belief that the personified Iris (the rainbow) is a messenger from the gods. « She whom people call Iris also is a cloud, purple and red and yellow to behold 10. » So what had been assumed to be a presage is a natural phenomenon, just as a whole Hippocratic treatise, On the Sacred Disease , was devoted to showing that that disease had a natural cause just like any other. Similarly Plutarch in his life of Pericles (ch. 6) recounts a story in which the philosopher Anaxagoras challenges the view of the soothsayer Lampón who had interpreted a monstrous, one-horned, ram, as an omen. Athens, according to Lampón, currently the scene of a power-struggle between Pericles and a rival (a general named Thucydides), would shortly be dominated by Pericles alone. To that, Anaxagoras 'riposte was to have the ram's head opened, to show that the deformity had a perfectly natural explanation. For that, Plutarch tells us, Anaxagoras won the people's admiration, even though - as Plutarch continues - when Lampón 's prediction turned out to be correct, he came to be the object of their admiration. The bid to establish what Aristotle was to call « natural philosophy » (phusiologia ) generally involved not just constructive, but also destructive, moves. On the one hand, naturalistic explanations - often, it must be said, pretty fanciful ones - were to be attempted for every kind of phenomenon, from rainbows, lightning, eclipses, to diseases, deformities and monsters. On the other hand, the forces that had been assumed to be at work in such phenomena, sending them as punishments, or at least as portents, to mortals, had to be dismissed as irrelevant. Nature itself could be, and often was, believed to be divine : but that left no room for the personal, wilful, interventions of individual gods, goddesses, « demons » ( daimones ) or whatever. Even though, as Csikszentmihalyi shows, there is a parallel move away from the view of the universe governed by anthropomorphic deities in Chinese thought, what came to replace it there was a conception of the justice of the cosmos that differs from the Greeks 'idea in one important respect, that, for those Greeks, the divine nature they postulated was rather matter for study and for admiration than any guarantor of justice in human affairs. If the ambitions of the « naturalists » were clear, the question of the limits of possible naturalistic inquiry remained, at points, highly disputed. In particular, the issue of what the study of the heavens could reasonably be expected to comprise came to be debated in ways that cannot be paralleled in China or in any other ancient society. It is true that the Greeks did not distinguish between what we call astronomy and astrology in those terms. Both the Latin terms astronomia and astrologia , and the Greek ones from which they were derived, were generally used interchangeably. However we do 159</page><page sequence="6">Geoffrey Lloyd find clear distinctions drawn between two different types of inquiry. Ptolemy, in the opening chapter of the Tetrabiblos , does so, for example, in terms of two kinds of prognosis or prediction. On the one hand there was prediction directed at foretelling events in the heavens themselves, the movements of the sun, moon and planets especially. The claim he makes in the Syntaxis is that this can yield irrefutable demonstrations, based on the methods of arithmetic and geometry. On the other hand there was a second mode of prediction, it too, in his view, legitimate, directed at predicting events on earth on the basis of the study of the heavens. That too used mathematics, in the casting of horoscopes. Yet it depended on traditional assumptions, concerning such matters as which planets, or their configurations, were beneficent or maleficent. They could not claim certainty, and so the inquiry as a whole was conjectural, even though potentially, he thought, of very great utility, since the prospect of foreknowledge it held out could be of great practical benefit as well as encouraging (he hoped) steadfastness and peace of mind in the face of what the future held. Neither the ancient Chinese, nor the Babylonians, nor, come to that, the Egyptians nor the Indians, saw any need to mark off one branch of the study of the heavens as the conjectural investigation of omens. It is true that the Chinese contrast between Ufa and tian wen separates a mainly computational inquiry (the regulation of the calendar, eclipse cycles, and so on) from the study of the « pattern of the heavens », essentially qualitative in character, but including cosmography as well as a variety of ominous phenomena. Yet that does not equate with a contrast between astronomy and astrology, nor does it correspond to an interest in differentiating between the epistemological statuses of the studies in question. It was just that kind of interest, namely in epistemology, that led to the Greek - and Roman - recognition of a contrast between different modes of prediction. But if we ask where that interest comes from, part of the answer lies in the preoccupation with foundational questions with which the attempt to set up « the inquiry into nature » was associated from the beginning. It was by undermining the entire basis of the supernaturalists'or magicians' claims to know that those new styles of inquiry hoped to establish their own independence and superiority. Yet as soon became clear in the philosophical tradition especially, claims to epistemological superiority were no more immune to challenge than the positions they sought to outdo. There was no stable Greek, or Roman, consensus on the status of those two modes of prediction that were clearly distinguished by Ptolemy. He certainly thought both studies have their place. But some considered astrology to be subversive, while others held it to be deluded. Cicero's De Divinatione rehearses, at considerable length, the arguments pro and contra on just that issue. Moreover we know of yet others who doubted or denied the validity not just of astrology but also of astronomical theorising itself. For the Epicureans, much of what passed as such was overly dogmatic and degenerated into myth ( Letter to Pythocles 87). For the Pyrrhonian sceptics, any inquiry that went beyond the phenomena and tried to determine the hidden causes or 160</page><page sequence="7">Divination : traditions and controversies, Chinese and Greek underlying reality of things was to be rejected, not on the grounds of a claim that such determination was impossible (for to claim that would be to fall into negative dogmatism) but rather on the argument that it was useless. The complications of Greek demarcation disputes, on the status of modes of prediction and on other scores, were not just a matter of ongoing epistemological polemics. There was sometimes a good deal more in common between the positions of rival groups than their overt rivalry allowed to appear. Medicine yields our richest materials on the theme. While some Hippocratic writers, as we have seen, were adamant that medicine was not to be confused with divination, certain common Hippocratic techniques of prognosis, and the claims made for prognostic ability itself, have more in common with traditional patterns of belief than we might expect. Dreams were the key indicator used in temple medicine, in the shrines of Asclepius for instance. The faithful passed the night in the shrine (that is they « incubated ») and their dreams were then interpreted as suggesting a remedy - or in certain cases, better still, the patients awake already cured. But dreams are also included among the signs the doctor should attend to in Epidemics book 1 11 , and On Regimen book IV is devoted to giving detailed guidelines for their interpretation, although there is this important difference, that dreams are now indicators of the physical condition of the body, not signs from god. Dreaming of a star falling towards the sea, for instance, is correlated with diseases of the bowels 12. The treatise entitled Prognosis specifies the signs the doctor should use in arriving at his diagnosis, including the famous Hippocratic facies (. Prognosis ch 2) and the inferences to be drawn from the examination of the excreta, stools, urine, sputa, vomit. Yet in setting out both the defensive and the promotional roles of prognosis in chapter 1, the writer echoes the language used of Calchas in Homer or the Muses in Hesiod 13. The doctor should « tell in advance » « the present, the past and the future », terms echoed also in Epidemics I ch 5. Defensively, prognosis helps in that if the doctor has foretold the death of the patient, he will not be blamed. In the promotional role, if the doctor tells his patients not just the outcome of the disease, but also its past course and their present condition, then they will be more likely to entrust themselves to his care. But that trust comes from a prestige that, long before Hippocratic naturalism, had been the prerogative of the prophet or diviner. The ambivalence of naturalistic medicine, claiming to deal purely with factors that are capable of rational explanation, and yet still on occasion using the discourse of seercraft, continues right down to Galen, in the second century CE, and beyond. Galen remarks that he was so successful in prognosis that his rivals slandered him as a magician 14. He explains his own success by his skill in the interpretation of the pulse and the like, but it is clear that he exploited every opportunity to impress, indeed to amaze, his clients. On the one hand, the secret of his success is just his superior medical ability. On the other hand, his repeated references to the reputation he won as a wonder- worker suggest that he was not above relishing that reputation. 161</page><page sequence="8">Geoffrey Lloyd It is not hard to parallel this combination of hard-hitting polemic and a certain ambivalence in attitudes among the rival parties to it, if we refer to other aspects of Greek intellectual activity that do not involve a particular interest in divination 15. The question, for the comparativist, is, then, whether or to what extent such a combination is a distinctively Greek phenomenon. To answer that, we need to refer back to more of the Chinese materials set out in the papers of this collection. There is an interesting tension between some points that emerge from Harper's discussion and those suggested in Levi's paper. Both studies tackle aspects of rivalry and criticism between groups and individuals. Harper writes first of the relationship between what he calls « the proponents of the new cosmological theory », associated with the new use of hexagrams, and earlier milfoil divination, where he puts it that the former did not render the latter obsolete, but rather accommodated it (p. 95). Again he notes that both physicians and diviners could be called gong , « craftsman » (p. 96), that while the Huangdi neijing rejects the attribution of illness to demonic activity, it stops short of denying the existence of the world of spirits and demons (p. 99) and that Lingshu 58 in particular « does not exactly condone incantation in the contemporary world, but neither does it condemn incantation » (p. 107, note 29). Thus far, and in those contexts, there are more signs of drawing back from, than of engaging in, polemic. Yet some of Levi's examples modify that picture. Hanfeizi criticizes some divinatory practices as perverse. Sunzi rejects them in the context of waging war. To those two clear examples of explicit criticism, others can be added. Xunzi suggests that expenditure on divination may be a waste of resources 16, while Wang Chong asks what is so special about turtles or milfoil that they can yield predictions 17 . Rivalry in China from the Warring States to the end of the Han is not just a matter of a certain competitiveness between individual practitioners who recognise each other as engaged in broadly the same activities 18, for it also existed - as it did in Greece - across boundaries. Criticism of the wrong-headed or of those marginalised as deviant can be unrestrained, and not just where the grounds are moral ones or when those criticised are imagined as threatening disorder. All of that might seem to lead to the conclusion that the circumstances of developing modes of inquiry in general, and of divination in particular, were broadly similar, at least in ancient Greece and China, and that the differences that may be detected are no more than ones of emphasis or of tone. That there are such broad similarities provides the necessary bridgehead for comparative studies to be further pursued. But where contrasts are concerned, between individuals, or groups, within, or between, Greece and China, I would argue that we are not limited to evaluating merely differences of degree. We can do more than just assess just how eirenic or how polemical Chinese and Greek writers tended to be. To so limit ourselves would be to ignore a potential double pay-off. The first point relates to our reading of the various Chinese and Greek texts we encounter - where we can and should be alert to the types of rhetoric deployed. By that, I mean we can look beyond the stance that may be adopted just for rhetorical purposes. On the one hand, 162</page><page sequence="9">Divination : traditions and controversies, Chinese and Greek some Greek writers, especially, explicitly emphasise their objections and points of disagreement with those they polemicise against, even when, below the aggressive surface, they share more with their opponents than they let on. On the other hand, some Chinese authors, especially, give the impression of following earlier models even when they depart from and go well beyond them. In both cases, my addition of the term « especially » is to allow for Chinese texts in the first category (Wang Chong would be one example) and for Greek ones in the second (Galen's appropriation of Hippocrates and casting himself as his follower would be the most notorious instance of that). That serves to remind us that there are exceptions to the general rule, both among the Chinese and the Greeks. But more importantly, perhaps, we should see that the general rules, of stances that may express an eirenic or a polemical mode, may be adopted as much for tactical reasons, in the rhetoric of exchange, as for any more deep-seated ones. But then the second point concerns what is for us a substantial issue, insofar as the cultivation of those contrasting rhetorics tells us something about the characters of the intellectual exchange that were favoured. We are dealing not just with matters of literary style, but with perceptions as to how intellectual ambitions should be catered for, careers advanced, the goal of true knowledge or wisdom achieved. As for the reasons for the development of some characteristically aggressive Greek patterns of exchange, the argument I have offered elsewhere is that this corresponds to the need to make a name for yourself in public debate 19 . That was the primary context in which competitions for prestige, and for pupils, were played out. But where, as often in China, the target of persuasion was not a potentially hostile peer group, but the ruler or some other promising source of patronage and even stable employment, there the tactics of adversariality could be less advantageous than those of more muted disagreements and an official adherence to the spirit of consensuality. I shall not here elaborate such a line of argument, which, in any event, needs adaptation to the particular complexities of the data concerning divination. To mention just the most obvious qualification that needs to be entered, in the admonitory function of divination (alluded to above, p. 156), when the test of the discourse on the interpretation of signs was not whether a certain result ensued but whether the advice was sound, no amount of epistemological sophistication would rate as highly as the uprightness or practical wisdom of the counsellor. Overt criticism and polemic, or their avoidance, themselves have different modes, some orthogonal to others, depending on whether the perceived goal was one of truth - in the sense of correspondence to what were, or were represented to be, the facts - or one of utility and appropriateness. Yet if that serves to complexify the issues, it may underline, rather than undermine, the point that the insights that divinatory practices and their reception can throw on the character of the relevant communicative exchanges may offer one possibly fruitful avenue for their further investigation. 163</page><page sequence="10">Geoffrey Lloyd Notes 1.

In ch. 87 the author distances himself from specialist interpreters of dreams held to be divine and to give foreknowledge to cities or to individuals about coming evil or good events.

Thus there is a similar spectrum of attitudes on the question of the applicability of mathematics in general and of number in particular to the understanding of phenomena. Aristotle already polemicises against some of the excesses (as he sees them) of ideas he associates with certain Pythagoreans and Platonists, Metaphysics N chh. 5-6, 1092b8ff, b26ff. But such criticism failed to deter such a writer as 164</page><page sequence="11">Divination : traditions and controversies, Chinese and Greek Iamblichus, who, much later, at the turn of the third-fourth century CE, saw number as the key to the understanding of the universe, and all its parts (De Communi Mathematica Scientiá).
