<plain_text><page sequence="1">ROBERT L. MARTIN Musical "Topics" and Expression in Music In a series of illuminating discussions Wye Allan- brook has developed the idea that musical com- monplaces or "topics" in Mozart's music shed light on the problem of expression in that mu- sic. ' Topics are, roughly speaking, allusions within a piece of music to well-known kinds of music associated with various social settings, such as the hunt, the courtly dance, religious rit- uals, etc. Their importance derives from the commonplace nature of these kinds of music. Familiarity with them, and with their associa- tions, could be assumed by Mozart and other composers; so they provided a musical link to the extramusical. Allanbrook notes a striking shift from the eighteenth-century view that instrumental mu- sic was inferior because without words it lacked the means to "paint the passions," to the nine- teenth-century view that purely instrumental music was superior precisely because of its pu- rity. She notes the anomalousness of a prejudice in favor of texted music at a time when such masterworks as Mozart's piano concerti and string quartets were being produced and the un- satisfactoriness of the kind of music analysis that seems required by the nineteenth-century prejudice for "autonomous" music, an analysis that considers only purely musical relations among musical events. Her attractive suggestion is that the topics idea could have helped eight- eenth-century theorists understand how, for ex- ample, Mozart string quartets also paint the pas- sions, and can help us, today, feel comfortable with music analysis that takes affect and ex- pression seriously. For the topics, which were the shared background knowledge of audiences and composers alike, provide a connection to the feelings and forms of human life associated with the settings to which the topics refer. My aim in this paper is to understand and evaluate the idea of musical topics as a contribu- tion to the discussion of expression in classic music. Therefore, part of the paper is an analy- sis of the claims and arguments that lie behind the topics idea, and part is a formulation of my own ideas about expression in music of the clas- sic period. My ideas do not take the form of an answer to what I will call, for lack of a better term, the orthodox problem of expression in music; rather, they take the form of a different approach to the issue, starting with a recom- mendation that different questions be asked. I will conclude that the topics idea is not helpful if the problem of expression is posed in the ortho- dox way, but is helpful if expression is viewed in the way that I recommend. II The orthodox philosophical problem of expres- sion is to explain what it means for a piece of music to express, or be expressive of, some human emotion such as joy or sorrow. The task is to explain the connection between the music itself and the emotions, as opposed to two other phenomena: the expression of a composer's emo- tions through the act of composing and the evo- cation by music of an emotional response in lis- teners. Using Mozart's music as an example, let me try to motivate the three-way distinction I am drawing.2 We can think about Mozart's emo- tions and the likelihood that one of the things he was doing in composing string quartets was ex- pressing some of his emotions. It is perhaps not unreasonable to think of musical composition as a form of behavior that can serve to express feel- ings or emotions. From this perspective, we The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 53:4 Fall 1995</page><page sequence="2">418 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism may want to listen to Mozart's music as an indi- cation of what emotions he felt at various times. But it is not clear how we can read information about Mozart's emotions from his music. That the music sounds full of pride is no indication of how he felt when composing it. Perhaps all that is promising is to try to learn about the kind of pride Mozart experienced, when he did experi- ence it, from the parts of the music that we iden- tify independently as proud-sounding. But then it is clear that we are confronting emotions con- nected somehow to the music itself, recogniz- able quite independently of hypotheses about Mozart's emotions. That is the connection that the orthodox problem of expression seeks to un- derstand. We can also think about our own emotions and the quite reasonable notion that a smaller or larger section of a piece of music can induce an emotional response. This is a topic in psycho- logical theory, even if, as in the case of Leonard Meyer, the attempt is made to connect the un- folding of specifically musical events to the arousal of emotions.3 But the musical work itself is perceived as having an emotional quality, not simply as causing emotional response. So we are led to the question, what is the connection of the musical work to human emotions?, other than either of the two more straightforward con- nections concerning the emotions of the com- poser and the emotions of the listener.4 This is the key question for the orthodox problem of musical expression. There are, basically speaking, two groups of answers to this question. Those of the first group hold that musical works have features-melodic contour, tempo, texture, etc.-that resemble the ways that humans experience or express emo- tions. On the basis of this resemblance, words from the vocabulary of human emotions are thought to be applied metaphorically. Writers in this group include Hanslick, Monroe Beardsley, and, I suppose, Peter Kivy.5 Those of the second group hold that there is some kind of semantic relation between music and the emotions or that the very distinction between music and the ex- tramusical breaks down. Writers in this second group include Susanne Langer, Wye Allanbrook, Lawrence Kramer, Kofi Agawu, and Susan McClary.6 III Let me turn now to the topics idea, with an eye to assessing its contribution to solving the or- thodox philosophical problem of musical ex- pression. It consists of the following five or six claims: 1. There is a collection of easily recognizable kinds of music that were widely known to Mozart's audiences and to Mozart. Some examples are: music of the hunt courtly music-marches courtly music-fanfares social dance music (e.g., Laendler, minuet, bourree, contredanse) music box and mechanical clock music church music (learned style) "concertante" (virtuoso) music "sensitive style" music hurdy-gurdy music "Turkish" music. I have restricted myself to examples of what I would call the narrow range: each is associated with a particular kind of social occasion or set- ting. This fits one of Allanbrook's characteriza- tions: "In music the term has been borrowed [from the field of rhetoric] to designate 'com- monplace' musical styles or figures whose ex- pressive connotations, derived from the circum- stances in which they are habitually employed, are familiar to all" (emphasis added).7 It also fits one of her later characterizations: "a ready-to- hand vocabulary of musical expression gathered from the simpler music written to accompany daily activities: court life, worship, the hunt."8 Some of the examples I have excluded are: "types of basses like the descending- tetrachord or chaconne, associated with lament and the antique"; "the minor mode, which is a special af- fect for Classic composers, not a mode of expression parallel to the major"; "the wind serenade sound, so prevalent in Mozart's piano sonatas"; "the tune ... an effective stabilizing force."9</page><page sequence="3">Martin Musical "Topics" and Expression in Music 419 I would suggest that such examples as these that I have excluded are really something quite different. The minor mode and the wind sere- nade sound are not intuitively on a par with music of the church, of the dance, of the hunt; they are not kinds of music that are associated with particular settings. I think such examples are included, mistakenly, in the "topics" account because they do have something important in common with topics proper-that they are inde- pendently recognizable musical materials, some of which have a recognizable function. This is why there is less definiteness about how to indi- viduate examples of this kind and the absence of what Allanbrook calls "fortunate names."'0 Later, when I have argued that topics are special cases of a more general category, it will seem natural, I hope, to hold the topics account to ex- amples in which a kind of music is associated with a familiar social activity. 2. These kinds of music have associations, de- rived from the situations in which they are ha- bitually employed. Allanbrook calls these "expressive connota- tions," but for our purposes that begs two ques- tions: (1) whether expression is really involved; (2) whether one should look upon bits of music, such as a fanfare or hunt call, as capable of hav- ing connotations (and denotations). I will incor- porate the notion of expression later in my re- construction of the topics idea. As for con- notation, the examples suggest that the term is used loosely to indicate something secondary: the kind of music in question is the horn call of the hunt and therefore "connotes" (is associated with) such things as the outdoors, the excite- ment of the chase, etc. It is difficult to say just what these associa- tions are, and I have not in fact seen them made explicit. I would venture the following examples: music of the hunt: associated with the outdoors, the good cheer and excite- ment of the chase, good health, upper- class amusement; courtly marches and fanfares: associ- ated with military esprit, patriotic fervor, parades, and pageantry; minuet music: associated with elegance, perhaps restrained sexuality; church and learned music: associated with religious feelings, sophistication; Concertante (virtuoso music): associ- ated with charismatic attractiveness; "sensitive style" music: associated with intimacy, the drawing room; hurdy-gurdy music: associated with the lower classes, street entertainment; "Turkish" music: associated with the ex- otic Orient. 3. The associations were common knowledge in Mozart's time, and Mozart was aware of the fact that they were common knowledge. 4. Mozart's music contains passages that are very abbreviated examples of these kinds, and that would have been recognized as such by his audiences. This is a special case of the more general and very interesting phenomenon: musical quota- tions. In our case what is quoted are bits of music of a certain recognizable kind that is as- sociated with extramusical activities; in other cases what is quoted are bits of music written by other composers or from folk traditions or from earlier works of the same composer. " 5. These passages constitute allusions, or refer- ences, to the kinds of music in question; to them are transferred the associations held by the mu- sical topics. For example, a half-measure of fifths and thirds is an allusion to the music of the hunt and has associations with the outdoors, etc. So far it seems to me that each of these claims is plausible and, as I have said, illuminating taken together. What we have is a clear concep- tion of a range of musical materials available to Mozart and used by him, providing association- laden connections to the extramusical world. But there is the further claim, relevant to the question of expression: 6. By means of such allusions a Mozart work can be said to "paint the passions," i.e., to ex- press emotions. The argument for 6 seems to be that the pas- sions-not idiosyncratic personal feelings but</page><page sequence="4">420 rather universal and generic feelings-are pres- ent in the music through the connection of these feelings to the settings or the associations of the musical topics. "From their connections to the noble, middle-class, and humble, the pious and impious, whatever is proud or abased, tranquil or restless, antique or modern, in these occa- sions they draw their referential power and their affect."'2 This is a claim that goes beyond the idea of the topics as a distinctive part of Mo- zart's compositional resources; it is a claim about the orthodox philosophical problem of ex- pression. Viewed as such, I think that the claim is un- successful. To begin with, the examples offer nothing beyond what we have already in claims 1 to 5: that the use of topics brings with it asso- ciations from certain social settings. Even if, in some cases, these associations have to do with human emotions, it does not follow that the music expresses or refers to these emotions. Sup- pose, for example, that feelings of health and good cheer are associated with the music of the hunt. One can imagine Mozart very effectively imbedding an allusion to the hunt in a passage of nostalgic sadness; in such a passage the use of the topic surely does not amount to expression of health and good cheer. On the negative side, it would seem that most of the topics, whatever their function, are rather neutral with respect to emotion: for example, learned style music, "sen- sitive style" music, "Turkish" music. Some pieces of music that are clearly expressive of sadness and grief, if any are, such as the introduction to the last movement of Mozart's G-Minor String Quintet (K. 516), do not, as far as I can tell, con- tain any topics of the narrow range; even if they do, it is implausible to suppose that it is the top- ics that are responsible for the expression of sad- ness. Topics are neither sufficient nor necessary for the expression of emotions, and their possi- ble association with the emotional coloring of certain social settings does not imply anything like the "painting of the passions." 13 I suggest that the real and important effect of the topics is to give to the work a feeling of being connected to other experiences of life: the court, the hunt, church-going, etc. This accounts for something very important in the experience of many listeners-the feeling that even very "abstract" music has close connections to the fullness of life's experiences. It is, exactly as Al- The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism lanbrook says in the conference paper, an under- standing of music's "connection to the world" (p. 7) that is the value of the topics idea, and this is quite independent, I think, of any claim about the expression of emotions. IV I characterized the orthodox philosophical problem of musical expression as flowing from the question, what is the connection between a musical work and human emotions? Perhaps that question is the wrong question to begin with. J. L. Austin, in 'A Plea for Excuses,"'4 suggested that we ask not about grand and in- tractable concepts such as moral responsibility but about such humbler topics as excuses. I want to approach the notion of expressiveness in music not by asking about the connection to human emotions, but by asking the humbler question: what is meant by expressive playing? All would admit the importance of performance in our experience of music and the fact that some players are particularly expressive players; I think we can get at, at least roughly, what that means. The question is whether we can find our way from that to the broader question about ex- pressiveness in music where more of impor- tance to the experience of listeners is at stake. We ask, then, what is meant by expressive playing. An expressive player stresses certain notes, lingers at certain points in a phrase, moves ahead at other points, varies tone color and dynamics in response to varying chords or harmonies, sustains phrases to their conclu- sions, paces crescendi and diminuendi to main- tain tension, marks the color change from major to minor, brings out the contrast between allu- sions to the church and to the virtuoso soloist, and so on. I recall that as music students we used to mock the following idea about learning a new, difficult work: first we should learn the notes, then the rhythms, then add the dynamics, and fi- nally add the expression. As silly as this was, it was perfectly plain to us all what it meant: that there could be the correct series of pitches; there could be a rhythmically precise performance, all at mezzo-forte; perhaps most clearly of all, be- cause all too often actually encountered, there could be a note-perfect but inexpressive perfor- mance. We realized that even if accents, hair-</page><page sequence="5">Martin Musical "Topics" and Expression in Music 421 pins, and other expression marks were observed literally the performance could be lacking in "real" expression; real expression required a certain sensitive, responsive realization even of the expression marks themselves. The point to be noticed in all of this, I believe, is that the per- former's expressiveness is in some peculiar way separable from the composer's instructions.15 No separation will be apparent in an actual, con- vincing performance, but the conceptual dis- tinction is important. If we think again of the characterization of an expressive performer, we notice that the unify- ing thread is responsiveness to the raw materi- als: tonality, rhythm, the structure of melodies, and, I would add, the topics, since these too are among the materials at a composer's disposal. This connection with the materials of music would explain the feeling that expressive play- ing operates at a level that is somehow distinct from that of the works themselves. It is striking in this connection that expressive performers can play expressively even when sight-reading. This is noted by E. F. Clarke and commented on as follows: "These observations mean that ex- pression ... must be regarded as being generated from the performer's understanding of the mu- sical structure."'16 If by "the musical structure" Clarke means the structure of the musical work, then his conclusion is implausible-it seems more reasonable to explain expressive sight- reading as derived from the performer's ability to respond to that which is in some sense prior to the musical work, for example, the expressive properties of intervals and chords or the expres- sive properties of aspects of the style in which the work is written. To give substance to this idea that expressive- ness has to do with a response to the materials of music, I need to say more about these materials and what there is to them to which a performer can respond in a way that can be described as "expressive." Let me give a single very simple example. There is something important about the interval of the octave, and this importance is to a large extent natural (as opposed to con- structed). What makes the octave an important natural phenomenon is that the most prominent overtones of any given tone are those at exactly twice the frequency of the starting tone (that is, at the octave). Therefore, relative to any tone, the octave is that tone which is most conso- nant-most supported, or reinforced, by the overtones of the starting tone. I do not doubt that the octave plays widely varying roles in various musics of the world and that some of the partic- ular importance or significance that the octave has in Western music is "constructed"; but it does seem evident that it has a physical basis of great importance. One has only to sing a pitch and then let one's voice go up, seeking a stable point of rest, to feel the force of this point. How the octave is divided is far less natural- the division of the octave into twelve roughly equal semi-tones that characterizes the Western modes is not at all universal. Each of the modes is a particular arrangement of semi-tones and whole tones, and tonality, as it stabilized in the seventeenth century, is the selection of two of these arrangements, known now as major and minor. Tonality, then, is certainly a construct, and therefore a worthy subject of cultural the- ory-one wonders, and many have speculated on, what other cultural phenomena of the seven- teenth century are related to the construction of tonality. But it is a construct with a physical basis-there are relevant acoustical facts, at least partially determinative of the importance of the octave. To come now to the example, consider the difference between the third degree of the ma- jor scale and the lowered third degree-the changed tone that distinguishes the minor from the major triad. The characteristic of the exam- ple should be instantly clear: the lowered third has a particular "dynamic quality," to use Zuck- erkandl's term,17 that we can express metaphor- ically by saying that it wants to go down, that it pulls down, to the second degree of the scale; while the major third has somewhat more equi- librium-if anything, it seems to want to go up to the fourth degree of the scale. Our character- ization of the dynamic quality of these tones is of necessity metaphorical and anthropomorphic because the quality itself is primitive in the sense of not being definable in simpler terms. We have here a fascinating and perplexing fea- ture of our environment: when perceived within a tonal context, a tone is felt to have a particular very distinctive property. However, one has only to alter the context, and the property is altered. Because tonality is involved, and not only acous- tic facts, the phenomenon must be regarded as partly constructed, partly "natural." It is indeed</page><page sequence="6">422 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism the phenomenon of "hearing as," treated by Wittgenstein in the Philosophical Investigations; in the key of C one hears the E-flat as pulling down a half-step; one hears the E natural as lift- ing toward F. Similarly, one sees three horizon- tal lines encircled as a human face.18 It is ar- guable that one cannot not see the lines as a face, that this is a fact of human psychology; nor, for some reason, can one, in C major, not hear the E-flat as pulling down. The basis here will be at least partly acoustic rather than psychological- presumably the perceived disequilibrium of the E-flat is at least partly the result of the fact that the major third matches one of the fairly strong overtones of the tonic, while the minor third matches no such overtone. This, then, is my example of a bit of the ma- terial of music to which an expressive player may be expected to respond. But why "expres- sive"? It is one thing for there to be some acoustic fact or some "dynamic quality" of pitches or rhythms to which a sensitive player responds; so far, one might call the performer's response simply "revelatory." More is required for the performer's response to the stuff of music to be called expressive; this presumably requires that the musical qualities to which the performer responds be expressively colored in some sense to be made clear. In the case of our example, one can speculate on why the minor is perceived as expressively colored, perhaps darker or sadder than the major. The downward pull of the minor third, that contour, is similar to fea- tures of human expressive behavior associated with downcast moods: most obviously and liter- ally, the intonation contour of the voice of a per- son experiencing the emotion of sadness.'9 (Though there is, I believe, this similarity be- tween the dynamic quality of the tones and fea- tures of human expressive behavior, it does not follow that the lowered third is always perceived as having this expressive coloration-the asso- ciation is certainly defeasible.) The range of expressively charged materials is enormous-from such relatively simple ex- amples as the timbral complexity of the open C string of the cello at the "natural" end of the spectrum to aspects of compositional styles and conventions that become part of the language of well-versed players and listeners at the con- structed end of the spectrum. An example of the latter is this: a performer may, even in sight- reading, play the opening melody of a work that appears to be theme and variations with a kind of simplicity and neutrality, knowing, as part of his or her knowledge of the style, that the theme will unfold and blossom and intensify as the work proceeds. The neutral statement of the theme will allow this unfolding to be more clearly perceived by listeners. I am suggesting, as others have before me, that there is a level of pre-compositional mater- ial charged with expressive potential to which members of the musical community are sensi- tive. Composers shape this material, taking ad- vantage of its expressive potential and counting on the sensitivities of performers and listeners. It is not the work then that is, in the first in- stance, expressive but rather the stuff of music. That is perhaps why one feels discomfort in say- ing or, for that matter, in denying that a substan- tial section of a work is, for example, sad or joyous. The reality is fine-grained, moment-to- moment expressiveness. Perhaps, to put it differ- ently, one hears in a work what is done to-what happens to-expressive materials; one listens to where the composer takes those materials.20 Within our musical environment and, a fortiori, as part of the composer's vocabulary, the mate- rials already have expressive meaning; the inter- est is not so much in what is expressed but rather in what develops. It needs to be emphasized, against the im- pression I may have given so far, that in the best case the performer's response is not simply to the materials of music but to these materials as employed by the composer. Expressiveness is certainly not only the work of the performer. The composer uses the expressive potential of the musical materials, and the performer re- sponds to those materials in the context of the work. For example, a performer will pay less heed to particular expressive opportunities in an extended, building section of a piece, for fear that the sense of continuation and heighten- ing will be disrupted; the very same expressive opportunities occurring elsewhere in the piece will be brought out more fully. A second exam- ple, this one real: in the Minuet movement of Mozart's K. 421 Quartet, the opening trumpet- call dotted rhythm of the cello and violin 1 in octaves has a troubled, even anguished charac- ter (playing against the usual rhetoric of the fig- ure) caused by the fact that the movement is in</page><page sequence="7">Martin Musical "Topics" and Expression in Music 423 D minor (after an F-major slow movement) and by the relatively high register of the cello part (a two-octave spread between violin 1 and cello would sound very different indeed) and by the continuation of the line in the inner voices. The performer seeks a kind of collaborative relation- ship with the composer in grasping and project- ing to the audience the intentions of the com- poser, including the composer's use of pre- existing materials. Again, neither the performer nor the composer is the primary source of expres- siveness: it is the musical material-its extra- musical significance-that is primary. The composer takes advantage of the potential of the material, and the performer responds to the po- tential in real time and to real effect. I characterized the orthodox philosophical problem of musical expression as the question: what does it mean to say that a musical work ex- presses, or is expressive of, happiness or sad- ness? My response was to turn away from that question and to ask other questions, for exam- ple, about expressive playing. But where are we left with respect to the orthodox problem? On the one hand, it seems that almost nothing is conveyed by saying that a musical work, or even a short section of a musical work, expresses, or is expressive of, happiness or sadness. Such a statement seems too crude to do justice to our musical experience. Our account of expressive playing of expressive works seems not to require that there be some emotion that is expressed by the work. On the other hand, I am not about to deny that a scherzo can be joyous. Perhaps a fruitful direction in which to explicate such statements is suggested by the ideas put forward here: perhaps such characterizations can use- fully be traced back to the expressive potential of the musical materials, including topics, avail- able for the use of a composer, as these materi- als are understood and felt by all members of the musical community. To summarize: I have suggested that the top- ics idea is an extremely valuable tool for our un- derstanding of classic music, because it explains our feelings about the connections of the music to the association-laden situations of daily life. I have argued further that the topics are a special case of the category of musical materials that exist independently of particular works; some of these materials, but not all of the topics, have strong emotional coloring and may lie at the root of the phenomenon of expressiveness in music. It is in this sense that I can see a connec- tion between topics and expression. ROBERT L. MARTIN Bard College Annandale-on-Hudson, New York 12504 1.

In the case of the visual arts, Richard Wollheim has ar- gued persuasively (in Painting as an Art [Princeton Univer- sity Press, 1987]) for a view that strongly connects the emo- tions of the painter and the viewer to the emotional content of the painting. Roughly speaking, the painter, positioned to gauge the work's effect on a spectator, creates meaning in the work by producing marks intended to have a certain ef- fect and intended to be perceived as flowing from such an intention. I believe this picture can be applied illuminatingly to music. But even with this account of the interconnected nature of creator's and audience's emotion, there appears to remain the need for an account of the work's own expres- siveness; indeed, Wollheim offers such an account for paint- ing in terms of the psychological phenomenon of projection. 5.

Kivy holds, more exactly, that the assertion that a theme is "broken with grief" should be construed as saying that the theme is expressive of grief (as opposed to: expresses grief; the latter but not the former is thought to require that the grief be experienced). The features of the music that sup- port this characterization are just those that belong to what Monroe Beardsley calls "human regional qualities." It can perhaps be argued that the attribution of "expressive of grief" to a piece of music is a metaphorical extension of the literal attribution of that phrase (to something that could also be expressing grief ). 6.

See Charles Rosen, "Influence: Plagiarism and Inspi- ration" in K. Price, ed., On Criticizing Music, pp. 16-37. In this kind of allusion, to the delight of the connoisseur, the ac- tual bit of music quoted is less likely to have general signif- icance (because it is not associated with a social situation); Charles Rosen suggests that the significance in some cases resides not in the passage alluded to, but in the fact of allu- sion ("The two opening references to Beethoven's "Emperor" Concerto [in Brahms's Piano Concerto No. 2] ... must be un- derstood as staking a claim. This work, we are informed by these opening references, is intended to follow upon the tra- dition left off by Beethoven" [p. 27]). The other major dif- ference is that the allusion is unlikely to be understood by very many-even if Rosen is right that "Brahms was a mas- ter of allusion, and ... generally intended his references to be heard" (p. 26). 12. "'Ear-Tickling Nonsense,"' p. 12. In "Expression" Allanbrook offers a more inclusive account of music's paint- ing of the passions: "In music passions can be projected by appropriate rhythms and figures. ... Through its harmony and rhythm, bound with historical associations with the lament and the ecclesiastical styles, it stirs in its auditors cognition of the affect of the noble pathetic, one of the many motions of the human soul" (p. 15). In this more inclusive account, the topics' part of the explanation ("historical asso- ciations with the lament and the ecclesiastical styles") is mingled with the traditional appeal to natural similarities be- tween elements of harmony and rhythm and types of human emotions. I am concerned here only with the explanatory contribution of the topics. 13. A referee of this journal has raised another problem with the topics account as a response to the orthodox prob- lem of expression: that it fails to explain how a competent listener today recognizes the expressive properties of (say) Mozart's music. Surely many topics have long since ceased to be commonplace. But I do not take the topic theorist to claim that topics are the only basis for expression in music; I suppose that a topic theorist would simply agree that a good deal of background knowledge is necessary to appreciate topics and that this in part accounts for the fact that educated listeners "get more" from hearing performances. 14.

The phenomenon of "see- ing-as" is treated more extensively in the Investigations, for example at II, ? xi. 19. See Kivy, The Corded Shell, chaps. 1-5. 20. I owe this thought to Robert Marshall.</page></plain_text>
