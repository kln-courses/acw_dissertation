<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mythology in the Old Greek of Isaiah: The Technique of Translation STEVEN JAMES SCHWEITZER 1 508 Spokane Lane South Bend, IN 46635 Tim quality of the translation of the Book of Isaiah in the Old Greek has been the subject of much scholarly debate. Different opinions about Isaiah's OG/LXX translation as an "accurate" representation of a Hebrew Vorlage have been offered.1 Johann Lust declared that scholarly consensus was correct in af- firming that OG Isaiah was "a rather free translation."2 For Lust, this phrase connotes a negative assessment of the quality of the Greek translation, although all who would use the same phrase do not intend such a negative critique. Anneli Aejmelaeus, speaking not about Isaiah in particular but about the LXX in general, agrees with the "consensus" that it is inconsistent in its rendering of its Hebrew parent text. Sometimes the translator3 follows what can reasonably be assumed to be the Hebrew Vorlage, although the translation "includes a great number of I wish to express my sincere appreciation to Professor Eugene Ulrich, of the University of Notre Dame, for his enthusiastic encouragement of this project, for his reading of multiple drafts of this paper, and for his extremely helpful" suggestions for its improvement. All deficiencies, of course, are mv own. 1 I will use the term "Old Greek" (OG) in reference to the original translation of the Book of Isaiah into Greek, while "Septuagint" (LXX) will be used when there is uncertainty about the pedigree of the Greek text, or in reference to developments in the process of the textual transmission, or for recensions of the LXX text itself. The use of OG and LXX will not be changed in quotations of other scholars cited in this analysis. 2 Johann Lust, "The Demonic Character of Jahweh and the Septuagint of Isaiah," Bijdragen: International Journal in Philosophy and Theology 40 (1979) 2-14, here 4. 3 Although it is possible that more than one individual was involved in the translation process, I will use the singular rather than the cumbersome "translator(s)." I am not convinced that a separate 214</page><page sequence="2">OLD GREEK OF ISAIAH 215 interpretational elements, and in difficult cases the translator has been found to resort to certain favourite words of his."4 However, Aejmelaeus also insists that the translation is not a "free-for-all." She states: "As I see it, the general intention of the translators was thus concerned with the meaning of the original, or mean- ings of words and phrases in the original."5 While this last statement was made regarding the LXX as a whole, it pro- vides a way of talking about OG Isaiah in particular. Its translator would appar- ently share the same concern for providing a meaningful translation. In this case, rather than slavishly repeating the Hebrew text - whatever the Vorlage actually was - the translation was intended to convey the meaning of the text to a new audience using a particular conceptual framework.6 This seemingly admirable intention may be reconciled with Lust's negative view of it by analyzing OG Isaiah with particular criteria that will establish the technique used by the trans- lator in rendering the Hebrew Vorlage into Greek. In this analysis, I hope to provide such criteria and an assessment based on them that will allow for further discussion on the translation technique in OG Isaiah. It is clear from a surface reading of the text that OG Isaiah does not represent a "wooden" translation of the Hebrew similar to that of an interlinear Bible. It has recently been termed a "moderately literal translation of the Hebrew" that "uses a variety of approaches. Some of [the translator's] renderings are very literal and at times unintelligible, but he can also be creative and skillful."7 However the terms used in this recent assessment are understood, OG Isaiah is clearly not a paraphrase attempting to convey the meaning of the text without regard for the original context of the parent Hebrew text. Robert Hanhart argues that the individual translations of books in the LXX "... must be considered as a faithful rendering of the original as far as content and form is concerned, a rendering exact even in grammatical and syntactical details like those involving translator was responsible for Isaiah 36-39, as advocated by Harry M. Orlinsky, "Introductory Essay: On Anthropomorphisms and Anthropopathisms in the Septuagint and Targum," in The Septuagint Translation of the Hebrew Terms in Relation to God in the Book of Jeremiah (New York: Ktav, 1981) xv-xxiv, here xviii. 4 Anneli Aejmelaeus, "What Can We Know about the Hebrew Vorlage of the Septuagint?" in eadem, On the Trail of the Septuagint Translators: Collected Essays (Kampen: Pharos, 1993) 77-1 15, here 85; repr. from ZAW 99 (1987) 58-89. 5 Anneli Aejmelaeus, "Translation Technique and the Intention of the Translator," in On the Trail of Septuagint Translators, 65-76, here 67-68; repr. from VII Congress of the International Organization for Septuagint and Cognate Studies, Leuven, 1989 (ed.

Baer echoes this sentiment repeatedly (When We All Go Home: Translation and Theology in LXX Isaiah 56-66 [JSOTSup 318; Hebrew Bible and Its Versions 1; Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 2001] 16, 22, 277-82). 7 Karen H.

Arie van der Kooij has offered another view of the translation technique involved in OG Isaiah that avoids the language of "faithful rendering." Following Isac Seeligmann's suggestion,9 he has argued that what has been done in the translation should be described as "actualizing exegesis." According to van der Kooij, OG Isaiah was translated with an eye toward the contemporary events at the time of the translation. The interpretation of these events was included when the text was rendered into Greek.10 The translator attempted to align the ancient prophecy with the present situation. To accomplish this, according to van der Kooij, the translator "create[d] new texts with a meaning of their own, presum- ably with the ultimate purpose not only to modernize the text linguistically, but also to actualize the prophecies of Isaiah."11 Prophecy and terminology have been updated to relate ancient texts and concepts to a new audience. For Seeligmann, this new audience is provided with a translation "characterized in numerous places not only by a fairly considerable independence of the Hebrew text, but also [one that] evinces an equally marked influence from the surrounding cultural atmosphere, as well as expressing the author's personal view."12 It should be noted that Seeligmann's statement concerning "the Hebrew text" applied, as he himself notes in the same context, only to the MT. Since his work was published in 1948, the evidence from Qumran was not available for his consideration. One wonders if his view of the translation technique of OG Isaiah would have been different in the light of the information provided by the Dead Sea Scrolls, in particular by lQIsaa, which demonstrates the pluriformity of the Hebrew text at this early period.13 8 Robert Hanhart, "The Translation of the Septuagint in Light of Earlier Tradition and Subse- quent Influences," in Septuagint, Scrolls and Cognate Writings: Papers Presented to the International Symposium on the Septuagint and Its Relations to the Dead Sea Scrolls and Other Writings {Manches- ter, 1990) (ed.

On the evidence for pluriformity of the Hebrew text</page><page sequence="4">OLD GREEK OF ISAIAH 217 Despite his previous remark, Seeligmann is hesitant regarding the Hellenis- tic tendencies of the translation. He states that such Hellenistic influence is "rela- tively weak" and that the translator is working within a "mentality . . . nourished . . . from predominately Jewish sources." 14 However, toward the end of his work, Seeligmann provides evidence that would seem to indicate that the translator did, in fact, incorporate many words, phrases, and concepts that have particular Hel- lenistic connotations.15 These apparently contradictory points made by Seelig- mann lead to the following conclusion: these two issues, the translation technique and the degree of hellenization in the text, are related; indeed, their relationship in OG Isaiah requires further analysis. I. Methodology In this discussion of translation technique in OG Isaiah, I will analyze select mythological elements in the text, with particular attention to their possible helleni- zation. These elements in the Hebrew text required the OG translator to make choices about how to render the particular words, phrases, and concepts into appro- priate Greek.16 1 have selected three categories of such elements for discussion - ( 1 ) the netherworld, (2) mythological creatures, and (3) specific ancient Near Eastern mythology - and have chosen words and phrases that scholars have agreed most likely reflect a mythological worldview. These mythological elements provide one possible source for determining the methodology of the translator throughout the entire text of Isaiah. This broader analysis may be more helpful than limiting attention to one chapter or one section of the book.17 If these elements are rendered in a consistent manner, the conclusion may serve to bolster the arguments of one of the positions regarding the translation technique of OG Isaiah mentioned above. In addition, such mythological elements provide the translator with an oppor- tunity to be "creative" in the exegesis of the passage. Mythology is not explained in the same terms by every culture or even by the same culture in different time during this period, see Eugene Ulrich, The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Origins of the Bible (Studies in the Dead Sea Scrolls and Related Literature; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans; Leiden: Brill, 1999) esp. 17-33, 34-50, 79-98, 99-120. 14 Seeligmann, Septuagint Version of Isaiah, 120. 15 Ibid., 99-119. 16 No previous analysis of mythological elements in any OG book has been published, to my knowledge, so this analysis will be the first such investigation on a topic important for study of both the LXX and the Hebrew Bible. 17 For recent analyses of translation technique in a single chapter, see the following: van der Kooij, "Short Commentary"; idem, Oracle of Tyre; and Peter W. Flint, "The Septuagint Version of Isaiah 23:1-14 and the Massoretic Text," BIOSCS 21 (1988) 35-54.</page><page sequence="5">218 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 66, 2004 periods. Therefore, mythological elements are susceptible to change and are thus fertile ground for understanding the choices the translator has made. Were the mythological elements updated, changed, deleted, demythologized, rendered con- sistently in new ways, made to refer to contemporary events or persons, translated in the most closely corresponding term(s), or simply transliterated? To answer this question, I will examine a selection of these mythological elements to elucidate the attempt by the OG translator to render the Hebrew Vorlage into comparable Greek within the larger Hellenistic milieu in which he and his audience found themselves. The translator had many options available when mythological elements were encountered in the Hebrew Vorlage. I offer here eight possible methods of trans- lation as categories for analyzing the presentation of mythological elements in OG Isaiah.18 1 abbreviate them as follows: 18 See also the five "lexical guidelines" that have been established as principles by the trans- lators of the New English Translation of the Septuagint ("Introduction," in The Psalms: A New English Translation of the Septuagint and the Other Greek Translations Traditionally Included under that Title [ed. Albert Pietersma and Benjamin Wright; New York: Oxford University Press, 2000] vii-xxvii, here xiv): (1) Greek words in the LXX normally have their Greek meaning; (2) the nuance of Greek words is sometimes arbitrated by the Hebrew parent text; (3) stereotypical readings are caused by uniform renderings of words (similar to a "word list," on which see below); (4) isolate renderings which occur because of their perceived (but inaccurate) connection with Hebrew mor- phemes; (5) Greek words are noted that directly reflect the Hebrew meaning. While these categories are useful for rendering Greek into English with attention to the Hebrew, my categories are aimed at comparing the Greek and Hebrew without the added task of providing an "appropriate" English translation. In addition, my eight categories allow for a more detailed comparison of these particular concepts than would be required for the final version of the intended NETS translation of Isaiah, which would be more concerned with the relationship between Greek and English than with Hebrew and Greek. In addition, see the comments on "levels" of translation technique in general by Jobes and Silva, Invitation to the Septuagint , esp. 87-93. They note five possibilities that "we should keep in the mind" when discussing the differences between the Greek and Masoretic texts: "1. The Hebrew Vorlage from which it was translated was different from the Hebrew text extant today. 2. The trans- lation process was unprecedented and therefore does not reveal a pattern. 3. The translator made a mistake. 4. The translator had an interpretative bias. 5. Some complicated combination of these circumstances affected the resulting translation" (p. 92). In addition, there are three general principles that motivated the translators to include interpretative elements: "First, their rendering of the Hebrew text was sometimes influenced by the theology of their time. Second, interpretative elements were introduced into the Greek text because of the translators' respect for the oral tradition and liturgy that had developed along with the Septuagint. Third, just as the original biblical authors wrote with a target audience in mind, the translators produced their work for a people living within certain social and political situations, and thus they were motivated to actualize the Scripture, making it both compre- hensible and relevant for their contemporary situation" (p. 93). My categories share much of this same language, but I would not use the word "actualize" as they seem to use it, following the model established by Seeligmann and van der Kooij.</page><page sequence="6">OLD GREEK OF ISAIAH 219 ( 1 ) transliteration 1 9 [trlit] ; (2) translation while keeping the mythological concepts within the Hebrew/ancient Near Eastern context, or not expressing them in an overtly Hellenistic context [tr- Hb]; (3) translation with equivalent concepts in a Hellenistic mythological framework [tr-Hln]; (4) translation with an eye toward "actualizing exegesis/' which equated the mytho- logical elements with present reality20 [actlz]; (5) emendation of ideas perceived as "offensive" or "outdated"21 [emd]; (6) deletion of elements not understood [not-und]; (7) mistranslation with "incorrect" words either because of a lack of knowledge or for some other reason22 [mistr]; (8) accurate following of a Hebrew text that has a different reading [Vorl 1] or one that does not unambiguously require a mythological reading23 [Vorl 2]. 19 Transliteration may signal one of two possibilities: either the word was unknown and so was preserved through transliteration, or (more likely) the word was commonly known in this form, so translation would have been unnecessary, the meaning of the word being attached to this particular form. Examples of the second type would include the modern liturgical usage of "cherubim" and "seraphim," words that are transliterations that have a specific meaning and do not require a trans- lation when used. The translator of OG Isaiah had a choice to make regarding names of deities and obscure words. The use of transliteration may indicate that the word had a particular meaning already attached to it. 20 This category is designed to test van der Kooij's description of the translation technique in OG/LXX Isaiah. The mythological elements could easily be made to refer to present individuals or events, since myth was constantly reinterpreted and connected to new developments by authors from numerous cultures in antiquity. The association of deities from one culture with those of another is found in a variety of texts. Isaiah 14 employs an ancient myth about a rebellious god that was formerly applied to an Assyrian ruler and is now reapplied in a new context to the tyrant of Babylon. See arguments for this development in Seth Erlandsson, The Burden of Babylon: A Study of Isaiah 13:2- 14:23 (trans. G. J. Houser; ConBOT 4; Stockholm: Almqvist &amp; Wiksell, 1970); Michael S. Heiser, "The Mythological Provenance of Isa. XIV 12-15: A Reconsideration of the Ugaritic Material," VT 51 (2001) 354-69; Brevard S. Childs, Isaiah (OTL; Louisville: Westminster John Knox, 2001) 114-15, 122-28; Marvin A. Sweeney, Isaiah 1-39: With an introduction to prophetic literature (FOTL 16; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1996) 231-39. Arguing against the Assyrian reference, on the other hand, is Joseph Blenkinsopp, Isaiah 1-39: A new translation with introduction and commentary (AB 19; New York: Doubleday, 2000) 276-78. 21 This category is relevant to perceived theological differences between the Hebrew Vorlage and the OG/LXX. The translator may have suppressed or removed material that was no longer theologically acceptable; such a technique is particularly relevant to anthropomorphisms and anthro- popathisms in OG/LXX Isaiah. Scholars have discussed these two issues at length without producing a clear consensus. Restrictions on the length of this current article require that discussion of such theological questions be deferred to a future study, which I hope to undertake soon. 22 This type of "mistranslation" is difficult to prove conclusively, and it will not be offered as the most appropriate reason unless the evidence is unmistakable. 23 The translator may "correctly" read the Hebrew Vorlage in a nonmythological way insofar as the Hebrew might be open to either nonmythological or mythological interpretation depending on</page><page sequence="7">220 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 66, 2004 These eight categories build on the three categories of translation that Peter Flint used in his analysis of Isaiah 23: (1) literal and semantically adequate, (2) non- literal and semantically adequate, (3) nonliteral and semantically inadequate.24 Although Flint's categories are useful in providing a good starting point for this analysis, they do not allow for the distinction that I wish to make between retaining mythological elements and representing them in explicitly Hellenistic terms. In addition, these eight options provide a way to assess the variety of methods employed by the translator throughout the entire text and not just in one chapter. The present analysis will compare the rendering of mythological elements in the texts of the MT with OG Isaiah and will attempt to assess which option or options of the eight presented above seem to have been used in each case.25 The evidence from Qum- ran, especially from lQIsaa, which may provide an explanation for the rendering of the OG, will be cited when appropriate.26 The analysis will be based on the Greek words and phrases used to render the Hebrew ones. II. Mythological Elements In OG Isaiah A. Netherworld 1. Sheol and Hades. "Hades" (a√¥ri√ß) appears to be a consistent equivalent for "Sheol" (SlNCtf) in OG Isaiah, almost as if a "word list"27 existed (Isa 5:14; the context and the further development of mythology in the passage. In such a case, the translator would not be removing mythology, only declining to recognize the mythological elements, given that they are not unambiguous in the Hebrew Vorlage itself. However, as should be clear, it is not always possible to determine if it is a textual variant or a different reading of the same text that has produced a different rendering in the Greek. Thus, I will offer my preference between Vori 1 and Vorl 2, but such a distinction is tenuous, given the nature of the textual evidence as a whole; and for this reason, I have made these two possibilities subdivisions of the same category rather than two separate categories. 24 Flint, "Septuagint Version," 38. 25 Greek textual citations are taken from the G√∂ttingen edition of the Old Greek by Joseph Ziegler, Isaias (Septuaginta: Vetus Testament≈Øm Graecum 14; 2d ed.; G√∂ttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1967). The Hebrew text is taken from BHS. All English translations provided are my own. 26 It is possible that the variant spelling of some key words or similarity in letters may account for the "divergent" rendering of OG Isaiah in comparison with the extant Hebrew manuscripts. As a whole, the readings from lQIsa3 are consistent, at least in what concerns the mythological elements cited in this analysis, with those preserved in the MT of Isaiah. On the transmission of the Hebrew text of Isaiah, see the recent work by Paulson Pulikottil ( Transmission of Biblical Texts in Qumran: The Case of the Large Isaiah Scroll lQIsaa [JSPSup 34; Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 2001] 129), taking note of "the meticulous attention that the scribe has for the meaning of the text" while emphasizing that a variety of techniques were employed in clarifying this lengthy text. The readings of lQIsa3 are taken from the reconstruction by Donald W. Parry and Elisha Qimron (eds.), The Great Isaiah Scroll ( lQIsaa ): A New Edition (STDJ 32; Leiden: Brill, 1999). 27 I am using the phrase "word list" to signify a chart of equivalents that would have been available for the translators, signaling to them: "When you see X, then use Y."</page><page sequence="8">OLD GREEK OF ISAIAH 221 14:9, 11, 15; 28:15, 18; 38:10, 18; 57:9 [all: tr-Hln]).28 There is evidence in the Hellenistic world of "word lists" used when teaching or explaining Homer. Although the Homeric epics were the centerpiece of Greek paideia,29 they contained many unintelligible words. Individuals, especially teachers and schoolchildren, would consult these charts to make sense out of difficult Homeric words and phrases.30 It can also be argued that Aquila used something of a "word list" or vocabulary chart in his production of a Greek recension that more closely followed the Hebrew text available to him.31 Furthermore, Walter Bodine studied the Greek text of Judges and demonstrated that each recension contained characteristic phrases and peculiar terms that differ one from another, that is, a list of "stock phrases" that were used for each recension to make difficult expressions understandable.32 In the entire LXX, "Hades" is used to translate 61 out of the 65 occurrences of "Sheol" found in the Hebrew text, in addition to the occurrence of rrbxE? in Isa 7:11 (see below). Of the four exceptions, two use "death," Gccvocto√ß (2 Sam 22:6; Prov 23:14), and two are present in verses in which the entire verse is not translated word for word or even phrase by phrase (Ezek 32:21; Job 24: 19).33 Thus, concerning this concept, OG Isaiah produced a translation that is faithful to the meaning of the parent text, though in Hellenistic terminology.34 The unique spelling of "Sheol" in Isa 7:11 (√¨iSkE?) may have contributed to its translation by a different word, "the depth" (p√°Go√ß), which has a similar connotation nonetheless [tr-Hb, tr-Hln].35 "Sheol" is never transliterated. Rather than retain the Hebrew/ancient Near Eastern concept, the translators rendered the 28 All of the following verse references are to Isaiah unless otherwise noted; all occurrences of the selected words in Isaiah are supplied. 29 Werner Jaeger, Paideia: The Ideals of Greek Culture : Vol. 1, Archaic Greece: The Mind of Athens (3d Eng. ed.; Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1946); Vol. 2, In Search of the Divine Center (New York: Oxford University Press, 1944). 30 H. I. Marrou, A History of Education in Antiquity (trans. G. Lamb; New York: Sheed &amp; Ward, 1956) 166-67. 31 Joseph Reider, An Index to Aquila (completed and rev. N. Turner; VTSup 12; Leiden: Brill, 1966). Walter R. Bodine, The Greek Text of Judges: Recensional Developments (HSM 23; Chico, CA: Scholars, 1980). 33 The use of "death" (G√°vaxo√ß) for "Sheol" should not be surprising. The terms are used in parallel phrases in Hos 13:14; Hab 2:5; Ps 6:6; 18:6 (17:6 LXX); Prov 5:5; 7:27; and Cant 8:6. 34 Baer ( When We All Go Home, 171) states without further clarification that "this translator hesitates - when his text allows him to do so - to carry over personifications of idols, nature, or mythic entities such as Sheol." Although "Sheol" does not appear in OG Isaiah, "Hades" does. Baer does not address the hellenization of this or other mythological terms (excluding "demon" and "Rahab," on which see below). His claim of a demythologizing tendency in OG Isaiah (pp. 160-98) is not supported by the results of this present analysis, as will become evident. 35 Hans Wildberger {Isaiah 1-12: A Commentary [trans. T. H. Trapp; Continental Commen- taries; Minneapolis: Fortress, 1991] 285) discusses the textual evidence for this particular rendering</page><page sequence="9">222 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 66, 2004 word with the "equivalent" Hellenistic one. Indeed, "Hades" has a long history of usage in Hellenistic mythology.36 When the Jewish audience heard this Greek word, did they hear "Sheol" or the Hellenistic analogues of the word? I believe that the fact that it is not transliterated is important for hearing the Hellenistic connotations when "Hades" is used in the LXX, and in OG Isaiah in particular. 2. "The Pit." There is greater flexibility in the translation of "pit" into equivalent Greek concepts, but the mythological context present in the Hebrew text is clearly retained (-113, Isa 14:15, 19 [tr-Hln]; 24:22 [Vorl 1/2; tr-Hb]; 38:18 [tr-Hb]; √çT√≠D, 24:17, 18 [tr-Hb]). The multiple options for Isa 24:22 are best explained by the possible reading of "rock" 0*12$) in the Vorlage.31 Another possibility, although less likely, is that, since the passage does not have an overtly mythological context, it was rendered in a similar, nonmythological manner. The use of "Hades" for "T13 in both 14:19 and 38:18 clearly accentuates the Helle- nistic milieu, as argued in the previous section with reference to "Sheol." The translator seems to have had difficulty with nnttf and/or its immediate context, as demonstrated by the nonliteral translation of both verses, Isa 38:17; 51:14 [not-und, mistr]). 3. Summary. The terms for the netherworld in the Hebrew Vorlage are repre- sented by equivalent Greek terms for the Hellenistic netherworld. The lack of transliteration adds support to the idea that the ancient Near Eastern context is not in the forefront of the translator's intent, but rather that the translator's purpose is to communicate the context in a new milieu, a Hellenistic one. B. Mythological Creatures 1. Wild animals and possible names of deities or demigods. Several refer- ences to animals are translated by "siren" aeipfjv: Isa 13:21 ("daughters of ostriches," mST 0133); 34:13 and 43:20 ("jackals," CT3n) [all: tr-Hln].38 The term "demon," √¥a√≠^uov, is also used: 13:21 ("satyrs," D^TnZ?); 34:14 ("wild animals," ‚ñ°'"S√ä); 65:11 ("Fortune," "73; in parallel with "Fortune" [t')xt|] for and concludes "without a doubt" that "Sheol" was the original reading and that the textual corruption entered because of unspecified "dogmatic concerns." Note that if more than one option is given in the parentheses, the most likely one, in my opinion, will be listed first. 36 See Edwin Hatch and Henry A. Redpath, A Concordance to the Septuagint and the Other Greek Versions of the Old Testament (2d ed.; Grand Rapids: Baker, 1998) 24; and LSJ, 21, s.v. '√Ä√îT1√á or ot√îT|√ß. 37 See 2 Kgs 18:17; Isa 24:17, 18 (2*); Jer 48 [31 LXX]:28, 43 (?), 44 (2x) for examples of this same rendering in Greek. A 2 could be easily confused with a 22. 38 The phrase "daughters of ostriches" (nDy ni33) is rendered by the nonmythological phrase "daughters of sparrows" (Guyar√©pE√ß axpouGcov) in Isa 43:20.</page><page sequence="10">OLD GREEK OF ISAIAH 223 "Destiny," "OD) [all: tr-Hln].39 Of course, both terms have a long history in Hellenistic mythology.40 Different translations for the four occurrences of D*On ("jackals") may indi- cate whether the translator believed that the surrounding passage was mythologi- cal or not. For example, its occurrences in 34: 13 and 43:20 mentioned above were taken mythologically, while the other two were rendered by other types of animals, "hedgehogs" (√®%√Ævoi, 13:22) and "roosters" (√≤pv√©cov, 35:7) - [both Vorl 2]. The translator is the first, at least in the extant literature, to use "donkey- centaurs," √≤voK√©vTccDpoi (13:22 [cf. "hyenas," in lQIsaa]; 34:11 [= "stones of chaos," VO *038]; and 34:14 bis [cf. "Lilith/s," n"√í"√í; nV√í'''? in lQIsa¬Æ, and "hyenas," in lQIsa"])- [all: tr-Hln].41 Two texts discuss "familiar spirits," (8:19; 19:3; D*0117"Pil in lQIsaa). In both cases OG Isaiah renders "gluttonous ones" to√π√ß √®yyaaTpi- |x√≠)0ou√ß, and in both verses this phrase is paralleled by "the fathers" (rTOXH; rTD'Wn in lQIsaa - typically translated "the ghosts") and rendered "those calling out from the earth," to√π√ß √®ie tfj√ß yfj√ß (pcovouvia√ß, in the OG [tr-Hb, tr-Hln]. Fur- ther study of "familiar spirits" is necessary to evaluate properly whether these entities are portrayed in ancient Near Eastern or in Hellenistic terms, or in a 39 In Isa 13:21, D"^ is rendered by "wild animals" (0T|pia), enhancing the use of "demon" in 34:14. "VX7E7 occurs four times in the Hebrew Bible (Lev 17:7; 2 Chr 11:15; Isa 13:21; 34:14). The first two occur in the context of sacrificing to false gods: the OG uses jiaxaio√ß ("vanity") in Lev 17:7 and in 2 Chr 11:15. In the third reference, Isa 13:21, "demon" is used; in the fourth, Isa 34:14, the word is not translated as a distinct term. The word √¥aiji√≥viov also appears in Isa 65:3 as an additional clarification not present in the Hebrew, and Saijicov occurs in 65:11 (see below); IT√ú occurs in neither case. Baer notes that "Saiƒºioviov is rare in those LXX books that are translated from the Hebrew Bible. For this reason, the four occurrences in Isaiah stand out disproportionately" (When We All Go Home, 176). However, in his discussion he emphasizes the occurrence in 65:3 and does not account for the important evidence from the other three verses, which do not support his claim of demy thologizing . The translation technique is clear in the case of the deities Fortune and Destiny: "The names of these Semitic gods were probably not familiar to Alexandrian Jews, and so the translator replaced these names with the Greek words for 'demon' and 'fate,' both of which could be understood as names for deities. With this technique, the translator managed not only to clarify the meaning of the text, but also to contemporize it" (Jobes and Silva, Invitation to the Septuagint, 22). 40 See LSJ, 365, s.w. √¥ai^i√≥viov, √¥a√≠^icov; ibid., 1588, s.v. Leipfƒºv. 41 The term √≤voK√©viaDpo√ß is found only in OG/LXX Isaiah and in the second- or third-century c.E. writer Aelianus De Natura Animalium 17.9, according to LSJ, 1232. It is a "neologism" according to the LEH lexicon (J. Lust, E. Eynikel, and K. Hauspie, A Greek-English Lexicon of the Septuagint [2 vols.; Stuttgart: Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, 1992-96] 2. 333). See the discussions and often differing assessments of these various Hebrew terms and their Greek counterparts by Wildberger, Isaiah 1-12; idem, Isaiah 13-27 : A Continental Commentary (Continental Commentaries; Minneapolis: Fortress, 1997); and Blenkinsopp, Isaiah 1-39; idem, Isaiah 40-55: A new translation with introduction and commentary (AB 19A; New York: Doubleday, 2002); idem, Isaiah 56-66 : A new translation with introduction and commentary (AB 19B; New York: Doubleday, 2003).</page><page sequence="11">224 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 66, 2004 manner common to both. What is clear is the OG's retention of the mythological context in the verse. The translator of OG Isaiah does not seem to be aware of a mythological creature called "Rahab," as evidenced by Isa 30:7 and 51:9. In the first verse, "Rahab who sits still" (rQK? Dil am; nattf Dn√°m in lQIsaa) becomes "This one is your encouragement" (r' 7capccKA,r|ai√ß ')ƒºjxov cc√≠&gt;tt|) [mistr, Vori l].42 This is consistent with the lack of ancient Near Eastern and Hellenistic parallels for a particular entity called "Rahab" or something linguistically similar.43 The second verse is best explained by parablepsis or homoioarkton, either in the Vorlage or in the OG; the first line of 5 1 : 10 is identical to the beginning of the missing phrase from 51:9: naT√ÆDn NV√Æ J1X Klb√Æl [Vori l].44 OG Isaiah seems to be following a Hebrew text that does not unambiguously contain this mythological element. The translator of OG Isaiah seems to have been aware that Asherim are wooden poles (17:8; 27:9), but chose to convey the concept of typical trees by using "their trees," √¥√©v√¥pa a√πi≈ìv, rather than transliterate the word to indicate the name of the goddess associated with it, as one would expect if such a meth- odology were employed [Vorl 2]. The translators of other books (Deuteronomy, Judges, Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles) used the common term aXao√ß, "grove, sacred grove."45 In addition, Aaxaptri is used to transliterate the names of the deity represented in Hebrew by mttfN and nnni27X7 in Judg 2:13; 1 Kgs 11:5 [6 LXX], 33; 2 Kgs 23:11; 2 Chr 15:16. That other terms were deemed appropriate by the translators of these books highlights the use of the general term √¥√©v√¥pa, "trees," in OG Isaiah. The transliteration of "Bel" in Isa 46:1 demonstrates that the translator did choose at times to transliterate the names of deities without providing a translation [trlit]. It is likely that Bel was a well-known deity; Herodotus, for example, states clearly that Bel is the god of Babylon (Hist. 1.7.2, 1.181, 7.61.3). The issue is less clear for the deity Dagon, used in this same verse for the god Nabu [tr-Hln (?), mist (?)]. Although Dagon is known in the Hebrew Bible as the god of the Philistines, it is unclear how he is related to either Bel or Nabu. If the OG changes ia3 to Aaycov, this may indicate that the name of the deity is being clarified for the audience. However, there is no evidence to suggest why this connection should be made. Indeed, not only is Nabu a common deity in the ancient Near East, being the Babylonian god of writing, but the name is used frequently in 42 There seems to be confusion over the two roots 3m and 3111 in the Hebrew of lQIsaa. This confusion may lie behind the reading in Isa 30:7, if "encouragement" was seen as appropriate for "make wide" (from the root D√≠l")). See Isa 3:5, which uses TcpoaK√ìrcico, "to strike against, to stumble," to render Drn, "to act against; to act arrogantly." 43 So K. Spronk, "Rahab," DDD, 684. Cf., however, LXX Job 26:12, which renders DPH by Kfjxo√ß, which indicates that such a connection existed at the time of the translation of Job into Greek. 44 Baer ( When We All Go Home, 170-71) notes this text-critical possibility but favors the suppression of the mythological context, in line with his larger demythologizing argument. 45 See Hatch-Redpath, 59, for a list of verses and further details.</page><page sequence="12">OLD GREEK OF ISAIAH 225 Babylonian personal names.46 The deity and its temple are also explicitly men- tioned in an Aramaic letter from Egypt.47 As for Dagon, it is well attested that he was connected with grain but not with wisdom or writing.48 Moreover, since Aquila changes his text back to Na√üco, it seems that the Hebrew text he was using read 1113; nor is there is any evidence to indicate that ]"√åH1 was present in the Hebrew Vorlage of OG Isaiah. In sum, the context surrounding Bel is clear [trlit], while the factors associated with the representation of Nabu by Dagon cannot be ascertained at this time. 2. Serpents and snake-like creatures. OG Isaiah offers "dragon," √¥pccKovioc, consistently for all three occurrences of Leviathan, ‚Ä¢jmb, in Isa 27:1 [tr-Hb, tr-Hln]. Thus, this entity is clearly separate from "snake," 12?n3, "asp," ¬°7S7QN, and "adder," X7Q2S (rendered by "snake," ocpi√ß, and "asp," √†am√¥e√ß, in 14:29; 30:6; 65:25) [all: Vorl 2, tr-Hb]. Leviathan is not transliterated, but the meaning is conveyed by "dragon." This substitution means, however, that the ancient Near Eastern context behind the word Leviathan is not preserved in OG Isaiah. The other instances of snakes or asps did not suggest overt mythological imagery to the translator of OG Isaiah, who rendered the meaning of the Hebrew text in a straightforward manner. "Seraphim" was apparently a terminus technicus by the time of the trans- lation of OG Isaiah, which transliterates the term (6:2, 6 [trlit]). The most likely explanation for this is the liturgical use of this passage.49 As the straightforward translation of Isa 44:16 clearly demonstrates, the translator knew that the root of the word means "to burn," so the use of transliteration was deliberate. In addi- tion, the translation of the other occurrences of the Hebrew singular form (14:29; 30:6 [Vorl 2, tr-Hb]) by different Greek phrases ("flying snakes," ocpei√ß rceT√ìjievoi, and "flying asps," aarc√≠√¥cov keto^evcov, respectively) shows that, although the 46 A. R. Millard, "Nabu," DDD, 607-10. 47 See text A2.3 Bresciani-Kamil 1, from the late sixth to early fifth century b.c.e., in Bezalel Porten and Ada Yardeni, Textbook of Aramaic Documents from Ancient Egypt: vol. 1, Letters (Jerusa- lem: Hebrew University Press, 1986) 14. J. F. Healey, "Dagon," DDD, 216-19. However, if the apparent association of ]*Q"T with a Philistine fish deity, which is commonly understood to be the case in 1 Samuel 5, is allowed, then a possible connection to another fish deity who also disseminates wisdom and writing can be found in the Babyloniaka by Berossus. On the god in question, Oannes, see the comments by Robert R. Wilson, Genealogy and History in the Biblical World (Yale Near Eastern Researches 7; New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1977) 151-52. This still leaves unexplained how a fish deity and a grain deity were connected or how one deity split into these two distinct manifestations. Blenkinsopp ( Isaiah 40-55, 267) notes the replacement of Nabu with Dagon and offers a possible explanation based on the similarity of the fate of the gods in this passage and in 1 Samuel 5, without attempting to demonstrate any further relationship between the two deities. 49 This explanation has been suggested also for the use of transliteration in designating the other class of heavenly beings as "cherubim" (‚ñ°"'^"Q, xepo')√üi^/v) in every occurrence; see Hatch-Redpath, 1467-68. This was evidently a terminus technicus at a fairly early period in the textual history of the Hebrew Bible.</page><page sequence="13">226 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 66, 2004 translator was aware that the word connotes a snakelike creature, it was probably not on a "word list." The root has three meanings in the Hebrew Bible: to burn, a (venomous) snake,50 and the beings surrounding God's throne, commonly transliterated as "seraphim." From the data presented here and confirmed by Hatch-Redpath,51 we judge that OG Isaiah recognized all three meanings and provided the appropriate equivalent in Greek based on the context of the passage. 3. The "removal" of the divine council. The reading of OG Isa 40:1 -2a has been one of the main arguments urged for a demythologizing tendency in the LXX.52 Some have claimed that the addition of "priests" by the Old Greek was intended to clarify who is the subject of the plural imperatives.53 Scholars gen- erally agree that the original reference of the Hebrew was to a council of heavenly beings, and some claim that this mythological concept was apparently unaccept- able to the translator. There is another explanation, however, that may account for this reading and for the loss of the language of the divine council from OG Isaiah. It should be noted that the Greek reads √≥ Ge√≥√ß, "the God," for "your God," DDT√íN; rmrPiT√íX in lQIsaa. What happened to the possessive suffix? It may be that the Hebrew Vorlage was read as two words: D^Vf H√ñDTI btf, and as a result was interpreted or misunderstood as "God, O priests," D'OrDil bx [Vori 1, emd]. Though such a process of emendation is not at all certain, it is entirely possible and fits the context of the passage without assuming an active demythologizing tendency that is not consistent with the translation technique in the rest of OG Isaiah. 4. Summary. The OG translator is clearly attempting to convey the mytho- logical elements of the Hebrew Vorlage and has not actively removed them in translation. However, transliteration is not usually employed; instead, these con- cepts are rendered in terms that evoke similar images in a Hellenistic milieu. The translator also shows a good measure of flexibility in translation. There does not appear to be a "word list" for these mythological elements, but the translator utilized a variety of equivalent words and phrases for them. C. Specific Ancient Near Eastern Myths 1. Astral phenomena. The use of "dawn-light," √®coacp√≥po√ß, in Isa 14:12 in reference to a being (in this case, "Helel ben Shachar," "√é√éTO is 50 See Num 2 1 :6 and Deut 8: 1 5 for its occurrence in the familiar account of the "fiery serpents" in the wilderness. The "burning" bite of a snake may lie behind the use of the root "ƒºHE? for a snake. 51 On the variety of Greek words used to translate these three concepts, see Hatch-Redpath, 173, 348, 457, 460, 705, 732, 1004, 1042, 1245. 52 On the related concepts of anthropomorphism and anthropopathism, see n. 21 above. 53 See Blenkinsopp, Isaiah 40-55, 178-80, for a brief history of this interpretative issue.</page><page sequence="14">OLD GREEK OF ISAIAH 227 unique [tr-Hln].54 All previous Greek literature uses this word to refer literally to the planet Venus.55 This use in OG Isaiah is the only occurrence of the word in a mythological passage that discusses a rebellion against other gods. It is signi- ficant that the term is not transliterated. 2. Selected names of God. The translation of God (or simply El, by o')pa- v√≥√ß occurs in the LXX only in Isa 14:13. Typically, 0e√≥√ß or K√öpio√ß is used. Why use something different here? Is the ancient Near Eastern context of the hymn being suppressed, and if so, is it intentional? Or is it simply the association of the deity and its dwelling place, in this case one evoked by the mention of stars in the text? A thorough treatment of Isaiah 14 in the OG is necessary before any certain conclusions can be drawn on this unique reading of OG Isaiah [both tr-Hln and emd as possibilities].56 The translation, and not transliteration, of Elyon in 14:14 reveals that the translator was attempting to communicate the meaning of the passage rather than the strict ancient Near Eastern background of the text [tr-Hln]. This rendering extends beyond OG Isaiah into the rest of the LXX; it may not have been an innovation by OG Isaiah, but was probably already present in the Old Greek of the Pentateuch.57 However, Elyon is obviously viewed as a title for Yhwh by the time of the OG Isaiah translation, though not one that requires consistent trans- literation, as does "hosts," IT1√ç02, by occ√üacoG.58 54 The translation of "dawn," "111127, by "gifts," Scopa, in 8:20 can be explained by a confusion of letters: reading "711127 for 111127; cf. Isa 1:23, where H1E7 is indeed rendered by √¥≈ìpa. Thus, the translator was rendering the text correctly according to the way he understood the letters; he was not demythologizing. 55 Homer II. 23.226; Hesiod Theog. 38 1 ; Pindar Isthm. 4(3).24; Ibycus PLG 42; Plato Tim. 38D; Eudoxus Ars astronomica 5.2. In some texts, the term also has an astronomical, but not mythological, significance. Such a treatment is beyond the scope of this article; a thorough study of the Taunt Song in Isa 14:4-21 must be undertaken separately. See, for now, the extensive discussion of the Hebrew text by Wildberger {Isaiah 13-27, 40-77), who provides excellent background and analysis of the chapter. is often, but not always, translated by "Most High," ')'j/√≠axo√ß. Hatch-Redpath (1420- 21) lists the following as exceptions: in reference to rooms in a building in Neh 3:25 and Jer 36:10 [43:10 LXX], and to a gate in 2 Chr 23:20. All the occurrences of ƒº*l",lPS7 in reference to God in the Hebrew Bible are translated by w√≠ctto√ß in the LXX. The Hebrew term is never transliterated. 58 mi02¬£ is transliterated by aa√üatoG in 49 of the 64 occurrences in Isaiah: 1:9, 24; 2:12; 3:1; 5:7, 9, 16, 24; 6:3, 5; 8:18; 9:6; 10:16, 24, 33; 13:4, 13; 14:22, 24; 17:3; 18:7 (2*); 19:4, 12, 16, 20, 25; 21:10; 22:5, 12, 14 (first occurrence), 15, 25; 23:9; 25:6; 28:5, 22, 29; 29:6; 31:4; 37:16, 32; 39:5; 44:6; 45:13; 47:4; 48:2; 51:15; 54:5. The cases where it is not so transliterated are: 3:15; 22:14 (second occurrence only; second half of both verses containing the term are missing); 14:23 (haplography: phrase is repeated at end of 14:23 and beginning of 14:24); and it is simply missing in 8:13; 9:12, 18; 10:23, 26; 14:27; 19:17, 18, 20; 24:23; 31:5.</page><page sequence="15">228 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 66, 2004 3. The Rephaim - "Shades " and " Giants . " The translation of rƒõpƒè√≠m, CTNQ1, by "giants," o√≠ y√≠yaviE√á, in Isa 14:9 deserves special attention.59 Two other occur- rences of DUNƒíTI in Isaiah show that the translator was aware of the basic meaning of the root (26:14, "physicians," iccxpo√≠; and 26:19, "healing," icc^loc [Vorl 2]). In addition, "in the valley of Rephaim" in 17:5 is not transliterated, but is trans- lated "in the solid valley," √®v (p√°payyi axepBOt [mistr, Vorl 1]. This is atypical of the LXX as a whole, which transliterates both Rephaim and their valley repeat- edly.60 The root had three meanings in the Hebrew Bible: (1) to heal; (2) the name of a valley; and (3) in reference to "shades'Vthe dead. The evidence from Hatch-Redpath indicates that the LXX as a whole renders the term in four cat- egories: (1) to heal; (2) the name of a valley; (3) mythological beings taken from the myth of the Giants/Titans - this instead of rendering rƒõp&amp;√≠m with equivalent Greek terms more closely related literally to "shades" or "dead"; and (4) by transliteration.61 That the translators of other LXX books used transliteration demon- strates that the translator of OG Isaiah was not required, for whatever reason, to use "giants," oi y√≠yavte√ß, in 14:9. Thus, OG Isaiah not only retains the mythological context of the passage in Isaiah 14 (as already noted above) but also renders this term by one that has significant Hellenistic overtones. The translators of the OG and the LXX as a whole knew that ‚ñ°''N√ñ") had a mythological context that they often rendered in Hellenistic terminology when the passage suggested this meaning, but this practice was not consistent. Furthermore, it is clear that the term was not on a "word list." The "giants" among the Philistines, such as Goliath,62 may have contributed to the use else- where in the LXX of titccv or y√≠yoc√ß,63 terms that have long histories in 59 Wildberger {Isaiah 13-27, 60-61) takes note of this rendering by the OG and of the portrayal of the Rephaim as "being particularly tall" in Deut 3:11. Blenkinsopp {Isaiah 1-39, 287-88) also notes the connection with Deut 3:11, but without any discussion of the Greek translation. Both authors explore the possible Ugaritic parallels without further attention to the mythological rendering of the Greek text. 60 Rephaim: Gen 15:20; Deut 2:11, 20, 3:11, 13. Valley of Rephaim: Josh 15:8; 18:16; 2 Sam 23:13. Exceptions to this are: 2 Sam 5:18, 22 ("the valley of the Titans," KOiX√°√îa/KoiX√°√¥i t√¥v Tix√°vcov) and 1 Chr 11:15, 14:9, 13 ("in the valley of the Giants," √®v rp KoiX√°√¥i t√¥v yiyccvTcov). The Philistines are mentioned in the contexts of all these verses, which is consistent with, and perhaps related to, the data presented in the following two notes. 61 Transliteration (Pacpa) is used in 2 Kgs 21:16, 18, 20, 22 || 1 Chr 20:8. All these instances are in reference to the slaying of giants by David and by his men. For the different Greek words used, see Hatch-Redpath, 256, 668-69, 1248. 62 See the association of Gath with giants in 2 Sam 21:20, and of the Anakim (descendants of the Nephilim [‚ñ°"√íSD] according to Num 13:33; to√π√ß y√≠yavxa√ß in the LXX) with Gath in Josh 11:22. This tradition may help to explain the existence of the giant Goliath of Gath among the Philistines in 1 Sam 17:4. 63 For y√çYcc√ß, "giant," see Gen 6:4; 10:8 ( || 1 Chr 1:10); 10:9; Num 13:33; Deut 1:28; 2 Sam 21 : 1 1; Ps 19:5 [18:6 LXX]; 33: 16 [32: 16 LXX]; Jdt 16:6; 1 Macc 3:3; Sir 16:7; 47:4; Wis 14:6; 3 Macc 2:4. For ra√°v, "Titan," see 2 Sam 5:18, 22; Jdt 16:6.</page><page sequence="16">OLD GREEK OF ISAIAH 229 Hellenistic mythology.64 The use of y√≠ya√ß in Isa 14:9 in a myth about rebellion supports the suggestion that the translator may have had in mind some form of the myth of the Watchers developed from Gen 6:4, which is present also in 1 Enoch and Jubilees.65 In the context of Isa 26:14 and 19, the use of mythological elements to represent might be expected. However, the OG rendering indicates that this term was not always taken to indicate a group of mythological beings, even when the context would suggest it. As noted above, the translator understands the word in Isaiah 26 to be associated with the root KQ*"1, "to heal." This confirms that it was an intentional choice of the translator to represent the mythological component in the other occurrences, since evidently he was not automatically bound to do so; he was able to adhere to his own understanding of each passage. 4. Summary. In these instances, OG Isaiah seems to borrow terminology common to Hellenistic mythology and adapts Greek astronomical vocabulary to a text apparently containing ancient Near Eastern mythology. In both of these cases, and in the ambiguous case of 14:13-14, the lack of transliteration and the intentional use of such Hellenistic concepts speak against the translator's inten- tion to maintain the text's explicitly ancient Near Eastern context, and thus favor a closer study of the new Hellenistic context of the OG. In no instance are these particular mythological elements deleted or flagrantly demythologized. Conclusion 1. The translator of OG Isaiah clearly did not delete the mythological ele- ments from the text; he represented the mythological elements in his Hebrew Vorlage, in the majority of cases, by using similar concepts from the Hellenistic mythological milieu. This indicates an intention to communicate the meaning of the text to the audience in equivalent terminology without slavishly reproducing the exemplar. 2. The remaining cases where the ancient Near Eastern mythological context is apparently retained demonstrates that a systematic "revision" of the text was 64 For more on the Hellenistic tradition, see G. Mussies, "Giants," DDD, 343-45; and idem, "Titans," DDD, 872-74. Mussies points out that, according to Hesiod Theog. 183- 86, the Titans were "the serpent-footed giants who were born from the blood-drops of the castration of Uranus that had fallen on Earth." However, Mussies makes the same summary mistake that was made by some Hellenistic authors: Titans were often confused with Giants. Only the Giants have serpent-feet, according to most versions of the myth. Nevertheless, it is easy to see that the terms are more or less interchangeable, both in the OG/LXX and in Hellenistic literature in general. Significantly, this myth connects serpents (emphasized in both Hebrew and OG Isaiah), rebellion against the gods, and sexual intercourse between heaven and earth. It could easily have been understood in light of the myth of the Watchers. 65 As remarked by Stanley E. Porter and Brook W. R. Pearson, "Isaiah through Greek Eyes: The Septuagint of Isaiah," in Writing and Reading the Scroll of Isaiah: Studies of an Interpretative Tradition (ed. C. C. Broyles and C. E. Evans; VTSup 70.2; Leiden: Brill, 1997) 531-46, here 541.</page><page sequence="17">230 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 66, 2004 not the goal. The concepts must still have held meaning within the Hellenistic, or at least the Jewish-Hellenistic context of the translator and/or the audience. What was of prime importance was conveying the meaning, rather than the exact literal contents, of the Hebrew Vorlage. By pursuing that objective, OG Isaiah func- tioned well within its Hellenistic milieu. 3. There is no evidence that any of these mythological elements were utilized to engage in "actualizing exegesis." Although these terms often occur in pro- phetic oracles, there is no evidence that they were construed by the translator as references to new historical realities. This analysis does not directly refute van der Kooij's proposal, but neither does it give any support to it. 4. Transliteration was used for some words, but apparently not because these were incomprehensible to the translator. Rather, transliteration appears to be used when a term had acquired a particular meaning prior to the translation - as, for example, in the case of a deity's name or of liturgical usage. 5. Finally, at least in respect to the mythological elements, OG Isaiah may be termed a "rather free translation" insofar as it is not slavishly literal but is faithful to the meaning of the parent text ; but it is not "rather free" in the sense that the translator paraphrased or changed what he understood to be the meaning of the parent text. This distinction in techniques of translation is made clear in the presentation of mythological elements in OG Isaiah. The translator attempts to convey the meaning of the ancient Near Eastern mythology in terms a Hellenistic audience would understand. This analysis of mythological elements corresponds to and supports other analyses of OG Isaiah that emphasize the integrity of the translation in conveying the meaning of the text in a responsible manner. There is no reason to berate or belittle OG Isaiah in regard to its treatment of mythological elements. The trans- lation technique utilized was a complex one for a complex book; it attempted to convey the meaning of the text to an audience significantly different from the one to which the Hebrew Vorlage had spoken authoritatively in the past.</page></plain_text>
