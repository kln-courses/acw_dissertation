C. HOLL Abstract The research presented in this paper aims to study the transfer of patterns of social behaviours into mortuary contexts. It is an attempt to bring to light nested levels and conflicting aspects of human social actions during the relatively short time represented in the Houlouf archaeological record. Different parameters of mortuary evidence are consid ered at different levels of structuration using competing or alternative models to make sense of the diversity, variability and patterns observed. The studied cemetery appears to have emerged during a period of tension between competing peer-polities and to have been used for the inhumation of a small elite fragment of the whole society. This elite was composed of four groups interpreted as 'descent groups'. Individuals belonging to this elite were divided into three main ranked occupational categories, and they were probably buried by a craft specialist; a blacksmith acting as undertaker and grave-digger.

Introduction: aims and purposes This paper aims to explore the dynamics of the past society of Houlouf during a relatively short period of settlement history represented in the archaeological sequence. The present</page><page sequence="2">134 Augustin F. C. Holt enquiry will be based on mortuary data recorded during a long-term field programme which lasted from 1982 to 1991. A detailed study suggests some interesting patterns which are linked to both intra and inter-settlement dynamics of the Houlouf society. Due to the relative contexiual in?egri?y of mortuary data (O'Shea 1984), it is possible to discuss some of the issues concerning a wide array of the dynamics of thai vanished social sysiem and io presenl some testable propositions based on a sound empirical footing. Today, archaeological study of mortuary data covers a broad spectrum of topics (Binford 1971; Alexander 1979; Bloch 1971; Brown 1981; Chapman 1977; Chapman et al. 1981; Eschli mann 1985; Hodson 1979; Humphreys and King 1981; Orton and Hodson 1981; O'Shea 1981, 1984, 1987, 1989; Pearson 1984; Sheppard 1979; Tainter 1975; Thomas 1978, 1980). According to O'Shea (in press), the promise of in-depth analysis of past social systems, which was anticipated from the renewed archaeological sludy of funerary coniexis in ?he 1970s, has in a ceriain sense faded; and ?he narrowness of curreni research goals ihreaiens io undermine ?he archaeological usefulness of numerous mortuary sludies. Yet, despite the promise of those original studies, and very real advances in the application of archaeological mortuary theory, mortuary studies have not lived up to their broader potential. The incredible richness of the funerary context has all too often been ignored in the single minded rush to detect 'ranking1 and to assign past societies to particular culture-evolutionary slots. This narrowness of purpose has, in turn, fostered an emphasis on the analysis of single mortuary sites (O'Shea, in press: 1). To redress the balance, sludies of funerary adivines have to be integra?ed wiihin a iheoreiical framework modelled after the dynamics of past social systems. In this regard, mortuary behaviour is betier considered as a dynamic elemeni in ?he social life of commu nities. These behaviours differentially influence and are in iheir turn influenced by the changing political, symbolic and socio-economic circumstances experienced by members of the society. If studies of mortuary remains are integrally combined with the analysis of other components of the archaeological record, it is possible to achieve a better understand ing of the historical trajectories of past societies. In this paper, we will focus on the why of the emergence of cemeteries in the souihern plain of the Chad basin and the social ^meanings' of different kinds of patierns in the mortuary record observed; the investigation will consider different archaeological para meters of mortuary behaviour such as ?he na?ure of burial facilities, the patterns of disposal of the dead, the distribution of grave-goods, and the spatial organization of the cemeiery of Houlouf. We will a??emp? to disclose the staius of ?he deceased and model iheir muiual in?eraclion ai differenl scales of the actual Houlpuf community in its regional setting. Houlouf: settlement and location Houlouf, the central setilemeni of a former district of the Logone kingdom recorded by nineieenth-century European explorers (Denham et al. 1826; Barth 1857-1859; Nachtigal 1987; Lebeuf 1969), is located in the southern part of ?he Chad plain al 12? 02' N., 14? 55' E., on the shore of the Malingwa, an intermi?len? siream (Fig. 1). It is a large mound site, subcircular in shape and covering an area of 15.9 ha. The setilemeni is characterized by the presence of the remains of an impressive earthen wall which had six gates. The study area of 400 km2 is divided into two ecological microzones: the grasslands of the</page><page sequence="3">The cemetery of Houloufin northern Cameroon (AD 1500-1600) 135 Madana Kab? Figure f 1 Land above flood level Flooded area Ponds and marsh (Toponymes of mound sites) ?3 Intermittent streams 1 The study area: physiography and distribution of mound sites. Permanent settlement O Seasonal settlement hinterland which are flooded during rainy seasons, and the tree-savanna zone on land situated above the flood level; Houlouf settlement is located in this last microzone. Human settlements in this part of the Chad plain result from a long process of colonization which started during the Middle Holocene when the former Megachad retreated from the Maidu guri-Bama-Limani-Bongor ridge at 320 m above sea level to its present shoreline at 282 m. The data at hand suggest that colonization of our study area has started ca 2000 BC. From that time, human settlement expanded and the whole landscape was progressively dotted with sites (David 1980; Connah 1981; Griaule and Lebeuf 1948, 1950, 1951; Lebeuf 1969, 1981; Lebeuf et at. 1980; Lebeuf and Holl 1985; Holl 1987, 1988a, 1988b, 1989, 1990; Holl et al. 1989, 1991; Rapp 1984). It is therefore axiomatic that mortuary behaviour will have to be studied with due consideration of site-location strategies and the dynamics of settlement expansion generated by the changing climatic parameters and demography. Excavation, context and dating The excavation unit, located in the north-western quadrant of the still-inhabited settle ment, covers 104 m2. The archaeological sequence recorded measures 4 m, with eight occupation levels dating from ca AD 500 to the present, with an occupation gap which</page><page sequence="4">136 Augustin F. C. Holl may have lasted for 100 to 200 years (AD 1300/1400 to AD 1500). The cemetery was uncovered at a depth of 0.60 m, and belongs to occupation level VII, in what appears to be a structured domestic space (Fig. 2). The excavated surface was divided into five activity-areas: a) a cemetery with 30 structures (Fig. 3); b) a domestic area located in the south-western part of the excavated unit, with seven complete pots, six complete jars (1, 2, 3, 4, 10 and 44), one truncated jar (6) used as supporting device for conical-base vessels, one hearth (88) and a storage pit (41) which was later used for refuse; c) a smith's workshop located in the north-eastern corner with one furnace (39), one forge hearth (38) and an ordinary horse-shoe shaped hearth (89); d) a shrine area with one small shallow ashy hearth (45), one complete and one truncated jars (7 and 9) and one peculiar installation composed of five nested truncated jars (8), the shrine installation, and e) a salt making area with a portion of thick fire-hardened layer (40) next to an ashy shallow hearth (90), and a filtering installation (5) composed of three elements: one pot, one truncated jar used as supporting device and one filtering whole-mouth pot. Due to the sharp break in the distribution of potsherds, it seems that there was a wall along the south-eastern line of jars, thus suggesting that the south-eastern corner of the excavation in which one tomb was uncovered (42), was part of another domestic unit. In terms of space allocated to activities performed in the domestic space, the graveyard covers 38.50 m2, the domestic area 31.75 m2, the smith's workshop 10 m2, the shrine area 8.75 m2, and the salt making area 4 m2. Due to the relatively small size of the excavation and in comparison with the size of present-day domestic space, it is certain that only a small part of the habitation area has been exposed and the excavated sample appears to be situated on the edge of a larger habitation complex. Nevertheless, in this small window opened on the past, the largest portion of the space appears to have been devoted to the graveyard, followed by the domestic area. In terms of dating, the occupation of Level VII occurred between AD 1500 and AD 1600 after 100 to 200 years of abandonment of the settlement, due to adverse climatic conditions which extended over the whole Chad basin (Maley 1980). In the Houlouf archaeological record, from the earliest Level I to Level VI, the dead were buried in extended positions within the domestic space without any recorded spatial clustering. Consequently, the emergence of formal disposal areas for the dead which appears to have taken place along with the process of re-settlempit after the occupation gap observed in the archaeological sequence, may have been used as a symbolic device in attempts to root the actual Houlouf community in the landscape and take exclusive control of the land (Saxe cited by Chapman 1977; Holl 1988b, 1989). Disposal of the dead and burial facilities The graveyard contains 30 structures: one of them (St. 19) located at the centre of the cemetery was termed the Central Monument, four of the structures are empty jars (St. 15, 25, 28 and 33) and 25 are burials. The Central Monument is composed of three nested elements: one large elongated pot with a conical base in upside-down position, supporting</page><page sequence="5">The cemetery of Houlouf in northern Cameroon (AD 1500-1600) 137 157 ST?^" A? ?iftw: @0.0 ?

As will be demonstrated later, this monument appears to have served as the organizing principle of the spatial layout of the tombs in the cemetery. Empty jars are symbolic tombs for those who died elsewhere or in foreign lands, as suggested by ethnographic record collected among some Chadic-speakers of the Mandara Mountains (David 1990) and the Garoua region (Gauthier 1990). Among the 25 tombs, the same system of disposal of the dead was used. The deceased were buried in a deep pit measuring in average 1.0 m in diameter, depths varying from 1.6 to 2.0 m, almost upright and sitting on a pile of earth, in 22 cases with their feet in pots (Tab. 1). The faces of the deceased were oriented to the south-west, like the Central Monument. Large jars were the main components of the burials' facilities and they were used as 'tombstones', disposed at 20-50 cm above the heajds of the deceased. There are two burials with three jars each (11 and 12), six tombs (13, 14, 16, 17, 18 and 43) and one symbolic burial (33) with two jars each (Fig. 5), the remainder with one jar each, 18 burials (20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 34, 35/36, 37, 50 and 56) and three symbolic tombs (15, 25 and 28) (Fig. 6). In terms of spatial distribution, all the tombs with two and three jars are confined to the southern half of the cemetery, in two distinct clusters: a 'tighter' one in the south-east and a 'looser' one in the south-west. With the exception of burial 14, all the multiple-jars burials have pots for the feet. A closer look at the spatial distribulion of burial facilities shows a pattern of parallel and alternating bands of tombs with pots and those withoui. The different patterns of spatial organisation of the cemetery suggested by these observations will be examined later. At this point of our discussion,</page><page sequence="7">The cemetery of Houlouf in northern Cameroon (AD 1500-1600) 139 Figure 4 View of the Central Monument of the cemetery. the 'investment1 in terms of burials features and facilities, size of burial pits, number of jars and pots, suggests the action of some clustering principles in need of deeper analysis; however, the homogeneous system of disposal of the dead may be linked to the implementa tion of a particular funerary programme for a specific social segment of the AD 1500-1600 Houlouf community. According to N. David and J. G. Gauthier (personal communication) this kind of burial in a sitting or almost upright attitude is restricted to high-rank individuals, kings, chiefs and high rank elders. The overall homogeneity of the disposal of the dead recorded in the studied cemetery thus suggests the existence of an 'etiquette' for a small fragment of the past Houlouf society; a fraction which had monopolized access to this burial area. Consequently, it appears that all the individuals buried in this cemetery may have belonged to the same large social group of important 'officials' and elders, which may be considered as the elite. The distribution of grave goods The sample of grave-goods uncovered can be divided into two broad categories: goods from local origins and those obtained through exchange with surrounding societies. Goods of local origin are mostly artefacts made from clay: four clay beads uncovered in tombs 13, 22, 26 and 36 and one smoking pipe from tomb 17. (Pots and jars are here considered as burial facilities rather than as grave-goods.)</page><page sequence="8">140 Augustin F. C.

Goods obtained from the north-west include carnelian and glass beads, and copper alloys. One glass bead only was found in tomb 16; 914 carnelian beads were found in twenty tombs and their frequencies vary from 1 in tombs 14 and 56 to 174 in tomb 13. 71 artefacts in copper alloys were found in 16 tombs, their frequencies varying from 1 (tombs 20, 26, 31 and 43) to 12 in tomb 11. Six kinds of artefacts in copper alloys have been recorded: ten leg-guards, six aprons, two arm-bands, thirty one arm-rings, nineteen rings and three bell-shaped objects (Tab. 2). Metallographic analysis</page><page sequence="9">The cemetery of Houlouf in northern Cameroon (AD 1500-1600) 141 Figure 5 View of a burial with two superimposed jars (burial 16). and the presence of copper slag in the Houlouf archaeological record show that copper-alloy artefacts were manufactured locally from imported raw material: ingots and/or worn out objects. It is consequently suggested that the kinds, shapes and size of artefacts in copper alloys were manufactured according to the demands of the users. Conversely, carnelian beads were imported as finished objects and the eight different shapes recorded basically depended on the offer available at the time of procurement. In terms of use and symbols, the grave-goods may be divided into five categories: artefacts of horsemanship (leg-guards and aprons), ceremonial items (arm-bands and arm-rings), personal adornment (rings, bell-shaped items, carnelian, glass and clay beads), entertainment (smoking pipe) and finally, syenite stone from the south-west which may provisionally be considered as symbolizing individual connexions with the south-western exchange network. Horsemanship was and, in varying degrees, still is the monopoly of the elite. It was the exclusive attribute of high rank officials, chiefs, kings and war leaders. The possibility to be connected to a long distance exchange network was probably depend ent on the social position of an individual and the procurement of exotic goods was used as a strategy to reinforce that position and gain prestige. In this perspective it is possible to argue that for an individual, the wider and the more diversified his connexions with</page><page sequence="10">142 Augustin F. C Holl Figure 6 Spatial distribution of burial facilities. inter-regional exchange networks, the easier it was for him to increase his prestige. Con sequently, the degrees of connexion with different exchange networks which may be meas ured by the proportions of goods obtained from the different procurement areas in each burial, can be used as an exploratory device in an attempt to reconstruct the social per sonae of the people buried in the cemetery of Houlouf. In general, with the exception of burials 24 and 37 and the four symbolic tombs, the amount of grave-goods in each tomb varies from 1 (tombs 23, 29, 31 and 56) to 184 in tomb 13 (Tab. 3). Goods from the north-western procurement area are present in twenty tombs: artefacts in copper alloys are attested in fourteen tombs. It appears that all the tombs with copper alloys artefacts have carnelian beads. In tombs with carnelian beads alone, the total amount is small and the frequencies vary from 1 (tomb 14 and 56) to 18 (tomb 18). Goods originating from the south-western procurement area are present in twelve tombs; in general, with the exception of tomb 21, they are attested in assemblages with no (tombs 22 and 29) or small amounts of goods from the north-west. This patterning of grave goods suggests the existence of a nested hierarchy of exchange and procurement networks and consequently of the prestige gained from the connexions established with each of them. The local network does not appear to have been very significant in the patterning of grave-goods and the connexion with the south-western area is superceded by the north-western one. According to oral information collected at Houlouf in 1991, in the past, the normal way to become wealthy and gain prestige was to start from the</page><page sequence="11">The cemetery of Houlouf in northern Cameroon (AD 1500-1600) 143 Table 2 General distribution of grave-goods Burial No NW goods Local goods SW goods Total Copper Carnelian 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 43 50 56 12 5 9 7 1 7 3 4 1 9 115 42 174 I 4* 58 18 11 136 7 15 10 5 134 8 3 42 5 126 1 127 47 184 2 7 64 18 15 141 11 1 17 14 1 ia i 141 13 47 4 7 135 1 *1 glass bead. Mandara and Mora areas, in what was the south-western procurement zone, to capture slaves, then sell them in Bornu, the north-western procurement zone, and finally buy horses, weapons and exotic goods unknown in the local context. In other words, one had to be brave enough to face danger in foreign lands and achieve success, a kind of risky rite de passage. From the perspective outlined by the ethnohistorical record, it is possible to read the patterning of grave-goods from a new and interesting way: the grave-goods appear as evidence of changing social and individual strategies for the accumulation of symbolic and material capital (Bourdieu 1979). The accumulated capital may have been displayed as tactics of distinction in the fabric of the sixteenth-century Houlouf elite. To highlight these tactics, we must return to the cemetery and its spatial organization. The spatial organization of the cemetery At first glance, it appears almost obvious that the Central Monument is located at the centre of the cemetery and its orientation towards the south-west provides the pattern</page><page sequence="12">144 Augustin F. C.

It may thus be considered as symbolizing both the unity and the major principle of ihespatial organization of the graveyard, which may have dictated the location of individual burials relative to each other according to actual patterns of social interaciion. To discover these vanished patierns of social inieraciion, the spatial organizaiion of the Houlouf cemetery has been investigated using competing models. Model I: the rings model This is the most obvious and was considered as relevant during excavation: according to this model, which has several variants, the burials are organized inio conceniric rings around the Central Monument (Fig. 7). Thus, from the Central Monument outwards, the first ring is composed either of six struclures: five burials (18, 20, 26, 31 and 32) and one symbolic tomb (25), or alternaiively of eighi slruc?ures: seven burials (14, 18, 20, 26, 31, 32 and 50) and one symbolic iomb. The second and larger ring is organized in one of ihree ways: in ?he firsi sub-model ihere are eleven slruc?ures: iwo symbolic lombs (15 and 33) and nine burials (13, 17, 23, 27, 30, 34, 35 and 36). In ?he second sub-model ihere are ?hirteen siructures wilh two additional burials (14 and 50). The third sub-model has the same number of slruc?ures as ihe second one, but the alternaiive is beiween lines 33 23-43 and 33-24-21-13. The ihird ring is no? compleie and is composed of two distinci series of struclures: the western one with three burials (28, 29 and 5) and one symbolic tomb (28), and the eastern one with three tombs (11, 12 and 22). Structure 37 does not fit in this spatial organization and if included within the western series, it may seriously distort the spatial struciures of conceniric rings.</page><page sequence="13">The cemetery of Houlouf in northern Cameroon (AD 1500-1600) 145 Figure 7 The rings model. The ring model makes partial sense of the burial record; it appears that each of the rings recorded has at least one symbolic tomb, but the high number of alternatives which are difficult to subsume in an integrated framework are serious shortcomings. If the distri bution of grave-goods is considered, the picture which emerges is one of total confusion. The ring model is thus considered inappropriate. Model II: straight lines models The straight lines models are an alternative to the rings model discussed above and seek to discover the basic structure of the location of burials relative to each other; they are based on the straight lines of maximum connection between neighbouring structures. Following this rationale, there are four straight lines models which emerge: the first based on east-west lines, the second on north?south lines, the third on southeast-northwest lines and the fourth on southwest-northeast lines (Fig. 8). The east-west model is composed of six series of structures: from south to north, series 1 has two burials (11 and 12); series 2, five burials (13, 14, 43 and 50) and one symbolic tomb (15); series 3, six burials (17, 18, 20, 21, 22 and 56); series 4, four burials (23, 24, 26 and 27) and two symbolic tombs (25 and 28); series 5, four burials (29, 30, 31 and 32); and series 6, three burials (34, 35 and 36). Two burials (16 and 37) and one symbolic tomb (33) do not fit in this model. But it is worth noting that the central position of the Monument is supported by the distribution of an equal number of series on both sides. If the distribution of grave-goods is considered, an interesting pattern emerges: series 4</page><page sequence="14">146 Augustin F. C. Holl Figure 8 The straight lines and network models. appears as a line of equal wealth with four rank IV burials; series 1, 5 and 6 have two wealth classes each: one rank II and one rank III burials in the first, one rank II and three rank IV burials in the second, and one rank III and two rank IV burials in the third. And finally, series 2 and 3 have three wealth classes each: respectively, one rank I burial, one rank II, three rank IV burials and one symbolic tomb for the former, and one rank II, one rank III and three rank IV burials for the latter. Even if the pattern emerging from the east-west lines model starts to make a deeper sense of the burial record, the lack of fit for three features generates some doubts about its pertinence; another straight lines model has thus to be considered. The north-south lines model is composed pf eight series with the number of features varying from two to five. From west to east, series 1 has three burials (29, 37 and 56) and one symbolic tomb (28); series 2, four burials (17, 27, 30 and 36), series 3, four burials (18, 26, 31 and 35) and one symbolic tomb (15), series 4, three burials (14, 32 and 34) and the Central Monument (19); series 5, two burials (20 and 50) and one symbolic tomb (25); series 6, three burials (13, 21 and 24) and one symbolic tomb (33); series 7, three burials (11, 43 and 23) and series 8, two burials (12 and 22). If grave-goods are considered, it appears that series 1 and 3 are lines of equal wealth, with respectively three and four rank IV burials and one symbolic tomb. Series 2, 4, 5, 7 and 8 have two wealth classes each: two rank III and two rank IV burials for series 2; one rank II and two rank IV</page><page sequence="15">The cemetery of Houlouf in northern Cameroon (AD 1500-1600) 147 burials for series 4; one rank II and one rank IV burials for series 5; one rank II and two rank IV burials in series 7 and one rank III and one rank IV burials for series 8. Three classes are attested in series 6 with rank I, U and IV burials. With the exception of series 4, the burials with larger amount of grave-goods are located in the southern part of the cemetery, and the lines seem to be organized in terms of decreasing wealth. This patterning is suggestive, but one burial (16) does not fit in it and the fact that the Central Monument, which is considered as the major organizing principle of the cemetery, is included in series 4 raises some doubts about the pertinence of this north-south lines model. Seven series of features have been recorded for the southeast-northwest lines model, their number varying from two to six. Starting from the southwest, series 1 has two rank IV burials (16 and 56); series 2, one rank III burial (17) and two symbolic tombs (15 and 28); series 3 is the line of equal wealth with four rank IV burials (14, 18, 27 and 29); series 4 has three rank IV (26, 30 and 37) and one rank II burials (50); series 5 with the four wealth classes attested, two rank IV (20 and 31) and one burial from each of the other ranks (11, 13 and 36), is the most complete. Series 6 has one symbolic tomb (25), two rank II (21 and 32), one rank III (12) and two rank IV (37 and 43) burials, and finally, series 7 has one symbolic tomb (33) and three rank IV (22, 23 and 34) burials. According to this model, the line of maximum wealth divides the cemetery into two parts with almost the same number of structures: twelve in the south-western portion, eleven in the north-eastern one with two symbolic tombs in each. The observed patterning makes sense of the burial record, the central location of the Monument is supported by the median position of the line of maximum wealth, but one feature (burial 24) does not fit in the model. It is possible to build another southwest-northeast lines model but four burials (11, 12, 16 and 37) do not fit in it; consequently, this last proposal seems to be less reliable. Elementary lines models did not succeed in integrating the burial record within a single coherent spatial model, and consequently the exploration has to be carried out using different kinds of models. Model III: a network model of spatial organization If we combine the four lines models with the rings model, we have a complicated network of features and lines which is at first glance completely meaningless (Fig. 8). If we use nearest-neighbour rationale, some mutually exclusive clusters of features distributed around the Central Monument start to emerge; a south-eastern group with eight features, a south-western one with nine features, a small unit with two features and a loose linear series in the north with ten features. If we add the distribution of grave-goods, it appears that these clusters are organized around some burials (Fig. 9). Consequently, there are four clusters of structures: the south-east (SE) cluster with eight burials: one rank I (13), three rank II (11, 21 and 50), one rank III (12) and three rank IV (20, 22 and 43) burials. The south-west (SVV) cluster has two symbolic tombs (15 and 28), one rank III (17) and six rank IV burials (14, 16, 18, 26, 27 and 56). The north-east (NE) cluster has one rank II (32), three rank IV (23, 24 and 34) and two symbolic burials (25 and 33). And finally, the north-west (NW) cluster has one rank III (36) and five rank IV burials (29, 30, 31,</page><page sequence="16">148 Augustin F. C.

The spatial patterning observed suggests that the people buried in this cemetery may have belonged to four sub-groups, fragments of lineages or descent or occu pational groups. The fabric of the elite The general distribution of grave-goods suggests the existence of five classes of burials (Fig. 10; Tab. 3): there is one rank I burial belonging to the SE cluster with 184 items: 9 copper alloy artefacts, 174 carnelian beads and one clay bead; four rank II burials with</page><page sequence="17">The cemetery of Houlouf in northern Cameroon (AD 1500-1600) 149 % 40 30L 20 10 13 ^20273034 22 I i i i-1 i i I?iiiiiiiiit.lTT ^ca^f^M I II III IV V Rank Figure 10 Hierarchy of burials according to the distribution of grave-goods. their amounts of grave-goods varying from 141 (21 and 32) -to 127 (11). The frequencies of copper alloy artefacis vary from 12 (11) io 4 (21) and carnelian beads from 136 (21) to 115 (11). There is one hammerstone in syenile in the assemblage from burial 21. These rank II burials are attested in the SE and NE clusters, 11,21 and 50 located close to the rank I burial (13). Three rank III burials were recorded; they are distributed in the SE, SW and NW clusters. The amount of grave-goods varies from 64 (17) to 47 (12 and 36), with copper alloy artefacts varying from 5 (12) to 4 (36) and 2(17) and carnelian beads, from 58 (17) to 42 (12 and 36). Burial 17 has three stone artefacts and one smoking pipe. There are fifteen rank IV burials, three in the SE cluster, two in the NE one, six in the SW and four in the NW.The amount of grave-goods varies from one (23, 29, 31 and 56) to 18 (18). Artefacis in copper alloys are attested in seven burials (16, 20, 26, 27, 30, 34 and 43) their frequencies varying from 7 (30) to one (20, 26 and 43); the number of carnelian beads varies from 15 (26) to 3 (16) with an additional glass bead in burial 16. Two rank V burials are devoid of grave-goods, 24 in the NE cluster and 37 in the NW cluster. At this point of our discussion, it is worth highlighting some important patlerns which emerge from the general aspects of the disiribution of grave-goods: with the excep tion of burial 13, the rank I tomb, in the assemblages of grave-goods from rank II and III burials, there is always a reversal in the distribution of copper alloy artefacts relative to carnelian beads; i.e. within the same rank, burials with higher amounts of copper alloy artefacts always have lower amounts of carnelian beads and reciprocally, burials wilh</page><page sequence="18">150 Augustin F. C. Holl higher amounts of carnelian beads always have fewer artefacts in copper alloys. Stone artefacts come only from rank IV burials, with the exception of burials 17 and 21 which belong respectively to rank III and II. In terms of spatial distribution and total amount of grave-goods, the SE cluster with one rank I (13), three rank II (11, 21 and 50) one rank III (12) and three rank IV (20, 22 and 43) burials appears to be the dominant sub-group (Fig. 11a). It is followed by the NE cluster (Fig. lib) with one rank II (32) two rank IV (23 and 34), one rank V (24) and two symbolic burials (25 and 33). The SW cluster, with two symbolic tombs and seven burials comprising one rank III (17) and six rank IV (14, 16, 18, 26, 27 and 56), comes next (Fig. lie), followed by the NW cluster with one rank III (36), four rank IV SE SW % 30 20 10 NE NW % 30 20 10 Figure 11 Hierarchy of burials in each cluster.</page><page sequence="19">The cemetery of Houlouf in northern Cameroon (AD 1500-1600) 151 (29, 30, 31 and 35) and one rank V (37) burials (Fig. lid). The range in the distribution of grave-goods is maximum in the SE cluster (184 - 7), important in the NE cluster (141 - 0), relatively moderate in the SW cluster (64 - 1 ) and minimum in the NW cluster (47 - 0). Procurement strategies and the accumulation of material capital As suggested in our previous discussion on the general distribution of grave-goods, it appears that local items did not play an important role in the patterning of the material capital accumulated by the individuals buried in this cemetery. Items obtained from for eign lands thus seem to have been sought after. In this regard, two procurement zones have been identified: the south-western procurement zone, the Mora and Mandara Moun tains area from which syenite stone was obtained, and the north-western one, the Bornu kingdom, which supplied copper alloys as well as carnelian and glass beads. These goods were not produced in Bornu but were available through an extensive inter-regional exchange network: copper mining and production is attested in the Azelik region of Niger. The sources for carnelian beads are still unknown, but the recent discovery of carnelian bead workshops in the Tilemsi of eastern Mali, attributed to an undated 'Neolithic1 (Gaussen and Gaussen 1988) because stone tools were used to manufacture beads, suggests that carnelian beads may have come from the Tilemsi through inter-regional trade. In terms of distance, both procurement zones are located about 150-200 km from Houlouf. The SE cluster has the maximum amount of almost all categories of grave-goods: 41 artefacts in copper alloys and 616 carnelian beads coming from the north-western procure ment zone, and 8 syenite artefacts from the south-west (Tab. 4; Fig. 12a). The grave-goods from the rank I burial (13) are almost exclusively composed of north-western goods, 9 copper alloy artefacts and 174 carnelian beads. Rank II burials share the same pattern for burials 11 and 50, with respectively 12 and 9 copper alloy items and 115 and 126 carnelian beads. Burial 21 has one syenite item, 136 carnelian beads and only 4 copper alloy artefacts. The rank III burial (12) has five copper artefacts and 42 carnelian beads. Among the three rank IV burials, there are two (20 and 43) with one copper item each, and respectively eleven, five and three carnelian beads and one syenite stone. The remaining burial (22) has seven carnelian and one clay beads and three syenite stones. It appears that there was a hierarchy of exchange networks and procurement strategies, starting from the south-western network and then seeking connexions with the north western one. In this perspective, the individuals buried in the SE clusters may be distrib uted into grades which translate the distribution of grave-goods in terms of connexions with exchange and procurement networks: at the lowest level, there are those who were connected to the south-western network and had started new connexions with the north western one (individuals 20, 22 and 43); those who were partially integrated in the north western network and still needing to emphasize their connections with the south-western one (individual 21) and finally, those fully integrated in the north-western network in which they had been successful in accumulating a large amount of goods (individuals 11, 12, 13 and 50). Using the same research grid, the NE cluster is characterized by greater diversity (Fig. 12b): Individual 32 (rank II burial) was fully integrated in the north-western network as suggested by the presence of seven copper artefacts and 134 carnelian beads.

In the SW cluster (Fig. 12c), individuals 17 (rank III burial), 14 and 27 (rank IV burials) were connected to the north-western and south-western networks but the very small amount of goods from burial 14 suggests that he may have just started.

Holl carnelian beads only, and 26 with one copper item and fifteen carnelian beads. It thus appears thai people buried in the SWr cluster may have been loosely connected with different inter-regional exchange networks. In the NW cluster (Fig. 12d), individual 36 (rank III burial) was integrated in the north-western network as was differentially the case for individuals 31 (copper item only) and 35 (carnelian beads only). Individual 29 had connexions with the south-western net work and 37 had not yet started. The picture which emerges from our discussion so far is one of differential access to exotic goods and diversified strategies for the accumulation of material capital. The mat erial capital accumulated may have been used for display and/or as symbols of social position. The nature of these social positions may now be studied. Translating material into symbolic capital All the bones are so badly preserved that a bio-anthropological study of this material has not been undertaken; consequently sexes and ages of the deceased were established inferentially. All the individuals buried in the cemetery were adults and grave-goods linked to horsemanship are attributed to males. There are eight burials which may be aitributed to males and seventeen unknown. It may also be considered that burials with stone artefacts emphasize the use of this raw material for cooking and craft activities such as pot-making; tombs with such items could possibly be attribuied to females; but the pres ence of such items in three burials with artefacts of horsemanship suggests thai this inter pretation is inappropriate. Items of personal adornment do not clarify this issue because they are not sex-specific. For all these reasons, we consider that all the deceased buried in this cemetery were adult males. The most important point to be considered in this part of the discussion is simply this: a deceased is buried by his kin, allies, friends and/or dependents, sometimes wi?h ihe help of a specialisl. It is these people who have to select what appears to them as the most importani attributes of the various statuses or social positions of the deceased, an indi vidual may be a father or mo.ther, a husband or a wife, a brother or a sister, a commoner or a slave, a warrior, a medicine-man, a chief, a craftsman etc. and may combine some of these different social roles. Consequently, it seems axiomatic that the assemblages of grave-goods recorded, the burial facilities and the location of the burials relative to each other are patterned according to the actual social persona of the deceased, a kind of concatenation of his different staluses and social roles. Grave-goods can be divided into five functional categories: items of horsemanship such as leg-guards and aprons; ceremonial artefacts such as arm-bands, arm-rings, rings and bell-shaped copper items which may have been displayed at specific ceremonies; items of personal adornment such as carnelian, glass and clay beads; one smoking pipe considered as an item of entertainmeni; and syenite stone interpreted as emphasizing connexions with the south-wesiern exchange neiwork and oiher social aspeas which will be explored laier. Ai one end of ihe conlinuum of social positions which can be inferred from the distribu tion of grave-goods, eighl burials belong io horsemen: five (11, 12, 13, 21 and 50) are locaied in the SE cluster, while burials 17 and 34 are located respectively in the SW and NE clusters (Tab. 5).

It appears that horsemen and more generally warriors may have been highly esteemed personalities at Houlouf in AD 1500-1600, where they may have monopolized the highest social positions. The four symbolic tombs may be interpreted as burials of warriors who died in battles far from home. Ceremonial items in copper alloys such as arm-bands and rings, rings and bell-shaped objects are attested in fourteen burials from ranks III to I and distributed among all four burial clusters. Among these burials are six out the eight warriors' tombs. In this situation, these artefacts were probably used for display alongside items of horsemanship. Among the remaining eight burials, classes of ceremonial items vary from three in burial 32 (4 arm-rings, 2 rings and one bell-shaped item) to one in burials 20, 26, 31 and 43</page><page sequence="24">156 Augustin F. C. Holt (respectively an arm-band, one ring in the two following burials and one arm-ring). These items may have been used as symbols of ordinary administrators or 'civil servants', chief of land, head of wards, advisers, etc. who managed daily subsistence, economic and political activities such as distribution of land, settlement of disputes, organization of building and the annual maintenance of the village earthen wall for instance. The distribution of items of personal adornment, essentially carnelian beads, follows the general pattern of distribution of grave-goods among burials (Fig. 12e). They were used as belts in burials 11, 13, 21, 32 and 50, as necklaces in burials 12, 17, 18, 26 and 42, as bracelets in burials 20, 22, 27 and 34 and as pendants in burials 14, 16, 30, 35, 43 and 56. This category of exotic goods appears to have played an intermediate role in the display of symbolic capital on two levels: first as symbolizing the successful passage from the south-western to the north-western exchange network within a competitive social system and, second, as markers of the existing social hierarchy. In this perspective, the quantity of accumulated beads suggests that their procurement may have been highly competitive. Twenty syenite stones from the Mora and Mandara Mountains are attested in the assemblages of grave-goods from twelve burials distributed in ranks II to IV; their number vary from 3 (burials 17, 20 and 22) to one (burials 14, 21, 23, 29, 30, 35 and 43). These burials are distributed among the four clusters: four in the SE, three in the SW and NW, and two in the NE clusters. Apart from the straightforward consideration of provenance and functional attributes such as lower grinding stone, grinder, hammerstones, etc. which are easily accessible to the archaeologist, these imported stones also belong to the realm of belief-systems and, in view of their contexts, are considered as sacred items. A part of this system of beliefs was studied by Lebeuf (1939) in the 1930s. According to this research, these stones are divided into two categories: large and heavy stones (kao), and smaller ones (kagi'n ame melta) which are linked to different social processes such as chiefship, divination, cure, control of the land, and special ceremonies after the birth of twins. At Makari, it is considered that the stones were brought by Muhammed-el-Hadj after a successful military expedition against Kuri raiders from the islands of Lake Chad. At Afade, the right and strength to rule the city is given by a large flat stone, and the chief (Sultan) has to perform a sacrifice and give offerings every third Friday of the month. According to a Kotoko informant interviewed by Lebeuf (1939) it (the stone) is the owner of power; the Kotoko say it speaks even if it does not have a mouth; it is the genuine chief. Nobody is able to raise it, and if any careless individual happens to touch it, he will be sick and will die shortly after if he does not give an offering consisting of one calabash of wild rice and a red cock. If the offering is accepted, then he will recover (Lebeuf 1939:10). At Midigue, stones are used for divination; [and] there are some specifically for males and others for females. For example, a woman wishing to find a husband or to have a child will formulate her wishes to a large stone and then try to raise it from the ground; if she succeeds, she will have what she wants. At Ngala stones are linked to the performance of different kinds of rituals linked to the office of chiefs, and smaller stones are considered as ancestors, many of them having been disposed by the 4Sao' - mythical ancestors of the Kotoko and first settlers of the land.</page><page sequence="25">The cemetery of Houlouf in northern Cameroon (AD 1500-1600) 157 The presence of syenite stone among the grave-goods may thus be interpreted within the wider framework of belief-systems and our previous interpretation may now be contex tualized. Even if we cannot rule out the importance of connexions with the south-western exchange network because the procurement of syenite is the necessary condition of its presence in the Houlouf archaeological record, connexion with this exchange network alone does not seem sufficient to make sense of the mortuary data. In this perspective, the distribution of syenite artefacts between burials may be interpreted as emphasizing differ ent ritual performances and activities such as curing, divination, etc.: individuals with one stone may be considered as performing a narrow range of ritual duties and those with three a larger range. Consequently, at the top of the sub-hierarchy of burials with syenite artefacts, we have three individuals with three stones each: 20 and 22 from the SE cluster, and 17 from the SW one; two individuals with two stones each in the NE (34) and SW (27) clusters and six individuals with one stone each: one in the SE (43), SW (14) and NE (23) and three in the NYV cluster (29, 30 and 35). According to our discussion on the fabric of the elite, three occupational groups emerge: one group of warrior-horsemen at the top of the social hierarchy, followed by that of administrators or 'civil servants' and then a third one of ritual performers; but these occupational groups are not mutually exclusive and the hierarchy is not a static one: warrior-horsemen and ritual-performers are polar extremes with administrators in the middle. While there are single occupations such as administrators and ritual-performers, the position of warrior-horseman is always combined with another one, specifically that of administrator. It thus appears that the possibility of being a warrior-horseman may have been conditioned by prior achievement as an administrator. The fabric of the Houlouf elite thus appears to have been a dynamic and competitive system with achieved rather than ascribed status (Tab. 6), and the fact that there are two burials without grave-goods suggests that the cemetery was not for the exclusive use of specific occupational groups but devoted to a larger portion of the elite, and more specifically some kin or descent groups such as patri-lineages. In the SE cluster, all the eight burials belong to administrators, five belonging to warrior-horsemen/administrators, three to administrators/ritual performers and one (21) to a warrior-horseman/administrator/ritual performer. In the NE cluster, there is one administrator, one ritual performer, one warrior-horseman/administrator/ritual per former, one burial of an individual of unknown occupation and two symbolic tombs. In the SW cluster there are seven administrators, two of them administrators/ warrior-horsemen/ritual performers, one administrator/ritual performer, and two symbolic tombs. Finally, in the NW cluster, there are four administrators, two of them being administrators/ritual performers, one ritual performer, and one individual of unknown occupation. The degree of occupational concentration is greatest in the SE cluster (Tab. 7), and it appears that the concentration of occupations and consequently of power and prestige may have been one of the main reasons of the competition between the members of the sixteenth-century Houlouf elite divided into four patri-lineages. Within each occupational group there was a sub-hierarchy of individuals which may be measured by their accumulated material capital (Tab. 8).

The majority of double or triple-occupation individuals belong to the SE and S VV clusters, while single-occupation individuals are dominant in the NE and NW clusters (Fig. 13). It may thus be considered that the cemetery and its spatial organization was the result of the working of social dynamics on at least three nested structural levels: at the most general level, only the members of the elite were allowed to be buried in this specific disposal area. These mem bers of the elite were organized into four main descent groups of unequal power and</page><page sequence="27">The cemetery of Houlouf in northern Cameroon (AD 1500-1600) 159 Table 7 Combination of occupations Cluster Number of occupational groups Triple occupation Double occupation Single occupation Unknown Symbolic South-eastern North-eastern South-western North-western Total 7 0 1 2 10 Table 8 Sub-hierarchy of individuals within each occupational group Rank SE Cluster SW Cluster NE Cluster NW Cluster 17 27 Warrior-horsemen/Administrators 1 13 2 50 3 11 4 12 Warrior-horsemen/Administrators/Ritual performers 1 21 2 3 4 Administrators/Ritual performers 1 20 2 43 3 4 22 5 6 Administrators 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Ritual performers 1 2 14 18 26 16 56 34 32 23 30 35 36 31 29 prestige: the most important was the 13s descent group in the SE cluster, followed by the 32s in the NE cluster, the 17s in the SWr cluster and finally, ihe 36s in the NW cluster.

This partition according to occupational categories provides a subtler view of the fabric of the Houlouf elite in AD 1500-1600 which appeared to have been based on both co-operation and competition. Co-operation is suggested by the use of a unique system of disposal of the deceased, an imperative attested by the orientation of the Central Monument which may be interpreted as the guarantee of the unity of the elite and the whole community of the settlement. Competition is attested by the variability recorded in the processes for the accumulation of material and symbolic capital and their corollaries in terms of occupation, power and prestige. The performance of rituals may have concerned all the activities of the inhabitants of Houlouf; it may thus be considered as the structural link between matters of peace and warfare in the hands of warrior-horsemen and the more mundane subsistence and socio-economic duties of administrators. The social position of ritual performers has to be reconsidered according to a subtler hierarchy of individuals and occupational categories (Tab. 9). The spatial location of burials relative to each other and their distribution in distinct clusters may thus be read as fossilized patterns of interacting social roles and statuses which were selected by the inhabitants of Houlouf and considered as relevant for the performance of mortuary rituals. The cemetery space as social arena: descent groups and occupational hierarchy Administration seems to appear as the strategic occupation in the fabric of the Houlouf elite in AD 1500-1600. The performance of rituals was combined with warfare via adminis tration, and there was no single occupation of warrior. The triple occupation of warrior/ administrator/ritual performer (WAR) thus appears as the ultimate concentration of power and prestige. However, the distribution of grave-gaods and the spatial location of burials do not clearly support this proposition, but suggest a more complex and subtle picture. A closer examination of the spatial distribution of burials according to their rank within each occupational group shows that the four tombs of warriors/administrators/ (WA; 13, 50, 11 and 12), are located exclusively in the SE cluster (Fig. 13-1). Burials of WAR (Fig. 13-2) are distributed in the SE (21), SW (17 and 27) and NE clusters (32), those of administrators (A; Fig. 13-4) in the NE (32), NW (36 and 31) and SWT clusters (18, 26, 16 and 56), while administrators/ritual performers (AR; Fig. 13-3) were interred in the SE (20, 22 and 43), NW (30 and 35) and SW clusters (14), and rituals performers (R; Fig. 13-5) in the NE (23) and the NWr clusters (29). Even if there are strong inequalit ies between clusters in terms of numbers of burials and amounts of grave-goods, it appears that, with the exception of undetermined and symbolic tombs, all the clusters share the same frequency of occupational groups which amounts to three in each spatial unit, with WA, WAR and AR in the SE cluster, WAR, AR and A in the SW cluster, WAR, A and R in the NE cluster and finally, AR, A and R in the NW cluster (Fig. 14a). The leading individuals of the SE, SW and NE clusters belong to different occupational groups: WA for the first, WAR for the second and A for the third. Individual 36, the leading person of the NW: cluster, was an administrator; and this patterning seems to replicate the rank order of the NE cluster. It is thus suggested that this spatial patterning was probably linked to the fluctuating and changing relations of power and prestige among the members</page><page sequence="30">162 Augustin F. C.

These fluctuations have generated a differential distribution of individuals within various occupational spheres which were, in terms of frequencies, equally distributed among the four social fractions or descent-groups recorded. That was probably a subtle way to manage social contradictions resulting from competi tion beiween members of the elite. The four desceni-groups were at the same time engaged in competition which resulted in their hierarchical ordering, with the 13s group at the lop, followed by the 32s, the 17s and the 36s ai ihe boltom (Fig. 14b). A closer analysis of ihe spatial organization of burials suggests thai the layout of the cemetery was struciured on two basic categories of features: the Central Monument (19) and the burials of leading</page><page sequence="31">The cemetery of Houlouf in northern Cameroon (AD 1500-1600) 163 A Administrator AR Administrator/Rituals R Ritual-performer S Symbolic tomb U Unknown WA Warrior/Administrator WAR Warrior/Administrator/Ritual IX) Symbolic burial Figure 14 Spatial organization of the cemetery according to (1) occupations and (2) rank order.</page><page sequence="32">164 Augustin F. C. Holl individuals of three burials clusters, 13 from the SE, 32 from the NE and 17 from the SW. These four features are organized into a spatial pattern with triangular lattices of equal size, with the Central Monument as its centre (Fig. 15). The distances in straight lines between the Central Monument and these three burials varies from 2.5 to 2.0 m and that between them from 4.0 m (13-17) to 3.5 m (13-32 and 17-32). The central area of the graveyard may thus have been structured by the power and prestige relations between the three dominant descent-groups, while the fourth social fraction was situated in a relatively peripheral position. Within each cluster, burials were distributed around the dominant tomb, and it is worth noting that the spatial patterning of the SE cluster replic ates the triangular lattices model of the central area; a kind of symbolic appropriation of the actual social order which captured both the actual reflexive views of the Houlouf elite and a part of the organization of the social system. The spatial context of the cemetery The cemetery is contained within a habitation area, probably a walled compound (Holl 1988), with a blacksmith's workshop on its eastern side and what is considered as a shrine area on the south-east (cf. Fig. 2). The blacksmith's workshop contains three features: one Figure 15 Inferred spatial organization of the cemetery according to the hierarchy of descent groups.</page><page sequence="33">The cemetery of Houlouf in northern Cameroon (AD 1500-1600) 165 ordinary horse-shoe shaped hearth (89), one forge hearth (38) and one furnace (39) in which two large pieces of iron slag were uncovered. The shrine contains four feature: one small fire-pit surrounded by very large sherds resembling a pavement (45), one large jar with a conical base (9), one truncated jar (7) used as a device to support larger jars, and a series of nested and truncated jars and very large sherds (8) in which an arm-ring in copper alloy was found. Three anthropomorphic figurines representing human heads were uncovered, two at the base of structure 8, one on the eastern side and the other on the western side, and one inside the nested rings of truncated jars. A few shells of Tamarindus sp. fruits were also found in this area, among the sherds. According to one informant, these shells were and are still traditionally used to clean the bodies of the dead. It thus appears that this small area was very important for the performance of the mortuary programme: the large jar (9) supported by the truncated one (7) was probably used as a container filled with water and medicines to wash the deceased, while offerings, as sug gested by the presence of the copper alloy arm-ring and votive figurines, were disposed at the shrine (8). The presence of a blacksmith's workshop suggests the existence of a craft-specialist acting as undertaker and grave-digger: the combination of these occupa tions is a recurrent feature in the ethnography of Chadic-speakers of the Mandara Moun tains since the beginning of the twentieth century (Wente-Lukacs 1977); it has been observed that these specialists did not perform mortuary rituals for all the members of their respective communities, but only that of the most important elders and individuals. The Houlouf case, which is the unique archaeological example of such a patterned social division of labour in the archaeology of Northern Cameroon and the Chad basin, suggests that such a development may have started earlier than AD 1500-1600. Apart from this interesting finding, which depends more on luck than on the characteristics of a research programme, two important aspects may be singled out: in spatial terms, the recorded cemetery seems to have been located in a closed spatial unit, the blacksmith's compound, and may have been inaccessible to unauthorized individual's. In social terms, the mortuary rituals were performed by a craft-specialist, the blacksmith/undertaker-grave-digger; this may partly explain the homogeneity of the system of disposal of the dead recorded. The blacksmith was also the craft-specialist who may have manufactured artefacts in copper alloys according to the demands of the members of the elite (Larick 1991), thus playing an important mediating role between the members of the elite both alive and dead. The presence in the shrine of an arm-ring in copper alloy has to be interpreted within this framework; the blacksmith was at the same time the provider of important prestigious items used by the members of the elite to translate material into symbolic capital, the one who performed mortuary rituals, took decisions for the disposal of the dead, grave-goods and burial facilities according to prevailing rules, the location of burials relative to each other in the cemetery, and finally, acted as the safe-keeper of the disposal area, guaran teeing the integrity of the elite cemetery. Why a cemetery? - formal disposal area and regional interaction It has been observed elsewhere (Holl 1989) that the use of formal disposal areas to bury the dead had started ca. AD 1500 in the southern part of the Chad basin. Cemeteries have been found in settlements with earthen ramparts. The processes which lead to the</page><page sequence="34">166 Augustin F. C. Holl development of this behavioural patterns may have resulted from the cumulative effects of both intra and inter-society dynamics. Intra-societal dynamics concern vertical and horizontal differentiation attested by the presence of craft-specialization and the development of ranked occupational groups. Inter societal dynamics concern changing relations between interacting and competing peer polities (Renfrew and Cherry 1986), ethnic groups and socio-economic systems within the context of unpredictable environmental hazards. After a short arid period (ca AD 1300 1400/1500) which lasted for some 100 to 200 years, there was a new phase of settlement expansion in the Chad plain; the inhabitants had to face new and expansionist kingdoms such as Bornu in the north-west, the Barma state in the south-east and the arrival of Arab pastoralists looking for better grazing lands in the wetter Chad plain (Fig. 16). According to the historical records (Smith 1976; Lange 1977, 1987; Zeltner 1979a, 1979b; Reyna 1990; Cordell 1985), in AD 1497, Bornu rulers had started an extensive programme of warfare against neighbouring societies, they were interested not only in booty but also in conquest of new territories and the establishment of tributary relations (Reyna 1990:31). This policy climaxed under the leadership of king Idris Alauma from 1564 to 1592 (Lange 1977, 1987; Zeltner 1979a). The relations between the Bornu and Kotoko polities were different from one area to another. According to Ibn Furtu, the Imam of Idriss Alaoma, king of Bornu (in Zeltner 1979a: 119-22; Lange 1987:92-?), the Kotoko people of Makari joined the Bornu army in campaigns against the Soa Tatala and Ngafata. Those of Kusseri, a city located 15 km north-east of Houlouf, and Sabalgutu, a village claimed by Lange (1987:160) to be located 27 km west-north-west of Kusseri, were defeated by the Bornu army. For Kusseri, it is noted that 'as for the ruler of the fore-mentioned Kusuri, when he came forth to fight our Sultan with his army, he was taken alive, and our Sultan gained a tremendous victory by his capture' (Lange 1987:97). The battle of Sabalgutu seems to have been much more important: As for the ruler of Sabalgutu and his people, when they increased their depravity, iniquity and wrong-doing in their stronghold, and when the news of them reached the Sultan, the Commander of Islam, he deviated towards them with his army, as he was going by and beyond, to the country of Mandara. When he had reached their stronghold, they prepared for battle, and came forth, and drew up in array. But, when the 'Imam' (lapsus for Sultan) engaged them in battle, God cast severe dread into their hearts, and vile cowardice. So they were defeated and fled from their own town. A great number of the idolaters were killed, and their women and children were made captive, while the Muslims gained a mighty victory and took much booty (Lange 1987:97). As suggested by these historical records, there was a direct actual threat on the borders of the Houlouf polity and the recorded military campaigns are but a minor part of a larger set of various pressures on peoples and land of the Chad plain in the middle of the second millenium AD. One hundred years earlier, in AD 1391-2, king Uthman Biri from Bornu sent a letter to the Sultan of Egypt complaining about the raids made by the Arab Judham in the Bahr el Ghazal (Zeltner 1979b: 17-20). Details of the processes of expansion of Arab pastoralists toward the lake and the Chad basin are not known. About two centuries later, by the end of the fifteenth century, it is claimed that king Idris Alaoma had Arab pastoralists as</page><page sequence="35">The cemetery of Houlouf in northern Cameroon (AD 1500-1600) 167 9 Major centres x^ Moving frontiers of Arab pastoraiists Xi Moving frontiers of expanding kingdoms ao.^ Limits of the Kotoko land ^-^ - Rivers Figure 16 Schematic distribution of ethnic groups in the Chad basin in AD 1500-1600. allies, and some of their fractions may have entered the Bornu kingdom at that time (Lange 1987; Zeltner 1979b). W7e may consider that, from that time, the presence of groups of Arab pastoraiists in the Chad plain, and above all the grassland of the Yaere, which are flooded during rainy seasons, is a real possibility. Oral accounts I recorded in 1991 at Alaya, an Arab settlement say thai their ancestors entered the Houlouf region three hun dred years ago, i.e. ca AD 1700. The reactions of local polities to expansionism and terrilorial encroachmeni were varied: some of those defeated by Bornu troops adopted a new way of life and settled on the small islands of Lake Chad.</page><page sequence="36">168 Augustin F. C. Holl Warfare in the sixteenlh century, at least in Bornu, and probably throughoul the central Sudan, was directed against competing states and stubborn 'pagans1. There is every reason to believe the Yedina were Sao who responded to these pr?dations by withdrawing to the lake (Reyna 1990:31). Many others did not have the opportunity or did not want to flee; they devised varied strategies to face the new situation: such strategies may have included the organization of troops and the development of structured armies for defence and attack, the symbolic appropriation of land through the development of formal disposal areas and intensification of craft production. The development of the cemetery of Houlouf in the sixteenth century and its patterning have to be interpreted within this wider sociopolitical situation of the southern Chad basin. The context of competing polities and ethnic groups probably generated the emergence of structured groups of warriors as one of the conditions for the survival of the societies of the southern Chad plain. Mortuary rituals were therefore performed as a social recognition of the important role played by some individuals for the survival of the community of Houlouf at this time: To the degree that corporate rights to use and/or control crucial but restricted resources are attained and/or legitimized by means of lineal descent from the dead, that is lineal ties to the ancestors, such groups will maintain formal disposal areas for the exclusive disposal of their dead (Saxe 1970: cited in Chapman 1977:22). Conclusion In AD 1500-1600 the southern part of the Chad basin witnessed important changes in the balance of power between competing polities and the arrivals of new immigrants with a differ ent socio-economic system: the Arab pastoralisis. The reactions of local communities to this new situation were varied; some of them initiated new symbolic features aiming to root them selves in their land. Formal disposal areas were one of the straiegies adopted, but only a small fraction of the actual societies were buried in cemeteries. As shown in this study, the elite of Houlouf buried in the cemetery was not homogeneous, being divided into fraclions which have been interpreted as descent-groups with different occupations such as warriors, admin istrators, ritual performers etc. These occupational groups may have been structured accord ing to grades of unknown nature. The archaeological context suggests that the mortuary rituals were performed by a craftsman, a blacksmith/undertaker-grave-digger. The frag ments of the past social system of Houlouf show that processes of horizontal and vertical social differentiation had already generated a ranked iociety with complex hierarchical sysiems.
