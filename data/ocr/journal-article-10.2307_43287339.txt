Unfortunately, the natal origin of turtles in many foraging areas remains unknown. Resolution of this issue was recently listed among the conservation priorities for the species by a global panel of Green Turtle researchers. We examined the genetic diversity and natal origins of Green Turtles from a well-known foraging area in the western Gulf of Mexico. Bayesian mixed-stock analysis of mitochondrial DNA haplotypes was used to demonstrate that an overwhelming percentage (~95%) of individuals in the western Gulf of Mexico foraging group likely originate in other Gulf of Mexico and northern Caribbean rookeries, with smaller contributions from the western and southern Caribbean, and potentially the Mediterranean Sea. Management of Green Turtles in the western Gulf of Mexico will be improved by linking conservation efforts aimed at this foraging group to turtle aggregates occurring in other critical habitats within the recently defined northwest Atlantic Green Turtle regional management unit. Chelonia mydas (Green Turtle) is an extensively studied marine reptile species whose IUCN and CITES endangered status highlights its conservation priority. Conservation efforts are complicated by the expansive geographic home range of individual turtles. Extensive migrations of Green Turtles and multiple ontogenetic habitat shifts result in home ranges that often encompass multiple oceanic basins. Following hatch, Green Turtles enter into the sea and begin an oceanic existence. Hatchlings can migrate long distances and are often directed passively by ocean currents (Carr, 1987; Musick and Limpus, 1997). Juvenile Green Turtles may remain in the pelagic stage for several years before recruiting to neritic (&lt;200-m depth) foraging habitats (Carr, 1987). Foraging grounds are usually geographically distinct from breeding and nesting grounds, but constitute critical areas for Green Turtle conservation because the percentage of time spent in foraging areas is likely greater than that spent in rookeries. Age at sexual maturity for Green Turtles in the Atlantic is estimated to be 27-33 yr (Frazer and Ehrhart, 1985; Frazer and Ladner, 1986), with a majority of this time spent in subadult foraging habitats or open water. Additionally, Green Turtles generally breed in multiyear cycles (Meylan, 1982), meaning several years may be spent in foraging areas before returning to nesting sites. Data from tag returns indicate that females typically reuse feeding grounds (Limpus et al., 1992), and foraging aggregates tend to be mixtures of several different nesting populations (Pritchard, 1976). This has been demonstrated in foraging areas using data from maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) (Lahanas et al., 1998; Bass and Witzell, 2000; Luke et al., 2004; Bass et al., 2006; Foley et al., 2007; Naro-Maciel et al., 2007). Conservation or management actions taken on foraging grounds will thus have proportionate effects on each of the rookeries that contribute to the foraging aggregate. For this reason, information about the relative contributions of known Green Turtle nesting groups to each foraging group can provide a link between conservation efforts at these two critical habitats. Management units based on patterns of mtDNA variation have precedence in the literature (Moritz, 1994), and will improve delineation of regional management units (RMUs) in Green Corresponding Author. E-mail: Joel.Anderson@tpwd.state.tx.us DOI: 10.1670/12-031 Turtles (Wallace et al., 2010). Indeed, linkage between nesting sites and forage sites has been identified as a priority for Green Turtle research globally (Hamann et al., 2010). Green Turtles were once common foragers along the coastal regions of Texas (Doughty, 1984). The species was the cornerstone of a commercial turtle harvest exceeding 230,000 kg/yr during the 1800s (Hildebrand, 1982). As a result, the current foraging group in Texas is much smaller than what it was prior to exploitative harvest. However, the southern coast of Texas remains part of perhaps the largest contemporary Green Turtle foraging group wholly within the northern Gulf of Mexico (hereafter, Gulf) (Coyne, 1994; Shaver, 2000). Addition- ally, the catch per unit effort of Green Turtles in Texas has increased markedly since 1991 (A. Landry and T. Metz, unpubl. data). The south Texas coast is characterized by abundant seagrass, a common food item for Green Turtles in the Gulf (Foley et al., 2007). Additionally, jettied passes at Brazos Santiago Pass, Mansfield Channel, Packery Channel, and Aransas Pass Ship Channel provide high-density algae foraging areas used heavily by Green Turtles (Shaver, 1994, 2000, 2005; Renaud et al., 1995). Although the data (Shaver 1994, 2000) indicate that Green Turtles use the Laguna Madre area of south Texas as a summer foraging area, warmer temperatures over the last 30 yr have increased the likelihood that Green Turtles forage in south Texas year round. Therefore, south Texas likely represents a critical component of a larger western Gulf foraging habitat for Green Turtles. However, the origin of Green Turtles using this foraging habitat has not been assessed. Characterization of marine turtle foraging and nesting groups with the use of mtDNA has a long history in the literature, owing mainly to the high resolution and divergence of mtDNA loci among turtles from different nesting beaches (Bowen et al., 1989; Bowen and Karl, 2007). Here, we used haplotype data from the well-characterized mtDNA control region to estimate the contribution of known Atlantic Green Turtle nesting populations to the Texas foraging group. The results of this study will improve management of Green Turtles in Texas by linking conservation efforts of the western Gulf foraging group and habitat to conservation efforts at the respective rookeries that contribute animals to this foraging group.</page><page sequence="2">252 J.

Samples combined for mixed-stock analysis are indicated by dashed ovals (the south Atlantic group, not shown, was also a combination of multiple rookery samples). Exact sampling locations of the Texas foraging group are indicated in the map inset as EMB (East Matagorda Bay), SAB (San Antonio Bay), NPI (North Padre Island), and SPI (South Padre Island). Materials and Methods Sample Collection and Laboratory Methods. - Tissue samples were collected from cold-stunned, live, and dead juvenile Green Turtles found during two successive freeze events occurring in February 2011. During the freeze period, more than 600 turtles were found stranded, and these were subsampled for genetic analyses. The authors acknowledge that sampling turtles during a freeze period may not represent an entirely randomized sample. However, this study relied upon opportunistic sampling of individuals that had been retrieved for rehabilitation, and we believe this to be more acceptable than invasive sampling. One of two types of tissue was taken from sampled individuals: 1) a toe- clip (1 cm2) excised from a rear flipper, or 2) a biopsy or necropsy plug excised from soft tissue. Turtles were subsampled from four inlet bay areas on the coast of Texas (Fig. 1): South Padre Island (SPI, n = 108), North Padre Island (NPI, n = 111), San Antonio Bay (SAB, n = 41), and East Matagorda Bay (EMB, n = 22). Tissues were stored in 70% ethanol prior to DNA isolation. Isolations were carried out with the use of Puregene® miniprep kits (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Final elutions were of variable volume between 50 and 200 'il for each individual, and elution volume was determined qualitatively based on size and appearance of the DNA pellet. Aliquots of eluted DNA were used as templates in polymer- ase chain reactions (PCR) with primers specific to the mtDNA control region of Green Turtles (LTCM2, HDCM2; Encalada et al., 1996). Reactions were carried out in 25-(il volumes, each reaction mixture included 4-|il template DNA (50 ng/ļal), 1 Ready-To-Go® PCR bead (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Piscat- away, New Jersey), and 21 jíl of forward and reverse primer cocktail (0.4 jiM standard primer concentration of each primer). Aliquots of each PCR product were purified with Exo-Sapit® PCR purification reagent (USB Corp., Cleveland, Ohio). Purified amplicons were sequenced directly with the primers LTCM1 and HDCM1 (Allard et al., 1994), which provided more consistent sequencing results than primers used in PCR. Sequencing reactions were carried out in 20- (il volumes with DTCS Quick Start Master Mix (Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, California) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fol- lowing the sequencing reaction, labeled fragments were precipitated with a 4-fil mixture of 3M sodium acetate/ 100 mM EDTA and 1 fil glycogen (20 mg /ml), followed by two volumes of 95% ethanol. Precipitated fragments were spun at 3,700 rpm for 30 min to form pellets. Pellets were rinsed twice with 70% ethanol, dried, and rehydrated with sample loading solution (SLS, Beckman Coulter). Finally, the reaction products were separated and analyzed with a Beckman CEQ8000® capillary sequencer (Beckman Coulter) and default module parameters. Raw sequences were trimmed and edited manually, and forward and reverse traces for each sequence were aligned with the software package Sequencher v4.2 (Gene Codes Corp., Ann Arbor, Michigan). Statistical Analysis. - In SPI and NPI samples, straight carapace length (SCL) was recorded for all individuals, when possible (n = 497).

Parameter estimates Lœ and K were from Bjorndal et al. (1995). Approximate age distributions were then constructed and a G-test was used to determine whether the age distributions of stranded turtles at each site were homogeneous. Haplotype diversity (the probability of two individuals chosen at random having different haplotypes, Hd) at each of the four sample sites was calculated using the program DnaSP v5 (Librado and Rozas, 2009). Haplotypes from all individuals examined in this study were compared directly to the 63 currently described Atlantic Green Turtle haplotypes, available on-line from the Archie Carr Center for Sea Turtle Research, University of Florida (ACCSTR, http://accstr.ufl.edu/ cmmtdna.html; last accessed on 31 May 2011). The statistical significance of differences among haplotype frequencies at each Texas sampling site was tested using Fisher exact tests (for pairwise sample comparisons) and the pseudo-probability test (Roff and Bentzen, 1989, for all sites together). Both homoge- neity tests were performed using the software CHIRXC (Zaykin and Pudovkin, 1993). Sample sites that were not statistically different from one another were pooled for the purpose of mixed-stock analysis. Mixed-stock analysis was used to compare haplotypes from the Texas foraging group to those from regional Atlantic nesting areas described previously (Naro-Maciel et al., 2007 and references therein; Ruiz-Urquiola et al., 2010). Haplotype frequencies from Atlantic rookeries (except the Cuban popula- tion) were taken from Naro-Maciel et al. (2007, Table 2). Haplotype data from Cuban nesting areas were taken from Ibarra-Martin et al. (2002). "Orphan" haplotypes (those found in the foraging ground but not in any rookeries) were excluded from analysis, as per Bolker et al. (2007). Regional rookery population groupings were treated as single rookeries, to avoid the bias associated with inadequate rookery sample-sizes described by Luke et al. (2004). Data from the following nesting populations were combined: Hutchinson Island, Florida (n = 24), Quintana Roo, Mexico ( n = 20), and CayoReal/Guanaha- cabibes, Cuba in = 28) were combined into a "Gulf" group (comprising near-Gulf and northern Caribbean rookeries); Table 2. The %2 approximation, degrees of freedom, and exact P values for haplotype frequency homogeneity tests among Green Turtle sample sites.

Such groupings have precedence in the literature (Bass and Witzell, 2000) and were made for two reasons: 1) these groupings conform to the Green Turtle RMUs of Wallace et al. (2010) which are based on genetic identity of stocks, and 2) combining samples for mixed stock analysis resulted in more robust nesting sample sizes, resulting in sharper confidence intervals around stock estimates. Single sampling sites included in the mixed-stock analysis were Cyprus (Mediterranean; n = 26), and Tortuguero, Costa Rica ( n = 433). Mixed-stock analysis was carried out with the use of the Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling method imple- mented in the program MIXSTOCK (Bolker, 2009). MIXSTOCK implements the Bayesian method of Pella and Masuda (2001) but accounts for sampling error of rare genotypes (Bolker et al., 2003). The MCMC was run for three chains, with the third chain consisting of 2,688 iterations. Chain number and length were terminated upon parameter convergence, which was deter- mined with the use of the Gelman and Rubin (GR) shrink-factor criterion (convergence has occurred if GR &lt; 1.2; Gelman and Rubin, 1992). Upon finding that Gulf rookeries comprised a vast majority of the contributing stock to the western Gulf foraging group, a secondary analysis was performed in which only samples from Florida, Mexico, and Cuba were considered to be potential contributing stocks. This analysis consisted of two chains of 8,754 iterations, with parameter convergence tested with the use of the GR shrink-factor criterion. Orphan and singleton haplotypes were combined as before. In all runs, confidence intervals around stock estimates were determined from the posterior distribution. Results Of the 602 turtles processed during the stranding period, 497 were aged approximately using SCL and the Von Bertalanffy growth equation. Turtles ranged from 21 to 74 cm SCL. Most turtles were estimated to be between 5 and 7 yr old, with a range of ~3-19 yr (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the estimated age distribution by site of sampled turtles indicated that the SPI Green Turtles were older, on average, than the NPI turtles, and the difference in age distribution was statistically significant (G</page><page sequence="4">254 J.

It is not known whether this disparity is due to a biological effect or sampling bias. In either case, the genetic analyses herein pertain entirely to juvenile/ subadult turtles (&lt;80 cm) foraging in Texas in the winter, as no adults were recovered during the freeze period. One turtle from SPI had evidence of mtDNA heteroplasmy (multiple haplotyes present in the same individual) and was excluded from mixed-stock analysis. Otherwise, 15 haplotypes were identified in 282 individuals (Table 1). Site SPI had the highest number of haplotypes (haplotypes = 13, Hd = 0.66), followed by NPI (haplotypes = 7 ,Hd - 0.57), SAB (haplotypes = 7,Hd = 0.57), and finally EMB (haplotypes = 3, Hd = 0.56). All haplotypes found have been described previously. Two haplo- types, CM-A01 and CM-A03, dominated the collections; 88% (247 of 282 individuals) of all individual haplotypes sampled. These two haplotypes are common in the western Caribbean and Florida nesting populations, and are found less commonly in southern Atlantic groups. The most common haplotype, CM- A01 ( n = 144) has been found in nesting groups in Florida and Mexico, and foraging groups in Florida, North Carolina, Cuba, and Barbados. The second most common haplotype, CM-A03 ( n = 103) is more ubiquitous in Atlantic collections, but again is primarily centered in North America (Florida) and the western Caribbean. The third most common haplotype, CM- Al 8 ( n = 10) has been found only in the nesting group in Mexico and in foraging groups in North Carolina and Florida. All other haplotypes occurred in fewer than five individuals in this study. Although there were qualitative differences in the raw frequencies of haplotypes sampled among sites, there were no statistically significant differences in haplotype frequency distributions among sites either in pairwise comparisons or overall (Table 2). Therefore individuals from all four sites were combined for mixed-stock analysis. Four haplotypes (CM-A22, CM-A26, CM-A47, and CM-A58) found in nine Texas individuals have been sampled only in other Atlantic foraging areas (i.e., have not been found in nesting areas) and therefore contain no information regarding nesting area. Other foraging areas where CM-A22 has been found are North Carolina, Florida, and Barbados, and CM-A26 has been found in North Carolina. The remaining two haplotypes (CM-A47 and CM-A58) have been identified previously and deposited in the ACCSTR database, but are from unpublished studies (location is not available). Individuals that carried any of these four haplotypes were eliminated from further analysis, resulting in 273 remaining individuals used in the mixed-stock analysis. The mixed-stock analysis indicated that a majority of turtles in the western Gulf foraging areas originated in Gulf /northern Caribbean rookeries (Florida, Mexico, and Cuba), with an estimated probability of P = 0.981 (range 0.900-0.999) (Fig. 3A). Other potential nonzero probability contributions were from Costa Rica, P = 0.010 (range 0.000-0.092); the eastern Caribbean, P = 0.004 (range 0.000-0.023); and Cyprus, P = 0.004 (range 0.000-0.015). Of specific note was the finding of one individual at the SPI site with a haplotype (CM- Al 3) only found in Cyprus and diagnostic of that population. Nesting areas in Africa and the south Atlantic appeared to contribute little to the Texas foraging group. The secondary analysis that considered only Gulf rookeries resulted in stock estimates with extremely wide confidence intervals, and indicated contributions primarily from Rorida and Mexico rookeries, with a smaller contribution from Cuba (Fig. 3B). Discussion Previous genetic mixed-stock analyses of Green Turtle foraging locations in the Caribbean and Atlantic concluded</page><page sequence="5">GENETICS OF CHELONIA MYDAS 255 that oceanic currents play a major role in the transport and distribution of postpelagic Green Turtles (Bass and Witzell, 2000; Luke et al., 2004; Bass et al., 2006). Predictions of juvenile recruitment based on current-mediated dispersal alone can be tested by linking predominant haplotypes at natal beaches to postpelagic and juvenile haplotypes at foraging grounds. For instance, given a hypothesis whereby currents are the main mechanism by which juvenile turtles arrive in the western Gulf, one expectation is that a majority of juveniles in this area would originate from nesting beaches in and around the Gulf and western Caribbean, where currents are generally directed northerly into the Gulf. Our data suggest that juvenile Green Turtles foraging in Texas indeed originate from other nearby Gulf and northern Caribbean habitats, with a smaller contribu- tion from the western Caribbean rookery in Costa Rica. The western Gulf is an area where large Sargassum sp. mats are common offshore features and these mats serve as nursery habitat for a number of pelagic species larvae (Wells and Rooker, 2004). Juvenile Green Turtles transported into the Gulf may use these mats as transition habitat before recruiting to neritic foraging areas. Ring eddies from the Yucatan loop current tend to transport Sargassum sp. mats into the western Gulf of Mexico (Leipper, 1970; Sturges and Leben, 2000). Thereafter, the timing of ontogenetic shifts in diet and habitat in Green Turtles result in a complex pattern of migration and recruitment throughout the Gulf, Caribbean, and North Atlantic. Based on stable isotope analysis, Reich et al. (2007) estimated that Green Turtles recruit to neritic habitats at approximately 25-35 cm in length or approximately 3-6 yr of age. This is similar to the size and approximate age of the turtles sampled in the current study, suggesting a very young population that has just experienced an ontogenetic habitat shift. Ontogenetic shifts in diet in turtles in the 25^15-cm size range and recruitment to jetties and seagrass beds have been described by Gorga (2010) in the Laguna Madre. Such a scenario (current-driven transport, followed by pelagic association with Sargassum sp., followed by neritic recruitment) has been proposed for marine turtles in general by multiple authors (Carr, 1987; Bolten et al., 1998; Bass and Witzell, 2000; Luke et al., 2004; Bass et al., 2006; Blumenthal et al. 2009) and seems to be a probable sequence for Green Turtles entering the western Gulf. Bass et al. (2006) suggested that juveniles may home to "regional" foraging grounds. In the present case, Texas, especially the algae- and seagrass-laden habitats of the Laguna Madre, would serve as an important foraging area for juveniles eventually destined to return to regional rookeries for breeding (Gorga, 2010). One of the main obstacles to mixed stock analyses is sampling bias/ error that results from inadequate sampling in nesting areas. In fact, error due to inadequate sampling of nesting stocks may be a major source of error in Green Turtle mixed-stock analyses. This error can be attributed to two different problems with nesting site samples. First, some important nesting grounds in close proximity to Texas have thus far not been sampled at all. For instance, Green Turtles are known to nest on the Gulf coast of central Mexico (Carr et al., 1982; Lagueux, 2001), and yet to the knowledge of the authors, haplotype frequencies from these beaches are not present in the literature. Nesting in Campeche, Mexico is numerically on par with that in the Quintana Roo (Yucatan) sample represented in the present data (Carr et al., 1982). Moreover, nesting frequency in Tamaulipas, Mexico has increased at a rate similar to the increased occurrence of foraging Green Turtles in Texas (DS, Fig. 3. Estimated stock contribution of six regional nesting stocks to the western Gulf of Mexico Green Turtle foraging group, broken down by (A) Atlantic regional rookery groups, and (B) single Gulf of Mexico rookeries. The bars above and below point estimates represent the two- tailed 95% confidence interval around stock estimates. unpubl. data). These unsampled nesting sites may be major contributors to the Texas foraging group. The second problem is that, of those nesting colonies that have been sampled, sampling has been extensive in some areas (e.g., Tortuguero, Costa Rica n = 433) and limited in others (e.g., Quintana Roo, Mexico n = 20). As a result, precise testing of heterogeneity among sampled nesting sites may be limited by type-II error caused by wide confidence intervals around sampled haplotype frequencies. For instance, the most common haplotype (CM-A01) in the Quintana Roo (Mexico) nesting group occurs with a measured frequency of 0.35 ± 0.11 (Encalada et al., 1996). Singleton haplotypes in this population have standard errors equal to their mean estimated frequency 0.05 ± 0.05. Larger sample sizes will drive down the standard error around all haplotype means, resulting in higher resolution in mixed-stock analyses. Addi- tionally, larger sample sizes from nesting beaches may allow detection of rare haplotypes, some of which have been identified on foraging grounds but not in nesting areas in both this study and previous studies (Luke et al., 2004). Foley et al. (2007) examined cold-stunned Green Turtles from northwestern Florida and found a majority to be from the Hutchinson island (Rorida) nesting area. Additionally, Foley et al. (2007) determined that turtles from the Costa Rican rookery contributed little to the Florida foraging group; a unique finding given the relatively large size of the Costa Rican nesting group</page><page sequence="6">256 J. D. ANDERSON ET AL. versus that of other such groups in the Caribbean and North Atlantic. Thus the general result from the current study replicates the major findings of Foley et al. (2007) and indicates some degree of similar genetic identity among Gulf foraging aggregates. More extensive genetic sampling at nesting areas will likely resolve the issue of precise stock contributions (Luke et al., 2004; Foley et al., 2007). However, our data indicate with high confidence that Texas is an important foraging habitat for Green Turtles from Gulf and northern Caribbean nesting areas, and an intermittent habitat for turtles from the western Caribbean, and potentially Cyprus. Threats to juvenile or subadult turtles in transit to foraging beaches can have a proportionate effect on nesting beaches thousands of kilometers away, and vice versa. A major threat to Green Turtles in the western Gulf is entanglement or ingestion of anthropogenic debris (Plotkin and Amos, 1990). Carr (1987) suggested that floating debris and pollutants associated with open-water Sargassum sp. mats present a significant threat to long-term survival and health of Green Turtle populations. The presence of pollutants has also been associated with the fibropapilloma (FP) disease of marine turtles (Foley et al., 2005). If Sargassum sp. mats play a key role in transporting postpelagic and juvenile turtles into the western Gulf, debris fields in the western Gulf associated with these mats may serve as localized disease foci for individuals that eventually return to nesting rookeries located throughout the Gulf/ Caribbean area. Knowledge of the migratory pathways to and from nesting areas can thus be used in predictive models of epidemiology in breeding and nesting areas. Such data can inform programs that seek to limit the spread of infectious diseases or to mitigate entanglement threats to Green Turtles in transit from nesting beaches, and will improve conservation efforts for the entire northwest Atlantic Green Turtle RMU.
