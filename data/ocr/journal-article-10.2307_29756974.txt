<plain_text><page sequence="1">Iconography of Lihgodbhavam?rti in South India A Probe into Stylistic Evolution by T. Chandrakumar Siva, foremost in the Hindu Trinity, is everywhere worshipped in the avyakta linga form The linga today outnumbers all other types of Indian sacred images (Zimmer 1955: 22). He is tacked with myriads of epithets, chiefly based upon his manifold personality and functions. Rich mythological lore, legends and philosophical exegeses grew around Siva's cosmic forms and functions during the past 2000 years. Several pur?nas extol his ambivalent character. He is the custodian of pancakrtyas 'five cosmic functions' which includes srsti 'creation', sthiti 'prevervation', samh?ra 'destruction', anugraha 'boon rendering or conferring gracefulness' and tirobhdva 'embodiment of illusion'. The Amarakosa (5th century A.D.) (vv. 59-68) enumerates forty-eight of the titles of Siva. He is described in Sivasahasran?mastotra (Lingapur?na 291: 305) with one thousand names. These appellations could broadly be categorised under two types, viz., saumya or s?nta 'benign or graceful' and ugra or ghora 'ferocious'. The benign forms include Siva as instructor and grandmaster of all arts and crafts. The ugra manifestations indicate Siva's endeavour in destroying the evil and streamlining the weal of the universe in the righteous course. He strives to establish cosmic amity and maintain the balance of power through his activities. Turbulent and recalcitrant elements are brought into order. One such form which purports to establish the cosmic order and balance of poise is the Lingodbhava through which manifestation Siva not only attempts to teach a lesson to Visnu and Brahma, his partners in the established cosmic order, but also prove his eminence as the grand-master of the Hindu pantheon. The paper consists of three integral parts, dealing with canonical mandate, iconographical monuments and stylistic evolution, the purpose being the (*) Acknowledgement: I am thankful to Prof. Raju Kalidos (Head, Department of Sculpture, Tamil University, Thanjavur) for having gone through this paper and revised it. 0) The word linga has been interpreted in various ways. According to the Mah?bh?rata (Anus?sanaparvan) quoted by Bhandarkar (1983: 162), the Linga is Siva's phallus. The best example is the Gudimallam linga (Sarma 1982: pis. 4-6). The linga and Siva-Mah?deva became one and the same in Indian religious tradition (Jash 1972: 137) by about the 2nd century A.D. Others treat the linga as a cosmic principle, represented by its elements like hills, trees etc. (Srivastava 1979: 22 fn.). [1] 153</page><page sequence="2">interconnection between them which may help to evaluate the significance of the main thesis. Pur?nic Accounts of Lingodbhava According to purdnas Siva is said to have appeared as a blazing pillar of fire of illimitable expanse to teach a lesson to Brahma and Visnu (2) who challenged Siva's greatness. Siva who enlarged himself in a huge and immeasurable columnar form asked Brahma and Visnu to trace the head and the foot so that either one of them could be great. In case they fail, the greatness of Siva should be acknowledged. Visnu assumed the form of a var?ha 'wild boar' to delve deep into the earth to reach the unfathomable abyss and trace Siva's foot. Brahma as hamsa 'swan' flew up to reach the summit. However Brahma, tried a trick and uttered falsehood saying that he had found out the crest of Siva. Towards this end, the t?kmp? flower (Skt. kekaki, Pandanus odoratissimus L.) served as a witness. So, Siva cursed Brahma for his duplicity to the effect that he will not have any exclusive shrine and the t?lamp? not to be used in Siva-p?ja. Both the gods cast their pride off and realised the eminence of Siva. This story is recounted in the V?yupur?na (5th century A.D.), K?rmapur?na (c. 11th century), Lingapur?na (post-11th century A.D.) and Sivapur?na (16th century A.D.). The form is also described in verses like the Sivamahimnasstotra of Puspadanta (5th century A.D.) and the Sivanandalahari of Sankara (8th century A.D.) (Gangadharan 1980: 56). Tamil Concept of Lingodbhava The Tiruvann?malaisthala-pur?nam, also called Arun?cala-pur?nam (16th century A.D.), a work dealing with the Siva-Linga at Tiruvann?malai (North Arcot Dt.), glorifies the story of Lingodbhava. Mythologically the story is a Tamil adoption of the Sanskritic original. But it gets localised as a sthalapurdna. In commemoration of Siva's feat, a grand festival is celebrated in the month of Kdrttikai (November-December) on the asterism of Krtika (Pleiades). Tens of thousands of people throng to the place to offer worship to the agni (fire), ignite atop of the mountain. A darsana 'view' of the dipa Tight' is considered to be meritorious. It is believed that the dfpotsava 'fire festival' commemorates the day when Siva stood as a magnificent blazing column with all extending tongues of fire. (2) The conception of Lingodbhava is likely to have originated as a riposte to Visnu's Trivikrama incarnation who stood spacing the entire universe, insurmountable, immeasurable and beyond perception, encompassing within himself the whole circle of luminaries, planets and stars (Gonda 1976: 6-8; Eliade 1961: 34 ff.). According to Banerjea (1974: 462) the concept has its roots in the Mah?bh?rata. Asvatth?ma, an opponent of the P?ndava brothers, invoked the blessings and aid of Siva who blessed standing like a huge golden altar or pillar with flames. A representation from Mogalr?japuram is similar in concept to Visnu-Visvar?pa (Sivaramamurti 1974: 286). 154 [2]</page><page sequence="3">In Tamil Saiva conviction, Lihgodbhava is widely known as Ann?malaiy?r (He is the imperceptible-mountain form) which epithet takes into account Siva's infinitude, comprising the entire universe (piramdnta k?lakai in Tamil ? Arundcala purdnam, 'Arun?calesvarar-stuti' v. 7). This is the Visvar?pa-Lihga or Lihga in cosmic form, a synonym of Mah?lihga (Great Lihga). The bhakti 'devotional' literature of 7th-8th centuries A.D. enumerates the magnified form of Siva. Tirun?nacampantar (7th century A.D.) in his Tevdram hymns speaks of the form in every ninth verse of each patikam 'stanza' (Kalidos 1988: 429). His senior hymnist, Tirun?vukkaracar, sings of the luminous linga in every one of the verses [Tevdram: 5: 209) under Ilinkdpurdnat Tirukkuruntokai. Cuntaram?rti N?y?nar (9th century A.D.) notes Brahma and Visnu as engaged in their expedition to measure the Lihga which consisted of the three cosmic fires, i.e. the Sun, the Moon and the Agni, because it encompassed the entire universe (Tevdram 1:61 A). A Tamil inscription of R?jar?ja C?la (A.D. 985-1014) notes the Lord as 'Lihgapur?na-devar', the lord of Lingapurdna (see Venkataraman 1985: 156; SIL II 44). It is understood from the above facts that fire was the source of the original form of Siva. Herein one may find the Vedic Rudra-Agni-Stambha equation (Gonda 1976: 4 ff.; Bhandarkar 1983: 147). The linga in the central shrine of Ann?malaiy?r temple for the 'fire-nature' of Siva is known as tejolinga, jyotirlinga or visvalinga or visvajyoti 'effulgent-/?/^ (3). Sdstric Mandate on Iconographical Features Silpa texts enumerate both the iconographical and iconometrical aspects of the form. The common Siva, 'S?dh?rana Siva', emerges from out of the ellipsoidal sunken depression in the midst of a column, leaving adequate space for the images of Brahma and Visnu, who are shown engaged in their peculiar way of searching the crest and foot of the pillar, the former in the form of hamsa and the latter in vardha on the lateral sides. Siva is either two-armed or four-armed. He holds parasu 'axe' and mrga 'deer' in the rear right and left arms (parahastas) and abhayahasta (protection rendering) and katyavalambitahasta (hand placed on the hip) poses in the front right and left arms (p?rva hastas) respectively. He stands erect in samapddasthdnaka without any bends in the body, noted as rijutaramathapddam sthdnakam (SCS: chap. 17, v. 13). His foot below is submerged in the bottom left of the linga (4). These iconographical (3) The Tamils conceived the five primary elements of nature ipancabh?ta ? fire, water, earth, wind and sky) and associated them with the linga. In addition to the tejolinga at Tiruvann?malai, other pancabh?ta-lingas are prthivilinga [earth-linga) in the temple of Ek?mbran?tha at K?nchipuram, ap-linga (water-linga) at Jambukesvara, v?ya-linga (w'md-linga) at K?lahasti and ?k?sa-linga (sVy-linga) at Chidambaram. (4) KSS (chap. 81, v. 2). SCS (chap. 17, v. 7) describes what portion is to be exposed in the leg part of Siva. T.A.G. Rao (1971: II, pt. I, 107) and R.S. Gupte (1980: 40) point out that the figure of Siva should not be sculptured below the knee. The textual data states that the portion from the ankles (ghalaka or nalaka) to foot (p?da) should only be obscured. [3] 155</page><page sequence="4">formulations, viz., the disappearance of the foot and the summit of the headdress, may be to denote the incalculable eminence of Siva. He is to be decked with a jat?makuta, yajnopavita 'sacred thread', h?ras 'necklaces', kankanas 'wristlets' and key?ras 'bracelets' and wears a short loin-cloth. Brahma and Visnu, in addition to their zoomorphic manifestations, may appear in their human form also, holding their characteristic emblems in the rear-arms while the p?rva hastas are in reverential attitude. Lingodbhava is described in texts like the K?mik?gama, oldest among Saiv?gamas (Rao 1971: I, pt. I, 55-56). The K?ran?gama (later than 7th century A.D.), Sakal?dhik?ra ('Lihgodbhava-^5^^', chap. 21), K?syapa-silpas?stra (KSS, chap. 81) and S?rasvatiyacitrakarmas?stra (SCS: chap. 17) (all of 16th century A.D.) are other texts which deal with the subject. The texts give a detailed account of iconometrical proportion as to how much space is to be allotted for Siva who occupies the ellipsoidal recess of the sth?nu. The K?ran?gama enjoins that one fifth of the linga must be left uncarved on the top and bottom respectively, the remaining is obviously allotted for the depression meant for the emerging figure of Sivar?pa or Paramesvara (5). The same formula has been adverted to in SCS (chap. 17, v. 9). It further allows three iconometrical modes of carving in the allotment of space such as four sixth, three fifth and two fourth parts for the size of the Linga (6). By this system of space allotment the size of Siva's figure may look smaller or larger. Regarding the flanking figures, the K?ran?gama points out that the swan and boar forms of Brahma and Visnu must be carved on the right top and left bottom respectively. Two types of iconographical delineations are recommended for the carvings of the attendant deities: (1) zoomorphic or human forms of Brahma and Visnu, (2) both in human form offering anjali to Siva, occupying the same sides or locations. But in the actual iconographical illustrations, both human as well as zoomorphic illustrations simultaneously occur. The K?mik?gama adds few more details regarding the iconometrical formulation of the zoomorphic forms. The size of the bird must be equal to the size of the face of Paramesvara, that of the boar double the size of Siva's face, thereby suggesting the comparative smallness or bigness of the bird and the boar respectively. It is stated that the whole composition is surrounded on the top of the linga by figures of gods, goddesses, rsis, S?rya, Candra and gandharvas who are in anjali (5) The ?gamas (quoted by Rao 1971: II, pt. I, 107) mention that the figure of Candrasekharam?rti should be carved in the middle cavity. The actual reference runs as Lingak?rasya madhye tu Candrasekharavath paratnsthitham (Sakalddhikdra: chap. 21, v. 1). Here it implies like 'vath' Candrasekhara: lingak?rasya madhye tu Candrasekharam?rtivath (KSS: chap. 81, v. 1), tasyamadhye prakartavyamSivar?pasya vartakam (SCS: chap. 17, v. 6) and yevam any?ni m?n?ni Candrasekharavath sudhthi {SCS: chap. 17, v. 12). So the representation need not be Candrasekhara himself, but the general form of Siva or Rudra (Sastri 1916: 114). (6) The iconometrical system of this kind of allotment is categorised accordingly as uttama (high), madhyama (medium) and adhama (low) measurement (SCS: chap. 17, vv. 8, 9). 156 [4]</page><page sequence="5">attitude (SCS: chap. 17, v. 11). The SCS also prescribes the figure of Samkarasanam?rti, one of the forms of Visnu, to appear just below the boar figure. With reference to the attributes, the ?gamas do not agree with each other. The Kdrandgama mentions that Siva must hold the weapons as what Candrasekhara aspect of Siva holds; therefore, it prescribes abhaya (by right hand) varada (by left hand) poses, axe and deer at the back hands. The Silparatna (Rao 1971: II, Pt. I: 108) enjoins that Siva should hold s?la in one of his hands, whereas SCS (chap. 17, v. 13) stipulates that Siva must hold venu (flute made of bamboo stick) and tanka (uli in Tamil) in back hands and front hands in abhaya and varada poses. ICONOGRAPHICAL ILLUSTRATIONS I. Early Medieval Period Several early medieval specimens are found scattered throughout South India. The most important specimens are taken into account for analysis and thereby the aim is to pinpoint the stylistic variability within the regional or sub-regional context and to analyse either the compatibility or non-conformity with reference to textual mandate in order to obtain a clear perspective of the stylistic evolution of Lihgodbhava iconography. Few early C?la (10th century A.D.) and Vijayanagar (14th-15th centuries A.D.) specimens are taken into account to point out how the theme attained maturity, during the later medieval period. The aim is mainly to trace the stages of development at various points of medieval art history. Towards this end, the random sampling method or representational selective method is followed to obtain the necessary results. In early medieval Tamil N?du several Lihgodbhava images appear in the rock-cut cave temples of Tirumeyyam, Pillaiy?rpatti and Kunnakudi, all of P?ndya affiliation. In the Pallava structural temple of Kail?san?tha at K?hchipuram, the Eastern C?lukya Svarga Brahma temple at Alamp?r, the Western C?lukya Virup?ksa temple at Pattadakal and Ellora caves XV and XVI both R?strak?ta, are important centres outside Tamil N?du. Tirumeyyam The Saiva cave houses an image in its side niche, facing west and lies in an axial alignment with the linga in garbhagrha (fig. 1). The iconography is simple and unostentatious. The linga is scooped out in the vertical order and the cleavage is sunken in the midst of the tall linga wherein emerges the figure of Siva who is fitted with two arms. The right arm is held in varada attitude and the other katyavalambitahasta. He wears a short jatdmakuta, perhaps indicating its merger with the lingdgra 'top of the linga\ The Lord wears a thick yajnopavitd or uttartya, kankana and key?ras. He [5] 157</page><page sequence="6">is depicted up to the hip level, obscuring the thigh and the entire base portion of the linga. It is bordered on the sides by conventionalized tongues of fire, emphasizing the blazing-fire pillar form of Siva. It is interesting to note that Brahma and Visnu or their manifested forms, fail to appear. Pillaiy?rpatti The Pillaiy?rpatti cave has an image of Ganapati in its central shrine which is flanked by images of Harihara and Lingodbhava. The Lingodbhava image is in the form of a pillar below the hip level (Nagaswamy 1964: 265-67). The Lord is human in the upper part; he is dvibhuja and stands in samap?dasth?naka pose. The Tirumeyyam Siva appears in the middle section of the pillar while in Pillaiy?rpatti the representation is partly sthanu and partly human. Kunnakkudi The linear linga depiction is absent (fig. 2); Siva stands freely in samap?dasth?naka posture, devoid of the encircling lips of the depression which normally engulfs him in Pillaiy?rpatti. The bottom portion below the hip is left uncarved, in other words it gets submerged in the stumpy linga portion. The Lord is caturbhuja, carrying deer, katyavalambitahasta suspended below and tanka. This is a norm which points out the evolutionary process over the earlier specimens, both Tirumeyyam and Pillaiy?rpatti. The Lord wears a jatabh?ra, necklaces, yajnopavtta, and other ornaments. The three faced Brahma and Visnu stand to the right and left respectively, rendering anjali to Siva. They carry their characteristic attributes by their back hands. Brahma in bird form flies up. The introduction of the figures of Brahma and Visnu is a novel idiom in the present case. K?nchipuram Four iconographical masterpieces are available from the Kail?san?tha temple. They are featured in small cells, devakulikas, fanning around the courtyard of the temple (Rea 1970: pis. XII and LX; Rao 1971: II, pi. XIII). Viewed from the iconographical point of view only one piece is highly impressive and interesting in the present context. The unique specimen is housed on the right devakostha of the garbhagrha (fig. 3). It has no cylindrical and upright linga representation as we find in Tirumeyyam and Pillaiy?rpatti. The sth?nu gets petrified within a rectangular slab. Siva is carved in a spacious niche, provided in high relief. The entire space of the niche encompasses the figure of Siva without adequately leaving any space up for the figure of Brahma 158 [6]</page><page sequence="7">Fig. 1 - Tirumeyyam, Saiva Cave. [7]</page><page sequence="8">and the space provided below is insufficient for the figure of Var?ha because the sculptor had intended to portray it somewhere else, below the niche. Var?ha wears a kirita makuta, a novel idiom, rarely found in iconographical illustrations. He is caturbhuja and holds the sankha 'conch' and cakra 'wheel'. Brahma and Visnu along with gandharvas appear in lateral niches. The absence of Brahma in zoomorphic form is a noteworthy feature. Siva is in samapddasthdnaka posture within the hexagonal section of the niche. He is eight-armed, holding a snake while the attributes in the other hands are not clear. The front left hand is in katyavalambitahasta. He wears a tall jatdmakuta, encrusted with a digital moon and so Candrasekhara. He is adorned with kundalas, key?ras, kankanas and haras. He wears a short cloth around the loin. The leg portion below the knee is not shown. Brahma and Visnu appear like attendant figures. Brahma is three-faced and dvibhuja. One hand is in katyavalambitahasta and the other in vismayahasta. A similar arrangement is followed in the mode of depicting Visnu who is endowed with four arms, holding the sankha and cakra in parahastas. The whole composition is overtopped by a makaratorana. The K?nchipuram specimens on stylistic grounds prove to be much advanced within the early medieval group of sculptures on the subject. Pattadakal The specimen of Lingodbhava from the Virup?ksa temple, constructed towards the middle of the 8th century A.D., is remarkable on the subject (fig. 4). The trimukha Brahma and Var?ha appear as engaged in their arduous trecking. Siva is only two handed which recalls the Tirumeyyam specimen. But the attributes, tris?la and tanka, meant for the rear arms do faithfully appear. He wears a short kilt around the waist and is decked with all ornaments. Visnu and Brahma fail to appear in human form. This idiom strikingly contrasts in the K?nchi and Ellora specimens in Kail?sa temples. Alamp?r The specimen is found in the eastern wall of the Svarga Brahma temple (Rao 1977: pi. 11). The pillar is enframed by spirts of fire unlike the chequered conventionalized fire-design at Tirumeyyam (fig. 5). Siva appear within the elliptical cavity in his full manifested form ip?rnar?pa) from top to toe. The jatd is partly obscured and merged in the top. The images of Brahma and Visnu, flanking Siva, are iconometrically on par with each other suggesting that they are not mere attendants but equals (7). But a close scrutiny suggests that this may be due to the secondary stage of the story of Lingodbhava where Siva stands in his manifestation to show his magnitude to both Brahma and Visnu and offer benediction. Both stand in anjali-oiizrmg attitude, holding 160 [8]</page><page sequence="9">Fig. 3 - K?nchipuram, Kail?san?tha temple. z Fig. 4 - Pattadakai, Virup?ksa temple. [9] 161</page><page sequence="10">their characteristic emblems by the rear arms. A theriomorphic Var?ha is engaged in the digging-up process and Brahma in anthropomorphic form ascending up. One more representation appears on the left side which may be a gandharva. This typology to a large extent gets closer to the Ellora cave XVI specimen {infra). Ellora The illustration from Das?vat?ra (cave XV, fig. 6) at Ellora (mid-8th century A.D., Srinivasan 1979: 73) is a good specimen (Burgess 1970: 25, pi. XXI 3; Rao 1971: II, pt. I, pi. XIV 1). Siva is emerging from the double-convexed opening of the linga. The pillar is bordered with flames, issuing from it. Siva is standing erect with four arms: carrying axe and deer in back hands, abhaya and katyavalambita in front hands. He is decked with uttanya, yajnopavtta, a short jatdmakuta which looks more like a jat?bhanda, key?ras and kankanas. The linga is flanked by Brahma and Visnu to the right and left. They are standing erect with their front arms in reverential attitude. Visnu's back arms carry the conch and disc. Trimukha-Brahma is on his ascent. The boar is depicted by the side of sth?naka Visnu. Another specimen is found in the Kail?sa (fig. 7) at Ellora (Burgess 1970: 35; Gupte 1980: pi. 38). In several respects this icon bears a close resemblance with the one described above but what is interesting is the changing location of Brahma and Visnu on the left and right. The significance of the changing location of Siva to v?mac?ra side has its own relevance (for details see Kalidos 1988b). Brahma and Visnu are uniformly given a position on the right and left respectively. This interchangeability also agrees with later silpa versions. According to KSS (chap. 81, v. 2) Brahma as swan may also be sculptured on the left of Siva, pit?maho hamsar?pi ?rdhavasyo v?map?rsvake, and Visnu is stated to be on the daksina (right) side. Visnu is standing in anjalihasta gesture behind his Var?ha embodiment. His back hands carry the conch and wheel. A long kintamakuta adorns the head. Var?ha appears vertically swooping down for boring the earth whereas his counterpart, the triple-faced, takes off in the sky like a typical gandharva appears in several Ellora compositions. It is interesting to find on the right shoulder of Brahma a wing, another being hidden, which obviously is his dorsal side for fluttering. Another figure of Brahma in worshipful attitude is also depicted. Siva, showing his appearance from within the hexagonal (7) Similar type of iconography finds its place in the carvings of the K?katiya art in the second half of the 11th century A.D. The figure is encircled by a lotus-stalk in the offsets of the wall of Paccale Somesvara temple at Panagal (Andhra Pradesh) (Prasad 1978: 45, pi. 27). Siva is depicted in samap?dasthana in full manifestation from crown to foot flanked by Brahma and Visnu on the right and left respectively. The remarkable feature is that no sth?nu or linga appearance is chiselled. Iconometrically the height of Brahma and Visnu are in reduced form, suggesting their low stature. Their assumed forms, stylistically feathered swan and zoomorphic Var?ha are well portrayed. 162 [10]</page><page sequence="11">Fig. 5 - ?lamp?r, Svarga Brahma Temple. Photo Fig. 6 - Ellora, Dasavat?ra Cave. Photo AUS, AUS, Varanasi. Varanasi. opening, gets closer to the K?nchipuram specimen. He is protrayed with two arms. One arm is held in anjali gesture and a small garland or rosary of beads is looped around the thumb. He is adorned with all ornaments. II. Late Medieval Period: Iconography under the Colas Under the C?las, Lingodbhava acquired iconographical standardization with regard to attributes and placement within the temple structure, appearing in the back devakostha of the garbhagrha. Several early C?la specimens as illustrated by S.R. Balasubramanyam (1971: pis. 14, 34, 46, 84, 88,~108, 130, 137, 165, 177, 196, 208, 219, 243 and 255) bear much uniformity in the modelling. The images are mostly in samap?dasth?naka. Siva is caturbhuja. The front hand is held in varadahasta and the corresponding left hand exhibits either the pose of katyavalambitahasta or ?ruhasta. In all representations the back hands carry Siva's general attributes, the right holding parasu and the left deer. In rare cases, the example being the Velacheri illustration, the attributes are interchanged in the back hands. Below the knee only part of the [11] 163</page><page sequence="12">Fig. 7 - Ellora, Kail?sa Cave. Fig. 8 - K?marasavalli, K?rkotesvara temple. leg is exposed. A flower band appears around the top of the Lingodbhava which is non-?gamic. The specimen from K?marasavalli (fig. 8) bears the t?lamp? at the top and the bird-incarnate appears to be approaching for a vile negotiation. Visnu is uniformly depicted in the therianthropic boar form (8). He is plunging invertedly down into the globe to reach the destination. The posture, stance and movement of Brahma's flying character are majestic and the style has its own uniqueness. Brahma in his zoomorphic form is illustrated in several stylistic forms: (1) in fully-feathered bird form like a beautiful dove, either the wings in stretched for fluttering or unstretched simply like a flightless bird, which conforms to agamic standard; (2) in anthropomorphic form, three-faced and holding his favourite emblems like aksamdld (rosary of beads) and kamandalu, soaring up like a vidhyddhara as in Ellora and Elephanta; (3) in human (8) The original conception of the Var?ha form of Visnu is as old as the Vedic period (Rao 1971: I, pt. I, pp. 128 ff.). But the Var?ha in the Lingodbhava theme is obviously fostered by Saivite extremists who with a view to slur Visnu, depicted him like a pig of modern days. Brahma alone was given a honourable delineation in the carvings such as a beautiful dove, or in anthropomorphic form or seated astride on swan. The answer lies in the fact that Brahma is no longer a deity to be reckoned with, ever since the Vedic age and he has no sect of his own. 164 [12]</page><page sequence="13">form but seated astride on his swan-vehicle for his sky-borne travel. Visnu is shown in a majority of cases in var?ha form and as human in samap?dasth?naka. The above analysis points out a stereotyped approach in the modelling of the icon during the C?la period. The much developed iconographical conventionalism continued for three more centuries and no innovative features were added till the Vijayanagara artists during the 14th-15th centuries A.D. who took some bold steps for breaking the conventions. III. Later Medieval Period: Iconography under Vijayanagar The Lingodbhava icon from the Ann?malaiy?r temple at Tiruvann?malai is a remarkable specimen of the theme in the entire range of Indian art history. On stylistic grounds it can be assigned to 14th-15th centuries A.D. The image is housed in a small shrine built for the purpose very recently. The image consists of an elongated round and solid beam-like figure, resembling a solid pounding stone {kulavikkal in Tamil), symbolising the linga in magnified form. In the centre of the oval recession the emergence of Siva is shown who is in erect standing posture. His ankles and feet are submerged in the linga-bottom. He holds the parasu, deer, abhaya and katyavalambitahastas. He is decked with all ornaments. Both Visnu as boar and Brahma as swan are engaged in detecting the top and toe. Its bearing on the theme is a significant one. Another rare idiom is that in the place of linga or sthdnu, the Vrsabhav?hanam?rti form of Siva appears (fig. 9). Siva is standing with his consort, Um?, as Um?sahitam?rti (9) and with vrsabha(bull) at the back as Vrsabhav?hanam?rti. Atop of the head of Siva-Um?, Brahma in the zoomorphic form of a swan is seen soaring up. Visnu in therianthropic form of a boar is plunging topsy turvy in the act of burrowing into the earth with his hard snout and the two frontal hands. S?rya and Candra appear on the right and the side of the couple. This is another norm setting idiom which follows the SCS version. The entire composition befits the substance of Cuntaram?rti N?yan?r's hymnal imagery (supra). He refers to Visnu and Brahma who search in all the three fires of the world, i.e. the Sun, Moon or the lightning and Fire (agni) because it encompassed the whole universe (Rangaswamy 1958: 204). It thus depicts the universe. Another peculiarity in this iconography is the presence of a soaring mountain. It stands for Siva's abode, the Kail?sa, or the Lord himself is considered to be in the form of a mountain (Sailar?pi Mahddevah). The mountain concept of Siva is alluded (9) K?p?likas and K?lamukhas worshipped Um?sahitam?rti form of Siva. They were considered to be heretics by the orthodox school of Saivism. They followed a fanatical system of worship. They disagreed with the authority of the Vedas, varn?sradharma (caste-based-law) and possessed belief in dgamas. They worshipped spirits, followed Tantrik practices, sexual licentiousness and worshipped the human sex organs (Bandarkar 1983: 181). [13] 165</page><page sequence="14">to in this iconography for its being immovable (acald) in nature (see Amarakosa, v. 68). Siva as Vrsabhav?hanam?rti is four-armed. The front left hand is seen resting on the horn of the animal and the front right in abhaya pose. The back right and left side hands as per ?gamic mandate hold axe and deer respectively. The whole physiognomy of the composition is daubed with the oil and hence the facial or ornamental features are not clear. Siva wears a jat?makuta over the head, makara and patra-kundalas in the right and left ears respectively, a thin yajnopavita, key?ra and katisutra (waistband). On the left side, Um? is standing with the left leg slightly flexed and the right leg firmly planted on the ground similar to that of his counterpart. The right hand holds an unblossomed flower bud (utpala-?ower) and the left hanging down. 166 [14]</page><page sequence="15">IV. Stylistic Analysis The various specimens elaborated in the present study could be brought under four or five thematic stages of development which we way call evolution. That is to say, from a simple form to a complex and sophisticated form, a process of evolution is discernible within the context of our study. This evolutionary process may also help to date the monuments, especially the early medieval caves. This is necessary because so far art historians have tried to frame a chronological background for the early medieval cave temples of Tamil N?du, taking the Mandagapattu caves (early 7th century A.D.) as the starting point. In this approach no significance is attached to the development of iconographical forms in them and on this basis there seems to be a lacuna and an analysis of iconographical patterns may also suggest a revised chronology for the caves. So the present analysis is doubly rewarding in as far as it not only helps to pinpoint the stages of evolution of Lihgodbhava iconography but also a revised date for the cave temples of Tamil N?du. In this context, we may keep in mind what Lippe (1967: 5-24) says on C?lukyan sculpture. The Lihgodbhava found in Tirumeyyam cave may be treated as stage I in the process of development because it is a simple carving consisting of a fiery pillar and Siva. The Pillaiy?rpatti representation may be treated as stage II in view of the fact that both the pillar and Siva get merged in one and the same. Kunnakudi specimen may be treated as stage III as it is an elaboration over the Pillaiy?rpatti typology and in the former case, in addition to the merger of Siva with sth?nu, two additional figures, viz., Brahma and Visnu in figurative forms, get inducted into the picture. We may also note here that in all these specimens of the earlier stage neither the hamsa nor the vardha appear. The next stage, which we may call penultimate, is to be found in the Kail?san?tha temple at K?nchipuram (stage IV) wherein a sophisticated form consisting of the sth?nu with Siva inside, Brahma and Visnu and their anthropomorphic forms, hamsa, or vardha appear. Within the context of early medieval art the K?nchipuram specimen represents the pinnacle of development. A number of specimens on the theme are also found in the Deccan region from Pattadakal, Alamp?r and Ellora. The Ellora (cave XVI) and Alamp?r representations get closer to what we find in the K?nchipuram temple at K?nchi. In the Pattadakal specimen of the Vir?p?ksa temple, the K?nchipuram typology is reproduced in a slightly modified form. The only difference between Pattadakal and K?nchipuram is that in the former Brahma and Visnu fail to appear in the human form. Chronologically, the Tkuvann?malai specimen of the Vijayanagar period is obviously later and also represents an improvement over what we find in K?nchipuram and may be treated as stage V which also represents the end of the process. From a simple and unostentatious Tirumeyyam (stage I) to the much sophisticated Tiruvann?malai (stage V), a process of evolution is discernible on the basis of the thematic input and stylistic output. If we may say iconographical developments proceed [15] 167</page><page sequence="16">from a simple to a complex form, then the chronological orientation involved in the various stages of Lihgodbhava iconography will be as follows: (i) Tirumeyyam, (ii) Pillaiy?rpatti, (iii) Kunnakudi, (iv) K?nchipuram, (v) Pattadakai, (vi) Alamp?r and (vii) Ellora. Regarding the date of the Tiruvann?malai and K?nchipuram specimens there is no chronological dispute. Tiruvann?malai is late medieval and gives no room for chronological debate. K?nchipuram temple is assigned to the early 8th century A.D. Pattadakai, Alamp?r and Ellora follow suit and are assigned to the later half of the 8th century A.D. So on the basis of their thematic treatment and chronological frame-work stage IV is to be assigned to the later half of the 8th century A.D. Basing upon these arguments, the first three stages of development in the iconography of Lingodbhava are to be assigned to a period anterior to the Kail?san?tha temple at K?nchipuram. Assigning a time scale of twenty-five years for the development of each one of the stages we may fix the date of Tirumeyyam around A.D. 625, Pillaiy?rpatti A.D. 650, Kunnakudi A.D. 675 and so on this basis it is possible to revise the dates for the cave temples in the Pudukk?ttai circle. It is also to be noted here that many of the cave temples in this circle are archaic in pattern and architectural framework. The contents of garbhagrha and iconographical alignment within the cave structure are somewhat unique or even may be archaic in nature. For example in the Pir?nmalai cave temple an image of Kaly?nasundara is housed in the cell which is also too narrow in excavation. In the Tirumeyyam cave itself we find Lingodbhavam?rti axially aligned to the Lihga in the cell which we do not come across in any of the cave or structural temples of the age. Again in Pillaiy?rpatti, Ganapati appears in the main cell while Harihara and Lihgodbhava are placed as auxiliary representations. All these point out that some of the cave temples in the Pudukk?ttai may be the earliest in point of time but in the absence of epigraphical data scholars have assigned them a later date. The architectural set up and iconographic placement of the Pir?nmalai cave temple is the earliest in the entire range of cave art in Tamil N?du. Tirumeyyam and Kunnakudi are architecturally a little advanced and fall in line with the Mandagapattu type and so the dates assigned to the respective specimens may not be a misnomer. From the above analysis we may formulate a case for the percolation of Lingodbhava iconography within South India. The earliest typology being found in the Pudukk?ttai region, it is possible to trace the genesis of the concept in this region. From Pudukk?ttai the idea spread to K?nchipuram. It is from K?nchipuram that the concept moved northwards to Ellora via Alamp?r and Pattadakal. This percolation process has been pointed out in a recent study by Kalidos (1988a: map 12) but the author has failed to trace the stages of evolution and also takes into account the later dates assigned for the cave temples in the Pudukk?ttai circle. The Lingodbhava concept is frequently noted in the bhakti literature of the N?yanm?r and we get an elaborate picture of the type of K?nchipuram, Alamp?r and Ellora. So the ideological background for the type of representation is to be found in the literature of the N?yanm?r and we get an elaborate picture of the type of K?nchipuram, Alamp?r and Ellora. So the ideological background for the type of representation is to be found in the literature 168 [16]</page><page sequence="17">of N?yanm?r (Kalidos 1988: 428-30). So the early medieval concept of Lihgodbhava in art, thought and literature was a typical legacy of the Tamil country which artists working in the latter temples at Alamp?r, Pattadakal and Ellora adopted. This thesis is confirmed by the fact that in the entire range of temple tradition only in Tiruvann?malai we have the sthalapur?nam associating the m?rti of the temple with Lihgodbhava. Two more supports for the thesis are that the linga at Tiruvann?malai is viewed as jyotirlinga and the final stage of the evolution of the form is also from the same temple. Conclusion The Lihgodbhava embodies certain interesting philosophical thoughts as well as iconographical variations and uniqueness. The imperceptible extent of the universe is pointed out in the process of evolution through a synthetic form. The Saivas think that the universe is the body of Siva. So, not even the celestials could perceive its immense potentiality and infinite. The //^-manifestation was designated to prove Siva's mightiness and all-pervading quality. The 'fire-nature' points out that Siva encompasses and engulfs the whole universe. Its mythological background formed indirectly the basis to proclaim the immanent and transcendental nature of Siva as well as to use it like a missile, other deities used as pawns in trumpetting the glory of the eternal Siva. Whatever it be, the irrevocable truth of transcendental existence of one Ultimate Reality (sat), name it either Hara or Hari or any other deity that matters, is quite different wherein all celestial beings form an array of oneness, the Unified Whole Substance. Unity of godhood in India has pulsated through the ages by several philosophical expositions. Lack of proper application of 'the theory of Ultimate Reality', at times produced communal fire also, resulting in a quarrelsome attitude which sprouted its ugly head among all groups of Hinduism, Saivites, Vaisnavites, S?ktas and so on. Lihgodbhava is one such form. The philosophical truism woven around the theme of Lihgodbhava, either for the righteous sense as it were, in the process of inculcating the knowledge of the universe through the medium of iconography or for wrong approach, whatever it may be, seems to have had its origin in the Tamil country. In this process the philosophical disputes or exegeses set in motion by Sahkar?c?rya in the 7th-8th centuries A.D. played an important role. His philosophical straw-streds were picked up by a number of religious scholars all over India which is sure to have influenced iconographical formulations. Tirumeyyam and Pillaiy?rpatti specimens are at the root of this evolutionary process. Towards this end, the P?ndya country must have acted as an epicentre for such development. The simple mode of expression as found in early specimens substantiate their claim for being so. The theme and concept get elaborated and centrifugally diffused to other parts of Tamil country in due course. From K?hchipuram, it had its northward journey to the C?lukyan region, where we come across some early [17] 169</page><page sequence="18">specimen at Alamp?r, Pattadakal and Ellora. Probably, it percolated through Alamp?r which acted as a link-channel. Under the C?las in Tamil country the iconography got to a much stereotyped pattern, appearing on the western niche of Siva temples which would indicate a definite reorganization and placement accorded to Lihgodbhava. This assertion is quite distinct from the sporadic earlier trend of the placement as well as irregular appearance. For about three centuries the orientation and the iconography of Lihgodbhava seldom changed. With the advent of Vijayanagar kings from about the 14th century onwards, the iconographical formulation reached the final stage. The artists of the period were dexterous in handing the subject, fitting it with all unique qualities that bespeak the religious trends of the period. At this stages, Lihgodbhava gets merged with the Vrsabhav?hanam?rti form and Sakti. The sth?nu along with a fusion of Siva and Um?, the male and female principles symbolize the procreation and sustenance of the universe through their combination. Thus the Tiruvann?malai piece stands at the acme of an evolutionary process. From Tirumeyyam to Tiruvann?malai, the story of Lihgodbhava in art and thought is simply marvellous. Three distinct channels of development are traceable: (1) iconographical, (2) historical and (3) philosophical, all three reaching summation in the Tiruvann?malai piece.
