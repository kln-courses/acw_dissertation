<plain_text><page sequence="1">God The Father - And Mother: Study and Extension of Freud's Conception of God as an Exalted Father by C. G. Schoenfeld During recent years, the need to re-examine and refine psychoanalytic theories in the light of discoveries made since Freud's death has become increasingly obvious. This need is especially pressing in that part of psychoanalytic thought pertaining to anthropology and religion. To help meet this need, an attempt will be made in the pages to follow to an alyze and re-evaluate Freud's views concerning the god concept. But first, a few preliminary observations. Freud ap proached the god concept with impatience and with the fixed viewpoint of a partisan. He considered only one — the an thropomorphic — picture of God, dismissing all others as unworthy of examination.1 He acknowledged that his analysis of why men worshipped God could neither prove nor dis prove God's existence; yet he repeatedly disparaged the notion of God, calling it "patently infantile" and "incon gruous with reality." He saw God as nothing but an exalted father; yet — as this study will attempt to show — an an thropomorphic god may serve not only as a father-substitute, but also as a mother-substitute. Nevertheless, within the limit ations these faults impose, Freud's analysis of the god concept is remarkably persuasive. And, hopefully, this study and 1. By refusing to discuss non-anthropomorphic ideas of God, Freud in no way refuted them: after all, to ignore is not to disprove. Further, it may well be that non-anthropomorphic concepts of God are far more mature than are notions of God as a being with human characteristics (21).</page><page sequence="2">214 C. G. Schoenfeld extension of Freud's views will help shed light upon the meaning of God to man. #*######## The deity Freud discussed was the traditional anthropo morphic deity of the Judeo-Christian religions, a god who might be described as follows: God — an all-knowing, all-feeling, all-powerful, rational and just living entity, who created and is vitally interested in man, who intervenes (directly or through intemedi aries) in his life and who ultimately will judge him.2 Freud labeled this god an exalted father, a father substitute created by mankind in the image of the father of primeval times and of early childhood. Those who hope to evaluate this Freudian view of God need first gain familiarity with Freud's theories concerning the primordial and modern roles of the father. But in so doing, they must keep in mind that although Freud was an avowed atheist, he conceded that his findings regarding man's motives for worshipping God could in no way disprove God's existence. He admitted that even if he could demonstrate that believing in God fulfilled mankind's oldest and most insistent wishes, God might, nevertheless, exist. The father of primeval times Freud believed that during presocial times the "primal horde ' ' was the family unit of the human race. Each primal horde consisted of a powerful adult male (who ruled it and kept all its women for himself), his harem of wives and daugh ters, and youngsters of both sexes. When the growing sons excited the jealousy of their savage and brutal sire, they were killed, castrated, or driven from the primal horde. The outlawed sons who survived lived together in small bands, possibly in a polyandrous relationship with a stolen female, Ultimately, one of these sons succeeded to his father's 2. This definition of God is intended to encompass the ideas of those who adhere to an anthropomorphic concept of God within the Judeo Christian tradition.</page><page sequence="3">God The Father — And Mother : 215 position in the primal horde. One favoured position came about in a natural way: it was that of the youngest son, who, protected by his mother's love, could profit by his father's advancing years and replace him after his death. An echo of the expulsion of the eldest son, as well as of the favoured position of the youngest, seems to linger in many myths and fairy-tales. (9) The next stage in man's racial history began, Freud con tended, when the exiled sons, as a group, rose up in rebellion against their father, killed and devoured him (presumably they were all cannibal savages), and took sexual possession of the primal horde's women. Soon, however, the brothers be gan to quarrel among themselves, each hoping to take the place of the deposed father. But none could do this, since no single brother could defeat the combined force of the rest. Eventually, therefore, each brother gave up the idea of rul ing the family as had his father — and each renounced all rights to the family's women, the main source of brotherly discord. Instead, the brothers agreed to live together as equals and to seek women other than those who had belonged to the now-dissolved primal horde. The brothers — according to Freud — eventually lost much of their old bitterness towards their deposed father, and indeed, began to feel guilty for having murdered him. This guilt, and the memory of the father, never faded, but lived on for generations. Ultimately, when the descendants of the brothers no longer lived as equals, a longing for the father began to emerge. Before this, he had begun to re appear in the guise of a sacred animal. But now, he started to regain his human shape, re-emerging in one form as the all-powerful father-deity of the Judeo-Christian religions. Thus Freud believed that the origin of the god concept was to be found in feelings about and memory traces of the awe some father who ruled the primal horde. The foregoing account of primeval times has been at tacked by eminent anthropologists (20, 22). A. L. Kroeber, for example, once referred to it as a "just-so-story." Never theless, Freud's views concerning the primal horde prove to</page><page sequence="4">216 C. G. Schoenfeld be anything but a just-so-story — provided that one major error in them is corrected. To begin with, Freud's assumption that humans aborig inally lived in primal hordes is consistent with existing an thropological knowledge. Even Bronislaw Malinowski, an thropology's implacable foe of psychoanalysis, agrees that: "The hypothesis of the 'primeval horde' has in itself nothing objectionable to the anthropologist." (22) After all, a huge variety of herd mammals (wild horses, deer, kangaroos, ante lope, vicunas, seals, zebras) have a family unit similar to and react sexually in much the same manner as the humans who — according to Freud — lived in primal hordes during presocial times (1, 2). The social unit of the wild horse was a band of mares under the command of a stallion. This manada was "as well de fined as the tribal unit among the Indians." The bands, from two or three to twenty or thirty in number, often had a similar appearance and color because most of them were sired by the same stallion. Groups of young stallions were often seen, they being the cast-off members of a band that had been driven out by the stallion at the age of one or two years before they successfully challenged his leadership.3 Many species of monkeys and apes (presumably man's closest "relatives" in the animal kingdom4) also live and behave in a manner that closely resembles Freud's descrip tion of family life during the era of the primal horde. (27) But this fails to surprise, if for no other reason that Freud's views concerning the primal horde were based in large meas ure upon a suggestion derived by Darwin from a study of apes. Indeed, Freud quotes and reasons from the following passage in Darwin's Descent of Man. 3. Walker D. Wyman, The Wild Korse of the West (Caldwell Idaho: Caxton Printers, 1946), p. 258. 4. The closeness of this relationship is explored in Functional Affi nities of Man, Monkeys and Apes (New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1933), by S. Zuckerman. See also Wilfrid Le Gros Clark. "The Study of Man's Descent," in A Century of Darwin (S.A. Barnett, ed.; Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1958)</page><page sequence="5">God The Father — And Mother : . . . 217 . . . the most probable view is that primaeval man aborigin ally lived in small communities, each with as many wives as he could support and obtain, whom he would have jealously guarded against all other men. Or he may have lived with several wives by himself, like the Gorilla; for all the natives "agree that but one adult male is seen in a band; when the young male grows up, a contest takes place for mastery, and the strongest, by killing and driving out the others, establishes himself as head of the community." (14) In this passage, Darwin intimates that he who led a group of humans in aboriginal times won his right in bloody combat — and that when old and feeble, he would be killed or ousted, probably by one of his own sons. Freud, on the other hand, doubted that one of the sons — without help from his brothers — could have wrested control of the primal horde from his brutal sire. Rather, Freud asserted that during these primeval years, "the youngest son, the mother's fa vourite, whom she had protected from paternal jealousy," waited for his father's death before replacing him (8). Support for this modification of Darwin's theories, as well as for the further contention that it was the brothers together who finally overthrew the primal father, could be found, Freud believed, in myths and fairy tales. ... we often find in them that the hero who has to carry out some difficult task (usually a youngest son, and not infre quently one who has represented himself to the father surro gate as being stupid, that is to say, harmless) — we often find, then, that this hero can carry out his task only by the help of a crowd of small animals, such as bees or ants. These would be the brothers in the primal horde, just as in the same way in dream symbolism insects or vermin signify brothers and sisters (contemptuously, considered as babies). Moreover, every one of the tasks in myths and fairy tales is easily recog nizable as a substitute for the heroic deed. (8) But even if — as Freud assumed — myths and the like re flect symbolically crucial happenings during the infancy of the human race, his position does not seem to be strength ened by them. Rather, if — as psychoanalytic studies of myths reveal — the monsters of mythology are father-figures, and the hero who slays them is their own son in disguise (4,</page><page sequence="6">218 C. G. Schoenfeld 23), then mythology would appear to support Darwin's views. The hero of mythology did not wait around for beasts like the Minotaur or the Nemean Lion to die of natural causes — nor did he subdue them with the help of a band of brave comrades. On the contrary, such figures as Theseus and Hercules sought out and slew single-handedly the mon sters that opposed them. Admittedly, mythology's heroes occasionally received advice and help during the preliminary stages of their adventures. Like modern bullfighters in the arenas of Madrid and Mexico City, they may have been assisted by followers at the beginning of their struggles. Yet like the matador, the hero had his "moment of truth," when alone, and without friends to support or succor him, he con fronted the beast he had to kill to survive. Not only mythology, but the behavior of numerous herd mammals especially, fails to cnfirm Freud's modification of Darwin's theories. Typically, succession to the leadership of the family unit of these animals is decided in a bloody en counter between the family's master (usually its only adult male member) and one opponent, perhaps his own son (1, 2, 27). The life of the Fur Seals who for part of every year inhabit the Pribiloff Islands in the Bering Sea illustrates these facts graphically and unforgetably. Early in May, powerful male seals, called "bulls," arrive at the islands and select proper sites for the summer home of the herd. In June, the females, named ' ' cows, ' ' reach these islands, heavy with their unborn young. When the cows ar rive, each bull attempts to obtain for himself as many cows as he can defend successfully against the other bulls. During the entire breeding and mating season that now follows, the bulls neither eat nor sleep, but are preoccupied with zealously guarding their harems. The young males, called "bachel ors," live in small groups away from the rest of the herd. They spar constandy among themselves, apparently training for the time when they will attempt to wrest control of a harem away from a bull. When one of these bachelors feels ready, he challenges a bull for possession of his group of cows. Gen erally a bitter and protracted fight then ensues. During this</page><page sequence="7">God The Father — And Mother : 219 fight, the rest of the herd remains completely aloof, no aid being given to either contestant. If the bachelor is victorious, he becomes the new master of the harem, and the loser — if still alive — retires to a solitary life.5 Now assuming that Freud erred in modifying Darwin's views and that Freud's ideas concerning presocial times are corrected so as to conform to the familial practices of herd mammals like the Fur Seals, then these ideas should no longer prove unacceptable to anthropologists. Indeed, once it is agreed that during the era of the primal horde, succession to leadership of the family was decided in deadly combat, prob ably between the father and one of his sons, then possibilities of the greatest interest — like uncovering the roots of the Oedipus complex — present themselves. For example, it can be argued that the erotic wishes little girls now direct to wards their father and the hostility they feel for their mother may be remnants of the powerful emotions experienced by grown daughter in the primal horde when they competed with their mother for the sexual attention of the only mature male available — their father. Similarly, the hatred small boys experience concerning their father, as well as the erotic de sire they have for their mother, may be traces of the insistent emotions that ruled the mature son who challenged his father for mastery of the primal horde and sexual possession of all its women, including his mother. These suggestions regarding the origin of the Oedipus complex draw attention to what Ernest Jones believed was the most vulnerable part of Freud's theories about presocial times — Freud's view that guilt feeling arising from the slay ing of the primal father, as well as memory traces of the bloody deed, never died out, but remained extant in the hu man psyche, ultimately helping to form the god concept. Jones contended that Freud's view contradicted the well established genetic doctrine that the feelings and memories of one generation are not inherited by the next. (18). 5. For a lueid and detailed account of the facts sketched in the text, see Walt Disney's documentary film Seal Island.</page><page sequence="8">220 C. G. Schoenfeld When a parent responds in a given way to his environment, the responses of his children are not thereby modified. Edu cational achievements of the parents are not inherited by the children; children have to be educated for themselves. Neither do we inherit the acquired vices of our parents nor the changes in their bodies and mind brought about by accidents, malnu trition, sorrow, and the like.6 Freud himself believed his ideas concerning the primordial past violated the conclusions of geneticists. He insisted, how ever, that geneticists erred in refusing to acknowledge the inheritance of feelings and memory traces. ... I must admit that I have argued as if there were no question that there exists an inheritance of memory — traces of what our forefathers experienced, quite independently of direct communication and of the influence of education by example . . . This state of affairs is made more difficult, it is true, by the present attitude of biological science, which re jects the idea of acquired qualities being transmitted to de scendants. I admit, in all modesty, that in spite of this I cannot picture biological development proceeding without taking this factor into account. (9) Freud's attitude was in large measure a product of his repeated observation (supplemented by the research of Carl G. Jung and others) that humans bring with them at birth "fragments of phylogenetic origin, an archaic heritage." (9) He found it impossible to reconcile the existence of this ar chaic heritage with the conclusion of geneticists that the ex periences of parents are not inherited by their children. Nevertheless, once Freud's theories about primeval times are corrected in conformity with the ideas of Darwin and the practices of man's closest mammalian "relatives" in the ani mal kingdom, it then becomes possible to construct a geneti cally acceptable explanation of how man's aboriginal past might well affect his concept of God today. First of all, scientists no longer consider debatable Dar win's thesis that mankind evolved from simpler forms of life.7 And biologists believe this evolutionary development is re 6. Dunn and Dobzhansky, Heredity, Eace and Society (New York: Mentor Books, 1954), p. 101.</page><page sequence="9">God The Father — And Mother : . . . 221 capitulated — albeit fleetingly and incompletely — as the human organism matures.8 Though biologists have not as yet been able to describe the relationship between man's racial history and his foetal and post-foetal growth in more than a very general way, they agree that the gill clefts and rudimentary tail which appear during foetal development reflect stages in man's pre-human racial history. And when infants are beset by cannibalistic urges or develop an intense fear of castration, there is reason to believe that later stages of man's racial history are then being recapitulated (6, 24). As suggested above, it may well be that the Oedipal urges youngsters experience are akin to the emotions which presumably ruled the inhabitants of the primal horde. If so, then the early years of childhood would probably be the time when the era of the primal horde is recapitulated. And to the extent a child's develoment retraces these primeval times, he would re-experience — albeit in a fleeting and at tenuated manner — the awe, fear, and guilt that aboriginal humans once felt towards the primal father. Now one of the fundamental lessons psychoanalysis teaches is that many of the ideas and emotions of early child hood, though forgotten, are not lost; rather, they live on in the unconscious, their derivatives often appearing during adulthood in dreams, symptoms, character traits, and in the widest variety of beliefs and practices. Hence, attitudes and feelings concerning the primal father recapitulated during early childhood may remain extant in the unconscious, ulti mately helping to mold man's ideas about God. And the influence exerted by this archaic heritage may prove so power ful that — as Freud believed — men may create for themselves a god in the image of the primal father. The father of childhood Freud never changed his mind about the part played 7. See Clark, footnote 4. 8. Thomas H. Morgan, The Scientific Basis of Evolution (2nd ed.; New York: Norton, 1935), pp. 172-177.</page><page sequence="10">222 C. G. Schoenfeld by the primal father in the genesis of the god concept. But in works like The Future Of An Illusion (12), he stressed instead the influence upon the god concept of children's ideas concerning their own father. This change in emphasis re flected Freud's belief that men form God, not only in the image of the master of the primal horde, but also — and probably to a greater extent — in the image of the father of childhood. Youngsters, Freud contended, often feel terribly afraid and helpless, especially during the first few years of their lives. Because of this, they look for protection to their father, who seems to be the embodiment of wisdom and strength. When these boys and girls grow up, they realize that their father is by no means the large and powerful figure he once appeared to be. Yet they also realize that vis-a-vis the ex ternal world, they are essentially just as powerless as they once were as children. To assuage the resulting sensations of helplessness and fear, they bring back — in the form of a deity — the mighty father of childhood. Having done this, they can feel secure again — for, as during childhood, they are protected again by a seemingly all-knowing and all-power ful father. (12) The emphasis Freud places here upon sensations of help lessness and the attempt to reduce them is reminiscent of Alfred Alder's belief that a desire to overcome feelings of smallness and inferiority constitutes a mainspring of human behavior. Paradoxically, however, Freud objected to Adler's emphasis upon the need to assuage feelings of inferiority — and stressed instead the ideas of omnipotence that youngsters presumably have before learning to distinguish clearly be tween themselves and the external world (7). Further — Freud's belief that men create a deity to help overcome feelings of helplessness seems more a philosophical than a psychoanalytic conclusion. Perhaps this is because philosophers like David Hume — long before the advent of psychoanalysis — advanced similar suggestions regarding the origin of mankind's deities.</page><page sequence="11">God The Father — And Mother: 223 No wonder, then, that mankind, being placed in such an ab solute ignorance of causes, and being at the same time so anxious concerning their future fortunes, should immediately acknowledge a dependence on invisible powers possessed of sentiment and intelligence. The unknown causes, which con tinually employ their thought, appearing always in the same aspect, are all apprehended to be of the same kind and species. Nor is it long before we ascribe to them thought, and reason, and passion, and sometimes even the limbs and figures of men, in order to bring them nearer to a resemblance with ourselves.9 It is also possible that the peculiarly non-psychoanalytic im pression made by Freud's explanation of why men transform the father of childhood into a deity stems from Freud's curi ous description of this process: Freud almost suggests that conscious (or possibly preconscious) mentation is responsible for the creation of God. ... the grown man . . . rightly feels that fundamentally he is just as helpless and unprotected as he was in childhood and that in relation to the external world he is still a child. Even now, therefore, he cannot give up the protection which he has enjoyed as a child But he has long ago realized that his father is a being with strictly limited powers and by no means en dowed with every desirable attribute. He therefore looks back to the memory-image of the overrated father of his childhood, exalts it into a Deity, and brings it into the present and into reality. (10) A number of psychoanalysts have accepted Freud's iden tification of God with the father of childhood (as well as with the primordial father). Thus Ernest Jones asserts that: "All we know about the history of . . . God confirms the con clusion reached as to the identity of God and father. It runs through all theological language and is there even extended to his representatives on earth, e.g. Papst, padre, pere, etc." (19) Jones, however, fails to emphasize Freud's suggestion that men deify their father because of feelings of helplessness. Instead, reasoning from his own psychoanalytic experience (as well as from references in Freud's works to motives for the creation of God other than helplessness), Jones asserts 9. David Hume, The Natural History of Religion.</page><page sequence="12">224 C. G. Schoenfeld that a need to obtain relief from the pressure of forbidden infantile wishes and feelings often dictates the transforma tion of the father of childhood into a deity. That is, the an xiety generated by repressed conflicts regarding the father may be so unbearable as to create a need for an appropriate object upon whom they can be projected. And in response to this need, a heavenly father is brought into existence, who, clothed with the attributes of the father of childhood, serves as a particularly apt object for these unconscious ideas and emotions. The mother of childhood Freud was greatly impressed by the part fathers play in the life of their youngsters, and in a famous sentence de clared : "I could not point to any need in childhood so strong as that for a father's protection." (7) Modern psychoanalysts, on the other hand, tend to emphasize the role of the mother during the early years of life. . . . what is believed to be essential for mental health is that the infant and young child should experience a warm, intimate, and continuous relationship with his mother (or permanent mother-substitute — one person who steadily 'mothers' him) in which both find satisfaction and enjoyment. (3) The child, in these decisive first years of his life has the experience of his mother as the fountain of life, as an all enveloping, protective, nourishing power. Mother is food; she is love; she is warmth; she is earth. To be loved by her means to be alive, to be rooted, to be at home. (15) Today, psychoanalysts know that the unconscious con flicts a youngster has regarding his mother are as profound as those pertaining to his father. They also know that the need for relief from the pressure exerted by these mother oriented conflicts is as great as the need generated by similar problems concerning the father. And, in addition, they have learned that the defence mechanisms employed to assuage repressed conflicts vis-a-vis the mother are much the same as those used to relieve father-oriented conflicts. It would there fore seem to follow that unconscious fears, desires, and long</page><page sequence="13">God The Father — And Mother : 225 ings directed towards the mother of childhood — like analo gous material having to do with the father of childhood — would be projected onto supernatural figures. This conclusion finds support in psychoanalytic studies of myths, folklore, and the like. Diana of Rome, Cybele of Greece, and Ishtar of Babylonia are but three of many myth ological goddesses considered by psychoanalysts to be mother substitutes (4, 5). And in the Christian religion, the Virgin Mary and the Holy Ghost are believed by Ernest Jones and others to perform a similar function (16, 17). But if, as psy choanalysts assert, the role of the mother is of paramount importance during early childhood, it is doubtful that her attributes would be projected onto subsidiary supernatural figures only. Rather, as R. S. Lee (Vicar of the Oxford Uni versity Church) suggests, it is more likely that the anthropo morphic deity of the Judeo-Christian religions incorporates traits not only of the father of childhood, but also of the mother of childhood (21). If so, it then becomes possible to under stand why, for example, certain attributes of this deity like "all-feeling" and "created and is vitally interested in man" seem more mother-oriented than father-oriented.10 This suggestion that the traditional anthropomorphic deity of the Judeo-Christian religions is a mother-image as well as a father-image is admittedly an extension of Freud's conception of God as simply an exalted father formed in the likeness of the father of aboriginal times and of early child hood. It is believed, however, that an acceptable theoretical justification for God being in part an exalted mother can be constructed in terms of psychoanalytic principles which Freud himself worked out and considered thoroughly sound. To begin — Psychoanalysts have learned that from birth onwards, humans tend to do their best to ward off the in tolerable feeling or state of mind known as "anxiety." Though exactly what anxiety is still remains a mystery, it certainly is akin to fear. Like fear, it is a reaction to danger, and is often accompanied by perspiration, rapid breathing, 10. See the anthropomorphic description of God supra.</page><page sequence="14">226 C. G. Schoenfeld sinking abdominal sensations, and other symptoms. Unlike fear, however, anxiety is ordinarily induced by internal rather than external stimuli, and the person who experiences it generally does not know why he feels as he does. But regard less of what anxiety may ultimately prove to be, psycho analysts have discovered that it tends to develop whenever a person is assailed by stimuli with which he cannot cope. Freud noted that infants are frequently beset by tensions their mother helps relieve. He reasoned that if a mother fails to appear when these tensions (the need for warmth, nourishment and so on) accumulate, chances are that her in fant's psyche will be overwhelmed by stimuli — and anxiety will automatically assail him. Freud believed that infants eventually begin to associate the absence of their mother with the onset of anxiety; and he concluded that until they learn that her absences are only temporary, they tend to become panicky whenever she dis appears for more than a short while. He [the young child] is not yet able to distinguish temporary absence from permanent loss; when he fails to see his mother on a given occasion, he behaves as though he would never see her again, and it requires repeated consoling experiences be fore he learns that such a disappearance on his mother's part is usually followed by her reappearance. The mother promotes this knowledge, so important to him, by playing with him the familiar game of covering her face and then to his joy reveal ing it again. Thus he is enabled, as it were, to experience longing without an accompaniment of despair. (13) It ought be noted here that infants who yearn for their mother's comfort and help probably hallucinate her presence (at least until their growing sense of reality makes this im possible). Such may be what happens when a hungry baby suddenly stops crying and starts to suck vigorously on his thumb. Presumably, however, the mother is only hallucin ated briefly, for the baby soon begins to cry again unless his mother has actually appeared in the meanwhile and has min istered to his needs. Impressed by the panicky reaction of infants (especially between the ages of six to eighteen months) when their</page><page sequence="15">God The Father — And Mother : 227 mother fails to respond to their urgent cries, Freud hypothe sized the existence of a fear of losing her. Freud believed this fear was caused by youngsters' learning to associate the absence of their mother with the presence of overpowering stimuli and the onset of anxiety. This fear may, however, have deeper roots than Freud thought: for, as the studies of Rene Spitz reveal, depriving young children of maternal care or mothering during the first two years of their life almost always has a catastrophic effect upon them — even when they receive the best of medical and physical care (25, 26). Thus, in a Foundling Home studied by Spitz, where children received impeccable medical and physical attention, but no mothering: "Of a total of 88 children up to the age of 2y2, 23 died" (25) ; the remainder of these youngsters developed at an excruciatingly slow pace and became asocial, disturbed, and feeble-minded. A child's fear of losing his mother generally begins to die out before he is two years old. But it does not simply dissolve away ; rather, it usually enters the unconscious, where it remains in its original infantile form. Sometimes it lies dormant permanently ; more often it is stirred up and sooner or later seeks to re-enter consciousness. There are many possible danger situations — especially during adulthood — that might rekindle this fear of losing the mother. An example that immediately comes to mind is the precarious situation of the soldier in a fox-hole who feels dreadfully frightened by the chaos about him and who longs for protection by someone or something. His predicament might well remind his unconscious of the many time during infancy when he felt equally alone and afraid and when his mother's comforting presence was what he desperately wanted. If so, the fear of losing his mother (presumably still extant in his unconscious) would probably be stirred up and seek to re-enter consciousness. At this point — according to orthodox psychoanalytic theory — the soldier would experience the onset of "signal" anxiety. This anxiety (assumed by Freud to be relatively mild, at first) would serve as a signal of danger,- it would</page><page sequence="16">228 C. G. Schoenfeld warn the soldier's psyche that unless something is done to calm his reactivated fear of losing his mother, he will soon feel the intolerable anxiety experienced during infancy when his mother failed to respond to his cries and his psyche was overwhelmed by stimuli. The soldier's childhood has, admittedly, long since come to an end; and presumably, he no longer needs or looks to his mother for warmth, comfort, and nourishment. It must be remembered, however, that the unconscious does not grow up, that the fears which enter it during early childhood remain in their original infantile form. Thus, on an uncon scious level, the danger still exists that the soldier's mother will not appear when needed and that as a result primal anxiety (the ultimate in psychic pain) will develop. Now if — as Freud believed — the absence of a sense of time is but one of the many characteristics of the uncon scious that resembles the mentation of early childhood, and if — as pointed out above — infants often gain temporary relief from tensions by hallucinating their mother, then con juring the mother of childhood into existence would appear to be a likely unconscious reaction to the arousal of the fear of losing her. The soldier's mother having "appeared," her disappearance need generate concern no longer; and temp orarily, at least, the soldier's unconscious fear that she will absent herself permanently — and the signal anxiety aroused by this fear — can subside. Hallucinating the mother of childhood would, however, violate the soldier's conscious sense of reality — and pre sumably fail to calm his conscious fears as well. The soldier might, it is true, begin to daydream (as do all of us) and imagine he is in a haven far from the battlefield; but his conscious ability to distinguish between fact and fantasy would soon intervene and destroy this illusion. It is there fore more likely that the soldier will eventually react as per haps most people do in precarious situations : like them, he will probably appeal for help to a benevolent deity who he believes is watching over him and will protect him from harm. (Praying to God for aid in difficult and dangerous</page><page sequence="17">God The Father — And Mother : . . . 229 situations is, of course, a time-honored practice: it is, for example : one of the major themes of the Psalms of David in the Old Testament. Make haste, 0 God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, 0 Lord. Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned backward, and put to confusion that desire my hurt. Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee; and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified. But I am poor and needy; make haste unto me, 0 God: thou art my help and my deliverer; O Lord make no tarrying. (11) Assuming that the soldier is able to believe that God is concerned about his welfare and is watching over him, he need dread his enemies no longer. But what is the relation ship between his beliefs about God and his unconscious fear of losing his mother? Why is it that once he starts praying to God, this fear and the signal anxiety aroused by it ordin arily begin to subside? The answers to these questions appear, once it is recalled that on an unconscious level, exalted personages frequently symbolize parents. "The idea of father or mother," for ex ample, "is constantly symbolized in dreams by that of king or queen respectively. "12 Now if — as Freud believed — God is simply a father-substitute and unconsciously so re garded, then praying to God would presumably have no ef fect upon the soldier's agitated unconscious fear of losing his mother.

For, if God is unconsciously re garded as a mother-substitute (as well as a father-image), if in God "we find the renewal of that care which our mothers gave to us when we were babies" (21), then the soldier's belief that God is nearby, watching over him, has the un conscious meaning that his mother is present, ready and able to minister to his needs. The soldier's unconscious craving for his mother having thus been satisfied, his fear of losing her — and the anxiety it aroused — can begin to subside. To summarize: an attempt has been made (using the extended example of the frightened soldier) to demonstrate that God's being in part a mother-image would help greatly to assuage the infantile, anxiety-laden fear of losing the mother — and presumably, other mother-oriented, unconscious fears and desires as well. But once it is assumed that the god concept contains mother-imagery which serves the needs of the unconscious, is it then possible to justify the further conclusion that this mother-imagery is a product of these un conscious needs? In answering this question, it is helpful to recall that the influence of the unconscious upon human behavior is en ormous ; that this influence extends not only to inconsequential things like slips of the tongue or pen, but also to the most significant areas of life — to the choice of a mate or a liveli hood, for example. Moreover, psychoanalytic research dem onstrates that unconscious motivation frequently plays a vital role in the realm of religion. One illustrative study that im mediately comes to mind is Freud's famous comparison of obsessive acts and religious practices. (11) Also, as psycho analysts have repeatedly observed in their daily work, the religious ideas of patients are often the product of uncon scious forces (19). Indeed, Ernest Jones has argued that: "The central conclusion based on psychoanalytic research is that the religious life represents a dramatization on a cosmic plane of the emotions, fears, and longings which arose in the child's relation to his parents." (19) Further — The traditional Judeo-Christian concept of</page><page sequence="19">God The Father — And Mother : 231 God was bequeathed by men who lived a long time ago, men who knew comparatively little about the world they lived in. Lacking the knowledge science has since made available con cerning the universe, they were that much less able than we to check conscious and unconscious wishfulfilling phantasies. We know approximately at what periods and by what sort of men religious doctrines were formed. If we now learn from what motives this happened, our attitude to the problem of religion will suffer an appreciable change. We say to ourselves: it would indeed be very nice if there were a God, who was both creator of the world and a benevolent providence, if there were a moral world order and a future life, but at the same time it is very odd that this is just as we should wish it ourselves. And it would still be odder if our poor, ignorant, enslaved ancestors had succeeded in solving all these difficult riddles of the universe. (12) Because of this — but especially because of the influence the unconscious exercises even today upon religious beliefs and practices — it certainly appears justifiable to conclude that the • anthropomorphic concept of God bequeathed by our ancestors contains parent imagery that not only fulfills the needs of the unconscious, but is a product of these needs as well. ########## To recapitulate: Freud analyzed only one notion of God — the traditional anthropomorphic concept of God of the Judeo-Christian religions. God — an all-knowing, all-feeling, all-powerful, rational and just living entity, who created and is vitally interested in man, who intervenes (directly or through intermediaries) in his life, and who ultimately will judge him. Freud believed this deity with human characteristics was created by mankind in the image of the father of primeval times and of early childhood. As has been seen, Freud's account of the aboriginal re lationship between fathers and sons needs correction, as does his theory as to why men create for themselves an exalted father. But it certainly appears likely that — as Freud be</page><page sequence="20">232 C. G. Schoenfeld lieved — men project the (actual and imagined) attributes of the primal father and their own father onto the god con cept. It is every bit as likely, however, that God is in part a mother-substitute created in the image of the mother of child hood. 13 Why Freud failed to reach this or a similar conclusion is, of course, a matter of conjecture. Lacking the data Spitz and others have since made available concerning the mother's role during infancy, he may simply have under-estimated her importance. After all, he did write : "I could not point to any need in childhood so strong as that for a father's protection." Had Freud fully appreciated the vital role of the mother as psychoanalysts now do, had he understood mankind's con siderable reluctance to renounce her protection, he might well have concluded that she never is really given up, that she reappears during adulthood in the guise of the traditional anthropomorphic deity of the Judeo-Christian religions. 13. It may be that God incorporates attributes of a primal mother as well — possibly the archetypal "Great Mother" described in Jung's works. 200 West 20th Street New York 11, N.Y. BIBLIOGRAPHY 1.
