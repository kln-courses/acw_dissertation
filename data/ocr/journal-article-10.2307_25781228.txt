<plain_text><page sequence="1">RICHARD BARRETT'S NE SONGE PLUS A FUIR: Beckett in Musical Translation? Catherine Laws While critics, actors, and even the author himself have constantly referred to the musicality of Beckett's texts, nobody has really addressed the question of quite how or why such an effect is achieved. It could be argued that the musicality actually stems from Beckett's approach to the problems of linguistic expression and his negative attitude towards the referential aspect of words. It is possible to trace the development of this attitude right through to later texts, such as Worstward Ho, wherein the referential content is minimal and the construction is musical in its self-reflective expansion from the smallest units. In this sense, Beckett's work pushes language towards a state of music. Additionally, since the impossibility of abandoning the use of words is so central to Beckett's literary enterprise, the musicality is intimately bound up with his "aesthetics of failure". Not surprisingly, many composers have been attracted to Beckett's work. Traditionally, there have always been two alternatives for word setting: either the composer aims to serve the words' own meaning and construction in the belief that the music may underline particular dimensions of the text, or else the composer asserts the right to create an entirely different work, recasting the textual rhythms in line with the new context and respecting the original solely from the point of view of its relevance to the composition. From either of these perspectives, however, the choice of a Beckett text seems strange; the increasing concentration of Beckett's work is such that no individual aspect of meaning or expression can be separated from another. To highlight a chosen dimension can only be detrimental to the piece as a whole, and the rhythmic precision is such that an additional layer of musical rhythm will destroy rather than enhance the text. Thus the first method is invalidated, and yet to choose a Beckett text for the second approach seems merely perverse: if the words are to be set in such a way as to create an entirely new work, then why choose a text that is already so complete? Despite these objections, there have been many attempts to set Beckett's words to music. More interestingly, however, certain composers have been drawn to Beckett's work, but have sought alternative ways of responding to it. Earl Kim and Roger Reynolds are both known for their use of Beckett texts, but the work of many other composers has passed relatively unnoticed. Bernard Rands' solo 289</page><page sequence="2">trombone piece Memo 2, for example, is derived from the structure of Not I, but uses none of the words, while Roger Marsh's Bits and Scraps takes fragments from How It Is. More recently, Mark Anthony Turnage's orchestral piece Your Rockaby uses rhythmic elements from Rockaby, and Barry Guy's Fizzles respond in purely musical terms to the Beckett texts. This article will explore some of the aesthetic issues surrounding both the 'musicality' of Beckett's texts and musical responses to them by focusing on the work of the British composer, Richard Barrett, who has produced a whole series of compositions with quotations from Beckett texts written into the scores. No attempt has been made to set the words to music ? indeed, it seems that such a concept would be anathema to Barrett ? but the repeated references to Beckett strongly suggest that Barrett must see his compositional projects in relation to the preoccupations of the author. On examining the works, many aesthetic parallels begin to emerge (and, naturally, to raise questions about the relationship between the different media). Richard Barrett is a relatively young composer, currently based in Amsterdam. His works have attracted a high degree of interest, thanks mainly to his association with the so-called 'New Complexity' movement. However, while he undoubtedly shares some of the concerns of other composers of complex music (such as its prime exponent, Brian Ferneyhough, and others such as Michael Finnissy, James Dillon, and Chris Dench), Barrett's relationship to 'New Complexity' is qualified by the strength of his individual concerns. For Barrett, complexity is a necessary result of the disappearance of common practice in music-making of the twentieth century. The current plurality of musical styles is such that composers can no longer rely upon any tradition of performance practice. Instead, every detail must be included in the score, and the intricate notation is therefore a necessary result of accounting for the complexities of any performance situation. Beyond this, however, the difficulty of realising such notation cannot avoid highlighting the performer's struggle to play the music: the emphasis is upon the difficulty, even impossibility, of the situation in which the performer is placed. Faced with such incredibly detailed notation, the player will inevitably fail to give a wholly accurate performance, and it is this process of failure which seems to interest Barrett. In this way, the reason for Barrett's attraction to the works of Beckett starts to become apparent. Clearly, it has nothing to do with any perception of "musical" elements within the texts, but instead lies in a common need to question the expressive possibilities available. 290</page><page sequence="3">Beckett is by no means the only figure to have inspired Barrett ? other works take their titles or include quotations from authors such as Pinget, Flaubert, Proust, Lautreamont, and from the painter Roberto Matta ? but he is by far the most prevalent source: indeed, Barrett's pre-compositional work for his string quartet / open and close consisted of reading and re-reading Beckett's entire output. Even those works which make no mention of Beckett retain the same attitude towards composition, opening up the question of quite how similar concerns can be examined in the different media of language and music. On the simplest level, Barrett is interested in monologues. Several of his pieces are for solo instruments (Tract for piano, air for violin, nothing elsewhere for viola, and knospend gespaltener for clarinet are just some examples), while his ensemble pieces often include monologic sections which may take the form either of cadenza-like passages or of the dramatic opposing of one instrument with the others. Ne songe plus a Juir ("Dream no more of fleeing") for amplified solo cello is one of Barrett's most successful pieces to date. The title comes from a painting by Chilean surrealist Roberto Matta; according to Barrett, it depicts "a dark, troubled atmosphere within which anthropomorphic figures are immersed in attitudes of desperation, imprisonment [and] oppression, surely influenced by the often brutal recent history of the artist's home country" (Toop 1993). The work, therefore, has a specific political background. In addition to the Matta reference, however, Barrett prefaces the score with a quotation from Beckett's Molloy ("Stories [...] I have not been able to tell them. I shall not be able to tell this one"), and a quotation from As the story was told is placed at the end of the piece: "No, was the answer, after some little hesitation, no. I did not know what the poor man was required to say in order to be pardoned, but would have recognised it at once at a glance, if I had seen it." Thus Barrett chooses accompanying quotations which might refer to the background political situation, but which could also describe the processes of composition or performance. The piece is divided very clearly into eight sections,1 such that the latter sections are far shorter than those of the opening (the last section comprising a single very long bar). Within these, the bars themselves form clearly demarcated units, and the performance details state that each bar should be played as if taking place in a single breath, the commas at the ends of bars acting as breaks for gasps of air: the effect is reminiscent of Beckett's How It Is, wherein the protagonist emits a stream of grammatically incomplete phrases, punctuated only by actual gaps in the text layout. 291</page><page sequence="4">In many ways, the first section sets up the pattern for those which follow. It begins with the minimal, bar-length gesture of a long, accented C# harmonic, high on the bottom string (which has been tuned a semitone lower than normal). The note begins loud and accented and diminuendos, becoming an ordinary stopped note with a small glissando (down to a B quarter-flat) at the very end. This bar is repeated five times, allowing the establishment of its gestural identity before each element is gradually developed (see example one),2 The short glissando at the end of the first bar is suddenly transformed, first by its extension (in bar 7) into a plunge down to the bottom open string. This low B natural (increasingly doubled by the next open string) then takes over as the focus of each bar, soon becoming the point from which each bar sets out, the music straining up into increasingly frantic glissandi and pizzicati.3 These opening bars provide the gestures from which the rest of the first section is generated, deploying increasingly frenzied material, often in quasi arpeggiando figuration but with microtonal pitch adjustments. While the rhythms are complicated and the pitches very difficult to find due to the constant use of quarter-tones, harmonics, and double-stops, the processes of gestural transformation are surprisingly easy to follow in general terms. Basic areas of pitch are established and become associated with different types of material, and because so much of this material involves expansion either out from the smallest intervals of a quarter-tone to a tone, or out to nearly an octave (i.e. to roughly the inversion of the quarter-tone or tone), and because the constant use of glissandi and harmonics generates an approximate sense of pitch, it is very easy to hear these isolated areas as transpositions and transformations of the original basic gestures. Once the bottom open string has been sounded, it becomes the major focal point of the section, its frequent occurrence doubled by the next open string implying a conception of the cello's strings as the resonating force from which each bar attempts to develop. The repeated plunging down to the bottom strings followed by the straining away and upwards into the higher reaches of the instrument, all demarcated by breaks for gasps of air, effects a sense of expression restraint. The impression is of a musician making repeated attempts to develop something of meaning. The oscillating glissandi unavoidably suggest a search, as if for the "right" notes, and Barrett's written instructions clarify this: the opening is marked "with barely articulated anger", and bar 26 is marked "increasingly incoherent, phrases becoming wild spasms". By the end of the section, the hysteria has degenerated into nothing but brief, frantic double-stopped glissandi 292</page><page sequence="5">Example 1: sao tii coc CD, -2 1 IC '5 CEIT -:-O 111 EL -) O '0 * 3+ + a&amp; ~ 0&gt; T z T c &amp; &gt;1 I i IX po-C/ 'I ~co JLA 293 C</page><page sequence="6">between the areas thus far pinpointed, often with the accompaniment of finger percussion; the impression is of something abandoned, of faith having been lost in the potential of the material to become meaningful. While the expansion of initial ideas and the recurrent exploration of particular pitch areas and intervals (usually themselves related to the opening) suggest development, the further the 'cellist moves from the fundamental notes, the more desperate the impression: the intervals covered by the glissandi widen, and the sound becomes more screeching and scraping (as a result of the higher harmonics). The sense of development is therefore revealed as misleading, and Barrett's use of the narrow opening glissando followed by the enormous breadth of the slide to the bottom open string seems almost to parody the very nature of motivic musical development ? in a sense, any music could have grown from such elements. The material of the following sections is generally more restricted than that of the first, each subdivision elaborating a search for expression within one distinct timbral colouring. The second section (marked "pesante, non legato: dogged and disjunct, becoming increasingly hysterical and convulsive"), is mainly concerned with glissandi (on stopped notes rather than harmonics). The main notes are stressed or accented, giving the effect of the left-hand fingers attempting to create a coherent line by hanging on to fixed pitches for as long as possible, before being pulled away to the next position. The third section is muted and sul tasto and is marked "veiled, melancholic, distant", while the fourth attempts to develop "grinding and laborious" quarter-tonal double-stops. The material of the latter sections becomes increasingly insubstantial, often hesitant and indistinct; in this way, each section re-articulates in different terms the attempt to develop something concrete, but defeat is virtually inevitable ? all that is left for the final one-bar section (marked "fleeting, delirious") is frantic finger percussion and col legno battuto behind the bridge: the articulatory paraphernalia remain, but the actual musical substance has evaporated. In a sense, then, sections two to eight follow the template of the first section, each comprising a sequence of bars which take similar starting points to one another and attempt to develop something substantial, before falling away in frustration. However, none of these passages achieves as strong a sense of searching through material as the opening. This is partly due to the fact that the initial section is allowed a wider range of material types; sections two to eight each have their own specific limited range of timbral characteristics, and while section one does have clear gestural preoccupations, its spectrum of sound sources is wider, ranging from ordinary double-stopped chords (with or 294</page><page sequence="7">without glissandi and covering a wide range of pitches), to harmonic glissandi, and sometimes including sul pont playing, jete, pizzicato, finger percussion, and arpeggio figurations. Each of the sections, therefore, explores different facets of section one, thus giving the impression of examining the residue of a fundamental in a manner correspondent to the internal workings of each bar. In this way, the first section could be viewed as providing, albeit inexplicitly, the range of expressive devices and sound qualities upon which the following sections will attempt to focus in order to attempt the derivation of a piece; it therefore seems appropriate that while the first section does initially (and briefly) delude the listener with impressions of development, the increasingly limited resources of successive sections restrict this ability still further, until the music can barely be said to have achieved anything more than futile gesturing. Such a clear depiction of failed expression could be interpreted in many ways. The most obvious is naturally the link, through the title, to the restrictions upon freedom in oppressive regimes (and Barrett has suggested that the impression should be of the music being "extorted from the cello as if under interrogation" (Toop 1988, 36)). However, in hearing (and especially in seeing) this piece performed, the most striking aspect of the situation is the fact of an instrumentalist attempting to play a piece of music. The effect of struggle is twofold, for while the music itself articulates a search through potential material, the player is faced with notation of great complexity from which a performance must be unravelled. In this sense, the struggle is that of the extreme performance situation, but also that of creating a piece of music with any real significance: the work is both complex and about that complexity. Barrett's delineation of the bars as isolated units limits the distance that can be travelled in a single bar; once the end of the "breath" is reached, the "cellist must break off, as if for a gasp of air". Within each bar, the rhythms are determined by computerised statistical processes, but the composer sees the proportions as correspondent to processes of perception, even if the means by which the rhythms are generated remain imperceptible. Barrett describes the rhythmic structures in the general terms of a "hierarchical ordering of "disturbances" in a chain of iterations" (Barrett 1987, 34) which moves from binary subdivisions (2:1) to ternary (3:2), and on to more and more distant subdivisions. Every rhythm is therefore conceived (and hopefully perceived) as a "more or less extreme departure from an implied 'fundamental'" (Barrett 1987, 34), and the irrational nature of the rhythms therefore becomes compositionally meaningful. 295</page><page sequence="8">The choice of pitch material is based on similar exponential processes but is initially derived from the fundamental nature of the cello. Each string was divided into eight overlapping registers and sampled vectorially, such that at any moment thirty-two pitches could potentially be available (though these notes are not necessarily all different). In this way, a large proportion of the "virtual material" ? as much as 85% in Ne songe plus a Juir, Barrett suggests (Toop 1991, 28) ? never finds its way into the piece, but the process corresponds to the duration of the work, generating centres of "pitch probability" which transform throughout and from which the actual written pitches are derived at further levels. Despite the mass of aural information, therefore, the sense of the open stings as gravitational "roots" towards which the bow is constantly drawn corresponds to the conception of the piece. The lack of detailed information regarding the precise mathematics makes it hard to ascertain whether or not the listener's perception of pitch relations is purely subjective. Nevertheless, the statistical basis of the procedures is clearly linked to the impression of certain pitch areas as centres of gravity to which the music constantly returns. While the listener may be unable to hear the pitches or rhythms as related in any specific sense, the obfuscatory timbres and irrational rhythms deliberately limit the clarity of the apparent processes of gestural transformation. Barrett puts the very nature of compositional practice into crisis by providing the listener with certain aural paths to follow, paths which appear to adhere to a pattern of cause and effect, but which suddenly break off and start afresh. Eventually, it seems that the gestures were merely empty; we are presented with what is, in traditional terms, a failed exercise in composition and a futile attempt to perform that composition. A completely successful realisation would be impossible, given the demands made upon the performer, and, in any case, how would an audience recognise a "successful" rendition of such a work? To an extent, even the listener is placed in a position of failure as, gradually, the ability to make sense of the music, except in terms of failure, is eroded. This is not, however, the whole truth, for Barrett faces us with the paradox that if the piece were truly unable to communicate ideas, we would surely not be able to perceive it as a depiction of failure. The audience is not simply presented with a player floundering around an instrument. Much of the time, the gestures could have formed the basis of an "ordinary" contemporary composition as well as any others; indeed, much of the opening material is as convincing as that of any piece. The listener may experience a degree of confusion, but providing 296</page><page sequence="9">that the initial processes are understood this will be recognised as meant. Barrett's choice of gestures has great semantic coherence; it is impossible to hear the first section other than as some kind of restraint being placed upon the cellist's expression. We are faced with an abstract piece of music that seems to challenge us to hear it as such ? Barrett seems to play on the fact that the only way to talk of this piece is in terms of struggle, torture, and desperation, and yet the piece is purely instrumental. To create such a visceral depiction coherently in abstract musical terms is difficult, and it is only due to the gestural specificity that listeners are able to locate themselves both actively within and passively without the musical experience, collating points of reference while at the same time observing the more far-reaching problematization of the nature of composition and performance. Thus Barrett demands that the listener places faith in him, accepting both the articulation of a coherent piece of music and its subsequent undermining as intentional: the coherence is transferred to another level wherein it is the very incoherence of the situation that is made clear. Additionally, this act of faith corresponds to that of both the performer (who knows that success is impossible, but must proceed as if it is not) and of the composer himself; Barrett has often talked of his music as proceeding "from fictions necessary for the personality of the composer to believe, to make acts of faith in order to carry the work through" (Toop 1988, 31). This suggests that all a composer needs to create a piece of music is confidence in the original material, but at the same time this faith is undermined by the realisation of the arbitrariness of that material and hence the whole composition. It should by now be clear that Barrett sees his work as articulating a "conscious aesthetic project" (as Christopher Fox puts it [Fox in press, 139]), which challenges normally accepted premises of musical performance. This "project" corresponds to Beckett's in many respects. Both are equally concerned with the viability of expression, and this is apparent at the levels of creation, performance (by instrumentalist, actor, or even, in Beckett's prose, by the actual protagonists), and reception. The player's struggle to create an effective performance from Barrett's elaborate notation corresponds to the struggle of Beckett's characters to express themselves coherently in words. Similarly, the incredible intricacy of Barrett's notation could be seen as comparable to Beckett's repeated assertion of the impossibility of expression and his rejection of authority. The effect of Barrett's notation, on one level, is to suggest a striving for the impossible; musical notation is itself an inevitably arbitrary means of determining events, and the inclusion of 297</page><page sequence="10">ever more fantastic detail serves to reinforce this elusiveness: the closer the notation comes to the absolute determination of the performance, the more obviously it falls short of this. Barrett and Beckett place their audiences in similar positions. Beckett's gradual negation of the semantic properties of words and his disintegration of the structures of syntax and narrative increase the involvement of the receptor. In plays such as A Piece of Monologue, Footfalls, Come and Go, or Play, the audience must piece together the pattern of events; this is taken to extremes in Not I, where the breakdown of the grammar is such that the listener must reconstitute some kind of narrative by recognising particular key words and phrases from the endless stream. Similarly, in some of the later prose, the syntax is so dissolved that the reader is involved, to a greater or lesser extent, in determining the grammatical function of the linguistic elements. Thus, in all these cases, the audience is placed both within and without the situation, experiencing the attempt to find meaning at the same time as observing this. Returning to music, while it could be argued that all music makes these same demands on an audience, in that the listener must extrapolate relations between sounding events in the absence of concrete semantics, Barrett clearly heightens this effect. The transparency of gesture in this piece is such that the establishing of large scale relationships is deceptively easy. However, it is precisely this that allows the audience to perceive the impossible complexity of the detail within the gestures, avoiding mere confusion. Without such clearly related gestural types, the audience would simply be faced with a mess of aural activity within which they could play no role and find no paths to follow. In Ne songe plus a fuir, then, the listener has the sense of following a process, relating the elements, and yet this apparent certainty is undermined both by the incredible and unfathomable detail within those gestures and, more importantly, by the uncertainty of the gestures themselves. Many of the apparently related events are based on approximations ? the return to the rough area of a previous note, or the use of repeated glissandi between approximately similar intervals. This opens up the question of whether or not such relations are intended, or whether they merely result from the listener's need to find a path through the detail (a question which is certainly ? and presumably deliberately ? not answered by Barrett's description of his compositional processes). Thus we are told that Barrett employs exponential processes which correspond to the processes of aural perception, yet we do not know if this is or is not the cause of the perception of gestural relationships. Just as Beckett attempts to deny the meaningfulness of his words by means 298</page><page sequence="11">of various anti-grammatical and anti-narrative strategies, Barrett puts into question the apparently meaningful relations in his piece. Similarly, the approximate nature of the gestures effects an ambiguity of function comparable to the positioning of linguistic elements in Worstward Ho. Both the stimulation and the subsequent undermining of the audience's interpretative faculties are vital to the work of Beckett and Barrett but, perhaps ironically, their effects are achieved by means of opposite processes. Beckett attempts the eschewal of semantics in order to effect a true syntax of weakness, thereby avoiding the limitations of fixed definitions. However, the absolute negation of semantics would involve the complete abandonment of words ? an act which is impossible due to both the compulsion to express and the fact of words as his (and our) primary mode of expression. Paradoxically, in later texts and plays the vestigial semantics add to the effectiveness of the texts; the presence of these minor reference points not only gives the audience something from which to build possible narrative representations, but, additionally, the choice of words is so careful that those referential meanings which do remain are employed either in the depiction of the minimal events or situations, or in the actual delineation of the writing process. In Worstward Ho, for example, the choice of words is so precise as to incorporate the unavoidable designative meanings of the words in the actual process of construction (hence the choice of the opening word "on" for its quality of propulsion, and the constant use of words relating to the need to express, to the need to attempt to situate the self in language). In order to create a comparable effect in music, Barrett elaborates a quasi-semantics, composing gestures which cannot but be interpreted in certain terms. A very delicate balance is therefore necessary; the semantic must be defined enough to give the desired impression of struggle and to allow the listener to perceive both the initial development of material and the gradual abandonment of this process. Simultaneously, however, the material must be handled in such a way that these perceptions are gradually undermined, the relationships becoming increasingly ambiguous. This equilibrium is even more precarious for Barrett than for Beckett, as the non-referential nature of music means that the semantic must itself be created. While in Beckett's terms it would seem that Barrett has the immediate advantage of working with material that is comparatively pure, for Barrett's particular project music is a more difficult art form within which to be working. Effectively, in Ne songe plus d fiiir Barrett creates a kind of minimal double articulation, allowing certain gestures to achieve a 299</page><page sequence="12">quasi-morphemic status; on one level this effects a more tangible semantic than is normally possible (or required) in absolute music, while the details themselves remain at the non-specific differential level equivalent to (though not precisely identifiable with) phonemes. The maintaining of such structures is, in music, very difficult; whilst too great an emphasis on the reference points would create too solid a degree of certainty for Barrett's project, the deployment of hardly recognisable gestures would, on the other hand, result in mere confusion: either way, the ambivalence of intention would disappear. The difficulty of achieving this balance is perhaps revealed in the ease with which the results can be misinterpreted; Barrett's output has generated hostility in some quarters (Hewett 1994) ? this is no doubt partly due to the uncompromising sound world, and also because, in general, it seems harder for people to accept the questioning of established structures by means of music than by the other arts. An unavoidable difference between the work of the composer and the writer is undeniably effected through their media; despite Beckett's disintegration of character, his presentation of incomplete or shade-like figures, and his attempts to remove his own authority from the texts, the written work always holds for us a stronger sense of subjectivity than a musical performance. Ironically, this usually results precisely from the effacement of the author; a text usually requires a speaking figure, usually in the form of a narrator (however uncertain we are as to the concreteness of their existence), and a text without such a figure usually assumes the status of a direct pronouncement of an author. Thus however uncertain the status of the enunciator, we begin from the assumption of this presence as a relatively stable entity ? an author's voice will displace that of a narrator, but if a narrator takes over, we temporarily efface the presence of the author, maintaining the sense of a concentrated source. In the musical process, however, the voice is automatically less unified, the composer and performer being more solidly co-present. The composer's voice can never be effaced, as is the case in most texts, the assumption being that the performer is there to serve this voice. Yet at the same time, the performer's interpretation cannot but enter into the equation to a lesser or greater degree, and in this way the construction of a musical source subject is inherently less stable than that of a text (even ignoring the lack of semantic grounding which heightens this effect). Certainly, this distinction is lessened by many of Beckett's techniques ? the undermining of the narrative perspective or of his own authority in the early novels, the lack of substantial "characters" in the later prose, and perhaps most strikingly, the treatment of actors as pure 300</page><page sequence="13">vessels for his "music" (especially in the shorter plays). Even here, however, it is easier for an audience to hear a voice of some kind, to secure a provisional sense of a subjectivity (however fragmented) from which the text emerges. This is perhaps the result of nothing more than the fact of the use of words and the weight of literary tradition behind the author, but it is nevertheless unavoidable to a certain degree ? even deconstructive criticism, which teaches the falsity of the tendency towards the designation of unified subjectivity admits its identification as the starting point from which suppressed meanings can be unravelled. Ultimately, the sense of a more substantial initial point of reference, however false, allows the audience to accept the subsequent questioning of those fundamentals: again, the resistance to the idea of music as active on different conceptual levels is stronger. Yet the harshness of the criticism of Barrett's music is still surprising, given the coherent gestural immediacy of a work such as Ne songe plus a fuir, while Beckett attempts the undoing of literary art's assumption of transcendental subjectivity, Barrett moves towards the same position but from the opposite direction, thanks to the different nature of his medium: his gestural outlines actually provide a process from which the listener can extrapolate relationships and hence construct a provisional sense of their own selfhood: here, this process is more concrete than is the case with most music. While Barrett's work does not, like that of Beckett, draw on humour in order to re-position the humanity of the work, the focus upon the grain of the instrumental sound perhaps provides a similar grounding from which to resist the submission to absolute failure or loss. The fundamental question posed by this music is how far such ideas can be taken. Ne songe plus a fuir comprises an effective summation of central concerns, but the use of such compositional elements is clearly limited and cannot be repeated piece after piece nor easily transposed into the more elaborate textural world of ensemble works. Barrett is hampered by the need to construct a quasi-semantic basis in order to proceed ? he can never take this as given, as can Beckett. Perhaps, however, this is a necessary risk, and one that is unavoidable for someone working at the limits of an art form. Barrett, like Beckett, certainly provides an effective problematization of subjectivity; everything in this world ? whether score, sound, structure, composing self, performing self, or listening self ? has a provisional immediacy and materiality which is progressively destabilised. Thus Barrett's work (especially the solo pieces) musically parallels many of Beckett's ideas while simultaneously providing 301</page><page sequence="14">instances of resolutely absolute music very much concerned with their own condition as abstract works in sound. Notes 1. Bars 1-33, 34-59, 60-81, 82-111, 112-120, 121-127, 128-133, and bar 134. 2. The main note decreases in length (until it is so short that the glissando itself becomes the opening gesture of the bars), and is doubled by the next string (also tuned a semitone lower than normal). The C# then has a B added to it, and this double-stop is gradually moved down in pitch until suddenly, at bar 14, the B is reiterated, transposed down to the low open string, and the opening glissando is inverted into movement upwards. 3. This element is itself further developed, initially by the addition of a C quarter-sharp to the bottom note, producing a double-stop which is a repeat of the opening pitches transposed inwards by a quarter-tone. While the double stop from which each glissando sets out gradually descends in pitch, that at the base starts to rise through bars 12 and 13, often by microtonal intervals.
