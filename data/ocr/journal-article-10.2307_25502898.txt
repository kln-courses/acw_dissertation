<plain_text><page sequence="1"></page><page sequence="2">GIE O R G E PAINTING PROTO-REALIST Eccentric 19th-century genre painter or the first Irish Realist? JULIAN CAMPBELL considers forgotten Irish artist George Sharp, in this his bicententary year. hen Irish artist Harriet O*Hagan, a student in Paris in the 1860s, began to exhibit at the Paris Salon, she cited the fact that she was '?l?ve (pupil) de Mm.Couture et Sharp'.2 The former w artist ran a successful cosmopolitan studio, and had been the teacher of Nathaniel Hone. The name 'Sharp' might have gone unnoticed amongst the scores of French names listed in the cat alogues of the Salon, the most prestigious exhibition in Europe, were it not for the fact that O'Hagan's family correspondence confirms she had been a pupil of George Sharp in Dublin.3 Sharp is given sympathetic mention in W G Strickland's Dictionary of Irish Artists published in 1913, and is referred to in The Painters of Ireland by Anne Crookshank and the Knight of Glin published in 1978.4A handful of his paintings are to be found in the collections of the National Gallery of Ireland, and the Crawford Art Gallery, Cork, but are rarely on display.5 Otherwise, he is an almost forgotten figure in Irish Art. Scarcely one picture by Sharp has appeared on the mar ket over the past generation.6 This obscurity is compounded by the fact that the artist rarely signed his own work, and that sometimes he is referred to as 'Sharpe', rather than 'Sharp'.7 During this year 2002, the bicentenaries of the births of writers Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas are being celebrated with gusto in their home country of France. George Sharp was also born in 1802 so perhaps it is timely, in this his bicentenary year, to remember, and reassess his work. For, in his day, he appears to have been a popular figure, associated with a circle of writ ers, collectors and fellow artists, including Charles Lever, William Smith O'Brien, R L West, John Lawlor, Thomas Bodkin, and several members of the Royal Academy in England. As Strickland remarks 'his works, principally portraits and domestic scenes, (were) painted in a broad and free style'.8 And, in the context of the relationship between French and Irish art in the 19th century, his interest in pedagogical methods and his role as a teacher in Dublin, his sympathy for poor and 'marginal' figures in society, his early embracing of French Realism, and his robust and expressive handling of paint, Sharp is a highly original figure in Irish art. Sharp was born in Dublin in 1802, the son of a Mr George Sharp of Molesworth Street, who was a steward at the Kildare Street Club.9 He may have studied first in London, for he had an address there, in Soho, in the mid 1830s.10 In Dublin, he lived at 19 Wentworth Place throughout his life. He married, he and his wife Alicia, had a daughter, (later Mrs Griffin) and probably a son, George W Sharp, who also became a painter. although a man of some eccentricity of character, he (George Sharp) was a general favourite'1. 1 George Sharp (1802-1877): Figures with Bear, 1847 oil on canvas (National Maternity Hospital); this work appears in Ireland's Painters by The Knight of Glin and Professor Anne Crookshank which is reviewed in the book review section of this issue. 2 Portrait of George Sharp 1847. artist unknown, Chalk on paper; present location unknown.

In the summer of 1835, Sharp was also, surprisingly, in Paris. His name is recorded in the regis ter of copyists at the Louvre, on the date of 4 August 1835, as a student in the atelier of Picot. His age is given as thirty-two, and his address as 39, rue de la Cheupin.12 Fran?ois Edouard Picot (1786-1868) was a successful neo-clas sical painter of history and genre. He ran a popular independent Studio, which, by the 1840s had sixty or seventy pupils.13 Amongst these were many names that were later to become suc cessful academicians, or teachers in their own right, including Pils, Cabanel, Bouguereau, Henner and Gustave Moreau. Picot prepared his pupils for entry to the Ecole des Beaux Arts. Students worked hard, working from 6.30-11.00 in the morn ings. They drew from the plaster cast. Because of the impover ished status of many pupils, at lunchtime they turned the studio into a dining room. In the afternoons, students copied Old Master paintings14 in the Louvre. Although Dutch student Joseph Israels, later to become a leading member of the Hague School, was ticked off by Picot for drawing from the live model prema turely,15 the master was also enlightened in his emphasis on the importance of 'the sketch', and this seems to have had a liberat ing effect upon Sharp. (Later, Picot became a teacher at the Ecole and more critical of the Romantic School). Sharp's presence as a student in Paris at this early date is significant This was the heyday of French Romanticism and artists such as Delacroix were chal lenging the foundations of Neo-Classicism. On his return to Ireland, Sharp continued to exhibit at the RHA. One of his exhibits, in 1841, was a portrait of the novelist Charles Lever. Sharp also made excursions out of Dublin, to the Claddagh in Galway, and to Inishowen, Co. Donegal, and showed landscapes of these at the RHA. However, examples of his land scapes are not presently known. On the 9 May 1842 he was elected an associate of the Academy.16 He exhibited at the Northern Irish Art Union in Belfast that year, and won prizes at the Royal Irish Art Union in Dublin.17 He began to work as a teacher. Sharp appears to have been popular among fellow artists. A chalk drawing, executed in 1847 shows the artist in middle age, at the height of his career (Fig 2).18 He has strong features and build, yet there is a certain melan choly around his eyes. In the same year, he painted a large canvas of Figures with Bear. A couple of years later, sculptor John Lawlor made a portrait bust of Sharp.19 In 1847 French portraitist Alexander Dupuis published a work relating to the general teaching of drawing, and Sharp translated this into English.20 Prompted to write his own treatise on the sub ject, he read a paper on methods of teaching drawing to the RDS in January 1852. The same year he published a pamphlet entitled A lecture on Elementary Drawing in Dublin.21 Sharp believed 'Drawing...to be the great essential element of all the arts of Design'.22 He wrote, ' I have...myself been witness to the working of the system at Paris, and my experience as a teacher has so...convinced me of its efficiency...I have accordingly established an academy for a small class of pupils...'23 Sharp rec ommends that students make use of simple plaster models rather than 'highly- finished heads from the antique'.24 He encouraged his students to progress step by step, rather than becoming caught up in detail at an early stage. In the context of methods taught in British and Irish schools, with an emphasis on fussy detail, Sharp's method appears quite radical. He is recommend ing an approach of greater simplicity. In the same year, 1852, Sharp also displayed his 'models to facilitate the teaching of drawing' at the National Exhibition of 126 I IRISH ARTS REVIEW WINTER 2002</page><page sequence="4"> WINTER 2002 IRISH ARTS REVIEW | 127</page><page sequence="5">GEORGE SHARP: PROTO-REALIST to gain a strong impression of Sharp's original work and person ality. His Figures with Bear 1847 is his largest canvas extant (Fig 1) an intriguing and somewhat humorous work, which blends ele ments of 19th-century Irish genre painting with French Romanticism. Particularly striking are the barefoot girl on the left, who has a cross, a rosary and other trinkets hanging from her waist, and who peeps at the viewer out of the corner of her eye; the dark-complexioned man in worn clothes, perhaps an ex-soldier or travelling gypsy and the large bear to whom he feeds tit-bits. The white gleam in the eye of the bear, and of a tousle-haired terrier, give a curious, slightly anthropomorphic quality, peculiar to Sharp's work. The treatment of the background landscape: blasted tree and stormy sky, and bold, expressive brushwork, the 5 George Sharp: Creeping to School, 1862 oil on canvas 76x49cm (National Gallery of Ireland) 6 George Sharp: The Cock that Crew in the Morn 1828 oil on canvas 64x76cm (National Gallery of Ireland) the Arts, Manufacture and Products, Cork.25 The exact nature of these 'models', perhaps simple copies of antique figures, or solid geometrical shapes, is not known. In 1856 Sharp approached the newly opened School of Design in Belfast, offering to demonstrate his system. But he was rebuffed.26 In the same year, he published Two Letters on the Subjects of Elementary Drawing in Dublin. With his interest in French teaching methods Sharp may have been attempting to introduce the Parisian atelier system into Dublin, both in the practice of the studios being under the supervision of one master, and in the drawing methods used. Among his pupils was Harriet O'Hagan. Presumably Sharp encouraged her to go to Paris for further study and gave similar advice to other students. At some date during the 1850s or early sixties Sharp himself made a return visit to Paris to study in the atelier of Thomas Couture.27 Sharp was now a middle-aged and to some extent, an established artist. Yet he may have felt at home in the cosmo politan milieu of this atelier, where not only French, but also many American, and a few Irish pupils, including Nathaniel Hone had studied. Although Couture's Realism was very different from the Neo classicism of Picot, in some ways there were similarities of approach: the encouragement to copying at the Louvre and the belief in the importance of the sketch. Couture's pupils often made painted sketches of genre subjects or a single figure in an interior. Undoubtedly, Sharp would have responded to the broad, bold manner of painting that the French artist encouraged. In Paris, Sharp would have had the opportunity of studying paintings by 17th-century Spanish masters, such as Velasquez, at the Louvre, and seeing the work of contemporary French Realists', such as Daumier and Ribot. His work was to be profoundly influ enced by the example of these artists. From Paris, he may have made a journey to the South of France; one painting Soeur de Charit? was painted at Avignon.28 During these years Sharp continued to exhibit genre subjects, often of a single figure: a fisherman, a gleaner, a fortune teller, a minstrel boy, or The Hurdy Gurdy Boy,19 showing his interest in country people, or poor wanderers. Studies made of Connemara Peasants from Life, in the costume of the day, suggest almost an ethnographic interest. Another picture curiously utilised a quota tion from Sala for its title: 'Women have a special aptitude for teaching; they are patient, willing, persuasive, and the rest'30. During the 1860s, a 'George R Sharp,' presumably the artist's son sent pictures to the RHA from a Wentworth Place address, and a G W Sharp exhibited at British shows.31 Sharp's later years were sad ones. In 1868 he suffered paralysis and, in Strickland's words 'though he made attempts to work, Sharp was never able to paint or draw again'.32 Without his being able to work, the artist's family evidently fell into financial hardship. But many colleagues came together to help him; in London thirty-three artists contributed sketches. These were bound in a large volume by Marcus Ward in Belfast and along with fifteen framed paintings and two pieces of sculpture; these were sold at Cranfield's print shop in Dublin.33 Sharp died in 1877 at the age of seventy-five. Even with so few oil paintings presently known, it is possible 128 I IRISH ARTS REVIEW WINTER 2002</page><page sequence="6">paint applied in swathes, suggests the artist's familiarity with French Romanticism. Three small canvases characterize Sharp's work at the height of his career. The curiously titled Creeping to School c.186234 shows a reluctant schoolboy with hat and satchel (Fig 5). It illustrates the artist's idiosyncratic humour, as he observes his son, perhaps, or remembers his own schooldays. Although set in an undefined landscape, the rudimentary shadows cast indicate that the figure was posed indoors. The three-quarter pose and fluid brushwork characterize single figure studies painted in Couture's atelier, for example, the latter's Young Italian (Mus?e' des Beaux Arts, Lille). Moreover, there are close affinities with the vagabond-type found in such paintings as The Ancient Hospital of Saint Yves by Jean Jacques Monanteuil (Mus?e' des Beaux Arts, Rennes). Sharp's Repose (Fig 4) and Old man Praying (Fig 3) are striking pictures, probably versions of the same model: an elderly man with eyes closed and hands clasped35. In the former, the clothing of the man and battered boots are rendered in a broad and painterly style. The old man's eyes are lowered, and his hands clasped, as if in contemplation or prayer. Bright light falls upon the forehead of the man, and upon the earthenware container, casting dark shadows. The subject, set in a shallow space and the use of dark tones, are reminiscent of domestic genre subjects by Theodore Ribot, for example, The Cook Accountant, 1862. The old man in both Sharp pictures, and indeed in Figures with Bear wears a red cravat, a note of colour Sharp used to contrast the dark tonality of his pictures. In the Crawford Gallery picture, which formerly belonged to Thomas Bodkin, the man has colour in his cheeks, although his expression is curmudgeonly; he fingers his rosary, and perhaps reflects upon the skull. A crucifixion is visi ble in the shadows behind. Here, the dark-toned subjects, and the reflection upon mortality, indicate Sharp's deep admiration for the 17th-century Spanish School and artists such as Zurbaran,36 Ribera and early works by Velasquez. Another picture in the National Gallery (Fig 6) shows a large fowl and an unidentified animal, perhaps a small bear again painted in a vigorous, expressive style, indicative of the strange undercurrent present in Sharp's work. Sharp's earthy tones and the lack of interest in detail evident in his pictures are at odds with Victorian genre painting. The use of heavy paint and sweeping brushstrokes, his interest in and sense of identification with down-trodden members of society in threadbare clothes, bring him close to the Realist tradition in French art: from the le Nain brothers, the drawings of Watteau, to the contemporary realism of Daumier and Ribot37. Sharp's idio syncratic paintings have a sombre, but also humorous quality. On first acquaintance, Sharp's pictures may appear old-fashioned, even clumsy, but his broad, expressive manner of painting and his curiously blurred brushwork and peeping eyes, (as well as the anthropomorphic quality of his animals); have an unusual psy chological quality comparable to Ribot's and a modern sense of unease that anticipates 20th-century Expressionism. Hopefully, more paintings by this almost forgotton artist will come to light, and allow us to gain a fuller picture of his oeuvre as a whole. Considering the artist in his bicentenary year, George Sharp has claims to have had an early interest in French Romanticism and to be the first Irish artist to embrace French Realism.

He tended to work at night, so his pictures have a dark, candle lit quality to them. WINTER 2002 IRISH ARTS REVIEW 129</page></plain_text>
