BRILL LTD- PUBLISHERS- LEIDEN (NETHERLANDS) THE MEANING OF CHINA'S MOST ANCIENT ART AN INTERPRETATION OF POTTERY PATTERNS FROM KANSU (MA CH'ANG AND PAN-SHAN) AND THEIR DEVELOPMENT IN THE SHANG, CHOU AND HAN PERIODS BY A. BULLING 1952. Xii + I5o p., 8 pI., 79 fig. Price, cloth bound, Gld. 34.- This book deals with a few patterns painted on pottery in a remote corner of China. Nevertheless, it will interest a wide public because these geometrical patterns are typical for late neolithic or early bronze- age civilizations in general. The interpretation of ancient motifs or art is of immediate and general interest. It is, however, a controversial subject which should be handled with greatest care. It is perhaps only in China that a research of this kind may be successful, as the con- tinuity of Chinese civilizations and the use of similar patterns in the Shang, Chou, Han and even later periods provide a sound basis for such an investigation. The study is restricted to patterns such as circles, spirals, triangles, lozenges, trees and anthropomorph figures, that is to motifs which can also be found in the art of later periods. The study shows that a sort of calendar cult was the basis of ancient Chinese religion, ritual and art reflecting a conception of the world of which man was an integral part and, in general, such a conception was most likely the matrix of the most ancient civilizations in Asia and Europe. For all those interested in comparative religion and cosmology Dr. Bulling's material will be of particular interest. MEDE VERItRIJGBAAR DOOR BEMIDDELING VAN DE BOEKHANDEL</page></plain_text>
