<plain_text><page sequence="1">Purposiveness: Teleology Between Nature and Mind, ed. by Luca Illetterati, Francesca Michelini, Frankfurt a.M., Ontos, 2008, pp. 224. Recent years have seen a remarkable rise of interest in discussions of teleology. The question of how to make sense of the concept of purposiveness in accounts of nature and, in particular, in the study of living nature is receiving ever-growing attention. Luca Illetterati and Francesca Michelini's collection of papers forms part of this revived interest in natural teleology. The guiding question of the volume is a fundamental one: has modern science made teleological notions of nature obsolete? Or do we need to retain some kind of teleological conception for an adequate understanding of nature? Insofar as teleological thinking entails either a type of anthropomorphism or the threat of backward causation, Illetterati and Michelini point out, the rejection of teleology presents part of the very basis of modern science. And yet, as the editors argue, «things are not so simple» (p. 3), for teleological terminology still plays a considerable role in the biological sciences. It is against this background that the book raises the important question of whether we can make sense of teleology as a legitimate component of our thinking about the natural world. The ten papers included in the collection propose different answers to this question, and yet they all share the assumption that natural teleology is left unexplained by reference to in telligent design. The idea that the apparent purposiveness of nature could be elucidated by the existence of an intelligent being that has designed nature according to a plan is unani mously rejected. The question of the book can consequently be summarised more pointedly: has modern science made teleological notions of nature obsolete, or can we retain a concep tion of nature as purposively organised and striving towards some end without making sense of that end as one set by an intelligent designer? Can we, in other words, defend a notion of teleology that provides an alternative to its complete rejection by a purely naturalistic account, on the one hand, and the apparently illegitimate assumption of a mind that has intentionally designed nature, on the other? The discussions included in the volume aim to provide alter natives to the two poles of this contrast in an attempt to find a stable position of «teleology between nature and mind». Notable about the way the volume addresses this question is its broad combination of his torical and systematic interests. Out of the ten papers included in the book, the first five deal with some of the historical background to contemporary discussions on teleology. While the Kantian position plays centre stage (with two papers by Predrag Sustar and Cord Friebe fo cusing exclusively on Kant), other contributions discuss the historical development predating Kant's account (Antonio Nunziante on Leibniz) and later attempts at going beyond the Kant ian position (Michelini on Hegel and Nicoletta De Cian on Schopenhauer). The five papers in cluded in the second half of the volume turn their focus to questions about the compatibility of teleology with contemporary science (contributions by Illetterati, Georg Toepfer, Paolo Costa, and Andreas Weber and Francisco Varela) and the role of teleological thinking in rela tion to the Foucauldian notion of 'biopolitics' (Tristana Dini). It is noteworthy, however, that although the contributions can be divided into those that are more historically focused and those that are guided primarily by systematic questions, the collection manages to combine these two perspectives effectively. Critical discussions of Kant's and Kantian conceptions of teleology, for example, can be found not only in the papers by Sustar and Friebe, but also in the contributions by Illetterati and Toepfer. More generally, whether they do so from a more historical or systematically focused perspective, the papers aim to spell out a coherent account of the apparent purposiveness of living nature. The book begins with a paper by Nunziante who discusses Leibniz's development of the «paradigm of "life"» from the «paradigm of "machines"» (p. 29). It is only by starting with, and «STUDI KANTIANI» · xxiii · 2010</page><page sequence="2">ΐ6θ RECENSIONI reflecting on, the Cartesian idea that living beings are machines, Nunziante argues, that Leib niz differentiates the particular character of organic beings front inorganic objects as living rather than non-living machines. Leibniz thus begins with the idea of a purposively organised artefact whose parts, while interacting with one another according to mechanistic laws, are organised in such a way as to carry out an end. Organisms are defined, on this account, ac cording to a functional relationship between the whole and its parts. It is precisely this rela tionship of parts and whole, however, that leads Leibniz to go beyond the purely mechanistic paradigm in order to capture the particular character of living beings. What is special about living machines, Leibniz realises, is their capacity for plasticity and self-maintenance. This ca pacity is dépendent, according to Leibniz, on the perceptive activity of organisms, on their ability to perceive the world. Once reference to perception (or, as Nunziante suggests, «inten tionality»: p. 28) has been allowed into the pitture, however, we have moved quite far on from the mechanistic paradigm. We have introduced the idea that the character of organisms is not only explicable by means of the relationship between parts and whole but must refer also to an organising capacity that makes the unity of the whole possible fforn within. It is the intro duction of this idea, Nunziante argues, which can be understood as a move «increasingly to wards "mental" results» (p. 28). Nunziante's account of Leibniz may raise many questions about what a satisfactory un derstanding of naturai teleology should consist in. It nevertheless, or precisely thereby, pro vides a helpful background to the subséquent discussion by turning attention to two concerns that lie at the centre of Illetterati and Michelini's volume. First, in analysing how Leibniz at tempts to make sense of organisms on the paradigm of machines, Nunziante considers the question of whether we can understand organisms according to the artefact model or whether we need to presuppose an internai organising principle. If the purposiveness of nature cannot be understood by reference to the intentionality of an external agent, who sets ends and de signs nature according to those ends, then nature's ends may more plausibly be regarded as internai to nature itself. Nunziante's account of Leibniz thus provides an initial account of the Kantian distinction between external and internai teleology. Second, if, as Leibniz suggests, the paradigm of machines needs to be modified in order to account for an internai principle of purposiveness, then this raises the further question of how to find a coherent conception of such a principle. Can we really make sense of a purposively organising principle as inter nai to a machine? Or does reference to an internai principle, as Nunziante puts it, have «pure ly heuristic valence» (p. 24)? Both these questions, one about the correct interprétation of nat urai teleology as either internai or external to the organism, the other about the status of teleological accounts as providing either objective claims or merely heuristic considérations about nature, lie at the centre of discussions in this volume. In the second article, Sustar shows that Kant's answer to the first question goes via an an swer to the second question. On Kant's account, as Sustar sets out, organisms cannot simply be defined as organised, functionally integrated wholes; this would not adequately distinguish them fforn machines. Instead, they must be defined as naturai ends, that is, as organised be ings that are both cause and effect of themselves. The Kantian account of organisms, as Sus tar spells out, are characterised by internai purposiveness, they are not only purposively or ganised but they also organise themselves. The problem that this raises, however, is precisely the problem at the heart of our second question: how can we understand this account as pro viding a coherent conception of living nature? In what sense can something be both cause and effect of itself? For Kant, this prompts what Sustar calls the «contradiction issue» (p. 35), the problem of making sense of a teleological principle as part of nature which, at the same time, is taken to be thoroughly causally determined. As Sustar sets out with admirable clarity, Kant's solution to this «issue» is a «methodological turn», a move away from the attempt to give an «essentialist» analysis of the organism concept to providing a «methodological» analysis (pp.</page><page sequence="3">RECENSIONI l6l 33 ff·)· Rather than spelling out that the very nature of organisms is characterised by purpo siveness, Kant's aim, according to Sustar, is to show that a teleological conception of living na ture «relates to some of the most important tasks in scientific practice» (p. 35). On Kant's ac count, Sustar points out, teleology présents a heuristic device for the study of living nature. It is not an aspect of the character of nature itself. Similarly, as Friebe argues in the next chap ter, it is Kant's epistemological characterisation of the purposiveness of organisms that is ul timately defensible in the light of current biology. On this account, we must consider living nature teleologically because of the peculiar constitution of the human understanding rather than the internai causal structure of living beings themselves. One may wonder, however, whether Sustar, and to some extent also Friebe, are not brush ing over some difficulties when they assume that the methodological, and epistemological, turn to a heuristic understanding of naturai teleology lets Kant avoid the contradiction be tween teleology and efficient causality with which he struggled in the Antinomy of Teleo logical Judgment. The large, and growing, literature on this antinomy testifies that most com mentators are by no means convinced by the sufficiency of this heuristic reading of the principle of teleology as a solution to the antinomy. Moreover, one may question Sustar's fur ther claim to the superiority of his own methodological interprétation of naturai teleology over Hannah Ginsborg's normative account. According to the normative account, to consider a living being teleologically is to assume that it ought to be a certain way. Sustar objects, however, that to think of the apparent purposiveness of living beings in this way, does not ac count for «the explanatory and prédictive import of function-ascribing statements in biology» (p. 49). It does not show how thinking that something ought to be such and such can explain why it is such and such, or even predict that it will be such and such. And yet, while this objec tion seems correct, I believe that it does not by itself show that the methodological reading really is the superior alternative to the normative reading. The two readings may, instead, pré sent accounts that perform différent but complementary fonctions. Thus, the methodological reading could account for the use to which explicitly teleological concepts are put in the study of organisms. Reflecting about their apparent purposiveness would advance attempts at explaining and making prédictions about living nature. The normative reading, by contrast, could stili be taken to account for the special character of our experiential awareness of organisms. Independently of the heuristic use of teleological concepts in science, one could argue that our very experience of living nature is characterised by a normative element. The normative account could thus be argued to be compatible with Sustar's methodological reading insofar as it spells out the particular character of our experience as based on regulative reflection about the purposive organisation and directedness of nature. Subséquent chapters, however, raise a more general criticism of what Sustar présents as Kant's methodological turn. As Illetterati puts it, the methodological reading fails to supply a satisfactory account of the organism insofar as it leaves living nature ultimately «incompré hensible» (p. 160). If ali that we can say about the apparent teleological character of organisms has the status of a purely methodological tool for science and if, furthermore, there is no adequate non-teleological conception of organisms, then we have no means of actually com prehending the nature of living beings. Other papers included in the collection thus présent différent attempts to go beyond the purely heuristic reading of naturai teleology. Francesca Michelini and Nicoletta De Cian, for example, discuss différent versions of an ontological con ception of naturai teleology to be found in the work of Hegel and Schopenhauer. Thus, De Cian shows how Schopenhauer asks for the «more primitive root» (p. 109) of our regulative teleological judgments. He finds it in the original, universal but unconscious will of which the human intellect is only a secondary product. Once we agree with Schopenhauer's metaphysical claim that everything in nature is the result of the «unfolding» (p. 106) of this uni versal will, including our own minds and their capacity for teleological judgment, the teleo</page><page sequence="4">1Ó2 RECENSIONI logicai conception of organisms, De Cian argues, can be given an ontological grounding. It is this conception of a non-intentional root of naturai purposiveness that, according to De Cian, could be ffuitfully combined with evolutionary conceptions of biological functions. For do ing so, she argues, would help to avoid explaining biological purposes and functions by refer ence to the theological model of an intentional intellect. De Cian remains rather suggestive, however, about how the non-intentional 'primitive root' of teleology should be understood in positive terms. It is thus left open how we should conceive of this more fundamental prin ciple that underlies, for instance, an organism's instinct of survival if we do not want to retain Schopenhauer's notion of a non-intentional all-pervading will. As Michelini argues in her paper, for Hegel, too, the teleological principle of living nature is no longer regulative but becomes «the inner constitutive law of life» (p. 85). On the Hegelian account, while the Kantian understanding of naturai teleology is transformed into a consti tutive principle, it remains a principle of purposiveness internai to the organism itself. What is important in this conception of the character of the living, as Michelini stresses, is that life is not construed as an additional element, a force or entity, over and above the physical and chemical properties of the parts of an organism but something that emerges from the rela tional organisation of those parts within a system. This conception of life as a systemic and relational property could, of course, be understood in a number of différent ways, including not only «organicist» (p. 76) but also physicalist conceptions of the relations between parts of a system. Interestingly, however, Michelini argues that we can conceive of the Hegelian con ception of the internai purposiveness of organisms in the context of modem conceptions of 'autopoiesis', that is, the autonomous self-production of organisms.1 This conception is spelt out in a previously published but revised paper by Weber and Varela that is included in this volume. According to the authors, what distinguishes the autopoietic approach ffom other ac counts of self-organising Systems is the idea, inspired by Hans Jonas among others, that life can only be understood in connection with subjectivity.2 Thus, the authors argue that living beings are systems that reproduce themselves and, indeed, have their «existence by on-going self-organization as their goal» (p. 204). In this way, they claim, organisms must be understood as having subjectivity, or a «point of view» (p. 212). It is precisely this idea, however, that seems to présent the key difficulty with the autopoi etic understanding of living systems. For how can we make sense of the thought that we should understand ali organisms as having subjectivity and as being, in Weber and Varela's terms, «active agents» (p. 209) without also ascribing to them some form of mindedness or in tentionality? This question is particularly pressing insofar as the authors want to include even the most minimal forms of life in the class of autopoietic systems. In his closely related paper, Paolo Costa refers to the «irreducible phenomenological nature of our understanding of the living» (p. 195). An understanding of what being alive means can only be gained, he argues, «ffom the inside» (p. 195), that is, from first-hand experience. This, however, raises the ques tion of what exactly it is that we can come to know through such first-hand experience. Can this experience really teach us anything about the objective character of nature? Or are we, by relying on first-hand experience, merely reading something into our experience of other, per haps very différent, living beings? One may wonder whether, by understanding ali organisms as active subjects, we are not projecting onto them the kind of intentional purposiveness that we know from ourselves and that, in accordance with the Kantian position, we can attribute to nature only by means of an analogy. These questions, it seems, raise doubts about the prospects that the autopoietic account of organisms will ultimately overcome the Kantian idea of teleology as a purely regulative principle. 1 Michelini here relies on the conception of autopoiesis as introduced in H. R. Maturana, E J. Varela, Autopoiesis and Cognition: The Réalisation of the Living, Dordrecht, Reidei, 1980. 2 H. Jonas, The Phenomenon of Life, New York, Harper &amp; Row, 1966.</page><page sequence="5">RECENSIONI 163 The question of whether teleology should be understood according to the model of hu man agency and intentional purposiveness is discussed in more détail in the contributions by Luca Illetterati and Georg Toepfer. Their discussions make apparent the close connection be tween the two concerns about teleology identified at the start. The second question of the status of teleological judgments is shown to be intimately linked to the first question of the particular content of teleological conceptions of living nature. Thus, as Illetterati argues, it is Kant's assumption that teleology is essentially tied to intentionality that leads him to ascribe to teleological judgments a purely regulative status. It is because Kant understands purpo siveness always in the context of a purpose-setting intellect that leads him to conclude that we cannot know purposiveness in nature but can only reflect about nature as if it were purposive. To overcome Kant's heuristic conception of teleology, Illetterati maintains, we therefore need to replace it with a conception of teleology that avoids the link with intentionality. The pur posive organisation and directedness of organisms, he daims, should be understood in terms of a circular causality. Similarly, Toepfer stresses the fundamental différence between naturai and intentional teleology. According to him, the latter consists in the «action directed towards an anticipated end state», while the former concerns processes that «are part of cyclical Sys tems» in which the parts are defined by their causai role within the system (p. 176). Both Illetterati and Toepfer thus présent a direct inversion of the Kantian position on in ternai purposiveness, that is, a constitutive account of teleology that cuts the link with inten tionality. And yet, this alternative account, too, raises questions. First, one may worry that the conception of naturai teleology according to circular causality and cyclical systematicity, to which Illetterati and Toepfer refer, does not satisfactorily distinguish living Systems from non living ones. If naturai teleology is nothing more than the causality of certain cyclical Systems with feedback loops, then other inorganic systems in physics and chemistry may equally well be described as teleological. That they are not, however, suggests that teleology may include more than circular causality. While Toepfer is aware of this objection, he considers it to be un problematic. Insofar as biology, in contrast with the other naturai sciences, deals exclusively with systems of mutually dépendent parts, he argues, it is an «epistemic décision» (p. 171) to think about these systems in teleological terms. Thus, although we may consider biological systems differently, it is methodologically useful to regard them in this way. This, of course, sounds very much as if teleology was, again, reduced to a merely methodological principle. And yet, such a principle, according to Toepfer, does in fact refer to actual processes in nature. This, in turn, raises a second question. For if naturai teleology, in Toepfer's sense, has noth ing to do with the purposiveness of intentional activity, then one may also wonder why we should cali this type of causality 'teleology' at ali. Should we not, instead, accept that teleolo gy has been reduced to something else, that is, to a type of causality that has nothing to do with purposiveness and goal-directedness as we know it from the realm of human agency? These questions lead us back to the originai concern of Illetterati and Michelini's volume, the question of whether or not we can retain a conception of naturai teleology in the light of current science. The variety of answers proposed hint at the extent of the problem that this question raises: the problem of giving an adequate account of the apparent purposiveness and goal-directedness of living beings as something 'between nature and mind'. In the end, we may stili wonder whether there really is a stable position in between a naturalistic réduction of tele ology, on the one hand, and an account of purposiveness that makes reference to intentionality on the other. While the hook does not give a unified answer to this question, the différent perspectives that it brings together provide a diverse and thereby ali the more stimulating insight into current debates about teleology. It will be of value to those interested in accounts of purposiveness in the history of philosophy and the philosophy of biology alike. Angela Breitenbach</page></plain_text>
