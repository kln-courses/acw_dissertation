<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 360 Book Reviews view of  Buddhism’s emergence and success in India. This has had wide-ranging consequences as, for example, in the treatment given to early Buddhist visual material. The study of  this imagery has overly emphasized the role of  narrative, somewhat unconsciously following a bias in the study of  Western art. DeCaroli’s work is a fine step away from this focus and should generate, I hope, many more such steps by him as well as others in the field. The bias for the Buddha’s narrative is a pernicious one, allowing a focus on doctrine and a celebration of  ancient India without much mention of  those who made the monuments and those who used them. DeCaroli effectively argues for a much more complicated, contentious atmosphere, in which Buddhism sometimes entered into an uneasy partnership with local but nonetheless powerful spirit- deities. When he discusses why he chooses to call them spirit-deities rather than yakshas or other frequently used names for such beings, he makes a very good argument. The large-scaled figures, such as the spirit-deities on the important early stupa railing from Bharhut, as DeCaroli notes, deserve much more careful con- sideration, and I think that this study offers highly interesting ways to think about the significance of  their presence. His view that the Buddha in some ways usurps the central place first held by these spirit-beings should lead, I think, to an important revision of  how we think about these early Buddhist monuments and the practices that occurred at them. Fuller consideration should also create some useful thought on various other questions, such as the now much-debated topic of  aniconism: Is there or is there not a specific avoidance of  representing the Buddha in anthropomorphic form? DeCaroli’s discussions will no doubt prompt reexamination of  this question and of  why earlier studies have failed to deal seriously with these deities, which are sometimes depicted as large-sized figures and other times as part of  more “narra- tive” reliefs. While such neglect would seem patently problematic, given that these are the largest figures depicted on such monuments during a period when anthro- pomorphic images of  the Buddha do not appear, many scholars have been overly attentive to the narrative imagery with little acknowledgment of  even the appear- ance of  these spirit-deities. What is particularly useful about DeCaroli’s study is how it changes the perspective with which one looks at these early monuments, so that even inquiries that continue to focus on narratives of  the Buddha might profit from the consideration of  how they are in dialogue with subjects of  the spirit-deities. The author has indeed begun an important discussion about the formation of  Buddhism in India.

Ann Arbor: University of  Michigan Press, 2004. Pp. 248, 6 illustrations. $55.00. A virgin looms over Munich, Germany, atop a pillar erected by Elector Maximilian I at the zenith of  his state building in 1638. The statue is still there </page> <page sequence="2"> History of Religions 361 today, in Munich’s central square next to the city hall, but, as Ulrike Strasser argues in this fascinating and complex study, the role virgins played in the forma- tion of  the Bavarian state has largely been overlooked. Emphasizing and con- trolling women’s sexuality was one important way that the state reaffirmed its spiritual purity and social health. By embracing cloistered virgins, sanctioning unmarried women who had sex, and making marriage the prerogative of  the prop- ertied classes, Bavaria’s government demonstrated the same preoccupation with women’s bodies and sexual behavior that feminist historians (extending, as Strasser helpfully points out, an argument developed by Friedrich Engels) have taught us to recognize as a significant feature of  many different governing systems. In creating a state, Bavaria was unintentionally aided by the sixteenth-century Catholic Church, which redefined the act of  marriage and the boundaries of  convent life as part of  its program to reform Catholicism in the wake of  the Protestant Reformation. Economics, politics, and religion, in other words, twined together to produce what became the modern state. As the wording of  this last point suggests, Weberian theories of  state formation are crucial to this study. But Strasser argues that her story of  virginity in Munich corrects not only Weber (and his focus on Protestantism and internalized religious faith) but also the newer confessionaliza- tion thesis (which argues that Protestants and Catholic alike focused on centralizing their institutions and regulating the beliefs of  their adherents). By contrast, Strasser reveals that states were propelled into existence by women no less than by bureau- crats, by sexuality no less than by rationalization, and by Catholicism no less than by Protestantism. She writes, “The case of  Bavaria suggests that the triumph of modern statehood is better understood not in terms of  the state’s ability to over- come religion but rather of  its ability to absorb desirable religious influences and to push the undesirable ones into a newly created sphere of  individual morality and privacy. In a political sleight of  hand, the state in effect coded parts of  religion as in the general public interest and therefore essentially ‘of  the state,’ thus making invisible religion’s precise contribution to the formation of  its own power” (7). Insofar as Weber’s argument has traditionally been taken to support the tale of progressive rationalization and the formative power of  Protestantism to create a “profoundly rational and self-disciplining . . . modern state subject” (6), Strasser is right to emphasize that her study gives us a new way to understand how and why the state emerged. It is, however, a testimony to the subtlety of  her argument that it could serve just as well to take us back to Weber, to appreciate anew the explanatory potential of  his category of  rationalization and the claims of  elective affinity (rather than simple causality) that he made when assessing the relation- ship between religion and economics. Like Weber, whose famous thesis about the Protestant ethic builds on a paradox (that a firm belief  in predestination encouraged economically profitable behavior), Strasser focuses on an apparent contradiction: the Catholic Church’s attempts to monopolize marriage and virginity served the state, which used the church’s theology and doctrine to consolidate its own control over marriage—defined for the state’s purposes not as a sacrament and a right but as a socioeconomic partner- ship and class privilege. When the church consolidated its institutional power in the twelfth century (during the so-called Gregorian Reform), it defined the sacra- ment of  marriage in a way that sought to minimize familial involvement over a </page> <page sequence="3"> 362 Book Reviews relationship that was, in a feudal system, essentially an exchange of  property. In the attempt to wrest power away from families, the church, by contrast, empha- sized that marriage was an agreement between two people and even made the priest superfluous by declaring that the sacrament was enacted when the participants recited their promises to one another, with or without a witness. The unintended effect in this case was a blurry boundary between courtship and marriage— between the promise to marry and the marital vows—and, as Strasser explains in a characteristically perceptive analysis, this meant that, at least so far as secular courts were concerned, sexual activity more often counted as evidence of  high stakes rather than dishonor (32, 93). In 1563, however, the church added a pub- licity requirement. People now were required to register their upcoming marriage with the parish priest so that he could proclaim it weeks before the event, and the marriage itself  was invalid without the presence of  a priest. All this was intended to affirm the sacramental nature of  marriage, but what it created was a newly stark “distinction between non-marital and marital” and thus between forbidden and sanctioned sex (112). As the newly centralized Bavarian state imposed new stric- tures on who could marry—including, most consequentially, the prohibition against marriage between people who had no money or property—church teachings and secular laws conspired to impose a new model of  female respectability. Profligacy (which, in a telling development, was used to refer to both sexual and economic licentiousness) was sternly condemned as a particularly reprehensible vice. Nuns were similarly sexualized by the Catholic Church in the sixteenth century. In the medieval church, celibacy arguably created a third gender, but when the church combated the Protestant critique of  celibacy by mandating strict enclosure for all religious women, they shifted the focus from valorizing to protecting nuns’ virginity. Thus, Strasser argues that nuns, wives, and virgins all experienced a “Protestant Reformation” in the sense that they all lived in a world shaped by the assumption that sex was the norm and that it had to be strictly regulated: “The Protestant Reformers reset the terms in which virginity and celibacy were con- ceptualized by insisting on a natural and irrepressible sex drive” (13). Safely behind walls that functioned, as Jutta Sperling has said, like an additional hymen, nuns in Munich were perfectly positioned to guarantee the purity of  the state. These virgin bodies thereby had a tangible, physical, and public presence—a presence as important to the state as the regulated and clearly defined identities and sexual behavior of  prostitutes, unmarried women, and wives. In this story about state building, Strasser gives life and voice to all the women whose legal pleas and religious ambitions provide her with the sources she uses so skillfully to demonstrate how and why both the state and the church shaped themselves by defining and controlling women. Clearly it was not just women as agents of  reproduction, or even women as religiously powerful symbols, but also women as religious actors (especially in the complicated case of  the English Ladies, a quasi-religious order of  teachers, whose stories Strasser tells in chap. 5) who compelled institutional attention. Thus, the Bavarian case conclusively dem- onstrates that nuns could serve state interests just as well as families did and that we should not imagine the state building itself  up by tearing religion down. What is not so clear, however, is that this is best understood as a repudiation of Weber’s argument about rationalization and modern state formation. As Strasser </page> <page sequence="4"> History of Religions 363 says, creating states requires creating state subjects. Weber’s modern subject, she argues, was male, rational, and formed above all by a Protestant assumption that religion is subjective and psychological: “In other words, the subjectivity of the state subject is the primary portal through which religion enters the otherwise markedly secularized scene of  state power” (6). What she, by contrast, shows is the creation of  a modern subject who was female—virginal, married, or trans- gressive—whose sexual state was used to “fashion myths of  political purity . . . and to elaborate ideas about good governance” (5). But Weber did not conclude that there was necessarily an inverse correlation between rationalism and religion, and in studying Protestantism he focused on theology and an internalized faith (rather than rituals, for example) because his question was whether there was any connection between religious ideas and eco- nomic behavior. In fact, the rationalism Weber identifies was closely akin to the sort of  self-formation Strasser describes as she shows how people sought to control sexuality—delineating, defining, and clarifying, not in order to maximize profit, but with an insistent focus on the connection between behavior and outcome. What she beautifully clarifies is that the subject who emerged was also mystified and spiritualized: in this sense, gender and sexuality stand in uneasy relationship to calculations of  cause and effect. But Weber was no rational-choice theorist. He thought that there were unexpected and unintended affinities between theology and behavior and that the connections that could be identified were a product of the question one asked. In a Weberian fashion, Strasser has asked a wonderful question: What was the connection between the new regulations of  women’s sexuality and the political changes in seventeenth-century Bavaria? And she has sketched a convincing answer: virginity was politically powerful because it was religiously significant, and the Catholic spiritual worldview (rather than just its institutional apparatus and regulatory procedures) contributed to the rise of  a modern state.
