<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Euro-Islamic Roots of Secularity: A Difficult Equation Armando Salvatore Institute of Social Science Humboldt University This article probes into the issue of secularity as a main node of the historic construc tion of modem power and the modem state in Europe. It builds an interpretative arch ranging from the Spanish Reconquista, stretching through the European Wars of Religion and the resistance to the "Turkish Threat" of the encroaching Ottoman armies, and reach ing into the contemporary predicament of the presence of a growing population of Muslim background in the key states of Western Europe, notably those involved in the Reconquista, the resistance to the "Turkish Threat", and in the Wars of Religion. The analysis matches the interpretation of these historical traumata with philosophical and sociological reflections, from Spinoza and Vico to Asad and Casanova. The conclusions point to the inherent ambivalence and arbitrary character of the modem secular distinction between religion and politics. They suggest that the philosophical utopia of secularity is still an open issue for the European states and that the growing presence of Islam in Europe helps give evidence of the limits of the secular arrangements reigning in the continent thus far. The Two Segments of the Historic Euro-Islamic Equation In the novel Shadows of the Pomegranate Tree (1993 [1991]), the writer and film-maker Tariq Ali paints a vivid picture of the ideological siege of the politically defeated Muslims of al-Andalus after the military collapse of its last stronghold, the Sultanate of Gharnata (Grenada). The main plot focuses on the prolonged agony of the noble clan of al-Hudayl before its final annihilation. The spotlight is also focused on two characters among the encroaching Christians, a religious personality and a political leader, who lead their camp to the final show-down that precipitated the catastrophe of the Andalusi way of life, portrayed by Ali as highly civilized but polit ically fragile. Ximenes de Cisneros is the Franciscan monk who took up the post of Archbishop of Grenada, ordered a bonfire of all treasures of the Arab-Islamic heritage located in the city and, in the face of opposi tion from the Dominicans, initiated a policy of forced conversions aided by the newly introduced Inquisition. Cisneros's close ally is the holder of the Castilian crown and the effective sovereign of the unified Spanish king dom, the iron lady Queen Isabella. In the chess set of Yazid, the youngest member of the al-Hudayl clan, she impersonates the Black Queen "whose eyes shone with evil, in brutal contrast with the miniature Madonna hang ing around her neck" and whose "lips were painted the color of blood" A.J.S.S. 33:3 (412-437) also available online © 2005 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden see www.brill.nl</page><page sequence="2">The Euro-Islamic Roots of Secutan f: A Difficult Equation *413 (Ali, 1993:7). In this novel, religious fanaticism is clearly located on the Christian side, while more than one character within and around the al Hudayl clan displays a healthy dose of scepticism — an indispensable anti dote to excesses of zeal in the implementation of religious law. Leaving aside the artistic dimension of the novel, the message of the acclaimed, progressive Muslim author is, firstly, a reiteration of the well known motif of the intellectual climate of tolerance and exchange among the al-Andalus, albeit coupled with political weakness and short-sighted fac tionalism. Thanks to the author's intellectual honesty in attempting to sit uate the conflict in its proper historical context, which has a much wider significance than the tragic collapse of a highly civilized way of life, one detects an additional and more subtle motif that emerges from the dia logue among some of the characters. This additional motif consists of a deeper examination of the fact that the tolerance of the Muslims of al Andalus was, in the final analysis, a weakness, while the fanaticism of the partnership between the Spanish crown and the Catholic cross was a fac tor of strength. This self-criticism unfolds at the precise moment of the conventional historic transition to modernity in Europe, which coincides not only with Columbus's discovery of America, but also with the build ing of a unified Spanish state in the wake of the triumphant Reconquista. The message of the novel demonstrates how the zealous state-build ing of the Spanish crown was intrinsically married to religious intransi gence. With the latter, the homogenizing fury unleashed, not only against Islam and Judaism as religions but also against the Arabic language and the written Arabic-Islamic heritage, becomes a political imperative that justifies the genocide. It appears that the Christian-Spanish encroachers lucidly perceived that the obliteration of treasures of knowledge from addi tional areas such as medicine and agriculture was a necessary sacrifice for the superior goal of the obliteration of a culture whose survival would have threatened the state-building imperative of religious and cultural homoge nization. Thus, the religious fanaticism of Cisneros appears cruel and crim inal, but also perfectly rational, while Islamic culturedness and tolerance proved old-fashioned and unmodern. As the story unfolds, fanaticism appears in the final analysis as a necessary instrument of ethnic cleansing, confiscation of property and power centralization in the course of a heightened state building and proto-colonial momentum. The sixteen-year-old captain who raids the village and estate of al-Hudayl and massacres every single inhab itant in the final scene of the novel is no less than Hernán Cortés. His early training for the later extermination of the Indios of America con sisted of performing genocidal raids against the powerless Muslims in south ern Spain after the fall of Granada. The main topic of this paper is secularity. Remembering the tragic outcome of the Reconquista through the fictionally diagnostic judgment of a contemporary Muslim intellectual helps us to approach one main historical</page><page sequence="3">414 • Armando Sakatore and conceptual node that affects the place of "religion" and "secularity" in the Euro-Islamic equation. Reaching its climax in the events of the late fifteenth century — which saw the collapse of Muslim rule, the genocidal persecution of the Muslim population, the unification of the Spanish crown and the beginning of colonial exploitation of the Americas — this story provides us with one of the two main segments of the equation. The other main segment is a result of the intra-Christian Wars of Religion that would hold sway in Western and Central Europe soon thereafter, in tandem with the beginnings of colonial enterprises and the deepening of state-building processes. The first segment of the equation, which is also its necessary condition, suggests that a specific form of religious fanaticism was func tional to the mobilization of a new modern type of state-centred violence, to which earlier forms of tolerance, co-existence, pluralism and cultural exchange were sheer obstacles. The second segment of the equation, or its sufficient condition, embraces the sectarianism of the various ramifications — moderate and radical — of the Protestant Reformation and the ensu ing Wars of Religion in Europe up to the Peace of Westphalia (1648). This treaty fortified and sanctioned the necessity of a centralization of power in the hands of rulers who acquired tight control over religious sen timents and activism (cuius regio eius religió). The task of the cultural and even linguistic homogenization (with its latent need for ethnic cleansing and cultural genocide as ultima ratio) of what were emerging as the kernels of nation-states was further legitimized. While it managed to successfully shield itself against the Protestant Reformation thanks to, among other reasons, the religio-cultural-linguistic compactness recently acquired through the militant impetus of the last phase of the Reconquista, ethnically-cleansed Christian Spain became involved in the so-called Wars of Religion mainly through a dynastic link to the imperial crown of Charles V. In this way, Spain constituted the first suc cessful example of the construction of a culturally, linguistically and reli giously homogeneous nation-state in Europe. This homogeneity was the pre-condition for the next stage of neutralization of divisive religious sen timents and militancy, and for the subsequent emergence of secularity as a new form of governance within the emerging, modern political forma tions. Spain's experience of fierce battles, and a cruel civil war, waged between obscurantist clericalism and radical anti-clericalism well into the twentieth century does not invalidate the equation, but points to the inde terminacy on which the equation rests. Is "religion" structurally on the los ing side in the construction of modern power? If not, why do we assume that secularity is quintessentially modern? Does it become essential to the construction of the modern European state due to its power to erase, mar ginalize and privatize religion or, instead, its capacity to shape "religion" in a particularly effective way? If we merely examine the equation not in terms of a static binary</page><page sequence="4">The Euro-Islamic Roots of Secularity: A Difficult Equation *415 logic that tells us that "religion" — as based on potentially fanatical reli gious sentiment and activism — and "secularity" — as the institutional and cultural set of rules that contains religion within secure limits (within a "religious field") — are logically antithetical, the indeterminacy dissolves into a complex set of variables. The outcome of the process of secular ization, as inscribed in the political and constitutional frameworks of most Western and Central European nation-states (in the area previously identified, up to the Reformation, as Latin Christian, Catholic Europe), tells us that they are, indeed, opposites. We cannot, however, analyse the process of their genesis by anachronistically starting from the results, which include the production of these two concepts as opposites, and then projecting the two notions back onto some purported "origin" of the modern culture of secularity. We need a more plastic genealogical method. That a pure analysis of static concepts is not of great help is demon strated by identifying the difficulties associated with equating "secularity" with "tolerance" or with a simple attitude of cultural immunization against religious excess, fanaticism and sectarianism. The latter features of toler ance are certainly abundant in Islamic history and particularly well rep resented in the intellectual history of al-Andalus. We need to link the historic Euro-Islamic equation to recent debates on the understanding of "secularity" as a typically European political-institutional and discursive intellectual construct. Is it correct to define the secularity of the modern state as "European" in spite of the diversity of institutional regulations of the religious field in the various European countries, and notwithstanding the existence — or even popularity — of what everyday discourse terms secular cultures at large in the non-Western and, including or especially, the Islamic, social and cultural worlds? I prefer to use the term "secularity" in connection with, but also as distinct from, an ideological and normative school ("secularism"), and from the theoretical perspective of a necessary social process of differentiation of a religious sphere, linked to modernization ("secularization"). While being at the root of both secularism and secularization, secularity manifests itself most directly in concrete modes of governance and in the way religion is reconstructed as experience and belief to be confined to the private sphere of life (see Asad, 2003). This is a sphere whose intangibility is protected by the state under the condition that its counterpart, the public sphere, is safeguarded as the dominion of the symbols of allegiance to the state against the penetration of religious sentiments and "beliefs". At the same time, we should be aware that the entire semantic area circumscribing the "secu lar" is, not surprisingly, much older that the range of processes, discourses and institutions associated with modern secularity. The notion of saeculum had some importance in medieval theological discourses and worldviews within Latin Christendom. It was intended, first of all, as the sphere of religious life external to the regula, the monastic</page><page sequence="5">416* Armando Sahatore rule and, therefore, as the locus of the care of the souls of the lay peo ple. Once the modern notion of individual property started to gain ground, this idea of passage from a self-enclosed religious life building the kernel of a holistic conception of humanity in the service of God, to an expanded domain of common life, was transposed into the market realm. Secularization ended up designating the release of ecclesiastical property into private hands and market circulation (Asad, 2003:192). On the other hand, the notion of secularity that crystallizes after the Enlightenment and, in particular, within anthropological and sociological theory — in a singular symbiosis with the transformations of theological discourse — can no longer be under stood as the outcome of further shifts and transpositions of its medieval meaning. As a result of an epistemic rupture, the other end of the spec trum — that is, the religious life — broke free from its link to the saecu lum and ended up signifying "a variety of overlapping social usages rooted in changing and heterogeneous forms of life". Social science discourse, however, squeezed these "into a single immutable essence" designated "the object of a universal human experience called 'religious'" [ibid.: 31). Asad indicts Durkheim for establishing, on the basis of this insulation of "reli gion", a transhistorical opposition between sacred and profane; hence, between the "religious" and the "secular". The Modern Emergence of "Religion" This modern redefinition undoubtedly re-actualizes, under deeply trans formed sociopolitical conditions, a polarity that was present in ancient "pagan" cultures through the process of a crystallization of all main reli gious, social and political institutions. In the Middle Ages, however, this polarity was reframed within the idea of a concert between "spiritual" and "temporal" powers. In agreement with earlier works by Asad, but some what in contrast with his most recent book explicitly dedicated to secu larity, I deem it important to consider how the institutional kernel of secularity is itself the outcome of a complex metamorphosis of the idea of religion that goes back to the "Axial Renaissance" of the late Middle Ages. In this era, a series of thinkers linked to new movements (such as the men dicant orders) and institutions (such as universities) revived and redefined the main tenets of the "Axial Age" (Eisenstadt, 1986). Focusing for a moment on the Axial Renaissance of the late Middle Ages can also ren der more comprehensible the traumatic and genocidal first segment of the modern Euro-Islamic equation, which is iconically illustrated by the fate of the Banu Hudayl. The conflict between the pope and the emperor during the Axial Renaissance prompted attempts to resystematize the relationship between spiritual and temporal authorities that had been first formulated by Pope</page><page sequence="6">The Euro-Islamic Roots of Secularity: A Difficult Equation «417 Gelasius I in the late fifth century (see Szakolczai, 2001:357). Aquinas's anthropology, which operated on the idea of the free and mature Christian subject, represented a major milestone in the intellectual development of a political theology for the new era. This Christian subject is a complex creature and quite distinct from the simpler Aristotelian zoon politikon ("polit ical animal"), a free agemt who is capable of inhabiting a natural com munity that nourishes his virtues. Unlike the Aristotelian approach, whereby the concept of individual freedom is the one with the virtues, Aquinas asso ciates freedom with the idea of multitudo. Human partnership is the result of free and creative co-operation among the multitudes. It must be a part nership sustained by sharing in the love of God and by implementing direc tionality, the telos of a human life of mutual help geared towards the attainment of eternal beatitude. Love of God is the warrant of the human bond of affection (Voegelin, 1997:219). Having reconstructed the homo Christianus in this way, the Dominican monk claims that this type of man is indeed an animal politicum, but with the important qualification that the socio-anthropological roots of politics are defined in a quite un-Aristotelian way. As illustrated by Voegelin, the degree of innovation in Aquinas's view cannot be overestimated: Under the hands of Thomas [Aquinas] the term political begins to assume its modem meaning; the Gelasian dichotomy of spiritual and temporal pow ers began to be replaced by the modem dichotomy between religion and politics. With Thomas, the political sphere, in the modern sense, was still completely oriented towards the spiritual, but the beginning of the momen tous evolution that led, through the Lockean privatization of religion and the assignment of a public monopoly to politics, to the totalitarian integra tion of an intramundane spirituality into the public sphere of politics can be discerned {ibid.: 220). The internal impetus, but also the contradictions of the Axial Renaissance, are best revealed through its vanguards — the new monastic and popu lar movements whose élan and power climaxed with the activities of the new mendicant orders that were formed in the early nineteenth century. The Dominicans and the Franciscans drew their force from the emerging secular worlds of the towns and from the thriving urban economies, whereby saeculum was still mainly intended in its above-explained medieval meaning and was not yet married to the power machinery of the modern state. Keeping these historic precedents in mind, we need to dismantle and redefine the loaded notion of secularity by avoiding a pre-emptive cultur alization of its meaning and by paying all due attention to the power rela tions it entails between state authorities and religious groups, and also to the metamorphosed notion of power that it incorporates. The hypothesis pursued here is that secularity manifests itself in concrete power relations</page><page sequence="7">418* Armando Sahatore and modes of governance, and in the way religion is reconstructed as expe rience and belief to be confined to the private sphere of life. The impli cations of secularity go beyond this mere reduction and confinement of religion to a "sphere" of individual or, at most, "community" life. "Religion" itself, as redefined through its privatization, becomes a new source of empowerment to be shaped and channelled by the state. The Protestant Reformation triggered by the Augustinian monk Martin Luther in the six teenth century lent a new traumatic quality to the dialectics of challenge and reform, and radicalized the entwining of "religion" and "politics" that had first gained visibility in several innovative theoretical systematizations by Dominican and Franciscan scholars during the Axial Renaissance. In the course of this traumatic early modern European experience, "religion" started to be considered as legitimate in the public sphere if and only if it helped to overcome discord and moralize public life while fitting into the general framework of political and moral values of its society, or simply by coinciding with the religious affiliation of the ruler [cuius regio eius religio). The state's domestication of religion gradually became a cement of national unity and, hence, a factor in the political transformation in Europe. In many ways, modern religion is virtually a "political religion" by default, either in the hands of radical sectarians or of the state that restores the order and guarantees the pact of subjection in exchange for the preserva tion of the security of the subjects (soon citizens) and the promotion of their prosperity. The quasi-sanctification of the political fragmentation sanctioned by the cuius and the Peace of Westphalia of 1648, and the increasingly unchal lenged recognition of the sovereignty of independent states went hand in hand with the consecration of a principled reconstruction of mechanisms of power resting on a fundamental redefinition of religion. An increasingly consequential and self-conscious notion of secularity provided the required principle and became a factor of ideological homogeneity in Europe, along side its drifting political fragmentation and territorial and colonial competition. The decisive process of the refinement of the notion of secularity goes back to further ruptures in the political and intellectual history of some parts of Europe in the aftermath of the Peace of Westphalia, during the period that Jonathan Israel (2001) defined as "the radical Enlightenment" (1650-1750). This is not surprising since this is the buffer period between the Wars of Religion and the golden era of the European nation-states, the "mature" Enlightenment, and a full-blown colonial modernity. Since then, a family of conceptions of secularity in the various nation-states has provided discrete, locally adapted approximations to the institutional prin ciple of state neutrality towards religion, which should be regarded as the kernel of secularity at both an institutional and an ideological level. The case of the Netherlands is particularly instructive, since it provides a pro totype of the attempt to transform the sectarian divisiveness unleashed by</page><page sequence="8">The Euro-Islamic Roots of Secularity: A Difficult Equation «419 the Protestant Reformation into an orderly principle of national cohesion of a republican type. Moreover, the emerging Dutch religio-political prob lématique can be seen as spanning the border between the liberal English and Scottish, later British, models, on the one hand; and the continental republican ones, on the other. More generally, the Dutch model emerged out of ongoing conflicts that were clearly specific to North-Western Europe. Ethical Spinozism provided the most elegant and theoretically cogent justification of this secular kernel of republicanism found in the Netherlands during the century of the radical Enlightenment. The importance of the philosophy of Benedict (Baruch) de Spinoza for several vanguards of the European Enlightenment and for the modern self-understanding of Europe right up to the present day cannot be overestimated. It is mostly neglected, however, that his thought was heir to the vibrant cultural world of al Andalus. As pointed out by Voegelin, with him, the son of a Sephardi Jewish family that had resettled in Amsterdam due to the persecution of the Catholics, "the Mediterranean irrupts again into Western thought" (Voegelin, 1999:126). He pieced together distinct motives, some of which echo the most daring visions of Islamic philosophy and rationalist specu lative theology, those most strenuously combated by the Muslim legists. His family legacy reflects the tragedy of the persecution and expulsion of Muslims and Jews in the early days of the nationalization and Christianization of Spain reflected on by Tariq Ali in the fictional family saga mentioned at the beginning, and in which we could see the roots of modern European Judeophobia and Islamophobia. Spinoza's reflections on religion, power and the state combine origi nally this tragic legacy (the first segment of the Euro-Islamic equation) with the experience of the bloody sectarianism unleashed by the Protestant Reformation, and of the destruction of the ensuing Wars of Religion (the second segment of the equation). Moreover, his system of thought is deeply indebted to Jewish mysticism and Islamic philosophy, and to the heritage of al-Farabi, Ibn Sina and, especially, the Andalusian Ibn-Rushd and Maimonides; however, Spinoza's will to remain detached from any specific cultural and religious tradition means that these roots go unacknowledged in his work. For Spinoza, a sharp critic of priestly power and superstition, the only criteria for judging the truth of religions is practical, that is, through the assessment of their capacity to institute justice and caritas. These clearly do not exist — and here he agrees with Hobbes — in the state of nature (Preus, 1989:90-91). Religion is constituted pragmatically for its appeal to the imagination of the common man and for its capacity to instill in him the dispositions that support the social link between ego and alter. He sees the kernel of thus conceived religion in practical action rooted in good dis positions and, therefore, as separated, in principle, from the external realms of politics and law: "Inasmuch as [religion] consists not so much in outward</page><page sequence="9">420 • Armando Salvatore actions as in simplicity and truth of character, it stands outside the realm of law and public authority". For him, the key to this "true religion" is "faithful and brotherly admonition, sound education, and, above all, free use of the individual judgment" (Spinoza, 1951 [1670]: 118). Spinoza saw religion as historically based in the prophetic discourse that attempts to bring the ideas of justice and caritas into harmony with the practical needs of the common people, therefore, instituting the very notion of the common good. This is a secular approach in that the exhor tative discourse of faith is conceived as a conversation among human agents and does not need to be located, theologically, in God. God matters here solely as the initiator of human power, as the source of divine sparks pre sent in individual beings who constitute a heterogeneous multitude — nei ther depending on priestly authority. This Spinozian vision was not simply the product of a sharply critical mind, but was part of the efforts to come to terms with the threat of chaos represented by the religious sectarianism that did not seem to be completely subdued after the Peace of Westphalia and the promulgation, at the highest level, of the cuius regio dus religion, which had become an attractive principle of order after the initial erup tion of the Reformation. These dilemmas featured prominendy in public debate and in the col lective imagination in the early eighteenth century, as witnessed by an interesting and popular piece of fiction staging typically Spinozian motifs. The work in question is the novel, Description of the Mighty Kingdom of Krinke Kesmes, which was published in the Netherlands in 1708 (Smeeks, 1976 [1708]). Its author, Hendrik Smeeks, delivered nothing less than a Utopian story in the style of Robinson Crusoe, similarly including a message on the delicacy of the construction and maintenance of the social bond but explic itly related to the issue of the divisiveness of religion and, hence, to the need for secularity. It constructs an ingenious plot around the idea of the threat that unbridled religion, that is, religious sectarianism, poses to pub lic order and to the very possibility of a peaceful and civil society. Like Robinson Crusoe, it is the story of the aftermath of a shipwreck. A Dutch-Spanish merchant, with a mixed Protestant and Catholic back ground, is shipwrecked in the then legendary land of Australis, in the South Sea. Astonishingly, the indigenous population knows all of the main lan guages and religions of Eurasia. This was made possible by a previous shipwreck, which occurred some centuries earlier when a Persian ship head ing to Mecca and carrying Muslim pilgrims along with their Christian and Jewish slaves sank. The wise king of Krinke Kesmes had ordered the sal vage and classification of all the precious texts in Hebrew, Arabic, Latin and Greek, which were found in the foundered vessel. Small teams among the kingdom's inhabitants had then delved into the theological and philo sophical tenets of the various religious doctrines included in the texts.</page><page sequence="10">The Euro-Islamic Roots of Secularity: A Difficult Equation • 421 The next move was a truly sociopolitical experiment. The king ordered the construction of a large cathedral with several pulpits for the various "reconstructed" religious sects. The goal was to ascertain through public discourse and open dialogue which group was closer to religious truth. The outcome proved the opposite of what was expected: there was no end to the mutual attacks among the religious representatives who denounced one another as false and heretical. An acute threat to public order became apparent. The wise king had to draw the obvious conclusion, with wisdom here implying a readiness to take an uncompromising, sovereign decision to ban all religious disputes from the public sphere, and to grant religious freedom to all. The motif that emerges from the story is one of the failed attempt at instituting a neutral public cult as desired by Spinoza while keeping and even strengthening the principle that the basic value for the republic is public order, the sine qua non of res publica. This outcome, however, is not purely celebratory in the novel. The emerging secular principle pre vents conflict but suffocates dialogue, and makes diversity invisible. Any religious identity has to be made private enough so as not to diminish public loyalty to the state, which is essential to the preservation of the state's authority and the rights of individual citizens. This is conducive to a monological political culture. The message is that "religion derives from the political regime and not the political regime from religion" (quoted in Israel 2001:321). Outward religion has to comply with political considera tions. Inward religion cannot go public, however, it cannot be obviously banned as the subject is sovereign in the inner forum. This motif has become crucial to modern and contemporary notions of secularity. Secularity rests, therefore, on a combined idea of inwardness, subjectivity, sovereignty, agency, and responsibility. As remarked by Talal Asad: At least as far back as John Locke, 'person' was theorized as a forensic term that called for the integration of a single subject with a continuous con sciousness in a single body. The development of property law in a nascent capitalism was important to this conception. But equally important was the way attributing an essence to him helped the human subject to become an object of social discipline. (Asad 2003:74) Even more importantly, this conception facilitated a split between legality and morality; these were then reconnected in new ways through a dialec tic among powers that are both external and internal to the person. This dynamic is conjured up by the institutional dependence of subjective agency on the tutelage of Leviathan, who warrants security but also the enforce ment of agreements. The bridling of religion recalls the essentially abso lutist kernel of the modern state, even if it takes a republican or a liberal shape. Surveillance and, increasingly, biopolitics — whose roots we can</page><page sequence="11">422 • Armando Sahiatore detect in the story of Krinke Kesmes — are necessary to the making of those accountable persons who internalize the moral force of religion. Religious neutrality is not just a rational postulate, it has to rely on sophis ticated discursive and institutional machinery guaranteeing and delimiting religious freedom. The early eighteenth-entury Dutch novel shows the extent to which the banning of religious confessions from the public sphere began to be considered as an eminently rational solution to an acute problem of pub lic order. It is perhaps no coincidence that this achievement was integral to colonial narratives of expansion of the horizons of knowledge and con trol that were intimately tied to the crystallization of the powers of mod ern nation-states and their agents. What links this second segment of the Euro-Islamic equation to the first is that the postulate of outward con formism and religious homogenization first implemented by the Spanish Inquisition in an exemplary fashion became increasingly independent from the help of the church. Ever more refined forms of Leviathan's power became the condition for a newly formulated inner freedom. One cannot, however, appreciate the Spinozian approach to religion, power, and what Spinoza himself defined in classical terms as "civil soci ety" (societas civilis), without reassessing his key concepts and how they could be potentially employed for a modern reconstruction of secularity that differs from the modalities through which secularity finds institutional expres sion in contemporary post-Christian European societies. One could spec ulate that an alternative reconstruction of this kind would have the potential to alter the postulates of cultural homogeneity and the basically monolog ical character of political cultures in the European state, and help propose solutions to the contemporary Euro-Islamic equation. For Spinoza, God is the supreme good but is mainly, though not completely, identified with nature and deprived of any anthropomorphic attributes. Man can only realize his nature and pursue good in company with other men. Political society should be constructed in such a way that the pursuit of good is possible for the largest number. Spinoza recombined key elements drawn from Jewish, Christian and Islamic traditions in order to achieve a revo lutionary synthesis. In this sense, his theory is distinctive in that it is sin gularly exempt from a need for self-justification vis-à-vis Christianity. Acquiescentia is the keyword in Spinoza's recipe for good life. Interesting — and contrary not only to traditional theologies but also modern liberal anthropologies — is the fact that neither man nor God is conceived by him as a personality. The human personality is nothing other than a per manent undulation in the flux of natural necessity and divine order. Spinoza's acquiescentia cannot be properly translated into any modern European lan guage. Voegelin insists that it simply means Islam, that is, in the sense of trustful surrender to God (Voegelin, 1999:129) although it is without doubt</page><page sequence="12">The Euro-Islamic Roots of Secularity: A Difficult Equation *423 the Islam of the philosophers and some Sufis rather than the Islam of the ulamaThis vision clearly unsetdes traditional telos but strives towards its arduous, piecemeal and, therefore, potentially revolutionary reconstruction. Human beings are multitudes, as recognized by Aquinas, but not ineluctably disintegrated, as asserted by Hobbes. The needed res publica is not neces sarily a Leviathan that devours all heterogeneity. Ethnic cleansing and cul tural assimilation are not the markers of such a state. Like all other natural beings, human beings — in their multitude — exist by the power of God, so that the extent and nature of their power to act is co-extensive with the power they receive from God. For Spinoza, the terminology of "rights" is an exoteric device; an almost superstitious symbolization inadequate to capture the essence of this power. The struc ture of reality consists of powers, not of rights. Whereas by nature men are multitudes of monads individually empowered by God, the problem of commanding right and prohibiting wrong can only be raised at the moment individuals pool their powers into a common power, thereby creating rules concerning the relation between ego and alter and within wider solidarity groups. A man's life as an isolated Hobbesian power monad is not only theoretically inconceivable, since it is men who decide to pool their pow ers or not, but contradicts a life of reason, security and comfort. Therefore, Spinoza is radically innovative in seeing the common good (res publica) as the product of a conscious option for power sharing while adhering to the idea of a shared supreme good that cannot be erased if the telos is the good life of reason and acquiescientia. Sharing (a verb much abused by mod ern communitarian theories), however, is not really the right word here. Two monads do not share anything; rather, the divine sparks that animate them enter a positive or negative, creative or destructive tension. Such is the construction of the common. Correspondingly, the body politic is a variable that is entirely dependent on the fluency of the existence of human multitudes and on the ability of human powers to create a proper and creative balance among themselves (cf. Voegelin, 1999:130-32). Spinoza clearly saw that, far from realizing a new freedom, the rup tures in medieval Christian civilization had unleashed sectarian passions in the form of unredeemed wills to power. As the recipe for a balance of powers leading to collective enjoyment, his Jewish-Islamic mysticism of rea son and restraint was a radical antithesis to the sectarian furor released by the Protestant Reformation, but also to the Judephobia and Islamophobia that remain, to our day, the key markers of Europe's claims to cultural homogeneity. For all the merits of his daring and intriguing vision, his view was quite elitist. In spite of itself, it implied a privatization of God as the supreme good (ibid.: 136). The emerging state was unable to com pletely absorb the pious passions of early modernity which, although manip ulated by subsequent waves of self-appointed reformers, had real roots in</page><page sequence="13">424 • Armando Sahiatore the sensibilities of urban strata in continual upheaval. The story of Krinke Kesmes reflects these popular sensibilities and radicalism probably better than the esoteric and geometric political theory of the saint laïc Spinoza. An important implication of Spinoza's position is that he subverts older and newer conceptions of "natural law", either related or unrelated to "divine decree." He is daring and uncompromising in arguing that the image of God as legislating from his throne is an anthropomorphism based on biblical parabolic discourse and prophetic speech, and is the equivalent of the Axial claim that the moral universe is moved by a transcendent will. When the evaluation of the primal structure of the "law" that regu lates human society and nourishes civic institutions is at stake, however, Spinoza — like Vico, another, albeit later and more vehement, leading personality of the "radical Enlightenment" — is more eager than Aquinas to appreciate it as a creation of the human imagination and intentional ity, which are endorsed, as Spinoza admits, by custom or revelation (Preus, 1989:90). A further implication of this clear analysis of religion as Axial discourse is Spinoza's outright rejection of what was to become one main thrust of some influential currents within later Enlightenment thought, the idea of a "natural religion." This is an absurdity for him, because religion is instituted by human creativity, which is another way of saying that it is inscribed by God in the human mind as part of a repertoire of "common notions". Vico's position on this key issue is similar, but more nuanced, and clarifies the extent to which a reinterpretation of Axial transcendence is necessary for explaining the process of definition of the common good; also at a legal level, as in the tradition of Roman law, which managed fine without a monotheistic doctrine at the beginning and at several stages of its development. The lack of orientation in the new directionality of telos in Spinoza prompted Giambattista Vico (1668-1744) to analyse how the necessities and utilities of social life could be grasped by some form of common sense, prior to reflection, reason and even to language, and especially prior to any capacity to enter into contractual arrangements and define the corre sponding "rights" and underlying ties of trust. In the course of his search for a new telos, Vico — who unlike the saint laïc Spinoza has been por trayed as a pious Catholic by some, and as an astute radical thinker in a conformist garb by others — took a drastic new step towards the secu larization of telos. While, in Vico's opinion, the founders of human civi lization were clearly not the rare philosophers, the Axial authors of prophetic speech could not be considered as prime movers either, since discourse had to rest on some other form of knowledge. Thus, Vico concludes that the founders of human society and religion were "poets." They contributed a keen imaginative grasp of the necessities and Utilities of social life to civ ilization and the notion of a common good (Preus, 1989:92). In other words, necessities and utilities are first grasped creatively, and then pur</page><page sequence="14">The Euro-Islamic Roots of Secularity: A Difficult Equation *425 sued through a convenient degree of co-operation among humans (Vico, 1999 [1744]). In this way, Vico pursues Spinoza's project of secularizing the origins of religion in a radical way without, however, secularly sancti fying the current state powers in formation. Secularity in Contemporary Europe The innovative and sophisticated inroads made into the semantic and inter actional fields of religion and politics, and into their complex relations by thinkers of the "radical Enlightenment" such as Spinoza and Vico were later stultified into a rigid differentiation of competencies between actors in the distinct fields of "religion" and "politics". This post-Enlightenment understanding and regulation of religion is common to the part of Europe that is the heir to Latin Christendom. In spite of differences in the degrees of its institutional enforcement, and notwithstanding a variety of power relations among state authorities, established churches and non-established religious groups, this commonality is rooted in the idea of a religious field regulating religious belief and practice, along with the range of social and cultural (therefore, non-political) competencies radiating from religious com mitment. In Western and Central Europe, this type of arrangement is the lowest common denominator representing the basic secular character of the institutional landscape. This outcome simplifies and rigidifies the historic complexity of the Euro-Islamic equation. There is no doubt that the principle of the reli gious neutrality of the state was often promoted by non-conformist and non-established religious groups. While this principle, however, was the result of a movement that pushed for its acceptance and institutionaliza tion, it had to feed into the logic of concentration and sophistication of power and control that became the trademark of the nation-state in Europe. Therefore, at the basis of the principle of religious neutrality, there is an inherent tension between the tolerance of the other and the constraining of this potential openness into rigid rules enforced by the state. The twin principles of the religious neutrality of the state and of religious tolerance imposed as a rule on all citizens operate as factors of separation that pro vide, on the one hand, a potential for promoting civic life and securing public order, but might be inimical to communication and dialogue on the other. Therefore, in its variety of institutional and ideological forms, from laicite to state church, the separation between religion and politics in Europe is far from unproblematic. The predicament of Muslims in contemporary Europe is merely the last, overdramatized and twisted formulation of the Euro-Islamic equation. Fear of confrontation might inhibit dialogue, which is the lifeline of any effective public sphere and, therefore, also a condi tion for a vital public religion. The Krinke Kesmes paradigm is a very fragile arrangement for post-colonial Europe.</page><page sequence="15">426 • Armando Sahatore The basically liberal modern understanding (also and especially in its republican variant) of the separation between religion and politics tends to bracket out the function of institutional regulation in maintaining the sep aration; thus, it operates a shift from function to essence in the under standing of "religion" (Becci, 2002). The legitimate question — or suspicion — that has been raised by some sociologists of religion is whether the dis ciplining action of the state in circumscribing and delimiting a "religious field" is the real process while the establishment of the autonomy of reli gion is a mere byproduct of the process, although one embraced by those religious groups or sects that had to combat dominant — later, "estab lished" — churches (ibid.). The secularity of the European state should be understood in this light. Even more radically, Talal Asad has suggested that it is misleading to understand the emergence of secularity as the enforcement of the autonomy of religion because since early modernity, the power machinery of the rising states has been simultaneously applied "to control the increasingly mobile poor in city and countryside, to gov ern mutually hostile Christian sects within a sovereign territory, and to regulate the commercial, military, and colonizing expansion of Europe over seas" (Asad, 2003:192). To underwrite the liberal notion of "religion" that was the outcome of such larger processes of secularization as substantially, transculturally and transhistorically valid is, therefore, a plain distortion from the viewpoint of the sociology of religion. As Asad puts it: What we now retrospectively call the social, that all inclusive secular space that we distinguish conceptually from variables like 'religion', 'state', 'national economy', and so forth, and on which the latter can be constructed, reformed, and plotted, didn't exist prior to the nineteenth century. Yet it was precisely the emergence of society as an organizable secular space that made it possible for the state to oversee and facilitate an original task by redefining religion's competence: the unceasing material and moral transformation of its entire national population regardless of their diverse 'religious' allegiances (Asad, 2003:190-91). It was this liberal modern essentialization of "religion" that transformed the claim to a religious neutrality of the state agitated by radical fringes of non-established groups into secularity as a principle of power manage ment. This process released the following axioms, all of which had already been incorporated into the story of Krinke Kesmes (cf. also Bielefeldt, 2003): a) Religion is a source of divisiveness if it becomes public speech. b) Religion belongs to an inner forum. c) Religious freedom in non-public space is a matter of public order, which is a prerogative of Leviathan.</page><page sequence="16">The Euro-Islamic Roots of Secularity: A Difficult Equation *427 The largely neglected corollary to these three axioms is that: d) State neutrality is not really neutral as to what religion is/should be since, in the era of modern nation-states, religion is primarily defined by the state, either autonomously or in concert with religious institutions to which the state assigns factual or juridical privileges, thereby, contradicting the principle of neutrality. No further historical excursions are needed to note that both the diag nostic and the legally binding dimensions of this trajectory of secularity and religion in Europe does not fit well into the variety of historical expe riences of the Muslim world, nor do they cover adequately the history and vicissitudes of those parts of former Latin Christian Europe where religion was not so divisive. In those regions, religion did not produce sectarian radicalism — mainly due to the capacity of the Catholic Church to close ranks and institute state-like instruments of repression and control after the Reformation. This idea of secularity, and the concomitant concept of secularization championed by the sociology of religion up to the 1970s and after, have been challenged by José Casanova's attempts to redefine the conditions under which the "going public" (or publicization) of religion situates sec ularity in a more elastic and realistic perspective. Secularity is interpreted here as the product of a malleable transformation of religion's access to the public sphere, and not as the marker of religion's inexorable privati zation. This approach has generated a seminal debate between him and Talal Asad, who has expressed a theoretically-founded scepticism with regard to the malleability of secularity. The rest of this paper attempts to mediate conceptually in the debate between Casanova and Asad by also referring briefly to concrete public controversies involving Islam in Europe and the conditions of its "publi cization" as part of a complex trajectory of the transformation of secular ity. This trajectory appears far from exhausted and, according to both interpretations and recent developments (such as the enactment in 2004 of a law against religious symbols in public educational institutions in France), has reached a dead end where it clashes with postulates of individual rights, whose relation to secularity becomes highly ambivalent. It is at this cru cial passage of the transformation of secularity that "public Islam" enters the stage. The question arises, however, as to whether it is a legitimate challenger of European secularity within the same public sphere(s). Or is it (or the fact itself that it can be conceptualized as such) an indicator of the parochial, post-Christian character of European secularity? (see also Salvatore, 2001; Salvatore and Eickelman, 2004; Salvatore and LeVine, 2005).</page><page sequence="17">428 • Armando Sahatore The root of the idea of public Islam can be found in José Casanova's definition of "public religion" and is strictly related to a discussion of sec ularity. From his book, Public Religions in the Modern World (1994), to a more recent essay explicidy embracing Islam as the present and future candi date for a positive role as a public religion (2001), Casanova has brought fresh insights into a situation of conceptual deadlock concerning the ques tion of whether secularity allows or prevents public religion(s) to emerge and thrive. The kernel of Casanova's argument is interestingly related to the redefinition of religion that goes back to Spinoza; this redefinition is eminendy functional (though not functionalist) and, thus, one full step back from the liberal secular essentialization of religion. For Casanova, justice and doing-good-to-others (caritas in the Christian terminology of virtues) are enduring and even expanding parts of the code of most religious groups, including the established ones. Discourses of justice and human solidarity increase in importance for those communities and groups that see their mandate as a global one. These codes do not simply "invade" the arena of politics, but create an organic link between "social" and "political" fields. The late-Enlightenment dream of creating a pure field of politics governed by a discourse of reason mediated in the public sphere is eroded by the transversal penetration of a religious code that finds ramifications, new allies and new foes in broad sectors of society. By reconstructing a Toquevillean model of civil and public religion, Casanova reinterprets secularity as fair play governed by the rules of the public democratic game. Therefore, it does not impinge on forms of life, but facilitates a representation of values in the democratic process within the public sphere. Among those representing values publicly, religious groups have probably the best cultural equipment in society. This capacity legit imizes "public religion" in an institutionally secular environment. At the very least, this reinterpretation of secularity evidences tensions and cross currents within it: Is secularity more than sheer rule-setting? Or does it entail the risk of being value-indifferent or even promoting negative (for its own stated goals) values if public religion does not come to its rescue? Can forms of a-religious humanism survive without keeping a religious sub stratum of cultivation of human values? Is secularity, then, an essentially contested and contestable concept, or does it predetermine modes of gov ernance or even life forms even if it is not meant to do that? Islam in Europe as a Test of European Secularity Not surprisingly, and the "American" bias of the early nineteenth-century European observer, Tocqueville, notwithstanding, both Casanova and Asad view Europe as a major testing ground for assessing secularity. Is it a set of rules not intrinsically hostile to public religion but ideologically open</page><page sequence="18">The Euro-Islamic Roots of Secularity: A Difficult Equation • 429 and contestable (Casanova), or a sociocultural and political "formation" affecting modes of governance and forms of life so as to delegitimize "pub lic religion" (Asad)? In either case, the evaluation of secularity predeter mines the opportunities and limits of public religion and, in particular, of public Islam. In numerous writings and especially in his recent book (2003), Talal Asad has expressed serious doubts about the possibility that, through Muslim actors, movements and discourses, Islam might be allowed to pro duce and unfold Islamic approaches to the public use of argument in a secular European socio-political context due to the institutional rigidities of the European secular formations. At its best, when it is not a yardstick for blindly castigating alien political cultures and securing the cultural homog enization of the body politic, secularism (the compact political discourse based on secularity) provides a normative and constitutional approach that covers and protects secularity as a form of life and as a mode of gover nance; in a nutshell, this is Asad's argument. Secularism promotes notions of personal rights and a loyalty to the state authorities that protect these rights, but it also delimits the type and range of public arguments that can be legitimately used. José Casanova is more optimistic and bases his argument on a com parative analysis of the public role of religion in various sociopolitical set tings in North and South America, and in Western and Eastern Europe. This exploration is then incorporated into a conceptualization of the move ment of "de-privatizing" religion and, therefore, of building a "public reli gion". He sees public religion as inherently beneficial to the public sphere in a liberal-democratic context since he holds that religious traditions in general, and specifically those sprouting from the Axial-Abrahamic tree, have the potential to contribute decisively to public discussions of issues involving basic societal values, such as justice, the protection of human life and the environment, peace and solidarity with disadvantaged social strata. Indeed, religions in general, and Abrahamic religions in particular, artic ulate views of forbearance, piety, "doing good" and also friendship. These configure, more than abstract values, dispositional methods for turning those values concrete in the crucial yet elementary relation between ego and alter, on which the social bond is based. Casanova contends, however, that this potential of religions to sustain public action can only become effective if religious authorities play by the rules of the game of democratic politics. In other words, like or even more than any other social and political actors accessing the public sphere, the public representatives of a given religion must rely on persuasion via pub lic discourse. They cannot invoke traditional authority and the concomi tant repertoires of authoritative means for disciplining religious practitioners into complying with religious norms and morals. Therefore, religious val ues of justice, humanness, solidarity and peace can contribute to the com</page><page sequence="19">430 • Armando Sahatore mon good, according to Casanova, only if framed by discourses geared to persuading the general public or the majority thereof. On this side of the equation, public religion is almost a necessity. Casanova delivers nothing less than a counter-manifesto to Krinke Kesmes and its syndrome of pub licness. Yet in some ways, and his Toquevillian background notwithstand ing, one could detect a potential Spinozian, genuinely Euro-Islamic problematic behind his arguments. It remains that for Casanova, the de-privatization of religion is a defence of traditional life worlds against state and market penetration, and is legitimate to the extent it can trigger public and collective reflections on normative structures of modern societies and on their adherence to the common good, an issue that needs be increasingly defined in global and universal terms (Casanova, 2001:1048-49). Public religion can be best legit imated in Tocquevillian terms: "Tocqueville saw religious associations as 'the schools' of civil and political associationism crucial for a democratic republic" (ibid.: 1057). Can there be a "public Islam" as an instance of public religion? "The Tocquevillian argument can easily be applied to Islam" (ibid.: 1058). Even more explicitly: "The public reflexive elabora tion of Islam's normative traditions in response to modern challenges, polit ical learning experiences and global discourses has a chance to generate various forms of public civil Islam which may be conducive to democra tization" (ibid.: 1076). The Toquevillian-American framing of the core question risks dilut ing the deeper European dilemmas of religion and power. It prompts Casanova to reinterpret the positive legacy of secularization as an "objec tive" process of differentiation of societal spheres that is not, therefore, inherently tied to any particular discourse, ideology or "formation". Religion has (a particularly strong) potential for addressing the common good in secularized societies and motivating citizens into civic and political partic ipation in the name of universal values that secular doctrines too often proclaim but neglect, due to the frequent prevalence of particularistic inter ests and egoism. In a sense, Casanova regards religion as the permanent and most secure source of those universal values; hence, a secular politi cal formation without public religion might be in danger of losing touch with these underlying values. He dares to take a further step when he argues that the very resurgence or reassertion of religious traditions may be viewed as a sign of the failure of the Enlightenment to redeem its own promises. Religious traditions are now confronting the differentiated secular spheres, challenging them to face their own obscurantist, ideological, and inauthen tic claims. In many of these confrontations, it is religion which, as often as not, appears to be on the side of human enlightenment (Casanova, 1994: 233-34).</page><page sequence="20">The Euro-Islamic Roots of Secularity: A Difficult Equation • 431 Casanova is consistent in maintaining that for many followers of this or that religious tradition, a commitment to freedom, starting from the ele mentary freedom of conscience, has never been based on liberal secular values. This potential of religious traditions, however, can only be incor porated into the secular rules of the game. This process lays a premium on the capacity to mobilize and persuade without threatening the state's monopoly of the institutional instruments of coercion and consensus-build ing, and without impinging on citizens' freedom of conscience. Not sur prisingly, it is that Asad has focused on this latter point in his critique. He remarks that Casanova highlights the dependence of the legitimacy of religion "on how religion becomes public", (Asad, 2003:182) and that this is a quite narrow conceptual and operational bottleneck, since "the only option religious spokespersons have in that situation is to act as secular politicians do in liberal democracy" (ibid.: 187). How should this critique be assessed? Let us take stock and try to ascertain what is at stake in this controversy. Casanova's approach has the merit of deflating the notion of secularization by eliminating its underly ing teleological assumption about the decline of religion and its normative assumption about the privatization of religion. Yet, it preserves the idea of secularization as an institutional differentiation between religion and pol itics as the hub of his notion of public religion. The model of public reli gion is based on the normative presupposition that whoever has legitimate credentials to speak in the name of a religion or of a religious group is called to distill "values" out of the religious commitment, and build a per suasive ethical discourse that can legitimately intervene in the political process. The problem is that even the above cursory look at the European history of the formation of modern secular nation-states (and lately of European integration) shows that the separation between religion and pol itics has never been fully institutionalized as the discourse of secularization claims it to be. Whatever the claims of the official discourses of public authorities, the relation between religion and politics within European modernity has crystallized into a field of permanent and shifting tensions more than into a stable configuration of institutional and constitutional separation. The problem with this tension, and this is where Asad's critique finds fertile ground, is that the keys to its management are in the hands of the state, which uses an essentialized yet flexible enough view of religion to devise contingent solutions compatible with its imperatives of control and public order. In other words, the fairness of the so-called secular rules of the public game, as assumed by Casanova's thesis, cannot be taken for granted, not just in their application (all games might be rigged) but also in their institutional formulations. This fairness is heavily dependent on the kind of rational and enlightened understanding — nurtured, however, by</page><page sequence="21">432 • Armando Salvatore a religious sensibility — of secularity that precedes the tragedies of colo nialism, the great nationalist wars and the late-modern Judeophobia and Islamophobia more than on how secularity was reconfigured through all these events. On top of all of these dramas or rather, underneath them, one cannot ignore the resilience of a Christian substratum of European culture as the key to both Europe's fragmentation and unity. This sub stratum can be mobilized in concrete political batdes, for example, when the less-than-public, discretely disseminated call for abstention from the ref erendum on artificial insemination by the Catholic Church in Italy in June 2005 has evidenced that political religion can be even more effective in a European secular environment if it does not expose itself too publicly, thus escaping a direct, open and fair discursive confrontation with its opponents and, instead, coercing the freedom of conscience of citizens by declaring the incompatibility of certain ideas of regulation or deregulation with essen tial Christian values. The Post-Christian Imprint of European Secularity That the claim of the Christian character of European culture is politi cally alive and well despite its absence from the preamble of the draft of European constitution — which was rejected in referendums in France and Holland May and June 2005 — is also shown by the arguments advanced by various political forces against the accession of Turkey to the European Union. We also cannot disavow those arguments as deprived of historical consistency. As observed above, the new political formations that emerged through the lengthy dissolution of the medieval political ideal of a sacrum imperium, incorporating the values of the respublica Christiana and based on a concerted harmony between spiritual and temporal powers, were not the product of a sudden Enlightenment. It is symptomatic than in several legal acts and theories (up to the work of the leading legal philosopher Hugo Grotius and beyond) during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, which were formulated under the heading of the "Turkish Threat" (the label that identified the continuing military and political advances of the Ottomans into a Europe perceived as the last stronghold of Christianity; see Hôfert, 2000), the "Christian republic" was still explicitly considered the ideal polit ical entity — and corresponding identity — under threat by the Muslim armies. Tracts and treaties called for a unitas Christiana in the very epoch during which this unity had internally collapsed and given way to what Eric Voegelin has called the reciprocally schismatic formations of the mod ern national states. This means that the internal division in Europe, polit ical and religious, and the search for an overarching ideological cohesion that was largely divorced from political realities went hand in hand. The nineteenth-century idea of a "European concert" (within which</page><page sequence="22">The Euro-Islamic Roots of Secularity: A Difficult Equation • 433 the Ottoman state was dubbed, with dubious taste, the "Sick Man of Europe") was a fragile interlude before the twisting of imperial rivalries at the turn to the twentieth century. It was again, however, a Grotian idea to proclaim "infidels were neighbors and so should be the object of protec tion and love" provided they did not violate natural law as developed from within Christian European philosophical and legal theories (Asad, 2003:163). What excluded the Ottomans from the European scene until the balance of power was definitively tilted in favour of the European powers was no longer the fact that they were "infidels", but simply that they were not, or not yet considered, adequate subjects of natural law: they were simply seen as inferior on a civilizational scale centred on the emerging political cultures of North-Western Europe (ibid.: 164). In this long-term process of building secularity and inscribing it not only into state law but into international law, we see an increasing imma nentization and essentialization of religion based on transformed Christian tenets of natural law. This secularity is a far cry from the nostalgic Islamo Jewish tolerance of Tariq Ali and his Banu Hudayl. Are Tariq Ali's char acters longing for an "alternative model" of Euro-Islamic secularity? One thing cannot be denied: it would be a huge misconstruction to try to rein vent Spinoza, who is the hero of the ethicization and immanentization of the Andalusian Islamo-Jewish heritage as applied to European Christian sectarian warfare, as a critic of the modern, optimally republican state that was on its way to secularity at his time. In many ways, Spinoza was the apologist of this type of state power. Spinoza metabolized the Euro-Islamic equation into a purely European one. Indeed, the only alternative for the Banu Hudayl was not any existing counter-model, but just their dream of being rescued by the Ottoman Sultan against the genocidal encroachment performed by the sacred alliance between the cross and the crown. This help never arrived. The decline of the political and military power of the Ottoman Empire in the nineteenth century and the construction of colonial empires by the European powers secularized the European religious self-understanding into the racialized idea of the "white man's burden" in the task of civilizing non-Europe. At the same time, when the imperialistic expansion and conflicts were spiraling, Europe's dominant classes deepened their ambitions to purify national cultures from identities and allegiances considered dangerous to the homogeneity of the polity. The culmination of the rivalry between European imperial powers in the two devastating world wars and the Holocaust gave way, in the second half of the twentieth century, to a process of economic and, later, political integration that was marked, at its very outset, by a renewed search for a collective European identity that racial imperialism, Islamophobia and Judeophobia had substantiated in the era of nationalism and imperialism.</page><page sequence="23">434 • Armando Salvatore It is remarkable how slowly and reluctantly the idea of a Christian republic, the historical religious antecedent to the secular idea of Europe, came to be replaced — even on the part of some of the intellectual heroes of European modernity — by the consecration of a differentiation and sep aration of competencies between "religion" and "politics" within the emerg ing nation-states. The theoretical seeds of this differentiation, which was ordained for the sake of cultural homogeneity, were sown by none other than Aquinas. The prevalent post-Enlightenment understanding of religion, now common to the whole of Europe despite all differences, is intimately connected to these differentiation processes and, therefore, to the idea of a differentiated religious field. Here, Casanova is right in reinterpreting secularization as a differentiation of social spheres, and not as an inevitable decline and privatization of religion; therefore, since religion is neither dis appearing nor always privatized, as a process that favours a renewed pub lic role of religion. In Europe, this legally pinpointed differentiation and its accompanying institutional arrangements are, on the one hand, the least common denominator representing the basic secular character of the insti tutional landscape; however, on the other, they cannot account for the complexity and at times fluidity of the relationship between religious and political cultures that often have to be combined, albeit in disguised ways, in order to meet imperatives of identity and order. Here, Casanova's re distillation of the theorem of secularization is put to a quite severe test. As maintained by Asad, If the secularization thesis no longer carries the conviction it once did, this is because the categories of 'politics' and 'religion' turn out to implicate each other more profoundly than we thought. . . Trae, the 'proper domain of religion' is distinguished from and separated by the state in modern secular constitutions. But formal constitutions never give the whole story. On the one hand objects, sites, practices, words, representations — even the minds and bodies of worshippers — cannot be confined within the exclusive space of what secularism names 'religion.' They have their own ways of being. The historical element of what come to be conceptualized as religion have dis parate trajectories. . . . The unceasing pursuit of the new in productive effort, aesthetic experience, and claims to knowledge, as well as the unending strug gle to extend individual self-creation, undermines the stability of established boundaries (Asad, 2003:201). However sharp Asad's critique, it does not confute, but confirms, the pos sibility or even necessity of public religion as theorized by Casanova, pro vided we acknowledge: a) that in the case of the Catholic Church, we are still far away from a fair acknowledgement of the political rules of the game; and b) that the publicness of public religion can only become legit imate if it overcomes the post-Christian bias of majority political cultures and states in Europe. Public Islam can only become viable and legitimate</page><page sequence="24">The Euro-Islamic Roots of Secularity: A Difficult Equation • 435 under these two crucial conditions. Such a scenario could develop into a third segment of the Euro-Islamic equation, potentially including the key variables in its solution. The condition for public religion to unfold and thrive would be that all religious groups and institutions are allowed to play a crucial role within the reproduction and negotiation of value sys tems on a fair and equal basis. Nonetheless, we should heed Asad's warnings that the root of the problem, and the limitation of the solutions currently traded, lie in the fact that secularity is not easily soluble into post-secular arrangements based on any type of "cultural dialogue" because its institutional kernel — the insti tutions of modern citizenship within nation-states — is intrinsically built on the European post-Christian, post-Enlightenment and post-imperial, cul tural self-understanding of majorities. These are intended — that is, they understand themselves — not merely as fluctuating political-electoral but as stable cultural and national, sometimes even civilizational majorities. Every group that does not belong to such a majority is, therefore, con sidered a minority to be watched and monitored, and is continuously required to prove its loyalty. Therefore, hopes for a cultural dialogue and a fair participation of religious groups in public life depend on whether a dialogic re-foundation of the European public sphere — by eroding the mythical, ethnic and cultural foundations of the nation-states — will dis solve the idea of cultural majorities and overcome the limitations of polit ical and religious tolerance as conceived and practiced so far, and open the way to public Islam — as an important instance of public religion as identified by Casanova — to become one of the factors of the new Europe. Usually, however, a public dialogue and pattern of fairness, as exemplified by the above-mentioned work of Vico, cannot be established merely by the intrinsic virtue of a political programme but can only emerge through conflict. These are not merely communicative conflicts. As shown by de-veiling laws — from Atatürk's Turkish republic to contemporary France — the conflict impinges on human bodies. Everywhere in Europe, there is a fierce struggle over the control of the public display and posture of "Muslim female" bodies between the women themselves (whom an ethical and humanist vision of human rights fails to make the sole owners of their bodies), their families, the state and self-appointed defenders of the Enlightenment (including white feminist groups). At the moment, they are inserted into the Euro-Islamic equation; the universality of human rights and women's rights is severely shaken. This is not too surprising since, as Spinoza — who represents in this analysis the fragile but central axis of the Euro-Islamic equation — observed, rights are permanently at risk of becoming the new fetishes of secularity if one does not seriously cope with their underlying powers. It seems that the wise king of Krinke Kesmes solved one problem,</page><page sequence="25">436 • Armando Salvatore but created another that exists at a deeper level and appears to be more intractable, as demonstrated by the current stalemate of the Euro-Islamic equation. It is difficult to deny that secularity encroaches on the concrete life forms and modes of governance of populations and their bodies, and feeds into biopolitical machineries. It is clear that the implications of sec ularity go beyond this mere reduction and confinement of religion to a "sphere" of individual or, at most, non-political "community" life. Secularity presupposes and continuously produces notions of agency, that is, action and passion. Current liberal secular parlance — well reflected in the dis course of NGOs — is entrenched in a specific legal notion of the agent, pointing to "the act of giving power to someone and to someone's power to act [that] becomes a metaphysical quality defining secular human agency" (Asad, 2003:79). There is not enough space in the official legal-public sphere for notions of empowerment and agency based on less subjectivist and more relational views. Yet, these alternative notions do gain public space and make it more complex through the actions and movements of indi vidual and collective actors who reconstruct religious identities and notions of justice. In contemporary Europe, these include several Muslim groups that play on a number of levels by expounding on "their" Islam (or lack thereof) in various and often conflicting ways. While European societies appear to be seeking new secular balances, the institutional mechanisms of the state are at risk of becoming ever more entrenched in a surpassed and ineffective vision of secularity. The syn drome of Krinke Kesmes represents the actual predicament of the Euro Islamic landscape. While Casanova's view of the legitimacy of public religion is analytically insightful and enriches the Euro-Islamic equation in positive ways, one cannot turn a blind eye to the dark side of the current predica ment, as highlighted by Asad's following warning: If Europe cannot be articulated in terms of complex space and complex timethat allow for multiple ways of life (and not merely multiple identities) to flourish, it may be fated to be no more than the common market of an imperial civilization, always anxious about (Muslim) exiles within its gates and (Muslim) barbarians beyond (Asad, 2003:180).
