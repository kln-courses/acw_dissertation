Despite the temporary delay in the crisis when Poseidon rallied the Achaeans, their situation was pretty desperate and Agamemnon, never filled with confidence, was once more ready to throw in the towel. There was only one hope for the Greeks: if Zeus' attention could be diverted from the battle, then Poseidon, and the other gods who favoured the Greek side, might intervene in the uneven fight. These events, of course, led up to the famous scene of Zeus' deception in the I4th Book of the Iliad. All went well and according to plan: Hera, who had armed herself like a hero going into battle, accomplished her purpose with the help of Aphrodite's magic band. It is a charming scene with many touches of humour but also some alien notes. Who are these gods who so easily fell prey to common human desires, and why did Zeus declare his love for Hera in a way which could not fail to offend his jealous wife? "... Never before," he said, has love for any goddess or woman so melted about the heart inside me, ... not ... when I loved the wife of Ixion, nor when I loved ... Danae, ... Europa, ... Semele, or Alkmene, Demeter ... (or) Leto." 1 Hera for once ignored the insult. She seemed quite unmoved by Zeus' catalogue of conquests. There is a clash between Hera's human nature as Zeus' wife in myth and the traditional long list of alliances between Zeus and mortal as well as divine ladies. A somewhat similar scene occurs in the fifth Book of the Odyssey when Calypso was moved to accuse the gods of selfishness, because she herself must release Odysseus though other goddesses had often made mortals their hus- bands, like Demeter who, "lay down with Jasion and loved him in a thrice-ploughed field."2 It was Gilbert Murray, I think, who first explained such gross misconduct on historical grounds. Homer's gods had originally been nature powers but in later times retained their characteristics as figures 1 II. 14, 215ff. Here and elsewhere Lattimore's translation has been used. 2 Od. 5, I26f. 9</page><page sequence="2">I30 B. C. Dietrich of vegetation and fertility. Demeter's Sacred Marriage with Jasion in the ploughed field ensured its fruitfulness for the coming season. Thus, we might go on, Calypso not only seriously misread the historical evidence by reducing a symbolic sacred act to the level of human mis- conduct, but the myths of Demeter and Jasion and of Zeus' many amours were conceived relatively late as somewhat desperate aitia to explain obscure religious practices from the past. The poet of Iliad 14 also saw the beneficent effect on nature of the union between Zeus the Weather-god and Hera his wife and sister. Despite its ridiculous features and distinctive flavour of divine burlesque, the scene ends on a splendidly lyrical and almost noble note. "There underneath them the divine earth broke into young, fresh grass, and into dewy clover, crocus and hyacinth so thick and soft it held the hard ground deep away from them. There they lay down together and drew about them a golden wonderful cloud, and from it the glimmering dew descended."3 There is a contrast, which was obviously intended by the poet, between the serious and frivolous aspects of the gods. Another quite confusing mixture of opposites seems to be the juxtaposition of old and new in both passages. The figures of Zeus and Hera, like the ritual involving Demeter and Jaison, were rooted in the past. In fact Zeus and Hera already appeared together on the Linear B tablets from Knossos and Pylos, that is at least as early as the thirteenth century B.C. 4 But their functions, behaviour and degree of humanisation, although to some extent indebted to oriental precedent, were essentially new and tailored to fit the needs of epic poetry. One might also be inclined to attribute the elements of divine burles- que to the epic poet's irreverent treatment of traditional gods whose real religious significance had faded away. But Homeric religion was not as simple as that, nor was undignified divine behaviour uncommon in ancient belief. Hittite gods for example frequently acted in unseemly manner 5 and the fashion, which became common in drama from Attic Middle Comedy, of reducing the gods to figures of fun did not really originate with Homer, or, incidentally, prove that the Greeks lacked 8 II. i4, 343-35I. 4 da-ma-te once in Pylos, PY En 609, but the identification with the goddess remains very uncertain, J.

Obviously many outside forces helped to shape aspects of the Iliad and Odyssey in the long period of their formation. The mixture of old and new, strange and familiar is particularly evident in another episode in which the extreme humanisation of the gods was combined with ridicule. This is the tale of Ares and Aphrodite which Demodocus recited at Alcinous' banquet in honour of Odysseus. 6 It is a famous Story. Informed by Helios, the Sun-god, of Aphrodite's misconduct with Ares, her husband Hephaestus caught the pair in flagranti delicto and bound them with chains. But instead of hiding his shame the injured Hephaestus then summoned all fellow Olympians to the scene as witnesses. "Father Zeus," he cried, "and all you other blessed immortal gods, come here, to see a ridiculous sight, no seemly matter, how Aphrodite daughter of Zeus holds me in little favour, but she loves ruinous Ares because he is handsome, and goes sound on his feet, while I am misshapen from birth..." 7 The goddesses stayed away through modesty, but Poseidon, Apollo and Hermes hurried to the scene in answer to Hephaestus' invitation, and "among the blessed immortals uncontrollable laughter went up." Curiously the divine sense of humour responded not so much to the picture of Ares and Aphrodite in bed together, or to the discomfiture of the cuckolded husband, but mainly to his skill, because the lame Hephaestus was able to catch Ares, "the swiftest of all the gods on Olympus." 8 The episode has been much discussed by modern scholars, since the gods appear to have passed all bounds of propriety and patently des- cended to the level of immoral behaviour. Apollo actually asked Hermes whether he would risk an equal penalty in order to win Aphrodite's favours, to which Hermes irresponsibly replied that he would gladly suffer "thrice this number of endless fastenings, and all you gods could be looking on and all the goddesses, and still I would sleep by the side of Aphrodite the golden." 9 Such conduct seems out of context in the Odyssey where the gods generally presented a more moral front than in the earlier epic. Quite true, the scurrilous tale was sandwiched between two others 6 Od. 8, 266-366. 7 Od. 8, 306-311. 8 Cf. W. Burkert, "Das Lied von Ares und Aphrodite," R.M.

Dietrich from the history of the Trojan conflict, namely the account of the quarrel between Odysseus and Achilles, 10to and the story of the Wooden Horse. 11 Therefore one might classify the first as a memory of divine behaviour in the Iliad on a par with the notorious Fight of the Gods in Book 21, or with the scene of Hera's seduction of Zeus. 12 But there is one vital difference: the squabbling in Book 21, like the scene of Hera and Zeus in 12, and indeed all instances of ungodlike Olympian conduct in the Iliad formed part of the Trojan legend, that is they directly belonged to the plot of that epic. In other words the poets had a hand in determining divine attitudes and actions which were made to conform with the immediate needs of the story. This condition is particularly evident in the Theomachy in which the gods, who had been paired off in Book 20, 13 fought as champions of either the Greeks or Trojans. The undignified episode, which was linked to the preceding battle between Xanthus and Hephaestus, was strictly partisan: Athena knocked down Ares and Aphrodite as prolongers of the war. 14 Posei- don's challenge of Apollo was similarly motivated: he blamed Apollo for favouring the Trojans although he had been cheated of his just rewards by Laomedon. The case is different in the Ares-Aphrodite story which seems less anchored in the immediate present of the Trojan War but was im- portant and well known enough to figure on an 8th/7th century B.C. vase. 15 The story concealed traditional elements. How many and how old is hard to say, as Homer was fond of bringing together separate traditions and using them for his own purposes. Zeus' scales of fate and death for example, or the story of Achilles' horse Xanthus, which took voice at a critical moment in the Iliad, 16 were such mixtures of old and new. Similarly the device of golden chains to hold an enemy or opponent may have first occurred in the myth of Hephaestus binding 10 8, 73-82. 11 8, 499-520. 12 See Burkert, R.M.

However, if true this does not reflect on the age of the legend. There is no doubt that the association of Aphrodite and Hephaestus was very old indeed. Certainly the burlesque element in the story need be no argument to the contrary. Scholars have long wondered why Aphrodite should have been wed- ded to the lame, ugly and absurd Smith-god. The explanation lies in the history of cult in the eastern Mediterranean and particularly in Ana- tolia and Syria, that is that part of the world which was nearer the home of both figures than the west. In the east, in areas of rich mineral deposits, metal mining and production brought prosperity to a settle- ment. The deities of such communities therefore were guardians of this vital industry: their sanctuaries stood within the actual "industrial" area and their cult images-male and female-were sometimes shown standing on metal ingots. Examples of this practice from the Late Bronze Age have come to light in Sinai for example, where a goddess received worship in a sanctuary of the XII Dynasty at Serabit el- Khadem within a copper mining area. s18 A thirteenth century B.C. sanctuary of Hathor has also come to light near copper mines at Timna. 19 At Sardis in Anatolia the Pactolus gold-refining installa- tions were next to the sacred area and altar of Cybele. 20 Another name in this context is that of the I4th century B.C. Smith-god Kothar- Khasis who played a part in Ugaritic myth. 21 However, the finest examples of the identification of the community god and goddess with the mining industry come to us from Cyprus which was of course the most important centre of copper production in the ancient world. The recent excavations of prehistoric settlements throughout the island and particularly at Tamassos, Enkomi and Kition have produced numerous instances of sanctuary and images associated with the copper workings. The remarkable fact emerging from all the 17 Burkert, R.M. O103 (1960) 132. 18 V. Karageorghis, Kition: Mycenaean and Phoenician Discoveries in Cyprus, London 1976, 75. 19 B.

Dietrich Cypriot evidence is the continuity of religious cult at these sites. 22 The figures, who had evolved from guardians of the community to become the protectors of the community's metal work, essentially remained the same from Mycenaean to Phoenician and Classical Greek times, although their names might have changed with the people, as say from Aphrodite to Astarte. 23 Quite regularly, too, communities worshipped not one but two copper deities: probably one god and one goddess. Temples II and III at Kition for example from the thirteenth century B.C. were the home of such a pair which became known in historical times as Hephaestus and Aphrodite. 24 Evidently the Smith- god and goddess had been allied in cult from the Bronze Age and enjoyed the highest standing in the east as chief deities and protectors of their communities. The story was different in the west partly for economical reasons. Metal production and export did not constitute important sources of revenue in that part of the world. Also the artisan class for a long time remained socially inferior in Greece. This message clearly emerges from Hesiod's Works and Days. Hephaestus accordingly became respectable in the west only relatively late. In Athens his first temple, which incidentally stood near some metallurgical installations in the agora, was built in the sixth century B.C. presumably to honour him as patron god of the guild of metal workers. 25 To Homer, though, the artisan god was still ugly, ridiculous and, like Aphrodite, of little consequence in the Olympian hierarchy. Hephaestus belonged to another class, if not world, with different values, for his unmatched technical skill was never questioned. In Book 18 of the Iliad in the description of the making of Achilles' new armour Hephaestus' ability as smith received its due. The poet in a transparent Hesiodic-type allegory personified Grace, Charis, and made her Hephaestus' wife, 22 Karageorghis, Kition 75; 171; 172; cf. the review of the book by J. N. Coldstream in J.H.S. 97 (1977) 213. 23 Religious continuity seems certain, but one should perhaps not overlook archaeological breaks between periods as at Kition for example where some 150 years elapsed between the end of the Mycenaean ashlar temples and the erection in the ruins of the largest of these of the Phoenician Astarte temple. 24 Karageorghis, Kition I69f. 25 Karageorghis, Acts of the Intern.

Traditional and imported religious elements existed side by side, or had been com- pounded, with the poet's own conception of the gods thereby creating contrast and indeed tensions which occasionally produced irrational elements in divine behaviour. The marriage of Hephaestus and Aphro- dite, which was eminently reasonable in the light of past cult associa- tion, became the silly mismatch of the ages in the context of the Iliad and Odyssey where the union between War and Beauty seemed closer to epic values. In fact both Ares and Aphrodite shared an interest in the Trojan cause and proved their friendship more than once in the Iliad. Ares lent her his horses when she was wounded and in pain and wished to run from the battle, 27 while Aphrodite stood by Ares when he was under attack from Athena. 28 It would be hard to find a better example in Homer of poetic convenience clashing with traditional myth. 29 The latter was clearly incorporated in Demodocus' song. However the extreme humanisation of the situation and of the figures involved in it brilliantly reflected the poetic view of the working of the gods. In the general laughter of the Olympians Poseidon alone remained serious and attempted to mediate, like Hephaestus on another occasion in a quarrel between Zeus and Hera. 30 But while Hephaestus advised Hera to remember past ex- perience and submit to Zeus' superior strength, Poseidon in this episode guaranteed financial restitution to the injured husband if he should release the adulterous Ares. 31 Without regard to the morals of the case, it is worth noting the legal type of argument in the remarkable ending to this amusing escapade, and the thought that the gods could incur guilt through their actions. 26 Schol. on II. 18, 382, 6'L 'j 'X vrr3 v oXp&amp;v 7tpoaLvoL act .

Dietrich Perhaps then the Homeric gods moved in some kind of fourth dimension in which they disported themselves like men but without acknowledging any kind of responsibilities or even any close relation- ship with the world of men. The poets' answer to a question along these lines would most likely have been ambiguous. On one side the gods clearly felt superior to man on moral and all other grounds, continually admonishing one another not to quarrel for the sake of base mankind. 32 However, on the other hand every one of the Olympians was deeply involved in the doings and events of the plot. Homeric theology obviously wanted and got it both ways even at the cost of creating new contradictions. The contrast appears particularly strong in the Iliad, and the participants in the adventure of Ares and Aphro- dite seem more closely related to the picture of the gods in that epic. It has been suggested that the free and irresponsible behaviour of the gods in the Iliad may have been the poet's way of throwing the more serious consequences of comparable human action into stronger relief. In other words the gods in their vast superiority carelessly engaged in actions which on the human scale would and did have disastrous effects. 33 Thus Ares' affair with Aphrodite ended in laughter and a fine but Paris' abduction of Helen in bloody war and the destruction of Troy. This modern view seems plausible except for the implication that the gods in the Iliad were poetic invention without roots in the past. No one still seriously disputes the Bronze Age Mycenaean ancestry of the Homeric gods. They were real figures of faith, no less real in fact to Homer's audience than the epic heroes themselves, and no less "historical" than the account of the conflict about Troy. Hence the manner of praying, the ritual and form of sacrifice, which were fre- quently described in considerable detail in both Iliad and Odyssey, can be recognized as those of the archaic Greek world and probably did not greatly differ from Mycenaean practice if one could recon- struct ancient procedure. These points have been overlooked by some modern scholars who lost their way in the philological detail of the poems. 34 No such doubts existed throughout Greek history, and even 32 E.g. II. I, 574; 21, 379f. ; 463f. 33 Burkert, R.M. (1960) 140; A Lesky, "Homeros," P.-W. Suppl. XI (1967) 47. 34 Cf. A.

Thus we may unhesitatingly reject extreme views that the Homeric gods had no religious meaning at all. 35 The truth lies somewhere nearer W. F. Otto's identification of Homeric with Greek Religion. 36 Also, for all their anthropomorphism, Homer's gods were something more than the reflection of human society on a grander scale, as Nilsson believed. 37 However, this is not the place to rehearse modern views of Homeric religion. Heubeck's recent study of the "Homerische Frage" and modern interpretations of Homer's "Weltanschauung" 38 illustrate the tremendous variety of opinions which tend to advocate one or two particular theories at the expense of others that may be equally plausible. If we accept, as on the evidence we obviously should, the Olympian gods as real figures of faith and worship, the next logical step should be to examine their credentials in living contemporary cult. There has been endless talk of the different levels of religion in Homer, partic- ularly of the division between popular belief and literary religion. 39 Although the Homeric picture of cult and temples hardly reflected that from the archaeological remains of the Greek world, 40 it does not require much effort to establish beyond reasonable doubt firstly that Homer was aware of past religious tradition and secondly that the majority of the members of his Olympian family possessed familiar cult names. But few cult localities or cults were actually identified in Homer, in the main because neither epic concerned itself with that aspect of life, but also for other reasons as will become evident in a 35 P.

Dietrich moment. All we get are memories and hints like the mention of Poseidon's grove at Onchestos, 41 or the memory of his cult at Pylos, where he had been worshipped from Mycenaean times. 42 At both sites Poseidon had played the part of a community god, however, in stark contrast to his function in Homer as god of the sea. The Cata- logue of Ships alluded to Demeter's precinct in Thessalian Pyrasos. 43 Aphrodite took refuge at her altar and in her temenos in Cypriot Paphos after her humiliation at the hands of Hephaestus. 44 The monumental remains at both places prove presence of cult there from the Bronze Age or, at the former site, even earlier. But in Homer the goddesses were mere shadows of the past and certainly neither posses- sed her old status as community or city deity. Even Zeus' temenos and "smoking altar" on the peak of Mt. Ida in the Troad 45 seems quite divorced from any function as guardian of the community. Perhaps the same is not entirely true of Zeus' title as "ruler of wintry Dodona," 46 whose oracle Odysseus consulted, 47 but generally Zeus' altars could be anywhere even outside the geographical limits of a community, in an army camp, on a ship, at home as well as in a city. Only Athena and Apollo possessed temples in Homer in Athens and in Troy. 48 Apollo had two in the Troad, and, like his title of Smintheus by which the priest Chryse addressed him, 49 they belonged to him as city god and guardian. so Similarly the fact that one of Athena's temples also stood on the Trojan acropolis, next to that of Apollo, 51 and the other on the Acropolis at Athens, 52 is proof of her status as Polias. In their case cult and background survived clearly defined. But the same can not be said of other major Olympians. Beside his two favourites Homer ignored cult and home of Hera 41 II. 2, 50; Horn.

Both Apollo and Athena still kept one divine foot, or at least toe, in the old world of localised cult. For the rest, however, they were committed to progress, because they acted more commonly as general gods and champions of their side without appearing to be tied to particular cities. Thus Herodotus was only partly right in his famous assertion that Homer and Hesiod gave the gods their "names, honours, functions and their outward appearance." 53 The gods' names were old as were their cults, but their functions were subject to change causing the kind of ferment and tension which had been observed above. Antithesis was of course the very life blood of classical Greeks in art, literature and in their very mode of expression and style. It would perhaps be rash to attribute to Homer the origins of this almost excessive preoccupation, but it certainly formed a basic element in the behaviour of the epic gods who were in a way subject to growing pains. Lesky has attempted to categorize some of the more striking examples of paradoxical, irrational and contradictory divine actions in sets of opposites. He contrasts the nearness of the gods to mankind with their occasional remoteness or distance, their kind actions with the cruelty of their dealings with men, and their sense of justice with their self-will. 54 On one hand Athena gave friendly counsel to Dio- mede, 55 or plotted together with Odysseus for the destruction of the suitors, 56 on the other Apollo brutally reminded Diomede of the gulf between man and gods, "Strive no longer," he calls out to the hero, "to make yourself like the gods in mind, since never the same is the breed of gods, who are immortal, and men who walk groundling." 57 Contrast, too, Athena's kindness when she protected Menelaus from Pandarus' arrow like a mother who "brushes a fly away from a child," 58 with the cruelty with which she delivered Hector into the 58 2, 53. 54 A.

Dietrich hands of his enemy, 59 or Aphrodite's rescue of her darling Paris from certain death at the hands of Menelaus with her command to Helen to join Paris later during the same episode at the end of the third Book of the Iliad. As far as it is possible to observe any strict categorization within Homeric religion these pairs do illustrate Lesky's theory without, however, providing evidence of different levels of popular and epic religion in Homer. A few antinomies could have been, and probably were, due to a clash of historic cult with epic theology, in the sense that a god's traditional function could be enlarged or altered altogether in the role he was assigned in the Iliad and Odyssey. There is for example a case to be made out for the special relationship of Athena with heroes like Diomede and particularly Odysseus as a survival of the goddess' function in prehistoric Mycenaean times as palace goddess and protectress of the king. 60so Apollo's warning, on the other hand, of the wide gulf between gods and men is evidence of a new stage of religious evolution which became more commonplace in archaic and classical literature. But there is not the same easy division to be found in the antithesis between kind and cruel god, as both qualities seem to have been part of one religious complex, precisely like another possible set of contrasts between the ridiculous and the noble in divine actions. 61 Contrast for example the undignified squabbling on Olym- pus in Book 21 of the Iliad with the noble lines in Book I when almighty Zeus granted Thetis her request, "He spoke, the son of Kronos, and nodded his head with the dark brows, and the immortally anointed hair of the great god swept from his divine head, and all Olympus was shaken." 62 Irrational and contradictory behaviour was apparently inherent in the nature of the Homeric gods and only occasionally explicable on the grounds of historic development. Nor did the gods reflect only the interests of the upper crust, the "Herrenschicht," but they covered a wider spectrum of archaic Greek society. This is obvious in the case of the later poem, for simple folk like the swineherd Eumaeus could be seen to turn to the gods with his hopes, wishes and prayer. But there 59 II. 22, 214. o60 Nilsson, Gesch. 8, I, 371; Dietrich, Origins of Greek Religion, Berlin 1974, 38f. 61 Cf. Heubeck, Horn. Frage, I85. 62 fl.

The gods' sense of justice was notoriously still underdeveloped in the Iliad, but it was there all the same, while conversely the socially more conscious Odyssey still retained glaring instances of divine self- interest. For example the narrow partisan attitudes of the gods of the Iliad contrast sharply with the picture in the Patrocleia of a righteous Zeus punishing injustice among men: "When Zeus sends down the most violent waters in deep rage against mortals after they stir him to anger because in violent assembly they pass decrees that are crooked, and drive righteousness from among them and care nothing for what the gods think." 63 This passage, which Nilsson called a cry from the depth of despair, 64 already had the flavour of the later Hesiodic concept of dike, Justice 65 and leaves no doubt at all that Zeus was concerned with the justice of everyone in the city and not just the aristocratic rulers. The concept of the gods as general moral powers is more at home in the Odyssey of course. In the very first Book Zeus at the council of gods blamed men for their own misdeeds. 66 There are three other famous passages in the Odyssey with clear expressions of belief in divine justice by three quite different members of Ithacan society, namely the swineherd Eumaeus, 67 the suitors, 68 and Laertes. 69 But there was also still a place for divine self-interest. Poseidon for example pursued his own private vendetta against Odysseus who blinded the god's son Polyphemus, although the latter had broken all laws of civilized behaviour and hospitality. Such laws fell within the province of Zeus Xeinios who protected the rights of all guests. This moral function of Zeus, which was several times expressed or implied else- where in the Odyssey, 70 therefore stood in strong contrast with the 683 II. 16, 385-388. 64 Gesch. 8 I, 421, "ein Aufschrei aus der Tiefe, der dem Homer sehr unihnlich ist." 65 Nilsson, ibid.; cf.

It is an interesting thought that Poseidon's anger, as the cause of Odysseus' suffering and wanderings, constituted an important element in the plot of the Odyssey, while the punishment of Troy-that is the primary motivation of the Iliad-could be understood as the just retribution for Paris' crime against the same Zeus Xeinios. This thought certainly occurred to Menelaus after he killed Peisander in Book 13. 71 Poseidon's selfish behaviour illustrates an important principle in the much discussed motivation of divine intervention in Homer. Apart from the Dios Boule in the Iliad and the decision to allow Odysseus' return in the Odyssey, the gods rarely concerned themselves with the interests of the story as a whole. Hence they intervened in the action as beings of religious belief more often than as the instruments of the poet. In some cases they actually operated as a negative force not only on moral grounds by our standards, but also for dramatic reasons. For example when Athena appeared to Achilles stopping him from killing Agamemnon, she apparently denied him the opportunity of controlling his own actions. 72 Agamemnon, too, seems weak to us in blaming Zeus, Fate and Erinys, rather than himself, for his high handed action of taking Briseis for himself and causing Achilles' wrath. 73 To the Homeric audience, who did not regard Agamemnon as a contemptible coward, his excuse must have seemed legitimate; but later generations have continued to wonder whether Homer's heroes lacked the power to act independently, especially in the light of the poet's comment on another occasion that, "always the mind of Zeus is a stronger thing than a man's mind. He terrifies even the warlike man, he takes away victory lightly, when he himself has driven a man in to battle." 74 The question of human responsibility in Homer has been the subject of debate at least since Plutarch, who contrasted the Epicurean view of human dependence on divine will with the Stoic arguments of man's free will, 75 and the discussion continues to this day. 76 In so far as 71 II. 13, 623ff. 72 II.

The interaction of both forces produced what is undoubtedly the most awkward scene in the Iliad, and also in a way its climax, namely the death of Hector. For us Athena's blatant cheating is most difficult to justify on dramatic, moral, or any other grounds. Everyone, including Hector himself, knew Achilles' invincibility, in fact Hector's courage as an epic hero precisely resided in his resolution to face Achilles in combat though his life was already forfeit. The scene is critical to the understanding of the complex elements of Homeric theology and deserves a closer look. The setting is familiar: at the opening of Book 22 Hector had decided, against the pleas of his parents, to remain alone outside the gates of Troy to face the raging Achilles. The circumstances, as well as Hector's arguments, recall ability to act spontaneously, Die Entdeckung des Geistes s, 1955, 40; Gesammelte Schriften, 1966, 52; and his slightly modified view in response to Lesky's argu- ments, "Gottliche und Menschliche Motivation im Homerischen Epos," Argumen- tationes, Festschrift.

For a review of the modern arguments see also Heubeck, Homrn. Frage, I89ff., who is on Lesky's side. 77 Cf. F. Robert, Horrme, Paris 1950, 7f. E. R. Dodds' view is similar. He postulates that in this and other incidents of this kind the highly personal divine intervention represented a poetic way of expressing a psychological event in the hero's mind, The Greeks and the Irrational, Berkeley 1963, 14. It seems more difficult, however, to agree with his extreme proposal, ibid., that the "divine machinery" developed out of this kind of psychological experience. 78 Cf. H.

Their reasoning moved entirely on a human level, although, as prominent Trojan heroes, they could count on the support of Apollo. However, as the story of Hector's destruction unfolds a secondary divine level is introduced as a motivating force. Signposts in the narrative and spee- ches, which on their own could still be explained as meaningless poetic devices or mere "Redensarten," as Nilsson puts it, assume a deeper religious significance in the context of this passage. So references to Hector's fate by the poet and by Hector himself, 79 like Apollo's support of Hector by lending him strength and speed to keep running from Achilles, 80so and the latter's threat that "Athena will soon kill you by my spear," 81 might have been commonplace fagons de parler and did not necessarily directly involve the gods in the conflict. Each hero naturally boasted that his god was on the right side and would make him win. But the gods were watching the race and Zeus, who considered prolonging Hector's life, as once before he had hoped to protect his son Sarpedon, quickly yielded to the argument that mortal man should not be released from his fate of death. 82 Zeus took up his golden scales and weighed the keres of death of Hector and Achilles. The heavier one of Hector sank to the ground. s83 Two or three points are of vital concern here. Firstly the tenor of the passage suggests that the audience knew that Hector must succumb. The poet twice stated unambiguously that Achilles was the better man. 84 Hector fled in blind terror before the stronger man. Perhaps he also realised that his predestined time had come to pay atonement to Achilles as the dying Patroclus had prophesied. s5 Certainly Achilles was aware of his moral and physical superiority. He prevented his people from intervening lest he should lose any part of his glory for the killing of Hector. 86 The picture is one of the hunter sure of his prey. 79 II. 22, 5; 280. 80so 203f. s1 270f. 82 18o. 83 212f. 84 158; 202. 85 II. 16, 853f. 86 22, 206f.</page><page sequence="17">Views of Homeric gods and religion 145 Secondly, though the outcome of the duel was never in doubt, 87 the contest had yet to be formally decided on the divine level by the symbolic yet ancient image of Zeus' scales. 88ss At this moment the doomed hero was deserted by Apollo releasing his divine antagonist Athena who now brought the contest to a swift end. Athena's inter- vention then represented the numinous force validating what had already been determined on purely physical grounds. 89 But the story was of course worked out in the usual Homeric terms of the humanised figure of Athena quite needlessly coming to the aid of her favourite. Hence the manner in which she accomplished her purpose, although the means should be unimportant in the case of a religious power impersonally working its will, seems repulsive and dramatically un- acceptable when viewed in human terms, as the poet did. The third point finally is that this paradoxical situation of a deceitful goddess helping the stronger hero arose from the fact that the poet willingly or unwillingly interrelated the not entirely compatible human and divine levels of operation. The human level meant the plot, and Hector's death was necessary at this stage of the plot having been foreshadowed in the chain of events 90 which began with the killing of Patroclus and ultimately pointed forward to Achilles' own end as predicted by Hector. 91 The divine level or motivation of these hap- penings, however, turned out to be a somewhat unbalanced presentation of old religious forces in the dress of Homeric Olympians. Hector incidentally became fully aware of his destiny at the moment when "Deiphobus" deserted him. 92 At this point he transcended the stereotype qualities of the typical epic hero and by his decision to fight on despite certain death, he anticipated the tragic power of the major figures in Aeschylean tragedy. But that is another story. 93 The rough joins in the treatment of the different religious elements at work in this episode are useful indications that the Homeric poets 87 Hence the question whether Zeus or Fate controlled Hector's destiny becomes unimportant, cf. my Death, Fate and the Gods, corr. repr.

Over the extended period of its composition, which was essentially complete in the archaic age, Homeric epic in fact constituted one of the two major forces of religious change in the Greek world. The other was the important and generally shared social event of synoecism which brought many localised community gods to the acropolis of each of the city-states. Otherwise only few foreign elements seriously interfered with the transmission of religious beliefs from prehistoric times. During the rigours of the Dark Age in Greece the names and cults of clan and community deities were preserved by individual surviving communities, whether they stayed in the old country or joined the eastward stream of migrants across the Aegean. Homeric epic was of course bound to work with the no longer localised group of gods of the Polls who kept their names but not always the same functions. Community gods tended to become more general forces. Athena and Apollo for example, though also retaining their original characteristics as guardians of their community, grew into more universal divine figures. The same was true of others like Hera and Artemis. Poseidon from the community god of Pylos changed into the Earth-shaker and the universal god of the sea. However, he could also be symbolic of the sea itself or even a storm at sea. This development was a new step in Greek religion: gods not only governed elemental powers of nature but became identified with them. Hephaestus after being the age-old protector of his community of copper workers lent his name to the element of fire, as in his battle with Xanthus, who himself vacillated between river-god and anthropomorphic figure. The formerly mighty Aphrodite could from the time of Homeric epic sometimes be reduced to a word for Love. Demeter, too, gradually declined to a symbol for grain or bread. 94 The poets in their religious fervour added new personifications to the ranks of old gods. Ares for example, whose cultic past was obscure to say the least, merely personified War. Helios, the Sun, too, was a new creation in the Greek pantheon. But all these figures, which had been welded into the family of Olympians, either never lost or were newly endowed with their humanised mythological character into which they could change at will with Protean speed. Aphrodite was Love or goddess, Hephaestus Fire or humble limping 9 II. 13, 322; 21, 76.</page><page sequence="19">Views of Homeric gods and religion 147 god of the smithy, and Zephyrus could either be the west-wind or a god courteously rising for Iris. 95 For all its contradictions there is some discernible order in Homeric theology, and it is possible, without forcing the evidence, to classify the epic gods into fairly loose categories. One might isolate three general groups of gods of which the first two are made up of figures of traditional cult whose origins were similar as nature and community gods. The third class consists of epic inventions which had been added to the other beings on Olympus. The first of these groups is headed by Zeus and made up of his colleagues of first rank, so to speak, namely Hera, Athena, Apollo, Artemis and Poseidon. The second comprises figures of lesser stature for reasons which appear to be unconnected with the past history of their importance in cult. They are Hephaestus, Aphrodite, Dionysus, Demeter and Hermes. 96 Finally the new gods belonged to the last class: they were still of little con- sequence as religious forces but, with the imprimatur of Homeric epic, they were destined to develop into significant figures of cult receiving worship and respect. They are the War-god Ares, Hestia, the per- sonification of the Hearth, Hades, god of the underworld, whose name is etymologically transparent, and of course Helios, the Sun. All these gods, with the exception of Dionysus, who existed in Homer solely as an echo of his past myths, performed their now specialised functions which they jealously guarded. Poseidon for example was quick to rebuke Zeus for interfering in an area which should have been out of his control in the division of the world. 97 Though still visibly part of a tradition which had endured from the Bronze Age, Homer's gods created a new mythology of their own which, together with their functions, their close family relationship, and their increasing preference for working from afar, gave them their new form. The remoteness of these major gods strangely contrasts with their former custom of appearing directly to their worshippers. Many reli- gious scenes in Minoan and Mycenaean art show a divine epiphany in the sky or at a place of cult. Sometimes an entire crowd expectantly 95 II. 23, 203. 96 Omitted from this list are figures of no consequence at any stage of the poems, or whose origins are obscure such as Leto, Dione, Iris, Thetis. 97 II. 15, I9Iff.</page><page sequence="20">148 B. C. Dietrich seems to await the divine arrival at a festival. Old invocatory titles like King, Queen or Lady-Anax, Anassa and Potnia-did survive in Homer and later but no longer with the same significance. 98 Perhaps Athena's deep concern for Odysseus recalled this special relationship between the king and the palace goddess. Once too when the priestess Thano presented the new peplos to Athena on the Trojan citadel, the scene suggests that the goddess herself rather than her mere image received the gift. 99 These few religious anachronisms apart, however, the distance grew between man and Olympian whose anthro- pomorphic nature also began to lose its clear outline. Another casualty from the past was the mysterious bond between the animal world and the gods who could be imagined to appear in zoomorphic as well as human shape. The religious function of the bull, which had been central to older Aegean cult, the snake, ram, goat, horse, and other creatures, which still retained a hold on Greek popular imagination in many localised historic cults, had plainly vanished from epic. At best a few jejune memories managed to keep alive here and there in the form of puzzling epithets like cow-eyed Hera or gray- eyed Athena, 100oo or the faintly embarrassing story of Achilles' talking horse Xanthus, 101 but that was all. The same applies to the half-dozen instances in Homer when a god was imagined as a bird or compared to one. 102 No doubt the image recalled the old Minoan belief in bird epiphanies, 103 but the poet's overriding motive in these particular scenes was to suggest the suddenness of a bird's appearance, his speed, even his power and nobility. Hence the six episodes were primarily secular poetic devices which retained little religious significance, 104 98 Their use had become secularised. B.

The eagle carried or conveyed an omen of Zeus but did not represent him. Certainly much of Homeric innovation strikes one as a reduction to purely human terms of inherited religious concepts and practices with the overall effect of imparting a somewhat prosaic aspect to the emerging religion. Rationalism may be an acceptable term for describ- ing this process. But the rational elements in Homeric epic have been exaggerated, as Nilsson seems to have done, 10os because reason can be far removed from divine motivation and action. In fact only when the gods individually helped or obstructed in what men were doing could they be said to have acted on rational, however shabby, grounds. Accordingly realistic self-interest more accurately defines the action of the Olympians of all three of our groups. But this was only one narrow aspect of their operation which manifested itself on a variety of levels of which theologically the most progressive and indeed in- fluential on later thought was the emergence from group One of universal divine figures or powers that ultimately became representative of the new state cult in the Greek cities. There is no doubt that the elevation of Zeus the Weather-god to the high moral rank, which he was to attain in Hesiod and Aeschylus, had begun in Homeric epic. Between these two extremes divine force made itself felt in quite different ways in Homer, notably in the form of personified elemental powers of nature like a storm, flood or fire, or again as the motivation or expression of human will. The latter may either be seen from the point of view of the poet: Athena prevented Achilles from killing his superior king, or more generally through the eyes of the heroic Gitter, Sitzber. Heidelberg, 1967, 2; cf. Heubeck, Horn. Frage I87f. Dirlmeier's "rational" explanation has recently been criticised as too one-sided by Bannert who feels that, possibly apart from II. 5, 778f., these passages still suggested the working of a numinous power behind the obvious metaphor of speed and sudden- ness, (H. Bannert, "Zur Vogelgestalt der Gotter bei Homer," Wiener Studien N.F. 12 (1978) 29-42). It is certainly worth restating the religious background of this concept whose rationalisation, however, in the hands of the Homeric poets seems evident. 105 II. 5, 778f. 106 Gesch. 3 I, 368ff.

Dietrich character who held the gods accountable for his actions. In both cases, however, divine and human will appeared to coincide: man ultimately made his own decisions as a free agent. 107 Archaic and classical Greek art was of course pervaded by Homeric mythology. It also reflected the impact on society of the Homeric concept of the gods. The growth of epic influence on the minds of all citizens is particularly evident in the fully documented history of Attic vase painting in black and red figure. In the earlier black-figure style already gods had forgotten their past custom of attending cere- monies when invoked by their worshippers. Only rarely was Athena shown as coming to her festivals in her city. 10os Also in the earlier scenes gods, specially Athena of course, were not infrequently figured as patrons of individual heroes, a function which was common in older religious tradition. 109 However, the concept of the gods as members of one Olympian family was still new in Greek art in the first part of the sixth century B.C. Significantly the divine family became better known after the reorganization of the Panathenaic Festival in 566 B.C., when Homeric recitals were probably introduced, 110 and continued to be painted together in the later red-figure style. 111 But after 500 B.C. the Olympians generally appeared more in isolation, remote and separated from their prot~ggs. 112 Is it really possible to formulate any kind of coherent theology from the manifold workings of Homer's gods and of his complex beliefs ranging from base superstition to the first concepts of morality and justice in religion? Probably not. But some observations of a few general principles of Homeric religion are nevertheless valid and useful. Firstly this very range and mass of sometimes conflicting 107 See above and Gundert, Njb 3 (194o) 237: "So bewirken die Fiigungen der Gotter nichts anderes, als was diese Menschen aus sich selbst leisten und zu leisten vermogen, und die Frage, ob sie 'gebunden' seien oder 'frei,' trifft sie darum nicht." 1os E.g. at a sacrificial scene on a belly amphora by the Berlin painter, Berlin Staatliche Museen 1686, J.

Yet these epic gods were not merely literary figures of myth but divine powers which inspired faith. Finally the third and most important lesson to be learnt from the evidence is that the Homeric poets completely altered the course of Greek religion from its Aegean past, for we must never forget that Homeric religion and the religion of the Polis were one and the same thing. 113 U.C.W.
