<plain_text><page sequence="1">philosoph: of Science VOL. 6 April, 1939 NO. 2 Virtue and the Scientist BY WILLIAM MARIAS MALISOFF N THE practice of science lies the key to virtue. The proposition I have enunciated is not an obvious one. Its contradictory could con- ceivably be true. One might, for example, look upon the practice of science as a diabolical way of blinding one to the charms of virtue. One might look upon the practice of science as a deliberate plot to efface virtue, destroy it. Worse, one might look upon the practice of science as entirely apart from the issues of good and bad, of right and wrong, or of virtue and viciousness. The practice of science may be conceived as blind, itself vicious, or irresponsibly indifferent. The proposition I have enunciated is not a masked definition, a rule of syntax, or a convention. One should not try to read it: the practice of science = the key to virtue. One should not try to read it so that whatever statements about the practice of science may turn out to be they should always be formally convertible into statements concerning something called "a key to virtue" as to guarantee a necessary and invariant relation between them through the chains of an unbreakable convention. The proposition I have enunciated is an assertion concerning a state of affairs. As such it is analyzable into assertions con- cerning the "practice of science" and the other terms used. It is a typical scientific assertion and is entitled to the general rights and 127</page><page sequence="2">128 Virtue and the Scientist privileges of all such assertions, and is subject to the general restrictions of all such assertions. It may have a few special privileges and restrictions as well, if it can be shown to belong to a science, let us say, the science of scientific behaviors or the science of virtuous behaviors, which has its own special characteristics. The general privileges of a scientific assertion are: to be verifiable in some not unusual sense, to be intelligible in terms of experi- ment, to be directed toward truth as an ideal; the general restric- tions are: to be only probable, to be relative to contexts, to have some concrete reference. A special privilege or restriction of my assertion may be that it applies only to human behaviors and hence must carry the special character of being an assertion of a social science. These preliminaries aside I can turn to another set of considera- tions which are also of a preparatory character. I feel bound to refer to the virulent disagreement among scientists themselves and among outsiders who interest themselves in science as to the scope of the activity of science with reference to the entire human scene. The disagreement has become especially sharp in the last few years. Obviously it reflects the rising conflict between progress and reaction. On the whole those who are "isola- tionists" with regard to science, tend to reactionary political views. In specific cases of some well-meaning individuals this is very unfortunate. They mean to be "neutral", but neutrality invariably turns out in practice to be a tolerance of the supremacy of evil over the good. And that is itself evil. The "isolation" of science from the general field of action or behavior begins, as a rule, quite innocently. In the effort to explain the nature of the work of a scientist a philosopher of science might select only the most necessary characteristics of the scientist-in-action, portraying him either as an experimenting automaton or a logical machine, and forgetting to revivify him after the analysis. There results a notion of the division of people into "human beings" and "scientists". This is quite evident when someone turns to a scientist with a question the tenor of which is: "As a scientist, Mr. Blank, what do you think about such and such an issue?" Mr. Blank, if he has swallowed</page><page sequence="3">W. M. Malisoff 129 the facile characterizations he has received of himself, can only say that "as a scientist" he is not permitted to think in certain ways. He will gullibly state that he cannot think "as a scientist" in terms of values. He will parrot something about "suspension of judgment" by which he means not suspension of dogmatic judgment, but suspension of all judgment as if everything were in a vacuum. He has unwittingly accepted the division of mankind into human beings and scientists. In this our philo- sophic readers may see a parallel to the taking of "mind" out of "nature", a fallacy which has drawn the protests of philosophers ranging from Engels to Whitehead. Once "mind" has been taken out of "nature" at least two mysteries must grow where one grew before. Once the scientist has been isolated from humanity at least twice as many cloaks for scoundrels may be found than there were before. Another way in which science frequently receives an irreversible isolation is when it is thought of in terms of its results. What is in the annals of science, on the shelves of the library, is said to be the only science. It need not be consulted by anyone in particular, not even by scientists. It stands there alone in its austere beauty. If revisions or additions are introduced by the perversity of a haphazard progress, these themselves achieve this impersonal grandeur. Such science hates to be "applied", because thereby it runs the dangers of tests far more severe than the self-imposed ones of a smug methodology. A static theory eyes dynamic practice as the enemy of enemies. And every theory likes to think of itself as immortal. Philosophers must introduce distinctions, but they are not generally in the habit of reminding others and even themselves that they are "merely" distinctions for some specific purpose. Like others, if I am to be an analytical thinker, I create dichoto- mies. I divide life, for example, into work and play. I must remember, however, that I have done this only for a certain convenience. Should I forget, I might be arguing after a while that science, which might fall under the head of work, can have nothing to say about play. My mistake would lie in trans- forming the complementary pair, "work" and "play", into con-</page><page sequence="4">130 Virtue and the Scientist tradictories. Similarly, to continue with the example, my dichotomy under "work" is "action" and "contemplation". Under "action" I might list the serious activities of political action and the like; under "contemplation" I might include "science" and "philosophy". Again, if I forget the comple- mentarity I intended between, let us say, "science" and "action", I shall fall into the false assertions that one cannot act on a scientific basis or be scientific about action.l There are, of course, actions nearly devoid of any reasonable scientific basis, and scientific matters-of-course almost free from the decisions of action, but these extremes show all the more the necessity of preventing a complete break. Reconciliation, and not divorce, is the remedy. Science, as L. A. White2 has said so aptly, is sciencing. It is itself action of a certain kind. The fallacy of setting up a contradiction between science and action has some curious offspring and other relatives. They can all be lumped under what is often mislabeled as "the social implications of science".3 The dubious contributions which are served to us under this head divide roughly into (I) disclaimers that there is any issue in the question, (2) all sorts of charges of villainy against science and (3) all sorts of eulogies to the benefi- cent contributions of science. These deserve a brief discussion before I go on to my positive data for the assertion that in the practice of science lies the key to virtue. The disclaimers that there is any issue to the question of the 1 Those who wish to treat "science" and "action" as true opposites and seriously con- sider action unscientific, may, if they wish, conclude that science-in-action (e.g. scien- tific research) is unscientific! Or, I am afraid, they will have to deny the existence of research. I think they will compromise and say that there is nothing but chance in scientific research and that there's no more reason to expect truth or error in the choices taken by a research investigator. They will try to show that scientific research or prog- ress is an illusion, because it is based on irrational (unscientific!) action. 2 L. A. White, Philosophy of Science, Vol. 5, pp. 369-89 (1938). 3 The expression "social implications of science" is technically inaccurate and other- wise inadequate to describe the situation that is meant. "Implication" is a logical term used in such expressions as "A implies B". Such a rigid, necessary connection cannot exist between a scientific discovery and its social uses or abuses, which may receive no realization altogether. All that can be meant is that there is some kind of mutual inter- action between social conditions and scientific activity.</page><page sequence="5">W. M. Malisoff I 3 social responsibility of science are based principally on the rewarming of the old notion that a scientist need not concern himself with the application or practical meaning of his discovery at all. "Free" inquiry is interpreted to mean freedom from the requirement of the kind of test in practice which comes with "applications". The advocates of this view of freedom do not see that there is actually a possibility of the obstruction of progress by limiting the nature of verification to the circle of theoretical- experimental operations set up by some specific theory. They do not realize that "applications" are verifications or confirmations as important as any. Their truths shun their severest test where contexts cannot be bribed, so-to-speak. Grant to such people this dangerous assumption of the "freedom" of pure science, and their argument becomes simple. They will say: "Do not blame us for machine-guns, overproduction, anything. As 'pure' scientists (!) we are not concerned with applications". Strange, they may be right that one should not blame science, but they give the wrong reason. They admit that science is as impartial as a tool. Anyone may use it as he pleases for better or for worse. One can, thus, easily convert a tool into a weapon. Alas, this is true about certain of the results of science, but science is an activity, i.e. something much more than its results, and, as such cannot shake off social responsibility or involvement of a moral character. It is true that there is no use in raging against a tool, but science is not a mere tool. If science be a mere tool, both charges of villainy and eulogies are only transfers of epithet. My "good knife" and "the bad knife" that cut me, are what they are only by virtue of my petulance or my enthusiasm. On the other hand, if science is functionally integral with social activity, then it is involved in the ethical appraisal of all social activity. The charges, however, continue against science as a "cause" of social disruption, even when the critics realize that science is not a blind tool. What such critics have in mind are the tremendous economic effects of scientific progress, which, in spite of the pro- tests of "pure" scientists, comes along with a full quota of applications. They will grant that economic changes in turn</page><page sequence="6">132 Virtue and the Scientist affect science. The relation, I hope they will admit, is functional. They will, therefore, even drop loose talk about "causes". (Somehow, you see, we feel we can scold a "cause".) With the elimination of a too one-sided, anthropomorphic use of the term cause, we can hope that the scolding will stop. Once the scolding about inventions, cold impersonal laws and the like, is waved aside as irrelevant to the issue of the ethical involvement of science, we can turn to the definite message of this contribution: in the practice of science lies the key to virtue. Inventions can be used as tools for better or for worse. "Pure" laws of science, e.g. the law of gravitation are indifferent to their use by scoundrels or by saints. Actual living scientists may be the dupes of evil men or the collaborators of great statesmen. But, I maintain, the method of science (its true and full practice) lends itself only to virtue. It does separate the sheep from goats, the virtuous from the vicious. Consider a scientist who has decided to lie in recording his observations. I mean that he has decided to lie effectively, with no guile that would enable him to substitute words and get back to the truth again. He may record "black" whenever he sees "white" and vice versa, and thus be able to translate his record into a genuine one. Such masking is not lying and may be practiced only as a code. Suppose that he is genuinely lying and that instead of "black" he occasionally records "yellow" or "pink" or "pleasant" or "worth a dollar", as the spirit moves him. What are his chances of making a genuine discovery? They are very small indeed. They are "nil" for all practical purposes, even if formally one can occasionally deduce a truth from a chain of well-adjusted lies or by sheer accident of balancing errors arrive at a true inductive conclusion. A scientist bent on discovery cannot risk lying. Deliberate lying is immoral in the context of scientific behavior because it completely, or almost completely, disrupts that behavior. Consider a scientist who fails to make a discovery from his data. He finds it necessary to re-examine his data. His first suspicion is that he might have misrecorded an observation or made a malobservation. He repeats observations in order to check up on a possible unconscious lie. The experienced observer</page><page sequence="7">W. M. Malisoff 33 knows how vulnerable scientific work is at that point. He is far from being in love with mere data gathering. He knows that the data, however, will betray him more effectively than anything else. The neglect of unconscious lying is immoral in the context of scientific behavior, because it may seriously or com- pletely disrupt that behavior. Failure to check observations or to allow for systematic error is a form of immoral behavior. It is not amoral, since it has serious moral consequences. Measuring, which properly should be done with a full technique of checking on the possibilities of self deception, is often described as amoral, as unconcerned with virtue. On the contrary, proper technique in measuring is a highly moral act. It discriminates emphatically between truth- telling and lying. It even involves resolves and high courage to adjust observations to the widest experiences of humanity with regard to error. The choice of the principle of least squares, for instance, is a heavy moral responsibility for the scientist as a truth-telling reporter. He even has the further responsibility as a philosopher of science to examine rival moral principles concerning the adjustment of observations, and may worry himself into repentance over the choice of a wrong principle, wrong because it breaks on the rocks of experience. The stupidity (evil) of lying is brought out most clearly by the scientist's conduct in the gathering and in the adjustment of observations. We know also that no matter how careful we have been there are "residual errors", that is, errors for which adjustment can be made only as theory evolves. New material of experience may have a different tale to tell. A larger context will revealwhat has been called a "constant error". We are not through with moral responsibility. The moral responsibility of a scientist in the first place, therefore, is not to be dogmatic, i.e. to know that he does not know all. In the second place, he is bound to seek new experience and to expand his horizon. All this he must do in order to eliminate the more secret strongholds of error. The elusiveness of fact dictates this morality. Research for greater generality is a moral obligation. The search for lurking error leads one on and on to the examina-</page><page sequence="8">I34. Virtue and the Scientist tion of the fundamentals and the presuppositions of the sciences individually and collectively. This is a tremendously long-range project and furnishes moral propulsion sufficient to satisfy the hungriest of idealistic souls. The realm of ignorance seems sufficiently inexhaustible to satisfy the crusading of the most infinity-loving moralist. The rewards of knowledge and of understanding can nonetheless keep piling up. Morality can thus thrive endlessly on receding ignorance. The scientist's neverending search for truth is true to Socrates' doctrine that the only evil is ignorance. Consider now a scientist who wants to isolate his activity from the similar activities of other scientists and from the activities of his fellow men. Such a Robinson Crusoe can have his natural island but no savages, and surely no Man Friday. It must be admitted that he could carry on something that could be con- sidered faintly scientific and that only in a narrow sense. He could note to himself perhaps a little more than if he were a lone wolf on an island. He is a human being after all. For a proper test of his isolation, however, I failed to insist above, he should have been brought to the island at birth, or mercifully, a little later. Crusoe, it must be remembered, had a good social past. Our hypothetical scientist, too, was permitted to reach the island in a high state of civilization, a more or less complete social being. He would keep on doing something resembling the scientific on the funded knowledge of his past. He would not be strictly isolated. He would be merely an ingrate or a renegade to his past, and he would surely deteriorate as time went on, or would miss the advantages of collective action and means in the pursuit of knowledge. Were another younger being to arrive at his island he would have to train him, tell him at least about what he had discovered, and would thus become "social". In the pursuit of knowledge total isolation, genuine isolation at the very start from all social influence, would reduce inherited knowledge to a zero. A discussion of partial isolation would also yield the point that science must be social. For, if it were to be argued that our social inheritance is full of error, isolation of some sort might then do good, but it would have to be isolation from social error, and not isolation from social knowledge.</page><page sequence="9">W. M. Malisoff 135 Socially accumulated knowledge is the repository of moral worth because it is immeasurably greater than any knowledge an individual can discover without a society. A society is also needed for the optimum performance of the highly moral act of verification or confirmation. The scientist who realizes the social nature of his truth-seeking enterprise is obligated, therefore, to act so that the sum total of knowledge is increased. His moral functions include first and foremost the devising of languages that will be understood by all his fellow scientists and in a broader way by all those whose morals rise to the search for truth. I know of nothing more democratic than arithmetic. Nor is there anything more moral. It is a universal language, and it demonstrates the virtues of democracy, human brotherhood and the genuine liberation of knowledge. So taken the law of gravitation is also eloquent of the democratic virtues. Every harmony it discovers in the stars suggests the harmony that the method of its discovery shows to be possible in the behavior of men. Let us select yet another scientist who perversely might insist that he would still run counter to morals by working only for himself. Suppose he were to try to lengthen his own life by one year. He would quickly find that he would need help. He would need the libraries of the world, the past efforts of thousands of men each of whom depended on the thousands before them. He would need laboratories. These would have to be built. He would need materials, assistants. These could not come from the thin air or without intense human effort. He would need the entire paraphernalia of civilization, the teachers, the doctors, yea the artists. He would need everyone in order to accomplish what he conceived to be a merely selfish act. He would have to keep everyone going. And, thus, selfishness would turn willy-nilly to altruism in the intelligent pursuit of its aim. Such is the moral fibre of scientific acitivity. It is time to repeat: in the practice of science lies the key to virtue. Examples have been taken by me from the practice of science when it is on its best behavior. My thesis is that it can serve</page><page sequence="10">136 Virtue and the Scientist as a model for all behavior. It amounts to a proposal that we model our general ethics on the ethics of research. I have not stopped to discuss the numerous meanings of "virtue", not that it may not be of interest or even of some profit to list the virtues and opinion about the virtues, but because I wish to leave the definition of virtue as an open research problem. I hope that the more we learn about successful scientific procedure the closer we will get to a characterization of virtuous conduct. Only an ethics of science, I believe, can harmonize fact and value. Polytechnic Institute, Brooklyn, N. r.</page></plain_text>
