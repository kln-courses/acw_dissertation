<plain_text><page sequence="1">Some Poems of Robert Frost A more appropriate title for my presentation might be "Three Ways of Trying to See the Real Robert Frost." If there is one thing that is clear from the evidence, it is the difficulty of pigeonholing this remarkable poet, and no one ever knew this with more certainty than the poet himself, who, throughout his life, was aware not only of his own masks but of the diverse meanings and myths that would accrue to his life and to his work. "Check up on me some," was his constant admonition to those who sought the real Frost. And the existence today of dozens of splendid articles and books, many of them at loggerheads, attests to the difficulty of finding him, though the attempt to do it is so beguiling that one feels the effort to be worth any expenditure of time or effort. The first of three approaches that I have found useful is the thematic approach, that is, an approach that focuses on Frost's preoccupation with contraries, oppositions, and dualities. Lawrance Thompson was probably the first to point out the many ways in which Frost's life and work exemplified contraries.1 An extension of this idea would be Frost's emphasis on choices between equally attractive possibilities and on the posing of two sets of principles or two people or two objects. Choice and the reconciling of oppositions form a major theme in Frost's poetry, for reasons that will be made clear as we proceed. A second approach concerns Frost's attitude toward life, or more specifically "what to make of a diminished thing." For this approach I draw on his sonnet "The Oven Bird," quoted below: THE OVEN BIRD There is a singer everyone has heard, Loud, a mid-summer and a mid-wood bird, Who makes the solid tree trunks sound again. He says that leaves are old and that for flowers Mid-summer is to spring as one to ten. He says the early petal-fall is past When pear and cherry bloom went down in showers On sunny days a moment overcast; And comes that other fall we name the fall. He says the highway dust is over all. The bird would cease and be as other birds But that he knows in singing not to sing. The question that he frames in all but words Is what to make of a diminished thing. An oven bird is a small New England bird with a harsh, strident, penetrating voice. He is called oven bird because of the mound-shaped nest he builds on the ground. He is also called a teacher bird (not because of his obstreperousness!) but because his voice makes the sound "tea-cher." What the little bird teaches the poet is to sing without singing. That is, to recognize the demise of the season, the encroaching of highways on his domain, and the approach of winter without calmly accepting all of this change and diminution, but instead protesting as loudly as possible, even though it will not alter things. What to make of a diminished thing is Frost's way of referring to the stance we 19</page><page sequence="2">make in the presence of loss, change, and death. We can weep about it, we can sing songs of melancholy, we can ignore it, we can accept it, or we can follow the teacher bird and raise our voices to the level of protest in a kind of song that is not quite song in the usual sense, but which asserts our intransigence, independence, and originality. In most of his poems, then, Frost's stance or attitude toward change and diminution becomes a vital way of understanding the real Frost. It is a changing attitude, as we might expect, and if in such a poem as "Out, Out" his attitude is the stoical shrug of the shoulders when he learns of the cutting off of a young boy's hand, the attitude in "Oven Bird" is to protest against a scheme of things that makes change and loss a necessity. A third way to try to understand Robert Frost is by way of the fine biographical studies that are listed in my annotated bibliography. The New Critics have warned us against the extreme use of biographical and historical materials in the study of literature, though in fairness to most of them they really did not mean for us to ignore such materials. Their emphasis was on the text of the poem or story—on textual analysis. Such an approach is obviously a fruitful one, and most of us will agree that the use of history and biography should not be avoided, if what we are looking for is illumination of the literature. In any case, one of the best means of coming to grips with the poetry of Robert Frost is to read an account of his life and times. In Frost's case, perhaps more than in that of other modern writers, we need the biographical facts to avoid the kind of favorable distortions that will canonize a man who did not by any stretch of the imagination think of himself as a saint. Biography can be useful, not only by satisfying our innate love for gossip, but also by displaying the artist's essential humanity, thereby circumventing our tendency to immortalize the mortal. Let us take, for example, a few biographical facts about a literary figure whose name I shall ask you to guess. Whom do these facts suggest to you? He had an uncontrollable temper, he was vengeful, he was often consumed by hatred for people or situations, and he frequently threatened to kill himself or others when things did not go his way. He once said, "I take it that no man is educated who has not dallied with the thought of suicide." He was a college dropout, and could not hold a job. When he won a medal for academic achievement in high school, he hocked it because it represented the Establishment, for which he held an idealistic scorn. When his fiancee rebuffed him, he attempted suicide. He was arrested and fined for blacking a stranger's eye. He threatened to murder his wife. When his four-year old son died, he blamed himself until his wife convinced him it was the work of a malevolent universe-that there was no God. His sister became mentally ill and was hospitalized; his only son committed suicide; his daughter was hospitalized as an invalid; when his wife died, he whose favorite drink was ginger ale, "accepted any drink that was offered." Do you know him? Are the details familiar? If not, you have not read Lawrance Thompson's recent biography (the first of two volumes) of Robert Frost. Every detail above is borne out by biographical information. Granted I emphasized some of the more unpleasant aspects of Frost's life. I could have done the same with the happier episodes, but I think that too often we use either the pleasant or unpleasant aspects of a writer's life for the wrong reasons—either to condemn or to canonize, and I hope that my presentation today will create in you a desire to pursue the truth about Robert Frost so that you can answer candidly the 20</page><page sequence="3">questions that might be raised by your students about the poet. The value of the man's poetry cannot be questioned. And who is to say about the events of his life? They illuminate the man, and, indirectly perhaps, much of his art. Moreover, the facts of his life will dispel once and for all the stereotype that was becoming the final truth about Frost in the minds of the masses. I refer to the stereotype we all shared, because we had nothing more to go on than occasional rumors, many of these prompted by the poet himself. Such a picture was that of a genial, witty, white-haired, kindly old rustic from New England, whittling birch twigs while he sat on a keg of maple syrup delivering philosophical maxims. Though this is obviously exaggerated, it nonetheless fits the picture held by many of our contemporaries, and it is patently a distortion. The real Frost you should try to limn for yourself from the various sources and approaches at your disposal. We have, then, three approaches to a clearer understanding of the poet: (1) the dualisms in his pattern of thinking and writing; (2) his attempts to find a means to respond to the fact of change, diminution, and death; and (3) the uses of biography to clarify, to add interest, and to give completeness to our view of Robert Frost. Let us now go to the poems in your textbook and apply some of these approaches. Let me warn you in advance that I doubt that I can shed any new light on such familiar anthology pieces. Surely "Mending Wall" has had about all the explication it can support. The only problem I find is the question of whether the speaker wants the wall to stand or not. Early interpreters thought Frost wanted the wall down, and the editors of your manual apparently thought so, too. The usual interpretation is that with the wall down, the speaker and his neighbor could then live in peace and harmony. Walls are for cattle, not people; let oneness reign. But this interpretation has been subject to question in recent years. Louis Untermeyer, using biographical material, has this to say: He is still against One World, World Federalism, Universal Brotherhood, unity, conformity, the breaking down of barriers in the interest of Oneness; he is unalterably against One Anything. You may quote him to the effect that "Something there is that doesn't love a wall," but you can be sure that he much prefers the opposed quotation that "Good fences make good neighbors." He insists on Nature's divisions and differences; "in art, as in nature, we want all the differences we can get. In society, too. We want people and nations to maintain their differences-even at the risk "of fighting one another. Thus you have another of Frost's intriguing dualisms, or, if you will, ambiguities. Yvor Winters accused Frost of being a spiritual drifter, because it seemed to Winters that Frost left too many questions unresolved.3 Personally I do not think that there is an unresolved question here. You have two men, one on either side of the wall, and two opposed ways of viewing the diminished thing—the rock fence that needed repairing. The tension between the two oppositions is what gives the poem its energy. If there is ambiguity in the speaker's stand, it becomes resolved by his attitude toward his neighbor, an attitude that is unequivocal: he disapproves of the neighbor's unquestioning faith in his father's notion that good fences make good neighbors. The speaker (Frost) wishes the neighbor would reason this matter out for himself. This, I think, is the central idea of the 21</page><page sequence="4">poem: that Frost does not care whether or not there are fences between people, but he would prefer that individuals back up their thinking with logic. He would like a bit more independence. It is not beside the point that two of Frost's favorite books were Robinson Crusoe and Walden, books dealing with individuality and self-reliance. To corroborate my notion about Frost's stance in the poem, permit me to use biography again. Frost once said of this poem, "I played exactly fair in it. Twice I say 'Good fences make good neighbors; and twice 'Something there is that doesn't love a wall.' "4 The intentional fallacy aside, Frost's comment helps us to see the drift of his thinking by forcing us to examine the text a bit more closely. "Birches" is another anthology piece that prompts me to question my ability to say anything that you have not heard before. Frost was fascinated by trees his whole life long, trees and forests. In the many poems dealing with trees and forests we can detect the unmistakable ambivalence of attraction-repulsion. He once attempted to lose himself in the Dismal Swamp of Virginia, after an argument with Elinor White.5 He believed that he wanted to be swallowed up by the wilderness. When he was at Dartmouth he made frequent walks through the forests that surround Hanover, many of these sojourns being nocturnal ones. So frequent, in fact, were his walks through the forests that a number of his classmates accused him of being antisocial. A delegation of them once demanded to know what he did on these long walks in the woods, alone. Replied Frost, "I gnaw wood."6 Trees and forests, then, are frequent backdrops for some of his most successful poems, and critics have given much attention to the poet's symbolic use of such material. Malcolm Cowley, for example, believes that woods and trees and forests are Frost's symbol for the "uncharted country within ourselves, full of possible beauty, but also full of terror."7 "Birches," however, seems to be a poem in which the subject is handled without the undercurrent of brooding melancholy that we often find. It is a poem, in fact, which should give your students an intriguing symbol to work with—birch-swinging. When Frost wrote the poem, he was in England attempting to get his first volume of poetry published. He tells us that homesickness prompted the writing of "Birches." It is interesting that his loneliness and nostalgia should have found release in the image of birch-swinging, an activity that we would probably reserve for youngsters rather than a man nearly forty years of age. But the symbol is a good one, for do not all of us occasionally long to escape to the activities of our youth? Birch-swinging, then, becomes kite-flying (my particular hang-up) or playing with electric trains or jumping the rope or reading comic books or playing touch football. One could do worse than assign a theme on this subject. For your advanced placement students there is an interesting literary problem in the poem. Frost told Cleanth Brooks and Robert Penn Warren that "Birches" is "two fragments soldered together so long ago I have forgotten where the joint is."8 Where might the joint be? My guess is between line 42 and 43. My emphasis when I teach the poem is on birch-swinging as a symbol for a kind of poetry Frost wrote when reality hung too heavily on his spirit—light, fanciful, witty, chatty poetry, such as some of the poems in New Hampshire, or a poem like "The 22</page><page sequence="5">Telephone." I see "Birches," then, as a reflexive poem, a poem about writing poetry, about the stances one can take when he tires of too much reality or too little reality; in other words, a reply to change and diminution. When the going is rough, the poet swings toward the romantic realm, though he does not want to stay there for long, just as he is not yet ready to leave the present life. His total commitment to the earth and to fact of change and diminution is apparent in his lines ...Earth's the right place for love: I don't know where it's likely to go better. The more disordered life became for Frost, the more he turned to the order-making process of creating poetry. "Fire and Ice" is one of many contemporary poems about the ultimate destruction of the world. One thinks of MacLeish's sonnet "The End of the World" in which life is compared to a circus, and earth's inhabitants to circus performers. Just as a dramatic event is about to occur in the performance, there is a gigantic explosion, and up goes the tent, performers included, leaving "nothing, nothing—nothing at all." And then there is T. S. Eliot's familiar pronouncement at the end of "The hollow Men": This is the way the world ends Not with a bang but a whimper. Frost's little poem may be compared profitably with the other two: FIRE AND ICE Some say the world will end in fire, Some say in ice. From what I've tasted of desire I hold with those who favor fire. But if it had to perish twice, I think I know enough of hate To say that for destruction ice Is also great And would suffice. It is the tone of Frost's poem that marks it as his own and makes it so different from other end-of-the-world poems. For example, remove the first two words in the poem, "Some say," and you have the voice of Jeremiah, an alarmed Jeremiah: "The world will end in fire." But the existence of the words is characteristic of Frost's mild, informal, almost casual objectivity, as though he were talking about various rumors concerning the state of the weather. It is this mild tone that pervades the poem and works against the devastating idea conveyed by the words. In the tension between the speaker's calm tone and his world-shattering subject you have the essential irony of the poem, an irony that builds to the final word of the poem, "suffice." Is there a more ominous understatement in modern poetry? To say that ice would suffice for our destruction is almost to parody the silliness and glibness of modern advertising and the understatements used by the press 23</page><page sequence="6">and the military. With what monumental calm we speak of the devastating effect of nuclear warheads, the probability of X number of soldiers to be killed in a given battle, or the enemy casualties as compared to our own. Frost's language mocks our feelingless manipulation of symbols of communication. You will note that the poem works with two oppositions—fire and ice, and that Frost is dealing with the idea of a diminished thing—the universe. His stance here is not unlike his stance elsewhere, because the same casual and cryptic conclusion is reached: namely, that whether fire or ice herald the end of the world, man will probably bring it on, and the reader can take his choice as to which end is worse. In one of his poems W. H. Auden stated that we must learn to love each other or die. Frost is saying something like that here, but he is saying it far more subtly. If man's wisdom and advanced technology can come up with nothing better than hate or desire as his contribution to progress, he does not deserve much of a world, Frost seems to be saying. Hate will indeed suffice if we cannot create more productive values. So fraught with symbolical overtones are fire and ice that your students may want to suggest some of the possibilities for each. For fire they will almost certainly mention the atomic bomb (and your discussion of this symbol will carry the same ironic overtones that the poem has) or perhaps the fire and brimstone of the Christian idea of Hell. Your manual suggests several interesting possibilities for both fire and ice. If one wished to push the biographical possibilities here, he could mention the instances in which Frost's world seemed to come to an end with fire or ice. These are recorded in Professor Lawrance's fine biography of Frost. Frost once watched his fiancee throw his engagement ring into the fire after a bitter argument. The effect on Frost was devastating, because his desire for Elinor White's hand in marriage was at that time compelling. Or we might mention his thoughts of taking his own life by drowning in the frozen lake near his home in Derry, the lake, according to family legend, that is mentioned in "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening." The biographical approach to this poem is more hazardous to utilize than other approaches, but to the student familiar with such material, speculation can be intriguing. "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening" is regarded by most critics as one of the finest lyrics in the English language. I would agree with their assessment. It seems almost a sacrilege to think otherwise. Mr. Ciardi and others have explicated and speculated about the poem's meaning and inception, leaving for the rest of us nothing but what Frost intended in the first place-admiration. I must disagree with the suggestions offered in your manual, and this is one of the few disagreements I have with the really splendid set of notes, questions, and ideas about the literature in your textbook. Your editor apparently feels that there is nothing in the poem about a death wish. On the contrary, I think that is what the poem is about: the opposition between immobility (sleep, indolence, death) and the thrust of action (work, duty, life). As you know, the speaker is entranced by both alternatives, but elects the latter course, because this is one time when the demands of duty supersede any other personal needs. Even a casual reading of the biographical materials available on Frost will convince the reader of a sombre, gloomy, brooding, often pessimistic streak in the poet's nature. In his poetry this bent never 24</page><page sequence="7">emerges as abject melancholy or morbid sadness. He was too much the artist to permit such moods to come through directly into his poetry. But his periodic bouts with despair could not be sublimated completely, and we have in his work some of the finest lyrics in the English language dealing with the darker side of existence. The poem under discussion is certainly not a poem of gloom, but there is a wistful, quietly brooding quality in it that emerges not quite as a victory for joy as much as a recognition of the presence of death in life, or the possibility of death, or the momentary desire all of us have for release when we are tired or harried or fearful of the future. Then, of course, we have in the language and structure of the poem many oppositions: village—country; animal-man; dark woods-white snow; the contemplation of life—the contemplation of non-life; the sound of the harness bells—the silence of the forest. The latter is an interesting juxtaposition. Though not quite equivalent to the knocking at the gate in Macbeth, it introduces a sound that is symbolic of domesticity, cheer, normality, etc. But the jingling of harness bells is also charged with irony, because the rider has to be reminded by his beast that life is to be preferred over death. "Desert Places" is one of the most sombre expressions of loneliness, desperation, and the perception of nothingness that one can read. Place it beside Wallace Stevens' "The Snow Man" and you have poetry enough to warm the heart of the coldest existentialist. It is a poem, you will remember, about the speaker moving through a forest that is rapidly filling with snow. There is no sign of life. Even the animals are absent, and the poet feels that nature has somehow included him in all of this expressionless blankness. "I am too absent-spirited to count," he says. "The loneliness includes me unawares." It is a bleak, bleak picture of the nothingness of existence and of the moods that nature can put us in. Life appears at an end, and the possibility of another ice age seems certain. At this point the speaker considers the pronouncements of Science, to the effect that there are vast uncharted spaces between the stars, as well as stars in which there is no life present. Such a thought, however, does not frighten or even impress the speaker: he is vastly more terrified by the lonely reaches of space on his own star and within his own consciousness. He has his own desert places. The feminine rhyme in the last stanza seems ludicrous, and, at first glance, out of place. My guess is that it is Frost's way of ridiculing Science's solemn pronouncements about the vastness and emptiness of the universe. It is as though Frost were saying that Science ought to know better than to frighten laymen with such abstract concepts as the space-time continuum. Such observations are like nursery rhymes when compared to man's built-in capacity for the perception of loneliness, isolation, and death. It is well for students to see all sides of a poet's temperament, and with that in mind, I stenciled Frost's poem "Come In," a selection not included in your textbook: COME IN As I came to the edge of the woods, Thrush music-hark! Now if it was dusk outside, Inside it was dark. 25</page><page sequence="8">Too dark in the woods for a bird By sleight of wing To better its perch for the night, Though it still could sing. The last of the light of the sun That had died in the west Still lived for one song more In a thrush's breast. Far in the pillared dark Thrush music went— Almost like a call to come in To the dark and lament. But no, I was out for stars: I would not come in. 1 meant not even if asked, And I hadn't been. This poem is especially appropriate at this point in our discussion because it deals with material similar to what we encountered in "Stopping by Woods" and "Desert Places," that is, the dark appeal of the forest to the poet. In this poem, however, the speaker can contemplate the woods without terror or gloom, because even though he seems urged to "come in/To the dark and lament," he is able to refuse. His reason is simple: he "was out for stars." Note that stars in this context do not convey the same dread we found in "Desert Places." Here they are traditional romantic symbols associated with the speaker's sense of well-being and buoyancy. Both woods and stars, then, can hold terror or calm for the poet, depending upon his mood. And our students should see both moods. Let me digress a moment to say a word in favor of well-made poems of cynicism, world-weariness, disillusionment, and pain. Older students should no more be denied reading poems on such themes than they should be denied reading hopeful, "inspirational" poems, if the poems are superior works of literature. The point I wish to make here is that we should expose our students to the literature that our trained intelligence and critical acumen tell us is good literature, regardless of its optimism or pessimism. I am not really certain that there is such a thing as a completely pessimistic piece of literature anyhow. In a well-made piece of literature dealing with, say, the futility of existence, the images and patterns themselves are a tacit denial of futility, for they embody beauty and art and are in themselves a very good excuse for being. Frost learned to make exceedingly good poems out of the material of his pain, and we have already seen some of these. But he also made good poems out of the material of his joy, and we have seen some of these, too. Whatever the subject matter, the poet is forming his verses from his moods, and we must, I think, teach the darker poems with as much fervency as we bestow upon the happier ones. This is not difficult to do when we consider that the very act of writing a poem is a declaration of the writer's faith in the power and importance of his metaphors and images—whether these be images of affirmation or negation. All of his life Frost asked questions about the meaning of life. Was there design in the universe? Did man have a purpose? Was there a creator? If so, was He benign, 26</page><page sequence="9">malevolent, or indifferent? Torn between his mother's religious affirmations and his father's refusal to accept organized religion, Frost vacillated between various degrees of belief and unbelief much of his life, this tension showing plainly in many of his poems. One of the strategies in his poetry was the setting up of these two oppositions and working toward some reconciliation of them. Thus we have another of the many dualisms in his life and work. "Design" is considered by many readers to be one of Frost's most terrifying poems. His technique here, as in "Fire and Ice" is to juxtapose the homely with the horrible. The white spider, for example, is "dimpled" and "fat," almost like a cherubic baby. The dead wings of the moth it has captured are like a boy's "paper kite." The combination of the spider, moth, and heal-all (by nature a blue flower, but in this poem an albino) form a frightening combination of "assorted characters of death and blight/Mixed ready to begin the morning right." Frost's casual tone, coupled with this grim and unlikely assemblage, provides the principle energy of the poem. The poet seems to feel that there is far too much whiteness gathered here for it to be accidental. The conclusion that all of this was designed by a Designer with dark intentions appears unmistakable—of if not dark intentions, a macabre sense of humor. The biographical evidence helps with the problem of Frost's stance in this poem. An earlier version of the poem had been entitled "In White," and Lawrance Thompson says that in revising the original, Frost achieved one of his finest ironies by parodying William Cullen Bryant's "To A Waterfowl," a poem Frost had memorized when he was quite young. That poem ended on a prayerful note, with the speaker asking that his life be given the same guidance that was given the waterfowl whose flying appeared so purposeful and planned. Thompson believes that Frost was not really convinced that the coincidences proved that the Designer was evil. Writes Thompson: Frost, habitually the prey to dark moods which temporarily upset his religious affirmations, was perfectly capable of understanding-and even of sympathizing with-the possibility that his little study in white could be interpreted as being akin to Melville's very bitter chapter "The Whiteness of the Whale," in Moby-Dick. But Melville enjoyed the agony of luxuriating in blasphemous negations and Frost never did. Instead, he so desperately needed the consolation of positive religious belief that he was never long without it. Although he could briefly and intermittently entertain the notion that the Designer might be evil, he preferred to manipulate the notion in a detached way to tease and mock those whose religious beliefs seemed to him to be sentimental. Even in teasing, however, he still very firmly agreed with James and Bergson...that all the important purposes of the Designer are benevolent.9 Thus we have some of the biographical evidence and Thompson's view. Both are helpful, though we still have the text of the poem to consider. The poem may well be a parody of the sentimental attitude of religionists toward the Deity. It may also be akin to Blake's view of the creator of the lamb and the tiger-an admiration for the kind of mind that could dare to conceive of such contraries. The poem certainly deals with the mind of the Designer, not whether a Designer exists or not. My own feeling about the poem is that Frost has an anthropomorphic conception of God in this poem—that he is attributing man's (Frost's) own patterns of behavior to God. He sometimes sees God as malevolent, 27</page><page sequence="10">sometimes as benevolent, sometimes as capricious, and always as tricky. 1 use the word advisedly, because it is a term Frost himself would have used to refer to his own brand of subterfuge, caginess, posturing, and teasing. Take, for example, line four: "Assorted characters of death and blight." The use here of "characters" suggests a play, a little drama for our amusement. And this is followed in line five by "Mixed ready to begin the morning right." What could be more like the jargon of Madison Avenue. "Let's get the morning going right, folks, by having a little mixture of the macabre in our breakfast cereal." The poet-speaker has set all of this up as though he were a Stage-Manager preparing something for our amusement. When we come to the sestet, the speaker comes to the front of the stage and addresses the audience directly: How did all of these white things get together at the very same moment? Was it to scare us? Or does Deity give his attention to such trivial things? (This last question is probably better understood if applied, not to Bryant's "The Waterfowl" but to the popular hymn which notes that "His eye is on the sparrow.") As in "The Oven Bird" the answer to the questions is implied in the execution of the sonnet. There can be the appearance of design in the most extraordinary accident, and the appearance of accident or coincidence in the most intricately contrived pattern. If we think the whiteness is accidental, we are wrong. If we think it is planned, we are wrong, too. We are wrong in both cases because we have no way of knowing for certain. Later, Frost was to put this idea in a couplet: We dance round in a ring and suppose, But the secret sits in the middle and knows.10 This is a fair statement, I think, of Frost's ambiguous concluding lines to the poem. There is less design in the universe than the religionist notes, and more design than the unbeliever can find. Frost likes to think of himself as somewhat like God, sitting in the middle of the ring knowing what he meant in his creation's, but not giving out a complete body of information, only hints. The very form of the poem helps us with this point: the poem begins as an Italian sonnet, but instead of introducing a new rhyme in the sestet, Frost continues with the "a" rhyme three more times. The final line likewise fails to conform to the iambic pentameter pattern that is the customary feature of the sonnet design. Thus, there is both design and the absence of it in the poem, and only the poet could really tell you to what extent this was intentional or accidental. He may be ridiculing religionists in the poem, but he is also ridiculing those who ridicule religionists. To Frost, life consisted of a series of advances and retreats, of contractions and expansions, of a moving into the dark, and then into the light. He saw this kind of duality as a natural response to life, as natural as inhaling and exhaling. You will remember that in "Birches" Frost had wanted to swing upward toward heaven and then back to earth again. Men need this kind of retreat and advance, he believed, in order to function well in the midst of diminishing things. "In Winter in the Woods Alone" belongs to his last volume of poetry, and is a fine example of the principle of retreating and advancing for the sake of one's well being. 28</page><page sequence="11">IN WINTER IN THE WOODS ALONE In winter in the woods alone Against the trees I go. I mark a maple for my own And lay the maple low. At four o'clock I shoulder axe And in the afterglow I link a line of shadowy tracks Across the tinted snow. 1 see for Nature no defeat In one tree's overthrow Or for myself in my retreat For yet another blow. Note that the poem deals with the poet in the woods alone, cutting a tree and then leaving the scene. Structurally the poem reinforces the idea of advancing and retreating. The rhymes advance and retreat: abab; cbcb; dbdb. The "b" rhyme keeps returning, just as the woodsman renews himself for the felling of another tree and the forest renews itself for the production of new timber. Note, too, that the length of the lines expands and contracts. The very rhythm of life comes from such advancing and retreating. Frost was accused by a professor once of using in line eleven the word "retreat" simply because it rhymed with "defeat." Frost was annoyed at this suggestion and commented as follows: We retreat; we don't escape. That's a word I loathe, you know, "escape." But "retreat" is a sort of characteristic word to me, that you retreat for strength. Church touches that, you know. They're not brought up in the religion if they don't know what retreat is. You don't escape, you withdraw with God. With sleep.11 This is a good poem with which to conclude my discussion. It has the organic twoness we spoke of earlier—advance and retreat. It speaks of what to make of a diminished thing: diminution of the forest, when practiced temperately, permits a healthier expansion. And we have made use of biographical material to shed light on the poem's meaning. And now I will retreat. Not escape, not give up, for I have miles to read (of term papers) before I sleep. I hope to arm myself for yet another blow. I only trust that I have not laid you too low, and that from this experience you will be better equipped for the advances and retreats of teaching literature to young people. Remember that you do not shoulder axe entirely alone—there are other woodsmen about. But let me stop here lest I carry this analogy too far and start referring to our students as blockheads or our colleagues as hatchet-men.
