<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Egghead Waits for Godot Heinz Politzer An egghead or ovicephalos is merely another word for an intellectual, as Professor Manning explained here in Chapel last year. According to his definition an intellectual is "a man who thinks; thinking is his hallmark." Oberlin for instance prides itself on being an incubator of eggheads. Waiting for Godot is a tragicomedy in two acts which was first performed during the 1952 season at the Théâtre Babylone in Paris. It was originally written in French by the extreme egghead and Irishman, Samuel Beckett, who was a friend of the founding father of modern literature, the still more extreme egghead and Irishman, James Joyce. The two acts of Godot are concerned with nothing and its second coming. When the curtain rises we see a country road where two tramps, nebulously called Estragon and Vladimir, have a rendezvous with an equally nebulous personality whom they call Godot. From the outset we are given to feel that they have been waiting for a considerable length of time; their waiting is repeated and somewhat paraphrased during the second act; but when the final curtain falls Godot still has not come. Another day has gone by though, and days in this play are not measured by hours but by the eternities of expecta- tion. However Godot has sent two boys, identical twins of frustration, to tell the vagabonds that he would certainly appear tomorrow but not today. Thereupon the tramps decide to do the only sensible thing and leave; yet they remain where they are in spite of their decision to the contrary. To while away their time, Estragon and Vladimir sit down, stand up; take off their boots and put them on again; resolve to part company but are unable to endure their solitude; plan to commit suicide but find no rope to hang them- selves; cut all sort of capers and are engaged in talks which are as inconclusive as they are amusing. Much of the black humor in these scenes is derived from the fact that their words prove utterly insufficient to carry messages. It is a comedy not so much of error as of Freudian slips. Thus they talk past one another in an anti-drama composed of anti-dialogues. They also meet twice a rather pompous gentleman, Pozzo, who parades his possessions - a pipe, a vaporizer, and a watch - only to lose them in an inexplicable and unexplained Dr. Heinz Politzer is Associate Professor of German at Oberlin College. He was coeditor with Max Brod of the first edition of the Gesammelte Werke of Franz Kafka, vols. 1-4, and has published numerous essays on modern European and American authors, including an Episcopal Faculty Paper, Martin Buber: Humanist and Teacher. Dr. Politzer is the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship for the year 1959-1960. The present address was delivered in the Oberlin College Chapel Service, January 7, 1958.

The name of this hapless fellow is of course Lucky; significantly enough this is the only Anglo-Saxon name in the cast. Pozzo, the slavedriver, and Lucky, the driven slave, differ from Estragon and Vladimir mainly in that they are socially determined, whereas the vagabonds enjoy the freedom of social outcasts who can go where they please. This freedom they share with the wind and the spirit which flat ubi vult and moves where it wants to. It goes without saying that the tramps fail to make any use of their freedom which is, to apply a Nietzschean distinction, only a freedom from something, namely their social responsibilities, but certainly not a freedom employed towards any purpose. Yet these two anti-acts are full of a suspense which is sustained by the relations of the four figures to one another: Estragon for instance comforts Lucky and is rewarded by him with a kick in the shin; eventually however he gets back at the culprit, kicks him, but hurts hit foot in doing so, and ends up groaning: "Oh, the brute." Again much of the plot in the second act centers on the reactions of the tramps to Pozzo who, suddenly blinded, is lying prostrate on the ground and cries out to them for help. At first indifferent and then curious, they become compassionate and then attempt to exploit the fallen man's pre- dicament. Their reactions reach a climax in Vladimir's long and beautifully cadenced speech which he delivers for the sole purpose of preventing himself from actually assisting Pozzo. Eventually he does help him although only after having kicked him too. These interrelationships of Beckett's figures neither express the straightforward feelings of classical drama, nor do they oscillate between ambi- valences which in this Freudian day and age are supposed to keep us suspended between love and hatred, lust of life and fear of death. They are empty or "open" relationships, and if they testify to anything, then to the absence of any dialogical situation between man and man. With complete absurdity Beckett's figures act out their sudden impulses and spit out the fragments of their incoherent thoughts. Yet Waiting for Godot derives a disquieting beauty from the precarious balance which Beckett succeeds in establishing between these "open" human relationships very much in the way Alexander Calder's mobiles enchant us by the equilibrium achieved through their "open" spatial relationships. Obviously this play conveys as little conventional meaning as Calder's constructions show fullbodied plasticity in the sense of traditional sculpture. A play of this kind was bound to excite the critics. Their verdicts ranged from "an exercise in logorrhea," that is diarrhea by mouth, to the French play- wright Jean Anouilh's assertion that its firstnight was as important as the night back in 1923 when the supra-real theater of Luigi Pirandello was introduced to European audiences. Henry Hewes of the Saturday Review of Literature saw in Godot Beckett's acceptance of Freudian and Marxian ideas while London critics [47]</page><page sequence="3">The Christian Scholar like the genteel anonymous egghead of the Times Literary Supplement or Ronald Gray in the Third Programme of the BBC observed in the play a "seeming invitation to see Godot in Christian terms." According to this view Beckett's vagabonds, like Kafka's key figures, are victims of their own despair; marked men who are fallen from the state of grace. As a remembrance of things very past, they carry the distorted vision of a godlier creation in their frantic unconscious but are utterly unable to regain their lost paradise. The Godot for whom they are waiting is, in the minds of these observers, God. The TLS decrees peremptorily: "That Godot himself stands for an anthropomorphic image of God is obvious." However it seems to me that in allegorizing Godot the venerable Times Literary Supplement made a mistake similar to the one committed by Edwin Muir when he interpreted Kafka's Castle as a latter-day version of Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress. Kafka's and Beckett's statements about the absurdity of the human condition defy any interpretation as allegories. Allegories are translations of abstract ideas into word images; yet language has ceased to function as a vehicle of unambiguous meanings in the works of Kafka and Beckett. Rather these works are parables; parables however which are consciously deprived of any clear-cut didactic message. Empty like the human relationships they describe, they stand open to an infinite variety of interpretations and hence in the final analysis to none. But they remain parables in that they address themselves to Everyman; however instead of persuading Everyman to contemplate a betterment of his destiny they shock him into the awareness of this destiny's absurdity. Though parables of this kind possess the iridescence and irrationality of dreams and thus are closely akin to the classic of surrealist literature, Alice in Wonderland, they are perfectly easy to understand. The intention of Waiting for Godot is expressed by its very title. Remember that the play was written in French by an English writer. The French suffix "-ot" in Godot is a diminutive; it occurs in words like Pierrot, little Peter, or Jacquot, Jack. By adding this French diminutive to the English noun denoting the supreme being, Beckett informs us that it is a little God, not God himself, for whom the tramps are waiting. Indeed Estragon mistakes Pozzo for Godot not only because the two names sound, on purpose, alike, but because the sturdy pomposity - and the initial wealth - of Pozzo make him look precisely like the little God he had been expecting. Vladimir, the more pronounced egghead of the two, re-emphasizes the inten- tion of the play when he sententiously remarks: "To every man his little cross." Viewed against the vastness of fear which possesses the two vagabonds, this ironically "little" cross appears as a boomerang hurled back at him who invoked if in blasphemous triviality. [48]</page><page sequence="4">The Egghead Waits for Godot Samuel Beckett displays the honesty which is the hallmark of every genuine intellectual. He does not say more than he knows; and he does not pretend to know more than any other egghead. He does not say that God would come if the tramps had been waiting for him instead of Godot. Nor does he intimate, as Kafka seems to do at times, that Godot fails to materialize because he is so urgently prevailed upon to reveal himself. All that Beckett says in his style of sophisticated innocence is that Vladimir and Estragon are waiting, and Godot has not come. The poetic vision - and grammatic structure - of this writer are bare of all logical causation, all the "becauses" and "henees" with which we are used to rationalize our everyday incoherencies. The two tramps who so desperately try to clown and pun away their meta- physical nausea are Everyman, and their play is the anti-mystery play of our time. They are also eggheads. Ever since the time when Ahasvérus, the Wandering Jew, started out on his unending journey, the tramp and outcast has provided mankind with the image of the restless intellectual condemned to witness the decline of the times which always seem to be out of joint. Shylock, the Flying Dutchman, the Ancient Mariner, and Captain Ahab are all eggheads verbalizing their fallen state in soliloquies of existential despair. They all in one way or the other look back in anger. Ahasvérus, the wr-tramp, laughed when Christ was led past him to his crucifixion, and like him most of his literary descendants are unbe- lievers. Estragon and Vladimir too bubble over with blasphemies; but deep inside their minds an unrest, half reminiscence, half foreboding, is at work and prevents them from ever settling down. Beckett's play abounds in veiled and direct references to Christology; it is one of the few experimental dramas in which Christ has won out over Oedipus as well as Priapus and Narcissus. Of course on Vladimir's "little cross" merely a "little" Christ can hang. Early in the play the tramps discuss the thieves who abused the Christ whose cross stood next to theirs: abused him "because he wouldn't save them." "From hell?" Estragon asks. Thereupon Vladimir: "Imbecile! From death." "I thought," Estragon retorts, "you said hell." But Vladimir insists: "From death, from death." In their desire to be saved from death rather than hell these thieves and tramps are representative of modern man and especially of the modern intellectual. Wherever we scan the contemporary scene we see that our urge for salvation has given way to a mad rush away from death. Take politics for instance or psychiatry, excepting perhaps the theories of C. G. Jung; and do not forget the logical positivists who would consider hell to be the wrong semantic expression of faulty thinking even if they were frying in it at long last. We may interpret hell as madness, as Thomas Mann has done in Doctor Faustus, or as "other people" like Sartre, or conversely as "one-self" and "alone" like T. S. Eliot, but in each case we translate into the vernacular of our daily routine what once had its own place, function, and meaning in a divine universe. Hell has lost its [49]</page><page sequence="5">The Christian Scholar sting for Vladimir and Estragon; and heaven, its light. True, they occasionally stare into the sky but only to be more deeply depressed by the twilight that hovers there and will reign until night falls. More often however they look into their bowler hats, the shabby covers which protect their eggheads against all that is beyond. The augury they read there is summed up in the sentence which not only opens the play but recurs as a leitmotif as long as it lasts: "Nothing to be done." Being an egghead myself, I have no easy solution to offer those who like me are waiting for Godot. I can only turn from Godot to Him whose diminutive he is and recall an anecdote which Martin Buber tells at the end of his first speech on Judaism. When he was a little boy he chanced upon an old Jewish legend which he did not understand. It ran like this: "Before the gates of Rome an old, leprous tramp is sitting and waiting. This is the Messiah." To find an explanation the little boy turned to an old man with the question: "Whom is he waiting for ?" And the answer he got was: "You." [50]</page></plain_text>
