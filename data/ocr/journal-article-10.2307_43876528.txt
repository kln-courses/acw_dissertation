<plain_text><page sequence="1">Inertia of an Automated Utopia Design Commodities and Authorial Agency 40 Years after "The Architecture Machine" Daniel Cardoso Liach In a concise history of architects' embrace of computer-aid- ed design (CAD) Robert Bruegmann notes that in the early days of CAD two camps - Nicholas Negroponte and Yona Friedman in one, and SOM in another - exemplified diverg- ing conceptions of the role of computers in architecture.1 Whereas SOM pioneered the development of software tools to automate aspects of the design of high-rise build- ings, such as cost/area calculation for maximized revenue, Negroponte and Friedman developed socio-technical utopias where computers become partners of people in the design of a "more humane" environment. They envisioned computers as "liberators" of design expertise, allowing people to bypass traditional architects and planners - pro- fessionals they saw as elitist middlemen - and the general- izing assumptions about dwellers that, in their view, drove the contemporary housing market. Nicholas Negroponte's influential book The Architecture Machine, published in 1970 by the MIT Press, synthesized this provocative view of CAD in a collection of speculative scenarios and technological artifacts that projected design as an amiable conversation between humans and computers. While an array of fields celebrates The Architecture Machine's pioneering enunciation of key computational paradigms, including gestural and windows-based interfaces, in this article I focus on aspects of The Architecture Machine's cultural and institutional context to unfold its dimension as a social - not to men- tion architectural - critique. I show that by swapping the social roles of architects and dwellers through intelligent machines, Negroponte sought to de-stabilize traditional conceptions of architectural authorship and that, by con- struing computers as social subjects, he aimed at redefin- ing a contemporary debate about human-machine interac- tion. The terms of this redefinition continue to influence and limit our expectations about design, architecture, and technology. From "perfect slaves" to "mechanical partners" Let us build machines that can learn, can grope, and can fumble, machines that will be architec- tural partners, architecture machines.2 When The Architecture Machine was published, computers were unique, expensive devices that only an academic and government elite had access to. However, the notion of widespread personal computing was already part of the American popular imagination, fueled in part by the awe-inspiring wartime advances in electronics and by the contemporary promotion of technology and automation as patriotic endeavors.3 The MIT School of Architecture, where Negroponte's Architecture Machine Group was housed, was literally (and physically) immersed in an intense climate of technoscientific advancement. MIT - the recipient of the largest sums of federal research funds during the Cold War - was the epicenter of research on me- chanical sensors and actuators, cathode-ray tube monitors and computer graphics.4 The work of Steven Coons, one of a¿ c ° i/i O m DÒ S Z v DO ra ^ Õ _o y E Z U E 2 O £ ÍÍI al "§P 2 0 o O Qj 1 1 qj -5 ^ lA ^ e n _o -o &lt;L&gt; ^ &lt;D ^ Qj E £ &lt; V ļ- % 5 Q &amp; &lt; "O re E oí u c ^ C o i 1 1 3 § o ti JZ Q_ .tí -C DO ^ 39</page><page sequence="2">Negroponte's academic advisors, had a strong influence on the ideas of The Architecture Machine. As a professor of me- chanical engineering, Coons led important developments in computer graphics and computer-aided manufacturing and was an enthusiastic advocate for the use of computers in art, architecture and design.5 Coons conceived design as an iterative process of representation and analysis where a "creative stage," in which a design representation is cre- ated, was followed by a "mechanical stage," in which the representation is tested against different metrics - such as mechanical stress and overall structural performance. Coons believed that the "creative stage" was better suited for human designers while the "mechanical stage" could be successfully automated.6 In The Architecture Machine, Negroponte would adopt the technologies that Coons helped develop as the constitutive elements of his vision, but not without rejecting the dualism between creativ- ity and analysis that rendered computers as the "perfect slaves" of a design process.7 Negroponte instead used a lan- guage that endowed computers with human-like attributes such as curiosity and judgment, and construed human- machine interaction as the "cohabitation of two intelligent species,"8 as a symbiotic relationship that gave origin to an "extended designer," and as an "ecology of mutual design complementation, augmentations, and substitution."9 Despite this key rhetorical difference, Coons' themes are noticeable throughout The Architecture Machine. Among these the notion of adaptability deserves special analysis. Coons distinguished between two different CAD philoso- phies: one that relied on a large set of specialized proce- dures and another that relied on a single one that adapted to its context.10 In The Architecture Machine, Negroponte echoed the contrast between these two philosophies by opposing the notion of flexibility -the capacity of a system to be extended within a fixed set of constraints - to the notion of adaptability- the ability of a single computational procedure to find solutions to different problems. In Coons' and Negroponte's view, user interfaces and programming languages could provide flexibility, but not "true" adapt- ability: We have a condition where each designer is creat- ing his own library of services out of the problem- oriented [programming] language. Once created, note that these operations are no less rigid than the predefined package of design commodities.11 However, the means and methods to achieve adaptability were never discussed, and thus the concept remains as a suggestive device, a black box enclosing a computer's po- tential to revert the perverse effects of industrial standard- ization and of the notion of l'homme type on architectural and urban spaces.12 Clashing with the World or, "Ted, many conflicts are occurring" Instead of presenting a single artifact, as its title suggests, The Architecture Machine developed a collection of scenarios and themes, the majority of which fell into one of two cat- egories. In the first, computers were regarded as artificial experts that guide the dweller through design choices until a unique and optimal residential solution is reached - a sort of architectural "expert system."13 In the second, a computer network was offered as a communication plat- form between a community and a human designer. The network's central processor would interpret the communi- ty's preferences into clear spatial guidelines to be followed by a human architect, thus penetrating what Negroponte considered "the designer-dweller dissonance that exists in today's housing problem."14 As a proof of concept for the first, "expert system" category, Negroponte presented URBAN5, a computer-aided design system comprising a cathode-ray tube monitor, a keyboard, an optic pen, and a small console with several controls - including a notori- ous "PANIC" button. Described as an experiment to test the desirability of natural language as a communication medium between humans and machines, URBAN5 received text commands from the user and interpreted them as geometric and spatial constraints [Figure 3]. The program would then calculate a response based on user inputs, a sort of architectural version of the early language-process- ing program Eliza.15 URBANs's responses were displayed on the cathode-ray tube monitor as compositions of three- 2 aJ DO T3 -O E u a) I O a! z¡ O u ¿o c &lt;0 0 Sí 3 S 1 -c aJ c o Q.

However, URBAN5 did not fulfill Negroponte's expectations because it was unable to enact what were thought to be the attributes of a truly adaptable architecture machine. Playing is learning, but URBAN5 has not been sufficiently sophisticated actually to frolic; instead it has inexhaustibly printed garbage. . . . URBAN5 suggests true dialogue, suggests an evolutionary system, suggests an intelligent system -but, in itself, is none of these.17 An example of the second, "participatory" category is the "Hessdorfer Experiment," in which three African-American men from "Boston's ghetto area" were asked to interact with a machine - comprising a keyboard and a printer head remotely operated by one of the researchers - that interrogated them about their "urban needs" [Figure 4]. Negroponte celebrated that during the experiment the subjects (who thought they were communicating with an autonomous machine) "did not type uncalled-for remarks" and argued that the subjects engaged the machine in a way that would not have taken place if the interlocutor had been a "white planner or politician."18 The experiment is presented in the book as a sign of the computer's potential to foster a more transparent conversa- tion with members of a community. The fact that the book is outdated from a racial, nomenclatural point of view is self-evident, but the kind of neutrality Negroponte was willing to attribute to the machine was worthy of notice. In the Hessdorfer Experiment, the machine is assumed as a neutral device that helped the researchers conceal their personas and, quite specifically, their whiteness. David Noble, writing on technology discourse in the post-war US, informs us that "technology rarely fulfills the fantasies of their creators. As people are fallible, so too are their machines, however perfect, complete, and automatic the designs."19 Yet, even failed technologies cany a blue- print of their maker's time, desires, and questions. URBAN5 and the machine in the Hessdorfer Experiment present design as a collaborative, quantifiable and evolving dialogue with always-adapting machines. These two technological experiments also reveal a desire for design to become a more rational and social endeavor devoid of the imposing subjectivity of the human architect. Moreover, it expresses an anxiety about the social role played by the disciplines of architecture and planning, conveyed through a populist de- sire to give people, through technology, the right to design their own environments.20 Rephrasing Authorship Through Social Machines Aside from a post-structural fantasy of "killing the author," the symbolic demotion, or reconfiguration, of the architect advanced in The Architecture Machine should be understood as a techno-rationalist's reaction to the individualistic notion of the architect as a sole creator, inherited by architecture from L'Ecole de Beaux-Arts.20 The notion of a machine that learns by itself was instrumental in affording Negroponte the space to ignore questions about the machine's nature as a designed artifact, and to inspire visions of machine agency in computer-aided design: When a designer supplies a machine with step-by- step instructions for solving a specific problem, the resulting solution is unquestionably attributed to the designer's ingenuity and labors. . . . Whenever a mechanism is equipped with a processor capable "of finding a method of solution," the authorship of the answer probably belongs to the machine.22 i oT TD -O E ra U H; O u Ô V£&gt; un aT c 5 &lt;3 S? 3 S O) -C a¿ c O CL o Dû (Ll Z E 0 LL.

At the most basic level, it sought to challenge the terms of the contemporary debate about the relationship between humans and machines. In contrast with cultural critics concerned with the de-humanizing aspects of a technological society and with the rise of an unquestionable scientific ideology, The Architecture Machine portrayed computers - and CAD - as vehicles for social and environmental activism. Key to the advancement of this vision was a rhetoric that phrased machines as social entities mirroring the attributes of humans while avoiding inconvenient questions about the programmers' culpability as designers. By re-positioning machines as humans, Negroponte aimed at overcoming- rhetorically, at least - the mechanical-organicist polarity that concerned those who saw technology and people in opposing camps.23 But his move to equate humans and machines reproduced the polarity: using a symmetric language that obscured the machine's complex ties to its makers, Negroponte broke the bridge between the two.24 Considering, with Louis Mumford, technologies as embodi- ments of social relations, and The Architecture Machine's abundant academic progeny, we can think of Negroponte 's socio-technical utopia as inaugurating its own sort of tech- nocratic idealism. Final Notes: Some Futures Never Get Old Negroponte's cultural and moral entrepreneurship carried a critique of the "gentleman architect," an idea predicated on the notions of houses and urban spaces as personal commodities and on the inherent value of uniqueness. By proposing to automate the production of uniqueness - via machines that amortize the time and labor involved - Negroponte gave the notion of adaptability between user and context its contemporary wrapping, and anticipated a desire (and a market) for digitally mass-customized goods. In short, he turned the act of design into a valuable com- modity. By provocatively construing the computer as a social actor capable of de-stabilizing the relationships between buildings, dwellers and architects, Negroponte aimed at shifting the balance in architecture's political economy, giving it a techno-rationalist - and populist - turn. Interestingly, some aspects of this shift continue to under- pin the sensibility and language of today's design Utopians, who craft their visions in terms only superficially different from those advanced in The Architecture Machine. In the new design utopias the emphasis on the idea of adaptability is no longer deployed through the fantasy of an artificial mind, but through biologically-inspired, computationally obtained variation. The attacks on a designer's subjectiv- ity do not come from human-like machines, such as those advanced in Negroponte's vision, but from the unquestion- able, faceless wisdom of an algorithmic conception of the natural. The electronic sketchpads of cathode-ray tube monitors are now replaced by elaborate associative soft- ware platforms, plasma screens and layer deposition 3-D printing technologies. Negroponte's mechanistic idioms have given way to a blend of biological and computational metaphors that reflect a new dominant technoscientific paradigm, yet reproduce the rationalist drive (now called "performance-based") that The Architecture Machine synthe- sized. The imaginarles set in motion by The Architecture Machine - its visions of a technologically enhanced, author- less, participatory planning and design - relate closely to the cultural enterprise of construing technology as a de- mocratizing force, and as a means for uplifting supposedly under-privileged, "third-world" communities (the contem- porary equivalents to the carefully chosen subjects in the Hessdorfer Experiment). Yet, the desire for a better envi- ronment through an expanded, participatory, and techno- scientific practice of design remains unsatisfied today, just as when The Architecture Machine was published. As SOM had predicted, the CAD industry evolved in an entirely differ- ent direction, more in tune with the realities of the market than with the automated utopias of ethical robot designers. Given the distance between its ambitions of social change and the irony of its deployment into popular culture, quan- tifying the success of The Architecture Machine's technological utopia in terms of social "impact" would be unproductive. But it is worth noting that inverting the equation from the gentleman architect into the gentleman dweller does not fundamentally change the nature of the transaction. 43</page><page sequence="6">1 Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM) is an architectural firm founded in Chicago in 1936. The firm has built a vast number of skyscrapers throughout the world, and its name carries- in the architectural and engineer- ing worlds- an instant association with "glass-box" corporate architecture.

Steven A. Coons, "An Outline of the Requirements for a Computer-Aided Design System," in Spring Joint Computer Conference, Detroit, Michigan (New York: ACM, 1963), 301. 7 Ina 1966 lecture Coons described computers and numerically controlled manufacturing technology as "perfect slaves" who would take over the most labori- ous and repetitive aspects of artistic and engineering production- a statement that notoriously resembled Alberti's ideas about the distinction between the architect (who draws) and the "skilled craftsman" (who makes). Daniel Cardoso Llach, "What matters: Certain assumptions in digital design culture," (paper presented in the Harvard University First International Conference on Critical Digital, Cambridge, Massachusetts, April 18-19, 2008). 8 See Negroponte, The Architecture Machine, 7 &amp; 17. 9 MIT's technological impetus inspired in Negroponte visions of anthropomorphic machines with human-like organs that "receive direct sensory information from the real world" and that "must see, hear and read, and must take walks in the garden." Negroponte, The Architecture Machine, 27. 10 Coons was wary about the risk of narrowing the space of design alternatives in a computer-aided design system by overloading the software - and the user - with a large set of very specialized procedures. See Coons, "An Outline of the Requirements for a Computer-Aided Design System," 301. 11 Negroponte, The Architecture Machine, 27. 12 The notion of l'homme type (French for "man-type", or "typical man") was a collection of anthropometric as- sumptions about architecture's "end-user" advanced by advocates of modern architecture, especially in the first half of the twentieth century, to facilitate (and legiti- mize) standardized residential housing design. Abiding by these assumptions could only yield, in Negroponte's view, impersonal and banal architecture. 13 Expert systems are a type of computer program that performs a human expert's task. Such systems are founded on the notion of "knowledge capture": the idea that a "knowledge engineer" can study and encode in a computer program the decision-making process and expertise of a human subject. For a sharp perspective on the culture of "knowledge engineering" and artificial intelligence see Diana Forsythe and David J. Hess, Study- ing Those Who Study Us: An Anthropologist in the World of Artificial Intelligence (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001). 14 Negroponte, The Architecture Machine, 55. 15 Eliza is a computer program that uses a simple "pattern- matching" algorithm to assign pre-canned phrases as responses to sentences entered as text by the user. The interaction with the program gave the user the impression - generally for a brief time - of havinga con- versation with a human (the program simulates being a Rogerian psychotherapist). Eliza was written in 1966 by Joseph Weizenbaum at MIT, and is considered an early example of automated language processing. There are many available online implementations of the program. One can be found at "Eliza Test", accessed January 10, 2011, http://chayden.net/eliza/Eliza.html. 16 Today we would call these cubes "voxels," a word that wasn't available at the time The Architecture Machine was written. 17 Negroponte, The Architecture Machine, 93. 18 Negroponte, The Architecture Machine, 50. 19 Noble, Forces of Production, 325. 20 Cf. Nicholas Negroponte, Reflections on Computer Aids to Design and Architecture (New York: Petrocelli/Charter, 1975). While a few years later, in a less enthusiastic tone, Negroponte would admit the naïveté of these experi- ments, the notion of empowerment through technology remained a constant of his work. 21 In fact, Bruegmann places Negroponte in a tradition of rationalism that goes back to J.N.L. Durand. Bruegmann, "The Pencil and the Electronic Sketchpad," 140. 22 Negroponte, The Architecture Machine, n. 23 "What needs to be articulated, regardless of the format of the man-machine relationship, is the goal of humanism through machines.... The concern is to avoid dehumanizing a process whose aim is definitely humanization." See Negroponte, The Architecture Machine, 7. Matthew Wisniosky's history of engineers' temporary reconciliation with social theory during the fifties and sixties captures and elaborates on the contrast between these two postures about technology and society by distinguishing between two philosophies, a theory of technological change, which attributes agency to technology as a semi-autonomous force, and a theory of technological politics, which considers technology as an "embodiment of social relations." Matthew Wisniosky "Engineers and the Intellectual Crisis of Technology" (Ph.D. diss., Princeton University, 2005), 6. 24 Lucy Suchman coined the term "dissymmetry" to overcome idioms of absolute symmetry or absolute asymmetry between humans and machines.
