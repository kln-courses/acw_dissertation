<plain_text><page sequence="1">Diegesis and Mimesis: The Poetic Modes and the Matter of Artistic Presentation KAROL BERGER In the third book of the Republic, Socrates, hav- ing examined the subject matter of tales or the "what" of speech, went on to discuss the "how," the "diction" or "the manner of speech."1 "Fabulists or poets," he said, "proceed either by pure narration (die- gesis) or by a narrative that is effected through imitation (mimesis), or both." On some occasions, Homer "himself is the speaker and does not even attempt to suggest to us that anyone but himself is speaking." On other occasions, he "tries as far as may be to make us feel that Homer is not the speaker," but a personage in his tale. In the former case, he effects his storytelling through pure and simple narration, in the latter, through the imitation of another person's speech. Thus, "there is one kind of poetry and taletelling which works wholly through imitation, ... tragedy and comedy, and another which em- ploys the recital of the poet himself, best exemplified . . . in the dithyramb, and there is again that which employs both, in epic poetry and in many other places...." Aristotle, in the Poetics, took over the Platonic distinctions. The representational arts, "epic poetry and tragedy, as also comedy, dithyrambic poetry, and most flute-playing and lyre-playing,"2 but also others, such as dances and perhaps even painting,4 differ from one another in the means or media they use, in the objects they represent, and in the manner or mode of imitation.5 "Given both the same means and the same kind of object for imitation, one may either Volume XII * Number 4 * Fall 1994 The Journal of Musicology ? 1994 by the Regents of the University of California ' Plato, Republic, 392C-394c (trans.

My aim here is to clarify the nature of the modes7 and raise the question of their applicability outside the realm of literature, specif- ically, to paintings and music.9 6 Ibid., 1448a20-24. 7 In thinking about the problems raised in this paper, I have found the work of the following literary theorists particularly useful: Mikhail M.

Any use of language pre- supposes a speaker (and listener, even if the latter is the same person as the speaker), writer (and reader), or thinker. Since the differences between speaking, writing, and thinking are irrelevant in the present context, I shall refer to the language user implied by any act of speech as the "speaker" or the "voice." A speaker can, of course, be a real person or an imaginary per- sonage. And his existence, whether real or imaginary, may be merely implied by the very fact that something is said, or it may be thematized with various degrees of explicitness (just as my existence as the speaker of this text is presented much less explicitly here than it would be if this were an autobiography). In other words, while any speech act implies the speaker, some may do no more than that, leaving the question of the reality or fictionality of the speaker entirely open and not bringing his existence out explicitly. A fundamental distinction one must make when thinking about the nature of literary modes (a distinction that, it seems to me, has never been made with sufficient clarity) is the one between a voice speaking immediately, that is, without the mediation of another voice, and a voice whose speech is reported by another, immediately speak- ing, voice. (Thought police searching for traces of the "metaphysics of presence" should relax upon learning that "an immediately speaking voice" does not mean here "a voice not embodied in a medium," but merely "a voice not mediated by another voice.") Note that a speech literature and music. In Germany, the main stimulus to thinking about music in these terms came from the "Roman" chapter in Theodor W. Adorno's 1960 monograph on Mahler: Mahler.

Jahrhunderts 46 (Regensburg, 1975), 87-117 (reprinted in Danuser, Gustav Mahler und seine Zeit [Laaber, 1991], 152-84). In the U.S.A., most work in this area is indebted to Edward T.

Note also that the distinction between the immediate and reported speech is not coextensive with the distinction between the direct and indirect speech. In" 'We have,' said Haze, 'an excellent dentist. Our neighbor, in fact. Dr. Quilty. Uncle or cousin, I think, of the playwright' " Haze speaks directly, while in "They had, said Haze, an excellent dentist. Their neighbor, in fact. Dr. Quilty. Uncle or cousin, she thought, of the playwright" she would have spoken indirectly, but in both cases her speech is reported by another voice, the one that says "said Haze" and belongs to Humbert. Now a literary work, any literary work, must present its content by means of at least one voice and it may employ many voices. All of the voices heard in a literary work may speak immediately, or only some voices may speak immediately, while oth- ers have their speech reported by those speaking immediately. When the work employs only one voice, this must speak immediately. When several voices are heard, they may all speak immediately and at least one of them must speak immediately. Thus, if we want to classify literary works on the basis of how they present their contents by means of the voices they use, we must first distinguish the voices speaking immediately from those whose speech is reported. Since only the immediately speaking voices are absolutely indispensable if any literary presentation is to arise, while the use of the reported speech is optional, we may classify all literary works into those using only one immediately speaking voice and those using many such voices. In other words, we might distinguish the "mono- phonic" mode involving only one immediately speaking voice, with all other voices, if any, having their speech reported, and the "poly- phonic" mode involving many immediately speaking voices, without excluding, or requiring, voices whose speech is reported. (Needless to say, the terms are used in a sense quite different from Bakhtin's, a sense much closer to their source in the vocabulary of music theory. 1) But we should not prematurely conclude that our distinction between the monophonic and polyphonic modes is identical with the Platonic distinction between the diegetic and dramatic modes. When Plato introduced the concepts of diegesis and mimesis, what mattered to him was not the number of immediately speaking voices, but rather their nature. We might best be able to capture the essential difference he had in mind, if we see it as depending on whether a 10 Cf. Mikhail M. Bakhtin, Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics, trans. Caryl Emerson (Minneapolis, 1984).</page><page sequence="5">BERGER speaker belongs to the world presented by his speech or not. A speaker may himself belong to the world his speech presents, he may be what we call a "character" or "personage" in this world. Or a speaker might tell us of a world to which he himself does not belong; he may be what we call a "narrator" of the presented world. The dramatic mode is the one in which all the immediately speaking voices belong to the personages. In the diegetic mode, the immediately speaking voice belongs to the narrator. The notion of a speaker belonging or not to the world presented by his speech requires some clarification, if it is not to mislead. We need a criterion of the identity of a world, a criterion on the basis of which we can decide whether given persons belong to the same world or not. An unambiguous criterion will be found when we reflect on the relationship between the persons and the deictic temporal ad- verbs they use, words such as "now," "then," "today," "yesterday," or "tomorrow." Two persons do not share a common world, when it is possible for them that the word "now" (as well as all the remaining deictic temporal adverbs) might not have the same meaning (or, more precisely, might not refer to the same time) when they utter it (them) simultaneously. This is never possible for you and me and hence we inhabit a common world. But since the "now" of the narrator does not have to refer to the same time as the "now" of a personage in the narrator's story, they belong to two different worlds.ii To be sure, a narrator might be telling a story that happens simultaneously with his telling it. But this does not synchronize the "nows" of the narrator and personage necessarily and permanently, because it is always possible for the narrator to retell the same story. The next time he tells it, the "now" of the personage will be in the past of the "now" of the narra- tor. This is because the "now" of the personage in the story refers always to the same time each time the story is told, while the "now" of the story-telling narrator refers to a different time each time he tells the story. Note that this is the case even when the narrator is a personage in the story he narrates: since his "now" as the narrator is different from his "now" as the personage, in his role as the narrator he belongs to a different world than the one he narrates and to which he belongs in his role of a personage.12 Note moreover, that, while the lack of ' For the distinction between the "time of narrating" and "narrated time," see the classic 1948 paper by Ginther Miller, "Erzlihlzeit und erzaihlte Zeit," Morphologische Poetik, 269-86. "12 Cf. Philippe Lejeune, On Autobiography, Theory and History of Literature, vol. 52 (Minneapolis, 1989). 411</page><page sequence="6">412 THE JOURNAL OF MUSICOLOGY synchronization of the two "nows" is verbally explicit when the nar- rator uses the past tense-as is his wont, the asynchronism obtains even in those stories in which the teller uses the present tense (which is why one usually calls such a tense the "historical present"). In cases of this sort the reader must decide whether the speaker tells a story (and the author uses the diegetic mode) or reports on what he cur- rently observes (and the mode of the text is dramatic). While the author may leave the reader without a clue, usually a clue is provided. In Chekhov's dreary tale of Gusev, the speaker sticks rigorously to the present tense, but by the time Gusev's dead body is thrown overboard into the ocean and at the depth of over sixty feet is encountered by a shark the reader realizes that this must be a story, it being most unlikely that anyone would want to suffer the discomfort involved in observing such a scene directly and having to report on it as it hap- pens. But if it is a story, the narrator's "now" must differ from, be posterior to, the "nows" of the unfortunate Gusev and the fortunate shark, since the narrator presumably knows the story with its outcome in advance of the telling. Another kind of clue, this time explicitly verbal, is provided in Goethe's 1782 ballad of the "Erlk6nig." The narrating voice, heard only in the first and last stanzas, uses the present tense throughout the report on the father's hurried night ride home, his groaning son in his arms, but switches to the preterite in the last verse to describe the outcome: "In seinen Armen das Kind war tot" ("The child was dead in his arms"). Thus the narrating voice distances itself suddenly and finally from the narrated world (the move paralleled by Schubert in his celebrated setting when, for the last verse, he abandons the pianistic reenactment of the breathless ride for the suddenly distancing objective tone of the recitative). This asynchronism of the narrator's and the personage's "nows" results in what is surely the single most essential feature of diegesis. A literary work may present a narrator who, in turn, presents a world which is not his own. It follows that while the world presented dra- matically in a literary work may be a single world, the world presented diegetically will consist of at least two distinct ontological levels, the immediately presented world of the narrator and the world mediated by the voice of the narrator. While the primary focus of the reader's attention is usually on this latter mediated world, structurally the narrated world is hierarchically subordinated to the world of the narrator. One might also say that the former is embedded in, or dependent on, the latter, since it is the existence of the narrator's voice that makes the existence of the narrated world possible, and not the reverse.</page><page sequence="7">BERGER The four terms of the two modal dichotomies just expounded, the one between monophony and polyphony and the one between diegesis and mimesis, may occur in actual literary works in every possi- ble combination: the diegetic mode is usually monophonic ("mono- phony" in the sense in which the term is used here would, of course, in no way prevent a work from being "polyphonic" in the sense in- troduced by Bakhtinls), but a literary work may also employ several immediately speaking voices as narrators; the dramatic mode is usu- ally polyphonic, but a literary work may also employ a single imme- diately speaking voice as a personage (as in the dramatic monologue). A mixed mode, in which some of the immediately speaking voices serve as narrators and others as personages, is also conceivable. More- over, we have already seen that a narrator can also be a personage (in a story told by himself or by another narrator), although as a narrator he will belong to a different, more fundamental or primary, world than the one he belongs to as a personage. Conversely, a personage can become a narrator in his own right, though again, as a narrator he will belong to a different, more fundamental, world than the world he presents in his narration. Two observations should be made at this point. First, even though Plato and Aristotle concentrated on the "narrative" in the broad sense of the term, that is, on the literary presentation of events, of men in action, and disregarded what we call the "lyric," the kind of poem which does not present the actions one does, but the states one finds oneself in, the modal categories they introduced cut across the narrative-lyric distinction and are applicable to the whole realm of literature.'4 In other words, the applicability of modal categories does not depend on the distinctions based on the object of presentation. Thus our two modal dichotomies are operative not only in the nar- rative text-type or form, but also in the lyric. A polyphonic lyric is conceivable, though a monophonic one is far more usual. And the lyrical voice may belong either to a personage (whether implied or explicit), making no difference between his own "now" and the "now" of the world of which he speaks, or it may belong to a narrator whose "now" is not that of the world of which he speaks (as happens when he uses the preterite).

K. Baker and B.R. Hanning, eds., Musical Humanism and Its Legacy: Essays in Honor of Claude V. Palisca (Stuyvesant, NY, 1992), 451-70. 413</page><page sequence="8">414 THE JOURNAL OF MUSICOLOGY Second, our two modal dichotomies are operative in texts regard- less of whether the world portrayed in them is imaginary (as in works of fiction) or real (as in works of history). Note in particular that not only the novelist, but also the historian presents in his work a narrator whose "now," and hence world, is different from that of the world which comes into being in the narrator's story. The historian may try very hard to keep the narrator as inconspicuous as possible, but he cannot make him disappear completely. The very choice of the topic, the arrangement of the material, the judgments passed on the actors and events of the narrated history allow us to catch a glimpse, how- ever fleeting, of the narrator, imply what kind of a person he is, what his priorities and values are. The results reached thus far may be summarized as follows. First, a literary work must present its content by means of at least one immediately speaking voice (monophony), and it may employ many such voices (polyphony). Second, an immediately speaking voice may belong to a personage, that is, a speaker who is himself a part of the world his speech presents (the dramatic mode), or it may belong to a narrator, that is, a speaker who tells us of a world of which he himself is not a part (the diegetic mode). Third, both the personage and the narrator belong to the world presented in the literary work, but while the world presented dramatically may be a single world, the world presented diegetically must consists of at least two distinct and hier- archically related ontological levels, the world to which the narrator belongs and the different, subordinated, world which he presents. Thus all the immediate (as well as, of course, all the reported) voices and their speakers are presented in the literary work. That is to say, they are not just the way in which the work's content is presented, the work's "how," as Plato would say, but also a component of this content itself, of the work's "what," or, to use Aristotle's terms, they are not only the whole of the mode, but also a part of the object of representation. To put it more precisely, the world which comes into being, is made present, in the work does not consist only of the rep- resented "object," that is, the "material" existents, such as the acting (suffering) and speaking (listening, writing, reading, thinking) per- sonages and the settings in which they act and speak, as well as the "formal" relationships among them. It consists also of the "mode" of representation itself, that is, the immediately speaking voices and their speakers. This is obviously the case in the dramatic mode in which all the immediately speaking voices belong to the represented personages. Less obviously, this is the case also in the diegetic mode: the narrating voice is not only a medium of presentation, but also a component of the presented world, even though the narrator may be</page><page sequence="9">BERGER realized with varying degrees of completeness, ranging from a fully rounded and explicit personage to an attenuated and disembodied voice, and even though the world of the narrator differs from the narrated world. The modes in painting and music We have seen that in a literary work the mode and the matter of presentation overlap, but only in part: while all the immediately speaking voices, that is, all of the mode of presentation, are at the same time, as personages and narrators, a part of the presented matter, not all of the matter must also be the mode. In other words, all of the voices that do the presenting are also pre- sented, but not everything that is presented must also be engaged in presenting. Some or even all of the personages may never become a part of the mode and none of the setting ever does. It is precisely because the overlap between the mode and matter in a literary work is only partial that it is sometimes useful to distinguish the two. Now it is striking that in most painting and music the mode and matter seem to overlap so completely that the distinction between them col- lapses. But in each of these arts this happens in a somewhat different way. One might be tempted to think, namely, that in painting the mode is absorbed by the matter, while in music the matter disappears into the mode. If one wanted to find in painting something analogous to the immediately speaking voices of literature, one would have to enlarge the scope of the notion of "voice" to include a person's way of com- municating his meaning by addressing not only our sense of hearing, but also our sense of sight, that is, to include not only his speech, but also his total aspect, especially the facial expression and gestures. A literary personage communicates his meaning by means of speech, a painted one, by means of aspect. Once we have enlarged the scope of the notion of voice to include not only speech but also appearance, however, we notice immediately that a personage in a painting com- municates in exactly the same way as the setting does. In a literary work, the personage may present himself, but the setting can only be presented (by a personage or the narrator). In a painting, the setting presents itselfjust as much as a personage does. But if this is so, if-as it appears-everything presents itself and nothing is merely pre- sented, the distinction between the mode and the matter of presen- tation seems to lose all usefulness in painting. By contrast with painting, in music it would be easy to talk about the mode of presentation. But just as in painting, also in music it 415</page><page sequence="10">416 THE JOURNAL OF MUSICOLOGY seems to be impossible to distinguish the mode from the matter of presentation. The concept of mode fits music in a most natural way, because the notion of voice has been for centuries very much at home in music theory. This was only to be expected, so long as the most sophisticated art music (the kind that was most likely to become the object of theorizing) was predominantly or exclusively vocal. A "voice" in a composition was simply a melodic line. If there was only one such line, the composition was "monophonic"; if there were more than one simultaneous line, it was "polyphonic." The gradually increasing im- portance and independence of instruments did not bring any essen- tial change in this respect, since a melodic line can be carried by an instrument just as well as by a human voice. It did introduce, however, a new textural possibility ("homophony" is its technical name), in which a fully integral melodic line is given an "accompaniment," a kind of a soundscape setting which does not quite attain the full integrity of shape and continuity that an independent line possesses, but can have a degree of motivic definition of its own. Much of the textural interest of music written after 1780 lies in the fact that the boundary between a line and its accompaniment may become blurred, that a melodic motif can join the accompaniment and the reverse, an accompanimental motif can be melodically thematized. On occasion it is even impossible to decide whether what we hear is a melody or an accompaniment; the music can be heard both ways. But even when such possible ambiguities have been taken into account, everything that we hear in a piece of music is either a line, or its accompaniment, or both. However, unlike in literature in which a setting or a person- age may be merely presented, without presenting themselves, but like in painting in which all matter seems always to present itself, also in music both the line and the accompaniment seem always to present themselves and never to be merely presented. (Another way of mak- ing this point might be to say that the pictorial and musical voices, unlike the literary ones, seem to be able to use only the first-person pronouns, "I" and "we.") But if this is so, then-again-it appears that the distinction between the mode and the matter of presentation loses its usefulness also in music. Note in this context that Adorno's claim "that [Mahler's] music performs itself, has itself for the content, narrates without the nar- rated,"'5 loses its air of paradox when music stops being compared with literature (where we normally expect a voice to present some- thing else than itself in addition to presenting itself) and is compared '5 "DaB Musik sich selber vortrage, sich selbst zum Inhalt habe, ohne Erztihltes erzaihle ..." Adorno, Aahler. Eine musikalische Physiognomik, 225.</page><page sequence="11">BERGER with painting instead (where we do not expect a "voice" to present anything else than itself). Music's lack of "referentiality" will stop troubling us when, instead of expecting it to behave like language, we notice that in this respect it is more akin to painting. A depicted figure does not "refer" to anything, it simply appears. Like a musical voice, it says something without our being able to tell what it says, or, more precisely, without our being able to distinguish its appearance from what it says. If this does not trouble us when we think about painting, there is no reason why it should when music is our subject. Incidentally, it probably goes without saying that the claim that in painting and music everything seems to present itself and nothing to be merely presented should not be construed to mean that the matter presenting itself may never bring to mind something other than itself. This is obviously not the case in painting, where one invariably sees the painted personages and settings in contexts of those we know from other sources-painted, written, or real. But even in abstract instrumental music, the lines and accompaniments often bring to mind something other than themselves, if they had previously been associated with this "something other," previously, that is, in the course of the cultural tradition (the way fanfares sound military and menuets aristocratic), or in the course of a particular work (in the manner of a Wagnerian Leitmotiv). All that the claim that in painting and music everything seems to present itself and nothing to be merely presented means is that in these two arts, unlike in visual or aural traffic signs or in language when it is reduced to its referential func- tion, what presents itself cannot be bypassed without a loss of some- thing essential. However, the claim that in painting and music everything pre- sents itself and nothing is merely presented, while generally correct, has to be revised if we are to account for some significant phenomena. Let us consider how the categories of elements that constitute, singly or in any combination, the world presented in the literary work (namely, the setting, the personage, and the narrator) compare with those constituting the worlds presented in paintings and musical works. My claim will be that while we may easily find analogues for the setting and the personage in painting and music, a true narrative voice is more difficult to locate and may be something of a rarity in these two arts. Normally, the setting and the personage, or their an- alogues, exhaust the list of categories of elements that may be found to constitute, singly or jointly, the worlds presented in paintings and musical works. We have observed above that the only way to make the notion of "voice" or "speaker" applicable not only to literature and music but 417</page><page sequence="12">418 THE JOURNAL OF MUSICOLOGY also to painting, was to enlarge its scope to include not only speech but also appearance. Once we do that, we can see that in figurative painting the presented human figure serves as the exact analogue of the literary personage and the natural or man-made surroundings of the figure take on the function strictly analogous to the literary set- ting. In such genres as landscape or still life, the setting can emanci- pate itself from the human figure and be independently thematized, just as in some portraits the setting may be left almost entirely indis- tinct. But' in any case, the personage and the setting are the only categories of elements of the world normally presentable in figurative painting. Analogues of the setting and the personage can also be found in abstract painting, but there they are much less exact. As Richard Wollheim persuasively argued, abstract painting is a species of rep- resentational painting.'6 In both figurative and abstract painting, we see not only the real object, the differentiated flat surface, but also (I would prefer to say, primarily) the imaginary presented world, the space with objects in it, something in front of, or behind, something else. (The rich tradition in modernist painting that may be inter- preted as striving to obliterate the very distinction between the real and the imaginary object and to reduce painting to the differentiated flat surface only must necessarily remain beyond our present pur- view.'7) In this sense, figurative and abstract painting are both species i6 Wollheim, Painting as an Art, 46, 62. Wollheim's argument is interestingly de- veloped in Kendall L. Walton, Mimesis as Make-Believe. On the Foundations of the Repre- sentational Arts (Cambridge, MA, 199o), 55f. '7 See, e.g., Michael Fried, Three American Painters. Kenneth Noland, Jules Olitski, Frank Stella (Cambridge, MA, Fogg Art Museum, 1965), 43: "[Frank Stella's early work] can be fitted neatly into a version of modernism that regards the most advanced paint- ing of the past hundred years as having led to the realization that paintings are nothing more than a particular sub-class of things, invested by tradition with certain conven- tional characteristics (such as their tendency to consist of canvas stretched across a wooden support, itself rectangular in most instances) whose arbitrariness, once recog- nized, argues for their elimination. According to this view [a view that Fried makes clear is repugnant to him], the assertion of the literal character of the picture-support manifested with growing explicitness in modernist painting from Manet to Stella rep- resents nothing more nor less than the gradual apprehension of the basic 'truth' that paintings are in no essential respect different from other classes of objects in the world.. " Arthur C. Danto (The Transfiguration of the Commonplace. A Philosophy of Art [Cambridge, MA, 1981]) quotes Fried (p. 86) and makes the following comment (p. 87): "And, paradoxically enough, if the paintings were to be understood as saying, about themselves, that they were only things in the world, the fact that they said it would refute them: an apple does not commonly assert that it is just an apple. In one sense nothing could be more easy and more difficult at the same time than to create a work that was only to be identical with its own physical support, since the latter would ipso facto be the subject of the work, whereas physical supports logically lack subjects. The problem is analogous to that in which contemporary artists struggled to achieve a surface that was flat; for while nothing seemed easier-the surfaces were flat-the task</page><page sequence="13">BERGER of representational art. They differ only in the kind of concepts, figurative ("woman") or abstract ("rectangle"), under which we bring what we see in the painting. More precisely, I should prefer to say that they differ in the degree of abstraction of the concepts under which we bring what we see in the painting. Putting it thus, allows us to see immediately that the line dividing the abstract from the figurative painting is necessarily blurred (something we might also have learned from some nineteenth-century painters, such as Turner), and to un- derstand why this is so. One can find inexact analogues of the per- sonage and the setting even in abstract painting, because the imagi- nary world presented in it must consist of the figure(s) and the more or less distinct (back)ground against which it is seen. (To be sure, just as in instrumental music since the late eighteenth century it is occa- sionally impossible to decide whether what we hear is a melody or an accompaniment, so in painting of our own century, and not only abstract-think of cubism, it is often impossible to decide whether what we see is a figure or a ground; the painting can be seen both ways. But even when such possible ambiguities have been taken into account, everything that we see in a painting, whether figurative or abstract, is either a figure, or a ground, or both.) The painting being abstract, the figure cannot be identified as human, or as any other kind of recognizable object. But since the line dividing the abstract from the figurative painting is blurred, the figure may be anthropo- morphic, or-more generally-it may, but does not have to, resemble to a degree any kind of visual object. So much for the analogues of the personage and setting in paint- ing, whether figurative or abstract. To turn now to music, the use of voices uttering texts is what literary works and pieces of vocal music have in common. It follows that in vocal music (whether accompanied by instruments or not) the exact analogue of the personage's voice is the melodic line carried by the human voice. A singer of such a line is doing exactly what an actor does when he recites his part; they both impersonate. If there is an accompaniment, its function is anal- ogous to that of the setting, namely, to provide an environment for the personage, a background against which he may appear. These analogies are maintained, although less exactly, in purely instrumental music as well. As Kendall L. Walton pointed out, "most or even all music will likely have to be considered representational" for reasons analogous to those brought forward by Wollheim in sup- port of his thesis that both figurative and abstract painting are species was impossible in that, however evenly paint was applied, the result was a piece of pictorial depth of an indeterminate extension." 419</page><page sequence="14">420 THE JOURNAL OF MUSICOLOGY of representational art.'8 Also in music we make a distinction between the real object (the actual sounds we hear) and the imaginary pre- sented world (which appears when we hear these sounds as "being in motion," as constituting lines of directed tension) consisting of the melodic lines and the accompaniment, or-more generally-of fig- ures appearing against a more or less distinct ground.'9 (And also in music there is a branch of the avant-garde-represented most prom- inently by John Cage-that strives to obliterate the distinction and reduce music to the real sounding object or its obverse, silence.) Since a piece of instrumental music, no less than a vocal one, presents an imaginary world consisting of figures heard against a more or less distinct ground, one can find inexact analogues of the personage (the line) and the setting (the accompaniment) even in instrumental music. The analogues are less exact than in vocal music, because the line may be so far removed from the vocal style of melody and from any kind of movement a human body might make that we would not want to attribute it to a human source. But the reverse is also true: the line may be strongly anthropomorphic, it may preserve to some extent a vocal character, or the character of a stylized human movement, and hence also an intimation of a human utterance or appearance, even when it is carried by an instrument rather than a voice. One might say that vocal and instrumental music differ in the degree of abstraction of the concepts under which we bring what we hear. In vocal music we usually attribute the melodic line to a human personage. In instru- mental music, or in vocal music with independent (obbligato is the technical term) instrumental line(s), the instrumental line can some- times be attributed to a source that resembles to a certain degree a person or another object we could name, but it can also remain so abstract that we will not be tempted to attribute it to a human or any other kind of recognizable source. Incidentally, it would not have escaped us by now to what extent the relationship between vocal and instrumental music resembles the one between figurative and abstract painting. In the histories of both arts the emergence of abstraction is a relatively late development, the emancipation of purely instrumental genres from the periphery to the center of the art occurring only in the late eighteenth century and i8 Walton, Mimesis as Make-Believe, 56.

Indeed, one might be justified to interpret the latter birth as the realization of painting's aspiration toward the condition of music, the aspiration that Walter Pater ascribed to all art in 1877.20 Wassily Kandinsky's 1912 manifesto, Concerning the Spiritual in Art,2' would support such a reading and in fact was immediately interpreted in this way in Arnold Schoenberg's essay on "The Relationship to the Text"22 which ap- peared in 1912 in Der blaue Reiter almanac edited by Kandinsky and Franz Marc.23 However, while we could find with little difficulty more or less exact analogues of the literary personage and setting in painting and music, it is less easy to identify the narrator in either of these two arts. Let us recall that a literary work that employs the diegetic mode must present its content by means of at least one immediately speaking voice belonging to a narrator, that is, a speaker who tells us of a world of which he himself is not a part and that the world presented dieget- ically must consist of at least two distinct and hierarchically related ontological levels, the world to which the narrator belongs and the different, subordinated, world which he presents. Thus the diegetic mode involves first, the hierarchical relationship between the world of the narrator and the presented world, with the latter embedded so to speak in the former; second, the immediately speaking voice of the narrator; and third, the presented world mediated by the narrator's voice. We should ask now whether any of these three features of diegesis is possible in painting and in music. To begin with painting, there can be little doubt that something very much akin to the first feature of diegesis is possible there. The world presented in a painting may be split into two hierarchically related levels when the painting presents a picture-within-picture. (We should not consider here those late medieval panels that present simultaneously several episodes from the life of a saint when these are not hierarchically related but simply juxtaposed, since such panels may have been intended to be taken serially, like a comic strip, rather than as a single picture.) A picture-within-picture presents a second- ary, ontologically less fundamental, dependent world embedded in the primary, independent, fundamental one. The simplest case is a 20 "All art constantly aspires toward the condition of music." Pater, "The School of Giorgione" in his The Renaissance: Studies in Art and Poetry, ed. D. L.

(In spite of intriguing similarities, a mirror, or a window, would not quite do, since what it reflects, or opens to, is the primary world of the painting, not a secondary one.) More complex and possibly ambigu- ous cases may arise when the internal frame separating the picture- within-picture from the rest of the main picture is not explicitly marked but only implied by, say, a different scale of the objects pre- sented within it. The situation is still more ambiguous, hopelessly so, in abstract painting. An internal frame is, of course, entirely possible there, but it may be that if we are ever inclined to see the world within the frame as different from the one outside, it is only by analogy with and in reminiscence of the figurative paintings we had seen. And the ambiguity is hopeless, because we can never decide whether the in- ternal frame reminds us of one delimiting a picture hanging on the wall, a mirror, or a window. Nevertheless, if the contrast between what is within and what is outside the internal frame is sufficiently great, we may be tempted to interpret the world within the frame as different from the one outside. Something like the second feature of the diegetic mode, the im- mediately speaking voice of the narrator, may also appear in painting, provided we accept our earlier observation that if we want to find in painting an analogue of the immediately speaking voices of literature, we have to enlarge the scope of the notion of "voice" to include not only speech, but also appearance. A human figure presented in a painting may gesture toward the picture-within-picture and thus function like the narrator, the immediately speaking voice presenting a world of which he himself is not a part. For obvious reasons such a figure cannot appear in abstract painting. But we should remember that also in literature the narrating voice may be almost completely disembodied, that the source of this voice does not have to come into focus as a personage. Thus we may have something like the narrating voice in painting even without the explicitly presented human figure gesturing toward the picture-within-picture, since the world outside the internal frame may be said to present in a sense the world within the frame. In a representation of an empty room with a painting hanging on the wall, it is the room itself-of which the painting on the wall understood as a "real" object is a part-that presents the world of the painting on the wall. Without the room, specifically without the painting on the wall understood as a "real" object, as a part of the room's furniture, the world presented in the painting on the wall could not appear, just as the world presented by the narrating voice could not appear without this voice. This observation has an interesting but potentially misleading corollary. It might be concluded, namely, that the fundamental struc-</page><page sequence="17">BERGER ture of any work of art is in a certain sense always "diegetic," since the work is always a real object (an object existing in the "now" of the real world) that mediates an "imaginary" or "intentional" presented world (with its own, different, "now"). This is correct, but the crucially important point to keep in mind here is that the work as the real object is outside the presented world, while the narrative voice must be within it. And here we have already crossed over to the third feature of the diegetic mode. If the observations made above are correct, it must be possible to have in painting a presented world mediated by the nar- rating voice, since the world of the picture-within-picture is necessar- ily mediated or presented by the world outside the internal frame. Note that the latter two features of diegesis are in a sense redundant, since they are already implied by the first feature. Thus the hierar- chical relationship between two worlds, or two ontological levels, is all we need to identify the presence of the diegetic mode. But if we want the narrating "voice" to be thematized as the personage of the nar- rator, we must have a human figure gesturing toward the picture- within-picture. One might be tempted to object here that we have overlooked an important distinction between painting and literature. If in a figura- tive painting presenting a picture-within-picture we take away the internal frame and everything outside of it, we will be left with a presentation in the purely dramatic mode and no trace of any diegesis, without having to repaint anything within the internal frame. If, on the other hand, in a literary work presented in the diegetic mode we take away the voice of the narrator, we may be forced to do a con- siderable rewriting in order to obliterate all traces of diegesis and trans- form the presentation into the dramatic mode. This is, of course, a correct observation. Its significance, however, should not be overes- timated. When transforming a literary presentation from the diegetic into the dramatic mode, we are forced to rewrite what remains after the narrating voice had been removed only if indirect speech was used. We then have to put everything the personages say into direct speech. All that our observation means is that indirect speech is pos- sible only in literature and not in painting. This, however, cannot constitute an objection to our showing how the diegetic mode can arise in painting, since also in literature we can have diegesis without the use of indirect speech. The conclusions we have reached concerning painting are imme- diately relevant to an understanding of the diegetic potential of mu- sic. Since in a vocal line the text usually imposes its mode on the music, the voice of the narrator is, of course, entirely possible there (think of the Evangelist in a Passion). But is it also possible when the text has 423</page><page sequence="18">424 THE JOURNAL OF MUSICOLOGY been subtracted from the melodic line, or was never attached to it, in instrumental music, or in the obbligato instrumental voices of vocal- instrumental works? The key question, we have just seen, is whether one might be able to present in an instrumental line two hierarchically related worlds, one embedded in the other. To ask this question in a more precise, and potentially more fruitful, way, can an instrumental voice, in addition to presenting itself, mediate another voice (or ac- companiment), belonging to a different world, without simply becom- ing this other voice? Now it is important to realize that the way an instrumental voice maintains its identity in a piece is crucially depen- dent on the identity of the instrument, or-in the case of the orches- tral rather than soloistic or chamber-music texture-instruments, that perform it (as Adorno put it, in the orchestral texture "the sound alone presents a We as the musical subject"24), or-in the case of instruments capable of polyphony, such as the organ or piano-on the register within which the voice moves. (To be sure, the situation is further complicated by the fact that actually used instruments may combine into imaginary "super-instruments" to such an extent that even a whole orchestra might be conceived of as a single multi-colored "super-instrument." Moreover, it may on occasion be impossible to decide whether the music is played by a single imaginary "instru- ment," or by many such "instruments"; the music may be legitimately heard in several different ways.25 But this added complication does not crucially affect our argument here.) Once this is understood, we can see that an instrumental voice can maintain its identity while mediating another voice, because the identity of the instrument (or instruments, or register) may be preserved, even when what the instrument plays belongs in some sense to someone else, to another voice. But how can an instrumental voice appropriate the "speech" of another voice? This can happen only when what the instrument plays has been "said" or played earlier, by someone or something else, in the same piece or in a different one, in or outside of music, that is, when the instrumental voice literally quotes from, or less-than- literally alludes to, someone else's "speech." Also in literature, quota- tion and allusion, like all mediated speech, are intrinsically and ines- capably diegetic: I quote or allude to (mediate) in the present what someone else said in the past. A quotation or allusion comes always with the explicit or implied diegetic tag: "said X." Through the gates 2 Der blofe Klang stellt ein Wir als musikalisches Subjekt vor .. " Adorno, op. cit., 226.

The less literal the allusion, the more ambiguous its status. The borderline between allusion and non-allusion is not razor-sharp, and in interpreting what a voice says we should resist the temptation of trying to decide the undecidable cases. It is useless, for instance, to appeal to the author's intention, since, on the one hand, an allusion may be involuntary and, on the other, it may be unsuccessfully realized. Both quotation and allusion, that is, one voice's appropriation of another voice's specific individual utterance, must be distinguished from the much more common, inescapable even, use of generalized features of a language, style, or genre by the voice. The latter does not have the diegetic structure. Whether in language, painting, or music, there is no such thing as a perfectly individual utterance. In speaking we must always use a language which is not of our own making. It does not follow that, as Heidegger seems to suggest on occasion, it is not we but language that speaks, that an utterance can never be in- dividual (we can and do sometimes say something new and we can even, rarely, extend the limits of the language), but only that the individuality can be no more than relative.26 But neither should we 26 Cf., e.g., the following passages: "Darnach ["die Vorstellung von der Sprache ..., die seit Jahrtausenden herrscht"] ist die Sprache der vom Menschen vollzogene Ausdruck innerer Gemitsbewegungen und der sie leitenden Weltansicht.

("According to this idea [i.e., "the notion of language that has prevailed for thousands of years"] language is the expression, produced by men, of their feelings and the world view that guides them.

Thus far we have considered only one voice's appropriation of another voice's "speech." But, in literature at least, self-quotation and -allusion are also possible and they too have the diegetic structure: I quote "now" what I said in another "now." Are they also possible in music? Let us observe that in cases of both literary and musical self- quotation or -allusion the matter quoted or alluded to would have to be internal to the given work (though this might consist of several parts or movements), since the "speaking self" retains its identity only within the boundaries of the work; it would make little sense to claim that the narrator of one novel is "the same" as that of another novel, or that the first violin represents "the same voice" in all string quar- tets. (One might think that a literary voice that portrays a real person constitutes an exception, since here the identity of the speaker might be taken to transcend the limits of the work. But in fact it is the identity of the portrayed model that transcends the limits of the work, not the identity of the speaker.) This distinction apart, self-quotation and -allusion are no different in character from other kinds of quo- tation and allusion and are equally possible in music as they are in literature. The big difference between the two arts in this respect is quanti- tative. Music tolerates and thrives on an incomparably greater amount of immediate repetition, recapitulation (as a return of the same or similar material after an intervening discourse is technically called), and elaboration (such as variation or development) of the material than literature. In a sense, music compensates in this way for its lack of those features (such as the tenses or deictic temporal adverbs) that commonly establish the diegetic mode in literature. One might object here that to treat, say, an immediate and exact repetition of a phrase as a case of (self-)quotation and to attribute to and master of language, while in fact language remains the master of man....

Bakhtin, "Discourse in the Novel."</page><page sequence="21">BERGER it the diegetic structure stretches both the notion of quotation and that of diegesis beyond acceptable limits. And yet, whether or not we call such a case quotation, its diegetic structure is undeniable. Even the simplest immediate repetition of a statement (whether in music or literature, no matter) differs fundamentally from the original state- ment in that, while the latter calls only for the recognition that some- thing is said in the "now"' of the present speaker, the former addi- tionally requires that we recognize that this something has already been said before in the "now" of the then-speaker (again, it does not matter whether the two speakers are the same or two different voices). Because the practices of repetition, recapitulation, and elaboration are so widespread in music, musical voices very frequently acquire the narrating character: in addition to speaking and presenting them- selves "now," they mediate something said (by themselves or by other voices) in another "now," that is, they present themselves as well as something belonging to a world different from the one they them- selves belong to. The important task for a critic is to distinguish truly interesting cases of diegetic utterance in music from these ubiquitous and hence rather trivial practices. This task, however, can be accom- plished only on a case-by-case basis, as there seems to be no general rule to follow here. Our discovery of the diegetic dimension of quotation and allusion forces us to backtrack for a moment and consider whether these are possible also in painting. Here literal quotation or less-than-literal allusion have the structure of someone or something appearing im- mediately in the picture and at the same time mediating the appear- ance of someone or something else, someone or something belonging to a different world, someone or something that had appeared before somewhere else, in another picture, or in reality. Thus in Idouard Manet's Portrait of Emile Zola (1868, Musde d'Orsay, Paris), the repro- duction of Manet's Olympia (1863, Musde d'Orsay, Paris) attached to the wall of Zola's study is a quotation: the rectangular piece of paper marked with lines and colors that immediately appears in the portrait mediates the image we may have seen before. The image of the Pa- risian prostitute herself, as it immediately appears in Manet's Olympia, alludes to (mediates) a specific earlier image of the Olympian goddess of love, that appearing immediately in Titian's Venus of Urbino (1538- 39, Uffizi, Florence). As always, the distinction between quotation and allusion is not razor-sharp. It is, rather, the difference in the degree of literalness with which an earlier image is mediated by a later one. Five observations are in order here. First, while what a quotation or allusion refers to may be by itself outside the world of the work, the quotation or allusion inducts it, so to speak, into the world of the work. If in interpreting this world we do not notice, or disregard, the 427</page><page sequence="22">428 THE JOURNAL OF MUSICOLOGY quotation or allusion, we miss a feature of the world we interpret, not something external to it. "Intertextuality" is not an optional feature of reading, it is of essence. A reader who, upon scanning a Wall Street Journal headline "April is the cruellest month," thinks only of the recession bottoming out notices less of what is out there than one whose thoughts of the recession are accompanied by a grander vision of a decaying civilization. Second, a portrayal of a real person or object is clearly a species of "quotation/allusion" in the enlarged sense in which these terms are used here. It differs from the other kind of quotation/allusion in that what it quotes or alludes to exists in reality rather than in the pictorial tradition. In this sense, in Manet's Zola the image of the writer himself is no less a quotation than is the image of Manet's Olympia. By the same token, also a literary portrayal of a real person, event, or object (as in a work of a biographer or historian) is a species of quotation/ allusion: also here someone or something present in the world of the literary work mediates the appearance of someone or something else that belongs to another, real world. Music may similarly quote or allude to sounds of the real world (think of the revolver shots or the clicking of the typewriter in Erik Satie's ballet rdaliste of 1917, Parade). Third, just as in literature and music, also in painting the quota- tion or allusion mediates a specific individual appearance, not a sty- listic or generic type. In Western painting a reclining female nude inscribes itself into the tradition of Venus representations, but only some of these images have diegetic structure, namely, those that, like Manet's Olympia, allude to a specific individual earlier image within the tradition, and not to the tradition in general. Fourth, not only a part of a picture, but the picture as a whole can instantiate a quotation or rather allusion (a literal quotation in such cases would be no more than a copy or reproduction). Francis Bacon's obsessive variations on the subject of Diego Velizquez's Portrait of Pope Innocent X (165o, Galleria Doria-Pamphili, Rome) belong here. The phenomenon can also occur in a variety of forms in other arts (think of Beethoven's Diabelli Variations, Liszt's transcriptions of Schubert's songs, even of the transformations the Odyssey undergoes in the Ulysses.). Note that also here, at least in painting and literature, a "quotation/allusion" can refer not only to another artwork, but also to a fragment of the real world: this is the case of the Velizquez portrait itself as well as of any historical narrative. Fifth, in painting self-quotation or -allusion can occur only when the same figure or object appears in the picture or series of pictures more than once and we have reasons to believe that the figure or ob- ject truly "is the same" rather than merely "looks the same." Identical</page><page sequence="23">BERGER columns of a painted facade do not quote one another, but a figure of a saint in a series of pictures illustrating his life does refer to other appearances of the same figure in other pictures of the series. (Sim- ilarly, identical accompanimental figures of the so-called Alberti bass do not quote one another, but a recapitulated musical theme does refer to other, earlier, appearances of the same theme within the work.) It is clear that self-quotation/allusion is incomparably less com- mon in painting than it is in music or even literature. We may come back now for a moment to the question we had been pursuing a while ago: can an instrumental voice narrate? We have seen that the diegetic mode does not require that the narrative voice come into focus as a human figure. All that is needed is the hierarchical relationship between the two presented worlds. In think- ing about the diegetic potential of instrumental music further, beyond what is implied by quotations and allusions, we should take a hint from painting. It is here that we may learn to distinguish truly inter- esting cases of diegetic utterance in music from the relatively trivial ones produced by the widespread practices of repetition, recapitula- tion, and elaboration. What is certainly possible in instrumental music is an internal frame separating the discourse into two parts, one out- side and the other within the frame. Composers have at their disposal a whole range of punctuating devices, such as cadences of various strength, with which to articulate their musical discourses. They can easily interrupt a discourse with an interpolation of any length only to resume the main train of thought later.8 However, just as in abstract painting, also in instrumental music it is impossible to decide with complete certainty whether what we have outside and within the in- ternal frame are two different worlds or a single one. All that we can say is that the more interpolations of this sort differ from the dis- course they interrupt, the stronger the suggestion of the diegetic mode. In Liszt's piano transcription of Schubert's setting of the "Erl- kanig," the final recitative contrasts so strongly with the preceding gallop that, even without Goethe's text in our ears, we are likely to z8 See, e.g., the illuminating discussion of a large-scale interpolation interrupting the first movement of Robert Schumann's piano Phantasie in C Major, Op. 17 in John Daverio, "Schumann's 'Im Legendenton' and Friedrich Schlegel's Arabeske," 19th- Century Music XI (1987), 150-63. A small-scale interpolation of this kind, occurring in the first movement of Ludwig van Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 2 in B-flat Major, Op. 19, is discussed in my "Toward a History of Hearing: The Classic Concerto, A Sample Case," W.J. Allanbrook, J. M. Levy, and W. P. Mahrt, eds., Convention in Eighteenth- and Nineteenth-Century Music. Essays in Honor of Leonard G. Ratner (Stuyvesant, NY, 1992), 4o5-29. It is striking that in Abbate's Unsung Voices, the most sustained discussion of musical diegesis we have, all of the key examples involve some sort of interruption of the main discourse. 429</page><page sequence="24">430 THE JOURNAL OF MUSICOLOGY read it as an appearance of a new world suddenly pushing the old one into the distance. But without Goethe's "war" ("was") instead of "ist" ("is"), we cannot be absolutely sure that what has been introduced is a truly new ontological level. Let us keep in mind, however, that we are not compelled to sacrifice illuminating interpretations of artworks to the inappropriate requirement of complete certainty. Thus, with some ingenuity, we can find analogues of the diegetic mode in painting and music. Specifically, we have just seen that in both figurative and abstract painting, quotation/allusion-understood in the broad sense introduced above-make the pictorial "voice" di- egetic; otherwise, in figurative painting the diegetic mode is possible (if we have a picture-within-picture) and so is the personage of the narrator (if we have a human figure gesturing toward the picture- within-picture); in abstract painting the diegetic mode is, strictly speaking, not possible (though an internal frame may bring it to mind) and so in any case is the narrator; in both vocal and instru- mental music, quotation/allusion make the musical voice diegetic; otherwise, in vocal music both the diegetic mode and the narrator are possible, imported directly from literature with the text; and in in- strumental music the diegetic mode is, strictly speaking, not possible (though, again, an internal frame may bring it to mind) and so in any case is the narrator. Thus not only in literature, but also in painting and music, we are apt to encounter personages and settings, or- more abstractly-figures and grounds, as well as narrators. Note that in all three arts all the immediately speaking voices, that is, all of the mode of presentation, are at the same time-as person- ages, settings, and narrators (or their analogues)--at least a part (or all) of the presented matter. It follows that there is nothing that we might say about the mode of an artwork that we had not already said about its matter (assuming we had described the latter correctly and with precision). Thus, at the end of our analysis of the modes of artistic presentation, the modes themselves dissolve into the matter. This is not to say that the distinction between the presenting voices and the presented matter is invalid, but only that once the presented matter has been correctly and precisely described, the presenting voices have been described too. Nevertheless, whether we consider them "modal" or "material," the following two distinctions are of fundamental importance. First, the presence (or absence) of the narrating voice imprints an indelible mark on the text and the world it presents. Diegetic texts are self- reflexive in a different degree than dramatic ones.29 The essential 29 On self-reflexive texts, cf. Lucien Dillenbach, The Mirror in the Text (Chicago, 1989).</page><page sequence="25">BERGER way for a drama to become self-reflexive is to present a theatrical performance on stage (theater-within-theater), thus to become self- referential and to invite reflection on its own nature. Shakespeare is the master of dramatic self-reflexivity of this kind, in Hamlet and, above all, in The Tempest.So Picture-within-picture has clearly the same potential import, and so does music-within-music; they invite reflec- tion on the nature of visual and aural presenting as well as on seeing and hearing. This kind of explicit self-reflexivity is, of course, avail- able also to diegetic texts. But if the dramatic self-reflexivity is explicit and optional, the diegetic splitting of the presented world into two ontological levels introduces its own kind of implicit or explicit, but not optional, self-reflexivity, simply because it necessarily presents us with a world-within-world, the narrated world embedded within the world of the narrator. The more prominently the world and the figure of the narrator step forward, the more explicitly self-reflexive is the narrative. This is why the narrative self-reflexivity reaches its zenith in autobiography, whether "historical" (St. Augustine, Rous- seau, Goethe) or "fictional" (Dante, Proust), where reflections on the narrating self and on the act of narrating are inextricably enmeshed. At the same time, the presence of the narrating voice introduces distance between the reader/viewer/listener and the presented world, makes the latter less immediate, because-literally-mediated by the narrating voice. This diegetic distance is the obverse side of the di- egetic self-reflexivity. Its result is to make the mediated-that is, imaginary-nature of the presented world more explicit. In thus lay- ing their cards on the table diegetic texts are inherently less illusion- istic and potentially more truthful than dramatic ones, not necessarily more truthful to the portrayed reality, to be sure, but more truthful about their own mediated nature. Hence it is no wonder that the diegetic mode is favored by historians. Second, the presence (or absence) of the personage within the world of the artwork makes a difference to the character of this world. The figure and the ground, the personage and the setting, belong together and define one another. It is obvious that the setting can never be truly completely absent, though it may be extremely atten- uated and implicit; the figure has to emerge from somewhere, though this "somewhere" may be the indistinct dark background of a portrait or the silence against which the melodic lines of unaccompanied po- lyphony, or the voice of the lyric "I" speaking of nothing but its own state of mind, are heard. It would seem, however, that the personage can be absent, most commonly perhaps in such pictorial genres as the 30so On self-reflexivity in The Tempest, see my "Prospero's Art," Shakespeare Studies X (1977), 211-39. 431</page><page sequence="26">432 THE JOURNAL OF MUSICOLOGY still-life and the landscape, but also in literary descriptions that in- volve no personages, or in music that dispenses with lines. But is it truly absent, or-like the setting at times-only attenuated and im- plicit? Is it possible that not only the figure implies a ground, but also the reverse? The admittedly speculative claim I would like to make is that those presented worlds from which a personage is absent present, precisely though paradoxically, an absent personage. The claim can- not be tested and is unfalsifiable and hence unprovable. It can be understood only as an interpretative postulate or wish designed to ensure that even the presented worlds from which personages are absent can serve the art's aim of human self-presentation, -imagining, and -knowledge. We want the presented world to be not just any world, but Lebenswelt, the world of man. A still-life is full of human fingerprints, the presented objects bear witness to man's purposes, use, and solicitude. A landscape, even one presenting a wilderness, is a potential scene of human dwelling and acting, even when this acting takes the highly refined form of contemplation of natural beauty. In thus implying (presenting) an (absent) personage, artistic pre- sentations of the setting come close in their cultural significance to the non-representational arts, first and foremost to architecture. While the meaning of the architectural work cannot be reduced to its utili- tarian function, it can be grasped only if the work is seen as a potential setting for man, for a particular way of life, a scene of human actions and passions the full range of which, while not unlimited (the range of behavior appropriate at Grand Central Station is clearly different from that befitting the San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane), cannot be delimited and specified with any precision in advance.3' The only difference between a Lebenswelt presented, say, in a painting from which personages are absent and one designed by the architect is that while the former is, precisely, presented, that is, imaginary and hence apt to be peopled by the spectator with imaginary figures, the latter is real and hence provides a setting for real people, the spectator in- cluded. But let us not misjudge the exact significance of this differ- ence. When we experience and interpret a building as a suitable scene for certain ways of life (that of a suburban commuter, say, or a meta- physical poet), we people the building with more or less distinctly imagined figures, that is, figures no less imaginary than those that might have just left the scene of a Chardin still-life. The difference is only that, somewhat more directly than the representational arts, ar- chitecture invites us to imagine ourselves as pursuing certain ways of life, to put on masks and rehearse imaginary roles. For a dizzying 31 Cf. Roger Scruton, The Aesthetics of Architecture (Princeton, 1979).</page><page sequence="27">BERGER moment afforded by aesthetic experience, the work of architecture, the most real of all artistic objects, invites us to shed our own reality and to transform ourselves into imaginary beings. But the difference with the representational arts is one of degree only, and a small de- gree at that. The imaginary worlds presented by poets, painters, and composers also invite us to enter them; they are only somewhat less insistent, or make it less easy for us to accept the invitation.3 Stanford University s2 I would like to thank Kendall Walton for his very illuminating comments on this paper. 433</page></plain_text>
