<plain_text><page sequence="1">Plant Cuttings Annals of Botany 108: iv- vi, 2011 Available online at www.aob.oxfordjournals.org News in Botany: Nigel Chaffey presents a round-up of plant-based items from the world's media Plants on the prowl Plants are not noted for their dynamic lifestyles. Indeed, rooted in the soil as they tend to be, they are usually written off as little more than 'stick in the muds'. But their sedentary lifestyle is not always so sedentary; plants can travel great distances. With the obvious exception of tumbleweeds (http://en. wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumbleweed), plants are adept at recruiting other agencies to give them a helping hand to spread far and wide, as some recent researches reveal. Technically, tumbleweeds are 'diaspores' (http://en. wikipedia.org/wild/Diaspore_%28botany%29), which pleasingly and semantically gets us to diaspora - 'dispersal' - (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaspora) of plants, the subject of this contribution. First, hygrochasy (http://en.wikipedia. org/wiki/Hygrochasy): dehiscence that occurs upon wetting is a particularly dramatic example of exploitation of an abiotic factor to spread the genes. Although widely believed to be an adaptation to dry environments, Gedsien Pufal and colleagues have extended that notion to the alpine habitat of New Zealand ( American Journal of Botany 97: 1413-1423, 2010). Investigating 23 Veronica spp., they identified hygrochasy in ten and propose that it provides an effective iv seed-dispersal mechanism for the solitary capsules embedded in cushion plants and helps to restrict dispersal within established habitat patches. With a related water theme we have the intriguing relationship between a frugivorous fish - Colossoma macropomum - and icythochorous plants of Amazonia (increasing your word power or what!). The fish enter the flood plains of the world's longest river (that flows into the Atlantic Ocean . . . http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Longest_river) and consume 'massive quantities of fallen fruits and egest viable seeds', according to Jill Anderson et al. ( Proceedings of the Royal Society B' doi: 10. 1098/ rspb.201 1.0155). Recording a maximum dispersal distance of 5495 m, it is likely that the fish play a major role in seed-spread of several species in this aquatic habitat. However, the fish is over-fished, which may disrupt this ancient co-evolutionary relationship with knock-on effects to this weird and wonderful watery world. However, as impressive as those water transport figures are, the long-distance record probably has to go to air travel. Although stretching the definition of plant movement to its limit, work by Juan José Robledo- Arnuncio (New Phytologist 190: 222-233, 2011) shows that pollen from Pinus sylvestris can travel an impressive 100 km (and maybe more . . . ).</page><page sequence="2">Which is good news for 'normal' plants, but what about the concerns of those who fear pollen from GM plants might 'escape' and contaminate non-GM neighbours? Well, good news from Yasuyuki Yoshimura ( Journal of Plant Research 124: 109-114, 2011), who concluded that airborne pollen from GM soya was minimal and any released was restricted to a small area around the plants. Unfortunately, soya is not wind-pollinated, so the jury is probably still out in the case of anemophilous crops such as cereals. Finally, and taking plant movement to anthropomorphic extremes, there is the intriguingly entitled 'walking cactus' (http://www.physorg. com/news/20 1 1 -02-cactus-rewrites-arthropod-odyssey.html ) . Sadly, it's not a bipedal botanic but a nickname for a recently discovered animal believed to be the closest-known fossil relative to modern arthropods. So we can't say any more about it here . . .

Notwithstanding the centuries we've spent peering at, poking, prodding and penetrating the inner workings of plant cells with various types of microscopes and decades undertaking investigations at the sub-cellular level, there are still new discoveries to be made. Here are two, united by the theme of cell-cell transport, rirst, the recent revelation Dy ue Doran Barton et al. ( The Plant Journal 66: 806-817, 2011) that small molecules - up to 10-4 kDa in size - can move between adjacent plant cells via the plasmodesmata. No, that's not the news, the novelty is the fact that this transport took place within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, which extends between adjacent cells and constitutes the desmotubule, a feature within the plasmodesma itself. Investigating Nicotiana trichomes and Tradescantia epidermides using a fluorescent technique, the group propose that the ER lumen of plant cells is continuous with that of their neighbours, and allows movement of small ER-luminal molecules between cells. All of which adds more intrigue to these curious plant-specific cell-cell portals (http://en. wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodesmata). And second, that favourite feature of root anatomists, the Casparian strip (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casparian_strip), which has just given up some of its secrets. This famous endodermal wall structure acts as a barrier to apoplastic ('extracellular') movement of materials within the root and 'forces' those solutes across the semi-permeable barrier that is the plasma membrane of the endodermal cells and to follow a symplastic transport pathway. Until now it was unknown why the strip forms where it does, but Daniele Roppolo and co-workers C Nature 473: 380-383, 2011) appear to have solved that puzzle with their identification of CASPs (Casparian strip membrane domain proteins). CASPs specifically mark a membrane domain that predicts the formation of Casparian strips in the endodermal cells and are considered to be the first molecular factors that are shown to establish a plasma membrane and extracellular diffusion barrier in plants. And a timely reminder of the pivotal role that plant cell biology still plays in botanical science is provided by Simon Gilroy's article entitled 'Plant cell biology: with grand challenges come great possibilities' ( Frontiers in Plant Science ē, doi: 10.3389/fpls.201 1.00003).

I Date sex - XY marks the spot Dates, the sticky, sweet fruits of the date palm ( Phoenix dactylifera ), are the product of sexual reproduction in that plant and borne on the female plants of this dioecious species. Globally, about 15 million metric tonnes of dates are produced annually from 100 million date palm trees and represent a staple food in many Middle Eastern and North African nations. Given this economic importance it is important to know if an individual tree is male or female. Up to now breeders have had to wait for 5 years before they could tell the sex of a tree. That process is likely to be speeded up dramatically with the discovery by Eman Al-Dous et al. (Nature Biotechnology ; doi:10.1038/nbt.l860) of sequences of the genome that are linked to gender. The work, which represents the first genome sequence of a member of the palm family (Arecaceae) - and, indeed, of the higher taxonomie ranking, the order Arecales - has also identified genetic markers likely to facilitate breeding of traits such as superior fruit quality and more convenient ripening times into the best current cultivars. The group also propose that the date palm employs an XY system of gender inheritance, similar to that used by humans. In case you were wondering, parthenocarpy is known in this species, but the seedless fruit is smaller and of lower quality than the sexually produced product (http:// en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_%28fruit%29#Food_uses).

The Open Access online Frontiers in Plant Science , which 'welcomes outstanding contributions in any field of plant science from applied to basic research, from organismic to molecular studies, from single plant analysis to studies of whole ecosystems, and from biochemical to computational approaches' was launched in 2010 and is currently into its 2nd volume (http://www.frontiersin.org/ plant_science/about). Its 12 specialty botanical sections cover Cell Biology; Evolution and Development; Genetics and Genomics; Nutrition; Physiology; Proteomics; Traffic and Transport; Plant-Microbe Interactions; Functional Plant Ecology; Virology; Biotechnology; and Technical Advances in Plant Science. It accepts so-called tier 1 articles - Book Reviews, Editorials, General Commentaries, Hypotheses &amp; Theories, Methods, Mini Reviews, Opinions, Original Research, Perspectives, Reviews, Specialty Grand Challenges and Technology Reports. With the added bonus that authors of the highest impact (as judged by 'many expert readers') tier 1 Original Research paper will be invited to submit a 'prestigious Frontiers Focused Review' - a tier 2 article - in which the original article is re- written in a review style to address the journal's wider audience across all of plant science. Ultimately, this democratic tiering (http://www. frontiersin.org/about/tieringsystem) is envisaged to have four tiers, each iteration of the original paper being further distilled and re-worked so as to reach the broadest readership. From an interesting publishing idea in one of the newest phytological journals to free stuff from a firmly established plant science publication. The April 201 1 issue of The Plant Journal is devoted to 'The Plant Genome: An Evolutionary View on Structure and Function'</page><page sequence="3">(http://onlinelibrary.wiley.eom/doi/10.l 1 1 l/tpj.201 1.66.issue- 1/issuetoc). In the words of the journal itself, 'The genome sequences of more than ten plant species are already available, and the pace is greatly accelerating. But what do these sequences tell us about what makes a plant a plant? The series of articles in this special issue . . . presents a comprehensive overview of how this wealth of information can help us understand what plant genomes consist of, how they are maintained and transmitted, what functions they specify, and how these evolved to encompass the enormous diversity we encounter nowadays in the plant kingdom'. Special mention must be made of the contribution entitled 'Organisation of the plant genome in chromosomes' by the Annals' very own Pat Heslop-Harrison, and Trude Schwarzachen Happy reading!

Now - apparently - it takes only one application (or 'app' in modern parlance). Or such seems to be the intention behind Leafsnap (http://leafsnap.com/), the first in a planned series of electronic field guides being developed by researchers from Columbia University, the University of Maryland, and the Smithsonian Institution in the USA. Using software originally developed to recognise human faces, the 'app' (which is free!) identifies tree species from photographs of their leaves. In addition to an identification, Leafsnap provides photographs and information about the tree's flowers, fruit, seeds and bark. But before you rush to sell your CTW (or whatever passes for the equivalent of that venerable tome today in the UK and elsewhere; http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/ item5707744/?site_locale=en_GB), be advised; the app so far only works for trees in New York City and Washington, DC (though the developers have their sights set on the trees of the entire continental USA). Beyond the gimmicky nature of the tool is a more serious exercise. As people use Leafsnap, the app automatically shares their images, species identifications and the tree's location with a community of scientists who will use the information to map and monitor population growth and decline of trees nationwide. For those of us new to the world of the app, there is a video that demonstrates how to use the tool at http://www.youtube.com/ watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=KCpR4JTEy4c&amp; gl=GB. And for the technically minded, the app is available for the iPhone, with iPad and Android versions to be released later this summer (http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-05- iphone-field-visual.html). Not wishing to sound cynical at all, doesn't this seem a bit like scanning an item at the supermarket to get its price? How much real learning of the species will result? Will it lead to a more ID-literate generation? Or is the process too reliant on the technology and getting further divorced from the up-close-and-personal hands-on involvement that's needed to really appreciate the finer details of species' identification? In which case doesn't this begin to sound like a version of DNA barcoding (http:// en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_barcode) that was in vogue a few years ago and very much - for some! - the bogey-man of the time? Still, if this app helps to increase and improve ID skills I cautiously welcome it. Image: Jorge Quinteros, Wikimedia Commons. And the winner is . . . ...well, it's not a plant! And how predictable! The Top 10 new species of 2010 includes no plants (http://species.asu. edu/ToplO). However, before all readers of this column jointly and severally get incensed, we must ask the obvious question: were any new plants discovered in 2010? Let me see: oh yes, there were! In fact, 'On average, 2,000 new plant species are discovered each year and a small selection can be seen on the RBG Kew site at http://www.kew.org/news/science-conservation-news/ discovery/discovered-2010/index.htm. So, why were there no plants - and here I mean proper plants, members of the Kingdom Plantae - in the top 10? Are plants not photogenic? Are they not useful? Were would we be without them? Why are they so unappreciated? Is it that they don't move? (See first article in this month's collection if still in doubt!) In the so-called top 10 were a large monitor lizard, a jumping cockroach, Titanic-eating bacterium, a duiker (type of antelope), Darwin's Bark Spider, a T. rex leech, a pancake batfish, a mushroom that fruits underwater, and a bioluminescent fungus. I suppose the fungi have the virtue of being 'not animals'. The lizard is frugivorous so at least has a plant association, as does the no-doubt herbivorous duiker. The only organism with anything like half-decent plant credentials is the pollinating cricket (http://species.asu.edu/ 2011_species05; whose pollinating activity was announced to the world in an article in this very journal: Annals of Botany 105: 355-364, 2010), but which was dismissively described as a 'pollinating cockroach' in the news item at http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-05-scientists-species. html! That notwithstanding, this top 10 is pure phytophobia and will not - indeed, must not - be tolerated. So, I urge you all to get voting now for the 2012 list of the top 10 new species from 2011 at http://species.asu.edu/species- nomination, and let's try to get a plant into the top 10! Maybe next year might be better anyway because the USE (the University of Arizona's International Institute for Species Exploration), the organisation that runs the top 10, has recently been partnered by AIPC (the Italian Carnivorous Plants Association). Why might this help? Well, a new pitcher plant Nepenthes attenboroughii (pictured above) was one of the previous year's top 10 new species (http://species. asu.edu/2010_species01). And at least carnivorous plants do something . . . Finally, for those who'd like to see the 'pollinating cockroach' in action, the USE helpfully provide a 'click here' link (http://news.bbc.co.Uk/l/hi/8391540.stm) 'to see video of the cricket pollinating the orchid provided by the BBC' [one imagines it will also pollinate orchids provided by other news agencies(!)].
