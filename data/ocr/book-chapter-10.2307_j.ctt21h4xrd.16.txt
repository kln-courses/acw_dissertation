Translated by Gabriel Wasserman  and the author. This article is dedicated to my friend Professor Avraham Grossman, an  outstanding Jewish historian who deserves the highest regard not only  for his intellectual achievements, but also for his exceptional personal  qualities. As I already noted twenty years ago, he has taught us how to  express differences of opinion with humility, impelled by the quest for  truth for its own sake, and with a sense of respect for others.1 In this  essay, I set out to examine the positions of two outstanding historians  with a special place in my life. Gerson Cohen was my doctoral advisor  and primary mentor in the field of history, and I personally heard him  espouse the well-known thesis at issue here before it reached its printed  form. I still remember my reaction at the time: I was taken aback by his  claim, which opposed my immediate instincts regarding the relationship  between rationalism and messianic movements. But I also remember  my growing sense of admiration as I came to understand the ingenuity  and depth of his proposal.2 Some years ago, Elisheva Carlebach, who  studied with me as she began the process that ultimately led to her  1 David Berger, “Heqer Rabbanut Ashkenaz ha-Qedumah,” Tarbiz 53 (1984): 479. 2 Cohen’s article has been published four times: Gerson D.

No one can disagree that the topic in question is of great  importance, and I believe that the arguments on both sides deserve  careful examination. Because I have such great respect for both the  originator of the thesis and its critic, the chances that I will not slip  into inappropriate formulations are greater that they might normally  be, but it is not superfluous to express the hope that the image of the  honoree will provide all the more protection.  What is it that Cohen claims in his article? He argues that there is  a striking, almost polar, opposition between medieval Sepharad and  Ashkenaz with regard to the issue of messianism. In Sepharad, we find  lively discussions of messianism in the writings of commentators and  intellectuals, as well as popular messianic movements. In Ashkenaz, on  the other hand, there is no discussion or discourse, no ferment and no  messiahs. Cohen strives to prove these assertions, and then to arrive at  an explanation for the phenomenon itself. He begins his analysis with the usual scholarly assumption that  Ashkenazic Jewry had a strong connection to the Palestinian tradition,  whereas Sephardic Jewry’s connection was to Babylonia. Thence he  proceeds to examine these two centers of early medieval Jewry, Palestine  and Babylonia, for the first signs of the contrast between Ashkenazic  and Sephardic attitudes toward messianism. In the Persian/Byzantine  era and the beginning of the Muslim era, we find apocalyptic literature  in Palestine, but no active messianic movements. Cohen’s understanding  is that this literature owes its existence to a sublimation of messianic  energy from the world of action into the world of the imagination, to  the point where it can even be viewed as a contrast to active messianism.  On the other hand, Babylonia in the same period produced a number of  movements with messianic characteristics, even including violent and  quasi-military elements. In Cohen’s opinion, this difference between the two centers persisted  throughout the Middle Ages. In the realm of straightforward activism,  we can identify about a dozen messianic figures between 1065 and  1492, all of them in the Sephardic cultural orbit. We do find instances  of messianic ferment in Byzantium and Sicily, but these were passing  phenomena in communities that had strong ties to the Middle East. In the  realm of calculations and messianic discourse, we find almost nothing in  Ashkenaz. There is a letter, dated 960, from an Ashkenazic community to  — 290 — </page> <page sequence="3"> Sephardic and Ashkenazic Messianism in the Middle Ages:   the Geonim of the Land of Israel asking about certain messianic matters;  but the curiosity about this topic seems to have been based on reading  Sefer Zerubbavel, and the question about the End of Days is put together  with an entirely different question about kashrut. One of the Crusade  chronicles states that the Jews were hoping that the Messiah would  arrive during the 256th cycle of the Jewish calendar (1085-1104 CE),  based on Jeremiah 31:6: “Ronnu le-Ya’akov simhah” (“sing with gladness  for Jacob”) where the numerical value of the first word, ronnu, is 256);  however, this number reflects a calculation from a late Byzantine midrash.  Rashi’s calculations in his commentary on the Book of Daniel actually  illustrate a lack of messianic enthusiasm, since the effort to calculate the  End was forced upon him by exegetical necessity and the dates that he  proposes point to a redemption that is to be delayed for generations. In  the last years of the fifth millennium (which ended in the Jewish year  5000, corresponding to 1240 CE), some prophecies of the imminent End  begin to appear in Ashkenaz, but this is an atypical phenomenon whose  character is entirely different from the rationalistic calculations produced  by Sephardim. Similarly, the calculations attested in Ashkenaz tend to  be based on innovative numerical equivalencies (gimatriyyot), which  reflect a very different way of thinking from the calculations used by the  Sephardic intellectuals. Finally, the migration of French rabbis to the Land  of Israel in the thirteenth century emerged out of considerations that  were essentially unconnected to messianic hopes. Let us now look at Sepharad through Cohen’s lens. There, we see many  calculations of the End of Days, based on rationalistic interpretations  of biblical verses or rabbinic statements, on historical typology, and on  astrological investigation, which was considered a scientific field of study  in the Middle Ages. (Maimonides’ opposition to astrology was atypical  even among philosophers.) Interest in the End of Days and the date  when it will occur appears in the letter of Hasdai ibn Shaprut to the  King of the Khazars; in the writings of Avraham bar Hiyya, Solomon  ibn Gabirol, and Judah Halevi; in Abraham ibn Daud’s Book of Tradition  (Sefer ha-Qabbalah); in Maimonides’ Epistle to Yemen; in Nahmanides’  Book of the Redemption (Sefer ha-Ge’ullah); and in the diverse writings of  Isaac Abravanel. Cohen connects messianic calculations and even the rise of messianic  movements to rationalist modes of thought. As I have noted, I initially  recoiled from this assertion; after all, our instincts do not take well to  — 291 — </page> <page sequence="4"> Yearning for Redemption a position which states that rationalism creates activism that appears  contrary to common sense. However, Cohen explains the logic of this  argument. The Sephardic rationalist was convinced that God governs the  universe in accordance with principles that can be grasped by reason,  whereas the Ashkenazic scholar did not presume to understand God’s  mind. Therefore, the Sephardic rationalist was able to delve into the  complexities of the unfolding historical drama, and his intellectual  efforts along these lines encouraged actual messianic movements among  the masses. The Ashkenazic scholar was forced to wait until the time that  God Himself would decide to redeem His people and His universe, and in  an environment that was not suffused with concern about messianism,  the masses, too, did not become caught up in messianic movements.  In the best-case situation, an Ashkenazic Jew who yearned very much  for the redemption might hope for a prophetic experience from God, or  might attempt to interpret the secrets concealed in biblical verses. Moreover, Cohen argues that these distinctions in attitude toward  rationalism and messianism also explain the difference between Ashkenaz  and Sepharad with regard to readiness to undergo martyrdom. The  Jews of Sepharad avoided martyrdom for two basic reasons: first of all,  rationalism weakened their faith to a degree that undermined the inner  strength necessary to sacrifice one’s life; second, they were convinced  that the messiah would soon come, at which point they would be able to  return to Judaism. Finally, in a brief passage that appears almost as an aside, Cohen  makes an important, even revolutionary, point in the historiography of  messianism: persecutions in and of themselves do not produce messianic  movements. Even a scholar who utterly rejects Cohen’s basic positions  must give him credit for the short passage in which he lists the major  persecutions from the Middle Ages through the seventeenth century and  notes that not one of these produced a messianic movement. One might  argue with Cohen’s affirmation with respect to the expulsion from Spain  and the massacres of 1648, but the basic observation remains intact in  all its force, and it appears to stand unchallenged. Cohen’s article became a classic in the academic discussion of Jewish  messianism in the Middle Ages, but there were nonetheless scholars who  rejected his position. Israel Yuval, in his long article on the hatred that  Ashkenazic Jews felt towards Christianity and the implications that he  attributes to this hatred, proffered two arguments against Cohen’s thesis.  — 292 — </page> <page sequence="5"> Sephardic and Ashkenazic Messianism in the Middle Ages:   First of all, if Ashkenazic Jews did not produce the sort of messianic  movements that we find in other centers, this should not be seen as  an expression of passivity. Ashkenazic society considered words very  powerful, and so we should view their bitter curses against the gentiles  and their prayers for vengeance as active messianism. Activism in the  form of movements would have been redundant or perhaps even harmful.  Moreover, Sephardic expressions of messianism in the realm of theory  and calculations appear primarily in speculative philosophical literature,  a genre that barely existed at all in Ashkenaz.3 But a broad and systematic critique of Cohen’s thesis was presented  by Carlebach in a lecture that she delivered in 1998.4 Here, then, is a  summary of her argument: 1 Cohen speaks of “aggressive military activity” in the movements  that arose in Persia in the first centuries of Muslim rule. In fact,  as even Cohen admits in a later article, these movements were  hardly organized, and they had no true military component. 2. Messianism was hardly foreign to Ashkenaz, nor was martyrdom  absent in Sepharad. Furthermore, dying for the faith was not  considered an expression of passivity by medieval Jews, for the  martyrs first tried to save themselves in any way possible. 3. Cohen sees the Ashkenazic position as an expression of passivity  on the part of the rabbinic elite, whereas he sees the active  messianism of Sepharad as “popular.” Thus, he overlooks the  conservative messianism of the Sephardic rabbis from the time of  the Geonim, on to Maimonides, and through R. Jacob Sasportas.  Moreover, movements with messianic characteristics “often”  took place in Ashkenaz under the leadership of the rabbinic elite  itself, thus evincing a character that penetrated to the very core  of communities that identified with its great rabbinic scholars;  on the other hand, the movements in Sepharad often came from  an anti-rabbinic sector. 3 Israel Yuval, “Ha-Naqam ve-ha-Qelalah, ha-Dam ve-ha-Alilah,” Zion 58 (1993): 60. This  passage also appears in Yuval’s book Shenei Goyim be-Bitnekh (Tel-Aviv, 2000), p. 145.  See also note 19, below. 4 Elisheva Carlebach, Between History and Hope: Jewish Messianism in Ashkenaz and  Sepharad: Third Annual Lecture of the Victor J. Selmanowitz Chair of Jewish History,  Graduate School of Jewish Studies, Touro College (New York, 1998). — 293 — </page> <page sequence="6"> Yearning for Redemption 4. The use of the term “Sepharad” to embrace both the movements  that arose on the fringes of Persian Jewry in the seventh century  and the complex calculations born in the elitist environment of  rationalist courtiers in Andalusia is highly dubious. 5. In light of a number of studies made in the past few decades  pointing to cultural contacts between Ashkenaz and Sepharad,  it is becoming clear that the general picture of a deep cultural  divide between the Jewish centers has been exaggerated, and it  is doubtful that we can use it to explain the distinctions that we  are discussing. 6. A central portion of Carlebach’s lecture is devoted to an analysis  of the historiography of two sixteenth-century messianic  movements in the writings of various Ashkenazic and Sephardic  authors: I. Asher Laemmelein: Carlebach points to three Ashkenazic sources and three Sephardic  sources that address this movement. On the Ashkenazic side, David Ganz portrays Laemmelein as the  messiah’s herald, not as the messiah himself. At the same time, he  describes significant messianic fervor in Ashkenaz that was generated  by the news of the movement. An anonymous chronicle from early  seventeenth-century Prague includes a short note about a rumor in  1502 regarding the Messiah that inspired mass acts of repentance. At  the end of the sixteenth century, a student of R. Solomon Luria wrote  that Laemmelein’s influence had extended to Ashkenaz, to Italy, and to  other lands in the Christian world. On the Sephardic side, Gedalya ibn Yahya reports that when  Laemmelein died in an unredeemed world, many Jews apostatized. Yosef  ha-Kohen refers to him with the biblical pronouncement, “The prophet  is a fool, the man of the spirit is insane” (Hosea 9:7), and recounts that  “the Jews flocked to him, and said: ‘This is a prophet, whom God has sent  to be a ruler over his people Israel and to gather the dispersed of Judah  from the four corners of the earth’.” Yosef Sambari, who repeated Yosef  ha-Kohen’s remarks,5 also noted the influence of these events on “the  sinners of Israel,” i.e., the apostates. 5 Carlebach does not note this point, although it would help support her thesis. — 294 — </page> <page sequence="7"> Sephardic and Ashkenazic Messianism in the Middle Ages:   Christian writers who mention Laemmelein’s movement view it,  of course, as yet further evidence of the repeated disappointments  generated by erroneous Jewish imaginings regarding the identity of the  Messiah. Ashkenazic writers willfully ignore the fact that Laemmelein’s  failure led Jews to apostasy. In conclusion, “the historiography of the  movement changes greatly based on the identity of the reporter.” Beyond the historiographical question, Carlebach notes also that  despites Cohen’s refusal to attribute significance to Laemmelein as well  as his hypothesis that he was influenced by Sephardim, Laemmelein’s  recently-published writings, which were not available to Cohen, show  that he was committed to Ashkenazic culture. II. Solomon Molkho: Ashkenazic authors tell the story of this figure only briefly, and tend  to gloss over the messianic aspect. Josel of Rosheim describes Molkho  as a proselyte who caused trouble for the community but also inspired  acts of mass repentance. Rabbi Yom-Tov Lipmann Heller discusses the  ritual fringes (tzitzit) worn by Molkho and classifies him as a martyr,  but not as a messianic claimant. David Ganz writes a brief description  of Molkho with no mention of messianism. The Prague chronicle reports  that there were messianic expectations in the year 1523, but makes no  mention of Molkho. In two Sephardic accounts, which are longer, the messianic moment  in Molkho’s life is mentioned explicitly. Yosef ha-Kohen introduces  Molkho with the expression, “A shoot came forth out of Portugal” (cf.  Isaiah 11:1), which has clear messianic implications. Yosef Sambari  explicitly says that Molkho identified himself as the Messiah. Similarly,  two Christian authors write that Molkho announced that he was the  Messiah. From these data, Carlebach reaches conclusions of decisive  significance for our topic. Ashkenazim write succinct accounts of  messianic events, limiting the messianic aspects of the relevant figures  or ignoring it entirely, for precisely the reason that Christian writers  emphasize it – namely, that any failed messianic movement strengthens  the Christian argument against Judaism. In this context, Carlebach  turns our attention to a comment that I once noted in the name of my  student Avraham Pinsker, to wit, that Ashkenazim may have hesitated  to embrace messianic activism precisely because they lived in a Christian  — 295 — </page> <page sequence="8"> Yearning for Redemption environment, where they were constantly forced to be on the defensive  against faith in a false messiah. His original comment was made with  reference to actual messianic activity, but Carlebach uses it to explain  the historiographical phenomenon. She also points to a passage in Sefer  Hasidim that warns against openness to messianic prophecies that could  bring disgrace to the Jewish community. 7. Carlebach goes on to examine the messianic movements that  did arise in Ashkenaz or related regions: the messianic tension  in Byzantium at the time of the First Crusade; the expectations  surrounding the 256th cycle of the calendar; the messianic  ferment in the decades preceding the year 5000 (1240 CE); the  migrations to the Land of Israel in the thirteenth century; and  messianic expectation in 1337 attributed to Jews by a Christian  Bavarian chronicle in a miracle story dealing with well-poisoning  and host-desecration. She rejects Cohen’s position that we need  not deal with events recounted only in Christian sources, for  the Ashkenazic tendency to downplay such incidents raises the  likelihood that reliable reports will appear only in Christian  writings. In Carlebach’s opinion, all the phenomena in this list show that there  was a significant level of messianic activity in Ashkenaz, to the point  where we can affirm that active expressions of messianic hope were no  less a part of the collective personality of Ashkenazic Jewry than that  of the Sepharadim. Cohen’s thesis reflects a historiographical tradition  hostile to Ashkenazic Jewry. Cohen sees in this Jewry a metaphor for a  rabbinic elite suffused with fundamentalism and intolerance, in contrast  to the scientific spirit that animated Sephardic Jewry. “The true deficiency  of Ashkenaz resided not in its messianic posture, but in its deficient  alignment with the temper of the historian.” Carlebach, like Cohen, was blessed with a sharp mind, broad  knowledge, stylistic precision, broad vision, and intellectual depth. This  debate addresses one of the fundamental issues that faced medieval  Jewry, and it requires serious assessment of the arguments on both sides.  In the remainder of this article, I shall attempt to present the case for a  more modest approach than Cohen’s without fully endorsing Carlebach’s  position. Let us begin with my reservations about Cohen’s arguments. Some of  — 296 — </page> <page sequence="9"> Sephardic and Ashkenazic Messianism in the Middle Ages:   these reservations are identical to Carlebach’s, but most are different. 1. It is true that the Jews of Palestine, who wrote apocalypses in the  first decades of the seventh century, did not form movements that  pointed to any actual individuals as messianic figures; however,  the word “passive” is hardly an appropriate term to characterize  them. These Jews carried out military campaigns alongside the  Persians against Christian Byzantium, and it is quite plausible to  conclude that some of them slaughtered Christians in Mamilla.6  The apocalyptic writings understand these wars as part of the  unfolding drama of the End of Days, and it is hard to see how any  Jew who saw these events could have reject this interpretation.  Even if we assume that not all the Jews who fought in these wars  saw the Persian-Byzantine conflict through a messianic prism, it  is clear that this community was as remote from “passivity” as  East is from West. 2. In light of the Italian origins of Ashkenazic Jewry, Cohen  emphasizes the fact that Josippon, which was written in tenth- century Italy, opposes aggressive activism, but he downplays  the identical position of the Sephardi Abraham ibn Daud.  (Cohen writes that while Ibn Daud did agree with the author of  Josippon on this point, his position did not succeed in curbing the  Sephardic enthusiasm for messianic movements, and Ibn Daud  himself did not refrain from attempting to calculate the End.) 3. Cohen attributes great significance to Hasdai ibn Shaprut’s  letter asking the Khazar king whether he has any information  about the coming of the Messiah. However, when he discusses a  contemporaneous letter from Ashkenaz that contains almost the  identical question, he sees it as nothing more than a meaningless  expression of curiosity. 4. Cohen regards the intensive use of gimatriyyot in messianic  contexts as a sign of the non-rational Ashkenazic mode of thought,  but when he encounters the same approach in the writings of  Abraham bar Hiyya, he views it as a marginal phenomenon. 6 See K. Hilkowitz, “Li-She’elat Hishtattefutam shel Yehudim be-Kibbush Yerushalayim  ‘al Yedei ha-Parsim bi-Shenat 614,” Zion 4 (1939): 307-316; Elliot S. Horowitz, “‘The  Vengeance of the Jews was Stronger than their Avarice’: Modern Historians and the  Persian Conquest of Jerusalem in 614,” Jewish Social Studies 4:2 (1998): 1-39. — 297 — </page> <page sequence="10"> Yearning for Redemption 5. Although Rashi’s date for the End of Days lay far in the future,  we find other calculations in Ashkenaz that point to a date in  the near future. As to Sepharad, despite the general tendency to  provide imminent dates, Nahmanides produced a calculation that  postponed the final End 140 years. 6.  As I have mentioned above, Cohen did not attribute significance  to Laemmelein’s movement, and he hypothesized that it resulted  from Sephardic influence. Carlebach’s criticism of this claim is  fundamentally correct, even though the movement did not arise  in the heartland of Ashkenaz, and dates from the early sixteenth  century. 7.  I agree with Carlebach that the supposed connection between  Sepharad and the peripheral movements in Persia is extremely  tenuous. Moreover, it is highly doubtful that rationalism played  any significant role in seventh-century Persia. Thus, the messianic  ferment there was certainly based on factors that had absolutely  nothing to do with Cohen’s thesis. If the messianic activity in  Sepharad was actually connected to Persia – or “Bablyonia”  – it reflected a tradition that had no connection to scientific  modes of thinking. It is entirely possible that these movements  developed in Persia under Shi‘ite influence (as Israel Friedlaender  noted many years ago), and it is not impossible that some of  the medieval movements – though not all of them – were also  inspired by a similar environment.7 8.  Our list of messianic movements in the Middle Ages is partly  based on the reports of Maimonides in his Epistle to Yemen.  Needless to say, the information which Maimonides had about  these movements came mainly from the Sephardic world. 9.  Although a number of studies have appeared emphasizing the  acts of martyrdom that occurred in the Sephardic sphere, I  believe that we can say that Cohen’s distinction between the two  centers still retains some validity. Nevertheless, the connection  between messianism and the relative reluctance in Sepharad to  7 In a personal conversation, Mark Saperstein has stressed this possibility to me. I think  that many of the parallels suggested by Friedlaender are forced, but some of them are  entirely reasonable. See Israel Friedlaender, “Jewish-Arabic Studies,” JQR .n. s. 1 (1910- 1911):183-205; 2 (1911-1912): 481-516; 3 (1912-1913): 235-300. — 298 — </page> <page sequence="11"> Sephardic and Ashkenazic Messianism in the Middle Ages:   die a martyr’s death is exceedingly tenuous and borders on the  incoherent. On the one hand, Cohen describes a belief marked by  uncertainty, and on the other, he points to a belief so strong that  those who held it were prepared to convert out of firm conviction  that the Messiah would come in the immediate future to save  them from their distressing fate. Moreover, a simple question  arises: Would it really be a good idea to greet the messiah with  the words: “Welcome, my master the king! I am your servant  so-and-so, the apostate”? Although forced apostasy and willing  conversion are hardly the same thing, it is worth mentioning the  debate in Majorca, where a Jew became more-or-less convinced  that Christianity was the true faith, but to be on the safe side, he  decided to remain Jewish for a few more years, until the arrival  of a messianic date that was current at the time.8 Despite all these considerations, I also have serious reservations  about the criticisms of Cohen made by Yuval and Carlebach. There is indeed more than a grain of truth in Yuval’s assertion that  curses and prayers for vengeance can be classified as messianic activism in  a society that views speech as a magical act. However, the Jew in the well- known joke who shouts in the study hall, “Jews! Do something! Recite  Psalms!” does not exactly typify “activism” in the usual sense, even if he  attributes magical impact to the recitation of Psalms. In the final analysis,  Ashkenazic Jews did not make a clear distinction between the “natural”  process generated by the declarations of the Jewish masses and divine  activity on the cosmic plane, so that their prayers and curses—even if  they included a magical element—were essentially requests for divine  mercy. Furthermore, routine messianic “activism” cannot be compared  to messianic movements that arise at discrete moments of history. The  messianic fervor that characterizes movements cannot characterize  quotidian activities, certainly not when these activities involve nothing  more than speech. As to Yuval’s assertion that from a magical perspective,  typical messianic activism would be harmful, the fact remains that even  from this perspective the expected result is the arrival of the Messiah, so  that it is difficult to see any harm in his appearance. A messianic figure  and his followers do not see themselves as pressing for a premature  End of Days. On the contrary, such a figure would assert that the long- 8 Ora Limor, Vikkuah Majorca 1286 (Jerusalem, 1985), volume I, p. 132. — 299 — </page> <page sequence="12"> Yearning for Redemption awaited time has arrived, perhaps precisely because the prayers and  curses have had their effect. We must also note that Yuval’s criticism is  directed only against Cohen’s claim that the Ashkenazic attitude toward  messianism was “passive.” From another perspective, Yuval’s position  actually reinforces Cohen’s analysis since it points to a basic difference  between Sephardic “rationalistic” messianism and a very different sort  of messianism among Ashkenazic Jews. As to Yuval’s observation that there was virtually no speculative  philosophical literature in Ashkenaz, the point itself merits serious  consideration, but we must remember that when Cohen cites Sephardic  materials, he includes letters, commentaries, and Abraham ibn  Daud’s chronicle (or chronography). Moreover, the lack of speculative  philosophical works is due to a considerable extent to precisely what Cohen  emphasized, to wit, the absence of speculative thought of the sort that  would have generated serious analysis of the nature of the messianic era  as well as sustained interest in the questions associated with it, including  the calculation of when that era would begin. The distinctions that Cohen  drew are not neutralized by Yuval’s methodological observations, as  important as the latter may be. The sharp critique in Carlebach’s summary remarks is directed against  a stereotypical anti-Ashkenazic attitude that she attributes to Cohen. In  her view, he adopted a negative image of the Ashkenazic “fundamentalists”  in contrast to the rationalistic heroes of Sepharad. This criticism of Cohen  evokes a stereotype of its own—the image of the broadly educated  historian who respects the Sephardim for their variegated and open culture  and disdains the Ashkenazim because they did not study philosophy and  were caught up in a narrow, limited belief system. I believe that this perception is imprecise. Despite Carlebach’s  assertion that Cohen attributes “a heroic and active profile”9 to the  warring messianism of the Sephardic world, his article nowhere contains  any expression of respect for the putative “military messianism” of the  sects in late seventh-century Persia; he does not present the adherents  of these movements as heroic in any way. As to his overall assessment of  Ashkenaz and Sepharad, there is some basis for Carlebach’s evaluation.  Cohen sees the Ashkenazim as “fundamentalists” and mentions their  belief in anthropomorphism and strange aggadot. His statement, which  9 Carlebach, p. 2. — 300 — </page> <page sequence="13"> Sephardic and Ashkenazic Messianism in the Middle Ages:   Carlebach quotes in her study, that eventually even “some fine Sephardim”  internalized Ashkenazic fundamentalism10 can create the impression that  he wanted to set up a dichotomy between the enlightened Sephardim,  who deserve respect, and the Ashkenazim, who deserve disdain. And  indeed, it is of course true that Cohen himself identified more with the  culture of the medieval Sephardim than that of the medieval Ashkenazim.  Nevertheless, anyone who studied with Cohen will understand that this  formulation was not meant to belittle or mock the Ashkenazim; rather,  all that he meant is that distinguished Sephardim absorbed Ashkenazic  influence. It is true that even in the sixties the term “fundamentalism”  was not a compliment, but even in academic circles, it had not yet attained  the full degree of vitriol that it bears today. Cohen did not feel disdain  for the simple faith of the Ashkenazim that the Messiah would come  whenever God would determine, and certainly not for their avoidance  of active messianic movements. When all is said and done, does it really  make sense to say that messianic uprisings fit well with “the temper of  the historian”? I can testify that Cohen respected the Ashkenazim for  their self-sacrifice in times of crisis as a consequence of precisely the  constellation of beliefs that he presents in this study, even though he did  not identify with those beliefs himself.  Similarly, Carlebach’s assertion that Cohen’s typology has no room  for the conservative messianism of the Sephardic rabbinate from the  Geonim through Maimonides through R. Jacob Sasportas requires  qualification. Cohen does mention this conservatism several times  and even emphasizes it. As Carlebach understands very well, his basic  argument is that the rabbis related to messianism only on the level  of theory, but they did so in such impressive, constant fashion that  the masses were inspired to embrace messianic movements, despite  the reservations and opposition of the rabbis. As to Ashkenaz, even a  generous evaluation of the messianic movements there will reveal a very  modest number; it is difficult to agree with the claim that movements of  a messianic nature were “frequently” led there by the rabbinic elite. As I have mentioned, Carlebach points to the discovery of contacts  between the Jews of medieval Ashkenaz and Sepharad, and she sees  those contacts as a basis for denying the presence of sharp, clear lines  distinguishing the two cultures. This argument, for all its plausibility,  10 Cohen, p. 132 (ed. Kreuzberger). — 301 — </page> <page sequence="14"> Yearning for Redemption requires us to confront a broad, complex historical-methodological  question with many significant implications: When a civilization, or  segment of a civilization, is already beyond its formative stage, and  has an established cultural character, under what conditions might we  expect that its fundamental characteristics would change due to outside  influences? This is not the place to deal with the full dimensions of this  question, which have the broadest implications, but generally speaking,  it does not appear that cultures undergo deep changes simply on the  basis of books and reports brought by travelers or even on the basis of a  few personal contacts. In 1985, the historian Charles Radding published a book which  spawned a furious debate. In this book, he argued that the residents  of Europe in the first half of the Middle Ages evinced modes of ethical  thought that correspond not to those of adults in our society, but to  those of children whose age can be identified on the basis of Jean Piaget’s  system of classification.11 Among other things, Radding maintained that  Europeans in that period evaluated the severity of a crime based on its  consequences without reference to the perpetrator’s intent. One of the  criticisms leveled against Radding was that it is impossible to argue  that the authors of medieval laws could have ignored the importance  of intent since even in the early centuries of the Middle Ages Christian  intellectuals read the Bible with the belief that it represented divine  revelation, and biblical law views intent as a very important component  in ascertaining the severity of a sin and the degree of its punishment.  Moreover, as even Radding himself notes, Augustine and other church  fathers who were regarded as authorities by medieval lawmakers, also  ascribed considerable importance to intent. However, I think that this argument, which maintains that people  who believe in certain books will necessarily internalize their values, does  not accord with real psychological processes. Nations that developed  characteristic ways of thinking over long periods of time do not undergo  fundamental changes over a few generations just because they have  adopted a belief in a book that represents a different mentality. It is  much easier to adopt a new doctrine than a new way of conceiving  reality and the manner in which the universe operates. To the extent  11 Charles Radding, A World Made by Men: Cognition and Society, 400-1200 (Chapel Hill,  1985). — 302 — </page> <page sequence="15"> Sephardic and Ashkenazic Messianism in the Middle Ages:   that Radding has succeeded in pointing to evidence that the mentalité  of pre-twelfth-century Europeans in fact evinced the ethical conception  that he attributes to them (and this remains a debatable proposition),  the fact that this conception does not fit the Bible or Augustine does not  undermine his conclusion. With respect to the Jews of medieval Ashkenaz and Sepharad,  this point can be illustrated through an examination of an important  article on Jewish-Christian polemic.12 Daniel Lasker demonstrated  that philosophical arguments against Christianity originating among  Sephardic Jews appeared in books known to Ashkenazim. He pointed  to sporadic Ashkenazic use of these arguments beginning in the mid- fourteenth century and to a nugatory number of exceptional philosophical  passages before that point. The reader of Lasker’s comprehensive book  on medieval Jewish philosophical polemic against Christianity will  plainly see that Ashkenazic polemical literature plays so negligible a role  in it that deletion of the few references to this literature would effect  virtually no change at all in its contents.13 The article suggests a number  of explanations for the absence of philosophical argumentation, but the  one that I find most convincing is that the phenomenon is rooted in  a difference in worldviews. Lasker’s data effectively show us that the  estrangement of Ashkenazic Jews from a philosophical mode of thought  was so deeply ingrained that they could not digest philosophical concepts  even to the extent needed to direct them against Christian disputants –  despite the fact that arguments drawing upon them were more effective  than those formulated by the Ashkenazim on their own. I do not mean  to suggest that the Jews of Ashkenaz, among them sages whose “little  finger is thicker than my loins,” were not capable of understanding  philosophical discourse. However, even one who understands and even  values an argument that is embedded in a cognitive system foreign to  the way of thinking in which he has been raised from childhood will not  easily mobilize it and transfer it from his peripheral, passive awareness  to his central, active consciousness. In the final analysis, then, the contacts between Ashkenaz and  12 Daniel J.

But we should also not exaggerate their significance. Deep differences  separated the two cultural spheres, certainly to a sufficient degree to  sustain Cohen’s thesis from an abstract methodological perspective.14 We have arrived, then, at Carlebach’s analysis of the historiographical  material. We recall that the key point of her analysis is the affirmation  that the Christian environment is what caused Ashkenazic Jews to refrain  from recounting messianic episodes, and even when they mentioned them,  they downplayed or even ignored the messianic element. Consequently,  it is entirely possible that there were many more messianic movements  in Ashkenaz than the ones whose memory has been preserved. In other  words, the perception of a deep division between a Sepharad overflowing  with messianic movements and an Ashkenaz bereft of them rests on the  broken reed of flimsy historical documentation. When I noted earlier that our list of messianic movements is based in  part on Maimonides’ Epistle to Yemen, I meant to point out the possibility  that a different picture might have emerged had we possessed a fuller,  more balanced record. It is clear, then, that we cannot eliminate this  uncertainty entirely, and from an abstract, logical perspective, Carlebach’s  observation indeed sharpens it. Nonetheless, the historiographical data  cited in her article do not appear to prove the point. These data focus on only two movements, those of Laemmelein  and Molkho, both in the first half of the sixteenth century. In the  first instance, I see no support for the thesis that Ashkenazic writers  downplayed the messianic dimension of such movements whereas  Sephardic writers presented it fully. Carlebach emphasizes the fact that  the Ashkenazi David Ganz characterizes Laemmelein only as a harbinger  of the messiah. However, as she reports further, Ganz also informs us  of messianic expectations that were associated with Laemmelein’s  announcement of the redemption, and the Prague Chronicle also speaks  in this context of a rumor regarding the Messiah. Among the Sephardim,  Ibn Yahya’s formulation does not contain any clear messianic content  that goes beyond what we find in the Ashkenazic sources. As noted above,  14 I addressed this subject more fully in “Exegesis, Polemic, Philosophy, and Science:  Reflections on the Tenacity of Ashkenazic Modes of Thought,” scheduled to appear  in the proceedings of a conference on “The Attitude to Science and Philosophy in  Ashkenazic Culture through the Ages” to be edited by Gad Freudenthal [now reprinted  in this volume]. — 304 — </page> <page sequence="17"> Sephardic and Ashkenazic Messianism in the Middle Ages:   Yosef ha-Kohen and Sambari report that Laemmelein was considered a  prophet sent to be a ruler over the Jewish people, who would “gather  the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth,” but even  they have no explicit statement that Laemmelein declared that he was  the Messiah. Moreover, the motif of the ingathering of the exiles also  appears clearly in David Ganz’s chronicle. (“My grandfather, Seligman  Ganz of blessed memory, destroyed an oven dedicated to baking matzah  for Passover, for he was absolutely certain that in the following year,  he would be baking matzah in the Holy Land.”15) The general picture  here does not reflect a significant difference between Ashkenazic and  Sephardic historiography, and Carlebach herself words her conclusions  from the data on Laemmelein very cautiously.16 In the second instance, Carlebach’s analysis points to a somewhat  more evident difference, but even this is not convincing. A single  Sephardic source (Sambari) says explicitly that Molkho claimed to be the  Messiah. Ibn Yahya, who is mentioned in the article without quotation or  analysis, writes that Molkho declared that he was one of the emissaries of  the Messiah,17 a formulation that Carlebach characterized as avoidance  of an explicit messianic identification when she dealt with Ganz’s report  that Laemmelein saw himself as the herald of the messiah.  Yosef ha-Kohen’s use of the expression “a shoot came forth out of  Portugal” does appear to allude to messianism, but in a manner so brief  and indirect that one might plausibly speculate that if the author had  been Ashkenazic, Carlebach would have seen such a non-explicit allusion  as support for her thesis. Moreover, careful examination generates doubt  as to whether or not this formula alludes to messianism at all, for Molkho  wrote of himself, “Give your ears to hear the words of a worm, scarcely  a man, a shoot from the stem of the men of our exile, who has emerged  from our enemies”.18 Aescoly points out that the word “enemies” here  refers to Portugal, a country that persecuted its Jews. It is likely, then,  that this passage in the letter by Molkho is the source (whether directly  15 Zemah David, ed. by Mordechai Breuer (Jerusalm, 1983), p. 137, cited by Carlebach, p. 6. 16 I believe that she is right in her claim that Ashkenazic writers intentionally avoided  describing the instances of apostasy that occurred in the wake of the movement,  but this point does not necessarily mean that they avoided mentioning messianic  movements in and of themselves. 17 Aharon Ze’ev Aescoly, Ha-Tenu‘ot ha-Meshihiyyot be-Yisrael (Jerusalem, 1967), p. 408. 18 Aescoly, p. 386. — 305 — </page> <page sequence="18"> Yearning for Redemption or indirectly) of Yosef ha-Kohen’s expression “a shoot came forth  out of Portugal,” and the context in that letter refers according to its  straightforward meaning to humble ancestry, not to Davidic lineage. If David Ganz really refrained from mentioning the messianic ferment  associated with Molkho out of a calculated decision to ignore messianic  episodes, why does he mention the messianic stirrings inspired by the  accounts concerning Laemmelein? The Prague Chronicle reports messianic  expectations that spread as a consequence of Reuveni’s activities. Even if  Josel of Rosheim intentionally avoided any reference to the messianic  aspect of Molkho’s activity, we must remember that because he served  as a diplomat in royal and princely courts, he could have motivated by  special considerations, and it is doubtful that one may extrapolate from  his behavior to that of the general population. Yom Tov Lipman Heller’s  mention of Molkho is only a side-point in a halakhic discussion, so that  his failure to identify Molkho as a messianic figure bears no significance.  In general, the omission of the fact that Molkho identified himself as  the messiah is not meaningful, because it is very likely that this “fact”  is not correct. There is no reason to consider Sambari’s confused report  to be a historically authentic account, and in a matter of this sort we  cannot rely on Christian testimonies, whose self-interest with respect to  this assertion is blatant.19 The failure to mention an erroneous fact about  a messianic declaration can hardly prove an Ashkenazic tendency to avoid  reporting candid and complete information about messianic figures. Thus,  Carlebach’s only meaningful argument from the historiography about  Molkho is that Ashkenazic sources fail to mention messianic ferment, not  that they fail to mention Molkho’s supposed self-identification as messiah.  Yet even from this point of view, we are speaking about one source that  mentions messianic ferment in other contexts (Ganz), a second source  that mentions it here (the Prague Chronicle), a third source written by  an author with a delicate and atypical position (Josel of Rosheim), and a  fourth dealing primarily with an entirely different topic (Heller). To sum up, Carlebach’s methodological point about the  historiographical literature is of great interest as a hypothesis, but it  19 I am not saying that we should reject any Christian report out of hand on the assumption  that Christians invented fictional messianic movements out of whole cloth. However,  when a Christian provides an account of such a movement, we cannot expect him to  distinguish carefully and meticulously among a prophet, a harbinger of the Messiah,  an emissary of the Messiah, and the Messiah himself. — 306 — </page> <page sequence="19"> Sephardic and Ashkenazic Messianism in the Middle Ages:   has no convincing support from the documentation available to us. What  I have written above about the tendency of Jews in Christian lands to  recoil from messiahs referred, as I noted, to the embrace of messianic  figures, not to the avoidance of reference to messianic movements in  Hebrew books. There is a certain logic in the avoidance of such references,20  but we do not have sufficient evidence to conclude that an Ashkenazic  historiographic practice has deprived us of information about messianic  movements. Now let us attempt to sum up and propose some cautious  suggestions. It is difficult to accept Cohen’s argument that there was a connection  between the messianic tendencies of Babylonia and Palestine, on the one  hand, and the communities of Sepharad and Ashkenaz hundreds of years  later, let alone that this proposed link rested on a common rationalistic  component. Similarly, the suggested link between messianic calculations  and activism on the one hand and acts of apostasy on the other is baseless  and without any convincing logic. What remains is Cohen’s central thesis with its three components. 1. In Sepharad, we find lively messianic discussion of a rationalistic  nature, including great interest in calculating the End. In  Ashkenaz, on the other hand, the dimensions of messianic  discourse are much smaller, and to the degree that it existed, it  was entirely different in nature and focused on prophecies and  numerical equivalencies.  2. In the Sephardic sector, we find about a dozen messianic figures  between 1065 and 1492. In the Ashkenazic sector, we do not find  a single one. 3. These differences are rooted in the influence of Sephardic  rationalism, which inspired an entire messianic literature. Once  this topic was on the agenda, it led to movements despite the  opposition of the rabbinic/intellectual elite. It is clear that Cohen’s first assertion is correct to the degree that  20 We recall that Carlebach directs our attention to an interesting and relevant passage in  Sefer Hasidim, ed. by Wistinetzky (Frankfurt-am-Main, 1884), section 212, pp. 76–77,  in which the author warns the reader to be wary of individuals who prophesy about  the messiah, for the prediction “will ultimately be revealed to the whole world, and will  lead to shame and disgrace.” — 307 — </page> <page sequence="20"> Yearning for Redemption it addresses messianic thought, but this point in itself is neither  controversial nor innovative. Similarly, messianic calculations are indeed  found in the works of important thinkers in Sepharad, whereas the  calculations in Ashkenaz tend to occupy a much more peripheral place.  Nevertheless, we do find quite a few calculations in Ashkenaz: Ronnu  le-Ya‘akov simhah (the 256th cycle of the calendar), the end of the fifth  millennium, and more, though the calculations in Sepharad are more  variegated as a result of the broader intellectual vision that we might  label “rationalism.”  With respect to messianic movements or figures, Cohen’s factual  claim retains considerable persuasive power even after all the criticism  that has been leveled against it. Even if we use the general term  “ferment,” we do not find meaningful messianic activism in the heartland  of Ashkenaz except in the generation immediately before the end of  the fifth millennium. Yuval has recently argued on the basis of a very  interesting text that the migrations of rabbis to the Land of Israel in  that generation were inspired after all by messianic motives.21 Avraham  Grossman has endorsed a messianic explanation, but he emphasizes not  the significance of the year 5000 but the influence of the news that the  kingdom of the Crusaders had been defeated by Saladin, which, he says,  inspired messianic expectation in the communities of Ashkenaz.22 Even if  we adopt the messianic understanding of these migrations, the activism  in question is simply travel to the Holy Land to pray there. It is difficult  to take the Christian report about the year 1337 with all of its anti- 21 Shenei Goyim be-Bitnekh, pp. 276-283. The sixth chapter of the book is devoted to a  comprehensive and fascinating analysis of the influence of messianic expectation in  the years before 1240, even though there are grounds for reservations regarding some  of the arguments. 22 Grossman, “Nizhonot Salah a-Din ve-ha-Hit‘orerut be-Eropah la-‘Aliyyah le-Erez  Yisrael,” in Ve-Zot li-Yehudah: Mehqarim be-Toledot Erez Yisrael ve-Yishuvah: Muggashim  li-Yehoshua ben Porat, ed. by Yehoshua Ben-Aryeh and Elchanan Reiner (Jerusalem,  2003), pp. 362-382. Grossman adduces the following in support of his thesis: the  travails that Ashkenazic Jewry was suffering at the time; the argument proffered by  Christians that their victory in the Crusades was further evidence that the Jews had  been rejected in favor of the “True Israel”; liturgical poems describing the desecration  of Jerusalem by Christian pollution; a rabbinic statement that the redemption would  come at a time of war between the great world-empires; the joy of two Ashkenazic  authors (only one of whom refers to Saladin) upon hearing the news of the Muslim  victories; a near-messianic description of Saladin in a work by Al-Harizi; and the text  which Yuval cites. These arguments establish a reasonable possibility, but it is hard to  say that the evidence is genuinely convincing. — 308 — </page> <page sequence="21"> Sephardic and Ashkenazic Messianism in the Middle Ages:   Semitic legends too seriously, although there are no decisive grounds for  rejecting the possibility that it could be based in fact. Moreover, even one  who sees messianic ferment in 1096 in light of Ronnu le-Ya‘akov simhah,  and believes the Christian reports about 1337, and, in the wake of Yuval’s  study, lays great emphasis on the excitement leading up to 1240, would  nonetheless have to admit that before Asher Laemmelein—and even he  was not active in the Ashkenazic heartland—we do not have a report of a  single messianic figure in Ashkenaz.23 The burden of proof rests on one who wants to challenge this picture.  We may therefore move on to Cohen’s third point, where he attempts to  explain the phenomenon. Were popular messianic movements actually  born out of the influence of elite discussion of messianism, which trickled  down to the masses in distorted fashion? This is by no means impossible.  The educated elite certainly maintained connections with the masses,  and personalities such as Avraham Abulafia even straddled the boundary  between messianic thinker and semi-messianic figure. Nevertheless, it seems that this scenario is relevant only in Spain  itself. Figures such as David Al-Ro’i, and others like him, were active in  an environment that was not characterized by a rationalist component  strong enough to create movements among the masses. In general, it  is doubtful that we would be wondering at all about the appearance of  about a dozen messianic figures over a period of hundreds of years if  not for the contrast with Ashkenaz. We should consequently turn our  attention not to the presence of messiahs in the Sephardic communities,  but to their absence in Ashkenaz. In the wake of a reference in Carlebach’s article, I have already noted  a suggestion made by my student Avraham Pinsker that Ashkenazim  may have recoiled from messianic activism because they lived in a  Christian environment where they were forced to defend themselves  constantly against a religion that believed in a false messiah. This  suggestion, however, is subject to challenge. In Christian Spain, after  23 The messiah of Linon evinces clear “eastern” characteristic, and I believe that Cohen  is correct is seeing him as Sephardic rather than French. It should be noted that in a  later article, Cohen dismissed all medieval messianic movements as insignificant. While  there is much truth in this assertion, the contrast between Ashkenaz and Sepharad  in this sphere remains unaffected. See “Messianism in Jewish History: The Myth and  the Reality,” in Gerson D. Cohen, Jewish History and Jewish Destiny (New York and  Jerusalem, 1997), pp. 183-212. — 309 — </page> <page sequence="22"> Yearning for Redemption all, we continue to find messianic “ferment,” and sometimes even figures  of a messianic character. One might respond to this difficulty by arguing  that the messianic orientation of Sephardic Jewry was formed under the  rule of Islam, and it did not change in the face of the “logical” concerns  that might have been expected to uproot it in a Christian environment.  Nevertheless, the initial explanation is just a hypothesis, and the fact  that we need to defend it immediately against a reasonable challenge  shows that we should probably not embrace it with conviction. Let me move then to a different suggestion, which was also first  proposed in a discussion with students. Sheila Rabin, who studied with me  many years ago, suggested that the small populations of the Ashkenazic  communities served as an impediment to messianic movements. She  did not elaborate, but I believe that the suggestion deserves serious  consideration. The number of people who follow a messianic figure at the beginning  of his career – and in most cases, even at the height of his career – are  normally only a small percentage of the community’s population. If the  community is very small, one could hardly expect the number of believers  to reach the level necessary to transform the presumed messiah from a  mere curiosity to an influential personality. Furthermore, people who  have intimately known the messianic figure since his childhood are not  usually those who are mostly likely to be convinced by his messianic  claims. From this perspective, the communities in the Sephardic sector,  which were usually larger than those in Ashkenaz, were more likely to  generate messianic movements. Finally – another suggestion that is also related to the nature of small  communities, but focuses primarily on the relationship between the  rabbinic elite and the masses. Let us remember that Carlebach has noted  the sense of identification that the members of the small Ashkenazic  communities felt with the rabbinic scholars in their midst to support  her claim that messianic activity by rabbis influenced the community  as a whole. I have already expressed my view that messianic activity  among the rabbis of Ashkenaz was in reality extremely limited. For this  very reason, Carlebach’s observation about the relationship between  the Ashkenazic rabbis and the masses provides an opening for a new  understanding of the absence of messianic movements or figures in  Ashkenaz. In general, as Cohen has emphasized, rabbis did not follow  messiahs. The small messianic movements in the Middle Ages arose and  — 310 — </page> <page sequence="23"> Sephardic and Ashkenazic Messianism in the Middle Ages:   grew in the popular stratum of society, whereas the rabbinic elite reacted  to them with suspicion, even with hostility. Consequently, we should  not expect messianic movements to develop in small communities in  which the “masses” are very closely linked to the rabbis. Of course, this  picture of the authority held by the rabbis of Ashkenaz is exaggerated  and generalized, but I believe that there is enough truth in it to support  the basic argument. We have examined a truly gripping historical and historiographical  issue. After the criticisms presented both in this article and in Carlebach’s  lecture, Cohen’s famous thesis is reduced to the point where it stands  on two factual claims: (1) In medieval Spain and the Middle East, we  find messianic figures; but in Ashkenaz, we find none. (2) Speculative  messianic thought, including variegated calculations of the End, is  characteristic specifically of Sephardic communities. It is not impossible  that Cohen was correct in his attempt to associate the presence or absence  of messianic figures with varying approaches to faith and thought;  however, the suggested connection is not straightforward, since he must  assume that rationalism created movements only indirectly. Moreover,  not all the messianic claimants appeared in rationalistic environments. It  is consequently preferable to turn to other considerations. In Spain and  the Middle East, messianic figures occasionally appeared, sometimes as a  result of influences that we can identify, or at least surmise, such as the  Shiite environment or the turmoil in Yemen; but even when we do not  have a good explanation for a particular movement, there is no basis for  perplexity regarding the rise of a few small movements over the course  of many generations. The real question is why there were no messianic  figures in Ashkenaz, and here we may perhaps proffer the modest  suggestions that I have proposed. Even when small communities grow  to some extent over the course of time, patterns of messianic thought  and expectation formed over the course of generations do not change  easily, especially in light of the continuing authority and influence of the  rabbinic leadership, which was very wary of embracing messianic figures.  In sum, it may well be that the communal profile that characterized  Ashkenazic Jewry also determined its messianic profile. — 311 — </page> </plain_text>
