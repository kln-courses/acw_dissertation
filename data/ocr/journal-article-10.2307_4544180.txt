SEEING that philosophic discussion turns so largely on the meaning of words, I need not perhaps apologize for the almost entirely lexicographical character of this paper. Indeed, until philosophers show themselves sufficiently capable of co-operation to get together to appoint a Committee on Nomenclature, like the scientists, which may curb the licence of individuals in misusing old words and coining new ones of repulsive aspect and inferior value, it is something very like a duty to protest from time to time against the proceedings of those who try seriously to live up to the old jest that philosophy is nothing but the systematic misuse of a terminology devised expressly for this purpose. I. To begin with let us clear the way for our discussion by disposing of the word " evolution." It is, of course, one of the most popular of our catchwords, but I have ventured to exclude it from my title because of a vagueness, ambiguity and ineptitude which have become so notorious that no one will, I hope, have a good word to say for it. True, it has spread itself, like a weed, over the whole intellectual landscape, and is now liable to crop up nearly everywhere. But that is because it is attributed, very much at random, to pretty nearly everything, and is by no means a justification of current usage. " Evolution " is really an outstanding example of a cuckoo word with very disreputable habits. It began its career by usurping the meaning of its original competitor " epigenesis," without quite dropping its own, and in consequence is now C</page><page sequence="2">26 F. C. S. SCHILLER. commonly taken as affirming the implication of novelty, which it was constructed to deny. For " evolution " was originally a hypothesis about the development (a similarly question-begging word !) of organisms intended to slur over and conceal the occurrence of novelty. It insinuated that nothing could be " evolved" (" unfolded ") but what had been involved (" wrapped up ") from the beginning. But this hypothesis was used as a theory of descent. It was applied, with some success, to an actual process of nature, to the history of life on earth, because this had, or seemed to have to man's interested eyes, a definite trend. This trend our optimism, or conceit, interpreted as an upward one, as a progress entailing an increase in value, regardless of the vast masses of stagnation and the multitudinous cases of degeneration also exemplified in organic history, and unhindered by the reflection that the history of events on earth, or even in the whole solar system, afforded an absurdly narrow basis for inferences about cosmic evolution as a whole. Thus was the progressiveness latent in the notion of " epigenesis " craftily transferred to " evolution." When it was, tardily, observed that the actual course of biological history, when it was more closely scrutinized, by no means always supported the belief that the process was a progress, in whatever sense one might be pleased to take " progress," the big claims initially made on behalf of " evolution " had of course to be modified. But instead of restricting the term " evolution " to a fairly definite biological process scientists pursued the reprehensible and improper policy of further extending, and diluting, its meaning. So it was made to include such diverse processes as biological history, the development of a star or a galaxy, and even the "evolution " of matter itself. These extended uses have, however, reacted upon biological evolution; so it is now becoming clear that such progress as has occurred in the history of life must be conceived not as due to any " law"</page><page sequence="3">II. CREATION, EMERGENCE, NOVELTY. 27 or even " force " guaranteeing its continuance and significance, but at most as a complex resultant of many historical factors or conditions, which has in this one case of our earth ended in a show of progress. Thus we are not, strictly, entitled to regard biological " evolution " as more than a coincidence, which has quite the air of a lucky accident. The belief that " evolution " in the sense of progress would continue has thereby become an act offaith, which the past could engender, but could not prove. Logically it reduces to a probability, the strength of which it is hard to estimate, but which will loom large only in the eye of faith. It is plain also that we are not entitled to assert the reality of any universal evolution as a " law " of Nature. The most we can say is that if we are right in recognizing a certain trend in history as change for the better, despite the awkward fact that we must needs be strongly biased in favour of a history whicb has generated us, and if we are right in hoping that this trend will continue, on the whole, to prevail over opposinig tendencies leading in other directions, biological history can be viewed as, on the whole, progressive. Even then we shall have to be constantly on our guard against the insidious temptation of conceiving " progress circularly, as whatever " evolution " tends to. This seems an easy way of establishing the reality of " progress," but it is merely verbal and utterly fallacious. Furthermore, the implications of the fact that biological history is only an infinitesimal fragment of the total course of events must be fully recognized. A great act of faith was needed to construe biological history as, at heart, progressive; a second and more stuipendous act of faith is needed for the leap from our little earth to an " evolution " of solar systems and galaxies, nay of " matter " itself with all its " laws " of nature. A fortiori, therefore, biological history cannot prove that the notion of progressive process is transferable to the whole becoming of the</page><page sequence="4">28 F. C. S. SCHILLER. cosmos. It is a miracle of anthropomorphic audacity that it has so much as suggested it ! The moment, however, we try to effect this transfer we find, to our dismay, that while cosmic history does permit itself to be regarded as a process, it indicates a process of a totally different sort. We at once encounter the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which is much more fundamental and better established than any " law " of " evolution," and has much better claims to be regarded as a law. It implies, apparently, a very definite, and quite inexorable, trend in events, probably a beginning (if, that is, the urniverse is finite, and if it is not no one can say anything definite about it as a whole-simply because it isn't a whole !), and certainly an end, in a state of complete degradation or dissipation of energy which seems as unlike anything we can regard as perfection and life as could well be imagined.* If, therefore, the Second Law of Thermodynamics holds, all the changes in the universe tend towards a maximum of " entropy "; which, being interpreted, simply means that the universe is running down, and coming to a bad end. Naturally many of our physicists are human enough not to relish this prospect; they are at present searching (with little success) the most distant regions of stellar space for traces of a process that will mean a possibility of reversing the trend of change and of a regeneration of matter and energy, and so will restore stability (if not progressiveness) to the cosmos. Curiously enough, however, there is a certain doubt, based on facts much nearer home, whether this law does hold universally. For life (which we know to exist only on our little earth) appears to have a power (very limited at present) of reversing the cosmic trend. Living beings, no doubt, spend energy, like everything else; but they do not seem always * Qp. however Humani8n, ch. XII,</page><page sequence="5">II. CREATION, EMERGENCE, NOVELTY. 29 to waste it. This means that although the stream of energy flowing through the physical changes of life tends ever to a lower level, it can yet be used to build up the structures of a higher life. Moreover, in virtue of the process we call "learning," psychic life seems to be capable of storing up and accumulating the knowledge which is power, to a limited extent. This tendency of life is manifested from the beginning: for some living beings, to wit the plants possessing chlorophyll, are thereby enabled to synthesize organic compounds, instead of breaking them up into simpler forms of matter, while others, to wit " nitrifving bacilli," are able to draw nitrogen from the air and to render it available as a food. All these processes pre- suppose a supply of energy obtained from sunlight; but they constitute curious facts which may indicate that there are really two antithetical, or even antagonistic, processes going on together in the universe, and go to discredit the attempts to interpret it monistically. We should conclude therefore that it is a gross abuse of language and confusion of thought to applv the same word " evolution " indiscriminately to both processes, those of physical and those of biological history, and so long as this confusion is current it is better to avoid the word altogether. II. Let us therefore consider " creation " next. This is a word for a notion which the human mind has evidently had great difficulty in evolving. Etynmology shows that different languages have proceeded from different starting-points in arriving at it, and that many have never been able to arrive at it at all. Thus the English " creation " comes from a Latin root which meant to generate, a sense which " procreation " still retains. But in French creer has not been similarly specialized. It means to produce or make, and not specifically to " create," as is familiar</page><page sequence="6">30 F. C. S. SCHILLER. to the women who wear the " creations " of Parisian dressmakers. Consequently the French cannot distinguish between making out of already existing material and creating " out of nothing." German, on the other hand, has a distinct word for creating. It is schaffen. But schaffen is identical with our word " shape," and originally meant no more than " make." The Greek word for "creator," KTWMTf, means properly " founder." I suspect that a critical survey of the words used for creation in other languages would reveal other similar differences and variations. The history of the theological doctrine of creation points in the same direction. It is quite a late discovery or invention. Primitive thought is not familiar with it; it nowhere seems to trouble itself about the origin of all things. Even when cosmo- gonies begin they always start with some pre-existent material, which is still a postulate of orthodox science. Hence the " creator " is only the maker of a cosmic order out of an anterior chaos, which now strikes one as very like the state of maximum " entropy " predicted by the Second Law of Thermodynamics. In the book of Genesis, which appears to be a monotheistic recension of earlier Babylonian accounts of the struggles of Bel-Marduk with Tiamat the Dragon of the Deep, alias the "g waters " of the Abyss, the pre-existence of these chaotic waters is implied: it is concealed only by the mistranslation of a Hebrew tense.* In view of its religious and philosophic importance it is astonishing how very obscure is the origin of the theological doctrine of " creation out of nothing." According to my friend, the late F. C. Conybeara, it owed its birth to the exigencies of controversy. Philo the Jew, of Alexandria, found himself committed to proving the superiority of the God of Moses to the Demiurge of Plato's Timaeus. So he makes much of the fact that the latter made matter out of empty space (gqi o`v) by * Op. C. M. Walsh. The Doctrine of Creation. (Fisher Unwin.) 1910,</page><page sequence="7">II. CREATION, EMERGENCE, NOVELTY. 31 imposing on it geometrical forms, whereas the former was potent enough to make the world out of nothing. I have not succeeded in extracting this theory from the text of Philo, and another friend, Canon R. H. Charles, has directed my attention to a (probably) earlier allusion to creation out of nothing in the book of the Maccabees (II. 7, 28), which declares that God made all things out of " things that were not " (et oZc O'VTW l E7T0117EV avTa). But, as in later Greek the two negatives are frequently confused, it is hardly safe to assume that when a Hellenistic writer uses o'lc he does not mean Fti, and so is not merely alluding to the Platonic carving out of ,w' o'vra. However this may be, it seems pretty clear that the decisive step (attested by my friend, Prof. J. E. Boodin, and Mr. Walsh, loc. cit. p. 27) was taken by St. Jerome when he translated the passage from Maccabees in the Vulgate by " ex nihilo fecit illa Deus " and adopted the term " Creator " in place of the earlier " Conditor " to translate KT'7*TlST. For his Vulgate became the authoritative version of the Roman Church, and generated the dogma of creation out of nothing. It was vain for philosophers to quote Lucretius's ex nihilo nihil and to decry the doctrine as mere foolishness, incompatible with the "law" of causation, and they long did so at their peril. Evidently then, as so often in the case of great ideas as well of great men, the origin of the doctrine of creation was obscure. Philosophically it was a paradox, and historically it was a mistake, resting on a misapprehension of Plato and a mis- translation of Genesis. Nevertheless, when the Christian Church adopted it a real and genuine novelty entered the world of thought. III Now real novelties always have a hard time at first. Among their just grievances, the fact that officially they are always denied existence ranks high. But they might complain nearly</page><page sequence="8">32 F. C. S. SCHILLER. as bitterly of the attempt to dismiss their claims by applying to them the word " emergence." For " emergence " is in no wise an explanation of the occurrence of novelties: it only records their occurrence, and is hardly even a candid recognition thereof. For it is apt to be rather the vehicle for an ambiguous insinuation that the alleged novelties are not truly new but have long been lurking obscurely in the dark and waiting for an opportunity to break forth into the light of day. Thus, etymologically, " emergence " has the same sort of dishonesty as " evolution," and it is amazing that it should have found such favour even among philosophers. Logically, it is open to a still more serious objection. As used, it suggests that the emergence of novelties is a rare and abnormal occurrence which deserves to be dignified with a technical term. This is calculated to conceal from us the fact that it is only a grandiloqueut description of a very familiar experience, 4iz., the occurrence of novelties, and so to prevent us from facing this fact, as we ought, in its full generality. IV. The real question which as philosophers we ought to discuss, and if possible to settle, before we allow ourselves (or others) to talk about evolution and emergence, and before we declare true creation inconceivable nonsense, is-What is the place and significance of novelty in the world, and what ought to be our logical attitude towards it ? I will conclude therefore by offering some considerations bearing on this question. (1) We should agree, I think, that Novelty is the right word for what has been variously called " evolution," " emergence " and " creation." It is the right word because it is the simplest and the free-est from pomiposity and contamination by irrelevant issues. (2) It is indubitably afact. For it is being generated to some extent by the course of events at every moment. Every moment</page><page sequence="9">II. CREATION, EMERGENCE, NOVELTY. 33 arrives with some of the freshness of the unforeseeni and un- exampled, and passes away into the irrevocable. It is because of the novelty it conveys that the course of events is irreversible. (3) Novelty is neither unintelligible nor subversive of the cosmic order. For though the new as new is never predictable nor reducible to the old, yet it is, only too easily, absorbed into the old order. For its novelty admits of more and less, and it is never wholly new. It always shows itself more or less easily assimilable. Hence (4) it is always apprehensible as a variation or innova- tion upon some ancient theme, and capable of explanation by reference to that. But such explanation is never complete. From the nature of the case it is only partial. It reduces the new to the old, treats it as if it were old, and by this soothing fiction beguiles us into accepting it. We have never, therefore, to face the brutal anid disturbing fact that Novelty is a universal, characteristic, and ineradicable feature of the Real; nor do we ever realize that it casts a doubt, or rather a limitation, upon our vaunted " law " of causal explanation. For if our world is really such that nothing in its history ever quite repeats itself, it is clearly a fiction to treat it as if it did. Now this postulate of repetition is one of the major assumptions lurking in causal explanation, towards which neither Hume nor the interminable literature of the subject has ever induced philosophers to show themselves. sufficiently critical. The " cause " of any phenomenon is supposed to be fixed and stable, and in honour bound to reproduce the sarme effect whenever called upon. A " cause " that was capable of learning from experience, and of modifying its operations accordingly, would be more human but nothing like so convenient methodologically. But there is nothing in this human convenience to prevent an unvarying " cause " from being only a methodological fiction, and even the stupidest of physical D</page><page sequence="10">34 F. C. S. SCHILLER. entities may be able to learn a little from experience in the course of esons. The result would of course be that a prediction based on the uniformity of nature might be trusted to come true five years hence, but not 500,000,000 years hereafter. I concede, however, that, as a matter of course, we shall continue to go upon the assumption that "causes " do not change, simply because there is nothing else to go upon if we desire to foresee the future, just as we assume that causes are determined and will not upset our calculations by freaks of free will: but this concession does not oblige us to ignore the reality of novelty. We ought to remain fully aware that we are using a fiction and running a risk, and we ought to be for ever ready to modify and correct the assumptions on which we base our calculations. We should eschew therefore the illusory pursuit of safety and realize that life will always contain an element of adventure that will warrant hopes as well as fears. V. Before, however, our recognition of Novelty can be complete we must settle accounts with Logic. For Logic hitherto has been the greatest obstacle to the perception and discovery of novelty, and the greatest stronghold for the belief that nothing new could be true, and that nothing true could be new. The old Formal Logic (and until quite recently no logical reformer has ever dared to question its fundamental assumptions) was carefully, though covertly, constructed to do two things. It tried, first, to predict the future entirely a priori, by mere reasoning without recourse to experience; second, to yield complete certainty that could not in any way be shaken or upset by any course of events. The instrument it relied on to accom- plish both these ends was the same, namely, the syllogism. Now the syllogistic form lent itself to the purposes of Formal Logic by claiming to be incapable of losing any truth with which</page><page sequence="11">II. CREATION, EMERGENCE, NOVELTY. 35 it was entrusted on the way from its premisses to its conclusion. Consequently, if only you supplied it with premisses which were absolute, you could rely on it that the conclusion it deduced would be so likewise. The fact, therefore, that the conclusion referred to the future made no difference; it had become irrelevant, and did not detract from the certainty of a syllogistic prediction. It was in this highly technical way that Logic upheld the existence of " eternal " truth. Unfortunately for Formal Logic the premisses of this reasoning were not themselves true. It had misconstrued the syllogism, and overrated its powers. It turned out that there were in- superable difficulties in starting from true premisses, or, rather, of guaranteeing the absolute truth of any premisses. No premisses could be found that were more than probable truths, and no conclusion that was more than the verification of a hypothesis, and therefore afflicted with the formal defects of all verification. What was even worse was that it was not true that the syllogism was incapable of losing truth. It was found to be afflicted with a weakness, inherent in its constitution, which revealed itself so soon as you tried to use it and undermined the whole notion of formal validity. This weakness had escaped notice so long only because formal logicians are not in the habit of using themselves the forms of reasoning they prescribe to others, and the defect in question is not visible so long as you are content to contemplate only the abstract form of reasoning. But when you actually use it you put together two premisses you have taken as true, and may triumphantly " demonstrate "' an absurdity. You may then " reflect " upon your debacle and discover that your middle term has grown ambiguous, and so your reasoning fallacious. Further reflection shows that this may always happen. For what may validly enough be taken as M in relation to P does not necessarily stay M when brought</page><page sequence="12">36 F. C. S. SCHILLER. into relation to S. You moreover were no prophet: in assenting to the premisses separately and in the abstract you did not foresee how they would be used. So you may placidly agree that all men are rational and that Smith is a man and then be surprised to find that he is a raving lunatic; or again, that all men are mortal and that Socrates is a man, and then be puzzled to say when he may be expected to die again, or whether you think that " mortal " means " dead."* In short, modern criticism has shattered the syllogism as an instrument of ineluctable coercion and absolute prediction, and with it our trust in delusive proofs that rest only on the implica- tions of purely verbal meanings. The true moral is that we must steel ourselves to face a future that is really " conitingent," and really capable of generating novelties. We are armed onlv with probable anticipations; but it rests with us to cultivate a plasticity of mind that will keep pace with the changes of the real and readily adjust itself to new conditions. And that what is required of us is nothing excessive and impossible we mav learn from the reflection that philosophic theory is only now commending an attitude which we all have practised all ouir lives ! cp.
