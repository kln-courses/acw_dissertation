<plain_text><page sequence="1">Thc Attributes of God. By Lewis Richard Farnell. Oxford: at the Clarendon Press (I925). Pp. x + 283. Although Professor Famell is one of the best known students of ancient religion, the contents of his book, The Attributes of God, comprising the Gifford Lectures, delivered at St. Andrews, in 1924-1925, really lie largely outside the sphere of classical studies. In an introductory chapter, Dr. Farnell discusses the subject of his lectures and the method of treatment. The re- maining nine chapters deal with II. Personality and Anthropomorphism(i 8-63); III. Polytheism and Mono- theism (64-I01); IV. Elemental and Natural Func- tions and Attributes of Divinity (I02-1 i8); V. Tribal and National Attributes and Functions of the Deity (119-136); VI. The Political Attributes of God (I37- I62); VII. The Moral Attributes of God (I63-209); VIII. The Attributes of Beauty, Wisdom, and Truth (210-223); IX. The Attribute of Power (224-246); X. Metaphysical Attributes: Problems of the Philosophy of Religion (247-280). It will be seen that the order of treatment involves an ascent from the lowest to the highest manifestations of the deity. To a large extent the author has to deal with the relation of religion to intellect. Here he takes a firm stand on the side of those who defend the claims of thought against the demands of belief. But he makes it also perfectly clear (5) that he considers the proper sphere of religion to be "to function, in order to give us a scale of values, which the discursive intellect is wholly powerless to give". In this respect, he agrees fully with such an authority as Karl Beth, in his Einfuihrung in die Vergleichende Religionsgeschichte (Leipzig, Teubner, I920) and his Religion und Mlagie (Leipzig, Teubner, I927). On the other hand, Pro- fessor Farnell appears to be still largely influenced by the views of Sir James G. Frazer as to the priority of magic over religion, and he still clings to the theory of animism, in its narrower meaning. This part of his discussion (Chapters II, III, IX) should be corrected to-day by a reading of the works of Beth quoted above, and of the interesting monographs of the philosopher Ernst Cassierer, entitled Die Begriffsform im Myth- ischen Denken, Studien der Bibliothek Warburg I (Leipzig, Teubner, 1922), and Sprache und Mythos, Studien der Bibliothek Warburg VI (Leipzig, Teubner, 1925). Naturally, Greek religion is repeatedly discussed during the course of these lectures. In general, one can find little fault with the author's remarks, which may be summed up somewhat as follows. Hellenic religion is, of all religions, most powerfully dominated by an- thropomorphism: its idolatry has contributed very largely to the development of the highest art; Greece is the country in which religion and political organi- zation have entered into the most complete union, but without developing into the idea of a theocracy, such as we find in Judaism. On the contrary, the Greek spirit has contributed the idea of universalism to the re- ligious thought of the world. The attribute of justice is tempered in the Hellenic mind by that of mercy. But the chief contribution of the Hellenes to the con- ception of the deity is that of beauty. In this, Pro- fessor Farnell agrees with Thaddeus Zielinski, The Religion of Ancient Greece, 62-89 (Oxford, at the Clarendon Press, I926). Of course, numerous details are discussed during the development of the author's theme. Not in every one of these can full agreement be expected. Thus, the</page><page sequence="2">104 THE CLASSICAL WEEKLY [VOL. XXII, No. 13, WHOLE No. 597 statement (I4) that "a small class of divine appel- latives which are directly transferred from the wor- shipper, to whom they properly belong, to the deity by a curious motive of religious myth" must be cor- rected by the statements of Beth, Religion und Magie, 242-251, and also by those of Cassierer, Begriffsform, I6-22, and Sprache und Mythos, 54, 55. There are many more places in which the author challenges contradiction, or, at least, causes the reader to question his statements. But for stuch a discussion a review does not seem the fitting place. It might also be very fruitful to compare Professor Farnell's ideas of the development of religious feeling among the Greeks with those recently set forth by Martin P. Nilsson in Chan- tepie de la Saussaye's Lehrbuch der Religionsge- schichte4, 2.280-4I7 (Tubingen, Mohr, I925). The two scholars agree in ascribing to the Hellenes the greatest development of a clear-cut anthropomorphism and the most complete union of religion and political organi- zation. But, while Farnell professes to see in this phenomenon a lasting contribution to the higher development of religiorn, Nilsson sees here rather the sources of the weakness of Hellenic religion and the reason for its final dissolution. The idea of beauty, which Farnell judges lto be the greatest and most characteristic element that Greece has contributed to the content of the idea of God, Nilsson does not touch upon at all. Every classical scholar, finally, ought to read the book for himself. How much he will accept or reject of its statements depends, in the last analysis, upon his own individual conception of the deity. But nobody can fail to be stimulated by the book, which is certainly one of the best that has come from the pen of the author of The Cults of the Greek States.
