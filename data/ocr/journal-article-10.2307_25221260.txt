By Candramani Vidyalankara PalIratna. 8Jx5i, iv+xii-f-874 pp. Kangri: Gurukula Press, 1925-G. Professor Candramani Vidyalankara gives us here, after the text of the Nighantu, Yaska's Nirukta together with an original Hindi blidsya or explanatory commentary upon it. He has made good use of the ancient interpreters, whose writings he has supplemented by devout study of the teachings of Svaml Dayananda Sarasvati. The result of these labours is a work which merits praise as an erudite and conscientious exposition, and which will be distinctly useful to native students who are willing to accept the doctrines of the Arya Samaj, but will be of small value to most western readers, who will probably take the liberty to disagree with many of the philosophical and theological opinions set forth in his pages, and possibly also to question some of his conclusions as to the life of Yaska. Whilst admitting the merits of Yaska as a transmitter of Vedic tradition and as an intelligent thinker in his generation, we are not disposed to accept the Professor's claim that the Nirukta is " the key to the treasure of Vedic knowledge ". 2.

Samaranganasutradhara by King Bhojadeva. Edited by Mahamahopadhyaya T. Ganapati Sastri. Vol. ii. (Gaekwad's Oriental Series, No. XXXII.) 9f x 6?, ii + 15 + 324 pp. Baroda : Central Library, 1925. The Nala-vildsa is a Sanskrit drama in seven acts on the familiar epic theme of the adventures of King Nala ; but the author, true to his principle of independence (he uses as the ahka of his works the adjective svatantra) has treated the subject in a somewhat original manner, one of the features of which is the use of the artifice of a play within the play.1 Ramacandra was one of the most distinguished disciples of the great Hemacandra; but of his numerous works, which are said to amount to a hundred, only few have been published. To speak candidly, his muse seems to us somewhat mediocre and frigid, and we are unable to share the learned editor's enthusiasm for it. Nevertheless his work is scholarly and meritorious : his praiseworthy efforts to attain originality have at any rate elevated him above the common herd, if they have failed to lift him to the higher peaks of Parnassus. In the Tattva-sahgraha of Santiraksita (this form of his name seems to us to be better than that adopted by the editor) with his disciple's commentary or panjikd we have a publication of an importance commensurate with its bulk. The former consists of 3,646 polemic verses in which Santira ksita wages lively warfare from the Buddhist standpoint against other schools. He begins by assailing the Sankhya theory of nature as the cause of the world, the Naiyayika doctrine of God as creator, the theistic Sankhya, and the theories of independent existence of effects, of iSabda-Brahma or Divine Logos, of Purusa or anthropomorphic creator, and 1 The employment of this device in the Ratndvali, wo may remind our readers, has been made the subject of an excellent little study in the edition of that drama by Professor A. V. W. Jackson and his collaborators.</page><page sequence="3">indica 863 of soul as an independent and eternal entity according to the Naiyayikas, Purva-mlmamsakas, Sahkhyas, Digambaras, Upanisadic mdyd-vadins, and Vatslputriyas. Then he demolishes the doctrines that ascribe permanence to the forms of existence ; the arguments against Buddhism drawn from the relation of actions and their effects, from the logicians' theories of substance, quality, action, generality, particularity, and invariable concomitance, the relation between words and their objects, perception, inference, and other means to valid knowledge, as well as the sydd-vdda or doctrine of the coexistence of different qualities in the same subject; the doctrine of certain Buddhists that ascribes to phenomena permanence in change ; the Lokayata or ultra-materialist heresy; the theory of the reality of external phenomena ; the claim of supreme authority for the Vedas ; the Purva mlmamsakas' theory of the self-demonstrated validity of knowledge ; and lastly tho objections raised against the omniscience of the Buddha. In the course of these discussions the authors refer to many writers who are otherwise unknown or only imperfectly known,1 which greatly increases the value of these pages. In his English introduction the general editor of the series, Mr. Benoytosh Bhattacharyya, ably discusses all these and other data of literary history arising out of the text and its commentary, at the same time giving a valuable review of the known facts concerning Santiraksita and Kamala&amp;la, whose dates he fixes with reasonable proba bility as respectively 705-762 and 713-763. In this connexion he announces the discovery of another work of Santiraksita, the Tattva-siddhi, which expounds the Mahasukha-vada, 1 Tho chief of thoso, in chronological order, aro : Kamalasvatara (possibly tho same- as Ajita Kesakambali, Vasuraitra, Dharmatrata, Ghosa or Ghosaka, Buddhadeva, Vindhyavasin, Sahghabhadra, Vasubandhu, Dinnaga, Acarya Suri (possibly Haribhadra), Mathara (quoted without name), Dharmakirti, Bhartrhari, 6ubhagupta, Purandara, Yogasena, Samara and Yajnata, Aviddhakarna, Sankara Svamin, PraSastamati, Bhdvivikta, Patrasvamin, Ahrika, Sumati, and Ubeyaka (who, it is suggested with some probability, may bo identical with the poet Bhavabhuti).</page><page sequence="4">864 notices of books a form of Vijnana-vadin Buddhism; and as it quotes $antideva's Bodhicaryavatara and Tattva-sangraha, it fixes a limit for the date of Santideva, who must therefore have lived between 695, when I-tsing left India, and 743, when $antiraksita first visited Tibet. The elaborate Sanskrit preface of Pandit Krishnamacarya also calls for honourable mention. Thus these two volumes are in all respects a really valuable contribution to Sanskrit literature. The second and concluding volume of the Samardhgaria sutradhdra contains chapters 55-83 of the work, describing the construction of various types of temples and their chief members, rules for painting and plastering, the proportions, forms, poses, and attributes of the figures of deities, the five classes of men and women according to the Kdma-sdstra, the eleven rasas or sentiments known to writers on the art of poetry and their representation in painting and sculpture, and the 64 attitudes of the hands used symbolically in dance gesticulation. This should be valuable to the student of the fine arts. Unfortunately, however, the editor has been compelled to lean upon the broken reed of a single manuscript which is very defective and corrupt, and hence the text in many places is beyond his power of emendation, so that the value of the book is seriously restricted.</page></plain_text>
