Stallknecht Department of Comparative Literature, Indiana University In his famous account of poetry as emotion recollected in tranquillity, Words worth has told us something about poetry in general but more especially about his own life as a poet. Here recollection often played an indispensable and a para mount role; but, it is obvious enough, such recall had to contain rather more than sheer emotion. Emotion is a dimension of consciousness, and consciousness usually includes some recognition of persons, things, or events that constitute the situa tion in response to which emotions have taken shape. Indeed emotions, even the ecstatic self-surrender of the mystic, can hardly be expressed, certainly not ef fectively embodied in poetic imagery, without some reference, however indirect, to what T. S. Eliot chose to call an "objective correlative." This comment holds true in some degree of all poetry, but it applies most readily to a poet like Words worth, for whom introspection and observation are of equal importance. Such a poet will hesitate to abstract emotion from moments of awareness, or awareness from some concrete feature of the object that it encounters. In fact, it is the encounter itself that he will tend to preserve and to celebrate. The poem will stand as a witness of the encounter which it clarifies and even completes. Mr. Garber has derived from this notion of the encounter an interpretation that applies happily to a considerable number of poems and passages belonging to Wordsworth's greatest period. Among these "The Solitary Reaper" stands as a mem orable paradigm, although here, to be sure, the encounter in the strictest sense is a vicarious one, occasioned by a brief passage in a traveller's diary that is expanded and enriched by the poet who, so to speak, lays claim to the traveller's experience at once recognizing and seeking to overcome the haunting strangeness of the Reaper's song. The poet whose attention is possessed by an object, whether a person, a scene, or an event, is no longer playing with words or with ideas, whose combinations offer "The self-created sustenance of a mind / Debarred from Nature's living im ages" (Prelude, VI, 301-302). On the contrary, he enjoys things that speak to him through his,own voice, and he comes to see them as centers of far-reaching signif icance. The poem that takes shape may thus comprehend far more than appeared in the first glimpse of the object, yet in doing so it may be faithful to the object and it may express the attitude and clarity the intention of the poet. As Mr. Garber puts it: "the qualities of the object as they appear in the poem are the result (not the sum) of an encounter of seer and seen, and therefore of the ac tivity disclosed in the meeting manifested in the poem. The qualities exist as part of the activity and take their substance and meaning from it. A description of the object, then, has to be approached through a devotion to the reality of the encounter and that high point at which something comes to be known to the obser ver" (pp. 31-32). Here Mr. Garber follows both Wordsworthian theory and practice. For Words worth much successful poetry, the work of a healthy imagination, springs from an ennobling interchange Of action from without and from within; The excellence, pure function, and best power Both of the object seen, and eye that sees. (Prelude, XIII, 375-37Ö) 211</page><page sequence="2">Mr. Garber has found many ways of illustrating Wordsworth's reference to the power of objects. His study also makes clear that Wordsworth's imagination is often distinguished by its gift of selectivity as well as by its energy of expres sion. The two virtues may be seen as mutually dependent. They are co-present throughout the structure of The Prelude that Wordsworth builds upon sequences of personal experience. The many encounters with people, places, and events that the poet speaks of do more than illustrate the development of his thought and of his art. They have often been directly influential in enlarging his consciousness and awakening his creative powers. Mr. Garber finds especially important certain moments of experience and in sight in which the poet is surprised, even shocked, rebuked, or rebuffed, as he recognizes their full significance. Thus the Leech-gatherer thrusts upon him, or suddenly awakens within him, a new self-knowledge that amounts to a moral reorien tation. Here, as elsewhere, Wordsworth stands humbly, almost in awe, as he recog nizes the dignity of human endurance and of an almost inarticulate fortitude. In many encounters we find Wordsworth looking upward beyond his own achievement. Then there are moments that seem almost to carry a challenge. We may find this element of opposition present as an undertone even in a lyric whose theme is that of happy participation in the spirit of a mild spring day. Even here Nature warns or re bukes as well as soothes, and the poet is reminded of "what man has made of man." Mr. Garber's keen appreciation of Wordsworth's poetry of encounter, "concrete and self-concerned," leads him to consider such poems as "The Solitary Reaper" and "Resolution and Independence" more effective and more characteristic of their au thor's highest ability than "Tintern Abbey" or the eloquent passages in The Prelude that express the poet's sense of communion with Nature. Mr. Garber finds that many of these utterances "turn out to be about the poet himself rather than about what he sees." Their "focus is necessarily on process not on whatever it is he came to know." In other words, the encounter is less complete and the vision less concentrated than in the poems first mentioned. To be sure, we do sometimes find Wordsworth talking about the experience of ecstatic communion, and these may be important statements. But, there are other passages where he tries to recall the experience itself and to give some expression to the sense of revelation. In such descriptions the power of revelation seems to characterize the objects that compel his attention. After all, Wordsworth attempted comparatively rarely to explore the depths of human consciousness through any deliberate exercise of introspection, although, as he tells us, he was well aware of this possibility and pursued such meditation while at Cambridge during his first prolonged absence from the "shapes sublime" of his native mountains. More usually his ecstasy came upon him as the uninvited accompaniment or aftermath of a concentration of attention that released him from the distractions of a commonplace awareness of the things about him. Such concentration was frequently centered upon the "forms" of nature and was aesthetic in character, although he once found something similar in the detachment offered by the study of mathematics. It is not surprising then that Wordsworth's account of transcendental enlightenment often dwells at length upon the conditions that have supported his vision. Thus the features of a mountain scene may be prominent in his recollection, and from these his imagination may derive a symbolic sugges tion of the total significance of the experience. The feeling of mystical sig nificance may be expressed and communicated in many ways including the symbolic connotations of the imagery and the tempo of the verse. Consider as an example in Book VI of The Prelude where the poet recalls passing wearily through a narrow Alpine chasm and looking up at the distant sky (ll. 6l6-kO). In the total scene he recognizes the "types and symbols" of Eternity, but the choice of the simile is 212</page><page sequence="3">not a random occurrence. A few lines above he has spoken of imagination as a Power that "came athwart" him and halted his consciousness. We are reminded of Milton's "joy shall overtake us like a flood." Confrontation and participation or communion seem at times to merge or to intersect. It may well be that in the description of the Alpine pass, as also in the Mt. Snowdon passage in the conclusion of The Prelude, the "marriage of mind and universe" seems to "stand on the sidelines of the passage," as Mr. Garber suggests (p. 172), since no explicit mention is made of such communion. Nonetheless I would prefer to say that it often stands between the lines and constitutes the intention of the passage. But arbitration of such differences, slight as they may seem, lies beyond the scope of a review. Mr. Garber compares Wordsworth's attitude as a poet with that of certain other writers including, especially, Hölderlin and Wallace Stevens. These supple mentary comments constitute thoughtful additions to the central argument of the essay. Mr. Garber sees Hölderlin as less personal in his utterance than Words worth, assuming a prietsly role rather than that of more intimate confession. This is certainly true and the comment is helpful; but we must remember that Wordsworth did at times think of himself, especially in The Recluse fragment, as offering a prophetic inspiration to his fellow men, although his message sprang from intimate personal experience that he often recorded in his verse. Again, one may perhaps feel that Wallace Stevens stands somewhat closer to Wordsworth than Mr. Garber admits (p. 133)- Certainly Stevens does not always consider poetic imagery as an end in itself. For him "gaiety of language" carries with it an enjoyment of a reality that the philosopher may fail to offer us. Po etry senses the concrete in a way that discursive thought cannot: "The poem is the cry of its occasion, / Part of the res itself and not about it." To lose this sense of the concrete is the greatest poverty the spirit can suffer; and we are enriched when we encounter something individual and unique that we may enjoy but cannot define. After all, Stevens' "weddings of the soul" are not so different from those moments in which Wordsworth found the human spirit "wedded to this goodly universe / In love and holy passion" (Preface to The Excursion, 11. 53 5^). Wordsworth felt no need to apologize for the exalted tone of such an ut terance which he included in a prophetic anticipation of the future enlightenment of mankind. On the other hand, Stevens, even though he believed that poetry "must take the place / Of empty heaven and its hymns," tried persistently to avoid any suggestion that he spoke with inspired authority. Yet for all his modesty, his softened statement, and his ironical -uncertainty, he cherished the belief that the poet may uncover a reality that reason and daily experience overlook. His "my green, my fluent mundo," his "fat girl, terrestrial" are not to be enjoyed merely as lively and facile images. They respond to what Stevens called the "lure of the real," and this he shared with Wordsworth. On rereading the above, I find that I have rather tended to emphasize points on which I have been tempted to take exception. Let me make amends by pointing out that Mr. Garber's patient study of Wordsworth contains many careful and sym pathetic analyses of individual poems, analyses that the student, whatever his presuppositions, will find rewarding. ************************ 213</page><page sequence="4">Parther Comments by Max F. Schulz Department of English, University of Southern California It is characteristic of some recent criticism on the English Romantics to emphasize their difficulties in finding a mode of organizing experience so as to body forth a world in which the separateness of self is transmuted into related ness. This concern with the patterns of existential existence (for want of a bet ter phrase) seems to be particularly applicable to considerations of Wordsworth, as Frederick Garber's Wordsworth and the Poetry of Encounter (as well as Richard J. Onorato's biographical-psychoanalytical study The Character of the Poet: Words worth in "The Prelude" [1971] among others) attest. Many of us have been accus tomed to describing Wordsworth's teachings about the One Life epistemologically in Romantic and Kantian terms of subject and object and to analyzing his poems structurally for the ways they blur categories of time and space to accommodate the Wordsworthian experience of oneness, where, as Wordsworth said in an 1824 let ter to Walter Savage Landor, "things are lost in each other, and limits vanish, and aspirations are raised" (p. 103). It comes then as a satisfactory revelation to learn that the contemporary language of encounter, stranger, identity, plurality, and isolation makes Words worth readily accessible to us from the viewpoint of our own century's experience of man. Thus Wordsworth, out of a sense of his radical human loneliness and his fear of isolation, strove to elicit from his "encounters" with persons and things an expansion of consciousness that was simultaneously a witness of himself and a confirmation both naturally and spiritually of his communion with a world of other ness. For this reason the singularity of forms—that is, their "privateness and separateness, uniqueness and unusualness" (p. ko)—became for Wordsworth an affir mation of his own individuality. At the same time Wordsworth was bent on extend ing his awareness of being to the farthest reach of sense, not as with Keats and Shelley to catch glimpses of another world, but as a way of affirming and extend ing the integrity of self. This exercise in self-definition is fraught with risks—as existentialist man in this century has discovered. In the zeal to pro tect and extend his individuality, Wordsworth risked "overwhelming everything with his swelling self (and thus compromising his separateness by putting himself in everything" and in doing so curving back "toward the solipsism of early child hood" (p. 29), which is the Wordsworth of The Excursion and of the Keatsian ego tistical sublime. The Wordsworth of the Great Decade, though, was Intent on de scribing a world of plurality, "of discrete and not completely knowable objects" (p. 28), whose coherence he could talk about while avoiding the sentimental trap of identification and unification (p. 74). Neither Blake's cosmic anthropomorphism nor Keats's negative capability was acceptable under the circumstances. Wordsworth preferred to live with the tension of a world whose multiple dimensions he could never know in their entirety than to assert a cozy world of identities unsupported by his experience. Hence, travel, speech, dance, and marriage metaphors—the bird's voice, for example, in "To a Cuckoo," the voices of the girls in "The Soli tary Reaper" and "Stepping Westward" as they are heard by the traveler Wordsworth, or the rhythmic energies of earth and sky in "I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud"--as sumed both personal and cosmic importance in his poetry. They permitted him to suggest the profound strangeness of things along with the "coincidence of being" in which both he and the external world shared (p. 124). They allowed him to create poems that (in Garber's words) are hierogamies of order. No generation in the past 150 years has had more to learn from Wordsworth than ours, preoccupied with a world disordered, fragmented, and valueless. Words worth shows us how to render it whole, how to be honest in our response to its 2l4</page><page sequence="5">forms, without finessing them or altering them into something more tractable; for what one might unsympathetically call the arrogance of Wordsworth's organized vi sion of wholeness is always in its best moments qualified by his humble acceptance of the limitations of human perception and of the "unknowable otherness" of na ture—limitations based on the psychology of his day to be sure but additionally reflective of his resolution in his encounters with an external reality (espe cially during the Great Decade) to "look steadily at my subject" (Preface to Lyri cal Ballads, l800)—"to treat of things not as they are, but as they appear; not as they exist in themselves, but as they seem to exist to the senses" (Essay, Sup plementary to the Preface, I815). This, according to Garber, is the meaningful Wordsworth for us today. And Garber's analyses of the complexities of Wordsworth's personal struggle to maintain a sense of the presence of things is, despite some turgidity of expression, both subtle and comprehensive. Deserving of special no tice are Garber's readings of poems to demonstrate how well Wordsworth with a po etic control to match his self restraint extended his knowledge of "the deep center of self" (p. 120) and of a world of varied and hierarchic forms without reducing them to abstractions or transmuting them into full-blown symbols.</page></plain_text>
