<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CLASSICAL QUARTERLY JANUARY-APRIL 1941 THE PLACE OF PROTAGORAS IN ATHENIAN PUBLIC LIFE (460-415 B.c.)I PROTAGORAS, of all the ancient philosophers, has perhaps attracted the most interest in modern times. His saying 'Man is the measure of all things' caused Schiller to adopt him as the patron of the Oxford pragmatists, and has generally earned him the title of the first humanist. Yet the exact delineation of his philosophcal position remains a baffling task. Neumann, writing on Die Problematik des 'Homo-mensura' Satzes in 1938,2 concludes that no certainty whatever can be reached on the meaning of the dictum, since 'man', 'measure', and 'things' are all ambiguous, nor can we tell which of the three is the predicate. The time is past when it was believed that a man's philosophy could be understood apart from the events of his life and the circumstances of his age: yet in the case of Protagoras the historical method of approach has hardly been attempted, although the impact of environment was per- haps more decisive in the formation of philosophical concepts in the Greek world than anywhere else. The reality about which the Greek philosopher spoke had three aspects: it was either the one universe of physics, or the political unity, or God. For example, the book of Heracleitus HEpt fJcEwS was divided into three chapters or logoi, A bout the Whole, a political, and a theological.3 Neither physics nor theology supplies from its own subject-matter the form in which this reality was described. The God of the Jews, on whom modern ideas of divinity are founded, is an irresponsible despot, power personified; but Greek thought had, by the sixth century, purged  OGEor of personification, and the idea which it was found to express was not power but unity. Xenophanes, who is well known as a critic of anthropomorphic theology, described God as otdla aYaLpoLssS,4 which he identified with the physical universe;s and both the One of Parmenides6 and the Sphere of Empedocles7 possess the attribute of divinity. The one round universe of the physicist is not a concept which has been formed by the observation of natural phenomena. The universe was conceived to be round because roundness is the most perfect expression of unity ; and the desire for unity is a disposition resting finally on the social and political instincts of humanity. The political aspect of the Greek philosopher's reality is therefore the most funda- mental, and in it, if anywhere, will be found the clue to his more abstract ideas. My object therefore will be to prepare the ground for the correct appreciation of the philosophical contribution of Protagoras by reconstructing his political thought and activity. The historical material in his case is sufficient to yield results which, if not certain, provide at any rate an ElKWjS (0oS. The greater part of the substance of this article was presented in a paper to the Oxford Philological Society in May 1940. The criticisms and suggestions which were made then have been of the greatest value to me when revising and rewriting the whole. 2 Classical Philology, xxxiii, pp. 368 ff. 3 D.L. ix. 5 (Dielss, 22 A.

MORRISON I We may begin by attempting to establish a broad outline and an approximate dating of Protagoras's life. (a) Diogenes Laertius states (ix. 56): 'Apollodorus says that he [Pr.] lived seventy years and was a public teacher for forty, and that he attained his akme in the eighty- fourth Olympiad' [444-441 B.c.]. This scheme is clearly founded on two statements known to us: i. Plato, Meno, 91 e: that Protagoras 'died nearly seventy years old and having practised for forty years'. ii. Heraclides Ponticus HEp' vodwv (ap. D.L. ix. 50): that Protagoras wrote laws for the colony of Thurii (founded 443). Apollodorus apparently placed his akme in the year of the founding of Thurii, just as he makes Herodotus and Empedocles, who are also said to have gone to Thurii, forty years of age in the same year, and Xenophanes forty years of age in the year of the founding of Elea.' Diogenes's mention of the Olympiad only must be a gratuitous imprecision, since Apollodorus dated by archons, not Olympiads. Apollodorus there- fore uses no evidence not known to us, and he can accordingly be neglected. (b) The only useful contribution to the dating of Protagoras is made by Plato in the dialogue which bears his name. Protagoras is made to say (Prot. 317 c): 'And yet many are the years which I have now spent in my profession, for indeed I have lived many years altogether: there is not one of all of you whose father I might not be in age.' Socrates was in his seventy-first year in 399 (Apology, r7 d; Crito, 52 e). If then the dramatic date of the dialogue may be established, we can calculate the least age of Protagoras at that date. The dramatic date of the Protagoras. Athenaeus (v. 218 b) charges Plato with committing serious anachronisms. Clearly, if Plato is consistently careless in his indications of dramatic date, the remark of Protagoras is valueless for our purpose. On the other hand, there is a distinction to be drawn between persistent carelessness and occasional trivial time-references irrecon- cilable with the main consensus. There are three indications consistent with a dramatic date of about 433 B.C. i. The opening words (309 a) imply that Alcibiades is only just recently to be called a man. It must be inferred that he had just finished his ephebate and thus been admitted to his full rights as a man and a citizen. Since he served at Potidaea in 432, his ephebate cannot have ended later than 433, possibly a year or two earlier.2 ii. Pericles and his sons, who died in 429, are spoken of as still living (319 e). iii. The presence at Athens of Hippias (315 c), whose state, Elis, was a member of the Peloponnesian League, is only possible either before the outbreak of the Archidamian war (431) or after the Peace of Nicias. We can infer from the Hippias Major that he was at Athens before the war (see below, p. 5). The references which Athenaeus holds to be inconsistent with the date of 433 are likewise three. i. He says that Hipponicus, the father of Protagoras's host Callias, is assumed to be dead although he did not actually die till shortly before 421. He presumably takes the assumption to be implicit in the phrase (311 a) Tapd KaAAla 70o 'InroviKov and in the statement that the room given to Prodicus was the one 'which Hipponicus formerly used as a strong-room' (315 d). Burnet denied the necessity of inferring Hipponicus's death from the first passage.3 He cited the phrase dE 70o IHoAEjLadpXov x Jacoby, Apollodors Chronik, Philologische Untersuchungen, xvi, p. 268. 2 Taylor, Plato, the Man and His Work, p. 236. 3 Greek Philosophy I: Thales to Plato, p. IIII.</page><page sequence="3">THE PLACE OF PROTAGORAS IN ATHENIAN PUBLIC LIFE 3 (Rep. 328 b) which can be used of the house in which Polemarchus's father and brothers are living. But the parallel is not apt, since Cephalus is drawn as a very old man who has resigned the care of the things of this world into the hands of his son and is interested only in the next, while Hipponicus, who was vigorous enough to be strategos in 427, is unlikely to have given up the direction of his house in 433" The two passages of the Protagoras require the conclusion that Hipponicus had ceased to live at his house, but not that he was dead. There is evidence to corroborate this situation. Hipponicus divorced his first wife,I the mother of Callias, and she subse- quently married Pericles (Prot. 315 a; Plut.Pericles, 24. 5): further, the quarrels between Callias and his father were apparently the subject of the Callias of Aeschines of Sphettus.2 It is then not improbable that Hipponicus left his wife and son in the possession of his house and set up an establishment elsewhere, and that when his mother became the wife of Pericles Callias used the house as his own. ii. The second charge of anachronism brought by Athenaeus is equally refutable. He says that Amipsias did not number Protagoras among the company of phrontistai in the Connus of 423, although Eupolis represented him as resident in Athens in the Colaces of 421. He infers that Protagoras did not return to Athens until after 423. There is, however, nothing in this conclusion to prevent Protagoras being present in Athens in 433. We shall see that it is likely that he would have left Athens after the decree of Diopithes in 4303 and that there were special reasons for his return again at the time of Alcibiades's entry into public life in 422. iii. The third charge must be admitted. The Agrii of Pherecrates, to which Protagoras alludes in the dialogue (327 d), was performed at the Lenaea of 421. There is no reason to question Athenaeus's statement, which may rest on the play-lists themselves. A review of the time-references as a whole shows that the general consensus as well as the most important of them favours a dramatic date of 433. The single dis- cordant reference is trivial and may well be due to an oversight. If, as the Colaces of Eupolis indicates, Protagoras was in Athens in 421, he is likely to have seen and commented upon the Agrii, which apparently dealt with 'Life according to Nature'; a subject in which, as a political theorist, he is likely to have been interested. Plato may have remembered the connexion between the play and Protagoras and have for- gotten that he saw it on his third and not on his second visit. Alternatively, he may have been conscious of the anachronism, but have thought it trivial enough not to disturb the reader. On the assumption that 433 is the dramatic date Socrates, who was in his seventy- first year in 399, would be in his thirty-seventh year at the time of the dialogue. To be his father KaO' 7ALKlaV Protagoras must have been at the very least in his fifty-first year. In the Meno Plato says that he died at the age of nearly seventy, i.e. in his seventieth year. If he was at least fifty in 433, his seventieth year would fall at the latest in 414. The date of Protagoras's death. There are two passages which have been used to determine the date of Protagoras's death. i. Diogenes Laertius, ix. 54: 'Pythodorus the son of Polyzelus, one of the Four Hundred, brought an accusation against him.' ii. Ibid. 55: 'Philochorus says that when he was sailing to Sicily his ship was wrecked, and that Euripides refers to this event enigmatically in the Ixion. Some say that he perished on the journey having lived ninety years.' Probably before 453, Busolt, Gr. Gesch. iii. i. 504. 2 H. Krauss, Aesch. Socr. Reliquiae, 90, 163. 3 See below, p. 6.</page><page sequence="4">4 J. s. MORRISON In face of the testimony of Plato, Meno 91 e, the tradition of a life of ninety years, which appears also in the scholion on Plato, Republic, 6oo00 c, need not be taken into account. Jacoby' suggests that it rests on a confusion of koppa (9), the symbol of ninety, with omicron, the symbol of seventy. The two passages taken together have given rise to the inference that Protagoras was accused at the time of the rule of the Four Hundred, fled to Sicily, and died either on the voyage or shortly after. This inference is responsible for the date assigned usually to the Ixion.2 There is no justification for it. Pythodorus was one of the Athenian representatives at the conclusion of peace in 421, and of the alliance with Sparta which followed it.3 He was then one of the conservative party who had always been opposed to the war and friendly with Sparta, and who finally brought about the oligarchical revolution of 411. The connexions of Protagoras, on the other hand, were all with the war-party, Pericles, and Callias, whose half-sister married Alcibiades. There were at least two occasions, in 418 and again, in 415, when the peace-party might have taken advantage of the unpopularity of Alcibiades to rid themselves of Protagoras. Either of these dates agrees with the testimony of Plato: the date of 41x does not. There is no reason why we should not accept Philochorus's story of the shipwreck of Protagoras and of Euripides's reference to it. The assump- tion implicit in the narrative of Diogenes, that the event occurred on Protagoras's last journey to Sicily, may also be adopted. There is one piece of evidence to suggest that the death of Protagoras occurred before 415. The Argument to the Busiris of Isocrates tells how Euripides in the Palamedes (Nauck 591) referred enigmatically to Socrates's death with the words: EKcWETE, EKW'EE T7LV 7TCNYwOcOV, CT) dJvcol, orv oi3)v' c&amp;Ayvovcrav c&amp;byova Movevr, and that all the audience wept. Aelian (Var. Hist. 2. 8) is evidence that the Palamedes was acted in 415.4 There can then be no reference to the death of Socrates, to whom anyhow the phrase 'all-wise nightingale of the Muses'and the parallel with Palamedes the great inventor is scarcely apt. In the Phaedrus (26I d) Plato calls Zeno, who could demonstrate many paradoxes, 'the Eleatic Palamedes'; and the name might well cloak a reference to any purveyor of new and strange doctrines. Euripides may then have designed an allusion to Protagoras, if he died after being forced to leave Athens shortly before 415 :s nor can one fail to suspect that Philochorus, when he says that Euripides referred to the death of Protagoras enigmatically in the Ixion, has made a mistake and is thinking of the passage in the Palamedes. The outline of Protagoras's life. At the beginning of the Protagoras, the scene of which we have placed in 433, the young Hippocrates says (3Ioe) that he was still a ~~aS, i.e. less than fourteen years of age, when Protagoras was in Athens before. There is no clear indication of Hippocrates's age. He does, however, say that he has come to Socrates to get him to speak to the great teacher on his behalf, partly because he is rather young and partly because he has never seen or heard Protagoras before. We may, I think, infer that Hippocrates SAp. Chr., p. 269. 2 A fact overlooked by Diels (80 A. i) when he uses the date to confirm the inference. There is no evidence for the Ixion's date. 3 Thuc. v. 19.2;24. I. 4 See Clinton, Fasti Helleniciz, 415. 4. s Bury (History of Greece, p. 388) states cate- gorically that Euripides is referring to Prota- goras, and on that ground alone puts his death in 415. The passage is not included in Diels, 80 A.</page><page sequence="5">THE PLACE OF PROTAGORAS IN ATHENIAN PUBLIC LIFE 5 has not yet reached man's estate, although he is old enough to take an interest in Protagoras's teaching and to be independent of his schoolmasters. He is then probably an ephebos, i.e. between eighteen and twenty years of age. Protagoras must accordingly have left Athens at the very least five years before. Heraclides Ponticus (ap. D.L. ix. 50) says that Protagoras wrote laws for Thurii, the colony founded by Pericles in 443. There is no evidence that he went there; but since, as we have seen, he must have left Athens about that time, the founding of the colony provides a good motive for his departure. There was to draw him there, besides his office of lawgiver, the gathering of eminent savants, among them Herodotus and Empedocles, who came to celebrate the foundation. There is possibly a clue to the date of Protagoras's first arrival in Athens. In the Meno Plato says (91 e) that his professional life lasted forty years. Since it is hardly likely that Protagoras only began to devote himself to philosophy at the age of thirty, Plato may have in mind the date when he set up as a public teacher in Athens. If then, according to our argument, he was at least fifty in 433, he must have come to Athens at the age of thirty not later than 453. This dating gives him time enough to have built up a sufficient reputation to be entrusted with the task of making laws for Thurii in 443. In the Hippias Major, which apparently takes place during the years of the Peace of Nicias, Plato makes Hippias reply to Socrates's observation, that it is a long time since he was in Athens, with the boast that Elis has been employing him constantly as an ambassador, particularly to Sparta (281 a-b). The previous visit, then, took place before the Archidamian war, and the circumstance that both he and Protagoras on that occasion were the guests of Callias provides the scene for the Protagoras. Later (282 d-e) he asserts that 'he once went to Sicily; and, although Protagoras was there and had a high reputation and was an older man, he, a much younger man, made a good deal more than a hundred and fifty minae in a short time ...; he brought this sum home with him and gave it to his father, so that he and all the citizens were amazed and dumbfounded'. This expedition of Hippias to Sicily looks like an early venture, before his reputation was established. It is therefore to be placed before 433, and we must suppose that Protagoras proceeded from Thurii to Sicily, where he spent a number of years before his second visit to Athens. The plague constitutes a sufficient reason for Protagoras's second departure from Athens, but it may have been hastened by the attacks which were made on the position of Pericles shortly after the beginning of the war.' Diopithes, probably in 430, proposed a decree to impeach those who did not accept the gods or taught about celestial phenomena, 'casting suspicion on Pericles by means of Anaxagoras' (Plut. Pericles, 32. i). Anaxagoras appears to have been prosecuted and thrown into prison; but with the help of Pericles he escaped to Lampsacus, where he died shortly after.2 Diodorus (xii. 38-9) and Plutarch (Pericles, 31-2) both give these attacks as the reason for Pericles's refusal to repeal the Megarian decree. I accept Adcock's conclusions (C.A.H. v, note 8, pp. 477 ff.) that the decree of Dracontides re- quiring Pericles to submit his accounts of public expenditure must be connected with his trial and deposition in 430, and that the decree of Diopithes was a part of the same offensive. 2 A. E. Taylor (C.Q. xi, 1917, p. 81) argues that Anaxagoras retired to Lampsacus, where he lived until 428, nearly twenty years before the outbreak of war. This conclusion runs contrary to the whole weight of the evidence.

This may be analysed as follows: i. Tradition A: born 500, died 428. ii. Apollodorus: [born 540], flor. 500-497, died 468. Since yEyEviolac is ambiguous, it is possible</page><page sequence="6">6 J. S. MORRISON Plutarch in his Life of Nicias says (xxiii. 3) : 'Men could not abide the natural philo- sophers and "visionaries ", as they were then called, for that they reduced the divine agency down to irrational causes, blind forces, and necessary incidents. Even Protagoras had to go into exile, Anaxagoras was with difficulty rescued from imprison- ment by Pericles, and Socrates, although he had nothing whatever to do with such matters, nevertheless lost his life because of philosophy.'" The order, Protagoras, Anaxagoras, Socrates, suggests that the exile of the first took place before the imprisonment of the second; and the fact that Plutarch attributes the attacks on both Protagoras and Anaxagoras to the same cause makes it reasonable to conclude that it was the decree of Diopithes that led to the flight of Protagoras from Athens as well as to the imprisonment of Anaxagoras. There is no clue to suggest where or how Protagoras spent the years between his second departure from Athens and his return in 422. It may be conjectured that he went to Sicily, where he had stayed before 433 and whither he turned when he had to leave Athens for the third time. to bring Apollodorus into agreement with A by Scaliger's emendation; but he may have pur- posely placed him forty years earlier so as to enable him to be a pupil of Anaximenes, whose death he places in 499 (D.L. ii. 3: see ibid. 6). iii. Demetrius of Phalerum: began to be a philosopher at Athens 456 at the age of twenty. In order to reconcile this statement with the tradition that he was twenty years old at 'the passage of Xerxes' it has been supposed that KaAAov = KaAAtc~ov. Then, by adding tradition B, we get the result that Anaxagoras began to philosophize at Athens at the age of twenty in 480, left in 450 at the age of 50, and spent the last twenty-two years of his life at Lampsacus. The conclusion is impossible because (a) twenty years of age is much too young for Anaxagoras, who had already had a thorough training in Ionian physical science, to have come to Athens; (b) there is plenty of evidence of his activity in Athens down to 430; (c) there is no evidence of his having spent more than a very short time at Lampsacus. (For (b) and (c) see below (2) and (3).) A better solution of the difficulty is to sup- pose that D.L. or a later annotator confused KaAA)lov with KaAAsc8ov and added 6.1v ELKOULV aV. The whole body of tradition recorded by D.L. (with the possible exception of Apollodorus) is then in harmony: Anaxagoras came to Athens at the age of fifty-seven in 457, spent twenty- seven years there (the thirty years of tradition B is a near enough approximation), and retired to Lampsacus in 429 where he died in the following year. iv. Tradition B: lived in Athens thirty years. (2) Close connexion with Pericles: teacher, D.L. ii. i3, Plat. Phaedr. 269 e, Isocr. xv. 235, Plut. Pericl. 6 (incident shortly before 442), Cic.

There is no reason to doubt the tradition that he was a very sick man at the time of his trial. This lends colour to the inference that the trial was the result of the decree of Diopithes (430) which Plutarch (Pericles, 32. I) says was directed against Anaxagoras (cf. Diodorus, xii. 39); and that it was immediately followed by his flight and death. One authority alone is in disagreement with this conclusion. According to D.L. ii. 12 'Satyrus in the Lives says that the charge [against Anaxagoras] was brought by Thucydides [son of Melesias] in his campaign against Pericles; and that it was a charge of medism as well as impiety; and that he was condemned to death in his absence.' It is not at all unlikely that in the struggle which resulted in the ostracism of Thucydides and the final triumph of Pericles attacks were made on the friends of the latter, just as they were when his position was begin- ning to weaken in 430. This may have been one of the reasons for Protagoras's mission to Thurii in 443. It may be noted that the charge of medism is hardly compatible with the story (x. iii above) that Anaxagoras came to Athens at the time of the expedition of Xerxes. If he came with the invaders, he is unlikely to have remained as a guest. STransl. B.

It may be argued that Plato, who can put doctrines into the mouth of Socrates which it is impossible that he ever held, is not to be relied on as a historian of other men's ideas. On the other hand, he has obviously taken such pains to characterize the speakers in the Protagoras, which is perhaps the most vividly dramatic of all the dialogues, that it seems inconceivable that he should not also put into their mouths the most characteristic of their doctrines. In the Theaetetus, which is more seriously philosophical, Plato seems to take special trouble to distinguish between the doctrines which are purely Protagorean and those which are his own development of them. This preoccupation is so marked that we can be confident of the authenticity of the former. Both dialogues further attribute to Protagoras an identical doctrine of human society. Let us first consider the Protagoras. Protagoras professes to teach his pupil (318 e) Efl3ovAla rTEpt rE 7rv OtKEWlKdV OW~s v dlpuxra rijv a6ro37 Ot~taV ~JWLKO~, iaZ nTEP1 r6v rijs 7TO'EWSP&amp;"s ~r&amp;W r7s~ 71 TOAEIJS'~ 8tvvar~aroS' Lv EfL? Kat TrpD77-EWV KaG AE'yVw. Socrates seizes on the latter point. 'You teach then', he says, 'the political art and offer to make men good at politics.' He denies that 'being good at politics' is a thing that can be taught; and brings the evidence of the many, the Athenian people, and of the wise, Pericles, to support his contention. He is, in fact, pointing out that to train people, as Protagoras does, to be 8vvarol in public life is against the current theory of democracy. He proceeds: the Athenian assembly demands expert advice on professional matters, while in any business connected with the policy of the state it is ready to listen to anyone-' smith, shoemaker, merchant, sea-captain, rich man, poor man, of good family or of none' (319 d). Pericles again did not believe that 'being good at politics'was teachable, since he left the education of his sons in the hands of others. Protagoras is in an extremely difficult position. He must either admit his pro- fession to be a fraud or declare the theory of the Athenian democracy to be false and his patron Pericles to be ignorant of the true nature of ,roA~7LK &amp;PE74. His reply exhibits the utmost address. He apparently harmonizes the teachability of the political art with the principle of the democracy on the lines of his apophthegm (Dielss, B. 3) wEews' Kat cLUYK7cOWS ~6acKaa ' ?7a,. In reality he shows that the Athenian people themselves subscribe to the two incompatible principles, and thus absolves himself from the charge of subverting the democracy. The reply (320 c-328 d) may be summarized as follows. By means of a myth illustrating the rise of human societies Protagoras shows that Al&amp;t and ZlK7) are necessary to political association, and that all men therefore who</page><page sequence="8">8 J. s. MORRISON associate in communities are equipped equally with these fundamentals of political virtue. He supports the conclusion of the myth by noticing how, in the matter of flute-playing, a man is thought mad if he professes to be good at it when he is not, whereas in the matter of justice a man is thought mad if he says he is unjust when he actually is so. The reason for the anomaly must be that everyone is not naturally a flute-player, whereas everyone is naturally just. He thus reasserts the democratic principle which Socrates had declared to be incompatible with the teaching of virtue. He proceeds to prove from a consideration of the theory of punishment that the teachability of virtue is also recognized by the Athenians. Men are not punished by the city when they are bad by chance or nature, but when they are so by their own fault. It must then be recognized that they are unjust by their own fault and that virtue is teachable. In conclusion of this part of the argument he asserts (324 c): 'thus I have shown that your fellow-citizens have good reason for admitting a smith's or a cobbler's counsel in public affairs, and that they hold virtue to be taught and procured: of this I have given you satisfactory demonstration as it seems to me.' The argument is all very well; but it must be realized that it is based entirely on the ambiguity of the phrase ,ya0o0 ,roAZaa. Protagoras had said originally that he taught Ei3/ovALa in public affairs 'so that his pupil might exert the full power of his personality in action and in speech' (319 a). But the 'political virtue' about which he has latterly been arguing is not 'being good at politics' but good citizenship, the sense of responsibility a man feels as a member of a state (al/&amp;;s, 81K~7, aLKaLOoV7). The principle of the Cleisthenic democracy, in which every citizen had in theory an equal chance of the highest offices of state, was that no one was better qualified than anyone else by breeding, intellectual power, or specific training, to direct public policy. Protagoras professed to train leaders: and there is no doubt that he was subverting the Cleisthenic democracy. He shelters, with an adroitness worthy of the first of the 'sophists', under the ambiguity of a phrase. The two meanings of 'political virtue' continue to be confused in the second part of the argument (324 d-328 d). Turning to the assertion of Socrates that the 'wisest and best' of the citizens are not able to hand on to others this virtue which they possess, Protagoras appeals to Socrates to reflect 'whether or not there is one thing which all citizens must possess if there is to be a city'. If such a thing exists and is 'justice and prudence and observ- ance of religion ', then it is ridiculous to suppose that good men do not teach it to their sons. The child, as soon as ever it can understand speech, is instructed by mother, father, nurse, pedagogue, in these very things, by force if necessary. Next, the boy is sent to school, where he learns EtKoColea; and to the trainer so that his body may not fail his XPrlcm &amp;Civoza. This education is given to their children by those who are best able to do so, and those are best able who are the richest. When the young man leaves his teachers he comes under the direct influence of the city, which compels him to observe the laws. These, laid down by the good lawgivers of old, are a guide for his inexperienced steps: according to them he must rule and be ruled. As to the assertion that good men's sons turn out badly, Protagoras replies that they may be bad com- pared with the good, but they will be good compared with Pherecrates's diyptot, savages living in no community. There must be an innate substratum of 'political virtue' on which the educator can build. This substratum is common to all members of a state: it may, however, be improved and increased by education. Throughout the greater part of the latter argument, Protagoras is using 'political virtue' in the sense of 'good citizenship'; but it must be remembered that he sets out to show that 'the wisest and best' of the citizens, e.g. Pericles, do transmit their virtue to their sons; and it is very telling when he asserts that the richest parents can give their sons the best education, and so enable them to achieve the highest</page><page sequence="9">THE PLACE OF PROTAGORAS IN ATHENIAN PUBLIC LIFE 9 degree of political virtue. The virtue of a Pericles was not a high sense of public duty but 'being good at politics', the ability to lead; and when he says that the richest people have the highest degree of political virtue, he can only be explaining how such people come to occupy leading positions in the state. We may infer from the arguments which Protagoras uses that he taught 'good citizenship', propounding a doctrine of the state based on an evolutionary theory of human society. This evolutionary theory was probably inherited by him from the materialistic thought of the Ionian cities. The seventh and eighth chapters of the first book of Diodorus contain an account of cosmology, of the development of living creatures, and of the rise of civilization which, to judge from its physical theories, must derive from a pre-Atomistic Ionian source.' The account of the rise of civilization bears strong resemblances to the myth of Protagoras: Diodorus i. 8. ? I.

As the sun dried the earth, the surface becom- ing fermented by the heat, 'portions of the wet swelled up in masses in many places, and, in these, pustules (a',r1Eves) covered with delicate membranes made their appearance.... And the wet being impregnated with life by the heat in the manner described, the living things forthwith received their nourishment by night from the mist which fell from the enveloping air, and by day were made solid by the heat.' Finally all forms of animal life were produced, which went to their respective places according to the amount of each element within them. When the earth's crust became too hard, this process of spontaneous generation ceased. Reinhardt (Hekataeus von Abdera und De- mokritus, Hermes, 1912, pp. 492ff.) rightly Protagoras, 321 c ff. When man, last of the creatures, emerged from the earth, Prometheus 'in perplexity as to what means of preserva- tion he could devise for man' stole from Heaven 'wisdom in the arts together with fire'. Thus man acquired wisdom observed that these sections are not Epicurean but go back to Hecataeus of Abdera in common with the later chapters (io ff.): he concluded that they contain the doctrine of Democritus. Dahlmann (De philosoph. graec. sententiis ad loquellae originem pertinentibus: Diss. Lips. 1928, pp. 23 ff.) argues against this attribution: his main contention, with which I agree, is that it is impossible that a cosmology which exhibits not the slightest trace of Atomistic doctrine (the 'bodies', acdkara, of ? I are no more Atomistic than the tpip of Empedocles) should be Demo- critean: it must then be pre-Atomistic. This conclusion is confirmed by the remarkable re- semblance between the second stage of the Dio- dorian cosmogony and the description of Chaos in the Timaeus (52 d ff.), which, as Cornford (Plato's Cosmology, pp. 198 ff.) points out, is cer- tainly pre-Atomistic. The next stage in the Timaeus is the intervention of the demiurge, who takes over Chaos and begins to give the elements 'distinct configurations by means of shapes and numbers': the Diodorian cosmogony continues to be purely mechanical. Plato only uses the materialistic account as a foundation for his idealistic superstructure: Diodorus sets out the materialistic theory itself. The Diodorian zoogony recalls the famous theory of Anaximander (Aatius, v. 19. 4: cf. Censorinus, 4. 7) that 'the first living creatures were engendered in the wet element enclosed in spiny membranes': and it is likely that Diogenes of Apollonia propounded a similar doctrine, since Aristophanes, who attributes to the scientists of the Socratic phrontisterion other theories of Diogenes, calls them y7y~7EVE (Clouds, 853).</page><page sequence="10">o10 J.

'In fine, in all things necessity herself was man's teacher, sup- plying in appropriate fashion instruction in every matter to a creature which was well endowed by nature and had as its assistants for every purpose hands and speech and a ready intelligence.' Protagoras, 321 c ff. of daily life, but not the political art. He worshipped the gods, and 'was soon enabled by his skill to articulate speech and to invent dwellings, clothes, sandals, beds, and foods from the earth'. But since he had no cities, he was destroyed by the wild beasts. 'So they sought to bind themselves to- gether and secure their lives by founding cities. Now as often as they were banded together they did wrong to one another through the lack of civic art, and thus they began to be scattered again and perish. So Zeus fearing that our race was in danger of utter destruction sent Hermes to bring Aidos and Dike among men, to the end that there should be regulation of cities and friendly ties to draw them together.' Then Hermes asked Zeus in what manner he was to give men Dike and Aidos: 'Am I to deal them out as the arts have been dealt? ... Am I to place among men Dike and Aidos in this way also, or deal them out to all?' 'To all', replied Zeus; 'let all have their share; for cities cannot be formed if only a few have a share of these as of other arts. And make a law of my ordaining, that he who cannot partake of Aidos and Dike shall die the death as a public pest.'2 There is often a striking similarity in phrasing between the accounts in Diodorus and Protagoras,3 and it is clear that the two use the same elements, if the mytho- logical form of Protagoras's story requires him to arrange them in a different order, and to replace the mechanical forces of Necessity and Trial-and-error (dvcdyK and 7rpa) by Prometheus and Zeus. We can then with confidence identify the evolu- tionary element in Protagoras's political thought as his inheritance from Ionian materialism. The idea that mutual respect is the foundation of city life is a common- place in the political thought of the time.4 To these theories of the genesis and nature of society Protagoras seems to have added a theory of government and social progress The close connexion of the anthropology with the cosmogony and zoogony is shown by the similar process of evolution of types by the action of the 'like-to-like' principle in all three. 2 I use, with slight alterations, Lamb's transla- tion (Loeb). 3 oACEiOasa D., 7Td~AOS P.: of war with wild beasts.

The Theaetetus gives a more detailed account of Protagoras's theory of political leadership. The question has been asked (161 e), how, if man is the measure of his own know- ledge, as Protagoras himself says, Protagoras can set up to be wiser than others. Socrates puts the following defence in the mouth of the sophist, which, it is particu- larly emphasized (166 c), is that which Protagoras would have made if he had been alive (166 d-i67 c). 'Forz I do indeed assert that the truth is as I have written: each one of us is a measure of what is and what is not: but there is all the difference in the world between one man and another just in the very fact that what is and appears to one is different from what is and appears to the other .... By a wise man I mean precisely a man who can change any one of us, when what is bad appears and is to him, and make what is good appear and be to him .. .' A man is able to make another have good opinions by implanting in him a good its of the soul. Doctors and husband- men are both examples of wise men: they implant good kELS in the objects of their care. 'And moreover I assert that wise and honest statesmen substitute in the com- munity sound for unsound views of what is right. For I hold that whatever practices seem right and laudable to any particular state are so for that state, so long as it holds by them. Only, when the practices are, in any particular case, unsound for them, the wise man substitutes others that are and appear sound.' The constant changing of laws in the democratic state had seemed to some2 to detract from their 'seriousness', i.e. their superhuman quality.3 Protagoras restores this quality by regarding them as the expression of the mass-mind of the body politic, which is superhuman in the sense that it is an entity greater than the sum of its human parts. The right activity of the statesman is clearly set forth: it is to guide, improve, and, presumably, implement the common purpose of the city. His function is the same as that which 'the good lawgivers of old' of the Protagoras (326 d) performed. We may now turn from the theory of Protagoras that the state is best governed if its leaders are those who, being the richest, have the best opportunity of becoming wise and thus of possessing that knowledge which puts them in the same relation to the city as the sophist to his pupils, the doctor to the sick, and the husbandman to his plants; and proceed to consider the political circumstances at Athens which attended its formulation. III 'It is the strategia that gives to the Athenian democracy in the latter half of the fifth century its peculiar character. The institution of the strategia is sometimes regarded as marking a stage in the development of the democracy. If by this it is meant that it marks a stage in the development of the democratic principle in the constitution, nothing could be further from the truth. The strategia was the non- democratic element in the constitution, and it was the substitution of the strategia for the archonship as the chief executive office that strengthened the aristocratic and conservative influences in the state. .. . What is of still more moment is that it was the strategia that gave the opportunity for one-man power in the democratic constitution. . . . It is hardly too much to say that, if Athens created, organized, and held a great empire, it was in virtue of the undemocratic principle contained in the democratic constitution.'4 The growth in importance of the board of generals and in particular the virtual I use Professor Cornford's translation: Plato's Theory of Knowledge, p. 70 f. 2 e.g. Hippias in Xen.

MORRISON domination of Athenian public life by Pericles during the twenty years which pre- ceded the Archidamian war had led to a new theory of the principle of government. The Cleisthenic theory had been that the city's will would be done if an indiscriminate selection of the equal people ruled in turn. On the new theory, the people, still holding the supreme power in its hands, is advised and led by the men who are most suited for leadership by talent and position.I This theory is certainly undemocratic in the Cleisthenic sense; but it would be rash to say that the people was any less powerful under Pericles than it was before: it is rather that the means of exercise of popular power had changed, either to meet new conditions, or because the Cleisthenic theory had proved unsatisfactory in practice. Pericles, giving an analysis of the Athenian democracy in the funeral speech (Thuc. ii. 37. i), stresses the equal chance all have of exhibiting their merit, but omits entirely any mention of the principle of sortition. The constitutional debate in the third book of Herodotus is part of 'the Persian history' which has been shown by Powell2 to have been composed, and probably published, at Athens between 448 and 442 B.c., i.e. during the first period of Pericles's ascendancy and when Protagoras had already been some years in Athens. The seven Persian nobles who had liberated Persia from the Magi take council together as to which of the three constitutional forms, democracy, oligarchy, and monarchy, is the best (iii. 80 ff.). The debate is plainly designed to lay the Athenian public by the ears; it dramatizes the constitutional struggle which was being fought out at Athens in the first decade of the second half of the fifth century between the supporters of the Cleisthenic democracy, the oligarchical party under the leadership of Thucydides son of Melesias, and the supporters of Pericles. Otanes (80. 2) advises Es pi'ov JIHpoaBo KaraGE vatL 7d1 irp ypara. He condemns monarchy on the ground that even the best of men, elevated to that position, cannot remain unchanged. He must fall a victim to two vices, Hybris and Phthonos, and will inevitably turn out a tyrant. The rule of the people, on the other hand, avoids the danger of tyranny: 'it has the fairest of all names, Isonomia'. Otanes characterizes popular rule thus: cdAoAp pv &amp;pXs dapXEt, t;evEOvvov 8E apOx'V EXEt, "ovAEVara 84 niviraa dE TO KOLVtV dvavC pE. The first place given to sortition shows that it is the Cleisthenic type of democracy which he champions. Megabyxus (81. I) favours oligarchy. He sympathizes with the desire of Otanes to avoid tyranny, but takes a very different view of the qualification of the people to rule: 'nothing', he says, 'is more unintelligent and full of Hybris than the useless mob.... Whatever the tyrant does he does with a policy, but the people are not even able to devise a policy; how could they, who have no education nor have seen for themselves what is best, but rush through their measures with blind precipitancy like a river in spate?' Rather 'let us choose a company of the best men and invest them with the power: for we ourselves shall be of this number and the decisions of the best men are naturally the best '. Megabyxus puts the selfish and bigoted point of view of an aristocracy in retreat. Theognis3 at the beginning of the fifth century and the anonymous author of the Constitution of Athens4 at the end exhibit the same attitude. It is reasonable to attribute it also to the party of Thucydides. Darius (82) speaks last in support of monarchy. He agrees with Megabyxus's I Cf.

He argues that oligarchy, where many are rivalling each other in the exercise of virtue, leads in the end to faction, which results in monarchy.

The majority of the seven decide in favour of monarchy. The arguments of Darius in favour of a monarchos follow very closely the argu- ments which must have been used to justify the ascendancy of Pericles. Efficient administration demands the elevation of the best man to the highest post, and in time of war this is more necessary than ever. Darius's description of the evolution of monarchy from democracy describes exactly the rise of Pericles. The monarchos is the popular champion whose first duty is to put a stop to the corruption and inefficiency of popular government: he becomes the idol of the people, and this idolization puts him finally in supreme control. When Otanes suggests as a method of selecting the monarchos, besides the lot, which is obviously unacceptable to the supporters of oligarchy and monarchy alike, also the course of submitting to the popular vote of the Persians, it can hardly be doubted that Herodotus has Pericles in mind. It is to be noted that the monarchos of Darius exercises the powers which he derives from the people entirely in their interest: there is no question of his becoming a tyrant: being the best man he will govern blamelessly. He is then in all respects similar to the 'wise and honest statesman' of Protagoras. We may suspect that Herodotus derived the material of Darius's speech from Protagoras, and that the position of the latter in the circle of Pericles was due to his ability to provide a theoretical backing to the practice of the Periclean democracy. Otanes had condemned monarchy on the ground that, however good a man may be, he is bound to be corrupted by it. Sophocles presents in the Antigone, which was produced in the spring of 441, a picture of a ruler who in spite of the best initial professions soon acts and speaks like the worst of tyrants. There is much in the play to suggest that the dramatist knew and used the theories of Protagoras. Creon, who, incidentally, is called c oupairryd by Antigone in the opening speech (8), has proclaimed in the assembly of the people (7rav8p 7AdhEt) the dishonouring of the dead Polynices, threatening ?dvov 8~CdAEvaerov I TAdhE for any who disobeys (36); and Ismene represents Antigone's proposed disobedience as /3li 7roArcv 8paiy as well as contrary to the $@/os of the ruler (60, 79). She assumes, as Creon himself presumably believes, that he is performing the will of the city. Creon's first speech (160-21o) is a proclamation of the principles on which his rule will be based, fearless prosecution of 4pwua 0ovAEVLa'ra (the superlative of EflovAta) and subjection of private ties to the good of the state. He emphasizes particularly the supremacy of the claims of rdIrpa. Following these principles and in spite of some opposition, he has deprived Polynices of burial. When the ceremonial interment is discovered, the chorus suggest that it was 'wrought by the gods' (278). At this Creon is outraged: A~'~ys ydp oK aVEK7a, 8atovaS d MAywv 'rpdVOtav LUXEV 70To o701 VEKpo) aip: Polynices made war against the land and its gods, who must then be hostile to him. Creon is blind to the possi- bility that the gods, if they are, as he believes them, purely national deities expressing, as it were, the unity and purpose of the city, may yet be against him if he is not acting in harmony with the city's will. It is remarkable that a scene in which the dramatist has appeared to be aware of Protagoras's theories should conclude with a chorus (332-83) celebrating the achievements of mankind. At the climax of the account</page><page sequence="14">14 J. s. MORRISON stands the development of &amp;crrvv7yoL dpyal (equivalent to acd&amp;s, 8l~?)): the chorus concludes (369) 'honouring the laws of his land and justice ... he stands high in his city (t;$i'oAtS); unsociable (T"oAtS), when that which is not good is his companion by reason of his recklessness' (-rAota, the opposite of ad18s). When the perpetrator of the forbidden act is discovered to be Antigone and she is brought before Creon, she claims (450 ff.) that his proclamation proceeds not from Zeus or Dike, asserting her allegiance to 'the unwritten, steadfast decrees of the gods '; and she alleges that the city is on her side (509). If the city is on her side, then Creon has ceased to be its leader in the Protagorean sense, one who expresses its will: this role has devolved upon Antigone, who, in the words of Creon himself, has not been afraid to pursue cptcra PovAEVbLTara. Creon is become a leader in the repressive sense, a tyrant. That he has the mind of a tyrant soon becomes evident. To his son, in whose presence he does not have to mince his words, he declares (666 f.): cdAA' &amp;~v ~To'AtS UT7U~EtE TOV8E XP17 KAVEtV) Ka, oLKp, Ka, &amp;,KaLa KaZ Lravavrlta. He does not realize that election does not confer on him the authority of the city once and for all: he retains it only so long as he remains sensitive to its wishes.

The moral of the Antigone appears to be that rulers should take lessons of Prota- goras. Creon's tragedy has arisen from his misconception of the nature of rulership. Tyranny does not arise from the wickedness of rulers but only from their ignorance. This is a complete answer to the objection made by Otanes to the rule of a single man, and it is an answer worthy of a great educator like Protagoras. Without educa- tion a man is perhaps unequal to the strain which despotism puts upon his character: but once he has learnt the true nature of leadership, power will offer no temptations. The Athenians, who observed that their leader Pericles was a pupil of Protagoras, must have found comfort in Sophocles's play: and that is doubtless what they were meant to find. IV Pericles died in 429, and his policy was reversed at the conclusion of peace by the oligarchical party in 42i. What reason had Protagoras then for returning to Athens</page><page sequence="15">THE PLACE OF PROTOGORAS IN ATHENIAN PUBLIC LIFE 15 in 422? The answer to this question lies, I believe, in the ambitions of Alcibiades. An Alcmaeonid and the ward of Pericles, he would have been only true to his birth and upbringing if he aimed at securing for himself the position of rpo7o7r 70U- s ov: and there must have been those who in view of his outstanding personality and brilliant parts had marked him down for that career, and who saw in the renewal of the aristocratic leadership of a Pericles a method of terminating the plebeian demagogy of a Cleon. The death of Cleon in 422 left the field clear for Alcibiades. After a false start, in which his attempt to take the lead in the peace negotiations with Sparta had met with a rebuff, he settled down to work against the peace and in favour of an alliance with Mantinea and Argos. In 420 he was elected general. The Supplices of Euripides has, on the ground of its plot, been dated in the period immediately succeeding the peace. The mothers of the heroes killed in the unsuccessful attempt of Adrastus, king of Argos, to restore Polynices to Thebes come as suppliants to Theseus, king of Athens. They ask him to help them recover their dead from Creon. Theseus at first refuses; but yielding at last to the persuasion of his mother secures the surrender of the dead after he has defeated the Thebans in battle. Adrastus promises undying gratitude from Argos to Athens; and Athena bids Theseus not to let him go until he has sworn that Argos will never invade Attica or allow others to invade it. There can be little doubt that the play is intended to further the Argive-Athenian alliance for which Alcibiades was working. In it can also be found propaganda in favour of a democracy guided by a noble leader. It is strongly emphasized that the rule of Theseus was no tyranny: replying to Creon's herald, who has inquired for the tyrant of the city, Theseus declares (403 ff.) that he was wrong in asking for a tyrant in Athens: 'for the city is not ruled by a single man but is free: the people is the master through its yearly successions in office turn and turn about'. On the other hand, Adrastus says to Theseus (188 ff.): 'Your city alone could undertake this task; for she can sympathize with us and has in you a young and noble shepherd, for the want of which many cities have perished lacking a leader (EIVsEEZS u'pa7Ai-ov).' The purpose of the word vavtsl can hardly have been other than to turn the thoughts of the audience to Alcibiades, when the whole play stresses the traditional friendship of Argos for Athens which he was working to renew. There are in the play other passages which recall the doctrines of Protagoras. Theseus remarks that Adrastus in leading the expedition to Thebes followed E13 vxla rather than ElfovA"a: a course, Adrastus adds, which has been the downfall of many a leader (161 f.). Adrastus concludes his panegyric on the dead heroes with the words (909 ff.) : 'After what I have said, Theseus, do not wonder that these dared to die before Thebes. For good upbringing gives Aidos, and every man who has been trained in what is good is ashamed to be a coward. Manliness is teachable: for is not a child taught to speak and understand things of which it has no knowledge ? Whatever a man learns, that he preserves all his life. So educate your children well.' In his reply to the first request of Adrastus for aid, Theseus argues in favour of a divine provi- dence against an opponent who had denied it. His speech (195 ff.) takes the form of a relation of the blessings bestowed upon man by the god who brought him out of his first beast-like condition. The traditional atheism of Protagoras need not stand in the way of our attribution of a speech in defence of rpdvota 8Eo0f to his influence. The history of civilization could be regarded as teleological either in a scientific or religious sense: and the two senses merge into each other as the philosopher identifies the purpose of nature with God. By a fortunate chance a direct connexion can be found between the conception of TrpdvoQa 0Eo0 and the myth of the Protagoras.

If we are right in supposing that Herodotus used Protagorean doctrine in the constitutional debate earlier in Book III, it seems reasonable to infer that he also relied on him later: this is a simpler hypothesis than to suppose that Herodotus and the myth depend on a common source. This philosophical God, like Plato's demiurge, has nothing what- ever to do with 'the gods' about whom Protagoras professed he knew nothing' and whose existence or non-existence he expressly refused to discuss in his speeches and writings.z It can hardly be a chance that Protagorean philosophical matter, in particular the doctrine of the led democracy, and a plot emphasizing the traditional friendship of Argos and Athens are to be found in the same play. When we know that Protagoras returned to Athens in 422, the conclusion is almost certain that he came to support and advise Alcibiades in his attempt to emulate the career of Pericles. The attempt was a failure. Alcibiades's Peloponnesian policy received a set-back in the events which led up to the Spartan victory at Mantinea; and Sparta threatened to invade Attica. This was enough to put the peace-party back into power; and Alcibiades was defeated in the elections for the strategia in 418. It may have been in this year that Pythodorus struck at Protagoras; or the oligarchical peace-party may have waited until Alcibiades's disgrace in 415. Whatever the accusation was that caused him to leave Athens once more, it had no effect upon his reputation, since Plato can make Socrates say in 4033 that the high esteem in which he was held during his life had remained undiminished since his death.
