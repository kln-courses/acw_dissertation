<plain_text><page sequence="1">386 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW However, the fact that parts of a system had not changed does not necessarily mean that the overall structure remains the same. Archaeological work in Palestine, Arabia and Syria has shown major changes to the limes in the East, especially in the areas where the first blows from the Islamic forces fell. The concept of defence-in-depth by legions and auxiliaries-the legacy of Poidebard and his fellow airborne-archaeologists-has given way to a more fluid picture of mobile units and extensive use of mercenaries. The defence the East was operating on a very different footing at the time of the defeats and the aftermath of the brief but destructive Persian invasion on the system must be taken into account. The final section of the book contains contributions by scholars of Islamic art and literature. Terry Allen argues for a strong continuity of two distinguishing features of early Islamic style-the arabesque and the beveled style of architectural decoration go back to the early Byzantine artist's proclivity for abstraction of shape from texture. Jacob Lassner examines the concept of dawla (which can be loosely translated as 'revolution') in the Abbasid Caliphate. Stephen Humphreys concludes the volume with a major study of Qur'anic myth and structure in early Islamic historiography. The collection is finely produced with an extremely useful bibliography of primary sources (both classical and oriental). As a general work on Change and Continuity, the choice of subject matter and the approach adopted by most contributors are probably too specialized. However, it is a work which few specialists on Late Antiquity would choose to overlook. University of Warwick S A M U E L N. C. L I E U E. ZANGGER: The Geoarchaeology of the Argolid. (Deutsches Archaologisches Institut, Athen: Argolis II.) Pp. x + 150; 5 tables, 44 figs. Berlin: Gebr. Mann, 1993. Cased, DM 60. This monograph publishes the geoarchaeological results of the Argive Plain Project. The aim was to understand the impact on the area of various changes including human, climatic and tectonic. The settlement history of the plain appears to start in the late Middle Palaeolithic cave at Keflari. An overview of subsequent settlement patterns is provided including a map showing the distribution of Late Bronze Age sites. The perceived present day fertility of the plain is considered alongside ancient testimonia such as Homer and Aristotle. This is in contrast to J. Bintliffs (Natural Environment and Human Settlement in Prehistoric Greece [1977]) suggestion that 'until recently much of the plain was a swamp with no economic significance' (p. 6). Indeed the i depositional history' presented in this study departs from Bintliff's earlier work. The survey was conducted with both hand auger and power-drill holes. Some 73 cores and holes were taken along five main traverses. From these were extracted radiocarbon dates, as well as diagnostic pottery (p. 25). These samples included strata of Middle to Late Neolithic date at a depth of 5.2-5.8 m. The stratigraphic sequence can in fact be related to specific archaeological periods. A building associated with EH II pottery can be placed in the middle of the consolidated alluvium (p. 39). Elsewhere a Late Bronze Age building was found only 20 cm under the present surface (p. 40). The Pleistocene surface was observed to have still been in a state of formation in the Middle Neolithic period. Analysis of the Late Neolithic/Early Helladic alluvium found evidence for dense vegetation. Study was also made of the coastal changes in the region. At 18,000 B.P. the sea level was 100-120 m below the present, and a helpful map shows the line of the coast (p. 63, fig. 35). It subsequently rose reaching its highest level around 4,500 B.P. covering Neolithic sites. For example at Tiryns, which falls within the area of the survey, the project found that marine deposits occur some 1,250 m inland from the present beach (p. 31). The present shoreline was reached about 1100 B.C. More detailed study was conducted around Tiryns. Comments are made on what appears to have been a flash flood at the end of LH III B2, possibly linked to an earthquake. Parts of the lower town were buried by some 5 m of silt. The result seems to have been that a dam was constructed to protect Tiryns from a similar disaster, and the watercourse was diverted by the digging of a canal (p. 81, fig. 43). Observations are also made on the nature of the river Inakhos, which Pausanias (2.25.3) noted had springs 'though the water does not run far'. Sporadic floods do in fact take place on roughly a fifteen year cycle (p. 18). The chronological scheme for the survey follows that of Tj. van Andel and Curtis Runnels (Beyond the Acropolis: a Rural Greek Past [1987]). The results of the Argive Plain Project can ?

Nereids in Archaic and Classical Greek Art. Pp. xx+276; 156 plates. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1995. Cased, $52.50. Who and what are Nereids? Are they a homogeneous group? Do they have a recognizable presence in ancient Greek pictures? Are they a subdivision of the genus nymph? Are there any famous individual Nereids? Few conventional handbooks of mythology or iconography answer these questions directly: B.'s book begins by answering the easy ones: they are minor goddesses, associated with the sea, but usually thought to be distinct from nymphs. The most famous individual one is Thetis, the mother of Achilles. From here, the book asks rather wider questions about the function and importance of Nereids, who are present in literature as early as Homer and Hesiod and as late as Eustathius in the twelfth century A.D. They have a quiet but persistent presence in visual representations from the sixth century B.C. onwards: probably their most familiar visual manifestation is as intercolumnar figures on the Nereid Monument in the British Museum. B. wisely confines her discussion to Archaic and Classical Greek art, while signalling the possibility of future work on Etruscan and Roman representations. Nereids are one category in the very large class of supernumerary figures who appear in mythological scenes. They are usually represented simply as female figures, often carrying fish or small dolphins or identified by attributes peculiar to the context in which they appear, or by inscriptions. Some illustrations, such as those of the production of new armour for Achilles, rely on the viewer's knowledge of literary material for the identification of the women carrying the armour as Thetis' sisters. There are some illustrations which have a much more tenuous link with other visual representations and with literature, where identification is more difficult and the role of these female extras is much less evident. B. is concerned to establish a functional connection between the various apparently disparate scenes which will demonstrate that Nereids are to be differentiated from the anthropomorphic wallpaper or picture-frames common in late Archaic and Classical vase-painting. As B. says, the striking thing about Nereids is the wide variety of contexts in which they appear. These include identifiable myth-illustrations such as those related to Thetis and Achilles, the exposure of Andromeda, the Birth of Aphrodite, Herakles' wrestling matches with marine deities, and Theseus' Cretan adventure, but they also include gynaikeion scenes, non-narrative scenes of the marine thiasos, and the Nereid Monument-the tomb of a Lycian ruler-and a small number of fish-plates from the Black Sea region which show the abduction of Europa. The connection B. establishes, on the basis of exploration of the contexts, literary, visual, and those of cult practice, in which Nereids do, and more importantly do not, appear, is one suggested by her title. Nereids are escorts of a specialized kind: they do not appear with the dead on the battlefield, or at weddings, but they are present on the journey to Hades, and in scenes of wedding-preparation or, even more significantly, abduction. In the earliest representations they are, logically enough, the protectors of those foolhardy enough to travel by sea, a dangerous and often lethal process. By gradual extension, they begin to move outside their obvious sphere of influence to protect heroes in dangerous encounters with marine opponents, and eventually travellers on other journeys, largely metaphorical or psychological ones, whether from life to death, often thought of as a journey over water, or through the other states usually now characterized as liminal or transitional ones. Literary evidence, and in particular Euripides' Andromache 1254-68, supports the idea that Nereids can confer immortality, first on Peleus, joining Thetis in the house of her father Nereus, and then the human dead, including, eventually, the Lycian ruler commemorated by the Nereid Monument. B. makes two connections between Nereids and Dionysiac worship. The first argues, following Seaford, for a status similar to that of female followers of Artemis and of Dionysos, both cults which exclude men and classify the female participants as ' wild' women. The second associates the Nereids' immortalizing capacity (they are mentioned in the Orphic Hymns) with those of Dionysiac mystery cults-the marine thiasos as a parallel with the Dionysiac one.
