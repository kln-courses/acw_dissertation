<plain_text><page sequence="1">MISSAL EPISTLES FROM ROMANS XIII Rev. Joseph L. Lilly, C.M., S.T.D., S.S.L. The following passage is the epistle for the third Sunday after the Epiphany: 12:16,17 Be not wise in your own conceits. | To no man render evil for evil, but provide good things not only in the sight of God, but also in the sight of all men. 18 If it be possible, as far as in you lies, be at peace with 19 all men. Do not avenge yourselves, but give place to the wrath, for it is written. "Vengeance is mine : I will repay, says the Lord." 20 But "If thy enemy is hungry, give him food ; if he is thirsty, give him drink; For by so doing thou wilt heap coals of fire upon his head." 21 Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good. The foregoing passage follows immediately on the passage which is the epistle for the second Sunday after the Epiphany,1 and treats of the same subject, charity, more particularly of charity towards those who are not of the household of the faith. Be not wise in your own conceits. He is wise in his own con- ceits who thinks that he has nothing to learn from his fellow men or from God. He has, in his own estimation, ample knowledge to care for all his needs. Such a man is, in the words of St. Thomas, a victim of praesumptio sapientiae et prudentiae. Such were cer- tain pagans of St. Paul's day who while professing to be wise, have beconte fools (Rom. 1:22). Of this type of man, of whom unfortunately there are plenty in the world today as regards re- ligious and philosophical truth, Origen remarks : "He who wor- ships his own stupidity as wisdom, cannot know the true wisdom of God." To no man render evil for evil. The early Christians had much to suffer in the Jewish or pagan environment in which they lived. To the strong promptings of human nature to avenge itself of in- justice, our Lord and the Apostles both by word and example op- posed the sublime ideal of Christianity (Mt. 5:43-44; 1 Pet. * This was explained in the October, 1943 Qiuurterly, Vol. V, pp. 458-465.</page><page sequence="2">Missal Epistles from Romans 95 3 : 9 ; 1 Thess. 5 :15) to love and pray for those who persecute and calumniate us. Origen remarks that to render evil for evil may well be a greater sin than that of the one who first inflicts evil, for the victim of the ill treatment recognizes the evil he returns, but he who inflicted it may have had no consciousness of evil doing. Thus, no doubt, many a Jew who persecuted the Chris- tians did so out of a sense of duty, as was certainly the case with St. Paul, and many a pagan persecutor may well have regarded it as his patriotic duty to stamp out the Christian religion, which he in good faith considered anti-social and opposed to the best in- terests of the state. So it may be with many a present day oppo- nent of Christianity. But provide good things not only in the sight of God but also in the sight of all men.2 The good things are actions which are not only morally right and therefore good in the sight of God, but which at the same time will give no offence to men. Thus, at times, as St. Paul points out moçe than once (1 Cor. 8:9 if.; 10 :23 ff. Rom. 14 : 12 if.) , we may have to refrain from an action which, while it is morally good and permissible in itself, will be taken amiss, misunderstood or be offensive to others. St. Paul, in counseling the Romans to avoid anything that might bring them into disrepute in the eyes of the Jews or pagans, does not, of course, approve of any compromise in matters of faith or morals. And this he makes clear when he writes : If it be possible, as far as in you lies, be at peace with all men. St. Paul recognized that peace is not always possible between individuals, since it depends on both parties doing their duty. The same principle may be extended to nations, and therefore St. Paul was not an advocate of peace at any price. The in- dividual Christian must do all in his power for peace with his fellow men, but as St. John Chrysostom says : If you see the cause of religion suffering anywhere, do not set greater store by concord than truth, but make a noble stand even unto death. Even then be not at war in soul, but fight only against things. Be friendly in mind without giving up the truth at any time. Regrettable as are personal conflicts and horrible as is war between nations, there are w;orse evils, namely falsehood and in- justice. When, therefore, friendship can be preserved between individuals only by yielding to evil, peace and amity are to be un- hesitatingly sacrificed, and when war is the only means of se- 2 The Greek text here reads: Provide good things in the sight of all men.</page><page sequence="3">96 Missal Epistles from Romans curing justice, nations are not merely permitted but are obliged to have recourse to it, whenever the injustice is proportionately serious and there is well founded hope that war will suppress it. If this doctrine seems to be contradicted by the direction not to avenge oneself, we say that such advice is given to individuals and concerns personal wrongs, and not to governments which have the duty of protecting the interests of their subjects. Do not avenge yourselves, beloved, but give place to the wrath, for it is written. "V engeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord." Since St. Paul is asking what is very hard for human nature, he shows a great tenderness of feeling by addressing his readers as beloved. His advice is the surest way of preserving peace. The wrath here mentioned is the divine wrath, which is an anthropomorphic way of expressing God's punishment on sin. The citation from Deuteronomy clearly indicates the sense in which the wrath is to be understood. Then follows á citation from Proverbs, 25 : 21-22, which needs no comment. The meaning of heaping coals of fire on one's head is according to the commonly accepted view that by overwhelm- ing an enemy with kindness, one will make him burn with shame and thus bring him to better sentiments.3 Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good. He is overcome by evil who yields to the natural tendency to avenge himself and inflicts evil for evil. He who returns good for evil overcomes evil by good at least to the extent that the evil is not multiplied ; and such kind treatment may even expel evil from an enemy's heart. XIV The following passage is the epistle for the fourth Sunday after the Epiphany : 13:8 Owe no man anything except to love one another; for 9 he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the Law. For "Thou shalt not commit adultery; 8 Some think that forbearance heaps coals of fire on one's persecutor's head by increasing his punishment unless he repent, but as St. Augustine points out, this interpretation is out of harmony with the context, which urges to love. To give food and drink to one's persecutor with a view of adding to his punishment in the next life is certainly not in keeping with the fraternal charity St. Paul advocates.</page><page sequence="4">Missal Epistles prom Romans 97 Thou shalt not kill ; Thou shalt not steal ; Thou shalt not covet" ; 10 and if there is any other commandment, it is summed up in this saying : "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thy self." St. Paul interrupts his treatment of charity, excerpts from which form the epistles for the second and third Sundays after the Epiphany, to interpose a paragraph on obedience to the civil authorities. He concludes the paragraph by stating the prin- ciple of justice: to render to every man his due, tribute, taxes, reverence and honor to whom they may be owing. That suggests the idea of the debt which can never fully be discharged - love. St. Thomas in his commentary on the passage writes : Above the Apostle showed how the faithful ought -to observe justice towards superiors ; here he shows what they should render to all men. And concerning this he first sets down his thesis, and secondly he gives the reason. It was said, "Give to all their due," not partially but entirely. And to this he adds, saying, "Owe no man anything," as if he should say, "so pay all debts to all men that nothing remains to be paid." And this for two reasons, first, because in delaying^ pay- ment sin is committed, since one unjustly holds what belongs to another. Therefore Leviticus 19 says : "The wages of him that hath been hired by thee shall not abide with thee until the morning." The same holds for debts due to others. Secondly, because as long as a man is in debt, he is in a certain way a slave and is bound to him whom he owes. "The borrower is servant to him that lendeth," says Proverbs. But there are certain debts from which a man can never free himself. This happens in two ways. In one way because of the excellence of the benefit for which no equivalent return can be made. As the Philosopher says of the honor which is due to God or to par- ents, according to the Psalmist, "What shall I render to the Lord for all that He has rendered to me." In another way because of the cause of the debt which abides always, or because of this that what is ren- dered is never exhausted but in the rendering increases. And for these reasons the debt of love is so paid that it always remains due. First, because we owe love to the neighbor for God's sake to whom we can never make sufficient return Secondly because the cause of love always remains which is the similitude of nature and of grace. "Every beast loveth its like ; so also every man him that is nearest to him." Thirdly because love in loving fails not. He who loves his fellow man fulfills the Law for as long as love abides one cannot transgress the commandments of God relative to the neighbor. St. Paul here cites some of the precepts of the decalogue as examples. The differing order of the command-</page><page sequence="5">98 Missal Epistles from Romans ments is due to the variation in certain ancient manuscripts, and not, as some have suggested, to the fact that adultery was very- prevalent among the Romans, and St. Paul therefore wished to emphasize its prohibition by putting it first among the command- ments he quotes. The Hebrew and Latin texts of Ex. 20:13 ff. and Deut. 5:17 if., which contain the commandments, have them in the order familiar to us from the catechism, but certain an- cient Greek manuscripts, Philo and Clement of Alexandria, give them in the order which St. Paul has here. Wonderment is sometimes expressed why there is no mention of the love of God by St. Paul in this context, in accord with the statement of our Lord on the two commandments - love of God and love of the neighbor - on which the whole law depends (Mt. 22 : 34-40). St. Augustine answers that genuine love of the neighbor is impossible without the love of God. The one sup- poses the other; they are inseparable. Ex una eademque cari- tate Deum proximumque diligimus, sed Deus propter Deum, nos autem et proximum propter Deum . Or in the scholastic language of St. Thomas : "In the love of the neighbor the love of God is included as a cause is contained in its effect, and in the love of God the love of the neighbor is included as the effect is contained in its cause." St. Thomas also remarks that the negative precepts are given in proof of St. Paul's thesis because refraining from evil is a more obvious proof of love than the placing of benevolent acts, and because the negative precepts are more universal, binding always and in regard to all persons - semper et pro semper as the theologians say - whereas the positive precepts bind only on occa- sion. The concluding verse of this excerpts is the conclusion of a syllogism of which the first verse is the major, the second the minor and the third the conclusion, all which St. Thomas ex- presses as follows : Major: He who loves the neighbor does him no evil. Minor : But every precept of the decalogue is directed to this that one abstain from evil. Conclusion : Therefore he who loves the neighbor has fulfilled the law.
