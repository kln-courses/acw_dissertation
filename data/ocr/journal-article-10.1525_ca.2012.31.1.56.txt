READY Zeus, Ancient Near Eastern Notions of Divine Incomparability, and Similes in the Homeric Epics This article explores the significance of the following fact: in neither the Iliad nor the Odyssey does one find a simile about Zeus. I argue that just as ancient Near Eastern texts characterize a god by declaring it impossible to fashion a comparison about him or her, so the Homeric epics characterize Zeus by avoiding statements in the shape “Zeus (is) like X.” In the beginning of the so-called “Hymn to Zeus” in Aeschylus’sAgamemnon, the Chorus claims that Zeus is incomparable: Ζεupsilongraveς  στις ποτ   στ ν, ε  τ δ  αupsilonlenis- τ ι φ λον κεκλημ νωι, τοupsilonperispomeneτ  νιν προσενν πω  οupsilonlenisκ  χω προσεικ!σαι π!ντ   πισταθμ#μενος πλ$ν Δι ς, ε  τ&amp; μ!ταν 'π&amp; φροντ δος (χθος χρ$ βαλε*ν  τητupsilonacuteμως  Ag. 160–66 Eduard Fraenkel translates: “Zeus, whoever he be—if to be called and invoked by this name is pleasing to him, even thus do I address him. I have nothing whereto to liken him, weighing all in the balance, nothing save Zeus if there is need to cast the burden of vain thought from the care-laden mind in real truth” (1950a: 101). Zeus cannot be compared to anything else, only himself 1.

In Deutero-Isaiah, for instance, we find, “To whom then will you liken God. . .?” (40:18).4 The implied answer is, “No one.” Having adduced this apt parallel, West ventures the following conclusion: “Aeschylus is voic- ing sentiments which were new to Greece but not so new in the East” (1997: 560). But the situation is not as straightforward as that assertion might lead one to believe. Although the Iliad and Odyssey often differ in their representations of the divine 5, they share the following striking, and hitherto unnoticed, feature: both avoid statements in the form “Zeus (is) like X.” This article interprets this absence in light of the sort of statements West turns to when discussing the passage from Agamemnon: the ancient Near Eastern declarations about the inability to fashion a comparison for a god. We need not wait, then, for Aeschylus’s Zeus before we begin discussing together the ancient Near Eastern motif and Greek poetry 6. To find this intersection is unsurprising 7. Scholars—especially prominent and 2. Fraenkel points to the Pilgrim’s description of the Christian God as the sun: “because the sun that warmed and lighted you / with heat and light is poised so perfectly / that all comparisons fall short of it” (Dante Paradise 15.76–78; trans. Musa 1996a: 147; see Musa 1996b: ad 15.73–78 for further explication). 3. On Zeus as the king of the gods, see Cook 1914: 1, Nilsson 1967: 394, Burkert 1985: 126, and Dowden 2006: 30. 4. All translations of passages from the Hebrew Bible come from the New Revised Standard Version. 5. See Cook 1995: 36–45 and Kearns 2004: 67–69. Allan 2006 challenges this idea: “the two poems share the same moral and theological universe” (1); cf. Marks 2008: 60–61. 6. For his part, Xenophanes may precede Aeschylus in asserting divine incomparability when he proposes the existence of a single all-powerful god: ε-ς θε ς,  ν τε θεο*σι κα. 'νθρ#ποισι μ γιστος, οupsilonlenisacuteτι δ μας θνητο*σιν 1μο ιος οupsilonlenisδ2 ν ημα. fr. 23 D-K There is one god, greatest among gods and men, in no way similar in form or thought to mortals. Xenophanes’s primary aim is to reject the idea of anthropomorphism (cf. frs. 14–16 D-K), but we note that he does so with the distinctly Homeric language of comparison. After Telemachos bathes and dresses, “he came out from the bath looking like an immortal (δ μας 'θαν!τοισιν 1μο*ος)” (Od. 3.468 = 23.163; cf. Il. 8.14). Xenophanes’s economical argument is two-pronged. He dismisses not only the idea that the one god should be pictured in human terms but also the notion that he can be compared to men. The implication may be that the divinity is in fact incomparable. (Except where noted, all translations from the Odyssey are those of Lattimore 1965. I have used the Oxford Classical Texts for quotations from the Odyssey.) 7.

Inspired above all by that latter project, we can direct an investigation of the similar strategies regarding comparison that are used to portray the different gods toward deepening our understanding of the Homeric Zeus 10. My argument unfolds in three parts, the first two preparing the way for the third. Part I contends that the lack of statements in the shape “Zeus (is) like X” in the Homeric epics is just as deliberate an absence as other well-known omissions, such as the avoidance in the Odyssey of events recounted in the Iliad 11. Part II explores the nature and diffusion of assertions of divine incomparability in the with Northwest Semitic peoples, especially Canaanites from Syro-Palestine, from the Late Bronze Age onward” (4; cf. 24). On the need to avoid unidirectional models of diffusion and “influence,” see Finkelberg 2006; cf. Dougherty and Kurke 2003: 2–6, Bremmer 2008: 16–17, Lo ́pez-Ruiz 2010: 21–22 and 38–43, and Louden 2011: 11–12 and 320. 8. It is easiest to look for parallels between the Homeric epics and ancient Near Eastern epics. See, e.g., Haubold 2002 and Bachvarova 2005 and 2008b; on Gilgamesh and the Iliad, see, e.g., West 1997: 336–47, Abusch 2001: 2–3, and Bryce 2008: 87–88; on Gilgamesh and the Odyssey, see, e.g., West 1997: 402–17, Strasburger 1998, Burgess 1999, Abusch 2001: 3–5, Bakker 2001, and Louden 2011: 183–96 and 205–207. Yet critics have also demonstrated the great value of non-epic ancient Near Eastern sources as comparanda for the Homeric poems. West 1997: 348–400 and 417–36 exemplifies this method with his numerous citations from prayers, hymns, laments, ritual texts, incantations, and the Hebrew Bible (which contains elements associated with epic or even epic material but is not itself epic [see Niditch 2005 and 2010 and Louden 2011: 8–9]). See also, e.g, Griffin 1980: passim (in the footnotes), Rollinger 1996, Launderville 2003, Louden 2006: Chapters 5 and 6 and 2011: passim, Haas 2007, Bryce 2008: 87, Griffith 2008: Chapters 3 and 5, and Bachvarova 2008b: 94–95 and 103–104 and 2009: 26–29. Nor need we restrict ourselves to literary artifacts: Cook 2004 suggests that descriptions of Assyrian palace architecture influenced the rendering of Alkinoos’s palace in the Odyssey; see also Marinatos’s analysis of Phoenician bowls in her discussion of Odysseus’s travels (2001). The same breadth appears in scholarship concerned with the more specific task of comparing depictions of the gods in the Homeric poems and ancient Near Eastern literatures. For comparisons on this topic between the Homeric poems and ancient Near Eastern epics, see, e.g., Mondi 1990: 164–65 and 181, Burkert 1992: 88–106, Morris 1997: 616–17, Louden 2006: 245–74 and 2011: 35, 42–43, 67, 128–34, 195–96, 236, and 294–98, and Pulleyn 2006: 58–60. For comparisons of the Homeric poems with non-epic literary sources, see, e.g., Rollinger 1996: 172–77 and 194–201, West 1997: 109–10, 112–16, and 353–56, Kitts 2005: 189–97 and 200–205, Pulleyn 2006: 54–57, and Louden 2011: 36, 38–39, 42–43, 47, 52, 171–72, 175, 224, 237, 242, 251–55, 290, 298–99, and 307–309. As to use of the material record, I cite Griffith 2005 who takes kuaneos to mean “blue” and links the kuaneos hair of the Homeric gods to Egyptian representations of divinities. Non-epic literary sources provide much of the data for my presentation below. 9. See, e.g., Mondi 1990: 173, West 1997: 114–16, 222, 373, 393–94, and 433–34, Brown 2000: 54–80 and 143–47, Louden 2006: 219, 220–21, 225–26, and 233–34 and 2011: 17–29, 126–27, 236, 289, and 305, and Pulleyn 2006: 49–61. 10. My study also interacts, then, albeit to a lesser extent, with explorations of the parallels between similes in these traditions: see Damon 1961: 264–71, Puhvel 1991: 21–29, Rollinger 1996: 166–71, West 1997: 217–19 and 242–52, and Bachvarova 2010: 76–77. Note as well the studies that find in ancient Near Eastern practices the rationale for the action described in the vehicle portion (see n.12 below) of a Homeric simile: according to Alden 2005, for instance, the stealing of the lion cubs in the simile at Il. 18.318–23 stems from knowledge of Near Eastern lion hunts. 11. On Monro’s Law and “deliberate avoidance,” see Nagy 1999: 20–21 (quotation on 21); cf. Slatkin 1991: 15 (“deliberate narrative strategy”) and Gumpert 2001: 11 (“at every moment cognizant”). </page> <page sequence="4"> ready: Zeus, Divine Incomparability, and Similes 59 ancient Near East. Part III argues that those statements are to be set alongside the feature of the Homeric epics’ construction of their Zeus presented in Part I. In particular, whereas ancient Near Eastern texts assert the impossibility of comparing so as to characterize the referent as, for instance, distinct or perfect, the Homeric poems offer their own version of this equation. They do not compare Zeus to anything so as to characterize the chief god in three ways: he is himself incomparable; he remains in an important sense unknowable; and he maintains an authorial stance. I. ZEUS’S DISTANCE FROM SIMILE Nowhere in the Iliad or Odyssey do we find a statement to the effect of “Zeus (is) like X”; that is, Zeus never functions as the tenor of a simile 12. Four phenomena accentuate Zeus’s distance from simile and suggest that it cannot be attributed to the fact that only two Homeric poems are extant. First, the application of a simile to a god as he or she travels from one place to another is so common that William Scott devotes a section to it in his study of similes found in particular type scenes (1974: 15–20). Zeus does go on journeys from, for example, Olympos to Ida (Il. 8.41–52) and back again (Il. 8.438–43), but there are no similes at those moments (cf. Il. 11.182–84). Just so, in the Hesiodic Scutum, no simile describes Zeus’s heading from Olympos to sleep with Alkmene (30–35),13 and, in the Hesiodic fragments, Zeus’s coming down from Olympos to punish Salmoneus and his people does not generate a simile (fr. 30.15–16 M-W) 14. In short, even when Zeus performs an action that could very well receive a simile, no simile appears. In such a context, the omission becomes all the more noticeable. Second, two prominent attributes of Zeus, his eagle and his thunder, can be compared to an unlike term.15 When Priam prays for a good omen before heading out to ransom Hektor, Zeus sends an eagle whose wingspan the narrator likens to 12. A note on terminology: (1) A simile is composed of a tenor and an unlike vehicle. In the example, “Diomedes is like a lion,” “Diomedes” is the tenor, and “lion” is the vehicle. (I. A. Richards coined the terms [1936: 96–101].) I speak of an “unlike vehicle” because not all statements in the shape “A (is) like B” are to be classed as similes; only those with unlike vehicles (the “B”) count: see below on literal similarity statements. (2) I also refer to the “vehicle portion” and the “resumptive clause” of a simile, what Fra ̈nkel termed the Wie-stu ̈ck and the So-stu ̈ck, respectively (1921: 4). 13. Note the juxtaposition of Zeus’s actions, on the one hand, with Amphitryon’s return home and subsequent love making with his wife, on the other: Amphitryon’s actions warrant a simile (Sc. 42–45) (but see the critical apparatus for problems with the simile’s placement). 14. Cf. Hes. Th. 56–57 and 855. I am not convinced by Rood’s proposal that in the simile at Th. 861–67 the technicians who melt the metals stand for Zeus (2007). That Hesiod speaks of “young men” is significant. For both Hesiod and Homer conscientiously watch over the number, that is, whether they are singular or plural, of their tenor(s) and vehicle(s) (cf. Ready 2011: 245–46). Most similes match a singular tenor to a singular vehicle and a plural tenor to a plural vehicle: see, e.g., Il. 4.433–36, 11.113–21 (wherein note especially the tis at 120), 17.389–95, 21.12–15, Od. 22.302–307, and Th. 594–602. This rule always holds for craft or technology similes: see the sensible shift from singular to plural over the course of the vehicle portion of the simile at Od. 9.383–88. It would be highly unusual for the plural technicians to represent the singular Zeus. 15.

Hearing Zeus’s thunder and believing that it bodes well for them 16, the Trojans redouble their attack on the Achaian wall: Τρ ες δ  4ς  πupsilonacuteθοντο Δι&amp;ς κτupsilonacuteπον α γι χοιο, μ5λλον  π  Α6 ργε οισι θ ρον, μν8σαντο δ2 χ!ρμης. ο9 δ  :ς τε μ γα κupsilonperispomeneμα θαλ!σσης εupsilonlenisρυπ ροιο νη&amp;ς upsilonasperπ2ρ το χων καταβ8σεται, 1ππ τ   πε γη= &gt;ς 'ν μου  ? γ!ρ τε μ!λιστ! γε κupsilonacuteματ  @φ λλει  Aς Τρ ες μεγ!λη=  αχB= κατC τε*χος  βαινον. Il. 15.379–8417 But the Trojans, hearing the thunderstroke of Zeus of the aegis, remembered even more their warcraft, and sprang on the Argives. They, as when the big waves on the sea wide-wandering wash across the walls of a ship underneath the leaning force of the wind, which particularly piles up the big waves, so the Trojans with huge clamour went over the rampart 18. The Trojans are like waves; Zeus’s thunder is like the wind that stirs up the waves. That Zeus’s eagle and thunder serve as tenors in similes contrasts with and underscores the fact that Zeus himself does not 19. Third, consider the distribution of similes among the individual divinities referred to in the Homeric poems 20. Table A shows which gods serve as a tenor in a simile. List B shows which gods do not appear as a tenor in a simile. 16. See Janko 1992: ad loc. 17. I have used the Oxford Classical Texts for quotations from the Iliad. 18. All translations from the Iliad are those of Lattimore 1951. 19. Compare how Moschus handles comparative statements in his Europa. Zeus does not function as a tenor, but when Zeus takes the form of a bull, the animal becomes the tenor of several comparisons: see the four literal similarity claims (defined below) at 80–83 (this is not an average bull); the similes at 87–88 (his horns are like the moon), 97–98 (his lowing reminds one of a Phrygian flute), 113 (he speeds over the water like a dolphin), and 145 (he just may fly up like a bird); and the metaphor at 143 (his hooves are oars). That is, figures are used of the bull into which Zeus changes himself (80–83, 87–88, 97–98, and 143) and of Zeus’s actions as a bull (113 and 145) but not of Zeus in propria persona. 20. I have been as liberal as possible in gathering this data: hence I include personifications (see Stafford 2007) and nymphs (see Larson 2001: 20–28). Still, I exclude from consideration the Nereids (see Il. 18.39–49), Thetis excepted, the other specific groups of gods when they are referred to as collectives (i.e., the Fates, Graces [among whom Pasithea is referred to at Il. 14.269], Horae [see, e.g., Il. 5.749–51], Litai, Muses, Sirens [for their divine status, see Doherty 1995: 83 with n.15], and Titans [referred to as a collective once at Il. 14.279]), and the other rivers beside the Skamandros (Acheloios, Asopos, Simoeis, Styx, etc), this last omission being an admittedly arbitrary one (esp. given Il. 20.4–9).

Far more of the divinities in Table A can be classified among “les Grands 24,” those gods with a sustained or recurring presence in one or both of the epics’ main stories 25. This group comprises Zeus’s peers: after all, Zeus is their leader and has just as significant a role (if not a more significant role) in the main story of each epic 26. Remarkably, each of those gods serves as a tenor in at least one simile, whereas Zeus never does. This allotment of similes points up Zeus’s distance from simile.

On Zeus’s role in theOdyssey, see below. According to Dowden’s calculations of the number of times each Olympian deity is mentioned in each epic (2007: 45), Zeus is mentioned 568 times in the Iliad and 252 times in the Odyssey. The closest runner-up is Athene: she is mentioned 163 times in the Iliad and 161 times in the Odyssey. That Zeus is referred to far and away the most neatly indexes his importance. </page> <page sequence="8"> ready: Zeus, Divine Incomparability, and Similes 63 himwith a rock as they fight in front of the Achaian ships (Il. 14.411–13).

A bT scholion detects the points of correspondence: “Aias is Zeus, the stone is the thunderbolt; Hektor is compared to a great oak falling from the roots” (Erbse 1973: ad 14.414–5). The focus is not on Aias as Zeus, but the equation is implied. Although such figurative assertions are possible, we do not find similes based on the template “Zeus (is) like X.” Note that this restriction does not apply across the board to the gods in Table C: most of them appear in Table A (Gods who serve as a tenor in a simile). When it comes to the chief god, the Homeric poems offer an asymmetrical relation of resemblance: X can be like Zeus, but Zeus cannot be like X. The possibility of statements modeled on the former template draws attention to the omission of statements modeled on the latter template. The same rule (i.e., X can be like Zeus, but Zeus cannot be like X) holds for another type of comparative statement. We tend to label as similes all statements in the form “A (is) like B,” but some statements in that form are actually “literal similarity statements.” In a literal similarity statement, such as “Olives are like cherries,” the most important defining features of the two compared terms are in each case similar and are the bases of the comparison. A speaker would most likely say, “Olives are like cherries,” to suggest not that they both make good projectiles but that they are both small, round fruits with pits 27. The following Homeric assertions involving Zeus are closer to literal 27. The example comes from Chiappe, Kennedy, and Smykowski 2003: 86. Ortony provides the following definition: “I shall refer to similarity statements in which the matching attributes are of comparably high salience . . . as literal similarity statements. . . . This seems to accord with common sense. It could be taken as axiomatic that if two things share some characteristics that are important to both, then those things will be perceived as literally similar” (1979: 164, emphasis in original). He gives the example “Billboards are like placards” at 164. See also 171 and 172, as well as 175–76 on literal analogies, for further explication. Gentner contrasts literal similarity statements with other types of comparisons (1989: 206–207). To be sure, differentiating between types of comparative statements is not easy (see Miller 1993: 373). </page> <page sequence="9"> 64 classical antiquity Volume 31/No. 1 /April 2012 similarity statements than they are to similes:28 Agamemnon is in “eyes and head like Zeus who delights in thunder” (Lμματα κα. κεφαλ$ν Gκελος Δι. τερπικεραupsilonacuteνωM) (Il. 2.478).29 Odysseus and Hektor share a figurative epithet: “equal of Zeus in counsel” (Δι. μBτιν 'τ!λαντος) (Il. 2.169, 407, 636, 10.137 and 7.47, 11.200, respectively).30 Whereas statements based on the template “X is literally similar to Zeus” occur in Homeric poetry, statements in the shape “Zeus is literally similar to X” do not 31. This imbalance is especially intriguing given that literal similarity statements, unlike similes, are reversible 32. It makes just as much sense to say, “Cherries are like olives,” as it does to say, “Olives are like cherries.” Related to our fourth trend, but nonetheless worthy of separate consideration, are similes in which Zeus appears in the vehicle portion but is not a (or the) vehicle that corresponds to a (or the) tenor 33. For instance, four Achaian leaders take a stand against the advancing Trojans: 'λλ   μενον νεφ λη=σιν  οικ τες, Nς τε Κρον ων νηνεμ ης  στησεν  π  'κροπ λοισιν Lρεσσιν 'τρ μας, Lφρ  εupsilonasperacuteδη=σι μ νος Βορ αο κα.

So the Danaans stood steady against the Trojans, nor gave way. 28. On other comparisons akin to literal similarity statements in the Homeric poems, see Ready 2011: 22–25. 29. The most recent compiler of all the comparative statements in the Homeric epics (Larsen 2007) leaves this image out. Its absence from her lists signals its difference. 30. The specification “in counsel” differentiates this comparative statement from the common figurative epithet “like Ares” ('τ!λαντος ΑS ρηϊ) (e.g., Il. 2.627 and 5.576), which I categorize as a simile, not a literal similarity statement. 31. Note that no god serves as the tenor in a statement of this kind. 32. “[P]eople prefer them [literal similarity statements] in a particular order. . . . However, they do generally tolerate being expressed in a bidirectional manner” (Chiappe, Kennedy, and Smykowski 2003: 86); cf. Stern 2000: 152. Reversibility is a controversial topic in the study of comparisons (see Campbell and Katz 2006). 33. Compare the simile likening Nausikaa to Artemis in which “the heart of Leto is gladdened” as she sees her daughter with her nymph companions (Od. 6.102–109). Leto does not correspond to a tenor in the narrative context. </page> <page sequence="10"> ready: Zeus, Divine Incomparability, and Similes 65 This sort of weather imagery in a simile is typical: an event in nature attributed to Zeus is compared to some action on the battlefield 34. Whereas what happens on the battlefield can be said to resemble something that Zeus has a hand in, Zeus is not likened to anything else. Once again the former fact makes the latter fact stand out yet more. By way of concluding this section, I observe that Zeus never speaks a simile. Artemis, Hera, Hephaistos, and Hermes do not utter similes either, but, as Table D shows, a sufficient number of other gods who have significant roles in the poems do to make Zeus’s absence from that group noteworthy.

In sum, the absence of statements in the shape “Zeus (is) like X” emerges not as an incidental aberration but as a concerted effort to avoid comparisons about the god. I propose that the Homeric Zeus’s distance from simile be aligned with declarations of incomparability from the ancient Near East. II.

Such a contrastive approach, however, obscures a more significant point of contact between the portrayal of the Homeric Zeus and the depictions of gods in the ancient Near East. Another look at texts of and reflective of the religious traditions of the ancient Near East turns up the prominent motif of divine incomparability. The idea that a god, including a chief god, cannot be compared to anything else appears in a variety of guises, and I provide several examples in this Part. In turn, as we shall see in Part III, the purpose of these claims mirrors the purpose behind the Homeric poems’ not comparing Zeus to something else. Let me pause momentarily to offer two comments on the nature of the material presented below. First, in the bulk of what follows, I look at passages that assert the incomparability of a god in relation to other gods. In a coda, I look at the difficulties that can arise when it comes to comparing a god to anything at all. Second, incomparability can be posited in different ways. The argument for connecting the absence of similes applied to the Homeric Zeus with the incomparability of ancient Near Eastern divinities gains some traction if it focuses on statements of incomparability in the ancient Near Eastern materials that use comparative words also found in similes. That is, we are on the lookout primarily for statements, such as “Who is like X?,” wherein the word expressing the idea of “like” also comes up in similes. Because it provides numerous examples that fulfill this criterion, I first turn to evidence from the Hebrew Bible. Scholarship on the ancient Near East, however, does not limit the notion of incomparability to statements involving a comparative word denoting “like.” For instance, David Aaron quotes as an assertion of incomparability the following addressed to Ishtar: “who is it that could rival her grandeur?” (2002: 34n.15).52 I adhere to this practice in my discussion of Mesopotamian traditions in which I present these sorts of statements along with declarations of incomparability that use words meaning “like” that also appear in similes. Finally, in the coda to my survey, I employ the term “incomparability” with reference to the notion that a comparison in the form “A (is) like B” fails. Onward, then, to examples of the motif itself. In the Hebrew Bible, the verb da ̄ma ̄h “to be like” and the proclitic particle ke “like” introduce similes as well as declarations of Yahweh’s incomparability vis 5-a`-vis other gods 3. After Yahweh parts the Red Sea, it is proclaimed, “Who is like you, O Lord, among the gods?” (Exodus 15:11). In 1 Kings 8:23, Solomon declares, “O Lord, God of Israel, there is no God like you in heaven above or 52. Cf. Labuschagne’s inclusion of statements about inequality (1966: e.g., 34 and 40) and invincibility (e.g., 38 and 50–51) in his discussions of incomparability. 53. The following paragraph is indebted to Ringgren 1974: 282–84, Preuss 1978: esp. 255–57, and Seybold 1995: esp. 4–5. Other assemblages of relevant passages can be found in Brueggemann 1997: 139–44 and Human 2004: 53. </page> <page sequence="13"> 68 classical antiquity Volume 31/No. 1 /April 2012 on earth beneath.” One psalmist asks, “You who have done great things, / O God, who is like you?” (Psalm 71:19), and another queries, “For who in the skies can be compared to the Lord? / Who among the heavenly beings is like the Lord” (89:6–7). In Deutero-Isaiah, the prophet asks rhetorically, “To whom then will you liken God, or what likeness compare with him?” (40:18),54 and then reprises the question a moment later: “To whom then will you compare me, or who is my equal? says the Holy One” (40:25) (see also 44:7). Micah as well asks, “Who is a God like you, pardoning iniquity / and passing over the transgression / of the remnant of your possession?” (Micah 7:18). So prominent is this motif that C. J. Labuschagne devoted an entire monograph to Yahweh’s incomparability as a divinity (1966: esp. 66–89).55 As Labuschagne begins to document, the motif appears in other ancient Near Eastern cultures. He helpfully observes that polytheistic religions do not limit such assertions to one god: “It was typical of the polytheistic world that expressions of incomparability were used not in respect of one god only, but of several gods irrespective of their position in the pantheon” (1966: 33; cf. 130). Nonetheless, certain patterns emerge. For instance, in Egypt “it was the sun-god who was regarded as the incomparable one par excellence,” and “in Mesopotamia the attribute was originally bestowed on a limited number of gods, especially those who conquered the forces of darkness” (61). I provide below two examples from Egypt and then turn to instances in Mesopotamian texts of the motif’s application to a dominant god as well as to lesser divinities. 54. Isaiah’s second question (although for Goldingay and Payne, “The second question repeats the first in different words . . . rather than asks a different one” [2006: 111]) contends that the idols of other gods are not comparable to Yahweh and thus partakes in an argument found elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible (cf. Jeremiah 10:1–9): “The primary object is to compare Yahweh with the idols in order to prove that He is not on a level with ‘gods’ of wood, silver and gold, but a supreme, incomparably unique Being” (Labuschagne 1966: 74). In arguing that there was an “acceptable image of Yahweh” (1996: 102), Schmidt suggests that the point of Isaiah’s and Jeremiah’s polemics is to give “YHWH’s incomparability . . . further elaboration. . . . [B]oth his ‘legitimate’ form and its accompanying rituals of animation were kept distinct from, and viewed as superior to, those of other cults” (91). See also Weeks 2007: 18–19. Naturally enough (see Baltzer 2001: 73, ad 18), Isaiah’s statement brings to mind the Decalogue’s second commandment, which prohibits the fashioning of idols (see Exodus 20:4 and 34:17 and Deuteronomy 5:8). Labuschagne views the ban in the context of incomparability: “Therefore the prohibition in the second commandment can only be understood against the background of Yahweh’s incomparability: no image of Him, or else He might find Himself standing in the company of idols; no image and no worship of the idols, or else He, the incomparable, would have to compete on a level with the idols for his rights so far as Israel was concerned” (1966: 141). The reasoning behind Israelite aniconism when it comes to Yahweh has, however, been sought elsewhere. See, e.g., Mettinger 1995: 35–36 and 193–96, Lewis 1998: 51 (cf. Sarna 1991: 110, ad 4; Tigay 1996: 48, ad 15–18; and Ko ̈ckert 2008: 26–32), Meyers 2005: 171, and Weeks 2007: 13. This question is related to broader debates on both the dating of the emergence and the very nature of Israelite aniconism: see Edelman 1996b, Schmidt 1996, Lewis 1998, Meyers 2005: 170–71, Mettinger 2006, Uehlinger 2006, Ko ̈ckert 2008: 22 and 32–34, and the essays collected in van der Toorn 1997.

In a poem that tells of Ninurta’s (the god of Nippur) exploits, the boatmen proclaim, “Ninurta, Lord, Son of Enlil, Hero, who is like you (a-ba za-a-gin7)? 60” A hymn to Haia declares, “Who among the gods is fitted like you (a-ba za 6-a-gin7) for the holy divine powers? 1” If we allow that statements of incomparability can be in reference to one attribute or ability as opposed to general pronouncements, we find that such specifica- tions can be added to the phrase used of Ninurta and Haia. For instance, the following declaration comes from an ersˇemma to the storm god Ishkur: “Who is like you (a-ba za 6-e-gin7) when approaching? 2” A hymn to Inanna offers, “Which god is like you (a-ba za-gin7) in gathering together 63. . . .” The verb sa2 “to equal, compare, rival” does not introduce similes but does appear in state- ments of incomparability. A balag to Ninurta asks, “Who can compare to you?” (a-ba e-da-sa ́) 64. A hymn to Numusˇda proclaims, “who can rival you?” (a-ba e-da-sa2-am3).65 The particle kı ̄(ma) “like,” the prepositionmala “as big/many as,” and the verb masˇa ̄lu “to equal, to be similar to” regularly introduce similes in Akkadian texts and also arise in declarations of incomparability 66.

A notional answer could take the form of a literal assertion of likeness: “A is literally like/equal to/a rival to, etc., B 76.” In short, whereas figurative comparisons abound when it comes to these gods, literal similarity statements are repeatedly depicted as impossible.77 There were, of course, other ways to declare a god incomparable. Instead of denying outright the possibility of crafting an assertion of likeness, other passages deploy comparisons that fail for some reason. For instance, the following description of Re appears in a hymn on a stele set up by two brothers, Suti and Hor, who lived during the rule of Amenhotep III (first half of the fourteenth century bc): Your rays are in the face, but they cannot be known. White gold is not the equal of your brilliance. You are a Ptah, you cast your body from gold, One who gives birth, But is not born, Unique one, who traverses endless time, Who is on the ways with millions under his command. The brilliance of heaven is like your brilliance, Your colour shines more brilliantly than its skin 78. Both the second quoted verse and the final couplet assert the inadequacy of comparison when it comes to Re. Neither comparison to white gold nor to the heavens captures the “brilliance” of the tenor. In these ways, the above traditions routinely claim that a god, including a chief god, cannot be the object of a comparison. To what ends? Scholarship has focused on Yahweh. Labuschagne finds that these statements can demonstrate Yahweh’s uniqueness (1966: 14; cf. 116–17), especially as the only god who delivered his people from slavery (e.g., 91–92, 103, and 134). Fritz Stolz observes that such statements can suggest the unequalled power and awesomeness of Yahweh or mark his transcendence (1977: 23). In Dale Patrick’s words, they can reveal the god “to possess all the attributes of deity to a superlative degree and, by implication, to be without defect or limitation” (1981: 50). Werner Schmidt notes that declarations of incomparability can imply a corresponding “exclusivity”: 76. Note as well that if in a setting in which there are numerous similes of the sort, “X is figuratively like Y,” it is asked, “Is there anyone like X?,” the implication is that if one can reply in the affirmative, one can craft a statement in the form “Y is like X” or “X is like Y.” The answer is reversible; so too must the original question be theoretically reversible, and reversibility is a key component of a literal similarity statement. 77. The language discussed above is also used to designate mortal kings as incomparable.

So, for example, Horst Preuss suggests that, in the context of a prayer, an assertion of incomparability portrays the divinity as the most capable helper one could have (1971: 32).81 Zeus’s absence as a tenor in similes should be connectedwith this ancient Near Eastern motif. First, that ancient Near Eastern texts regularly reject the possibility of fashioning or the validity of comparisons about a divinity makes the argument offered in Part I—that the Homeric epics purposefully avoid comparisons for Zeus—yet more attractive. Second, the matter I turn to in Part III: the lack of statements in the shape “Zeus (is) like X,” can now more easily be understood to contribute to the chief god’s characterization. III. THE ABSENCE OF SIMILES APPLIED TO ZEUS AND HIS CHARACTERIZATION IN THE HOMERIC EPICS Assertions in ancient Near Eastern texts that a god cannot be compared to another entity are to be juxtaposed with the fact that the Homeric Zeus is not compared to another entity. In ancient Near Eastern traditions, declarations that a god cannot be the object of comparison contribute to that god’s characterization. In the Homeric version of this equation, that Zeus is never the object of comparison characterizes the Homeric god.82 Just as an explicit denial that the grounds for comparison exist aids in characterization, so too does an absence of comparison. This section explores the latter of those two propositions 83. An initial suggestion requires only a little space. The Homeric poems may be offering the same argument as the ancient Near Eastern texts that use the motif of incomparability to declare, for example, a god’s supremacy. By not comparing Zeus to anything the epics may be suggesting that he cannot be compared to 79. For other, similar comments on Yahweh’s incomparability, see Brueggemann 2001: 242; Hossfeld 2005: 408, ad 7; Meyers 2005: 120; and Smith 2008: 180. 80. E.g.: “With regard to Scripture’s ‘insistence’ that God is ‘the incomparable one’ there remain many questions as to whether that incomparability makes God a species different from other beings, or whether it is a distinctiveness similar to that achieved by Marduk in Enuma Elish, after his ascension to power” (Aaron 2002: 34). For warnings against lumping everything from the ancient Near East together, see Lo ́pez-Ruiz 2010: e.g, 79 and 99. 81. Cf. Machinist 1991: 199. 82. For scholarship’s turn toward tracing the different ways ancient Near Eastern and Greek cultures thought through similar questions, see Bachvarova 2008b: 93 and Lo ́pez-Ruiz 2010: 21. 83. Feeney offers an instructive analogue for this thesis: in Apollonios’s Argonautica, Zeus’s “oppressive absence” characterizes the god (1991: 65–69, quotation on 69). </page> <page sequence="18"> ready: Zeus, Divine Incomparability, and Similes 73 anything. That is, one can mark a god as incomparable either by saying as much, as the ancient Near Eastern traditions do, or by not comparing him or her to anything, as the Homeric tradition does. The lack of similes reveals Zeus to be incomparable and thereby reaffirms his superiority 84. If we widen our search parameters, however, we shall learn still more about how not comparing Zeus to anything informs his characterization. As the fol- lowing discussion is a bit involved, let me lay out the course of the argument. First, I observe how, in light of a feature of similes in general, Zeus’s distance from simile helps to depict him as unknowable. Second, I interrogate at greater length Zeus’s authorial stance. This portion itself divides into two halves. I begin by investigating how two specific components of Zeus’s authorial persona are reinforced by his distance from simile in light of three features of the Homeric simile. I then explore how Zeus’s authorial stance as a whole is strengthened by his distance from simile in light of the connection between similes in the Homeric narrator-text and the poet’s authorship. In order to generate a successful simile, one must have a good grasp of both the tenor and the vehicle because one needs to be able to discern the point(s) of contact between the unlike terms. For example, the simile, “Cigarettes are like time bombs,” relies on a feature shared by the two terms: both have the potential to cause harm at some point in the future 85. Yet fashioning a simile is more than a matter of knowing the various features of the tenor and vehicle, as Andrew Ortony’s discussion of salience imbalance reveals (1979). Josef Stern summarizes Ortony’s analysis of why the simile “Billboards are like warts” makes sense but the simile “Warts are like billboards” does not: The feature “being ugly” is stereotypically significant for and hence a highly salient feature of warts but not of billboards. Hence there is a considerable salience-imbalance—low salience in A [billboards], high salience in B [warts]. Its high salience in B in turn increases the weighting of the shared properties, including ugliness, of billboards and warts, and thus their degree of similarity. In contrast, in “warts are like billboards” there are no comparable shared properties with high salience in the representation of “billboards” and low salience in the representation for “warts,” decreasing the degree of similarity. 2000: 151 84. The idea of incomparability appears in various other guises in Homeric epic. Statements that use comparative words denoting “like” or “as” and resemble literal similarity claims depict the referent as incomparable. For instance, in ruing his failure to defend Patroklos, Achilleus describes himself: “I, who am such as (toios . . . hoios) no other of the bronze-armoured Achaians / in battle” (Il. 18.105–106). Antinoos claims that the Achaian queens of old do not rival Penelope: “for none of these knew thoughts so wise as those (homoia) Penelope / knew” (Od. 2.121–22). In addition, superlative claims as to who is the best abound: some heroes are unparalleled in general (e.g., Il. 2.580, 2.768–69, 16.271, and Od. 11.550–51), others in a specific endeavor (e.g., Il. 1.69, 7.221, 13.313–14, and 23.891); in all cases, incomparability is implied. 85. The example comes from Chiappe, Kennedy, and Smykowski 2003: 103. </page> <page sequence="19"> 74 classical antiquity Volume 31/No. 1 /April 2012 To craft an interpretable simile, one needs a fairly detailed understanding of not only the attributes of the tenor and vehicle but also the relative salience (i.e., importance) of those attributes. Viewing Homeric similes from this angle suggests how the lack of statements to the effect “Zeus (is) like X” can characterize Zeus. The point of such an omission is twofold. On the one hand, it is difficult to pin down that which defines Zeus 86. On the other hand, even if one can make up a list of Zeus’s attributes, it is impossible to arrange them in any type of hierarchy such that one attribute becomes of greater importance than another. Zeus is the ultimate embodiment of, for example, cunning (me ̄tis) and strength (bie ̄) and foresight, all working in concert to ensure his dominion.87 Zeus is also characterized as an authorial figure 88. An essential component of this side of Zeus is his control over the epics’ stories. Keeping in mind two features of the Homeric simile itself—its separateness from the surrounding narrative and its reliance on the differences between its component parts—we can consider how Zeus’s distance from simile reinforces this element of his authorial persona. Just so, another component of this side of Zeus is his production of analogical omens. Keeping in mind yet another feature of the Homeric simile—its relationship to analogical omens—we can consider how Zeus’s distance from simile reinforces this element of his authorial persona as well. I beginwith Zeus’s control over the epics’ stories. Recent scholarship instructs us not to be misled by the fact that the scenes involving the chief god tend not to be action-packed and that in the Odyssey Zeus is seldom seen 89. Concentrating on Zeus’s agency 90, Bruce Heiden argues in one article that however important Achilleus’s actions are to the course of the Iliad there is always a corresponding “dramatic counterassertion of Zeus’s [will]” (1996: 21) and in another that “Zeus—not Achilles—is the most influential character in the Iliad, the hub around which the whole plot turns” (2002: 245).91 James Marks contends that Zeus 86. Analogously, only Apollo knows what Zeus plans on doing (see h.Merc. 535–38; cf. Il. 1.545–50). It is a mark of Achilleus’s distinction that “often he had a word from his mother, not known to mortals (nosphin akouo ̄n [literally, “hearing [it] apart [from others]”]); / she was ever telling him what was the will (noe ̄ma) of great Zeus” (Il. 17.408–409). 87. Cook finds that the Odyssey’s Odysseus best approximates Zeus in “integrating wisdom and force” (1995: 32). Cf. Martin 1989: 54: “Nestor, Agamemnon, and Achilles all have stylistic habits that echo those of Zeus; no one hero manages his entire repertoire (although Achilles comes closest).” 88. For discussion of how Zeus takes on some of the attributes of the poet, see Nimis 1999: 76, Currie 2006: 19, and Wilson 2007: esp. 154, 159, and 160. 89. Cf. Dra ̈ger’s take (2001) on Zeus in Apollonios’s Argonautica: Zeus may be absent from the main story, but his anger drives the plot. In the Odyssey, “Zeus appears four times in the main narrative” (Marks 2008: 2). 90. Bakker speaks of an “agent” as one who not only acts but also prompts others to action (1997: 64–66, 93, and 105) or prompts a given sequence of events (178 and 182). Cf. Heiden 2002: 241. 91. See also Heiden 2008: 23–36 and 67–83 and Rousseau 2001 (who in exploring the centrality of Zeus stresses the gradual emergence of his plan [esp. 146 and 152] as others have done: see </page> <page sequence="20"> ready: Zeus, Divine Incomparability, and Similes 75 plays just as vital a role in his handful of appearances in the Odyssey, which “subtly but purposefully traces causation for the events in the main narrative to the machinations of Zeus” (2008: 22–23).92 A simple shift to a narratological perspective already latent in these studies of Zeus’s agency will be helpful 93. The narratologist’s “story” is “the narrated events, abstracted from their disposition in the text and reconstructed in their chronological order, together with the participants in these events 94.” The following passages well illustrate Zeus’s guidance of the story because they point to his generating a chain of successive events 95. The narrator depicts Zeus as in command of the story’s trajectory. The Trojans rush the Achaian ships “and were bringing to accomplishment Zeus’s orders” (Δι&amp;ς δ2 τ λειον  φετμ!ς) (Il. 15.593). Zeus, the narrator reports, is temporarily backing Hektor: once the god sees the ships burning, he will arrange to drive the Trojans back and give kudos to the Achaians (15.596–602). In another scene, Zeus assents to half of Achilleus’s request: Patroklos will push the Trojans back from the Achaian ships but will not return safely from the battle (Il. 16.249–52). The chief god’s control over the story is, however, most apparent in the powerful performative utterances that Marks labels his “table of contents” speeches (2008: 40).96 For instance, Zeus provides Hera with an outline of the events to come: Hektor will rout the Achaians; Patroklos will enter the fray; Hektor will kill him after Patroklos kills Sarpedon; Achilleus will slay Hektor in retaliation; and the Achaians will sack Troy (Il. 15.59–71).97 In a scene in Schadewaldt 1938: 112–13 and 146 and Allan 2008: 208n.18; cf. Feeney 1991: 62 and 64 on how Apollonios in the Argonautica delays explaining Zeus’s will and his motives). On Achilleus’s learning “that his own anger may have been subordinate to Zeus’s greater intentions,” see Scodel 2008: 123. (Elsewhere Scodel points to moments in which Zeus’s status as a spectator is stressed, namely during the deaths of Sarpedon and Hektor [2002: 192].) Discussions of the multiplicity of meanings in the proem’s assertion, “and the will of Zeus was accomplished” (Il. 1.5), also highlight Zeus’s importance: see Murnaghan 1997, Clay 1999, and Allan 2008; cf. Nagy 1999: 77, 81 sect. 24n.2, and 130–31 (Marks 2008: 9n.7 provides further citations to Nagy’s discussions of the topic). Note that Heiden is keen to allow for the agency of other gods in the Iliad (e.g., 2008: 170–73). 92. Differently, Murnaghan 1995 takes Athene “as the source and sponsor of the plot” of the Odyssey (quotation on 61); cf. Clayton 2004: 25–26. Allan 2006: 20–21 and Minchin 2007: 140n.57 discern Athene’s subordination to Zeus. 93. Cf. Marks on the “equation of Zeus’s divine plan with the epic narrative plan” (2008: 136). 94. Rimmon-Kenan 1983: 3. The “discourse” (or the “telling”) “points us to the narrative’s actual language and structure” (Woloch 2003: 38). On difficulties with and objections to the distinction between story and discourse, see Morrison 2007: 27–29, who nonetheless concludes that “distinguishing between them is still a fruitful and indispensable way of proceeding” (28); see also Laird 1999: 46–63 and Lowe 2000: 17–27. 95. These sorts of passages are more relevant to our inquiry than those in which Zeus is said to grant the Trojans success in battle (see, e.g., Il. 11.300), although the latter also are pertinent in that they remind us of Zeus’s plan (see Janko 1992: ad 13.345–60 who provides a list of citations). 96. On Zeus as a performative speaker, see Martin 1989: 53 and Heiden 1996: 20; cf. Detienne 1996: 71. 97. Schadewaldt emphasizes how Zeus lays out what is to happen in this speech (1938: 111 and 113) and also observes that the god’s speech at Il. 11.185–94 is “the poet’s program for the battle from [books] 11 to 15” (“das Programm des Dichters fu ̈r die Schlacht des L bis zum O”) (110). </page> <page sequence="21"> 76 classical antiquity Volume 31/No. 1 /April 2012 the Odyssey, Zeus previews Odysseus’s journey home for Hermes: Odysseus will make his way to Skheria on a raft; the Phaiakians will lavish gifts upon him; and he will return to Ithaka with more wealth than he amassed at Troy (Od. 5.30–42).98 To the extent that he guides the story in each epic, Zeus adopts an authorial stance 99. For their part, similes usually occur not at the level of the story but at the level of the discourse 100. Accordingly, scholars have long noted how similes retard the action of the narrative or build suspense101 and have attended to the Homeric simile’s detachability. One could theoretically remove many of the similes from the poem without doing too much violence to the logic of the narrative 102. Rare are the occasions, termed “narration through imagery” by Oliver Lyne, in which a given action is narrated over the course of a simile 103. A provocative intersection emerges between Zeus’s characterization as authoritative plotter, on the one hand, and the lack of figuration applied to the god, on the other. When Zeus appears, he routinely demonstrates his control over the story and thereby emphasizes his authorial position. Appropriately, he has nothing to do as a tenor with the alternate, non-story-oriented register of simile. For that distance reaffirms his links with the story and, therefore, his authorial stance. There is another, more precise way to think about Zeus’s control over the epics’ stories, which in turn leads us to another attribute of the Homeric simile. Zeus weaves together various narratives advocated by the other divinities. In the Iliad, he merges Hera’s desire to destroy Troy with Thetis’s wish for the Trojans’ martial success,104 and he brings the poem to a close by reconciling Apollo’s demand that Hektor’s corpse be returned with Hera’s insistence that the gods not honor Hektor more than Achilleus 105. Marks has a similar take on the Odyssey: “[Odysseus] is the object of Athene’s care and Poseidon’s hatred. The perspective of Zeus, on the other hand, transcends the aims of either god, and his He takes these two speeches, along with Zeus’s words at Il. 8.473–76, as “the series of predictions that to a great extent point the way” (“die Reihe der weithin richtungweisenden Vorhersagen”) (111). Other passages of interest are Il. 15.232–35, 17.448–55, and 24.74–76. 98. See Marks 2008: 39–43. Zeus’s control over the story also emerges in a similar fashion in omens. Omens “radiate” a “speech-act” (Nagy 1990: 168n.95), and when voiced by characters that speech-act presents a rough outline of events to come. For the principle that “the plot of Homeric narrative is coefficient with the prophecies contained by the narrative,” see Nagy 2002: 146. 99. On the need for a poet to get the story right, see Finkelberg 1998: 124 and 129. 100. See de Jong 2004: 125; cf. Wofford 1992: 33–34 and 40. 101. See Edwards 1987: 109 and 1991: 39; cf. Richardson 1990: 15, 16, and 64–65. 102. See Edwards 1991: 28 and 32. 103. For instance, a simile comparing Hektor to a horse narrates the Trojan’s return to battle (Il. 15.263–70). See Lyne 1989: Chapter 4; cf. Moulton 1977: 39n.45 and 75–76, Edwards 1987: 107–108 and 1991: 28 and 32, and Richardson 1990: 65. Nimis 1987: 85 argues that the simile at Il. 16.155–65 takes the place of the usual meal held before battle and thereby “get[s] the text from Point A to Point C.” 104. See Alvis 1995: 17–19. Cf. Taplin 1992: 262–63, Clay 1999: 44, Rousseau 2001: 137–38 and 148–49, and Allan 2006: 14. 105. See esp.

From this perspective as well, his connection to authoring emerges clearly. By contrast, for all their apparent eclipsing of difference between distinct realms of nature or experience, Homeric similes rely just as much on the dis- junction between tenor and vehicle. Oliver Taplin opines, “What seems more and more evident to me, under the influence no doubt of the critical movements of the last couple of decades, is that an effective simile does its work through dissimilarity no less than, or even more than, similarity—it needs both” (2007: 178, emphasis in original). Elizabeth Minchin deftly brings out this feature of the simile likening the fall of Asios to the fall of a tree “which in the mountains the carpenters / have hewn down with their whetted axes to make a ship timber” (τ8ν τ  οupsilonlenisacuteρεσι τ κτονες (νδρες /  E ταμον πελ κεσσι νε8κεσι ν8ϊον εUναι, Il. 13.390–91): The introduction of men and their purposeful and productive occupations points up, by contrast, the pathos of the target scene: the wasteful killing, on the battlefield, of one of the bold Trojan allies. There is nothing productive about this. At this point the target domain and the source domain are violently at odds, to such an extent that we cannot overlook the disparity. The simile, therefore, vivid because of its detailed imagery, gains further affective force through a bold, unexpected, and unstated contrast of opposites. 2001: 147 Such similes exploit and even revel in the gap between their component parts 107. Zeus’s distance from similes, then, goes hand in hand with and underscores his portrayal as a unifying force who constructs one story from the competing narratives requested and even demanded by his fellow divinities. Once again, Zeus’s distance from figuration bolsters his status as an authorial figure. Zeus also emerges as an authorial figure through his production of analogical omens 108. Beyond their proleptic value, Zeus’s analogical omens can characterize 106. See also Lowe 2000: 140. 107. Primavesi 2004 evaluates similes’ dissimilarity from a thematic perspective while Nannini 2003: 49–91 views it as a cognitivematter. Wofford 1992: 29–66 explores how the fact of dissimilarity unmasks the ideological work behind similes’ assertions of similarity. 108. Examples of Zeus’s non-analogical omens can be found at Il. 24.314–21 and Od. 20.102– 104. Only Zeus generates analogical omens. Kalchas says, “Zeus of the counsels has shown us this great portent” (Il. 2.324) (cf. Il. 12.209). The narrator labels a falcon plucking a dove a “swift messenger of Apollo” (Od. 15.525–34) in what is perceived by the external audience as an analogical omen and perhaps also by the internal audience. (The interpreter Theoklymenos declares, “No other family shall be kinglier than yours in the country / of Ithaka, but you shall have lordly power forever” [15.533–34]. We have to tease out the analogy: “Eurymachus’s aspirations [see 15.519–24] to take over Odysseus’s position will be in vain” [de Jong 2001: 382 ad 15.508–46]. That is, Theoklymenos assumes that the dove represents Odysseus’s challenger, Eurymachos. He may not, however, have </page> <page sequence="23"> 78 classical antiquity Volume 31/No. 1 /April 2012 their referents 109. A series of these omens in the Odyssey depict Odysseus and Telemachos as powerful eagles and the suitors as victimized doves or geese.110 Furthermore, analogical omens require readers.111 Kalchas reads the omen of the snake and birds that appears to the Greeks amassed at Aulis (Il. 2.303– 30). As Telemachos prepares to leave Sparta, Helen reads the omen of an eagle flying by on the right and carrying a goose (Od. 15.160–81). Note that the character who analyzes the omen offers the one correct reading. Unlike later texts, Homeric epic nowhere indicates that “a divine sign could have multiple and varied interpretations 112.” Any debate prompted by an omen is not over what it means but whether it means. When Eurymachos (Od. 2.181–82) and Hektor (Il. 12.237–40) reject what an omen reader has to say, each denies that a figurative equation has been offered in the first place.113 So what does a particular suitor in mind but think the dove an apt symbol for the suitors as a whole: in a later reference to the omen, he says it portended that Odysseus is “devising evils for all of the suitors” [Od. 17.159].) The epithet does not mean that Apollo sends the omen. This would be his sole appearance in the poem’s main narrative. See de Jong 2001: 383 ad 15.525–38 for possible reasons why the epithet is used here. An argument in favor of Zeus’s authorship is the omen’s message concerning rule over Ithaka. Zeus is the god of kingship (see Il. 1.279 and Hes. Th. 96 and Dowden 2006: 72–78). Other gods do not construct analogical omens: Athene sends a heron as a non-analogical omen signaling divine favor to Odysseus and Diomedes as they set out on their nighttime raid (Il. 10.274–76). In taking on the shape of a bird as she departs from Pylos, Athene becomes a non-analogical omen herself (Od. 3.371–79) (see Bushnell 1982: 10). 109. Cf. Barker 2009: 132 on Zeus’s “desire to control both the narrative and interpretation of it.” 110. See Od. 2.146–67, 15.160–78, 15.525–34, and 19.536–50. See de Jong 2001: 53. 111. See Bushnell 1982: 1. 112. Collins 2002: 19. Poulydamas’s reading of the omen of the eagle and snake in Iliad 12 is an important test case. In his recapitulation of the narrator’s presentation of the omen, Poulydamas ends by claiming that the eagle that drops the snake “could not finish carrying it back to give to his children” (Il. 12.222). The narrator made no mention of this goal. Bushnell says, “On the basis of this ‘supplement,’ Poulydamas then introduces the terms of comparison with the Trojan situation” (1982: 4). This paraphrase overstates the importance of the final addition. The reading Poulydamas provides at 12.223–27 may be consistent with his own recapitulation of the omen at 12.217–22 with its closing comment on the eagle’s children: the eagle’s failure to get back home having successfully accomplished its mission parallels the Trojans’ failure to return (cf. Collins 2002: 37). But his reading is also perfectly in tune with the narrator’s description of the omen at 12.200–207: note, for instance, how the bird flies off racked with pain just as, according to Poulydamas, the Trojans, having lost many men, will not return “in good order” (ou kosmo ̄i), or how the snake strikes (kopse) the bird just as the Achaians will slay (de ̄io ̄so ̄sin) Trojans, a verb that can be used to describe an animal tearing at its prey (Il. 16.158 and 17.65). I cannot follow those who say that Poulydamas “subverts” (Bushnell 1982: 11) or “reinterprets” (see Collins 2002: 37) the omen. The message “read” by the omen reader is the message sent by the god: the Trojans will not accomplish their goal. There is no question about what the omen means. 113. It is imprecise to say, as Collins does, that Eurymachos “disagree[s] with the particular interpretation of the omen by Halitherses” (2002: 22) in Odyssey 2 and that Hektor “misread[s]” (37) the omen in Iliad 12 or, as Pratt does, that these passages “acknowledge the possibility of alternate interpretations” (1994: 150n.9). These statements suggest that Eurymachos and Hektor propose exegeses of their own (cf. Collins 2002: 36), whereas (as Collins points out [e.g., 22 and 38]) both seek to dismiss the whole interpretative enterprise outright. Similarly, the suitors belittle Theoklymenos’s report on the “supernatural phenomena” (de Jong 2001: 501 ad 20.345–86) affecting the suitors: “Pallas Athene / stirred up uncontrollable laughter, and addled their thinking. / Now they </page> <page sequence="24"> ready: Zeus, Divine Incomparability, and Similes 79 reading an analogical omen entail? An analogical omen “radiates” a “speech- act 114.” The omen tells what will happen in the future using a visual medium and substituting animals for people or phenomena in the human world 115. When a character reads an analogical omen, he or she retells this tale but with two important differences. He or she shifts the performance medium from the visual to the oral, and he or she identifies what people or phenomena in the human world the animal actors represent 116. As the sole disseminator of analogical omens that characterize and that require readers in the sense outlined here, Zeus strengthens his authorial stance 117. Homerists usually point to the connections between analogical omens and similes.118 They are both figurative equations that align a tenor with a vehicle, and, to anticipate my final point, like analogical omens, similes are linked to authorship. Strikingly, then, that from which Zeus is distanced (similes) and that with which he is exclusively joined (analogical omens) overlap. Like those noted in Part I, this phenomenon highlights the lack of statements in the shape “Zeus (is) like X.” Stressing the similarities between similes and omens, however, may cause one to overlook their more significant divergences. First, both gods and mortals can utter similes, but only Zeus can fashion analogical omens. Second, analogical omens make do with a limited cast of characters, whereas a vast array of flora and fauna appear in the vehicle portions of similes. Third, all omens, including analogical ones, are fleeting, whereas the vehicle portion of a simile refers to laughed with jaws that were no longer their own. / The meat they ate was a mess of blood, their eyes were bursting / full of tears, and their laughter sounded like lamentation. / Godlike Theoklymenos now spoke out among them: / ‘Poor wretches, what evil has come on you? Your heads and faces / and the knees underneath you are shrouded in night and darkness; / a sound of wailing has broken out, your cheeks are covered / with tears, and the walls bleed, and the fine supporting pillars. / All the forecourt is huddled with ghosts, the yard is full of them / as they flock down to the underworld and the darkness. The sun / has perished out of the sky, and a foul mist has come over’” (Od. 20.345–57). Eurymachos finds it absurd that “he likens these things to night” (20.362 [my translation]), and others mock Theoklymenos’s attempt at “prophecy” (manteuesthai) (20.380). The suitors do not debate with Theoklymenos over the significance of his vision; they deny it happened at all. Compare as well Penelope’s reaction (19.560–69) to Odysseus’s interpretation of her dream in which an eagle kills her twenty pet geese and then returns to explain that he represents Odysseus and the suitors represent the geese. Penelope denies not the validity of his reading of the omen but that the events it portends will come to pass. 114. I again use Nagy’s diction (see n.98 above). 115. On the importance of analogical omens as visions, see Nagy 2002: 144. 116. When characters “read” non-analogical omens, they discern a general message of divine favor or disapproval that they sometimes report orally (e.g., Il. 8.175–76) and sometimes do not (e.g., Il. 8.251–52). 117. One appreciates Bushnell’s description of omens as “divine writing” (1982: 6) but is duly aware of the complications that arise when coupling in the same sentence writing and anything having to do with Homeric poetry (see Collins 2002: 37 and Elmer 2005: 2–3). 118. On omens and similes, see Podlecki 1967: 14–15, Austin 1975: 118 and 124, Bushnell 1982, Lonsdale 1990a: 112–15, Muellner 1990: 98–99, Anhalt 1995, and Clay 1999: 47. </page> <page sequence="25"> 80 classical antiquity Volume 31/No. 1 /April 2012 events that happen regularly 119. Fourth, omens are events at the level of the story, whereas similes generally occur at the level of the discourse, as observed above 120. Accordingly, omens appear to both internal and external audiences,whereas simi- les in the narrator-text are meant only for external narratees 121. Fifth and finally (and most important), analogical omens operate through identification 122. The snake at Aulis eats nine birds in total. Kalchas divines the relevance of that number: “so for years as many as this shall we fight in this place / and in the tenth year we shall take the city of the wide ways” (Aς ?με*ς τοσσαupsilonperispomeneτ   τεα πτολεμ Eομεν αupsilonlenisperispomeneθι, / τ M δεκ!τωM δ2 π λιν α9ρ8σομεν εupsilonlenisρυ!γυιαν, Il. 2.328–29). Penelope dreams that an eagle kills her pet geese. The intruder says, “The geese are the suitors, and I, the eagle, have been / a bird of portent, but now I am your own husband, come home” (χBνες μ2ν μνηστBρες,  γW δ  τοι α ετ&amp;ς Lρνις / Xα π!ρος, νupsilonperispomeneν αupsilonlenisperispomeneτε τε&amp;ς π σις ε λ8λουθα, Od. 19.548–49).123 In analogical omens, a vehicle stands for a tenor. As a result, when it comes to analogical omens, the inevitable disjunction between tenor and vehicle does not mean anything or per- form any thematic work, and, appropriately, readers of these omens do not make arguments based on the differences between the tenor and vehicle 124. In fact, the space between the terms is never acknowledged. As noted above, when rejecting the omen reading of another character, neither Eurymachos (Od. 2.181–82) nor Hektor (Il. 12.237–40) presents a different reading. Such an act would imply that, unlike his, the initial account leaves too great a gap between the compared terms. Helen may equivocate as to whether Odysseus is on his way home or already at home (Od. 15.174–78), but she does not suggest alternative identifications for the eagle and goose other than the ones she implies: the eagle stands for Odysseus, and the goose for the suitors. By contrast, note two scholars’ assessments of the space between tenor and vehicle in a simile. Hayden Pelliccia finds that similes liken one action to another but not their respective actors: the purpose behind comparing Achilleus to a leaping lion, for example, “does not seem to be to assert what Achilles is like, but to bring his leaping more vividly to the eye” (2002: 119. On the ephemeral nature of omens, see Bushnell 1982: 6. The rule-proving exception is the omen at Aulis (Il. 2.303–20): Zeus turns the snake into stone after it has eaten the mother bird and her nestlings and renders “the vision permanent and unchanging” (Nagy 2002: 144; cf. 147). On the repeatability of the events in the vehicle portion of a simile, see Muellner 1990: 96 and de Jong 2004: 94. 120. Note the omen sent by Zeus to embolden Priam: an eagle with a wingspan like in size to a doorframe flies by on the right hand side (Il. 24.314–21). The omen is an event in the story. The simile emerges in the telling about the omen. 121. See de Jong 2004: 125. 122. Cf. Collins 2002: 24. 123. For this scene as an omen, see Pratt 1994: 150 and de Jong 2001: 480 ad 19.535–69. 124. The ominous eagle at Odyssey 15.160–65 is chased by “shouting. . ./ men and women” (15.162–63, my translation). Their response is probably not part of the omen. If it is and is taken as a point of contrast with the reaction of Telemachos and those around him (as de Jong 2001: 370 ad 15.160–81 seems to judge the matter), we note that Helen, who reads the sign, does not find any meaning in that opposition. </page> <page sequence="26"> ready: Zeus, Divine Incomparability, and Similes 81 199). Of the simile at Il. 11.559–65 in which Aias’s stubborn refusal to yield to the Trojans prompts the image of a donkey driven from a field by boys, Egbert Bakker writes: “Nor is Aias actually compared to a donkey, or the Trojans to boys” (2005: 134). These interpreters overstate the matter, but their comments return us to the proposition noted above that similes make much of the dissim- ilarity between tenor and vehicle. Because analogical omens and similes operate in fundamentally distinct ways, I conclude the following: Zeus’s distance from simile, one type of figurative phenomenon, is consistent with and buttresses his connection to analogical omens, another, substantively different type of figurative phenomenon. That move in turn reinforces his authorial position. I have been exploring the absence of statements in the shape “Zeus (is) like X” in light of two different elements of Zeus’s authorial persona. I finish with a broader observation. Because similes in the Homeric narrator-text refer us to the poet’s authorship, Zeus’s distance from simile augments his own status as an authorial figure. Similes in the narrator-text not only accentuate the poet’s role as presenter and composer but also offer his interpretations of the narrated events, interpretations meant to shape the audience’s response to the story. First, Scott Richardson classifies similes as a type of pause “in which we are made to sense the presence of a mediator who has momentarily brought the progress of the story to a halt” (1990: 36). The poet’s interrupting the narrative with a simile reaffirms his control over the presentation of the tale 125. Second, other critics argue that certain similes or certain kinds of similes allude to the poet as a creative composer. Steven Lonsdale contends that not only in ekphraseis but also in similes that carefully attend to “visual phenomena” “the poet implicitly compares himself to a visual artist” (1990b: 12). In reference to the Iliad, Naomi Rood proposes a “metaphorical reading of all the poem’s coherent shipbuilding imagery as an analogy to the constructive work of the poet as he shapes nature into culture, mortality into immortality” (2008: 41). Margalit Finkelberg observes how two similes that liken Odysseus to a singer evoke, respectively, the bard’s “mastery” of “the proper sequence of events within a given story” (see Od. 11.368) (1998: 51) and his abilities as relate to “the content of song” (see Od. 17.518–21) (91).126 That is, at these two moments, the poet reminds us of the skills required of a composer for a good performance. Third, Irene de Jong observes that similes are “interpretations of events” (2004: 125, emphasis in original).127 On the face of it, these interpretations can be attributed to their speakers, be 125. On the more general point that similes evoke the presence of the poet, see Richardson 1990: 65–66. Note also the use in three similes of phasin “they say” (Il. 2.783 and 17.674) and kaleousin “they call” (Il. 22.29). On the ways in which these two words make “us aware of our reliance on the narrator,” see Stoddard 2004: 49–54 (quotation on 53). 126. A third simile reminds us of the poet’s skill in playing the lyre (Od. 21.405–409) (see Finkelberg 1998: 50). I cite Finkelberg’s analysis of these much-discussed similes because she properly teases out the differences between them (see Ready 2010: 153–54). 127. Cf. Lonsdale 1990a: 113 and Wofford 1992: 33. </page> <page sequence="27"> 82 classical antiquity Volume 31/No. 1 /April 2012 it a character or the narrator. Yet an important strand in Homeric criticism grants the narrator a privileged status. De Jong says that he “can be considered Homer’s fictional representative inside the text” (2004: 44). Katherine Stoddard turns to one variant of the concept of the implied author to explicate this idea: “What a non- dramatized narrator does reflect is the ‘implied author,’ the image of himself that the author chooses to project in that work” (2004: 41, emphasis in original).128 This understanding of the narrator’s special position challenges the above statement about the attribution of the interpretation found in a simile in the narrator-text. We should rather say that the interpretation is communicated by the narrator but is the judgment of the implied author. Stoddard contends, for example, “By observing the narrator’s use of descriptive adjectives, adverbs, and similes as well as by noting the result of Achilles’ actions on others in the story, we can be reasonably certain of the implied author’s opinion of these actions” (2004: 41, emphasis added).129 In building on this assertion, let us first observe that the implied author is customarily thought to be either “the image of himself that the author chooses to project in that work” (as Stoddard says) or “an inference made by the recipient about the author on the basis of the work.”130 With that clarification in mind, we can then note that an audience attributes the interpretations presented in similes in the narrator-text to the poet in so far as it assigns them to the implied author, conceived of as either “a second self 131” created by the poet or the audience’s vision of the poet. Now, these similes, as interpretations, seek to characterize and thereby influence the audience’s reaction to the story. It is to be concluded that at such moments the poet emerges as a guiding force 132. In these 128. Even Rabel, who distinguishes between the Iliad’s implied poet (1997: 24–25) and the Muse(s)-narrator, finds that “[t]hroughout the middle books of the poem (books 5–17), the [implied] poet seems to merge with his narrator” (89), that is, the narrator can be thought of as “speaking for the [implied] poet” (89). See also Richardson 1990: 4. Cf. Bakker 2009: 124, who queries “a distinction that is dear to the narratologist, the distinction between real life, historical author and fictional narrator. . . . In a narratology of Homeric performance, the biographical, the external ‘I’ and the fictional, the internal ‘I’ collapse in the typical deixis of the performance” (emphasis in original). 129. Note as well: “similes could be analyzed as sections of Commentary” and “Commentary. . . strongly suggest[s] the implied author’s own persona” (Stoddard 2004: 154 and 162, respectively). 130. This latter definition provided by Kindt and Mu ̈ller 2006: 8 (cf. 100–101); cf. Rimmon- Kenan 1983: 87 and Edwards 1987: 30. For more on these two irreconcilable notions of the implied author (and how they are embedded already in Wayne Booth’s preliminary articulations of the concept), see Kindt and Mu ̈ller 2006: 58–61. At 152–55, they reject the second approach (i.e., the one of the implied author as “the author-image of the reader” [60]) in spite of the fact that their own proposal to understand “the implied author in the context of hypothetical intentionalism” (176) relies on some of the very same language that they use to describe the second approach: compare 174 with 59. 131. Kindt and Mu ̈ller 2006: 80. For the author’s control over the implied author in this model, see how implied authors are described as “images that authors produce of themselves in their works” and note “if the author of a concrete text is attempting to put across an image of himself” (180). 132. For other times when the poet offers his “interpretation” and “judgment,” see Richardson 1990: 148–66. </page> <page sequence="28"> ready: Zeus, Divine Incomparability, and Similes 83 three ways, then, similes in the narrator-text direct us to the poet’s controlling authorial hand.133 An additional reason for the pronounced lack of statements in the shape “Zeus (is) like X” emerges. Such similes would point toward the poet’s authoring and would make Zeus the object of that demonstration. They would thereby deflect attention from the portrayal of Zeus as himself authorial. Instead, their absence bolsters that important component of the god’s characterization. CONCLUSION When addressing the fact that the Homeric tradition does not deploy state- ments in the shape “Zeus (is) like X,” we should look to the explicit assertions of divine incomparability in ancient Near Eastern texts. Just as ancient Near Eastern traditions characterize a god by declaring it impossible to fashion a comparison about him or her, so the Homeric epics characterize Zeus by avoiding statements based on the template “Zeus (is) like X.” The epics use that absence to mark the chief god as incomparable, to position him as to some degree ungraspable or unable to be categorized, and, finally, to strengthen their depiction of Zeus as an authorial figure.
