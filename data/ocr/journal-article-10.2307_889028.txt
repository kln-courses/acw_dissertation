<plain_text><page sequence="1">Vienna and Budapest Illusions of Eden Illusions of Eden: Visions of the American Heartland, on view at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Budapest (to 26th November) spearheads a curatorial pro- gramme entitled The Heartland Project. This complex campaign, which includes further shows - one devoted to post-War art has already been held in Vienna while another is scheduled for next year - seeks to evalu- ate the past and present-day culture of two disparate yet purportedly 'intertwined' regions: the Central United States and Central Europe.'

Hopefully these regionalist milestones will be restored on the concluding Ameri- can leg of the tour because the current assemblage ironically has a rather Eastern bloc flavour, dominated as it is by mono- chromatic photographs, prints and dour canvases. However, the concept behind the exhibition manages to range well beyond its local particulars and, in truth, a certain greyness somehow even suits the spirit of the Midwest. For the heartland's lack of obvious appeal may be one of its strengths - an absence of razzmatazz that has made it grow fonder to the American heart. Illusions of Eden often implies that if home is indeed where the heart is, we should seek it on our own humble doorsteps. In Russell Lee's Old and new (Fig.67) a sharecropper watches his new house being built literally next door and, in another Lee photograph, we are given to understand that the history of Woodbury County, Iowa, is inscribed in the hands of a homesteader's wife (Fig.68). The prevalent message is that 'true' reality resides in inwardness and a plain sense of things. To imagine that any nation has a 'heart' of course presupposes an illusion, one that sets an organic pattern on impersonal facts, generating myths that are the primary material of political and artistic strategies. The fascination of the art in this case is its capacity to illustrate how taking the pulse of an illusory heartbeat yields readings that are as variable as the human imagina- tion itself. Here the show's clever title works wonders by squaring the circle that con- nects Eden to dystopia. Given the founding fantasy of America as embodying virgin land and a New Jerusalem, artistic visions of the continent have always had a rich store of archetypes to exploit. Laminate these fabrications upon a geographic entity, the Midwest, an area with few definable limits, and the result is a protean bunch of extremes. Augurs of paradise in this 'Midwest' seem as ubiqui- tous as the conflicting signs of an irremedi- ably fallen world. On the one side, Wood's Spring turning (Fig.65), Clarence Holbrook Carter's Good crop (1942) and Maya Lin's cur- vaceous Untitled (topographic landscape) (1997) alike treat the earth as an anthropomorphic symbol. By contrast, this basic variant of the pathetic fallacy also comes unstuck umpteen times - nowhere more tellingly 65. Spring turning, by Grant Wood. 1936.

A signpost announcing the village of Utopia, Ohio, presides over a wilder- ness of mud and snow. Nature, in short, exacts revenge on those who confuse it with culture. Why have Americans been especially prone to such a confusion? Politically- aware observers credibly argue that the reasons are ideological, serving to foster or disguise vested economic and social interests. To take an exemplary paradigm, the agrarian idyll of yeoman farmers at one with the soil - ranging from picture- postcard scenes like Lois Ireland's Harvest time (1944) to the Biblical tiller of Benton's 67.

Bill, by Clarence Holbrook Carter. 1941. 119 by 56 cm. (Exh. Museum of Contemporary Art, Budapest). After many springs (1945) - posits the Mid- west as a site of timeless verities where such cultural contradictions of capitalism as agribusiness, racialism and exploitation are blithely elided. In order to balance its sums on this score, the show strives to unsettle any cosmeticised aura. Thus we get the grand guignol strike-breaking carnage of Paul Cad- mus's Herrin massacre (1940) and far less well-known items that deserve their rescue from provincial oblivion, among them Bernece Berkman's expressionist Laundry workers (1938) influenced by the Mexican muralists and the shocking lynch victim of Clarence Carter's Bill (Fig.69) - Holbein's Dead Christ hoisted aloft for the Popular Front era. And plenty of urban grime and machinery is present to chasten the images of rural bloom and bliss. The catalogue essayists likewise skip nimbly between the realities, dreams and plights of Midwestern life, adducing state fairs, The Wizard of Oz, prairie madness and other weird or won- derful insights along the way.2 Furthermore, four contemporary artists have been chosen to prove that Midwestern roots are still up to bearing new fruit. Of these, Mary Lucier's videotaped personal histories on the theme of Migrations are predictable, whereas Kerry James Marshall offers a piquant analysis of post-modern unhomeliness with a stage-set of three fabulated dwellings (Fig.70). A covert agenda, if not propaganda, nonetheless seems to underlie The Heartland Project and its curatorial manifestation. That the sponsors are Phillip Morris Companies Incorporated may be the least of several background clues, though the website sees nothing insidious in proclaiming that this mighty cigarette producer has donated 'more than $60 million' to hunger relief and AIDS awareness. Less disingenuously, linking the 'central' US states to the hotly contested notion of 'central Europe' (is that Mitteleuropa?) has a distinct resonance within the post-cold war global arena that invites further scrutiny. The crux of the matter is that the resurgence of regionalism in the widest sense - whether it be a reappraisal of Midwestern art, the boom of identity poli- tics or of balkanised European states - has come at a significant moment. It is precisely the point when monopoly capital, initiated by American ambitions, has erased local and individual identities in a global tide of commodification, disembodied data and cyber-spatial flux. Illusions ofEden overlooks this key to its own platform. What the show does offer is much evi- dence for alternative histories of American art in the last century beyond the stale polarity of avant-garde abstraction versus rear-guard figuration. The realisms that proliferated in the inter-War years in Amer- ica were, if anything, even more multifari- ous and heterodox than their European counterparts. Grant Wood, for instance, emerges as among the most unclassifiable painters of his generation on either side of the Atlantic. His work fuses neue Sachlichkeit, Yankee typology, alienated gay satire and abstract pictorial logic in a superlative syn- thesis. Or take Wright Morris's Gano grain elevator, western Kansas (1940). It is a photo- graph with all the exquisite poise of an Ellsworth Kelly canvas plus some of the totemic mystery of William Baziotes or Georgia O'Keeffe at their best. Similarly, Clyfford Still's dramas of glowing earth colours in a dark, elemental universe are foretold in the magic realist John Rogers Cox's Grey andgold (1942; Fig.66). Also running through Illusions of Eden are various object lessons about the perils of investing actual places with too much folksy or metaphysical thought. If you believe in Eden, its nemesis will not be far behind - witness the haunted dereliction of Charles Burchfield's gothic street scenes. The same applies to the feelings aroused by numerous other works, like the scary 1925 snapshot of two Klansmen chatting on a Columbus sidewalk and an array of minor pictures where folksiness approaches the volkisch, making the viewer wish that the heartland's emotive geographies were perhaps some- times less distant from the cooler light of the mind.
