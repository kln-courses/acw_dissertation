In this monograph the number of teeth has been reduced to six and the offering is considered to be intrusive. In prior publica- tions, there was no mention of other human remains, but this volume documents 233 human bones from some 33 individuals. These remains are interpreted as the result of ritual cannibalism, now posited as an important component in the Gallery's rituals. Much of the volume is devoted to a description and analysis of the ceramic, lithic, and bone artifacts and their distributions. The original pottery classification has been refined so that many of the old ware terms have been dropped and new stylistic units have been established. It remains to be seen whether these subjec- tive stylistic categories will prove useful for future studies. It also remains to be determined whether these "Chavin pottery styles" were locally produced, as Lumbreras assumes, or whether some or all of them were imports from the Central Coast, where they have strong stylistic and iconographic analogs. The appendix on the radiocarbon dates offers a long-awaited clarification of the provenience of the car- bon samples, which until now has been difficult to interpret. Judging from the new information, all but two of the analyzed samples came from post-Chavin con- texts outside the Gallery. Unfortunately, the latter are not consistent with each other, and, in my opinion, the only reliable date currently available for the Gallery is 2700 + 85 (GX-1128). Among the most intriguing new directions in Lumbreras's analysis is the effort to read the patterning in artifact distribution as a reflection of ceremonial conventions. These patterns include both the relation of artifacts to one another and their relation to the overall Gallery layout. The former consists, in Lumbreras's opinion, in the repeated placement of vessels in groups of two or three. While there are many convincing cases of this, Lumbreras's attempt to make nearly all of the pieces fit into this pattern sometimes seems forced (e.g., a pair is formed if the vessels are similar, but a pair is also formed if they are different since this con- stitutes dual opposition). Lumbreras also recognizes a larger pattern of vessels clustered near chamber entry- ways and the walls of passageways, as well as near the entrance to the Gallery. Lumbreras fails to note what may be the most striking pattern of all the chambers without ventilation ducts have large deposits of arti- facts, while those with ventilation ducts have compara- tively few materials. One wonders whether this distributional pattern represents the imprint of some rit- ual protocol or whether a noncultural force might be responsible (e.g., selective flooding as the result of water introduced through the stone-lined ducts). Two interrelated conclusions of the Lumbreras vol- ume deserve special scrutiny. The first is his belief that the intentional arrangement of the Gallery artifacts implies that the deposits are the result of a single ritual event. Even if one accepts the arguments for the sys- tematically arranged artifact dyads and triads through- out the Gallery, this does not rule out the possibility that they were introduced by repetitive ritual acts made over the course of many years. While the concentration of offerings blocking the entrance and the closure of the Gallery with stone roof beams are relevant considera- tions, the former could have been achieved by relocat- ing earlier offerings at the time of the Gallery's final closure, and the latter could have been done on multi- ple occasions following activities in the Gallery. If the assumption of the single ceremonial event is rejected, then questions can be raised about considering the Ofrendas Gallery materials as representing a single "Ofrendas phase." The substantial variability in the assemblage, including clearly younger materials, justi- fies skepticism of the proposed new phase, at least until these materials are found associated in a less ambigu- ous setting. Rather than representing a transitional phase between the Urabarriu and Chakinani phases (with a smattering of inadequately explained and later Jannabarriu intrusives), the Ofrendas Gallery offerings and the rituals that produced them may actually span all three phases. Ultimately, the principle value of the Ofrendas Gallery investigations may be the light that they shed on Early Horizon religious thought and ritual, rather than on the chronology of the Chavin de Huantar tem- ple. Lumbreras's detailed chronicle of these historic excavations and materials will provide a rich source of data and interpretations for archaeologists to explore in the decades to come.

This collection, resulting from a 1993 conference in Trujillo, Peru, is a solid mix of reports and overviews, data presentations and pathbreaking theoretical recon- siderations. Uceda and Mujica have selected articles of uniformly high quality and have provided an introduc- tory essay summarizing the history and conceptual frames of Moche studies. Verano's osteological analysis of mortality, pathol- ogy, cranial deformation, and physical variation in burials from Pacatnamu represents the first analysis of a large sample of Moche skeletal materials. Russell, Leonard, and Briceno discuss their study of ceramic production at Cerro Mayal in the Chicama Valley, the first large- scale Moche ceramic workshop excavated. Donnan and Castillo show how specific elite burials at San Jose de Moro were intended to represent personages shown in fine-line ceramic depictions of a scene known as the "Sacrifice Ceremony." One of the most significant developments of the last decade has been an increased awareness of Moche mural tradition. Narvaez and colleagues describe sal- vage excavations of a Moche I (ca. A.D. 1-100) tomb at the site of La Mina in the Jequetepeque Valley deco- rated with elegant, geometric murals. Similarly, the 1990-1992 excavations by Franco, Galvez, and Vasquez at the E1 Brujo complex in the Chicama Valley uncovered an extraordinary set of polychrome reliefs depicting scenes well known from Moche iconography, including the "Anthropomorphic Decapitator." These sites are well illustrated in this book. Few finds have been more stunning than the 1991-1992 discovery of polychrome reliefs on top of the Huaca de la Luna at the site of Moche. Uceda, Morales, Canziani, and Montoya discuss the Huaca de la Luna's construction sequence, burial patterns, and the different sets of murals depicting a fanged deity in jaguar headdress and a minor figure, thought to repre- sent a crab god. Because of the new data, the authors question a hypothesis, proposed by Michael Moseley and others, that the site of Moche was abandoned before Moche V (shortly before A.D. 600) due to flood- ing from a massive El Nino/Southern Oscillation event that was then followed by blowing dunes that covered the low-lying parts of the city. Rather, Uceda et al. argue that Huaca de la Luna continued to be occupied during Moche V, and damage from El Ninos brought about reconstruction and repair, not site abandonment. A recurrent theme in this collection is the need to reexamine traditional assumptions in the light of new archaeological data. For example, pre-Moche antecedents are explored by Shimada and Maguina in their reconsideration of Gallinazo (or Viru) culture and its relationship to Moche. As originally formulated by members of the Viru Valley project, Gallinazo was a coherent cultural tradition replaced by an expansionist Moche state. Shimada and Maguina argue that although Gallinazo was widely distributed, it was a series of independent political entities with shared ceramic styles. Rather than simply being "conquered" by the Moche state, the authors point to the varying ways Gallinazo "polities" were dominated or incorporated or influenced by the expanding Moche state. For example in the middle La Leche Valley, Shimada and Maguina (p. 53) argue that Moche and Gallinazo "maintained a symbiotic, peaceful coexistence from at least Moche I to Moche III [ca. A.D. 1450/500]," even to the extent that a single ceramic workshop from Huaca la Merced produced Moche and Gallinazo wares. Their basic point that it is misleading to assume that ceramic "styles" are equivalent to prehistoric "cultures" or "polities" is a belated lesson in Andean archaeology. In contrast to this emphasis on variations, Bawden argues for strong continuities between Gallinazo and Moche in his treatment of Moche culture as "political ideology." Bawden (p. 396) claims that "the archaeol- ogy of the Gallinazo-Moche transition suggests that regional culture continued essentially without changes" except for the realm of elite art styles. Bawden over- states the argument for Andean continuities, ignoring the real discontinuities that separate different North Coast cultures. His more general point that Andean societies should be understood "in their own light" is certainly correct, but that requires attention to the dif- ferences between those societies, not their treatment as a pan-Andean Other. Many of the authors argue that we need to recon- sider ideas of Moche expansion and political integra- tion. For example, Kaulicke's report on the Proyecto Alto Piura describes the northernmost reach of Moche influence and the interaction between Vicus and Moche. Kaulicke questions the notion of a Moche "conquest" of the far north, and instead proposes that Moche ceramic styles were incorporated into a local sociopolitical tradition. Similar reexamination is called for by Castillo and Donnan in their investigation of intact Moche shaft and chamber tombs at San Jose de Moro. Castillo and Donnan observed Moche III and Moche V ceramics created in styles distinct from those in the Moche- Chicama valleys. They also discovered an absence of Moche IV ceramics, surprising since Moche IV is tra- ditionally viewed as the period of Moche expansion and thus should be present if traditional models of expansion are correct. The data presented by Castillo</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS AND BOOK NOTES 167 and Donnan contradict the model of a unitary Moche state, expanding resolutely north from its center in the Moche-Chicama valley; their data also partially con- flict with a model of Moche expansion outlined by Shimada. Shimada argues that traditional models of Moche sociopolitical organization are based on limited data- primarily from "portrait" vessels or excavations in monumental architecture which suggested homo- geneity in Moche stylistic traditions and a polity cen- tered in the Moche Valley that expanded south and north. Instead, Shimada argues for at least two inde- pendent but interacting spheres of Moche development: one centered in the Moche-Chicama valleys, a second located in the Lambayeque and La Leche valleys two regions that developed, expanded, and briefly formed a unified North Coast polity before being cut short by a sixth-century drought. This alternative model, Shimada contends, provides a more complex and dynamic view of Moche sociopolitical integration than traditional for- mulations. This important compilation of current knowledge about the Moche communicates a sense of the fervor and ferment of Moche studies today. Perhaps most heartening, the reexaminations and new analyses in this volume are sparked by new data from recent archaeo- logical excavations rather than by shifts in theoretical fashions. Beyond Death. The Chinchorro Mummies of Ancient Chile. BERNARDO T. ARRIAZA. Smithsonian Institution Press, Washington, D.C., 1995. xv + 176 pp., 54 figures, 21 color plates, 6 tables, bibliography, index. $39.95. (cloth). Reviewed by Sonia E. Guillen, Centro Mallqui, Ilo, Peru. Las momias chinchorro han cautivado el interes de especialistas y del publico en general por su sofisticado procesamiento, el cual no concuerda con algunas expectativas de la arqueologia sobre el comportamiento funerario de sociedades no complejas. Bernardo Arriaza ofrece en este libro una compilacion y conden- sacion de muchos de los trabajos realizados sobre las momias. Tambien presenta sus propuestas de organi- zacion cronologica y cultural, y su interpretacion del significado social de estas momias. Al presentar sus objetivos en el Prefacio, Arriaza presenta su modelo interpretativo sobre las costumbres funerarias chinchorro, indicando que estas reflejan una profunda preocupac ion por la vida de spue s de la muerte, lo que condiciona la observada preocupacion en la conservacion de los cuerpos. Refiere que a su parecer el procesamiento de los cuerpos refleja una materializacion de amor y devocion, en lugar de demostraciones relacionadas a la posicion social de los individuos. Indica que sus hipotesis no pueden ser demostradas, pero que la especulacion es valida en fun- cion de la singularidad de este grupo en la prehistoria andina y mundial. E1 capitulo introductorio se refiere al descubrim- iento de las momias chinchorro, y discute la definicion del concepto de momia. E1 segundo capitulo trata vari- ados aspectos de la cultura chinchorro como unidad biologica y cultural de grupos que optaron por una estrategia de subsistencia maritima en el desierto de Atacama en el extremo sur del Peru y el norte de Chile entre los 7020 a los 1500 anos antes de Cristo. La dis- cusion sobre la terminologia de tradicion y cultura chinchorro resulta engorrosa, y conduce al autor a la propuesta que la momificacion artificial en Chinchorro no ha recibido la atencion de anteriores investigadores que han concentrado su atencion a entender las estrate- gias de subsistencia, lo que ha escondido la singulari- dad de esta practica cultural bajo el analisis tecnologico. Esto reflejaria a su parecer diferentes per- spectivas de interes entre arqueologos y antropologos ^, . rlslcos. E1 segundo capitulo incluye una revision de la teoria sobre ritos funerarios, buscando algunos ejemplos arqueologicos, etnograficos y etnohistoricos con rele- vancia al tema del libro. Indica que la teoria sobre rit- uales funerarios esta fuertemente prejuiciada hacia la ganancia economica y frecuentemente no da verdadera importancia a la perspectiva emocional humana. E1 cuarto capitulo incluye una breve referencia al habitat de los chinchorro. Datos referentes a patrones de asen- tamiento, el uso de cementerios, y desarrollos tec- nologicos son presentados en el quinto capitulo. La seleccion de graficos es muy buena, cubre e ilustra ade- cuadamente los diferentes aspectos tratados a lo largo del libro. Esta seccion incluye un pormenorizado cuadro de fechados corregidos de material chinchorro. E1 sexto capitulo trata sobre el origen de los chin- chorro y sus momias, con la propuesta que la momifi- cacion artificial fue un fenomeno cultural costeno que se desarrollo en el area de Arica-Camarones. Otro punto discutido es la razon para el desarrollo de la momificacion artificial. Arriaza propone una razon multifactorial para el uso de esta practica. Esto incluye un estimulo visual a partir de la observacion de proce- sos naturales de momificacion caracteristicos en esta zona arida, la creencia en la vida despues de la muerte, la alta frecuencia de mortalidad infantil y de adultos, desastres naturales, tragedias individuales como ahogamientos, y cambios ecologicos.</page></plain_text>
