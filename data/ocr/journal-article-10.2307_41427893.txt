The question of representational dif- ference , which has usually been connected to scientific revolutions or controversies, is framed here using the concept of "style," addressing the plurality of scientific traditions within a well-established scientific field. Using ethnomethodology we will examine the divergences of representational practices that, beyond the apparent consensus of a scientific community, are present throughout the procedure of chromosomes preparation. The ethnographic data was gathered through participant observation and in-depth interviews in several Italian clinical cytogenetic labora- tories. The concept of style emerges through the examination of the two alternate, and sometimes conflicting, ways of configuring the complex texture of practice, instrumental mediation, epistemic virtues, and expertise involved in scientific rep- resentation of chromosomes. Resonating with the recent debate on objectivity, it tries to articulate the concept of "epistemic virtue" outside an internalised scientific self through an aesthetic, analytical, instrumental, and ontological preferences in the current manners to produce and see the same research object.

Turrini methods, techniques or ways in which the same medium is used and therefore the way a particular subject or idea can be depicted. Art historian Gombrich, in his Art and Illusion (1964), discusses the "question of style," namely, the reason for which "different ages and different nations have represented the visible world in such different ways". He analyzes how pictures are "read" taking the scientific techniques used by artists (perspective, chiaroscuro, and so forth) into serious consideration, as well as the psychological theories of perception. He advances the idea that "the discovery of appearances was due not so much to a careful observation of nature as the invention of pictorial effects" (Gombrich 1964: 279). Therefore, the art of mimesis , which has played a central role in Western culture, is not a transparent reproduction achieved by mere visual impressions by a virgin eye, but the final result of a process of making an idea or a concept and matching it with the world out there in order to have plausible representations of reality. In an analogous way, it is possible to recognize divergences in visual representations of scientific objects. Thomas Kuhn treated this topic in one chapter of The Structure of Scientific Revolutions , tellingly entitled "Revolutions as Changes of World View". Drawing from the Gestalt theory, he argued that perception and cognition of reality is influenced by the paradigm that scientists adopt and, thus, "during scientific revolutions [they] see new and different things when looking with familiar instruments in places where they have looked before" (Kuhn 1962: 1 1 1). In an analogous way, Feyerabend (1975) speaks of cognitive and perceptive tendencies in interpretative frameworks of representations. A method- ological shift in the analysis of representation has been initiated by laboratory studies , which has been investigating visual representations as documents embedded in the their own context of production. Laboratory studies emphasizes the practical significance of these documents in the construction of agreement and dissemination of results (Latour and Woolgar 1979; Knorr-Cetina 1981; Lynch 1985a). Ethnography of science displaced the idea of representational practice as "a confrontation between a world and a prepared mind," understanding it rather as a form of factory production in which visual renderings, models or inscriptions are deeply integrated in a nexus of activities intending to produce and disseminate readable data (Lynch 1998). Representation has been reconceptualised as a diffused and individual activity that produces and circulates images upon the graphic and instrumental fields provided in the laboratory. The concept of the "externalized retina" (Lynch 1985b, 1990) has brilliantly wrested the idea of representation from an individualistic cognitive foundation and opened up a new stream of social studies of the visual construction of scientific evidence and data (Lynch and Woolgar 1990; Goodwin 1994, 1995, 1996). In this framework, representational differences are usually tracked back to different kinds of tacit or local knowledge (see for example Cambrosio and Keating 1988) which are at the heart of scientists' "craftsmanship" and, as such, have usually been framed in the opposition between, on the one hand, idealized scientific accounts and, on the other, actual "messy" laboratory practices (see Latour 1990, 1991; and, in particular, Knorr-Cetina 1995). More generally, differences and contingencies are explained by what is hidden or forgotten in the successful introduction and stabilization of facts and artefacts. â Springer</page><page sequence="3">Continuous Grey Scales Versus Sharp Contrasts 3 This paper intends to shed light on differences in style that coexist in the same period and are recognized within a scientific community as traditions, genre conventions, and the specific circumstances of the production process, skills, and preferences of the scientist. These stylistic diversities - even though they can be defined scientific , since they are based principally on scientific procedures perfected by the empirical method of trial and error - are not unique to the lab, but respond to varied aesthetic ways to visualize and view the same scientific object. The representative divergences discussed here are understood not as mere mental or subjective preferences but as different ways to pragmatically organize cognitive processes embedded in material tools, socially distributed forms of knowledge, and social interactions. Rather than being seen as the result of instructional gaps in protocol that are inherently part of formal rules and procedures and that need to be elaborated through the embodied, unconscious expertise of scientists (Polanyi 1958: 53), styles are considered to be the forms of social action that participants produce as recognizable patterns in a specific setting. In essence, styles are "grammars" of the representational practices which provide the socio-material organization of intelligibility of the same object (Coulter 1989). They have to be considered as normative tendencies, which, although divergent and sometimes conflicting, govern representations of the same scientific area, between perceptions and objective graphic fields, bodies and instruments, visualization and vision, aesthetic judge- ments, procedural rules and biological processes. The case study here analyzed, cytogenetics, is considered one of the most artisanal areas among the biological disciplines. It utilizes all of the knowledge and techniques involved in the study of chromosomes and, since its broad application in many medical areas (prenatal diagnosis, malformations and mental retardation paediatric analysis, and onco-hematology) it is not only well established, but also widely diffused. The observation was conducted between 2008 and 2009 in three clinical cytogenetics laboratories in Italy: one large private lab, and two smaller public ones. The methodology adopted was a participant observation; laboratory work routines we observed for a period of 6 months, in-depth "ethnographic"1 interviews were conducted with over twenty practitioners including physicians, biologists and technicians, three courses were attended in order to understand standardization in cytogeneticists' laboratory routines, leading to the analysis of protocols, guidelines and handbooks. A brief introduction will explain the specificities that make cytogenetics, and especially Italian cytogenetics labs, an ideal field for examining representational styles. Then, we will examine the two opposing styles deployed throughout the whole procedure of chromosome representation, from the cytological techniques of preparation of biological samples, "processing" according to the so-called "laboratory vernacular" (Senior 1958), up to the different visualization instru- ments - microscopes versus computerized imaging systems. 1 «Ethnographic interview» is here to be understood in the meaning specified by Mol (2002: 15 ff.), namely an interview carried out in the midst of the work environment and on work practices rather than on feelings, meanings, or perspectives. &lt;0 Springer</page><page sequence="4">4 M. Turrini The Dissemination of Cytogenetics and Italian Scientific Traditions "Cytogenetics is still perceived, and rightly so, to be as much "art" as it is science in an era when most clinical testing is becoming more and more automated or "high tech"" (Gersen and Keagle 2005b: vii). This passage of the preface of The Principle of Clinical Cytogenetics (Gersen and Keagle 2005a) points out a fundamental characteristic of this rudimentary and artisanal discipline. Even if it is widely established, its world is still essentially one of manual manipulation and diagnosis, and its craft-like practices have been recently fascinating several social scientists (Rapp 1999: ch. 8; Martin 2004; Martin and Lynch 2009). Although not automated, cytogenetics is a widely diffused and irreplaceable technique in medical settings. Since chromosomes were the first cellular component discovered as vectors of heredity in the 1880s, cytogenetics is the area of genetics which has been most widely adopted in clinics. After having been canonized in the 70s, the cytogenetic analysis has been used for diagnosing foetal or childhood anomalies and the neoplastic disease of blood or marrow bone, and, currently, few esoteric clinical laboratory disciplines have the potential to affect such a broad range of medical specialists, from obstetricians-gynaecologists to paediatricians, from perinatologists to oncologists, just to name the most important ones. During process of its dissemination, routinization and standardization, differences have surfaced, especially in a context marked by fragmentation such as the Italian health service. Different from other artefacts, scientific techniques and technologies are never standardized once and for all, but are always affected by the contingent relationship between design features (how the devices are produced, tested, manufactured and commercialized) and social constituencies which take part in this process (Jordan and Lynch 1998). The "procedural flexibility" of all of these techniques, implies "the material design and embodied enactment of the protocols used and disseminated in particular disciplines, establishments and industries" (Jordan and Lynch 1998: 784). The "procedural flexibility" has to do with, for example, the selection of alternative materials and instruments, precautionary steps, the scale and repetitiveness of operations, the accuracy of the measurements and so forth. This is particularly true for long, articulated, and poorly automated cytogenetics methods, the flexibility of which is neatly reflected in guidelines and scientific handbooks. They constitute a corpus that, differently from the cutting-edge scientific literature, is not aimed at dissociating scientific objects from the uncertainties and contingencies of their production, but rather at limiting the inherent practical differences within the compass of scientific legitimacy (see below paragraph 6). Cytogeneticists have to work with methods, which produce largely unpredictable, indefinite or even misleading results, frequently resulting in laboratory artefacts. In other words, it is impossible to establish a priori the objectivity of the results obtained. The results can only be evaluated contextually, through a process that retrospectively assesses the practical meaning of the course of action that has produced these very results. This is a troublesome situation for biologists and, thus, they devise strategies to rid their representations of any indeterminacy or any additional features in order to achieve reliable final results. This tension between the world of representations, and the world of embodied practices, poses the practical Springer</page><page sequence="5">Continuous Grey Scales Versus Sharp Contrasts 5 question of "uncertainty" (Roth 2009; for uncertainty in the field of cytogenetics see also Turrini 2010). Its resolution requires local and contingent strategies to be devised, which then consolidate and stratify in scientific traditions and conventions from which the styles of representation emerge. Usually these traditions are closely associated with the lab chiefs. Since the clinical laboratories were widely introduced in Italian hospitals in the 1960s and 70s, the directors are usually the same individuals who founded and established a given laboratory, recruited the personnel, selected the equipment and so forth. Any director, in turn, came from one of the handful of Italian genetic centres, from which they adopted specific protocols and techniques. From this point of view, Italian cytogenetics is a particularly interesting case study because these traditions are particularly marked in its organizational system. Firstly, in Italian labs, biologists are usually also employed in operations that in other contexts are carried out by lab technicians. In Italy, geneticists are required to do the complete analysis of chromosomes, regularly follow and check all the steps of sample processing and, in some cases, carry out the whole procedure of preparing the sample for observation under the microscope. Secondly, the different ways of doing the same things have been particularly kept alive by the great national fragmentation of cytogenetics laboratories.2 In the last 10 years an important standardization effort has emerged from one of the most important schools of cytogenetics and, yet, it has met with difficulties in being accepted by other labs. Marked by stratified and consolidated divisions, the Italian situation is ideal for investigating the stylistic differences in representing chromosomes. Undocile Chromosomes To put it simply, the characteristic chromosomes complement of human beings is a sort of alphabet of 24 "ideograms"3 corresponding to the 22 pairs of so-called "homologous" chromosomes (indicated by the numbers 1 through 22), plus the 2 "sexual" chromosomes (indicated by X and Y). In practice, "reading" chromo- somes means counting them and analysing their morphology. The width, brightness and the arrangement of the stripes - "bands" according to the laboratory vernacular - constitute the specific appearance by which each chromosome can be recognized and analyzed. The etymological meaning of "coloured bodies," from the fusion of the Greek chroma and soma , was given due to the strongly stain achieved by particular dyes that renders them observable with a low degree of magnification. In order to be "read," chromosomes need to be "written" through a long, complex procedure, whose passages emphasize the differences among them. Like letters written by different hands, pens and inks, they are unique with regard to their shape, 2 To understand this situation two factors need to be considered: on the one hand, the general fragmentation of the national health service which has only recently been centralized and, on the other, even though Italy has less than 60 million inhabitants, Italians have a notable propension for prenatal diagnosis, and different areas are affected by the so-called Mediterranean anemia (Sardinia, Po Delta). 3 Curiosly, «ideogram» is the term adopted in cytogenetics to refer to the ideal model of chromosomes. The metaphorical meaning of this scientific expression demonstrates that the analogy with letters was first developed by scientists themselves. Ô Springer</page><page sequence="6">6 M. Turrini dimensions, nuances, colour, and contrasts. On the one hand, their normal number and morphology is a biological constant for individuals of the same species (apart from sex difference), and, on the other, their appearances are different each time. Notwithstanding that they are always the same 24 (aberrations apart, of course), chromosomes assume mutable shape, dye intensity and number of bands each time, even homologous ones of the same cells usually differ from each other, as is shown for example in the pairs of homologous chromosomes of the karyotype in Fig. 1 . Although there is no scientific explanation of this phenomenon, both the scientific literature on clinical cytogenetics - articles and handbooks - and practi- tioners' opinions are quite uniform in justifying it. Firstly, chromosomes have dynamic structures that are widely varied throughout the whole cell cycle. During "interphase," they are almost invisible, while during "mitosis," the stage of cellular duplication and division, they become linear, large bodies easily observable through the microscope. Secondly, the process through which a specimen is prepared for microscopic viewing is long, complex and affected by many variables, including slight variations in environmental conditions. The influence of temperature and humidity on chromosomes has been scientifically demonstrated since 1996 (Spurbeck et al. 1996), but there is not yet a consensus on a procedure able to produce regularly standardized chromosomes. Chromosomes are not docile, but rather undisciplined scientific objects; as cytogeneticists used to say, each chromosome reacts in an individual and unpredictable way. Even if "classical" cytogenetics, as the term says, is a established discipline, its objects of analysis do not behave according to a programme of normalization through which they become visible and reportable. Practically, the chromosomes that belong to the same individual contain the same genetic information (except in the very rare case of mosaicism, i.e., the presence of multiple genetic codes in the same individual) but assume different shapes and coloration each time. For this reason, each sample is checked many times and procedures are continuously adjusted according to their partial results in order to obtain "good" chromosomes. As Lynch (1990) observes, obtaining mathematically tractable visual materials from events, bio-sample and so forth, is not an automatic nor easy process, but is the final result of "selection" and "mathematization". These preparatory procedures involve several steps, among which, filtering, uniforming, upgrading and defining, that are aimed at turning the object of investigation into a "docile object"; fit to be studied according to the established methods. Contrasting cytogenetic ideograms (Fig. 2) and the wide range of the chromosome 1 (Fig. 3), shows clearly the huge divergence between ideal models and what cytogeneticists are used to observing through microscope, between what they call "figures" and "reality". We have figures [the ideograms], but reality is very, very different from them. They [chromosomes] are always different because they are not stiff, right? They are DNA, which vary according to the spreading of metaphase. When, for example, a chromosome hurts with another one, all their bands will be slightly squeezed. ^ Springer</page><page sequence="7">Continuous Grey Scales Versus Sharp Contrasts 7 Fig. 1 A metaphase spread "captured" on the computer screen (picture taken from a cytogenetics laboratory by the author) This quotation, which is drawn from an in-depth interview with the chair of the genetics laboratory of a public hospital, clearly demonstrates the practical matter at the heart of the cytogenetics laboratory work: since chromosomes are malleable, flexible and easily influenced by a number of factors, and procedures are long and unstable, there is a wide gap between abstract models and laboratory preparations. â Springer</page><page sequence="8">8 M. Turrini Fig. 2 These are the ideograms of chromosome 1, stained by Geisha and with three different resolutions, which are respectively around 400 bands (on the left), 550 bands (in the middle), and 850 bands (on the right) ( Source : David Adler, University of Washington - Department of Pathology) When represented on ideograms, shapes are perfectly linear, colour contrasts are sharp and "bands" are glossy and neat, while at the microscope they never are. Chromosomal variations pose a serious threat to cytogeneticists, especially for those who, carrying out prenatal diagnosis, are not allowed to reject the worst specimens, since usually there is not enough time to repeat the withdrawal of amniotic fluid. The bad quality of chromosomes particularly complicates the morphological analysis aimed at identifying chromosomal mutations that usually ô Springer</page><page sequence="9">Continuous Grey Scales Versus Sharp Contrasts 9 Fig. 3 This table, representative of the haplotype chromosome 1, shows how the same chromosome can be presented to the microscope of scientists representing a range of different chromosomes belonging to different individuals and degree of resolution {Source: laboratory document reproduced with kind permission) consist in slight variations of chromosomal arrangements. A supernumerary chromosome, such like trisomy 21, is easily identifiable. However, there are many other smaller anomalies that can result from deleted, duplicated, inverted inner parts of chromosomes that can be translocated in another chromosomes or broken off. While the former aberrations immediately attract the cytogeneticisťs expert eye, the latter ones are very difficult to catch, and it takes great effort to distinguish them from other aberrations that do not yet have clinical significance. Indeed, any slight variation in number, dimensions and stain intensity from the ideal model of normality represented by ideograms may correspond either to genetic anomalies or to laboratory artefacts without any medical meaning. The slightest chromosomal aberrations are usually published in scientific journals and are arrayed on office walls and in the hallways of laboratory facilities. â Springer</page><page sequence="10">10 M. Turrini Moreover, actual chromosomes frequently fall between the three different resolutions of banding provided by the international system for human cytogenetics nomenclature. In other words, among chromosomes of the same cell or even in different areas of the same chromosome it is possible to find different degrees of resolution. Even if guidelines issued by the geneticists' community recommend specific scores as the lowest standard acceptable for a given reason for referral in clinical analysis, this assessment is often neglected or approximately evaluated. Table 1 shows the interesting and innovative diagram provided by the American Association for Clinical Cytogenetics (2007) for precisely assessing the banding score. The same logic for the criteria of definition demonstrates the profound instability of banding resolution. The category conditions are not necessarily insufficient, but conditional; that is, at least three of the four criteria have to be obtained to fulfil the requirements of a banding score.4 The paradox of cytogenetics visualization is that chromosomes visualized quite easily, but the practical circumstances of their observability rely upon the mediation of instruments, and the specific form of biologists' actions that can produce blurry shapes, indeterminacies and also artificial anomalies. These are the ""intrusions" and "distortions" in the observability of the "natural" features of the world, which derive from instrumental conditions of their perceptions" (Lynch 1985a: 82). They are generally considered artefacts , which etymologically means "products with skill" (ars faceré), but in technical, scientific and medical usage artefacts refers to unintentional, artificial effects produced by technological and practical mediation that are not inherent to the objects observed. In order to have truthful representations of nature, scientists devise plural strategies, able to rid them of any artefactual features of known or unknown origin. In so doing, they reflexively produce artefacts' accounts of the "unwitting work," which is hidden behind scientific productions situated within the practical circumstances of laboratory inquiry. In Italy, these heterogeneous strategies to optimize chromosomal representations are particularly marked, principally due to the specificities of Italian cytogenetics laboratories, which are high in number and rather isolated to each other. Rather than truthful representations, they search for specific styles of visualizing chromosomes, which mobilize the whole procedure of chromosomes' preparation - or "process- ing" according to the vernacular of the laboratory. Thus, styles are practical ways to solve what Roth (2009) has defined the question of "uncertainty," i.e., the 4 It is important to point out that resistance to the normalization of chromosomes is reflected historically in the very process of construction of ideal models, the ideograms, which arose through three international conferences held in the 1960s and 1970s. Three models were developed for representing the final results for each chromosome, based on differing clinical necessities. These differences depend firstly on the tissue on which the analysis is carried out. Paediatric tests of mental retardation, that are carried out on the blood of the patient need the highest definition - the ideogram on the right - , while the lowest definition - the ideogram on the left - is sufficient for prenatal diagnosis, which analyze tissues like amniotic fluid and chorionic villi coming from the borderly areas between the pregnant woman and the foetus. The kind of technique matters too. If chorionic villi, for example, are analyzed with «the direct preparation», a banding score of as much as 300 is necessary, while analysis of «cultures» need at least a 400 bands resolution. Finally, resolution requirements depend on whether the case is at risk or not. For routine amniotic fluid and CV culture preparations 400 are an adequate number of bands, while referrals associated with abnormal ultrasound scan require a 550 resolution (the ideogram in the middle). â Springer</page><page sequence="11">Continuous Grey Scales Versus Sharp Contrasts 1 1 Table 1 "G-banding evaluation score: at least three of the criteria to be obtained to apply banding scores 3-9" (ACC 2007, 5) 0 No banding 1 Identification of some chromosomes by morphology and major landmarks 2 Poor Unequivocal identification of chromosomes due to major landmarks &lt;300 band 3 2 bands on 8p (8pl2 &amp; 8p22) 300 band 3 bands on lOq (10q21, 10q23, 10q25) 20pl2 visible 22ql2 distinct 4 Moderate 3 bands on mid-4q (q22-28) 400 band 3 bands mid-5q (5ql4, 5q21, 5q23) 2 bands on 9p (9p2 1 &amp; 9p23) 13q33 distinct 5 7q33 &amp; 7q35 distinct 500 band 3 bands on 1 lp (1 lpl2, 1 lpl4, 1 lpl5.4) 14q32.2 distinct 4 bands on 18q (18ql2.1, 18ql2.3, 1 8q2 1 .2, 18q22) 6 Good 5q3 1 .2 distinct 550 band 8p2 1 .2 visible 2 bands on 1 lpter (1 lpl5.2 &amp; 1 lpl5.4) 22ql3.2 distinct 7 2p25.2 700 band 2q37.2 distinct 10q21.1 and 1 0q2 1 .3 resolve 17q22-q24 resolves into 3 bands 8 Excellent 4pl5.31 &amp;4pl5.33 distinct 850 band 5pl5.32 distinct 1 lq24. 1 and llq24.3 distinct 19pl3.12 and 19pl3.2 distinct 9 1 1 pl4. 1 visible 900 band 20pl2. 1 &amp; 20pl2.3 distinct 22ql 1.22 distinct 22ql3.32 distinct 10 Banding resolution higher than level 9 with additional bands to those seen at the 900 bphs level (ISCN 2005) [31 seen consistently on both homologues The enlisted criteria are not sufficient conditions, but rather approximate indications of the effective level of resolution of a karyotype. Moreover, the subtle difference between "distinct" and "visible" is to be noted impossibility to know ex ante the result of a given process of production of scientific knowledge. In this case, moreover, the unpredictability of chromosome morphology merges with another practical problem: the weak correspondence between coding schemes and slides. The convergence between actions and outcomes, thus, is the final and contingent product of a continuous procedural adjustment consistent to the Springer</page><page sequence="12">12 M. Turrini ways in which chromosomes are read. Cytogenetics protocols provide a common framework, but they need to be manoeuvred in ways that differ from laboratory to laboratory in order to obtain slides of a good quality. There are probably as many variations in any steps of chromosomes preparation as there are cytogenetics laboratory. Creative stratagems have to do with how the bio-sample is squashed (i.e., made to fall) onto the slide - the angle of the drops, the distance and so forth. Further stratagems are introduced when in situ processing is used, a method in which spreading of chromosomes is accomplished solely by the manner in which the cultures are dried. Regulating the humidity environment with ordinary humidifiers, or putting the slides under lamps, is just one of the easier examples. During my ethnographic experience, I myself waved a piece of paper about a metre above some slides that were drying. In any case, no variation (even the most scientific ones which come from prestigious scientific medical centres) is considered safe in itself, and any innovation must be validated before it is definitely introduced. Moreover, in the case a variation in technique is adopted, the laboratory must document it in order to compare the past techniques to the present. All variations of procedures are archived in several notebooks, one for each technique, which are the repository of the laboratory "local tradition". Differences arising from evaluation of the same objects, protocols, reagents, devices and any other procedural modifica- tions, are not arbitrary, but are logical and consistent with the whole procedure of preparation and reading of chromosomes. What makes cytogenetics such an interesting field to study is the close intertwining between the world of representations and the world of embodied practices. How to prepare or "process" chromosomes indicates how to represent them. In other words, the changing sameness of chromosomal morphology is reflected in the changing sameness of cytogenetics procedures. Here we analysize the different strategies that pursuing the same goal as two different but persistent styles. Selection as Codification: Aesthetics and Epistemology in Arresting Cell Cycles As classical articles by Goodwin (1994, 1995) demonstrate, attributing mathemat- ical order to natural objects is not an automatic nor an easy process, but is the final result of the "codification" and "selection," namely a complex negotiation between coding schemes and the world which involves theories, artefacts and bodies of expertise. In the case of cytogenetics, it is as if reality were codified, highlighted and represented at the same time. Coding schemes are used not before but next to in order to highlight certain characteristics of chromosomes. In other words, codification is consistent with the way to read or, in Goodwin's terms, to "represent" them. It is possible to distinguish the different styles of representing chromosomes at any step of the laboratory procedure, which, from the biochemical processation of samples to microscopy observation, lasts from 48 h to over 20 days. The phases in which styles emerge more clearly are the intermediary steps used to select and check (partial) cellular preparations. Each group of samples are ^ Springer</page><page sequence="13">Continuous Grey Scales Versus Sharp Contrasts 13 monitored in order to adjust the procedural variables according to the morphological features present at each time. Selection and codification in this case are intimately correlated, in that preparation of an object for mathematical operations includes and builds upon the practice of selecting which cells are closer to the ideograms. In cytogenetics, the two processes inextricably merge together in the initial phase of "mitotic arrest," which practically consists in choosing the best cells of a specimen to focus on. The judging criteria, which emerge during the first, general "reading" of the "slides," are functional to the selection of the most appropriate cells, or "metaphases," to be analyzed. As the following passage of an in-depth interview with an experienced geneticist (15 years) shows, aesthetic judgements are an important aspect of cytogenetics practices. Some cytogeneticists have gained a reputation for their "nice" karyotypes. . . . you should see the same analysis carried out by three different people: they all will choose three different metaphases. Well, if there is a terrific metaphase, maybe that one will be chosen by all three people... but if you put three metaphases under the scrutiny of three people, they surely won't agree on what is the most beautiful metaphase. It is a matter of... aesthetics ! They have the impression that: "Yes, this is the most beautiful, this is less beautiful and the last one is still worst". [...] Well, if the same analysis is carried out by three people, you can be sure that you won't find the same metaphases. Here [in this laboratory ], for example, there are people who, like in any other laboratory, import [select] karyotypes that are uglier than those chosen by other people. If you look at the pictures of Lessichelli,5 for example, you'll immediately realize that there is a world of difference between them and those of Sandra. The acquisition or "capture" of the metaphases to analyze plays a crucial role in the process of representing chromosomes. However, this process is informed by plural and divergent criteria. The meaning of the term "aesthetics" seems to introduce a crucial feature of representative styles: the subjective preferences according to which appearances of chromosomes are evaluated. The lack of standard criteria does not mean that arrangements of intensity and form are made simply to "please the eye". The concept of aesthetics is here used in an ancient sense: rather than meaning an imaginative transfiguration of reality, it stands for "a crafting of natural resemblances; an "art" which is practised as a mere technique with "aesthetic" pretension (in the modern sense)" (Lynch and Edgerton 1988: 214). In the context of the laboratory routine work, aesthetic judgements have a practical utility in that they orient the course of actions. They are a source of "reflexivity" (Garfinkel 1967; Lynch 2000) through which cytogeneticists prospec- tively and retrospectively produce courses of action which are recognizably ordered, accountable, normal and natural. In an ordinary situation, it is as though the 5 The names given here, and those which follow, are invented in order to guarantee the privacy of both the workplaces and the professionals observed during the ethnography. &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="14">14 M. Turrini complex of theories, techniques, and instruments involved in disclosing such entities are transitively invisible, as a clear pane of glass is unnoticed by the gaze that sees through it. The visual representations are the intersubjective sites for the discussions and arguments that produce and negotiate the local order. "Which is the best slide?," "This is (really) bad on its own!," "I don't like it very much, could you do it again?" are some of the most frequent expressions of individual opinion which cytogeneticists use to confront each other regarding the quality of a slide, to question the obtained results and the adopted procedure. Agreeing, or disagreeing, with the aesthetic assessments reorientate the work of technicians and colleagues. Therefore, through this process cytogeneticists elaborate their aesthetic judgements, whose concrete effects reverberate throughout the process. The steps of check and control are particularly subject to this process of evaluation and debate, such as in procedural variants such as "mitotic arrest," also colloquially called "blocking of cultures". Once isolated, specimen cells are "seeded" into a culture dish (a flask or a Petri dish), immersed in specific growth media, and maintained at an appropriate temperature with a gas mixture provided by an artificial environment in order to reactivate their biological cycle. After that cells are made to grow and reproduce themselves in vitro, their growth is blocked, or "arrested," by means of treatment with a specific reagent, colchicines, when a good number of cells are in metaphases and chromosomes visibility is optimal. Choosing the best moment to arrest cell cultures is a very delicate decision that affects the way cells are represented. Not by chance, the decision is always make by either the lab director or a geneticist of her/his trust. An expert eye quite easily recognizes when cells are in metaphase. Yet, this situation is further complicated because cells, when cultured artificially, are not homogeneously distributed, but tend to cluster themselves in small, dense areas and, furthermore, do not grow synchronically, but each cell is in a different phase of cell cycle. Although there are a number of variables to consider, with a degree of approximation, it is possible to identify two main techniques. When cell cultures are arrested after a short time, the cells will be less in number and smaller in dimensions than those obtained after a more prolonged time. Conversely, the cells obtained will be increased in number and larger. I come from Saint Mary Hospital where we used to arrest clones when they were still small. I've always adopted this method and the quality of my metaphases is good, and definitely better than that which you see here for amnios. I also did block amniotic fluids when Arminia was off, and I obtained smaller clones and, if you check them, even if they are not like great balls, metaphases are nicer and, thus, even for that, you see that here we have bad habits. And this is one of these because, for example, making three cells grow in order to have two smaller clones, it doesn't make sense. This quotation comes from an in-depth semi-structured interview with a young and expert career biologist who will be called Antonella here, who works in a big, private laboratory of one of the most prestigious national clinics specialized in prenatal medicine of Northern Italy. During her interview on work practices, all of a â Springer</page><page sequence="15">Continuous Grey Scales Versus Sharp Contrasts 15 sudden she started to vehemently criticize the way of blocking cultures of one of her colleagues who we will call Arminia, an older biologist in charge of the section of amniocentesis. Antonella does not hold a specific role, but is the assistant of the lab director, who is in charge of the most delicate area, that of chorionic villi. This friction makes perfectly clear the technical, epistemological and professional meanings attributed to the different styles of arresting cell cycles. Blocking cell cultures earlier represent chromosomes as smaller than these found in the more "swelled" metaphases which are arrested later. The rivalry between two important colleagues of a very large and important laboratory clearly shows a divergence inherent in the way chromosomes are visualized. Despite the criticism towards Arminia' s method, Antonella does not consider it as an error, or an individual counterproductive preference, but rather as a way of operating which is determined by a distinctive collective tradition. As Daston and Galison (2007: 367) write: [t]he differences that provoke mutual outrage may split along the lines of generation, discipline, or research group. But they are never merely idiosyncratic, one personal style clashing with another. There are no purely private values, any more that there are purely private languages. The professional rivalry between the rising career of Antonella and the scientific responsibility of Arminia are expressed through the divergent strategies of representing chromosomes. Theses strategies, in turn, are not to be traced to personal preferences but rather to a coherent, distinct style of representation, which at the same time entails what to visualize and how to view it. The distinct strategies of visualizing and viewing specific objects are the final outcomes of an articulated and stratified process of negotiation among biologists, aesthetics, procedures, reagents, laboratory devices and so forth. Banding and the Link Between Visualization and Vision Another phase of monitoring laboratory preparations is the staining of slides or "banding" which immediately precedes their observation under microscope. Banding is the vernacular expression for the colouration of the stripes that characterize any single chromosome and make their structure visible. Being the last possibility to create "nice slides," it is a crucial step which involves many options and variables, among which, the kind of dyes, the solution of reagents, the regulation of time and some more picturesque tricks of the trade such like " flambage " (the exposure to the blue, noisy flame of a Bunsen burner, a special alcohol lab burner). This step thus provides an interesting occasion to see how procedural divergences are recognized by scientific literature, in that all these strategies have been the object of varying research oriented at explaining what affects chromosome appearance, and how to render them uniform according to scientific standards. Adopting a descriptive approach instead of a normative one, scientific-professional guidelines and handbooks of clinical cytogenetics aim not at standardizing procedures, but rather, at drawing a line that distinguishes what is admissible from what is forbidden without suggesting the best option. Guidelines Springer</page><page sequence="16">16 M. Turrini approve a wide range of laboratory methods which leave a wide space for manoeuvring, modification and interpretation (see, for example, Sigu 2007, the guidelines of the Italian Society of Human Genetics). Similarly, handbooks, even if they describe with greater details the diverse procedures in use and the implications of practical divergences, cover all the multiple strategies that can be adopted in the cytogenetics laboratory. For example, one of the most authoritative handbooks of clinical cytogenetics, when discussing the slide preparation, points out to the effects determined by varying each one of the following aspects: "harvesting method [...], the humidity and temperature of the laboratory or drying chamber utilized [...], the number of fixations and the method of fixing the specimen, the slide temperature, wet or dry slide, how much water, the angle of the slide during specimen application, the method of applying the specimen, the method of drying the slide, the slide-aging technique" (Watson and Gersen 2005: 98). The recognition of these variables does not lead to universal rules, but rather to an aesthetic, practical awareness of how to shape and stain chromosomes. Coming back to chromosomes staining and banding, it is interesting that the same manual reports many variables (Watson and Gersen 2005: 11) that adjust the intensity of banding, and then establishes two parameters in evident contrast with one another for the evaluation of chromosome quality: • A wide range in mid-gray intensity. • Dark bands in close proximity appear as distinct bands (Watson and Gersen 2005: 99). These two opposing principles encompass a wide range of options on which the stylistic research and preferences of the cytogeneticists are built. There is a tension between, on the one hand, the clarity of contrasts and the clear definition of boundaries between the bands, and, on the other, the richness of the range of nuances. As specified after a few lines, it is necessary to use your own subjective judgement in order to balance these two tendencies. Individual taste will also play an important factor in identifying a staining intensity that is well suited for microscope analysis. (Watson and Gersen 2005: 99, Italics added) Individual taste, therefore, is shaped through balancing between two opposite formal qualities, the richness of the range of "greys" and the sharpness of contrasts. A highly contrasted chiaroscuro has to be measured against a rich greyness, whose gradation contains a great amount of data that, however, can hinder the reading. The difficulty here is that the "signal" and the "noise" are closely intertwined and when you consolidate signal or subtract noise, you will irremediably loose some data. On the one hand, indeterminacy , which is synonymous with fully preserving the complexities (and uncertainties) of reality and, in particular, of any slight variation of shape and colour which distinguishes any single chromosome, and, on the other hand, the brightness , which is equivalent to the simplification and clarity of data, are balanced differently by any single cytogeneticist according to the way she/he reads chromosomes and solves its inherent uncertainties. â Springer</page><page sequence="17">Continuous Grey Scales Versus Sharp Contrasts 17 Does the Microscope Have "the Last Word"? Techniques and Instruments of Visualization It is possible to consider all the activities involved in representing chromosomes as a distributed cognitive phenomenon in relation not only to the phase of processa- tion - i.e. the preparation of slide we have analyzed so far - but also to the phase of observation under microscope. The latter is a silent, ineffable practice carried out between the microscope and the observer. Yet, it cannot be reduced to the individual realms, in that it mobilizes technological equipment, discourses and bodies of expertise that play an active role in reading slides. As previously suggested, the real chromosomes produced in vitro look very different from the geometrical models of ideograms. The poor quality of their bands is due not only to fuzzy contrasts, but also to their number, which is usually less than that of the ideal models, and does not correspond to that of the three ideal models, but differs from one chromosome to another. Highlighting the bands that matter for cytogenetics analysis is a procedure which involves several perceptual fields, such as a metaphase captured under microscope, a karyotype displayed on the computer monitor, and posters of ideograms which are usually arrayed on the wall nearby microscopes. The combination of these perceptual fields are not only carried out mentally, in the brains of scientists, but they are also juxtaposed with spoken and written texts, through the comments and inscriptions of the partial results, and some printed digital pictures. Sometimes, when computers are not available, cytogeneticists draw a schematic sketch of the metaphase to archive. Moreover, the very manner of seeing is connected to the way chromosomes are visualized during the processation. Therefore, it is clear that the techniques of observation of chromosomes implies assembling a wide range of elements which, in turn, feeds back to the way chromosomes have been represented. To simplify, we can see two major techniques of reading chromosomes - "the comparison among homologous" and "the count band by band" ( conta banda a banda) - which correspond to the styles of representation we have seen so far. The comparison among homologous (which, in case of "normality," should be all the same) consists of comparing the same areas of homologous chromosomes belonging to diverse metaphases. The following quotation from an ethnographic interview with a young and expert cytogeneticist exemplifies clearly how this technique works. ... if you see a small difference, which perhaps has no meaning, then you'll feel the need to compare more metaphases in order to decide whether it is something to take into consideration or not. Because metaphases are all slightly different from each other. There are some chromosomes that have particularly stretched long arms, others which have particularly stretched small arms, and that's why I need to scrutinise several chromosomes before deciding whether a chromosome is normal. Even if I see a good metaphase, and maybe it seems to me that it is ok, afterwards I look at another cell and then it is almost mathematical that I think: "Well, this tiny arm does not seem &lt;0 Springer</page><page sequence="18">18 M. Turrini very good to me ..." . And then I have to find a third cell to look at. For me it is automatic to work like that. This strategy is based on the observation of a continuous grey scale where some anomalies in intensity or dimension can be discovered easier than in the boundaries between adjacent bands. The areas of greyness, even if contain more "noise," can also have more information. . . . the analysis is carried out on greys. Whites and blacks do not matter so much, they mean clearness of bands, while the greyness means indeterminacy but also precision. In order to analyze the bands , what is important are the nuances. This laboratory director clearly explains that the multiple gradations between adjacent stripes are considered the regions with the greater density of data. A particularly vivid brightness, the stretching of a band, the accentuation of a narrowness are just some instances of "suspicions," i.e., clues of anomalies, of a potential genetic anomaly, and they are frequently used to orient the analysis towards specific areas of interest. The greyish zones, where the shapes are indistinct and unclear, are mostly subjected to chromatic and morphological variations. In the majority of cases, the latter ones are mere artefacts, but deserve to be deeply evaluated through comparison of the homologous chromosomes belonging to other cells. Practically, all suspicions are written down in an informal log that is used as a personal reminder of all the doubts that emerged during the chromosomes' analysis. Aside from this log, there is an official work document which contains a brief alphanumerical description, according to the most recent international nomenclature (see Shaffer et al. 2009) of any cell which has been analyzed - its number depends on the presence of potential anomalies, but it has to be, in any case, at least of 16 metaphases for prenatal diagnosis according to the guidelines of the Italian Society of Human Genetics (Sigu 2007). This file, along with some pictures of the "prettiest" metaphases, constitutes the record to be kept on archive to prove the quality and correctness of analysis. Apposed to this orderly and clean document in A4 format, the informal log of doubts and suspicions, which is thrown away as soon as the analysis is completed, is usually a smaller piece of paper and full of a great number of messily spread codes, almost unintelligible to an outside eye. The signs usually adopted combine international nomenclature symbols and formulas elaborated personally or loaned by colleagues, and usually consist of abbreviations of anthropomorphic metaphorical expressions, such as "ears," "feet" or "breast," which stand for the particular chromosomal regions where there are suspicions of anomalies. During an ethnographic interview carried out in her workplace, an experienced cytogeneticist who was approximately 40, with several publications published in important international journals of human genetics, explained to me some of the codes I noticed in her "suspicions" work paper. Below is reported what she said about "sh," an abbreviation which stands for "shoulder". I don't know whether "shoulder" is a technical term or not, but I use it to point out the area just below the centromere. This is a highly variable region and, look at this one [pointing to a chromosome on the monitor ], I don't like its shoulder much. They slope too much. Ô Springer</page><page sequence="19">Continuous Grey Scales Versus Sharp Contrasts 19 All the suspicions need to be solved through corroborations or denials, verifications or rejections. Practically, all clues to anomalies are gathered in what is here called the suspicions paper, and then are crossed-out (if discarded) or underlined (if validated) according to the analysis of the results of chromosomes belonging to other cells. Generally, the deviations from the norm are only potential anomalies, artefacts that are not even mentioned in the final record. However, in providing the necessary suggestions to follow the trail of anomalies, they are like a compass for a ship in that they orient the analytical scrutiny towards some specific areas where different metaphases and chromosomes are compared to one another. In other words, the suspicions of an anomaly have the function of directing attention to strategic areas on which "the comparison among homologous" method is focused. Diametrically opposed, the technique of "the count band by band" method is based on one essential assumption: identify single bands of the ideograms. This style of analysis has recently been encouraged and vigorously stimulated, at least in Italy, by a national programme of standardization and automization aimed at promoting, to use their own words, a paradigmatic shift "from magic to a techno- scientific approach". It is an articulated proposal of change for the organization of laboratory practices, directed at eliminating all the uncertainties that impede the procedures of chromosomes preparation. This programme, which is based on equipment originally designed for the cytogenetics laboratory, has the scope of developing a specific strategy for reading chromosomes. The following passage, which is taken from a speech delivered by one of its most prominent promoters during an intensive course for a limited group of eight professionals working in this area, clearly shows that this programme intends to address the scientific gaze toward a specific features of chromosomes. You have to shift from a broad vision of the karyotype to a band by band analysis in order to avoid neglecting any possible anomaly. If you have a good metaphase, it is enough, and, in the case there are some overlaps, you can search a second one, just to be cautious. From a single metaphase we can generate a full karyotype and the quality of the analysis should be defined as a detailed analysis band by band, chromosome by chromosome. Stylistic divergences in representing chromosomes are polemically used here in order to introduce an innovative way to carry out cytogenetics analysis. The promoters of this programme of standardization emphasize the quality of homogenisation, which, even if it is basically realized by innovative protocols and devices designed to reform the cytogenetics laboratory, in the end sides with a specific style of visualization. Counting band by band is presented as the only authentic scientific observation able to produce objective data. Despite their argumentative focus on scientific quality, what they are really discussing is a new specific way of directing visual attention to the boundaries of adjacent bands, rather than continuous grey scales. The comparison among homologous method, which is utilizes the intuitiveness of the first, immediate glance, lends to a continuously shifting gaze of the different perceptual fields of the same chromosomal areas, inducing the generation of a metaphorical language for the description of chromosomal regions and tending to privilege the most nuanced cells. The "count â Springer</page><page sequence="20">20 M. Turrini band by band" method is more of an analytical vision of chromosomes, directing visual attention to the division between blacks and whites and the comparison of few, pretty metaphases to ideal-types. The divergences inherent in the styles of representation do not exclude each other rigidly, but, to the contrary, are usually merged together. It is quite usual that cytogeneticists who mainly adopt the count band by band method also make use of the comparison among homologous method, and those who adopt the comparison among homologous method try to detect all the bands in a nice pretty chromosome. Yet, there is a deep divergence between these two ways of viewing which concern both the selection of where the analysis is carried out and, consequently, the typical manner in which chromosomes are represented. This quotation from an in-depth interview by an experienced cytogeneticist in his 50s, offers a succinct and clear description of this divergence: [...] to obtain a good contrast between whites and blacks, we usually turn out to have bands of a poorer quality. . . if I see only whites and blacks I cannot see the nuances. Styles of representation are thus two different ways to organize the externalized retina, namely, to construct the intelligibility of the same objects in all of the steps of representation of chromosomes; from processation procedures of biosamples to the observation of chromosomes. The part played by the two means of visualization that are currently present in the cytogenetics laboratory is particularly important: the microscope and the computerized imaging system. Since the end of the 1980s new computer-assisted imaging systems have been introduced alongside the microscope in every cytogenetics laboratory. They were adopted first and foremost to replace the traditional method for keeping record of karyotypes, photomicrography, which is still used in some labs. An ordinary 35 mm camera is attached through an adapter to a microscope, pictures are taken, the film (that is usually a B/W) is developed and printed in a darkroom, and then the chromosomes are cut and arranged to form a karyotype (see Fig. 1 for an example of a "digital" karyotype). With digital platforms all these operations are carried out in a few minutes by importing images on computer through a special microscope scanner. The microscopist can easily cut and paste chromosomes and print the final karyotype. While photography and related imaging techniques were far from inflexible in their ability to selectively expose relevant details and were used just for archive images, digital images enable the constituent "element" of a picture to be directly handled at the computer console. Moreover, these systems may improve the quality of images through background elimination, contrast and colour enhancement (see Gee 2001). In this sense, digital platforms have provided not only a technological alternative to photography for producing archive images, but also a perceptual field alternative to the microscope. On-screen analysis has increasingly replaced traditional analysis carried out through the microscope. Indeed, the digital analyzer is reputed to have numerous advantages in that image processing enables greater dynamic range for representing chiaroscuro, enhancement of signal-noise contrast and superimposition of chromosomes taken from other metaphases. In the last decade, a wide range of software packages, such as CytoVision®, have been Ö Springer</page><page sequence="21">Continuous Grey Scales Versus Sharp Contrasts 21 developed to enhance the visibility and analyzability of chromosomes and, nowadays, they are endowed with many rendering functions directed at regulating the brightness and contrasts of chromosomes, or at straightening their shape. The digital system of visualization has thus become a fundamental part of laboratory equipment and, yet, has also been vehemently criticized. There is a widespread view that the digital platform, being a technology that tends to simplify and to flatten6 images, is a potential source of distortions and artefacts. Seen on the monitor, chromosomes can take the shape that you want, because contrasts can be remade, chromosomes can be magnified,7 bands can be increased, but they are in a way falsified. Through the microscope, instead, they appear as they really are. Perhaps they are more confused, but they more faithful to reality [...]. For example, through the microscope, focusing in and out, I can see all I want to see. Also because when I find some crossings [overlapping of chromo- somes ], especially in fluorescence, bands are nuanced and there is a whole grey scale, and for me it is very important to have all nuances to decide whether a chromosome is normal or not... While software can process and transform the same image (the raw one), with the risk of producing "artificial" (in the sense of artefactual) shapes and colour intensity, with the microscope it is possible to obtain many images of the same metaphase by focusing in and out. This practice, which can be done only using an optical instrument, enables the emphasis of the three-dimensionality of chromo- somes (which, like sticks, have a cylindrical form) giving a depth which static, digital images cannot achieve - it is common to consider digital images flatter than what is possible through the microscope. The diffidence towards digital systems is not a traditionalist sentiment against technological innovation, but rather focuses on different ways of rendering and viewing chromosomal images and corresponds to a different aesthetical preference. It seems to me that, when you straighten chromosomes, their bands are modified. They are all prettier but, in my opinion, some bands are reduced and others enlarged. I never do it. [...] Actually, these chromosomes are more photogenic [laughs]. They are glossy [patinati] chromosomes, but they don't convince me. It is interesting to note that the use of digital instruments in the context of the cytogenetics laboratory is usually likened to Photoshop manipulation. Processing colours, enhancing chiaroscuros, retouching shapes enables one to have impres- sively beautiful pictures which, however, are usually "considered artificial". In the end, stylistic divergences are once again reflected in the aesthetic preferences and 6 The digital image is considered flattened due to both the depth of field of the microscope, which is considered higher, and the possibility to focus in and out on chromosomes in order to emphasize their tridimensionality. 7 While the magnifications of a microscope are fixed, in that they depend on the available optics, software can zoom in and out on the pictures imported on computer. â Springer</page><page sequence="22">22 M. Turrini practical modalities of the usage of visualization equipment. The kinds and the extent of use of computerized imaging systems is a choice taken according to a precise style of representation - so, for example, while many use computers just to import the images to be stored in the archive, many others think that "where quality is not excellent, [it is necessary] to achieve a good metaphase with a computer," or "it's better to enhance the colours a bit," or to "give greater brightness" to better the visualization of chromosomes. These discrepancies become very normative controversies during uncertain sit- uations: in which perceptual field do their uncertainties need to be solved? In other words, which instrument has the last word? One answer is that "readings have to be carried out at the microscope" and that, in uncertain cases, "the microscope always has the last word". The following extract from an in-depth interview develops this position by means of a critique, which this experienced cytogeneticist poses to a younger colleague, who will be called Camilla here. If you look at Camilla, for example, she uses the digital analyzer a lot. She imports everything onto the computer and then she does on-screen analysis. For her, images displayed on a monitor have the last word: when she has uncertainties, she solves them on the PC and never on the slide. She prefers it like that because on-screen chromosomes can be clearer and bigger and their bands are more distinct than through the microscope. Maybe I'm old- fashioned, but I am attached to the microscope. For others, using digital image processing is a way to consolidate their analysis, in case there are indistinct and blurry chromosomes. In some cases when I did not have a good result with the banding, we were then able to achieve an excellent metaphase by means of manipulating the contrasts. In these cases, there are many bands but there is too much quinacrine or something else so you can't see clearly. However, digital equipment allows you to work on the raw image, and, when you have the raw image, you can do what you want, you can put some more colour, you can enhance the bands. In this situation, according to this cytogeneticist (who is a strong supporter of the count band by band method), the digital practice is used to provide a substantial increase in the resolution of the metaphases. Stylistic preference is reflected in the grammar of observation. In some labs, for example, the scientific director is the only one who holds the right to manipulate images and to revise analysis carried out at the microscope. In others, the primacy of the microscope over the computer, according to which "reading must be done at microscope" or "it is the microscope which has the last word," is set as a general rule for all lab practitioners. Conclusions: The Divergent Grammars of Cognitive Practices This paper shows that within a single discipline there are many different ways to visualize and to view the same object. Far from tracking these specificities back to â Springer</page><page sequence="23">Continuous Grey Scales Versus Sharp Contrasts 23 the process of the "interiorization" of abstract rules, it attempts to open up the "black box" of procedural knowledge and to highlight the social and material processes which constitute it and which are produced collectively. Scientific representational practices are tied to the eyes of the scientist, who, however, has to be attuned to a broader instrumental and practical configuration. As the concept of externalized retina suggests, the activities of the anatomical retina are enhanced with procedures, instruments, material, and scientific objects that provide the graphical and instrumental fields upon which the scientific image is impressed and circulate. In cytogenetics this phenomenon is particularly evident in the tension between the world of representation and the world of practices that requires an artful elaboration and modification of local strategies, among which different styles are recognizable. We have seen how a specific modality of culturing cells corresponds to the usage of visual instruments, to different techniques for making observations and to a different evaluation of the aesthetic quality of chromosomes. These divergent grammars of representation are also to be intended as sociological analytical strategies that explore the divergences and contingencies in the ways objective data is obtained. Our analysis resonates with Daston and Galison's (1992, 2007) historical reconstruction of the distinct codes for scientific observation, in which objectivity is no longer defined as the only approach for observing nature, but just one a kind of scientific sight of recent innovation. Their detailed historical depiction of scientific views of nature - "truth-to-nature," "objectivity," and "trained judgement" - is useful in deconstructing objectivity as the unique legitimately scientific way of seeing nature and, thus, to introduce the topic of plurality in the realm of scientific visualization. The representational styles discussed here reflect the idea that "a plurality of visions of knowledge, understood in the most capricious sense of fidelity to nature, is likely to be a permanent aspect of science" (Daston and Galison 2007: 371). Objectivity, then, is to be understood not as an ontological attribute, but rather as a product of the complex interaction among practices, bodily expertise, equipment, and scientific objects. Examining this case study provides us the possibility to appreciate in detail how these different approaches, accumulating and modifying each other, configure the complex texture of practice, instrumental mediation, epistemic virtues, and expertise which are involved in scientific representation of chromosomes. The concept of style can be seen as a way to articulate the concept of "epistemic virtue" outside an internalised scientific self through an aesthetic, analytical, instrumental, and ontological preference in the way to carry out the analysis, as shown in the following table. Aesthetical Methodical Instrumental Ontological Nuances Comparative Microscope Complexity Sharp boundaries Analytical Comp, imaging system Ideal models Style is, therefore, sort of a compass used to orient our understanding to the complex technological mediation in representing human genetic code. It underlines the complex interaction between the scientific practice and a wide range of elements â Springer</page><page sequence="24">24 M. Turrini directed at achieving objective results. On the one hand, an aesthetic preference for nuances means fostering a method based on comparison, a preference for the microscope and, in general, trying to emphasize the complexity of chromosomes. On the other hand, privileging chromosomes with sharp bands implicates assuming a more analytical scientific eye and searching for the perfect ideal-typical chromosome also through the rendering functions provided by digital imaging systems. Even though the representational styles are alternatingly used and sometimes conflicting, they share an analogous tendency to articulate the process of data production. The fact that a faithful representation of nature can be obtained by either style should not be understood as a critique of the heuristic capacity of science, but rather as a way to emphasize the richness, plurality and capacity inherent in the different ways to produce and see the same scientific object.
