<plain_text><page sequence="1">HANBALISM IN EGYPT BEFORE THE MAMLUKS In two fundamental articles outlining the history of the I.Ianball movement in the Muslim world, Henri Laoust paid almost no attention to the IIanball presence in Egypt prior to the end of the Aiyibid dynasty in 647/1249. (1) This is not at all surprising. Indeed, late medieval Egyptian writers themselves give the impression that there were either no Ijanballs in Egypt before that date, or they were of no conse- quence. For example, al-Udfuwl (d. 748/1347), in his bio- graphical dictionary of noteworthy Muslims from Upper Egypt, most of whom died during the two centuries before the author's death, does not specifically mention a single I.anball. (2) (1) "Le Hanbalisme sous le califat de Bagdad (241/855-656/1258)," R.E.I., 27 (1959), 67-128, which devotes about two pages to Egypt, and "Le Hanbalisme sous les Mamlouks Bahrides (658/784-1260/1382)," R.E.I., 28 (1960), 1-71, which of course concerns the post-Aiyibid period. In his article, "HIandbila," E.I.2, III, 158-62, he also did not touch upon the Hanbalts in Egypt before Mamltk times. Thse works, moreover, far supersede Ignaz Goldziher's "Zur Geschichte der hanbalitischen Bewegungen," ZDMG, 62 (1908), 1-28. For a recent overview of I.Ianbalism and its study, see George Makdisi, "L'Islam Hanbalisant," R.E.I., 42 (1974), 211-44, and 43 (1975), 45-76.

The name of a I.anbalt who taught law (flqh) to one of al-Udfuwl's personalities and did visit Upper Egypt is found on p. 603. He died in the early 8thf14th century, see Ibn Rajab, Kitdb al-Dhail 'ald Tabaqdit al-handibila, ed. Muhammad II.mid al-Fiqi, 2 vols.

LEISER In his remarks on the law schools (madhhabs) in Egypt, al- Maqrizi (d. 845/1442) simply says that little was heard of the I.Ianbalis until the end of the Aiycibid period.(1) Of the same opinion is al-SuycitI (d. 911/1505) who states that the IHanballs were very few in Egypt and that he had no word of them until the 7th/13th century. In his list of famous Egyptian I.Ianbali jurists, the earliest died in 623/1226. (2) Although it would appear that the I.Ianbalis were either absent or of virtually no importance in Egypt in the centuries before the coming of the Mamlfiks, this was not the case. In the following brief study, we shall try to shed some light on their activities in Egypt during those centuries. When did the first I.Ianbalis arrive in Egypt? There is no doubt that they began to trickle into the Nile Valley shortly after the death of their namesake, Ahmad b. I.Ianbal, in Baghdad in 241/855. In fact, many who had studied under him reached Egypt while he was still alive. However, the JHanball madhhab only came into being, in the formal sense, in the century after 241/855. It is difficult to determine, therefore, the extent to which such early arrivals were "I.Hanbalis." After all, none other than Muhammad b. Idris al-Shifi'i (d. 204/820) knew Ibn I.HIanbal and studied tradition (hadith) from him. Because of this, Ibn AbI Ya'lA included 362-64. This could mean that the aforesaid personality was a Ianbali, although he is not found in any of the Hanbalt biographical dictionaries. It is possible that some of the law teachers of other people in al-Udfuwi's book were H.anbalis which would suggest that their students were of the same school (madhhab). The author, though, seems to have done his best to provide the school of everyone in his dictionary. He knew personally many of those for whom no madhab is given which may indicate that madhhab affiliation was not especially important for people in Upper Egypt. A .Ianbali who was a student of another personality in the book and who died in Cairo in 711/1312 is mentioned in passing on p. 173. There is no evidence that this student was ever in Upper Egypt, see Ibn Rajab, al-Dhail, II, 362-64. See also al-Udfuwt, p. 613.

(1) Al-Shfi't, of course, died in Egypt after his third trip there and his followers eventually established their own school which would far outshine IHanbalism in that country. The renowned Egyptian Sift Dhh 'l-Nin (d. 245/859) was apparently associated with Ibn IHanbal in Baghdad as a result of their common opposition to Mu'tazilism. (2) But here again, we would not consider him to be a I.anbali. In Ibn Abi Ya'ld's biographical work, most of the I;Ianbalis who went to Egypt or returned there from Baghdad and died in the 3rd/9th century are described as either having studied hadith from Ibn IHanbal or from his followers. The others simply happened to meet him. The earliest of these I.anbalts to have studied tradition from him and to have fully identified himself with the master was Ahmad b. Silih al-Misri. His father was from Tabiristin, but he was born in Egypt in 170/ 786-87 and died in that country in 248/863. After completing his studies with Ibn Ijanbal, he spent the rest of his life in Egypt where he taught hadith and became a highly respected traditionist. (3) Al-Dhahabi reports that he was also accom- phished in grammar and law (fiqh). (4) It is reasonable to assume that in the latter subject he was greatly influenced by Ibn I.Ianbal. If so, this might mark the period of the first tentative steps of full-fledged .anbalism in Egypt. As for the other .Hanbalts in Egypt during this century, all we can say is that they seem to have confined their activities to teaching hadifth, above all on the authority of Ibn IIanbal, (1) Tabaqdt al-handibila, ed.

(1) Still, one could definitely conclude that, by the end of the 3rd/9th century, the IjHanbalis were to be found in Egypt and were spreading the teachings of Ibn JHanbal. Their number, however, was extremely small -Ibn AbI Ya'lA gives barely a dozen-and their madhhab was far from well organized much less a challenge to the others. Our school experienced little, if any, substantial growth in the course of the next two centuries. Ibn Abi Ya'lA mentions a journey to Egypt in the biographies of only three people who died during this time, all in the 4th/10th century. The first was the Sfift Yisuf b. al-Husain b. 'All from Raiy who studied tradition from Ibn Hanbal and then went to Egypt to become a disciple of Dhhi 'l-Nin. He died in 304/916-17 and may not even have passed his last years in Egypt. (2) The other two, also from Iran, died in 310/923 and 395/1004-05 and both went to Egypt to study hadith. (3) Laoust points out that the traditionist Abf 'l-Q~sim Sulaimtn b. Ahmad al-Tabar~nt, who wrote several important works on Hanbalism and had a significant influence on his contem- poraries, visited Egypt. He was born in Tiberius in 260/873 and died in Isbah~n in 360/971. (4) Not only are the biographical works virtually silent for this time, but the major Egyptian chronicles are also of little help. In fact, they lack almost any reference to I.Iabanlis whatsoever. (5) The reason for this is not difficult to find. (1) On these other IHIanballs, see Ibn Abi Ya'1A, Tabaqdt al-handbila, I, 22, 117-18, 150, 179, 198-99 who studied hadith from Ahmad b. SAlih, 216-17, 223 (?), 229 (?), 235, 263(?), 269, 269-70, 307-08, 337-39. All of the above can be found in al-Khattb al-Baghdidi, Ta'rikh Baghddd, from which Ibn AbI Ya'lA took much of his information, except for the entries on pp. 223 and 229, see indices.

But at the same time, they had to contend with the Biyids who, as Shi'ts, were their inverterate enemies. In short, the IIanbalts had their hands full at home. Moreover, the F.timids established themselves in Cairo in 358/969 and for the next 100 years were at the height of their power. As Sh'cts, they too repre- sented an obstacle to the spread of I.anbalism in the Muslim world, above all in Egypt. Curiously enough, there is to be found in Ibn Jlajar al-'Asqal~nI's book on the judges (qddis) of Egypt the biography of a chief q.di, Abc 'Abb~s b. Muhammad b. 'Abd Allah b. Abi 'l-'Awwim, described as a IHanbali who died in 418/1027. (1) We are told that he was born in Egypt in 349/960-61 and, despite the fact that he was not a Shft', the F.timid Caliph al-.;Ikim appointed him chief judge of Egypt in 405/1015 because he was loyal, trustworthy, well-qualified, and had an excellent knowledge of the country. In this position, he had jurisdiction over all the F.timid territories from the Maghrib and Sicily to the IHij~z. This post, which he retained until his death, enabled him to acquire considerable wealth. He was held in high regard by both al-I.Hkim and his successor, al-Z~hir. Needless to say, it seems rather peculiar that the F.timids would give such a major position to a I.anbalt or that a .HanbalI would take it under such circumstances. The only indication that Abi 'Abb~s was a IHanbali is at the end of his name where we read "al-faqih al-h.anbali." He is not found in any of the I.anbali biographical dictionaries which al-Maqrtzt, Ilti'dz al-hunafd' bi-akhbdr al-a'imma al-fd.itimiyyin al-khulafd', eds. JamMl al-Din al-ShayyMl et al., 3 vols.

I would like to thank Dr. J. Dennis Hyde for checking the MS for me.</page><page sequence="6">160 G. LEISER is surprising for such an important person. Moreover, in Ibn IHajar's account of him, he states that he wrote a book in praise of Abi IHanifa and his followers, not Ibn I.Ianbal. The same writer provides the biography of a son of a paternal uncle of Abc 'Abbas who was also a chief qddi, but a Hanafi. (1) Indeed, Abc 'Abbis is included in Ibn Abi 'l-Wafi"s biographies of famous Hanafis. (2) It is, consequently, virtually certain that our friend was a IHanafi and not a IHanbali; the two words could easily be confused by a copiest. (3) Throughout the period in question, the overwhelming majority of the Sunni population of Egypt was dominated by the Sh~fifis and Milikis. The Hanafis were a distant third and the I.Ianbalis had yet to make an impact. There is no reason to doubt that there were at least some I.Ianbalis in Egypt in the 5th/1l th century, but they have left few traces. (4) In 447/1061, the Saljiks under Tughril Beg put an end to the Biyids and officially restored Sunnism to Iraq. At that point, the I.Ianbalis entered their golden age which lasted for two centuries. The Saljiks also greatly reduced the F.timid lands in Syria and deprived them of their authority over the I.ijiz. This greatly facilitated the I.anbali freedom of movement. By the late 5th/llth century, they were firmly established in Damascus as personified by Abc 'l-Faraj al-ShirAzi (d. 486/1094). Al-ShirAzi was not only an active writer but also a vigorous opponent of Ash'arism. (5) As we shall see, it was not be long before the IHanbali-Ash'ari quarrel broke out in Egypt.

(1) By the end of the 5th/llth century, Syria, and to a lesser extent the I.ijiz, could serve as bases for the spread of I.anbalism to Egypt. Meanwhile, with the reign of al-Mustansir (427-87/1036-94), the F.imids began their long decline towards extinction at home as well as abroad. Egypt suffered from several famines, factionalism within the army, and other disturbances which finally required the introduction of outside forces to re-establish order. When the dust settled, the caliph found himself ruler in little more than name. The country was henceforth under the control of vizirs only two of whom were members of the F&amp;.imid's religious following, the Ism~'ili Shl'is. The rest were ImAmi Sh'is (Twelvers), Sunnis, and one was a Christian. Under these conditions, the Sunni community began to reassert itself. It would, in fact, absorb or overcome most vestiges of Sh.'ism before Saladin finally abolished the Ftimid dynasty in 567/1171. It is not surprising, therefore, that the .Hanbalis appear in the sources in relatively higher numbers around the turn of the 5th/11th century. One of those sources of particular interest is Abi T~hir Ahmad b. Muhammad al-Silafi (d. 576/1180). He arrived in the Nile Valley from the East in 511/1117 and remained there the rest of his life. He was Egypt's most outstanding traditionist of the 6th/12th century and was given the professorship of a madrasa in Alexandria, one of the first in the country. Although a Shfi'I, he attracted students from all Sunni madhhabs. Among his works is a book entitled Mu'jam al-safar. This is a personal biographical dictionary of all the teachers and some of the students he had had or met. The work is devoted to those he knew in Egypt, and above all in Alexandria.

LEISER Al-Silaft was primarily interested in listing the chain of authorities for various hadith or the teachers of his teachers and thus furnishes few details about the personalities them- selves. He frequently does not even mention a person's law school which makes his Mu'jam somewhat frustrating to use. Nevertheless, we do learn that he encountered a number of IHanballs. One of them, Abfi 'l-Barakit Y~sin b. Ibr~him al-Maqdisi, fled to Egypt after Syria was invaded by the Crusaders. And there were surely others like him. (1) Another .Hanbali acquaintance of al-Silafit was Ja'far b. Ahmad al-Sarr~j. He was born, apparently in Baghdid, at the end of 417 or the beginning or 418, corresponding to 1026. He was an ascetic and devoted much time to fiqh, but was chiefly known as a teacher of the readings of the Qur'An (a muqri') and as a traditionist. He studied hadith in Baghdad from many authorities, especially Abi 'All b. Sh4dhMn (d. 426/ 1034). (2) He made the pilgrimage to Mecca, where he continued his tradition studies, and then did the same in Damascus and Tripoli before going to Egypt. There, he doubtless taught hadith besides studying it from AbQ IsIhq al-.Habbl (d. 482/1089-90) and Abi Muhammad b. al-Darrib. (3) Ibn al-Sarrij spent some time in Sidon and at last returned to Baghdad where he died in 500/1107. (4) It is possible that al-Silaft knew him in Iraq rather than in Egypt.

(2) As a young boy, Abc Bakr studied fiqh from Abc Ya'ld. Later, he served as a professional witness for the chief judge of Baghdad, Abc 'l-IHasan b. al-D~mghint (d. 513/1119). (3) Otherwise, he went on to work in mathematics and hadith. He had as teachers most of the important traditionists of Baghdad, including some of the same teachers as Ibn al-Sarr~j. And like Ibn al-Sarr~j, he went to Mecca to pursue the same subject and to Egypt where he studied under Abii IsIhq al-IHabbl. It was perhaps while on his way to Egypt that he was captured by the Byzantines who placed him in fetters for a year and a half. They tried to force him to convert to Christianity, but he refused. He was able to take advantage of his imprisonment to learn Greek (al-khall al-rami). A number of anecdotes were told of him and he was well remembered in Egypt after he had returned to Baghdad. He died in that city in 535/1141 and was buried near the tomb of the renowned SLft Bishr al-IIht. (4) Another I.anbalt who occupied himself with hadith in Egypt was the jurist and muqri' 'Abd al-RahmAn b. al-Nafts al-Ghiyath, known as al-A'azz al-Baghdidt.

He set out for Syria in 542/1147-48 and lived for a time in Damascus and served as the prayer leader (imdm) of the IIanballs in the Umaiyad Mosque.

LEISER where he spent the rest of his life as a traditionist and teacher of the Qur'An and fiqh. He died in 560/1164-65. (1) Also a IHanbalI of interest was the jurist and ascetic 'Uthmin b. Marziq al-Qurashi. His origin is obscure. We know that he went to Egypt via Damascus or possibly the .Hijiz. In Mecca, he was supposed to have met the famous Hanbali theologian and Sfi :'Abd al-Qfdir al-Jilini (d. 561/1166) and the noted Andalusian mystic Abi Madyan (d. 594/1197) who jointly bestowed upon him the khirqa or Sifi robe. In Damascus, he was a close friend of 'Abd al-Q2dir's son, 'Abd al-Wahhib (d. 593/1197). (2) At any rate, Ibn Marzfiq settled in Egypt where he spent the rest of his days. He served as a giver of legal opinions (mufti), taught fiqh, and entered into disputations. But above all, he had a great reputation as a mystic. According to Ibn Rajab, "He was the top man in the education of Sifi novices in Egypt." Large numbers of pious Muslims sought him out and vied for his company. Indeed, he was esteemed by all classes of society. Much of his fame unquestionably derived from the miracles attributed to him. Once, the Nile flooded much more than usual and the country was on the verge of a devastating inundation which would prevent the planting of crops at the proper time. There was a great public clamor for Ibn Marzfiq to alleviate the situation. So, he went to a bank of the Nile and made his ablutions in the water at which point the river immediately receded from the land. Several years later, the Nile failed to rise and again the crops were endangered. Just as before, the people called for Ibn Marzfiq who went to the river and made his ablutions, this time from a jug carried by his servant, and the Nile rose the same day.

Our friend died in 564/1168-69 and his grave, east of al-Shfi't's tomb, became an object of veneration. (1) By the time of Ibn Marziq's death, .Hanbalism was well entrenched in Egypt. It was still, however, far from command- ing the allegiance of a large proportion of the Sunni population. Thus, when the F.timid Vizir Kutaif~t appointed, for the first time in Egypt, four chief qdis in 565/1130-31 (a short- lived experiment), it was not deemed necessary to appoint a IHanaft much less a .Hanbalt; the posts went to an IsmA'ili, ImimI, Shhfi', and a MilikI. (2) But the .Hanbalis would soon begin to arouse more attention, primarily because of their noisy protests against their old antagonists, the Ash'arts. Perhaps the earliest reference to the preaching of Ash'arism as an issue in Egypt is found in Ibn Muyassar. He states that the Ftimid Vizir Ma'mfin b. al-Bat'ihi (d. 522/1128), a Shi'i, closed the institution of higher learning called the D~r al-.Hikma because a man named IHamid b. al-ItfihI, who attracted a large following there, espoused Ash'arism and "then gave up Islam altogether." (3) The trouble between the IHanbalis and Ash'arts, who were usually Shhfi'ts, built up during the last decades of F~timid rule and finally burst into violence. One of the most militant, and rather obnoxious, Ash'ari Shfi'is was Najm al-Din al-K.habishhni (d. 587/1191). He arrived in Egypt in 565/ 1169-70 and rapidly became dreaded by Sunni and Shi'I alike. Among his exploits was the exhumation of Abi 'Abd Allah b. Muh.ammad b. al-KIz~ni, a fellow Shhfi'I. Although respected as a poet, Ibn al-KIz~nI's fame rests on his alleged anthropo- morphism (tashbih) which brought him many followers. Because of this, many Sunnis, especially Ash'aris, attacked him for spreading innovations (bid'a). Ibn al-KiiznI died 1) Ibid., I, 306-11.

Nevertheless, when al- Khabish~inI learned of this, he could not contain himself and dug up Ibn al-Kfz~ni while shouting, "A siddiq (righteous man) and a zindiq (unbeliever) should not be (buried) in the same place", and threw his bones and the bones of his followers in all directions. Al-Dhahabl tells us that the I.HIanbalts (who accepted the anthropomorphic passages in the Qur'An at face value) immediately "attacked him and rallied against him and there occured between them warlike attacks and riots. (')" The connection, though, between Ibn al-KLz~nI and the I;anbalis is not as clear as it would seem. It is reported by Ibn Rajab that there was a riot (fitna) in Egypt between the followers of Ibn al-Kizini and Ibn Marziq. The latter had stated that the activities of men were uncreated or pre-existant (af'dl al-'ubbdd qadima), whereas, the former declared that they were not. The supporters of each then clashed in the street. In order to solve the problem, it was agreed to write to the scholars ('ulamd') of Baghdad for a ruling in this dispute. The scholars issued opinions (falwds) according to their different ideologies saying one of the two beliefs was an innovation. Ibn Marzfiq's son Sa'd was not satisfied with this and, therefore, decided to go to Baghdad himself to get an answer. Before he could return, however, his father died and he resolved to remain in the 'Abbisid capital. (2) The I;Ianballs, then, identified themselves with Ibn al-KIzini only within certain limits, but were prepared to fight for that identity. The year of Ibn Marzfq's death, 564/1169, was also the year in which Shhrkfih finally conquered Egypt and very briefly served as the F.imid vizir.

Ibn Rajab relates that this man was 'Izz al-DIn 'Abd al-H~dI, one of the sons of 'Abd al-Wahh~ b b. 'Abd al-Wihid al-ShirizI whom we met as the founder of the first IHanball madrasa in Damascus. Although 'Abd al-HedI is depicted as a jurist, preacher, and fanatical Sunnl, he seems to have been primarily a soldier and well-known for feats of strength. On one occasion, he struck a Frankish knight with such a blow that he cut through the backs of both the knight and his horse. Another time, he picked up a large stone covering the well of the Umaiyad Mosque, walked around with it, and then put it back. But most important for our purposes, he began the construction of a madrasa in Egypt, apparently in Fus.t, which would have been the first for the I.anballs in that country had 'Abd al-Hedi not died before it could be completed. (1) No I.anbalt madrasa would go into operation in Egypt until 641/1243-44 as the Aiycbid dynasty neared its end. Indeed, the Aiyibids, who were Shhfi'ts, did little to encourage the I.anbalts compared with the other Sunni madhhabs. Al- Maqrizl informs us that Saladin was, in fact, a proponent of Ash'arism and stipulated that it be the ideology taught in all of his madrasas, including one for the MMlikIs and one for the ;Ianafts, and even in the Sifi "convent" (_hhdnqdh) of Sa'cd al-Su'adA' which he founded. (2) One of the few inscrip- tions to survive from any of the madrasas in Egypt prior to the Mamlhks is from the al-SalM.iiyya which Saladin built in 575/1180. The al-Sal.hiyya was for the ShRfi'ts and was probably the largest madrasa in Egypt throughout our period. The surviving inscription states that it was constructed for Ash'art jurists. It also states that al-KhabishinI had urged (1) Ibn Rajab, al-Dhail, I, 370, no death date given; Laoust, "Le Hanbalisme... califat," p. 126; Leiser, "Restoration," pp. 293-94.

(') He furthermore became its first professor (mudarris). The Aiyibids in Egypt officially turned a deaf ear to the I.anbalts until the reign of al-Malik al-Slih Najm al-Din (637-47/1240-49) when they could no longer be ignored. Al-Malik al-Kimil (d. 635/1238), for instance, who was a fairly serious advocate of Ash'arism, sharply berated his brother al-Malik al-Ashraf MtsA for leaning toward the JIanbalis in Syria. (2) Official disavowal, however, did not mean there was no lack of unofficial cooperation. This is best revealed in the career of 'Ali b. Ibrihtm b. NajA, the son-in-law of Sa'd al-Khair. He was born in Damascus in 508/1114-15 and was a nephew of Abe 'l-Faraj al-Shirzi, perhaps the leading IHanbalt shaikh of Syria in his time whom we met above. Ibn NajA went to Baghdad where he studied hadi~th from Abci 'l-.Hasan Sa'd al-Khair b. Muhammad al-Andalusi and others. He married Sa'd al-_hair's daughter FAtima, who became the most outstanding female teacher of hadith in Egypt in the 6th/12th century. Ibn Naji also taught tradition in Baghdad and preached in its Mosque of al-Mansir. We know too that he met there 'Abd al-Qidir al-Jilini. He went on to teach hadith in Damascus, but Nfir al-Din sent him back to Baghdad as an ambassador in 564/1168-69. Ibn Naji went to Egypt just before Saladin founded his own dynasty and was held in high regard by the Sultan. Moreover, he was the one who warned Saladin of an attempt to restore the F.timid Caliphate by 'Umbra al-Yamani and his co-conspirators. As a result, Saladin was able to nip the coup in the bud and our I.Ianbali friend became a confidant of the Sultan and his sons. He was with Saladin in 583/1187 when he captured Jerusalem and preached there on the first Friday afterwards. In Egypt he taught hadith in Alexandria and Fustfit.

Still, he seems to have been a poor man when he died in 599/ 1202. (1) Ibn Naji's friendship with Saladin was not affected by his dispute with the Ash'art Shihib al-Din Muhammad b. Ma1hmid al-Tfsi (d. 596/1200). Coming from the East, the latter settled in Egypt in 579/1183-84 when Saladin's nephew Taqi 'l-Din 'Umar b. Shfhinshih was serving as regent in Cairo. Al-Tfisi resided briefly in the Kh~inqih of Sa'id al-Su'adA' before Taqi 'l-Din appointed him professor of the Shlfi'I Man~izil al-'Izz Madrasa in Fust.t which he had recently founded. In 580/1184, four months after this appointment, riots broke out between the Hanbalts and Ash'aris. The Hanballs were incensed over al-Tcsi's preaching and teaching of rationalist theology (kaldm). Taqi 'l-Din apparently assuaged the I.anbalts by "setting up chairs for the preaching of both groups and allowing each to debate their position." (2) Ibn NajA had rapidly become an enemy of al-Tist and was probably involved in the aforesaid riots. One day while Ibn NajA was sitting in a mosque in the al-Qarifa Cemetery, part of the ceiling fell on him and the people nearby. At the time this happened, Shih~ib al-Din was delivering the Friday sermon (khu.ba). To make matters worse, a dog passed in front of the congregation. Ibn Naj&amp; then remarked, "This comes from there," and pointed to Shihib al-Din. (3) Despite the lack of encouragement from the Aiyibids, the fact that the F.timids had been eliminated made it easier for the I.anbalis to enter Egypt and increase their activities in that country. Consequently, the later part of the 6th/12th and the first part of the 7th/13th centuries saw a rapid rise in the number of .anballs in Egypt.

LEISER al-Qawl al-Mundhirt (d. 656/1258), upon whom Ibn Rajab relied for much of his material on IHanballs in Egypt. Al-Mundhiri was born in Fust.t in 581/1185. He began to study tradition as early as 591/1195 from the IHanball Abfi 'Abd Allah al-Art.hi (see below). Our friend was originally a I;Ianball and most of his first teachers were of that madhhab. His home was near the mosque (masjid) of the Vizir Ibn al-Furit in Fust~t which seems to have been a Hanbalt center. (1) Its imam, Mahmid b. 'Abd Allah al-MasIst al-Misrt (d. 594/1198), taught al-MundhhirI the Qur'An as well as tradition. (2) He also attended classes there on hadith given by the IHanbali 'Abd al-Ghani b. 'Abd al-W.hid al-Maqdisi (see below). Afterwards, al-Mundhirl became the student of eAli b. al- Mufa;dal (d. 611/1214), the mudarris of the MilikI al-.Shibiyya Madrasa in Cairo. Ibn al-Mufad&lt;dal advised him to leave the IHanbalIs for Ash'arism and helped him to become the imam of the al-.Shibiyya. Al-Mundhirl no doubt leaned towards the Milikis for a while, but in the end he became a SEhhfi'f. The circumstances under which this change took place are unknown. He was an ambitious man and the hope of advance- ment cannot be ruled out as the reason he joined the Shhfi'es. After all, Egypt was ruled by a Shjfi'i dynasty and al-Mundhiri was eventually placed in charge of the D~r al-.Iadith al- K~miliyya established in Cairo by al-Malik al-KImil in 622/ 1225.

(1) Mulhammad was born in 528/1133-34 and spent his early years in the East studying hadith in such places as Hamadhn and Baghdad. He went to Egypt before going to Mecca, where he became the leading IHanbalt and died in 590/1193-94. (2) Another was I.Hammed b. Hibat Allah al-IHarr~nI described as a merchant, traveler, traditionist, and historian. He was born in .arrin in 511/1117 and later went to Baghdad, Harit, and Egypt to study hadith. In Baghdad, he studied that subject from Sa'id b. al-Banna', the grandson of the great IHanbalt jurist, (8) and in Egypt from al-Silaft and Ibn Rifi'a al-Sa'dI (d. 616/1219). (4) I;Iammed also taught hadith in all the places he visited. He wrote a history of I.arrin which he apparently never finished and which unfortunately has not come to light for it would be of great importance for the history of I;Ianbalism in Syria and surely in Egypt as well. He died in his home town in 598/1202. (6) One family of I.anbalts which was particularly prominent was that of the traditionist and ascetic Taqi 'l-DIn 'Abd al-Ghanl b. 'Abd al-W.hid al-JammA'eli al-Maqdisl. 'Abd al-Ghant himself was born in the town of Jamm'il near N~bulus sometime between 541/1146-47 and 544/1149-50.

Qudfma, who had been born in the same town about the same time. Indeed, 'Abd al-Ghani married Ibn Qudima's sister. In the event, the two men remained in the 'Abbhsid capital for four years. 'Abd al-Ghant concentrated on hadith and Ibn Qud~ma on fiqh. Most important, they both joined the circle of 'Abd al-Q~dir al-Jilini who supervised their work. Unfortunately for them, 'Abd al-Qidir died some forty days after they had met him. They then studied together with other leading scholars in Baghdid and even entered into disputations before they returned to Damascus. In 566/1170-71, around the time of the abolition of the F.timid Caliphate, 'Abd al-Ghani journeyed to Fust.t and Alexandria. After a brief visit, he went back to Damascus and then returned to Alexandria in 570/1174-75 and studied tradition from al-Silafi. He pursued the same subject from Ibn Barri (d. 582/1187) (1) and others in Fust.t before again going back to Damascus. From there he set out to study hadith in Isbahin, Hamadhn, and Mawsil. However, he once more returned to Damascus where he devoted himself to teaching and writing, often in the Umaiyad Mosque. Although he acquired a reputation as an outstanding tradi- tionist, a strict Sunni, and a man capable of performing miracles,(2) he made many enemies among the jurists of Damascus because of his outspoken support of the doctrines of the reality of the attributes of God and the uncreatedness of the Qur'An. Consequently, he was denounced and the jurists and judges held a special meeting in which they declared it legally permissable to put him to death. But several amirs interceded on his behalf with the Sultan, apparently Saladin, and he was banished to Egypt. Initially, he made a good impression on the Muslims in his new home, but it was not long before he made himself unwel- (1) H. Fleisch, "Ibn Barrt," E.I.', III, 733.

The Shhfi'Is, M~likis, and Hanafis accused him of corrupting the beliefs of the people, of being an innovator, and an outright unbeliever. The fact that he was also a friend of Ibn NajA probably did not help him. Furthermore, 'Abd al-Ghani's testy personality certainly added to his ideolo- gical problems. On one occasion, in Damascus under the rule of Saladin's son al-Afdal (d. 622/1225), he went on a rampage breaking musical instruments. In Egypt, his activities or simply his presence must have contributed to the atmosphere in which al-'Aziz (d. 595/1198), another of Saladin's sons and his successor in Cairo, contemplated expelling the IHanbalis from the country. Later, he criticized al-'Aziz' eventual successor, al-Malik al-'~dil (d. 615/1218), more than once to his face and that Sultan clearly dreaded him. Al-'~dil was, therefore, sympathetic to the protests of 'Abd al-Ghani's enemies, some of whom were supposed to have offered 5,000 dinnrs to anyone who would kill him. Our .Ianbali was briefly placed under house arrest and was about to be exiled to the Maghrib when he died in 600/1203 and was buried opposite the tomb of Ibn Marziq. (1) We know of three of 'Abd al-Ghani's sons. The first was AbQ 'l-Fath Muhammad who was born in Damascus in 566/ 1170-71. He presumably accompanied his father on his travels. Ibn Rajab states that he studied tradition in Damascus and went to Baghdad in 580/1184-85 for the same purpose. This must have been when 'Abd al-Ghani made his second trip east for he was reported in Isbahin after 590/ 1193-94. He studied hadith in Egypt from al-B.siri (d. 598/ 1201) (2) and others, but it is difficult to determine how much time he spent there. He was a close friend of al-'Adil's son, al-Mu'azzam, which would indicate that he was less contro- versial than his father. He died in Damascus in 613/1217.

He was born in 581/1185-86 and is described as going with Abi 'l-Fath to Baghdad and Isbahin which would mean he was born in Damascus and was a very small child on this journey. Nevertheless, he supposedly studied tradition in these cities and later in Damascus, where he took up fiqh with Ibn Qud~ma, and in Egypt. In the latter, he was a student of Fatima bint Sa'd al-Khair and Abi 'Abd Allah al-Arthi. He made a second trip to Iraq where he studied under Ibn al-Jawzi. He continued his tradition studies in Irbil, Mawsil, W~sit, Nisbibr, and in the .Hijiz. He taught the same subject in Damascus and Egypt. When the Crusaders embarked upon their campaign against Damietta in the years 615-18/1218-21, Abit MeisA joined the fight to drive them out. Later, al-Malik al-Ashraf, another of al-'Adil's sons, built a ddr al-hadtth in Damascus and appointed Abt Meis to its teaching chair (masgyajhha), but he died in 629/1232 before the building was completed. (1) The youngest brother was Abi Sulaimin 'Abd al-Rahmin, an ascetic and jurist. He was born in 583 or 584/1187-88. He studied tradition in Damascus and did some traveling which brought him to Egypt to pursue that subject from al-Bcsiri, Abci 'Abd Allah al-ArtfhI, and IsmF'il b. Yfsin (d. 596/1200).

He was in charge of Qur'An reading in the Mosque of 'Amr in Fustit and in the madrasa of al-Sadid the doctor which overlooked the Nile.

Ahlmad was born in 574/ 1178-79 and studied hadith from Abfi 'Abd Allah al-ArtihI (who, Ibn Rajab says, was his grandfather), al-Bisiri, Ibn Y~sin, Ibn Naji, and 'Abd al-Ghani al-Maqdisi to whom he attached himself. Still, he gained fame expressly as a muqri' and held his father's position in the Mosque of 'Amr. He passed away in Egypt in 659/1261. (5) A final family that we should mention was that of the great scholar Ibn Qud~ma himself. Although there is no evidence that he ever visited Egypt, he unquestionably had a significant (1) Al-HIusaint, Silat, fol. 139a; Ibn Rajab, al-Dhail, II, 276-77; al-Safadt, al-Wdft bi-'l-Wafaydt, Ahmet III MS. 2920 (microfilm, Penn), XVIII, fol. 89a.

LEISER impact on the IHanbalis there simply because of his writing and his students who found their way to that country. (1) Furthermore, he did have relatives who went to Egypt apart from the immediate family of ~Abd al-Ghani. The most important was probably his brother, Abi 'Umar Muhammad. He was born in Jamm'il in 528/1133-34. He went with his family to Damascus in 551/1156-57 after they had been victi- mized by the Crusaders in their native town. They resided for about two years in the masjid of Abc .Slih (2) and then moved to nearby Mount Qfsyin where they established a kind of Hanbalt retreat (dair). In Damascus, Abi 'Umar studied hadih from his father, from Abci 'l-Fath 'Umar b. 'Ali b. I.ammiya (d. 636/1239), a mudarris from an important political family in Egypt, (3) and many others. He then went to Egypt, studied tradition, and taught it to such people as 'Abd al-Ghani and al-Mundhiri. He also studied grammar in Egypt from Ibn Barrn. Abi Umar devoted much time to fiqh and spent many hours copying various Hanbali and Sifi works which he then gave away. He was chiefly known as an ascetic and may well have considered himself a Sixfi. He practiced mortification of the flesh and was credited with performing many miracles. It is not possible to determine how long Abii 'Umar was in Egypt. We know that he was in Jerusalem when Saladin made his triumphal entry in 583/1187. Our friend was on rather cool terms with the Aiyibid Sultan which may have made him feel more at home in Damascus. In fact, he founded a madrasa there in part of the family's dair and died in that city in 607/1210.

He was AbGi Bakr 'Abd Allih, born in Damascus in 578/1183. He studied tradition in his home town, in Baghdad, where one of his teachers was Ibn al-Jawzl, and in Egypt where he worked with al-BisIrI, Abc 'Abd Allah al-Art.hl, and F.tima bint Sa'd al-Khair. He studied fiqh from his father and his uncle, Ibn Qudmi. Later he served for a while as the Friday orator (aftib) of the mosque on Mount Q~syfn known as the Mosque of the I.anbalts. When he died in 643/1245, he was buried nearby. (1) It should be pointed out that one of his brothers, Abt Muhammad 'Abd al-Rahmin (d. 682/1283), who had studied hadith from the disciples of al-Silafi, became the first I;Ianball chief qdci of Damascus. (2) One of Ibn Qudima's sons also acquired part of his education in Egypt. This was Abfi 'l-Majd 'fIs. Little is known of him except that he studied fiqh and tradition first in Damascus and then in Egypt where he had the same teachers as his cousin Abc Bakr 'Abd Allih. He returned to Damascus, where al-Mundhiri met him, and became the khaflb and imdm of the aforesaid mosque on Mount Q&amp;sycin. He died in 615/1218. (3) What is most significant for us is that the Banc Qud~ma, perhaps the most important IjHanbali family outside of Baghdad, illustrate the very close relationship between the ;Ianbalis of Damascus and those of Egypt. In addition to those already mentioned, dozens of I;Ianbalis have come to light who were active in Egypt in one capacity or another during the Aiyibid period. We can list only a few of them here: Abci Muhammad 'Abd al-Majid b. 'Abd Allah al-Baghdidi (d. 604/1207), a student of Ibn al-Bann'"s grandson; (4) Abc Manstir 'Abd al-Salim b. 'Abd al-Wahhib (1) Al-IHusaini, Silat, fols. 30b-31a; Ibn Rajab, alDhail, II, 234-35; Ibn Shaddfd does not mention him as a khalftb in this mosque, al-A'ldq, p. 86, nor does al-Nu'aimi, al-Ddris, II, 435-R7.

'Abd al-Rahmin al-Baghdidi and his son Abti 'l-Faraj 'Abd al-Rahmin. The latter were, respectively, the son and grandson of Ibn al-Jawzi. Abc Muhammad Yisuf held several important positions under the caliph in Baghdad. He and his son were both killed when that city fell to the Mongols in 656/1258. (5) As for those from less illustrious backgrounds, we might mention Abc 'l-Ghani'im Musifir b.

(6) The latter mosque must have been one of the more important for the IHanbalis in Egypt. We also have Abi Bakr 'Abd al-'Aziz b.

Moreover, this institution was founded by the Sultan himself, al-Malik al-Sdlih Najm al-Din -hence it was called the al-.Sdlihiyya-so that this was tanta- mount to official recognition of our madhhab. Madrasas, however, were not as important to the IHanbalis as they were to the other Sunni schools. Makdisi has pointed out that they preferred to teach in masjids which were not controlled by the ruling authorities as madrasas usually were. (6) As we have seen, the ;Ianbalts were already established in several masjids in the country. Therefore, the creation of this madrasa should be more accurately regarded as evidence of the Sultan's (1) Al-Mundirt, al-Takmila, al-Maktaba al-Baladiyya MS, p. 133; Ibn Rajab, al-Dhail, II, 187.

LEISER realization that it was time to bring some measure of control over the Hanbalis. The first IHanbali professor of the al-.Slihiyya, which was actually four colleges in one building (one for each Sunnl madhhab), was Shams al-Din Abfi Bakr Muhammad b. Ibrihtm al-Maqdist. He was born in Damascus in 603/1206 and there he studied fiqh and tradition from Ibn Qud~ma. Shams al-Din's father and Ibn Qudima, in fact, were cousins. Our friend also pursued hadith from other authorities in Damascus and then in Baghdid. Among his tradition teachers in the latter city was the Sff S.hihhb al-Din al-Suhrawardi (d. 632/ 1234). Shams al-Din occupied himself with other subjects besides hadih in the 'Abb~sid capital. It was also there that he took a wife and became a father. Around 640/1242-43, he left for Egypt, where he remained for the rest of his life, and was almost immediately given the I.anbali chair of the al- .Slihiyya. In addition, he was appointed to the chair of the K__hnq~h of Sa'ld al-Su'adi', a post which heretofore had been held by ShAfi'ts. It will be remembered, moreover, that Saladin had stipulated that Ash'arism was to be the ideology taught in this S.fi institution. There is no sign, though, that Shams al-Din had any misgivings about taking the position. The exact circumstances in which this appoint- ment took place are unknown. It could possibly be seen as an attempt by the Sultan to undermine, to some degree, the very powerful Shhfi't madhhab or, more likely, to further recognize and manipulate the growing strength of the I.Ianbalis. At any rate, Shams al-Din rapidly became the leading Ijanbalt in Egypt. Indeed, after the Mamliks came to power, the Sultan Baibars found it necessary to increase the chief judgeships in Egypt from one to four between the years 661-62/ 1263-64. And Shams al-DIn was thus made the first Hanbali qd1i 'l-qud.t in the country. Baibars, however, dismissed him in 670/1271-72 as chief qdUi. Troops were sent to his home, he was arrested, and imprisoned for two years. We are only told that this was "because of certain duties that he was forced to undertake." It is reported, though, that</page><page sequence="27">HANBALISM IN EGYPT BEFORE THE MAMLOIKS 181 the Vizir al-S~hib Bahi' al-Din 'All b. Muhammad, known as Ibn IHanna, was prejudiced against him and probably induced the Sultan to take this action. After he was released, he confined himself to his home, although be continued to teach fiqh, h.adith, Qur'An reading, and issue legal opinions until he died in 676/1277. Shams al-Din was buried in al- Qarifa Cemetery next to his maternal uncle, 'Abd al-Ghani al-Maqdisi. (1) It should be clear from the above that the I.anbalis, though small in number, were more active in Egypt prior to the Mamlhik seizure of power than we have heretofore realized. They appeared in the 3rd/9th century around the time of Ibn IHanbal and have been there to this day. They first became really noticeable during the last 100 years of F.timid rule and under the Aiyfibids. They were, above all, concerned with the teaching of tradition, but also maintained their contacts with Sffism and brought with them their fight against Ash'arism. Several IHanbali families were very prominant, especially the extended family of Ibn Qudima. Those families also highlighted the close relationship between the I.anbalis of Damascus, and to a certain extent Baghdad, with those of Egypt. Altogether, the IHanbalis were definitely a factor in the religious life of the country long before the Mamlhiks and before the fall of Baghdad to the Mongols sent many of them fleeing to the west.
