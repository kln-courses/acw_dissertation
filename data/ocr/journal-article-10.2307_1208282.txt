<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE MODERN SEQUENCE AND ITS PRECURSORS M. L. Rosenthal and Sally M. Gall A "new" genre, the modern poetic sequence, has evolved over the past century and a half or longer. It has emerged so naturally, so without fanfare, as hardly to have been noticed. Yet, once its exist- ence has been pointed out, and a name proposed for it, 'tis very like a camel or a mountain or a whale or-to return to things literary- an epic poem. Its presence becomes abundantly obvious, for the modern sequence is the decisive form toward which all the developments of modern poetry have tended. It is the genre which best encompasses the shift in sensibility exemplified by starting a long poetic work "I celebrate myself, and sing myself," rather than "Sing, Goddess, the wrath of Achilles." The modern sequence goes many-sidedly into who and where we are subjectively; it springs from the same pres- sures on sensibility that have caused our poets' experiments with shorter forms. It, too, is a response to the lyrical possibilities of lan- guage opened up by those pressures in times of cultural and psycho- logical crisis, when all past certainties have many times been thrown chaotically into question. More successfully than individual short lyrics, however, it fulfills the need for encompassment of disparate and often powerfully opposed tonalities and energies. It is striking that the presence of this genre, the outgrowth of poets' recognition and pursuit of "new thresholds, new anatomies" (Hart Crane's visionary exclamation in a somewhat different con- text), has gone unappreciated for the most part. It is especially striking that experts in the very works that represent it so over- whelmingly-such works as Walt Whitman's Song of Myself, the ?M. L. Rosenthal and Sally M. Gall, 1981. Excerpted from the opening chap- ter of The Modern Poetic Sequence, to be published in 1981 by Oxford University Press.</page><page sequence="2">first great unmistakable exemplar of the form, and Ezra Pound's Cantos-should have missed the fact that they were confronting something new artistically, a creation of the genius of modern poetry to be closed with only through the dynamics of individual works. How could this have happened? One explanation, we believe, is the character of poetic evolution itself. It is easy to detect superficial signs of newness: departures from traditional rhyme and meter, the absence of explanatory or narrative links between images or other evocative centers, the use of a vocabulary and subject matter hither- to taboo or considered unsuitable for poetry. But it is another matter to see the bearing of such signs. If not simply disregarded, they are usually thought odd or peripheral, although they may mark vast shifts of psychic direction and of the axes of aesthetic sensibility. Consider that Whitman is still a problematic figure to many people, and that Romantic poetry is still disdained by certain "classicists" who, as William Butler Yeats noted, would hardly know where to turn should "their Catullus" suddenly appear in the flesh. But for all of us it is, by definition, hard to recognize other people's original- ity and even harder to give it our complete empathy. There is a further turn on the problem: critical recalcitrance. One needs to recall how seldom a literary work is actually treated without preconceptions, as a work of art that will tell us (if we allow it to do so) what its living character is. Now a work of art is made by a human being and reflects his or her empirical life and psycho- logical set and times and general stock of ideas-these are points hardly in question. But as a work of art it is a construct, improvised to hold some sort of equilibrium or balance, however frailly, against disorder: especially, against its own internal disorder. The tendency to annihilate the thing that's made to a mere thought, however com- plex, or to a biographical shade, however humanly interesting, is the great and dominant retrogression of our criticism. We stress this position not out of any desire to renew familiar polemics, but for the good practical reason that it must be constantly sustained and recon- ceived if we are to see what is going on aesthetically in a literary work. Critical recalcitrance results from the fact that "rational" scholarship and criticism too easily ignore the improvisatory, tenta- tive nature of artistic experience, which is intimately related to the volatile richness of ordinary human awareness. But poets cannot ignore it; it is the primary condition of their art, and the key to the MODERN POETIC SEQUENCE I 309</page><page sequence="3">need for a formal resolution that a poem presses to fulfill. As William Carlos Williams tells us at the start of his sequence Pater- son, they must work "with the bare hands." Their only recourse is To make a start, out of particulars and make them general, rolling up the sum, by defective means- Sniffing the trees, just another dog among a lot of dogs .. . Thus the poet's task. Not every poet would put it in so decep- tively humble a way. Yet even Yeats, with his aristocratic yearnings, wrote that the dreams and images of his poetry had their source in "the foul rag-and-bone shop of the heart." Commonplaces of poetic consciousness, these perspectives are hardly reflected anywhere in our poetic criticism; yet one might expect critics to use all their an- tennae to detect a poem's essential effort and idiom and then-by whatever "defective means"-to follow through as best they could. If, for example, one finds apparent fragmentation in a poem, one should want to get in touch with the fragments, get the tonal char- acter of each, and open oneself to their internal relationships. Or if one finds apparently "unpoetic" elements, one must be ready for a possible widening of poetic range and the discovery of unexpectedly valuable dimensions. In short, what is called for is a critical method and theory congruent with and reflexive from poetic practice-a poet's poetics. Criticism, however, has been drifting into various autotelic and self-adoring postures, rarely allowing itself to be instructed by the art of writers. Hence the strange blindness to what counts: here, to the towering presence of a genre that has dominated the ambition of every great modern poet. ("Blindness" may be too gentle a word in an era in which a number of critics begin to discount the value of artistic achievement altogether.) A cultivated empathy with the dynamic life of works can encourage the ability to discern new or- ganic forms and aesthetic tendencies. Artistic change, in response to cultural change, goes on all the time independently of a critic's ability to recognize it. But the critic can at least try to be open to the 'William Carlos Williams, Paterson (New York: New Directions, 1940), p. 11. 310 1 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="4">most telling art, to its idiosyncratic energy and character, to the austere, driven intensity that Rebecca West named "the beautiful stark bride of Blake." The alerted state that devotion to such a modern muse entails draws language into discovery. Obviously the process precedes conscious formulation. By the same token, it leads to the only kind of "experimentation" that matters in art. The whole development of the modern sequence, inseparable from that of modern poetry, has involved this sort of inevitable yet unformulated experimentation. These sequences have been written in the spirit of our changed world, meeting the needs of sensibilities impatient with posturing and keyed to rigorous emotional accuracy. Of course it is sheer dogmatism to rule out any form or genre as obsolete ("the novel is dead"), and it is always possible that some genius will find a way of writing a long, continuous narrative poem or logically or thematically developed one that will satisfy the most knowledgeable and sensitized of contemporary readers. But a fatal ennui with such efforts does seem to have set in, and not even the gifts of a poet as truly remarkable as Wallace Stevens have been able to achieve more than a momentary, suspect remission. Like the first modulations toward the writing of sequences, critical inklings of the major direction of modern practice came early and piecemeal and--naturally--from poets. The most notable is Poe's remarkable insight in his 1846 essay "The Philosophy of Composition" (developed more fully in "The Poetic Principle" shortly afterwards): What we term a long poem is, in fact, merely a succession of brief ones- that is to say, of brief poetical effects. It is needless to demonstrate that a poem is such, only inasmuch as it intensely excites, by elevating, the soul; and all intense excitements are, through a psychal necessity, brief. For this reason, at least one half of the "Paradise Lost" is essentially prose-a suc- cession of poetical excitements interspersed, inevitably, with corresponding depressions-the whole being deprived, through the extremeness of its length, of the vastly important artistic element, totality, or unity, of effect.2 2James A. Harrison, ed., The Complete Works of Edgar Allan Poe (1902; rpt. New York: AMS Press, 1965), XIV, 195-96. An interesting precedent for these ideas may be found in John Stuart Mill's essay "Alfred de Vigny" (1838), in his Dissertations and Discussions (London: 1867-second edition), I, 326-27. Mill holds it "impossible that a feeling so intense as to require a more rhythmical cadence than that of eloquent prose, should sustain itself at highest elevation for long together." MODERN POETIC SEQUENCE 1 311</page><page sequence="5">Scholars in their serried ranks (Miltonists especially) have wittily or somberly demolished Poe's logic here, to their own satis- faction. What they have not dealt with is his unerring pointing of the new direction of sensibility. Poe may have been mistaken in any given assertion, but he was dead right in what is after all his essential position: that the traditional ways to structure the long poem no longer satisfy the modern poet. A poem depends for its life neither on continuous narration nor on developed argument but on a progression of specific qualities and intensities of emotionally and sensuously charged awareness. A successful long poem, and the modern sequence pre-eminently, is made up of such centers of intensity. Its structure resides in the felt relationships among them. Narration and argument are useful poetically only as they provide certain kinds of dynamic structuring of the centers of intensity and tones-of suspense, expectation, thoughtfulness, or whatever-to go with them (Poe's "succession" of "brief poetical effects"). Chronological and rational ordering are but two among many possible structural devices subsumed in a work's lyrical structure. The problem cannot be solved by a debate over Paradise Lost. It is a matter of the fundamental character of lyrical structure: a way of making and viewing poetic constructs that concentrates on something other than logical and narrative and thematic links. We shall return to the basic considerations of lyrical structure shortly. We should point out here that it is intimately related to the general conception of an organic rather than a mechanical approach to structure that has been with us for a long time, particularly in ref- erence to the less subtle formal characteristics of a work-its rhyme scheme or stanza form or adherence to certain dramatic "laws." The sources of ideas about organic form lie in antiquity; in modern times they come to us by way of German and English Romantic theory, epitomized in Coleridge's defense of Shakespeare against the notion that he was a wild, undisciplined genius, "a sort of African nature, fertile in beautiful monsters." Borrowing his language directly from one of A. W. Schlegel's Dramatic Lectures, Coleridge said that such a mistake arises when we confound "mechanic regularity with organic form. The form is mechanic when on any given material we impress a predetermined form not necessarily arising out of the properties of the material . . . The organic form, on the other hand, is innate; it shapes as it develops itself from within, and the fullness 312 I CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="6">of its development is one and the same with the perfection of its outward form. Such is the life, such the form."3 In the United States the first transmitter of the idea of organic form was Emerson. His essay "The Poet," published two years before Poe's "The Philosophy of Composition," opened directly on the great poetry to come. Emerson's most striking formulation was derived from European ideas but absolutely original in its call for artistic exploration: our poets must find the form in which to "chaunt our own times and social circumstances." He understood the necessity for loosening the grip of tight, conventional formal structures. Although he-as a poet-lacked the nervy genius and the powerful pressures to make a reckless break himself, he helped create a climate less hostile to experiment than before. Charles Olson's 1959 pronouncement, echoing Robert Creeley, that "form is never more than an extension of content"4 was preceded by 115 years in Emerson's vivid and elegant declaration: For it is not metres, but a metre-making argument that makes a poem,-a thought so passionate and alive that like the spirit of a plant or an animal it has an architecture of its own, and adorns nature with a new thing. . . . The poet has a new thought; he has a whole new experience to unfold; he will tell us how it was with him, and all men will be the richer in his fortune. For the experience of each new age requires a new confession, and the world seems always waiting for its poet.5 It was-of course, it would be-an embarrassing and perhaps disreputable poet like Whitman who would respond to this thrilling challenge. It couldn't be the personally and poetically inhibited Emerson, who entertained the most daring ideas but whose verbal 'Terence Hawkes, ed., Writings on Shakespeare (New York: Capricorn Books, 1959), p. 68. Coleridge's Shakespeare Lectures, published in 1818, were delivered between 1808 and 1814. The passage in question (from Coleridge's 1808 lecture notes) uses A. W. Schlegel's distinction between "mechanische" and "organische" form and comes close to exact translation. See Schlegel's Uber dramatische Kunst und Litteratur (Heidelberg: 1817-second edition), III, 8.

Whitman's Song of Myself is the first realized modern poetic sequence, to be followed by Calamus and Drum-Taps as his other prime contributions to the genre. And not far from this poetic epicenter was the virtually secret work of the great American "underground" poet, Emily Dickinson, mistress of a realm of confessional lyricism whose volcanic beauty did not erupt into general view until well after her death. Her fascicles-the hand- threaded packets (or booklets) in which many of her most powerful poems are arranged-belong in any consideration of the modern se- quence, despite their erratic success as integrated works of art. The genre's full flourishing, however, came only in the 1920s, with T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land, Pound's early cantos and Hugh Selwyn Mauberley, Yeats's Irish Civil War sequences, Crane's "Voyages," and Hugh MacDiarmid's A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle. Since that time, the outstanding poets writing in English have used the sequence to accommodate the complexities and passions of contemporary experience. When we speak of this domi- nating form we do not forget that any individual sequence has, in Emerson's words, its own "architecture." There are, for instance, obvious differences among the works just named and among the others we shall adduce, such as Crane's The Bridge, Williams' Pater- son, Basil Bunting's Briggflatts, Robert Lowell's Life Studies, Olson's The Maximus Poems, Ramon Guthrie's Maximum Security Ward, Austin Clarke's Mnemosyne Lay in Dust, Ted Hughes's Crow, and Galway Kinnell's The Book of Nightmares. These are works of varied quality, but all are high points in their authors' de- velopment and serious efforts within the genre: neither "long poem" nor "linked series" but "sequence." They exemplify a compelling process, the result of sheer, psychically powerful need on each poet's part to mobilize and give direction to otherwise scattered energies. For reasons we have earlier suggested, we cannot assume gen- eral knowledge of the nature and achievement of this new genre. Nor can we assume general knowledge of the critical approach, empha- sizing lyrical structure (but not confining that term to the short lyric poem), necessary for insight into the character of the sequence-its balancings of stress and interplay among its centers of passionate preoccupation. Indeed, this vital structuring principle in poetry has been almost as neglected as its major modern genre. The modern sequence, then, is a grouping of mainly lyric poems and passages, rarely uniform in pattern, which tend to interact as an organic whole. It usually includes narrative and dramatic elements, 314 | CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="8">and ratiocinative ones as well, but its structure is finally lyrical. Inti- mate, fragmented, self-analytical, open, emotionally volatile, the se- quence meets the needs of modern sensibility even when the poet aspires to tragic or epic scope. (The intimate character, the strong sense we have of a highly subjective impulse of lyrical energy at work, makes it helpful to refer to the poem's "speaker" or "protag- onist." Since this usage is more a convenience of critical discourse, very easily misleading, than a key to aesthetic structure, we must remember that we are not dealing with a literal speech or monologue or poeticized discourse but with something like a piece of music.) The intimate, self-conscious tonality is often present from the very start: "I celebrate myself, and sing myself," "Bring me to the blasted oak," "April is the cruellest month," "So name her Vivian. I, scarecrow Merlin."6 It establishes an initial poetic pitch more than a theme or character. The pitch may change; so may the level of diction, the points of reference, and the contexts of evocation. The poem creates its own dynamics, in fact, whether or not it has a speci- fied dramatic speaker. Yet a dramatic speaker is often its vehicle, not controlling its movement but frequently presented as under a pressure felt as tragic. We may be confronted by a speaker in extremis. A piercing example is the mortal agony of Guthrie's "Today is Friday" in Maximum Security Ward. You could taste it being fed intravenously through a skein of tubes into your most plausible dreams It was happening It was going on as suavely as if it were a rank of drop-forges smashing diamonds to dust as fast as they could be fed to them.7 Or, in a less acutely personal key of suffering but still in the realm of tragedy, the poem is oppressed by what Delmore Schwartz called "the burden of consciousness," the alienated music of "civilization and its discontents." Yeats gives us many instances, as in "The Stare's Nest by My Window"-part of "Meditations in Time of 6These lines introduce, in order, Whitman's Song of Myself, Yeats's Words for Music Perhaps, Eliot's The Waste Land, and Guthrie's Maximum Security Ward. 7Ramon Guthrie, Maximum Security Ward (New York: Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 1970), p. 7. MODERN POETIC SEQUENCE | 315</page><page sequence="9">Civil War" and, in its way, not really less desperate than Guthrie's lines: We are closed in, and the key is turned On our uncertainty; somewhere A man is killed, or a house burned, Yet no clear fact to be discerned: Come build in the empty house of the stare. A barricade of stone or of wood; Some fourteen days of civil war; Last night they trundled down the road That dead young soldier in his blood: Come build in the empty house of the stare.8 Seeking to locate the elements of its oppressed yet volatile state, the associative pressure in such works stirs up sunken dimensions of consciousness and memory from the depths, moving through con- fusions and ambiguities towards a precarious balance. The process of association and of modulation among shifting intensities is both psychological and cultural in its contexts of reference. It involves the feeling of obsolescence, the need to recover an identifying past. Here enters the heroic or epic aspect of the sequence: its effort to pit primal values and personal, historical, and artistic memory or vision against anomie and desolation. Thus, Guthrie's title ("Today is Fri- day") refers distantly to the Crucifixion, and Yeats powerfully sug- gests natural values to be clung to in the face of war's perversity. Similarly, Bunting and Clarke bring moments of secure childhood bliss into their sequences to help counteract psychological or moral distress; Hughes invents a drastic and cynical Creation "myth" that mocks and parodies the Bible but also suggests a source of strength in the mere will to survive (epitomized negatively in the appalled poem "That Moment" and in minimally positive terms in "Little- blood"9); and Bunting, Williams, David Jones, and others use re- gional history and dialect to make a music of affirmation of identiy. In short, the modern sequence has evolved out of a serious need for an encompassing poetry, one completely involved with what our lives really mean subjectively. That need reflects the ultimate pres- 8The Collected Poems of William Butler Yeats (New York: Macmillan, 1956), p. 202. 9Ted Hughes, Crow (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1971), pp. 10 and 84. 316 1 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="10">sure on modern sensibility to understand itself and to regain what Olson called the "human universe." The pressure, right or wrong, is to reconceive reality in humanly reasspring ways rather than in chill- ingly impersonal ones. It is felt inescapably by poets, even when they hardly realize why they write as they do, as a pressure to remember and deepen their sense of our human reality while rejecting any hu- bristic, anthropomorphic self-deception. (See Hart Crane's "Proem: To Brooklyn Bridge" for a very pure projection of this pressure.) The struggle against depression and loss of morale in this context was waged powerfully by great poets in the past in work like Donne's "A Nocturnall upon St. Lucie's Day," Wordsworth's "Tintern Abbey," and Tennyson's Maud: A Monodrama. These titles, in their chronological order, will suggest that certain pressures are a constant, cutting across differences of time and poetic genre. At the same time, the poems themselves may suggest an increasing emphasis, as poetry approaches its modern phase, on a complex music of feeling involving a number of radiant centers, progressively liberated from a narrative or thematic framework. Here we must attempt a few basic observations on this liberated lyrical structure. Let's say, first, that its object is neither to resolve a problem nor to conclude an action but to achieve the keenest, most open realization possible. This realization is, naturally, rooted in a work's initial pressures but goes beyond them in scope. By initial pressures we mean the human occasion for the poem, its set of awareness, its situation (the felt reality within the poem), its condi- tion of sensuous or emotional apprehension-whatever constitutes an emotional center energizing the poem, which moves towards a state of equilibrium that balances, resolves, or encompasses these pressures. This state of equilibrium is generally a momentary one, among varied and volatile states of feeling, awareness, and active emotional or intellectual discovery. We may call it an equilibrium among affects in process. It provides a sense of encompassment or tran- scendence, because the poem has, as it were, reached a height of responsiveness to all pressures acting on it. The ability to hold in bal- ance conflicting and logically irreconcilable energies, and to identify their presence and intensity, is felt as mastery over contradiction, mastery by poetic conversion into a pattern of unruly but mobilized affects. MODERN POETIC SEQUENCE 317</page><page sequence="11">It follows that the higher the work's level of responsiveness, and the more manifold the pressures acting on it yet held in balance, the more satisfying the lyrical structure will be and the more powerful the illusion of transcendence. A short, concentrated poem, it is true, may also synthesize complexly or subtly related tonalities despite its surface simplicity: Westron winde, when will thou blow, The smalle raine downe can raine? Crist, if my love wer in my armis, And I in my bed againe. The whole of this little song is charged with longing, yet each line resonates on its own. The first line-an impatient wish, what- ever the reason, for a change in the weather-is followed by the am- biguously related vision of the "smalle raine," with a certain gentle ardor accompanying both lines. Then comes the expletive, and the song swells into a lover's frustrated outburst. But we are here primarily concerned with poems on a larger scale, in which such a piece as "Westron winde," though lovely and self-contained, might form a single affect. It is instructive to con- sider a long poem like Browning's magnificent "The Englishman in Italy"--292 lines in five unnumbered sections-as a model of lyrical structure. The brief opening and close provide a dramatic and intel- lectual frame. The middle 273 lines are so richly loaded with inter- twined sensuous effects, gathering and multiplying from moment to moment, that the poem seems an epic of riotous openness. For the cultivated "Englishman" who is the vehicle of the poem's dynamics, the daily world of Italian life in the country region outside Sorrento is all splendor and surprise. In the twelve-line opening section we see him filled with solicitude for little Fortfh, who is frightened by the sirocco: Fortui, Fortti, my beloved one, Sit here by my side, On my knees put up both little feet! I was sure, if I tried, I could make you laugh spite of Scirocco. Now, open your eyes, Let me keep you amused till he vanish In black from the skies, 318 J CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="12">With telling my memories over As you tell your beads; All the Plain saw me gather, I garland -The flowers or the weeds. To amuse the child, the speaker spins out a vivid account of his adventures in observation. The long second section (116 lines) is a continuous explosion of the senses that begins with an exclamation and continues in high excitement and with some unsqueamish whimsy: Time for rain! for your long hot dry Autumn Had net-worked with brown The white skin of each grape on the bunches, Marked like a quail's crown, Those creatures you make such account of, Whose heads,-speckled white Over brown like a great spider's back, As I told you last night,- Your mother bites off for her supper. Red-ripe as could be, Pomegranates were chapping and splitting In halves on the tree ... From these passages (the first strophe and the next twelve lines of the poem) we can see much of the whole poem's quality. The exu- berance of all that is to come is foreshadowed here in the tones of ro- bustly active kindness and in the eagerness to pour out fresh "mem- ories" that are at once compared with a rosary and a garland. This comparison is an active one, full of word-play-with telling beads and with making a garland. (The word "garland" is a verb here.) The rhythmic movement is contained within the simple rhyme- scheme xaxaxbxb ..., and the meter sustains the entranced tone and overflowing spirits by its flexible energy--alternating trimeter and dimeter lines in a mixture of iambic and anapestic, with femi- nine endings for most of the longer lines. The form allows for luxur- ious expansiveness while militating against mere prolixity. "The Englishman in Italy" is such a delight one could spend pages over it. But our point here is primarily to suggest the kind of dynamics, and considerations of formal analysis, involved in lyrical structure: the shifting of affects and the means of modulation as the MODERN POETIC SEQUENCE I 319</page><page sequence="13">poem changes key. The 100-line third section, as glorious though not as wild in its detail as the second, takes us on a muleback journey to the top of a neighboring hill. The arrival may be compared to moments of buoyant exultation, tempered by surprise and awe, in Dante's Divine Comedy. From all the swarmingly physical, teeming, appetite-filled life on the plain below we rise, as on the higher reaches of the Purgatorial Mount-but not self-importantly, for the description of the mule provides a humorously delicate touch: Over all trod my mule with the caution Of gleaners o'er sheaves, Still, foot after foot like a lady, Till, round after round, He climbed to the top of Calvano, And God's own profound Was above me, and round me the mountains, And under, the sea, And within me my heart to bear witness What was and shall be. Oh, heaven and the terrible crystal! No rampart excludes Your eye from the life to be lived In the blue solitudes. The sudden leap into the language of revelatory terror is a triumph of virtuosity, one that gave every sort of clue to later poets. It is comparable to the passages in Browning's Sordello (Book One, lines 374-84 and 392-439) that Pound reprints in his ABC of Reading and that anticipate the sharper breaks of tonality in the Cantos. The narrative context that Browning provides is sloughed off in Pound's writing, which operates by juxtaposition without the inhibition of surface continuity. Early and late-say in the shift from the hell-scene to the sudden paradisal vision in Canto 16; and from the morass of associations, compounded of immediate prison- camp details, political outbursts, bits of rueful memory, and ran- dom items, to the sustained, increasingly exquisite Dionysian hymn that rises from the morass in Canto 79-Pound has made brilliant use of this method adapted from Browning. The leap, in the passage just quoted, to the images of "heaven and the terrible crystal" and of "the life to be lived / In the blue solitudes" is of the same order (in the intrinsic, rather than the overt poem) as Pound's leaps of focus and affect, or Yeats's sudden "The swan has leaped into the 320 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="14">desolate heaven" in "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen." In "The Englishman in Italy" itself it prepares us for another miraculous shift at the heights, again anticipating Pound's method, that brings us some lines later into the mythical realm of Ulysses and the sirens. It also, however, introduces between these passages a strange element of hubris, from which perspective the ordinary folk below seem contemptible. An unexpected arrogance, foreshadowing the poem's amused condescension toward the end, intrudes on the tone of high solitude so thrillingly reached. By contrast the plains below are now seen as "soft" and "cowering"-"a sensual and timorous beauty" that is "how fair! but a slave." Thus we are prepared for the descent, which, when its moment comes, is so charmingly managed in the 57-line fourth section that one forgets the withering tone in the interim. But it returns. The sirocco has spent itself, and the child is directed to all the activities people have resumed-just a matter of looking out the window and seeing the gypsy, "our tinker and smith," all set up for his work and keeping his eye on the mis- chievous urchins all around, and the whole village preparing for the Feast of the Rosary's Virgin, and the scaffold ready for the musi- cians- All the fiddlers and fifers and drummers And trumpeters bold, Not afraid of Bellini nor Auber- and the fireworks laid out to be "religiously popped" when the "flaxen wigged Image" of the Virgin is carried in. And so we have moved from protective concern to sheer life-zest to transported exaltation to responsive appreciation, at once exuberant and nastily snobbish, of the villagers' noisy bustle of religious celebration. Then, after a quick return to the world of cheerfully brutal earthy things ("a scorpion with wide angry nippers"), the poem ends in a seven-line section contrasting all this blazing life with England's repressive atmosphere. Specifically, the ending concerns the reac- tionary resistance to abolishing the Corn Laws-the politically black British "Scirocco," in Browning's metaphor. The balance of these varied elements in separate sections provides the germ of how a poetic sequence works. It precisely indi- cates the nature of lyrical structure: the interaction of units of affect. In all such discussion we of course assume the work of a real poet, by which we mean someone superbly gifted in creating affects-spe- MODERN POETIC SEQUENCE I 321</page><page sequence="15">cific intensities of thought, feeling, and awareness. The relevant questions are simple: What are the successive affects? Is there a cumulative, psychologically satisfying curve of movement? Is there sufficient variety to make for a rich and complex experience? What are the poetic resources used to create the tonal centers? Lyrical structure, incidentally, is by no means restricted to poems. It is a characteristic of all literary genres: plays, novels, short stories, sermons, speeches, even prose exposition. It is, precisely, the con- crete aesthetic dimension of any piece of verbal expression. We are here deliberately oversimplifying what, in practice, makes for some subtle and demanding problems of evaluation, but the downright simplicities are essential to bring criticism in direct alignment with the literature it is concerned with. Once the clarification of a work's progression of affects, its dy- namics or curve of movement, has been accomplished, then all sorts of extrinsic considerations may be brought to bear, such as the pres- sures exerted on the lyrical structure by personal experience, his- torical events, poetic influence, myth and religion, psychoanalytical theory, or whatever. All such considerations are relevant if they can be shown to be shaping forces within the work's movement and not, under the guise of poetic criticism, pursued for their own sakes. We have stressed an approach to poetry that is not only ana- logous to the study of music but almost identical with it. Aaron Copland, in his essay "The Composer in Industrial America," could be a poet speaking of his art: What, after all, do I put down when I put down notes? I put down a reflec- tion of emotional states: feelings, perceptions, imaginings, intuitions. An emotional state, as I use the term, is compounded of everything we are: our background, our environment, our convictions.10 The composer's "emotional state," defined this broadly, is a quality of his music similar to what we mean by a poetic affect-although, putting the matter more rigorously, we would say that a passage pre- sents the affect rather than reflecting it. Further, Copland says that whatever "meaning" music has resides precisely in the particu- larizing of these "fluent emotional states." Just because it "particu- larizes and makes actual," art opens onto these states-the sub- 'oAaron Copland, Music and Imagination (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ. Press, 1952), p. 111. 322 1 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="16">jective "meaning" of the human condition. The "worlds of feeling" that musical themes project make up the "expressive plane" in music, which Copland sharply distinguishes from the "sheerly sen- suous" and "sheerly musical" planes. The expressive plane, he says in "How We Listen," is the heart of the musical experience and should be the first concern of performers. "Professional musi- cians . . . often fall into the error of becoming so engrossed with their arpeggios and staccatos that they forget the deeper aspects of the music they are performing."'' Here Copland's professional musicians are very much like those trained readers of poetry-whether students, professors, or critics- who likewise ignore the heart of artistic experience. They too forget that the "very nature" of poetry, as of music, is "to give us the essence of experience transfused and heightened and expressed in such fashion that we may contemplate it at the same instant that we are swayed by it." In music that "essence of experience" lies in the progression of themes; in poetry it resides in the progression of affects within the work's lyrical structure. Now Song of Myself can be considered the first modern poetic sequence because it is the first poetic work of considerable length whose ordering is overridingly lyrical. It is not bound by thematic, philosophical, or formal conventions in the way that so many earlier so-called "sequences" were-Elizabethan sonnet sequences in par- ticular-or in the way that more varied works such as Sidney's Astrophil and Stella or Herbert's The Temple were. Song of Myself involves a more sustained curve of movement than these or than such more nearly contemporary works as Blake's Songs of Inno- cence and Songs of Experience. Nor is it like any exactly contem- porary British work. Thus Whitman may be passionately concerned with death and immortality ("themes" in an abstractly topical rather than a musical sense); but the whole character of his sequence is entirely different, say, from that of In Memoriam. Tennyson's poem is intellectually far more self-conscious and at times attempts to set philosophical discussion and resolution to rhyme and meter. Even in Maud, published the same year as Song of Myself, Tennyson felt the need to set up a narrative-dramatic frame to justify his real structure: the juxtaposition of states of mind so intense they went "Aaron Copland, What to Listen for in Music (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1957-second edition), pp. 18-23. MODERN POETIC SEQUENCE 1 323</page><page sequence="17">beyond what his society considered normal. But Song of Myself is structured-on the surface as well as in its innermost life-neither to resolve a problem nor to conclude an action but to evoke the keen- est, most open realization possible. As far as we know, only Dickin- son was working along the same lines. It may strike some readers as curious or naive to speak of the "genius" of modern poetry, and especially to link it with the terms "heroic" and "epic" and with Coleridge's phrase "organic unity." Very serious people are now calling literature obsolete and seeking to discharge its mysteries along with its traditions and its distinction as art. Indeed, there is a strong tendency to deny the validity of both "art" and "distinction." Yet we must insist-whatever the theo- retical attractions of exalting intellectual systems and ennui-gen- erated positions over living works-that the individual work of genius is our one touchstone of value in the arts. As for "the genius of modern poetry," we refer to the stripping-away process, or lib- eration of sensibility, that marks the evolution of modern art. We cannot attribute the process to any one person or movement; it is a cultural phenomenon, a reflex of deep historical change. Poetry has, in a famous phrase, wrung the neck of rhetoric-that is, of "poetic" attitudinizing, sentimentality, and religious or philosophical preach- ing. It has sloughed off any notion that it is primarily a medium for story-tellers and moralists. Ideas, dramatic situations, narrative sus- pense-these have by no means disappeared from poetry, any more than has the sonnet or iambic pentameter or any other mode de- veloped in the past. All have their uses. But the real poem, its dy- namics always active beneath the surface structure of poems in any age, has come into its own. As a result, the poet is now free to let his or her poem present itself directly in its own right and to create a movement, reversible and always in flux, of vital immediacies. Lyrical structure as we have described it is improvisatory but not undisciplined. Its rigor lies in the play of tonal depths and shadings and shiftings, grounded in human intensities but not translatable into general ideas or empirical problems and solutions. Those human intensities are centered in moments of realization, shared in life and art, in which aesthetic conversion becomes possible. Language, with all its traditions and evocative possibilities, connects with the complex of human aware- ness in action and takes over from it. Poetic phrasing and struc- turing are a phase of our human lives (a reflex, as we have noted) 324 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="18">that enables us to reorient, reassemble, and explore felt meanings and imagined states with but one responsibility: faithfulness to our most candid perceptions and to the implications of language. The most developed poets have clarified these simple principles in their practice and thus have revolutionized the art of poetry. The climactic development in the revolution is the modern sequence, still in process of formation. New York University MODERN POETIC SEQUENCE 325</page></plain_text>
