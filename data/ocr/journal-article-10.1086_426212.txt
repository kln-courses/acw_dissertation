      <p>What should a “cultural history of the zoo” look like? When the conference that gave rise to this volume took place in 1995, the conferees had little guidance, for no comprehensive history of the zoo had been undertaken since Gustave Loisel’s monumental <italic>Histoire des ménageries d’Antiquité à nos jours</italic> (3 vols.; Doin, 1912). Consonant with the larger opening up of the history of popular science to interdisciplinary investigation, scholars from fields as diverse as the history of science, social and cultural history, history of art and architecture, animal behavior, and zoo management came together to begin developing such a cultural history. The fourteen relatively short papers growing out of this conference could not provide a comprehensive new history, but they did begin to map out the possibilities, offering much promise for this topic area, which has indeed flourished since.</p>
      <p>The papers concentrate on zoos in German‐speaking Europe and neighboring countries from the Renaissance to the present and are of two general kinds. Half cover the period from the 1690s to the mid‐nineteenth century and are written by scholars with the distinctly historicist concerns of reconstructing and analyzing the institutional and cultural history of living animal collections (ranging from traveling menageries and princely collections to the bourgeois zoo). Among these, the authoritative essays by Lothar Dittrich, on princely menageries, and Annelore Rieke‐Müller, on the foundations of the public zoo in the mid‐nineteenth century, offer a remarkably comprehensive picture of the changing cultural meanings of the living animal collection over the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Case studies by Ilse Jahn and Donna Mehos (of seventeenth‐century Paris and nineteenth‐century Amsterdam, respectively) address the history of scientific investigations using zoo animals, while Bettina Paust’s article on the baroque royal menageries in Paris, Vienna, and Schönbrunn reminds us how little these menageries had to do with science and how much instead with the iconography of princely power. Two more articles attend especially to visual evidence: Sigrid Dittrich analyzes paintings for clues to the history of exotic animal keeping in the Renaissance, while Florence F. J. M. Pieters, curator of the Artis Zoo library in Amsterdam, examines the fascinating folio scrapbook of Jan Velten, compiled from about 1695 to 1709, for evidence of menageries and individual exotic animals.</p>
      <p>Most of the other essays are more concerned with illuminating issues related to contemporary zoo management than with history and will be of primary interest to sociologists and future historians. These concern the components of modern “zoo biology” (Christian R. Schmidt), collaborations of veterinarians with zoos (Wilhelm Schulze), legal and policy aspects of animal protection for zoos (the late Claus Messow), “modern zoo management” (Henning Wiesner), and pedagogical arrangements of contemporary German zoos (Rosl Kirchshofer). Gunther Nogge’s compact essay on the role of the zoo in preserving endangered species through breeding programs provides fundamental touchpoints for the history of the zoo’s recent transformation into a “Noah’s ark.” These articles are certainly not without interest—for example, the problem of zoo overpopulation, which must be dealt with by hormonal birth control, euthanasia, or separation of animals by sex, raises both practical and ethical problems worthy of our attention. It also stands in interesting tension with the current image of the zoo as a “Noah’s ark.”</p>
      <p>Among these papers, the crucial period of the first half of the twentieth century, which saw the introduction of the barless enclosure and the development of zoo‐based animal behavior studies, is largely missing. Only Hans Werner Ingensiep’s essay concerns this period, tracing the “humanization” of the gorilla since the mid‐nineteenth century and raising provocative philosophical issues about anthropomorphism and the nature of personhood.</p>
      <p>Clearly there is much more work to be done here, especially on the twentieth century, but this book provides a firm takeoff point. Even as more work emerges on the history of the zoo, these essays will remain important for both their information and their analytical perspectives.</p>
