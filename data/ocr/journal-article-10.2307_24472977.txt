The shift in attention is not so far from the with the quotidian. Neeta Madahar's stunning fifteen-image pictures of Madahar's parents'home or her apartment; it's just a series "Sustenance" frames such casual sightings as a bird in a few steps, after all, from the domestic interior to this balcony, backyard as precious, defining moments. What she captures is There is much slippage here between viewer and subject: the more than a mere pose within the fleeting: it is a rich, contempla- artist's eye that does not see but approximates by sound and tive stillness; a chance for both artist and viewer to look, with time of day; the mass of images distilled down to this essence; mesmeric clarity of detail, at the avian community whose constant the element of chance that would make John Cage proud; the cohabitation with humans has rendered their presence osten- formality of a decisive moment that would impress Cartier sibly incidental. Birds are the subjects of these photographs, but Bresson; that elusive topography where nature and humanity hardly the sum of their content. It is not that we get to see what collide. Madahar charts a pleasure that is feral, unpredictable, she sees—in fact, the artist stays shuttered away from her sub- yet eminently of the leisure time and comforts of suburban sen jects, only intuiting her vision through the familiarity of a bird's sibilities. She works at the intersection where we have access to song—what we share with Madahar here is a sense of wonder. the wild: the domestic site within nature. Of course, the frame Born of an Indian family living in England, Madahar earned is elemental to this fiction.

Madahar's journey from the living room to a collective out in Conceptual art, working most often with video, and then fantasy of the wilderness does not, however, trace a fault line moved to Massachusetts to study fine art. That's where she between civilization and the idyll; it is, rather, the axis upon began making pictures of these birds—something of a novelty which her discourse on this disjunction revolves, back home in England, where an American cardinal or a blue jay Perhaps the oddest question raised by this eccentric set of can carry a degree of exotic cachet—setting up her camera for pictures is whether they are nature-photography or portraiture, a period of eighteen months on the balcony of her apartment. This is most definitely not a contemplation of the sublime (such Perhaps it is that play of distance that suggests a personal as those left us by great wilderness photographers), nor is it connection within this work.

In fact, her earliest photographs (she first picked loneliness.

"People would ask me where I'm from," when it comes to communing with art or nature.) The more we she remembers, "so for me it became a question of where is look at them, the more truly wonderful they are. Self-evident home." It is a word rich with ambiguity—be it about her race, her in these profoundly ambiguous photographs is their startling parents' home, or what part of town she was living in.

Here, then, the par ticularity of environment (birds, for all their travels, do belong to a specific region) is subject to a more poetic sense of universality. Whenever the fluidity of nature is broken, when it is stilled by some aesthetic intervention, the result has the quality of a memento mori. Cessation is the ultimate con templation of what is alive as an artifact of mortality. The way we halt this inevitability is a subject central to Mada har's work. There is a perfection here that is disturbing, a quiet so disquieting that the suspended moment hard ly seems real. Think of flowers that are so perfect and vibrant that we assume they must be fake, and you get a sense of Madahar's birds. This is the illustrative voice, drawn from the seventeenth-century English naturalist philosophers, who would travel the world to collect its myriad flora and fauna or meditate upon their own back yards to divine the secret order of the universe. This sense of artifice was not an end that Madahar sought, but "a delight" when it came through. Before she embarked on this series, in fact, it was her aspira tion to work with dioramas like those encountered in natural-history museums. "Just as the naturalists were intent on ways to categorize, classify, and understand nature," the artist explains, "dioramas are used as an educational tool to make sense of history. I love their compression of time and geography." For Madahar, who chooses to print her photographs digitally on Somerset velvet paper—most commonly associated with water colors—the digital is subservient to the conventional means of fine art photography. Although they are diffi cult to believe, these images use no collage, montage, or visual manipulation. By making evident our won derment, by finding the extraordinary in the ordinary, Madahar wraps together the whole question of truth and beauty that, as much as ever, remains an argu ment on the nature of veracity in photography.© All images from Neeta Madahar's "Sustenance"series, 2004.
