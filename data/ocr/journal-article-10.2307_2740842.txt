She was educated at the Texas University for Women, Denton, and at the University of North Carolina (M.A., anthropology, 1962; Ph.D., anthropology, 1968). She has been a special student in anthropology and prehistory at the universities of Geneva and Tehran and at the School of Oriental and African Studies of the University of London and has done anthropological research in Spain, Turkey, Greece, Iran, India, and Bulgaria. When living in Geneva (where Dr. H. G. Baity was a Director in the World Health Organization), she covered the first Asiatic Conference and later political conferences as a special corre- spondent for the Greensboro (N.C.) Daily News, subsequently reporting on the work of various specialized agencies of the United Nations visited in the Middle East, South Asia, and Africa. As the director of writing workshops for nationals in the subcontinent and Africa (sponsored by the Committee for World Literacy and Christian Literature, now Intermedia), she produced six readers for use in tribal areas of West Pakistan (1954), five for use in tribal areas of the South Sudan (1955), and twenty-one for translation into Swahili and the vernacular languages of East Africa (during the workshop in Kinampanda, Tanzania, in 1956). She has surveyed population literature in East and South Asia and Oceania (1969). Among her publications are two prize-winning books for young people, Americans Before Columbus (New York: Viking Press, 1951) and America Before Man (revised edition, New York: Viking Press, 1964). In preparation are a younger- readers' book on the protohistory of the Black Sea area and reports on fire, bull, and astra rituals and iconography of the Middle East, Western Europe, and Asia. As a consultant to the Morehead Planetarium, Mrs. Baity assisted with a show on British megalithic astronomy (March-April 1972). She teaches in the African Studies Program of the University of North Carolina (Division of Political Science) and continues to be interested in population literature work. Coming from a family with strong astronomical interests extending through three generations (son William is with an astrophysics team), Mrs. Baity first grappled with the precession of the equinoxes while studying with her brothers, Hervey and Ted Chesley, at the latter's telescope and solar-system model on a Texas hilltop. Star-studying and museum research in South America, Asia, and Africa deepened the interest, leading to a dissertation study in which Ibero-Saharan astra iconography supplied clues to the solution of the distribution of protohistoric fire rituals and their survivals studied ethnographically in Spain, India, and Oceania. The present paper, submitted in final form 14 ii 72, was sent for comment to 50 scholars, of whom the following responded: Anthony F. Aveni, Rainer Berger, David A. Breter- nitz, Geoffrey A.

MacKie (1968, 1971 a,b), who is testing Thom's astronomical theories by traditional archaeological methods, prefers "archaeoastronomy." As a broader term, this appears more widely useful than the others and will be adopted here. "Ethnoastronomy" is the accepted name for a closely allied research field which merges astronomy, textual scholarship, ethnology, and the interpretation of ancient iconography for the purpose of reconstructing lifeways, astronomical techniques, and rituals. By whatever name, the new interdisciplinary studies are potentially of great sig- nificance for the insights they afford into the mental attainments of certain prehistoric, protohistoric, and early historic societies in Eurasia, Africa, and the Americas. Archaeoastronomy is a form of information recovery with time- and space-specific aspects which, when further refined and systematized, may provide not only a new theoretical framework for explicating certain problems of prehistory, but also a method of producing, ordering, analyzing, and expressing data with regard to the socioeconomic systems of particular cultures. These time- and space-specific aspects may also aid in tracing the influence of early groups whose most important seasonal rituals appear to have been set by astronomical events and recorded in rock art, on painted ceramics, and through other media. Archaeoastronomy, in the narrow sense, fo- cuses on the analysis of the orientations and measure- ments of megalithic and other monumental ancient structures, many of which, as we will see, could have served for the prediction of solar and lunar eclipses and unquestionably did serve for the determination of solstices and equinoxes, enabling the setting of dates for agricultural activities and for the ritual cycle of the year. Astronomical knowledge has afforded a prime facility for timekeeping and the determi- nation of the beginning of seasons, a function which had a cultural-economic significance to Paleolithic hunter-gatherers and which since the Neolithic has been extremely important for the successful cultiva- tion of crops (Essen 1969, Goudsmit et al. 1966, Hawkes 1962, Toulme and Goodfield 1966). This article will (1) review the debate between astronomers and archaeologists that initiated ar- chaeoastronomy as an interdisciplinary field of study, the debate concerning the possible use of Stonehenge as an astronomical observatory, and cite some of the evidence, both recent and earlier, for astronomical functions with regard to megalithic and other early structures and town plans elsewhere in the Old and New Worlds; (2) briefly review developments in time-factored art and other aspects of ethnoastron- omy; (3) note the implications of these studies for prehistorians and protohistorians; and (4) suggest areas where further study is indicated. A major function of this synthesizing review is to bring to- gether references to articles, scattered in a variety of international professional journals, that indicate possibilities for a new interdisciplinary study for which as yet virtually no indexing system exists. Only the broad conclusions of the studies bearing on ancient astronomy can be noted: these are in many cases supported by essential mathematical, engineering, astronomical, and linguistic data which cannot be summarized here. ARCHAEOASTRONOMICAL STUDIES STONEHENGE AS AN OBSERVATORY The archaeological knowledge with regard to Stone- henge in Wiltshire and other megalithic structures in the British Isles and France had by 1960 become sufficiently detailed to encourage specialists from other disciplines to attempt to assess the function these structures might have served for their builders (Atkinson 1960, Daniel 1963). The azimuths of sun and moon, unlike those of constellations, are little affected by the precession of the equinoxes.2 Thus 2Precession, a conical motion of the earth's axis around the pole of the ecliptic approximately every 25,800 years, is caused by the gravitational pull of the sun and moon on the earth's equatorial bulge. It causes a westward displacement of the vernal equinox along the ecliptic. Thus Paleolithic Eurasian observers of some 26,000 B.P., regarding a fixed directional point around which the circumpolar star groups nightly circled, would have been viewing Polaris; their descendants of half this time ago would have had a far more spectacular pole star, Vega (assuming that there has been no such shifting of landmasses as Hapgood [ 1970] hypothesizes). Precession and other astronomical concepts used in the following discussion, briefly defined in the glossary below, are explained and related to early astronomical systems in Introduc- tion to Astronomy (Payne-Gaposchkin and Haramundanis 1970). Wallenquist's (1970) astronomical dictionary is also helpful. Astronomers measure azimuth westward from the south point of the meridian, the north-south great circle passing through the zenith (the east-west great circle passing through this point being the prime vertical). (Engineering and navigation convention, in contrast, measures from true, not magnetic, north east along the horizon; cf. Thom [1967:14-33].) Four kinds of celestial coordi- nates are used in celestial surveying: (1) the horizon system, (2) the ecliptic system, (3) the equatorial system, and (4) the galactic system, which does not concern us. The horizon system serves to indicate for a celestial object its altitude, measured in degrees up toward the zenith from the horizon (with negative altitudes referring to points below the horizon), and its azimuth. On the horizon system, the altitude of the celestial north pole, now marked by our Polaris, is equal to the latitude of the observer, but the position of other heavenly bodies varies with the place and time of observation (there being no star to mark the other pole). The ecliptic system is defined by the plane of the earth's orbit, which fixes the ecliptic, the apparent yearly path of the sun through the constellations. The ecliptic intersects the plane of the celestial equator at two points, the equinoxes: called the nodes, these points are the locus of eclipses. The sun crosses the vernal equinox en route from the winter solstice, the point of its southernmost rising, to the summer solstice, the point of its northernmost rising; at the autumnal equinox, it crosses the same point (i.e., due east) returning south. The ecliptic and the celestial equator do not coincide because of the earth's tilt with reference to its orbit; the angle, called the obliquity of the ecliptic, varies over time (see n. 13). The zodiac is a cultural construct, coming to us from early astronomers of Western Asia: it is a band of constellations centered on the ecliptic and including the apparent path of the sun, moon, and planets. Certain constellations north or south of the zodiac but rising at the same time as zodiacal ones and sometimes more easily detected were called paranatellonta by the ancient Greeks and were used, like the zodiacal constellations, for determining dates. The equatorial system measures the declination of a celestial body as its angular distance from the equator towards the nearest pole, measured in degrees north (positive) or south (negative). There is a trigonometrical relation between the four angles- azimuth, declination, latitude, and altitude; knowing any three, one can find the other. For timekeeping by the stars and constellations, early astron- omers referred to the heliacal rising, the first visible rising of a star or constellation at dawn after a period of invisibility owing to its proximity to the sun, or to the heliacal setting, its first visible setting after sunset. The sidereal year ("sidereal" pertaining to stars) 390 C U R R E N T A N T H R O P O L O G Y</page><page sequence="3">Baity: ARCHAEOASTRONOMY AND ETHNOASTRONOMY sun and moon alignments marked out by megalith- builders still function to mark with fair precision the winter and summer solstices and the vernal and autumnal equinoxes, after taking into account changes in the obliquity of the ecliptic, presently diminishing by approximately 46.84 seconds of arc per century, according to Newcomb's formula (R. L. Merritt, personal communication, 26 xi 71). Stone- henge has been assumed from archaeological evi- dence to have been built in three main stages from approximately 2000 B.C. to 1500 B.C.: new dating techniques (Renfrew 1970a,b,c) indicate that its initial henge may be over half a millennium older, but that does not invalidate the tentative formulations with regard to the solar-lunar alignments, except as partic- ular postulated azimuths are affected by the fact that the obliquity of the ecliptic was slightly greater during the period of construction and use of the monument. Folklore has traditionally assigned an astronomical function to Stonehenge. Diodorus, in his History of the Ancient World, written about 50 B.C., described the spherical3 temple of Apollo in Britain and its Hyper- borean supervisors, the star-gazing Boreadae: though the connection is unproven, either with the area or the monument, there is a tendency to equate this description with Stonehenge. British folklore has immemorially associated the structure with celebra- tions attending the two hinges on which the solar year turns, the winter and summer solstices. In Scotland, similarly, tradition associates the many stone circles with solar and lunar observations. Astronomer Lockyer (1901, 1902, 1905, 1906a,b, 1965; Lockyer and Penrose 1901) was not the first observer to suggest that Stonehenge and other megalithic circles had a significant astronomical function.4 Also working is defined by the heliacal rising of a given star. The tropical year (from the Greek word for turning) is measured from solstice to solstice. The anomalistic year is measured from perihelion (the point nearest the sun) to perihelion. The three years differ in length, and this is what enabled Hipparchos, in 123 B.C., to discover the precession of the equinoxes. The synodic month or lunation is the interval from new moon to new moon. 3C. A. Newham (personal communication, 1 vii 71) and G. E. Hutchinson (personal communication, 4 iv 72) call my attention to the fact that the Greek word "spherical" has astronomical connotations. 4In the excitement generated by the Stonehenge controversy, it is often overlooked that many earlier studies anticipated the recent discoveries and hypotheses. Scholarly literature in French, English, German, Spanish, and other languages foreshadowed and supports the new subdiscipline. While this ignoring by contem- porary archaeoastronomers of earlier data has been methodol- ogically sound in that the new work has been approached indepen- dently, many early studies contain data well worth reviewing. It is to be hoped that comprehensive synthesizing studies and bibliog- raphies will soon be undertaken. The Subject Catalogue of the Peabody Museum Library, Harvard University, indexes impressive scholarship with regard to megalithic structures and astra, stone, and calendar cults. The encyclopaedias of religion discuss such cults at length: these and other well-indexed topics, including judicial and client astrology, will not be reviewed here. Lewis (1888, 1897) recognized the purposeful nature of megalithic constructions and the importance of outlying stones and studied megalithic measurements. Peet (1894) connected megaliths with mythology and showed interest in American and European stone circles (1901). Baudouin (1912), a pioneer archaeoastronomer, studied the solar orientation of rock engravings and megalithic structures, offered (1913) a technique for determining the orientation of dolmens, discussed (1917a) prehistoric stellar knowledge, and recognized (191 7b) the cultural significance of the Pleiades group (cf. Hamilton 1902, 1904). Devoir (1911) found that the megalithic structures of Brittany fit Lockyer's hypothesis of orientations directed at without benefit of electronic computation to test the relationship between proposed sighting lines and significant astra events, Somerville (1912) had noted astronomical indications for a circle at Callanish in the Outer Hebrides. Although, as the following discussion will indicate, much remarkable work on megalithic astronomy had been done by Thom (1954, 1964b) and Newham (1963, 1964), and Newham's hypothesis of lunar and solar alignments at Stonehenge had been published (cf. Emmott 1963), little of it was known even to archaeologists, much less to the general public, before the debate which followed the publication by Hawkins (1963; 1964; 1965a,b; 1966; 1968) of the compu- terized correlation of Stonehenge alignments with the rising and setting of the sun and moon at their extreme positions during the period of the construc- tion and reconstruction of the monument (fig. 1). Hawkins proposed that the Aubrey Circle may have been used to mark off, count, or compute the swing of the azimuth of the moon, functioning as an the risings at solstices, equinoxes, and intermediate points, for the determination of an agricultural calendar, and that the same hypothesis explained orientations in other areas (see also Devoir 1915-16, 1916, 1917). Jacquot (1915) noted the persistence of Breton solar cults. Lenoir (1956) surveyed what he called megalithic thinking. Boule (1930) considered the use of astronomical data in determining the age of megalithic structures. Baschmakoff (1930) summed up descriptions of the Carnac alignments, attribut- ed them to a pre-Aryan population, noted the correspondence of cromlechs with alignments indicating solstice, equinox, and midquarter points on the horizon, and interpreted a megalithic engraving as a calendar dividing the year into eight astronomically determined parts and marking the times for fetes at specific locations for each major division. (An ethnologist and not an engineer, Baschmakoff attributed the noncircular shapes and adjacent parallel lines as designating clans and a number of carvings as totemic signs; since the carving illustrated shows bull, ram, and serpent, I suggest that the corpus be restudied for possible presence of a zodiac of the Western Asian type [see below].) Foreshadowing present discussions, Baschmakoff also postulated that an elite laid out the alignments, which were then constructed by another class of workers. Cunnington (1935) studied Stone- henge; Keiller (1934) surveyed megaliths in Scotland. Roy, McGrail, and Carmichael (1963) have examined the Tormore circle, and others listed below have discussed other circles. O'Connell and Henry (1915) edited Irish astronomy. Though establishing that the contemporary association of Stone- henge with Druids is less a folk memory than the invention of antiquary William Stukeley, Piggott (1968:122-24) reviews classical data indicating for barbarian European priests a degree of astro- nomical and calendrical skill which, in view of Thom's increasing findings, suggests to me that certain of the useful techniques of megalithic time-setting survived. Caesar (De bello Gallico, book 6), borrowing from Posidonius (ca. 135-ca. 50 B.C.), attributed to the Celtic priests "much knowledge of the stars and their motions, of the size of the world and of the earth" (cf. Burn 1969:2-6); Hippolytus spoke of their ability to foretell certain events by calculations and Pliny of their measuring time by the moon. The Getae were said to have been taught by the semilegendary Dicineus "the courses of the 12 signs and of the planets passing through them, and the whole of astronomy" as well as "the names of the 356 stars" (quoted by Piggott from the 6th-centur A.D. writer Jordanes or his source Cassiodorus). The presence of a 12-house zodiac among barbarians known to the Romans is of course suspect, as Greek colonies along the coasts of Spain, the Black Sea, and elsewhere were already old by the time of Dicineus (1st century B.C.), but Iberian sources and the 5th-century B.C. periplus quoted by Avienus mention astral, solar, and lunar cults on Iberian islands and capes (cf. Arribas 1962), and other Spanish scholars cite many indications that these cults were pre-Greek. Further, there is much folkloric and archaeological evidence that "Celtiberian" solstice rituals are more strongly pre-Celtic than Celtic (Baity 1968).

In a witty, if less than enthusiastic, initial rejoinder, "Moonshine over Stonehenge," Atkinson (1966a; cf. also 1966b,c) criticized Hawkins' claims on the grounds of inappropriate site plans, inaccurate archaeological data, indiscriminate selection of stones as markers, and overconfidence in the computer, "the secular equivalent of divine revelation." Atkinson was, however, interested in the idea that the Aubrey Circle could have been used as an eclipse-predictor "provided that Hawkins' fifty-six-year cycle is acceptable to other astronomers" (which it subsequently proved not to be) and saw a suggestion of possible value in the hypothesis that whenever an observer at the center of the circle saw the full moon nearest the winter 392 C U R R E N T A N T H R O P O L O G Y</page><page sequence="5">Baity: ARCHAEOASTRONOMY AND ETHNOASTRONOMY solstice rise over the Heel Stone, it might alert him to the fact that an eclipse of the sun or moon would follow (though not all eclipses predictable from Stone- henge could be observed there). Atkinson also com- mented with interest upon Hawkins' argument that the latitude of Stonehenge appears to have been deliberately chosen so that the extreme northerly and southerly risings and settings of the sun and moon at the solstices were approximately at right angles one to another, permitting a nearly rectangular layout of the four Station Stones, a circumstance which makes this area exceptional. Newham (1966), whose hypothesis that Stonehenge was both a solar and lunar observatory had been published earlier in the year, commented that we must be grateful to Hawkins for quickening the interest of prehistorians in the early development of observational science and methods; he argued, however, that Hawkins' 56-year cycle seemed untenable. Hoyle (1966a), like Atkinson, found Hawkins' measured and calculated azimuth values outside the suggested margin of error, but suggested an even more sophisticated purposeful placing of the sighting lines a degree or so inside the azimuthal extremes at which the moon and sun appear to stand still.5 Hoyle further proposed that the Aubrey Circle may have represented an ecliptic, with Stonehenge serving as a simple protractor for measuring the angles involved with reference to solstice risings and settings and for predicting eclipses. An editorial in Nature (July 3, 1966) described the Hoyle hypothesis as "breathtaking not merely by its ingenuity, that of Professor Hoyle as well as of the supposed builders of Stonehenge, but by its practicality," adding (pro- phetically, it proved) that "the cleverness is the most difficult part of his theory to accept." To clarify the astronomical argument, Hoyle (1 966b) explained his model in trigonometry. Rephrasing the question "How did they do it?" as "How would we do it (granted Neolithic technical possibilities)?" he concluded that "an excellent proce- dure would be to build a structure of the pattern of Stonehenge, particularly Stonehenge I." To Atkin- son's question (by correspondence) why a pegboard would not have served equally well, Hoyle answered that with large stones as markers a large circle was necessary for accuracy of angle measurements and was moreover a definitive system which it is impossible to disturb by accident. He suggested that the Aubrey Circle could have been the reference studied for small pegboards. Regarding the determination of the solstices, so important in Neolithic renewal rituals set by an astronomically determined New Year, Hoyle (1 966 b:263 and fig. 1) reminded nonastronomers that the seasons are determined by the tilt in the earth's axis of rotation and have no relationship to the diurnal rotation of the earth-a fact also ignored by the 5This apparent pause that occurs when the sun or the moon reaches extreme swing and turns makes the exact time of the solstices hard to determine: as MacKie has expressed it, the notorious phenomenon of the midsummer sun rising behind the Heel Stone when viewed through the great trilithon at Stonehenge is impressive only when one knows the date of midsummer anyway. builders of Stonehenge, whose concern with the extremes of declination of the solstices of the sun and of the moon is indicated by the placement of the stones. Hoyle further suggested that the Stone- hengers had resolved the two unfortunate coinci- dences that the sun and the moon have the same apparent diameter and appear to replace each other, and that 12 lunar months roughly approximate a solar year, although the difference is great enough to throw a lunar-based calendar fairly quickly out of synchronization with the solstices and hence the seasons. The Metonic cycle (named after Greek as- tronomer Meton, whose description of it is the earliest known) affords an elementary adjustment through a cycle of 235 synodic months of 29.53 days each, or 6,939.7 days, which is practically identical with 19 tropical years of 365.2422 days each, or 6,939.6 days.6 Hoyle (1966b) suggested that Stonehengers knew that by dividing the 19 years into two sets, 12 years of 12 lunar months each and 7 of 13, an adjustment could be made. Sadler (1966) viewed as astronomically acceptable the hypothesis that Stonehenge was designed to mark the extreme and mean azimuths of the rising and setting of the sun and moon, but suggested that better methods of predicting eclipses were available. New- ham (1966) offered an alternative astronomical function for Stonehenge, suggesting that some 40 postholes in six ranks seeming to radiate from the center of the Aubrey Circle may have been temporary markers set to align on the point where the winter full moon appeared over the horizon every year: observations over a large number of years would be sufficient to ascertain the 19-year phase and possibly the 56-year eclipse cycle. He saw a strong lunar influence at Stonehenge and had little doubt that in its earlier stages it was an astronomical observatory. Colton and Martin (1967) showed that a sustained 56-year cycle does not exist. The 18-year 11 3-day Saros eclipse cycle, which is almost equal to 223 lunations, is believed to have been known to the Chaldeans and was certainly known to the Chinese (and perhaps to the Babylonians, though consensus does not exist on this). The Saros cycle was more easily detected by early observers than other eclipse cycles because each eclipse occurs close to the calendar date of the previous one.7 Colton and Martin argued 6By coincidence, the Metonic cycle of 19 tropical years corre- sponds to the 18.61 tropical years required to complete the retrograde nodal cycle of the moon (the time interval required for the moon to return to the extreme azimuths at the winter and summer solstices: the nodes are the points at which the moon's orbit crosses the plane of the earth's orbit, i.e., the ecliptic). Newham (1970:17) points out a possible connection between this and the 56 holes of the Aubrey Circle: 3 x 18.61 = 55.83. 7The relationship is: 19 eclipse years (6,585.78 days) equals nearly 223 synodic months (6,585.32 days). The difference of a fraction of a day causes each eclipse to fall west of the last by almost a third of the way around the earth. Piggott (1968) notes that the Coligny calendar, a great bronze plate engraved with a calendar of 62 consecutive lunar months with two intercalary months inserted alternately at two-and-a-half- and three-year intervals, suggests the use of the Saros eclipse cycle and the adjustment of lunar to solar dates (cf. Charriere 1960). Vol. 14 No. 4 October 1973 393</page><page sequence="6">that while the Saros cycle produces more total eclipses than some other cycles and is thus useful, other eclipse cycles, including a "more logical" 47-year sequence (others are 23, 42, and 61 eclipse years), must be considered. They noted that it has been known since the 3d millennium that for a lunar eclipse to occur the sun and the full moon must be diametrically opposed in the sky and the moon must rise a short time before the sun sets, which suggests that the Aubrey Circle and the many stone circles elsewhere could have served as protractors enabling observers in their centers to judge whether the sun and moon were exactly opposite each other. They pointed out that the method is a poor one for predicting solar eclipses. In a summarizing panel of comments on the Hoyle hypothesis (Hawkins et al. 1967), Hawkins noted the extremely far-reaching assumptions concerning intel- ligence and purpose. Atkinson found that new site data did not affect the Hoyle hypothesis substantially "as an explanation of how we could use Stonehenge to predict eclipses" and accepted the possibility that the positions of the Heel Stone and the Station Stones and the latitude of Stonehenge were astronomically determined. He criticized the use of some of the holes suggested as markers, as did Newham, who favored the alignment with winter solstices but reject- ed others. Thom agreed that the astronomers' evi- dence that Stonehenge was a solar and lunar obser- vatory equated with his hypotheses (resulting from 30 years of surveying megalithic sites) with regard to the precision of megalithic engineering and as- tronomy, but did not accept the Aubrey Stones as the eclipse-predictor Hawkins had seen. Newham summed up arguments against the Aubrey Circle as an eclipse-predictor, though affirming the Stone- hengers' interest in eclipses. Defending the hithertofore accepted archaeological view, Hawkes (1967) challenged Stonehenge as Apol- lo's circular temple, dismissed the Aubrey Circle as an eclipse-predictor (on the grounds that the holes were refilled soon after they were dug and show no evidence of ever having held stones), fitted Stone- henge harmoniously into British, European, and Mediterranean history, and-unwarned by King Canute's unsatisfactory experience-dismissed the "nouveau vague" flowing over Stonehenge by reaf- firming the monument as a sanctuary, its structure as architectural rather than mechanical, and its orien- tation as symbolic rather than astronomical. The new wave, not so easily dismissed, flowed back in New- ham's (1970) counter-reappraisal, a succinct, origin- al, and plausible summary of Stonehenge man's probable astronomical experiments and in capsule form the young archaeoastronomer's guide to site surveys. Feeling that astronomers had overstated Stonehenger astronomical skills less than archae- ologists had understated them, Newham turned his attention to three recently discovered "disturbances" situated in the adjoining carpark. In view of Thom's many discoveries of "distant markers" (usually moun- tain gaps or other skyline features, which are remark- ably lacking on the Stonehenge skyline), Newham calculated that had tree trunks some 30 ft. high been placed in the "disturbances" they would have served as precise, nonreversible distant markers with regard to important setting phenomena of sun and moon when observed from the four Stations and the Heel Stone position. Site excavation data (then unknown to Newham) indicates that the holes once held tree trunks some 2 ft. 6 in. in diameter supported by wedges.8 Newham analysed the possible significance of the Aubrey holes in relation to astronomical phe- nomena, not only in number but also in their align- ments and spacing, suggesting that the 56 holes could have been dug to hold posts serving their brief time in an experimental "trial-and-error" process and then abandoned when found inadequate for the hoped-for purposes. Robinson (1970), agreeing with Atkinson that al- though the axis and Avenue were oriented to the summer-solstice sunrise the Heel Stone did not in fact mark the midsummer precisely, has advanced the hypothesis that instead it marked the full moon when it rose at the winter solstice point, thus serving a most important function as a winter eclipse-warning moonrise marker. The hypothesis gives a functional explanation of why the Heel Stone is set slightly south of the center of the Avenue: rising slightly to the left, the midsummer sun hung just above the hori- zon when passing directly above the Heel Stone. In suggesting that other alignment "errors" could be reduced by associating stones and archways with the moon rather than with the sun, Robinson agrees with Newham's initial hypothesis. Newham (1968:9, 1970:15) has since given much independent data with regard to the strong possibility of lunar functions of the structure. Whatever the final decision as to the motives and skills of megalith-builders, the Stonehenge contro- versy and its aftermath have shown the necessity for interdisciplinary work in archaeology, for adequate summaries in national journals of ongoing research elsewhere, and for wider recognition of the contribu- tions made to archaeoastronomy by professionals in other disciplines. To illustrate both points, no British commentator known to me refers to CharriZere's (196 1) earlier analysis of Stonehenge, which anticipated the argument that consideration should be given to its interesting site in a narrow zone where the maximum azimuths of sun and moon could be indicated by the right-angle construction of the Station Stones. CharriZere also observed the repetition of the number 19 in connection with the bluestones, relating it both to the fact that the nodes of the lunar orbit rotate relative to the place of the ecliptic in approximately 19 years (actually a retrograde nodal cycle of 18.61 tropical years) and to Diodorus' account of Apollo's visit every 19 years to his spherical temple, where he sang and played his zither the night through from 8The use of tall tree trunks for distant markers is supported by the finding of early British boats indicating quite surprising timber sizes and woodworking skills (Wright and Churchill 1965). I have elsewhere (Baity 1971a) noted the extreme significance of posthole data which might indicate the former presence of posts serving as distant markers. 394 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="7">Baity: ARCHAEOASTRONOMY AND ETHNOASTRONOMY Lhe spring equinox to the rising of the Pleiades.9 Himself an architect, Charriere noted the architec- tural parallels between the orientations of the French megalithic monuments, including tombs, and those of Etruscan, early Roman, and Christian sacred edi- fices.10 Moreover, Charriere (1963, 1964, 1966, Char- riere and Roos 1964) attaches as much importance to lunar orientations as do Thom and Newham, attributing so-called errors in orientation to a pur- poseful and highly sophisticated skill which in his view reconciled lunar and solar calendars and set "intermediate" (neither solstice nor equinox) dates for festivals, as Thom has established in his studies of the megalithic calendar. Charriere (1963) notes the singular resemblance in form between the design of Stonehenge and that of the far later calendric circle and horseshoe monument at Sarmizegetusa in Romania, more fully described by Daicoviciu (1960). " Time has already indicated that the most revolu- tionary and valuable aspect of the Stonehenge debate has been its introduction to archaeologists of the radical, innovative, and extremely precise work of engineer Alexander Thom. It is impossible to review Thom's 30-year self-dedicated task: his summarizing books (1967, 1971) are required reading for anyone concerned with archaeoastronomy. Thom's (1967) study supports with statistics and numerous clear illustrations his argument that British noncircular stone rings were not carelessly designed circles, but deliberate, purposeful, and experimental demon- strations of mathematical concepts, including the use 9The Diodorus text is supposed to have been derived from an account by Hecataeus probably written around 500 B.C., at which time the tradition may already have been ancient. R. S. Newell (cf. Newham 1964:15-16) obtained from astronomer F. Addey the information that around 1500 B.C. the Pleiades would have been almost in conjunction with the sun, rising unseen shortly after sunrise. As neither the computers nor the astronomers are programmed for cultural lag, no account is taken of the fact that the tradition may have originated at an earlier date, perhaps when the Pleiades were linked to the Bull. Hartner (1965:4-5) considers that the heliacal rising symbols were established around the time of the first Elamite and Mesopotamian settlements (ca. 4000 B.C.), when Taurus, Leo, and Scorpio (roughly 900 apart) preceded the sunrise at the spring equinox, summer solstice, and autumnal equinox respectively by ca. 1 025' and thus were the last visible zodiacal risings. The probable time of the construction of the circular ditch at Stonehenge I was around 3000 B.C. (Renfrew 1970), at which time the heliacal rising of Taurus marked the spring equinox in the Mesopotamian zodiac. There is no evidence (known to me) that the British megalithic astronomers used such a zodiac, but the Diodorus text is thought-provoking. '0Though it is peripheral to this study, I note the significance of Borst's (1966-69) suggestion that a megalithic structure gave its plan to Canterbury Cathedral, a hypothesis with which Barmore (1969) and MacKie (personal communication, 29 ii 72) do not agree. In Iberia and elsewhere churches mark many a pre-Christian shrine; in Mesoamerica, many a pyramid. 11I am indebted to Daicoviciu (personal communication, 29 x 71) for the following information: "Besides the great circular sanctuary, at Sarmizegetusa there is a small circular sanctuary, and another, with limestone pillars, was found at Felele Albe, in the neighbourhood of Sarmizegetusa, and a third one with wood pillars at Pecica (ancient Ziridava); this latter one has been published by I. H. Crisan in Acta Musei Napocensis (Cluj) 3:91-101. We do not know the origin of this type of sanctuary, though it seems to be a marvellous resurrection of the megalithic monu- ments. Its circular shape might be a result of its connection with the seemingly circular motion of the Sun, or with the discoidal aspect of the Sun and of the Moon. I believe that the importance of this kind of sanctuary lies in the fact that it proves the existence of a serious preoccupation of the Dacians with astronomy, and of an original calendar based on their own observations." of Pythagorean triangles, in the service of advanced observational astronomy or perhaps as a parallel intellectual study. His (1971) further examination of Scottish sites indicates that "lunar observatories" had a far more searching function than that of calendar correction and date-setting for New Year's and other rituals, which activities may, he suggests, have become mere routine fund-raising projects supporting a sci- entific study of the moon's motions. Thom (1971:147) demonstrates the possibility that through the use of temporary markers placed during observations of the rising and setting orbs sliding past small, clean-cut distant marks (mountain con- tours or precisely aligned megaliths), megalithic as- tronomers were able to indicate mean differences with their stone markers (hence the "errors" reported by modern students who fail to take into account the sophistication of the megalithic observatories). From many thousands of precise measurements, Thom deduces a standard measurement unit, the megalithic yard (MY) of 2.720 ? .003 ft. (Thom 1968:43), subdivided by a smaller unit, 1/40 MY, appearing in connection with cup-and-ring rock carv- ings and forming part of a larger unit of 2 2 MY (i.e., 6.80 ft.).'2 Though he has not worked at Stone- 12Thom's megalithic yard has aroused much interest among students of ancient metrology. Hammerton (1971), studying Thom's (1967: table 5.1) table of values of the site unit at 145 sites, suggests that Thom's "megalithic fathom" has a range value which does not suggest a standard issued from a center: he advances the theory that the site unit was based on the height of the engineer-priest in charge (or of a local dignitary). In view of Muller's evidence of similar "egg-shaped" structures, orientations, and measurements in Germany as well as in Britain (and France), the "chief's height" hypothesis may afford more problems than it solves. Fletcher (1969), in a typescript which Robert L. Merritt has sent me along with other papers from his collection on megalithic astronomy, links the megalithic yard with ancient measures identified by Petrie and others, concluding that it and the megalithic fathom (5.44 ft.) were not mere upstart British- French standards but were part of a major metric system common to the ancient Mediterranean and Middle Eastern civilizations and related to an empirical prescientific geometry. Newham (personal communication, 1 vii 71) does not, however, find that the MY consistently applies at Stonehenge, though in some instances it coincides with his "moon-swing" long measure (LM) of 47.6 ft. (17? MY), and this discrepancy leads him to question whether the builders of Stonehenge were the same as those responsible for other megalithic structures. Newham's work, like Thom's, offers the possibility of archaeological proof, as he predicts that certain alignments must be found in as yet unexcavated areas of the site. He cites a large depression in a field to the southeast (in the position of a stone shown in an early etching) which centers exactly 13 LM from the Sarsen center, aligning with moonrise seen from Aubrey Hole 28 (where a stone was supposed to have been) and also with other significant sun and moonrise positions. Newham's question with regard to the identity of the Stonehenge builders is of interest in connection with the fact that the diagonals of the four Station Stones, which cross at the center of the Sarsen Circle of Stonehenge II to form a rectangle about 105 by 260 ft., did not do so in the time of Stonehenge I, but centered about 3 ft. southwest of the common center. Stecchini's (cf. Tompkins 1971) study indicating the precision of 3d-millennium Egyptian measurements affords much data for comparative studies. Eberhard's (personal communication, 21 iv 72) reference to Chinese links between astronomical and musical concepts is significant (cf. n. 23), as are his references to studies of early Chinese metrology: "On Chinese measurements we have a number of studies in Chinese. They have found some early measures and by using these they have been giving interpretations to texts. Some references (but by no means the most important ones-those I do not have at hand): Monumenta Serica 6:357; Bulletin of Chinese Studies (Ch'eng-tu) 1:93; T'oung Pao 35:246; Oriental Art 2:1, 46; T6yo^ Gakuho^ 35:1-30."

(Reprinted from Thon and Thor 1971:150, by permission of the Journal for the History of Astronomy.) henge, Thomr (1968:28) has surveyed Woodhenge, which he sees as a possible example of mathematical experiment. Among the lacunae in the Stonehenge debate, as suggested above, is the failure to consider the astro- nomical alignments of the French megalithic struc- tures suggested by a number of French archaeologists (Niel 1961, 1970; Savary 1966). The inevitable ques- tion whether the highly impressive megalithic sites of Brittany, remarkably concentrated in the Carnac area (Giot 1960), show the same astronomical and metrical patternss o British megaliths has led Thom (1970a; Thom and Thom 1971, 1972) and colleagues to make site surveys and orientation studies of several thousand Breton megaliths or menhirs. At Carnac, a huge lunar observatory spread over a wide territory surrounding Quiberon Bay was centered on the greatest menhir in Europe, Er Grah (Le Grand Menhir Brise), which, as Thom and his colleagues show, could have served as a universal foresight used by stations located in several different directions (see fig. 2). Measuring at least 67 ft. and weighing over 340 tons, this menhir appears to have been brought from the west coast of the Quiberon Peninsula on a prepared track with rollers, a task doubtless requiring decades of work following those necessary to locate a suitable site. Several commentators on Thom's astronomical hy- potheses have objected to the process of starting with the known menhir position, on the grounds that some apparent celestial target can always be indicated (an objection which begs the point that the targets may have had some functional role to play in ceremoni- alism). In the first study of the Carnac alignments (Thorn and Thorn 1971), Thorn predicted that Er Grah could have served as a universal foresight and estimated on which lines focusing on Er Grah observ- ing stations must have been located. His team searched for and found five of the eight predicted stations (cf. fig. 2). Thom further hypothesized that the rows of stones at Petit Menec and at St. Pierre must have been used as extrapolating sectors, as he had suggest- ed for similar rows at Caithness (Thom 1970a). A further objective in the first Brittany survey was to ascertain the geometrical layout of the various sites and to determine the problem which the Carnac alignments had been laid out to solve. As most of the stones had been reerected, with possible inaccura- cies, the first task was to determine by surveys and statistical analyses the original designs and the unit of measurement employed. The second survey, in March of 1972, further tested and confirmed these hypotheses (Thom and Thom 1972). The surveys establish that reerection of stones has been sufficiently accurate to permit statistical analyses indicating the geometrical designs laid out by the builders. The analyses indicated that the Le Menec west and east cromlechs are Type 1 and 2 megalithic egg-shaped rings, based on 3,4,5 triangles of the type previously studied in Scotland (Thom and Thom 1971). The standard megalithic unit of measurement used was 2 2 megalithic yards (called by Thom a megalithic rod). The Brittany studies indicate a remarkable uniformity of the measuring unit, which Thom esti- mates must have been a rod measuring 6.802 ? 0.002 ft. The remarkable closeness of this to the British unit indicates an accuracy today attained only by trained surveyors using good modern equipment. The high degree of organization and administration responsible for the impressive Breton alignments and the presence in Brittany and Scotland of identical units suggests a common culture. Which area was the center of this culture? The extensive remains in Brittany are suggestive, but Thom and Thom indicate that so far none of the Breton sites examined affords a geometry comparable to that of Avebury. Thom suggests that the continual use of observatories like those in Argyllshire and Caithness may have presented problems the solution of which was found at Carnac. The Brittany alignments have also been surveyed by Hulle (1942, 1967) and by Rennes- Beaulieu (H. Alimen, personal communication, 4 xii 70), neither of whose reports are available to me. The Crucuno rectangle (near Erdeven-en-Morbihan), cited by Charriere (1964:166) as a structure in which the diagonals indicated the rising and setting points of the sun at the first and last gleam at summer and winter solstices, has been surveyed and studied by Thom, Thom, Merritt, and Merritt (see pp. 450- 54 of this issue). Thom (1970a,b; Thom and Thom 1971, 1972) has determined by statistically analyzed surveys that Brit- ish/Breton Neolithic astronomers were capable of determining complex lunar movements by means of stakes put into the ground at successive observations near the major (maximum) and minor (minimum) standstills, thus obtaining an eclipse-warning system. 13 3Not only does the moon complete its solstice swings monthly rather than yearly as the sun does, but the angle of arc is not precisely the same from month to month for reasons which include both the obliquity of the ecliptic and the fact that the inclination of the moon's orbit (i) is subject to a small oscillation: as Thom (1970 b :93) describes it, "The lunar orbit is inclined at i = 50 08' 43" to the ecliptic. The line of the nodes rotates relative to the equinox in 18.613 years. So in this period, the inclination 396 C U RRE NT AN TH ROPOLOG Y</page><page sequence="9">Baity: ARCHAEOASTRONOMY AND ETHNOASTRONOMY In a rare flight of fancy, Thom and Thom (1971:158) visualize the work involved: We must now try to think of how a position was found for Er Grah which would have satisfied the requirements. Increasingly careful observations of the Moon had probably been made for hundreds of years. These would have revealed unexplained anomalies due to variations in paral- lax and refraction, and so it may have been considered necessary to observe at the major and minor standstills at both rising and setting. At each standstill there were 10 or 12 lunations when the monthly declination maximum and minimum could be used. At each maximum or mini- mum, parties would be out at all possible places trying to see the Moon rise or set behind high trial poles. At night these poles would have needed torches at the tops because any other marks would not be visible until actually silhouetted on the Moon's disc. Meantime some earlier existing observatory must have been in use so that erectors could be kept informed about the kind of maximum which was being observed; they would need to know the state of the perturbation. . . . Then there would ensue the nine years of waiting till the next standstill when the other four sites were being sought. The process of establishing the maximum points was further complicated by the fact that the ris- ing and setting times only occasionally coincide with the moon's monthly declination maximum. Thom (1970b:96) shows how megalithic astronomers solved this by setting stakes on several successive nights near the solstice, from them calculating the maximum position by extrapolation; he interprets the grids and fans of carefully placed small stones found alike in Britain and Brittany as devices (computers) to aid in this extrapolation. Thom's system, though discussed in a simple and lucid prose and illustrated with explicit drawings, demands a high degree of mathematical, engineering, and astronomical knowledge: as yet few archaeologists have responded to the challenge. MacKie (1969:11) analyzes this resistance, noting unarguably that "scholars are only human beings and may be motivat- ed by things other than purely rational, objective of the orbit to the equator goes through a complete cycle between (e = i) and (E - i) where E is the obliquity of the ecliptic." Megalithic astronomers appear to Thom to have been able by means of stakes and stones (empirical mathematics) to determine the moon's nodal cycle and its maxima, thus enabling eclipse prediction, as eclipses can occur only at the two points called nodes (knots) where the moon's orbit crosses that of the sun along the plane of the ecliptic. The inclination is at a maximum when the sun is passing a node. For about a year, the declination maxima do not range over more than 20', a period Thom calls a major standstill; a minor standstill will occur 9.3 years later. As Thom points out, for the past several years the rising and setting points of the moon have ranged over very wide arcs, far to the north and then, two weeks later, far to the south; the maxima of both cycles coincided in 1969, producing a high peak which will not be equalled for many millennia: it will gradually decrease for nine years until it obtains a minimum value, after which it will again increase. In megalithic times, when the obliquity of the ecliptic was half a degree greater than today, this action was more pronounced, with a spectacular result: to an observer in the north of the Hebrides the moon was for a few days circumpolar, never setting at all (Thom 1970a:901). This striking phenomenon, as seen from megalithic observatories near the Arctic Circle, such as Callanish (cf. Thom 1967:122-28, fig. 11.1; Hawkins 1965b), might well have given rise to the tradition repeated by Diodorus that in the time of Apollo's visits to his spherical temple the moon came closer to the earth (i.e., swung nearer the horizon in a circumpolar sweep). thought.. . . none of us are astronomers; none of us possess the detailed knowledge of the motions of the celestial sphere without which one simply cannot know where to look for evidence of prehistoric astronomy." He explains why the usual type of ar- chaeological evidence is irrelevant and observes that the astronomical function of the standing stones can only be deduced by testing the designs against various hypotheses of geographical design and astronomical function. He questions, however, the use of statistical analyses based on a large number of orientations abstracted from different sites, concluding (MacKie 1969:11): Though some of the details are open to discussion I find the geometrical and astronomical theories basically quite convincing, mainly because of the way in which they are developed. . . . Here is a vast amount of information, painstakingly collected over many years-plans of sites and carefully measured potential alignments in them. When one has enough of such information it begins to fall into patterns of its own accord when analyzed in various ways. The patterns are real and we must accept them. If we do not like the conclusions drawn from the patterns then we must think of better ones, but it is impossible to ignore the new data in any future assessment of Neolithic Britain. Heggie (1972) commends Thom's hypotheses and, above all, the meticulous detail that characterizes his reduction of the data, source material that will be useful to other workers. Discussing the monthly maximum declination of the moon, Heggie points out that although it changes from month to month over a period of 19 years, the limits are almost the same for some centuries, so that it would have been worthwhile to record the corresponding positions on the horizon. Asking "Is there any indication that records of some of these points still exist in the megalithic sites?", he answers that, to his mind, Thom has shown this quite conclusively. Many alignments appear to him to fit the hypothesis that they were erected to indicate the points at which very bright stars rose and set. Heggie suggests a minor improve- ment on Thom's theoretical derivation of "G" in the analysis of the fan-shaped alignments which appear to have been used for extrapolation and concludes (p. 48): Thom's evidence that megalithic man observed the moon is so strong that it may be accepted without hesitation. That he also used extrapolation seems to be indicated by the evidence of the stone fans of Caithness and elsewhere. The data on which Thom bases his assertion that the builders of the monuments established accurate sightlines for several interesting declinations, implying a knowledge of its motion that was not to be improved upon for over three thousand years, may have been interpreted incorrect- ly. . . . Much interesting material for feeding research in this subject may be found in Professor Thom's writings. The fact that few others have repeated his work should be understood as a symptom, not of doubts as to its value, but of the enormous effort that must be expended if Thom's standards are to be maintained. Vol. 14 - No. 4 October 1973 397</page><page sequence="10">Hutchinson (1972a), in a summary review of Thom's geometrical arguments, applies a type-A flattened circle to the plan of Castle Rigg and a type-B flattened circle to a plan of Long Meg and her Daughters, demonstrating that a reverse fit is not possible. He suggests that the term "stone ring" be used in place of "stone circle," in view of the many noncircular rings with geometric aspects. He further suggests that slight irregularities attributed to frost heaving or to variations in the tension of measuring lines might instead be due to work by two groups, the ritual laying out of the sacred enclosure having perhaps been done by people of superior intellectual capacities using geometrical procedures as part of a philosophical-religious orientation similar to that of the Pythagoreans, the subsequent construction having been left to less skilled hands. In his review of Thom's astronomical arguments, Hutchinson (1972b) suggests that the distribution of solar calen- drical declinations, with maxima at the solstices but with the next mode one megalithic month or sixteenth of a year (in Thom's suggested megalithic calendar) from the winter solstice, may represent a precaution in case of bad weather at the solstice. In this study of Thom's astronomy, it is stressed that the search for possible central observing points is a next step; Hutchinson finds that Thom's general conclusions appear to stand, though lunar computations may involve arbitrary identifications. The sight lines to Capella imply dates later than the majority of C'4- dated structures, if the bristlecone pine calibration (see below) is accepted. Hutchinson is impressed with the earliness of elaborate geometrical constructions: he suggests that these may represent the fusion of an older chamber-tomb megalithic architecture with a geometry worked out on a smaller scale using perishable material. MacKie (personal commu- nication, 29 ii 71) finds Hutchinson's suggestion that the geometric designs may have been worked out by a separate group (and then translated into archi- tecture by workers who did not fully understand the geometry) of interest in connection with his study of brochs, stone tower forts with nonutilitarian geo- metrical plans incorporated in them, which show what appear to be sudden departures from the precise geometrical plans indicated. To some commentators, Thom's data suggest other conclusions. Hogg (1968) accepts the astronomy and the measurements, but suggests another unit in place of Thom's megalithic yard. Crampton (1967) and others have argued that Stonehenge was in fact never a sacred structure totally open to the sky, but instead was a roofed and walled kingly center. Burl's (1971 a) survey of the corpus of British stone circles (which has a most useful comprehensive bibliography) 4 has led him to assign a directional rather than an astro- nomical function to circles and outliers (see also Burl 1971b:49). He also cites new evidence for domestic 14I am indebted to Burl (personal communication, 27 viii 71) for the following references dealing with stone circles in Britain and Ireland: Browne (1921), Bushell (1911), Coles (1909), Fahy (1959, 1961, 1962), Hyslop (1912), Lewis (1878-1914), Morrow (1915), Somerville (1909a, b, 1912, 1922, 1923, 1925, 1929, 1930), Watson (1900), and Worth (1953). occupation of certain of the henge sites. This does not, however, necessarily disqualify them for astro- nomical use: astronomer-priests elsewhere have lived in or near their observatories. The reference of Dio- dorus to the royal and priestly Boreadae in charge of Apollo's spherical temple, "of whom the succession has never been broken," suggests a perhaps very ancient tradition of custodianship. Burl's (1969a,b) further finding that only 17 of the 83 henges studied have stone circles within them again does not-at the present stage-disqualify them; stone circles in stony treeless areas and wood post circles in agricul- tural areas could equally have demarked the sacred area and served for sighting lines. In a well-docu- mented study of diminutive and late stone circles called "four-posters," Burl (1971 b) suggests that the people who built them, apparently for burial pur- poses, had left their homeland in search of lebensraum when the earlier society that could undertake vast building works began to split into small family groups interring their dead in family vaults or simple flat cemeteries. Kendall (1971) discusses Thom's major hypotheses and suggests a number of checks, not all at present possible because of changes in the objective astro- nomical facts since megalithic times. With regard to his emphasis on the number of sight lines afforded by the notches in hill country, it must be remembered that, even aside from settlement patterns and vagaries of topography, the megalithic elite enjoyed an ex- tremely long period of time for experimental stake- setting and undoubtedly tested various sites before erecting the stone markers. The basic question is whether or not the "astronomical observatories" ex- isted: the exactitude of Thom's methods of declination refinement, as shown not only in the corpus of his work but in the accuracy of prediction his methods afford, puts a weighty burden of disproof on those who wish to deny this. Cowan (1970) extends Thom's argument with re- gard to the sophisticated design of megalithic circles: he favors, however, the use of stakes and a rope, rather than two standard-length rods as Thom proposes (1967:32), and his theory assumes that two anchor stakes and two other pivot stakes were used in the construction of each ring and that they were aligned at right angles; he concludes that the mega- lithic geometers knew rudimentary trigonometry and simple topology, had a standard length, and had developed a unique method of geometric construc- tion. The determination of the presence or absence of postholes in astronomically significant locations, and of man-made observation platforms, is required to establish astronomical-mathematical function, and this, as Thom stresses, is one of archaeoastronomy's first tasks. To carry out such a test, MacKie (197 1b,c) has worked at Kintraw, where Thom (1967:154; 1971:36-38) has surveyed a site which he designates as a highly accurate solstitial observatory which also could have given megalithic observers an acculrate lunar eclipse-warning station (Thorn 1971 :65; see also Thorn's [1971:26, 107] imaginary dialogue in which a megalithic astronomer teaches an apprentice how 398 C U R R E N T A N T H R O P O L O G Y</page><page sequence="11">Baity: ARCHAEOASTRONOMY AND ETHNOASTRONOMY 223.

Thom estimates that at the site of the Kintraw cairn and menhir, a small portion of the upper limb of the setting sun at the winter solstice, after it had set behind Beinn Shiantaidh, would flash momentarily in the col. By moving rapidly across the line of sight, an observer (or a row of stationary observers) could mark with a stake the precise stop from which this could be viewed: the stakes set for several successive nights would have moved first to the right (just before the solstice), then to the left (after the solstice), the extreme right-hand point marking the solstice. The site, however, afforded a problem to megalithic as- tronomers which has provided the test needed by contemporary archaeologists. It is situated on a small plateau on a very steep hillside, and from its surface the mountain target is hidden by a nearby foreground ridge. To enable the col to be seen, Thom theorized, it had been necessary to establish an observation platform on a steep hillside to the north of the plateau and across a deep and almost impassable gorge, so that the exact location of a flat-topped cairn which would bring the col into sight could be determined (fig. 3). A search at the site of the hypothesized platform revealed a stone platform at the edge of which two boulders afforded a notch suitable for viewing the col. The archaeological problem of estab- lishing whether this platform was man-made or had been formed by natural processes-by accumulation of fallen scree behind fortuitiously placed boulders or by natural solifluction in glacial times-has been complicated by the absence of charcoal usable for radiocarbon dating, datable artifacts, or pollen (the latter suggests postglacial times but is badly pre- served). The scree hypothesis can be dismissed: the slope of scree would have been far steeper. MacKie (1971c) brought a soil scientist to determine by mea- suring the angle and dip of the long axes of 100 adjacent stones whether these were nonrandom (as in a solifluxed layer) or random (as in a man-made layer). The test and other evidence strongly suggest that the layer is man-made: further testing should be conclusive. If so, the astronomical interpretation of the site will have been independently vindicated and Thom's theory of sophisticated prehistoric astro- nomical work supported by implication. Before leaving the British-Breton megalithic as- tronomy controversy to consider the astronomical significance of other archaeological sites, we must review another revolution in prehistory, that occa- sioned by Renfrew's (1968; 1970a,b,c) application to megalithic Britain and to Neolithic Europe of the bristlecone pine tree-ring correction of radiocarbon dates. Briefly, the 5,000-year dendrochronology ob- tained from the study of the rings of this California tree has been compared by Suess (1967) and others (cf. Stuiver and Suess 1965) to radiocarbon determi- nations made upon its wood, leading to the discovery that radiocarbon dates before 2000 B.C. may be up to some 700 years too young (Delibrias, Guillier, and Labeyrie 1970; Nature 228:1019-20). To shift West- ern European cultures formerly dated to the 3d millennium back some 700 years would alter radically the relative chronological positions of the Near East and Europe, making untenable the accepted archae- ological theory that European skills were derived from the Near East. Egyptian chronology, based on histori- cal records astronomically dated by the heliacal risings of Sirius (the Egyptian year-bringer Sothis), remains unchanged: in fact, the revised radiocarbon dates are in better agreement than older ones with Egyp- tian astra-determined historical chronology (MacKie 1970: figs. 1 and 2). Minoan and Mycenaean chronol- ogies, obtained by cross-dating with Egyptian artifacts, also remained unchanged. In Western Europe, however, in the absence of historical records recent dating has been based on radiocarbon determinations. Now at one stroke the megalithic structures of Malta, of Los Millares and other early Iberian sites, and Western European megalithic structures may have to be dated around or before 3000 B.C., draping some of these monuments in a venerable antiquity outranking that of the Egyp- tian pyramids, not to mention the voyages of the Myceanaean traders whose building skills have been suggested as a model for those evident at Stonehenge. The British structures so far dated by archaeoastron- omy (primarily by Thom) appear to cluster around 2100-1600 B.C.,15 which is not greatly earlier than 15 Newham (personal communication, 1 VII 71) states that reliable dating appears possible where very accurate survey data is available: Vol. 14 - No. 4 October 1973 399</page><page sequence="12">the C "4-determined and archeologically accepted es- timates for Stonehenge II and III. Renfrew (1971) estimates that Stonehenge I, the henge ditch, may, however, have been in construction around 2930- 2550 B.C. and Aubrey Hole 32 around 2500-1900 B.C. The new bristlecone pine dating is in better agreement with recent archaeological studies which have proposed British origins for the designs of many of the megalithic structures and also falls into line with some previously unaccepted dates. MacKie (1969:6) notes that a possible date of 2900-2600 B.C. in real (i.e., calibrated C 14) years for the Phase I henge at Stonehenge is exceeded by the dates of other henges; the vast ring ditch enclosing several circular settings of posts at Durrington Walls yields radiocarbon dates equivalent to about 3400-3100 B.C., while Arminghall appears to have been constructed between 3000 and 2800 B.C.; thus the three henge monuments are a millennium or so older than the period of the stone circles deduced on astronomical grounds, and appear to be contemporaneous with the Old Kingdom and the great pryamids. As MacKie notes, the henges will provide a crucial test for the reliability of the astronomical theory of the purposeful construction of the Neolithic rings: if they indicate this older dating, the theory will be vindicated; if not, some other explanation must be found for the uniformity of Thom's evidence with regard to the megalithic structures (cf. Atkinson 1967, 1969). In summary, weighing together the many well-doc- umented analyses made by the several participants in the Stonehenge debate and their most generous responses to my own questions, I am inclined to set aside such exasperated personal comments from them as "the astronomers and the archaeologists are not speaking the same language" and "a brilliant and explosive theory has gone rocketing ahead without anything like critical control." By 1972 a rapid growth of mutual understanding and of critical control is quite evident, and there is increasingly well-informed opinion that Stonehenge (and many other ancient monuments) not only could have been used for so- phisticated observations and predictions of astra events ("astra" being a shorthand expression for all the celestial bodies), including eclipses and moon perturbations, but probably were so used. That they were used precisely as theorized by Hawkins and Hoyle is not accepted, and an understandable and mutually educational scholarly exchange continues, in which archaeologists and others in various areas are now engaging. The outcome of this standard scientific procedure promises to be the addition of astronomy to the archaeologists' conceptual tools, even more scrupulous attention to accurate recon- structions and to the construction of precise site e.g., at Stonehenge, the 91 station to No. I carpark hole gives a sun declination corresponding to 1700 B.C. + 200 years. Dating by the sun is only possible when it is at the solstice: once this is known at a particular site where intermediate alignments also exist, it is possible to calculate the day of the year to which they will apply. Merritt (1968) shows that megalithic astronomy establishes dates which invalidate the hypothesis of Velikovsky that Venus entered the sun's planetary family as a comet well after the first historical records were made. maps, adequately documenting the presence of outly- ing stones, postholes, and distant markers, and the acknowledgement of the necessity for cooperation between archaeologists, astronomers, engineers, and others. EVIDENCE OF ASTRONOMICAL FUNCTIONS FOR OTHER EARLY STRUCTURES The possible earlier dating of the megalithic struc- tures, considered in connection with the hypotheses with regard to their astronomical-mathematical func- tion, focuses interest on megalithic structures in other areas than Britain and Brittany. Muller's (1970) ad- mirably concise presentation of Thom's hypotheses extends the range of similar structures to Central Europe, indicating for this area an early interest in astra orientation and calendar sites. If archaeologists in Central Europe and beyond confirm this further extension of Thom's megalithic measurements and orientations and agree with his astronomical hypoth- eses (while perhaps disagreeing with him in some details), then clearly archaeoastronomy will have proved its value. Mennevee (1960) suggests that the rarity of mega- liths in Italy may be due to the comparative rarity of suitable rocks: he reproduces iconography (rock art and stelae) and compares the distributions of megaliths, bell beakers, and metal deposits exploited in prehistoric times. Rojer Grosjean (personal com- munication, 14 xi 70) reports that no archaeoastro- nomical hypotheses have been tested in Corsica but notes that Corsica's anthropomorphic stelae face east, as if facing the rising sun at the equinox. Less archaic monuments in Sardinia and the Balearic Islands were, he suspects, "temples de feu," either for incineration of the dead, for burning of offerings, or as the site of ritual repasts. (Evidence from Iberia to India indicates to me that fire rituals, symbolically related to solar events and accompanied by bull rituals and bull sacrifice, were a part of a New Year's sacred drama cycle [Baity 1962, 1968].) Barandiaran (personal communication, 7 xi 71) notes that the almost 400 dolmens in the Basque country for the most part face east, though some are oriented to the south and a few to the northeast; this suggests patterned behavior concentrating on the rising sun at the equinoxes and solstices. Basque tombs have similar orientation, as do the more recent Basque illarri (death stones), the designs of which have long suggested to me solar-stellar symbols. Barandiaran fully documents this symbolism and shows that swas- ticas also appear: moreover, the stones appear to him to match the myths (Barandiaran 1960, 1970). At present there are few C14 dates for Iberia; I am thus unable to compare the date of Iberian megaliths with the high Breton dates in the time range 3500- 3000 B.C. that are now substantiated (Delibrias, Guil- lier, and Labeyrie 1970; cf. Nature 228:1019-20), making it appear possible that collective burial in megalithic chamber-tombs was known to the first immigrant farmers who reached Britain around 3500 B.C. (or, in calibrated C'4 dating or real years, around 4200 B.C.): it also appears possible that the tradition 400 C U RRE NT AN TH ROPOLOG Y</page><page sequence="13">Baity: ARCHAEOASTRONOMY AND ETHNOASTRONOMY of astronomical alignments for burials came as part of the funerary complex. Burl (personal communication, 8 VIII 71) indicates that stone circles are reported in connection with megaliths in Galicia and elsewhere (calling attention to Leisner and Leisner 1956, among others), but no reports known to me indicate whether Thom's hy- potheses have been tested in this rich area, the significance of which to archaeoastronomy is indicated not only by its megaliths and metals but also by its African and Anatolian prehistoric connections. Should Iberian megaliths demonstrate orientations and measurements similar to those of Britain and Brittany, the attempt to construct a megalithic calen- dric ritual cycle might profit from the remarkable richness of Iberian folkloric survivals and scholarship: most extensive bibliographies are available in the works of Caro Baroja (1958) and Barandiaran (1960, 1970). The "solstice madness" that sweeps through Iberia at midsummer, expressing itself in a rich variety of bull and fire rituals closely paralleling hundreds of scenes in protohistoric cattlekeepers' rock art (and also resembling Berber summer-solstice rituals reported by Laoust [1921]), strongly suggests to this participant observer that the association of such activities with a solstice ritual event (perhaps in earlier times a New Year) is at least as old as Iberia's cattlekeeping traditions and may even preserve ele- ments of predomestication fire rituals (though I am not suggesting derivation from the Homo erectus fire-drive indicated at an elephant kill-site in Soria Province). The significance for archaeoastronomy of the Black Sea megaliths is evident: the many similarities of Basque-Caucasus folklore, dance, and music, and above all the extensive linguistic correspondences, suggest the possibility that similar orientations may also be found. Markovin (1969), Lunin (1924, 1936), Leshchenko (1931), Lavrov (1960), Shchepinsky (1963), and Chechenov (1970) have conducted large- scale surveys and excavations of megalithic structures in the Caucasus and nearby: I have not been able to examine their reports, but suggest that orientations and measurements already made or obtainable may make possible a systematic comparison.16 It will be interesting to see whether a synthesis of this Basque- Caucasus archaeological and folkloric data shows correspondences with the French megalithic folklore collected by Saintyves (1934) and students with refer- ence to some 2,000 stones and structures. (French folkloric classics appear to me to be especially signifi- cant sources with regard to megalithic traditions and survivals: Wayland Hand [personal communication, 18 I 72] notes that Sebillot [1968], like Saintyves, based much of his folkloric data on the physical world.) Regrettably, I have uncovered almost no reports on archaeoastronomy elsewhere in Eurasia or in Africa. Allchin (1956) has suggested that stone align- ments in southern Hyderabad may have had astro- 16I am indebted to Leo S. Klejn (personal communication, 9 x 71), aided by megalith students Vladimir Dmitriev and Leonid Rezepkin, for these and other most useful references. nomical significance; the alignments he reports seem to indicate this. Evidence, both textual and astronom- ical, to be published by Hawkins (personal com- munication, 6 xi 71) indicates that the Egyptian pyramids were oriented with reference to stellar targets (see also Pogo 1930, Giedion 1962). The stone circles of the Gambia and the Senegal are reported to be recent (Beale 1968). Perhaps commentators will be able to contribute further information on these areas. Pre-Hispanic architecture and art in the Americas have fascinated a generation of archaeologists and other students, many of whom have suggested astro- nomical functions for the structures (cf. Marquina 1951, 1960; Morley 1956; Noriega 1954, 1956, 1958; Saville 1909, 1929; Spinden 1940).17 As the textual and iconographic evidence indicates the presence of astronomical-mathematical skills of a high order, it is predictable that these skills will be reflected in the orientations and measurements of sacred structures and cult sites. As yet Mesoamerican archaeoastronomy has found no worker with the determination and engineering qualifications of Thom to make and statistically analyze the needed series of precision studies, and until such studies are systematically made on a statistical basis American archaeoastronomy cannot be expected to yield the information which, the evidence suggests, may be encoded in the struc- tures. Morley (1956:fig. 33) indicates the possible use of astronomical alignments in Group E, Uaxactun (Guatemala): here an astronomer-priest using Pyra- mid E-VII as an observation platform could, Morley estimates, have observed the flash of the rising sun at the equinoxes and solstices, using the wall and platform angles of three temples on an opposite pyramid as precise distant markers (fig. 4; cf. Morley 1956:figs. 4, 32). Hartung (1969), studying site-maps of Tikal, Co- pan, Uxmal, and Chichen Itzai, finds subtle overall planning suggested despite the apparent irregularity: at Copain a network of coordinates and parallel lines appears to connect ballcourts, while altars M and N correspond with cardinal points (cf. Guillemin 1969). Ballcourts, long recognized as connected with a solar cult, are a central feature of overall planning at various sites (cf. De Borhegyi 1969). Hartung surmises, as have others, that the doors of the Caracol at Chichen Itzai and other round structures which may have been observatories functioned as observa- 17Not an Americanist and largely absent from the Americas for over two decades, I am relatively unfamiliar with the growing body of current unpublished work in this area and have elsewhere (Baity 1969, 1971a) noted the need for a synthesizing review of American archaeoastronomy and ethnoastronomy. I hope that commentators will supplement the following discussion. For sources and criticisms with regard to American archaeoastronomy, I am deeply appreciative of the help of D. H. Kelley, Jonathan Reyman, and Charles H. Smiley. In connection with the various Maya studies, Kelley observes (personal communication, 8 v 71) that when one has a large number of figures with which to work and little control as to their meaning, impressive results may be cited that may not stand up; to me it seems important that skills from the fields of archaeology, protohistory, astronomy, and engineering may now be brought to bear on problems of common interest.

He warns against the possibility of errors in calculations based on site-plans rather than site examinations. Dow (personal communication, 5 x 68) warns in turn against the possibility of errors where reconstructions have been wrongly oriented, a factor which invali- dated some of his conclusions with regard to the stellar targets at Teotihuacain (Dow 1967). The pyra- mids of the Sun and of the Moon at this ancient Mexican cultural and sacred center are spectacular reminders of the pre-Aztec culture that dominated a wide area of Mesoamerica and influenced far-distant cultures (Millon, Drewitt, and Bennyhoff 1965). Much evidence indicates that astronomical observations functioned as a part of a complex ceremonialism using astra indicators and accompanied by astra mythology and deities. Teotihuacan is clearly the flowering of much older cultures, and for earlier stages of astro- nomical development researchers must turn to La Venta and other centers of the Olmec culture and also to the Chavin culture of the Peruvian highlands, in each of which a vigorous culture is in evidence in the 1st millennium B.C., and in each of which a jaguar-god symbolism is present. Possible Asian influ- ences in the ancient American cultures have been theorized on the basis of stylistic resemblances (Birrell 1970, Ekholm 1953, Kirchhoff 1964, Moran and Kelley 1969). Mertz (1969a,b) suggests that early Greeks voyaged to the area, and Taylor (1957) assesses the navigational astronomy which would have made this possible. As yet consensus is lacking on trans- oceanic contact, and archaeoastronomy may well con- tribute useful insights. At La Venta, as in megalithic cultures, a priestly elite prevailed upon its followers to cut and transport 50-ton stones which Olmec artists carved into huge heads, though similar-sized stones were used architecturally on the western coast of South America. Throughout Mesoamerica for at least two millennia, impressive pyramids were built and an endless flow of carved stone time-marking art works produced. The preoccupation of Maya-Mexi- can astronomer-mathematician-priests with time and the stars, and the extent of their accomplishments, are further assessed below. South American astronomical achievements also give evidence of having been rooted in some ancient culture (Reichlen 1.963, Zerries 1952, Wittkower 1938). Reiche (1968, 1969) documents with extensive aerial photography the Nasca giant ground figures. Straight lines running for miles with incredible precision across the Peruvian plains and up mountainsides could have indicated such events as solstice sunrises and sunsets or perhaps encoded measures of history and calendar science. Reiche sees a unit of measurement of 1.10 m., perhaps subdivided by the decimal system. Haw- kins (1969, 1970) does not see an astronomical func- tion in the Nasca iconography. Belli (1952) indicates the importance of the sun cult in the Nasca civilization. The Nasca figures do not suggest to me a correlation with a known zodiac, nor do they resemble North American ground figures and effigy mounds, and yet in both cases the enigma remains of why designs not visible at ground level were worth the outlay of energy involved in making them. Present in North America but apparently absent here is the serpent- and-egg (or lizard-and-egg) motif that is associated with eclipses in various Asian cultures (cf. Elwin 1951, 1955). Posnansky (1942) and others have suggested strong astronomical associations of Tihuanaco megalithic monuments with agricultural ceremonialism: the ele- vation of this ancient center to 12,500 ft. (an altitude which does not now permit corn to ripen) does not lessen its possible importance with regard to the sources of Inca calendric lore and architectural prac- tice. Zuidema (1968) has pointed to the importance of the Inca cosmological model in its application to temple- and city-building. Ferdon (1955) and others have noted architectural parallels between Mexico and the Southwest. R. F. Heizer reports (undated CA referee comment, 1970) that on the time level of 1000 B.C. Poverty Point (Louisiana) is, like La Venta (Tabasco), oriented in the line of 8? west of North and asks: Is this coinci- dence, or did the same system of stellar orientation exist in these areas separated by some 1,500 miles? And, if the latter, does this imply a link between the builders of the two sites? A systematic large-scale comparison of American site orientations should reveal the presence or absence of significant consis- tencies. Pre-Columbian towers in the Southwest have been noted by Schulman (1950). Reyman (1971 a) associates frequent citations of astronomical phenomena among the historic and modern pueblos, in particular Anasa- zi, with astronomical alignments of the prehistoric sites and structures. He emphasizes the importance 402 C U RRE NT AN TH ROPOLOG Y</page><page sequence="15">Baity: ARCHAEOASTRONOMY AND ETHNOASTRONOMY of the scattered references to astronomical alignments and rituals in Fewkes' (1891-1922) works, especially his reference to determining the length of the autum- nal equinox by a shadow (Fewkes 1916a), and of the data obtained by Parsons (1936; 1939a,b) and Stephen (1936) with regard to Puebloan astronomical practices. Reyman (1971a,b) ties the Anasazi astron- omy to the agricultural "tool-kit" ceremonialism from the Mesoamerican area and stresses the cultural importance of astronomical observation for site plan- ning, for the planning and execution of a successful agricultural cycle, and for ordering the procession of events within a given ceremonial. Stellar referents may have been mandatory in the ceremonial activities and thus in construction. He has made a distinctive- feature analysis of various features, ceremonial and architectural, that are parallel in Mexico and the Southwest: his analysis includes artifacts that occur with the features and the context of the features within the structure and the structure within the site, on the hypothesis that consistent astronomical fea- tures reflect similar ceremonial contexts (personal communication, 8 iv 71). Similar (unpublished) work has been done by John Molloy in the Hohokam area, and with ballcourts by Schroeder (1966) and Wasley and Johnson (1965). The Anasazi data analyzed by Reyman is generally significant as a late and well-documented example in which astronomical ceremonialism is caught red- handed entering an already populated area with improved maize. The data also emphasize the impor- tance of postholes in areas which no longer have surviving cultures. Wittry (1964-70) has excavated at Cahokia four henge-type structures, part of a vast ceremonial complex, radiocarbon-dated to around A.D. 1000, where spaced wooden posts appear to have been arranged in circles of from 240 to 480 ft. in diameter: Wedel (1967) describes henge structures which may have served a similar function in central Kansas. European megalithic astronomy throws new light on these American circles marked now in many sites only by postholes. The more elaborate "American Woodhenge" described by Wittry (1970a: 15; 1970b) was 410 ft. in diameter, laid out by means of a peg-and-rope compass. The cardinal points were marked by four posts, and the total of 48 posts were evenly spaced around the circle. At around A.D. 1000, Wittry shows, an observer standing at a post located 5 ft. to the east of the true center of the circle excavated and looking at the fourth post to the left would have been looking at the angle required, slightly greater than 30?, toward the summer-solstice sunrise. In 1964, when first described, these Cahokia circles were the only known indications north of Mexico of structures which could have served as sun circles defining the tropical year. The circle examined by Wedel (Tobias site) consists of elongated house circles arranged around a patio within the ditched zone; the houses appear to have served as sighting lines of the solstitial sunrise points. Wedel cites Dorsey (1907:8), who described the Wichita and the Pawnee religious sys- tems as star cults: the Skidi Morningstar sacrifice of a captive girl is one of the several evidences of sacrifices at the winter solstice, the "feast of fire," evidently for the purpose of strengthening the weak winter sun for its journey north. Like Reyman, Wedel stresses the significance of the solstice rituals described by Parsons (1939a,b; 1936) and Fewkes (1897:259; 1898:678) for Zufii, Taos, and Picuris, in which posts and other markers are known to have served as solstice indicators. Hardman (1971) reports two roughly carved menhirs which mark solstice alignments in shell mounds at Crystal Lake, Florida: the determin- ants, though primitive, appear to have offered an accurate base for prediction. In a preliminary survey of the literature on other Southeastern temple mounds, he sees indications which suggest the value of testing for astronomical function and suggests trans-Gulf contact with Yucatan in early centuries B.C. EVIDENCE FROM ETHNOASTRONOMY: ICONOGRAPHY, TEXTS, RITUALS The line between archaeoastronomy and ethnoas- tronomy cannot be sharply drawn, as much evidence overlaps; notably, the evidence of astra iconography,'8 often made accessible by archaeological methods and informative to archaeoastronomy, is in many instances clarified by iconographic and other traditions of living peoples. My division of the two topics is necessarily arbitrary and sometimes hinges upon the assumption of a certain duty to a hypothetical reader who may be unfamiliar with astronomical facts and constructs, with whom a ground of understanding should be established before I attempt to briefly review icono- clastic studies. Marshack's work, like that of Thom, requires such a mental restructuring: each stands alone, each represents years of grueling fieldwork with a scrupulous regard for the difference between objective data and subjective assumption; and just as Thom requires us to modify traditional views with regard to Neolithic man's cognitive capacities, Mar- shack requires us to think about how these abilities developed in Paleolithic man in response to observed seasonal (including astronomical) realities. The question of the backward thrust in time of 8Elsewhere (Baity 1917b) I have used "astra (astro-) iconogra- phy" to designate sets, subsets, and classes of motifs observable in ceramic and rock art: (1) obvious astra forms, lunar, stellar, and solar, including what I take to be annular eclipses and total eclipses with coronas; (2) the representation of recurring astra events serving to date rituals, such as heliacal and other risings and settings, and of symbols denoting these; (3) the representation of subjective concepts such as constellations, which represent gods in their animal forms; and (4) the record of rites duly performed. The term is inadequate, as Marshack notes (personal communica- tion, 28 x 71), in that it excludes the greater part of the Paleolithic- Mesolithic astronomical notations, which are nonstatic, cumulative records of phenomena observed and recorded over periods ex- tending into months and years. He sees a relatively late stabilized official iconography and mythology, following an earlier use of open seasonal images, abstract signs related to diverse seasonal observations, reportorial depictions of seasonal ritual including images of sky bodies, and, finally, a lunar notation. His terms appear to me to be preferable for the greater number of astronom- ical symbols, rituals, and myths, but I suggest that for sets specifically depicting astra bodies and events, and the ritual directly related to them, the term astra iconography may have a specific use. Vol. 14 * No. 4 * October 1973 403</page><page sequence="16">man's astronomical interest was first raised in Mar- shack's (1964) study of lunar notations on Upper Paleolithic remains; these include cave markings which suggest notations which could represent the synodic month (the 29- days from new moon to new moon), one of the recurring astra events most helpful in man's early attempts at timekeeping. We have seen from Thom's work that the solstices and equinoxes of sun and moon are easily observable recurring events. The vernal and autumnal equinoxes could have become early associated with man's quest for food in Ice Age Eurasia, where the migration of great animal herds and the appearance and disap- pearance of plant foods were vitally important to the advanced Homo sapiens groups who created Pa- leolithic iconography featuring bulls, stags, other animals, and plants in what appear to have been symbolic contexts. Cliffside cave-mouths would have been excellent vantage points from which to observe such distant markers as mountain slopes and horizon gaps, which often must have bounded the annual swing of the sunrise from north to south and back again and the more complex moon swings, as well as the recurring rising at certain seasons of brilliant stars such as Sirius and Capella and the unpredictable appearance of eclipses, comets, and novae. That Paleolithic men thoughtfully observed these astra events and recorded some of them, notably the moon's movements, in calendric notations in both mobiliary and cave art is indicated by Marshack's (1969; 1970a,b,c; 1971; 1972a,b) painstaking docu- mentation. His analysis of European Upper Paleolith- ic and Mesolithic engraved artifacts verifies the pre- sence of highly complex interlocking symbolic sys- tems. He traces a 25,000-year development of these interrelated, "time-factored" traditions into the Neo- lithic. His work indicates that these early cultures symbolized seasonal and periodic phenomena to a greater extent than do present-day or historic hunt- ing-gathering cultures. With regard to lunar or calen- dric symbolism and notation, Marshack (1972a) states that these were probably not yet truly astronomical in that they were not yet truly arithmetic; the notations and images had a seasonal reference related to eco- nomic and ritual periodicities comparable to the seasonal "moons" of later American Indian usage. Marshack's continuing studies of interrelated time- factored traditions traced through the Mesolithic will in all probability document the sources of well-attested Neolithic astra-determined rituals. Pending the pub- lication of his findings, there is little known to me to prove the probable Mesolithic interest in astra events except the orientation of burials and vague indications of early solstice fire rituals. Later interest in solar movements and solstice dates is unambig- uously indicated by the intensified fire rituals, in- cluding both the widespread fire walk and the toro de fuego or fire bull ritual. These are associated with solstice occasions in Soria Province, Spain, the French and Spanish Basque provinces, and the Indian sub- continent. The fire walk is connected with a winter- solstice New Year in China and Mesoamerica, occurs at a spring equinox in Iran, and is endemic in India (Baity 1962, 1968). One may, in view of evidence suggesting a pre-Neolithic origin for these and other intensified fire rituals, ask if their prototypes may have been associated with astra occasions even in the Paleolithic, and this may be suggested by Klima's (1962:199-204) documentation for Dolni Vestonice. Here, in a permanent mammoth-hunters' settlement datable to around 29,000-25,000 B.P., numerous bro- ken bits of ceramic animal figurines were found in a large bake-oven in a hut suggestive of a cult center and also in a common central hearth containing an ash layer some 100 cm. in depth, in which was found the Venus of Wisternitz (Vestonice), protectress of the common economic-social life and perhaps a pro- totype of the hearth goddess. This evidence suggests animal sacrifices symbolically made at a seasonal ritual event, a hypothesis to be further considered by Soviet and Czechoslovakian scientists, who may indicate whether solar orientations are indicated in structures, settlement patterns, and burials of Pavlovian and other Paleolithic permanent settlements. The widespread occurrence of Mesolithic interest in solar movements is indicated by Saxe's (1971) study of the orientation of skulls in a Mesolithic population at Wadi Halfa (Sudan), which utilized only 42% of the 3600 range. Saxe (1971:fig. 2) indicates concen- tration in the southeast quadrant and a well-defined clustering between 650 (sunrise at summer solstice) and 1150 (sunrise at winter solstice), which he inter- prets as an indication of patterned behavior. Other data on the orientation of burials suggests a similar patterning: with reference to Thule burials, Merbs (1968) sees congruency of burial axes with solar positions, and examining Pennsylvania burials Gruber (1971) suspects orientation towards the position of the sun on the horizon at dawn. Various studies indicate that Afro-Eurasian ceramic and wall iconography from the 4th millennium downward records astra-set rituals. Several well-doc- umented and somewhat different traditions appear evident. In view of the prolonged association in later Asian and Ibero-Saharan iconography of astra sym- bols and the horns of stags or bulls (with rams appearing in the Sahara and Iberia), it is tempting to surmise that the large horned animals-stags and bulls-were already associated not only with deities but with constellations by the 8th millennium, a hypothesis suggested by the appearance of bull and stag icons in cult contexts at Chatal Hiuyiik (Mellaart 1967) and supported by textual evidence reviewed below. Classical Tripolye iconography charmingly em- ploys motifs which to me appear to incorporate astra symbols into the Neolithic spiral associated with early agricultural diffusion (Hawkes and Woolley 1963:255-56, 332), though the designs suggest a cosmological orientation rather than specific rituals (as in Iran, Elam, Sumer, the Indus, and the Ibero- Saharan continuum). However, a design of concentric half-ovals enclosing a stellar motif has a certain resemblance to a motif which Hartner identifies as a symbol for a heliacal rising (compare Gimbutas 1956: fig. 37, no. 4 with Hartner 1965: figs. 23, 24).

By the 3d millennium some sophisticated cosmo- logical belief which was expressed in ritual and recorded in iconography appears to have existed around the Black Sea and the Persian Gulf. I have noted the resemblances between stag and bull icons of Anatolia, notably of Alaca Hiuyiuk, and Galician rock-art stags and bulls (Baity 1968:103-13, figs. 7a, 8B). The Egyptian iconography is for the most part different. Earlier Saharan rock-art scenes, however, appear to contain elements of both traditions: this area is interesting because of the early appearance of the solar ram, a figure absent from the early Mesopotamian zodiac but present in the Indus zodiac Heras (1953) postulates, and appearing as a borrowed element (perhaps from Egypt) in the Greek zodiac. As Sumerian-Babylonian astronomical texts and icon- ography offer the possibility of "text-aided" interpre- tations, let us briefly review studies in this area which afford a basis for comparisons with iconography in "text-free" areas. In the earliest known writings, we find an intense concern with astronomy and a rather apprehensive concentration, in Mesopotamia at least, on astra-based predictions. Textual evidence proves that the Egyp- tians told time by means of the "decans," 100 sections of the ecliptic and nearby regions originally based on constellations rising heliacally 10 days apart after having been invisible due to conjunction with the sun. In a precomputer attempt to calculate the effects of precession (by drilling several pairs of "polar" holes in a celestial globe), Pogo (1930) offered identifica- tions for constellations appearing in the earliest known of several astronomical tomb ceilings, that of Hatshepsut's architect Senmut, of the 18th dynasty, ca. 1500 B.C., and indicates the importance of circum- polar constellations in temple orientation. He cites a text describing the "cord-stretching" ritual for astronomical alignment. An English translation (Gied- ion 1962) identifies the target constellation as Ursa Major, but Pogo identifies the Bull, Meskheti, as terminating with the then polar star (Thuban). The ritual text reads: "I have grasped the peg. . . . I observe the forward striding movement of the con- stellations. My eye is fixed on the Great Bear.... I . . . determine the corners of your temple" (cf. Pogo 1930: pl. 16; Giedion 1962: figs. 77, 78). The paraphernalia for this ritual of temple orientation are represented in iconography; actual examples dat- ing from the time of Hatshepsut may be seen in the Cairo museum. Pogo compares Senmut's ceiling with two 12th-century-B.c. examples, noting changes that precession would have caused in the decans system and its associated deities. The use of an ancient astronomical system built on exact observations is evident, as is the importance of the Pleiades: as Pogo notes, around 3000 B.C., when the vernal equinox was in the Taurus constellation of the Mesopotamian zodiac, the celestial equator by definition ran through our Taurus constellation and thus very near Procyon. A check with the Morehead Planetarium at Chapel Hill for the approximate latitude of Thebes (Karnak Luxor) shows that Pogo's method is sufficiently accu- rate for observational astronomy. (Cf. Smiley's similar description of the Maya calendar Zero Day below.) Senmut's bull constellation, with its ovoid body ter- minating in what appears to be an orientation line, resembles an iconographic part-bull in an Ibero- Saharan rock scene which I had taken to be a zodiac representation (Baity 1968: fig. 14c) and thus not early Egyptian in origin. Senmut's astronomical ceiling, with its proof that a quite representational bull head had preceded the "leg of beef" constellation of later days, offers the possibility of another interpretation. By 1500 B.C., as the planetarium test shows, Thuban was too far from the pole to be significant, though our Taurus still was close to the celestial equator, with the Pleiades at +8? N and Aldebaran at +30 N, and Aries the Ram moving to take its place. Neugebauer (1942b:402) makes the point that the complexity of Egyptian and Babylonian calendars "represents the peaceful coexistence of different methods of defining time moments and time intervals in different ways on different occasions." Schematic devices expressing future dates in round numbers, useful for long-term economic agreements, were always subject to adjust- ment by inspection of lunar phases. Meanwhile, as the strongly agricultural character of these civiliza- tions emphasized the seasons of the solar year, the heliacal rising of stars was practical for determining solstices and equinoxes and thus for regulating agri- cultural rituals and labors (cf. also Neugebauer 1945:794). Constellation figures, such as that of the bull in Senmut's astronomical ceiling and on coffin lids, highly mythological in content, were not always understood by later copyists, when precession had changed the objective astra facts. In Mesopotamian texts the shift to systematic prediction (cf. Neugebauer 1945:795) of lunar phenomena and the use of the cycle of 19 years can be seen by the 4th century B.C. Giedion's (1962) analysis of flat-topped pyramids and other types of sacrificial altars and his extensive data on Ram (Ra) cults and other horn and antler symbolism associated with fertility renewal cults af- ford a basis for comparative studies on the funda- mental difference in Egyptian and Mesopotamian astra cults, the one cheerfully focusing on the sun as deity and on constellations as soul guides and the other gloomily studying night skies for predictions. Although the decans appear in drawings on the inner side of coffin lids around 2100 B.C., Sarton (1927-48), Taton (1963), and others (not including Lockyer 1965) have thought that astronomy did not develop the scientific stature in Egypt that it attained in Mesopotamia. To their credit, however, the Egyp- tians of around 4228 B.C. had tried, by adopting sidereal time keyed to the heliacal rising of Sirius (Sothis), to resolve the problem presented by the fact that there is no lunar year which corresponds to the solar year marked by the solstices. They dealt with the incommensurability of the solar and sidereal years (the latter being about 4 day longer than the former) by maintaining both a civil (with leap year) and a sacred calendar (cf. Parker 1950). It is interesting that when forced to choose between the stars and Vol. 14 No. 4 - October 1973 405</page><page sequence="18">social custom, the Egyptians recognized social pri- macy: exhausted, perhaps, with the attempt to recon- cile calendars which coincided only every 1,460 years (i.e., 365 x 4; cf. Edwards 1970), they may well have lost faith in the stars, and who can blame them? However, selection biases of Arab scholars in favor of medicine and magic may have operated against astronomical papyri, whereas astronomical scholars have worked with archaeologists from the first deci- phering of cuneiform and of Maya hieroglyphics (Fleckenstein-Gallo 1967). Later Egyptian astronomy is closely tied to Greek and Roman astronomy and astrology, based on the Mesopotamian zodiac, which introduced constellation figures new to the Egyptians (cf. Claggett 1955; Zinner 1931, 1933). The achievements of early Middle Eastern astron- omers have been intensively studied.'9 Neugebauer's (1937-72; Neugebauer, De Falco, and Krause 1966; Neugebauer and Parker 1964, 1969; Neugebauer and Sachs 1968-69) highly specialized studies relate early astronomy to mathematics and ancient geography. There is little doubt that by the 2d millennium B.C. a reasonably respectable astronomy existed in the Middle East, which the West assimilated, along with inheritances from its own megalithic cultures. The textual evidence indicates that this sophisticated as- tronomical knowledge existed in Mesopotamia well before Sargon of Agade boasted (ca. 2350 B.C.) of having rescued his trading colony at Parsuhanda, 1,000 miles away in Asia Minor. (Sargon's reference to long-distance trading is validated by the finding of uniform Akkadian architecture in distant trading areas [Mallowan 1965:5].) Mesopotamian astronomy continued to develop: Van der Waerden (1949, 1963) discusses Venus tablets dating to the Hammurapi Dynasty and lists of 36 stars connected with the 12 months of the year. He also notes the significance of the heliacal rising of individual stars and constella- tions as indicators for seasonal festivities in Babylonia, Egypt, and Greece. As the stars of the Elam, Akkad, and Amurru lists are identical with those of later lists, he suggests a very ancient origin in Old Babylonian times or earlier. Hammurapi's scribes appear to have reworked the calendric and stellar traditions into "a fine symmetrical system." A series of Venus observa- tions made under Ammizaduga, which Van der Waerden (personal communication, 8 ix 70) dates to around 1582-1561 B.C., are well in accord with modern calculations "if one assumes that no serious disturbance of the orbit of Venus occurred after 1582 B.C." It may be helpful to more fully discuss two of the subjective constructs the wide distribution of which is strongly suggestive of East-West and Old "9Cf. Aaboe (1967), Audin (1945-55), Berger (1970), Conteneau (1940), De Saussure (1919-24), Dicks (1970), Hirmonech (1913), Hopman (1934), Langdon (1935), Pinches et al. (1955), Pogo (1931), Sachs (1955), Thierens (1935), and Thorndike (1938). An excellent short summary of historical astronomy is to be found in the Dictionnaire archeologique des techniques (see 1963 articles by Auboyer, Baudez, Bloch, Largement, Mugler, Reichlen, Schrimpf, and Vercoutter). More extensive summaries abound, including those by Dozy (Pellat translation, 1961), Schlegel (1875), Wensinck (1921), Sarton (1927-48), Claggett (1955), Beer (1967), Pannekoek (1961), Taton (1963), and Siverama Menon (1932). World-New World contacts. The zodiac, a band en- compassing the paths of the planets, sun, and moon (with the ecliptic in its center), is a construct common to Western Asia, China, Mesoamerica, and probably the Indus area; thus it is of increasing interest to prehistorians for the light it may throw on the diffusion of astra cults. The z-odiac is a highly subjec- tive construct involving star-groups given the symbolic forms of living beings (aside from Libra). With the exception of Scorpio, the constellation patterns do not resemble the beings they represent, and therefore the presence of roughly similar zodiacs in widely separated areas suggests borrowing from some early center, though it is not yet identified. Further, because of the precession of the equinoxes, the zodiac is helpfully time-specific. The Sumerian zodiac, from which our own was derived via later Mesopotamian and Greek astrolo- gists, is of early and unknown origin, having like Athena appeared full-grown. Van der Waerden (1952) discusses its division by later Mesopotamian astronomers into 12 sections (called houses) of 300 each, designated by zodiacal signs. This regularity is not characteristic of earlier zodiacs, and the division into 12 is only one of many possible divisions: Heras (1953:241) reconstructs an Indus zodiac with only 8 houses and suggests that the earliest zodiacs may have been limited to the constellations serving by their heliacal rising to indicate solstices and equinoxes. Lunar houses (or mansions), as will be further dis- cussed below, contain 27 or 28 asterisms (constella- tions). The precession of the equinoxes causes each zodiacal constellation in the 12-house system to move backward one house approximately every 2,100 years (fig. 5). Thus around 2000 B.C. precession displaced the heliacal rising of Taurus and the heliacal setting of Scorpio away from the vernal equinox, which they had precisely marked for renewal rituals for well over 1,000 years (though due to cultural lag the displaced bull did not disappear from ritual or sym- bolism). This unexpected astral machination un- doubtedly confounded early priestly astronomers accustomed to dating New Year's rituals by the heliacal risings and settings of these constellations, and it caused far later Ionian Greek astronomers to note "errors" in the sky-charts and descriptions of their predecessors which led to their discovery of the phenomenon. Precession is, therefore, a prime cause for rejoicing among ethnoastronomers for the com- parative data it affords. With regard to the origin of the zodiac, Maunder (1908) argues unanswerably that the space of the southern sky left blank in early sky-charts was neces- sarily centered on the celestial South Pole, as constel- lations adjacent to it could not be seen in a northern latitude. Since precession shifts the pole among the stars a known amount, the ascertainment of a former place for the invisible South Pole circumpolar constel- lations roughly indicates the time and place of origin for a sky-chart. By this system Maunder estimates that the constellations described by Aratus in 270 B.C. indicate that he was using a far older sky-chart or description, one made around the 28th century B.C. at or near 400 north latitude.

He notes the tendency of place names to survive change of culture and language, if in corrupt form, and chooses Stampalia (local name Astropalia) as his site.20 This accords with Richer's (1967) hypothesis that a network of astrologically assigned sites centered near Crete, which I can only see as occurring in Minoan times, before the widespread tectonic action, includ- ing the exposion of Santorini (Marinatos 1939, Ga- lanopoulos and Bacon 1969) which destroyed Knossos sense, an explanation which offers a key to garbled astra mythology.

(Drawing by Charles H. Smiley.) and the Minoan culture. Aside from this area, however, China, Iran, and Spain are also strategically located with regard to observations appropriate to our zodiac that could have been made in 2800 B.C., and Iran fulfills better than does Crete certain other requirements, among them the well-documented presence in Elam of 4th- and 3d-millennium astria iconography including what appear to be prototypes of the figures of the Western Asian zodiac (cf. Hartner 1965). Ovenden attributes the preservation of astral data from the 28th century B.C. to early sailors who repeated nautical star-lore to their children while the inexorable march of precession turned it into non- 20C. H. Smiley (personal communication, 15 viii 71) would make the time 2800 B.C. ? 600 and the latitude 340 N + 30, adding "I wouldn't rule out Babylon." He estimates that a statement made by Aratus would have been true about 1788 B.C. (indicating that the Greek astronomer had access to far older data long since lost). Minoan context which included a Linear A tablet, appears to Pomerance to be a religious calendar of agricultural festivities, showing the progression through the year of constellations which he identifies as the Pleiades, the Eagle, and the Serpent's Tail, familiar Near Eastern constellations associated with astrology by the classical Greeks. Pomerance regards the icons as symbolic ideograms without phonetic value, which would place them in the class with the icons used in Sorai wall art and with some of the icons in the Ibero-Saharan iconographic scenes. He identifies some as Sumerian-Babylonian in origin, others as Egyptian. The Disc appears to him to indicate by means of the heliacal rising and setting of the Pleiades the time for harvesting and planting, a hypothesis consistent with surviving Pleiades folk- lore. The instructions, as he interprets them, parallel those in Hesiod, further evidence that Hesiod made use of astronomical traditions remounting to Minoan Vol. 14 - No. 4 * October 1973 407</page><page sequence="20">times, which Baschmakoff (1948) has found to be true with regard to nautical directions in the Black Sea periploi fragments. Circumpolar stars may also be indicated on the Disc. To repeat, it is not the fact of the use of certain star groups as constellations that implies dissemination of a system, but the subjective constructs involved; Egyptian constellations were for the most part dif- ferent from those of the Sumerian zodiac, as are those reported for the Tuareg by Lhote (1952), while Mesoamerican and Indian zodiacs share certain con- stellations but not others.2' Next to the solar zodiac, which was so helpful in date-setting, the best-documented ancient subjective astronomical construct with a wide distribution is that of the corresponding "lunar mansions" (Allen 1963:7-101). The comparative studies of Moran and Kelley (1969) show correspondences between Chinese and Mesoamerican lunar houses. Kelley (1960, 1971) further demonstrates similarities in Mesoamerican, Indian, and Chinese lunar house asterisms and cites the work of Boll (1904), Bork (1914, 1924, 1929), Chavannes (1906), Graebner (1921), Rock (1919, 1922), Stucken (1913), and Weinstock (1950), as well as Burmese and Tibetan models. Chatley (1940a) indicates that Egyptian astronomers also grouped the equinoctial-ecliptic stars under 28 sets. Chatley (1940b), who dates the decans system of Egypt back to the 10th Dynasty, notes the agreement of Coptic and Arabic names. This lunar mansion construct, documented for China and India well into the 1st millennium B.C., is evident in Korean and early Arabic texts. Needham (1969), Weinstock (1950), and Moran (1969) have seen a Western origin, but Kelley (1969:150) notes the absence of such a list in Assyrian, Babylonian, and Sumerian early sources. To me the 21 In view of the extreme cultural significance of the evidence with regard to widespread zodiacal iconography, Moran's hypothe- sis (Moran and Kelley 1969) of a zodiacal origin for our alphabet deserves close study. Moran (personal communication, 4 iv 72) indicates that while Kelley sees the autumnal equinox as setting the major early Chinese festival, he himself sees evidence (Chinese and Old Testament) that the harvest festival became secondary to a winter-solstice New Year somewhere around the 14th to 12th centuries B.C. and notes that Confucius called himself merely the editor of sacred books remounting to perhaps the 12th century. Moran finds close relationships between the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin alphabets and the corresponding zodiacal constellations and sees the signs for Niu, "the Ox," and Tsade, "to shoot an arrow," as bringing the systems into juxtaposition. Moran's comparison of ancient Chinese sky-charts and legends, specifically that of the Oxherd, leader of the Seven Stars of the Dipper, who became separated from the Weaver Woman by the River of Heaven (the Milky Way), suggests ancient recognition of the changes caused by precession. Moran (personal communication, 25 iv 72) adds, "In the maps of the astrological works, the upper left-hand corner is the Northwest corner. That is where the River of Heaven comes into view in two streams which shortly unite. It is at that point that the astrological table of the original man and woman is found. It was at that point that the herdsman kept his cattle, and to him his former wife the Weaver Woman crossed over once a year to spend the night. Confucius makes numerous references to the Northwest Corner, which would be on the heavenly map shortly before the winter solstice." In this connection, I think of Moghadam's (1938) hypothesis that the Iranian New Year, now set by the spring equinox, was once set by the summer solstice. South Indian myths and astra-set festivals also indicate the dis- placement of the New Year's celebration. In each of these cases, the emphasis upon bull sacrifice or bull rituals strongly suggests that the heliacal rising of a bull constellation may have set the date. early appearance in Sumeria of a fully developed zodiac suggests origin elsewhere in an undetermined location. Hartner's (1965) hypothesis of the Iranian use of the heliacal rising of a horned-animal constel- lation (ibex or stag) as a solstice-predictor around the 4th and 3d millennia B.C., as indicated by art representation on painted ceramics and other arti- facts, agrees with the findings of other astronomical scholars that the heliacal rising and setting of zodiacal constellations timed ritual cycles of the New Year. The antiquity and depth of early Indian astronom- ical knowledge has been stressed by many scholars (Bhattacharyya and Mitra 1925; Clark 1930; Schmidt 1944; Sengupta 19,29, 1931). That its origin lay with proto-Indians, the Indus people described in early Vedic texts and epics as great astronomers and "masters of the deep," has appeared probable, Heras (1953) having determined that the Indus language was proto-Dravidian and argued that an Indus eight- house zodiac closely paralleled the major Sumerian signs. The recent decoding of the Indus script by Parpola (1970) and colleagues parallels the Heras reading of certain signs, including those for star and Pleiades ("six-star"). Parpola (personal commu- nication, 23 iII 71), while not supporting Heras as to the zodiac, sees an astral orientation in the Indus religion, with the sun, moon, and planets (identified by color) as the major deities, characters in a mythic drama of the victory of the god of light and good over the demon of darkness and evil (the planet Rahu, causer of eclipses). The Indus gods, like those of Iran and Anatolia, had animal counterparts. Parpola suggests that the traditional Hindu luni-solar calendar operating with 27-28 asterisms was created by the Harappa people, essentially independently of Mesopotamia, and early borrowed into China. He notes that Soviet scholars agree with this interpreta- tion. They recognize, however, the trade relations between the Indus area and Sumer. Coming probably from the Iranian plateau, the Dravidians who settled along the Indus became sea-traders who founded colonies along the Persian Gulf (Bibby 1966, 1969). When disaster overtook the Indus ports almost a millennium later, survivors took refuge in South India, or remained in their distant trading posts, to be absorbed in time into the local populations. Tamil calendric cults, stressing bull rituals and solstice occa- sions, to me suggest possible survivals of ancient cults: Neugebauer (1952) describes a prediction device involving pebbles as mnemonic devices, which recalls Hoyle's suggestion that Stonehenge may have been a definitive system by which pegboards and other systems were calibrated. Tosi (1971:24), summing up scholarly opinion which has been substantiated by Bibby's (1969) analysis of Indus colonies along the Arab coast of the Gulf from Kuwait to the island of Bahrein, the most important center, notes that artifacts found link the island with the Oman culture, "which is clearly Iranian in origin"-specifically, a sherd with a representation of a zebu-humped bull, which Bibby compares to those occurring on Kulli ware of southeast Baluchistan and which Tosi further conipares to the Bampur Culture. The scope and interest of early Chinese astronomy 408 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="21">Baity: ARCHAEOASTRONOMY AND ETHNOASTRONOMY is indicated by many studies, including those of De Saussure (1919-67), Eberhard (1933, 1940, 1957, 1971), Hartner (1944-49), Hartner and Ettinhausen (1964), Lessa (1968), Needham (1969), Porter (1950), and Schlegel (1875). According to legend, an ancient Chinese astronomical system was renovated by the (probably mythical) Emperor Yao, who according to earlier (and not fully accepted) interpretations of the Shu King could have had a 2d-millennium date: the legend relates that Yao beheaded two court astron- omers delinquent with regard to customary eclipse rituals. It has been suggested that the eclipse referred to was that visible in North China in 2161 B.C., but Eberhard (personal communication, 15 in 72) notes that according to recent studies the Shu King was not composed before 1000 B.C., with the data on Yao perhaps as late as 400 B.C.: moreover, the episode of the two astronomers may be a solar myth, as is suggested by the resemblance of their names to that of a solar deity, Hsi-ho. The belief that early Chinese astronomers discovered the obliquity of the ecliptic is not confirmed by the early astronomical texts, datable to around 220 B.C. Eberhard cites Bezold's comparison of Babylonian and Chinese oracles based on astronomical factors and suggesting possible simi- larities, implying contact. On the grounds that the Babylonian-Greek astro- nomical system was ecliptic, annual, and angular whereas the Chinese was equatorial, with reckoning by night, De Saussure (1967:12-13) assumed an independent Chinese origin, and saw the pole star (not then Polaris) as the center of Chinese astrono- my and metaphysics. Needham (1969) and Lessa (1968:48) stress the distinctive nature of Chinese constellation constructs, but Moran and Kelley (1969), whose studies of lunar mansions I have mentioned as suggesting contact with Mesoamerica, also note resemblances of Chinese-Western circumpolar con- stellations (our Great and Little Bears or Dippers and Draco); they note the absence of these asterisms in Assyrian, Babylonian, and Sumerian sources. Needham and other scholars do not agree with the hypothesis of Chavannes (1906) that the Chinese derived constructs from Turkish or Hunnish peoples in the 1st millennium. Both Eberhard and Kelley do, however, comment with interest on the work of Rock (n.d., 1919, 1922), who attempted to make a comparison of various zodiacs, and Eberhard suspects that several Chinese cycles of unknown character may have been based upon foreign words. This lack of consensus among scholars with regard to the legen- dary antiquity of Chinese astronomy, considered conjointly with the data in other studies listed here, further suggests a Neolithic origin and probable linking to the earliest agricultural ritual cycles. Hartner (1965:7, n. 28) describes the Babylonian constellation ban (cf. Van der Waerden 1949:16) as identical with the Chinese hu-shih, "the bow and arrow" (cf. Schlegel 1875:434), and discusses other early Chinese symbolism (Hartner 1944-49). In the absence of datable texts, the iconographic studies serve to supplement the archaeological evidence of early contact (Hawkes and Woolley 1963:255), per- haps that of the Neolithic expansion and of later cultural diffusions (Lindsay 1951). Minakata (1919) also studies the Chinese use of zodiacal symbols. Nakamura (1930) analyzes constel- lation symbolism of the Korean era, and Nakayama (1969) indicates the Chinese base of Japanese astron- omy. Ho Peng Yoke (1962) criticises catalogues of ancient and medieval observations of comets and novae in Chinese sources as not coming from the best sources, which he cites. Beer et al. (1961) describe the accomplishment of medieval Chinese astronomers and engineers in laying out an arc of observation no less than 3,800 km. in length and fixing a civil unit prefiguring the metric system of a millennium later, estimating that this project would hardly have been possible without tables of trigonometrical func- tions, as values were calculated from the summer-sol- stice shadow series. This compares interestingly with data cited by Moghadam (seminar, University of Tehran, 1964-65) which suggest early collaboration between Iranian and Chinese observatories and the possible establishment of something resembling a prime meridian. Knobel (1917) studies the star cata- logue of Ulugh-Beg (1392-1449), whose observatory in Samarkand may still be seen. Petri's (1967) work on Tibetan astronomy indicates that early astronom- ical knowledge was diffused along some east-west continuum. Kelley (1971) documents the use of cosmological designs not only in the laying out of ancient cities in Assyria, Iran, China, and Greece, but also in kinship groups, games, and the alphabet. Shorto (1963) sees similar pattern regularities, involving the number 32, in Burmese and other Asian city designs (cf. Buchanan 1801), accompanied by a mythology involving ser- pent-princesses dowered with the land (a feature notable in French mythology and one which Herodo- tus [Book IV] tied to the Hercules cult in Scythia).22 He observes in city design the use of the square (4 made 5 by the central pillar) and the circle and mentions an astronomical calendar. As noted above, zodiacal patterns on a vast scale are seen by Richer (1969) to connect the sacred prophetic centers of ancient Crete, Greece, and Ionia in a system perhaps predating the Mycenean culture. The field of Arabian astronomy is significant for its possible evidences both of the astronomy of the earlier Arabian cultures which disappeared with the increasing aridity and of the astronomy which later Arabs carried far and wide as a navigational aid (surely as significant on the desert as on the sea). Carmody's (1956) critical bibliography of Arabic sources in Latin translation gives an idea of the immense scope of Arabic astronomical literature: Kennedy, Engle, and Wamsted (1965) translate Al-Bir-uni on Hindu calen- dars, and Lesley (1957) finds in his work an indication of a survival of Babylonian data. Carmody (1961) 22It has interested me, as it did Herodotus (Book IV), that the Homeric Greek hero Herakles (whose sun-god attributes have been extensively studied) arrived in the Pontic steppes from the Golden Hesperides in the West, presumably the Iberian peninsula. Soviet scholars have also found the Hercules cult of interest (Artamonov 1961, Grakov 1950, Peredolskaya 1958). Vol. 14 No. 4 - October 1973 409</page><page sequence="22">has similarly translated and discussed the work of Thabit b. Qurra. Campos (1953) and Mesnard (1949) are among those who contribute valuable studies of Arabic star and constellation names, indicating the familiarity of Arabic peoples with the zodiacal con- stellations. Monod's (1963) study of early Arab sailing discusses other early navigators who were familiar with the stars and constellations of the southern hemisphere; this study is especially valuable for the sources cited, which indicate the surprising extent of early sailing. An authority has hopefully observed that Arabic documents should be organized and in translation in another century, which should cheer the impatient. The survival in the Middle East of star and planet cults, as well as of cults of sun and moon deities, offers perspective to archaeoastronomy studies (Cu- mont 1927). Henninger (1954) has given a most valuable and extensive documentation to his study of the survival of Venus and other cults in Arabia. Ancient planet cults survive still elsewhere along the Persian Gulf: Lady Drower's (1962) remarkable study of the Mandaean cults is a model both as ethnography and as an exercise in meticulous scholarship relating the present to the past (see also Drower 1936). In all of these areas of ancient astronomy, the icon- ography is of great importance for the information it may provide, as the sets of motifs appear in other areas where no records exist (cf. Boll 1904; Bork 1914, 1924, 1929; Pogo 1931). With the function of the Mesopotamian zodiacal animals in mind (as well as the rather sudden appear- ance in Sumer of the zodiac), let us examine rock art and ceramic iconography distributed in a contin- uum from Iberia to India and appearing on both sides of the Mediterranean. Anati (1964) reproduces a series of rock-art stag ritual scenes from Camonica Valley, an early North Italian ore-producing area in which rituals were recorded in iconography from roughly the 4th millennium to the time of the Roman conquest. He notes (pp. 162-67) motifs symbolizing the rising sun, stag's horns resembling a half-sun, and stags or bulls with solar orbs between or above their horns, and suggests (p. 28) that icons of this type represent a fusion of sexual and solar energy. He concludes (p. 156): "At the center of the Camunian religion-whatever transformations it underwent over the centuries-lay sun worship and stag worship. The two constitute the theme of more than three- quarters of the religious scenes in the Valley." To me, comparing the Camunian art with that of North Africa and Iberia (and with the function of the zodiac in mind), the possibility of a primitive zodiac is also present, in the form of a solar disc divided into seven spokes. The animal entering the solar standard occurs frequently in North African and in Iberian rock art. The theme is suggested in a somewhat different form in the metal "stag" statuettes at Alaca Hiuyiuk (Baity 1968: pl. XXXII, from original at the Hittite Museum in Ankara). MacWhite (1951: fig. 8) shows Galician "stags" (with cows) which I have interpreted as cult bulls wearing stag-horn masks. The stag with solar orb above his horns occurs in Chalcolithic Andalusian iconography, and an animal with a radiant head and legs together in the position of the stag of an Anatolian standard occurs in Africa (Baity 1968: fig. 7A). I need not summarize here the evidence of stag rituals which may imply stag worship and sacrifices: rein- deer-hunters of the Mesolithic, in their summer camps at the edge of the retreating ice cap, threw stags weighed down with stones into a lake and mounted the skulls of reindeer bucks on poles at Stellmoor and Meiendorf, as Alfred Rust discovered. The stag dance at Abbot's Bromley in England is one of many folkloric survivals indicating ancient stag cults in this area. It is premature to attempt a synthesis of the iconographic and folkloric evidence, but I have sug- gested that a stag constellation may have been used as a season indicator for a New Year's ritual cycle before Taurus assumed this function late in the 4th millennium or early in the 3d millennium. Alterna- tively, the stag constellation could have been a parana- tellon: Boll (1904) cites early sources which identify a stag as a paranatellon to Pisces. Finally, the stag could have been an instance of cultural lag, the carrying-over of an earlier symbolic figure. In the absence of reliable dating for rock art, an exact sequence can hardly be formulated at present, but to me the stag appears to have been an older symbol; as mentioned above, certain evidence could be inter- preted as indicating that a horned-animal constella- tion, more often an ibex in the earliest iconography of Mesopotamia and Elam, may have indicated by its heliacal rising the winter solstice (cf. Hartner 1965:9). This question of zodiacal function is to be resolved only by astronomical scholars, but the stag iconography in rock, ceramic, and early metal art suggests the astronomical symbolism of the horn- with-orb symplegma. Grosjean (1969) publishes Corsican rock-art motifs, among them stylized men and cattle that to me suggest the recording of rituals: his figures 1 and 12 may, I suggest, be stylized representations of the mountain peaks which defined the sunrise points of winter and summer solstices. Grosjean notes the obvious resem- blance to Iberian and French rock-art motifs. South- ern Andalusia is a well-documented picture-gallery in which hundreds of such scenes are depicted (cf. Breuil and Burkitt 1929). In many of these scenes bull sacrifices occur with astra motifs in unmistakable evidence of astra-set rituals, the details of which resemble those of ongoing Iberian solstice rituals at midsummer. Ortego y Frias (1951-65) has published rock-art scenes featuring bull rituals with solar sym- bols in contexts which, considered in connection with Bronze Age artifacts found in Soria Province, suggest to him (as to me) that the present midsummer fire walk of San Pedro Manrique and the recently discon- tinued fire bull ritual of Medinaceli had their roots in the ritual cycles of protohistoric ore prospectors and cattlekeepers in this ancient transhumance area. The reappearance of Iberian themes in Ethiopian rock art has been discussed by Breuil (1934) and Graziosi (1964). Saharan rock-art scenes by the hundreds have been recorded by Lhote (1952, 1966, 1970), Lajoux (1963), Moni (1964), and Huard (1959-68; Beck and Huard 410 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="23">Baity: ARCHAEOASTRONOMY AND ETHNOASTRONOMY 1969). Each of these has published many works not listed here, supported by extensive bibliographies; as these works are readily found in libraries, I need not emphasize the importance to ethnoastronomy of the Ibero-Saharan continuum other than to note that astronomical symbolism is clearly recognized. Huard (1959, 1961) notes the frequency of association of the solar disc with cattle and Lhote (1970) with rams. Huard (1966) sees evidence that a spiral design is linked to the bull rituals: he documents bull-transport and shows bull robes (1968). Simoneau (1968) shows circles which appear to be directional and which to me seem to have elements in common with the "Union Jack" design of crossed lines, a probable solstice and equinox schematic motif. (The "Union Jack" [cf. Baity 1968: pl. XXIX; Ortego y Frias 1965: pl. III, fig. I) has been studied in depth by Audin [1945, 1956] and found by Charriere [1964:166, fig. 2] in the Crucuno rectangle and also in Etruscan and early Roman architectural design; CharriZere suggests that in carrying the design to the Roman forum, the Romans may not have observed that the solstice azimuths indicated the latitude of Etruria rather than that of Rome. The design reappears in a stylistic version in pre-Christian painted ceramics of the Celtiberian town of Numantia [Soria] published by Wattenberg [1963:2-1261], where it occurs with identifiable astra motifs; in this ware, a double fish suggestive of Pisces, which during this period was approaching its period of announcing the spring equinox by its heliacal rising, is shown above an icon strongly resembling Hartner's [1965: fig. 23] proposed symbol for a heliacal rising.) Hampate Ba' and Dieterlen (1966) report rock-art motifs indicating magic and religion. Lhote (1952) has queried Tuareg of the Hoggar with reference to "geometrical" designs published by Monod (1938). Although other Tuareg did not re- cognize the designs, an ironworker responded at once that they represented stars (including the sun). The star groups he cited included those known to us as Orion, the Great Bear, the Pleiades, and the Hare, but neither names nor descriptions match those of the Middle Eastern constellations for which Campos (1953) gives the Arabic names. This suggests that a system unlike that of the Middle East existed in the Sahara, perhaps connected with ironworkers, who are known to folklorists to preserve vestiges of an ancient cult. The icons do, however, have obvious parallels in the rock art of other areas of the Ibero- Saharan continuum. The dating of Ibero-Saharan rock art is an unsolved problem (Pericot and Ripoll 1964:191-214). The earlier stages of the Saharan cattlekeepers' rock art may date back well over 5,000 years (Lhote, personal communication, 11 xi 65), and the cattlekeepers' culture may date to the 5th millen- nium. Butzer (1966:78-79), reviewing the palaeocli- matic sequences in the Sahara, notes the difficulty in dating, but suggests as a working hypothesis that the period ca. 5500-2350 B.C. was comparatively moist, with savanna woodlands probably present on the best-watered highlands and good pastures proba- bly available seasonally on the remaining uplands and in most of the wadi systems (which supports the rock-art evidence of herding). To my thinking, much of the rock art suggests astra-oriented rituals, with stag, bull, and ram motifs indicating the presence of a cult resembling that of Iberia and also of Western Asia, as well as that of Egypt. Which way the current flowed, or whether similar cults developed from a far older tradition, is not clear. East African rock art is sporadic; that seen by me resembles Bushman art, but Chaplin (1958) identifies among cattle scenes found near Lake Victoria a pictograph to which he plausibly gives a calendric interpretation. South Afri- can rock art has reGognized Asian-type motifs (Slack 1962). The origin of the Saharan astra and cattle icono- graphic complex may be more clear when Anati has published further studies of the themes represented in materials collected by the Philby-Rycksmans-Lip- pens expedition in 1951-52 to Saudi Arabia: Anati (1968) points out that these data represent an irre- placeable means of investigation, hardly an overstate- ment. Asian connections, the earliest of which may have existed when both Arabia and the Sahara were ment. Asian connections, the earliest of which may have existed when both Arabia and the Sahara were sufficiently green to support herds, are indicated by the fact that humped cattle were introduced into prehistoric Africa on several occasions; as the hump breeds out rapidly, fresh reappearances of the stock may be documented by the iconography (J. Desmond Clark, personal communication, 28 v 68). The tur- ban-wearing men accompanied by elaborately dressed and coiffed women riding cattle and taking part in ritual activities involving both branch and astra sym- bols are of an unmistakably Western Asian ethnic type, many displaying "the nose" famous in Iran and Armenia. Though disagreement has existed with regard to the dating of the North Africa art, Anati has given provisional 3d-millennium dates to some of the Central Arabian drawings, on the basis of comparisons with Egyptian artifacts. It will be of interest to see whether he finds motifs corresponding to the Saharan series of horned animals carrying discs or of animals entering circles or ovoid forms, which may imply the early use of a zodiac in this area; a comparison with the contellations referred to by Lhote's (1952) Tuareg blacksmith would also be of interest. The importance of Africa for ethnoastronomy is indicated not only by the Ibero-Saharan rock art but also by Bronze Age artifacts indicating a West African trading zone in communication with Atlantic cultures (Souville 1965). Egyptian records testify to early trade with the East Coast, while periploi and early Arabic historians describe later trade. The presence of far earlier proto-Indian traders has been surmised on linguistic evidence, and to me Dravidian elements appear present in cattle cults. For these reasons a synthesizing review of the ethnoastronomy studies is needed. Afro-Arabic chronologies of the Ahaggar region are studied by Dubief (1942). Wassef (1971:42) states that the 12th month in the ancient Coptic calendar, Mesore, took its name from the fact that Vol. 14 - No. 4 - October 1973 411</page><page sequence="24">in ancient Egypt it was consecrated to the festival of the heliacal rising of Sirius (Sothis), considered the time of birth of the sun god Re (Mesu-Re). The Coptic Me'sore is distinguished for its "saint's days," the list including a number of names which I have found to be associated with the fire rituals: one peculiarity of these saints is that their legends tend to reach a vanishing point around the 4th century A.D., and another is that in attributes and names they are remarkably similar to deities and cult heroes and heroines associated with fire-ritual legends. (Their names also tend to occur as place names in megalithic areas of France, Spain, and Italy.) The importance of Sirius in the Sudan as an indication of changing seasons is indicated by Griaule and Dieterlen (1950); South Sudanese cosmologies are discussed by Zahan (1951, 1958) and tribal calendars by Sabater (1953). Lagercrantz (1952) studies beliefs about the Milky Way, also noted by Monod (1963), along with much other significant data. The survey by Laoust (1921) of Berber fire and solstice rituals is especially valuable for its analysis of ancient rituals, some of which resemble those shown in the rock art, and for the preservation of cultic chants; the resemblance of the solstice rituals to the intensified fire and cattle rituals of megalithic areas in Western Europe ag,ain suggests the pre-Indo-European origin of the solstice fiestas and raises the question of ancient survivals, some of which may remount to the megalithic cultures. The megalithic culture practices surviving in Mada- gascar again are of interest. Bloch (1968, 1971) emphasizes the role of astrology in the burial practices of the Merina of Madagascar, a society of Southeast Asian origin practicing megalithic burial associated with bull sacrifices. The purpose of reburial in joint tombs is shown to be the need to incorporate the dead into the unchanging kinship order of the ances- tors, a practice related to the fear of anyone not among the havana (kinsmen). The significance at- tached to cardinal points (towards which all structures are aligned) and to the northeast (summer solstice?) is noted. The ritual bull play which takes place before the bull sacrifices belongs to an ancient pattern illustrated in Ibero-Saharan rock art (Baity 1968). The archaeology of Central Asia from the 6th to the 3d millennium B.C., summarized by Masson in a book reviewed by Van Loon (1971), has produced goat horn cores showing traces of torsion, suggesting the possibility of something similar to the horn cult practices accompanying zodiacal symbolism in Sa- haran rock art. This finding perhaps indicates an ancient heritage shared by cultures practicing irriga- tion agriculture in the 5th millennium B.C. Masson notes that the Central Asian 6th-millennium commu- nities technologically resembled the early village cul- tures in Southeast A sia (notably Phase I at Sialk, dated to around 5500-4600 B.C.). The Anau IB period (renamed Namazga I) shows stylized ibex, an icon that appears in painted pottery as early as Namazga IV, in company with a full range of motifs suggesting astra rituals visible since Namazga III (e.g., compare Hartner 1965 with Tretiakov and Mongait 1961: fig. 25, nos. 3c-6). As Soviet archaeologists including Formozov ( 1955, 1966, 1969) have studied solar, lunar, and stellar symbols on petroglyphs, data exist for comparative studies in depth of specific sites and classes of motifs from an early date to the historic cultures. Iconographic clues and surviving rituals suggesting the presence of early astronomical cults around the Black Sea indicate that the earliest known astronomical sources should be carefully examined and compared: Kulikovsky (1967) surveys valuable sources in the U.S.S.R. and Tumanyan (1967) cites early sources in Armenia. Rock-art representations from the area of the "glass mounds" Allchin (1963) has excavated in the Deccan show bulls wearing torch structures between their horns; Allchin cites similar representations on the painted burial urns from Harappa, Cemetery H, and notes fire bull rituals surviving in South India and connected with the winter solstice. In Bali, as in Madagascar, the association of buffalo bull and cow attends burial practices: here again, much is of interest in connection with ethnoastronomy and megalithic survivals. Goris (n.d.) traces temple practices not to India but to megalithic sanctuaries, and stresses the importance of the sun god Surya and the survival of stepped pyramids, menhirs, and zodiacal symbolism. Friederich (1959:45) may throw light on the association of fire rituals with a name like Sori (or Sauri), as in Bali these are names both for Vishnu and for the planet Saturn. Here a type of fire dance survives both in the Hinduized villages and in the hill villages where pre-Hindu culture elements predominate. Despite some differences, to me the Oceanic fire (or oven) dances clearly show in ritual and legend their connection with the Eurasian fire walk or dance (Baity 1962). Indonesian culture patterns have been analyzed in detail by Dutch students other than Goris. In well-documented studies. Maass (1920-33) surveys Balinese and Malay astronomy and astrology. It is of interest in connection with the study of the zodiac that the Balinese rasi, used for astrological purposes, uses the classical figures known in India except that a water-pitcher occurs in place of Aquarius and a shrimp (udang-makara) in place of the ram, which to me suggests the survival of an early zodiac (cf. Friederich 1959:156). Here, too, the crab-lobster- shrimp symbolism receives a possible interpreta- tion-that in shedding its outgrown shell and growing a new one, this creature became the symbol of death and resurrection. In view of the association made by Heras (1953) between the crab and the city of Mohenjo-daro, it is tempting to surmise that proto- Indians may have recognized such a symbolism. Ethnoastronomy in Oceania is of particular interest for several reasons: astronomical lore and techniques may have diffused from Southeast Asia and Indonesia with both the pre-Tangoreans and the later voyagers, and despite the lack of extreme seasonal changes and the absence of most of the food crops and animals associated with Neolithic astronomical rituals there appears to have been a persistence of the Neolithic pattern of determining planting seasons and the New Year by the heliacal rising of the Pleiades and other constellations (the cosmic setting also appeared); at least one of the intensifie.d fire rituals-the fire 412 C U R R E N T A N T H R O P O L O G Y</page><page sequence="25">Baity: ARCHAEOASTRONOMY AND ETHNOASTRONOMY walk-which were part of the New Year's ritual cycle in Asia (and in Mesoamerica) survived despite the scarcity of wood, its legends changed but still recog- nizable. Navigational astronomy was vitally important during both the colonization period and the later exploration and trading phases. Finally, discovery was so recent that the possibility of recovering aboriginal lore and skills is not totally lost. Though no systematic study of the entire region is known to me, data exist for a valuable synthesizing study, as various of the island groups have been the subject of specific eth- noastronomy studies (cf. Best 1955; Bryan 1933; Collocott 1923; Erdland 1910; Goodenough 1951, 1953; Grimble 1931; Makemson 1938-39,1941; Nils- son 1920; Phillips 1966; Stimson 1928). An extensive series of studies in American ethnoas- tronomy benefits from aboriginal and early postcon- quest texts and iconography and from the survival in many areas of oral traditions, astra cults, and calendric rituals (Spinden 1940, Taylor 1946, Zerries 1952, Stirling 1945). Fray Diego Duran's (Horcasitas and Heyden translation, 1971) remarkable account of the gods, rites, and ancient calendar provides data to compare with surviving rituals. The Popul Vuh (Goetz and Morley translation, 1950) is a poetic statement of precontact beliefs that show surprising similarities to Biblical cosmology. The close correla- tion of pre-Columbian dance and ritual with astra-set dates is shown by Kurath and Marti (1960), as is the resemblance to Asian rituals, considered coinci- dental by the authors. The Maya codices have a heavy astronomical content. Archaeoastronomers and eth- noastronomers can all too well understand the wail of horror that went up from Maya astronomer-priests when in July of 1562 some 27 codices and about 5,000 stelae were destroyed at the direction of Bishop Diego de Landa. If, as De Landa feared, the Devil had inspired these writings, he had thoughtfully employed his time as Morning Star and has subse- quently shown a commendable scholarly productivity: over 3,000 articles which touch on Mexican astronomy have been written during this century (Noriega, personal communication, 31 xii 70). (See, e.g., Bow- ditch 1901; Bunge 1970; Burland 1950, 1954, 1964, 1970; Caso 1947, 1950,1958; Henseling 1938; Kelley 1954-71; Spinden 1940; Weitzel 1948, 1950.) The many writings of Noriega (1954, 1956, 1958) are significant: in particular, his studies of eclipses of the sun as registered in the astronomical monuments of Mexico, his work on calendars, and his suggested interpretation of various astronomical glyphs should repay study. In a long series of publications since 1933, Schulz (1933-68; Cook de Leonard and Schulz 1947) has examined various aspects of Maya chronol- ogy, including the solar year, the recording of eclipses of the sun and moon, the various correlations between the Maya and the Christian calendars, and other problems in the understanding of Maya astronomy. Schulz (1964) sums up the precise work of Maya students of the moon's movements, of solar and lunar eclipses, and of the creation of the Long Count. The classic Maya are known to have elaborated into an astonishingly exact science certain calendric principles shared with other Mesoamerican people (Morley 1956; Smiley 1960a,b, 1971; Thompson 1971), but where and when were these principles originally formulated? The Maya solar year of 365- plus days is based on objective astronomical fact, but its organization into 18 months of 20 days each, with a period of 5 extra days, is a cultural construct which does not fit the synodic lunar month (Beyer 1936a,b). The Maya sacred calendar of 260 days was similar to that of the Mexican culture and until recently was not commonly considered to have been based on astronomical phenomena. Smiley (1964) and stu- dents have suggested, however, that the sacred calen- dar was based on such sophisticated astronomical calculations that the connection has escaped observa- tion: studying a pair of cycles in the Dresden Codex, they note that these cycles may represent a Maya astronomer's attempt to tie the synodic periods of Mercury, Venus, and Mars-taken as 117, 585, and 780 days respectively-with the sacred calendar of 260 days (9 x 260 = 2,340 = 20 x 117 = 4 x 585 = 3 x 780). The Maya calendar round, a 52-year cycle, does not match the 56 holes of the Aubrey Circle or the astronomically unaccepted 56-year eclipse cycle, but Maya astronomers had developed their own method of predicting solar eclipses (cf. Harber 1969). They may have used more easily observed regularities such as the phases of Venus, as described in the Dresden Codex for a period of almost 104 years. Smiley (1971) gives names with built-in mnemonic devices to Maya eclipse cycles: "Thix" (36 x 260 = 9,360 days) and "Fox" (46 x 260 = 11,960 days). At the archaeoastronomy seminar in Norman, Oklahoma, in 1971, discussion revealed that Smiley's (1960) correlation differs from Kelley's in that Kelley sees a spring equinox as the Zero Day. Smiley and Robinson (1969) set Zero Day at July 23, 3392 B.C., and suggest that the constellations indicate that this date was chosen because Procyon was precisely on the celestial equator, rising and setting in two exactly opposite directions, with Antares and the Pleiades near. Makemson's correlation, however, sets Zero Day at March 10, 3374 B.C. (Nancy Owen, personal communication, 12 iv 72). From an examination of 57 dates of astronomical significance, Smiley uses his correlation of Maya and Christian calendars to locate the Dresden Codex as covering the interval 103 B.C. to A.D. 812, the Paris Codex A.D. 551-638, and the Madrid Codex A.D. 662-714, with one date A.D. 1250. Smiley's (1968a) studies of stationary conjunctions and near-conjunctions and (1968b) of "serpent dates" invite cross-cultural com- parisons. Smiley (1965b) has also studied orientations by sextant and sun. In addition (Smiley, personal communication, 8 v 71), he and students have mea- sured true azimuth at some 16 important Mesoameri- can sites, uncovering significant indications of a slowly changing reference direction, almost certainly astro- nomical, in a study which also indicates Maya units of length. His 1971 paper suggests that "errors" attributed to Maya astronomers may be attributed to the failure of modern students to study the skies and the known stellar events for the time under Vol. 14 No. 4 October 1973 413</page><page sequence="26">consideration. Anderson (1971) shows that the Maya numerical system, which, like the Babylonian, com- bines properties of place-value and non-place-value, resembles the calendric notation system. Andree (n.d.) indicates the importance of the Pleiades with refer- ence to Mesoamerican agriculture and New Year's festivities. Proskouriakoff (1952) suggests the survival into the Colonial period of a Maya counting system. American iconography, whether calendric or oth- erwise, appears to have been strongly tied to astro- nomical themes (cf. Hagar 1906-31, Kelley 1960-71, Moran and Kelley 1969). Johnson (1971) has identi- fied small cruciform objects found associated with burials as stellar symbols inlaid in a special type of atlatl, the xonicuilli, associated with the wind god Quetzalcoatl, a legendary culture-bearer: Sahagiun and others identify the xonicuilli as symbolizing stars or a constellation. Reko (1936:16), on the basis of a passage of the Chumayel text, indicates that precious stones were metaphorical representations of the astra and that the images of the deities themselves symbol- ized the stars, presumably including the planets. (This interpretation compares interestingly with the infor- mation given by the Finnish team that the planets were deities in the Indus religion.) Ferguson (1962) describes five calendar seals he has found at Chiapa de Corzo (Chiapas, Mexico) with radiocarbon dates ranging from approximately 1050 B.C. to A.D. 400: he submitted an impression of one of the seals to Albright and quotes him as noting a resemblance to Egyptian hieroglyphics. Von Winning (1959) dis- cusses the astronomical symbolism on a carved human femur rattle, the function of which was to provide musical accompaniment in Aztec funeral ceremonies for warriors; his analysis emphasizes the use of an eye as a solar symbol (i.e., light) and cites iconography connected with blood sacrifices to the sun. In a computerized study of signal importance for archaeoastronomy, Owen (1972) rechecks Makem- son's (1946) correlation of the Mayan-Gregorian cal- endars, finding significant astronomical events indi- cating that the Dresden Codex describes the astro- nomical events upon which the ritual events described by De Landa were based. The emphasis on solstice and equinox events is confirmed, but Owen's data, like Smiley's, indicate far more complex observations. Her detailed astronomical descriptions of the Dresden Codex dates (according to Makemson) should stimu- late further ethnoastronomical research into interre- lationships between ritual, calendric, and astronom- ical events, not only in Mesoamerica but in adjacent areas. Her work also affords data for determining the meaning of glyphs adjacent to those already known (cf. Cline 1970; Evreinov, Kosarev, and Ustin- ov 1961; Hochleitner 1970a,b). She indicates the significant observations with regard to the Pleiades; citing De Gallatay (1959) as stating that a culmination of stars in the Pleiades at midnight was an occasion for a service of great solemnity among Peruvians, she gives data making it possible to check this event with ethnographic descriptions of Mesoamerican rit- uals. Zuidema (1966) discusses the importance of the Inca calendar for social organization, ceremonial life, and agricultural practice. He deduces that the Incas knew the function of the zodiac and used solstice determinations in the construction of the solar calen- dar, but connected many rituals with lunar phases. Rauh (1971), tentatively reconstructing the Peruvian calendar system, sees Venus as the only planet at present known by a native word, which he infers to indicate that the Venus cult had a significant place in the Peruvian cosmology. He suggests a two-year calendar period as important on the basis of frequent references and as allowing an even division by lunar months. The data on calendars is well indexed and in general will not be reviewed here, but it may be noted that Graebner (1921) and many later scholars have seen resemblances between the New World aboriginal calendars and those of the Old World. Mesoamerican referents have been found for astra- determined rituals in aboriginal North America, and diffusion from Mexico into the Southwest is recog- nized (Schroeder 1965, 1966). Wissler and Spinden's (1916) and Weltfish's (1965) studies of the Pawnee Morning Star girl-sacrifice point out parallels with data in codices indicating an Aztec origin. Kurath and Marti (1964:212) describe a bow-and-arrow fer- tility dance also common to the two cultures. The Pawnee ethnography by Weltfish is a model in that it is sufficiently detailed to permit comparison with both Mesoamerican and Eurasian rituals, which show strikingly similar features. Buckstaff (1927) indicates Pawnee interest in single stars and constellations. Tooker's (1970) study of the Iroquois winter-solstice festival indicates this ritual's former dating by the appearance of the Pleiades in the zenith at dusk of the new moon, which the researcher finds comparable to an Aztec ritual, the new-fire kindling at a winter- solstice ritual also timed by the Pleiades in the zenith (Prescott 1843:125-27; Andree n.d.). The Iroquois Green Corn ceremonial was apparently a summer-sol- stice event; that the collection of such data is "salvage ethnology" is only too obvious from its present dating from a drugstore calendar. Witthoft (1946) studies the winter-solstice ritual of the Cayuga. A significant topic for American ethnoastronomical research is the dating of the New Year's rituals. Nuttall (1888, 1906), among others, has compared Meso- american New Year's rituals and astronomical meth- ods. We have seen that North American archaeoas- tronomy shows unmistakable emphasis on solstice-de- termining structures. As calendric rituals have been investigated by almost every observer of Indians since Morgan, an extensive literature affords scope for comparative ethnoastronomy studies (cf. Parsons 1939a,b). Benchley (1970) studies Mississippian ca- lendrics, a topic of special interest in view of Meso- american correspondences. She suggests a method for studying the early astronomical calendars used in mound-building areas. As yet such studies are rare, and those under way are for the most part unpub- lished; aside from these, insufficient attention has been paid to the measurement of the structures which would have been essential to the determination of solstices and equinoxes and thus necessary in the setting up of calendric rituals and the determination of the dates for agricultural events. Father Durain 414 C U R R E NT A N TH ROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="27">Baity: ARCHAEOASTRONOMY AND ETHNOASTRONOMY has indicated that these were of extreme importance in aboriginal agriculture. INTERPRETATION AND IMPLICATIONS The overall implication of studies reviewed here is that astronomical knowledge formed an important aspect of culture processes from the Paleolithic on- ward. Marshack's microanalyses suggest that Europe- an Paleolithic men kept daily records of lunar phases, relating the astronomical to the seasonal phenomena and fitting observations into a complex symbolic system, subtle and varied, which was expressed in cave paintings and in mobiliary art. Cave paintings also suggest the presence of dance-drama rituals with musical accompaniment. As recognition of lunar phases would inevitably have drawn attention to the shift of moonrise and moonset along the horizon, and as animal migrations and plant growth were associated with seasonal changes initiated by solstices and equinoxes (the shift of sunrise along the horizon being equally obvious, though taking much longer), the recording of lunar phases implies the possibility that the solstices were associated with ritual obser- vances far earlier than we may have thought. What- ever is true of Paleolithic burials, Mesolithic burials appear to have been associated with solar positions. When the pictures of the animal (or deity) forms were first projected on the starry heavens (i.e., the first constellations marked out) is problematical. If the bull and stag cult scenes from Chatal Hiiyiik involve astronomical symbolism, as is suggested by the association of such scenes with unmistakable solar-stellar symbolism in later iconography, then the deities in their theriomorphic forms may have had heavenly counterparts as early as the 8th millennium, and there is little question of it by the time of the star-surrounded bulls of Tell Halaf painted pottery. By the 4th and 3d millennia, the association of a specific bull and stag cult with solar-stellar symbolism is present in art in Western Asia, in North Italy, along both sides of the Mediterranean, and in Iberia, in contexts which imply not only the recognition of a link between the solar events and the New Year but also the possession of a solar zodiac, perhaps in a primitive stage in the earliest representations, but present as the zodiac we know by the 3d millennium in Sumer. The impact of Thom's work with regard to the technical attainments of the British and Continental Neolithic astronomer-engineers, combined with Ren- frew's suggested dating revision, has been to make it clear that in this early period Britain was in truth that "nest of calculating geniuses" originally called into question by Hawkes (1967). Atkinson's (1968b, 1969, 1970) excavations at Silbury Hill show it to have been a flat-topped stepped pyramid during construction in Neolithic times: the flat top, again, suggests the possibility of an observation station or perhaps of a site for bonfires to signal calendar events. While in general it has been considered that these skills were "made in Britain," the high dates for the Breton tombs suggest that the elements of observa- tional astronomy and of structural orientations may have come to Britain with the megalithic undertakers. It is of course highly significant that Thom finds not only the same egg-shaped designs in Brittany, but also the same megalithic yard; he feels that the unit must have been transported in rods issued by a controlling center (Thom, personal communication, 5 xi 71). For Britain, Thom and MacKie (1969:8) postulate a time-span of some 2,000 peaceful years, coinciding perhaps with a drier climatic phase afford- ing clearer skies (and, incidentally better maritime travel conditions), between the arrival of the Neolithic farmers and that of the Beaker people. Such a span of time would allow for an immense range of trial- and-error stake-setting observations on the part of an astronomical elite in search of techniques affording dependable eclipse warnings. Scottish observatories, according to Thom (197 1), were capable of furnishing just the precise information needed for exact predic- tion. To a later elite less dependent on oracular prestige than on bronze weapons, such skills may have appeared irrelevant if not positively suspect, and, as both Hoyle and MacKie suggest, Stonehenge III may well have been more impressive for dramatic decor than for astronomical exactitude. (Palynological evidence cited by Frenzel [1966:99] suggests that the early megalithic observers might, as Thom sug- gests, have had better observational conditions than the later ones; the findings indicate a cold spell ca. 3400-3000 B.C., with a deterioration of climate [wetter and colder growing seasons] after ca. 1500 B.C. [dates uncorrected by the bristlecone pine calibration].) Archaeoastronomical studies indicate that well be- fore the final phases of Stonehenge reconstruction the cognitive abilities of British and Breton engineer- astronomers enabled them to measure with increasing precision complex lunar movements, including minor perturbations: the suggestion that these were used to refine eclipse prediction methods implies impres- sive ritual observance, further suggested by French megalithic folklore. Significantly, it is Atkinson (1968a:78) who most seriously considers the far- reaching implications of megalithic astronomy and of the backdating which will be necessary if the bristlecone pine chronology is established: If we accept the evidence here presented by Professor Thom (in such detail that the reader can check all stages of the argument), and if we concur in even a part of his conclusions (which are drawn with the most scrupulous regard for the legitimate limits of inference), we must alter radically our current view of the intellectual calibre of man in Britain in the late third and second millennium B.C. Indeed, we must consider the revision of a whole chapter in the accepted history of science, in which primacy in the development of geometry, mensuration, observational astronomy and the calendar has been ascribed hitherto to the literate civilizations of the Ancient East. And again (Atkinson 1971:117): "Those who cannot follow Thom's argument here will, if they are honest, surrender on grounds of ignorance; if they are not, they will retreat to a position of equivocal nescience." Vol. 14 * No. 4 * October 1973 415</page><page sequence="28">Scholars are notoriously combative in defense of their own views and no more inclined to surrender or retreat than is the population at large; it cannot be said, however, that they are unable to read the writing on the wall, and the implications of what the moving finger is inscribing in a fair sample of the world's areas are becoming increasingly clear: namely, that the possibility of astronomical alignments must be considered in connection with seasonal cults, burials, and structures. Archaeoastronomy implies an unexpectedly high level of Neolithic astronomy-the discovery of objec- tive astra phenomena, the orientation of sacred struc- tures with reference to complex astronomical targets, and the analysis of the moon's precise movements- and this knowledge is confirmed by early astronomical texts and by astra iconography on painted ceramics, walls, and rock surfaces. The presence of similar motifs in areas where writing, if it existed, was on perishable materials implies the possible inheritance of techniques and information from prehistoric cul- tures. The early presence of lunar notations, consid- ered in connection with the iconography indicating the recognition not only of equinoxes and solstices but also of their relationships with the rising and setting of various star groups, indicates that a complex educational system of an intellectual elite must have been established earlier than previous conceptions of the Neolithic have held. It is harder to recognize the geographical extent of these common techniques and subjective constructs: the presence of similar units of measurement and similar orientations and con- structions implies the possible existence of similar cosmologies and ritual cycles. The subjective con- structions, including zodiacs and lunar houses with sequences of similar sacred animal and deity figures, certainly as old as Elam and Sumer, but apparently known also in China and in the Indus culture (from which area the concepts appear to have spread at a later date to Mesoamerica), imply somewhat more than trade operating from one area to the next by barter methods. These correspondences are both too singular and too massive to be explained away as coincidence, psychology, or parallel develop- ment, although, in this preliminary synthesizing study, there is no space to document them fully. The suggested correspondences between the megalithic yard, the Egyptian remen, the Spanish vara, and other units of measurement again cannot be dismissed without further investigation (Thom 1967; cf. MacKie 1968:283; see also Fletcher 1968a,b,c, 1969; Ivimry 1969). The singularly appropriate sites of Stonehenge, Callanish, Er Grah, and many other suggested mega- lithic observatories imply a degree of sophisticated geographical knowledge, and it has been noted that the mathematical and engineering skills of megalithic designers could in time have led to a realization of the spherical shape of the earth (whether or not they did). The nautical astronomy reported for early sailors of the Black Sea, the Indian Ocean, and the Mediter- ranean and the size indicated for megalithic-age ships are again suggestive, as is the archeologically attested evidence of Bronze Age traders on the Atlantic Coast of Africa and in the Pontic steppes. The hints of ancient prime meridians in Africa and in Iran suggest forgotten coordinate systems the knowledge of which disappeared with the elite which established them. Evidence from Ptolemy (Peters and Knobel 1915) to Baschmakoff (1937, 1948) suggests that mariners could have profited from a wider geographical knowledge than we have assumed. The evidence of early calendars and folkloric survivals has yet to be synthesized, but the studies listed here suggest close correspondences over wide areas. Studies of the zodiac imply that a precise place of origin and a relatively precise dating may soon be determined: the suggestive coordinates of latitude and longitude leave a wider choice than Ovenden's Mediterranean island; to me Minoan iconography does not suggest the preoccupation with the astra that is visible in several other areas. In general, the evidence appears to indicate that astronomical lore, astra and deity symbolism, and seasonal rituals set by astra events and considered essential to successful agriculture and stockbreeding were part of the Neolithic mixed-farming tool-kit traveling along with seeds and stocks, with an origin perhaps as early as the 9th millennium. To me, the extremely widespread distribution of remarkably similar summer-solstice rites, including not only bon- fires and other fire ceremonies but a ritual mating and human sacrifice (vestiges of which are implied both in European and Berber summer-solstice cus- toms), implies a far earlier origin. It is premature to attempt to attach the observation of solstices and equinoxes and of specific constellations and stars to the early Neolithic expansion, yet certain widespread similarities with regard to the circumpolar constella- tions and to the use of the Pleiades as season indicators imply this possibility. However, the highly specific rituals attached to a spring equinox and a zodiac, especially appropriate to agricultural activities, may be associated with the zodiacal constellations which had a heliacal rising in the early Bronze Age. Thus subsequent research may indicate the interplay of two patterns for the New Year, one tied to the solstices and another to the spring equinox. Though the hypothesis cannot be documented at present, the great emphasis on the summer-solstice rituals in areas where the megalithic cultures were evident does imply a possible connection, and this tradition may well be older than the food-producing revolution. The much more limited and spotty distribution of highly specific, even singular, rituals such as that of the fire bull (evident in rock art and ceramics from India to Iberia, with evidence suggesting an Ethiopian center) and the possible linking of this ritual with the heliacal rising of Taurus to mark the spring equinox imply a far later origin within a specific culture, probably one with overseas colonies interest- ed in procuring some specific product (perhaps tin).23 23The suggestion that economic motivations implemented the distribution of zodiacal symbolism and fire rituals associated with New Year's renewal festivities is supported by Dayton's (1971) study of the occurrence of tin ores and of natural bronzes in the ancient world and his note that the techniques of controlled kiln firing served equally in the production of certain ceramics. 416 C U RRENT AN TH ROPOLOG Y</page><page sequence="29">Baity: ARCHAEOASTRONOMY AND ETHNOASTRONOMY I have proposed that both Indus and Iberian traders may have been involved in a trans-African trade which skirted the Arabian peninsula; and Lamberg- Karlovsky (1967:149) locates tin in Trucial Oman, well within the Indus colonial sphere (Bibby 1966, 1969). The bull rituals are strongly evident in early Dravidian literature but are equally evident in Iberian customs, the humped bull appearing in rock art along the continuum. Whether this implies Indus colonies in Africa and perhaps in Iberia or Iberian traders extending their activities to East Africa and perhaps beyond (or more likely both) is not at present clear, but it is hard to imagine that a toro de fuego ritual would have had two centers of origin. This ritual is also unquestionably practiced at the summer sol- stice, as it is even now among the Basques in a symbolic form; whether this is by association with earlier summer-solstice fire rituals or not is unclear, though further studies in depth of specific iconograms and astra rituals may clarify this. Lamberg-Karlovsky (1970:80), in his analysis of the corpus of Tepe Yahya material indicating a 3d- millennium literate culture in an area identified with Magan, discovers no direct Indus or Mesopotamian material but does note identical design motifs on steatite bowls which may have been gifts serving to oil the wheels of trade, on the "kula ring" principle. The Tepe Yahya finds support the concept that each cultural area along the Indus-Mesopotamian trading continuum had its own local middlemen who met at common ports of call on neutral territory, as suggested by Polanyi (1963:30-45). The Danish team's discovery of large Indus trading communities at Bahrein and in Saudi Arabia indicates one area, however, where Indus settlers and Mesopotamian traders met (Bibby 1966, 1969). Thus the evidence of specific astronomical or astra- set rituals suggests that such activities accompanied early Bronze Age ore prospectors and traders to ports of call and to trading colonies which have not yet been discovered, perhaps because they are located on offshore islands subject to flood damage and in regions where desert conditions (and political condi- tions as well) have made their recovery difficult or impossible. Further, Ozpu? (1963) has shown that such colonists left few traces except baked clay tablets, as they depended on the local market both for furnishings and for wives: records left on perishable materials would have left no trace. Inferential evi- dence suggests that Indus, Iranian, Old Assyrian, and Phoenician traders used astronomy for naviga- His study indicates Bohemia and probably Iberia as centers in which the use of natural bronze (stannite) preceded its commercial production. I suggest that the distribution of early tin workings in Western Europe and perhaps even in Africa may parallel that of some of the bull and fire rituals attached to astra occasions. Bronze torques appear to have figured in the trade. Iberia flowed, Strabo tells us, with electrum, a natural alloy of gold and silver. The collapse of ancient trading with the destruction of Troy II and the disappearance of the Minoan culture did not put a stop to ore production and use in areas not affected by tectonic disasters followed by social upheaval. Although the economic interests may have backed the travels of traders and astrologers, we have seen evidence that the astronomical elite were no less interested in the cosmic spectacles they observed than are contemporary astron- omers, who do not have strong economic motives for their studies. tion, with a far wider trading sphere than has been realized, and perhaps unplanned landings on even more distant shores. Indus early sailing has been little studied, but the evidence implies that Indus (or intermediary) sailors could have carried astronomical knowledge and rituals widely. The Finnish team's decoding of Indus documents indicates early Indus- Chinese contacts which must have been well prior to the destruction of the Indus home port towns. While Moran and Kelley suggest later contacts in tracing similarities between Indian, Chinese, and Mesoamerican lunar mansions, and East African similarities to Indian arts and crafts have been attrib- uted to Indonesian settlers, the recent discoveries in Arabia should indicate caution in the denial of earlier contacts. The Phoenicians, who may have inherited far older astronomical and navigational skills, are known to have closely guarded their trade routes and their "factories" (as they called the colonial settlements); their rounding of the Cape of Africa is historically attested. Evidence increasingly suggests that many pre-Columbian voyagers arrived on Amer- ican shores, some of them accidentally, others by intent (Ashe 1971, De Santillana and Von Dechend 1969, Ekholm et al. 1970, Gordon 1971, Meggers, Evans, and Estrada 1965, Morison 1971, Riley et al. 1971). There is no reason to assume that long-term colo- nists such as those of the Old Assyrian karums docu- mented by Ozpui would have given up their astra-set New Year's rituals even though they married local girls coming from cultures with different rituals, and in view of this undeniably close cultural contact the possible survival of rituals with a foreign origin even after the disappearance of the colonies may be im- plied by the evidence of folkloric survivals. Though little material evidence may remain to prove this, various other types of evidence do imply such a possibility. Long before the Danish team found Indus colonies in the Persian Gulf, the sea trade between the Indus and Mesopotamia was postulated on textual and iconographic evidence (Kramer 1963, 1963:64; Leemans 1965). Archaeological findings indicated Harappan outposts and sophisticated Indus port facilities (Dales 1965, Rao 1965). An Indus-Mesopota- mia overland trading continuum operating by means of long-established colonies was suggested on the grounds of stylistic elements in painted cult ceramics by Starr (1941) and on the evidence of the influence of Indus art in the West by Mode (1944), as well as by Sir Aurel Stein's widely scattered ceramic find- ings in Iran, three decades before the Harvard team's (Lamberg-Karlovsky 1970) discovery of the trading center in southeastern Iran. In general, southern Iran, a mound-dotted area, appears on the basis of traditional and early Arabic evidence to be a likely area to investigate in search of a protohistoric astro- nomical center (Moghadam seminar, University of Tehran, 1964-65). Such a possibility might be implied by the finding of astra iconography similar to that of other sites along the area of the continuum sug- gested by Starr. Vol. 14 - No. 4 - October 1973 417</page><page sequence="30">INDICATIONS FOR FURTHER STUDIES The interdisciplinary study of archaeoastronomy, supplemented with the insights which a broader ethnoastronomy can provide, affords the: possibility of a new dimension for archaeology-upward-while ethnoastronomy, looking within ideological struc- tures, must apply the ancient cultic concept, "As above, so below." Although the archaeoastronomical evidence will not be present at all sites to the same degree, it is important that we not be blinded to what is there by the models we have held: Martin (1971:4) has aptly demonstrated such a possibility with the example that prior to the time of Copernicus, Western astronomers, thinking in terms of the Ptole- maic model, regarded the heavens as immutable, whereas the Chinese, uninhibited by such a dogma, were recording the appearance of novae, comets, and sunspots. New working hypotheses based on the evidence indicating the importance of astronomy and astrology in early cultures, particularly in those areas where the religion was predominantly astral, will make it possible for us to examine sites, documents, and rituals in a new and meaningful perspective. As this synthesizing review indicates, many possible working formulations are being and must increasingly be developed. Prehistoric and protohistoric communities in which astronomical subsystems were significantly present may be identified by research testing such formulations as the following: (1) that nondomestic structures in general and those suitable for astronom- ical observations or used for cult purposes in particu- lar will be oriented (door, window, and gate openings, structure profiles, outliers and postholes, arrange- ments of buildings, city plans, and wider constructs) with regard to the major observable astra events of the site and probable era (the rising and setting of the astra, including zodiacal constellations, at the solstices, equinoxes, and possibly at intermediate positions reconciling lunar and solar calendars); (2) that stylistic categories will include astra iconography in wall, rock, and mobiliary arts symbolizing these major astra events (including annular and total eclipses, mountain ranges with brackets or other in- dications of distant markers used for marking solstice extremes, representations of constellations and of deities and animals associated with them in lunar and solar zodiacs) and depicting ritual dramas sym- bolizing them (fire bull and other solstice rituals and astra-oriented games and bull sports); (3) that surviv- als of such rituals or of traditions concerning them (myths, legends, astrological cults, linguistic survivals) may be detected; and (4) that evidences of the diffusion or trading activities of agricultural, stock- breeding, and ore-processing groups practicing the astronomical rituals may be traced through the analy- sis of both archaeoastronomical and ethnoastronomi- cal findings. The development of a new scientific subdiscipline normally demands the subsequent working out of an appropriate methodology and of suitable text- books. Archaeoastronomy, though in its infancy, is a remarkably precocious infant, due largely to Thom's work, its appraisal by British archaeologists (notably Atkinson and MacKie), and Miuller's review of similar megalithic structures on the European continent. Thom's establishment of criteria and methods for archaeoastronomical fieldwork and the archaeological tests of his hypotheses are of major importance. Astronomical evidence can only be discovered by those with a precise idea of what they are looking for, which assumes a detailed knowledge of astra events for the area and era under study as well as the formulation and testing of hypotheses involving geometrical designs and astronomical function. The essential textbooks for archaeoastronomical fieldwork are thus already in existence: the step from megalithic astronomy to a statistically adequate and methodologically sound analysis of the orientations and functions of stones, pyramids, and other sacred structures in various areas is not a difficult one. Students elsewhere can benefit from Thom's precise site-analysis methodology, from his and Newham's emphasis on the significance of postholes for tempo- rary stake and pole sightings, and from his emphasis on the study of site plans with respect to distant markers (notably mountain slopes and gaps, but also, Mesoamerican evidence suggests, pyramids). The use of a computer is not necessary with respect to sun and moon alignments: Newham (personal com- munication, 1 vii 71) estimates that it took him less than four hours in 1962 to establish sun and moon alignments at Stonehenge. Where alignments with target stars must be determined, however, the use of a small computer can be timesaving (cf. Gingerich 1967; Hawkins 1966, 1968; Reyman and Sanders 1972). What is essential is accurate site data, a list of basic alignments for the area and probable era of the site, standard graphs such as Thom has worked out for elevation, refraction, etc., and a meticulous eye for postholes and depressions which may indicate the former presence of posts or outliers. Wittry (1970a: 17) sums the variables up as (1) the latitude of the observer, (2) the inclination of the ecliptic, (3) refraction, and (4) the relationship of the point of observation to the horizon. Anderson and Fletcher (1968) offer a shortcut to the analysis of significant sites between latitudes 600 N and 600 S, plotted for solstices and equinoxes, un- doubtedly important for calendars and ritual dates, though Thom's statistically analyzed orientations in- dicate midquarter dates and Charriere indicates the importance of intermediary orientations. Utmost at- tention is due Thom's plea that reconstructions should not be undertaken without a professional surveying and the consideration of astra referents and that distant markers should be noted and photographed. Above all, the possibility of astronomical corre- spondences over much wider areas than individual sites must be explored, following a more intensive statistical analysis of temple, pyramid, and sacred-city orientations in all areas. Statistical methods need attention, and again here Thom's work provides models. New studies in methodology are in process. The Smithsonian's computer program, followed by Haw- kins, which uses a 100-year interval and interpolates the values in between, differs from that being devel- 418 C U R R E N T A N T H R O P O L O G Y</page><page sequence="31">Baity: ARCHAEOASTRONOMY AND ETHNOASTRONOMY oped by Frank C. Sanders, Jr. and Jonathan Reyman (personal communication, 21 x 71) chiefly in that the latter works in smaller increments of time and is more easily adapted to small machines. In a forth- coming publication, Reyman and Sanders (1972) will give a step-by-step discussion of the collecting and organizing of the archaeoastronomical data. The essential data from astronomers is increasingly avail- able. Interdisciplinary involvement probably will always be essential, but archaeologists are in need of specialized short-term courses in archaeoastron- omy taught by an interdisciplinary staff using demon- strations such as are possible at a planetarium (cf. Weber 1961). The importance of site photography at solstice and equinox (and perhaps intermediate points) is demonstrated by the spectacular pho- tographs of the sun rising behind the Heel Stone at midsummer at Stonehenge (Hawkins and White 1965). Reyman's (1971a) photograph of the midsum- mer rising sun halved by the corner of a pueblo structure is hardly less striking; his photographs also demonstrate that sticks placed in certain holes in the walls define the length of summer-solstice shadows (an ancient method). It is obvious that a first step in archaeoastronomy is the further testing of Thom's methods and hypoth- eses in other megalithic areas, notably the Iberian peninsula, Scandinavia, and the Black Sea region. I have noted that Basque and Caucasian folkloric and linguistic survivals show a strong resemblance, but to my knowledge archaeological findings have not been compared in the two areas: an immense amount of Soviet archaeological documentation awaits synthesis with regard to orientations and to astra iconography. Folklore in all megalithic areas, certainly including the Caucasus region, should be tested for traditions resembling those of Western Asian astronomical cults. Near Eastern astronomy has the practical virtue of being so much better known to us than prehistoric European and American as- tronomy that it should serve usefully as a probing tool. Though archaeoastronomy, studying the material evidence of astronomical knowledge and cults, can move ahead on the basis of methods, criteria, data, and hypotheses already apparent in megalithic as- tronomy, ethnoastronomy has as yet no well formu- lated criteria and no comparable solid data to afford hypotheses for testing. Clearly ethnoastronomers must also know the objective astronomical facts of the area and era, must understand subjective con- structs that have been built on such astra events, must structure and test hypotheses soundly based on systematically observed evidence which, when enough of it has been assembled, also falls into patterns; but where the reconstruction of ritual cycles and religious systems, rather than physical structures, is the task, the chance of wrong reconstructions is of course far greater and proof harder to obtain. Here again, however, the problem of how and where to begin has an obvious answer. With regard to European ethnoastronomy, mega- lithic astronomy also affords a structuring principle. Piggott's (1956) study of the suitability of megalithic monuments for impressive rituals is supported by the evidence of archaeoastronomy: Stonehenge and Carnac would have afforded a particularly dramatic setting for such rituals, but tombs and less spectacular structures would also have served. Students may begin, on the basis of local archaeological findings, with studies in depth aimed at the reconstruction, in broad outline, of the ritual calendar of the mega- lith-builders. The structuring principle to which I refer is that of Thom's suggested megalithic calendar. Though archaeologists have not altogether accepted it and archaeological proof is of course requisite, Thom's calendar appears to me to offer ethnoastron- omers a working hypothesis. In the development of this hypothesis they will have to call upon the skills of folklorists (dance, drama, music),24 linguists, and rock and ceramic art specialists; for Britain, James (1961:272-319) and Alford (1952) will be of great assistance. Thom (1966c) postulates, on the basis of a statisti- cally significant number of alignments, a 16-month calendar determined by the solstices, equinoxes, and midquarter points. His evidence is based on a study of the bearings marked out at megalithic sites. On the hypothesis that each azimuth suggested by orien- tations probably specified the rising or setting point of some celestial object at some particular time, he converted azimuths into declinations (angular dis- tances north and south of the celestial equator): finding that some 60 of the declinations thus obtained grouped themselves about seven declinations, he restudied these seven on the supposition that each represented the solar declination at two separate days of the year, or 16 days during the year. He then compared these with the days in the year 1800 B.C. when the sun had these declinations.25 The matched pairings of these 16 days fit a regular pattern of solstices, equinoxes, and midquarter days, spaced at 24Though the connection between folk music and astronomy may not be immediately apparent, its potential value to ethnoas- tronomy is indicated by the astronomical meanings of dervish dances (recognized by Turkish scholars), the cosmological meanings of some of the classical Indian chants, and the appearance of similar musical instruments (including the bagpipe) in Eurasian areas where the astra-set fire and bull fiestas survive. Struck by the similarities noted in the field, I referred these to Alan Lomax (personal communication, 25 xi 68), who confirmed the resem- blance of the Andalusian modal profile to that of Asia: he notes that the closest similarity is to Central Asia, especially to the Turkmen profile. The percentage of similarity to other cultures is high in areas where either iconography or ritual survivals indicate intensified fire rituals: Turkmen 85%, Sicily and Turkey 76%, Amhara, Ruanda, and Kerala 72% each. He classifies the basic song style of Andalusia as part of a very ancient Old High Culture style area that includes the Mediterranean, Middle and Near East, and India, and notes that certain of the song types, such as the threshing cries, are virtually identical in Egypt, Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Majorca, Spain, and Morocco (a finding of interest in connection with megalithic cultures). Although he describes these as remounting to a very ancient agricultural civilization, I note the similarities of distribution to that of cattlekeepers' iconography and ritual patterns, a suggestion supported by early Tamil textual records of bull sports (cf. Crooke 1917, Lomax 1968). 25 It can hardly be attributed to coincidence that the dates obtained are those of the traditional European calendar rituals: Christmas, Candlemas, the spring equinox, May Day, Midsummer, Lammas, the autumnal equinox, Martinmas, and so back to the winter solstice. That the early Church, doubtless on the principle Vol. 14 * No. 4 * October 1973 419</page><page sequence="32">regular intervals of 23 days (with one 24-day period). It is evident that such a calendar has gone far beyond the unsatisfactory lunar calendar which so plagued the priests of certain cultures. It is also evident that when the astronomical elite disappeared which had kept the calendar geared to the sidereal year, rituals would continue to match the objective astra events only where practical methods survived of determining the solstice points. Following the calibration of Western European ritual cycles with the ritual calendar which megalithic astronomy predictably will soon make available as a working hypothesis, it may be possible to relate the indicated dates to folklore and surviving rituals and to confused astronomical myths and legends (Olcott 1936; Graves 1948, 1957; Erixon 1939). Al- ford's studies of British and Iberian folk dances suggest a strong correlation between Morris dances and solstice festivals, sword dances and ancient mining sites, and the presence of an ancient mountain goddess, often a "black Virgin" (cf. Alford and Gallup 1935; Alford 1937, 1962). These dance and drama cycles parallel the fire, bull, and solstice fiestas to a considerable extent, and the hypothesis appears worth further testing that they date back to a pre-Cel- tic population. Alford observed strong resemblances between the dance forms of Iberia and Central Europe well before the recognition of the early date of the Central European Bronze Age, which Dayton (1971:61) places prior to the appearance of tin bronzes in Eastern Asia (aside from the Royal Tombs of Ur). Dayton documents the presence here, as in Cornwall and Spain, of stannite and mixed ores of tin and copper and disproves the alleged presence of tin in the Caucasus. A major topic for study is that of the possible existence of a sophisticated early geographical knowl- edge; that this is as early as Hapgood (1966) suggests is questioned, but the specific and unique location of several significant megalithic monuments, includ- ing Stonehenge, may imply something more than trial-and-error placement: Charriere (1964:161) sug- gests that Brittany may have been a region of high religious values because here the moon's rising and setting at its extreme positions corresponded to the directional points of the "rose of the winds." Monod (1963:421) suggests independent development for this construct among Chinese and Arab mariners: comparisons of Asian and Mesoamerican designs which suggest derivatives from such a construct have not (to my knowledge) been made (cf., however, Mertz 1969a). Monod's study documents the wide range of early Indian, Arab, and Chinese traders, notes the early use of the Magellan Clouds as a navigation- al aid, and cites the use of the Pleiades as season indicators among various aboriginal peoples of Africa and Oceania. A study in depth of the Taurus and Pleiades iconography and mythology, with a comparison of the symbols designating the group in Asian, Eu- popularly expressed as "what you can't whip you had better join," took over the pagan ceremonies which country people saw no reason to give up is too well-documented to need reviewing here, and saintly robes scarcely disguise many a deposed astral deity. ropean, and the American culture, would be useful in view of suggestions that Mesoamerican structures were oriented to the Pleiades. Early Greco-Asian sky-charts indicate that the Pleiades were once con- ceived as flaming on (or between?) the horns of the Bull, but Mesoamericans associated these stars with different symbols. Hamilton (1902, 1904) identified the Pleiades with the concept of "the isle of the Blest": this constellation, according to both Heras and Par- pola, was known to Indus mariners, and as its heliacal rising announced the spring equinox with precision for a millennium around 3500-2500 B.C. (roughly serving for an even longer period) a comparative study of iconography and traditions connected with it appears useful. Hopkins' (1965) interpretation of scenes on Phoe- nician bowls from the Bernardini tomb in Praeneste (7th century B.C.) as the recording of a total eclipse of the sun raises the question of Phoenician interest in celestial phenomena, a topic insufficiently studied here and elsewhere: Spoer (1938) also similarly ana- lyzes an astrological bowl, indicating a continuing tradition. In view of the importance of Indian Ocean sailing to early maritime trading cultures and of the widespread early Bronze Age trade, studies of early nautical astronomy might be structured with regard to areas significant to Indus traders for products of high value, low bulk, and special interest to the early riverine high cultures: i.e., tin, precious metals, jewels, pearls, spices, and incense. To me coincidence cannot explain the presence in areas where such treasure items are found of names evidently already old when Ptolemy mapped them and to my thinking signifi- cantly resembling those of the "Asuras" of Vedic fame as "masters of the sea" and great astronomers (cf. Shafer 1954). I note also the association of these names with oil-bearing areas, which is perhaps un- derstandable in view of the use of natural asphalt in the torches attached to the horns of fire bulls and also for caulking sewn boats of the type identified with Indus and other early mariners. Though I have stressed the significance of Taurus and the Pleiades, equal interest is attached to other constellations known from Elamite and Sumerian iconography and asso- ciated with the solstices (cf. Hartner 1965:12-15). In short, a structuring principle for further ethnoas- tronomy studies is that of comparing subjective con- structs such as the constellation symbols described by astronomers of early cultures with the natural time-marking astra events of the tropical year. It cannot be too much emphasized that the objective astra facts were roughly the same for the astronomers of cultures existing at approximately the same time and latitude, and that similar observatories and ob- serving methods might well have been used by as- tronomers at a comparable stage of development: the subjective constructs built upon this data, would, however, be culturally determined, and the presence of similar astra iconography, zodiacal symbolism, and mythology deserves careful examination. Further research is indicated in several areas which are scarcely touched in this review. A comparative study of astra names could usefully recheck earlier examinations of correspondences between Meso- 420 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="33">Baity: ARCHAEOASTRONOMY AND ETHNOASTRONOMY american and Western Asian names for stars, constel- lations, and lunar houses. A Dravidian scholar might throw light on the correspondences between the place and ethnic names found in association with the intensified fire, bull, and astra rituals from Iberia to India (Baity 1966a), which appear to match names listed by Shafer (1954) as those of the "Asuras" identified in the Great Rebellion against the Aryans which he believes to have been described in the Mahabharata. In view of the spectacular nature of eclipses and their indicated importance in early cul- tures, a study in depth of eclipse prediction, folklore, and iconography, considered in connection with the known data on the prehistoric occurrence of eclipses, would be of interest (Schwartz 1925, Van den Bergh 1954). A comparative study of New Year's dates and rituals might either indicate the presence of common constructs over wide areas or prove their independent origin (cf. Bonnerjea 1935; Noriega 1954; Guthe 1932; Nuttall 1888). In the ancient cultures the New Year was a time of anxious stock-taking, and the vast literature on judicial and client astrology might contribute insights (cf. Neugebauer and Van Hoesen 1959). Father Duran's references to Mesoamerican astrology merit restudying. Nautical astronomy (cf. Ferrand 1928, Gerrard 1928) is of interest: Arabic terms and methods should be compared with Old Persian terms, which in Iran they are said to strongly resemble. Early map-making would make a valuable study: both the town lists and star lists of Ptolemy would serve as source materials here, as would the periploi, including the eight Black Sea fragments. New uses for the astronomical subdisciplines are evident. Dating problems were restudied in a sympo- sium in London, December, 1967, which also reviewed eclipse chronology (cf. papers by Berger, Edwards, Sachs, and Schove). Beer (1967) has ingeniously dated works of art by astronomical and astrological content. Translations, abstracts, and syntheses are urgently needed of valuable materials not easily available, and above all, of Arabic, South Asian, and Chinese early sources. Much of the work needed in ethnoastronomy is especially urgent in view of rapidly changing cultures: in particular, Laoust's (1921) extremely valuable study of Berber midsummer "fires of joy," important both for the rituals described and for the terms and names used (which are common to fire-ri- tual events from Iberia to the Indian subcontinent), indicates a field where earlier customs are vanishing rapidly. Seminars on archaeoastronomy are increasingly scheduled: such sessions might consider measures such as the formation of an interdisciplinary commit- tee which might devise more effective means of utilizing the various skills necessary in the subdisci- pline, create a clearinghouse for bibliographical facil- ities and the exchange of papers, and plan projects testing the theories and methods. I have elsewhere (Baity 1971 b) indicated the value of an international astra motif index, which requires a central clearing- house for microfilms. Pohorecky (1969) has initiated the study of rock-art motifs in Canada, and Jones (1969) describes a proposed method of transcribing rock art, but as yet no facilities exist for comparing the findings in one area with those elsewhere.26 Computer techniques along lines proposed by Gardin (1967) for iconography in general should facilitate the creation of a systematic classification. Astrophysics indicates that the concept of the uni- verse as orderly and peaceful is startlingly incorrect; if the interest of ancient men in the heavens and their preoccupation with astra-determined predic- tions seems excessive, we need not deduce thereby that they were less intelligent than ourselves-oral tradition may have given them cause for alarm (Nin- kovich and Heezen 1965). Since the International Geophysical Year, evidence has documented wide- spread tectonic disturbances, extensive vulcanism with resulting tidal waves and atmospheric disturbances, and major climate changes within the time-span of man's iconographic traditions (Lamb, Lewis, and Woodroffe 1966). Even if precession alone has operated, many changes in sky-patterns have oc- curred during the some 26,000 years that separated the Paleolithic period, when Taurus rose heliacally at the spring equinox, from the Bronze Age recur- rence of this astra event which so profoundly in- fluenced religion and iconography. To my thinking, astronomers could be of use to archaeologists in the preparation of charts showing the constellations which could have been associated by the astronomers of early cultures with significant astra events such as the solstices and the equinoxes. The chart of figure 5 is of significance with regard to early ritual cycles in Western Asia and Europe: the importance of Taurus and the Pleiades as indicators of the spring equinox (a New Year in many cultures) is clear, as is the absence at the summer solstice of such well- defined and conspicuous star-grouping. In this con- nection it must of course be remembered that ancient astronomers related their New Year's rituals to the solstices where these were more significant for agri- cultural rituals (Lockyer [ 1965] related Egyptian New Year rituals to the summer-solstice rising of the Nile). As the paranatellonta were also used as season indica- tors, our chart cannot be interpreted as indicating that megalithic astronomers had no good constellation target for midsummer sunrise. A midwinter chart would also be of interest in megalithic areas, in view 2"Elwin's (1951, 1955) studies of Middle Indian tribal art bear out Marshack's (1972a, b) argument that the Paleolithic-Mesolithic time-factored iconography was significant with regard to input, recall, recognition, and feedback, and that insight and reference to its function and mythic meaning may be obtained from the study of man's cognitive behavior in living situations. The Sorai wall art, the creation of which involves prayer, fasting, and libations, is addressed to the deities, serving to note rites duly performed, vows carried out, petitions made, and responses to dream instruc- tions. Elwin elicits the meaning of various of the icons: for instance, a solar icon, far from indicating "sun worship," is a reference to the fact that the all-seeing sun deity can bear witness to the truth of the assertion symbolically made. The lizard swallowing an orb is used as an eclipse symbol; plowing depicts seasonal activities, jars on shoulders a full harvest (petitioned hopefully); houses may be designed as deity houses, with the hope that the gods, whom the Sorai regard as the major source of their troubles, will settle there ("like flies") and leave them alone. I deduce similar purposes for the thousands of ritual scenes involving stellar-solar forms which occur along the Ibero-Saharan-Iranian-Indus con- tinuum, where fire, bull, and solstice rituals survive. Vol. 14 No. 4 October 1973 421</page><page sequence="34">of the emphasis which falls on the winter solstice in related folklore. Finally, it must not be forgotten that heliacal settings and other astra events too com- plex to describe here were also used by ancient astronomers. We are in need of an "archaeoastron- omer's handbook" designating the astra events which could have been significant in early astronomical cultures. Such a handbook would indicate the shifts necessary with regard to the reversal of seasons in the southern hemisphere, which must have further confused early voyagers whose planting seasons had been tied to the rising of Taurus, the Pleiades, or other 3d-millennium spring-equinox indicators. The speculative nature of much of the foregoing discussion needs stressing, but the studies reviewed provide hypotheses that might be tested: Did the Western European ritual cycle hinge on midsummer and midwinter rituals, as folkloric survivals and Thom's measurements suggest? Is a similar ritual pattern implied by the similar iconography in early Atlantic cultures from Ireland to Scandinavia (cf. MacWhite 1951, 1956), and did Iberian rituals travel with Bronze Age traders to Northwest Africa? Was the megalithic astra ritual pattern, yet to be deter- mined, prior to or based on a zodiac such as the well-developed zodiac which appears in Sumer? Or should we look farther east, to Iran or the Indus, for the zodiac's origin? Are these constructs older than Hinduism in the Indonesian archipelago? Do the constructs relate to the Bronze Age need for tin? To the possibility of high-value commodities in certain areas? Are they apparent in Oceania? Does Pacific navigational astronomy resemble that of the Old Persian, Chinese, or Arabic systems? If astronomy traveled as part of the Neolithic mixed-economy tool-kit and also accompanied far later Bronze Age trading expeditions, could the constructs survive in tropical areas, where winter never comes, and in the southern hemisphere, where seasons are reversed? If so, what modifications might we expect? To what extent do the differing plants, animals, deities, and agricultural systems change the constructs? How do religious systems incorporate the astronomical events? Some such questions as these must be devised as new findings and older studies are fitted into a meaningful pattern (Downs 1961; Graves 1948, 1957; Goodenough 1951, 1953; James 1961; Jobes and Jobes 1964; Kelley 1954, 1957; Lehmann-Nitsche 1922-27; Nilsson 1920; Stirling 1945; Taylor 1946). CONCLUSION The aim of this review has been not merely to present a list of studies in archaeoastronomy and ethnoas- tronomy, but to demonstrate if possible the role these studies may increasingly play in explicating certain problems in prehistory and protohistory. The meth- odology advocated has been that of comparing for different cultures the objective astronomical data, as presented by the heavens that wheeled impartially over ancient men, with the subjective and culturally conditioned mental and pictorial constructs ancient men built upon those data. We have seen that astron- omers can now compute the objective astra facts for any culture studied. Unfortunately, no "secular equivalent of divine revelation" can compute the matching subjective constructs where no texts exist, but in areas of ancient literacy, notably the Middle East and Mesoamerica, these are even now roughly known. Because of the vagaries of discovery and preservation (including losses from the record due to book-burning in Mesoamerica and Alexandria), our knowledge of these cultural constructs is uneven, but the literature reviewed indicates that we may hope soon to know more about Indus, Iranian, Arabic, and other early systems. Megalithic cultures remain mute and increasingly challenging, but even here further work in archaeoastronomy and ethnoastron- omy, allied with folkloric, linguistic, and other com- parative studies, may show correlations with known systems. The literature in both subdisciplines demon- strates-to my mind quite conclusively-that Eurasian megaliths and American sacred structures encode a remarkable astronomical knowledge which, more- over, was common over wide areas. Notably, the exact correspondences in orientations and metrol- ogy which Thom and colleagues have found between British and French megalithic structures leave little doubt of the presence of some central system, operat- ing at least in Britain and France and perhaps in the Iberian peninsula, Scandinavia, and Russia. Tra- dition suggests a central observatory in southeastern Iran, with possible connections as far as China and the Azores, giving an arc of observation of thousands of miles; it is perhaps not at all coincidental that a 3d-millennium B.C. literate center trading with both the East and the West (if only through traders meeting in ports of call) has been found in this area. Astron- omers and archaeologists are similarly discovering the outlines of wide correspondences in the Americas and in Oceania as well as in Eurasia and Africa. The unresolved questions which remain with regard to the time and place of origination of the ancient subjective constructs are susceptible to calculation on lines similar to those demonstrated by Ovenden. The parallels are too striking to be explainable by chance or psychology: a common conceptual scheme based on a common origin appears to be the only explana- tion which does not wrench the long arm of coinci- dence. Thus, as to the "why" of the diffusion of subjective astronomical constructs based on a long process of recording objective astronomical data (neither of which could always have fitted the observations which could have been made in the new environments), we can reasonably think in terms of man's acquisi- tiveness and his liking for adventure and intellectual achievement, united in a systematic explorative and commercial drive operating since at least the 3d millennium B.C., when the development of sailing ships began to open up the world to the adventurous. The most likely mechanism appears to be that of trade-colonists, mariners, anld caravan masters using navigational astronomy and cherishing celestial deities and as~tra-dIetermined renewal rituials iccomnanied 422 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="35">Baity: ARCHAEOASTRONOMY AND ETHNOASTRONOMY now and then by astrologers with their divining boards. Add to this an occasional storm-driven and current-directed unplanned landing on shores where alien stars looked down but enough familiar ones remained to permit a carry-over of familiar constructs, and both the parallels and the divergences in the ancient astronomical systems appear ultimately ex- plicable.

Paper read at the 38th International Congress of Americanists, Stuttgart-Miinchen. Comments by ANTHONY F. AVENI Hamilton, N.Y., U.S.A. 15 iII 73 As an astronomer with an interest in building orientations in Mesoamerica, I am hardly qualified to comment on all aspects of Baity's broad review ar- ticle. It would appear that her energy, enthusiasm, and organizational ability have produced the largest bibliog- raphy of its kind in an interdisciplinary field which, as she suggests, has devel- oped rapidly. Baity's definition and use of astro- nomical terms are often unclear. Her use of the term "astra" (as in "astra phenomena") is confusing. A more established term like "celestial" would include sun, moon, and planets as well as stars. Baity's continued reference to the fire bull ritual in discussing the zodiac leaves unequal time for the other members of that celestial. realm. Accordingly, the disucssion frequently is slanted in favor of her own research. Some of her statements are emphatic and undocumented and could invite more than a few dissenters (e.g., "The Maya codices have a heavy astronomi- cal content"). Her strong beliefs about transoceanic migration give the impression that archaeoastronomy should set out to prove what we already know. Finally, Baity ought to discrimi- nate more thoroughly between align- ments measured with the transit (e.g., Thom's work) and those determined on the basis of the examination of site maps. Unfortunately, a plethora of falsehood permeates the literature be- cause so many investigators have used erroneous site maps. I strongly endorse Baity's suggestion for a bibliographic clearinghouse to further an exchange of papers, though I find her concept of the well-rounded, broadly educated archaeoastronomer a bit unreal. Rather, I see real progress in this new interdiscipline resulting from cooperation among profes- sionals, each schooled in his own disci- pline. Since most of the existing pro- fessional societies are not broad enough to reach all who are interested, perhaps an organization such as the American Association for the Ad- vancement of Science could serve as a preliminary meeting ground. The fact that Baity has made some misin- terpretations by going far outside her field in producing the review only underlines the need for scholarly co- operation. Obviously, Baity has spent countless hours in many libraries producing the review, and in spite of its aforemen- tioned shortcomings her colleagues owe her a debt of gratitude for assem- bling the references, many of which have been long forgoten, and, ideally, for summoning together a new com- munitv of individuals. by RAINER BERGER Los Angeles, Calif., U.S.A. I iii 73 The article by Baity is a very extensive review of a subject which has needed to be treated for some time. In fact, there exists a considerable body of information in the area of ethnoas- tronomy today that in itself could be used for another major article. In several continents of the world today, rituals are still practiced or astronom- ical events noted which are of signifi- cance to the everyday life of the natives involved. In the interest of the best possible time placement, radiocarbon dates may be calibrated by a chart in Olsson (1970) based on various tree-ring mea- surements made in the La Jolla radio- carbon laboratory of the University of California under the direction of H. E. Suess. The tree-ring calibration ob- tained there by radiocarbon dating has been corroborated by a number of separate studies, one of which is based on the radiocarbon dating of histori- cally well-dated specimens from the Middle Ages and ancient Egypt (Berger 1970). There is obviously no question that prehistoric and protohistoric astro- nomical observatories were centers for ritual activity, yet we do not under- stand what the sequence of the evolu- tion of these facilities was and whether or not they grew out of a very impor- tant practical need that later acquired Vol. 14 No. 4 October 1973 431</page><page sequence="44">ritual overtones and dominance. Because of the size and antiquity of the larger megalithic facilities, they may serve as a check for plate tectonic studies. Careful studies of their orien- tation today and stellar alignments of the past might be correlated to yield such information. Last but not least, it would be good to know why the megalithic observa- tories fell into disfavor and what re- placed their astronomical function in later centuries. by DAVID A. BRETERNITZ Boulder, Colo., U.S.A. 20 iii 73 To those of us unfamiliar with the obviously extensive literature on ar- chaeoastronomy, Baity's compilation and documentation almost boggle the mind. As an instructor for an under- graduate survey course in Old World archaeology, I find the detailed analy- sis of the Stonehenge debate very in- formative. Beyond this, the amount of data available and the possibilities for astronomically meaningful investiga- tions are most thought-provoking. In dealing with the interdisciplinary, but somewhat esoteric, subject matter, I can only contribute a couple of bibli- ographic items to the already long list of astronomically motivated actions of past peoples: There is a reference to the possible astronomical alignment of Sun Temple, in Mesa Verde National Park, Colorado, by Robinson (1961). Awareness of astronomical phenome- na by the prehistoric Anasazi of the Southwest is noted by Miller (1955), who interprets certain rock-art panels as evidence of the observation of the supernova of the Crab Nebula, in A.D. 1054, an event also recorded by Chi- nese astronomers. by GEOFFREY A. CLARK Tempe, Ariz., U.S.A. 19 iii 73 Baity is to be commended for attempt- ing to review so vast a subject; however, I am left with the impression that she has bitten off more than she can chew. As a nonspecialist, I can offer only a few general comments; I will confine myself to the archaeological aspects of the paper. First, I was struck by the uncritical inclusion of references and commen- tary only peripherally allied to ar- chaeoastronomy (e.g., data from the American Southwest). Restriction of problem scope would have been in order; a preliminary consideration of important source material might have been preferable to the necessarily un- even 'scatter-gun" approach adopted. Second, many specific controversies outlined by Baity (e.g., Stonehenge) could have been resolved by a more rigorous application of scientific meth- od. Evidently the field suffers more than most from a plethora of compet- ing and alternative hypotheses. Once alternative hypotheses are statistically validated (i.e., once it is demonstrated that there is a low probability that the null hypothesis is true), they can suc- cessively be eliminated by the deriva- tion of consequences. If the conse- quences hold for some validated hy- potheses and not for others, given that the hypotheses are otherwise compa- rable on the criteria of parsimony and simplicity, then the spectrum of ac- ceptable hypotheses is correspondingly reduced. This approach characterizes some of Thom's best work. Third, while I acknowledge the pioneering role of Alexander Thom in paleometrological research, I con- tinue to assert that mathematically derived prehistoric units of measure- ment can be carried to pragmatically absurd levels of precision (e.g., Thom's MY = 2.720 + .003 ft.). It does not follow that "megalithic man" in fact employed such units. I suggest instead that he employed units, as we do, which only approximate some ideal standard (see my comment on Thom et al. in this issue). With regard to the promis- ing new field of quantum mathematics, it should be borne in mind that quanta will almost always be derived; moreover, they tend to "fit" the data set from which the original measure- ments were taken. But it is the mathe- matical process which imparts the pre- cision which Thom asserts charac- terizes ancient units of measurement (specifically, his megalithic yard). This precision is not demonstrably a feature of the units actually employed in an- tiquity. Fourth, the demonstration of the existence of prehistoric "observatories" does not lie, as Baity asserts, in the exactitude of Thom's measurements (which evidently have been vigorously contested). The case seems to rest on a mass of fairly convincing circum- stantial evidence which can, at any point, be contradicted in detail. Fifth, the attempt to extend astro- nomical implications to a wide variety of megalithic monuments throughout western Europe (and beyond) seems extremely ill-advised in a survey article of this sort. Baity's often highly specu- lative comments are based mainly upon superficial impressions taken out of context. Such structures are certainly polygenetic and multifunctional. It is highly unlikely, on the face of it, that all megalithic constructions necessarily had astronomical functions. Neverthe- less, I agree that the possibility should be investigated. Sixth, the New World data with which I am familiar imply none of the astronomical regularities suggested by Baity. Except for Mesoamerica, and perhaps Peru, only the most tenuous links are discernible between architec- ture and astronomical phenomena; numerous alternative and more plau- sible interpretations are possible. The New World sections of the article are replete with arguments based upon "facts in isolation" which don't sub- stantiate any systemic regularities (me- trological, astronomical, or otherwise). These assertions depend upon trait associations. Association is among the weakest forms of relationship, in that it is dependent upon qualitative "pres- ence/absence" data rather than upon more powerful quantitative measures of covariation. I had to remind myself constantly here that there is a big difference between the "possible" and the "probable." Many explanations are possible in the review presented, but no evaluation of probability (other than contestable assertions based upon appeals to "expert" opinion) is provid- ed. Seventh, the appeal to an outmoded and largely bankrupt diffusionist paradigm throughout much of the paper does much to discredit Baity's scrupulous research of the subject. To write of centers and widely shared cognitive "interpretations" of astro- nomical systems is extremely prema- ture. Finally, the assertion that patterns will emerge from data "when enough of it is assembled" is misleading. What constitutes patterning is determined ultimately by the paradigm under which the investigator is operating: change the paradigm, and you change the nature of the data and its conse- quent patterning. I mention this be- cause of the preceding point. The archaeoastronomy paradigm seems obsolete, yet its methodology is so- phisticated. Until the theoretical/ interpretative framework is over- hauled, the potential latent in the bat- tery of techniques for doing ar- chaeoastronomy cannot be fully real- ized. by JAMES W. Dow Rochester, Mich., U.S.A. 20 iii 73 Ethnoastronomy, with its techniques of discovering ancient belief through the analysis of symbols, still seems to be much less secure from the dark, un- mentionable beasts of ethnohistory- such as the theories of Atlantis (Don- nelly 1882), Mu (Churchward 1926), pyramidology (Smyth 1880), and gods from outer space (Von Daniken 1971, 432 CURRENT AN TH ROPO LOG Y</page><page sequence="45">Baity: ARCHAEOASTRONOMY AND ETHNOASTRONOMY 1972)-than archaeoastronomy, with its techniques of discovering proto- scientific knowledge through the anal- ysis of orientations and computing machines. Although scholars laugh in the face of these beasts, they may still be capable of discrediting legitimate ethnoastronomy if it does not verify its findings carefully. Ethnoastronomy is on the safest ground when it is based on textual records. It is least secure when it is based on the imaginative interpretation of religious symbols. How can we be sure that an admittedly religious symbol had an astronomical referent at any particular time in his- tory for a majority of persons in a culture? Symbols can persist in spite of changing meaning, and concerns with astral events can persist in spite of changing beliefs. So what particular astronomical belief or bit of knowledge can one reliably deduce from the pres- ence of a few symbols? Now that archaeoastronomy is begin- ning to develop, it would be helpful to have statistical analyses of the ran- dom occurrences of astronomical ori- entations in different natural and man-made situations so that re- searchers can determine if particular orientations have a low or high proba- bility of having been deliberately set. I should also like to note that a bad pre-Revolutionary reconstruction of the Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacain led everyone to believe that its adosada was originally built to face the setting sun on the day the sun passed through the zenith. Only very recently have excavations shown that the original adosada had the same orientation as the Pyramid itself. This discovery did not invalidate my main conclusions that the entire city of Teotihuacan was oriented to the setting of the Pleiades and the rising of Sirius (Dow 1967). The widespread concern with the Pleiades and other Tauran stars in semitropical zones in the northern hemisphere could be due to the fact that their heliacal risings coincide with the spring arrival of the tropical rain. by P.-R. GIOT Rennes, France. 20 ii 73 About Brittany I only want to improve the bibliography by reference to the earlier hints of Du Cleuziou (1882: 117-22; 1887: 486), Gaillard (1888, 1897), Grossin (1898), Kerviler (1904a, b), Devoir (1908, 1909), Martin (191 1), and the later elaborations of Merlet (1929, 1935); the influence of mega- lithic orientations on modern field structures has been advocated by Meynier (1943 a, b; 1944 a, b; 1945; 1958: 70-71). by DAVID H. KELLEY Calgary, Canada. 19 III 73 This study will be a very useful compendium for a long time to come. The one major problem I see is that Baity's enthusiasm allows her to accept the potential value of studies which are often contradictory in detail and may be contradictory in principle and that this will not necessarily be obvious to a reader not familiar with the mate- rial. Thus, Baity sees a Neolithic base for many astronomical ideas which I regard as coming together or originat- ing during the Hellenistic period. With respect to the statements which have been made about Mayan astronomy, Baity mentions work of Smiley on eclipses, astronomical descriptions by Owen, and studies by Schulz of the moon's movements and of eclipses. The fact that these scholars see dif- ferent significance in particular dates which they put at different points in real time is implicit in mentioning different correlations of the Mayan calendar with our own. Every astron- omer who has worked on the material has come up with a different answer and a different interpretation, and in no case do they agree with colonial and modern calendrical evidence. I have recently found inscriptional evi- dence suggesting interest in Jupiter- Saturn conjunctions, but a check of about 40 correlations showed that none of them put Jupiter-Saturn conjunc- tions at the indicated dates. Smiley, Hochleitner, Escalona Ramos (1940), and I have all developed correlations which identify the same dates as equinoxes and solstices, but Smiley's winter solstice is my spring equinox, Hochleitner's summer solstice, and Escalona's fall equinox. Without con- trol from the written texts, scholars are playing a simple game of numbers. When one sees how many brilliant scholars must be wrong on the inter- pretation of Mayan astronomical ma- terials simply because their solutions are incompatible, one becomes skepti- cal of alleged solutions of this sort. This is the most generic criticism which can be made of many of the studies cited by Baity. In most cases, we do not know what the builders of monuments thought they were doing, and struc- turally correct "interpretations" may sometimes derive from geometic or mathematical necessities. This seems to me also the central problem of Thom's work. He has demonstrated impressive regularities in the construc- tion of megalithic monuments which can be correlated with specified astro- nomical phenomena. If the regularities can only be explained by those partic- ular phenomena, then his conclusions must be accepted. Having seen how many ways astronomers can explain any set of figures given to them, I wonder if some ingenious fellow may not yet come up with an alternative explanation, although not one which would dismiss the regularities as meaningless. by LEO S. KLEJN Leningrad, U.S.S.R. 9 iII 73 As a review and summary of many scattered studies, Baity's paper is very useful, but the field of the proposed subdiscipline does not seem to be rea- sonably defined. Baity identifies the subject matter of archaeoastronomy as "the apparent use of astronomical techniques in the construction of me- galithic and other monumental struc- tures of ancient times." Why merely the "megalithic" and the "monumen- tal"? If we imagine an ancient observa- tory in every dolmen (even if in addi- tion to its tomb function), then not even modern astronomers could hope for so well developed a set of observa- tion points. But if we concentrate our attention only on the most complex structures, probably indeed especially designed for astronomical observa- tions and predictions, then the rich information on the use of astronomical knowledge in ancient times which may be obtained from the orientation of ordinary tombs will be lost (and in this respect I see no distinction between the dolmen and the catacomb or shaft grave). Further, since we usually in- clude studies of petroglyphs in archae- ology and not ethnography, why must we deal with ancient solar and lunar symbols in the frame of ethnoastron- omy and not archaeoastronomy? The supposed ties of Caucasian megaliths with Iberian ones are supported neither archaeologically nor by evidence from linguistics and folk- lore. The connections of Caucasian dolmens with the modern Caucasian cultures are very problematic, al- though possible. The connections of modern Caucasian languages with that of the Basques have never been dem- onstrated. The Caucasian dolmens are typologically much closer to the North European than to the Iberian ones. In general, Baity's impressive sum- mary emphasizes once more the ten- dency to reevaluate the intellectual power of early man and the antiquity of human characteristics. The first step in this direction was taken by Boucher de Perthes and the evolutionists when they discovered the immense antiquity of man, the second step by Breuil and Vol. 14 No. 4 October 1973</page><page sequence="46">his contemporaries when they recog- nized Palaeolithic cave art, Palaeolithic cultural diversity, and the relatively great effectiveness of Palaeolithic hunting. The third step is being taken now. It consists of the establishment of an age of the Anatolian or European Neolithic and an antiquity of man twice as great as earlier supposed and the discovery of unexpectedly great intel- lectual abilities in Upper Palaeolithic man. It seems that the intellectual abilities of early man and the antiquity of human characteristics grow along with the growth of our own modern civilization. Perhaps this means that our own abilities to see and understand humanity are growing. Anf if we are becoming better at seeing humanity in such remote beings, so we may also be growing to understand each other better in our own modern world, where we are divided inter alia into generations, races, peoples, states, and holders of beliefs. It is in this perspec- tive that the emergence of archaeoas- tronomy may be seen. by H. H. E. LOOFS Canberra, Australia. 20 iII 73 Not being an astronomer, but claiming to know something about this nebulous matter of what constitutes the "Mega- lithic," my main criticism of Baity's article is that, although the author clearly did a tremendous amount of research on the astronomical side, her homework on megalithic cultures and ideas in general leaves something to be desired. Proof of this may be found in the omission from an otherwise truly impressive bibliography of the many works dealing with this latter problem, ranging from Fergusson's Rude Stone Monuments in All Countries (1872) to the latest contributions by Heine-Gel- dern (1959, 1963), Varagnac (1959, 1961), Schmitz (1961), Closs (1966), and Jettmar (1971), to name but a few. Only Schuster's (1960) admittedly sig- nificant, but hardly all-encompassing, nine-page article is included. The reason I stress this point is that from this article it would appear that there is an inherent link between megaliths and astronomy, and this has in no way been proved. On the con- trary, scholars dealing with the tricky problem of the purpose of megaliths seem to be practically unanimous in concluding that it is mainly to enhance the prestige of living or dead persons, to serve as a link between the living and the dead, to commemorate wealth, to enable people to partake of the wisdom of their ancestors, to promote fertility, and the like, and make no mention of astronomy. (Incidentally, I wonder whether expressions like "astra facts," "astra events," "megalith- ic astra ritual pattern," etc., are neces- sarily a useful contribution to archae- ological terminology.) It must be con- cluded that any astronomical purposes are marginal, a mere by-product of megalithic culture. Indeed, one might legitimately ask whether such unique constructions as Stonehenge, some of the other stone circles in England, or alignements in Brittany, although in- deed made of big stones, really deserve to be labelled "megalithic" at all, since they are not typical of megalithic cul- tures elsewhere. That these "stone circles and their non-circular variants" are a highly localized phenomenon which thus cannot be taken as a para- digma of megalithic cultures in general was recently acknowledged by no less an authority than Atkinson (1968). As is unavoidable in such a wide- ranging survey, the author is obviously more familiar with some areas than with others. This becomes painfully clear when considering anything out- side the well-trodden cultural path leading from Western Europe to Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley, China, and Mesoamerica. For example, Southeast Asia, although full of mega- lithic cultures, living, dying, or dead (Loofs 1967, 1970), gets little mention, and what there is does not always seem to be based on adequate documen- tation. A question such as "are these constructs older than Hinduism in the Indonesian Archipelago?" is not really to the point, as Buddhist influence may have been just as old as, if not older than, that of Hinduism in the area. By plotting known megalithic cultures and instances of "archaeoastronomy" on a map, particularly in the case of Southeast Asia, the author would have easily discovered that the little overlap- ping that there is of the two does not warrant the assumption that they must inherently be connected. Insufficient attention is also some- times given to chronological consider- ations, in particular as far as alleged transmissions of archaeoastronomical concepts are concerned. It is difficult to understand, for instance, how such a transmission from the 2d millennium B.C. Indus Valley to the 1st millennium A.D. Mesoamerica can be postulated without somehow analyzing it further in time and space (through Southeast Asia?). Chinese, Tibetan, and Burmese "models" are treated as if they were contemporaneous; there may well be 1,000 years' difference between them. The same attitude is also shown in the use of such nonsensical (especially in the context of a worldwide survey!) terms as "megalithic man," "Megalithic Age," etc. Are we back to Perry's Chil- dren of the Sun (1923)? I nevertheless consider this article to be a very worthwhile attempt to come to grips with an archaeologically intriguing, complex, and somehow elusive subject, in which an admirable amount of scholarly research has been invested to some effect. By collating and reviewing work done in this field so far, the author has fulfilled the aim she set for herself and deserves high praise; it is not really she who is to blame if the picture she presents is still somewhat blurred. by ROLF MULLER Nussdorf/Inn, Germany. 9 iI 73 The megalithic monument in the ruins of Tihuanaco (the Sun Temple Kala- sasaya) was measured in 1932 by Pos- nansky and myself. The most signifi- cant result was that the equinox of the people of Tihuanaco was not the as- tronomical equinox, but a point that divided the year into two equal parts (with a declination of the sun of +0.5?, exactly the same value Thom found for megalithic man in Britain; see Muller 1972). Singeorzan (1970) has discussed the orientation of 320 skeletons from the Neolithic Boian Culture (ca. 4000- 3500 B.C.) excavated near Bucharest, Rumania, 300 of which were oriented to the rising sun. In this epoch, man had a clear and distinct concept of the yearly motion of the sun. The bodies were buried with the face toward the rising sun. More than half (164) faced directly east, the position of the sun at the equinoxes. by RICHARD PITTIONI Vienna, Austria. 5 iII 73 I can restrict my comments to the statement that the author has very clearly and lucidly presented the re- sults of research done up to the present time. It becomes clear in particular that, as early as the Neolithic, knowl- edge of natural processes must have been substantially more extensive than has generally been assumed. It is much to the author's credit to have made this even more evident by drawing on pertinent material from the fields of ethnology and folklore. As a supplementary remark in the field of ethnoastronomy, I might men- tion the often ascertainable time-indi- cative names of mountains (e.g., Mit- tagskogel 'noon-peak'), which originat- ed in the relation of these mountains to specific positions of the sun (cf. Wilivonseder 1928). 434 C U R RENT AN TH ROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="47">Baity: ARCHAEOASTRONOMY AND ETHNOASTRONOMY by EMILIE PLESLOVA-STIKOVA Prague, Czechoslovakia. 23 II 73 This new subdiscipline is very useful for understanding the past of humani- ty. Though the present results are still partly hypothetical, there is much evi- dence to be considered which has not yet been subjected to astronomical study. This is the case, as Baity notes, in Central Europe. Here some steps in this field were taken some time ago by Muller (1936a, b), whose recent book I have had no chance to read. Therefore, and being a layman in the field of archaeoastronomy, I can only suggest two promising Neolithic and Aeneolithic structures in Czechoslova- kia, not yet fully excavated, which ought to be carefully examined in this light. The first is a settlement of the oldest phase of the Moravian painted- ware culture (Tesetice-Kyjovice, Znoj- mo district, Moravia), where there is a circular, monumentally enclosed area 50-55 m in diameter, probably of some cult character, with two known en- trances orientated to the north-south (Podborsky 1972). The second is a settlement of the older phase of the Funnel Beaker culture (Makotrasy, Kladno district, Bohemia) with a rec- tangularly enclosed area (two corners known) 300 m by at least 280 m, with diagonals to the southwest-northeast (?), southeast-northwest(?) (Linington 1969, Pleslova-Stikova 1972). In this connection I would mention Neolithic Kothingeichendorf in Bavaria (Maier 1962), with a structure similar (in shape, diameter, entrances) to that of Te'setice-Kyjovice, and the complicat- ed enclosed structure at Altheim (Altheim group) in Bavaria (Maier 1962). Good results on archaeoastron- omy have been published for the much younger (Celtic period) sanctuary of Libenice in Bohemia (Holub 1962). by ZENON S. POHORECKY Saskatoon, Canada. 26 III 73 I would agree with Baity that men have always attached great importance to events observed in the sky. I would go even further than she to say that the sun and the moon were seen not only as the calendrical cues noted by calculating astronomers, but also as the aesthetic, spiritual, and even naviga- tional phenomena which have fascin- ated star-gazers for millennia. The sun and the moon, especially, have been viewed as sources of many powers embodied in almost everything on earth, because men have always been more interested in meaning than in measurement; this seems a proper priority, although Baity tends to ne- glect it. Objects we see as inanimate are seen by many peoples as having souls related to all other souls in this world. For instance, there are many aborig- inal paintings on more or less smooth, vertical rock faces along innumerable lakes and streams in the forested Pre- cambrian Shield of Canada in which sunlight plays a vital role in casting a magic spell. On bright, calm days, the sun's dazzling beams are reflected by slightly rippling waters in repetitive, shimmering patterns on the rock walls. Glittering lights appear to be released like dancing spirits from the stone, and it is easy to understand what is meant by some old people who still say that even rocks can harbour spirits with the power to harm or heal. The spectacle of the paintings in their natural settings may be further enhanced by some vague awareness of their mystic mean- ings. There is no doubt that many of the painted symbols represent dream- like or visionary experiences of the painter. Yet the paintings, which lack any representations of sun or moon or stars, defy exact comparison with any other religious art in the world, representing such fantastic creatures as horned serpents and thunderbirds (prominent deities in Indian tales and origin myths). The floor plan of the so-called sun dance ceremony in central Saskatch- ewan is naturally oriented according to the cardinal directions. All ritual activities and movements, including dancing, must be done in a clockwise direction, that is, following the path of the sun. However, there is no calen- drical significance here. One of the most spectacular rock- carvings in southern Saskatchewan occurs at St. Victor, on the edge of a high cliff that was used as a buffalo jump. Buffalo and bear tracks are imprinted on the limestone rim, but can be seen only at sunrise and at sunset; the sun bleaches them out dur- ing the rest of the day. The religious significance of these vanishing petro- glyphs is linked to sympathetic magic used to hunt animals, of course, but the mystery is enriched by the symbols' becoming invisible in broad daylight and at night. The Plains Cree in Saskatchewan once had a gigantic 100-ton rock, called Mistaseni, which looked like a huge reclining bufalo at sunset and at sunrise. During the day it looked like a common haystack. Its daily transfor- mations into a buffalo made it a shrine. The sun had somehow revealed the spirit. Still, dam engineers had it blasted in 1966, since its inevitable flooding threatened to transform it into a ripple rock endangering canoe traffic. Baity's thesis envisages ancient ar- chitects plotting the movements of the sun and the moon on their flat draw- ing-boards, not only at Wiltshire's Stonehenge, but also wherever a pyra- mid was built or a pot painted with respect to an observed circling of heavenly bodies. It focuses on how man has used the constant rate of motion evident in the sun and the moon to measure time, so that clocks and calen- dars emerge as man-made constructs reflecting celestial cycles. My view is that people have generally relied far more on earthier cues like birds mi- grating or rivers freezing than on the position of the sun to guess when another season was beginning. I am tempted to quip that the invention of the clock never revolutionized rabbit hunting. Baity's theory may not apply so much to ordinary people, who are most concerned with just surviving. Hungry people find little time to gaze at the sky in order to reckon time. I would accept her thesis as true for the better-fed part of mankind, who may have nothing better to do with time than measure it. by JONATHAN E. REYMAN Normal, Ill., U.S.A. 9 iii 73 Baity's article is an important contri- bution and adds another dimension to the anthropological study of both pre- historic and ethnographic populations. In addition, it represents a fair and thorough synthesis of much of the existing literature and current argu- ments; her bibliography will remain a basic reference source in archaeoas- tronomy for years to come. Her use of the term "archaeoastronomy" in- stead of "astro-archaeology" is also welcome from the standpoint of ety- mology: we are studying ancient astro- nomical practices, not doing celestial archaeology. It is difficult not to take issue with some of the arguments of others which Baity cites. In certain cases I feel that she should have included critical com- ments (e.g., Cowan's [1970] state- ments regarding the "rudimentary" trigonometry of the megalithic geom- eters); perhaps these can be included if this article is expanded into a book. There are a number of points on which I would like to comment. Much of what I have to say can best be considered as an addendum to rather than a criticism of her paper. Baity states that "the high degree of organization and administration responsible for the impressive Breton Vol. 14 No. 4 October 1973 435</page><page sequence="48">alignments and the presence in Brit- tany and Scotland of identical units [of measure] suggests a common cul- ture." There is no doubt that contacts and/or cooperative efforts existed be- tween peoples in the two areas, but that these geographically and tem- porally separated groups possessed a common culture does not seem likely. They occupied very different ecologi- cal niches and presumably used astro- nomical observations for different purposes, e.g., navigation in south Ar- gyllshire (Thom 1971:10-11) and ag- riculture in Brittany. The sites may incorporate the same unit of measure, but some structures are lunar in orien- tation (Temple Wood), some are pri- marily solstitial (Kintraw), and others include both types of orientations (Stonehenge, the Crucuno rectangle). What evidence exists, aside from the astronomical data, to indicate a com- mon culture? Can we reasonably infer this from the settlement patterns? re- source exploitation and trade? artifact assemblages and their distributions in time and space? Baity accurately describes the pur- pose for which many and perhaps most of the current archaeostronomi- cal studies are being conducted, i.e., data collection. If there is one criticism to be made of these recent projects, it is that they are data- and not prob- lem-oriented. An enormous amount of information has been gathered con- cerning the astronomical alignments of numerous buildings and how these alignments could have been used from a technical (observer's) standpoint; however, there is a dearth of hypothe- ses dealing with why there was this intense interest in the sky and what these astronomical data may mean in terms of cultural-ecological adapta- tions. Baity is not to be faulted for this, and, indeed, she does state that new hypotheses are needed, listing several possibilities. However, she does not provide a definite method for hypothesis formulation and testing within archaeoastronomical studies. This shortcoming, in part, may reflect her acceptance of MacKie's (1969:11) position that because we are not as- tronomers we do not know how or where to look for evidence of prehis- toric astronomical practices. This posi- tion disregards the vital role which ethnographic materials play in the for- mation, testing, and evaluation of hy- potheses, whether they are related to archaeoastronomical studies or to some other archaeological problem. On several occasions Baity uses sec- ondary sources and/or takes quotes out of context. For example, it was Ricketson (1928; see also Ricketson and Ricketson 1937) and not Morley who first described the astronomical alignments at Group E, Uaxactun. As for the Wadi Halfa burials, Saxe does regard the skull orientations as indica- tive of patterned behavior but adds "we find it dfficult to decide the basis of this patterning at this point" (1971:49). With regard to my work at Anasazi sites, the astronomical align- ments are not quite as well-document- ed as Baity suggests, although the loose ends should be tied up in the near future. More important, however, is that the astronomical ceremonialism is not "caught red-handed," but enters, in conjunction with improved varieties of maize and other crops, as an integral part of the planned and systematic exploi- tation of the Southwest by Mexican pochte- ca, particularly in the Anasazi and Hohokam regions. These astronomical practices became the basis for adapta- tion of the various cultigens to the ecologically marginal agricultural con- ditions which existed throughout much of the Southwestern Plateau. The use of astronomical observations in connection with the agricultural cycle is frequently discussed in the ethnographic and archaeological liter- ature relating to the Southwestern Pueblos (e.g., Bunzel 1932, Benedict 1935, Stephen 1936, Parsons 1939, Lange 1959, Dutton 1963, Kelley 1966, Ellis and Hammack 1968, and Lange and Riley 1970:69-70). One further technical point is that my photographs of the corner of a pueblo splitting the rising sun and the shadow time-keep- ing sequence were all taken at the autumnal equinox, not the summer solstice. Baity's mention of the controversy concerning the beginning of the Maya year is interesting, especially since she draws on important but unpublished discussions. It seems to me that Kelley has the stronger argument (vernal equinox = Zero Day, rather than June 23, 3392 B.c.) both on archaeological grounds and because the sun's position is (relatively) constant through time, whereas the positions of Procyon, the Pleiades, and Antares change with comparative rapidity. Baity's use of the term "reconstruc- tion" with regard to lifeways and even buildings is conceptually unacceptable. Taylor (1948:35) and Goldstein (1962:177), among others, have noted that while the facts per se may be verifiable, what actually happened in the past is not. Therefore, when we discuss the past, that which we describe is our construction and not a reconstruc- tion; one cannot reconstruct what is not actually known in the first place. This does not mean that all contexts or historical schemes are equally useful and valid; some do seem to be better explanations of the data. However, all such schemes are "artificial" constructs and are not verifiable on the basis of the unknowable. Perhaps nothing il- lustrates this point better than the several recent "reconstructions" of the Adosada at Teotihuacain. Finally, I would like to make three technical points: (1) With regard to ancient Egyptian astronomical prac- tices,I note the curious omission of classic references such as Breasted (1905). (2) The long-held assumption that the Egyptian pyramids were con- structed in accordance with a celestial referent has been challenged and an alternative hypothesis proposed which states that their present alignment may be due to continental drift (Pawley and Abrahamsen 1973). (3) Baity's conten- tion that Upper Paleolithic iconog- raphy was created by "advanced Homo sapiens" is untenable on genetic grounds; rather, we are only beginning to understand the degree of intellec- tual development and sophistication possessed by prehistoric peoples and nontechnologically advanced societies. So-called primitive thought is no less developed than ours, but it is expressed in a very different symbolic system, one based on manifest or concrete properties instead of abstract entities (Levi-Strauss 1966). The breadth and depth of Baity's study are impressive: she has written the definitive synthesis of archaeoas- tronomy and ethnoastronomy to date. Baity has provided both the data for problem-oriented research and the impetus to conduct such studies. She is to be commended. by S. B. Roy New Delhi, India. 3 iv 73 In her well-documented article, Baity has given a comprehensive account of recent work (1950-72) on archaeoas- tronomy and ethnoastronomy. As this article is likely to be a basic source because of its comprehensive coverage, she might also have given a brief digest of the earlier work on these subjects. The great Indologist Sir William Jones (1790) suggested that the precession of the equinoxes could be used to define the chronology of Indo- European prehistory reflected in the Vedic works. Wilson (1861) did the pioneering work of identifying the nakshatras-the 27 bright stars used to define the positions of the moon in the celestial circle in which the moon moves during the month. Jacobi (1893) showed that the traditions of year- beginnings contained in the Rig-Veda go back to ca. 4400 B.C. Independently, Tilak (1894) reached the same conclu- 436 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="49">Baity: ARCHAEOASTRONOMY AND ETHNOASTRONOMY sion. Buhler (1893) supported these pioneering attempts. The source book for these scholars was the Vedic texts. Of them, the Rig-Veda is of unique value for ethnol- ogists. It is a collection of hymns (sacerdotal, mystical, and astronom- ical), a complete index of which was made ca. 1300 B.C. by the scholiasts Shaunaka and Katyayana. Since then, it has been preserved intact by a com- plex scheme of variant recitations that permits not even half a syllable to be changed. It is, therefore, an indis- pensable source of perfectly main- tained traditions (traditions already of hoary antiquity in 1300 B.C.!) for the student of Indo-European prehistory. For example, in Vedic astronomy, a bright star was used to mark the equinox: X Orionis (long. 84?), called Mrga-s'iras, literally "stag's head." The full moon at the "stag's head" marked the autumnal equinox in ca. 4100 B.C. What is of crucial importance in apply- ing astronomical methods to the chro- nology of periods prior to 6000 B.C., however, is to keep in mind the quarter-phase shift every 6,500 years. For instance, the full moon at this star marked the summer solstice in 10,600 B.C., the spring equinox in 17,100 B.C., the winter solstice in 23,600 B.C., and the autumnal equinox in 30,100 B.C. Similarly, if the observation is of the new moon (or the heliacal rising of a bright star, which is the same thing), there is a half-phase shift. For instance, the heliacal rising of the star a Arietis, which represented the god-hero Ashva-Yujau, marked the spring equinox in 500 B.C., the winter solstice in 7,000 B.C., the autumnal equinox in 13,500 B.C., the summer solstice in 20,000 B.C., and the spring equinox in 26,500 B.C. Imagination should not be allowed to boggle while considering these vast distances in time, but the worker should carefully analyze the phenome- non observed, the event to which it is related, the geographical locale, and, above all, the culture to which it is related before drawing any chronological in- ference. Primitive man of the Pleistocene used the moon, not the sun, as a time-measurer. Marshack (1964-72) has shown that the Aurignacian peo- ples knew that the moon completes two full cycles in 59 days (in sets of 30+29 or, more probably, 15, 15, 14, 15). The ancient (pre-Vedic) Indo-Europeans also used a season of two months and called it rtu. The English word "moon" is related to the measurement of time through menstruation, both being derived, according to the Oxford En- glish Dictionlary, from the root me 'to measure' (cf. the Vedic root md). Even in the early Pleistocene, the female must have noticed the correspondence between the full moon and her own monthly period of menstruation. The ramifications of the Vedic root rt will be clear from the following: rtu 'sea- son,' 'menstruation'; rtam 'grand cos- mic law,' 'truth,' 'right'; rtvij 'priest' (who knows the seasons and performs the rituals accordingly). (Cf. the En- glish right, rhythm, ritual.) It is also apparent that the first astronomer-cum-calendar-maker was female: perhaps it was she who was deified as a mother goddess, for not only was she the procreatrix par excel- lence, but also she controlled the future because she knew the mystery of time. According to the Rig-Veda, she was Aditi, the mother of 12 luminous beings called adityas (stars marking months). Aditi declared Punarvasu (Pollux) to be the autumn star; she is, therefore, its presiding deity. Baity has laid too much emphasis on the solar calendar; the importance of moon astronomy has not been suffi- ciently stressed. The first observations of Pleistocene man must have been crude and therefore simple. He (or, rather, she, as I have suggested) ob- served only the points at which the moon was full when a season was beginning. The primary rituals were the purnamasa, or full-month, rituals. Autumn was the first season, and the autumnal equinox was marked by the "autumn star." "A hundred autumns" meant 100 years. The calendar was, therefore, simple enough for Pleisto- cene man to follow. The Indo-Europeans also used a simple calendar based on the stepwise motion of the full moon in the nakshatra circle. Rigvedic lore prescribes elabo- rate full-moon and new-moon rituals to be observed at particular nakshatras. The observation of the bright star at which the full moon (or the new moon) occurs was a hallmark of Vedic (and pre-Vedic) calendar-making. For in- stance, when Punarvasu was declared to be the autumn star, the autumn rituals were observed when (and only when) the moon was full at Punarvasu. Being star-bound, the system is ad- mirably suited to chronological computations. It is hardly necessary to point out that when the moon is full at, say, Rohini (Aldebaran; long. 69?), the sun will be at long. 249? (i.e., 69? + 180?); the "opposite" star (at long. 2490) was called Jyeshtha Rohini, "elder Rohin'," showing that the Vedic astronomers had a clear notion of the celestial circle even ca. 3100 B.C. (when the autumnal equinox took place at the Rohini full moon). Incidentally, the linking of the full moon with the star at which it occurs automatically calls for the inclusion of an extra full moon in the third year (observational intercalation!). Thus, 37 full moons were needed to complete a cycle of about three years called yuga, and a year was made up of 370 "moon- days" (called tithis). An extra month was needed after 30 years for finer correction. Viswamitra I, a brilliant astronomer-poet of the Rig-Veda, ob- served that a similar result was achieved by a secondary intercalation after the ninth year. The method was so accurate that he determined that a period of nine years contained 3,339 moon-days (see the Rig-Veda hymn 3.9.9). This means that a Viswamitra year was made up of 371 tithis, equiv- alent to a period of 365.20 days. Vis- wamitra lived ca. 2600 B.C., and there- fore his determination was an achieve- ment of the very first magnitude by any standard. All this was achieved by naked-eye observation of the moon with no clock other than the clock of the seasons and the menses. Therefore, the importance of moon astronomy should not be minimised, particularly for the periods prior to 2000 B.C. (Roy 1972). To sum up: 1. Baity has made a good case for intensive study of astronomy by the ethnologist and the archaeologist. There is a grand cosmic clock in the heavens whose invisible hands turn once every 26,000 years. Those who can read it can read the past with unerring accuracy, for the sun and the moon will bear witness to what they say. 2. The astronomical legends of the Rig-Veda, containing the prehistoric traditions of the Indo-Europeans, would be a fruitful source of explora- tion for ethnoastronomers. 3. More attention should be given to the simple, crude moon observations of the pre-Vedic Indo-Europeans than to the more accurate (and, there- fore, more sophisticated) observations needed for a solar calendar. 4. It would be necessary to go beyond the first quarter-phase of the precession cycle of 26,000 years in studying astronomically the astro- religious symbolism of the Magdalen- ian (14,000-8,000 B.C.), the Solutrean (18,000-14,000 B.C.), the upper Peri- gordian (23,000-18,000 B.C.), and the Aurignacian (28,000-23,000 B.C.). 5. A compi-ehensive but simple text on moon astronomy is a desideratum for the archaeologist.

SMILEY Providence, R. I., U.S.A. 18 III 73 Baity's report makes a valuable contri- bution in fields crossing two or more disciplines. Many of the persons work- ing in these fields are experts in only one or two disciplines and cannot nec- essarily be trusted in other areas. Nor can these experts hope to keep in- formed in all areas. Baity has served well in summarizing and evaluating burgeoning publications in fields as far apart as astronomy, archaeology, lin- guistics, and engineering. Her splen- did list of more than 600 references will allow scholars to fill in gaps in their backgrounds and avoid duplicat- ing work already completed by others. by DEAN R. SNOW Albany, N.Y., U.S.A. 17 III 73 What I hoped for, but did not find, in Baity's article was a clear statement of methodology. As a science, archae- ology suffers because its subject matter is made up of fragmentary traces of often unique and unrepeatable human activity. Hypotheses proliferate, but adequate proofs do not, much less an accepted measure of adequacy. In this regard, I think that archaeoastronomy is particularly vulnerable. That some specified site had a specific set of astronomical functions prehistorically must be shown to be probable through the use of explicit techniques and methods, and that is no easy task. A consensus of archaeologists is not enough. In its conclusion, the article advo- cates a methodology of comparing ob- jective astronomical data to prehistoric constructs, but this is strategy, not methodology. Baity comes closer to the latter when discussing Thom's predic- tion and subsequent discovery of eight stations around Er Grah and his similar prediction and discovery of a stone platform at Kintraw. The essential dif- ference between investigators like Thom and the likes of Erich Von Daniken is not truthfulness as opposed to falsehood, but scientific rigor as opposed to the lack of it. Indeed, without the concerted development of rigorous methods in the near future, this new subdiscipline may be lost in a maelstrom of haphazard specula- tions. To judge from the popular press, it looks as though we might already be moving into another round of Egyptian pyramid numbers magic. There are at least a few errors of fact in this overwhelming compilation, but I hope that its reviewers will avoid caviling over relatively trivial points. The real importance of Baity's contri- bution will probably be that it marks an end to the specimen-collecting stage in the development of the subdisci- pline. We can now hope for some discussion of proper classification. It makes little sense to discuss Stone- henge, South African rock art, Su- merian astrology, the orientations of burials, Medieval symbolism, Mayan calendrics, and the Plains Indian Sun Dance as if they were comparable phenomena. We can look forward to the development of classification, ex- plicit theory and method, and syn- theses of several different kinds. Unless this new subdiscipline advances quickly and carefully, there is a good chance that volumes of nonsense will accumu- late in our libraries, burying and dis- crediting valid findings. by JAMES L. SWAUGER Pittsburgh, Pa., U.S.A. 16 III 73 Interested in the general subject of this article because of my work with dol- mens and other megalithic structures in Palestine and with petroglyphs in the northeastern United States, I asked permission to comment in order that I would become familiar with current theory and studies. Confronted by Baity's Niagara of information and citation, I became aware of my igno- rance and was abashed. It will take me some months of hard reading of cited sources to begin to comprehend enough of the information in Baity's article to make meaningful appraisals of data and deductions, but I'm most grateful for such a comprehensive guide. There are, however, attitudes im- plied in archaeo- and ethnoastronomy of whose validity I will have to be convinced. For instance, there is as- sumption of necessity for sophisticated astronomical and mathematical knowl- edge in the arrangement of sighting structures such as menhirs. From my own experience I know that sighting along a menhir's top line to another such structure to fix a point on a horizon presents the viewer with enough of an arc of observation, depending on the angle of his vision, to permit another to say the observer is fixing almost any point on a consid- erable stretch of the horizon. Trained as a surveyor, I know how difficult it is and how much knowledge is re- quired to fix two points in order to establish a line of sight, but the lines of sight used by the ancients in many cited instances were not point to point but gross structure to gross structure, and I see no reason why they could not have been established empirically by use of good sense and reasonable care after repeated observation. The same sort of thought applies to the assumed high level of ancient astronomical knowledge necessary for travel over the deserts and the seas. Until the relatively late domestication of camels, caravans did not travel sand deserts of any size, but rather stony deserts, with their distinctive land- marks. Again, from personal experi- ence, I know that one traversing such deserts sets a general course by the stars by night and by which cheek the sun falls on by day, but the course is general and designed to establish a heading to bring one to a sighting of a distinc- tive "landfall," just as on the sea one steers largely by landfalls to whose proximity one is brought by use of a sextant but could have been brought by grosser astronomical observation. That the ancients had to have more precise astronomical knowledge than a modern desert traveler or sailor, I doubt. Again, I think empirical knowl- edge largely sufficient. by P. M. VERMEERSCH Leuven, Belgium. 21 III 73 The attempt of the author to gather the scattered data of this new discipline can only be acclaimed. This review article opens new perspectives to those scholars who are not directly involved in this research. Such research can undoubtedly throw new light on the spiritual world of prehistoric societies. It seems to me that traditional archae- ology pays too little attention to such problems, probably because of hesita- tion as to the interpretation of obser- vational data. Moreover, it happens that the fancy of some scholars proves the sceptics to be right. Nevertheless, one should not be blind to certain facts requiring interpretation. Still, I don't feel secure about the idea that the wide distribution of some astronomical constructs is the result of diffusion by trade-colonists, mariners, and caravan masters. It seems to me that some customs and inventions may arise independently in different re- gions. As an example I should point out the appearance of microlithic tech- niques at the end of the Upper Palaeo- lithic not only in Europe but also in the Near East and Africa. There are no sound indications that the world- wide appearance of these new tech- nological habits was supported by trade-colonists. We must recognise that in the present state of research there is not yet a valid explanation of this phenomenon. To me it seems accept- 438 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="51">Baity: ARCHAEOASTRONOMY AND ETHNOASTRONOMY able that some innovations, pehaps some "subjective astronomical con- structs" may appear independently over a large area. Why is another question. Reply by ELIZABETH CHESLEY BAITY Chapel Hill, N.C., U.S.A. 13 iv 73 The comments and references offered by the commentators add greatly to the potential usefulness of this pio- neering essay. Loofs' bibliographical data on megalithic studies and Giot's specialized list will be helpful to all who have fallen behind on their megalithic homework through difficulties in lo- cating pertinent studies. The absence of references to astronomical orienta- tions noted by Loofs does not to me prove a lack of astronomical interests on the part of megalithic draftsmen, but instead suggests the probability that, faced with the necessity of mea- suring time in order to allay anxieties or to schedule essential renewal rituals in a world lacking clocks, television, and printed calendars, they were more acute observers of the heavenly clock- work than megalithic sholars have been. How many of these scholars can determine the times of solar and lunar solstices and equinoxes and predict eclipses? There remains little doubt that megalithic astronomers of Britain and Brittany could do so, by methods so remarkably similar that, despite Reyman's reservations, at least a com- mon astronomical subculture must be attributed to them. Recent work strengthens this case, as Thom (per- sonal communication, 17 III 73) has been kind enough to confirm: There is such similarity between megalithic remains in Britain and Brittany that there is little doubt that they belong to the same culture. . . We find an identical value for the megalithic yard in Orkney and Brittany. We find megalithic eggs in Brittany laid out with the same terms of reference as those in Britain. At Kerlescan we find the remains of a huge cromlech, set out in circular arcs, centered on the corners of a right-angled triangle reminiscent of the ring at Avebury but with smaller stones and no ditch. We also find extrapolating sectors for the huge lunar observatory in Morbi- han, reminiscent of those in Caithness. Need one look further? MacKie (personal communication, 28 iII 73), while pointing out that the techniques outlined by Thom were the only ones that could have been prac- ticed effectively to get accurate results with Neolithic technology, shares Thom's view as to a cultural relation- ship between Brittany and Britain. He cites early Neolithic chambered tombs scattered along Europe's western sea- board and the late Bronze Age square- sectioned socketed axes made in France but also appearing in England. Keeping in mind the priority of Breton tombs and the possibility that an elite was familiar with both areas whatever the economic and cultural differences in the peasantry, we may also consider recent evidence from Ireland. In a talk reported in the Cleveland Press (March 29, 1973), Ruaidhri de Valera said, "We are developing a detailed picture of the people who came from north- west France to the northwest coast of Ireland about the year 3000 B.C."; he reports the unearthing of prehistoric tombs, larger burial grounds, and houses in Counties Mayo and Sligo. Klejn emphasizes the importance of the orientation of ordinary tombs (as I did above), which accords with the evidence from Muller and Pleslova'-Sti- kova'. To me, if not to Reyman, the range of burial orientations cited by Saxe and others does imply a very early ability to determine the positions of the rising sun at solstices and equi- noxes. With regard to the Basque-Cau- casian parallelisms, Klejn and I may be familiar with different bodies of scholarship that should be collated. The linguistic parallelisms of Fita, Schuchardt, Trombetti, Dumezil, Bouda, and Lafon are summed up by Tovar (1954:25-27), as is the hypothe- sis of Menghin that in the 3d millenni- um proto-Caucasian speakers may have come to the West. The enormous body of Western scholarship with re- gard to linguistic and folkloric parallels suggests the usefulness of a similar comparison with regard to the orienta- tion of the megaliths; in the West there is considerable evidence that Basques may have had megalithic peoples among their ancestors. Evidence for common ritual practices in these two areas comes from rock-carvings in So- viet Armenia studied by Tumanian and Petrosian (1970), Martirossian and Israelian (1971), and Petrosian (1971) and reviewed by Petri (for whose notes I am originally endebted to R. L. Mer- ritt, and who has himself sent me his summary of the latter book and a further reference to Okladnikov [1972]). Petri's summary confirms my original impression that the "sparkling goat" and "goat with stellar symbols" discussed by Martirossian and Israelian indicate rituals similar to those of the Iberian and Indian cattle-keepers which I have suggested (Baity 1968) may have also been practiced in the Black Sea region. The Soviet authors place this art in the 5th-3d millennia and trace the motifs in painted pottery, as I do, and we agree that the horned animals with astra symbols possibly represented both deities and constella- tions. Without seeing the full text, it is impossible to determine if the Soviet researchers also find evidence of cult rituals in which animals wearing horn- torches may have impersonated a ce- lestial event, such as heliacal rise-set or other phenomena at solstice or equinox which marked the New Year. To the hypothesis of these workers that the "sparkling goat" represented a lightning deity, I offer the suggestion that a horn-torch ritual may also have been involved, the deity construct orig- inating perhaps in Ice Age observa- tions of electrical displays on animal horns during storms (the "St. Elmo's fire" effect) and among some Bronze Age cultures represented by Taurus wearing the torch of the Pleiades. If my hypothesis is plausible, the winter- solstice New Year best fits Thom's megalithic calendar. Many archaeoastronomical studies have been made since 1968, and At- kinson (cited by Loofs) would not today refer to stone rings as "an almost exclusively British phenomenon." Des- pite the zeal of Charlemagne and later Christians, who systematically de- stroyed the rings as the prime sites of satanic revels, many somehow escaped destruction (perhaps because they were still in use; cf. Borst 1969). Pleslova'-Stikova' gives valuable docu- mentation as to circular structures in Central Europe, certainly not suffi- ciently studied. Gordon (1960:pl. XXXII) publishes a prehistoric Indian stone circle. Until measurements are made, we cannot assert an astronom- ical function for all of these rings, some of which may be imitative. A flat hori- zon anywhere could have suggested a circular model for the observing of rise-set phenomena (though the re- markably flat horizon of Yucatan does not appear to have done so), but in the light of Thom's findings I would find this a reductionist explanation. Several referees have suggested that there may be alternative explanations: I have noted above that Burl's work should also be studied. According to Vol. 14 No. 4 October 1973 439</page><page sequence="52">Burl (1973), there are over 900 stone circles known from Cornwall to the Orkneys and from Yorkshire across to Kerry: he provides a provisional chro- nology (in C 14, not real, years) for their geometrical designs, basing his study on an examination of 166 megalithic rings (40 circles, 32 flattened circles, 84 ellipses, and 10 egg-shaped rings). In view of De Valera's evidence with regard to the French immigrants in Ireland, it is of interest that the earliest known date for a stone circle is from New Grange, County Meath. The la- test, from Sandy Road, is as late as 1200 B.C.. We have seen that Muller applies Thom's theorems to Central European rings and that Wittry assigns a probable solstice function to mound- building posthole circles (about which more will be known when ongoing work with the Sanders and Reyman computer program is completed). Jo- seph Mountjoy (personal com- munication, 7 iII 73) reports a site in northern Mexico where aerial pho- tography indicates the presence of a number of circles; with a colleague, he will test for astronomical signifi- cance a group of eight circles sur- rounding a central one. Muller (1972; cf. fig. 18) notes that among the large stone installations in the Tihuanaco region there are stone rings that in startling fashion resemble those with astronomical orientations occurring by the hundreds in Neolithic Europe. He sees a cult significance for the circles, as I do, both on the basis of archaeoas- tronomy and on that of European folkloric survivals. Measuring with a theodolite various of the Peruvian sacred structures and complexes, Mul- ler suggests that winter-solstice orien- tations were highly significant, early records also indicating that nobles came from all regions to Cuzco to take part in the ceremonials of the winter- solstice sunrise (occurring in Peru in June). The chronology of the appear- ance of megalithic traits seems to me to have been fairly confused before I compounded the confusion by ad- ding astronomy. Sankalia (1962:100- 105) cites a number of megalith types including the cairn circle (with two or more subtypes) and the usual run of dolmens, porthole cists, and menhirs, frequently connected with secondary burials and associated with stone rings. He relates these to the earliest Tamil culture, as I do the cattle and solstice rituals. He cites Christoph von Furer- Haimendorf's theory that the mega- lith-builders were a people of Mediter- ranean stock practicing irrigation and metallurgy who entered South India by sea around 500 B.C., the evidence including the dolmenoid cist with porthole which in Western Europe is dated before 2000 B.C. (uncorrected). Whether this indicates a rather long sea voyage with intermediate stops or the persistence of megalithic traits, I do not know. Clark's comments about the uncriti- cal inclusion of references and the advisability of limiting the problem scope seem beside the point in a first bibliographical synthesis of a new sub- discipline not yet indexed (aside from the astronomy covered by the Peabody Museum Catalogue and the Human Relations Area Files). Though the data-collection stage is not yet termi- nated (as Snow hopes), that of hypothe- sis formulation has begun, with the Southwest as one of the richest areas for the task because of abundant eth- nographic data, well-preserved ar- chaeological and iconographic evi- dence, and the presence of living aboriginals who still remember tradi- tional astronomical practices and be- liefs. Reyman has estimated that in six months of hard reading one could cover the source materials well enough for hypothesis formulation. For ex- ample, Stephen's (1936) Hopi Journal and Parsons' (1939) Pueblo Indian Reli- gion would, he estimates, furnish evi- dence for at least a half-dozen hypoth- eses, all equally plausible, regarding the astronomical alignment of kivas and other structures to solar and stellar referents (cf. his references above and also DiPeso 1968, Ellis 1970, Fewkes 1900, Goldfrank 1962, Judd 1964, Kelley 1960, Reed 1956). Reyman (1973a) cites Bandelier (as quoted by Lange and Riley 1970:69-70) with re- gard to the astronomical function that might be attributed to towers: "The year begins about the winter solstice. The sun tower is used as follows. In winter, they look through a notch in the western wall, over a pillar to the east. When the sun rises over a certain point, there in a line with the pillar, then it is midwinter or the beginning of the year. In summer they look from a pillar in the summer gardens to the sun tower." In papers that are model studies in method (which Snow wishes to see), Reyman (1970, 1971 a, b, 1972) uses this Southwestern ethnology for the formulation and testing of hypoth- eses: he observes that every pueblo was and is significantly involved with astro- nomical observations organized on an institutional basis, linked with archi- tecture and ritual (including an accu- rate horizon calendar based on fixed observation points) and demonstrating attention to the sun (the major deity), the moon, Venus, the Pleiades, Orion, and Polaris, among other heavenly bodies. As he points out above, he sees astronomy as developing coincident with the sedentary village as the means of adapting high-yield cultigens to the uncertain growing season of the Southwestern plateau. Clark's questioning of Thom's megalithic yard is legitimate; I am told, however, by a correspondent who at- tended the London symposium on an- cient astronomy in December, 1972 that Hogg there withdrew his alterna- tive explanation in an aside to Thom. If Thom's case rests on "circumstantial evidence which can, at any point, be contradicted in detail," studies doing so have escaped my attention, and it is clear that Clark should have cited some. (Another former critic, Burl [1973], has fitted Thom's typology to British rings to establish chronology, as I have indicated above.) Because of restrictions of space, I necessarily limi- ted the data supporting some of my own arguments; in case this should unfairly prejudice some readers against archaeoastronomy itself, I feel that I should identify my own hypoth- eses and briefly sketch the type of evidence on which they are based. I have suggested above that docu- mentary and folkloric evidence in me- galithic areas appears to support Thom's megalithic calendar, and that astronomical skills and rituals (perhaps tied to critical agricultural tasks) trav- eled with the Neolithic, megalithic, and Bronze Age expansions. When further documented with ethnohistorical and archaeological data and tested in indi- cated areas, these hypotheses will be proven or disproven, but to dismiss them without testing as "speculative" or "diffusionist" misses the point that hypothesis formulation in a new sub- discipline must start somewhere. I suggested that Thom's megalithic cal- endar is archaeologically and ethnolog- ically testable, and I further suggest that such archaeoastronomical re- search may in some cases indicate by conflicting legends and dates that pre- cession has invalidated the ancient as- tronomical "announcer" data. A spe- cific and testable finding is also evident in Muller's statement that the Tihuan- aco people did not use the astronomical equinox, as unsophisticated astron- omers would have done, to divide the year into halves, but apparently used a sun declination of +0.5?, the value Thom finds for megalithic man. If, upon testing by precision methods, this is found to be true in a statistically significant number of cases, these data will tell us something for which an explanation must be found-especially if they occur in the context of a com- plex of other parallelisms. Is it "specu- lation" based on "superficial impres- sions taken out of context" to insist that such astronomical functions for megalithic and other ancient structures 440 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="53">Baity: ARCHAEOASTRONOMY AND ETHNOASTRONOMY will be proven or disproven not by argument but by ethnohistoric re- search followed by precision mapping and measuring, combined with the use of aids such as Aveni's tables (see below) and Sanders and Reyman's computer program? While I may differ from some of the commentators with regard to the extent of such speculation admissible in the pioneer data-collection and hypothesis-formulation stages of a new subdiscipline, it seems evident that the greater number of them do not quarrel with my major hypothesis-that pre- historic and early historic men encoded a remarkable degree of astronomical knowledge in architecture, art, and ritual and carried this knowledge with them when they traveled. It is clear that we will never recover all elements of belief, but I have theorized that we may recover with assurance many data with regard to astronomical knowl- edge, building orientations that indi- cate which stars and constellations were of significance, and the dates and gen- eral nature of calendric rituals, not only those in text-aided areas such as the Americas but also those in mega- lithic Western Europe. Specific hy- potheses for which the evidence un- fortunately is not yet published include the following: (1) that the Indus com- mercial sphere extended into and well across Africa; (2) that West Africa must be investigated as a type of staging area between the East and the New World; (3) that European folkloric evidence and surviving witchcraft practices, if closely studied, will afford much evi- dence as to the function and use of stone rings and of Thom's megalithic calendar; and (4) that archaeoastron- omy may be yet another discipline to afford evidence for pre-Columbian in- terhemispheric contacts. Mitra (1927:308-11), discussing In- dian megaliths, has characterized the southern seaboard of India as an area in which dolmen-like structures with cup marks are found near Asura sites occupied over a wide range of time from the Neolithic onward and asso- ciated with long-headed peoples prac- ticing Mediterranean rites including cremation. Fergusson (1872:498)- whose citation by Loofs remedies an omission-compares Eastern with Western dolmens, asserting that the holed dolmen and the simulated cist are part of a system affording innu- merable points of contact and that "it seems very difficult to refuse to believe that both styles were the product of one kindred race of men . . . more or less directly in communication with one another." Roy's comments and references fur- ther support the high importance of pre-Vedic astronomical knowledge, which, in my hypothesis, drew heavily upon proto-Indian sources (cf. Shafer 1954). Necessary archaeoastronomical tasks for this area are the precision measurement of Indus structures to determine possible astronomical align- ments and the further study of Indus cosmogony, in which planets were dei- ties (cf. Parpola above). I have noted a strong iconographic tradition of bull sacrifice (or play) associated with astronomical icons, evident in the Harappa city sherds and suggestive of a fire-bull cult in those of Cemetery H. The "stag's head" to which Roy refers is of interest in view of the frequent appearance of a stag in 4th- millennium Western Asian iconog- raphy (Iranian in particular) and in ritual scenes of the Camonica Valley, Iberia, and Noth Africa; but which rise-set phenomena this star or con- stellation was associated with, and whether it announced a solstice or equinox New Year, remain to be de- termined. The quarter-phase shift to which Roy alludes takes us in time (i.e., in four quarter shifts) through the complete precession cycle; though as- tronomers are capable of computing the position of significant asterisms throughout this 26,000-year period, some readers may have observed that the accuracy of such long-range computation is questioned by a coun- terhypothesis that questions the stabil- ity of the earth's crust throughout this period. By May, 1973, the reviewer of ar- chaeoastronomy studies can hardly overlook Velikovsky's (1950, 1955, 1963) view, mentioned in passing above, that near-collisions of Venus with Mars ca. 2400 B.C., 1500 B.C., and 800 B.C. caused worldwide catastrophes involving volcanic action and changes in sea levels (see Talbott 1972). MacKie (1973) sees the argument as having two parts-that catastrophes afflicted the earth in past ages and that planets have come into near-contact in historic times. Attempting to test the first, he charts radiocarbon dates having to do with volcanic action and changes in fossil shorelines and finds them to cluster, as the catastrophism hypothe- sis would predict. Juergens (1972) argues that while celestial mechanics in 1950 could not accommodate such a disordering of planets, recent space probes have indicated that the inter- planetary medium is not a vacuum but a plasma (an ionized gas) and that planets have shielding mechanisms, space-charge sheaths, which would unleash electrical fields and forces on approach, with disastrous effects. Such events, he suggests, are described in the historical documentation upon which Velikovsky has built his hypoth- eses. Cyr (1970) discusses the Vail hypothesis of ice crystals which may have given special effects to Stone- henge and other monuments of the megalithic period. Like Berger, I wonder why megalith- ic observatories fell into disuse; were the astronomers who manned them the victims of conquest or of natural disas- ter? Who, if not the Egyptian astron- omers, would have been held respon- sible for not having predicted or pre- vented that appalling catastrophe so graphically described by an eyewitness in the Papyrus Ipuwer (Van Seters 1964) that destroyed Egypt's Middle Kingdom? In an article that gives valu- able documentation from this source, astronomer Bell (1970, 197 1) advances the alternative hypothesis that the di- saster was caused by a failure of the Nile floods; her argument is cogent, but as yet she has not completed her plan to account for other Bronze Age disasters in areas with different climat- ic conditions. The drought hypothesis does not to me account for all of the conditions described by Ipuwer or for the Mycenean Dark Age, the Indus and Minoan catastrophes, and the Western Asian tectonic disasters. Vermeersch has suggested that simi- lar subjective constructs might have arisen independently. While this could hardly apply to highly complex con- structs with a known history-such as the lunar mansion construct, which may be identified in oracle-bone in- scriptions of about the 14th century B.C. and is also known from early Indi- an documentary evidence-I would agree that the Big Dipper could have been seen in unrelated cultures as a swastica, dipper, or spoon. That the same asterism would also have been seen as a bear is less plausible unless one hypothesizes a common heritage from ancient times. Certainly other asterisms should be studied, among them the Pleiades, the dragon and his American cousin the feathered serpent, the Asian-American turtle and scorpion, the Southeast Asian ma- cara and crocodile, the Asian feline and the American jaguar, which Hatch (1971) takes to be an analogue to Ursa Minor. (I note in passing a possible connection of the water-loving felines and bears with rain symbolism.) A comparative study of the north cir- cumpolar constellations would be es- pecially interesting in view of their near-invisibility in Peru, where the north pole star is below the horizon and the seasons are reversed. The Vol. 14 No. 4 October 1973 441</page><page sequence="54">independent appearance of similar subjective constructs over a large area could, however, imply a major cosmic event of an exceptional and threaten- ing nature which in the course of 24 hours would be seen over the entire globe. The appearance of comets and novae is recorded early in China; Needham (1959:424 and fig. 182) publishes an engraved oracle-bone dating from about 1300 B.C. which records "a great new star" in company with Antares. Not only the Chinese and the Japanese, but also (as Breternitz points out) the Southwestern Indians recorded the nova which became the Crab Nebula. As Berger states, another article the length of this one could have been written on ethnoastronomy; the vast field of astronomical myth (cf. Levi- Strauss 1969), for example, has hardly been touched. De Santillana and Von Dechend (1969) interpret ancient myths as a codified statement personi- fying the precession of the equinoxes and presenting it as the overthrow of a world order. (Most authorities have placed a knowledge of precession at a later date than the probable origin of these myths.) No less interesting is their thesis that the geography of the myths is not that of earth but that of the star-filled sky, the fateful events they depict not the acts of men but of gods who are also the astra. They see this cosmology as expressed in a structure of number, something per- ceived as a whole and expressed in myth and iconography. They inter- pret an ancient iconogram-that of the horned animal carrying between his horns (in Western Asia) or on his flank (in iconography I have observed in the American Southwest) the square of "the inhabited earth"-as representing not our earth but that ideal plane located by archaic astronomers along the ecliptic, the two solstices and the two equinoxes. They place Time Zero around 5000 B.C., when the bounding constellations of this "inhabited earth" were Gemini and Sagittarius, with Pisces and Virgo at the other two corners, and the Milky Way ran along the celestial meridian. In further reply to Clark, whether or not trait association is a weak reed depends, it seems to me, upon the weight and nature of the evidence un- der consideration. Heyerdahl (197 1 a, b) has demonstrated that a sufficient number of reeds bound together can cross oceans, whether or not early Egyptian prototypes of Ra did so. If the "diffusionist paradigm" is bankrupt, I suspect that like many another bankrupt concern it has opened up a flourishing business else- where under an assumed name: "in- terhemispheric contact," a subject upon which much interdisciplinary scholarship of high quality is edited by Riley et al. (1971) and Ashe (1971). Somewhat less critically, Gordon (1971) brings together evidence from various fields to support his hypotheses regarding the specific peoples in- volved. Kelley's statement that I see a Neo- lithic base for astronomical ideas which he regards as coming together only during the Hellenistic period prompts me to observe that I am discussing beginnings whereas he is studying a finished product (the lunar mansion construct of Chinese, Indians, and Mesoamericans). Western Asian ico- nography suggests to me that these subjective systems constructed on ob- servations of the ecliptic had their origins in a limited way when archaic astronomers first observed, in connec- tion with fixing the rise-set positions of the sun at its solstices, that certain star groups served as "announcers" of this by their heliacal rise-set times, that is, by their first appearance after oc- cultation due to conjunction. It is of course speculation on my part (based on iconography and on recorded or surviving rituals) that in Iran (and again in Iberia) a stag constellation (whether zodiacal or a paranatellon) may have served thus in the 5th-4th millennia, and at the moment it is equally speculation that such an event might have occurred at a solstice occa- sion in certain cultures, whereas dur- ing the 4th-2d millennia Taurus appears to have announced a spring equinox New Year to others. (Note, however, that Old World astronomers may have observed meridian passages as well as rise-set phenomena.) These hypotheses are yet unproven: in gen- eral, a concern with summer and winter solstices appears more reason- able for the colder north and a spring date with the needs of Neolithic agri- cultutalists, but we also must think in terms of hunters changing hunting grounds seasonally. Kelley has objected to the inclusion of studies which are "contradictory in detail and principle," but, again, is not one function of a synthesizing review the indication of differing points of view? Kelley, Dow, and others have stressed the necessity of control from the written sources. Not all areas, however, provide texts, and not all scripts have been adequately translat- ed, while iconography often affords quite explicit evidence with regard to rituals. Swauger and others have questioned the necessity for sophisticated astro- nomical and mathematical knowledge in the arrangement of sighting struc- tures. The gnomon, which was virtual- ly universal among the ancient cul- tures, could have been independently invented as a result of observations of shadow-casting natural objects. All peoples with fixed dwellings must have observed that the midwinter and mid- summer sunrises reached certain dis- tant markers on the horizon and then changed directions. We have seen that the Greeks used sky-charts suited to the skies of a millennium earlier; the proportion of sophisticated astron- omers in any culture may have been small and their science closely guarded, and their overthrow could have wiped out astronomical knowledge and train- ing systems. The inadequate coverage of South- east Asia is, as Loofs suspects, due to my unfamiliarity with textual materi- als. In fact, however, it was curiosity aroused in this region that directed me into protohistory. Angkor, the Burmese stupas, and other great ar- chitectural works overwhelm the imagination, but Bali nourishes it gently; it is touching to be shown the very seat (a megalithic one) occupied by the Sun God when he visits, fortu- nately only in spirit. Though a difficult area, somewhat lacking in stone and characterized by a climate and vegeta- tion that destroys wooden structures and disrupts stone ones, Southeast Asia is particularly important to this study. Perhaps someone qualified to do so will discover and list archaeoastronomy studies. When measurements with a transit can be made, Southeast Asian sacred structures should be compared with remarkably similar ones in the Americas and elsewhere. Needham well documents the region as a route of passage for early Chinese and Indi- an travelers, including the Buddhist ones I should have noted above. A massive influence is archaeologically indicated by Chinese and Indian types of architecture and art, including as- tronomical proto-chess and other forms of prognostication or imitative magic. Le May (1954) has noted pyra- mid orientations to the cardinal points and published a terraced square pyra- mid and a round tower which would have been at home in Chichen Itza'. Though in the absence of systematic measurements or orientations it is fu- tile to speak of function or resem- blances, I do call attention again to Kelley's citations of parallels in the Asian and Mesoamerican lunar man- sions, Heine-Geldern's and Ekholm's comparative studies of art, Kirchhoff's study of similar religious traits, and various studies of archaeological par- allels (Meggers 1971; Meggers, Evans, and Estrada 1965; Beirne 1971; Heyerdahl 1971 a, b; Sorenson 1971). 442 C U RRE NT A N TH RO POLOG Y</page><page sequence="55">Baity: ARCHAEOASTRONOMY AND ETHNOASTRONOMY Loofs' suggestion that known mega- lithic cultures and evidence of ar- chaeoastronomy be plotted on a map is a good one. When the requisite archaeoastronomy studies make this possible, I for one will be surprised if there is not considerable overlap- ping. I agree with Aveni that a clearer distinction should have been made between studies of site orientations based merely on map inspection and those based on measurements with a transit. Though Aveni may not consid- er himself that improbable hybrid the well-rounded archaeoastronomer, I suggest that MacKie, Reyman, Kelley, and others here listed whose profes- sion is archaeology are becoming suffi- ciently aware of astronomical facts to indicate that the archaeoastronomer is not far in the future. Aveni, as director of a seminar and field research pro- gram, should, however, agree that ar- chaeology students must be taught how to identify potentially significant sites, to map by astronomical north, and to scan the foreground for markers or postholes and the horizon for distant markers. Though archaeoastronomy will remain interdisciplinary, the early studies of Reyman, Molloy, Hatch, and others indicate that doctoral candi- dates can make outstanding contribu- tions to theory and method. Nor do I feel that Aveni really ques- tions the heavy astronomical content of Maya texts. In addition to the refer- ences listed above, the following sources are important to archaeoas- tronomers: F6rstemann (1904), Guthe (1932), Kelley (1970, 1972), Nuttall (1901), Sahagiun (1953), Seler (1904), Smiley (1970), Spinden (1916, 1928), Teeple (1931), Thompson (1972), and Weitzel (1949). An 11-page fragment which may be part of a fourth surviving codex has been described by Michael Coe (New York Times, April 21, 1971) as covering 25 Venus cycles (almost 104 solar years) and as furnishing additional pictorial information on the Venus calendar and its influence on Maya religion and astrology. This codex shows that the Maya considered all four phases of the Venus cycle to be malevolent and threatening: "The gods ruling each phase of Venus are depicted as killing and capturing peo- ple and burning towns." The new fragment, with Coe's interpretation, will soon be published by the Grolier Club (47 E. 60th St., New York, N.Y.). We must agree with Pohorecky that meaning was important, but when cul- tures had developed to the point where agricultural rituals required precise dating, measurement and food-getting must have coincided. Pittioni shares my feeling that as early as the Neolithic there was extensive knowledge about astronomy; the evidence of pre- Neolithic burials indicates some rea- sonably precise method of determining the sun's rising position at the equi- noxes and solstices. I did not mean to imply that Morley was the first to describe the Group-E- type alignment, and am glad Reyman noted this, as in fact I took Ricketson's (1928) article along when inspecting an alignment of this type (but reversed, perhaps for the observation of sunset phenomena) at the Temple of the Dolls at Dzibilchaltun in January; this com- plex, meticulously measured by Aveni, will be discussed by him in a subsequent publication (cf. Andrews 1959a, b). I am chagrined at the proofreading slip which deprived Paleolithic artists of the final sapiens due them, observed by Reyman but I hope not by my students. I dislike neologisms as much as the next person, but "astra," as a collective term, is useful to those to whom "celestial" evokes romantic overtones, while Thom's "megalithic man," though doubtless as mythical as the all-round archaeoastronomer, is too valuable a portmanteau term to abapdon. Other errors which are less defensible (including doubtless still others generously not noted) are ex- plainable in the phrase Samuel John- son used in reply to an irate reader's question as to why he had made a certain error in his encyclopaedia, "Ig- norance, Madam, ignorance!" Happi- ly, ignorance is vincible. Since final submission of this paper, I have learned of much significant research. In a paper of great heuristic value for archaeoastronomy, Hatch (1971) assigns an astronomical func- tion to the site plan of La Venta, where around 1000 B.C. the Olmecs con- structed a hugh fluted-cone pyramid as part of an impressive ceremonial complex oriented along a line 80 west of true north. In her hypothesis, the builders of La Venta had inherited a tradition appropriate to 2000 B.C., when to observers in the northern hemisphere the summer solstice would have been marked by a stellar configu- ration including not only Ursa Major, but also Cygnus, the Pleiades, Leo, and Scorpio; i.e., the center of the bowl of the Big Dipper (her CP Ursae Majoris) made a lower transit of the meridian going each way less than 15 minutes before midnight, crossing the triangu- lum of Cygnus making the transit going west, while at the same time the Pleiades rose in the east and Scorpio set in the west. (In her hypothesis, these four equidistant constellations, follow- ing each other by approximately 90? in right ascension, marked for the Olmecs the summer solstice, the au- tumnal equinox, the winter solstice, and the vernal equinox respectively with their midnight transits.) Thus, she holds, the La Venta site at 180 north latitude was oriented ca. 1000 B.C. to CP Ursae Majoris, which set on the horizon 80 west of north. She attributes to the Olmecs a practical astronomy and glyphic records of such phenome- na as meridian transits in connection with solstices. Her hypothesis is of further interest in that the Olmec con- cern with circumpolar constellations, like Olmec art, is suggestive of Chinese influence. Fuson (1969), working with the orientations of Mesoamerican sacred structures and city sites, ob- serves what appear to be culturally important solar and stellar rise-set alignments; he has also assembled evi- dence supporting M. D. Coe's sugges- tion that a magnetite object found in southern Veracruz may have been part of an early Olmec magnetic compass. A group from Colgate University headed by Aveni has been conducting field investigations in Central Mexico and Yucatan to determine whether particular site alignments obtained with a transit are correlated with astro- nomical rise-set phenomena (Aveni 1970). The field program utilizes a set of tables (Aveni 1972) giving rise-set dates of bright stars for a combination of epochs, latitudes, and horizon ele- vations. Preliminary results with re- gard to Building J at Monte Albain (cf. Caso 1932) have been analyzed (Aveni and Linsley 1972) in a paper which suggests the possible importance of the heliacal rising of Capella as an "an- nouncer" of a solar zenith passage. Students of Aveni are making studies in depth of astronomical glyphs. Computerized results of the field sur- veys should be available within the year. On the basis of archaeoastronomical, iconographic, and textual studies, Zui- dema (personal communication, 1 v 73) independently confirms Muller's (1972) views with regard to the astro- nomical basis of the Inca architecture and cosmology. He has identified cer- tain markers (pillars) which may have been used as sighting devices for the determination of the winter-solstice sunrise and plans to investigate this possibility further this summer. His research indicates 328 sacred sites in Cuzco; when these are added to others in the Temple of the Sun, the total is 365. The days of this solar year were, in his hypothesis, arranged in nine-day weeks and 27 '-day months, indicating lunar as well as solar calendric obser- Vol. 14 * No. 4 * October 1973 443</page><page sequence="56">vations. From the Temple of the Sun, he suggests, 41 lines radiated like the spokes of a wheel in groups of three linked to a pillar indicating the new month. His nine-day week is of interest in connection with Kelley's (1972) study of the Nine Lords of the Night, in which he examines Maya glyphs, Mexican sources, and a Zapotec calen- dar list and concludes that the Lords represented nine days named for gods, the planet list indicating that they began their rule at midnight. Kelley turns to Indian sources for an expla- nation of the number nine, finding evidence that the gods involved in their day-name order were Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn (precisely the same as in the Latinized names of our weekdays), the two remaining deities being the moon's ascending node (Rahu, head of the eclipse dragon) and its descending node (Ketu, tail). His study of the characteristics of the Mesoamerican Nine Lords and the Indian day-list deities also indicates parallels in attri- butes; he sees the time indicated by the order of the Indian lists as some- what postdating the 2d century B.C., a period also suggested by his study of the lunar mansions. (I point out again that specific evidence of this nature need not lead us to assume that a first contact is indicated; if Proto-In- dian travelers were in Africa, as the evidence seems to me [see Jones 1964, 1971], the further step to the Americas is not inconceivable.) That the Indus people were great astronomers as well as magicians we know from Vedic sources; though Roy assigns these as- tronomical traditions, already evident in Vedic materials in 1300 B.C., to Indo-Europeans, the similarity of Kel- ley's data to the astronomical materials described by Parpola from the decod- ing of Indus seals leads me to believe that the invaders took over what they could of the Indus science. Zuidema's comments on Peruvian astronomy fur- ther indicate the importance of ar- chaeoastronomical studies in this area where a variety of evidence indicates many Old World-New World parallels. Increasing interest in archaeoas- tronomy is evidenced by recent semi- nars. At a Mesoamerican symposium at Cambridge University, August 29- 31, 1972, Marshack (1972) discussed Gossen's (1972) find of a surviving aboriginal Mesoamerican solar calen- dar of evident antiquity, Digby (1972a; see also 1972b) described a hypothet- ical astronomical instrument suggested by representations in the codices, and Baity (1972) reported on recent re- search. "The Place of Astronomy in the Ancient World" was the title of a meet- ing held by the Royal Society, in con- junction with the British Academy, December 7-8, 1972; the discussion stressed Thom's findings in regard to megalithic astronomy and further confirmed the significant role of as- tronomy in the early cults of Mesopo- tamia, Egypt, and China. Newton (1972) analyzed the need of ancient astronomers to develop methods of dealing with rise-set and other appar- ent phenomena in terms of a coordinate system based on the observer's horizon. Aaboe (1972) broadly classified pre- scientific astronomy, compared late with earlier Babylonian astronomy (at- tributing the uniqueness of Babylonian mathematical astronomy to its base in a particular type of mathematics), and traced its influence in Hellenistic, In- dian, and Islamic astronomy. Sachs (1972) gave evidence of systematic as- tronomical observation early in the 2d millennium B.C., during which period Venus was closely scrutinized. Parker (1972) summed up Egyptian calen- drics. Hawkins (1972) offered new evi- dence on Stonehenge and on the Amon Ra temple, which he found to be oriented to sunrise at the winter solstice. Needham (1972) described early Chinese astronomy as polar and equatorial rather than planetary and ecliptic and as bureaucratic rather than scholarly, also emphasizing the signifi- cance of astronomy in the development of the other sciences and the arts. Thom (1972) summarized the mega- lithic designers' use of an integral right-angled triangle, their observa- tions of the moon's perturbations, and the structure of the megalithic calen- dar (cf. Thom and Thom 1972). In connection with the study of the moon's perturbations, Thom de- scribed the extrapolation sectors in Caithness, the Orkneys, and Brittany and suggested that the alignments at Le Menec may provide an adjustment for the moon's varying speed in its orbit. Atkinson (1972) reaffirmed his support of Thom's high opinion of Neolithic engineering and stressed the impact of corrected radiocarbon chro- nology on the dating of Western Euro- pean cultures, with its implication that mining, megalithic construction, and perhaps the wheel may have developed independently in the West. Climatic factors which had bearing on the early cultures were reviewed by Lamb (1972). MacKie (1972) discussed his two archaeological tests of Thom's as- tronomical implications. Kendall (1972) analyzed the difficulties in deal- ing with Thom's megalithic quantum of 5.44 ft. (1.66 m.) on the basis of current studies. Lewis (1972a) contrib- uted data on astronomical navigation and weather lore in Polynesia and Mi- cronesia and suggested that wide- spread parallels indicate the possible diffusion of astronomical concepts throughout the Neolithic world (cf. Lewis 1972b:45-82 on steering by the stars). The Maya astronomical system was discussed by Thompson (1972), who called attention to objective astro- nomical knowledge of such precision that the corrected error in Venus rev- olutions is one day in 6,000 years. A symposium arranged and chaired by me was jointly sponsored by the departments of anthropology, ge- ography, and physics of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on March 7, 1973, and additional papers were read at a joint meeting of the Southern Anthropological Society and the American Ethnological Society at Wrightsville Beach on March 8. Aveni (1973a,b) discussed the determination of astronomical orientations by mea- surement with a transit and the use of his tables (cited above). Fuson (1973a) discussed a new research tool, "magneto-archaeology," the study of the deliberate alignment of structures to magnetic north, and (1973b) showed that a large number of Maya sites have longitudinal alignments to present magnetic north and that dramatic shifts in orientation occurred at ap- proximately the same time (as indicat- ed by dated stelae) in widely separated sites. Magnetic north is of course a strictly local and shifting phenomenon, though the low latitude of the Maya sites cuts down the variation somewhat. (Readers interested in magnetoar- chaeology should see Needham's [1962:229-334] discussion of magnet- ism, divination, and chess; it is also of interest that Maya noblemen, the Lords of Totonicapain, stated that their ancestors brought to Mesoamerica a "sacred director" and were led by four principal leaders, whose names B. P. Reko identifies as the four constella- tions representing the four quarters of the heavens [cf. Ferguson 1962:17- 38].) Reyman (1973a,b), discussing ethnographic accounts of Puebloan as- tronomical practices, listed sources for the formulation of archaeoastronomi- cal hypotheses. Smiley's (1973b) com- munication was of particular interest for introducing yet another celestial variable which has been a concern of archaic astronomers-the differing positions of the Milky Way throughout time, from approximately the 5th mil- lennium to the Classic Maya period. Comparing the orientations of a Maya platform described to him by Ruiz with those of the longest of the Nasca desert straight lines, Smiley (1973a) suggested that the Peruvians may have had pri- ority in constructing a match to the position of the Milky Way (cf. Cowan's hypothesis below with reference to 444 C U RRE NT A N TH RO POLOG Y</page><page sequence="57">Baity: ARCHAEOASTRONOMY AND ETHNOASTRONOMY template matches). Smiley suggested that when this research tool is refined, it can perhaps be used to date these and other constructions and lines. I (Baity 1973a,b) surveyed some of the evidence from other scientific disci- plines which indicates the possibility that mariners could have brought a knowledge of Old World astronomical instruments and constructs to the New World. A seminar on archaeostronomy in pre-Columbian America (part of the program of the American Association for the Advancement of Science) to be co-chaired by Aveni and Hartung in Mexico City in mid-June aims to explore the astronomical knowledge and skills of the ancient peoples of the New World and their effect upon other aspects of life. To judge from the abstracts at hand, this meeting should bring new evidence to bear on prob- lems of the origin and correct correla- tion of the Mesoamerican calendar and the role of astronomical orientations and calendric rituals in Mesoamerican sacred architecture; a secondary focus will be on the astronomical record in the rock art of the southwestern United States. Coe's (1973) keynoting paper will compare the information provided by the codices, the carved monuments, and native intellectuals and Spanish scholars writing shortly after the Con- quest with that derived from modern ethnography to determine which heavenly bodies and asterisms were of interest to ancient Mesoamericaas-an analysis designed to provide informa- tion applicable to the problems of site and building orientations. Though the seminar focuses on Mesoamerica, Hawkins (1973) will summarize his recent research in Europe and Egypt as well as in Peru and Central America, and Jon Olson (personal com- munication, 28 xi 72) will also discuss Old World materials. Olson suggests that the Stanton Drew stone circles, three large Neolithic stone circles 60 km. northwest of Stonehenge, could have been used to mark the seasonal risings of the sun and full moon in a similar but more complex manner than at Stonehenge. His study of megalithic rings as counting devices shows a preference for groupings of 12 and 13, 18 and 19,29 and 30 stones, leading him to suggest that the circles may have indicated the numbers of months, years, and days in lunar and solar cycles. Marshack (1973) will ana- lyze an arithmetic-calendric Olmec mosaic dated to around 1200 B.C. Hatch (1973) finds that pictures ac- companying the 260-day count in the Madrid Codex (pp. 12-18) correlate with constellations as they would have been observed after sunset as the year progressed, in the general time period of the estimated date of the Codex, and suggests that the pages deal with a "serpent calendar." Hochleitner (1973) will analyze six Long Count dates found in the Dres- den Codex in support of his correlation of Maya and Christian calendars: he finds evidence here of a match with two solar eclipses and a lunar eclipse. Utilizing the rattlesnake (Pleiades) and the turtle (Gemini-Scorpio) constella- tions, he reconstructs a hypothetical Maya zodiac which places the begin- ning of the year at the spring equinox. His equation puts the date of the last Mayan calendar reform (according to De Landa) in A.D. 1081. Owen (1973) will use Makemson's correlation in the interpretation of the astronomical meaning of the "ten pictured" intervals in the Dresden Codex eclipse table. Other iconographic evidence of in- terest in connection with the begin- nings of Maya astronomy will be cited by Marsh (1973), among them a possi- ble pre-Mayan numbering system, eclipse hieroglyphics, and other icons which he compares with Asian icono- graphic symbols, suggesting a relation- ship. Schove (1973) suggests that a comparison of Aztec astronomical and meteorological dates with Chinese and European astronomical records might be used to determine when the Mixtec and Maya peoples would have ob- served datable astronomical events such as comets, eclipses, conspicuous meteor showers, or unusual mete- orological conditions such as severe droughts. With a "spectrum of time" thus established, he suggests, a com- parison might be made of proposed solutions of the Maya correlation problem. Harber (1973), on the same assumption that the Maya recorded comets, novae, and other temporary astronomical events, tests the theory by his hypothesis that the "cross- legged" glyph (Glyph X, form 40) was used to signify the arrival of a comet or nova. On the basis of this hypothesis he compares Chinese and European records of comets and novae with Mayan dates associated with this glyph, finding confirmation for certain calen- dar correlation constants. A concor- dance table is also to be presented by Noriega (1973), who will analyze Maya and Nahua calendric systems and as- tronomical computing and describe mathematical-astronomical symbols used by the Aztecs. Several papers indicate that astro- nomical events were routinely used to date essential agricultural tasks. Shaw (1973), studying the 260-day calendar, concludes that it marks critical time elements in maize cultivation, and offers further evidence that the helia- cal risings of specific constellations and stars may have governed the timing of agricultural operations. Cook de Leonard (1973a) studies the survival of feasts related to the agricultural cycle, together with the celebration of events on or about the solstices and equinoxes, to explain coincidences in the dates of Christian and aboriginal festivities. She also (1973b) studies the four panels on the walls of the Tajin ballcourt (dated ca. A.D. 1000), using known astronomical signs to aid in the interpretation of others in order to add a timetable to their contents. The orientations of Mesoamerican structures and ceremonial centers will be discussed by Aveni, Drucker, Fuson, Hartung, and Hurtado. Aveni (1973c) will report on fieldwork with a transit in several areas; he has found nearly identical orientations for the Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacain and the pyramids of Tenayuca (cf. Marquina 1932) and Tepozteco, all of which align approximately 170 north of west, con- firming an early match with the Pleiades-set position noted by Mar- quina and Ruiz (1932). Aveni suggests that further measurements must be made to establish whether a " 17? family of orientation" exists. (This should be compared with Muller's [1972] indica- tions of architectural alignments in Peru that appear to match setting phe- nomena and with MacGowan's [1945] remarkable one-page paper antici- pating Aveni's findings.) Aveni's mea- surement of Caracol windows suggests two alignments with Venus-set posi- tions when at extreme declinations, an argument supported by Kelley's dis- covery of Venus representations on Caracol Stela 3 (A. F. Aveni, personal communication, I 73). This and other findings discussed above indicated the use of alignments in calendar setting, the use of "announcer" stars to predict solar zenith passage, and the use of Group-E-type structures to indicate solstices and equinoxes. Drucker (1973), arguing that the main axis of Teotihuacain was original- ly oriented 15?25' east of true north (the same orientation having been fol- lowed in a major rebuilding of the city around A.D. 600, by which time preces- sion would have rendered this orienta- tion obsolete), concludes that a solar rather than a stellar orientation is indi- cated and finds this further suggested by indications of winter-solstice obser- vation from the pyramids of the Sun and of the Moon. Fuson (1973c) adds further evidence with regard to factors affecting the orientations of the cere- Vol. 14 No. 4 October 1973 445</page><page sequence="58">monial structures, concluding that as- tronomical and geomagnetic factors were the principal determinants of the Mesoamerican alignments. Hartung (1973) adds further evidence of the importance of astronomical knowledge in Mesoamerican sacred architecture and suggests rigorous criteria for dis- tinguishing the class of lines relating to visual functional composition from that having to do with astronomical and other orientation directions. Hur- tado (1973) analyzes an archaeological plaza with regard to both its cultural ambit and its astronomical function. Chamberlain (1973) will examine as- tronomical legends and symbols which appear in pictographs, petroglyphs, kiva art, dry paintings, and more re- cent art. Williamson et al. (1973) will review evidence that the Indians who occupied Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, from A.D. 700 to 1200 had a sophisti- cated understanding of astronomy and used their structures as crude astro- nomical instruments, astronomically aligning their great kivas. They note perpendicular directional markings cut into a rock which appear to align with winter-solstice sunrise, a hypothe- sis which agrees with that of Smiley (1973a) with regard to the Nasca lines. Citing previous work by Miller (1955) and Brandt et al. (1972), Williamson (1973) hypothesizes that the Crab Nebula supernova explosion-which, according to the Sung-shih, was report- ed by the Chinese astronomer Yang Wei-Tak on July 4, 1054-is repre- sented by both a pictograph and a petroglyph in Fern Cave and that these also record a rare conjunction visible essentially only from western North America, the crescent moon a few degrees north of the supernova. His argument, like that of Miller, is based partly on the rare appearance of cres- cents in the North American rock art collated and discussed by Heizer and Baumhoff (1962), Schwartz (1963), and Grant (1967). Ellis (1973), in a study of Southwestern calendric ob- servation and symbols, suggests, however, that this symplegma may be a sun-moon-morning-star combination pertaining to solstice observations. She offers evidence that stars were impor- tant as symbols of certain supernatural beings (as we have seen they were in Indus and Mexican cosmology) and that the astra were observed as time- markers. The system, she suggests, may have been introduced from Mexi- co by traders. Britt (1973) will summa- rize the literature on the 14 "star ceil- ing" archaeological sites of early Nava- jo origin in the Canion de Chelly and report on his work with Navajo inter- preters to correlate pictographs with Navajo star mythology. Cowan (personal communication, 28 ii 73) will advance a hypothesis with regard to the function of effigy mounds which, I suggest, should be tested with the Nasca figures and even with Asian city plans. Many ancient sites, he notes, involve single-point alignments, where a fixed terrestrial point coincides with a single stellar object on the horizon; the effigy mounds, however, may be actual models or reproductions of constella- tions (bears, serpents, birds) or, in short, a template match. (Could a translation into architecture of this principle-i.e., the Chinese polar- cum-four-quarters model in astron- omy and governmental structure-be present in the Southeast Asian stepped cones of pyramids which are sur- mounted by a central stupa surround- ed by four others?) Reyman (1973c) notes that many archaeoastronomical studies have not produced convincing results because the investigators have neither ade- quately defined their problem nor considered the incompleteness of the archaeological record; he offers a pro- gram for the formulation and testing of archaeoastronomical hypotheses. A significant function of the Mexico City seminar will be to draw together the threads which indicate the strongly astronomical nature of Mesoamerican culture and to indicate some directives for continuing archaeoastronomy and ethnoastronomy in the Americas, the topic of my summarizing report (Baity 1973c).
