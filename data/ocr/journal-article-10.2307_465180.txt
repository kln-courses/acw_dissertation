<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE UNIMAGINABLE TOUCH OF TROPES TIMOTHYBAHTI Paul de Man. ROMANTICISM AND CONTEMPORARY CRITICISM: THE GAUSS SEMINAR AND OTHER PAPERS. Ed. E. S. Burt, Kevin Newmark, and Andrzej Warminski. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 1993. Cited by page number only. It is impossible to be so consistently right at the expense of others without some danger to oneself -Paul de Man, "Roland Barthes and the Limits of Structuralism" With the publication of Romanticism and Contemporary Criticism, the complete works of Paul de Man are nearly so. Only the long-anticipated and perhaps eventually forthcom- ing essays collected under the title of Aesthetic Ideology remain to finish the set. When complete, the complete works will not constitute a standard edition, for they have four different publishers, under posthumous and preposthumous editorial arrangements that make even less sense now, with the appearance of this latest volume. Work on romanti- cism-the reprinted and rightly famous "Rhetoric of Temporality" (albeit with a key line dropped and to this day left unremarked by an errata slip by its republishers)1-was already combined with writings on contemporary criticism in the second edition of Blindness and Insight, and the inverse is the case in this collection: Roland Barthes is a bookfellow of Holderlin and Wordsworth. In retrospect, the volume that de Man designated as the marker of a failure [RR viii], The Rhetoric of Romanticism, appears to be the most topically coherent of his books in print. With the exception of the essay on Roland Barthes, commissioned but never printed by the New York Review of Books, the papers collected here were not written for publication, but for lecturing and responding to lectures. Several are fragmentary. But in glimpses here and there, one can see the entire trajectory of de Man's methodological vocabularies and investments, from an ontological phenomenology-"The main task of any ontology thus becomes the description of this [Heideggerian, three-dimensional] temporal structurization, which will necessarily be a phenomenology of temporality (since it is the description of consciousness) as well as a phenomenology of language (since the manner in which temporality exists for our consciousness is through the mediation of language)" [58]-to the dismissal, in a 1981 response to Murray Krieger, of temporal continuities as well as all phenomenalities in the name of inscription and materiality. In between those poles is de Man at Yale in the mid-1970s: after a lecture by 1. The lines in question, concerning Wordsworth's "A slumber did my spirit seal," in the essay's original publication in Interpretation: Theory and Practice read: "The 'now' of the poem is not an actual now, but the ideal 'now,' the duration ofan acquired wisdom. The actual now, which is that of the moment of death, lies hidden in the blank space between the two stanzas " [Singleton 206]. In the essay's republication in the second edition of Blindness and Insight, they read (ungrammatically): "The 'now' of the poem is not an actual now, which is that of the moment of death, lies hidden in the blank space between the two stanzas" [225]. diacritics 25.4: 39-58 diacritics / winter 1995</page><page sequence="2">Wolfgang Iser, the host Geoffrey Hartman tries to solicit a question from him, and de Man dismisses the effort with a wave of his hand and the demurral "No phenomenology for me." These posthumous papers allow one to retrace and refamiliarize oneself with de Man's methodological and theoretical trajectories from the mid-fifties to 1967, and again from the late sixties to the end of his career. "Retrace" because the papers testify to a shift that not only has been remarked upon previously by editors and interpreters, but was retrospectively announced by de Man himself in his foreword to the second edition of Blindness and Insight: the shift from an interpretive language of temporality and the intentionality of consciousness to one of rhetoricity and specific rhetorical figures. This shift was already readable in the first edition of Blindness and Insight, in the terminologi- cal distance between the essays on Poulet or American New Criticism and Heidegger and the one on Derrida, and it became even more legible with the inclusion of "The Rhetoric of Temporality." The shift was apparent again in the posthumous appearance of the authorized collection The Rhetoric of Romanticism: although all the essays there address rhetorical figures, those from the fifties and sixties envelop their language of image and metaphor in one of consciousness and being, while the later ones resolutely dementalize and rematerialize (linguisticize) their attention to and deployment of tropological struc- tures. Romanticism and Contemporary Criticism gives us, for the most part, what de Man turned away from. Yet the volume retains its fascinations, not least for the aficionado or the bibliophile who might want to trace the many genetic and intertextual relations between lecture versions of a reading, a topic, or an argument and its later published versions. "The Contemporary Criticism of Romanticism," for instance, the opening lecture of the Gauss seminar (delivered at Princeton in the spring of 1967), is a classic, cut-to-fit deconstruction of Ren6 Girard's "demystification" of romanticism in his Mensonge romantique et verite romanesque, a reading so exquisitely in the model of the later collection of such essays, Blindness and Insight, that one is obliged to ask and speculate why de Man did not wish to include Girard-recently introduced on French radio, half accurately, as a "Christian philosopher"-among the company of Binswanger, Poulet, Blanchot, Lukacs, and Derrida. When one finds a number of phrases and sentences from that book's first chapter here in this lecture, it becomes apparent that de Man did a good bit of rewriting to expunge Girard. And there is the almost sensuous experience of intertextual crossing and weaving in the third Gauss lecture, "Patterns of Temporality in Holderlin's 'Wie wenn am Feiertage . .. ,"' where the knowledgeable reader can appreciate phrases, sentences, quotes, and ideas from other de Man texts both anterior and posterior: "Criticism and Crisis" and "Form and Intent in the American New Criticism," from Blindness and Insight; the already extant essays "Heidegger's Exegeses of H6olderlin," "Intentional Structure of the Romantic Image," and "Wordsworth and Holderlin"; and the later "Rhetoric of Temporality." All are rolled into a nonetheless original and surprisingly thorough commentary on the Holderlin poem in question. De Man's "complete" achievement as a major literary theorist is accessible-and of interest-to perhaps only a small minority of his readers in Europe and the United States. From "The Resistance to Theory" onward, the more relentlessly de Man pursued the argument that literary theory, if it only remained true to its linguistic and tropological bases, was ineluctably a critique of aesthetics and of ideology, the more he provoked the resistance to theory that he predicted and that he still elicits. The consistent and deeply established aesthetic interests of literary institutions (authors, publishers, reviewers, readers) and the even more pronounced ideological interests of today's academic teaching and criticism (political correctness, neoconservatism, new historicism) combine to make de Man's literary theory half-poisonous and half-unrecognizable. 40</page><page sequence="3">This volume of papers nonetheless responds to a possible interest in de Man as a reader, both of other critics (in the manner of Blindness andInsight) and of great literature (in the manner of Allegories of Reading and The Rhetoric of Romanticism). For the two kinds of reading are originally, novelly in evidence in Romanticism and Contemporary Criticism. The reading of Roland Barthes, for example, is, as they say, worth the price of the book (but it won't be purchased for that reason, the essay being photocopyable). In an imaginary standard edition, it would be grouped with those now in the collection The Resistance to Theory: less with "Dialogue and Dialogism," his cautionary account of the then-newfound enthusiasm for Bakhtin, than with "The Return to Philology"-like the review of Barthes a patient yet brief, superbly informed yet clear explanation for a broad audience of what is going on at a literary-theoretical moment and what it puts at stake. For whatever de Man thought of Barthes and his work (he taught him rarely if at all, and wrote critically but only fleetingly on him elsewhere), here, in "Roland Barthes and the Limits of Structuralism," are all the aspects of the next decade (1972-82) of de Man's theoretical interests and his pedagogic-explanatory efforts. Explaining Barthes and his structuralist context, de Man identifies the mistakes, the unfulfillable ambitions, the self-contradictory and self-resisting projects that would continue to orient literary criticism and theory through the 1980s and beyond. De Man sketches errors that would be committed by the practitioners of the most recent theories-illusions about fictionality and self-referentiality as literary-theoretical "answers," for example, or the unavoidable temptations of a science of literature-as well as those that would be represented by scholars hostile to theory: misunderstandings of a necessary critique of reference or the Anglo-American combina- tion of resentment and resistance toward French (and French-based) theory. De Man also anticipates here his "Resistance to Theory" essay in suggesting, via remarks on Barthes's Mythologies, the reach of literary theory beyond aesthetics toward a critique of all ideology. If the essay is worth the price of the book, sentences like these are worth the expense of spirit that is the cost of its reading: At stake here is the future of structuralism as an intellectual movement but also as a methodological blueprint for scientific research that, like Rousseau's state of nature, "no longer exists, has perhaps never existed and will probably never come into being" but which we nevertheless cannot do without. [171] The traditional concept of reading used by Barthes and based on the model of an encoding/decoding process is inoperative if the master code remains out of reach of the operator, who then becomes unable to understand his own discourse. A science unable to read itself can no longer be called a science. [ 174] The main point to be learnedfrom Barthes is not that literature has no referential function but that no "ultimate" referent can ever be reached and that therefore the rationality of the critical metalanguage is constantly threatened and problematic. [176] How distant the whole essay seems now, from its composition twenty-three years ago to its reach back across texts and developments from another twenty years earlier. There is apparently more interest today in the gay Barthes than the guiding Barthes, and French structuralism, from Jakobson and Levi-Strauss across Barthes to its critique in Derrida, is often the last thing that students (and their professors) want to read. The same may be the case with de Man's lucid and comprehensive presentations together with his essential critiques of the theorists and critics he studied in Blindness and Insight: Poulet, Blanchot, the early Heidegger, and the technical Derrida. diacritics / winter 1995 41</page><page sequence="4">For the time being, then, perhaps it is neither de Man the rigorous literary theorist nor de Man the unmatched explicator and critic of other critics and theorists who can expect a new reading from out of the papers now collected in Romanticism and Contemporary Criticism. But de Man as the reader of great literature is, I believe, the version of the scholar that remains most incontrovertible today and is shown as such in a foreshortened but therefore essentially correct perspective in Romanticism and Contemporary Criti- cism. He wrote half a book on Rousseau, and while political theorists will have every professionally defensive, and therefore understandable, reason to want to avoid de Man's deconstruction of the political/fictional distinction in Rousseau, no self-respecting Rousseau scholar can avoid de Man's mark on how Rousseau is read. In the second lecture of the Gauss seminar, however, on Starobinski's La transparence et l'obstacle and Rousseau's Pygmalion, de Man's account of Rousseau is awkwardly suspended between the topic of a reflective return to a source (as in his essays on Holderlin's "Der Rhein" in The Rhetoric of Romanticism or on Poulet in Blindness and Insight) and the thesis of a reflective or imaginary self in contradistinction to an empirical one (which awaits its full elaboration and tropological deconstruction in the second part of "The Rhetoric of Temporality"). The reading of Pygmalion here is superseded, moreover, by the improved one subsequently included as "Self (Pygmalion)" in Allegories of Reading. All the other readings in Romanticism and Contemporary Criticism are of poets, specifically Holderlin, Wordsworth, Baudelaire, Mallarme, and-very briefly, in the response to Krieger- Keats. Although de Man later wrote several essays on Nietzsche and other philosophers (Pascal, Kant, Hegel)-all of them controversial-and briefly on Proust, it is as a reader of poetry that the de Man of Romanticism and Contemporary Criticism is the most accessible and instructive today and, as I shall try to demonstrate by way of a close reading, that he provides the most compelling route back to his lessons as a theorist and a reader of criticism. * * * The Rhetoric of Romanticism-with the exception of its last chapter on Kleist-is a collection of essays on poetry; in every one of the essays, poetic language is separated from its ostensible intent, theme, or aesthetic accomplishment. The romantic image, which aspires to name the natural object, is exposed as the reiterative positing of its difference from literal objects. The sun and the de-facing eye, light and its disarticulation, the sky and its nonmimesis, analogical correspondences and their enumerative unbalanc- ing: in each case-Holderlin, Wordsworth, Shelley, Yeats, Baudelaire-poems are read closely, and the tropes that tum up are pursued rigorously to their analytic-deconstructive conclusions. Add to this book four other pieces of writing-the superb close reading of the Mallarm6 sonnet "Tombeau pour Verlaine" in "Lyric and Modernity," included in Blindness andInsight; the Rilke chapter inAllegories of Reading, originally the introduc- tion to a French edition of Rilke and still the best thirty-five pages anyone has written on the poet; the few pages on Baudelaire's "J'ai plus de souvenirs que si j'avais mille ans" in his introduction to a volume of Hans Robert Jauss's writings; and his introduction to his 1966 Signet edition of Keats's poetry, an important-enough critique of biographical and pathos-laden readings of the poet to have received respectful attention years later from the poet's best reader, Helen Vendler-add these four pieces to The Rhetoric of Romanticism and one has the authorized total of de Man's important writings on great poetry. To the question that obviously follows-whether Romanticism and Contemporary Criticism significantly adds to or alters this body of work-the answer should be, perhaps, "No, but.. ." The volume includes a paper from the mid-fifties titled "The Double Aspect 42</page><page sequence="5">of Symbolism" that itself includes a page of commentary on Mallarme's sonnet "Le vierge, le vivace et le bel aujourd'hui." While rightly identifying the poet's "irrevocable commitment to language" and "against natural being" [158], this commentary does not go beyond the same point made of Mallarme in "Intentional Structure," and that claim remains less insightful than de Man's later argument, in "Lyric and Modernity," that Mallarme necessarily remains entangled within a language of the representation of objects. The same paper ("The Double Aspect") and especially the sixth lecture of the Gauss seminar, "Allegory and Irony in Baudelaire," illuminateLesfleursdu mal via some brief comments on "Le voyage" and "L'invitation au voyage"; but the centerpiece of the lecture is a comparison of "Correspondances" and "Obsession," which argues that the latter is "an explicit demythification of the assertive positivity of the earlier poem . . . achieved by taking the symbolic assertion of 'Correspondances' literally and showing what it means from the point of view of an actual self [113]. But this discussion is brief, thematic, and altogether flat compared to the much later, more detailed, and tropologically brilliant comparison of the same two poems in "Anthropomorphism and Trope in the Lyric," included in The Rhetoric of Romanticism. One learns little about Baudelaire from de Man in this volume, whereas one had already learned much from "The Rhetoric of Temporality," from "Literary History and Literary Modernity" in Blindness and Insight, and from the other two texts I have mentioned. Regarding Keats, the three-and-a-half pages on two lines of Keats's "Ode to a Nightingale," which are the bulk of de Man's response to a paper by Murray Krieger, are uncompromising and analytically correct in their insistence on the asymmetry of the "a vision; or a waking dream" / "wake or sleep" pairings, and acute in remarking the materiality of the word "forlorn" in the poem's turn in the final strophe; but their argumentation is elliptical, at once dense and quick, and the far-reaching conclusions are left as assertions. They remain to my mind somewhat like the page in "The Resistance to Theory" on Keats's title "The Fall of Hyperion" and its undecidably double meaning: brilliant apergus that invite someone else to do further work. I believe that de Man stopped working on Keats after the fifties (apart from his Signet introduction) because overcoming the resistance mounted by the aesthetics of Keats's language would have occasioned either too much exegetical labor or bad faith, or too little epistemological reward, or both. It is not at all so with Holderlin and Wordsworth, the two poets on whom de Man published the most if not over the longest time (that was Baudelaire), and the two who are also most strongly represented in the papers of Romanticism and Contemporary Criti- cism. With these authors de Man spared little labor, showed no impatience, matched the audacity of their language with the honesty of its recognition, and-in the case of Wordsworth-came away with radically new and important interpretations. What hap- pened with Holderlin and de Man is difficult to account for in a brief space, but the papers we now can read help explain some of it. For more than fifteen years (from the early 1950s to 1970, although less in the last of these years), de Man worked on Holderlin as he later did on Rousseau: as a figure around whom he could organize a thoroughgoing "historical reflection on Romanticism" [AR ix]. The two authors conjoin in fact in "The Image of Rousseau in the Poetry of H6olderlin," republished in The Rhetoric of Romanticism, just as the historical contextualization of what became the Rousseau project before it became Allegories of Reading appears here in the guise of the 1958 paper "Holderlin and the Romantic Tradition." What happened in the course of the Holderlin labor before it was abandoned-"the poetry of H6olderlin, the obvious stumbling block of my enterprise," as he called it later [RR ix] when referring to his inability to combine individual textual readings with historical generalization about romanticism-is multifold. It was one of the avenues along which de Man sloughed off a Heideggerian vocabulary and set of concerns, if not a "method," which he had never shared with Heidegger: one sees this already in the 1955 "Heidegger's Exegeses of Holderlin" and the 1960 "Intentional Structure," and diacritics / winter 1995 43</page><page sequence="6">again here in the third lecture of the Gauss seminar, de Man's most extended and specific critique of Heidegger on a specific Holderlin poem. It is an interpretive engagement that yields three variously comprehensive readings of three poems, "Der Rhein," "Mnemosyne," and now-with this Gauss lecture-"Wie wenn am Feiertage . . ." (previously only touched on in the essay on Heidegger's exegeses), as well as some extended remarks on "Brot und Wein." It finally broke off, I think (based on my understanding of de Man's marginalia in the Cornell University Library's Holderlin edition), with an effort to come to grips with Holderlin's Empedokles project-itself left unfinished by Holderlin-and specifically with the relation between sacrifice and language. De Man, we might say, sacrificed sacrifice-and Holderlin-for language. Be this as it may, when de Man last writes specifically on Holderlin, in "The Riddle of Holderlin" in the New York Review of Books in 1970, it is the tropological character of the term Rdtsel (enigma, riddle) in the poem "Der Rhein" that he highlights, something conspicuously absent not only from his earlier and comprehensive treatment of that poem but from all his earlier discussions of Holderlin with the possible exception of the treatment of metaphor in "Intentional Structure." But after 1970, for whatever reasons, de Man did not really work again on Holderlin, and his contribution to understanding Holderlin has not made much of a mark on professional scholarship. Wordsworth, however, is an entirely different situation. In two of the papers of Romanticism and Contemporary Criticism-the fourth lecture of the Gauss seminar, "Time and History in Wordsworth," and a 1965 MLA panel paper, "Heaven and Earth in Wordsworth and H61olderlin"-together with four of the essays published in The Rhetoric of Romanticism, de Man constructed a powerful argument about Wordsworth's poetry. Spanning almost twenty years, these readings also, not unexpectedly, spanned de Man's own critical vocabularies and projects. In the "Heaven and Earth" piece, the critical language is of authenticity, temporality, consciousness, and Being: When the poetic language is authentic, it becomes essentially temporal.... The contact between heaven and earth occurs literally as a spot of time, authentic time disrupting for an instant the false texture of everyday existence.... [T]he contact occurs as an act of consciousness and not as a natural sensation.... The mind asserts its priority over nature while at the same time asserting its unbreachable separation from Being. [145-46] This is entirely representative of the critical vocabulary and concerns of the Gauss seminar, and it makes all the more remarkable the revision that will be represented, one year later, by "The Rhetoric of Temporality," which in addition to introducing the explicit argumentation about the key rhetorical structures of allegory and irony, and expunging the vocabulary of Being, declares that knowledge of inauthenticity is not itself a purchase upon authenticity. By the time of "Wordsworth and the Victorians," another MLA panel talk from, I believe, the late 1970s, de Man speaks critically of the twentieth-century's versions of Wordsworth as "a poet of the self-reflecting consciousness," skeptically of the moments in Wordsworth's oeuvre ("some of the flattest lines of which the English language is capable") when "the triumph of consciousness over its ever-threatening undoing is entire," and tongue-in-cheek of "the best contemporary criticism [that] has been able to convey the resilience of the Wordsworthian sublime as a power of pure mind" [RR 86-87]. With this rejection of a vocabulary and argumentation of consciousness and mind, we can recognize also where de Man has arrived. In this piece as well as in the roughly contemporary "Autobiography As De-Facement," Wordsworth provides de Man with the language and theory of prosopopeia-the giving and taking of face, in order then to posit and to "de-face" or disfigure voice, self, and narrative and theme-and inspires 44</page><page sequence="7">some famous lines: "Wordsworth [is] a poet of sheer language" [RR 92] and "Death is a displaced name for a linguistic predicament" [RR 81]. This considerable shift in terms and concerns-from "contact between heaven and earth" to "de-facement," from "pure mind" (or consciousness) to "sheer language"- marks the great distance that de Man and Wordsworth may be said to have taken one another. It is nonetheless traversed via a surprisingly common set of textual passages: when reading Wordsworth, de Man reread. To be sure, he wrote on several Wordsworth sonnets, and in "Wordsworth and the Victorians" he writes briefly but densely on the "Bless'd Babe" passage of book 2 of The Prelude ("It can be considered Wordsworth's essay on the origins of language as poetic language" [RR 90]). But otherwise de Man works and reworks much the same passages in Wordsworth: the 1815 preface to Lyrical Ballads, the Essays upon Epitaphs, the famous Simplon Pass and Imagination passages in book 6 of The Prelude, and the Boy of Winander-none more so than the Boy of Winander, which he discusses in four of his six pieces on Wordsworth and arguably alludes to in the other two. It is to his reading of the Boy of Winander that I now wish to turn. * 8 * De Man is consistent in most of his commentary upon the structure and meaning of Wordsworth's Boy of Winander. (De Man quotes the version from the 1805 Prelude, book 5, lines 389 ff., which I forgo quoting given its wide familiarity.) In the broad outlines of his interpretation, he follows Geoffrey Hartman and his Wordsworth's Poetry, 1787-1814. Hartman got there first, as it were, in giving an introductory interpretation of the Boy of Winander that guides much of the argument of the whole book (and also in introducing the word precarious to the discussion of the poem, a word de Man conspicu- ously adopts [see WP 19-22]) and functions for de Man as his "contemporary critic" in the Gauss seminar and elsewhere more ambivalently as his guide and stray. In Hartman's account, the boy engaged in an analogical or correspondential relationship with nature, figured in the "mimic hootings" he and some owls supposedly exchanged. There is an inburst of imagination ("Then sometimes, in that silence, while he hung / Listening, a gentle shock of mild surprize" [406-07]), the boy dies on the threshold of this higher consciousness, and the older Wordsworthian-narrative "I" looks back upon this life and death of a former self. De Man, however, gives subtly differing versions of this summary plot of the poem, and they bear looking at in chronological order. In the 1965 "Heaven and Earth" talk, he writes: The scene of the boy surprised by the sudden silence is in fact a prefiguration of his death, the growth of a consciousness from the assumed safety of an analogical world to the precarious world in which consciousness sees itself suspended ephemerally upon an earth in whose stability it does not share, hung from a heaven that has cast it out. The best it can hope for is that, by fully understanding the contingency of its condition, the fall into death will be as gentle as that of the "uncertain Heaven, received / Into the bosom of the steady Lake. " The poetic language capable of stating, in the ode that honors the very place of our contingency, the frailty of our condition is the true language of the imagination; this language is opposed to the sensory and mimetic language of organistic analogy. [143] This interpretive passage contains several striking claims on de Man's part, claims that will become all the more remarkable in the light of the subsequent versions of the same diacritics / winter 1995 45</page><page sequence="8">interpretation. The movement from imaginative "surprize" to death is, in de Man's language, from prefiguration to fulfillment, itself characterized as a "growth of conscious- ness" continuously spanning a movement "from . . . to . . . ," at the end of which "consciousness sees itself' (however suspended), hoping for "full understanding" (albeit of contingency), and the passage's "poetic language"-the "ode" de Man refers to is the second part of the Boy of Winander, beginning "Fair are the woods . .."-is praised as "the true language of the imagination." We notice that, in this interpretation, the loss of false knowledge ("the assumed safety of an analogical world") is answered for, indeed compensated for, by "true language"; that a boy cut off in his youth by death is answered for by the "growth" of a consciousness instead; that uncertainty of reflection (de Man had highlighted "the precarious adjective 'uncertain' that qualifies Heaven" in "that uncertain Heaven, receiv'd / Into the bosom of the steady Lake" [142]) is answered for by the "full understanding" of a fully self-reflective consciousness ("consciousness sees itself'). In the 1966 "Wordsworth and Holderlin" (originally in German as de Man's inaugural lecture as Professor of Comparative Literature at the University of Zurich), another version of the understanding of the same passage is tellingly similar in its language yet slightly inflected in its claims: There is a hidden but indubitable connection between the loss of the sense of correspondence and the experience of death. The boy's surprise at standing perplexed before the sudden silence of nature was an anticipatory announce- ment of his death, a movement of his consciousness passing beyond the deceptive constancy of a world of correspondences into a world in which our mind knows itself to be in an endlessly precarious state of suspension: above an earth, the stability of which it cannot participate in, and beneath a heaven that has rejected it. The only hope is that the precariousness will be fully and wholly understood through the mediation of poetic language, and that thereby the fall into death will be every bit as gentle as that of the "uncertain Heaven, receiv'd / Into the bosom of the steady Lake." [RR 53-54] The slight alteration from "prefiguration of his death" to "anticipatory announcement of his death" may be insignificant, no more than a translation effect from de Man's earlier English version, to a German version, to a back-translation into English,2 while the retention-indeed, the repetition-of the word "precarious" in this part of de Man's interpretation leads to a more important difference in his emerging argument when he comes to generalize about similar passages in Wordsworth's Prelude: The contrast between the two worlds is always the same: a lively, pleasurably entertaining but destructive world strikes up against a reflective and silent world that stands nearer to an authentic understanding of our situation, the threatened beauty of which, however, is necessarily brittle. The essential moment above all other poetic moments is that of the transition from one world to the other. The poet's language takes its impetus from this meeting place: it illuminates this midpoint from which it glimpses its inauthentic past in the light of the precarious knowledge of its future. [RR 55] 2. I confess to a slight sense of ventriloquism here where I quote de Man's English in "Wordsworth and H6olderlin" in my own translation, as it was commissioned by Columbia University Press for The Rhetoric of Romanticism and approved by de Man. I did not have access to "Time and History in Wordsworth, " first published in Diacritics (1987), when I was translating "Wordsworth and Holderlin." 46</page><page sequence="9">The hoped-for full and whole understanding, "through the mediation of poetic language," of what has repeatedly been called "precarious" is no longer, on some far side of a transition, "the true language of the imagination," but at best a reflection of a stance "nearer to an authentic understanding," hovering or hanging between an "inauthentic past" and that past seen in the light of a further, redoubled precariousness: "the precarious knowledge of its future." De Man is moving toward two consequences with these slight alterations. One is that of casting off claims of "true" or "authentic" knowledge, understanding, or language; this movement will reach an acme in "The Rhetoric of Temporality," with the denial that knowledge of inauthenticity is itself authentic. The other is the explicit foregrounding of the temporality of relations in the Boy of Winander passage and elsewhere in Wordsworth. In the "Heaven and Earth" paper-itself a spatial construction, albeit borrowed from a phrase of Hartman's [WP 69]-it was only toward its end that the point of temporality came to the fore ("When the poetic language is authentic, it becomes essentially temporal," quoted earlier). In "Wordsworth and H6olderlin," de Man comes to restate in terms of history the relation he has just explained as one of a precarious future to an inauthentic past. Of Wordsworth, he writes that "The future is present in history only as the remembering of a failed project that has become a menace" [RR 59]. Of both Wordsworth and Holderlin, he writes: This temporal doubling of the act and its interpretation, which Holderlin symbolizes through the double image of the poet, Wordsworth through the gap that separates the completion of an action from its understanding-this separa- tion discloses a general structure of poetic temporality: it lends duration to a past that otherwise would immediately sink into the nonbeing of a future that withdraws itselffrom consciousness. It is thus an act through which a memory threatened with its own loss succeeds in sustaining itself. [RR 64] There is both a slight tone of the celebratory here (the "success" of memory via poetry) and a slightly higher degree of a claim to knowledge on the interpreter's part: "a general structure of poetic temporality." But with the publication of the Gauss seminar paper on Wordsworth, we have the occasion for our own confrontations with the questions of retrospection and reflection, based both on our knowledge of where de Man's critical and theoretical knowlege led him and on our access to his longest and fullest reading of the Boy of Winander. The title of the lecture takes up where "Wordsworth and Holderlin" left off, linking temporality and history. Its language is similar, sometimes identical to the English of "Heaven and Earth" ("precarious" three times, for example). But in addition to several added details, de Man gives here a much fuller account of the temporality of the poem's structure-that is, of the temporal relation of its second part to its first. It is worth quoting in two sections: The structure of the poem, although it seems retrospective, is in fact proleptic. In the second part, Wordsworth is reflecting on his own death, which lies, of course, in the future and can only be anticipated.... Wordsworth is thus anticipating a future event as if it existed in the past. Seeming to be remembering, to be moving to a past, he is in fact anticipating a future. The objectification of the past self, as that of a consciousness that unwittingly experiences an anticipation of its own death, allows him to reflect on an event that is, in fact, unimaginable. For this is the real terror of death, that it lies truly beyond the reach of reflection. Yet the poem names the moment of death in a reflective mood, and it is this reflective mood that makes it possible to transform what would diacritics / winter 1995 47</page><page sequence="10">otherwise be an experience of terror into the relative appeasement of the lines, "... that uncertain Heaven, receiv'd / Into the bosom of the steady Lake." [81- 82] What is striking here is that de Man partially transforms his analysis of the two sections of the poem's first part-the first (the exchange with the owls) was said to represent the false analogical or correspondential relation of a mind to nature; the second ("Then sometimes, in that silence..."), the truer or more authentic language of the imagination- into an account of a double reading of the entire poem's two parts in terms of the falsity or truth of its temporal constructions. The presentation by the poem's narrative of a boy's past death followed by a past reflection upon it-"the structure of the poem . . . seems retrospective"-is a falsification of the true, and nonnarrative, intimation in the poem's prolepsis of one's own death, "unimaginable" and "beyond the reach of reflection." The poem's "as if" of "seeming to be remembering"-its narrative structure and thematic representation-is counterposed to the "in fact" of the "unimaginable," the "truly" of "the real terror" of death, a factuality and truth behind a guise. Via a fivefold repetition of terms of the reflective-to which I shall return-this sharp contrast of aesthetic semblance that is factitious and contrived, and factual unimaginability that is truly terrible, is nonetheless, with the adversative turn of a "Yet," transformed into what he calls the "relative appeasement" of the last lines before the break between the poem's two parts. In the immediately following section of de Man's reinterpretation of the Boy of Winander with respect to its conflicting constructions of temporality, and through an equivalent redeployment of terms of reflection, he returns the issue of the temporality of the poem's two parts to the question that had already arisen in his earlier lectures on the same poem: the question of the language of the poem itself. Another way of putting it is that what Wordsworth strives to conquer, on the relentless fall into death, is the time, the surmise that would allow one to reflect upon the event that, of all events, is most worth reflecting upon but hardest to face. This time is conquered at the end of the poem, in the curiously exact full half-hour that becomes available to him, a purely meditative time proportionate to the time it takes us to understand meditatively Wordsworth's own poem. But the strategy that allows for this conquest is temporally complex: it demands the description of a future experience by means of the fiction of a past experience which is itself anticipatory or prefigurative. Since it is a fiction, it can only exist in the form of a language, since it is by means of language that the fiction can be objectified and made to act as a living person. The reflection is not separable from the language that describes it, and the half-hour of the end also clocks the time during which Wordsworth, or ourselves, are in real contact with the poem. [82] Despite-but also precisely via-the preposterous claim that the "full half-hour" depicted in the poem is "proportionate" to our time of "meditative understanding" (who's counting? and by what measure, or "portion"?), what de Man is doing here is both powerful and clear. The false/true, semblance/fact distinction that we have now twice seen in his interpretation (analogical vs. imaginative, and "as if" of "seeming to be remembering" vs. "in fact" of anticipation) reappears and is resolved between the fiction in Wordsworth's poem (its second part, the "full half-hour"), now existing as represen- tational poetic language ("made to act as a living person"), and the "real contact" of our- de Man's-reading of that language. What is false, mere aesthetic-seeming or "as if," fiction is the entire temporal complexity of the poem-"the description of a future experience [Wordsworth at the boy's graveside] by means of the fiction of a past 48</page><page sequence="11">experience [Wordsworth's "unimaginable" death imaged or rendered fictional in the boy's death] which is itself anticipatory or prefigurative [of Wordsworth's real death]"- now transformed, indeed reflected, as "inseparable from the language that describes it" and inseparable from the "real contact" with this language. The real-formerly the "true," the "more authentic"-may here be called reading. If this were all de Man had achieved in his third version of his interpretation of the Boy of Winander, it would be eloquent, tricky, and considerably deluded at once, and altogether of a piece with the vocabulary of truth that runs throughout the papers in this volume (for example, the last line of "The Double Aspect," where "the later poetry of Holderlin and of Mallarme... is for us the road of truth" [163]). But de Man, as represented in this volume, both does one thing more with the Boy of Winander and fails to do something, and in these two steps-one taken, one not-we are able to trace at once the limits of his reading of the poem, and the way back from his work in Romanticism and Contemporary Criticism to his lingering, hanging interpretive and theoretical legacy. Thanks to the meticulous editing of this lecture from the Gauss seminar, we have in Romanticism and Contemporary Criticism the publication as well of some interpolations de Man added when he gave the lecture again in 1971 or 1972. The passage relevant for my discussion apparently came at the end of the paragraph from which I last quoted, and appears in the published volume at note 8 to the chapter. De Man has recharacterized the "anticipation" of one's death with its rhetorical name prolepsis, and the substitution of the third-person "boy" for the first-person Wordsworthian "I" as an impossible metaphorical one. The interpolation then continues: A pseudometaphorical and thematically inconceivable substitution of persons leads to a temporal reversal in which anteriority and posteriority are inverted. The structural mechanics of metaphor (for, I repeat, the substitution of the dead he for the living I is thematically, literally, "unimaginable" and the metaphor is not a metaphor since it has no proper meaning, no sens propre, but only a metaphorical structure within the sign and devoid of meaning)-the structural mechanics of metaphor lead to the metonymic reversal of past and present that rhetoricians call metalepsis. The prolepsis of the Winander boy, a thematic concept-for we all know that we can proleptically anticipate empirical events, but not our death, which is not for us an empirical event-is in fact metalepsis, a leap outside thematic reality into the rhetorical fiction of the sign. This leap cannot be represented, nor can it be reflected upon within the inwardness of a subject. The reassurance expressed in the poem when the "uncertain" heaven is received in the lake or when the meditative surmise seems to promise the reflective time of the meditation is based on the rhetorical and not on thematic resources of language. It has no value as truth, only as figure. The poem does not reflect on death but on the rhetorical power of language that can make it seem as if we could anticipate the unimaginable. This would also be the point at which we are beginning to "read " the poem, or to "read" Wordsworth according to the definition I gave at the start, namely to reach the point where the thematic turns rhetorical and the rhetorical turns thematic, while revealing that their apparent complicity is in fact hiding rather than revealing meaning. [201-02] A number of de Man's formulations here bear our attention, for they represent extensions, reversals, and overcomings of the interpretive positions he had previously been articulat- ing. The operative fiction that linked the two parts of the Boy of Winander-the boy lives and dies, the Wordsworthian "I" stands by his graveside-is now called "thematically inconceivable," "thematically, literally, 'unimaginable,"' although de Man knows and diacritics / winter 1995 49</page><page sequence="12">concedes that it is rhetorically or figuratively seductive. More importantly, the claim de Man had twice made in the body of the lecture itself-"The structure of the poem, although it seems retrospective, is in fact proleptic"; and "Seeming to be remembering, to be moving to a past, he is in fact anticipating a future" [81]-is here precisely inverted: "The prolepsis of the Winander boy, a thematic concept... is in fact metalepsis, a leap outside thematic reality into the rhetorical fiction of the sign." This is less a contradiction than an extension of the limits of de Man's analysis heretofore. The first discussion had been in terms of the semblance or "fiction" of the poem's narrative structure (boy dies, Wordsworth looks back), and then demystified by de Man in terms of the actual, "factual" consciousness at play: Wordsworth is anticipating what can never be retrospectively known, one's own death. Here, in the interpolation, the entire twofold structure of retrospection-qua-prolepsis is, in de Man's rhetorical analysis, shown to be a nonanalogical pseudometaphor ("only a metaphorical structure within the sign and devoid of meaning") and a wishful prolepsis inverting into its rhetorical other: they "lead to the metonymic reversal of past and present that rhetoricians call metalepsis," which is what allows the poem to end as it does, with "Wordsworth" "looking back." But, de Man insists-and here his interpolation becomes most novel and most difficult-the move to this fiction, "a leap outside thematic reality into the rhetorical fiction of the sign," "cannot be represented, nor can it be reflected upon from within the inwardness of a subject." That is, it cannot be represented in the poem; it is, in fact, the boy's death itself, missing in the poem's narrative representation and marked as missing in the blank space that separates the two parts of the text, exactly as de Man (following Hartman [WP 21]) analyzed "Lucy"'s death occurring in the blank space between the two stanzas of "A slumber did my spirit seal" in his "Rhetoric of Temporality" (this is the dropped line one cannot find or read in the reprinted essay in the second edition of Blindness and Insight). Nor can it be "reflected" as if from "within the inwardness of a subject," such as a Wordsworthian "I" standing gravely and mutely for a "full half-hour" beside a grave. Any of us can see and read, however, that the "leap" can be and is being represented and reflected upon by the analytic language of de Man's rhetorical reading. In other words, where de Man earlier conjoined and conflated the Wordsworthian "I"'s time of meditation and the reader's time of "real contact with the poem" [82], here he explicitly distinguishes them: the one is an empty fiction, "devoid of meaning," only "the rhetorical fiction of the sign," while the other is analytically exact and exacting in its insight. The "reassurance" at the end of the poem's first and second parts "has no value as truth, only as figure." But that is the claim about the "object-language" of de Man's analysis; his own critical or meta-language, which is about the figure without truth, is not implicated in the dilemma-it can preserve for itself an analytically "real contact with the poem." The last sentence of the first paragraph of de Man's interpolation here seems to reconflate the poem's language (the object-language) and his own critical language when it says that "The poem does not reflect on death but on the rhetorical power of language." Either de Man knows but has not shown us how and where the poem reflects on its rhetorical language, or-in a metaphorical substitution or, more correctly, a personifica- tion of his own-he has made the poem pose as and act like a person, like a de Manian persona perhaps, poised over and reflecting upon the transformed shape of itself, from a wishful fiction to the knowledge of "the rhetorical fiction of the sign," "devoid of meaning." This rhetorical power of language, the sentence continued, "can make it seem as if we could anticipate the unimaginable": this had been the accomplishment of the Boy of Winander, attributed to it by de Man in each of his previous interpretations. Admittedly under the guise of "seeming," of the "as if," of "anticipation" rather than actual retrospection, the "unimaginable" has nonetheless been represented in the poem as a precarious moment of understanding, knowledge, or even "real contact." 50</page><page sequence="13"></page><page sequence="14">The slight but important difference between the poem's "reflecting" or representing (as if mirroring) something and its analyst's-de Man's-"reflecting on the rhetorical power of language" is carried over in de Man's interpolation in the slight but marked difference between "reading" and "'reading.'" De Man says that to "'read"' the poem or Wordsworth at just this juncture would be to "reach the point where the thematic turns rhetorical and the rhetorical turns thematic, while revealing that their apparent complicity is in fact hiding rather than revealing meaning." "The thematic turns rhetorical" in de Man's rhetorical or deconstructive reading, whereby one sees how, in the poem, "the rhetorical turns thematic." The text's construction of rhetorical figures enables the thematics of the narrative to function, and thus what was "hiding" meaning (real, true meaning) in the text, namely, this complicity of thematics and rhetoric that generated and allowed a representation of the poem's narrative fiction, is here, in the "'reading,'" "revealed," shown in its truth, which is the truth of the empty, rhetorical fiction. Reading, without de Man's quotes, is believing in the concealment, in the fiction that hides in the thematics, while "reading" is the revealing of the hiding accomplished by the complicity of rhetoric and thematics, and thus of the hidden meaning, which is of this hiding. For all that de Man here, in the interpolation from 1971 or 1972, is performing the kind of rhetorical analysis that he would go on to execute and to teach for the next ten years, by evacuating "in fact"-ness and "truth" from the text in such a way that the factuality and truth-value-the power of "revelation"-of his own, critical-interpretive text is not yet called into question (this would come, in steps, from "The Rhetoric of Temporality" to Allegories of Reading), the language of reflection that permeates all the prior interpretations of the Boy of Winander has not been given up. Indeed, the term is used several times in rejecting a model of subjective or inward reflection upon the problem of the text ("a leap ... into the rhetorical fiction of the sign ... can[not] be reflected upon from within the inwardness of a subject") as well as in the curious claim that the poem "does not reflect on death but on the rhetorical power of language." How is there a reflection on the rhetoric of the poem's language that is also specifically not within any subjective inwardness? I want to propose an answer to this question that will also point out the limit of de Man's rhetorical reading at just this juncture, where one thing is known to be "thematically, literally, 'unimaginable'"' (the fiction of the poem) while another "thing" (the personification of the poem "reflecting on the rhetorical power of language") is all too readily "imaginable" as a figure of de Man's reading of what Wordsworth's grave "I" could not know, namely, his own fictionality. Having earlier, in his "Heaven and Earth" paper, claimed that "When the poetic language is authentic, it becomes essentially temporal .... The contact between heaven and earth occurs literally as a spot of time, authentic time disrupting for an instant the false texture of everyday existence" [145], de Man undoes this assertion at the end of his "Time and History" lecture. The passage is first ascetic in its privation, and then eloquent in its assymptotic return toward achievement: no language could ever name time for what it is; time itself lies beyond language and beyond the reach of imagination .... [T]o name mutability as a principle of order is to come as close as possible to naming the authentic temporal consciousness of the self. The late poem entitled "Mutability " comes as close as possible to being a language that imagines what is, in essence, unimaginable. [94] De Man goes on to quote Wordsworth's sonnet "Mutability," the last line of which is, "Or the unimaginable touch of Time," which also closes de Man's lecture. De Man's own language of the contrast between what Wordsworth's language of "Mutability" "imag- ines" and what is "in essence unimaginable" preserves the knowledge of essence 52</page><page sequence="15">(however colloquially) for his own language. I want to argue now that de Man's knowledge of the "unimaginable" is precisely, but ironically, the point at which his reading of the Boy of Winander halted and hung, suspended precariously between the rhetorical reading it-and his whole method-was becoming and the representational, phenomenal, phenomenological (consciousness-based) reading it still was. This point is one of reflection. As these quotations from de Man's several interpretations of the Boy of Winander show, the terminology of reflection, both by its strategic deployment and by the frequency of its use, is the privileged one in his understanding of the poem. De Man began, in the "Heaven and Earth" paper, by associating "mirrors," from the first preface to Lyrical Ballads (the poet considers "the mind of man as naturally the mirror of the fairest and most interesting properties of nature"), with the "echoes" of the first part of the Boy of Winander, characterizing both as "images of reflection" that are associated with Wordsworthian analogy [141]. In the "Wordsworth and H6olderlin" and "Time and History" papers, reflection has become even more generalized, to include the attitude of the second part of the poem ("a reflective and silent world that stands nearer to an authentic understanding of our situation" [RR 55]) and specifically the posture and mood of the Wordsworthian "I" at the boy's graveside ("Wordsworth is reflecting on his own death" [81]). For de Man, the term reflection comes to color what may be called the entire mental effort or intentionality of consciousness of the poem: The objectification of the past self... allows him to reflect on an event that is, in fact, unimaginable. For this is the real terror of death, that it lies truly beyond the reach of reflection. . . . [W]hat Wordsworth strives to conquer, on the relentless fall into death, is the time, the surmise that would allow one to reflect upon the event that, of all events, is most worth reflecting upon but hardest to face. [81-82] But the term also specifically bleeds from the figure of the Wordsworthian "I" to that of the language of the poem and its reading: "The reflection is not separable from the language that describes it, and the half-hour of the end also clocks the time during which Wordsworth, or ourselves, are in real contact with the poem" [82]. In his deployment of the language of reflection, de Man goes so far as to mimic or reduplicate the poem's own inversion or metalepsis of later and earlier, future and past. If the poem could have Wordsworth looking back ("reflecting") upon what must remain for him prospective, de Man had the second half of the poem, in its reflective mood, determining the decisive moment of the end of the first part: "Yet the poem names the moment of death in a reflective mood, and it is this reflective mood that makes it possible to transform what would otherwise be an experience of terror into the relative appease- ment of the lines,' ... that uncertain Heaven, receiv'd / Into the bosom of the steady Lake'" [82]. As if de Man-or his language-knows that there is an element of bad faith in this metaleptic recharacterization of the two lines in question (for the "reflective mood" of the poem's second part metaleptically grants the possibility of the "relative appeasement" attributed to the lines that end the first part), adding the qualifier "relative" to the claim of "appeasement" vibrates with an undermining recall of his characterizations of the same lines, just four and two pages earlier: "by the time we come to 'uncertain heaven,' we must realize we have entered a precarious world in which the relationship between noun and epithet can be quite surprising" [78] and "the temporal heaven of line 24, 'uncertain' and precarious since it appears in the form of a preconsciousness of death" [80]. What lies behind this metaleptic bleeding of metaphorical reflection-the "reflective mood"-onto the two lines at the end of the first part of the Boy of Winander is a confusion of literal and figurative, for those two lines are, of course, the only literal figure of diacritics / winter 1995 53</page><page sequence="16">reflection in the poem. The "mimic hootings to the silent owls" that become "echoes loud / Redoubled and redoubled," whatever else they might be-human feigning echoed in sonic waves mistaken for owls, or an avian response corresponding to the feint-are not mirrorings or reflection but, rhetorically speaking, exactly what Wordsworth indicates them to be: mimesis. And the Wordsworthian "I" who stands "A full half-hour together ... / Mute-looking at the Grave in which he lies," whatever else he may be doing-fully half and half-full together with death-is not a figure of reflection (except in the pseudometaphorical sense de Man specifies, in which there is no analogical resemblance) but, rhetorically speaking, an ellipsis, because, textually speaking, he is exactly what Wordsworth indicates him to be: "Mute," what de Man later, rightly, called "the key word of the Boy of Winander" ["Autobiography," RR 73]. No, the only instance of a literal figure of reflection in the poem is the two lines that end its first part, and de Man once names them as such, just when he is beginning to recharacterize them not as precarious but as somehow calmed and calming: "the movement is steadied, the fall cushioned, as it were, when the uncertain heaven is received into the lake, when sheer dizziness is changed into reflection" [81]. The apparent exactness of de Man's paraphrase elides the textuality of the lines themselves: "the paraphrase (as paraphrases always do, and the better they are the better they do it...) elides the decisive segment," as de Man puts it in his response to Murray Krieger [186]. De Man has movement "steadied," dizziness "changed into reflection," both in the past tense, which corresponds to the paraphrase that "the uncertain heaven is received into the lake." But only the matching of "the uncertain Heaven" with "the steady Lake" in the "receiv'd" is a past act; this is what constitutes, in the text, the present tense and action, the very movement, that rightly earns the name reflection. When heaven and lake are "changed into reflection," is any movement "steadied," as the migration of the word in de Man's formulation suggests? De Man's extraordinary readings of the Boy of Winander lead to the limit of the imaginable, which is the unimaginable. Yet his talk about "reflection" is predicated upon its imaginable character, that is, that it is visible, phenomenal, like a mirroring or like a pensive man seen standing for a half-hour beside a boy's grave-and, because visible and phenomenal, available either to phenomenological analysis (de Man's rhetoric of con- sciousness as the meaning of the intentional object) and/or aesthetic solace (his rhetoric of "conquered time" in a "meditative understanding" available to us in "real contact with the poem"). De Man, I submit, cannot help but see the lines in question as a "reflection," an image of which they indeed are, but in so seeing them and seeing them only so-as visualizable and phenomenal-he does not read them as the text's point of turning, troping, into the unimaginable, let alone come to "read" them. The lines read, in the 1805 Prelude: and that uncertain Heaven, receiv'd Into the bosom of the steady Lake. [5.412-13] In the original form, in the so-called ms. JJ, now edited (with a facsimile of the manuscript page) as part of the 1798-99 Prelude, the word "receiv'd" is, due to lack of space on the page, jammed back in, as it were, between the two lines: and that uncertain Heaven, receiv'd Into the bosom of the steady Lake. [P 86-87] In either case, "uncertain Heaven" and "steady Lake" are aligned directly above and beneath one another, as if-in a visual, phenomenal image of reflection or mirroring- textually produced in symmetrical parallelism. Each phrase is as if it were the "mirror 54</page><page sequence="17">image" of the other. It is this image, qua a visual version of a textual figure-the phrases and the lines themselves, in their inscription-that de Man imagines and paraphrases as the uncertainty "steadied" when it is "received" and "changed into reflection." What cannot be seen, but can only be read, is that the lines act as and act out a reflection, which is to say a not-steadied movement, in becoming the textual figure-the trope-they inscribe. The unimaginable is that these symmetrical, parallel phrases become asymmetrical and inverted. If the "uncertain Heaven" is "receiv'd" upon the "steady Lake" (forget the visual illusion of "Into the bosom"-pace the "Bless'd Babe" passage, we are talking death, not life, and surface, not depth), the surface of the lake, qua surface of a reflection, becomes uncertain: it receives, hosts, and re-presents the uncer- tainty of the reflected image as much as uncertainty meets steadiness or steadying. The properties of the adjectives, in other words, are exchangeable: steady heaven, uncertain lake. But such "mirroring," while insisting that as much uncertainty attaches to the lake as steadiness attaches to the heaven, still remains both too true and not true enough to the phenomenality of the visual image of "reflection." For if the image is one of mirroring, then there must be inversion, according to the physical principles of optical reflection: in the apparent parallelism, opposite sides (left-right) are inverted. Thus, not only does the uncertain heaven become steady while the steady lake becomes uncertain, but the "uncertain" becomes-in the "reflection"-a "Lake" and the "Heaven" becomes a "steady." To put this as a textual image (but we are, with Wordsworth here, at a temporal spot and thus at the limit of the imaginable): uncertain Heaven, steady Lake. becomes not only steady Heaven, uncertain Lake. but also Lake steady, Heaven uncertain. Which also means that the earth is being "reflected" skyward and, thus, that in addition to the sky falling to uncertainty, the lake is falling up. But this is to speak the non-sense of visualizable forms at a moment where, as in the next book of the Prelude, "the light of sense / Goes out" [6.534-35]. What the visual, phenomenal version of the textual passage as mirroring or reflection yields, via its innate principle of inversion, is the nonvisual, nonphenomenalizable trope of chiasmus. Of course one can, as one often does, construct little diagrams or schemata (as I have just done above) that show the pairings of words inverting their order, but that is to miss the point, which is the tropological touch of a spot of time-the twist of inversion-in a previously spatial and static structure or alignment. Here it occurs at the spot or moment of "receiv'd," which is not to be imagined or imaged as a three- dimensional hugging to a bosom, nor as a two-dimensional laying-down of a reflected image, but as a touch of time that sets a turn or trope into motion. "Receiv'd," in other words, can only be read. Chiasmus, as a textual figure, may be "spotted" visually or schematically, but as a trope it works nonvisually, nonphenomenally, and the very inversion effected by the lines in question is of the visual image of mirroring or reflection as visual inversion into the tropological structure of chiasmus as the inversion of sensuous diacritics / winter 1995 55</page><page sequence="18">(visual, phenomenal) sense into linguistic (tropological, material) sense, a sense not readable as meaning but "readable" (in the sense de Man was pointing toward) as the force of Wordsworth's words' "unimaginable touch," themselves "beyond the reach of com- mon / Indication" [7.606-07]. This sense of Wordsworth's language is not meaning imaginable, but unimaginable meaning. We have seen where de Man got the word "unimaginable" in his paper "Time and History": from the sonnet "Mutability" and its last line, "Or the unimaginable touch of Time." He proleptically-before quoting the poem and its last line-announced that "time itself lies beyond language and beyond the reach of imagination" and that the poem "comes as close as possible to being a language that imagines what is, in essence, unimaginable." After the quotation (retrospectively, that is), de Man had nothing to say, nothing to add; for the only time in his oeuvre that I am aware of, he lets a literary text have the last word (something he later would have his students abjure, calling it an abdication of the task of reading). We know furthermore that he not only could not "read" the last line of "Mutability"-surely he read the poem aloud to his Princeton audience, and he proleptically read it in his introductory comments-but he could not publish under its title and authority. He had planned, we now know from Romanticism and Contemporary Criticism, a book to be titled The Unimaginable Touch of Time, the proleptic table of contents of which included the Gauss seminar, plus "Intentional Structure of the Romantic Image," "The Image of Rousseau in the Poetry of Holderlin," "Wordsworth and Holderlin," "Symbolic Landscape in Wordsworth and Yeats," "The Poetic Itinerary of John Keats" (which surely became his Signet introduction), "The Rhetoric of Temporal- ity," and a chapter on Rousseau and Mme de Stael. All these pieces exist, some in The Rhetoric of Romanticism, one in Allegories of Reading, some elsewhere, some uncol- lected, the rest collected here. But they were not written by Paul de Man as The Unimaginable Touch of Time. We may say that the rest of de Man's work, all his books, as it were, issue from the unwritable sense of the unreadable line "Or the unimaginable touch of Time." What de Man could not read or write about time-and therefore, after the Gauss seminar and the essay "The Rhetoric of Temporality," which is already partially included in it, stopped trying to say-he spent the rest of his career "reading" and writing about tropes. We can only read this, not see it. The phenomenalization of reading, for example, which is what de Man wrote and taught critically about in everything he ever had to say about what came to be known as "reception theory," is what is left behind in and by his initial nonreading of the word "receiv'd" in the submerged but surfacing chiasmus. This imaged trope that de Man could see but not "read," and therefore could only misread as visual reflection or mirroring, is a virtual center to all of his essays on Wordsworth. The "uncertain Heaven receiv'd / Into the bosom of the steady Lake" is the very type of what de Man later characterizes as "passages that are so radically unpredictable, so audacious in the sparseness of their means, that any attempt to link them to the high tradition of English verse is out of order" ["Wordsworth and the Victorians," RR 87]. Their surface materiality, which is the negation of the seductive (because infantile) depth of "Into the bosom," is what he later in the same essay intimates is the sur-face that eludes the prosopopeiac effort to make a face: "The face, which is the power to surface from the sea of infinite distinctions in which we risk to drown, can find no surface. How are we to reconcile the meaning of face, with its promise of sense and of filial preservation, with its function as the relentless undoer of its own claims?" [RR 92]. Our version of this in the Boy of Winander is to want to invert surface into depth, tropological materiality into a semantic steadiness and calm of an un-"read" but fondly visualized reflection or memory. The memory ought not to be an imaged one of the mother's bosom but, as de Man had already put it in the Gauss seminar, "always of death," however unimaginable. And similarly, the reflection is not phenomenal (somewhere in the Lake Country), nor is it 56</page><page sequence="19">historical (having something to do with one William Wordsworth, 1770-1850, living during the French Revolution, etc.), some current trends notwithstanding.3 Rather, when he later was writing about Wordsworth and came upon the topic of reflection, it was no longer visual but specularly reflexive, and the visual image was no longer of watery mirroring, but of Gerard Genette's "whirligig" (tourniquet). This is also a visual image de Man used in teaching about chiasmus; it was, in other words, the image of the trope that had been missing from his earlier seeing of the visual image in the Boy of Winander without reading the unimaginable trope. "Genette's metaphor of the revolving door ... aptly connotes the turning motion of tropes and confirms that the specular moment is not primarily a situation or an event that can be located in a history, but that it is the manifestation, on the level of the referent, of a linguistic structure" ["Autobiography,"RR 70-71]. Another manifestation of "the specular moment," in the Boy of Winander, is precisely the unimaged touch, spot, space, or blank of the death-of the boy, his senses, and his sense-which is another manifestation of and name for a linguistic structure, "a displaced name for a linguistic predicament." There is an almost irresistible, unimaginably tempting urge to read de Man's complete work temporally: proleptically toward positions he would later espouse, retrospectively to their adumbration in the very limitations he sketched. This would be both to fall back behind the advances his work took and the terms it abandoned and to confirm his teaching about the response that would seek completion on the far side of death: "the restoration of mortality by autobiography (the prosopopeia of the voice and the name) deprives and disfigures to the precise extent that it restores" ["Autobiography," RR 81]. There is no (auto)biography to be constructed or read out of de Man's work, least of all by anyone else. De Man gave to read, and what he gave to read was not only all that he wrote, but, we now can read, what he didn't write-about unimaginability, about muteness, about chiasmus in Wordsworth's Boy of Winander. There is nothing to be seen in this marking of what he didn't write. What is to be read, however, is how much he revealed at the limit where he himself no longer saw, imagined, or wrote.
