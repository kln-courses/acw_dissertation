<plain_text><page sequence="1">Antoine-Augustin Renouard's Collection of Affiches de Librairie Chris Michaelides A collection of some 300 posters in the British Li- brary has hitherto remained unexplored.1 Bound in three hefty guard books, all except two of the posters are affiches de librairie , literally 'bookshop posters' - bills announcing new publications either in volume or in in- stalments (ι livraisons ) and dating from the 1820s to the early 1850s.2 This was a crucial period in the develop- ment of this type of poster, in which the image became increasingly prominent and the interplay between word and image (usually a lithograph) reached great heights of flair and ingenuity. Most of the prominent illustra- tors of the first half of the century are represented and the collection gives a vivid picture of publishing trends in Paris, especially during the July Monarchy - the pe- riod of constitutional monarchy under Louis-Philippe which began with the overthrow of the conservative government of Charles X in July 1830 and ended with the Revolution of 1848. The collection was purchased in 1854 at the sale of the library of the French bookseller Antoine- Augustin Renouard (1765-1 853).3 The subject of one of the British Library's Panizzi lectures in 2003, 4 Renouard was the founder of a dynasty of booksellers.

The sale of his library in November 1854 was one of the great book sales of the century. Renouard had compiled a cata- logue of his collection in 1853, shortly before his death.6 The sale catalogue itself, published a few months later, comprised the 3,604 entries of the earlier catalogue and a supplement, bringing the total to 3,700 lots. The two entries for our collection, nos. 3,427 and 3,428, are as follows: Ά large collection of illustrated prospectuses, published since about 1840 ...

The first is for the 181 1 edition of La Fontaine's Fables, illustrated with relief engravings on stone by Jean-Louis Duplat (1757-1833)8 (fig. 249). In his preface Renouard praises Duplat's in- vention and announces further titles: Florian's Fables , Goldsmith's The Vicar of Wakefield and Sterne's A Senti- mental Journey? His enthusiasm for Duplat's illustrations also explains the reproduction of 24 of them on the poster, which served moreover as a demonstration that the plates were strong enough to withstand repeated usage without deteriorating.10 After publishing Florian's Fables in 1812, Renouard came to accept that Duplat's experiment was a failure and he never published the rest of the engravings.11 Nevertheless, he kept the stones, and the second poster has examples of Duplat's engravings for all the projected publications (including fourteen from La Fontaine, different from those on the 8.

The date of this poster is not known but it was printed by Paul Renouard, who started his printing business in 1824. Also in 1824, A. A. Renouard retired and the fam- ily's bookselling and publishing activities were taken over by his son Jules, who moved the concern from rue St André des Arcs (now Saint André des Arts) to rue de Tournon, close to his brother's printing shop in rue Garancière. The collection includes several posters ad- vertising the publications of Jules Renouard. Among them are posters for Babel , of 1840 - a collection of writings by the recently formed Société des gens de let- tres; a Guide pittoresque de l'étranger dans Paris et ses environs , first published in 1843 and reissued in 1848 with a 're- publican supplement'; and a poster-prospectus for one of his most ambitious undertakings, Charles Blanc's Histoire des pàntres de toutes les Écoles. The publication of Blanc's monumental work began in 1849 and was com- pleted 27 years later, still under the Renouard imprint, although long after Jules Renouard's death in 1854. The inclusion of seven German posters in the collection may be due to Jules's business interests in Germany. One of the earliest, and rarest, posters in the collec- tion is that for the French translation of the works of Sir Walter Scott, with a lithograph by Charles-Etienne Motte after Achille Devéria (fig. 250). This was pub- lished in 1829, the year after the first use of a lithograph to illustrate an affiche de librairie , also produced by Motte and Devéria, for the Goethe/Delacroix Faust.12 The varied formats of the posters reflect the differ- ent purposes for which they were produced. Some functioned as prospectuses, others were displayed in bookshop windows and the largest were glued on walls, Morris columns not appearing on Paris streets until later. Sizes range from 590 by 400 mm to 1120 by 750 mm. The lettering of the poster sometimes indicates where it should be displayed ('Cette affiche ne peut être placardée qu'à l'intérieur' - 'This poster can only be posted indoors'), or contains indications as to where the publication can be found ('Dans tous les cabinets de lecture' - 'In all reading rooms"3) or purchased ('On souscrit ici' - 'you can subscribe here'; 'En vente chez tous les libraires' - 'on sale in all booksellers'). The price is also given together with the different options avail- able, as a single volume or in instalments, the latter making it more affordable. In one case (for the Œuvres complètes de Balzac) the publisher seems to have achieved the impossible - a cheap luxury edition, the 'Édition de luxe et à bon marché'. Many posters are in black and white, although the smaller formats are usually printed in red and black or blue and gold. Posters for almanacs tend to be in red and blue and are sometimes hand-coloured. Yellow (or, very rarely, orange) paper is occasionally used, espe- cially for popular works. lithography is the most com- mon technique, sometimes enhanced by examples of the book's original wood- or steel-engravings stuck onto the poster. The subject-matter of the posters includes editions of works by earlier writers popular during the Roman- tic period - Ariosto, Tasso, Shakespeare, Cervantes, but not Corneille or Racine - as well as those of contem- porary writers like Balzac, Dumas and Gautier, al- though Victor Hugo is curiously absent. Eugène Sue was one of the most popular writers of the period, and there are posters for his enormously successful romans feuilletons (serialized novels), Les Mystères de Paris (1842- 43) and Le Juif enant (1844-45), both with lithographs after Gavarni, and also for his less well-known Mathilde : mémoires d'une jeune femme (1841-42), with a lithograph after Bertall. Numerous posters advertise seasonal pub- lications like étrennes (gifts for the New Year) and a wide variety of almanacs: comic, prophetic, military, social- ist, culinary, and for children or 'dames et demoiselles'. One for an ' Almanach des mâchoires pour 1851 ' (Almanac of Jaws for 1851) by William Rogers, a dentist, pro- claimed that the publication offers Ά means of telling the character of the passions and the fortune of people from the arrangement and shape of their teeth', besides discussing 'White, blue, red, diplomatic, parliamentary, literary, property-owning, religious, and amorous jaws'.14 The legend of Napoleon is also a favourite subject. The return of Napoleon's remains from the island of St Helena to France and their burial in the Hôtel des Invalides in 1840 was the climax of the Napoleonic 12.

'Cabinets de lecture' were rental libraries which, for a small fee, offered their customers a variety of books, periodicals and newpapers, which they could read in relative comfort. The ad- vent of the mass-produced book and cheap popular press in the second half of the century led to their decline and eventual dis- appearance. See H. E.

They include the cheaply printed Physiologies {Physiologie du Grand Papa , Physiologie du théâtre) and vast panoramic texts like Le Livre des Cent-et-Un (1831-34), La Grande Ville : nouveau tableau de Paris , comique , critique, et philosophique (1842-43), and Les Étrangers à Paris, of 1846. Draughtsmen and caricaturists of the July Monarchy are richly represented: Tonyjohannot, Cham, Charlet, Raffet, and Traviès all appear and there are several Gavarni posters, including Le Diable à Paris : Paris et les Parisiens and Œuvres choisies de Gavarni : études de mœurs con- temporaines , both of 1845. Best of all is an impressive group of posters with lithographs after Grandville, com- prising most of the books he illustrated in the 1840s.16 There are two posters for Scènes de la vie privée et publique des animaux: Les animaux peints par eux-mêmes et dessinés par un autre , of 1842, one of Grandville's witty commentaries on contemporary society, using anthropomorphic ani- mals to portray thinly disguised leading figures and so- cial types. Also being parodied was Les Français peints par eux-mêmes (1840-42) from Cur mer, a rival of Pierre Jules Hetzel, Grandville's publisher. Grandville's images dominate the text; it was said that 'pendant que Grandville crayonnait, le texte s'inscrivait' ('while Grandville sketched, the text wrote itself) and the poster seems to demonstrate this fanciful claim.17 There are two impressions of it in the collection, one printed in black and white, the other in pink, gold, and green (fig. 252). 18 The examples of ' l'affiche dans un grand développement referred to in the 1854 sale catalogue entry are the group of large-format (1,120 by 750 mm) colour posters printed by Jean- Alexis Rouchon (1794-1878) in a pio- neering technique derived from wallpaper manufactur- ing, which he called 'Imprimerie Omnicolore'. His posters, printed on rough-textured grey or beige sugar paper, typically use three of four rich colours and their images are sometimes borrowed from other posters; the one for Eugène Sue's Le Juif mant (fig. 253) derives from the lithograph after Gavarni originally published by Lemercier. The life and output of Rouchon are not well known but the catalogue of the exhibition of his work at the Bibliothèque Nationale in 1983 listed 144 posters and, usefully for their dating, established that until 1847 his address was 87, rue de la Verrerie, and subsequently 22, rue Saint Denis.19 His posters began to appear in the 1840s and their production seems to have continued until 1866. In that year Jules Chéret, regarded as Rou- chon's successor, returned to France from England and established his colour lithographic shop in Paris, which ushered in a new era in the production of the colour poster and the affiche de librairie. 16.
