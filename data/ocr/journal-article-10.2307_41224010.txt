It also addresses the close connection between conceptions of topography in Omani culture and the articulation of thresholds, both sacred and domestic. The paper argues that an attempt to connect the celestial and physical topographic conceptions that is at the heart of the complex water distribution strategy of the aflãj irrigation system also prevails in the mihrãb. The Ibadï artisan of Oman integrated representations of both continuous and instantaneous time employing the endless knot and stellar motifs. Emphasizing the sacred nature of time and light as divine attributes or essence of God, the mihrãb sought to represent a celestial topography, which was made possible through Ibadï analogical interpretations of anthropomorphism in the QurDan and an expanding influence of mysticism amongst Omani scholars. Omani mihrãb and door decoration shows a close affinity between stellar and date-palm representations, the latter also held in sacred esteem in Oman. The aflãj irrigation system once depended significantly on the position of stars in the night sky to ensure the distribution of water. The interchangeable representation suggests a conflation of the terrestrial topography of the oasis and the celestial topography. The horizon mediated this relationship, acting as a threshold through which the celestial bodies had to pass to be meaningfully associated with the terrestrial topography. Appearing as woven tapestries or bounded spatial representations, both the mihrãb and the Omani doorway decoration mark a threshold in the sacred and secular passage. Keywords: mihrab, Oman, Ibadi, topography, threshold Introduction This paper aims to discuss two key themes persistent within the decorative tradition of Omani architecture, stars and date palms. It is an attempt to understand the role and overlapping meaning of these motifs within the traditional architectural context by focusing on the decorated prayer niches (mahãrib) of central Oman. The sudden appearance in 1252 of such a decorative mihrãb tradition in Sacäl, Nizwah, its disappearance immediately thereafter, and its subsequent equally surprising revival in Manah in the early sixteenth century, unique in many respects in the Arabian Peninsula, raises many questions, especially in view of the prevalent Ibâçlï ideals of asceticism, for they strove for simplicity and austerity in their mosques. The paper attempts to connect the celestial and physical topographic conceptions that are at the heart of the complex water distribution strategy of the aflãj irrigation system with those that prevail in the mihrãb. The paper also aims to study the close connection between these topographic conceptions and the articulation of thresholds - both sacred and domestic. Likely influences The sudden appearance of these motifs could suggest the importation of foreign artisans who delivered the first mihrãb in its finished and highly developed form under local Omani patronage, or it could well be that all previous attempts to refine the motifs were lost during the period of extreme turmoil that characterized central Oman in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.1 Kervran has suggested that the sixteenth-century Omani artisans were employing "out-of-date" Saljuq and Mongol Iranian models of the tenth to fourteenth centuries (1996: 109), making the influence contemporaneous with thirteenth- century Sacal. It is likely that the first mihrãb at Sacal was a result of patronage of the Nabähinah rulers of central Oman, who were well established in Nizwah during its 1 J.C. Wilkinson (1987) has discussed the chaos and political complex- ity that prevailed in central Oman from the thirteenth until the fifteenth centuries, as Ibâçlï imamate power collapsed and the Nabähinah and various local rulers vied for control over Omani towns and villages. The Ibaçlï historians have tended to describe this interregnum of 250 years as the "dark age" of Omani history.</page><page sequence="2">1 00 Soumyen Bandyopadhyay execution (Bandyopadhyay 2008). As vassals under the Buyid occupying forces in the Suhârî hinterland, it is people from the early Nabãhinah period who appear to have first come into contact with the Persian tradition of mihrãb decoration, exemplified by al-MuqaddasT's description of the striking metal polychrome faïence lustre decoration in Suhär's grand mosque (Kervran 1996: 112). Kanacan, on the other hand, has suggested a possible Yemeni Sulayhid (1038-1138) and Rasulid (1229- 1454) influence, especially on the Sacãl mihrãb and the intrusion of Fatimid ShPT and Ayyubid artistic traditions by proxy (Kanacan 2008). While both claims require further careful examination and substantiation,2 these nevertheless suggest a wider ShPT influence in the region to which the al-Däkhiliyyah and al-Sharqiyyah regions of Oman were subjected. Given the nature of Ibaçlï theological traditions that prevailed, it is probable that the ShFï influence remained largely limited to a formal and aesthetic one, although it is difficult to accept a complete divorce between theological trajectories and their artistic manifestations. The later attempts at concealing (by painting over in green), damaging, or even removing early sixteenth-century ceramic bowl insertions suggest at least an implicit understanding among Ibâçlïs of what these artistic moves might have connoted. Broadly following the foreign schema, the Omani artisans conflated expressive and representative aspects of indigenous agricultural traditions at hand. Two important factors could have contributed to the acceptance of this unique art form into the Omani mosque in the mid-thirteenth century. The first factor was the theological debate concerning the allegation of dynastic succession of the Yahmad tribe to the office of the imam. This debate split the Ibaçlï community in Oman into an extremist "Rustãq School" of ascetic Qulamã' opposed by a moderate "Nizwah School", characterized by flexibility and pragmatism. The "Nizwah School" received support from the early Nabãhinah umarã3 (sg. amir) or muluk (sg. malik) of Nizwah, who were busy establishing themselves 2 Largely due to the Ibâçlï historians' depiction of Nabãhinah rulers as tyrants and characterization of the period as the "dark ages" of Omani history, much of Nabãhinah history and its details still remains unclear. The evidence of the influence of Hamrami and Yemeni theological and architectural thoughts on Omani Ibaçlïs during the period in question is equally difficult to ascertain (Hoffman, personal communication, 2005). Hoffman, however, noted that the modern Ibâçlïs and ShãfHs in Zanzi- bar intermingled, the latter with strong links to Haçlramawt. She also found a nineteenth-century Ibãtfí scholar's commentary on a poem by an important Sufi Sayyid of the Haçlramawt. politically, and in opposition to the Yahmadï dominance of the ¡marnate (Bandyopadhyay 2008: 374). The second factor was the development of mystical traditions in Islam from the mid-ninth century onwards and their subsequent rapid extension across Arabia and Persia in the eleventh and twelfth centuries following al-Junayd's (830-910) development of a new language of "sobriety" (sahw) to describe mystical experience, which eventually made such traditions acceptable to the puritanical ascetics and traditionalists (Melchert 1996: 66-70).3 Celestial imagery became associated with the appearance of the Kacbah, especially in the mystical poetry of the Arabs and the Persians from the tenth century onwards, where the Kacbah was often treated as a female or a bride surrounded by her companions, the days and nights, and the stars and the planets (Beelaert 1988-1989).4 For example, Beelaert, quoting Burton, cites the eleventh-century minor Arab poet, cAbd al- Rahïm al-Buraì: "And Meccah's bride (i.e. the Kacabah) is displayed with (miraculous) signs" (1988-1989: 109). This mystical poetic strand appears to persist into the early thirteenth-century Arabic poetry concerned with pilgrimage to Mecca. Ibn Jubayr (1145-1217) in his Rihlah makes allusions not only to the idea of the Kacbah being a bride but the Black Stone being a beloved with attractive sensual properties (1988-1989: 109). That the medieval Omani Ibaçlïs might have been influenced by such mystical thoughts, could be suggested as a possibility from parallel influences among contemporary Maghribi Ibaçlï scholars (Hoffman, personal communication, 2005) 3 As Hoffman mentions, "the type of Sufism that appeals most to the Omani Ibàçlïs is that of al-Junayd, cAbd al-Qädir al-JTlanï [1077/8- 1166], and al-Ghazâlï [1058-1111], but they also read and enjoy Ibn al-Fãri&lt;J's [1181-1235] poetry" (Hoffinan, personal communication, 2005). 4 Beelaert (1988-1989: 112) cites a qasida from the Persian poet Khaqanï Shirwanï (1 127-1 199) in this regard: The Kacbah is the queen of the two worlds, see how for her in this green tent/ the seven women came as chambermaids. Morning and evening are two slaves for her, named "Pearl" and "Am- ber"/ Although they came as commanding officers, this one from Abyssinia, that one from Byzantium. Her slaves are her Atabegs for her two children/ for one of these children the cradle is Babylon, for the other the cradle is Khurasan. The musk-coloured mole on the wheat-coloured face of the Arabian queen/ grants the lovers their desires and conquers their hearts. He interprets "the seven women came as chambermaids" as the seven planets and "her two children" as the moon and the sun (Beelaert 1988- 1989: 122;nn.29&amp;30).</page><page sequence="3">Conflation of celestial and physical topographies in the Ontani decorated mihrãb 1 0 1 Figure 1.

Note the missing porcelain bowl inserts and the later application of green paint. and more overt mystical leanings among modern Ibaçlï scholars from the eighteenth century onwards (Hoffman 2004), which I discuss later. The Omani decorated mihrãb While the characteristics of the decorated mahãrlb of central Oman (Fig. 1) have been discussed elsewhere in some detail (e.g. Baldissira 1994; Kervran 1996; Bandyopadhyay 1998; Costa 2001; Kanacan 2008), the main features could be summarized here from the earliest examples from Sacãl in Nizwah (mid-thirteenth century) and those thereafter from Manah (early sixteenth century). Just over two and a half centuries separate the first example at Nizwah (Friday Mosque [masjid al- jãmi% Sacãl) and the next at Manah (masjid al-cAlï). The other three decorated maharïb of Manah, in al-cAyn, al- Shärah, and al-Manhiyyah mosques, appeared in close succession. The decorated mahãrib are rectangular in their overall form; from the first to the second, the height had increased and the width had reduced so that the width to height ratio moved from roughly 1:1 to 1:1.6. However, the overall compositional schema and the major decorative elements had remained almost unchanged. The centrepiece, a low-arched niche with a simple shallow alcove (which in the later examples appears heavily scalloped) is supported on two sets of half- columns progressively receding from the surface of the mihrãb. In Sacãl, the inner sets of columns are much shorter in comparison, a difference that seems to have evened out by the time of al-cAlï. It is worth noting that in the mahãrib in the tenth-century Iranian mosque at Nayïn, and the many others that followed, much taller columns were a consistent feature (Pope 1968), calling into question any unmediated importation of the design schema. The niches in al-cAyn and al-cAlï have triple and quadruple recessed arches of diminishing size, with alternate arches corresponding to the columns. However, in al-Sharã3, al-Manhiyyah mosques they are made up of a large central arch flanked by two half arches joining to create a pendentive on either side. The niche arch is surmounted by a decorative arch in a shallow recess with a rosette; the circular medallion at its centre later gave way to a porcelain bowl inset (Fig. 2). While in al-cAlï</page><page sequence="4">1 02 Soumyen Bandyopadhyay Figure 3. Part of the outer band of decoration in Masjid al-cAU, Hãrat al-Bilãd, Manah showing the alternate large and smaller medallions set within an " 'endless knot" motif and al-cAyn the decorative arches were separated by a horizontal band, in the other two cases from Manah the decorative arches were sitting immediately above the niche arch. These arches are surrounded by a rectangular band that appears to be supported by the outer set of columns. In al-cAyn, this band is broken into a narrow band going around the niche and two decorative panels flanking the upper arched recess, terminated by circular impressions. This band is surrounded by a wider band extending all the way down to the ground with impressed or recessed decorations of alternating small and large circles ensconced in a complex closed pattern, all set within intricate foliage motifs (Fig. 3). In al-cAlï and al- Manhiyyah mosques, this outer band is further divided into a wider middle section containing the circular decorations with two narrower bands on either side. The inscriptions on the mihrãb have a standard format: at the top, above the outer band, the Profession of Faith (shahãdah) is inscribed in very bold Kufic script, which in Sacal runs across the qiblah wall. The name of the sponsor(s), the date of construction, the name of the artist (naqqãsh, pl. naqqashun), and other details are inscribed in a much more fluid and interlocking script immediately above the shallow recessed arch over the niche. In al-cAlï, however, these details appear between the two bands, and at Sacal this forms a thin band wrapping around the medallion band. The decoration is in fine gypsum (jiss jamïl), which was either left in its natural state, whitewashed or, as in Manah, painted green, perhaps at a later date. From the sixteenth century onwards (i.e. from al-cAlï), Omani mahãrlb incorporate glazed ceramic bowls, either of Chinese origin or in their Persian imitation. The origin of the term mihrãb The extension of South Arabian presence and cultural influence along the southern and eastern shores of the Arabian Peninsula is now well known (e.g. Wilkinson 1977; Potts 1990; Bhacker &amp; Bhacker 2004). The distinctive formal characteristics of the central Omani mosque suggest a continuation of an older sacred architecture consistent with Serjeant's Haçlramï mosque (Serjeant 1959), which interacted with the more localized culture to incorporate the domical bumah into the schema (Bandyopadhyay 2000; Bandyopadhyay &amp; Sibley 2003). This regional origin of the Omani mosque architecture, largely independent of developments in the northern Islamic heartland, acquires further substantiation as we consider the origin of the term mihrãb. While the use of the term mihrãb denoting the prayer niche is entirely Islamic, the earliest mosques did not contain a mihrãb. In the Qui°an, the word mihrãb is mentioned only five times, but in no instance does it suggest a prayer niche. Quoting Ibn Manzûr's Lisãn al-cArab, Khoury suggests that it might have denoted a range of disparate entities, "The mihrãb is the central-most location of the main room (or residence; bayt), and the most honoured (akramu) area in it ... It is also the elevated chamber (ghurfaT (Khoury 1998: 7). Earlier, Serjeant and Mahmud cAlï Ghul had shown how, during the time of the Prophet and in early Arabic commentary, it variously meant, "a covered place where the people sat", a chamber (ghurfah), and the highest or most prominent place, probably derived from southern Arabia, where it appears in South Arabian inscriptions on at least two occasions, and meant "a row of columns</page><page sequence="5">Conflation of celestial and physical topographies in the Omani decorated mihrãb 103 with intervening space . . . erected upon a plinth or a courtyard" (Serjeant 1959: 450). In a slightly derivative sense of a covered portico supported by columns, it was still in use in the mosques of Hatframawt (mahãrlb) and had precedents in the pre-Islamic temples in Yemen (Serjeant 1959; Ghul 1960). Thus the mihrãb, which in South Arabian temples denoted a portico or a hall-like space or a court, in other words, a transitory space, a threshold of no clear sacred intentions, and also perhaps, an elevated, lofty room with possible feminine connotations, was shifted along the spatial hierarchy and elevated in status to become the sacred focus of Islamic prayer. Kanacan suggests that the concentrically arched Ibâçlï maharïb, set entirely within the depth of the wall, as opposed to the projecting alternative within the Sunni realm, is perhaps an independent tradition (Kanacan 2008: 232), to which the stucco version was adapted, as I would suggest. It is tempting to read in this the compacted depth of the pillared portico originally denoted by the term mihrãb. Stellar representation The earliest extant mihrãb at Sacal from 1252 and many of the subsequent ones display ample examples of stellar representation, interspersed with vegetal motifs (Fig. 4/a-c). Although the use of a six-pointed star or the radial motifs are prevalent, in many cases stellar and floral motifs could be read in conjunction - one subsumed into another, interchangeably or as a date-palm motif seen from above, i.e. as planimetrie representations. In earlier examples, such as at al-cAlï in Manah, the radiating variant is articulated further as a geometric construction derived from the master grid of the hexagonal star, examples of which are found in many classical Islamic monuments (e.g. the eleventh-century Chehel Dukhtaran, Isfahan; El-Said &amp; Parman 1976: 70-71, pl. 27 and fig. 50). At Sacal the central rosette bears a close resemblance to a certain Cairene depiction of a keel arch associated with the seven-pointed astral/floral motif (Kanacan 2008: 241). Stars have played an important role in South Arabian agricultural practices. Varisco ( 1 993) described the limited but continued use of the traditional Yemeni star-calendar in highland Yemen to define the seasons and timings of agricultural activities, which consists of twenty-eight distinct star periods defined by their own marker stars. Yemeni farmers refer to this calendar as the mďalim al- zir&amp;ah, the "agricultural markers". This contemporary form of the star calendar linked to the well-known Figure 4. Examples of stellar representations on Omani mahãrib: a. Masjidal-Jamď, Scfãl; b. Masjid al-cAyn, Manah; c. Masjid al-Sharjah, Nizwa.</page><page sequence="6">104 Soumyen Bandyopadhyay manãzil al-qamar, "lunar stations" of Arabian astrology, as Varisco points out, appears to be a more recent variant of numerous localized star lists: "There were several ways to divide up the natural seasons of a particular locality, but the simplest was use of a natural sky clock established by the local farmers through repeated observation of star positions and movements. Even those who were ignorant of formal astronomical knowledge, a science of great importance in the courts of medieval Yemen, could create such simple clocks to define the seasonal round for a particular location" (1993: 121). Although the main purpose of these systems was to focus the farmers' attention on the arrival of the rains, "early Islamic scholars combined the Indian lunar zodiac with indigenous Arab folklore on certain stars used to mark seasons and rainfall" (1993: 121-122), in reality these were more of academic value as analogous astronomical systems than as practical methods for ascertaining agricultural time. Many of the earlier marker star systems in Yemen relied on the solar year instead. In both cases, as the asterisms used were unevenly spaced along the path of the moon or the sun, the systems were only approximate in nature setting up an arbitrary grid, which in the case of the lunar system, divided the year into twenty-eight thirteen-day periods (1993: 124). The two formalized systems represent scholarly constructs attempting to integrate local star names into the formal lunar and solar zodiacs. While in Yemen the stars have been used to establish the most propitious time for harvesting based on the arrival of the rains, in Oman these have been used to ascertain the time at night. The aflãj irrigation system, at the heart of the Omani oasis, relies heavily on the sun during the day and the stars at night to tell the time to ensure the distribution of allocated water.5 The system differs from village to village in terms of the methods of stellar observation, the name and number of main and divider stars used for keeping time. The Omani star names often differ from those found in classical Arabic and to make things complicated, the same name is used for different stars, which are not always employed in the observation system according to their brightness either. While some stars are distinguished due to their brightness, size, or colour, the dividers often remain unnamed, known only as dividers of the main stars. The localized nature 5 The aflãj water distribution system has been discussed in great detail by Wilkinson, especially in his seminal work of 1977. Nash has dis- cussed the use of star systems that ensure appropriate distribution of aflãj water (2007). of the stellar system is highlighted by the fact that when a stargazer from al-Hamrah was taken to Muscat, there he failed to recognize the stars used in the village (Nash 2007: 159-160). Nash notes the observational system in Qaryat Banï Subh: In Qaryah Benï Subh stars are watched rising above the horizon. In other villages, walls, palm trees, and posts attached to buildings are used to mark the rising, setting, or zenith of stars. In Qaryah Benï Subh, twenty-one main stars are used with dividers and other stars, totalling approximately fifty. In the Muçlaybï area and beyond, twenty- four stars are used, but there are minor differences in the twenty-four stars used in different villages. (2007: 165) Important parallels could be observed in the number of stellar roundels in the decorative schemes of Omani prayer niches. The earliest mihrãb at Sacäl employs twenty-two roundels in the outer band, made prominent through their diameter and edge detail, interspersed with smaller roundels, which also flank these. At Sacal these smaller roundels contained three different motifs: overt stellar motifs, miniature depictions of the "endless-knot", and a quartered-circle, similar to the one-star calendar from Mutfayrib published by Nash (2007: 167, fig. 12). In the sixteenth-century mahãnb, prominence is given to fifteen roundels by recessing those with interstitial roundels larger than those at Sacäl, and between three and five roundels or circular depressions around the central rosette. The mahãnb at al-cAlï (1504) and al-cAyn (1505) mosques in Manah both contain twenty-one on the outer band with three at the centre; al-Shawädinah mosque in Nizwah has fifteen with five at its centre; while Bahlah has twenty. The outer band of the mihrãb in Rustãq contains twenty-eight roundels. The horizon as threshold This broad agreement between the number of stars used in ascertaining spans of time and the major and minor roundels employed on the mihrãb - irrespective of the size and proportion of the decorative project - brings the conception of the latter closer to the reality of the oasis. In asking how this might have happened, I suggest that we remind ourselves of the quasi-real nature of the mihrãb, in that it is a threshold that mediates, and always indicates something beyond itself, something it is not. It is this imbued virtuality - analogous to our understanding of the</page><page sequence="7">Conflation of celestial and physical topographies in the Ontani decorated mihrãb 1 05 Figure 5. The landscape east ofManah oasis. The horizon, its profile resulting from natural topography and architectonic features, has played an important role in the understanding of negotiated relationships with the wider society, nature, and the celestial order by those who live in Omani oasis settlements. continually receding horizon as a threshold - that makes the acceptance of the mediated stellar selection possible. Leatherbarrow (200 1 : 3) demonstrates how the Renaissance scholar and architect Leon Battista Alberti (1404-1472) devised an instrument he called the "horizon" - a circular disc marked with equally divided and marked segments and concentric rings with a movable arm or "radius" - to measure the city, which anticipated the theodolite. This was also an instrument that measured and located body contours; in both cases rays were projected back or forth on to a virtual edge, the "horizon", underscoring the horizon's encoding or recording role in the process of "conveyance" orof"transfer"(2001:9). The engagement of the horizon, either as the line where the ground met the sky or its substitution through parts of the settlement - date palm, walls, lanes, edges of buildings, and mosque courtyards - aligns the celestial topography with the immediate landscape of the oasis through the measuring of time. It is also a threshold through which the "agricultural marker" stars are required to pass to come into the realms of the physical landscape, firstly by establishing terrestrial markers through the position of the stargazer, and secondly by initiating and partaking in the process of measuring time and water flow. In Misfat al-cAbriyïn, architectonic features articulate this horizon as threshold; as Nash notes, "four small towers were built on a ridge forming the horizon to mark some of the main stars, to assist people with poor eyesight" (2007: 168). Employing an anthropomorphic analogy, many stars' names in Arabia are for parts of the body (e.g. al-Janb, the side or flank; al-Butayn, the little belly; al-Qalb, the heart) (2007: 163), drawing curious parallels with the names of geographical regions (e.g. Jawf, belly), suggesting alignment of celestial and physical topographies on an even larger scale. The notion of territoriality embedded among the settled {hadar) Omani population, centred on the oasis, addressed horizon as thresholds to negotiate the complex relationships with the nomads (badw) and the semi-nomadic population of the mountains (shawãwT) (Wilkinson 1983) (Figs 5 and 6). The unattainability of the horizon as threshold appears to be a feature of the Omani mihrãb, distinguished through its inaccessible shallow, and especially, low niche, mainly as a result of Ibaçlï doctrinal proscription against the imam to be separated from his congregation. By emphasizing concentration on God and directing towards the Kacbah, it acts as a threshold between the temporal existence and the transcendental experience of the essence of God. This notion of the threshold is further strengthened at Sacal by the placement of the Qur'anic verse, "[God] will be sufficient for you against them"; this or similar QurDanic verses are often used as talismans on doors to ward off evil from Omani dwellings (Kanacan 2008: 241). The Saljüq monument of Mama Hatun Kumbed in Tercan, eastern Anatolia, employs the "endless knot" motif and the star at its entrance (Rogers 1975: fig. 7), reminding us of this combination on Omani maharïb. The horizon, the surrounding landscape, and the date palm also feature in Omani dwelling thresholds and are associated with representations on Omani doors and windows (Fig. 7).</page><page sequence="8">1 06 Soumyen Bandyopadhyay Figure 6. The horizon as seen from the Qalcat al- Fayqayn, Manah.

The date-palm and "endless knot*' motif on Omani door decoration from Hãrat al-Bilãd, Manah. Note both the curvilinear and the sharp angular form of the "endless knot", the latter imitating the braided matting techniques of traditional basketry. The "endless knot" motif One of the main motifs used in the mihrãb is the so- called "endless knot", which, as Parpóla describes, is "a complex, maze-like closed pattern" (1994: 56-57) often employed to represent endless or continuous space or time. This motif, found from the Middle East to India from prehistoric to modern contexts, could be traced back to third-millennium ВСЕ Mesopotamia. The introduction into the Omani mihrãb^ however, appears to have happened from Iran where, by the tenth century, similar motifs were being used in the maharïb. In its simplest form it appears on the rectilinear elements of the column base and capital; however, it features heavily on the mihrãb decorative scheme (Fig. 8). A sharp angular version of the motif could be found on many Omani doors. In its more complex version the "endless knot" can be read in the uninterrupted curvilinear form weaving around the alternating small and large medallions of the outer band, which extends outwards to incorporate the smaller flanking roundels. In his extensive study of the Islamic ideas of time, and especially in Persian Sufism, Böwering (1992) explains how Islam modified the pre-Islamic Arab concept of time expressed in the idea of dahr. Punctuated only by the Days of the Arab (ayyãm al-QArab' i.e. the days of vengeance and brilliance in combat that took their permanent place in Arab memory, folklore, and poetry, the dahr was characterized by an endless, fathomless continuity of time, often paralleled with the experience of the desert nights. In countering the fatalistic view of time expressed in the jãhiliyyah, Islam introduced the transcendental</page><page sequence="9">Conflation of celestial and physical topographies in the Omani decorated mihrãb 1 07 Figure 8.

The stellar medallions are held within the curvilinear "endless knot" in the outer band of the decoration scheme. dimension of the promise of paradise and the idea of the Day of God (ayyãm Allah), and stressed the importance of the "instant" or "moment" in man's life, emphasized by such crucial instants as the point of origin of a person's life and the "hour" of revelation. An imagery of illumination or enlightenment often associates such moments and can be seen, for example, in expressions in connection with the perfect moment of revelation, "the twinkling of an eye" (lamh al-basar). Extending the Qur'anic view that Allah is the Lord of the instant, an important hadfth (hadith qudsi) later amplified this divine determination by identifying time (dahr) with God through his own proclamation: I am time (anã al- dahr) (Böwering 1992: 77-78). Following this elevation of time to a divine status, the "law followed the Qur'anic summons to give witness (shahãdah) to the divine signs (ãyãt) that established events in time" (1992: 79), making possible the representation of time on the Omani mihrãb, always favouring, however, observation over precise calculation as a testimony to the transcendental essence of God. The Qur*an explicitly confirmed the moon as the measurer of time; the day began with nightfall and the month began with the sighting of the new moon. Acceptance The method of allegorical interpretation developed in early Iba^ïsm of anthropomorphism (tashbJh) present in Qur'anic expressions describing God through aspects of the human body, and its later explanation through the expanded and less austere principle of Unity (tawhïd), I would argue, provided the Ibatfï artisans the basis for representing notions of time on their mahãríb. The founder of the Ibâçlï school, Jãbir b. Zayd, acquired his views from a number of the Companions of the Prophet, especially Ibn 1 Abbäs, which contributed to the intellectual foundation of the movement (al-Namï 2007: 106). Some of the exegeses in early IbatfT theology addressed such issues of anthropomorphism including qabdah (handful), al-yad (hand), cayn (eye), nur (light), wajh (face), al-sãq (leg), and al-nafs (soul). The cayn (in suras 20, v. 39; 11, v. 37; 23, v. 27; 52, v. 48; and 54, v. 14) for example, was interpreted as knowledge and protection; nur (in Sura 24, v. 35) as "the Guide of the inhabitants of heavens and earth"; and al-nafs (sura 5, v. 1 16) as knowledge (2007: 106-107). In later Ibatfï theological discussions on the Unity with God (tawhid) and regarding the rules and premises of association and friendship (al-walãyah), a more mystical tendency could be noticed within a continued asceticism; as Hofíman notes, "the emphasis is on purifying the soul, [on] asceticism, the defects of the soul and how to replace them with virtues - and receiving direct knowledge of God through the light of His love; a lot of emphasis on God's light and mystical insight, on nearness to God, His intimacy and His presence, but not union with God or the oneness of being. There is also emphasis on love of the Prophet and the friends of God, though not to the extent of saint shrine veneration" (Hofíman, personal communication, 2005). In Hoffman's view, Ibãçlism in Oman challenges the assumption that puritanism and mysticism are an unlikely juxtaposition in Islam (2004: 203). Mysticism, she suggests, has deep roots in Oman, exemplified by the presence of much Ibâçlï mystical poetry. A number of modern Ibaçlï scholars - from at least the eighteenth century onwards - embraced mysticism as part of their lives,6 skilfully integrating discussions on the way of love and conceptualization of knowledge in terms of ideas of illumination (2004: 209). 6 Hoffman lists the following modern Ibatfï scholars as having mysti- cism as part of their lives (2004: 204): Jalid "Abu Nabhãn" b. Khamïs al-Kharusï (1734/5-1822); his son, Nãsir b. Abí Nabhãn (1778-1847); Salïd b. Khalfan al-Khalïlï (1811-1871); ^Abdullah "Nur al-Dïn" al- Sâlimï (1869-1914); and Nãsir "Abu Muslim" b. Sãlim al-Bahlânï al- Rawwahï (1860-1920).</page><page sequence="10">108 Soumyen Bandyopadhyay Sanctity of the date palm In Bahlah, as Limbert noticed, dates and date palm were regarded as sacred, mainly as a miraculous gift from God that sustained life to the fullest: Sacredness ... is nothing, if it is not also about visiting and social responsibility, survival, respect for common property, and good governance. Indeed . . . dates are considered sacred precisely because the relevant qualities of sweetness, portability, and nutrition are embodied in a material object that is also critical for these everyday ideals, ideals that are themselves understood to be what a 'good' person does and is. Sacredness is not simply one regime of value in and out of which dates move and which belongs solely to a domain beyond the 'profane,' but emerges out of, and yet is clearly also part of, the combination of their multiple roles in everyday life. (Limbert 2008: 362) However, judging by the anthropomorphic date palm widely worn as a pendant for its talismanic qualities, its perceived supernatural powers could not be disregarded either. Perhaps this anthropomorphism could be seen as representing one end of the spectrum of how the date palm - its location, distribution, and harvesting - becomes spatial and temporal markers within oasis settlements, as Limbert notes. The "hot" quality of date is balanced by the "cold" quality of coffee during Omani ritual coffee sessions (Limbert 2008: 365). One could read a similar balance between the "coldness" of falaj water and the "hotness" of the date palm, represented in simple curvilinear and floral motifs on Omani doors. This theme, in its more complex manifestation as the "endless knot", complete with the star/date-palm motifs, could be found on Omani doors, either forming a circular pattern or inscribed within an arched motif, which probably represented the horizon. The outer bands of such decorations closely resemble the more angular version found on Omani doors and is close in expression to the palm-leaf matting or braiding still in vogue. This woven tapestry - defining territory through bounded space - brings to mind yet another tapestry employed in many central Omani homes, that of painted ceilings depicting celestial objects (Figs 9 and 10). Conclusion Thus the Ibaçlï artisan of Oman managed to integrate in the decorated mihrãb representations of both continuous and instantaneous time employing the endless knot and Figure 9. Omani door decoration from Hãrat al-Bilãd, Manah. stellar motifs. Emphasizing the sacred nature of time and light as divine attributes or essence of God, the mihrãb sought to represent a celestial topography, which was made possible through IbãçlT analogical interpretations of anthropomorphism in the Qui°än and an expanding influence of mysticism amongst Omani scholars. Omani mihrãb and door decoration shows a close affinity between stellar and date-palm representations, the latter held in sacred esteem across Omani oasis settlements. The aflãj irrigation system at the heart of date-palm cultivation once depended significantly on the position of stars in the night sky to ensure appropriate distribution of water. The interchangeable representation suggests a conflation</page><page sequence="11">Conflation of celestial and physical topographies in the Ontani decorated mihrãb 1 09 Figure 10. Painted ceiling decoration on date-palm beams from Hãrat al-cAqr, Nizwa. of the terrestrial topography of the oasis and the celestial topography. The horizon mediated this relationship - acting as a threshold through which the celestial bodies had to pass to be meaningfully associated with the terrestrial topography. Appearing as woven tapestries or bounded spatial representations, both the mihrãb and the Omani doorway decoration seem to mark a threshold in the sacred passage. However, in mystical thought, while space was perceived as "an accident of the body", time was regarded as "proceeding from the soul". This led Abu Hayyãn Tawhïdï (d. 1023) to answer the question, "Which is better, space or time?" with "Time is better, for space is of the senses but time is spiritual; space is in the world but time surrounds it" (Böwering 1992: 81). It is not my intention to suggest that the Omani artisans and scholars were consciously working in unison to make such ideas tangible. What I have sketched out however is a plausible and likely cultural environment that would have contributed towards the development of an unconscious (and perhaps conscious) aesthetic language.
