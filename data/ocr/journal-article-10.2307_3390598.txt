<plain_text><page sequence="1">I NEW BOOKS i FOLKSINGERS AND FOLKSONGS IN AMERICA. By Ray M. Lawless. New York: Duell, Sloan &amp; Pearce. 750 pp. preface, illustrations, and indices. $10. If Dr. Lawless had written this "hand- book of biography, bibliography and discography" fifty years ago, it would have been a rather slim pamphlet in- stead of a 750-page encyclopedia concerning the most startling develop- ment in American music history. In 1915 Child, Kittredge and Gummere had published. By 1917 Campbell and Sharp had brought out their first small volume. There followed Cox in 1925, Reed Smith in 1928, Arthur Kyle Davis in 1929, Richard Green in 1935 -and suddenly the list becomes much too long for any book review. These, of course, were the collec- tors. Fifty years ago there were very few folk singers, in the sense of en- tertainers employing folk materials. Carl Sandberg and John Jacob Niles were collecting the folk song and legend near at hand and also singing. The elder Lomax in Texas was lec- turing and singing, and there were a few cowmen in Los Angeles who were raising their voices with the music of the mining camps and the ranches. But none of us knew it was loaded. I had written "Go 'way from My Win- dow" and the currently popular tune "Black Is the Color of My True Love's Hair," but the only people who were willing to listen to me, outside my own family, were a few ladies in the wom- en's and music clubs. They thought folksingers were "quaint" and "cute." This was the situation fifty years ago, and if I seem to be emphasizing the date, it is because Dr. Lawless has written it into the very first lines of his prologue. The extensive (145 pages of small type) discography in Dr. Lawless's book is of particular interest to me, because as I write, I have beside me the 1940 Victor catalogue, and in it there is only one admitted folksinger, John Jacob Niles, and one album titled Early American Ballads. In the Victor catalogue I was flanked by Ellen Ney, pianist, Grace Moore, soprano, Pierre Monteux, conductor, and Paderewski, pianist. In those days folksingers were listed in the Red Seal division of the Victor catalogue; so far as I can tell there was no Schwann. We have come a long way from that solitary listing twenty-five years ago to the huge section in Dr. Lawless's book listing the singers, the titles, the companies involved in the production of records of folk music. Of course, even before 1940 there were other commercial recordings. Most significant were those done in the field, notably in North Carolina. Dr. Lawless has made a great con- tribution through this volume to the historical side of the burgeoning folk music situation. It is hardly possible to write so much about so many and get every detail absolutely correct. It is nothing short of miraculous that the errors are so few. Every folksinger should have a copy of this work, and libraries, of course, will have to have it on their shelves. Dr. Lawless, who at present is a teacher at Metropoli- tan Junior College in Kansas City, Missouri, is to be congratulated in- deed. -JOHN JACOB NILES, authority on American folk music, composer, instru- ment-maker, and author, Louisville, Kentucky. MAN THROUGH HIS ART, Volume II: Music. Edited by Anil de Silva, Otto von Simson, Roger Hinks, and Philip Troutman. Sponsored by the World Confederation of Organiza- tions of the Teaching Profession and published with the financial help of UNESCO. London: Educational Pro- ductions Publishing Co., Ltd.; and Greenwich, Connecticut: New York Graphic Society, 1964. 64 pp., 20 plates, $7.95. As planned by the editors and spon- sor, the series, Man through his Art, will consist of fourteen volumes.l Each will contain twenty plates, sixteen in 'Fourteen according to the General Preface, but the dust jacket lists fifteen. color, four in black and white, with descriptions and commentary. Each "will illustrate a particular theme . . . so selected from the broad range of man's experience that almost every as- pect of his everyday life is repre- sented." The series is intended hope- fully "to further mutual appreciation of Eastern and Western cultural values" and to serve as a "contribu- tion to the cause of world under- standing." It is presented explicitly as educational material, for "the hands of teachers everywhere." The editors, associate editors, and contributors- the latter presumably only named here for Volume II-are "acknowl- edged experts on their respective sub- jects" chosen from both hemispheres. Obviously any series having such enlightened aims deserves careful con- sideration. Whatever our own educa- tional objectives may be, we tend to drift away from considering their rela- tion to a vital context. We have to be concerned with specific skills and cog- nitions in teaching music; but we must also teach the ways in which music as a grand gesture of the human spirit relates to our total cultural heritage and to the ultimate nature of reality. And not that only. We must awaken an enduring appetite among our stu- dents for reflecting on those ways and how they touch their own lives. For these tasks all aspects, times and places of that heritage must be con- sidered for reference, however partial may be our personal insights, our daily uses. Graphic and sculptural masterpieces such as those in this book, through their iconography, usually show quite clear relationships to a cultural con- text. They are especially valuable not only in teaching what some aspect of life is all about but also how the arts in general act as an enhancement and a mirror of life. Such works lend them- selves to two functions in teaching: as vehicles for the contemplation of beauty (like music) and as direct portrayals of man's reactions to life (more explicitly than music). It is to serve primarily in this latter function that reproductions of master- NOVEMBER-DECEMBER.

In all but four, musicians ap- pear in contexts that illustrate the uses of music in many different cultures. Surely we learn from this enough to justify looking and reflecting; but the synesthesia that can take place, whereby the visual stimulus of the reproductions wakes a sense of musical movement and sound-this is the in- effable bonus clearly sought by the editors. (I cannot help but wonder how they will be able to do the same thing successfully in some of the other volumes!) The range of choice in this volume is impressive: from the fourteenth century B.C. to 1952 A.D., from five continents, ten religions, and a dozen masters (including Fra An- gelico, Tang Yin, Griinewald, Mit- sunori, Rembrandt, Degas, and Cha- gall, among others. Chief among the possible values of this book is its vivid demonstration of the great callings that music has had. In Hellenic, Buddhist, and Christian examples music is shown as the vehicle of highest ecstasy and adoration (e.g., in the Javanese Celestial Musicians and in Fra Angelico's Christ Glorified in the Court of Heaven). Egyptian and Mayan examples show music at- tending the rituals of burial and of the celebration of victory in battle. The largest group depicts the healing, soul-nourishing contemplation of the beauty of music. The most moving of these is Rembrandt's late, superb David Playing Before Saul; but the several oriental examples, Giorgione's Concert champetre, and Degas' early but masterful portrayal of his father listening to a guitarist evoke a tran- quil state of being like that of ab- sorbed listening. The social milieus range from royal through aristocratic and middle-class to tribal, but there is no implication that the higher uses of music are necessarily only for the higher classes. Music as entertainment is shown in an exquisite, wonderfully rhythmic Persian miniature. A certain casualness toward listening to music as mere en- tertainment appears in two pictures, hinting at what we deplore today, a prevailing limited use of music more to murder silence than to enhance existence. For example, Whistler's The Music Room depicts a young girl un- concernedly reading while a woman in black riding-habit listens, more or less in passing, to another woman whom we see only reflected in a mirror absorbed apparently in playing an unseen piano. And even Giorgione's beautiful pastorale presents music as merely one of several concurrently available delights for the senses. At least here we gain the impression that MUSIC EDUCATORS JOURNAL i</page><page sequence="3">music-making was the genuine focal point while it lasted. Four plates call for special com- ment: Chagall's Around Her (1945) has no explicit musical content, but surely its visionary quality "aspires to the condition of music."3 A photo- graph of an African tribal harp, called by scholars anthropomorphic because its typical shape, its carved head and even-in some examples-its two legs and feet suggests complementary interpretations, first of musical instru- ments as living beings, second of the human body as a vehicle for harmo- nious action. A transept wall with rose window in the cathedral of Laus- anne appears in a black-and-white plate, along with sketches showing the derivation of its proportions and pat- tern from rigorously controlled ratios. Visual, mathematical and musical con- sonance are thus equated, all echoing the metaphysical perfection from which they come. Finally, an anony- mous seventeenth-century Rajput miniature, the Kakubha Ragini, de- picts an adorned girl offering garlands to two peacocks while walking down a path in a garden luxuriant with birds, flowers, and trees. Only in the title is there any specific pointer to our imagination with which to relate the painting to music: ragini, like its masculine counterpart, raga, refers to a melodic mode in Indian classical music. The picture depicts in beautiful symbolism the mood of "love, sepa- ration and longing," relating thus explicity to the all-important Indian esthetic theory of rasas. This vener- able doctrine This is a most impressive statement of the power art has to show what man is. It is especially interesting because of its suggested relation- ships to similar statements in other cultures, including that of the musi- cal High and Late Baroque, with their Doctrine of the Affections. The plates in this publication are generally well reproduced, though not sumptuous; those in black and white are all somewhat muddy and the Persian minature only hints at the presumed brilliance of the orig- inal. The commentaries are good, reflecting the orientations of the various contributors without losing sight of the main thread of thought behind the publication. They re- veal at least a decent knowledge, on the part of the writers, of the musical items and activities in the paintings. Before we carp at one contributor's dubbing of Griine- wald's viol a "cello," in the "Angelic Concert" of the Isenheim Altar- . . establishes man and his fundamental emotional states or "passions" at the centre of artistic activity. These funda- mental and permanent emotions-love, sorrow, peace, fear, terror, heroism, dis- gust, wonder and ridicule-become trans- muted into asethetic emotions or rasas, through a magical process, as it were, which involved the quality of the work of art as well as the ability of the man who enjoys it. These rasas, evoked only in the "right" spectator, the "right" listener, by which is meant the sympa- thetic audience, make possible an extraor- dinary experience. The listener, in the case of music for example, is in the midst of the drama of life, but being an uninvolved participant experiences its full passion in a state of "unobstructed consciousness" without being personally torn by it. He is like the traditional lotus leaf, untouched by the surrounding water. His experience is also ecstatic, approach- ing the experience of the saint; rasa then fills him "as a perfume fills a room," or burns in him like "fire burns in dry wood."4 3The phrase is Walter Pater's, quoted in the Introduction by Dr. Hinks. 4From the commentary to the plate, said to be based "on a text by Geeta Satyadeva Mayor," Indian sitarist. NOVEMBER-DECEMBER, NINETEEN SIXTY-FIVE 109</page><page sequence="4">piece, we must ask ourselves how many musical scholars are likely to distinguish between a polyptych and a hemistich when they see one. Each plate has in addition to the commentary a short statement giv- ing background data, and a selec- ted list of references potentially of value beyond the immediate con- text. There are a few smaller illus- trations in black and white for in- structive comparison with the main plates. Two epigraphs come from Shakespeare and the Jaiminiya, epitomizing the universality of the editors' plan. This is a book valuable in itself besides promising much for the en- tire series, and suggestive enough to encourage imaginative teachers of music to search out further examples, for their students' sakes and their own. -ROBERT NM.

Urbana, Illinois: American String Teachers Association, 1964. 211 pp. $10.00. Senso-Motor Study and its application to Violin Playing rates as an extraor- dinary and significant contribution in the field of string playing technic and pedagogy. Prior physiological studies pertaining to violin playing have been precious few, principal contributions by Steinhausen and Trendlenburg dating from the first quarter of this century. Drawing from the recent find- ings of motion physiology, itself a nascent science of the twentieth cen- tury, Dr. Polnauer in collaboration with Dr. Marks has done some truly original work in an effort to base violin playing and teaching on scien- tific principles. Motion science, according to the authors, is rooted in classical physi- ology and anatomy on the one hand and guided by the discoveries of Gestalt psychology on the other. The authors quote M. Wertheimer, "one of [the] famous pioneers" in the for- mulation of Gestalt theory, as follows: "There are wholes, the behavior of which is not determined by that of their individual elements, but where the part processes are themselves de- termined by the intrinsic nature of the whole. It is the hope of Gestalt theory to determine the nature of such wholes." As applied to violin playing, Dr. Polnauer formulates his own Gestalt- oriented beliefs as follows: "The prob- lem of musical skill [can] best be ap- proached through consideration of [the] senso-motor function of the body as a whole and not merely the individual segmented parts." He de- plores the "isolated treatment of such essential components as body-posi- tion, holding the violin, bow-grip, bowing-motion, left hand position, etc.... as separate entities within an aggregate." He also scores the confusion in the present state of instrumental pedagogy and "the plurality of teaching meth- ods, which are, in most cases, inef- ficient and often contradictory." In Part II, some of these divergent approaches to violin technic are out- lined in a brief historical survey cov- ering about 300 years. Sources in- clude, among others, violin tutors, illustrations, sketches, and contempo- rary verbal accounts of performing techniques. Traditional schools of vio- lin playing are described, and in a fascinating section of the book, key features of Paganini's approach to playing are reconstructed.
