<plain_text><page sequence="1">Horace Mann - Mustard Seed PAUL BIXLER hated that special flower of New HAWTHORNE England, the reformer, but when he put his hate into fiction the result, strangely enough, was generalized. One cannot say with any conviction that for Hollingsworth in The Blithedale Romance he used a human model; this would be contrary to good critical opinion. Yet Hawthorne was ac- quainted with several reformers and Horace Mann, first secre- tary of the Massachusetts board of education and "father of the common schools/5 was his brother-in-law. Hollingsworth was a bore, Hawthorne tells us; moreover, at one time he seemed to be "fast going mad." His "philanthropic dream" was concerned with the cure of criminals. There was "some- thing of the woman moulded into his great, stalwart frame" and he had a special, strange sympathy "towards those whom disease, or weakness, or calamity of any kind causes to falter and faint amid the rude jostle of our selfish existence." These things we are told yet Hollingsworth never comes to life. He is always a symbol, always a wraith of his author's mood. Never- theless, it seems a pity that, because the reformer is not three- dimensioned, he should lack a human model. Especially so since Mann so readily presents himself. Mann and Hawthorne married two of the Peabody sisters; Horace, Mary, and Nathaniel, Sophia. In his journal Haw- thorne never refers to his brother-in-law except casually in connection with other members of the two families. Only once did he soften or humanize his attitude; when he was removed from the Salem customs house he wrote Mann, in Congress at the time, for political assistance. Hawthorne's son, Julian, has recorded the day when Mann first discovered that Nathaniel smoked cigars: 24</page><page sequence="2">Horace Mann - Mustard Seed Uncle Horace stopped short in his tracks, as one brought unawares to the brink and reek of the Pit. He snapped, "Mr. Hawthorne, I am sorry to say that I can no longer entertain the same respect for you that I once had!" My father smiled sympathetically, but did not throw away the butt, and my uncle withdrew. Julian is prejudiced. He is certain that his uncle never once made any effort to understand him, that his uncle's personality was distasteful to children. The Hawthornes, father and son, looked on Mann simply a^s a reformer who had married into the family. In any search for the truth this doesn't get us very far. For if we measure the individual by his reforms we get a confused portrait and only a part of the truth. Mann disap- proved of liquor, profanity and tobacco in ascending order of emphasis. He strongly discouraged the use of coffee and tea. He favored dancing for the sake of health but thought Fanny Ellsler, the Viennese ballerina who cleaned up $85,000 in America in a few months, a shameless hussy. He considered the reading of fiction pernicious. He believed in humane treatment of the insane, in education for every child, in the relieving of pain in childbirth. There is a hint that he favored birth control. Women's rights affronted him but in general he thought women hadn't been getting their deserts or finding their proper place in the world's scheme. In frantic search for a scientific system of morals he fell headlong for phrenology. Perhaps because he has been remembered as a reformer and an educator competent biographers have never paid him any attention. One may reasonably suggest that there was something more to him than the content of his reforms, certainly some- thing more than the sanctified nonentity that has been created for the worship of school children. As an adult Mann occasionally spoke with deep feeling of the rigors of his childhood. In the first decade of the 1 9th cen- tury nothing in the little town of Franklin, Massachusetts, near which the Mann farm was located, was calculated to foster his intense love of beauty, his shy imagination or his naturally 25</page><page sequence="3">The American Scholar buoyant spirit. On the contrary all the "better" influences - school, church, and library - seemed expressly designed to frus- trate and repress the good will with which he seemed to have been endowed. In middle age he remembered his life on the farm as hard and poverty-stricken. This he may have exag- gerated, for he dearly loved to dramatize himself. But if there is doubt of his poverty there is none that as a boy he was su- premely unhappy. In the histories and volumes of theology found in the neigh- borhood library there was much to trouble his mind, little to feed it. Learning in the school was rude and intermittent. The church, however, wielded the chief influence. The town of Franklin had been ruled over for twenty years by a Calvinist of the most forthright convictions. In a tradition of which the fate was already discernible on the wall Dr. Nathanael Emmons chewed tobacco, wore a three-cornered hat and gave his con- gregation the terrors of hell every Sunday. The quality of his philosophy is suggested by placing side by side two of his most powerfully-held beliefs: man's mental life was merely a series of "exercises," the result of divine action, yet man also had freedom to choose and a definite moral responsibility. Such was the power of the picturesque in his tales of damnation that more than a hundred fledgling preachers came to him seeking the formula for success and it was even proposed that a main highway be built through the town to make it easier for pil- grims to drink from the fountain of his wisdom. His effect on the sensitive and already introspective young Horace was blis- tering. Others have recorded the spiritual blight of Calvinism. In later life Mann told an intimate friend that "a strange fasci- nation" used to impel him Sunday after Sunday to read and re- read a certain verse in Watts' hymn-book; the verse described a solitary soul wandering about in eternity, "rudderless and homeless." The young boy, accepting Emmons' theology at face value and goaded by its horrors, had a strong impression that the lost soul referred to himself. All that was wanted was a bad shock. It came at the age of 26</page><page sequence="4">Horace Mann - Mustard Seed twelve with the sudden death of an older brother by drowning. At the funeral Emmons chose to describe the consequences of dying unconverted. Watching the despair on his mother's face and hearing her groan, Horace was thrown into violent con- fusion. He did not recover until he had repudiated a God who gloried in punishment of the wicked and a theology which taught that "the smoke of the damned was the enjoyment of the blessed." If this was grace, if this was salvation, he wanted none of it. Yet he never satisfactorily resolved the conflict thus joined. The Calvinistic strain ran deep. Later he always seemed to be seeking obliquely to get at something his firmest convic- tions forbade him to approach directly. For the casting out of an anthropomorphic God he found compensation in an iron- clad, "scientific" morality. He has been called a Puritan in all but theology and it is possible that his so-called "martyr com- plex," which proved highly useful in dramatizing his battles for education, had its source in this unfinished struggle. Solemn, thin-faced, repressed, he passed through the drab teens and at twenty, with little formal schooling behind him and only six months of tutoring in the classics, entered Brown University. Here and presently in law school he expanded hap- pily for the first time in his life. At Brown he committed a sin, lightly and with pleasant consequences. In his third year the college authorities forbade a Fourth of July celebration traditionally held in chapel. With fellow students he entered a patriotic parade, marched to the chapel and delivered the prin- cipal oration. His roommate remarks that in spite of a small fine imposed on him he lost no credit with president or faculty. About his poverty he could occasionally smile. We find him writing to his sister, If the children of Israel were pressed for "gear" half so hard as I have been, I do not wonder that they were willing to worship a golden calf. It is a long, long time since my last ninepence bade good-by to its brethren; and I suspect that the last two parted in no friendly terms, for they have never since met together. Poor wretches! never did two souls stand in greater need of mutual support and consolation. 27</page><page sequence="5">The American Scholar Success began to look him squarely in the face. His brilliance went uncontested and his talk showed traces of that wit which so became him in his prime. The title of the address he gave on graduation from Brown, "The Gradual Advancement of the Human Species in Dignity and Happiness," correctly gives the trend of his mind. Mann was always the idealist and seldom gloomy when at his best. One of his reasons for choosing the law must have been its certainty, its opportunity for exactness and moral choice. As always his ethical bent was strong. When Lord Brougham, whose natural theology he greatly admired, described the duty of an advocate to his client in unlimited terms he heartily dissented. Mann took no cases unless he was certain of his client's honesty and the justness of his cause. This scruple limited the young lawyer's practice but in the end won him a fine reputation and a good 80 per cent of his law suits. In Dedham, Massachusetts, where he had chosen to take off on his career, life began to open up. His associates were admirable men, respected in the profession; through them he easily ac- cepted the political traditions of the Quincy and Adams fam- ilies and entered the councils of the local National Republi- cans. He became a member of a reading club, regularly attended the Unitarian Church, successfully ran for the state legislature. By 1830, when he was 34 years old, his debts had been paid long since and he was looking about for an occasional invest- ment. Presently he married the shy young daughter of the president of Brown. He cared for her with a rare intensity as though she were some delicate, secret bloom. He was now on the road to a respectable but conventional career. With Charlotte Messer as permanent hostage it is hard to see how he could ever have escaped the law or at furthest remove, politics. Then, suddenly, his wife died. Her passing smashed the little world he had been building for himself. At once he dismissed any future chance for personal happiness. Inevitably his mind was thrown back to his earlier tragedy; it was of these two events he was thinking when he admitted "my early associations with death are too much for my reason." 28</page><page sequence="6">Horace Mann - Mustard Seed To escape utter disorganization he immersed himself for the moment in his cases at law. Other factors, however, were at work. Already he saw the commanders of the new industrial state fastening down the economic hatches on the poor. He sym- pathized with the unfortunate - with the ignorant and the enslaved, with the lame, the halt, and the blind; he was begin- ning to believe that the chief hope of improvement lay in edu- cation of the young. For six years he had represented the city of Dedham in the state legislature and his political fortunes were on the rise. A fourth term in the house led to a term in the senate where he shortly became president. As head of the senate in 1837 he promoted and signed the bill creating the first state board of education. A successful legislator, he probably had no immediate design on the secretaryship. When it was offered him his associates, ignorant of his inmost thoughts, believed him foolish to accept and were astonished when he paused to consider it. But foot- loose and by this time possessed of purpose he was not unwilling to give up promise of wordly goods for $1,000 a year and a chance to rouse the public to its duties. "Having found the present generation composed of materials almost unmalleable," he wrote, "I am about transferring my efforts to the next." He might consider children as wax but he was under no illusion concerning the toughness of the metals he would shortly be working on. Had you attended a typical Massachusetts school in 1837 you would have found yourself in a small room stale with breath and heated largely by the body warmth of too many pupils. The geography from which you memorized and then recited would have been only one of half a dozen different texts used indiscriminately by your friends and there would have been no supplementary globes or other visual apparatus. The desks might have been arranged around the four walls or they might have formed a circle facing in or out according to the whim of the schoolmaster. If you were especially unlucky you might even have been confined in the middle of a long bench with an 29</page><page sequence="7">The American Scholar equally long desk in front of you and four or five fellow-suf- ferers on either side. And if you objected to any of these ar- rangements or otherwise displeased the teacher you could have expected a brisk hiding. Of course you might have been one of a considerable number who didn't attend school at all. Or if your parents were of means you might have been enrolled at a private academy. Public education, in favor of which the colony had valiantly declared itself two centuries before, had gone the way of good intentions. It has been estimated that half of the women of the time did not know how to write their own names and that among the men the percentage ran only a little lower. Not much was expected of the teachers drawn from this body politic. The men, who taught the older children during the winter term, earned on an average $25 a month. With sectarianism still gripping New England they were chosen on the basis of pro- fessed piety and of ability to put the rod to fractious pupils. The women, who taught the smaller children during the summer term, averaged $ 1 1 a month. They were not expected to know as much as the men and seldom surpassed the expectation. For 50 years no prominent person in Massachusetts had cared enough for the state of public learning to raise a rumpus about it. With abnormal energy and the prestige of political success Mann set out across the state to raise it. In the next 1 1 years he addressed popular audiences wherever he could find them, wrote 1 2 detailed annual reports for the state gov- ernment and established a bi-weekly school journal. The re- ports, which have come down to us as embodying the chief points in his program, surveyed current conditions, weighed them and laid out the future for 100 years; together, they formed chapters in a kind of educational Bible. In the end he whipped public indifference into enthusiasm; his energy con- quered Massachusetts, spread to other states and presently reached Europe. England and Germany felt his influence but the greatest foreign impact came in South America where Domingo Sarmiento, Argentine ambassador to the United</page><page sequence="8">Horace Mann - Mustard Seed States, years afterward imported Mann's ideas and many of his teachers. His objectives seem commonplace if we forget their relation to history. Who, today, questions the desirability of normal schools, educational statistics, school libraries, the teaching of physiology? He was not above suggesting the proper shape for school desks, insisting on playgrounds or defining in detail the best methods for heating and ventilation. He fought also against the use of emulation and fear as motives. He thought the child learned best when he was happy and there is even a suggestion of progressive education in his idea that the pupil should begin with the familiar objects and facts of his own environment. Educators have pointed out that Mann never had to prove himself as a teacher and that none of his ideas were original. True, James G. Carter, Henry Barnard, and Calvin Stowe con- tributed more to educational theory than he did and they were in the educational field earlier and remained longer. They were men who knew from experience what was necessary but they were content to proceed toward their objectives in an orderly way. The Mann of the Massachusetts secretaryship was not an educator in the usual sense. Essentially he was an idealist and a promoter. He believed that all children (whom, incidentally, as individuals he never understood) should be offered the same educational opportunity and that this proposition was funda- mental to the continuation of democracy. But underneath all else lay a deep-rooted, Calvinistic conviction - that children were born (not in sin! ) in ignorance. Education was salvation. Such a conviction is hardly that of a practical educator or even of a philosopher. As secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Education Mann paid all his expenses out of his meager salary. His perpetual energy drove him to travel countless miles to outlying towns on horseback, it stretched his work-day to 16 and 18 hours and deprived him of sleep. Because he thought he could not afford it, for a time he ate only two meals a day. This was a man who said that when he had anything to do he "always set about it 31</page><page sequence="9">The American Scholar like a fatalist." Although his sacrifices may not have seemed entirely necessary they were helping to create a dramatic figure for popular consumption - a figure gaunt, undernourished and worn with honest fatigue. Public controversies fed the bonfire he was building under Massachusetts indifference. The most important was thrust on him at a crucial moment by the leaders of the academies, the Boston schoolmasters. In a paper 145 pages long they objected to his implied criticism of current education, one of their com- plaints centering on his intemperate language! This last was really nothing for anyone except a pedant to complain about, for it was his intemperance as much as anything else which had won him a hearing. Popular sentiment by this time was with him. His sentences rolled forth from tongue and pen with increasing power and pertinence. When he said "Had I the power, I would scatter libraries over the whole land, as the sower sows his wheat-field" his listeners sympathized. When he told them "To thwack a child over the head because he does not get his lesson, is about as wise as it would be to rap a watch with a hammer because it does not keep good time" they under- stood what he was talking about. And when he thundered "The common school is the greatest discovery ever made by man!" they knew him well enough to nod their heads sagely. Of such stuff are popular ideologies made. Mann had not yet proved himself a thinker of originality nor did he seem a scholar of the first grade. Instead he had a quality which for his day was almost as admirable - a great yearning for whatever had the appearance or showed the prom- ise of science. It is hardly astonishing that he accepted phrenol- ogy whole-heartedly. He had always felt a great need for certainty and exactness in his personal beliefs. Without knowing how to attack such problems he was always hoping to see pol- itics and morals treated in what he conceived to be a scientific manner. Phrenology appealed to his notion of certified truth. In extenuation it may be said that historically the phrenological 32</page><page sequence="10">Horace Mann - Mustard Seed "system" helped to break down the rigidity of religious super- stition and prepare the way for acceptance of true science. In 1843 he married a second time and traveled to Europe. The gentle admiration of Mary Peabody soothed his tormented spirit and the journey to Germany and England brought him a number of new acquaintances. But in the early forties his most satisfying personal relationship was that with George Combe. He had been predisposed to the Scotch phrenologist through his writings; Combe believed that education should be secular and national and was engaged in simplifying social and psychological phenomena into a unified scheme of thought. Combe visited America in 1840-41 and we get an amusing picture of the two happy head hunters traveling about the coun- try together, unobtrusively examining the features of their companions wherever they went. Phrenology was the serious hobby of a man who badly needed recreation; there is no evi- dence that it ever did him harm. His friendship with Combe was one of the few untroubled relationships of his career. After twelve years of peripatetic labor in the cause of edu- cation Mann's health, never of the best, became seriously im- paired. Instead of a vacation he chose to resume his rôle as legislator; his new reputation put him in Congress in the chair vacated by the death of John Quincy Adams. By this time gov- ernment plainly took secondary significance in his heart and it is characteristic of him that he expected his new political career to provide a breathing-space and a minor kind of recreation. He misread the temper of his new colleagues and the insistence of his own conscience. The Congress of 1848-52 was not a hall for recreation nor was it a place where men could reason- ably take council together. Mann had proved his ability at coining a witty, popular phrase and at conducting a spirited controversy through the newspapers but he had no stomach for the brawling, blow-f or-blow chaos that met him in the national legislature. Among the hard-bitten words of Webster, Gid- dings, Stevens and the obstreperous Southerners his own well- wrought speeches seemed beside the point. 33</page><page sequence="11">The American Scholar His convictions led him not toward outright abolition but to restriction of slavery within the confines already set. As al- ways, he drew a careful chalk-line and then walked it. When two abolitionists were arrested near Washington for helping slaves to escape to the North he was the only prominent lawyer to serve in active defense at court. With the promise of physical violence in the air this took courage. But perhaps no more than later on when Webster joined Clay in the compromise of 1 8505 immediately Mann opposed the New England renegade in one of his better, more powerful speeches. He could hardly hope to defeat the plans of the god-like Daniel. But in the succeeding months he gained the satisfaction, against all the forces the great politician could muster, of winning reelection. Statues of these two antagonists, whose personalities were opposed even more directly than their brief controversy would suggest, ironi- cally stand together today before the Massachusetts State House. Mann was growing weary of his new rôle, learning in the hard way a truth which he was later to admit - that in Con- gress he always seemed like aa skinned man among nettles." In 1852 he listened to a little group of the Christian sect who suggested that he come out to Ohio as president of a college to be called Antioch. The offer attracted him. His visitors as- sured him that the new institution was to be non-sectarian and without prejudice to sex. It might prove a good opportunity to work out some of his new ideas - and besides, it was time he was returning to what he knew best. Upon reassurances of good will from the Christians he accepted though he did not go out for another year. No decision of his life took more love for a cause or greater temerity; he was 57 and Ohio to a New Eng- lander still seemed on the edge of the wilderness. Women's rights came to Ohio in 1853 *п the tangible form of Mrs. Bloomer, the lady of reformed dress. Her presence in the town of Mount Vernon, some miles to the northeast of Yellow Springs, may have vaguely disturbed Mann, for he dis- approved of women agitators dressed in hats and trousers. He thought he had something better in store for them than their 34</page><page sequence="12">Horace Mann - Mustard Seed rights. Earlier he had proclaimed women rather than men the proper preceptors for the young. Now he committed himself to coeducation - so frankly so that three girls presently re- signed from Oberlin, the original institution of coeducation, to enter the "freer" Antioch. The new president, however, found graver problems confronting him than the social status of the new woman. Neither the inhabitants of the little village of Yellow Springs, primarily a summer resort, nor the founders of the college were prepared to meet their new master. In the first days the members of the Mann family, like any party of visitors from Cincinnati, had to live in a boarding house. The main college building had no desks, no chairs, no heating equip- ment. It is related that under the normal deluge of spring and autumn rains the campus became a bog and that pigs wandered about at will, even entering the college eating hall which was as yet without benefit of doors. "If Adam and Eve had been introduced into Paradise," Mann wryly remarked, "as early in the progress of creation, in proportion, as the faculty were introduced at Antioch, they would have been created about Wednesday night." But he could withstand hardship if there were purpose in it. Students, poor and illy prepared, entered to the number of 150. He ate with them at the common dining tables, teaching them man- ners, and saw the great majority, unable to meet the college standards, well launched on a preparatory course. There were some weaknesses he could not alleviate. The col- lege was inadequately financed. A small initial fund had already been spent} as for other income there were only $100 "scholar- ships" - a kind of bond whereby if only the annual interest were paid a student might receive free tuition. The president never received more than a part of his modest $1500 yearly salary and his family might have been reduced to poverty had not the Mid- West sought - and paid for - his extra-curricular lectures. The college, in fact, was bankrupt on the day it opened and remained so for five years. Some of the Christians, more- over, were reneging on their early commitments. They looked 35</page><page sequence="13">The American Scholar over the new leader they had so hopefully selected for his national reputation and disapproved of him. Who was this free-thinker that he should be introducing his atheism into their college? What did he mean by choosing two of his East- ern friends for the faculty in preference to home talent that was practically as good? This group stubbornly fought to turn part of the institution into a theological seminary and sought indecently to subvert the president's program even before it was well established. Mann has been criticized for poor administration. Certainly he should have known better than he did what it was he was accepting and perhaps he should have extracted a more explicit agreement from the denominational founding fathers. But once on the ground it is hard to see how anyone could have improved on his efforts. What other man of his stature would have la- bored so cruelly under such embarrassments? Keeping a fierce grip on his ideals, he turned loose all his old demoniacal energy on the material at hand. In the end he made the college come true of his own will. In the end he himself became the insti- tution. Antioch College is today the most tangible heritage he left behind him, for it holds more closely to his ideas than one might reasonably expect after 80 American years. His spirit is not wholly absent and his name is occasionally heard in the college halls. It is possible he would not understand the sense of humor so prevalent on the campus. The letters of his young manhood show that he was not born utterly solemn. But by the time he undertook the serious burden of education he seems to have squeezed from his personality most of the fun possible. In his popular lectures there is scarcely a gleam. To the first graduating class he vehemently condemned "all brawling jol- lities or sports unworthy the nobler faculties of man" but wished to "advance an earnest plea in behalf of elegant and refined mirthfulness." The cooperative plan would have aston- ished him. Yet this is directly traceable to the idea which he expressed in "symmetry/' a word which President Arthur E. 36</page><page sequence="14">Horace Mann - Mustard Seed Morgan accepted and used at its face value. Both these men believed that the student should be well-rounded, that he should be acquainted with all fields of knowledge, that he should know the practical as well as the theoretical. Although the "all- around man" was once a fraternity shibboleth, the liberal col- lege has never pushed the idea to its furthest development. There is reason to believe that it is not yet well understood; so late as last year the dailies of two of the country's largest uni- versities continued to refer to the Antioch plan as essentially vocational. He would be delighted with the broad health pro- gram of the college. His first lectures concerned a pet subject, physiology, and he once boasted that Antioch paid "far more attention to physical education than any other institution (ex- cept military ones) that I know of in the world." Community government, by which faculty and students democratically control their joint social and political relation- ships, at first glance would probably baffle him. Yet it is again a logical development, for he yearned after a type of society wherein every individual might find his true recognition. He sought to stimulate a community feeling among his students, believing that their position "created in them serious duties and responsibilities toward each other." He found, however, that in his rôle as creator and administrator he could hardly wait for democracy. His system was severe and though he tried to take into consideration such contingencies as conscience it sometimes seemed arbitrary. A student, writing home to her father in 1858, tells melodramatically of spies listening at col- lege keyholes. She refers to the Mann code, a new standard of honor, by which the president expected every member of the student body automatically to become his brother's keeper. Such a departure from the traditional student code of mutual pro- tection and conspiracy by silence, a departure based on faulty psychology, could not be successful. The ultimate penalties were too severe - public reproof, in which the president called the criminal to his feet in general assembly and generously dressed him down, or if the crime seemed beyond hope of 37</page><page sequence="15">The American Scholar expiation, plain dismissal. Yet such was the force of his con- viction that no overt rebellion occurred. Thus he withstood his severest test. For the rest, evidence plainly shows that his stu- dents revered him. His ideas at Antioch show a greater originality than those of his Massachusetts career. He was more experienced in edu- cation; he knew at last exactly where he wanted to go. Coedu- cation, the teaching of physiology and science, learning without artificial stimulus or social restriction, symmetry, a strong moral code - he took them all and against odds made them generally effective. At last he also won financial freedom. Early in 1859 the college was sold at auction; the buyer was a friend and two months later the institution was turned back to its president free of debt. His death came abruptly in August of the same year before he could enjoy his success. Not, however, before he issued one final phrase worthy of his best. His last speech, a baccalaureate address, closed with the most dramatic line of his life: "Be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity." 33</page></plain_text>
