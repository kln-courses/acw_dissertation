Did you break it, lose it, or do you still have it? If it survived your childhood, have you stored it in a box in the attic, or have you handed it down for other children to enjoy? Has your favorite toy passed the test of time like Mr. Potato Head or Lincoln Logs have, or has it faded into a memory like Spirograph or Chatty Cathy? Whether it was a doll, car, puzzle, or game, the toys we enjoyed as children (or as adults, parents, and grand- parents) evoke fond memories. Revisit your own playtime memories at the Wisconsin Historical Museum's new exhibit, Toy Stories, which highlights many of the best-selling toys from the 1940s to the 1990s.

Record your own personal recollections or try out modern versions of some of the toys in an open play area. View old print advertisements and television commercials from the 1950s through the 1970s and recall the days when the toys were new and popular.

Wright was originally inspired by his father's Imperial Hotel in Tokyo, which employed the same design concept. 1916 [i TINKERTOYS-Charles Pajeau and Robert Pettit formed Toy Tinkers, Inc. and soon introduced Tinker Toys. The idea for the toys originated with Pajeau, who had noticed children playing with pencils and empty spools. 1914 in CRAYOLA CRAYONS-Edwin Binney and his cousin, Harold Smith, inherited a pigment manufacturing company from Bin- ney's father. They named the company Binney &amp; Smith and became famous for their award-winning dark black pigment. Crayola Crayons were created to solve the problem of messy ink markers used to label inventory. The company mixed its famous black pig- ment with wax to create crayons and wrapped them in paper sleeves to keep the user clean. 1903 50 www.wisconsinhistory.org</page><page sequence="2">WISCONSIN MAGAZINE OF HISTORY WHS Museum 1980.199.2 WI SLINKY-When Richard James, a mechanical engineer, acciden- tally knocked a torsion spring off his desk, he was amazed when it bounced and began to "walk." The simple metal toys on the shelf looked unappealing, so James convinced Gimbel's department store to let him demonstrate. He sold out his entire inventory that afternoon. 1945 i METAL DOLL HOUSE-Post WW 11, girls were presented with toys that encouraged housekeeping and motherhood. This doll- house is a modern take on a 1766-style house as indicated by the "'cornerstone" on one of its walls. 1950s W ELECTRIC FOOTBALL-Tudor Metal Products survived the Depression making toy banks. When the founder's son, Norman Sas, took over in the late 1940s, he introduced Electric Football, the first electric toy. The game was improved over the years and enjoyed long-term popularity until video games brought its heyday to an end. 1970 WiJ. 1. CASE COMPANY TRACTORCYCLE-Jerome I. Case's threshing machine business in Racine, Wisconsin, introduced its first gasoline tractors in 1895. The tractorcycle, made by Eska Company of Dubuque, Iowa, is an example of Case's Model VA cul- tivator. It was stocked by farm equipment dealers who sometimes held races with them to attract business. 1951-1954 5"PALADIN" FIGURE AND "JIM HARDIE" HORSE-Popular "horse &amp; rider" sets were the first new products manufactured by Hartland Plastics in Hartland, Wisconsin, after Charles Caestecker acquired it around 1951. Hartland soon had licenses for characters from most of the major Western television shows. The Paladin figure, played by Richard Boone in the TV show Have Gun- Will Travel and the horse from Tales of Wells Fargo are pictured. 1957-1963 WHS Museum 2006.86.1.&amp;.2 WHS Museum 2005.129.44.1 ., I~ ~ ~ ~~1 ru~~~~ ~H Mueu 1953. :.w ,i WH ueu 9426 ht b nra ofa WINTER 2006-2007 51</page><page sequence="3">WISCONSIN MAGAZINE OF HISTORY -' ~~~~~~~~~-c; r Hi G I ( H T I.. .....i"p _ _ _- II AKE OVEN WHS Museum 1978.41,A-H WHS Museum 1985.132.5 ri EASY-BAKE OVEN-In the early 1960s, the Kenner toy com- pany wanted a different toy for girls who primarily had been offered dolls up to that point. Although toy stoves were sold for more than a hundred years, they were not operable. Now, with a light bulb as a heat source and specially-measured mixes, girls could bake real cakes and cookies. 1964 lio VIEWMASTER-Hand-held stereoscopes had been around for 80 years when Sawyer's Inc. introduced its new and improved version at the 1939 New York World Fair. William Gruber, an ama- teur stereoscope view photographer, replaced black and white pho- tos on a card with 16mm color movie film mounted on a disc. Within one year Sawyer's designed a viewer and a method for manufactur- ing the discs. This "talking" version further enhanced the viewers' experience. 1973 lii LITTLE PEOPLE AIRPORT PLAY SET- Fisher-Price had their first success with "people-shaped" toys in 1959. The play set featured a school bus with little wooden people-cylindrical in shape with no limbs. In 1965, the company settled on wide bodies with a peg base, first made of wood, then plastic. Play sets have taken many forms over the decades, from circuses and amusement parks to hotels and airports like the one pictured here. 1972-1976 A1 F_ F_ RPRC WHS Museum 1977.66.4 52 www.wi scon sinhis to ry. org</page><page sequence="4">WISCONSIN MAGAZINE OF HISTORY WHS Museum 2006.94.40 F2 STAR WARS FIGURES-Kenner Toys took a risk in 1977 when it produced a line of action figures based on the George Lucas film, Star Wars. The figures were much smaller than those produced for boys in the past, like G. I. Joe. It was also the first set of action figures that motivated boys to act out scenes from a movie, rather than from their own imaginations. These figures are from the first three movies in the Star Wars series. 1977-1983 -I EVEL KNIEVEL SCRAMBLE VAN-Evel Knievel and his Motor- cycle Daredevils performed their first show on January 3,1966, in Indio, California. It was a huge hit, and he continued to jump even though his performances resulted in serious injury. The Evel Knievel action figure had a bendable body so it could stay on the popular stunt cycle during death-defying jumps. 1973 i TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES, DONATELLO-The anthropomorphic turtles-trained to be skilled ninja warriors- made their comic book debut in 1984. The comics became a popu- lar cartoon that inspired the action figures first sold in 1988. The four turtles, including Donatello shown here, and six other characters were popular. Three feature-length movies boosted their sales. 1988-1996 151 MY LITTLE PONY-With brightly-colored bodies and brush- able hair, My Little Pony characters were irresistible to the little girls who played with them throughout the 80s. Movies were later produced with the ponies and other fanciful characters, including winged ponies, sea ponies, and unicorns. 1980s If You Go The Toy Stories exhibit runs from October 17 through May 26, 2007, at the Wisconsin Historical Museum, 30 N.
