<plain_text><page sequence="1">MYSTICISM AND PERSONALITY JOHN WRIGHT BUCKHAM Pacific School of Religion In a critical though generous review of my little book Mysticism and Modern Life' Miss Evelyn Underhill finds in it "traces of that defective conception which mars nearly all modern writing on mysticism, with the exception of Baron von Hilgel's great and noble work-the conception which regards man as the first term and God as the second term, and which studies the mystical process with a view to the profit which man's soul can get from it, in the way of illumination, peace, strength, holiness." The emphasis in my pages lies, she asserts not untruly, "rather on self-fulfilment than on self-surrender." I plead guilty; yet hold that self-fulfilment has as true a place in mysticism as self-surrender. The two attitudes are not hostile but complementary. Mysticism has much to teach us concerning personality and much to give us in building up personal life. It seems to be becoming clearer, as the study of mysticism is related more closely to psychol- ogy and to philosophy, that neither mysticism nor personality can be understood except as they are seen in the light which they shed upon each other. There are two more or less dis- tinct types of mysticism as respects their attitude toward personality, which may be loosely termed personal and imper- sonal mysticism. Which is the truer ? I The type of mysticism which, judged by its concepts and expressions, is predominantly impersonal, or at least semi- personal, is hoary with antiquity and yet new every morning and fresh every evening. Indian mysticism in many of its 1 Harvard Theological Review, IX (April, 1916), 234 ff. 6o8</page><page sequence="2">MYSTICISM AND PERSONALITY 609 phases is of this type, as are also neo-Platonism, Spinozism, New England transcendentalism, and the cosmic mysticism and health mysticism of the present day. So strong and widely prevalent have been the monistic and pantheistic forms of mysticism as to lead to the assumption that mysticism itself inherently tends toward impersonalism. The frequent occurrence in Plotinus, Dionysius, Erigena, Jacob Boehme, and even in Eckhard and later mystics, of such terms as the Abyss, the Absolute, Nothingness, the All, the Beyond, gives the impression that mysticism itself has no higher concepts than these for Ultimate Reality, and that it will inevitably emerge in this dim and empty shadow land. Yet impressive in volume as is the stream of impersonal mysticism, the purer, stronger current is that of personal mysticism. Christian mysticism was originally and has remained prevailingly personal. Jesus was the outstanding personal mystic of history and so communicated his impulse to his followers that it has never been lost. The mysticism of the Seer of the Fourth Gospel and of Paul, in spite of its profoundly reflective and speculative character, is deeply personal. So also is that of Augustine's Confessions, of St. Francis, of Bernard of Clairvaux, of Eckhard, A Kempis, of Luther, Wesley, Newman, Bushnell, Henry Ward Beecher, Tyrrell, Phillips Brooks, and of myriads of humble mystics in all lands who have been, as Jesus said they would be, the salt of the earth. It is true that Christianity has had also its mystics of the impersonal or semi-personal type, but they are the exceptions. Indeed so distinctively personal is Christian mysticism that it might seem as if no significant personal mysticism were to be found outside its pale.' But such is not the case, as Pro- fessor Pratt has recently reminded us: X George Tyrrell exaggerated the contrast between Christian and Oriental mys- ticism in this regard when he wrote: "Heaven and earth are not more asunder than Oriental and Christian mysticism; the one looking to nonentity as the summum bonum, the other to the fulness of infinite existence."-Letters, p. 46.</page><page sequence="3">6Io THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION The majority of Indian mystics have not been adherents of Shan- kara's monistic Vedanta but have belonged to the great bhakti schools whose emphasis has always been upon personality. The probability is that the great majority of mystics taken first and last have been very far from pantheistic; and there is nothing in the nature of mysticism which logically involves, or necessarily results in, a loss of belief in personality, either human or divine.' II The mystical experience, broadly interpreted, leads by its very nature to the heart of personality. The "Awakening" arouses and heightens the consciousness of personality in the experient. With the dawn of the mystical life the self awakens and for the first time becomes fully aware, with a kindling of joy and gratitude, of its own higher powers and possibilities. And at each stage of the Mystic Way the self becomes more deeply and reverently conscious of itself and more expert in the exercise of its expanding capacities. It is quite true that this experience is in a sense an unself- ing, a self-losing, a submersion of the lower self, but only in order that the true self may come into full control and advance Higher yet and higher Out of clouds and night, Nearer yet and nearer, Rising to the light. Not only does the mystical experience awaken and develop selfhood, it opens the channels to other selves and makes possible the truest and deepest personal communion. There is some- thing mystical in all real and intimate personal intercourse when it rises above the merely physical and gregarious level. Companionship is mystical, friendship is mystical, love is mystical, community life is mystical. There is in each an indefinable something which gives the sense of sacredness, of reality, of finality. He who enters into any genuine, heart- felt relation with another, or with others, is aware, more or 1 The Religious Consciousness, pp. 471, 472.</page><page sequence="4">MYSTICISM AND PERSONALITY 611 less consciously, that in that mutual trust and confidence he comes in touch with a spiritual realm, immortal, invisible, eternal. He is no longer a mere creature of circumstance, a congeries of sensations and instincts, much less an epiphenome- non. He is a self among selves, a member of the Great Community, a citizen of the eternal republic of God. The ties which he feels weaving themselves about him are as mystical as they are human and as divine as they are human. III Yet intimately personal as is the mystical experience in relation to one's self and other selves, when it comes to the Supreme Reality the mystic is supposed to leave the confined limits of personality and lose himself in the abyss of the Absolute. Such, at least, is the impression which much of the literature of mysticism gives. If one would be "far ben" in mystical experience, he must-so the assumption runs- surrender all consciousness of self and be absorbed in pure being, which itself transcends all attributes of personality. Thus personality is swallowed up of the Absolute, which, when it is finished, proves to be Nothing. So far from this being the real consummation, I think it can be shown (i) that this impersonalism is not the purest or most characteristic form of mysticism and (2) that it is a misinterpretation of a certain phase of the mystical experience instead of a true rendering of the experience itself. In the presence of the Supreme Reality there is a loss of isolation and a self-absorption of imperfect selfhood, but the true self is rather found than lost in coming into touch with the Infinite. Perhaps no account of the mystical experience comes nearer to its essence than that it is the sense of Presence.' In his recent exceptionally sane and balanced discussion of ' Rufus M. Jones, e.g., defines mysticism as "consciousness of the Divine Pres- ence."-Studies in Mystical Religion, Preface, p. xv.</page><page sequence="5">612 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION mysticism in The Religious Consciousness Professor Pratt calls attention to this consciousness of Presence in mysticism and says of it: Even if it be granted that the mystic's idea of God's presence is always due to social education, the intensity of the experience that God is present is hardly to be accounted for so easily. If we may trust the mystic's word at all, the experience is a very different thing from the idea; and while, very possibly, the idea must be there before the experi- ence can come, something else must be there too.' In the mind of the mystic who is engaged in a creative task, this sense of Presence becomes a consciousness of divine co-operation which by no means suppresses the sense of the freedom of the autonomous self, but rather heightens it. My Lord is large, my Lord is strong, Giving He gave: my me is mine. How poor, how strange, how wrong, To deem He wrote the little song I made to Him with love's unforced design.2 Here enters the consummate paradox of mysticism-duality in unity-the branch in the vine, Self in self, "I live, yet not I," Lost in God, In Godhead found.3 By testimony of the most profound mystics, love is the crown of the mystical life, the bond of perfectness of the unitive life; and love requires a duality of selves in order to be love. It is duality in unity. Personality comes to its highest realization in the supreme mutuality of giving and receiving. It is a mistake to call this absorption, if by absorp- tion is meant loss of either person-human or divine-in the relationship. It is not absorption but union. It might be shown, I think, that much of what certain of the mystics have to say which looks like pure impersonalism is rather an attempt to transcend the restrictions of individualism. Individuality is essential to human personality; but not to SPages 451-52. 2 Sidney Lanier. 3 Bronson Alcott.</page><page sequence="6">MYSTICISM AND PERSONALITY 613 divine Personality. Supreme Personality is necessary to true mysticism-as any adequate representation of it reveals. Professor Leuba, e.g., defines mysticism as "an experience taken to mean contact (not through the senses but "immedi- ately") or union of the self with a larger-than-self; be it called the Spirit-World, God, or the Absolute."' If this definition is examined it will be seen to involve personality as a pre- cedent condition. For a "larger-than-self" which was im- personal would not be larger but a less-than-self. The only true larger-than-self is a Larger Self. The constant endeavors on the part of mystics to reach an Absolute, a Whole, the One, are often attempts, not to get away from selfhood, but to find a Supreme Self large enough to be free from the limitations which attach to anthropomorphic conceptions. That these attempts to escape anthropomorphism overshoot the mark, as they do, is both misinterpretation and misfortune, but the motive should not be misunderstood. IV But what of Nature mysticism? Is not the personal element wholly absent from this form of mysticism ? Is not Nature mysticism communion with the impersonal ? On the contrary there is no such thing as communion with pure nature; for Nature does not exist apart from mind.2 Minds commune through Nature, not with Nature. It is because Nature is so rich and varied and marvelous a medium for the intercourse of the mind with itself, with other minds and with Other Mind, that we imagine that we are communing with Nature herself when we are merely using natural forms as symbols of personal realities. There is no meaning, anywhere, except to minds. Nature is mediate, not ultimate. The moment Nature ceases to be medium it ' Journal of Philosophy (February 3, 1921), p. 6o. 2This of course is far from saying that Nature has no existence. That may exist which does not and cannot exist independently.</page><page sequence="7">614 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION becomes mud. To possess Nature as matter means to lose it as meaning, and so to lose its deepest reality. The mystical approach to Nature inevitably conducts one to Original, Creative Mind,-Primal Love, as that which shines through the order and beauty and teleology that we find in Nature. It is with this Mind, or Presence, that the Nature mystic comes into communion. He reaches through Nature to its Source and with that Source communes. It is "the light that never was on land or sea" that gives radiance to the light that is on land and sea. Light, color, space, form --sun, moon, stars, flowers, mountains, sea-all these are words, signs, symbols, for communing minds. V A striking instance of the transcendence of Nature on the part of a great religious Nature mystic is furnished in the study of Richard Jefferies by Edward Ingram Watkin in his recent volume The Philosophy of Mysticism: The mystery, writes Jefferies in The Story of My Heart, and the possibilities are not in the roots of the grass, nor in the depth of things in the sea; they are in my existence, in my soul. .... As time pro- gressed-the need of Nature images became less. It [the prayer] is now less closely associated with the sun and sea, hills, woods or beauteous human shape. It is always within. .... My soul cannot reach to its full desire of prayer. I need no earth, or sea, or sun to think my thought. To Mr. Watkin this means "ascent from intuition of the Divine immanence in Nature to intuition of the Divine transcendence."' He recognizes that Jeffries was unconscious of his own theism but holds that that makes it no less real. Indeed implicit theism is often more vital than explicit theism. True Nature mysticism, in other words, is grounded in the ,divine immanence and passes thence to the divine transcen- ,dence. Nature is thus, for the mystic, the "garment of God" -a garment which, even if he delights in its richly embroidered folds, possesses its true beauty only because it is a vesture, and not an end in itself.

It is easily capable of misinterpretation in terms of impersonality and thus of deflection into channels in which it loses itself in the sands of arid intellectualism or the marsh of sensuous pantheism. But that is not its true nature and end. Christianity keeps mysticism true to its meaning and purpose and so waters it with the river of life that upon its banks there grows the tree of life bearing twelve manner of fruits and yielding its fruit every month. And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.</page></plain_text>
