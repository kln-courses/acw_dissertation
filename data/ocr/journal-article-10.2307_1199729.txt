<plain_text><page sequence="1">NONHUMAN VALUE DONALD WALHOUT* I. THE IDEA OF NONHUMAN VALUE '3HERE are two epistemological prin- Sciples which must underlie any philosophical investigation which can possibly hope to be impartial and comprehensive. The first is that all knowledge is derived from and is an in- terpretation of experience. The second is that such knowledge cannot ipso facto be assumed to refer solely to experience it- self. Without experience there would a fortiori be no knowledge, but only skepticism or arbitrary limitation could confine the import of that knowledge to the contents of experience alone. Our ex- perience thus serves as a mediator to the intellect of what lies beyond our experi- ence. Modern philosophies, in their quest for knowledge about values, have rightly emphasized the first of these principles in preference to some older approaches which proceeded by a priori reasoning exclusively. But, in doing so, they have, on the whole, neglected the second prin- ciple and have become narrower and less universal than the older views. Specifical- ly, modern philosophies, in turning to conscious experience for the discovery of knowledge about values, have tacitly but arbitrarily assumed that such knowledge can have no bearing outside experience or, in other words, that value is the pecul- iar affair of consciousness. A review of recent literature indicates that it is a commonplace to assume that value is confined to human experience-except when, by way of courtesy, license is made for animal consciousness. The idea of nonhuman value, of value characterizing other beings than conscious ones and per- haps characterizing all of being, sounds as antique to modern ears as the clash of knights in medieval armor. Part of the reason for this banishment of nonhuman value is to be found in the necessity of eliminating certain anthropomorphic conceptions from an impartial investiga- tion of nature-a legitimate reason in it- self. Part of the reason lies in the difficul- ty of understanding what nonhuman value means-a doctrine which must be clarified if it is to be maintained. And part of the reason is to be found in man's adoption of himself as the hub of the uni- verse and the measure of all things-an unwarranted reason. Tn any case, of the fact that the banishment has taken place there can be little doubt. However they may differ on other topics, thinkers of all sorts, including many religious writers, seem to take it for granted that value apart from conscious states is a meaning- less notion. The following illustration is only typical, not exceptional: First, value may mean any conscious ex- perience of liking, preferring, or enjoying. Let us call this a value claim.... Secondly, value may mean any conscious experience of liking or preferring which survives critical inquiry into facts, relations, and reasons. Such a value may be called . .. a true value or an ideal value as distinguished from an untested value claim. Both value claims and true values reside solely * Donald Walhout is an instructor in philosophy in the Directed Studies Course in Yale College. He received his undergraduate education at Adrian College (B.A. 1949), after which he pursued gradu- ate study in Yale University, receiving the M.A. degree in 1950 and the Ph.D. degree in 1952. 31</page><page sequence="2">32 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION in conscious experience. Intrinsic value is no property of unconscious things or processes.1 Thus the steps in the banishment of non- human value are clear: value is, first of all, defined in connection with some kind of conscious state rather than in connec- tion with the subject for whom those states exist; and then, since enjoyings and likings and preferrings do not occur in the nonconscious realm, it is conclud- ed that all value resides in that segment of the universe which we call "conscious experience," by which is usually meant human experience. Yet the choice of just this one area as being the sole bearer of value must al- ways be arbitrary, and the burden of proof must lie with those who make this delimitation. The conclusion follows only from the definition of value as consisting in enjoying or liking, which, if it be of- fered as a real and not simply as a stipu- lative definition, can readily be ques- tioned. Indeed, the fact that the writer quoted above does himself distinguish between "value claims" and "true values" indicates that enjoyings and lik- ings cannot themselves be the essential features constituting the nature of value. For some enjoyings and likings are ad- mitted not to be "true values" at all, and hence some other factor must be ap- pealed to which is more determinative of what value consists in and which is the deciding factor in discriminating which likings are "true values" and which are only claims to value. A truer account would find this other essential factor to be certain fulfilments, and particular values to consist in partial contributions to complete self-fulfilment or self-realiza- tion. And, if this be so, there is no rea- son, on such a view, to confine value to human or conscious experience, for other things have a being which can be fulfilled and perfected as well. Short of an all-embracing view such as this, there are three ways of regarding the nonconscious realm of a theory which holds value to exist only in conscious states such as enjoying. The first way is the one already mentioned, where the nonconscious realm is recognized as ex- isting but is denied to have any worth ex- cept as an instrument to human devices. But this view is quite arbitrary and must always have the burden of proof on its own shoulders. The second way is that of the idealist, who denies the existence of nonconscious entities. If, then, nothing existed except what is in conscious expe- rience (human or divine), there would be no problem of interpreting the noncon- scious realm with respect to value. De- spite this metaphysical explanation, however, the realm of sticks and stones, mountains and molehills, remains just as stubborn and "real"; and these things are quite different from conscious states such as enjoying. So the problem of relat- ing the "nonconscious" realm value-wise to conscious states would still remain. The third way is found in the theory which recognizes the so-called "noncon- scious world" but which holds that there is a kind of consciousness which charac- terizes even this realm. This is the view of panpsychism held by Leibniz and Whitehead. If, then, all entities could be said to be in some sense conscious organ- isms, it could be maintained both that all value resides in conscious states and that the value characterizes all of reality. But sooner or later it must again be recog- nized that sticks and stones, mountains and molehills, are different from human conscious states; so, in order to explain the kind of value which characterizes nonhuman entities, a theory is required which does not fall into the anthropo- morphic conceptions involved in defining value as enjoying, liking, pleasure, etc.</page><page sequence="3">NONHUMAN VALUE 33 Even if these last two metaphysical the- ories-idealism and panpsychism-were correct, therefore, the problem would still remain of interpreting, from a valua- tional point of view, the relation between the realm, which in common life is called the "nonconscious," and the realm of conscious experience. Accordingly, there seem to be only two alternatives left: one of these is the first view mentioned, where the nonconscious is denied to have value; the other view is the one we have suggested, which holds the opposite. Since the first of these is inevitably ar- bitrary, we are apparently required, as a matter of logic, to accept the second. But how can a doctrine of nonhuman value be made more specific? The interpretation of nonhuman values is most easily done in the case of animal consciousness, for here the analo- gy drawn from human experience is readily applicable. If human values con- sist in certain fulfilments-fulfilments of basic needs, on the one hand, and of cer- tain creative faculties whose fulfilment gives rise to values over and above the satisfaction of needs, on the other hand-- and have self-fulfilment as their ground, it is clear that values for animals can be explained in a similar manner, except that freedom, creativity, and inventive- ness are apparently not present to such a marked degree. Nevertheless, there are some things which are "good for" them and contribute to the perfection of which they are capable, and other things which hinder them and injure their fulfilment. Hence the same sort of analysis of value and disvalue, as constituted by relational situations, which describes the nature of human values, is also applicable, mutatis mutandis, and by analogy, to animal ex- perience. The difficulty comes, however, in try- ing to understand the significance of value when we discuss the nonconscious realm. Perhaps the best introduction to this topic can be gotten from considering a prominent instance of the relation be- tween the human world, where everyone agrees value to be present, and the non- conscious world, about which many peo- ple are in doubt as to its value, except as a human instrument. Such a prominent instance of this relation is to be found in the work of manual labor. And I can do no better at this point than to quote from Professor Tillich's penetrating discussion of the mutuality involved in this relation of work: Personality and thing are united in the "work" in which the power of the thing is dis- covered and affirmed by the personality and in which the power of the personality is imprinted on the thing. This mutual reception of the personality by the thing and of the thing by the personality means the "fulfilment" of both of them. In creative work the actual freedom of personality and the potential nature of freedom are united. The personal power of self-de- termination and the determined power of things meet in the form of our work. This is the ethical justification of a full devotion to work, even if it implies the surrender of a fully developed cultural personality. But a sacrifice is also demanded of things: for the sake of a higher unity in which they are forced to enter, they must be restricted in their own natural power. This sacrifice laid upon things in every human dealing with them corresponds to the sacrifice laid upon the personality in every creative work. Both have to give up some of their potential power in order to reach a higher, actual power by entering a new creation.... What must be said generally about the rela- tionship between personality and thing [is] that it is, in principle, a mutual service. The true work is a mutual fulfilment, the false work, a mutual violation of personality and thing.2 Thus in work not only are nonhuman things values for human fulfilment but human beings are values for the fulfil- ment of which these things are capable. How else can we interpret the signifi- cance of the patience with which the lov-</page><page sequence="4">34 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION ing gardener tends each flower, the care which the scullery monk exercises in do- ing his dishes, the pride which the work- man takes in his "perfect" tools, or the submission which the artist undergoes to his materials irrespective of publicity? Not only is value realized for these per- sons, and for the other persons served by the material "goods," but the things themselves reach more fully the achieve- ment of their essential nature. And no ar- bitrary fiat can justify the declaration that there are no values for these entities or, in other words, that situations in which their being is more fully perfected have no value or significance apart from human designs. The value is not con- sciously apprehended, but it is the value of fulfilment and perfection of things and hence is analogous in kind to human value. II. GOODNESS AND BEING-ST. THOMAS In discussing value as fulfilment of be- ing, it may be helpful to begin with Thomas. According to Thomas, value or goodness means what is desirable, that is, what beings really desire by their very nature as distinguished from particular wishes and passions which the term "de- sire" has come to signify. Now what every being desires is its own perfection. Hence goodness consists in perfection. "The essence of goodness consists in this, that it is in some way desirable. .... Now it is clear that a thing is desirable only in so far as it is perfect, for all desire their own perfection."3 But what does Thomas mean by perfection? He means simply actuality, the simple act of being, as dis- tinguished from privation or nonbeing. Everything is perfect so far as it is actual. Therefore it is clear that a thing is perfect so far as it is being; for being is the actuality of every thing. .. . Hence it is clear that goodness and being are the same reality. But goodness expresses the aspect of desirableness, which being does not express.4 Goodness means perfection; perfection means, simply, being; therefore goodness and being are one. Omne ens qua ens est bonum. But what is of interest to us, however, in Thomas' account of goodness as per- fection is the way he specifies the nature of this perfection when characterizing not being as such but rather particular beings. This he does as follows: Now perfection in a thing is threefold: first, according to the constitution of its own being; secondly, in respect of any accidents being added as necessary for its own perfect operation; thirdly, perfection consists in the attaining to something else as the end.5 These three aspects of perfection in a thing may be illustrated by a watch. A watch is, first of all, perfect if it conforms to the essential nature of a watch- if in its structure it embodies the essence of watchness. Second, if the watch runs smoothly and efficiently, it is perfect in respect of its operation. Third, the watch is perfect if it completely fulfils some other end for which it is designed, name- ly, in this case, the good of man. Thus the two fundamental notions of goodness as the perfection of a thing are those of "good in itself" and "good for." A watch may be "good in itself" either by fulfilling the type of watchness or by operating smoothly and efficiently. And it may be "good for" man by serving his needs. The latter notion, that of "good for" with respect to man, refers to a relational situation wherein the watch is a value through serving man's need. Such values come under the category of human value, which is not our concern here. We are in- terested, rather, in the notions of "good for" and "good in itself" with respect to nonhuman things themselves.</page><page sequence="5">NONHUMAN VALUE 35 To begin with, a thing does not reach its fulfilment through its own power alone. Hence the fulfilment or perfection of the thing cannot be said to reside sole- ly in the being of the thing taken in iso- lation, and its more unrelated actuality. A thing is what it is and can fulfil its na- ture only through and by virtue of other beings which sustain it. A watch can be a perfect watch, in structure and opera- tion, only because of the watchmaker who made it and the jeweler who repairs it. Even when the watch is thus fash- ioned, its form and its running can be kept perfect only through the owner who cares for and winds it, through the natu- ral surroundings which preserve rather than destroy it, through the persistency of each part, etc. Just as man cannot achieve self-fulfilment (cannot, for that matter, achieve the highest good on any theory) save through relations to the ob- jective conditions of fulfilment, so, too, the nonconscious thing cannot become perfect and fulfil its being apart from the objective realities which sustain its being. For this reason we shall have to con- clude that, if goodness has perfection or fulfilment as its ground, then it will not be correct to say that a thing is "good in itself" (i.e., good in and through itself). There is no goodness in the thing taken as a bare, isolated unity. It is not the mere act of being, the simple actuality of a thing, which constitutes goodness or value. Rather goodness arises only in re- lations of the thing to those other reali- ties which sustain and fulfil the thing in question. Hence the fundamental notion here is that of "good for." Later we shall attempt to give some meaning to the concept of "good in itself." But, as far as we are here concerned, we shall have to say that the only goodness which is to be found in the relational situations of ful- filment is to be located in the "good for- ness" which some objects have through sustaining and fulfilling other things. If those other things are "good in them- selves," that will require another rela- tional justification, as we shall see later. Thus an oak fulfils its potentialities, a knife becomes a perfect knife, a work of art is made unique, only through the sus- tenance of the external realities which are "good for" them. And, in each case, value arises in the multiplicity of these relations of fulfilment. If a thing could exist all by itself, in undisturbed unity, and out of relation to anything else, then it would simply "be," and that is all that can be said. There would be no value or disvalue involved. Such an entity could not even be perfect of its kind or conform to a type; for, if that entity were the only thing which had being, there would be no type or essence apart from itself to which it could conform. But if there were a separate type or essence to which such an entity could conform, then immedi- ately a relation would be set up, so that the goodness in the situation would con- sist not in the mere isolated actuality of the thing but in the value which the es- sence had for the entity through serving it as a model. Evidently, then, we can speak of values applying to the nonconscious realm in similar terms to those employed in describing human value. The main point is that the perfection or fulfilment of a thing does not characterize that thing thought of as an isolated, abstract unity. Hence if ultimate perfection or fulfilment stands as the ground for par- ticular ascriptions of value, then good- ness arises only in the relations of a given entity to those other realities which sus- tain and fulfil it. In these relations the sustaining realities are "good for" the thing in question-they are its values.</page><page sequence="6">36 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION Thus nonconscious things have their values just as do human beings. Accordingly, we can accept the Tho- mistic view that goodness or value has perfection as its ground. But we must deny that this goodness consists in the simple act of being, the mere actuality of a thing thought of as an abstract, unre- lated unity. It is not the simple beingness of a thing which makes it good. An un- differentiated, unrelated being, even God, would only be a unity, with no goodness involved. A thing is good only by virtue of relations to other beings which it is "good for" or else by relation to that with reference to which it may, through mediation, be said to be "good in itself," if that be true. III. INDIVIDUALS AND TYPES This interpretation also allows us to overcome another difficulty which besets the Thomistic theory of goodness. This difficulty arises from its natural philoso- phy, which does not account for the mod- ification and evolution of types and spe- cies in the natural world. It is assumed that there are fixed, immutable types and species in nature to which individuals can conform. Thus the goodness of a thing, for example, an oak, is said to consist in the mere actuality of the oak, simply by virtue of the fact that it is a representa- tive or embodiment of the type or species of oak. Individuals may come and go, but there is no possibility in this conception for the modification or alteration of fun- damental types and species themselves. There are fixed orders of creation, and among these are permanent created spe- cies. A thing is perfect in being, and hence good, simply because it exists and is the embodiment of its immutable type or species. Thomas expounds this view as follows: Everything is said to be good so far as it is perfect;... Now a thing is said to be perfect if it lacks nothing according to the mode of its perfection. But since everything is what it is by its form, . . . in order for a thing to be perfect and good it must have a form, together with all that precedes and follows upon that form.... But the form itself is signified by the species, for everything is placed in its species by its form .... Hence the essence of goodness, so far as it consists in perfection, consists also in limit, species, and order.6 Thus fixed, unchangeable species and im- mutable orders of creation are presup- posed. The individual, in acquiring form, takes its destined place in the species or type. And the individual is good by vir- tue of so doing, by virtue of conforming to the unchangeable type. Yet there is nothing in a theory of goodness as consisting in perfection or fulfilment which requires that it be de- fined in terms of the conformity of a thing to permanent types or species and immutable orders of creation. And, con- versely, if such a notion of immutable na- ture conflicts with scientific and meta- physical interpretations of evolution and process, as apparently it does, then there is positive reason to define goodness otherwise. We have defined perfection not as con- formity to a static type or essence or spe- cies but as the fulfilment of a thing's es- sential being through relations to other beings which sustain and complete it. And by "essential being" we mean sim- ply the necessary characters and power of a thing which constitute its identity of being, without which it would not have its being and in the absence of which it would be destroyed rather than fulfilled in its identity and individuality. Thus perfection applies primarily to individu- als rather than to types and species. Indi- viduality is the primary locus of fulfil- ment. To be sure, part of what we mean</page><page sequence="7">NONHUMAN VALUE 37 by a thing's fulfilment is its full embodi- ment of its species. For instance, a par- ticular oak fulfils its essential being only by fully embodying the species of oak. But this relation of species to oak is only one factor constituting and maintaining the particular oak's identity. The type has value for the oak as a model. But the oak also has many other relations to other things which determine and sup- port its essential being and individuality -the acorn, the surrounding elements, the forester, etc. Goodness consists not in the static conformity of the oak to its type but in all these things which sustain and fulfil the being of the oak. Only through this multiplicity of relations is the oak preserved and fulfilled in its es- sential being and individuality. Thus species and orders can change with the changes of creativity. Yet each new spe- cies and each individual which arises can have a fulfilment which is peculiar to it- self. No matter if species change, no mat- ter how temporal and fleeting a thing may be by its own nature, each thing has an excellence and fulfilment of which it is capable. This is not to say that there are hidden and mysterious entelechies in things which are striving and driving to- ward fixed ends within those things. We are only challenging the arbitrary deci- sion that value has no significance for the nonconscious realm but is limited in sig- nificance and meaning to man. And we are doing so by maintaining that the mere fact that a thing has being indicates that there is a fulfilment of which it is capable and that there are values for it, namely, those realities which nourish, sustain, and fulfil its being. IV. EVIL But at this point two difficulties seem to confront us. The first is this: Value has been said to consist in relations between things such that the one sustains and ful- fils the other. For example, the grass is "good for" the cow through contributing to its fulfilment. But if goodness consists in that which sustains and fulfils, then evil must be that which hinders and de- stroys a thing's being. So, although the grass is a value for the cow, the cow in turn is a means for destroying the being of the grass. Hence it would seem that our view would force us to maintain that no good can be done without a corre- sponding amount of evil. Good and evil are, then, always equal. So instead of there being mutual fulfilment, as we were saying earlier, there is always destruc- tion, and every being must always return complete evil for the good done to it. The resolution of this difficulty is to be found in the nature of finite things. It cannot be the essential nature of a finite thing to be eternal, to transcend itself continually to infinity, to dwell in its own self-containment. It must be the essen- tial nature of a finite being either to lose its being or to be transformed. Therefore, while the individuality of the grass is transformed in the cow, its essential be- ing is not destroyed, for its essential being is to be finite. When the grass ac- quires its full nutritive powers and then enters into the nourishment of the cow, the grass has achieved as much excellence and perfection as its essential finite na- ture allows it. The grass unites with the cow in a new creation and hence achieves the maximum fulfilment of which it is capable. If it did not do this, the grass would wither and die and so would fall short of what it could become through entering into the new produc- tion. The essence of a finite thing, there- fore, must be defined in part by the po- tentialities it has for completing its finite- ness through entering into and sustaining new creations. Thus the cow is also</page><page sequence="8">38 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION "good for" the grass in that it provides the means by which the grass can com- plete the limited kind of fulfilment which is possible to it by its finite nature. It must be admitted, however, that this explanation of mutuality cannot be said to hold in all cases. For, while the grass might achieve a higher fulfilment by entering into the nourishment of the cow instead of simply withering away, and while a brick might achieve a higher perfection by losing its individuality in the construction of a new edifice, we could hardly say, for instance, that a community reaches its highest fulfilment by contributing to the perfect function- ing of an avalanche or that a missionary achieves his self-fulfilment by entering into the production of a well-developed cannibal. If we did say that, it would amount to saying that every de facto re- lation between beings is ipso facto a re- ciprocal relation of value; and, if this were true, there would be no problem of valuation and, furthermore, no evil. The truth is, however, that, in addition to the mutual fulfilments we have suggested, there is in some relations of fulfilment a preponderance of evil for the contribu- tory thing in question, and in other cases an equality of good and evil for it. In- deed, even in those cases of mutual ful- filment there is probably a certain amount of evil which always accom- panies it. The grass, in fulfilling its finite nature by entering into a more fully de- veloped cow, also receives evil to the ex- tent that it loses the perfection of its in- dividual peculiarities and characteristics; the cow, in being slaughtered for man, may enter into a more important fulfil- ment, but it also receives evil to the ex- tent that its individuality is sacrificed; etc. Nevertheless, the only point we were insisting upon in answering the difficulty above was that a being, in serving as a value for another, need not receive an equal or total amount of evil in return. There may be mutual fulfilment in the re- lation. And, where evil does accompany mutual fulfilment, it need not be in pre- ponderance over the good involved. Fur- thermore, it is precisely those situations where the returned evil is in preponder- ance, where the being serving as a value finds in its mission complete disvalue for itself, which are the situations we seek to avoid in moral action. It is because em- pirically we do not discover mutual ful- filment in such situations that we try to eliminate and avoid them. Some of those situations, however, are required because of the importance of the fulfilment of the one being-and here is involved the ne- cessity of sacrifice. Other of those situa- tions we simply do not have the power to prevent-and here is involved the reality of evil. But it was not our intention to deny either the necessity of sacrifice or the reality of evil. Our only point has been that in situations of fulfilment there need not be a total return of evil for good, of destruction for fulfilment. There can be mutual fulfilment. And, where sacri- fice is required, there can be mutual sacrifice. The second difficulty is this: The ful- filment of some beings is not good but evil. Parasites, for instance, fulfil their individuality only at the expense of de- stroying their prey and with no other functi6n in view except further destruc- tion. To say that such fulfilments are good would be to call good what most people in their right mind would call evil -a strange doctrine indeed. Goodness, therefore, cannot consist in fulfilment. In reply, it must be said, in the first place, that we are not intending to deny that there is natural evil just because we are affirming that there is natural good. The parasite is indeed evil and destruc-</page><page sequence="9">NONHUMAN VALUE 39 tive to the beings on which it preys. Tt apparently does not even unite, like the grass, with other beings in the production of higher creations.' Yet it must be re- membered that we are so far considering only the nature of value for individual things. No matter how destructive a parasite may be, therefore, still its own fulfilment constitutes value for itself. The prey which it eats is thus a good for the parasite. The fact that the primary relation of the parasite to the prey is one of destruction and evil does not prove that fulfilment is not the ground of indi- vidual value. Rather it indicates that some fulfilments must be repressed when we come to consider the ground of value for all beings taken together and when we decide what kinds of action to adopt to- ward values. V. OBJECTIVE VALUES? So far we have been maintaining that, just as the ground for human value is total self-fulfilment, so value for noncon- scious things consists in their fulfilment. Such fulfilment, however, is to be found not in the simple unrelated unity of the thing but in the other beings and realities which sustain the thing and which consti- tute values for it. Thus values can be said to arise only in situations which are relational in character. Goodness or value occurs in relations such that one being fulfils another. Evil or disvalue oc- curs in relations in which one thing hin- ders or destroys another. The ground or warrant for saying whether the other re- alities are good or bad is whether or not they contribute to the ultimate fulfil- ment and perfection of the essential be- ing of the thing in question. How do the terms "subjective," "ob- jective," and "relational" apply? In the first place, the value situation is always, from any perspective, relational. The re- lation may hold between two objects, so that the one sustains and fulfils the other. Or the relation may be between an object and a person, so that in this case the per- sonally subjective element is a value for the object, just as with human values ob- jects are values for selves. But in addition to being relational in character, these nonhuman value situa- tions are also objective. Two senses of "objective" are relevant here. In the first sense, "objective" means "not constitut- ed by or modified by relation to any out- side, judging subject." This may be called "perspectival" objectivity. In the second sense, "objective" means "exist- ing independently of all consciousness." This may be called "transphenomenal"8 objectivity. Now, when nonhuman value situations are actually realized, they are, of course, from the viewpoint of any out- side human judge of them, perspectival- ly objective. Perspectival objectivity is, therefore, a correct description in all cases, provided we understand that what is objective is not a property but an en- tire relational situation. The second sense of "objective" is also applicable, but in a somewhat more restricted way. That is, when both elements in the rela- tion exist independently of consciousness, then that value situation is entirely transphenomenal and may be said to be totally objective in this second sense; however, when the value for the nonhu- man object is itself a person, we can say that the value situation is only partially transphenomenal and hence only partial- ly objective in this second sense. The idea of subjectivity, finally, cannot be added as another description of nonhuman values, except on a panpsychist theory. Nonhuman values are, in short, both relational and objective in the senses specified. An implication of this view is that</page><page sequence="10">40 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION value judgments with respect to noncon- scious values are cognitive. Furthermore, they are both descriptive and normative. They describe and prescribe that certain things, values or disvalues, do or do not, would or would not, fulfil the essential nature of another being. And the ground or warrant for the validity or invalidity of the judgments is the ultimate fulfil- ment or perfection of the being in ques- tion. VI. THE GROUND OF VALUE But the ultimate norm or ground of value cannot be given in terms solely of the value for individuals. Even though the warrant for discriminating values from disvalues for individual entities consists in their self-fulfilment, we must go beyond this in stating the norm for all value. For individuals are intimately re- lated to each other: they limit each other, enhance each other, press upon each other, or complement each other. Hence the ground of value for the whole cannot be given as the sum of individual fulfil- ments. Just as in the case of human value a thing cannot be finally said to be good or evil by virtue of its conducement to one person's fulfilment alone, but must be referred to the harmonious perfecting of the community of selves, so in the case of all beings whatsoever, taken together, a thing cannot be finally said to be good or evil by reference to one entity alone which it is good for but must be reckoned in connection with the totality of inter- related beings. We are thus brought back again to the idea of harmony among per- fected beings, for surely, when we judge something to be good or evil, we presup- pose that it will conduce to the harmony and integration of the related beings rather than to their disharmony and disintegration. Harmonious perfecting, then, the ultimate situation in which each entity attains as much fulfilment as possible through its relations to the other realities which alone sustain and fulfil it and is at the same time in harmony with all other beings, stands as the final ground or norm for the ascription of value to particular things. The goodness of each for all is the measure of its worth. In this harmonious perfecting of all en- tities in their relations to each other, many beings must be restricted and lim- ited in some of their possible expressions of potentiality. For the sake of a higher unity, a more embracing fulfilment, a new creation, each being must give of its fulfilment to the totality. A nonreligious world view, such as that of Schopen- hauer, would seem in this restriction and confinement an indication of the fact that the world is finally hostile to indi- vidual value, that it is a place of tragedy and despair, and that a cosmos in which such harmony must be the ground of value means that it is indifferent or evil to individual fulfilment and value. A reli- gious world view, on the other hand, such as that of Spinoza, would see in this sacri- fice and limitation the highest fulfilment of which a finite being is capable, in that its contribution is conserved in a purpose not to be identified with the particular purposes and aspirations of the finite en- tities themselves. But, however it be in- terpreted, harmonious perfecting of all realities stands as the presupposed war- rant for judging particular things good or evil. VII. WESTERN AND ORIENTAL THOUGHT- CREATIVITY AND GOD The present account of value has pro- ceeded on two assumptions: first, that it is arbitrary and unjustifiable to maintain that nothing has value except as being good for human beings; second, that a being existing in isolated unity, alone,</page><page sequence="11">NONHUMAN VALUE 41 without relations to anything else, would have no value. Value, then, exists in the relations between things, conscious or nonconscious, such that the one is good for the other through completing and ful- filling the other. The ground for saying that this is value is, for the individual, self-fulfilment and, for the totality of be- ings, the harmonious fulfilment of all. Thus the fundamental notion of value so far considered has been that of being "good for" something, of being contribu- tory to some fulfilment or other. As yet we have not even raised the question of the value of such fulfilment itself. Strictly speaking, we have confined ourselves to what many people would call "instru- mental value," although we have tried to avoid the ambiguous terms "instrumen- tal" and "intrinsic." Yet it is clear that this final and ultimate question now looms large before us, namely: Does ful- filment itself have value? And, if so, how is it to be characterized? From the point of view of Western thought, the answer to this question would be simple enough: self-fulfilment and the harmonious perfecting of all be- ings are intrinsic values, good in them- selves, values for their own sake, and that is all that need be said. As a matter of fact, no matter what theory of value has been held in the West, such a reply has been the simple assumption of all traditional Western thought. Whether value be said to consist in harmony of parts, eudaimonia, the beatific vision, moral virtue, pleasure, interest, survival, or what-not, it has been held that the re- alizations or fulfilments of these are ipso facto intrinsic values, good in themselves. Whatever instrumental values contrib- ute to must a fortiori be intrinsically good when realized or actualized. Thus intrinsic good has always been thought to consist in some kind of realization or ac- tualization or fulfilment rather than the opposite. Such an assumption, however, seem- ingly so self-evident for Western thought, meets a direct antithesis in ori- ental thought. There it is not fulfilment but nonfulfilment, not affirmation of be- ing but negation of being, which is thought to constitute intrinsic value. Yet every major Western tradition-from Aristotle to Paul Weiss in one tradition and from Protagoras to Bertrand Russell in another, to mention only two-auto- matically assumes that, however the good be defined-whether as perfection of nature in the one case cited or as satis- faction of desire in the other-it must necessarily be some actualization or re- alization which makes for intrinsic good. The possibility of negation seldom enters our Western thinking. Yet to the one tra- dition mentioned oriental thought would reply that it is not self-fulfilment and perfection of being but nonfulfilment and negation of being which constituted in- trinsic value; and to the other tradition oriental thought would reply that it is not the satisfaction of personal desire but the extinction of desire which is intrin- sically good. It is clear, therefore, that our task is not done. So far we have suggested that the ground for saying what is good for in- dividuals is their fulfilment and perfec- tion peculiar to them; and for the totality of beings, the ground is the perfecting of each so far as is compatible with har- mony and integration. But if self-fulfil- ment and perfection of being are not themselves good, then negation will be the true ground of value, and our whole discussion will fall to the earth. Accord- ingly, there must be some kind of justifi- cation for saying that such fulfilment is itself good-is better than nonfulfilment. This is a point which has been too much</page><page sequence="12">42 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION neglected, especially by empirical and naturalistic writers. They simply assume that it is some kind of actualization which constitutes intrinsic good and sel- dom even raise the question. The cen- tral question is this: By virtue of what can we say that fulfilment and realization are better than nonfulfilment and nega- tion? In other words, what is the justifi- cation for holding that every being, when fulfilled through those things which are values for it, is, when thus reaching self- fulfilment, itself good rather than not good? The justification cannot be less than metaphysical, for it goes far beyond what any empirical, phenomenological, or even ethical (in the usual sense of the term) analysis can give. Two sorts of justification seem to be possible. The first is found in the idea of creativity, and the second is found in the idea of God. The first involves a world view which maintains that the very na- ture of the world is affirmation and crea- tivity. The second involves a world ground for which the fulfilment and per- fection of things is intrinsically good. The two ideas may, of course, be combined. But, historically, they have not always been so combined. Neitzsche, for in- stance, interpreted the world with crea- tivity but with no God, while Spinoza in- terpreted the world with God but with no creativity. Let us, then, consider these three alternatives in turn: the two ideas and their combination. a) Thinkers as divergent as Nietzsche and Bergson have maintained that the essential nature of the universe is crea- tivity and dynamic development, so that the realization and fulfilment of new be- ings is its inevitable product. If, then, the very forces of the universe are driving to- ward growth and affirmation of new life and new things, a view which held that intrinsic good consisted in negation and nonfulfilment would run counter to the very nature of ourselves and the world at large. For such a view, so it would be ar- gued, would present us with a system of values which is impossible to carry out, since we are inevitably driven toward af- firmation rather than negation. Thus for Nietzsche, since the governing forces in the world are dynamic and creative, in- trinsic value consists in self-transcend- ence, in the transvaluation of all values, in the unrestricted affirmation of the will to power. The central weakness of such a posi- tion, however, is that which Schopen- hauer already pointed out. Just because the driving forces of the universe are dy- namic and creative, it does not necessari- ly follow that intrinsic good consists in such affirmation rather than in negation. The driving forces, surging into novelty, may be indifferent and even ruthless to the products which they leave in their wake. Hence they may run counter to the true good of individuals, namely, extinc- tion. Value cannot ipsofacto be identified with the products of dynamism and growth, except through a question-beg- ging definition which equates the two. Such an attack was in fact the view which Schopenhauer adopted. He recognized that the driving power in the universe was dynamic and affirming, namely, the will to live. But he also held that there was nothing in this which guaranteed that the products of the will to live had value. Hence he concluded that the good consisted in negation and nonfulfilment and advocated the stopping of the will to live through effort and resignation. If this dynamic will to live could not be stopped, this would indicate that the uni- verse is destructive and hostile to true good; not that goodness consists in affir- mation and fulfilment. Mere creativity, then, mere dynamics making for the ful-</page><page sequence="13">NONHUMAN VALUE 43 filments of beings, cannot by itself justify the assertion that such fulfilments are in- trinsically good, intrinsically better than nonfulfilment. b) The other justification for holding that fulfilment is better than nonfulfil- ment is found in the view which main- tains that all things are intrinsically good through their relation to God, who is per- fect. One such conception, which does not employ the principle of creativity, is that which identifies God with the whole of reality. This is the conception to be found in Spinoza and much of recent philosophical idealism. It holds that all fulfilments are good in that they are frag- ments of or embodiments within the Ab- solute, whose total perfection endows each member with goodness by virtue of its harmony and integration into the whole. All fulfilments are intrinsically good because they are constituents with- in the single, perfect, infinite ego. This view, however, is open to two se- rious objections. First, the theory holds that all finite individuals are not realities at all but only appearances. How, then, can the self-fulfilment of every individual being be said to have intrinsic worth if the very meaningfulness of individuals is denied? If individuals are only appear- ances, it is not self-fulfilment but extinc- tion into the Absolute which has intrinsic value for them. Second, such a concep- tion of God, as the all-embracing, all-in- clusive reality, means that the universe is a monistic, undifferentiated unity. But such a being, existing alone in its own unity, unrelated to anything else, could involve neither good nor evil. It would simply "be," and that is all. Such a God could no more serve as the ground for maintaining that fulfilment of individu- als is intrinsically good than could, for in- stance, the oriental Brahman. c) Evidently, then, the two ideas, crea- tivity and God, are both required. Mere dynamics alone can make possible the af- firmation and fulfilment of individuals, but it cannot guarantee that such affir- mation has value. A static conception of God can guarantee intrinsic value only through extinction of individuals. Both doctrines are untenable by themselves as justifications for the belief that self-ful- filled beings, existing in the relation of harmonious perfecting, have intrinsic worth. Creativity without God is blind; God without creativity is empty. Each doctrine, taken separately, could equally well justify the oriental conclusion that intrinsic value consists in negation and nonfulfilment. If, however, the creative principle and the value principle are one, if there is a being which at once allows for the affirmation and uniqueness of indi- viduals and guarantees that such fulfil- ment is good rather than evil, we shall have a final justification for denying the oriental doctrine of negation and for ac- cepting the position outlined above. Self- fulfilment and harmonious perfecting, then, which we have already seen to be presupposed as the ground of value for all beings, taken individually and collective- ly, can thus themselves be seen to pre- suppose the existence of a world ground through relation to which these beings, so perfected, can be said to have intrinsic value in themselves. Such a conception as it appears in Judeo-Christian thought and in some philosophers such as White- head-a conception in which the ulti- mate actualizing principle and the ulti- mate value principle are one-stands as the final ground for maintaining that re- alization, actualization, complete fulfil- ment of the essential nature of all things, is itself a warranted ground for the par- ticular values we have been discussing in the main. Through their concrete rela- tion to God, who is at once the actualiz-</page><page sequence="14">44 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION ing principle of being and the endowing principle of value, all beings become both fulfilled individuals and values in them- selves apart from their instrumental use. Every "actual entity" is an "achieve- ment of value in the temporal order." This is not to say that God creates and approves the evil in the world. Evil re- sults from certain interactions and inter- relations of beings which are in them- selves good. The fact that they miscom- bine, misbehave, destroy and plunder each other, and deny each other fulfil- ment, is not the result of arbitrary divine fiat. Evil is a problem for God as well as for man. It results partly from the way- wardness and rigidity in the elements of the world itself and partly from the mis- behavior of some of the world's members who have freedom. But this does not touch the fact that all beings are en- dowed with value through their relation to the cosmic spirit. The fact that God is the ground for saying that fulfilment and perfection are the legitimate ground for particular valuations does not entail the fact that there is no evil to be coped with, nor is it inconsistent with the fact of the existence of evil. Thus the essential nature of every being is good through re- lation to God. The misuses of freedom, the unlimited expression of potentialities for evil, the waywardness in the relations between entities themselves, do not alter the contention that fulfilment of the es- sential nature of each being has intrinsic value in itself. We have suggested that all traditions of Western thought, no matter what they accepted as the ground of value, whether it be self-fulfilment, the life of pleasure, a balance of interests, conformity to the categorical imperative, etc., have also presupposed that the highest good con- sists in realization and fulfilment. We are blaming these views not for maintaining this presupposition but for not carrying out what this presupposition itself pre- supposes. For fulfilment must be held to be better than nonfulfilment, contrary to oriental thought. And this can only be as- sumed through a being which is at once a creative principle and a value principle. For God fulfilment is good, and through relations to him all entities have intrinsic worth. VIII. AN OBJECTION The foregoing, then, will constitute our reply to Mr. Urban's objection to the definition of good as fulfilment. He writes: I think there can be no doubt that this defini- tion gets its meaning only from the assumption that fulfillment is better than non-fulfillment; and just as little doubt that this assumption can be questioned. In any case, value is as- sumed, the value relation "better than" being already assumed in the definition.... The "value" notion is already imported into the relation-in the assumption that fulfillment is better than non-fulfillment. Without this the equating of the relation with "good" is mean- ingless.9 This assumption is indeed presupposed by us. If, however, fulfilment rather than nonfulfilment of beings can be said to be good through relation to the value-en- dowing power of God, there is sufficient warrant for the assumption. In any case, I wish to point out that such an assump- tion has been characteristic of all West- ern thought, even though much of it has not been concerned with the implications or warrant. It is very interesting to note that, despite Urban's criticism, when he comes round to giving his own theory of value, he stays within the "great tradi- tion" of Western thought and holds that it is some kind of realization or actualiza- tion, rather than the opposite, which constitutes intrinsic value. For him</page><page sequence="15">NONHUMAN VALUE 45 "value" means "that a thing ought to be." But notice that the central conten- tion is that a thing ought to "be" rather than that it ought to "not be." Thus ful- filment is assumed to be better than non- fulfilment. But why, after all, it might be asked, ought a thing to "be" rather than "not be"? Why does value mean "ought to be" rather than "ought to not be"? Why should fulfilment be better than nonfulfilment? Hence a similar justifica- tion would seem to be called for on Ur- ban's own view. Modern thought would do well to ask itself this question with more earnest- ness: Why ought things to "be" rather than "not be"? Why is fulfilment better than nonfulfilment? The justification cannot be found, I think, short of some idea of God. And this is the position which has been adopted here. But there is another objection which Urban offers. He insists that value must be indefinable, for, if it could be defined, it would be reduced to some form of be- ing and so would not be unique. "Value is a logically primitive concept, and can- not be deduced from, nor defined in terms of, anything else."10 There are two points of truth in this contention. In the first place, value must in some sense be intuited. That is, if there were no prior intuitive knowledge of what good and evil mean, no discussion of the topic could get under way. Philoso- phy must presuppose the original aware- ness in experience of goodness, badness, and duty. Understanding without experi- ence is impossible. Second, value cannot be defined if definition means to exhibit a complete characterization of value-its parts, relations, content, etc. That could be done only with complete knowledge and experience. But definition has many senses, of which the most common is perhaps the characterization of things in terms of uni- versals. In this sense Urban himself has offered many things toward a definition of value. He apparently knows, for in- stance, that the essence of value is that it describes not "what" something is but "that it ought to be." He knows that it lies between "being and nonbeing," that it can be ranked and scaled, etc. Thus, in defining value to consist in certain rela- tions of fulfilment, we are not straying from what must be done in any rational inquiry, namely, defining in terms of uni- versals. Furthermore, if value be charac- terized as some form of being, this does not necessarily mean that it is not unique. The kind of being which it has is different from the kind of being which other things have, empirical facts, for instance. IX. CONCLUSION In this paper we have been dealing with a problem which was central to the thought of the classical world but which has received scant attention in modern philosophy, namely, the problem of the relation of value and being. In our pres- ent-day preoccupation with questions of epistemology and methodology, we have all but abandoned this most important and far-reaching of all ethical and meta- physical questions. Yet the problem can- not be solved by simply ignoring it or by tacitly assuming that human conscious- ness is the focal point of all value. If clas- sical thought is to be improved upon, this cannot be done by ignoring its problems. Whether or not the conclusions of this paper, as set forth above, be accepted, therefore, it is to be hoped that some- thing has been accomplished in the wider task of reopening debate on this vital topic.</page><page sequence="16">46 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION NOTES 1.

This passage illustrates both the affirmation of self- fulfilment as the ground of individual value and the denial of self-realizationist ethics in many of its forms. For, since sacrifice of self is sometimes re- quired, self-realization cannot be the only ethical principle of action, even though self-fulfilment stands as the ground of individual value. 3.
