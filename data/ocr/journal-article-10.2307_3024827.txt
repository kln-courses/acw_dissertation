With infinite la? bour, the author has brought together the myths and popular tales of the Indo-European peoples ; and, by application of the principles of comparative philology, has shown, not only that they embody the same ideas, but also that these ideas have a purely physical basis. This was, of course, not possible without frequent reference to the labours of other wTiters; but Mr. Cox has availed himself of their researches in no servile spirit. The result is, unquestionably, a great triumph for the comparative philologists, although whether their method alone is sufficient to explain the source of Aryan mythology is open to doubt. This we will consider, after we have described the system which Mr. * The Mythology of the Aryan Nations. By George W. Cox, M.A. 2 vols. London: Longman, Green, and Co. 1870.

Cox and his fellow-workers have sought to establish, and we will then point out what was doubtless the origin of the religious idea itself. At the foundation of all Aryan mythology, says Mr. Cox, is a belief in " a living Power, to whom men stand in the relation of children to a father." This faith gives itself utterance, as shown by the Vedic as well as the Homeric poems, " in names denoting purely sensuous objects, and thus furnishing the germ of a sen- suous mythology." Primitive man did not distinguish between consciousness and personality ; and, knowing nothing of the con? ditions of life, he invested all things on earth or in the heavens " with the same vague idea of existence. The sun, the moon, the stars, the ground on which he trod, the clouds, storms, and lightning, were all living beings." They were, by an inevitable necessity of language, conscious beings also, ancl thus " there would be no bare recurrence of days ancl seasons, but each morning the clawn would drive her bright flocks to the blue pastures of heaven before the birth of the lord of day from the toiling womb of night. Eoimcl the living progress of the new- born sun there would be grouped a lavish imagery, expressive of the most intense sympathy with what we term the operation of material forces, and not less expressive of the utter absence of even the faintest knowledge. Life would be an altemation of joy and sorrow, of terror ancl relief; for every evening the clawn would return leading her bright flocks, and the short-living sun would die." The primary source of myths is to be found in the " sponta- neous utterances of thoughts awakened by outward phenomena". These expressions would vary with the ever-varying aspects of Nature ; and, when men had forgotten their exact meaning, " old epithets would become the names of new beings, ancl the legencls so formed would constitute the class of secondary myths." The most fruitful source of mytliical phrases would be founcl in the daily or yearly course of the sun, the child of night, or darkness and the bridegroom of the dawn, which " came before he was born, and died as he rose in the heavens." Thus, the sun is said to have "strangled the serpents of the night;.he had to do battle with clouds ancl storms. Sometimes he looked be- nignly on the face of his mother or his bride, who come to greet him at his joumey's end. Sometimes he was the lord of heaven</page><page sequence="3">MYTHOLOGY AND RELIGION. 151 and of light, irresistible in lris divine strength; sometimes he toiled for others, not for himself, in a hard, unwilling servitude. His light and heat might give life or destroy it. He might be the child destined to slay his parents, or to be united at the last in an unspeakable peace to the bright clawn, who for brief space had gladdened his path in the morning. He might be the friend of the children of men, the remorseless foe of those powers of darkness who had stolen away his bricle. He might be a warrior whose eye strikes terror into his enemies, or a wise chieftain skilled in deep and hidden knowledge. Sometimes he might appear as a glorious being doomed to an early death, which no power could avert or delay. Sometimes grievous harcl- ships and desperate conflicts might be followed by a longer season of serene repose. He would have many bricles in many lands, and his offspring would assume aspects beautiful, strange, or horrible. He might be the destroyer of all whom he loved ; he might slay the clawn with his kindling rays; he might scorch the fruits who were his children; he might woo the deep blue sky, the bride of heaven itself, ancl an inevitable doom might bind his limbs on the blazing wheel for ever ancl ever." From the fact that most of the incidents mentioned in this and analogous Hellenic stories are common to the solar myths of different Aryan peoples, the conclusion is drawn that the germ of these myths must have been known to the different members of the Aryan family while they were still united. There were undoubtedly certain differences in the development of the myth; but these may be accounted for by the difference in character of the people themselves, and by the varying conditions of Nature by which they were surrounded ancl influenced. Those pheno? mena which are the most striking in their contrasts would more especially influence the developments of the common myth; ancl thus, although the mythologies of both the north ancl the south may be traced chiefly to names which have been grouped around the sun; that of the Greeks has been founded on the recurrence of day and night, while the Scandinavian ancl Teutonic myths refer to the altemation of summer ancl winter. The phenomena connected with the changes of the year have, however, affected to some extent even Hellenic mythology. Thus," the utter bar- renness of the earth, so long as the wrath of Demeter lasts, m2</page><page sequence="4">152 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY. answers to the locking-up of the treasures in Teutonic folk-lore; but the awakening of spring may be said to be the result of the return, not only of the maiden from the underworld, but of the sun from the far-off regions to which he had departed." This is the idea expressed also in the legend of Dionysos, who answers to PersephonS herself, Dionysos being sometimes called the son of DSmStSr. To find the key to these mythologies, we must, however, go to the Veclic hymns of the Hindus. Here the clivine personalities of the Greek and Norse legends still retain their character as natural phenomena. This can be said of none more certainly than of the heroes who are described as taking part in the struggle on the plain of Ilion. Tlie story of this struggle is, in fact, as Professor Muller says, nothing but a mythical narrative of " the daily siege of the East by the solar powers, that every evening are robbed of their brightest treasures in the West." Mr. Cox's refutation of the arguments of those who seek his? torical incidents in this narrative is complete; and he shows that the admission, that the writers of the Iliad "worked on some materials provided by ancient tradition", must lead to the conclusion he enforces. " The earliest mythical phrases", says Mr. Cox, "tell us of a hero whose chariot is drawn by undying horses, and who is armed with an unerring spear; who is doomed to toil for beings meaner than himself, or to die an early death after fighting in a quarrel which is not his own; who must be parted from the woman to whom he has given his heart, to be united to her again only when his days are drawing to an end; in whom may be seen strange alternations of energy and inaction, of vindictiveness ancl gene- rosity; who, after a long struggle, and just when he seemed to be finally conquered, scatters his enemies on every side, and sinks, when the battle is ended, into a serene and deep repose. The outline is but vague; but it involves all tlie essential fea? tures in the careers of Achilleus and Odysseus, of Meleagros and Herakles, of Perseus, Theseus, and Bellerophon; and not only of these, but of the great heroes of the lays of the Vol- sungs and the Nibelungs, of the romance of Arthur, ancl the epic of Firdusi. In some cases the very names are the same, as well as the incidents; in others they translate each other. There is thus the closest parallelism between the great epics of</page><page sequence="5">MYTHOLOGY AND RELIGION. 153 the Hellenic and Teutonic tribes, of the Persians ancl the Hinclus; and thus, also, the narrative of the Trojan war is not only di- vested of all local historical character, but finds its place as one among the many versions of the tale which relates the career of the great mythical heroes of all lands." The conclusion thus drawn as to the origin of the mythology of Aryan peoples is confirmed by a consideration of their popular stories, the examination and comparison of which forms one of the most valuable parts of Mr. Cox's work, as it will be the most interesting to the general reader. We have not space to dwell on these further than to point out the importance of the identification of the Master Thief with Hermes, the wind-god of so many legends. There are, however, several points in which we think Mr. Cox, in common with other comparative philologists, fails in his treatment of Aryan mythology. In the first place, a sufficient distinction is not made between the sun in its totality and its several attributes as the source of myth. This defect is of the more importance since it is closely related to another question, which we think Mr. Cox has very imper- fectly considered We refer to the connection between the Aryan deities and those of other races. That such a connection exists we are reminded by occasional references in the present work; but it is of a much more fundamental character than Mr. Cox appears willing to allow. He coidd not, however, well do otherwise consistently with the view he takes as to the pri? mitive nature of the condition of mincl exhibited by the Vedic poems. He says that the analysis of Aryan mythology leads us back to what would seem to be the earliest condition of the human mind?that in which no distinction is made between consciousness and personality, resulting in the attribution of consciousness without personality to all outward objects, and afterwards in the formation of either an anthropomorphous poly- theism, or a degrading fetish worship?the belief "in a ma- lignant yet unconscious and non-sentient power residing in stones and rocks." This view is founded on a total misconception of the ori? ginal condition of the human mind. It is quite true that the primitive mind makes no distinction between consciousness and personality; but, instead of the latter being merged in the</page><page sequence="6">154 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY. former, as Mr. Cox suggests, it is just the reverse. The savage, owing to the supremacy of will over reflection, intensely personi- fies; and, although all the predicative worcls he uses may be the expression of general ideas, yet they are seldom employed except with a concrete application. The condition of mind to which Mr. Cox traces the beginning of Aryan mythology, ancl in which man is conscious of his own existence, is of a much later date. Consciousness of one's own existence requires thought, not merely of self, but of self in a certain external relation, ancl the idea of such a relation cannot be formed without considerable antecedent mental culture. The condition of mind, then, which Mr. Cox ascribes to primitive man was really only that of the early Aryans, ancl it implies a long preceding state of develop? ment. This view is confirmed, and, indeed, required, by the fact, which appears to us to be indisputable, that much of what Mr. Cox calls Aryan mythology is so only in the sense of having received a new form by the activity of Aryan thought. It is not at all impossible to derive many of the Hellenic deities from a non-Aryan source without at all interfering with their physical origin. Thus, Herakles, whatever may be said of Her- cules, was undoubtedly none other than the Syrian Sun-god Melkarth, and, as such, one of the primeval Phcenician cleities. So also, although the Greek Apollo was probably an Hellenic creation, yet he was really derived from Helios (Sftrya), ancl may be traced to a Phcenician or Chaldean original. The same may be said of Ath6n6 and of other deities, male ancl female. That the Aryans themselves originated the ideas connected with the daily course of the sun-god is very improbable. They may, however, have transferred them from another object, and a consideration of the name Aryan may throw much light on the question thus raised. This name we have little doubt, notwith- standing the other meanings given to it, is closely connected with that of the Grecian God of War, Ares (Mars). This, Mr. Cox refers to a root denoting "crushing", but it is, rather, de? rived from the Semitic word Ar, fire, from which the lion, as the symbol of the Sun-god, was called ari, as seen in the word Ari-el, " the lion of God." In Srtrya (Helios), the Sun-god of the Veclas, as also in Arya-man (Ahriman) we have doubtless the same root, ancl the Aryans may be said, therefore, to be sun-</page><page sequence="7">MYTHOLOGY AND RELIGION. 155 worshipperspar excellence* It is, of course, possible that they were not the originators of this worship, but only the first to give the sun the most prominent position in the circle of the gods. However this may be, the incidents of the career of the later sun-gods were undoubtedly known to the Chaldeans ancl Phoenicians, while early Hebrew history has a very suspicious similarity in many of its incidents to the mythical history of the solar deities. With the prominence given to the sun, there was, no doubt, also a change of epithets; but some other more dis? tinctive feature than this must be sought for Aryan mythology. We shall not be far wrong if wre say that this consisted in the deification of the light of the sun as distinguished from its heat ?destroying and fecundating?and from the physical solar orb itself. We have not space to develope this idea; but we may point out that the idea of light is at the root of most of the Aryan deified aspects of nature. Thus it is with Dyaus, the glistening ether; with Varuna, the veiling heaven ; with Mitra ancl Indra, gods ofthe bright sky. The same idea found its embodiment in the dawn-goddess, who, under her many names, and with her varying attributes, occupied so important a position in Aryan mythology. The most important development, however, presented by this mythology was the attribution of intellectual wisdom, as the highest faculty of its leading divinities. Mr. Cox refers to this attribution of wisdom ; but he has either lost sight of its import? ance, or he has wrongly thought that it was not within the direct scope of his argument. It is, in fact, impossible to under? stand aright the religious phenomena exhibited by ancient Aryan peoples without taking into consideration the influence of the idea of wisdom over their mythologies. It entered largely into the spiritual struggle between light ancl darkness which was embodied in the religion of Zoroaster, ancl which Mr. Cox has very inadequately treated within the limits of five pages. Through the Persian cult, it may be traced up even into Chris? tianity itself, in the logos of which we have a reproduction of the creative word of Ormuzd. The defects in Mr. Cox's work may be referred to two causes, the most practical of these being a want of appreciation of the * Mr. Cox tells us that Savitar (a name for the sun) is represented as irresistible, and that the verse which is regarded as the holiest in the Veda is addressed to him (vol. i, p. 385).</page><page sequence="8">156 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY. results of historical inquiry, especially those founded on the study of ancient monuments relating to mythology?a de- fect which is common to comparative philologists who deal with mythological questions. Another cause which much diminishes the scientific value of their labours is the notion they entertain that religion is founded on a primitive idea of a Supreme God. It is this notion, apparently, which leads Mr. Cox to say that" the first condition of thought, which regarded every object in creation, would have in itself only two possible developments"?an anthropomorphous polytheism or a degrading fetish worship?and which Professor Max Mtiller expresses when he refers to the African faith," with its strange worship of snakes ancl ancestors, its vague hope of a future life, and its not altogether faded reminiscence of a Supreme God, the Father of the black as well as of the white man." It is some? what strange that, considering the fundamental importance of this supposed primitive belief in a great Father God, the source of it is not shown. Fortunately, we are able, by reference to Mr. Baring-GoulcVs work, which deals directly with this question, to ascertain the philosophical ground on which such a primitive belief is supposed to have existed. On consulting this work, we find that man has two principal instincts?"the craving to find a cause for every effect, and the prosecution of an ideal of perfection." In pursuance of the first, when he sees certain natural phenomena which he cannot explain by visible agency, he refers it to " a force outside of himself similar to that working within him." Here is the origin of the idea of God? " of God, whether many, inhabiting each brook, and plant, and breeze, and planet, or as being a world-soul, or as a supreme cause, the Creator and sustainer of the universe." This, however, is not sufficient. Man has a craving for something beyond mere sensual pleasure; and he forms an ideal, after which he con- tinually presses in pursuance of an instinct leading him to a " distant perfection". Thus, man's " idea of causation has led his intelligence to the conception of a final cause, which he calls God. Naturally his ideal adheres to this intellectual concept, and in the final cause he seeks to focus all his conceptions of perfection; and thus God comes to be regarded as all-mighty, all-wise, the perfection of justice, of goodness, and of beauty."</page><page sequence="9">MYTHOLOGY AND RELIGION. 157 Primeval man, however," saw confuseclly piled up above him an awful Power, terrible in its might, vague in outline, and myste? rious in its nature", from which he formed his earliest notion of God. This view of the origin of the idea of God is perfectly con? sistent with the physical explanation of mythology. But it is not satisfactory. Let it be granted that all savages have formed a conception of some mighty being who causes the more dreaded phenomena of nature. Yet nothing is more certain than that this conception is utterly inoperative as the foundation of the religious idea. These phenomena are too transient, or recur too seldom, to lead to the formation of any such idea in the mind of man. The evils which most powerfully affect the savage are those connected with everyday life and cares, and the sickness and death of which he is continually reminded on each hand, and they are referred simply to the agency of un- friendly demons, by whom the savage believes himself to be sur- rounded. In this fact, we see the weakness of the very first principle laid down by Mr. Baring-Gould. Whatever man may be when civilised, in his savage state he has no " craving to find a cause for every effect." Undoubtedly, when any phenomenon particularly strikes him by its strangeness, he refers it to the operation of a spirit agency; but this is merely because, in his ignorance, everything which is mysterious is so referred. Wlience, then, the origin of this idea of spirit agency ? It is simply the result of the belief in the continued existence of the spirits of the dead?not dead to the savage, but still living?and whom he sees operating in everything which surprises or injures him in his daily life. So far from recognising God in these pheno? mena, he sees only the activity of man, real although xmseen, and this fact is sufficient to show that there can be no question here of an ideal of perfection. The explanation given by this theory of the origin of special forms of religious worship, such as that of the planet- ary cult, cannot be otherwise than unsatisfactory. The as- sertion that, like the evil animals he could not master, " sun, moon, and stars were also invested by man with a life ancl knowledge like his own," really explains nothing. The case is made worse when it is said that nature-worship is " the concen? tration of force in material objects"?thus resolving this phase of</page><page sequence="10">158 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY. religion into fetishism, which is defined as " a concentration of spirit, or deity, upon one point." Mr. Baring Gould is at least consistent. With him fetishism is not limited to any form of superstition or religion. Nor could it be, since he sees in it only the localisation of divine force. Hence, "every temple ancl shrine and priest is a recognition of fetishism." Planetary worship was, certainly, in some sense, fetishic, but this is no ex? planation of its origin. Nor is the origin of the monotheistic belief accounted for when it is said to have resulted from the attribution of " the impress on Nature to a Divine power, un- fettered by matter, and uninvolved in it." However true this may be as an explanation of the nature of the belief, it does not throw any light on the question of its origin. Nor is any real advance made by calling in the assistance of the ideas of unity, of the infinity of space ancl time, or of the continuity of sub? stance, spiritual or material. It is not too much to say that these ideas could not be entertained until the germ of monothe- ism was formed. That the Hebrews had, up to the time of the later captivity, any such monotheistic idea as that supposed by Mr. Baring- Gould we do not believe. But even if it were otherwise, the view which he takes of the relation of God to nature requires that he should discard monotheism, since, although it " provides morality with a strong and stable foothold," yet it has a tendency " to narrow the mind, destroy sympathy, and arouse intolerance." Nor is pantlieism more satisfactory, since on this, we are told, no system of ethics can be based. Mr. Baring-Gould, therefore, calls in the aid of materialism, and he says :" Pantlieism gives us an abso? lute God, anthropomorphism gives us a personal God, materialism supplies a link of cohesion. Fuse the ideas, absorb materialism in pantheism, and pantlieism in materialism, the result is what I call phusitheism." According to this view, " God is present in every force of nature?in heat, electricity, magnetism, attrac? tion, gravitation. It is not that heat, electricity, etc., are God, but that light, heat, electricity, etc., are the effects of the presence of God?effects of His action on the bodies He has given us." God, then, is the spirit of the material universe, but not the uni? verse itself, which was created by Him, and from which He is independent, because pre-existing ancl purely spiritual in his nature. This is certainly an ingenious mode of getting rid of many</page><page sequence="11">MYTHOLOGY AND RELIGION. 159 of the difficulties attendant on the ordinary orthodox notion of the relation of God to nature. Unless we are much mistaken, Mr. Baring-Gould has expressed very nearly the idea of that relation entertained by such writers as Professor Max Mtiller and Mr. Cox. It is not very satisfactory, however, from the scientific standpoint, since the very notion of creation, which is essential to it, cannot be proved to have any real foundation, and because, moreover, the origin assigned for the religious idea is, as we have seen, far from being sufficient. What, then, is the true genesis of the religious idea, that which ends in the recognition of a Supreme Deity ? This idea is, un- doubted, founded in Spiritism, that is, in the belief in the exist? ence of spirits, who are thought to busy themselves with the affairs of men, and whose action is seen in many of the pheno? mena of external nature. The savage does not, however, refer these phenomena to an activity merely like his own. To him there is no such thing as death. The body may decay, but the man still lives, and for some time at least after death he is supposed to require the ordinary provision of the living. Mr. Baring-Gould has well shown this, and we are surprised that he has not seen the consequences to which it necessarily leads. The non-obser- vance of the rights of the dead is supposed to be resented by them; and in this we have the foundation of the notion enter? tained by savage man that he is surrounded by spirits who seek to injure him. The most essential duty which the survivors owe to the departed is burial, and hence the unburied dead are the demons whom the savage chiefly fears. To these, however, are added the spirits of enemies, who are supposed to retaliate even after death for the injuries they have sustained during life. It is evident what an extension this belief may have. Even the buried dead require provision for a certain time after death. This provision is supposed to keep them from interfering with the living, and there would be little difficulty in extending the idea, so as to see in similar offerings a means of propitiating the demons who are thought to be unfriendly, and even of obtain? ing their friendship and assistance. This is the real explanation of fetishism and idol-worship. The fetish or the idol is not, as Mr. Baring-Gould imagines, the point of concentration of the divine force, but simply the object in which the clemon is thought to become located more or less permanently.</page><page sequence="12">160 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY. We have here the explanation of one phase of spiritism?that which is sometimes called the worship of devils. There is, however, another phase which has often come to be associated with it, and which has had a very important independent development. When man has made certain progress in mental culture, his re- membrance of the dead ceases to be one only of fear. The re- verence with which the head of the family is viewed during life continues after his death, giving rise to what is termed ancestor-wo-rship. This phase of spiritism may have a still further development. The chief occupies the same position towards the tribe as the father does towards the family. Hence the ancestor of the chief becomes the protecting spirit of the tribe, and at a later stage he may be the national god. The source of the reverence which semi-civilised peoples ex? hibit for the head of the family is his procreating power; and we cannot therefore be surprised that, to those who believe the denizens of the spirit-world to have the power of giving the good things of life and that a numerous progeny is the best of all gifts, the representation of the generative instrument may be? come a powerful fetish. This is the origin of the phallic super? stition, which is thus seen to combine both of the early phases of spiritism. We have another point of contact between these forms of spiritism in serpent worship. Under certain conditions, wild animals may come to be considered as being imder the power of spirits, if not themselves incarnate demons. Of these animals, those noted for their subtlety are often thought to be the embo- diments of spirit-ancestors. The serpent is thus treated, and hence it has become almost everywhere the symbol of life ancl healing, and of wisdom as representing the spirit-world. There can be no wonder that, although not itself directly a symbol of generation, it came to be associated with the worship of those spirits who are thought especially to preside over human fecundity. The phallic superstition itself, however, had a special development such as that which ancestor-worship underwent. The spirit who was supposed toreside in the local phallic emblem became the guardian of the tribe, and when the power of the tribe was extended over a whole country, it would become the national deity presiding over generation. This would be still more likely to ensue when man began to consider his relation to nature in general, and when he saw in the planets the arbiters of human destiny. llulers over</page><page sequence="13">MYTHOLOGY AND RELIGION. 161 all men, they became in some sense universal deities; and Saturn, as the highest and the most distant of the known planets, was thought to be the especial guardian and controller of human fecundity. Hence the upright phallic figure and the serpent came to be the emblems of Saturn, the erect god, who was received by most of the peoples of antiquity as the supreme deity. The phallic pillar-gods had many developments, but the most important was certainly that which is known as Semitic monotheism. This was nothing but the recognition of the national god as the father of the people; and it originated purely in the idea of a genera? tive deity, who, at first the all-embracing Saturn, afterwards be? came the Sun-god. By the side of this superstition was springing up another phase of what may be called phallism. When man came to cultivate the ground, he saw that he was dependent on the or? derly changes of the seasons for a return to his labour. The ex? treme value, too, as means of subsistence, of the buffalo ancl the goat, the first domestic animals, led to their being considered as typical of the fecundity of nature. Hence, when on the de? velopment of agriculture, the course of the great luminary through the heavens was mapped out, these animals took the chief places among the signs of the zodiac, and ultimately be? came the incarnation, in Egypt at least, of the supreme god of nature. The moon appears at first to have occupied this posi? tion, although there is no doubt that the sun ultimately took the place of both the moon and Saturn as the great lord of fe? cundity. Thus the phallic idea was at the foundation of the planetary cult of all the peoples of antiquity. This was, how? ever, only a phase of spiritism, and it almost necessarily led to the establishment of the religious mysteries in which the passage from death to life was represented. Even in the most spiritualised form taken by the doctrines taught in the mysteries, and which fully recognised the sun-god as the source of life, there is no trace of monotheism. They en- forced rather a triad of divinities, founded on the three orders of time, with a duality of principles; and it was only when the quasi-monotheism of the early Hebrews was brought into contact with Persian thought that the former was resolved into the purer monotheism of the later Hebrew prophets. All the ideas of divinity embraced by these religions are thus traceable to the</page><page sequence="14">162 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY. fecundating power of the sun. To the Aryan mind, however, which, moreover, deified almost every phase of nature, other attributes were more striking, especially that of light, from which arose the further idea of intellectual wisdom. It was this which gave its special tone to the religious system of Zoroaster ancl to the teachings of Gautama, who, without abancloning Hinduism, sought to attain happiness in a future state by adherence in the conduct of life to the simple dictates of conscience guicled by reason. Finally, Christianity, by appropriating the sublimest precepts, with many of the dogrnas, of its predecessors, showed its connection with the earlier cults, while establishing its claim to be the universal religion and holding up Christ, as already was Mithra in the Persian faith, for the guidance ancl pattern of mankind. This is the conclusion reached in the course of the actual development of the religious idea. In Mr. Baring-GoulcVs philosophic system the divine pattern fumished by Mithra or Christ becomes the ideal of perfection necessary to the proper development of man's nature, ancl which is found not only in Christ, the divine incarnation of male perfection ancl the great Exemplar for man, but in Mary, who furnishes the model re? quired by woman. The final result to be considered must necessarily be the same in whatever way religious phenomena are explained, seeing that this result is furnished by the existence of such phenomena. The difference must therefore be in the principle applied for their explanation ; this, in the hypothesis of Mr. Baring-Gould, being the primitive belief in the existence of a Supreme Being, whereas the theory we have advanced requires only the belief in the con? tinued existence of the human spirit, notwithstanding apparent death. It may be thought that so long as the final state of be? lief is the same, it does not matter from what source this be? lief has been derived. Practically, and with relation to the con? duct of life, it does not; but it is far otherwise when the relation of man to God is considered. We have a proof of this in Mr. Baring-GouhTs philosophy, which requires for its starting- point the idea of creation, an idea which is utterly repugnant to the natural hypothesis above stated. The religious idea is strictly the result of a process of intellectual development, ancl there is no ground for supposing that man himself, or the world of which he forms a part, has originated by any but an analo-</page><page sequence="15">fc&gt; MYTHOLOGY AND RELIGION. 163 gous process. On the hypothesis of creation there is no abso? lute guarantee that the results of a religious development, such as that supposed by Mr. Baring-Gould, are the expression of truth. The very fact, however, of certain ideas being arrived at in the course of the orderly evolution of the human mind is positive proof of their relative truth. We say relative, since it is probably impossible, with our present experience, to arrive at positive truth as to the nature of God or man's relation to Him. According to this view, every fresh advance made by the human mind in this direction is a step further towards posi? tive truth. It is the spirit, however, and not the letter of the new teaching which is entitled to be thus considered; since the human mind has an unhappy tendency to embody its religious ideas in intelleotual dogmas, which, from the very nature of tlie case, must be false. We have an example of this in the idea of incarnation, which it has been Mr. Baring-GoulcVs object to cle- velope. As stated by him, this constitutes a great advance in Christian belief, but in reality it only points to the still more developed notion that not only Christ, but mankind also, is a divine incarnation, that is, an evolutional product of the divine energy. Our task is completed, and it remains for us only to give our general estimate of the books which have called forth these re? marks. Judged either together or separately, we think that they must be considered as constituting most important signs of the times. Mr. Baring-Gould's work is in some sense more impor? tant than its companion. It exhibits the phenomenon of a clergyman of the Church of England seeking to establish a phi? losophy of religious belief without calling in the aid of revelation, ancl founded on the idea of the moral capacity of man's nature, instead of its innate corruption.
