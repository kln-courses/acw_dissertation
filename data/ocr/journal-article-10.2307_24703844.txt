Those advocating a social perspective label nonproducers "social cheats" (types that gain advantage from producing types) and thus it follows (accord ing to the social evolution perspective) that producing types are "cooperators"; any secreted product is termed a "public good" (West et al. 2006, 2007a; Nadell et al. 2009; Foster 2010). Al though this may be true, there exist alternate nonsocial explana tions for producers and nonproducers (elaborated in Z&amp;R). Experiments to test whether the social evolution hypothesis appropriately describes the microbial world are possible. Indeed, where secreted products are public goods in a strict game theoretic sense,1 for example, where the product is equally available to pro ducers as to nonproducers (Olson 1965; Hardin 1968; Dionisio and Gordo 2006), theory makes a number of simple predictions: nonproducers will gain advantage in the presence of the secreted product; nonproducers will do poorly in the absence of produc ers; producers will do better in the absence of nonproducers (West et al. 2006, 2007a). If evidence arises consistent with the public good hypothesis, then further experiments allow the hypothesis of cooperation (as adaptation) to be tested. Although it is often assumed that evidence consistent with the public goods hypothe sis establishes the underlying trait as cooperative, this need not be true (Driscoll et al. 2013). To claim that a given product is coop erative is to imply that its origin (and/or maintenance) is at least partly attributable to selection acting on some beneficial effect conferred on recipients. It is thus necessary to show that produc tion of the public good incurs a cost and that production has been selected (or is maintained) because of some benefit conferred on recipient cells (West et al. 2007b). It is also important to establish the nature of the presumed collective benefit. When it comes to microbes this is no trivial matter: it requires knowledge of the ecological circumstances under which a given trait evolved (or is maintained).2 Experiments to test the public good hypothesis are in princi ple straightforward, requiring simple growth experiments. How 'Not all cooperative traits are public goods in this strict sense, but such a definition has value because it generates readily testable predictions (see West et al. 2006, 2007a).

Significant factors include the nature of the test environment (e.g., culture medium and conditions of culture), founding density of bacteria, ratio of competitors, preculture con ditions, and specific details of competing genotypes. Of these, the most critical is the nature of the test environment. The appropriate environment is one in which the presumed social trait evolved or is maintained. If the focus of interest were cooperative hunting in Serengeti lions, then the Serengeti Plains would be the focus of study. For microbes, knowledge of the ap propriate environment is rarely available; rarely is the ecological significance of presumed social traits understood to the necessary degree; rarely is there sufficient understanding of the ecophys iology of the trait of interest, or knowledge of the ecological circumstances under which the trait evolved and/or is maintained. Although the value of performing studies of cooperative hunt ing in lions, using caged lions and captive gazelles, would be questionable, studies of social interactions in microbes are un hesitatingly performed under conditions likely to fall well short of approximating appropriate ecological conditions. Where the goal is to construct a biological model, this can be justified; how ever, when researchers reach general conclusions regarding the nature of interactions informed only by laboratory experiments, then choice of environment is of paramount importance. Here there is need for care: the experimenter has god-like power. It is a simple matter to inadvertently contrive laboratory conditions so as to ensure producers and nonproducers perform in accordance with preconceived notions. Pyoverdin, Paradigmatic Public Good? The water-soluble iron-chelating compound pyoverdin, produced by members of the genus Pseudomonas (Stanier et al. 1966), has become the exemplar of "social trait" and "public good" (see Z&amp;R). The yellow-green fluorescent pigment has long held diagnostic value for clinical microbiologists. Studies of the pig ment and conditions promoting its production date back to the 1890s (Gessard 1892; Georgia and Poe 1932). These early stud ies showed that pyoverdin production is stimulated by growth in media low in iron (Paton 1959), but too little iron interferes with growth (Garibaldi 1967). Since 1954, the preferred (pro teose peptone-based) medium for culture of Pseudomonas (and enhancement of pyoverdin production) has been King's Medium B (KB) (King et al. 1954).3 Pioneering work performed more than 35 years ago showed that pyoverdin is a desferrisiderophore (Meyer and Abdallah 1978): it also has additional roles, for example, it appears to The paper by King et al.

Statisti cal analyses showed that in CAA with high levels of apotransferrin (but not in CAA where pyoverdin is nonetheless produced) non producers gained advantage from producing strains and producers reach higher densities in monoculture than nonproducers. Griffin et al. (2004) also reported the results of analyses showing a cost to pyoverdin production in iron-replete media,5 but this remains difficult to understand in light of known iron-mediated repres sion of pyoverdin synthesis (Meyer and Abdallah 1978; Ochsner et al. 1995; Hassett et al. 1996) and could not be verified by Z&amp;R.

The reader thus assumes the iron-replete environment to be unsupplemented CAA, but CAA promotes production of pyoverdin due to its iron-deplete status. those of other extracellular microbial products (now also con sidered social traits), typically overlook the critical difference between demonstrating competitive dynamics consistent with a public goods problem (not necessarily to the exclusion of other ex planations), and conclusive demonstration that a trait has evolved and/or is maintained as a social adaptation. Invoking cooperation (where there exists a cost to the actor) or altruism as the cause of a particular trait is necessarily an adaptive hypothesis, which bears on evolutionary history, whereas the public goods game describes interactions among co-occurring populations. Just why observa tions consistent with public goods dynamics have been taken as conclusive proof of evolved altruism is not clear, but it may be in part a consequence of the asymmetric demands of studying evolution in macroscopic versus microscopic organisms. Many decades ago, evolutionary biologists observed indis putable examples of evolved altruism (e.g., sterile worker castes), and were challenged to develop frameworks capable of explain ing such observations. Modern socio-microbiologists face the opposite challenge: theoretical frameworks for explaining so cial adaptation are well developed, but identifying adaptations in profoundly unfamiliar contexts, and in organisms that cannot be observed with the naked eye, is a difficult task. The pub lic goods dynamics that may adequately describe interactions between producing and nonproducing strains in laboratory co cultures bear on the forces driving evolution of the underlying traits only insofar as laboratory conditions reproduce salient fea tures of the environment in which the adaptation arose, or is maintained. The Study ofZhanq and Rainey (2013) In a recent paper, Z&amp;R reported the results of experiments aimed at testing the hypothesis that pyoverdin produced by P. fluo resces SBW25 is a public good. In these experiments, the authors demonstrate that pyoverdin producers and nonproducers behave in accord with predictions from social evolution theory, but only under a limited set of environmental (and genetic) conditions. Central to their study was a 600-generation selection experiment, performed in KB—in structured and unstructured microcosms— in which nonproducing types evolved de novo. These types were genetically characterized, an isogenic strain constructed, and its performance subsequently studied in structured and unstructured microcosms, and at different founding ratios. Ensuing data led to rejection of the hypothesis that nonproducers evolving in KB gain advantage by taking unfairly of pyoverdin from producing cells. In KB. nonproducers arise by mutation in the regulator gene pvdS and gain advantage by avoiding costs associated with a regulatory system that is maladapted to life in planktonic laboratory culture. 3 346 EVOLUTION NOVEMBER 2014</page><page sequence="4">TECHNICAL COMMENT Extensive additional data led Z&amp;R to question the generality of to K&amp;R, should not be used to study the "social evolution" of the claim that pyoverdin is a public good, producers are coop- pyoverdin because it is replete with iron and promotes the pro erators, and nonproducers are social cheats.

EVOLUTION NOVEMBER 2014 3347 TECHNICAL COMMENT Extensive additional data led Z&amp;R to question the generality of the claim that pyoverdin is a public good, producers are coop erators, and nonproducers are social cheats. Their findings also led them to question the appropriateness of the fit between the social evolution framework and the lives of microbes. At no point did Z&amp;R reject outright the hypothesis that pyoverdin is a public good or a cooperative trait. To quote: Our work shows that under certain laboratory conditions (me dia supplemented with high levels of iron-chelating agent) pyoverdin behaves as expected of a public good, however con formity to the social evolution framework is dependent on both genotype and environment. In some environments, pyoverdin defective types evolve because production of pyoverdin is mal adaptive. Under other conditions pyoverdin appears to be per sonalized. The discovery of just one set of conditions under which pyoverdin is produced, and yet does not behave in ac cord with social evolution theory, gives reason to question the generality of the conclusion that pyoverdin is a public good, that producers are cooperators and that non-producers are so cial cheats. These findings and ensuing conclusions have unsettled Kümmerli and Ross-Gillespie (hereafter K&amp;R). In a recent com ment, K&amp;R call into question the experiments and conclusions put forward by Z&amp;R, claiming their work to be flawed and their un derstanding of social evolution naive. We reject such assertions. In the following, we show that the work of Z&amp;R is valid, and present empirical evidence and logical arguments that counter the charges of K&amp;R. to K&amp;R, should not be used to study the "social evolution" of pyoverdin because it is replete with iron and promotes the pro duction of negligible amounts of the siderophore. K&amp;R present data to back these two central criticisms, but upon further inves tigation (and in light of the data K&amp;R provide), we find serious problems with each line of argument. We first call attention to basic principles of iron biochemistry that, when properly appre ciated, invalidate their first claim. Their second claim stands in the face of more than 60 years use of KB to culture and iden tify Pseudomonas—precisely because it does promote pyoverdin production. But more significantly, the claim that KB does not promote pyoverdin production is dependent on presentation of data in a manner that ignores well-known density-dependent ef fects. When such effects are recognized (and the raw data of K&amp;R examined), it becomes apparent that K&amp;R's own data demonstrate production of pyoverdin in KB at levels no different to those ob served in CAA. MEASURES OF TOTAL IRON ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF THE IRON THAT IS AVAILABLE TO MICROBIAL LIFE KB is a nutritionally complex medium, containing, in addition to salts, 20 g L_l proteose peptone and 10 g L_l glycerol. CAA, on the other hand, is a nutritionally compromised medium: in addi tion to salts, CAA contains just 5 g L-1 casamino acids* and no additional carbon source. K&amp;R use a commercial "QuantiChrom" iron assay kit to measure total iron9 in KB and CAA. They show KB to have higher total iron than CAA. The finding that KB has more total iron than CAA is unsurprising, but moreover, it is irrelevant. What is relevant is the chemical form of iron.

The data show that while cell density varies dramatically depending on the medium, there is no significant effect of medium on total amount of py overdin: K&amp;R's data demonstrate that KB promotes production of pyoverdin. The claim that KB promotes only minimal production of py overdin depends entirely on expression of pyoverdin as a function of OD (RFU/OD6oo)- Given the superior nutritional status of KB relative to CAA, cells in KB grow to a much higher density than in CAA. The significantly greater denominator means that KB grown cells appear to produce considerably less pyoverdin (on a per OD-unit basis), compared to CAA-grown cells. Does this justify the claim that the "collective production"14 of KB-grown cells is negligible? No it does not. Even if we assume that K&amp;R intended their claim to apply to per capita (or, more accurately, per OD600 unit) production, this would be true if and only if the relationship between pyoverdin and cell number was linear. The relationship between these variables for P. aeruginosa PAOl is known, and is anything but linear (see Kiimmerli et al. 2009; Kümmerli and Brown 2010). A nonlinear relationship between growth and pyoverdin stems from complex regulation. Two layers are relevant: the first involves positive feedback between the ferripyoverdin complex and transcription of pyoverdin biosynthetic genes (Lamont et al. 2002; Visca et al. 2007). Such regulation ensures exponential escalation of pyoverdin biosynthesis. The second involves Fur mediated repression, which means that the total amount of se creted pyoverdin saturates above a certain concentration (Ochsner et al. 1995).

Rather, they are a direct conse quence of the vastly different nutritional status of KB compared to CAA. KB PROMOTES THE PRODUCTION OF PYOVERDIN IN RESPONSE TO LOW LEVELS OF AVAILABLE IRON We present data from a simple experiment that confirms that production of pyoverdin in KB (by P. fluorescens SBW25) is a consequence of low levels of available iron. We grew SBW25 in KB—over a 48-h period in static microcosms—with and with out the addition of surplus iron (45 p,M FeSOzt). Pyoverdin was measured as in K&amp;R, but cell growth was determined by dilu tion plating. The data are shown in Table 1 (see also Fig. 1). SBW25 grown in KB produces pyoverdin (10,385 RFU [9664 11,107]). No pyoverdin is produced when ferrous iron is added to the medium (—62 RFU [—172—48]). KB therefore promotes production of pyoverdin and production is a direct response to low levels of available iron. We also cultured SBW25 in CAA with and without ferrous iron. Compared to KB-grown cells, more pyoverdin was detected in microcosms containing CAA grown cells. Pyoverdin was sig nificantly reduced in CAA supplemented with ferrous iron, al though did not return to zero. The bacterium was also cultured in KB and CAA containing 100 p. g mL_l apotransferrin. A reduc tion in pyoverdin was noted in both media compared to the same media without apotransferrin. Cell numbers were particularly af fected in CAA with apotransferrin. Of note is lack of evidence of a plateau for pyoverdin production by SBW25. This is consis Figure 1. Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 cells grown in King's Medium B (KB) produce pyoverdin.

This is an intriguing difference compared to PAOl that warrants additional investigation. Indeed, this and many additional findings reported by Z&amp;R indicate that the relationship between Pseudomonas— the production of pyoverdin—and environment is more complex than currently appreciated. There exists the possibility that fluorescence emitted by py ocyanin may interfere with measurement of pyoverdin. To exclude this possibility, we took note of known fluorescent properties of pyocyanin (Sullivan et al. 2011) and used epifluorescence mi croscopy to selectively measure pyoverdin (Julou et al. 2013). Microcolonies of P. fluorescens SBW25—and for this work we included P. aeruginosa PAOl—were grown (separately) for 20 h at 28°C (the optimal temperature for pyoverdin production by PAOl [Meyer et al. 1996]) on an agar gel sealed with a coverslip. Slides containing microcolonies were transferred to an inverted microscope for quantification of pyoverdin. As shown in Fig ure 2, KB promotes production of pyoverdin synthesis in both P. fluorescens and P. aeruginosa, although levels were noticeably higher in P. fluorescens. No signal was detected in mutants com promised in their ability to produce pyoverdin, thus supporting the conclusion that the observed fluorescence is solely attributable to pyoverdin (and not pyocyanin). Moreover, both bacteria, when grown on KB, produce pyoverdin. HOW P.

There is no reason to doubt that the bacterium benefits from uptake of the ferripyoverdin complex from which it liberates iron. In spatially structured culture, growth rapidly depletes oxygen from the broth phase, creating a gradient that descends steeply from the air-liquid interface (oxygen is absent from all but the top few micrometers within a few hours growth). There are numerous ensuing effects due to factors such as pH, redox chemistry, and metal solubility. These in turn impact upon bacterial physiology.

When pyoverdin-defective (pvdS) mutants grow in KB in the absence of producing types, they must necessarily gain iron inde pendently of pyoverdin. This could involve an alternate chelating agent, but it may simply be that there exists the possibility for a modicum of growth sufficient to effect a decrease in oxygen concentration thus promoting reduction of Fe(III) to the soluble Fe(II) form. Under such conditions cellular iron needs are met independently of exogenous chelating agents. It is important to be clear about the cause of pyoverdin non producing types. The cause is a regulatory system that is poorly suited to life in planktonic KB culture. Pyoverdin production itself is not maladaptive (as K&amp;R claim); rather, it is the reg ulation of pyoverdin production. It seems that regulation is not tuned to the demands of growth in structured KB microcosms. Although sobering, with hindsight, this is hardly surprising given that closed KB microcosms are not the natural environment for P. fluorescens. We suspect that the regulation of pyoverdin is generally ill-suited to growth in closed planktonic conditions (Julou et al. 2013)—again, reflecting the fact that the regulation of py overdin is likely tuned to conditions encountered by Pseu domonas in its natural habitat. There is even reason to suggest that such maladaptive regulation is a factor in the evolution of nonpyoverdin-producing mutants in the cystic fibrosis (see Z&amp;R).

It would be especially interesting to examine the effect of severe iron limi tation (and deleterious impacts on growth) on cell physiology, on regulation of pyoverdin production, and ensuing effects on the na ture of the interaction between producing and nonproducing cells. Indeed, we urge K&amp;R to open the black box that surrounds growth, physiology, and genetics of pyoverdin-producing and pyoverdin nonproducing types (and pyoverdin-mediated interactions among these types) in CAA supplemented with apotransferrin. 3 3 50 EVOLUTION NOVEMBER 2014</page><page sequence="8">TECHNICAL COMMENT 7770 Purpose of Models dnd There is little doubt that the hypothesis that pyoverdin is a Misconceptions of SocieI Evolution public g00d &lt;in the standard game theoretic sense)fails to incor — " porate important biological parameters.

The nature of the theory misunderstood is not made clear, but disquieting to K&amp;R is Z&amp;R's finding that pyoverdin can be personalized, although the full significance of this finding seems to have gone unrecognized (see below). Rather than considering the possibility that pyoverdin may, under some conditions, fail to perform as a public good (as the data of Z&amp;R show), K&amp;R sketch a model that shows how the social evolution framework readily accommodates personalized "public goods."

Nonetheless the model sketched by K&amp;R is worth examina tion. First though, it needs to be seen in light of several substan tive theoretically informed models of diffusion-mediated sharing of extracellular products (Driscoll and Pepper 2010; Allen et al. 2013; Nadell et al. 2013).15 These studies show that increased dif fusion distance, lower diffusion coefficients, and (in some cases) increased uptake rates serve to increase personalization, thus aug menting the direct fitness of producers. The model of K&amp;R is largely free of physically and biologically meaningful parame ters. For example, in contrast to Allen et al. (2013), there is no account of spatial structure, cell shape, diffusion rate, or rates of decay. It is therefore difficult to interpret their sketch in either the context of previous work, or the experiments of Z&amp;R. Indeed, all biological details are subsumed within a single, dimensionless "personalization" parameter, which imposes the constraint that any pyoverdin produced must benefit either the producer or the nonproducer (precluding loss through diffusion or degradation). In essence, the model shows that nonproducers can win against producers even when producers personalize some of the prod ucts. This is true. It also shows that when producers personalize too much of the product, nonproducers lose. This is also true. In the latter case, the product is a private good and evolution of production is a simple matter. 15 Allen et al. provide a theoretical analysis of public good production in which they take into account spatial structure, cell shape, diffusion rate, and rates of decay. They show that conditions for diffusible products to be maintained as cooperative traits are especially stringent and unlikely in mixed culture. This provides additional reason to suspect that what is observed in closed planktonic culture may have little relevance to understanding the ecological significance of pyoverdin in nature. There is little doubt that the hypothesis that pyoverdin is a public good (in the standard game theoretic sense) fails to incor porate important biological parameters. Nonetheless, the claim has one very considerable merit: it makes straightforward predic tions that are testable. Moreover, the claim that pyoverdin is a diffusible public good—accessible to all individuals (in a well mixed environment)—has been made repeatedly. To quote from two reviews on microbes and public goods: a public good is "a resource that is costly to produce, and provides a benefit to all the individuals in the local group or population" (West et al. 2006); "public goods lead to the problem of cooperation because they are metabolically costly to the individual to produce but provide a benefit to all the individuals in the local group or population" (West et al. 2007a). Furthermore, it is not uncommon to find pyoverdin discussed as a public good in context of, and with reference to, Hardin's classic "tragedy of the commons," which centers firmly on the notion of "common resource" (Hardin 1968) (see, e.g.. Fig. 1 of West et al. 2007a and Kiimmerli and Brown 2010). The preceding discussion, however, misses the significance of one of several pieces of data that led Z&amp;R to point to evidence of personalization. Z&amp;R examine the ability of producing types to increase in frequency (when rare) in the face of numerically superior populations of nonproducers. The expectation according to sociobiology is that when a diffusible product is costly to pro duce and the product is equally available to nonproducers as to producers (i.e., it is a public good), then producing types will be incapable of invasion. This expectation holds equally for a person alized cooperative trait—as sketched in the model of K&amp;R—in which that part of the product not retained by the producer is available to nonproducing types. Z&amp;R show that under certain conditions, for example, well-mixed CAA medium supplemented with chelating agent, that pyoverdin producers have substantially higher fitness than nonproducers—even when rare. Such a finding is incompatible with the hypothesis that (in this medium) pyoverdin is a public good. In terms of the model of K&amp;R. this means that the amount of pyoverdin retained by the producer makes the "cost to ben efit" ratio favorable to the producer. As a consequence there is insufficient diffusible pyoverdin for nonproducers to prosper (so they lose). Pyoverdin, under these conditions behaves as neither a public good, nor a cooperative trait, but rather, as a "privatized product," the production of which benefits producing cells suf ficiently to yield a relative fitness advantage in coculture with nonproducers. Interestingly, if instead of CAA supplemented with chelat ing agent, KB is substituted (supplemented with chelating agent), the opposite result is found: pyoverdin producers fail to in vade against a numerically superior population of nonproduc ers.

Reinterpretation of Data From Z&amp;R If the claims made by K&amp;R had substance, then reassessment of the findings of Z&amp;R would be appropriate. However, it is wrong to cherry-pick and reinterpret data that supports a given position while ignoring or dismissing findings that run contrary to it. It is difficult to view K&amp;R's reinterpretation of the data of Z&amp;R (see K&amp;R Table 1) as anything other than evidence of confirmation bias (Nickerson 1998). Rather than proceed to put right the numerous misinterpretations, errors in assumption (and omission), and statistical issues arising from selective gathering of data from experiments that were each designed to test differ ent predictions, we leave the interested reader to consult Z&amp;R directly. Having raised concern of confirmation bias, it seems timely to ask why, when KB is as good a laboratory medium at promoting production of pyoverdin as CAA (and is nutritionally balanced), K&amp;R might insist that CAA with high levels of apotransferin (where growth is severely compromised) is the correct environ ment for exploring the sociobiology of pyoverdin. Could it be because assays performed in this environment ensure conformity to expectations under social evolutionary theory? Tellingly, K&amp;R state that "... previous studies have focussed on pyoverdin pro duction under strongly iron-limited conditions, where it affords the greatest potential benefits to cooperators and cheats alike." Thus, according to K&amp;R, pyoverdin is a cooperative trait and nonproducers are cheats. This is apparent when the right medium is used. The right medium is one that ensures the outcome accords with the social evolution framework. Reasoning of this kind is cir cular and ensures that the hypothesis that pyoverdin is a public good (and cooperative trait) can only ever be affirmed: it can never be rejected. But neither can it be tested. The Importance of Seeking Alternate Explanations and The Dangers of Anthropomorphism The hypothesis that the microbial world has evolved such that cooperative behavior is the norm is interesting. But it is a hy pothesis. Like any hypothesis it requires careful appraisal. A critical part of the appraisal process is rigorous and unbiased experimentation. Of central importance is the search for alter nate explanations—the search for falsifiable as well as confir matory evidence. In our view, in the context of microbes, the importance of searching for falsifiable evidence has been largely overlooked. Although there is much yet to be accomplished, the work of Z&amp;R has: ( 1 ) provided sound reasons to question the general ity of the claim that pyoverdin is a public good; (2) shown that nonproducers—even when they evolve de novo in the presence of producers—need not be social cheats; (3) shown that conformity of producers and nonproducers to the social evolution framework is contingent upon both environment and genotype; (4) drawn at tention to the artificial nature of laboratory environments and the need to move future studies to natural settings; (5) highlighted the paucity of rigorous experimental evidence underpinning repeated assertions that the microbial world is inherently cooperative; and (6) shown the ecology, ecophysiology, genetics, and cell biology of pyoverdin to be far richer and more complex than currently recognized (see also Julou et al. 2013). 1 ne route to turtner progress is not onvtous. tven tne decep tively simple predictions concerning public goods are in reality experimentally challenging to realize.

EVOLUTION NOVEMBER 2014 3353 products; however, once the social evolution framework has been applied, this is not easily done. Furthermore, given god-like pow ers of laboratory scientists, it is a relatively trivial matter to inad vertently contrive laboratory conditions such that producers and nonproducers behave in accord with expectations arising from the social evolution framework. Microbes are not bound by such frameworks, but experimenters can be. In the search for competing hypotheses to explain nonpro ducing types, Z&amp;R offered an explanation for nonproducing types in KB, but argued that insights from KB might also have relevance in the case of nonproducing strains in the cystic fibrosis lung. Such an explanation gains momentum given new data on the availabil ity of soluble iron in the cystic fibrosis lung and evidence that Pseudomonas gains iron from the soluble ferrous fraction and heme (Hunter et al. 2013; Nguyen et al. 2014). In a similar spirit, we suggest an alternate explanation for the fact that some (but not all) Pseudomonas strains can uptake pyoverdin molecules of structural classes other than the one they produce (Cornelis and Matthijs 2002). This may reflect cooper ation and cheating (Lee et al. 2012), but it may be an indirect consequence of phage-mediated prédation. Of note is substan tive genetic diversity (and evidence of positive selection) at the pyoverdin locus; curiously most is confined to a single gene, fpvA, which encodes the major ferripyoverdin receptor (Smith et al. 2005). Pyocins (a kind of bacteriocin) gain entry to Pseu domonas via the FpvA receptor (Bayasse et al. 1999), as do bac teriophage (Smith et al. 2005). Both chemical warfare among microbes (Czaran et al. 2002; Kerr et al. 2002) and antagonistic coevolution between phage and their hosts (Buckling and Rainey 2002) drive diversification. The capacity of some strains to use un related pyoverdin molecules synthesized by competing microbes may simply be a consequence of diversification driven by war fare, combined with functional constraints on the need for up take of pyoverdin. This hypothesis suggests new opportunities for research. Conclusion An important and overarching goal for microbiology is to place knowledge of organismal function in an ecological and evolution ary context within which the biology of microbes makes sense. The appropriateness of this context is critical because it impacts on how the microbial world is conceived—the kinds of questions asked and the types of experiments performed (Redfield 2002). It is especially important in the face of the current drive to under stand microbial communities, treat disease, develop new tools for environmental application and in biotechnology. Microbial communities are shaped by interactions among constituent members. Interactions within and among genotypes come in a great many guises. While some interactions fall within the scope of sociobiology, many others do not. Indeed, one unan ticipated outcome of the work of Z&amp;R is recognition of the ex treme sensitivity of interactions to subtle changes in environment and genotype. An interaction that might appear to conform to a social dilemma under one set of conditions can change entirely upon a small shift in the nutritional status of the environment. In teractions are rich and complex and a door to numerous research opportunities. Progress requires studies that shed light on the nature of inter actions, their scale, stability, genotype/environment dependency, and fluidity. Such studies are likely to be most productive when performed in an objective manner and free from expectations driven by a theoretical framework whose general relevance to mi crobes remains to be demonstrated. As mechanistic understanding increases, it will become possible to describe interactions in terms of biological detail and fitness effects (and consequences) with out need to resort to the constraints of anthropomorphic language. From such advances a substantive theory of interactions stands to emerge. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We are grateful to D. Greig, S. De Monte, R. Moxon, D. Bensimon, B. Kerr (and laboratory), C. Tarnita, A.
