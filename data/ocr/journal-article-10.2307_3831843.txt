Moore, "Of Beasts and Jewels" X?elizabeth Bishop's anecdotal essay about Marianne Moore, "Efforts of Affection," cannily reveals aspects of her friend and mentor that made Bishop "realize more than I ever had the rarity of true originality, and also the sort of alienation it might involve" (Bishop, Prose, p. 140). * Moore's "originality" and her "alienation" are crucial to her construction of a poetic persona, a private and public self-fashioning that thoroughly encompassed her career as a writer. Integral to this self- fashioning and to her female subjectivity in the competitive scene of male modernism are Moore's animal identities. Moreover, her artistic self-fashioning was irreconcilably linked with competing claims of consumer culture, the marketplace of animal by-products and fashionable paraphernalia that were, and still are, markers of female status and economic privilege posing as signs of taste and cultural discernment.2 She coveted the animal natures she claimed as her imaginary possessions; 1.

Emberley's broad outline of related issues in The Cultural Politics of Fur (Cornell University Press, 1997) influences my approach to Moore's consumption of fur (see her introductory chapter, especially pp. 4-6): "I contend that the current configuration of the cultural politics of fur can best be understood by analyzing how fur acquires its value not only as a commodity, a luxury good, and article of trade, but also as an object invested with libidinal desires" (p. 4). My argument focuses primarily upon issues of economy, trade, and fashion associated with female ownership of fur and animal products, and their relationship to Moore's desire to possess these goods, both materially and aesthetically. These issues are in the foreground Alison Rieke, "'Plunder' or 'Accessibility to Experience': Consumer Culture and Marianne Moore's Modernist Self-Fashioning" Journal of Modern Literature, 11 All (Fall 2003), pp. 149-170 ? Indiana University Press, 2004.</page><page sequence="2">150 Journal of Modern Literature those natures came to signify the profound originality of her poetry and also an alienation from her own human nature ? and conventional constructions ofthe female as artist ? that became her stock in trade as a groundbreaking modernist. Crucial to any argument about Moore's self-fashioning is her agency, or the lack of it, in constructing herself for her readership, in her poetry and in her public performances. This includes her self-consciously created style for photographers and her lifelong interest in fashion and consumer goods. Moore, throughout her career, was caught between her self-critical acuity and an apparently unreflective consumption of fashion, especially fashion depending upon animal by-products. The issue must be treated as a paradox, as she both does and does not exhibit agency in her choices about self-fashioning.3 The questions she raises about animal natures and her conflicted ethical position about her obli- gations as an "imaginary possessor, /. . . 'lit with piercing glances into the life of things'" (CP, p. 48) are forcefully expressed in poems from the teens to her late work, through the innumerable creatures in her complex menagerie who stand in for Moore's identity as she promotes her brand of modern? ism. "Peter" (1925)4 the cat, for instance, "can see the virtue of naturalness, / that he does not regard the published fact as a surrender" (CP, p. 44). Several poems from Moore's early period, particularly "Critics and Connoisseurs" (1916) and "The Monkeys" (1917), show how her menagerie began to signify her unique stance as a modernist. In the 1921 poem "New York," its central subject ? the fur trade and consumer culture ? is entwined with Moore's national and artistic identity. By 1924, the animal natures signifying Moore's modernist originality are fully realized in "An Octopus," where her "imaginary garden" ("Poetry" [1919]) is elaborately grounded in the rich natural habitat of Mt. Rainier. The actual garden of the mountain becomes visionary as she depicts a mountain goat in its environment, "the ermine body on the crystal peak" (CP, p. 73). Moore's of Moore's public self-fashioning and her aesthetic investment in animal identities. Moore's well-publicized reticence, often characterized as prudery, sets aside or suppresses the issue of fur as a libidinal or sexual fetish, except in a few fleeting images of animal desire. One such example of this appears in "Marriage," with the speaker's puzzled and fascinated description of Adam as '"something feline, / something colubrine' -how true! / a crouching mythological monster" (CP, p. 63). While this would be an interesting area of future study, I do not have the space to develop that argument here. All subsequent page refer? ences to The Complete Poems of Marianne Moore (Macmillan/Viking, 1967) are cited parenthetically as (CP). 3. Moore's critics have recognized that her animal identifications helped her to differentiate herself from a historically and culturally masculine poetic community; they represent aspects of her resistance to conventional constructions of herself as a woman and a female writer. For instance, see Sabine Sielke, Fashioning the Female Subject: The Intertextual Networking ofDickinson, Moore, and Rich (The University of Michigan Press, 1997), p. 12, and Alicia Ostriker, "Marianne Moore, the Maternal Hero, and American Women's Poetry," in Marianne Moore: The Art ofa Modernist (UMI Research Press, 1990), ed. Joseph Parisi, pp. 53-55. Sandra Gilbert, in "Marianne Moore as Female Female Impersonator," in Parisi, ed., The Art ofa Modernist, p. 32-34, addresses issues related to Moore's self-fashioning and characterization of herself as an animal, to point out that these references are generally self-deprecating. Gilbert's argument specifically takes up Moore's "female female impersonation" as a "'masquerade' of femininity... .While Irigaray sees such a masquerade as a consequence of the fact that in patriarchal culture women are inevitably 'exiled from themselves,' I am suggesting ... that for women like Millay and Moore such a self-exile, such an ironic estrangement, were in some sense deliberate" (p. 32). Gilbert refers to Moore's self-exile as "freedom": "It is a freedom that this poet learned to imagine through her self-creation as a 'spinster' outsider ..." (p. 34). My approach thus fails between Gilbert's and Judith Butler's account of gender's "performative construction" in Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity (Routledge, Chapman &amp; Hall, Inc, 1990). Butler, invested as she is in Foucault's emphasis upon institutional power over the individual, denies that gender's "performative construction" (p. 25) can be willed and controlled; subjective choices are always limited by powerful institutions (the marketing of fashion would be one example): "Gender is the repeated stylization ofthe body, a set of repeated acts within a highly rigid regulatory frame that congeal over time to produce the appearance of a substance, of a natural sort of being" (p. 33). Butler's position is useful in accounting for Moore's rejection of conventional feminine gender performance and her adoption of animal identities. Yet Moore did make conscious choices about her self-fashioning, and aspects of my discussion to follow will show that she was aware of other women/artists who were making choices about how to present themselves publicly. 4.

But as her sentiments and arguments became more overt in her late poetry, she increasingly chose direct statement over modernist ambiguity, linguistic gaps, and enigma. The compression, ambivalence, and modernist difficulty of "New York" and "An Octopus" give way to transparent commentary and light moments of identifying herself with her menagerie, such as that depicted in "The Wood- Weasel" (1942): "Well, ? / this same weasel's playful and his weasel / associates are too. Only / Wood-weasels shall associate with me" (CP, p. 127). She turns to playful fable in "The Arctic Ox (or Goat)" of 1958, where her explicit example of proper consumption of animal products compromises, through simplification, her complex aesthetic involvement with animal natures. She wittily promotes a responsible position on animal welfare in a light-verse "advertisement" for consumers of fur (CP, p. 195). While her own eccentric brand of self-fashioning is still suggested by "The Arctic Ox," its message skirts the surface of issues Moore had so powerfully explored earlier in her career. Elephant-Hair Bracelet In "Efforts of Affection," Bishop relates an incident that will serve as an entry into the problem of Moore's idiosyncratic habits as a consumer, her poetic investment in animal identities, and their implications for her modernist self-fashioning. In 1934, Bishop encouraged a closer association with Moore by inviting her to the spring visit of Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus in New York City: "I didn't know that she always went to the circus, wouldn't have missed it for anything. ..." (Bishop, Prose, p. 125). On that day, Moore actually arrived ahead of Bishop, and "was loaded down: two blue cloth bags, one on each arm, and two huge brown paper bags, full of something. ... They contained, she told me, stale brown bread for the elephants ..." (Bishop, Prose, p. 125). Enlisting Bishop as her accomplice, Moore snatched hairs from a baby elephant for the purpose of repairing a bracelet made of black hairs held together with gold clasps. Bishop distracted the adult elephants with the stale bread so that Moore could cut the hairs with "a pair of strong nail scissors" she had in her bag (Bishop, Prose, pp. 125-126). "Her brother, Warner," Bishop notes, "had given her an elephant-hair bracelet, of which she was very fond.... One of the elephant hairs had fallen out and been lost. As I probably knew, elephant hairs grow only on the tops of the heads of very young elephants" (Bishop, Prose, p. 125): I stayed at one end ofthe line, putting slices of bread into the trunks ofthe older elephants, and Miss Moore went rapidly down to the other end, where the babies were. The large elephants were making such a to-do that a keeper did come up my way, and out of the corner of my eye I saw Miss Moore leaning forward over the rope on tiptoe, scissors in hand.... She opened her bag and showed me three or four coarse, grayish hairs in a piece of Kleenex. (Bishop, Prose, p. 126) Bishop needs only to relate this anecdote straightforwardly, without traces of humor or irony, to distill the character of her friend. Its idiosyncrasy speaks for itself. Though charming on its face, the incident subtly complicates Bishop's sketch of Moore. Bishop observes that Moore's passion? ate interest in the animals seemed to override any "pain and outrage" at seeing them caged. Bishop expresses her own dismay:</page><page sequence="4">152 Journal of Modern Literature I hate seeing animals in cages, especially small cages, and especially circus animals, but I think that Marianne, while probably feeling the same way, was so passionately interested in them, and knew so much about them, that she could put aside any pain or outrage for the time being. That day I remember that one handsomely patterned snake, writhing about in a glass-walled cage, seemed to raise his head on purpose to look at us. "See, he knows me!" said Miss Moore. "He remembers me from last year." This was a joke, I decided, but perhaps not altogether a joke. (Bishop, Prose, p. 126) For Bishop, Moore's comment underscores her preoccupation with her kinship to the animal kingdom, often for her a closer kinship than to the human animal. It also suggests the "alienation" Bishop had recognized in Moore's artistic nature. For Bishop, this relentless focus upon animal nature reveals that which is essential about Moore as woman and poet. On another outing together, the two poets saw "a documentary in color about Africa, with herds of gazelles and giraffes moving across the plains, and we loved it" (Bishop, Prose, pp. 140-41). Bishop quotes Moore's mother's response to a new poem, "Nine Nectarines &amp; Other Porcelain," that had diverged from Moore's habitual subject matter: "' Yes, I am so glad that Marianne has decided to give the inhabitants of the zoo ... a resf" (Bishop, Prose, p. 129). However, Moore's analysis of flora in "Nine Nectarines" remains linked to her commentary on fauna, as its companion poem is "The Buffalo."5 Bishop's own letters to Moore, as they built their literary friendship, confirm that Marianne's passion for her menagerie became a persistent mediator in their bond as women and poets. Bishop relayed accounts of exotic creatures she had viewed in various media, from film to art exhibits: "I am wondering if you have seen Martin Johnson's moving picture BaboonsT; "I also always go to take a look at the little Egyptian jerobas ? or gerobas, as the Metropolitan spells it" (One Art, p. 30).6 In April 1935, Bishop remarked in a letter to Moore, "I brought back some swan feathers, much superior to the one I sent you, which I shall give you," and asked, "Have you heard of the work of Miss Margaret Washburn of Vassar in Animal Psychology?" (One Art, p. 33). Bishop even wrote to Moore that she intended to enclose, if she could find it, one of three fish scales scraped from "a parrot fish" she caught in Key West (One Art, p. 79). Moore's elephant-hair bracelet becomes increasingly charged with personal, artistic, and eco? nomic significance when we examine other comments she made about it in her personal corre? spondence. Bishop had actually given a mistaken report of Marianne's acquisition in "Efforts of Affection" when she remarked that Warner gave the bracelet to her; Bishop does not explain how she drew this conclusion from her conversations with Moore (Bishop, Prose, p. 125). Yet in Feb? ruary of 1933 Moore wrote a letter to her wealthy patroness Bryher (Winifred Ellerman, also the patroness of H.D.) clarifying how and why she and her mother purchased it. The money spent on the bracelet was actually a gift from Bryher.7 Moore wrote Bryher to thank her for her generosity 5. See Robin G. Schulze's astute reading of both poems in "Marianne Moore's 'Imperious Ox, Imperial Dish' and the Poetry ofthe Natural World," Twentieth Century Literature 44 (Spring 1998), pp. 1-33. 6. All subsequent page references to Elizabeth Bishop, One Art, Letters, sel. and ed. Robert Giroux (Farrar, Straus, Giroux, 1994) are cited parenthetically as (One Art). 1. I can only speculate as to why Moore would not convey to Bishop that Bryher was the source of the money spent on the bracelet. Probably it reflects Moore's delicacy over revealing Bryher's patronage and the fact that she had taken money from someone outside the family. By naming Warner as the source, she brought the gift into the intimate family circle. Considering how detailed is her letter to Bryher over the bracelet, it is difficult to believe that she simply forgot the actual source of the money.</page><page sequence="5">Rieke: Moore's Modernist Self-Fashioning 153 (SLMM, pp. 295-297),8 and the heightened significance ofthe gift is evident in Moore's account of acquiring it. First there is a grateful opening: "What matchless friendship, for you to think toward us and invite us to open our hearts in distress" (p. 295). Following is Moore's account of her financial condition at the time: "We did lose most of my earnings, but have the greater part of the income we had before I went to The Dial, and Warner was so outraged at the thought of our losses that he is almost unbalanced in his determination to make it up to us ..." (p. 296). Warner, she reports, gave them money "that more than covers our rent, paying our telephone-bill, and subscribing to The Times ..." (p. 296). Then Moore rationalizes the purchase ofthe bracelet, after listing the woes of so many others with financial hardship. Finally, she suppresses responsibility for the purchase, or transfers it entirely to her mother: "Under such circumstances, to be buying jewelry seemed to me dastardly, but Mother was determined your gift should be brought before us constantly by some? thing we delight in, so you will know how much I must have said about elephant-hairs ? though unwittingly" (SLMM, p. 296). For Bryher's viewing, Moore sketched the bracelet four times with increasing fineness of detail (SLMM, p. 297). Her sketches, which also included notes about the shape, size, and colors ofthe original, are, perhaps, an artistic compensation for having extravagantly spent the money on jewelry. She transforms luxury or mere extravagance into aesthetic effort ? another way of justify- ing the expenditure. Buying this adornment, however, becomes justified on the grounds of poetic self-fashioning: it is one ofthe accouterments of Moore's trade as she evolves into the innovative modernist poet we come to know. It should come as no surprise that, by November 1934, Moore's bracelet becomes, in "The Buffalo," one of her many modernist emblems of natural form and function, here in a poem engag? ing the evolutionary history of her menagerie. "The Buffalo" laments the "scientifically deformed descendants ofthe aurochs," the savage ancestor of cattle bred for human use, the Holstein and the Hereford:9 "Yet / some would say the sparse-haired / buffalo has met / human notions best ? // unlike the elephant, / both jewel and jeweller in the hairs / that he wears ? " (CP, p. 27). Moore's inclusion of the elephant here is not out of place in a poem primarily about oxen and cattle, for a main source for the poem is the naturalist W. P. Pycraft's article describing the aurochs; he states that '"in stature they were but little inferior to elephants. .. .'"10 Moore affirms the elephant's superior ability to weave its own jewelry of its hair. She makes do with the human craft mirror- ing that effort in her bracelet ? and snatches a few hairs from the baby elephant at the circus to repair it. Despite the elephant's long history of service to humankind, and plunder for its ivory, it has escaped human breeding programs for domestication. In 1943, while continuing to grapple 8.

Knopf, 1997) are cited parenthetically as (SLMM). 9. Schulze, "Imperious Ox," p. 13; Schulze, pp. 8-9, discusses at length Moore's distrust of T. H. Huxley's "civilized and civilizing garden" and her interest in Darwin's 1868 essay The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication. The subject under scrutiny in "The Buffalo," Schulze points out, springs from Darwin's discussion ofthe many existing varieties of domestic cattle and the various types of cultivated peach as key examples ofthe mutability of species" (p. 9). Moore critiques the manner in which '"domesticated breeds show adaptation to [human] wants and pleasures'" (Darwin, quoted in Schulze, pp. 9-10). She reveres animals that have escaped such subjugation to human use through hybridization and domesticated breeding. "The Buffalo" goes on to contrast the Indian buffalo with domesticated oxen, and through this example Schulze asserts Moore's "ultimately profound, environmental ethic" (p. 15; see pp. 13-15). Yet another poem taking the elephant as its central subject and emblem in Moore's canon is "Black Earth," which she did not include in her Complete Poems. The poem is now available in Becoming Marianne Moore: The Early Poems, 1907-1924, ed. Robin G. Schulze (University of California Press, 2002), p. 87. 10. Quoted in Schulze, "Imperious Ox," p. 12.</page><page sequence="6">154 Journal of Modern Literature with their history of service to humans, Moore again praises the endurance, humility, and power of "Elephants," "embossed with wide ears, / invincibly tusked, made safe by magic hairs!" (CP, p. 128). In the phrase "invincibly tusked," readers might hear the kind of evasion Bishop recog? nized in Moore. However, the poem further elaborates the subject of plunder in ways that reconcile human and natural realms through ceremonial observance: an elephant dyed white performs the obedient and "blessed" carriage of "Buddha's Tooth": "see / the white elephant carry the cushion that / carries the casket that carries the Tooth. / Amenable to what, matched with him, are gnat // trustees, he does not step on them ..." (CP, p. 129). Moore's own notes to the poem indicate that she had read a book by George Jennison, Animals for Show and Pleasure in Ancient Rome, when developing it, citing the fact that Cicero deplored the sacrifice of elephants in the Roman Games (CP, p. 281). "Moore collected sculpted elephants all her life,"11 and this huge creature was one she could never evade in her study of the contact boundary between human and animal natures, for "His straight trunk seems to say: when / what we hoped for came to nothing, we revived" (CP, p. 129). She came to use virtually all of her selected creatures to point out privileged natural forms that fit function perfectly, these creatures imparting humbling instructions on style to Moore, who brought those principles to bear in her precision, persistence, and drive toward originality: animal natures exemplified true individuality. Bishop's close observations of their early friendship highlight the poet's idiosyncratic preoccu- pation with her menagerie, so evident in her public persona by the 1930s. Bishop astutely realized that this side of Moore was complemented by her consciously fashionable self-presentation ? also important to her profession as woman poet. In a letter to Moore, for example, Bishop registered an appreciative response to the stylish George Platt Lynes portrait that appeared in the Herald Tri- bune; Moore's Selected Poems had been published and was being reviewed (and sold out at Macy's [One Art, pp. 32-33]). Moore had long been alert to the fact that her female contemporaries self- consciously constructed their public, artistic identities through clothes and fashion. In a February 1921 letter to her brother, Moore described Bryher, whose novel Development she happened to be reading for The Dial: "She looks as if she were 18 or twenty but is 26, had some beautiful Empress Josephine clothes Hilda says which she discarded for plain silks and suits when she turned artist" (SLMM, p. 143). Scholars and critics persistently call attention to the tricorn hat and cape around which Moore designed her public image; in the late 1940s, she "walked into a milliner's shop and asked to be fitted as Washington Crossing the Delaware."12 As early as her college years at Bryn Mawr, Moore already favored this style of hat (among others; Moore routinely reported on hats in letters home): "I like very much the plain 3-cornered sailor and should invest in such (black) if you would allow me" (SLMM, p. 46; see also p. 29). Obviously the tricorn advanced the evolution of her complex artistic self-fashioning. Arguably, though, the elephant-hair bracelet ? and surely Moore's assortment of animal collectibles ? are as potently charged with aesthetic self-fashioning as her unique tricorn hat and cape.13 The bracelet was precisely the kind of object that differentiated Moore from the typical female consumer, a woman 11.

Her idiosyncratic collection of animal figurines undercut the conventional view that women tend to consume sentimental "precious moments" and the like. In fact, "a porcupine- quill birchbark round basket," "a baby adderskin," "an Egyptian pale rhinoceros-skin whip," "an ivory walrus tusk from the Greeley Expedition," "an Arctic ox of walrus ivory" represent a kind of consumption that might be typically thought of as masculine (Prose, pp. 598-599).14 Moore so revered the innumerable animal collectibles she gathered over her lifetime that an impressive list of them appears in her essay "Dress and Kindred Subjects" (Prose, pp. 598-599), published in Women's Wear Daily in 1965. These objects came to represent her own peculiar brand of "com? modity fetish,"15 a form of consumption that seemed to accommodate her as a naturalist and poet.16 Even in the title of her essay there is an obvious acknowledgement that her animal possessions, as "Kindred Subjects" to fashion, have everything to do with her self-fashioning. These collectibles, both representing animals and made of animal products, became so associated with her poetic self- fashioning that friends and admirers routinely supplied her with more of them as gifts, her friend Elizabeth Bishop among her eager collectors.17 Thus she became the "imaginary possessor" (CP, p. 48) ofthe aesthetic artifacts and the physical remains ofthe animal natures she coveted and wrote about in her poetry. As she became more immersed in her role as a major modernist poet, Moore reinvented her? self as an animal in human skin. She adopted for herself the various animal identities she wrote about ? the plumet basilisk is one noted example of this identification (see letter to John Warner Moore, SLMM, pp. 274-275). For Bryher and H.D. she became "pterodactyl" (also shortened to "Dactyl") in an active exchange of letters (see, for instance, SLMM, pp. 142,151,159). At times for Moore this kind of reverse anthropomorphism accompanied changes in gender.18 A preoccupation with animal natures permeated her private and public life from a very early age ? her most intimate family bonds with her mother and brother, built upon these animal identities, are amply display ed in the family correspondence.19 As we shall see, these personal correspondences with the creature world show up early in her published poetry, where a fusion of human and animal identity began to provide the platform for modernist originality. Such poems as "Critics and Connoisseurs" and "The Monkeys," published in 1916 and 1917 respectively, outline elements of subject and style 14. All subsequent page references to Complete Prose of Marianne Moore, ed. Patricia C. Willis (Viking, 1986) are cited parenthetically as (Prose). 15. Emberley, p. 4. 16. Moore denied that she was "a collector" of "favorite possessions" (Prose, p. 598), but Lisa Steinman in '"So As to Be One Having Some Way of Being One Having Some Way of Working': Marianne Moore and Literary Tradition," in Gendered Modernisms: American Women Poets and Their Readers (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1996), ed. Margaret Dickie and Thomas Travisano, has commented that "Moore's list of multicultural curios [in "Dress and Kindred Subjects"] is perilously close to a fetishized list" (p. 110). 17. Costello, Goodridge, and Miller, ed. and introductions, SLMM, describe the way in which gifts of clothing became habitual to Moore's public presentation in her later years: "The poet's lifelong interest in stylish clothes and accessories was much indulged by her wealthy friends, and Moore went to many celebrity events outfitted in the dresses, jackets, hats, pearls, diamonds, boas, and fox furs ... given her.... Again, these gifts were occasions for descriptive flourish" (p. 488). 18. Elizabeth Gregory, Quotation and Modern American Poetry: " 'Imaginary Gardens with Real Toads'" (Rice University Press, 1996), discusses Moore's references to herself with masculine pronouns and her relationship with her mother and brother in the "complex gendering within the family," which may suggest her professional entry into the "'masculine' world of poetry" (pp. 139-140). See also Molesworth, p. 141. 19. Moore's descriptions of herself as an animal, not necessarily female, appear in countless letters to her mother and brother, and various other literary friends, such as Bryher and H.D. Many of these self-portraits are brief, often only a few words or phrases.</page><page sequence="8">156 Journal of Modern Literature that Moore so boldly asserted in the 1919 poem "Poetry," with its mandate that "genuine," "useful" poetry will be "above / insolence and triviality" and will "present / for inspection, 'imaginary gardens with real toads in them'" (CP, p. 267). White Chamois Gloves Moore's idiosyncratic focus on a few creatures began to shape her unique artistic identity at Bryn Mawr, and this shaping required that she distance herself from her human identity. Yet, around the time of her entrance at Bryn Mawr, Moore "had not only begun to be very conscious of fashion and dress, but to write about it to her brother."20 The youthful Moore subscribed to the view, as her mother obviously did, that clothing and outward self-presentation were markers of character and taste. During these years, her attitudes toward consumer goods, styles, and fashion for women were remarkably conventional, considering that eventually her modernist poetics would take her to the center of avant-garde innovation. At Bryn Mawr, Moore's social comfort clearly depended upon the appropriateness and quality of her attire. In letters home, she described with minute precision her wardrobe, its care, and the fashions worn by the other students: "The hats all look like moulds for fancy cakes; many are entirely covered with feathers and some with fur. I didn't see anything that could compare with my hat" (SLMM, p. 16). In the fall of 1905, in one detailed letter to her mother and brother, she remarked of a class- mate: [Miss Witherspoon] has the most perfectly marked soft calfskin on a large table and a thick rattlesnake skin reaching from the ceiling to the floor. The calfskin is uneven giving the beast's shape and has little ears and eyeholes. It is a great fad here to have skins for tablecovers or to have them over the backs of chairs or on the floor. One girl has the most beautiful leopard skin rug. A great many of the girls have Atlantic City plush bears and every girl I know has a China animal or grotesque likeness of one. The Fawn would attract great attention here by reason of her spots and velvet ears. (SLMM, p. 14) Moore's eye for precise detail is notable here ? her tendency to list and catalogue objects intriguing to her. Her apparent lack of ambivalence toward these cultural icons of privileged slaughter and the hunt is not surprising for her time, and in fact she too covets a "perfectly marked soft calfskin," with its revealing "beast's shape" and diminutive "ears and eyeholes," and the "most beautiful leopard skin rug." Such consumption is a "great fad" among the girls at Bryn Mawr, and one can hear approval and not a little admiration in the youthful Moore over owning and displaying such items. The playful reference to her mother, "Fawn," who owned that identity in their complicated family menagerie (SLMM, p. 14), appears an unusual aside in the description, and needs biographical explanation. Otherwise, this admiring description expresses what one would expect to hear at the time from any young woman of eighteen, thrown in among the socially well to do at Bryn Mawr, with an implicit acceptance that these objects are desired markers of cultural privilege. Moore distinguishes the "one" girl who owns the "leopard skin rug" from "every girl I know [who] has a China animal or grotesque likeness of one," elevating the richer catch over the mass-produced fakes. She has been indoctrinated into a system of preferences for originals instead of copies. Over 20. Molesworth, p. 25; see also pp. 50-51.</page><page sequence="9">Rieke: Moore's Modernist Self-Fashioning 157 and over again in letters home, Moore catalogued items in the wardrobes of her peers, and her fascination with animal trappings is already making itself apparent in these descriptions: "I went to tea today ... Miss Shearer was there to my pleasure, and Miss Bascom came. It has been my dear desire to get to meet her, so I settled down and talked.... She had on a blue suit, rather green, and a peacock toque, green-blue feathers perfectly exquisite in a stiff brim ? and sealskin collar thing and muff ? and white chamois gloves" (SLMM, p. 68). In August of 1910, Moore reported to her mother and brother that "Cousin Mary sent me some lovely white chamois gloves. I admired hers when she was here and she said 'if you like these I am going to send you some. I was wishing I could give you some little memento of this trip and I'll just get you those.' Wasn't it kind?" (SLMM, p. 82). The fine Ieather of the European mammal, Rupricapra rupricapra, normally grayish yellow, is here "white," having been put through the process of alum tanning and brush dying.21 Obviously, Moore would not have concerned herself with a manufacturing process in which "an imported kidskin might yield up to one and a half pairs, a lambskin would vary between one and two pairs, but a sheepskin could provide up to three or more pairs."22 Moore and her mother were committed to quality, even when pinched by frugality, and presumably Moore's gloves were the real article, though actual chamois was more expensive than imitations (a "shammy Ieather" was sheep or lamb? skin simulated to look like chamois). The need for white gloves also evokes the code of behavior among privileged college women, dictating that white gloves were, at that time, still necessary in any proper woman's wardrobe.23 Of course, many a social occasion required these gloves, and Moore fell into step with the set of dress codes and obligations at Bryn Mawr.24 Even as Moore's descriptions of the human animal become oddly anti-anthropomorphic, there are rarely traces of irony in her admiration of the fashionable Bryn Mawr set. She may have longed for white chamois gloves, but inside her was a deepening intellectual and artistic loyalty to her revered poetic menagerie. By 1910, one year out of Bryn Mawr, she would comment in a letter to her brother, "I don't know where I should like to live unless in a nautilus shell" (SLMM, p. 86). She would discover ? though not without a nagging ambivalence ? that her aesthetic, intellectual, ethical, and spiritual codes conflicted with codes of value placed on animal products in the marketplace. In the foreground of her poetry she increasingly asked a key question: what is the connection between natural form and function and human artistic endeavor? For authorities whose hopes are shaped by mercenaries? Writers entrapped by teatime fame and by commuters' comforts? Not for these the paper nautilus constructs her thin glass shell. (CP, p. 121) 21.

"Although the correctness of wearing certain types of glove with particular clothes in specific circumstances was impor? tant in the early years of this century, the rigid etiquette of the nineteenth century gradually disappeared" (Cumming, p. 76). 24. Moore obviously felt pressured by the social conventionality stressed in her upbringing: "Her mother, for her part, wrote back to give Marianne a detailed set of instructions on how to fold her napkin, how to eat rolls, and when to stand up and how; these things, Mrs. Moore urged, should become second nature to her," to which Marianne replied with praise for the erratic and "original" Peggy James (daughter of William James and friend to Moore at Bryn Mawr) (Molesworth, p. 49).</page><page sequence="10">158 Journal of Modern Literature Marianne Moore had begun to make a unique poetic fashion statement, with its odd focus upon the animal natures with which she sought corporeal identification. This identification persisted in Moore's eccentric transformations of herself and others into animals, and at some point during these years, Moore began to habitually reverse the hierarchy of human over animal. Eventually her anti- anthropocentrism would underscore an animal kinship for herself (and her mother and brother), as she described the contours of her own body, both critically and playfully, like those of an animal. Moore's idiosyncratic originality and her innovative poetic perspective, at the service of her menagerie, surface in a number of poems dated from roughly 1916 through 1924. She won the pres- tigious Dial Award for poetry in 1924, and the Dial Press then published her volume Observations. Notably, "To A Snail" (1924) praises elements of style that this humble creature exhibits in its bio? logical structure. It possesses "compression ... the first grace of style'" and a fundamental practice in Moore's poetic experimentation, her abandonment of metered verse for syllabics: the snail's form represents "the principle that is hid: / in the absence of feet, 'a method of conclusions,'" and in the "curious phenomenon of [its] occipital horn," '"a knowledge of principles'" (CP, p. 85). The 1917 "Critics and Connoisseurs" affirms not only her modernist insistence upon new kinds of subjects for poetry but also her stylistic and intellectual approach to those subjects. It begins, "There is a great amount of poetry in unconscious / fastidiousness.. . . / but I have seen something / that I like better" (CP, p. 38). Her catalogue of unassuming, wholly natural, and precisely observed "phenomena" bears kinship with the lists in her persistently anthologized 1919 poem "Poetry": she documents "a / mere childish attempt to make an imperfectly bal- / lasted animal stand up" and "determination to make a pup / eat his meat from the plate" (CP, p. 38). Her trademark use of syllabics instead of metered feet poises the reader in a balancing act between one line and the next. She creates a line division mid-word: "bal- / lasted" suspends the moment, keeping the animal upright a bit longer, stylistically delaying its fall. Also, the speaker's observation ofthe reconnoitering swan illustrates qualities of Moore's own originality: "Disbelief and conscious fastidiousness were / ingredients in its / disinclination to move" (CP, p. 38). "A fastidious ant carrying a stick north, south, / east, west, till it turned on / itself reinforces this observation, underscoring Moore's "conscious fastidiousness" in noting the direction of its carriage. Moore often composes her creature world of exotics we know nothing about until they have been "present[ed] for inspection" in her poetry, but plain or strange, her menagerie rarely fails to elicit responses of curious "disbelief in her readership. "The Monkeys," first appearing in 1919 in Alfred Kreymborg's Others: An Anthology ofNew Verse as "My Apish Cousins,"25 is an ambiguous effort on Moore's part to neutralize the voices of critics who caused irritation, even rage, as she attempted to carve out a position for herself in the world of art and letters. Moore replaced the original title: it seems to have been too transparently self-referential, and, I would argue, self-fashioning, as it articulated its sensitive subject matter.26 Modernist distancing devices in the poem keep emotion in check, primarily her use of quotation to deliver her message, and her allusion to the "eat" as the heroic Gilgamesh ? these devices are the trademarks of her alignment with innovations familiar in the poetry of Pound and Eliot.27 The poem has a defensive edge to it, barely concealing its annoyance over "malignant" pronouncements 25. Holley, p. 197. 26. In Costello's view, Moore felt that the original title too obviously rendered her metaphorical caged animals as artists, though she refrains from revealing "the analogy until the image has registered in a literal way" (p. 30). 27. Costello comments that the "cat" figure as Gilgamesh may suggest Ezra Pound (p. 31), though the figure is usually understood by critics to be a type of artist or poet who speaks for other artists.</page><page sequence="11">Rieke: Moore's Modernist Self-Fashioning 159 about art (and the people who make them), views that were imposingly delivered through "half- fledged protestations .. . / in inarticulate frenzy" (CP, p. 40). These fixed "inconceivably arcanic, as symmet- / rically frigid" opinions, antithetical to Moore's struggle to innovate, are characterized as "strict with tension, malignant." She cleverly disrupts "symmetry" through typography, assert- ing that words can be hyphenated at the ends of poetic lines. What seems particularly odious in the poem's depiction of frenzied critics, denounced by the heroic cat, "that Gilgamesh / among / the hairy carnivora," is the indictment of those who sell out artists, and, by suggestion, artists who sell out for critical flattery. The poem closes with a threatening image ofthe sea (a symbolic designation repeated in her frequently anthologized poem "A Grave"): "malignant / in its power over us and deeper / than the sea when it proffers flattery in exchange for / hemp, / rye, flax, horses, platinum, timber, and fur" (CP, p. 40). Notably, this list makes an important early reference to the consumer goods that preoccupy Moore throughout her career, items taken from their original state in nature and transformed for the marketplace: "timber" being not simply trees, but trees cut to be sold; "fur" the precious product of the slain animal; "hemp" the plant transformed into rope; "flax" into cloth; "platinum" into a variety of precision tools and jewelry; "rye" into whiskey and bread. Her choice of the word "proffer" (over, say, "offer") is exact: in its legal sense, it means an offer of money or service in payment of an obligation, and in its commercial sense, it is a written offer to contract goods or services at a specified cost or rate; a bid. This list of consumer goods seems to stand in direct contrast to the animals listed in the first half of the poem, who, despite the fact that they are recalled as caged zoo animals, still have a certain magnificence and the power of "ornament / speech" (CP, p. 40). Moore's modernist effort in "The Monkeys" seems intentionally difficult and ambiguous, its details finally irreducible to a focal idea; it employs some of the esoteric obscurity indicted by the Gilgamesh cat's pronouncement. However, the list of creatures in the first half of the poem refers, in a muted way, to Moore's persistently emerging subject matter, her menagerie, viewed on a trip to the zoo, creatures whose style and manner, she insists, bridge the gap between poetic artifice and natural habit, her '"imaginary gardens'" and the '"real toads in them'" (CP, p. 267)."28 Teepees of Ermine Moore's interest in animal collectibles and "Kindred Subjects" (Prose, pp. 596-599), trimmings of fur upon articles of clothing, is linked to her stance as a scientific precisionist and poetic naturalist. Moreover, her attraction to science, her fascination with zoology, anthropology, and biology, first as a student at Bryn Mawr and then as a professional poet, would have been considered masculine in her time.29 Yet these items also brought exotic, distant cultures and experiences home to Moore in the urban America of the early twentieth century. She willingly consumed the products brought 28. Interestingly, in 1922, Moore would be criticized by Harriet Monroe, editor of Poetry in "A Symposium on Marianne Moore," in Poetry 19 (January 1922), p. 210, for her "inauthentic, forced quality," as "overwrought unnatural products of a woman in terror of her own muse. She referred more than once to the 'grotesque' habit of Moore's verse, her proclivity to distort natural speech into absurd 'verbal whimsicalities' that 'strike at once the intensely false note of affectation'" (see Schulze, ed., Becoming Marianne Moore, pp. 26-27). 29. Laura Behling points out, in The Masculine Woman in America, 1890-1935 (University of Illinois Press, 2001), that women's colleges were increasingly adopting a curriculum traditionally offered to men: "Working against traditional wisdom and medical practice that predicted dire physical consequences if women exercised their minds, numerous schools began with the sole purpose of educating women, often in the same subject matter as men's. Detractors worried that these college-educated women would lose their femininity," and be directed "away from marriage and motherhood" (pp. 177-178).</page><page sequence="12">160 Journal of Modern Literature back to the American marketplace by male adventurers who undertook costly, dangerous expedi- tions to acquire them, expeditions such as Theodore Roosevelt's, who, after his presidency, set out to collect big game specimens for an exposition at the Smithsonian. The trip was underwritten by Charles Scribner's Sons for $50,000, who then published Roosevelt's account of the expedition, the 1910 African Game Trails.30 In 1919, Moore commented on Roosevelt's book in a letter to her brother, and she seemed to view it with a mixture of detached interest and disdain.31 Moore had been working at the Hudson Park Branch of the New York Public Library when she observed to Warner that she hadn't much use for "'sporty' boy's fiction like Alger's and for stories of fights and trapping" (SLMM, p. 125), and this included Huckleberry Finn. At this time, Moore increasingly appears to have understood the ways in which trapping and hunting fueled consumer fetishes regarding fur. Even so, she appears to have coveted the exotic paraphernalia that represented both fashionable consumption ? decorative trimming on hats, coats, gloves, and dresses ? and an intellectual, scientific, and aesthetic access to remote cultures, ambiva- lently represented by Roosevelt's plunder of skins. It is no wonder that her fascination with animal products seems incommensurate with her evolving humane politics, which were revealed in her response to the lavish material consumption of animals so evident in fashionable New York City. By 1919 she registered an ambivalent mixture of admiration, respect, and sadness upon vie wing a display of skins in Gunther's window. Her culturally heightened interest in such displays emanates from the popularity of Roosevelt's book, and is reinforced by the school curriculum: Roosevelt is the subject of the hour upstairs and down. The encyclopedias and Who's Who are putty colored at the sections devoted to him. The schools require information about him, have assigned him as a subject, that is, which partly explains it. Every shop in town has had a Roosevelt feature of some sort in the window. The best was Gunther's, a marvelous display of skins hanging forward like tent flaps from the rear of the window, with a typewritten quotation from African Game Trails. An elephant skin, a zebra's skin, a great monkey skin which was thick and fine like squirrel skin, an antelope's skin and two mammoth snake skins. It was a heart-rending sight but all the people seemed to look at it with joyful awe [emphasis minel. Lord and Taylor's and various other stores had fifth rate, very tawdry imitations ofthe Gunther display_(SLMM, p. 125) Precisionist that she was, Moore doubtlessly knew the extent ofthe "heart-rending" sacrifice which produced African Game Trails: Roosevelt, his son, and the other naturalists in their expedition, in the span ofa year, shot over 3000 specimens, including 11 elephants, 20 rhinoceroses, 17 lions, 7 cheetahs, 29 zebras, 8 hippopotamuses, 7 giraffes, 10 buffalo, and 47 gazelles.32 Yet even with the 30. Scribner's paid Roosevelt $50,000 for twelve articles, which were then published in book form. See Stefan Lorant, The Life and Times of Theodore Roosevelt (Doubleday &amp; Company, 1959), p. 514. 31. In December 1907, after a trip to Washington, D.C., Moore "observed Teddy Roosevelt attending church and ebulliently expressed a wish to have him come and give the commencement address at Bryn Mawr" (Molesworth, p. 42). While she took a radical position on suffrage and women's rights (Molesworth, p. 58) in her college years, she became politically conservative and Republican in her support of candidates for the presidency (Molesworth, pp. 58-59, 143). 32. Theodore Roosevelt describes in African Game Trails: The Classic Big Game Safari, 1 vols. (Charles Scribner's Sons, 1932) how he and his son Kermit killed 512 mammals and birds "with the rifle" (vol. II, pp. 568-570), though far more than that not documented by number with the shot gun (vol. II, pp. 570-571). The total number of birds, mammals, and reptiles collected by Roosevelt and other members of the expedition well exceeds 3000. See Appendix D to African Game Trails, which documents the biological survey of Mount Kenia of Dr. Mearns and Mr. Loring, naturalists on the expedition (vol. II, pp. 606-608).</page><page sequence="13">Rieke: Moore's Modernist Self-Fashioning 161 growing humane movement in America early in the century, attitudes toward such consumption were tolerant and even admiring. Expeditions such as Roosevelt's were designed to serve public education at institutions such as the prestigious Smithsonian. Roosevelt himself, with his political record as a conservationist, was highly sensitive to charges of indiscriminate slaughter; he heavily qualified the nature and purpose of bagging so many animals by claiming they were killed exclusively for scientific and educational purposes.33 As a consumer, Moore's fascination with furs and skins is typical of her time. Nevertheless, her response to the window displays of skins is intriguing for its muted ambivalence. She registers a dismayed sadness at the cost of such mastery over the animal kingdom. Andrew Lakritz has examined the issue of Moore's complex and unusual response to animal natures in her construc? tion of her bestiary.34 Citing Walter Benjamin's entry called "Gloves" in One Way Street, Lakritz concludes that Moore "writes profoundly in her poetry concerning the question of the animal in relation to the cultural, but she does so without the sense of horror Benjamin insists lies at the root of such a phenomenon."35 We note that, viewing these displays, Moore does draw back from horror, the feeling that must have swept over her prompting the phrase "heart-rending." Detaching herself from that reaction, she critiques and compares the quality of similar displays that she has noticed in many fashionable shop windows. As we have seen, Moore's dual and not incompatible reaction to this form of human mastery and consumption is characteristic of her. She felt "heart rending" pain over the display, but she may also include herself in the general phrase "all the people" in referring to those who felt "joyful awe" in viewing it. Moore judged this display to be the most impressive among many imitators, comparing it with the "fifth rate" Lord and Taylor's. Throughout her career, Moore used her poetic exploration of the animal kingdom to critique aspects of human nature,36 including the human need to consume, control, and ultimately possess animal natures. Her urge to possess animal products, items representing the very economy of privi? lege and luxury that makes a fetish of such products, stands in opposition to her poetic intellect and her conscience as the "imaginary possessor" (CP, p. 48) ofthe animal kingdom she came to revere through aesthetic effort. The youthful Moore quite naturally succumbed to the privileged consumer trends of her Bryn Mawr environment. In the Bryn Mawr years, we catch glimpses of an emerging humane politics, but these glimpses of deep sympathy for the natural world, and for the variety of creatures that would become her complex menagerie, are confused with a consumerism she cannot escape. It did not take long for her to realize what that such consumption came at a huge cost. By 1921, Moore had written and published "New York," a poem that emerges out of her experi? ence of seeing displays like the one in Gunther's in New York department store windows.37 Moore constructs an enigmatic assemblage of images in "New York" in a form that resists single, final 33.

Lakritz, Modernism and the Other in Stevens, Frost, and Moore (University Press of Florida, 1996 ), the combination of fascination and dismay Moore expresses here cannot be equated with the kind of horror Walter Benjamin describes in human confrontations with bestial nature. Lakritz discusses, for example, Kafka's Metamorphosis and Stoker's Dracula, to make the point that "What is missing [in Moore] is horror, the sublime" (pp. 124-125). "Wearing gloves is a part ofthe strategy for producing mastery over the animal and, in fact, is a useful metaphor: it defines the division between nature and culture in the first place" (p. 125). 35. Lakritz, p. 126. 36. See Lakritz, p. 123. 37. According to Linda Leavell, Marianne Moore and the Visual Arts: Prismatic Color (Louisiana State University Press, 1995), another potential source of inspiration for Moore's construction of ideas in this poem is Marguerite Zorach's "'wool map ofNew York in minute stitches'" (pp. 120-23).</page><page sequence="14">162 Journal of Modern Literature formulation or meaning.38 The poem's ambiguity underscores the deeply complex and divided posi? tion Moore takes regarding postwar materialism, consumer culture, and fashion, including "remov- ing tribal artifacts to a museum or even to an artist's canvas."39 It appears to express, without irony and with admiring precision, the kind of enthusiasm she felt when she saw a fur belonging to her classmate during her college years. Yet Moore, an avid shopper at Wanamaker's department store in both Philadelphia and New York, has evolved as a poet, and she employs this subject matter to present a discerning critique of commodity culture in New York.40 Her developing awareness that skins and furs are particularly enticing consumer fetishes caused her to think through a position about human "plunder" in "New York." As Molesworth comments, in his discussion of the poem, "Furs are representative of the savage state of nature and at the same time the symbols of wealth and status, combining nature and culture in a condensed form."41 Moore's subjective desire to own such goods and her own need to explain how her self-fashioning is invested in these commodities are embedded problems within the poem.421 quote it here in full: New York the savage's romance, accreted where we need the space for commerce ? the center of the wholesale fur trade, starred with tepees of ermine and peopled with foxes, the long guard-hairs waving two inches beyond the body of the pelt; the ground dotted with deer-skins ? white with white spots, "as satin needlework in a single color may carry a varied pattern," and wilting eagle's-down compacted by the wind; and picardels of beaver-skin; white ones alert with snow. It is a far cry from the "queen full of jewels" and the beau with the muff, from the gilt coach shaped like a perfume-bottle, to the conjunction of the Monongahela and the Allegheny, and the scholastic philosophy of the wilderness. It is not the dime-novel exterior, Niagara Fails, the calico horses and the war-canoe; it is not that "if the fur is not finer than such as one sees others wear, one would rather be without it" ? that estimated in raw meat and berries, we could feed the universe; it is not the atmosphere of ingenuity, the otter, the beaver, the puma skins 38. Leavell, p. 123-25. 39. Leavell, p. 119. 40. Molesworth has made the point, in discussing Moore's attitude toward New York City, that "she remained more than a little uneasy about its mores, and about the way it tended to exaggerate fashionableness as a value in itself; New York was a "locus of much that was glamorous and satisfying, and much that was superficial and distracting" (pp. 239-^10). 41. Molesworth, p. 241. 42. A number of elements in the poem emerge out of Moore's personal experience and biographical background, as Leavell has pointed out in her close reading of "New York," upon which I depend for my view of it as an "enigmatic assemblage" (pp. 123-24).</page><page sequence="15">Rieke: Moore's Modernist Self-Fashioning 163 without shooting-irons or dogs; it is not the plunder, but "accessibility to experience." (CP, p. 54) The poem encapsulates Moore's fascination with the boundless material goods the "savage" Ameri? can wilderness had to offer and the equally boundless "accessibility to experience" that she would finally discover, once commodity materialism had been recognized for what it was and intellectually negated. The poem develops out of its focus on New York's twentieth-century commercial wealth, metonymically represented by the fur trade that had grown up out of the natural resources of our "savage" past and trade with the Indians for furs and skins. In 1921, New York had overtaken St. Louis as the capital ofthe fur trade, a fact from a newspaper item that prompted Moore to acknowl? edge "the completion of a parallel movement in her own career."43 In a metamorphic image of New Yorkers as animals in skins, Moore lists the potential material treasures ofthe American wilderness, admiring our native foxes, deer, and beaver. Her choice ofthe verb "accreted" in the second line aptly conveys the increase of wealth in New York as the center of world trade. Economic capital is literally worn on the backs of New Yorkers. Moore evokes the biological definition of "accreted" ? any growing together of plant or animal tissues that are nor- mally separate ? semantically completing a fusion of human with animal nature. She evokes the European and American past, along with elements of her biographical passage from her birthplace in the wilderness of St. Louis to New York City, her move to Carlisle, Pennsylvania, to the conjunc? tion of the Monongahela and the Allegheny at Pittsburgh, and beyond. After the first nine lines of the poem, where Moore "takes great delight in the furs as objects in their own right,"44 Moore structures her remaining observations about American national identity around a series of negations that keep the temptations of a rich commodity culture in check. As her lens widens beyond New Yorkers who embody the benefits and hazards of our national resources, she searches for the significance of this identity in a list of grammatical negations. These "it is nots" qualify the significance of the city, and the American wilderness beyond it, through negative definition. They seem to say that America's "savage's romance" cannot be understood as another version of European wealth and plunder, as it is "a far cry" from "the 'queen full of jewels'" and "the gilt coach shaped like a perfume-bottle." She notes that such natural resources as Americans have, "raw meat and berries," could feed the universe, but its significance is not that either. It is not superficially wealthy, unintellectual, and innocent, just a "dime-novel exterior"; yet it does not possess the European "atmosphere of ingenuity," so closely studied by Henry James in his novels. Rather, "the otter, the beaver, the puma skins" representing our wealth have been captured savagely in the American wilderness. In these condensed images, Moore embeds a contrast between European and American styles of hunting, yet a gentrified hunt with dogs and, ironically, "shooting-irons," also evokes the six-shooters of the wild-west. The final lines, quoting Henry James, deny that the significance of New York lies in its "plunder" at all but in its '"accessibility to experience.'" Moore seems acutely aware here that she must display our plunder to offer an honest, genuine look at our national identity, but the final two lines rationalize and even justify this wealth to resolve 43.

Molesworth, p. 242.</page><page sequence="16">164 Journal of Modern Literature the issues opened up in the poem as a whole. Despite the ambivalence we sense in Moore's assem- blage, one quotation in particular demonstrates her awareness that commodity culture is built on plunder and that it could seriously compromise spiritual, aesthetic, and intellectual values. Lines seventeen and eighteen, in the middle of the list of "it is nots," are taken from Frank Alvah Parsons' The Psychology of Dress, published in 1920. Moore had read this volume and recorded passages from it in her notebook.45 It explores the ways in which clothing is a key to cultural values. The passage Moore chooses to quote follows an image of Indians' ponies, "calico horses," and primitive war canoes: "it is not that 'if the fur is not finer than such as one sees others wear, / one would rather be without it.'" In her own notes to the poem, Moore quotes the pertinent passage from Parsons' book, showing that she has altered what was a reference to fine cloth in the original to a reference to fur: "I wish black cloth even if it cost ten ducats a yard. If it is only as good as that which I see other people wear, I had rather be without it" (my emphasis; CP, p. 269). Moore's switch from cloth to fur makes the quotation more pertinent to her subject matter in "New York," but it also heightens the emphasis upon the Duchess of Gonzaga's gluttonous consumption of fur, amply illustrated in passages that precede the quotation Moore cited in the poem: It is only natural that one who bestowed so much thought, time, and money upon collections and the decoration of her palace should have a corresponding interest in the costumes which would not only express the taste of one of the greatest patrons of Renaissance art, but which would at once mark the wearer as fitted to express the particular rank of autocratic social leader.... On a visit to Milan it is recorded that the young Duchess [of Gonzaga] was determined to make a brave show on this occasion.... Zorzo Brognolo, the Gonzagas' trusted agent in Venice, was desired to search all the shops in Venice for eighty of the very finest sables to make a sbernia or mantle. "Try to find one skin with the head of the animal," Isabella adds, "to make a muff, which I can carry in my hands. Never mind if it costs as much as ten ducats...." A few days later she entreats Giacomo Trotti, the Duke of Ferrara's ambassador at Milan, to send her two skins of Spanish cat, the best and finest that are to be found in that city, to trim this sumptuous mantle....46 An examination of the entire passage from Parsons shows that Moore intentionally replaced a relatively neutral consumer product, cloth, with a culturally charged fetish, fur, an item she repeat? edly pondered morally and intellectually in her acquisition of cultural experience. Does the poem distinguish between the history of American plunder that made New York a center of trade and the plunder of European nobility? It appears to try, but the gaps between the items are difficult if not impossible to bridge in a close reading of this enigmatic assemblage. Thus they heighten the poet's ambivalence about the subject matter, so crucial to her self-fashioning. Finally, though, Moore appears to concede that American commodities, integral to our national identity, must be approached with respect for their complex "savage" origin. Moreover, they must be thoughtfully consumed with 45. Molesworth, p. 241. 46.

In the early 1920s Moore was photographed by Marjori studio in New York holding a large fur muff, her hand just poised to disappear into it.47 In 1921, Moore had pondered in "New York" the significance of goods vital to her '"accessibility to experience'" as a poet who also wore her imaginary possessions in her own muffs, coats, and hats. By 1924, after her trip to Mount Rainier, Moore wrote "An Octopus." Here, she projected an American wilderness more detailed, precise, and intricate than any of her "imaginary gardens" to date. It finally defies the "Neatness of finish" evoked at its close, but "Relentless accuracy is the nature of this octopus / with its capacity for fact" (CP, p. 76), as it is for Moore herself. In this elaborate poetic space, the shape of the octopus creates a visual pun ? another mark of Moore's modernist ingenuity and originality ? with the tentacled glacier on Mt. Rainier seen from above. The Mt. Rainier National Park Guidebook (1922) appears to have suggested her title, as a sketch of the mountain and its pattern of glaciers as seen from above resembles an octopus.48 With typical precision, she also quotes the 1922 Department ofthe Interior Rules and Regulations, The National Parks Portfolio (Moore's notes, CP, p. 273), and other sources, in the poem.49 "An Octopus" unre- servedly catalogues its flora and fauna, mineral and gem deposits, as a virtually unexploited natural habitat. Moore's artistic preservation ofthe wilderness in "An Octopus" stands in stark contrast to a work such as Roosevelt's African Game Trails. A mountain goat suffices as her astonishing emblem of the power of living magnificence: And farther up, in a stag-at-bay position as a scintillating fragment of these terrible stalagmites, stands the goat, its eye fixed on the waterfall which never seems to fall ? an endless skein swayed by the wind, immune to force of gravity in the perspective of the peaks. A special antelope acclimated to "grottoes from which issue penetrating draughts which make you wonder why you came," it stands its ground on cliffs the color of the clouds, of petrified white vapor ? black feet, eyes, nose, and horns, engraved on dazzling ice-fields, the ermine body on the crystal peak; the sun kindling its shoulders to maximum heat like acetylene, dyeing them white ?

Olympic National Park, on the Olympic Pen- insula west of Mount Rainier, which Leavell also finds pertinent to "An Octopus" (p. 181, note 19), was authorized in 1909 See "National Parks," The Concise Columbia Encyclopedia (1983 ed.).</page><page sequence="18">166 Journal of Modern Literature goat, a creature often associated with base instincts, are regally dressed in "ermine" and glow as if they had been set on fire with an acetylene torch, intensifying their natural color of white.50 In 1932 Moore will again contrast human plunder with nature's riches in "The Jerboa" (CP, p. 10, 13): the "Too Much" of the first half of the poem is set against the true "Abundance" rep? resented by the tiny rat, commemorated in the second half of the poem. Moore's artistic study of this humble rat of unparalleled skill at jumping and balancing, whose "leaps should be set / to the flageolet" (CP, p. 15), again reminds us of the Roosevelt expedition, in which innumerable specimens of small mammals were slain for scientific study.51 Also, Moore's poetic identification with this creature is explicit at the close of "The Jerboa," just as it was in her letters of the period, when she took the identity of "rat" in family correspondence and studied the jerboa (among many other creatures) at The Natural History Museum (see SLMM, pp. 265, 269-271, 285). She evokes her own three-cornered hat, the publicly recognizable symbol of her self-fashioning, in her closing image of the jerboa's pillar body erect on a three-cornered smooth-working Chippendale claw ? propped on hind legs, and tail as third toe, between leaps to its burrow. (CP, p. 15) Thus Moore's imaginary possession ofthe tiny jerboa is strikingly self-referential in its reinforce- ment of her modernist poetics, opening with lines of five syllables and closing with lines of seven, "so that each one works 'By fifths and sevenths,' and indeed the whole poem moves 'in leaps of two lengths,'" mimicking the very leaps ofthe animal under scrutiny.52 Also, Moore implicitly comments on her preferred modes of transforming the living menagerie into art, as "she moves out into the uninhabited desert... to discover a visionary alternative to the 'hired' art of cities and kings."53 Throughout the thirties, Moore actively sought information about the creatures she placed under microscopic study; she visited the Natural History Museum, sought the advice of specialists, and attended lectures accompanied by nature films (SLMM, pp. 264, 266, 269).54 Such persistent "conscious fastidiousness" over her menagerie suggests that her views on animal consumption had solidified. Indeed, by 1940, when she published "Rigorists," some poems become open platforms 50. According to Leavell, Moore's extended description of the goat "comically reverses the hierarchy of Greek mythol? ogy, where the goat symbolizes man's basest instincts, and of Christian mythology, where Satan is given goatlike features" (p. 182). 51. The jerboa, a small, leaping rodent ofthe family Dipodidae, having long hind legs and a long, tufted tail, is a native of Asia and Northern Africa. The jerboa does not appear in Roosevelt's African Game Trails, "Appendix B," which "is a partial list of the small mammals obtained on the trip," many of whose "identifications are not final" (vol. II, p. 577). However, there are some 50 varieties of rats, mice, dormice, gerbils, and squirrels in Roosevelt's list (vol. II, pp. 577-579). 52. Slatin, p. 206. 53. Slatin, p. 205. 54. She was familiar with the films of Osa and Martin Johnson, well known for photographing animals in their native habi- tats, rather than in zoos, and with Frank Buck's Bring 'Em Back Alive, published in 1930 as a book and released as a movie in 1932. In October of 1932, Moore expressed dismay to Bryher over the ways in which movies about game expeditions portray captured animals. Nevertheless, Moore appears to have been fascinated, having viewed the film three times: "... I saw Bring 'Em Back Alive three times. Frank Buck was there 'in person' and though nearly everything he said was, from an oratorical point of view, unfortunate, I had confidence in him.... didn't you think, in the film, that he dealt with the animals rather kindly and respectfully? At least I did not see him sitting on dead animals as Osa and Martin Johnson sometimes do. It is unnerving to see an agitated, passive creature like the monitor lizard tied down so it can't move ..." (SLMM, p. 278).</page><page sequence="19">Rieke: Moore's Modernist Self-Fashioning 167 for qualifying how, when, and in what manner humans should intervene in the world of her favored creatures. The way in which she as an artist should present the creature world for inspection to the public world is paramount. "Rigorists," for instance, subtly praises reindeer, with their "candela- brum-headed ornament" (CP, p. 96), and Sheldon Jackson, "evangel to that race" of Eskimos, for preventing starvation among them by importing reindeer to Alaska from Siberia. Does Moore intend an ironic contrast in the fact that humans must devise artificial means of feeding themselves, while reindeer exhibit skill in "finding their own food; they are adapted // to scant reino I or pasture" (CP, p. 96)? Her notes point out the fact that Jackson's solution to the problem was the result of "whales having been almost exterminated" (CP, p. 276). However, as Molesworth's reasoned discussion of the poem indicates, Jackson is the hero of the piece; there appears to be no criticism of his humane intervention on the part ofthe Eskimos.55 "The Arctic Ox" Moore's essay "Dress and Kindred Subjects" (1965) opens as a relatively straightforward dis? cussion of taste and style, but, as it progresses, it turns into a highly subjective account of Moore's tastes and habits as a consumer.56 In it she offers a number of deceptively tame pointers on style and fashion as they relate to "behavior": '"Solid values in dress' imply dignity and materials in keeping with it" (Prose, p. 596). These observations give way to Moore's idiosyncratic self-fashioning, as she enumerates particular preferences in "dress" that resemble items in her own wardrobe: "The military cape is the most graceful wrap we have ? with Chinese straight-up collar" (Prose, p. 596).57 Moore leads us to understand that "kindred subjects" to "dress" are one's "favorite possessions" (Prose, p. 598), and she lists hers: artistically rendered figurines, each bearing some relationship to the animal kingdom, sewn, carved or east in metals or porcelain with a decided international flair. She includes "a silver seated rat mouse-size ... a Japanese teak mouse, Austrian turquoise velvet one, and a bird embroidery framed in black and lemon lacquer. ... A fly of amber with gold legs and a real fly in the amber. . . a Dresden leopard with green eyes standing on oval green grass ..." (Prose, p. 598).58 This crafted menagerie, of course, shows up routinely in her poetry, and thus her title subtly acknowledges that her animal possessions, essential to the way she dresses herself for the public, have everything to do with her poetic self-fashioning. Some objects appearing in the list are made of animal by-products. "Aporcupine-quill birchbark round basket with quills woven into a square on the lid" is one such object; expertly weaving quills into a basket is, for her, a desirable form of consumption and use. Moore includes "a baby adder- skin sewn by Alyse Gregory on a strip of lemon and silver Chinese brocade" (Prose, pp. 598-599). (Moore kept a snakeskin bookmark in her copy of Milton's Paradise Lost; this item can be viewed at 55. Jackson was a relative of Moore's friends the Norcrosses, showing "quiet persistence in winning out against bureaucracy and public indifference" when he came up with a plan to transport the reindeer; her Christian morality is clearly expressed in her designation of him as the Eskimo's "evangel" (Molesworth, pp. 306-307). Nevertheless, it is also "these animals [who] are 'rigorists,' in part because they adapt so well to an adverse environment" (Molesworth, p. 305). 56. For another intriguing discussion of fashion, including amusing observations on the cost of mink, see Moore's "In Fashion, Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow" (Prose, p. 617). 57. "The cape Moore often wore with her tricorn hat was given to her by Hildegarde's mother, Mrs. Lasell..." (SLMM, p. 488). 58. Moore (Prose, pp. 687-688) provided another of these lists for an interview titled "Ten Answers: Letters from an October Afternoon, Part II," that appeared in Harper's in November 1964.</page><page sequence="20">168 Journal of Modern Literature the Rosenbach Museum and Library.)59 Near the end ofthe list, she acknowledges "an Egyptian pale rhinoceros-skin whip; an ivory walrus tusk from the Greeley Expedition," and, with a note of pride, she says, "I received recently a veritable 'King of the Castle.' An Arctic ox of walrus ivory, carved by an Esquimau, Kay Hendrickson, for Mr. John Teal, Jr. to give me" (Prose, p. 599). In Moore's hierarchy of values, the fact that the piece is an Eskimo carving would justify the manner in which the ivory was obtained.60 She elevates it to a cherished artifact, and we might also note that it was carved specifically "for Mr. John Teal, Jr. to give me." In fact, Moore's public was responsible for the bulk of her material menagerie. In another similar list of these objects, Moore specifies that "I did not give myself any of these animals except Elston Howard [Moore's "pet" alligator]. I have many more. But I've not yet been up to see Mr. Teal's oxen. It's intolerable" (Prose, pp. 687-688). The carved arctic ox commemorates one of her poetic menagerie, for she had written and pub? lished "The Arctic Ox (or Goat)" by August 1958 (SLMM, p. 541).61 This poem, which apparently prompted the gift of the carving, again causes us to ponder Moore's apparent ambivalence about animal consumption. The epigraph ofthe poem acknowledges an article from the March 1958 issue ofthe Atlantic Monthly: "Derived from 'Golden Fleece ofthe Arctic,' by John J. Teal, Jr., who rears musk oxen on his farm in Vermont" (CP, p. 193). The poem advocates consuming the fur of this creature for one reason: the animal need not be killed for it to be turned into useful, fashionable apparel. She contrasts it to the arctic fox: To wear the arctic fox you have to kill it. Wear qiviut ? the underwool of the arctic ox ? pulled off it like a sweater; your coat is warm; your conscience, better. I would like a suit of qiviut, so light I did not know I had it on; and in the course of time, another since I had not had to murder the "goat" that grew the fleece that made the first. (CP, p. 193) 59. I wish to thank Michael Barsanti, Director of Special Projects, and the helpful staff at the Rosenbach for generous assis- tance in viewing Moore's collectibles and letters in her Archive. According to Barsanti, for archival reasons the bookmark has been removed from Moore's rare first edition, first printing, of Paradise Lost, and is kept in the clippings file that corresponds to the book with other materials she laid in it. He suspects that the bookmark is the same one she mentions in the essay, but cannot absolutely confirm that (email to the author, 3 June 2003). 60. Even though the gift given to Moore predates legal stipulations upon killing marine creatures, under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 and the convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of 1973, such debates about endan- gered species were well publicized in the 1960s. The Endangered Species Act was passed in 1969. See the "Chronology," in Encyclopedia of Animal Rights and Animal Welfare, ed. Marc Bekoff, with Carron A. Meaney (Greenwood Press, 1998), p. xix). According to "About Alaskan Native Eskimo Carvers," Native America Online (2000), www.nativeamericaninc. com/Artists/eskimocarvers,html, "[I]t is legal for only Alaskan Natives to hunt marine mammals, the whale, polar bear, walrus, and seals. The tiniest part of these marine mammals must be 'Worked' by an Alaskan Native before it becomes legal for others to own" (p. 1). 61. The poem appeared in the 1959 collection OToBe A Dragon.</page><page sequence="21">Rieke: Moore's Modernist Self-Fashioning 169 The poem goes on to argue, in purely economic terms, that the arctic ox out-produces the "cashmere ram": "Chinchillas, otters, water-rats, / and beavers, keep us warm / but think! a "musk ox" grows six pounds / of qiviut, the cashmere ram, / three ounces ? that is all ? of pashm" (CP, p. 193-194), With its overt, practical stance on animal products, "The Arctic Ox (or Goat)" suggests that Moore might restrict her own consumption to goods that did not require killing to be harvested. By the late 1950s, she seemed ready to assert openly that she could advantageously use her craft to promote ethical consumption. She has a playfully firm, didactic point to advertise: "If you fear that you are / reading an advertisement, you are" (CP, p. 195). Moore's strong instinct for civic responsibility and morality becomes overt in many late poems, to the dismay of critics. This apparently unambiguous assertion on the issue teases us into thinking that, over the scores of years she has engaged this subject matter, her views about animal consump? tion have evolved into a fixed position. Considering the importance of that menagerie in her poetic self-fashioning, one might certainly have expected such a position to emerge. Clearly, Elizabeth Bishop, in "Efforts of Affection," hinted that this ethical progress might be evident in a poet who built such a large portion of her career around her beloved menagerie. Nevertheless, the form that Moore's advocacy takes in "The Arctic Ox" finally undercuts serious polemic and argument. The piece reads as light verse, with its humorous tone and playful rhymed, end-stopped couplets. As Margaret Holley has aptly described it, "The Arctic Ox" conveys an "unchallenged aphorism," with a "neat fit between the creature and the moral"; this neat playfulness as verse fable "distinguishes it from the animiles ofthe thirties," "lightly witty and even jaunty."62 It only skirts the surface of the subject matter so deeply engaged in "New York": with its interlocking issues of American consumerism and its relation to European culture and human plunder, of the American "savage" past as a "romance" with wealth, of the poet's fascination with the tempting beauty of material plunder, and, finally, of the poet's ambiguous assertion that '"accessibility to experience'" is a just outcome of consumer culture. Moore probes this charged subject matter right down to the end of her career, but "The Arctic Ox" finally slides away from the very issue it announces. Did Moore remain fundamentally locked within a female fashion system that had captivated her in her formative years at Bryn Mawr? Did her attraction to material goods override her spiritual goal of resisting consumption and plunder, slaugh- ter and horror? In another late essay, "In Fashion, Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow," published in The New York Times in November 1967, Moore wittily ? but not necessarily ironically ? observes gluttonous consumption, here in a fashion display featuring the "Mink Maids": Not only potential buyers applauded S. Klein's Mink Maids when exhibited there. A 19-year-old electric utility clerk said, "It sure breaks the monotony of lunch-hour," as the mink maids paraded mink stoles, jackets, and a mink trench-coat. An elderly Manhat- tan widow kept murmuring afterward, "Beautiful, beautiful. I wonder if they have any seconds that they're giving away." The most expensive coat in the show ($3,987) was a floor length white mink with a detachable flounce. This coat I view with partisan interest, since I am an incurable sufferer of thrift. (Prose, p. 617) 62. Holley,p. 161.</page><page sequence="22">170 Journal of Modern Literature Looking back to her reference to the gluttonous Duchess of Gonzaga in "New York," we note that Moore's restraining thrift (not to mention modesty) would always keep in check any urge to own and flaunt such a coat, but it does not prohibit her from looking upon the spectacle with fas? cination. She openly condemned the gluttonous plunder of ostriches, a symbol of justice in "He 'Digesteth Harde Yron'": "Six hundred ostrich-brains served / at one banquet... jewel- / gorgeous ugly egg-shell / goblets, eight pairs of ostriches / in harness, dramatize a meaning / always missed by the externalist" (CP 100). In 1956, "Blessed Is the Man," from Like A Bulwark, openly challenges material consumption in religious and spiritual terms: "Blessed the man whose faith is different / from possessiveness ? of a kind not framed by 'things which do appear'" (CP, p. 174). In "Dress and Kindred Subjects," Moore adopts a position of tolerance to cultural difference, and this appears to help her resolve thorny issues about consumer culture, particularly killing animals for human use. She affirms that "tolerance had best enter one's attitudes to others' habits" (Prose, p. 599): Some persons of hyper-protective mentality are unwilling to live by taking the lives of other animals, and will not wear shoes, gloves, or belts of leather or sanction the use of leather upholstery. Irrespective of cruelty, some shrink from the sight of raw meat. One of my ancestors would not permit the ladies of the household to lay or hang flypaper in rooms that attracted flies. They concealed the strips till he had left for the office, and before his return. (Prose, p. 599) Moore was not of such "hyper-protective mentality," and her own eating habits were "not vora- cious," and definitely not vegetarian ? she ate in moderation "anything that purports to 'make powerful animals'" (Prose, pp. 599-600). Finally, though, Moore's involvement with animal natures throughout her career cannot be fixed or boiled down to principles or maxims ? or even advertisements ? such as those promulgated in "The Arctic Ox," or observations on vegetarianism. Her fascination with animal identities and her consumption of animal products, both imaginary and material, are intimately bound up with her poetic self-fashioning and evident everywhere in her work. Clearly, she understood and acknowl- edged that consumer culture makes a fetish of the very menagerie over which she held a cautious poetic dominion. Yet the profound ambivalence she felt when probing these issues allowed her to create some of her most forceful modernist assemblages as deeply engaging and often discordant collisions of culture and nature. This exotic and alienated imaginary possession also allowed her to carve out an original, public identity among other modernists, while her subjective identifica? tion with animal natures forced her repeatedly to examine the ethics of commodity culture. Out of this investment in animal natures, she created herself as a "Rusty Mongoose" (SLMM, p. 273), a "Basilisk" (SLMM, p. 275), a "Rat" (SLMM, p. 285), a "pterodactyl" (SLMM, p.142), and as the inventive modernist poet we admire, Marianne Moore.</page></plain_text>
