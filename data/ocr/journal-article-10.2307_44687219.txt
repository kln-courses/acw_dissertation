ABSTRACT A number of automated fastener installation machines have demonstrated the advantage of cassette feeder systems as well as the benefits that accrue from the machine manipulation of fasteners. Although a substantial number of these automated systems are now in operation and are providing substantial cost and quality benefits to their users, a far greater number of fasteners are still and will continue to be, installed manually for some time to come. Recognizing the great number of manual operations that exist in the industry, we have concentrated our efforts on the development of systems that work in connection with the manual operator by providing him with the benefits of automatic fastener storage, selection, sealant application and semi automatic installation. The manual operator support systems range from stationary, multi-station systems all the way down to shoulder supported "packs" which provide similar functions for individual fastener installation. The configuration and capabilities of the systems will be described. INTRODUCTION Although "C-Frame" riveters were introduced almost half a century ago, the first serious use of "hands off" aircraft assembly systems did not occur until the early 1980's. Despite their advantages, machines that eliminate the need for manual manipulation of parts and fasteners have not yet gained general acceptance in the industry. Existing automated assembly machines can be divided into two broad categories: 1 . "Heavies"- The systems that can be categorized as "Heavies" manipulate the part under construction on a computer controlled table or alternately move an operating head around the part, in order to reach each of the points on the structure that need to be fastened. This group of machines includes the CNC table augmented "C" frame riveters, "C" frames that move along a set of tracks and "Ring" riveters which surround a structure as well as other large special purpose automated assembly machines. The "Heavies" are custom built machines that typically cost in excess of $ 10 million dollars a copy and which occupy substantial space in the factory. Although the "Heavies" have succeeded in filling very particular niche requirements, their cost and their inherent inflexibility in terms of range of application and ability to respond to changes in production rates, render them unlikely candidates for the replacement of the majority of manual fastening operations as we practice them today. 2. The "Lights"- The "Light" assembly machines are typically built around general-purpose anthropomorphic robots identical to those currently employed in very large numbers by the automotive industry. See figure 1 for an example of this technology. f IJ'-Jr«] 187</page><page sequence="2">The "Light" systems typically cost an order of magnitude less per copy than the "Heavies" and require a fraction of the space on the factory floor. Unlike the automotive robots, the aircraft assembly robotic systems have tended to be mobile. The robotic platform is placed in proximity to the structures being assembled, locates the areas of the structures that are intended to be fastened and proceeds to effect the necessary fastening operations. If production rates rise above the levels originally forecast, more robots can be brought to the bear on the problem and production rates can be multiplied with ease. Despite the potential benefits of both the "Heavies" and the "Lights", the aerospace industry (with a notable exception), has yet to make a mass conversion from the manual operator to the totally automated production of aircraft. See figure 2 for an example of successful application. 1ffeure2ļ Three factors have worked against the use of these automated assembly machines: 1) The substantial funds that need to be dedicated to the purchase of the equipment 2) The technological risk and the organizational changes that are part of making the move from operator to machine assembly of aircraft 3) The fear of not being able to accommodate unforeseen spikes in production rates Although sound arguments exist to counter these points, and dramatic economic success has been achieved by an aircraft assembler who has made an almost complete changeover to the "lights", the industry remains on the fence regarding the value of automatic factory systems that reach beyond the capabilities of "C" frame riveters. MAIN SECTION What is "FITS"? "FITS" (Fastener Installation and Traceability System) was developed in direct response to the industry's hesitancy to accept fully automated fastening as the prime means of assembling aircraft. "FITS" Is not a substitute for full automation, but a means of easing into automation without the usual costs and the technical risk. "FITS" represents the merger of a newly developed set of installation tools with the automated fastener delivery systems that have made a substantial contribution to the success of the fully automated systems. "FITS" brings many of the features of automated systems to the manual operator at a fraction of the cost of the larger more complicated systems. The "FITS" consists of a series of installation tools designed to accommodate the various families of fasteners utilized by the industry namely: Blind rivets Solid rivets Screws and bolts Hiloks©, Hilltes© etc. Four distinct configurations of "FITS" exist at the present time: • MOS (Multi Operator Support) "FITS" • SOM (Single Operator Support) "FITS" • SP (Shoulder Pack) "FITS" • SC (Self Contained) "FITS" 188</page><page sequence="3">Description of each of the above systems: 1 . (MOS) Multi Operator Support System This "FITS" accommodates from one to four manual installers and supports their fastener requests in parallel. Each of the installers is free to utilize the installation tool appropriate to their needs. One could be installing screws or bolts, while the others might be installing blind rivets or solid rivets. On the other hand, if the assembly requirements required the same type of fastener for each of the four stations, the cassette system would support all of the operator's requests for the same type of fastener. (See figure 3) Figure 'i "FTfi" Multi OpErahr Suppol (MOS) (SOM) Single Operator Mobile "FITS" This pull along behind system can supply a full range of fasteners to a single installer. The installer is free to choose the particular fastener he requires at any particular time. One to six cassettes, each accommodating a different function, can be accessed by the operator without changing cassettes. If a more diverse population of fasteners is required, the operator Haúre 4 BBWS" Sinale ÉfeerafòiIBBte (SOM) can swap cassettes at will. The pull behind cassette cart can be brought to different workstations throughout the factory as production requirements may dictate. (See figure 4) 2. (SP) Shoulder Pack This configuration of the "FITS" allows the operator to access areas of the aircraft where it might be impractical to use the larger mobile cart. The size range of fasteners is more limited, however the portability of the shoulder pack is advantageous where space is limited. (See figure 5) 3. (SC) Self Contained "FITS" The self contained "FITS" consists of an installation tool with a built in fastener cartridge. This configuration provides a solution where portability is the most important criteria, however the number and size of the fasteners needs to be limited in order to accommodate the limited volume of the cartridge. The "FITS" family provides a means of achieving many of the benefits of automation without the large investment and the technical risk. "FITS", augments, rather than replaces the manual operator. "FITS" provides the benefits of automated fastener storage and selection and in addition solves one of the messiest problems that plagues manual installers, namely sealant application. Whenever possible, "FITS" maintains compatibility with the elements of the automated systems that have found ready acceptance in the industry. For instance, the "FITS" is fully compatible with AHG's cassette fastener storage systems, which have become the de facto standard in the industry. Many "C"-frames, "Heavies" and 189</page><page sequence="4">"Light" systems have chosen AHG's cassettes to feed their system, therefore "FITS" is provided with the same capabilities. Brotje's IPAC, Dassault's robotic cells and some Gemcor "C" frames utilize AHG's cassette systems to supply rivets to their operating heads. The same advantages that lead to their choice for automated riveters exist for the manual operator utilizing the "FITS". "FITS," offers the following advantages: 1. Economically superior: the full line of "FITS" installation tools have been designed with a major ergonomie improvement over existing rivet guns. In each case the installation tool divides the weight between both of the operator's hands rather than just one. The support handle is located close to the center of gravity of the installation tool in order to convert the impact forces from a lineal force in line with the operator's arm to a substantially reduced almost exclusively rotative motion about the wrist of the hand holding the support handle. The operator's other hand is now able to function as the "aiming" hand, which allows the operator to position the gun with greater ease and sharply reduces the impact forces reaching that hand. This aspect is particularly important in terms of its relevance to the health and safety of the operator. 2. Reduced installation cost: "FITS" substantially reduces installation cost compared to manual operations. The "FITS" completely eliminates the time spent by an operator to locate, manipulate and insert the fasteners. The "FITS" cycles through the steps required to perform the fastening operation without any delay between those steps, resulting in a significant reduction in time required installing a fastener relative to a manual operator. The difference is dependant on the fasteners and the difference is greatest when operations such as manual sealant application or other time consuming manual operations are required. 3. Low investment: there is no alternative on the market that comes close in terms of cost and yet provides the degree of automation provided by even the most basic "FITS". 4. Rapid return on investment: the "FITS" can be integrated into the production process with ease. No long term experimentation or development is required to integrate the "FITS" into the production line. As a result of its low cost, the "FITS" provides an essentially immediate payback. 5. Quality: Substantial improvement in fastening quality is made practical. The ability to support autonomation through the auto adjustment of key installation parameters gives the system the ability to enhance hole fill and to stabilize head protrusion. Consistency of rivet installation parameters is a pivotal consideration in establishing the predicted fatigue life of a panel. The "FIT's" ability to communicate and to adjust key parameters to meet the known characteristics of the rivets makes superior fatigue life a thoroughly practical and realizable goal. Autonomation, or the process of auto adjustment of countersink depth is now possible in a manual rivet installation process. The adjustment of countersink depth can be automated by the "FITS" installation tool in response to information provided by the cassette fastener delivery system. The variance in the head height from one lot of solid rivets to another is recorded and can be sent to the "FITS" tool where a differential depth can be programmed for the installed height of the fastener. Each cassette is headed with fasteners that are held to extremely tight tolerances (tolerances that are substantially tighter than those that exist in the fastener's specification). By transferring the relevant information to the "FITS", the auto adjustment can be performed and the superior quality of the installed fasteners can be assured. 6. Productivity: The ability to feed fasteners rapidly and reliably to the point of installation sharply increases productivity over the existing process of picking a fastener by hand out of a bin and then inserting same in the next hole to be filled. In most cases manual manipulation of fasteners takes longer than the riveting process itself. The hand manipulation of the fastener also leads to errors and mixed fasteners. 7. Traceability: Since lot control is traceable from the initial loading of the cassettes it cannot be compromised by the operator. The possibility of errors and mixing of lots is eliminated. Furthermore, traceability is provided to the point on the aircraft where the lot was installed. Bar codes are utilized to match the fasteners to the area on the 190</page><page sequence="5">aircraft where they were installed. The cassette lot identification can be transmitted electronically for permanent retention on the automated cell's production log, therefore making the data available for future reference. 8. Eliminates rework: "FITS" permits the practical attainment of zero rework. Loaded with high quality rivets the "FITS" allows an operator to produce panels without the need for rework. The fastening requirements addressed by the "FITS" include: • Fastener delivery • Drilling • Sealant application • Fastener insertion • Rivet Bucking • Blind riveting Conclusion As previously discussed there have been over 50 years of development and operational experience devoted to the subject of automated aircraft assembly. Yet a number of problems appear to have resisted most of the solutions that have been developed to date. "FITS" makes a contribution to solving these problems with a flexible multifunction installation tool. All of the advantages of precise dimensional control formerly considered to be available only on an automated riveter are now available to the manual operator. See figure 6 showing the multifunction installation tool integrated with the cassette fastener delivery system. ■¡Hp "SOM" with Multifunction i BBIlflfiitiiliiiii Tool for HiLoks©" The benefits of end-to-end fastener processing are substantial. An operational "FITS" can eliminate hand operations throughout the factory. Whenever human beings engage in the day-to- day handling of fasteners, whether it is the point of installation, or in the stock room, the opportunity for mistakes arises. The elimination of handling in receiving departments, stock rooms and on the manufacturing floor introduces the opportunity to extend the JIT concept further into the work stream. "FITS" brings the JIT concept to the finished product. From the factory, where certified source inspection guarantees integrity of the fasteners via the cassette, to the shop floor where the cassette is linked directly to the product to be built, the absolute minimum of hands touch the fastener in the manufacturer's facility. Mixing of rivets, which occurs primarily by inadvertent human handling, is sharply reduced. The loading of cassettes, which are designed to accept only the prescribed diameter fasteners, greatly reduces potential of errors. Loading machines are available that can provide further protection against mixed fasteners with vision and other quality assurance systems that eliminate the possibility of a defective or mismatched fastener entering the cassette. The knowledge that the manufacturer has accrued relative to the specific dimensional characteristics of the fasteners as they are manufactured is made available to the installer. This knowledge is transferred by the "FITS" and the Information regarding the individual fastener that is installed on an assembly for a particular tail number aircraft becomes traceable to its final installed location. "FITS" not only cuts costs, but has the power to adjust to changes in production levels with ease. If production rates rise above levels originally planned, it only requires the addition of inexpensive "FITS" installation tools. An economical and efficient "FITS" finally provides the manual operator with the capabilities he has been long denied.
