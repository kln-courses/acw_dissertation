King Wayne State University THE PEDESTRIAN SEEMS TO SUFFER THE MOST FROM THE consequences of present day traffic accidents. Pedestrian injury and mortality consti- tute a disproportionately high percentage of the highway traffic toll. National Safety Council (1) statistics show that the percentage of traffic fatali- ties accounted for by the pedestrian has remained relatively constant, ranging from 17. 5% to 19% over the last decade. Considerable data regarding pedestrian injury and fatality are now available. Ryan and McLean (2) investigated 79 pedestrian accidents over a cumulative period of 17 months in Adelaide, Australia. There were a total of 11 fatalities. In a more recent survey, McLean (3) reported that pedestrians accounted for one-third of all fatalities from motor vehicle accidents in the state of New York in 1970. The differences in injury patterns due to front-end geometry variation were reported by Fisher and Hall (4) , with Hall et al (5) stating that the generalized front profile and pedes- trian trauma should be treated with caution. Wakeland (6) of the United Kingdom has speculated on the source of head injury as being the result of ground impact rather than that of the vehicle. Vaughan (7,8) made a study of the location of im- pacts which resulted in fatalities and recommended vehicle modification countermeasures. McCarroll, et al. (9) stated that the relationships between spe- cific design features and specific injuries are often obscured by the complexity of the accident event. Among the many suggestions made for vehicle modifications at the conclusion of a study done by Stcherbatcheff, et al. (10) was that of kinematic data of the pedestrian being obtained during an experimental simulation to be used as input para- meters for possible computer models that would eliminate the astronomical costs of using T Trial and errorTT methods of searching for optimum characteristics of a vehicle friendly to the pedes- trian. It is the intent of this study to acquire data that will describe pedestrian kinematics, injury patterns and the effects of different vehicle front- end geometries. Although the reduction of fatali- ties and mitigation of injuries can never really be measured in economic terms, cost effectiveness is always a major consideration in any venture. Therefore, the number of experimental simulations is necessarily restricted and computer simulations can be a useful and economic alternative. For a mathematical model to be an effective tool in study- ing pedestrian injury, it must be validated against actual experimental data of pedestrian kinematics such as acceleration, velocity and displacement of various body segments, and the force generated by impacts of the pedestrian with the vehicle. The experimental plan called for four dummy tests and four runs with unembalmed cadavers. (There will thus be sufficient data from each surro- gate type, and comparisons can also be made ABSTRACT A series of 10 full-scale experimental simula- tions of pedestrian-vehicle impact was carried out using cadavers and a 95th percentile anthropomor- phic dummy. The test subjects were impacted laterally and frontally at 24, 32 and 40 km/h (15, 20 and 24 mph). Each subject was extensively in- strumented with miniature accelerometers, up to a maximum of 53 transducers. The nine-accelerom- eter scheme was used to measure angular accelera- tion of body segments from which it was possible to compute the head injury criterion (HIC) for cadaver head impact. A full-size Chevrolet was used as the impacting vehicle. The impact event was three-dimensional in nature during which the body segments executed com- plex motions. Dummy impacts were more repeat- able than cadaver impacts but the response of these test subjects were quite different. The HIC was higher for head-hood impact than for he ad- ground impact in two of the cases analyzed. The acquired data could be used to validate existing three-dimen- sional gross motion simulators. 2566</page><page sequence="2">between the cadaver and dummy responses.) One embalmed cadaver was used to test the experimental procedures designed for the unembalmed cadaver impacts, and to improve experimental techniques. The test vehicle represented a typical American automobile in use at the beginning of this project in 1973. It was a full-size 1973 Chevrolet with the 16-km/h protruding front bumper. LABORATORY PREPARATION The vehicle-pedestrian impact tests were carried out at a sled facility of the Biomechanics Research Center of Wayne State University. The WHAM in (Wayrie Horizontal Accelerator Mech- anism) test track is shown in Figure 1. It was capable of propelling a car rolling on its own wheels and the track was long enough to accommo- date a vehicle impacting a T 'pedes trian1 1 at a maxi- mum speed of 40 km/h (25 mph) . Its own brakes were applied at impact to stop the vehicle. The test site is a 30 m long, 3 m wide area with a concrete barrier at the end of the track. The vehicle acquired for these experiments was a full-size Chevrolet Caprice. The rear of the vehicle had been damaged in an accident. Its chas- sis was strengthened for repeated runs on the test tracks. The vehicle was propelled by an air-driven piston traveling in a 22 cm diameter cylinder. It was released approximately 1 m before the point of impact. The test subject was held in a harness which was connected to a solenoid controlled quick release mechanism located directly above the impact site. The harness consisted of a system of 5-cm wide belts designed for ease of installation and mainten- ance of a good pedestrian posture. The solenoid was activated by a relay which was triggered by a switch placed in the path of the vehicle. The sub- ject was thus released and stood on one leg for a few milliseconds prior to impact. INSTRUMENTATION (a) A total of seven high-speed cameras were used to cover the entire impact site. This con- figuration was designated to give redundant coverage against failure of a camera, or obstruction of lab or segment targets. Figure 2 shows camera place- ment at the test site. Cameras 1, 2, and 3 provided lateral coverage while camera 4 viewed the impact from the barrier, in line with the path of the ve- hicle. Camera 5 was a top view and camera 6 was an on-board camera mounted on the roof of the vehicle in line with the test subject. Camera 7 was positioned to obtain a close-up view of the impact of the bumper with the knee. Film speeds were approximately 500 fps on cameras 1-6 and 1000 fps on camera 7. Electronic strobe flashes were placed in view of each camera to provide time synchronization between transducer data and each camera. A timing light in each camera placed a mark on the edge of the film at 10 ms intervals. Film analysis requires the use of targets at strategic locations within the field of view of the camera. Fixed or "inertial11 lab targets were placed in convenient locations within view of each camera. They provided a fixed reference for the Fig. 1 - WHAM III Test tracks being readied for a frontal cadaver impact 2567</page><page sequence="3">2568 K. W. KRIEGER, ET AL.

Targets were placed on the ve- hicle to determine its instantaneous position. To determine the position of each segment of the test subject with respect to the inertial target, the sub- jects were equipped with three different sets of targets. Identification of the axis of rotation of a segment was made by a 2. 5 cm diameter circular target. A 5 cm square target was placed midway between the targets identifying the approximate location of the segment center of gravity. The segments were also identified by numerical targets in the event of confusion during this complex mo- tion. These targets were placed on all four sides of each segment to ensure that they can be identi- fied by every camera. (b) Accelerometers. The accelerometers used were Endevco Model #2264-2000 piezoresistive devices with the following specifications: 1. Maximum acceleration of 2000 g 2. Response flat out to 5 KHz 3. Maximum cross-axis sensitivity of 5% 4. Output sensitivity of 0. 214 mV/g They had two active arms and cable resistance was considered in the bridge configuration since the 49 m trailing cable formed part of the bridge which was completed at a bridge completion box at the main instrumentation console where the amplifiers were located. A specially built cable harness was used to support the accelerometer connectors in the back of the test subject. The junction could be discon- nected easily for pre-run system checkout, but was securely fastened together prior to the actual run to prevent loss of data. The cables were strain- relieved on both sides of the connector by clamping them to a plate mounted on the cable harness. The trailing cables consisted of two segments. From the test subject, five 37-conductor cables with a single outer shield on each cable transmitted the signal to junction box located above the impact site on a structural frame supporting the flood lights. These cables were 18.3 m long and are identified as pedestrian cables. They were selected for their flexibility and light weight. The connectors on the frame were designed to quickly disconnect if the cables were stretched taut. A set of four 54- conductor cables with shielded pairs constituted the second segment of the trailing cable system from the light frame to the bridge completion boxes at the main instrumentation console and are designated data cables. They were 30 m in length and were heavier and less flexible than the pedestrian cables. However, they remained stationary during an im- pact run. Calibration of the accelerometers consisted of a series of drop tests from which their output was compared with that of standard accelerometers mounted on the same platform. The output voltages due to five different resistors placed across each active arm in turn were found to be proportional to their resistances. The values used were 30. 1 Ki2, 60.4 Kfl, 121 Kfl, 301 Kfl, and 604 Kflwith a 1% tolerance. It should also be noted that the accel- erometers were calibrated while connected to the cables and instrumentation that were used during</page><page sequence="4">SIMULATION OF PEDESTRI AN-VEHIC LE IMPACTS 2569 the actual test. This eliminated the problem of cable resistance due to the length of the trailing cables. Prior to each run, it was necessary to record on tape a calibration signal for each channel. To do this automatically and in two modes, a calibration sequencer was fabricated to perform a step calibration with an appropriate shunt resistor. A relay was built into each signal conditioner to permit this shunt calibration across each active arm of the accelerometer in turn. The calibration sequencer was designed to activate the relays either simultaneously or in sequence for a period of 100 to 150 m s across each leg. The simultaneous calibration signal was required for digitization of the data by an A/D converter while the sequential calibration was useful when the data were played back onto an oscillograph recorder which could accommodate 10 to 12 channels at the same time. Simultaneous calibration signals for as many chan- nels would not be distinguishable on an oscillograph record. The sequencer could calibrate up to 63 channels sequentially. The locations of the accelerometers are given in Table 1 for the first 4 dummy runs. Six accel- erometers were used in an attempt to measure both linear and angular acceleration. After Padgaonkar et al. (11) discovered that nine accelerometers were required to compute angular acceleration reliably, the placement of these transducers was modified. Their locations are given in Table 2. Figure 3 shows a 9-accelerometer head mount. (c) Ground Contact Loads. The measurement of the ground contact force in three directions was required to measure the load borne by the impacted leg prior to impact and the frictional loads during impact. A triaxial load cell designed to carry 1340 N axially and 670 N on each of the 2 horizontal direc- tions was used. It was manufactured by D. J. Instruments of Carlisle, MA. The experimental protocol called for the crash victim to be impacted while it was on one leg which should carry 80-90% of the body weight. DATA RECORDING AND PROCESSING The impact data were permanently stored on magnetic tape. Since only one instrumentation tape recorder was available, an analog (FM) multiplexing system was used to store 10 data channels onto one track of the tape recorder. The analog data were digitized at a nominal rate of 2000 samples/s. They were filtered at 1000 Hz. The A/D converter was a model AD8-EA made by Digital Equipment Corporation. (DEC). It was used in conjunction with a PDP/8E computer which provided the control and memory for temporary storage of the digitized data, which were stored on magnetic tape using a DEC industry- compatible tape recorder. TEST SUBJECT PREPARATION (a) Pre-run Procedures. The acceptance of any unembalmed cadaveric material was determined by the cause of death and age. Deaths resulting from infectious or communicable diseases consti- tuted sufficient cause to reject the specimen. Debilitating diseases, such as metastatic carcinoma, also disqualified the specimen in that there was a high probability of skeletal deterioration. Cadavers under the age of 60 were preferred, since osteo- porosis can generally be found in older specimens. Table 3 lists the pertinent data on the cadavers used. Another consideration in the selection of the cadaver was the elapsed time since death, as well as the amount of time it had been exposed to temperatures above 4°C. The aim was to make all necessary measurements before deterioration set in and the risk of infection became high. (b) Preliminary Preparation and Measure- ments.

These x- rays also served as a comparison with post- run x-rays to establish impact related fractures. Accelerometer mount locations were chosen so that the mount coordinate system would line up approximately with the skeletal structure of each body segment. The exact location of the mount with respect to a set of anatomically-based coor- dinate axes, was determined from x-rays after the experiment. Padgaonkar (12) has described a method of defining this set of coordinate axes to identify the mount location relative to bony land- marks so that the data could be used by other investigators. Only the necessary amount of cutaneous and muscle tissue was removed to install the mount on the surface of the bone. The size of the holes drilled in the bone varied from 3. 6 mm to 4. 0 mm and was dependent upon the thickness of the cortical bone at that site. Number 10 sheet metal screws were used to fasten the mounts to the bone. Adhesive photographic targets were attached to every body segment of the test subject. The approximate location of the segment center of gravity was identified by 5 cm square targets and the joints by 2.5 cm circular targets. Each seg- ment was also assigned a segment number to facili- tate data reduction. The targets were placed on at</page><page sequence="6">SIMULATION OF PEDESTRIAN-VEHICLE IMPACTS 257 1 least 3 sides of each segment for camera identifica- tion. They were attached to the outer skin of the anthropomorphic dummy and to the outer surface of leotards worn by the cadavers. The joint resistance in the unembalmed cadaver is very low. For a realistic simulation of the pedes- trian impact, it was necessary to stiffen the knee and neck. The subject was supported on one leg to simulate a walking or running gait. That was also the impacted leg which was required to carry up to 90% of the body weight just prior to impact. More- over, the head was maintained in an upright posture during impact. The neck was wrapped with a band- age so that it would hold the head up. Dummy preparation was somewhat simpler. The mounts were installed on the metallic structure of the dum- my, using pre-drilled tapped holes. (c) Post-Run Procedures. Following the impact test, photographs of the final position of the cadaver and the impacting vehicle were taken. The cadaver was then placed on a plastic sheet and the leotards were removed. All the accelerometer mounts were removed and a superficial check for fractures was made and noted. The cadaver was then returned to the cooler. X-rays were taken of all body segments of the cadaver. Fractures re- sulting from the impact were confirmed by com- parison with the pre-run x-rays and the superficial observations made immediately after the impact. THE IMPACT EXPERIMENTS There were a total of ten pedestrian simula- tions, five with a 95th percentile anthropomorphic dummy and five with cadavers. The test conditions are given in Table 3 which also lists the total num- ber of accelerometers used for each run. There were three dummy lateral impacts at a nominal speed of 24 km/h or 15 mph (Runs D03, D08, and DIO), and three cadaver runs with the same con- figuration (Runs COI, C02 and C03). Run DIO was made after the 9-accelerometer method of measur- ing angular acceleration was developed. Runs D08 and C05 were 32. 2 km/h (20 mph) frontal impacts while runs D09 and C06 were 40 km/h (25 mph) lateral impacts. The bumper was padded with 15 cm (6 in.) of Ensolite foam rubber in Run C06 to study the effects of softening the front end as shown in Figure 4. A sequence of photographs for Run C06 is shown in Figure 5. The cadaver was lifted onto the hood and was flipped over completely as the head impacted the hood laterally. It slid off the hood, head first. Figure 6 shows one instant of an equivalent dummy impact during which its displacement kinematics were similar to those of cadaver C06 but the dummy rotated on its back in the lateral impacts before its head hit the hood. The rotation was not complete in the case of the cadavers at the time of head-hood impact. RESULTS This study has resulted in a large amount of accelerometer data, part of which will be presented in the form of comparisons between the various runs. The linear and angular accelerations of the impacted leg and the head are emphasized since these two segments frequently sustain severe in- juries. It should be noted that the acceleration components are absolute values, in terms of a body-fixed coordinate system. In this system, the positive x-axis is directed anteriorly and the positive y-axis is directed laterally to the right. Thus, for a right-handed orthogonal system, the positive z-axis is directed inferiorly. This coor- dinate system was identical to that used by the Calspan 3-D gross motion simulator. (a) Comparison of Dummy Runs. Runs D03 and D08 were lateral impacts at approximately the same speed. The principal component of accelera- tion for the impacted left lower leg was along the y-axis. Figure 7 shows a comparison of this component of acceleration. The response of D03 was slightly higher than that of D08 and in both cases, there was considerable ringing, which is a high-frequency vibration of the accelerometer or the structure on which it is mounted. Figures 8 and 9 show the x- and y- component of head accel- eration, which matched very well. (b) Comparison of Cadaver Runs. Figure 10 shows a comparison of y-axis linear acceleration of the impacted left lower leg for Runs C02 and C03. Both were lateral impacts at approximately 24 km/h. It is seen that there is much less ringing in the data. An equally good correlation is seen in the z-axis acceleration of the left lower leg for these two runs, shown in Figure 11. The linear acceleration peak of the head occurred 75 ms later in Run C03 because there was a large difference in stature between the two subjects. The cadaver in Run C03 was over 20 cm taller than that in Run C02 and therefore took more time to impact the hood. The y-axis head acceleration is compared in Figure 12 for these two runs. The x-axis angular acceleration of the head is shown in Figure 13. There is also this 75 -ms time difference between the two peaks. Runs C03 and C06 are not directly comparable because they were made at two different speeds (24 and 40 km/h). However, they were both lateral impacts and the more severe condition in Run C06 was balanced by a padded front end. The y-axis acceleration of the impacted left lower leg is com- pared in Figure 14. It is seen that the first peaks were the same and that there was a higher second peak at 40 km/h due to stiffening the padding. Figures 15 and 16 show the x- and y- axis accel- eration of the head for these two runs. Because of the padding, cadaver C06 did not rotate onto</page><page sequence="7">2572 K. W.

Its y-axis acceleration was predominant. In Run C03, how- ever, the cadaver rotated onto its back before its head hit the hood. The difference in time between the peaks was approximately 75 ms. Again, it should be noted that the higher velocity impact resulted in a higher head peak acceleration. Figure 17 compares the x-axis angular acceleration of the impacted lower leg. In spite of the padding, the peak angular acceleration for the 40 km/h im- pact (Run C06) was higher and there were two peaks of equal magnitude. A comparison of lower leg acceleration be- tween Runs C02 and C05 is shown in Figure 18. The former is a lateral impact and the latter a frontal impact. Although the impact speed in Run C05 was 8 km/h (5 mph) higher, the x-axis accel- eration is lower than that along the y-axis for Run C02. This is attributable in part to the flexibility of the knee joint in anter o -posterior flexion and its limited lateral flexibility. Finally, a comparison can be made of the dif- ference in response between an embalmed and an unembalmed cadaver, subjected to a 24 km/h lateral impact. Figure 19 shows the y-axis accel- eration of the impacted lower leg for Runs COI (embalmed) and C03 (unembalmed). Both legs sustained identical peak accelerations at the same time after impact, but because cadaver COI was osteoporotic, the tibia was fractured at the 60 ms mark and it sustained high g-level oscillations sub- sequently. (c) Comparison of Dummy and Cadaver Runs. It is perhaps of interest to compare the responses of a cadaver with those of a dummy under the same impact conditions. The two runs chosen were D10 and C03. Both were 24 km/h lateral impacts and both subjects were about 185 cm tall. However,</page><page sequence="12">SIMULATION OF PEDESTRIAN-VEHICLE IMPACTS 2577 *2 RUN NO.: LLL o- e C03 2 FILTER 500 HZ. - - » C06 &gt;&lt;8 , l' ' CO ' Q ' ŒO ' COO &gt;v» +aT' 'm. 2°' - ' - -'[ CJ '' I / ' ^ cj 'v v / ' co U v / ' - u 1 1 - i 1 1 0.00 20.00 40.00 60.00 80.00 TIME (MS) Fig. 17 - Comparison of x-axis angular acceleration of the impacted lower leg for runs C03 and C06 2, RUN NO.: LLL .

KRIEGER, ET AL. the cadaver was much lighter in weight. Figure 20 shows the difference in response for the impacted lower leg. The y -axis acceleration spikes of the dummy leg are higher and shorter in duration than those of the cadaver. The head accelerations along the y -axis are also quite different, as shown in Figure 21. The y -axis angular accelerations of the lower torso and the x-axis angular accelera- tions of the upper leg are shown in Figures 22 and 23. The same phenomenon of higher magnitudes and shorter duration spikes is observed for angular acceleration of these body segments. (d) Frequency Content. The frequency content of the two curves shown in Figure 20 was analyzed by using a fast Fourier Transform method and the results are shown in Figure 24. It is seen that for the cadaver (C03), the magnitude of components above 150 Hz were small. For the dummy leg (DIO) these amplitudes were still high at 450 Hz. The frequency content of head acceleration curves for cadavers is shown in Figure 25. The ampli- tudes become small above 300 Hz. A comparison of the frequency content of the impacted leg of an embalmed (COI) and an unembalmed cadaver (C03) is made in Figure 26. The significant amplitudes were all below 100 Hz and there were essentially no components above 200 Hz. It should be noted that the data were filtered at 1000 Hz prior to digitization. (e) Ground Contact Force. The ground contact force exerted by the impacted leg was measured by means of a triaxial load cell. Figure 26 shows the vertical (z-axis) force registered by the load cell for a 24 km/h lateral dummy impact. The vertical force on the transducer built up to approxi- mately 90% of the body weight of the dummy.

However, for a cadaver, there was a sharp rise in this load upon impact, after which it also dropped rapidly. This is shown in Figure 27 for Run C03, a 24 -km/h lateral impact. The subsequent ringing of the load cell occurred after the foot had lost contact with ground. The difference in response is attributable in part to the flexibility of the cadaver leg and knee joint in comparison with those of the dummy. There was an observable lateral flexion of the cada- ver knee and the bumper was able to exert a high downward force on the leg before the foot lost con- tact with the ground. The dummy knee closely approximated a pin joint and did not simulate the cadaver response. (f) Head Injury Criterion (HIC). The relative severity of head contact with hood and ground could not be assessed directly from the measured accel- eration traces. Hood contact was generally lower in magnitude but of longer duration in comparison with ground impact. The HIC was computed for both a dummy and cadaver run (Runs D10 and C05) demonstrate the severity of head-hood impact, as shown in Table 4. Against the hood, the HIC for the cadaver head exceeded 1000 during a 32 km/h frontal impact. It was only 47 for subsequent ground contact. The computation of the resultant acceleration was necessary and, for the cadaver, this was not possible without the 9-accelerometer scheme developed by Padgaonkar et al. (17). CONCLUSIONS (a) Several full-scale experimental simula- tions of pedestrian-vehicle impacts were carried out using cadavers and a 95th percentile dummy as test subjects. As many as 53 accelerometers were used for a single test.</page><page sequence="16">SIMULATION OF PEDESTRIAN-VEHICLE IMPACTS 2581 Q RUN NO.: D03 Z COMP ^ o impact-H PEAK-«-|| 2 I j I t ° - T 14- L - y -*■ - I 'pre ioAl I . || ł ' DIRECTION OF DOWNWARD FORCE (GRAVITY) . 8§. || il ' U-gJ u 1 1 ļ 1 0.00 15.00 30.00 15.00 60.00 TIME (MS) (X10 1 ) Fig. 27 - Vertical ground contact force for run D03 Q RUN NO.: C03 Z COMP X § peak- H in -p_ ! -T in -p_ 1 s ! o IMPACT- H I ■° o Jl A i LJ LO - : J' I ł DIRECTION OF DOWNWARD FORCE (GRAVITY) / J' ' IU §8 K.

(b) In view of the extensive instrumentation, body segment kinematics were well-defined, includ- ing the measurement of angular acceleration of the head, pelvis, upper leg and lower leg. (c) Pedestrian- vehicle impact is a 3 -dimen- sional event during which the body segments execute a wide variety of complex motions. In particular, the tendency for the subject to rotate onto its back was observed in both the dummy and the cadaver. (d) Dummy impacts were more repeatable than cadaver impacts. The height of the subjects deter- mined the time of head-hood contact and the impact velocity determined the violence of motion on the vehiòle hood. (e) A padded front end appeared to lower linear acceleration' but not angular acceleration of the im- pact leg. (f) Based on the HIC, head-hood contact is apparently more severe than head -ground contact. (g) Dummy and cadaver response to almost identical impacts were quite different. (h) The acquired data could be used to validate existing gross motion simulators which are capable of simulating pedestrian -vehicle impact. (i) Skeletal fractures occurred in every cadav- eric experiment. However, a large number of screw holes were made for the attachment of accel- erometers and in many cases, it was not possible to ascertain the exact cause of the fracture.
