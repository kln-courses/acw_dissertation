<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 14 Historicising culture: Father  Ernst Worms and the German  anthropological traditions Regina Ganter When the shy and unobtrusive, often trembling, Catholic Father Ernst  Worms (SAC)1 arrived in Broome at the end of 1930 and was asked  ‘and  how do you like Broome, Father?’, he responded with polite lies  and presumably told his interlocutors what he thought they might like  to hear. What he would have liked to tell them was that it was ‘gross’.2  He saw a society divided along the minute spatial geographies of race and  class, and thoroughly exploitative. He sent his mentor in Limburg a West  Australian pocket yearbook with the comment:  [L]ook at the high wages in Broome, whereas the non-whites, i.e. blacks,  half-castes, Chinese, Malays, and Japanese, are given dogs’ wages  [werden mit einem Hundelohn abgespeist]. Blacks are almost always given  £1 a month! The government doesn’t care.3  1  Worms later Anglicised his Christian name to Ernest. SAC stands for Society of the Catholic  Apostolate, colloquially referred to as the Pallottines, named after their Italian founder, (Saint)  Vincent Pallotti.

He tried to live up  to the expectations of his superiors as the pioneer of a new age of missions.  Father Worms (1891–1963) was the first of the Pallottine stormtroopers  of the Prefect Apostolic in the Kimberley, Father Otto Raible (SAC), who  had a grand vision for an expanded Pallottine presence in the Kimberley.  In 1935, Raible became the first Pallottine bishop in Australia. The  German Pallottines had been in the Kimberley since 1901, but it took  until 1935 before they were awarded the ecclesiastic administration of  the Kimberley vicariate. Raible defended their sphere of influence on  two major fronts: against the competing Spanish Benedictines based at  New Norcia, who had challenged the presumed Pallottine territory with  their Drysdale River Mission, and against the increasing intervention of  a secular state bureaucracy claiming absolute control over Aboriginal affairs  in Western Australia. Raible’s new age of mission involved the acquisition  of a productive farm in the emerging southern wheatbelt (Tardun); the  (short-lived) introduction of two experts in tropical medicine from the  Würzburg institute for mission medicine, a Catholic college founded in  1922 (Leugers 2004: 112),4 Dr Johann Betz and his wife, Ludwina Betz- Korte;5 the introduction of a professor of linguistics from the Orientalist  Seminar in Berlin, set up to train public servants in the German empire,  Dr Hermann Nekes (SAC); and the establishment of a theological  training college in Kew, Melbourne. The last initiative resulted in  a generation of Australian-born Pallottines and stood the Society of the  Catholic Apostolate (SAC) in good stead during and after World War II  and eventually assisted the shift from remote Indigenous mission to urban  youth work inspired by the German Pallottine Schoenstatt movement,  which focused on the involvement of laity. The Pallottines in Melbourne  became strongly involved with Catholic Action, an anti-communist  movement associated with Bob Santamaria that caused the Labor Party  split in 1956 (Nailon 2001: 161–3).  Worms, trained in the Schoenstatt tradition, had been associated with  a  similar youth initiative after his ordination in 1920, when he was  stationed near Königsberg to minister to Neudeutsche (‘new Germans’)  after the redrawing of national boundaries at the end of World War I  (Ihle 1968: 405–27). Worms received two months of training in mission  4  For the Würzburg institute, see: www.medmissio.de/. 5  ‘Betz, Johann Dr and Ludwina Betz-Korte’, in Ganter (2016). 358 </page> <page sequence="3"> 14 . HISTORICISING CuLTuRE medicine at the Würzburg college before he travelled to Australia in  November 1930 on the German Lloyd ship Trier, which carried almost  100 German missionaries of different denominations to Singapore,  destined for various parts of the Asia-Pacific.6  Worms’s training in theology and philosophy at Limburg reflected the  intellectual traditions of the German universities.7 He commenced his  Australian research very much within the vision explicated by Rudolf  Virchow regarding the capacity of missionaries to inform, collect and  research, which formed part of the German instructions for scientific  travellers and collectors that left the theorising to the metropole and  favoured the recording of observations in the field ‘uncontaminated by  theory’.8 Worms began his work in the Kimberley with wideranging  scientific observations. For at least the first three months in Broome, he  meticulously recorded the weather, including temperature, cloud cover,  wind direction, rainfall and any unusual phenomena. He inspected  a petrified tree (at a place recorded as Ten Mile Mill) and followed up  on reports of a figure of Christ appearing in the intertidal zone. He also  visited the Port Hedland rock art galleries already described by Elkin and  Basedow and subject to much discussion and speculation.  Worms spoke German, English, French and Latin and his theological  training in Limburg had included linguistic training (1918–20) from  Hermann Nekes (SAC), who was known for his work in Cameroon— the major field of Pallottine involvement—on tonology and foreign  influences in the Bantu languages. During his first year in Broome,  Worms began working on the Yawuru language under the guidance of  Nekes in Limburg. Worms was very awake to the cultural influences and  dramatic changes being wrought on the Kimberley communities by the  lugger industries that brought many Asians to the northern ports and  provided easy mobility for its Indigenous workers. Broome, in particular,  had become a second home to many workers from Timor, Rote and  other nearby islands (Yu 1999: 49–73). By May 1933, Worms urgently  requested a Malay grammar. The core of his work became the attempt to  decipher layers of cultural influences on the roadmap of the diffusionist  6  Josef Schüngel SAC to Bernd Worms, 2 August 1988, in Worms, Ernst, P.

Not a Malay grammar, but Nekes himself arrived in the Kimberley in  1935 with the newly appointed Bishop Raible. Nekes was very familiar  with the work of Father Wilhelm Schmidt (SVD: Society of the Divine  Word). Schmidt was founder and editor of the Anthropos journal, president  of the International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological  Sciences and founder of the papal missionary ethnological museum in  the Lateran Palace in Rome. Schmidt was known for his contribution to  the study of  the language families of the world, with the identification  of the Mon-Khmer language as a link between Asian and Austronesian  languages. Schmidt’s eight-volume Ursprung der Gottesidee (The Origin of  the Idea of God, 1955) asserted monotheism as the condition of primitive  religions, and he subscribed to the idea of pygmy races as an Urvolk  360 </page> <page sequence="5"> 14 . HISTORICISING CuLTuRE observable across the world—an idea that had emerged in Germany in  the 1890s and was also adopted by Norman Tindale and Joseph Birdsell  (1941).9 Implicit in Schmidt’s work was the deeply held assumption,  shared with his German-speaking contemporaries, that language reflected  the Volksgeist, so that language, culture and religion formed a cohesive  cultural complex (Gingrich, Chapter 2, this volume; Kenny 2013).  These four ideas are mirrored in the work of Worms without being  explicitly theorised: 1) an affirmation of a basic unity of Aboriginal  languages, as distinct from the Tasmanian languages, which were ascribed  to 2) a prior Ur-population, 3) traces of monotheism in these older  cultural strata, and 4) the idea of the centrality of language in expressing  and communicating culture. Worms did not see it as his task to develop  new theories, only to map his findings on to the contemporary credible  explanatory paradigms.  It was Schmidt’s (1919) work on the structure of Australian languages  that led Worms to think of his magnum opus on Australian religion  along the fault lines of a significant distinction between ‘Australian’ and  ‘Tasmanian’ religions as a working title for his book.10 In 1962, Worms  was ‘just polishing’ the manuscript, expecting an imminent publication;  alas, the book did not appear until after his death, heavily edited and  reconceptualised with the fault lines flagged in the title shifted for a more  modern audience to ‘Australian’ and ‘South Pacific’ religions.11 Worms  had already realised in 1958, when he reviewed Arthur Capell’s book on  Australian languages, that Schmidt’s structure of Australian languages was  ‘no longer tenable’, but it was too late for him to rethink his book on  religions and he could not give up the underpinning idea of migration  and diffusion that had scaffolded all his work.12  9  Schmidt’s urgent appeal in 1910 to study the pygmy races is discussed in Gusinde (1957). 10  Worms had as a working title ‘Die Religion der australischen und tasmanischen Eingeborenen’  (The religion of the Australian and Tasmanian Natives). 11  The work was published as Worms and Petri (1968). 12  In his book review, Worms conceded that the Victorian languages were not as archaic as Schmidt  thought and that there was little evidence of a southward movement of the Victorians, nor could  the Victorian languages be considered a block. Aranda, on the other hand, could not be considered  an erratic appearance in the Australian languages as Schmidt had thought. A relationship between  the Tasmanians and the northern Queensland pygmoids could not be established and it was likely  that the languages that had developed in Victoria represented an autochthonous development that  rendered Schmidt’s theory of waves of migration untenable (Worms 1958). 361 </page> <page sequence="6"> GERMAN ETHNOGRAPHY IN AuSTRALIA Schmidt, in common with the weight of opinion among German  ethnographers in the nineteenth century, was strongly anti-evolutionist,  resisting the idea of a progression of humankind from primitive to  cultured. One of Schmidt’s disciples, Wilhelm Koppers, sent Worms  a copy of a little-known 1959 German publication on ‘the error of  Darwinism’ (Nachtwey 1959), which expressed the anti-evolutionist  stance they all shared.13 Worms felt that the German ‘new ethnology’  of Ratzel, Graebner, Frobenius and Schmidt ‘harmonised with Catholic  thought’, because it resisted evolutionist thought and therefore made  room for the Christian creation story, and because it affirmed the  existence of monotheistic conceptions in primitive cultures rather than  positing a unilinear development from atavistic to polytheist and finally  monotheist religions. In one of his populist publications in 1947, Worms  single-handedly dismissed the work of Frazer, Tylor, Spencer and Morgan  as ‘pre-modern ethnology’ ‘enslaved to evolutionism’ and craftily asserted  that only the English scholars (‘except for Andrew Lang’) still lagged  behind ‘new ethnology’ (all of which was in German). He leaned on Max  Müller’s ideas about the ‘heaven fathers’ of ancient European societies to  refute allegations by Australianists such as Howitt that the ‘missionaries  had invented the high God’ in their interactions with Indigenous people  (Worms 1947: 11). Clearly, Worms’s ethnography was driven by the desire to comprehend  Aboriginal religion in terms that were decipherable to Christian thought.  The basic, though largely implicit, tenet of Worms’s work was that in  the Kimberley an older stratum of beliefs included an all-father, who was  public knowledge and could be freely referred to, and this was over-layered  with more recent influences from the geographic centre (Worms 1955a).  He observed about the Bardi that they practised monogamy and their  initiation involved the knocking out of a tooth (Worms 1938a). He also  discerned in the Bardi language a morphological connection between the  word for sun and terms associated with initiation, and therefore supposed  that the older culture may have had a sun-worshipping component  (one of the ‘lemes’ identified by McGregor, in Chapter 13, this volume,  as a linguistic technique used by Worms). All of these characteristics were  taken as indicators of an older culture observable in the Kimberley in  keeping with Schmidt. A shared and identifying element of the newer  13  This book, along with many others gifted to Worms by his German colleagues, even well after  his retirement, remains in the library of the Pallottine house in Kew to which Worms retired.  362 </page> <page sequence="7"> 14 . HISTORICISING CuLTuRE ideas, stories, ceremonies and objects was that they were protected  with restrictions and secrecy. Worms deciphered this diffusion through  comparisons with the findings of Ronald and Catherine Berndt from  Arnhem Land and of Carl Strehlow on the Aranda and Loritja/Gogadja.  Worms gradually adjusted his orthography to that of these three authors,  leaving behind his initial adherence to Schmidt’s Anthropos alphabet,  which was not favoured by English speakers, so Bād became Bard, N’ol- N’ol became Njul-Njul, Jaueru became Yaoro and Gorañara became  Guraŋara, more akin to Berndt’s Kurangara, a recent ritual complex to  which Worms devoted much thought. Worms remained strongly devoted  to the Kulturkreislehre (‘culture circle theory’) concept of Schmidt and  Koppers, which he romanticised as a methodological tool:  [We] must use historical culture-circle method, a very complicated and  exacting technical procedure which could be compared to the work of  a geologist in determining relationships and stratifications in the earth.  (Worms 1947: 11) Worms used every methodological instrument available to him—oral  history, legends, observations of culture, language morphologies and,  finally, rock art—to decipher diffusion, and attempted to place changes  in a historical framework to match them with these German theoretical  approaches.  A detailed description of the stages of initiation (published in German  in 1938a) emphasised several Kulturkreis elements.14 The quartz knives  used had been brought from the mountainous inland and had the same  name on the coast and in the desert. Several of the ceremonies required  the collaboration of people other than one’s own, and the ceremony of  the Karajarri he witnessed was held on mission land much further north,  outside their territory (Worms 1938a, 1938b). Elsewhere, Worms also  noted that, among the Bardi, the four-week-long preparatory instructions  taught the young men ceremonial words for everyday objects—often  obsolete or foreign words (Worms 1950a). One of the Karajarri initiation  songs could not be translated as the performers claimed not to understand  the words. It was just the same with initiation songs of the Bardi, Dyaro  and Nyulnyul, and Worms commented that he often encountered this  with regard to texts that had been imported along the Fitzroy River.  14  Worms specified that he studied Karajarri (Garadyari at La Grange, Cape Bossute), Yawuru  (Yaoro around Broome), Bardi (Baad at Lombadina), Nyulnyul (Beagle Bay), Jaru (Dyaro, south  of Halls Creek) and also Walmajarri (Walmadyeri/Warmala, towards Gregory Salt Lake). 363 </page> <page sequence="8"> GERMAN ETHNOGRAPHY IN AuSTRALIA This  comment served to support his suggestion of a cultural diffusion  from the centre, but Worms omitted to mention that Strehlow had  already described the same phenomenon—of a secret ritual language— among the Aranda.15  Worms managed to translate the Nyulnyul song and sent it, together  with a wax cylinder, to Marius Schneider at the Völkerkundemuseum  in Berlin. He realised early that the explanation that a text had come  from elsewhere, and could therefore not be translated, might be a layer  of protection. With regard to the curse incantations of the Kurangara/ Gorangara complex, he wrote: This supposed untranslatability, and the endeavour to ascribe the origin of  a curse song to another group of people, stems from the desire to protect  a larger secret and leave to a distant tribe the odium of having created such  a supposedly gruesomely effective saying. (Worms 1940: 221)16 Still, he lent much credibility to explanations of texts, objects and ideas  as ‘coming from the east’. Worms showed one tjuringa (he used the  Aranda term with Strehlow’s spelling) that was given to him (possibly  his first) to several different people, all of whom gave somewhat different  explanations of it. One said it had come from the Nykina (neighbours  towards the east), one said it had come from the Ngarinyin (located in the  north-east) and another said it had come from the Walmadjeri (located  in the south-east) (Worms 1950a: 641–58). It is not clear whether the  informants referred to the object itself, the meaning inscribed on it or the  very idea of the tjuringa, as a cultural import. (Worms was well aware that  tjuringa were also made locally.) Worms used this range of information on  the same object to show the ubiquity of explanations of things ‘coming  from the east’. (In my opinion, a subject position on the west coast of  a peninsula on the West Australian coast almost dictates that practically  everything comes from the east—even if just a little further east, such as  Galalang coming from Sunday Island.)  15  ‘Teil Das Soziale Leben der Aranda und Loritja, I. Abteilung’ in (Strehlow 1907–20: Vol. IV,  pp. 28–32) and ‘II. Abteilung’ (Vol. II, pp. 47–54). 16  ‘Diese angebliche Unübersetzlichkeit und das Bestreben, die Herkunft der Fluchgesänge einem anderen  Volke zuzuschreiben, entspringt dem Wunsche, ein grösseres Geheimnis zu schützen, und das Odium der  Urheberschaft eines nach ihrer Ansicht so grausig wirksamen Spruches einem entfernt wohnenden Stamme  zu überlassen.’ 364 </page> <page sequence="9"> 14 . HISTORICISING CuLTuRE Because of frequent references to influences coming from the east, and  because of his theoretical mind map, Worms consistently discounted  a cultural influence from the north. For example, in response to a study by  Daniel Sutherland Davidson arguing that the fire saw had been imported  ‘from the direction of Timor’ (Davidson 1947), Worms published an  alternative explanation in the same year in which Griffith Taylor also  reaffirmed a much older pygmoid migration from New Guinea or the  Philippines (Winlow 2009). Worms agreed that the fire drill was the older  technology, not subject to any restrictions, and that the fire saw was a more  recent introduction and was used only by elder males. Worms had visited  the so-called pygmy tribes of Halifax Bay and Palm Island and found  that one of these groups did not have the fire saw. He also determined  that the words for fire were similar between these north Queensland  languages and those of Tasmania and the Kimberley (Worms 1950b).  This observation is suggestive of the pygmy migration theory embraced by  Schmidt, which imagined this older civilisation pushed to the margins of  the continent. Worms agreed with Davidson that the older fire drill must  have accompanied the ‘earliest migration’ from Cape York towards the  west. But he discounted a South-East Asian origin for the fire saw—first,  because it was also known to the eastern pygmoid people at Palm Island  and Cape York; and second, because the Nyulnyul assured him that the  fire saw had come to them from the east. On the basis of a comparison of  29 languages in the Kimberley, New South Wales and north Queensland,  Worms assumed that the fire saw was imported from the southern  suffixing languages, ultimately from Central Australia (Aranda), and had  moved northwards across the Dampier Peninsula (Worms 1950b).  Worms’s language morphologies were imaginative (see McGregor,  Chapter  13, this volume), but, trapped by theory and a literal  understanding of oral history, he never sought the same kinds of (‘lemic’)  similarities between Australian and Malay languages. By Worms’s own  method, one might find the similarity between garidja, the mythical eagle  ancestor that brought fire to the Bardi, according to Worms, and garuda,  the Indonesian term for eagle deriving from Sanskrit, where it denotes  a mythical bird-man, at least striking, and would begin looking for  similar word/meaning pairs, perhaps at Cobourg Peninsula, where Father  Confalonieri had already undertaken significant language work.  Similarly, although Worms recognised that circumcision and subincision  (and the four-class marriage system) had been adopted in the Kimberley  in the not too distant past, he ignored the potentially extraneous origin  365 </page> <page sequence="10"> GERMAN ETHNOGRAPHY IN AuSTRALIA of some of the words given to him for the stages of male initiation. For  example, at the second stage of initiation, a young man was called nindi  or orongganyano. With recourse to a Malay grammar, Worms might have  found the first part of the alternative term suggestive of the Indonesian  word orang (‘man’/‘person’). The fifth level was described as bungana, not  unlike the term bunggawa used in the trepang fishery for ‘headman’ and  related to the term abang for ‘elder brother’—an Indonesian respectful  address (Macknight 1969, 1976). At Elcho Island, where a succession of  elders have liberally revealed the Macassan connection, the secret-sacred  language used in rituals was explained as a form of Malay (or at least  containing many Malay words), the language that was also used to address  the first Europeans in the Top End.17  Elders in the Kimberley have made no such disclosure and, at any rate,  the theory underpinning the work of Worms did not countenance such  an extraneous influence. The cultural and linguistic similarities between  the Kimberley and the centre that Worms found reflected in the work  of Carl Strehlow suggested a Central Desert origin for most phenomena  that he identified in the Kimberley as more recent. He concluded that  there were many signs of the imposition of a Central Australian culture  on the more primitive north-west Australian culture (Worms 1950b). By  more primitive, he meant an older culture that was less complex than the  contemporary one, rather than undeveloped in the evolutionist sense.  Worms published 50 Kimberley legends in German (1940) to which he  referred as migratory myths and plumped these for religious ideas. He  attempted to arrange the various culture heroes in historical order of arrival  in the Kimberley (Djanba – Djamar – Minau or Bamar – Galalang). This  attempt at theorising (Worms 1952) is not very convincing,18 perhaps  because the project was upended by the regional ‘nicknames’ with which  17  Interview with Terichini Yumbulul, Galiwin’ku, Northern Territory, June 1995. He was the son  of David Burrumarrra, a chief informant for the Berndts, Ian McIntosh, Peter Spillett and others  regarding Macassan contact (McIntosh 1994; Ganter 2006: 42, and passim).  18  Djamar is judged to be extraneous although he was said to have come to Lombadina from  (nearby) Sunday Island. Galalang, thought to represent the oldest and ‘indigenous’ stratum, was also  described as having come from Sunday Island (like Djamar) when the informant was only a boy.  Minau, also referred to as Bamar, were said to have introduced obscene dances as well as polygamy,  circumcision and subincision (and therefore sound more like a composite of Djanba and Djamar).  The Bardi informants (but not the Nyulnyul) thought Galalang’s times were better, which suggests  that Galalang’s times had only recently receded, so that a two-tier cultural shift, rather than a four-tier  one, seems a more credible interpretation of Worms’s results. One Bardi man referred to the people  at Cossack (pearling harbour) as cannibals, indicating that they had very different customs from the  Bardi, and he himself preferred the ‘olden time’, related to Galalang (Worms 1952). 366 </page> <page sequence="11"> 14 . HISTORICISING CuLTuRE Luise Hercus also struggled in the Diyari legends.19 Djanba, the most recent  introduction, was associated with the ‘Gorangara cult’, which Worms and  Bishop Raible first encountered near Balgo in 1938. Worms described it  as an immoral, dangerous cult of black magic that was spreading across  the Kimberley, striking fear into people. Worms had no inkling that it was  a contact cult directed against colonisation (Redmond, Chapter 16, this  volume), just as the Jesuit missionaries on the Daly River had observed  the Tyaboi in the 1890s without any idea that they themselves featured in  its ritual enactments (Rose 1998).  Missing from Worms’s historical line-up of culture heroes in 1952 was  Djanggala, the supernatural being of the Kimberley, which Worms  thought was a local version of Djanggawul, reported by Berndt in  Arnhem Land. The Berndts were supplying ample evidence of a lively  contact and traffic between Makassar and south-east Arnhem Land that  had ended only in 1906, including the oft-cited story of Djalajari, who  had spent many years in Makassar and had a family there (Ganter 2006:  Ch. 2). But the Berndts rendered Macassan terms in unrecognisable  spelling, often unsuspecting of a Malay origin of words they took to  be Yolngu-matha. For example, the Berndts refer to a place in Arnhem  Land as ‘Libabandria’ without realising that this is the Macassan name  Lembana panrea (meaning Tradesmen’s Bay) adopted into Yolngu-matha.  Kampung Maluku, a district of Makassar, is rendered as Kambu’malagu,  Captain Daeng Tompo appears as ‘karei Deintumbo buga’ (which includes  both karaeng/‘king’ and bunggawa/‘headman’). Captain Husein Daeng  Rangka, also known as Jago (‘fighting cock’), appears in Djalajari’s story  recorded by Berndt as Captain Jadjung, identifiable by his vessel, the Patti  Jawaya, written as Batadjowa.20 Similarly, among the 43 terms Mawulan  gave to Berndt in 1947 for objects and parts of a lugger, there are also  recognisably Indonesian words such as gula (‘sugar’) for syrup, rendered  19  Luise Hercus (Chapter 5, this volume) referred to some of the mura-mura recorded by Reverend  Georg Reuther, which she was able to identify only through reference to the work of Spencer. 20  Other Macassan placenames in Arnhem Land were Lemba Moutiara (Pearl Shell Bay) and Lemba  Bingangaja (Trepang Bay). The Yolngu also adopted the Macassan placename of Kodinggareng Island  for Gunyanggarra (aka Ski Beach at Yirrkala), and Garra-mangalai in Caledon Bay (aka Grays Bay)  derives from Karaeng Mangnellai (King Mangellai, referring to the genealogy of the Macassan captain  Mangellai Daeng Maro) (Ganter 2006: Ch. 2; Macknight 1969: 180–5; Berndt and Berndt 1954: 53). 367 </page> <page sequence="12"> GERMAN ETHNOGRAPHY IN AuSTRALIA as gwula.21 What all this means is that the rendition of an unrecognised  loan word must be read with some latitude (for example, Djalajari is also  rendered as Charley Charley).  Worms’s guiding theories prevented him from casting his inquiries towards  such extraneous influences from the north, though he well knew that  contact between different Aboriginal groups in the lugger industries had  produced a bewildering array of new customs and ideas.22 He assumed  that the starting point of introduced terms and customs was somewhere  in South Australia and the Central Desert, but he was, at this early stage of  Australian linguistics, unable to draw on a consistent method to identify  the changes to which word stems had been subjected. Much more recently,  Nicholas Evans’s study of Macassan loan words at Cobourg Peninsula,  based to a large degree on the work of Father Angelo Confalonieri in the  1840s, found that the Iwaidjan languages are the ‘linguistic equivalent  of a  well-stratified archaeological language site’ (Evans 1997: 239).  Evans uses a credible methodology for identifying linguistic adaptations,  whereas, 50  years earlier, Worms was casting around, guided by the  methods of Nekes and Schmidt (see McGregor, Chapter 13, this volume).  It was the Frobenius Expedition in 1938–39 that directed Worms’s attention  to rock art as a way of deciphering historical layers of culture. Before  their arrival, Douglas C. Fox, the American journalist who accompanied  the expedition and who had mounted an African and European rock art  exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1937 with Leo  Frobenius, sent the accompanying book to Bishop Raible.23 Leo Frobenius  had founded the Research Institute for the Morphology of Civilisations  in 1923 (and the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Kulturmorphologie),  a  fringe school of thought hotly discussed in Germany but virtually  21  Not being familiar with Malay, Makassar or other regional languages, I am only able to identify  Indonesian words. When I pointed out the gula/gwula similarity in a personal communication at the  Berndt Museum in 2013, Sandy Toussaint’s Indonesian-speaking assistant was able to identify further  Indonesian words in the same document: Mawulan’s drawing on butcher paper, June 1947, Berndt  Collection, Nr. 7246, Berndt Museum of Anthropology, Perth. 22  Worms observed that much of this circulation of culture arose from the work on the pearling  luggers and innovations were still within living memory. For example, the two-class skin system of the  Kimberley had been replaced with the four-class system (of the Aranda, according to Worms) through  contact with Ngamula people at Cossack since the 1870s (Worms 1952).  23  This book, with a dedication by Fox, is held in the Pallottine library in Kew (Frobenius and  Fox 1937). 368 </page> <page sequence="13"> 14 . HISTORICISING CuLTuRE unknown elsewhere.24 The idea of cultural morphology sat well with the  historicising diffusionist empiricism also present in Schmidt, at least in  methodological terms. The Pallottines welcomed this expedition to their  northern missions and, in Worms’s biographies, his role in the Frobenius  Expedition is somewhat overstated, suggesting that Worms facilitated  or hosted the expedition.25 In fact, Frobenius was unable to accompany  the expedition, and Helmut Petri’s book arising from it makes little  reference to Father Worms, other than a criticism of his ‘Aranda origin’  theory (Petri 1954). (Petri also omits to mention the Australian emerging  scholar Arthur Capell, who accompanied them.) Worms met Petri on his  arrival in the Kimberley (after which Worms and Raible set off to find an  alternative site for the Rockhole mission in the desert area, later called  Balgo) and again at the conclusion of Petri’s northern fieldwork in January  1939. They also met many years later at the end of Worms’s own Wenner- Gren Foundation–funded fieldwork in October 1960, when Worms  met up with Petri and Gisela Petri-Odermann at La Grange mission to  record Garadjeri (Karajarri) songs,26 and presumably also during Worms’s  German lecture tour in 1947.  Petri and Lommel’s exhibition of Aboriginal rock art in London in January  1947 received much attention (Worms 1953b) and spurred Worms into  further work on northern Australian rock art, which was also receiving  increasing attention in Australia (Basedow 1925; Elkin 1930). Unlike the  visitors from overseas and the south, he was able to position himself as  the resident expert, and based himself in Broome again for a Wenner- Gren Foundation research grant in 1953 and 1954 to decipher layers of  cultural periods from petroglyphs and pictograms. He revisited the rock  art galleries at Port Hedland and galleries in the Abydos/Woodstock area  of the Pilbara, along the Gibb River and near Kalumburu. Worms became  24  Professor André Gingrich explained that the Frobenius school of cultural morphology might be  characterised as a neo-Herderian German romanticism with an anthropomorphic frame that focused  on cycles of emergence, maturity and decay of cultures. In a personal communication, he added that  it was somewhat ‘fringe’. See Gingrich (Chapter 2, this volume).  25  News reportage emphasised Worms’s role in hosting the Frobenius Expedition. For example:  ‘Dr. Petri, of the Frankfort Ethnological Museum, who is the leader of the Frobenius expedition for  the comparative study of primitive and prehistoric culture, will arrive to-day by the overland express.  He made thorough researches of the cave paintings in the north of Western Australia. Dr. Petri will be  the guest of Father Rector Worms, of the Pallottine Missionary College, Kew’ (The Argus, [Melbourne],  10 January 1939: 6).

Although  Worms does not make this explicit, it is reasonable to assume that his  ways of seeing rock art were by now guided by the work of Frobenius,  Petri and Lommel. What he saw was ‘a succession of aboriginal and ethnic  migrations’ (leaning now on ideas of migration rather than diffusion).  At Gallery Hill, the depictions of sexual acts were confined to the  upper stratum of the ‘Woodstock figures’. The absence of traces of the  masculinist Gorangara cult from the lower strata of rock images confirmed  that it could not be autochthonous and was clearly introduced. Worms  also observed that the Gorangara had not yet reached Port Hedland.  One of Worms’s missionary predecessors, the Spanish Father Nicholas  Emo, had already produced a sketchbook of the giro-giro (Bradshaw  figures, aka Gwion Gwion) at the Drysdale River Mission in 1909.27 These  drawings had also been described in 1937 by C. P. Mountford, who felt  that, along the northern coast, Aboriginal art had reached a higher state of  development than elsewhere and presumed that this was through contact  with Malay pearl and trepang fishers. Worms agreed that the style of the  giro-giro figures was much more sophisticated than other rock art styles and  most likely executed with a brush. But he did not accept a Malay influence,  because the sheer number and ubiquity of these paintings ‘render an esoteric  isolation impossible’. Worms thought they were executed in a ‘bushman- like’ manner and favoured a comparison with various African and Spanish  rock art styles. He reported that the local owners claimed that the authors  of these paintings, which had no relevance to them, were a people called  giro-giro. Returning to the pygmy tribe thesis, Worms suggested that  they belonged to ‘a pre-Australoid’, a ‘negrito-Tasmanoid settler period’  (Worms 1955b: 565 ff.). Worms cited a number of legends from different  areas about a now extinct people of short stature. For example, he cited  Strehlow on the story of the Tuanjiraka, small men who once lived north  of the MacDonnell Ranges—again, without suggesting any connection to  tua (‘old’) or tuan (a polite address in Indonesian) (Worms 1955b). If not  27  ‘Emo, Nicholas Fr.’, in Ganter (2016). Worms erroneously claimed that ‘Emu’ had drawn these  in 1905; however, Emo was not at Drysdale that year, so perhaps Worms had this from hearsay and  never saw the sketches. They ended up in the Museum of South Australia, where they are ascribed to  the ornithologist Gerald Hill, who visited the Drysdale River Mission in 1910. Emo’s diary at that  time refers to his work of copying the rock art—mostly while lying on low ledges—and expresses the  fear that Hill may claim the work as his own.   370 </page> <page sequence="15"> 14 . HISTORICISING CuLTuRE for the theoretical frame of reference supplied by Schmidt, the linguistic  puzzle pieces of meaningful or accidental similarities could have formed  a very different pattern for Worms. The once intriguing pygmy theory  has certainly fallen into disfavour for lack of evidence, and, indeed, the  idea of an older cultural stratum does not require a ‘pygmoid’ population.  More recent work confirms a long period of desertion of the Kimberley  between ice ages that may explain the traces of different cultural strata.  Robert Bednarik now suspects a migration most probably from Timor or  Rote about 60,000 years ago (Bednarik 2010). Julia Martínez and Adrian  Vickers supply an overview of maritime mobility in eastern Indonesia in  the historical past and speculate that ‘the name Jawi’ (neighbouring the  Bardi on Dampier Land) ‘may even come from reference to Indonesians’  (Martínez and Vickers 2015: 49).  In 1953, Worms and Nekes’s major work on Australian languages was  finally being published (in microfilm), premised on the fundamental unity  of Australian languages and religions. That year Worms also responded to  Ronald Berndt’s (1951) study of the Kunapipi complex in Arnhem Land,  which included the suggestion that Kunapipi represented an Asiatic, pre- Islamic ‘great mother’ cult or a Macassan importation. Worms was aware  that the dingo had come from South-East Asia ‘in the mists of time’ (Worms  1955a: 146), and he also observed that the bamboo trumpet described  by Berndt was slowly progressing from the Northern Territory through  the east Kimberley towards the west and the ceremonial pole had also  made its appearance in the western Kimberley in two instances. However,  Worms doubted that Kunapipi could be a Macassan importation, because  the name Kunapipi was so strongly rooted in genuine Australian terms  (Worms 1953a).  Worms’s commitment to a basic homogeneity of mainland Aboriginal  cultures that could be discovered through linguistic analysis prevented  him from accepting the idea of foreign influences. He always returned  to the idea that ‘it must be endogenous’ (Worms 1953a) in the sense  that whatever it was that he was examining must have originated from  somewhere on the Australian continent.  Worms’s period of publications commenced in 1938 when he became the  rector of the Pallottine College in Melbourne after a fall from his horse  that exacerbated a wartime injury and confined him to a corset, which  made fieldwork in the tropical north all the more uncomfortable. At Kew  he sought publicity for the missionary work of the Pallottines, who were  371 </page> <page sequence="16"> GERMAN ETHNOGRAPHY IN AuSTRALIA breaking out of their sphere of influence in the Kimberley into the south.  Worms tried to resist cultural stereotypes about Aboriginal people and  attempted to insert a humanist perspective, always emphasising their  equal intelligence in the framework of Pastor Herder’s model of the unity  of mankind. In a radio interview with the Südwestrundfunk (SWR), he  went so far as to perform a corroboree song on air. While practically  under house arrest in Kew during World War II, Nekes (1875–1948) and  Worms produced their oeuvre on the Kimberley languages.  Worms also published the results of an experiment on the sense of smell,  which Nekes had replicated from C. S. Myers of the 1898 Cambridge  anthropological expedition to Torres Strait. Nekes had intended it as  a linguistic experiment, but Worms used it to demonstrate that, against  many assertions about the ‘uncanny’ overdeveloped sense of smell among  Aborigines, there was no evidence of any hyperacuity among Indigenous  people. Their sense of smell showed the same ranges of perception and  agreement as that of white people and, moreover, was overdetermined  by recent experiences. The greatest gender difference was the smell of tar,  which Worms suspected may stem from the identity-forming experiences  of men on the luggers,28 while women may associate luggers and tar with  uncomfortable travel and sea-sickness. The greatest overall agreement was  on the smell of incense, and Worms was quick to accede that this most  likely stemmed from the use of incense in church (Worms 1942b).  Worms began his publication phase at the same time as Petri, with work in  the Vatican’s ethnological series Annali Lateranensi (1938a, 1940, 1942a  and 1957b) and Oceania (1938b, 1942b), an Australian international  journal established in 1931 and edited by the part-German Anglican rector  Adolphus Elkin, who had a special interest in the Kimberley. However, in  the early 1950s, one of Elkin’s students, Mabel Wyllie, produced a scathing  critique of Catholic mission policy.29 From that time, Worms eschewed  Oceania and began to publish in the ethnographic journal Anthropos,  founded by Schmidt (two in 1950, 1952, three in 1953, 1954, 1955,  1957, two in 1958, 1959, 1960, 1961).30 He produced two co-authored  books, over 20 academic journal articles, several book chapters and many  minor publications, including book reviews. Every publication required  28  On the sense of pride obtained through lugger work, see Ganter (1994). 29  Mabel Wyllie, ‘A study of polygynous marriage with special reference to northern Australia ... and  the attitude thereto of administration and Christian missions’ (1952), cited in Erckenbrecht (2003). 30  For a full list of Worms’s publications, see ‘Worms, Ernst Fr.’, in Ganter (2016). 372 </page> <page sequence="17"> 14 . HISTORICISING CuLTuRE the prior approval of the Pallottine Provincial and was reviewed by two  internal censors (Leugers 2004: 113). Nevermann commented that  Nekes had brought photographic equipment from Germany in 1935, but  Worms ‘has hardly any photographs suitable for reproduction’ (Worms  and Petri 1968: 129). However, the Pallottine archives in Limburg  and those in Rossmoyne (Perth) have many good-quality photographs,  though unsorted and mostly without provenance. Worms curated the  ethnographic exhibition housed until recently in the Pallottine mother  house in Limburg, which included many of the objects he described in his  publications, and several photographs in that exhibition (and presumably  also many in the photo collection) were from Worms.  Worms gained an international reputation as a missionary anthropologist.31  During a series of lectures in the United States in April 1960, he participated  in a symposium at a Central States Anthropological Society meeting  in Bloomington, Indiana, speaking about the cultural changes wrought  in Indigenous society, alongside the grand and emerging figures of  Australian anthropology, Adolphus Elkin, W. E. H. Stanner, Catherine  and Ronald Berndt, Jane Goodale, Arnold Pilling, Peter Worsley, Jeremy  Long and others (Worms 1970). The following year, W. E. H. Stanner  invited Worms to present at the conference that inaugurated what is now  the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies.  At age 69, Worms obtained a second Wenner-Gren research grant for a  nine-month-long expedition to Central, northern and Western Australia  during which he visited Ayers Rock (Uluru), the Simpson Desert and rock  art sites in Arnhem Land, and saw bark paintings for the first time. His  fieldwork journal mentions Bathurst and Melville islands, the northern  coast and Mangingrida, Daly River, Port Keats, Katherine, Borroloola,  Amoonguna, Alice Springs, Yuendumu, Papunya, Santa Teresa, Balgo and  La Grange (mostly mission stations). In the process, he was organising  31  Worms followed invitations to speak in Rome, Munich, Münster, Vienna and at the Frankfurt  Frobenius Institute, as well as the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, DC, the Verley University  in San Francisco and the Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Science in Philadelphia. In  his last year, Münster University obtained funds from the DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,  the German equivalent of the Australian Research Council) to invite him back for a semester of  guest lectures in the theological faculty, but he became too ill to travel and had to decline this and  invitations from Cologne and Nijmegen. 373 </page> <page sequence="18"> GERMAN ETHNOGRAPHY IN AuSTRALIA his ideas for his major oeuvre on Aboriginal religions. Religion was, after  all, his area of expertise and the reason ethnography and linguistics were  considered legitimate missionary tasks.32  Worms consistently discounted the impact of South-East Asian contact as  a significant cultural factor and, rather, looked for the large-scale migration  of ideas and people on the continent itself. Everywhere he found evidence  of an intensive cultural and linguistic movement between the south-east  and north-west of Australia, with ‘relatively small and unimportant’ traces  of a foreign element from the East Indies (Worms 1957a: 762). Trying to  make historical sense of the multitudinous cultural influences engulfing  the Kimberley, Worms mapped his observations against contemporary  theories. He was limited—as are we all—by his linguistic capacities, or else  he might well have cast his net of imaginative language morphologies in  very different directions and may have distanced himself from Schmidt’s  language structure much earlier.33 The pygmy migration theory was not  essential for his assertions of diffusion, but it guided him into a search for  historical layers of culture and cultural shifts.  Worms was deeply imprinted by Christian and German intellectual  traditions that led him to a humanitarian approach to Indigenous people  and to attempt to historicise cultural influences with a range of methods.  The greater parts of his publications were in German and, since evolutionary  theory has now lost its supremacist edge, Christian creationism has lost its  interest in scientific discovery and migration theory has been muted by fears  over native title implications, Worms’s work has been marginalised,34 along  with much of the work of German missionaries in Australia. For those  interested in paradigm shifts, as well as for those interested in documenting  attachment to place, there is still much to be discovered from the detailed  empirical research left by Worms and other German missionaries, and my  website on German missionaries in Australia attempts to render such work  more easily accessible (Ganter 2016). 32  In his fieldwork diary, Worms noted pointers for inquiry (‘religious indifference of the  Australians?’), sources to which he wanted to refer and the major insights he wanted to demonstrate,  such as ‘the Australian indigenous expressions (“termini”) are neither childish ways nor mere  metaphors, but meaningful phrases—see Jungmann II’, or ‘the wanjina board and string figures  (gamba) in Kew and Manly are ancestor figures’ (Worms, Cahiers de Terrain, AIATSIS).  33  In his book review of Capell, Worms (1953b) admitted that the central planks of Schmidt’s  structure of Australian languages were no longer tenable.  34  McGregor (2005: 16; 2007) determined that the dictionary produced by Worms and Nekes  ‘presents particularly important information on cultural practices and phenomena that have to my  knowledge long since been forgotten’. 374 </page> <page sequence="19"> 14 .
