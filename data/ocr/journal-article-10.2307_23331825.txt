Indirect Incorporation of Kabbalistic Elements in the Work of Gotthilf Heinrich Schubert" Volker Roelcke Medizinhistorisches Institut der Universitàt Bonn, Sigmund Freud Strafie 25, Bonn D-53105, FRG Abstract - This paper attempts a first outline of an analysis of the connection between the Kabbalah, the tradition of Jewish mysticism, and medicine in the Romantic age. The physician and natural philosopher Gotthilf Heinrich Schubert (1780-1860), a friend and pupil of the philosopher Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, is chosen as a representative of the era. The political, institutional, and philosophical background at the beginning of the 19th century is outlined to make intelligible the contemporary dis position for mystical ideas. The historical lines of connection between the Kabbalistic tradition and Romantic medical thought as represented by Schubert are investigated, and examples are given for some correspondences of ideas and topics. The specific com bination of these topoi, and a multitude of historical lines of connection, primarily through the work of Schelling and the theologian Friedrich Christoph Oetinger, support the hypothesis that Schubert was indirectly influenced by ideas from the Kabbalah. Finally, the history of the reception of Romantic medicine is sketched, with special regard to those strands that are likely to have incorporated elements from the Jewish mystical tradition. 'Romantic Medicine' is a label for a number of related but diverse traditions and positions around 1800 enquiring into the phenomena of nature, health and disease. The Romantic physicians shared their guid ing ideas with other members of the Romantic movement known from the sphere of literature and art.1 Many physicians and scientists of the age were directly or indirectly influenced by the idealist 'Natur * Modified version of a paper presented at an international colloquium on 'Kabbalah and Romanti cism', Jewish Mysticism in German Intellectual History.

Because of the extensiveness and complexity of these two subject areas, I shall restrict considerations of historical context and internal connections and correspondences to an exemplary approach. As a representative of the medical world in the Romantic age I have chosen one of its central figures, the physician and natural philoso pher Gotthilf Heinrich Schubert.7 The link to the tradition of Jewish mysticism must, in this first approach to the topic, be through the work of an intermediary, Gershom Scholem - whose comprehensive account of the Kabbalah represents the basic framework for most of the scholarly treatment of the subject - and the more recent work of Moshe Idel.8 Further studies will be required to complete, and per haps correct, the interconnections and problematic areas outlined here, by reference to original sources in the Jewish mystical tradition and by extending research to cover other representatives of medicine in the Romantic era. The paper is divided into three parts: First I will outline the poli tical, institutional, and philosophical background against which medi cine developed in the Romantic era to make intelligible the contem porary disposition for mystical ideas. I will then investigate historical lines of connection between the Kabbalistic tradition and Romantic medical thought as represented by Schubert, with examples of some correspondences of ideas and topics. In the last section I will, outline the history of the reception of Romantic medicine with special regard to those strands that are likely to have incorporated elements from the Kabbalistic tradition. 6 Ernst Benz, Les sources mystiques de la philosophie romantique allemande, Paris: Vrin, 1968; Antoine Faivre, Mystiques, theosophes et illumines au siecle des lumieres, Hildesheim/New York: Olms, 1976; Idel, Qabbalah (footnote 4), pp. 119-120; idem, Kabbalah (footnote 4), pp. 7-8; Scholem, Kabbalah (footnote 4), pp. 196-201. 7 On Schubert's position in Romantic Medicine, see D. v.

ROELCKE I. Background for the Reception of Mystical Ideas Geographically, the school of medicine in the Romantic era that was based on the natural philosophy of Schelling was essentially restricted to German-speaking Europe.9 Politically, this area consisted of a conglomerate of states of extreme variety. In contrast to the large, centralised states of Western Europe, this conglomerate formed a co operative legal association of states with historical and religious foun dations.10 Each of the several hundred states had its own identity and its own autocratic ruler, whose dominating position was a result of the merging of political and ecclesiastical power during the wars of reli gion. The centralised power of the Empire, which still formally exist ed, was vested in the Habsburg dynasty with their residence in Vien na, and was in real terms ineffective outside the borders of Austria.11 Because of the lack of a single uniform economy in this geographi cal area, the power of the subsistence-orientated guilds, the burden of the feudal system, and other factors, the process of industrialisation started much later here than in countries such as England or the Netherlands. The merchants and artisans who made up the middle class at the beginning of the nineteenth century were relatively poor and conservative. To be able to cope with the complicated tasks of modernisation (centralisation of administration and of the armed forces, standardisation of the legal system, improvement of education, etc.), the state developed an increasing interest in the 'educated clas ses.' Thus, in the second half of the eighteenth century, in addition to the aristocracy, and cutting clean across the social estates, there arose a new social type: the 'Bildungsbiirger' (member of the educated classes), university-educated and in most cases bound for a career in the civil service.12 In this context, in the wake of the Enlightenment, 'education' was understood as the 'self-perfection of the powers of the human soul', the full development of individual personality - a con cept with close affinities to neo-humanism. Wehler and others have drawn attention to the similarities between the educational experience and the Protestant, particularly the pietistic, experience of religious awakening and faith, especially the way in which both reject mecha nistic intellectualism.13 9 D. v.

The universities were regarded as seats of corruption and nepotism and university teachers accused of dogmatism and lack of contact with reality. New 'reformed universi ties' ('Reformhochschulen') were founded at the prompting of the authorities; the universities of Halle (founded in 1694) and Gôttingen (1737) were early forerunners of this development. The three faculties of law, medicine and theology were supplemented with a fourth, phi losophy; history, modern languages and the natural sciences became part of general education, and German was introduced as the teach ing language. Moreover, at Gôttingen the relationship between state administration and partly autonomous university corporation was redefined, the freedom to learn and teach guaranteed, and a new mode of working in seminars introduced.14 The separation of disci plines, however, had not yet begun: the physical sciences were still integrated into philosophy, while biology was a part of medicine. It was not rare for one professor to teach in several faculties, as the competence of a single individual often transcended existing subject boundaries. Within the natural sciences, the scene was characterised by the co-existence of a multitude of very various and for the most part eclectic theories together with rapidly expanding empirical knowledge. Contemporary scientists were inspired by the discoveries of Morgagni, Jenner and Withering.15 Another, very broad current in medicine of the day was 'animal magnetism' or Mesmerism. As a stu dent in Vienna, Franz Anton Mesmer, the most influential representa tive of this school during the preceding decades, had studied the writ ings of the doctor and mystic Paracelsus, and attempted in his own work to rationalise Paracelsus' ideas on astrological influences on sick ness and health. Later he revised his theories, postulating the exis tence of universal magnetic forces that can be perceived by the indi vidual and also be transferred to others.16 To summarise: the historical situation was characterised by political backwardness and fragmentation. There was insecurity among the intellectuals, brought up on the ideals of neo-humanism and now found confronted with a bewildering mass of empirical data and the oretical dogmas. Finally, the institutional structure at the universities 14 Ibid., pp. 292-303, and vol. II, pp. 504-520. 15 E.H. Ackerknecht (footnote 3), pp. 129-158; Paul Diepgen, Geschichte der Medizin, vol.

ROELCKE was still such as to allow thinking that crossed the boundaries between disciplines. Against this background there arose, in parallel to empirical medicine and natural science, a series of uniform, comprehensive representations of Nature, attempting to conceptualise the phenomena of the universe in terms of a single underlying principle. Apart from the 'alphabetical' or 'encyclopaedic' types of theory, most of these theoretical schemata refer to the philosophical systems of German Idealism, particularly the works of Kant and Schelling.17 I shall now briefly outline the concepts of Nature in the thought of these two philosophers that were of greatest importance to the science of medicine in the Romantic age.18 In agreement with the empiricists of the Enlightenment, Kant defines the limits of knowledge by experience, i.e. by man's cognitive capacity. According to Kant, the human understanding ('Verstand') receives its perceptions of objects in the external world with the aid of a priori categories. These concepts - e.g. time, space and causality - have no independent existence of their own, but are categories according to which sensory stimuli are organised into a system of space-time and causal relations. If Nature is understood as the sum total of those objects that can be perceived, then according to Kant Nature must be structured according to these a priori categories, for only thus can Nature be perceived. In this way Nature, as perceived by man, is necessarily a universal system of interrelated phenomena, the relations between which are determined by the structure of man's understanding. The laws of Nature are thus not objective entities of independent existence and validity, but an expression of the qualities of the human mind. Kant argued further that the function of reason ('Vernunft') is to organise the multitude of phenomena registered by the understanding into a uniform system (although, again, predetermined by the qualities of reason) system. Only knowledge organised along these lines accord ing to a priori principles can be called 'science.' The only pure science is mathematics, and the principles underlying science are therefore capable of mathematical expression. 17 D. v.

Rosen (footnote 1).</page><page sequence="7">JEWISH MYSTICISM IN ROMANTIC MEDICINE 123 Kant's concept of Nature and the ideal of science that followed from it appealed strongly to contemporary natural philosophers and medical scientists. The Scottish doctor John Brown (1735-1788) for mulated a theory of disease which achieved wide currency as a para digm during the decades around 1800 and proved fertile ground for the application of Kantian thought to medicine. In this theory there is only one cause of life: excitability, or irritability. Activity arises through stimuli from the external world or from inside the body. According to Brown, every phenomenon of life, especially health and disease, can be explained by mathematically quantifiable changes in irritability. One prominent Brownian was Andreas Rôschlaub (1768 1835), Professor of Medicine at Bamberg. Rôschlaub understood irri tability as a given principle arrived at by the laws of thought and not susceptible of perception, i.e. a Kantian a priori concept. From this superordinate principle Rôschlaub derived thirty basic principles con stituting a complete 'scientific' system of theoretical medicine. This theoretical 'Heilkunde' (science of healing) was clearly differentiated from the practical, empirical branch of medicine, which Rôschlaub called 'Heiikunst'(art of healing). Since the a priori principles of the oretical medicine were only accessible to the understanding, they had no need of empirical confirmation; the purpose of empirical research was merely to illustrate principles that could be deduced by the aid of reason.19 The philosopher Friedrich Wilhelm Schelling had close connections with the medical world. He knew Rôschlaub and another Bamberg doctor, Adalbert Friedrich Marcus (1753-1816), and together with the latter, he edited the 'Jahrbucher der Medicin als Wissenschaft' (Annals of Medicine as a Science) from 1805 to 1808. During his time as pro fessor at Bamberg Schelling carried out practical studies himself at the bedside. Another source of empirical knowledge was Schelling's brother Karl Eberhard, himself a doctor. Schelling's theoretical contri butions to medicine were held in wide esteem: in 1802 he received a honorary doctorate from the Medical Faculty of the University of Landshut, and in 1808 he was elected an honorary member of the 'Physical-Medical Society' in Erlangen.20 In his natural philosophy Schelling took Kant's arguments one step further: he identified the 'a priori' principles of reason with the fun damental laws of Nature. This meant that Nature and the human 19 Nelly Tsouyopoulos, Andreas Rôschlaub und die romantische Medizin - Oie philosophischen Grund lagen der modernen Medizin, Stuttgart: Fischer, 1982; see also G.B.

ROELCKE mind were identical in their origins. Nature and the mind become separated by contemplative reflection ('Anschauung'), which involves the withdrawal of the mind from the external world. Nature is under stood as a living organism whose history is identical with that of mankind. The vitality of Nature the organism is expressed in the ten sion between polarities: at the lowest level (material) in the form of magnetism or electricity, at the level of organic life in the contrast between, for example, male and female. Nature is regarded as 'Geist' coming into being (the German 'Geist' means 'mind' and 'spirit' equally), and the principle underlying Nature and reason is the cre ative Godhead. Knowledge of the laws of Nature is thus the same as knowing the laws of the 'Geist' (mind/spirit), and vice versa, and fur thermore constitutes a revelation of the Absolute. As soon as the underlying principles of Nature and reason have been elucidated, said Schelling, it would be possible to deduce and formulate a complete system of propositions into which all natural phenomena could be harmoniously ordered. The weaknesses of this concept were pointed out by Hegel. Schelling's reaction to this criticism was to introduce the idea of the 'contraction' of God.21 The elements of Schelling's thought that found their way into the natural and medical science of the Romantic age, however, stemmed from his early philosophy of identity, i.e. from before Hegel's criticism. The developments in Schelling's thought that occurred after he withdrew from academic teaching (in 1806) became known only to a very few natural scientists and doctors who were close friends. One of these was Gotthelf Heinrich Schubert, whose work we will examine later. Schelling's early natural philosophical ideas held a great fascination for doctors interested in developing a theory of medicine on which they could base a true 'science' of medicine. Schelling's concept of Nature opened up the possibility of discovering the ultimate causes of the phenomena of life, health and disease by philosophical reflection. Thus philosophy became indispensable to medicine, while at the same time this theoretically-based medicine could help in the formulation of a single theory transcending all the individual disciplines and which would encompass all the sciences, the arts and the political situation. Thus, the biologist Henrik Steffens believed that man's view of Nature 'determined all social order, morality, and even religion',22 and a 21 Christoph Schulte, 'Zimzum in Schelling's work.'

Engelhardt, Romantik (footnote 1), p. 167; quotation translated by V.R.</page><page sequence="9">JEWISH MYSTICISM IN ROMANTIC MEDICINE 125 change in this view would therefore transform man's entire way of life. Focusing more on the individual, the physiologist Karl Friedrich Bur dach asserted that a comprehensive knowledge of the entirety of human nature was necessary 'in order to reach a true understanding of oneself and a clear vision of one's position in relation to the world.'23 These two quotations demonstrate that the natural and med ical scientists of the Romantic era aimed at an anthropology of both the individual and the social body. Their intention in this was to com plement the empirical knowledge that was now accumulating, and to counteract an alienation from Nature that was already beginning. II. Connections Between Romantic Medicine and Kabbalah Very few representatives of academic medicine at the beginning of the nineteenth century referred explicitly to the Jewish mystical tradition.24 Such references as were made were exclusively derogatory in nature, their chief purpose being to defend their authors against the charge of propagating mystical and therefore unscientific thinking. In this context of self-justification, the Kabbalah and other mystical traditions were rep resented as examples of superstition and the spiritualist practices con nected with them, against which the authors drew a sharp distinction to their own theories. An instance of this can be seen in the voluminous 'Geschichte der Magie' (History of Magic) written by Joseph Ennemoser, Professor of Medicine in Bonn, in which he attempts to give a survey of mystical speculations and theories of the past about Nature.25 Denouncing mystical thinking as irrational and unscientific, Ennemoser defends his own speculative theories about 'animal magnetism' as scien tific because they are deduced from purportedly generally valid princi ples and experience (e.g. relating to the significance and influence of sidereal forces). Johann Christian Heinroth, Professor of Psychical Med icine ('Psychische Heilkunde') in Leipzig, attempted similarly to defend himself in a large work: in the preface to his 'Geschichte und Kritik des Mysticismus aller bekannten Volker und Zeiten. Ein Beitrag zur Seelen heilkunde' (History and Criticism of the Mysticism of all Peoples and Ages: a Contribution to Psychiatric Medicine) he writes: 23 Karl Friedrich Burdach, Anthropologie (1837), quoted from Leibbrand, Spekulative Medizin (foot note 1), p. 68; quotation translated by V.R. 24 In folk medicine, and especially within Jewish communities, there were also explicit references to the Kabbalistic tradition or even direct examples of Kabbalistic practices; for an example, see R. Straus, "The Baal-Shem of Michelstadt, Mesmerism and Cabbala', Historia ]udaica 8 (1946), 135-148. 25 Joseph Ennemoser, Geschichte des tierischen Magnetismus, zweite ganz umgearbeitete Auflage, I. Teil: Geschichte der Magie, 2nd éd., Leipzig: 1844.</page><page sequence="10">126 V. ROELCKE It is surely now time to banish mysticism from the field into which it has recent ly reinsinuated itself. The Reader may well wonder how the Author came to take up this work. He may wonder the more since the latter is himself suspected of mysticism. Precisely this, however, constitutes one reason why the Author took up this labour; he wished to allay unjust criticism by an appeal to fact.26 Heinroth claims that his own work is based on empiricism and the Christian religion. Nevertheless, despite the paucity of explicit references to the Kab balah - and those without exception denigrating - there are indica tions that the content of Jewish mysticism did at least indirectly influ ence the thinking of medical practitioners in the Romantic era. The first thing to be said here is that there was general readiness to accept mystical concepts - the ground had been prepared by Schelling with his early philosophy of identity. The roots of this philosophy go back both via Herder to Spinoza and to Leibniz.27 The basic idea of this tradition was the unity of the divine Being: the world was regarded as a revelation of the Divine and Nature as a living organism in whose structure Divine thought was reflected. Electrical and galvanic processes were seen as fundamental forces, manifestations of Divine energy. Thus, the Heidelberg psychiatrist Alexander Haindorf took the life of each individual to be a galvanic process developing between positive and negative poles; the two polarities were encompassed and held together within the soul. He continues: 'The Ideal of the Soul in its highest and purest significance is, equal to the World-Soul, the Principle of the Real and the Ideal in the Universe.28' In addition to the view of Nature as an organismic unity and the connection between the individual soul and the world-soul, other unspecific mystical or gnostic motifs appear in medical texts of the time: for example, the idea of an original androgynous being, or the theory that the world emanated from a single highest principle. The position of these motifs in the context of the Kabbalistic tradition has been described in detail by Scholem.29 Whether the motifs that corre 26 Johann Christian A.

In the following, we shall try to illustrate this assumed link by analysing the case of Gotthilf Heinrich Schubert, a representative of medicine in the Romantic age. II.l. Schubert's Sources Schubert was not only a central figure in the medical and scientific research of his day, he was also a close friend of Schelling until Schelling's death.30 Schubert's importance to the history of medicine lies not in discoveries or descriptions in the fields of anatomy and physiol ogy, but in his contribution to medical anthropology: his thinking about the relationship between man and Nature - and in particular the rela tionship between each human being and his own individual nature - is a part of the legacy of 'Romantic medicine' that later bore fruit. Three of Schubert's works were especially admired. Two of them, 'Ansichten von der Nachtseite der Naturwissenschaften' (Views of the Night Side of the Natural Sciences, 1808) and 'Ahndungen einer allge meinen Geschichte des Lebens' (Intimations of a General History of Life, 1806-1821) achieved a wide readership when they appeared, even among non-scientists. The third, 'Die Symbolik des Traumes' (The Sym bolism of Dreams, 1814), has had a more unusual history: although widely read in Schubert's lifetime, its reception was on the whole mixed, and it was not until the beginning of the twentieth century that the book received express and lasting recognition among psychoana lyists as the first attempt at a formulation of a theory of dreams (see below, III). Schubert's affinity to mysticism has often been referred to,31 but so far no detailed study of this side of his intellectual biography has been carried out by historians of medicine and the natural sciences. Some work of this kind has, however, been done in the fields of liter ary studies and the philosophy of language32 - an indication of how 30 D. v.

ROELCKE Schubert's influence on both his contemporaries and on posterity has extended far beyond the borders of medicine and a 'science' of nature. Schubert's origins in a pietistic family and the external developments of his life prepared him well for absorbing and developing mystical thought. From his autobiography it is clear that Schubert had begun learning Hebrew even before starting his university studies33 - a prere quisite for his later thinking about the 'primal language' and etymologi cal speculations on 'The antithetical meaning of primal words',34 which together with the concept of the confusion of language after Babel played an important part in 'Symbolik des Traumes.' In Schubert's last year at school he became acquainted with the the ologian and philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder and his work. The central importance of Herder for the Nature mysticism of the Romantics has been emphasised by Busch.35 Herder's 'Ideen zur Geschichte der Philosophie der Menschheit' (1784-1791), an unfinished study of human origins and history, gave Schubert the theme for his school-leaving thesis in Weimar. Many years later Schubert still referred to this book.36 On moving to Jena for his university studies, Schubert became a keen frequenter of Schelling's lectures. Soon he became personally acquainted with the philosopher, and in retrospect, he felt that his relationship with Schelling coloured the rest of his life. In the preface to his autobiography, which appeared in 1854, he wrote that Schelling was the man who 'of all others was and remains, for both my internal and my external life, the most influential and most blessed.'37 Details of Schelling's influence on Schubert have already been described in the secondary literature.38 At crucial points in Schelling's work, Kab balistic patterns of thought are to be found, although there is an almost complete lack of explicit reference to Jewish mysticism. It is probable that what Schelling absorbed of the Kabbalah he received via Swabian theosophy, especially that of Friedrich Christoph Oetinger, and also from the work of Jakob Bôhme.39 The leading idea 33 G.H.

Over and over again during his medical and scientific studies, Schubert met in various contexts the theory that interactions exist between the spiritual or mental and the material which could only be understood as galvanic or electric. This idea was represented at the level of theoretical physics, for instance, by Ritter,40 and became wide ly current in contemporary therapeutic practice as 'animal magnetism' or 'Mesmerism.'41 Ernst Benz has pointed out that central thoughts in Mesmer's teachings are already formulated in the work of Athanasius Kircher,42 with which Mesmer had probably come into contact during his university studies. For his part, Kirchner is regarded as one of the 'Christian Kabbalists', a group of mainly South German theologians who, by reference to Kabbalistic texts or motifs, attempted to inte grate mystical experience and related intellectual questions into the existing framework of Christian theology.43 Schubert devoted one of his first publications to 'animal magnet ism',44 and even in his later natural historical works he repeatedly referred to phenomena interpreted in the light of this theory. In regard to the particular topic of 'Elektrizitât als Lebenskraft' (Elec tricity as life force) taken up again later by Schelling among others,45 the Christian theosopher and prelate Friedrich Christoph Oetinger represents a link between the speculations of scientific research and Jewish mystical thought.46 In his discussion with Prokop Divisch about the origin and properties of the first light in creation history, Oetinger drew connections between the latest physical discoveries about galvanism and the Kabbalistic teachings of Chaschmal, the radi 40 Johann Wilhelm Ritter, Beweis, dafi ein bestàndiger Galvanismus den Lebensprozefi in dem Tierre ich begleite, Weimar: 1798; idem, Ν eue Beitràge zur naheren Kenntnis des Galvanismus und der Resultate seiner IJntersuchung oder der Siderismus, Tubingen 1808. 41 See note 16. 42 Ernst Benz, Franz Anton Mesmer und die philosophischen Grundlagen des 'animalischen Magnet ismusAkademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur Mainz, Abhandlungen der geistes- und sozial wissenschafdichen Klasse 4, Wiesbaden: Steiner, 1977, pp. 1-47. 43 E.

ROELCKE ance of the divine throne. The Chaschmal doctrine is an element of Merkavah mysticism, an early stage of the Kabbalistic tradition,47 although Oetinger refers to Isaak Luria who represents a later period.48 Oetinger had already begun to study the Kabbalah when he was studying theology. His autobiography contains many indications of his intensive reading of Kabbalistic texts.49 Oetinger also took advantage of his personal friendship with the Frankfurt Kabbalist Koppel Hecht to increase his knowledge of Jewish mysticism.50 Schubert was fami liar with both Oetinger's work and contemporary secondary literature relating to it,51 and in his autobiography repeatedly mentions Oetinger with great respect.52 Schubert also wrote the foreword to Julius Ham berger's edition of Oetinger s autobiography.53 In his own work Schu bert adopted important elements of Oetinger's thought, even para phrasing him in places. For example, there is an obvious parallel between a passage in Oetinger's 'Biblisches und emblematisches Wôrterbuch' (Biblical and Emblematical Dictionary) in the entry on 'Nature' and the following excerpt from Schubert's 'Ahndungen einer allgemeinen Geschichte des Lebens': There is only One holy Ground of Being, only One Spirit of Life, One in AU, Who alone is and remains in Eternal Creation. His Being is an Acting without Ending ... and His Name is Creation and Transfiguration ... and His Creation is from the Beginning that Eternal, holy Element, from which all things are made ... this Element brings forth from Itself the World.54 This idea of the continual unfolding and revelation of the inex haustible life of the Divinity is also the foundation of Oetinger's main dogmatic work, 'Theologia ex idea vitae deducta',55 and bears a struc tural similarity to the Kabbalistic teachings of the Sefirot.56 47 G.

The French illuminati of the eighteenth century preached a doctrine that basically amounted to a revival of neo-platonic, Kabbalistic and early Christian speculations about the creation of the world. This doctrine was not merely formulated theoretically, but was also put into occultistic-theurgic practice by some illuminati. Saint-Martin had come into direct contact with Kabbalism through his teacher, Martines de Pasqually, who with his father had converted from Judaism to Chris tianity to escape persecution. His chief work, 'Traité de la réintégration des êtres crées dans leur primitives propriétés' (On the Restoration of Beings in their First Spiritual Properties, 1770), interprets the world in the tradition of Sephirot teachings and describes man's possibilities for restoring union with God.58 Schubert read Saint-Martin and probably Martines as well; at Baader's instigation he translated Saint-Martin's work on the primal language, 'De l'esprit des choses', for the 1812 edi tion of which Baader wrote a foreword.59 In his autobiography Schu bert makes express reference to the cross-connections between Saint Martin's thought and the 'Symbolik des Traumes.'60 Through Baader, in Nuremberg Schubert also met the baker and mystic Johann Matthias Burger, in whose library he discovered the writings of Tauler, Swedenborg and Thomas a Kempis.61 Another important stimulus for Schubert came from Baader's own work, particularly Baader's essay 'Uber die Analogie des Erkenntnis - und Zeugungstriebes' (On the analogy of the urges to knowledge and [pro]creation). This essay appeared in 1808 in the 'Jahrbiicher der Medicin als Wissenschaft', published by Schelling and the physician Marcus.62 In this Baader uses the ambiguity of the Hebrew verb yada 57 G.H.

ROELCKE to speculate about the original unity, later polarisation and eventual splitting apart of these two 'urges.' Following these thoughts, Schu bert writes 'That Word ... by which God knew Man and the world and created them from Himself, has for him [Man] acquired the sig nificance of base, sensual lust.'63 Thus Schubert implicates in the act of the separation of man from God two elements or modes of rela tionship that were at first interwoven: expulsion ([pro]creation) and reflection (knowledge). In the initial stage of creation the connection between the subject and that which is other is characterised by the unity of these two modes of relationship, but in the later stages of cre ation and thus of natural history the two modes fall away from each other.64 II.2. Central Themes in the Work of Schubert Schubert presented an implicit theory of language in the 'Symbolik des Traumes', as Schott has shown.65 The roots of this theory go back to Saint-Martin and to Herder and Hamann.66 The leading themes in these linguistic theories of the end of the eighteenth and beginninng of the nineteenth century are questions about the nature of the primal language, the relation between speech and Nature on the one hand and between speech and writing on the other, and discussions of the possibilities of understanding Nature as a spoken or written revela tion.67 Scholem has pointed out that these themes are also of central importance in the Kabbalistic tradition.68 In the 'Symbolik des Traumes', the theory of language has a con stitutive function. As this work plays an important part in Schubert's life work and in the Romantic movement as a whole (see below), and since the traditions just mentioned were directly or indirectly received 63 G.H.

According to Schubert, in her original form Nature was a Word, a revelation of God to man.69 Nature as Word constituted an indissolu ble unity of connection between God and man. In the original condi tion, God spoke within man, and the organ of divine speech was the soul or mind ('Seele'). Schubert located the soul in the human ganglial system, here taking up a distinction made in contemporary physiology between the ganglial and the cerebral system.70 A confusion of lan guage (equated by Schubert with the Fall), arising out of the freedom of man, caused the emergence from the original linguistic unity of two separate spheres of language which stood in opposition to each other: That world of the senses, which should be for us the region of calm, cool reflec tion and metaphorical language, the meaning of which would refer only to the object of our higher inclination, [this world of the senses] is now for us the object of that inclination itself ... Against this, the spiritual sphere has become for us the region of cool reflection.71 Instead of being directed to the true spiritual nature of things, the organ of language reception has become directed towards their sensu al nature; (correspondences between Schubert's and Schelling's con ceptions of language and cognition are pointed out in the notes).72 The confusion of language has led not only to a change in man's abil ity to receive language, but also to a change in what language stands for, or what stands for language, i.e. Nature. The 'Book of Nature' now appears 'like an obelisk engraved in hieroglyphics and lying under the ruins of a destroyed city.'73 The Fall thus also signifies a break in Nature; the history of man is indivisible from the history of Nature. The Fall represents not merely a 'caesura' between Man's original condition and his present condition, but also a breaking apart of Man and Nature: Man no longer understands the language of Nature. The further history of man and of Nature is determined by this separation. It is a history of increasing polarisation and final splitting apart: those that originally belonged together move apart, and discord, 65 G.H.

ROELCKE conflict and finally death arise.74 Schubert argues that this process is effective at every level of the history of Nature and mankind; it can be seen at work in the phylogeny and ontogeny of species as in the history of peoples, e.g. the history of the people of Israel.75 The formation of the differences between the sexes is also explained according to this principle: the development starts in the sexually neutral infant and ends in old age in an existence tormented by extremities of passion.76 On the phylogenetic level, 'the oldest ani mal world that we now know was without sexual difference or androgynous, while the newest shows forth this difference most strongly and markedly.'77 Phylogeny runs from the 'chaste' elephant down to the predators, in which 'destructive force emerges out of its original bonds'78 and Nature has lost her primal harmony. There is an instructive note to this passage in the third edition of the 'Symbolik', glossing 'bonds' ('Gebundenheit') with 'relatedness of the inclination between the sexes with cruelty and the destructive urge, of procreation with death.'79 Schubert distinguishes several levels of language: 1. Ordinary language' or everyday language, belonging to the region of waking life.80 2. 'Hieroglyphic language', the coded metaphorical language of Nature. This language has three levels, dreaming, poetry and revelation, which in that order increasingly approach the intact condition of Nature.81 3. 'Natural language' or the original or primal language, the origi nal text of the hieroglyphic language.82 4. The 'language of God' in man, or the 'language of conscience', through which God can direct man to truth even in the present state of Nature.83 5. The language of reconciliation. This will be the language of man when the confusion of language has been resolved. 74 G.H. Schubert, Symbolik, 1st ed. (footnote 62), pp. 37-39. 75 Ibid., p. 73. 76 Ibid., 3rd ed.

The language of dreams operates according to its own laws, some of which he enumerates: compression, symbolisation, changing of temporal order and personification of events.85 Further more, this language is timeless and universal; it is therefore at least potentially capable of being understood by other peoples.86 The linguistic confusion described by Schubert is an expression of the division in the life of the human spirit: man's spirit is torn apart to exist in two different regions with two different languages. Under the influ ence of civilisation, i.e. the consequences of the Fall, this process of 'divorce' increases continually. The provisional end point of this devel opment is death - provisional, because death is understood as a meta morphosis, a 'rebirth into an original, more perfect existence.'87 As evi dence from natural history Schubert takes insects and worms, which were regarded as the most degenerate species in the history of Nature. From the larva of an insect emerges a butterfly, a symbol of the renew al of existence in a higher state.88 The metamorphosis at the level of an individual's life occurs through listening to the voice of conscience. This listening is understood as a process of healing, in which the two sepa rated spheres of the life of the spirit are reunited. A similar process can occur interindividually, i.e. through mutual recognition of their inner natures by two individuals. This union is facilitated by the condition of somnambulism, which can be induced magnetically or by suggestion.89 Having given some idea of Schubert's theory of language, I shall now attempt to counterpoint it with a few homologous figures or themes from the Kabbalistic theory of language.90 In the Kabbalah, creation and revelation are understood as the self portrayal of God. There are two parallel systems of symbols for this process of self-portrayal: the idea of the step-by-step emanation of Divine light and divine energy in the Sephirot, and that of the unfold ing of the Divine language in holy names and letters. Creation is thus seen as language. In the realm of the finite and determinate, the infi 84 Cf. H. Schott, Poet (footnote 65), p. 231. 85 G.H.

ROELCKE nite and in the last analysis indeterminable aspects of God can only be communicated in the form of linguistic symbols. In this way, every word and every letter spoken by God is filled with a concentration of energy and meaning. This conception culminates in the idea that the Torah is a living organism woven out of variations on the Divine names, and the metaphysical origin of the Torah - and thus of lan guage itself - is the name of God. The task of the Kabbalists is thus to decipher the meaning of the Torah and with it the concealed mean ing of Creation. This requires mystic contemplative immersion in the symbolism of language. At this point parallels become obvious between the Kabbalists' ideas and Schubert's implicit theory of language: in both, Nature/Cre ation is seen as a linguistic expression of God, and an immediate understanding of Nature is normally closed to man. Behind everything visible to man there is concealed a constantly acting power. Both con ceptions also contain a hierarchy of concrétisation of the divine lan guage. In the Kabbalah there are - corresponding to the unfolding of the Sephirot - the unfoldings of the Word from the Original Torah (Torah Keduma) to the Torah whose meaning is not unfolded, then to the written and oral Torah, and then (on the level of revelation acces sible to man) to the various levels of meaning of writing. In Schubert there are the five levels of language described above, corresponding to various levels in the development of Nature. A further common element is in the conceptions of how the hidden meanings in languages are to be decoded. Access to the latent mean ing is via an altered state of consciousness: in Schubert dreams, in the Kabbalistic tradition mystic contemplation. Prophetic phenomena and presentiments of the future are also explained similarly in both linguistic theories: intuitive or mystical recognition of the laws at work in the primal language and thus in Nature allow intuitive extrapolation of this regularity into the future.91 Yet another parallel is the idea of 'internal speech.' In the Kabbal istic tradition, for instance in Abraham Abulafia's doctrine of the essence of prophecy, the thought is formulated that prophecy is God speaking in the rational spirit of man; there is a corresponding image of the human heart as parchment on which God writes living letters.92 Divine speech is here seen as identical with the true intellectual knowledge of the prophet. Schubert's analogous formulation - in the context of a theory of conscience - is of an 'internal speech.' He sees 91 G.H. Schubert, Symbolik (footnote 62), pp. 33-36. 92 G. Scholem, Name Gottes (footnote 68), pp. 56-67.</page><page sequence="21">JEWISH MYSTICISM IN ROMANTIC MEDICINE 137 conscience as an 'organ of the voice of God in man.' Conscience dri ves us like a good spirit to decipher the revelation of Nature.93 How ever, in his present condition man has, through his own fault, lost the power of access to the language of God; he is in a condition of lin guistic confusion. In addition to these outlined analogies between the language theo ries of Schubert and the Kabbalah, there are a series of other themes in the 'Symbolik des Traumes' that indicate an indirect influence of Kabbalistic ideas on Schubert's thought. Without going into detail, I shall just mention a few of these here. Among them are the idea of the increasing differentiation of the sexes from a primal androgynous state. In Isaak Luria we find Adam Kadmon, an anthropomorphic configuration of divine emanations which at first is neuter, but out of Adam Kadmon, after the 'breaking of the vessels' (Shebira), the 'Parzufim' develop (personified aspects of the Godhead), and two of these, Se'ir anpin and Rahel - aspects bearing respectively male and female attributes - form a focus of speculation in the continuing Kab balistic tradition.94 Another parallel is the idea of the melting out and coagulation of divergent affects and attributes, particularly the divorce of good and evil. This notion too is used by Schubert in the history of species and of individuals, while in the Lurian Kabbalah it is used with the con cept of the Shebira in the internal history of the Godhead; in both cases, most notably, evil is also implicated in the undifferentiated pri mal condition, i.e., in the last analysis, in God.93 III. Schubert's Influence Schubert's reception among contemporaries and by posterity has been described from many angles in the secondary literature, and Engelhardt has sketched the outlines of a complete history of his influence.96 In his own day Schubert was read well beyond the limits of the medical and scientific world, as is evidenced by the many editions of 93 G.H. Schubert, Symbolik (footnote 62), pp. 57-68. 94 G. Scholem, Jewish Mysticism (footnote 8), pp. 265-273; M. Idel, Kabbalah (footnote 4), pp. 128 136· 95 Cf. G.

ROELCKE his own works ('Symbolik des Traumes' went through four editions in the author's lifetime) as well as the numerous reviews that appeared in newspapers and journals. Schubert was admired and even compared with Kepler and Newton in some circles, criticised and rejected in others. Of his contemporaries, apart from Schelling and Baader it was mainly painters and writers who were influenced by Schubert, e.g. Jean Paul, Kleist, E.T.A. Hoffmann, Fouqué, Goethe, Eichendorff, Hebbel, and C.D. Friedrich. Around the middle of the nineteenth century, admiration for Schubert, as for most other physicians and scientists of the Roman tic age, began to fade. Empirical natural scientists commented on them increasingly disparagingly. Justus von Liebig, for example, complained in 1840 that he had wasted precious years of his life under the influence of Romantic 'science' and philosophy of nature.97 About the turn of the twentieth century, however, there was a reawakening of interest among psychiatrists, psychologists and philosophers in the scientific thought of the Romantic age.98 Schu bert was seldom expressly referred to, but his ideas were implicitly adopted. This orientation to Schubert and the philosophy and 'sci ence' of nature of the Romantic era resulted in a focusing on the subjectivity of the patient.99 In the field of internal medicine, this occurred from the beginning of the twentieth century in the school of 'Anthropological Medicine' originating in Heidelberg (Krehl, von Weizsacker, who in turn was associated with the 'Kreatur' circle around Buber, Rosenzweig and South-German neo-Kantians). In psychoanalysis and the various sub disciplines that arose from it, including psychosomatic medicine, there was great awareness of Schubert as a precursor in the field. In his 'Interpretation of dreams' and other works, Freud refers fre quently to Schubert, and in his essay published in 1910 'Uber den Gegensinn der Urworte' (The Antithetical Meaning of Primal Words) he has recourse to the etymological speculations of Schu 97 Justus von Liebig, Ueber das Studium der Naturwissenschaften und iiber den Zustand der Chemie in Preufien, 1840, pp. 44-45; cf.

Theodor Reik, Otto Rank and C.G.Jung also refer at length to Schubert, especially the 'Symbolik des Traumes.' The internal connections between Schubert's and Freud's theories of dreams and language have already been described by Schott and will only be briefly out lined here.100 Freud refers directly to the concept of symbols and the theory of the origin of language in Schubert's work. He also agrees with Schubert in his basic understanding of the nature of dreams: Freud sees dreaming as essentially a coded language, a language of hieroglyphics, which he also compares with the Assyrian and Baby lonian civilisation. To Freud, the 'manifest content of a dream' is a 'rebus', a 'puzzle picture', in which the individual's inner nature, the unconscious, expresses itself. Where Schubert turns to the Nature surrounding us to analyse the symbolism of dreams, in order to decipher the hieroglyphic language of Nature, Freud uses his at first self-analytical method to listen inwards, in order to translate the suppressed thoughts and feelings of the unconscious into the conscious. Schubert's end aim in his attempts to 'decode the primal language' was to make a contribution to natural sci ence, whereas Freud, progressing along his path of self-discovery, wished to found a comprehensive human science centred on psy chology. In Schubert's thought, the confusion of language is the cause of all the misery of civilised man: the disconnection of everyday language or the language of reality from the language of feeling. The analogous concept in Freud is the notion of the original dream wish, which alters under the control of the internalised reality principle, 'dream censorship.' Behind this we can already see the first outlines of Freud's conflict theory emerging. Further analogies and connections can just be briefly men tioned. Chief of these are the concept Freud developed in his civilisation theory of the defusion of instincts and its effects on the 'process of civilisation', and the connection postulated in the sublimation theory between libido and the striving for knowledge, which follows the association of the drive to procreation and to knowledge.101 100 H. Schott, Poet (footnote 65); cf. also H.F. Ellenberger (footnote 98), pp. 205-206. 101 See above, II.l., and footnote 64.</page><page sequence="24">140 V. ROELCKE Conclusion To summarise, it can be stated that there are a series of motifs and themes in Schubert's work, particularly in his 'Symbolik des Traums', which are also of central importance in the Jewish mystical tradition. The chief of these are the concept of God unfolding himself in Cre ation, and a theory of language which in all essentials agrees with that of the Kabbalists. Further, there is the topos of the increasing differ entiation of the sexes from a primal androgynous state. The specific provenance of these parallels from Jewish mysticism cannot be defi nitely proved with the material available, since each of these motifs or themes may be identified in one or even several other traditions of mysticism. But the specific combination of these topoi and a multi tude of historical lines of connection, primarily through the work of Schelling, Oetinger, and Saint-Martin support the hypothesis that Schubert was indirectly influenced by ideas from the Kabbalah. Prob ably he was only to a limited extent aware of the historical source of these ideas further back than the authors who transmitted them to him. There is a symbolic parallel to this in his 'Reise in das Morgen land' (Journey to the Orient) he undertook in 1836: On the road from Nazareth to Damascus, he bestows only a fleeting glance on the town Saphet, the centre of the Kabbalistic tradition in Israel, and then loses himself in an extended description of the surrounding landscape.102 102 Gotthilf Heinrich Schubert, Reise in das Morgenland in den Jahren 1836 und 1837, 3 vis., Erlan gen: 1838/1839, III, pp. 254-255.</page></plain_text>
