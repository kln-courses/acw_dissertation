PENTCHEVA Stanford University Abstract Focusing on the sixth-century interior of the church of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople , this article explores the way marble and gold appear and their psychological effect on the spectator as recorded in Byzantine ekphrasis and liturgical texts. In turn, this optical shimmer, in Greek, marmarygma, is linked to the acoustic properties of marble, especially its capacity to reflect sound waves. The meaning of the optical and acoustic reflection is related to the Eucharistie rite and, more specifically, to the concept of animation, empsychosis. The exploration of acoustics is further deepened by the use of the sound of exploding balloons and modern digital technology to measure the reverberation time of the interior and to gener- ate with its aid computer auralizations of Byzantine chant, re- corded anechoically (with minimal room acoustics). Combining literary analysis, philological inquiry, and scientific research, this study uncovers the multisensory aesthetics of Hagia Sophia and recuperates the notion of aural architecture. Certain materials and artistic choices went into the making of the sixth-century church of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople to produce a particular aesthetic appearance (Fig. 1). Although no Byzantine texts recorded these aesthetic intentions, this lacuna in the evidence does not mean that no aesthetic pro- gram underlay the conceptualization of Hagia Sophia. Rather, an examination of medieval ekphrasis discloses the intent of this artistic production: how the interior looked physically and how it was perceived subjectively. In this paper, I shall draw on ekphrastic texts to extract the aesthetic terms of the artistic conceptualization of the building by specific Byzantine authors and their audiences and to retrieve the sensual and religious effects of its interior on the contemporary beholder. Recent studies have begun to reveal the performative nature of Byzantine art and how its meaning is created when light and shadow trigger the polymorphy of its surfaces, and when the beholder perceives these exterior changes as anima- tion ( empsychosis ), projecting his or her own sensual expe- rience ipathema) on the object.1 Aesthetic phenomenology, with its focus on the way an object appears and the effect this produces on the spectator, offers a new direction of analysis.2 Moving away from treating the image as static and monolithic, this alternative approach uncovers and explores the polymor- phic and its impact on the human imagination. A contemporary artwork will serve as an example of the issues engaged by aesthetic phenomenology. James Turrell's piece of sculpture/ architecture Space That Sees (1992) is a room without a ceil- ing, in which the sky appears like a framed painting.3 When clouds pass by or birds fly overhead, they animate the interior and make it perform a "representation" of the sky*in front of the viewer that is phenomenal, not pictorial. The object-space thus functions as an imagistic engine, using variable natural phenomena to produce images, while simultaneously stimu- lating the viewer's imagination. In effect, Hagia Sophia offers a similar performative paradigm: the shimmering surfaces of marble and gold become animate in the shifting natural light, and these transient manifestations trigger the spectator's mem- ory and imagination to conjure up images. Byzantine ekphra- sis both documents and sustains this interaction between the real, the perceived, and the imagined. Along with the opti- cal aspect, the vast interior of Hagia Sophia revetted in mar- ble and gold also has an aural dimension in that it produces extremely reverberant acoustics. Rather than keeping the anal- ysis of visual characteristics separate from sonic properties, this study will reunite them, thereby recuperating the idea of aural architecture. In part literary analysis, philological inquiry, and scien- tific work, this essay focuses on the psychology of response, especially on the effect polymorphy has on the viewer and how it was culturally and religiously conditioned.4 More precisely, the goal of this article is to recover the interior art and architec- ture of Hagia Sophia as experienced by the visitor in the sixth century. Although a few scholars, such as Liz James, Nadine Schibille, and Nicoletta Isar have anticipated some aspects of my approach, this is the first work to investigate the original phenomenological operations of the interior of Hagia Sophia as an integrated whole, in which sight and sound work together.5 It relies on examination of the primary sources that include the well-known ekphrasis of Hagia Sophia by Paul the Silentiary to argue that the structure was designed for reverberation. To support and substantiate my intuition that Hagia Sophia was designed to afford the worshiper a multisensory aesthetic expe- rience, I tie aesthetics, etymology, and liturgy into a single interpretation, which is thoroughly documented in the notes.6 Since poetry targets the imagination, and the polymorphic sur- faces of marble and gold similarly stir the imagistic capacity of the human brain, I purposefully employ poetic language as a way of reconstituting what I think was an interior of shifting GESTA 50/2 © The International Center of Medieval Art 201 1 93</page><page sequence="2">FIGURE 1.

For the most part, the scholarly analysis of architecture regards buildings as static entities. Yet an interior of marble and gold creates an environment of shimmer and reflection, and to do it justice, one needs to employ a dynamic medium.7 In a radical move, I have resorted to film as a way of recording how the marble and gold changed at such moments of transition as sunrise and sunset.8 The time selected is important because Hagia Sophia's interior was meant to be experienced during the Eucharistie liturgy, which coincided with the Byzantine third hour of the day (approximately between sunrise and mid-morn- ing). Yet, because today Hagia Sophia functions as a museum (AyaSofya Mtizesi), visitors cannot enter before nine o'clock and are thus prevented from seeing the polymorphy caused by the rising sun. Again, my video is not a reconstruction of the sixth-century interior but a record of how light affects reflec- tive surfaces. It directs the attention of the modern viewer to the ephemeral, which lies at the core of Hagia Sophia's aesthetic. The use of film as a medium recording the process of changing appearances - the subject of aesthetic phenomenology - offers an alternative means for demonstrating the performative char- acter of medieval art. In similar deictic terms, I used as a soundtrack for the film Byzantine chant digitally imprinted with the room acoustics of Hagia Sophia. This computer model is built on the basis of acoustic data gathered in situ. However, this auralization (the process of imprinting recorded music with the acoustic parameters of a space) should not be taken as a reconstruc- tion of the sixth-century liturgy. Using computer technology makes the humanist suspicious, and rightly so. But let me define the parameters of my use of technology. I employ it to model how a voice unaccompanied by musical instruments sounds in Hagia Sophia based on the current physical conditions of the building.9 Just as the architectural historian records and studies the material remains of a building and then proposes a recon- struction, so, too, the acoustician approaches the same material evidence when offering an acoustic model. This auralization is valuable because it gives us the possibility of hearing a base- line acoustics for Hagia Sophia and overcoming a logistical impasse, because, as a secular space, AyaSofya Mtizesi does not allow music to be performed or recorded on-site. This merging of the humanities with exact sciences has been inspired by Deborah Howard and Laura Moretti' s Sound and Space in Renaissance Venice , a pioneering study of aural architecture and polyphony in Counter-Reformation Venice. 10 The book presents acoustic measurements of twelve Venetian churches gathered in 2006, the in situ recording of St. John's College Choir, Cambridge, in April 2007, and the gather- ing of subjective responses of the audience and choristers to the acoustics of these interiors. Combining musicology with architectural history, archival work, and modern technology, the authors put forward the first systematic study correlating qualitative (subjective) with quantitative (objective) acoustic measurements. Embracing Howard and Moretti' s methodol- ogy, my project similarly merges art historical analysis with research in acoustics and audio recording. It employs visual, textual, and musicological evidence, video, the popping of bal- loons, the building of acoustic models, auralizations, and the recording of Byzantine chant. In exploring the concept of aural architecture, this article will suggest that Hagia Sophia consti- tutes an aesthetic totality - optical and acoustic - that reenacts in its architectural fiction the perceptual experience of polymor- phy linked in the Byzantine imagination to coruscating water. The aesthetic it maintains has a linguistic basis in the iterative Greek root marmar -, connecting marmaron (marble.), marmar- ygma (gleam, glitter), and marmairo (to quiver, sparkle). The onomatopoeic sound of these words and the image of quivering water that they elicit in the listener's imagination will become important in the subsequent analysis of polymorphy and rever- berance and their role in the Eucharistie ritual. The Linkage between Poetry and Aesthetics Paul the Silentiary wrote an ekphrasis of Hagia Sophia recited during the rededication ceremonies held between 24 December 562 and 6 January 563 in the imperial and patri- archal palaces.11 His poetry has been dismissed as a "flowery language" filled with "turgid archaisms," but it is important to remember that his aristocratic audience was capable of under- standing his classicizing style, which was based on Homeric vocabulary and written in hexameter (verses 136-1029) with two prologues in iambic trimeter (verses 1-80 and 8 1-1 35). 12 Paul builds his ekphrasis by using highly evocative images tied to the Eucharistie ritual. Modern scholars have noted the rich- ness of visual imagery in Late Antique literature and the promi- nent role ekphrasis played in it.13 Paul describes the materials and surfaces of Hagia Sophia as unstable and shifting in appearance. When he focuses, for instance, on the marble of the banister {solea), he calls this particular stone aiolomorphos , meaning "changing shape and appearances."14 He defines its color through a series of meta- phors that bring to mind a variety of natural elements and textures: . . . and having an aiolomorphon nature it displays a vari- ety (poikilletai ) in respect to shining (aigle). ... in parts it is seen ruddy ( ereuthos ) mingled with pallor (&lt; ochro ), or the fair brightness (selas) of human fingernails; in other places the brilliance turns into a soft wooly whiteness (argennon), gently staying or imitating the beauty /sheen (charin) of yellow boxwood (pyxou) or the semblance of beeswax which men wash in clear mountain streams and lay out to dry under the sun's rays; it turns silver- shining ( argyphon ), yet not completely altering its color, still showing traces of gold.15 95</page><page sequence="4">The poetry strings together metaphors, connecting the chame- leonic appearance of the stone to the color of dawn, the pallor of death, fingernails, yellow boxwood, and beeswax. In particu- lar, Paul mixes opposites: ereuthos (ruddy) with ochros (sul- len, lifeless).16 Similarly, wax is malleable and polymorphic; it can be dry, warm, wet, and cold and still remain wax. Washed in the mountain stream, the wax displays the sheen of silver, while retaining specks of gold. The trope of aporia lurks in this profusion of metaphors, yet a similar contrast and opposition are offered by the actual marble in Hagia Sophia. The verses envelop the spectator-hearer in a whirl of dualities of sense perceptions: hard and soft, solid and liquid, wet and dry. Antith- esis and synkresis alternate in this string of paraded images. Another feature of the poetry is the effort to capture evanes- cence, a surface that is translucent and reflective at the same time, shimmering and polychromatic. The language takes on the very character of the phenomenon it describes: it changes in order to depict a polychromatic stone with shifting appear- ances caused by light. The terms polymorphy , variety , and shimmer (poikillo , aigle) point to major aesthetic principles that actually guided the composition of Late Antique literature. Focusing on Latin texts and the tradition of rhetoric as recorded in the progym- nasmata (manuals for the study of rhetoric), Michael Roberts shows that Late Antique poetry exhibits a marked preference for variation ( varietas in Latin, poikilia in Greek), repetition, chiastic structuring, and jewel effects. Of these, variation is fundamental, leading to the increasing conception of poetry as an imaging text, and this process of visualization concentrates more specifically on the instability and mutability of color.17 The pairing of variation with the effects of light leads Roberts to coin the expression "jeweled style."18 This definition of Latin poetry could easily be applied to the Greek ekphrasis of Paul. In fact, Gianfranco Agosti reaches many of the same conclusions in his analysis of sixth-century Classicism in Greek poetry.19 Moreover, the jewel effects frequently tap into perceptual experiences. As developed by Stoic epistemology, ekphrasis activates through vivid language ( enargeia ) mental images ( phantasiai ), which are imprints on the soul of sense appre- hension.20 The phantasiai resurrected by the speaker create in the listener a simulacrum of perception itself, and this pro- cess is a perceptual mimesis, as Ruth Webb observes: "it is the act of seeing that is imitated, not the object itself."21 Given its reliance on perceptual mimesis, can the ekphrasis serve as a reliable record for a historical moment of aesthetics or aes- thetic experience, or phenomenology? In the past, ekphrasis was sometimes used by twentieth-century art historians in an archaeological/literal way, to mine the text for evidence about the shape of an object or building.22 Recent scholarship, for its part, looks at ekphrasis as a literary style recording a move from the sensible-material characteristics of the object to the intel- ligible-imaginary realm.23 Christian ekphrasis, a field that has only recently attracted scholarly attention, by contrast, targets the spiritual operations, which are activated by the symbiosis FIGURE 2. Hagia Sophia, 532-37 and 562, view of the Proconnesian floor and south aisle (© Bissera V. Pentcheva). of material structure and ritual.24 Gregory of Nyssa, in his hom- ily of St. Theodore the Recruit (which includes an ekphrasis of the martyrium), states: "Therefore, on the basis of what we can perceive, we believe in invisible things and because of what we experience in the world, we believe in the promise of future things."25 This patristic statement attests to a formulation of mystical experience linking perceptual apprehension with the spiritual. For this reason, I take the scholarly position that ekphrasis of a church building does not function only intertex- tually, activating a literary tradition, but also integrates a direct response to the sensual materiality of the space and uncov- ers in it a metaphysical dimension.26 And since this particular church was sheathed in marble and gold, in analyzing Paul's ekphrasis, I will focus on how glitter, which is linguistically embedded in the root marmar- (as in marmaron , marmarygma , amarygma , and marmairo ), structures the spiritual operations of Hagia Sophia.27 Transitive Terms: Marmaron, Marmara, Marmarygma, and Marmairo Of great significance for this study is the way in which marmarygma is connected to marmaron (marble), the Sea of Marmara, and the image of coruscating water (marmairo). The marble floor of Hagia Sophia is composed of gray Proconnesian marble, quarried on the island of Proconnesus in the Sea of Marmara, and is divided by four bands of green stone, which were interpreted in the past as the rivers of paradise (Figs. 2 and 3).28 The gray stone is book-matched, meaning the plaques are cut across the veins and arranged in pairs whose pattern creates a continuous wavelike design (Fig. 4). According to ancient geology (Theophrastus, De lapidibus [ca. 315-305 все], fol- lowing Aristotle's Meteorologia , Book 3), marble was thought to be composed of earth particles percolated in water and then solidified into stone by dry exhalations from the depths of the earth.29 The association between marble and water grew in the 96</page><page sequence="5">FIGURE 3. Hagia Sophia, 532-37 and 562, reconstruction of the marble floor seen from above (©Lars Grobe, Oliver Hauck, Andreas Noback, Rudolf H. W. Stichel, Helge Svenshon, Technische Universität Darmstadt ). Late Antique period, and this linkage acquired a greater visual prominence, forming a new aesthetic standard when the dove gray Proconnesian stone replaced the green Carystian marble formerly dominant in the interiors of Roman bathhouses and other public buildings.30 The wave pattern and luminosity of the Proconnesus stone stimulated viewers to conjure up in their imaginations the image of the sea. Moreover, the proximity of the quarries to the capital also encouraged this preference for Proconnesian marble in Constantinople.31 While continu- ing this line of research on the cultural perception of marble, my emphasis falls on how the Proconnesian slabs generate the experience of movement and temporality. When describing the floor of Hagia Sophia, Paul seeks out and dwells on changing appearances: The peak of Proconnesus soothingly spreading over the entire pavement / has gladly given its back to the life- giving ruler [Christ /the emperor], / the radiance of the Bosphorus softly ruffling / transmutes from the deepest darkness of swollen waters ( akrokelainiontos ) to the soft whiteness (argennoio) of radiant metal ( metallou ).32 Paul attributes animacy to the island of Proconnesus, willingly spreading its back for the emperor and Christ. Its stone, cut into slabs, forms the floor of the Great Church. Its polished surfaces resemble the radiance given off by the softly ruffling Bosphorus. Here the poet uses the onomatopoeic phrisousa , a word containing the sound of the wind. An animate, as opposed to static, image emerges in the poetry, based on the memory of FIGURE 4. Hagia Sophia, 532-37 and 562, sunlight glistening on the Procon- nesian marble floor (© Bissera V. Pentcheva). coruscating water. Its shimmering surface is in constant flux, continually changing its shape. The next line of the poem inten- sifies this spectacle of shifting, chameleonic appearances; the radiance changes from the deepest darkness of gushing, swollen waters (i akrokelainos ) into the soft whiteness of warm sheep's wool (&lt; argennos ), shining with the radiance of metal (&lt; metallon ). The verse aptly renders the effects of polymorphy, or poikilia .33 In Paul's ekphrasis, marble acquires the varying appearance of water, transmuting into wool, then into metal. The words evoke an alchemical process, in which stone liquefies into water and molten metal. 97</page><page sequence="6">FIGURE 5. Hagia Sophia, 532-37 and 562, north aisle, sunlight gilding the Proconnesian marble floor (© Bissera V. Pentcheva). As he calls up the image of the Bosphorus, Paul encour- ages his audience to dwell on movement and change: water ruf- fled by winds, light transforming the surface into liquid metal. To an extent, this polymorphy of the Proconnesian marble is still observable today. At dawn the stone glows with the luster of mother-of-pearl that recalls the opalescence of the Bospho- rus at certain times of the day (Figs. 5-7). So far, this kinetic aspect of the perceptual images evoked in Late Antique poetry has not been discussed in the scholarship. Poikilia , fragmen- tation, miniaturization, and the jeweled style have been high- lighted instead.34 1 would like to add to them the concept of marmar -, which issues from the image of running or quiver- ing water and conveys the liquescent, fugitive, and ephemeral in Hagia Sophia. Paul recognizes the polymorphic nature of marble not only in its polychromacity but also in the way its surfaces interact with light. He is attracted to this change and sees a link between it and the image of quivering water. These verses following his description of the Proconnesian floor will prove the point: The ceiling encompassing gold-inlaid tesserae, / whose pouring down ( chyden ) in glittering ( marmairousa ) gold- streaming (chry sorry tos) ray ( aktis ) / irresistibly bounces off the faces of the faithful.35 The lines bespeak the metamorphosis of solid metal into a river of shimmering gold gliding across reflective marble (Figs. 5, 6, and 8). The flow ( chyde ) of the fluid gold {chry sorry tos) ray (aktis) liquefies the ceiling as its shimmer bounces off the faces of the faithful (Figs. 9 and 10). 36 Natural light has an animating effect on the interior. At dawn, I have found, the first rays cause the marble revetments to acquire relief (Fig. 6). Similarly, when sunlight falls on the tessellated Proconnesian frames, it transforms them into gilded streams, thus unifying the gold mosaic with the marble (Figs. 5, 6, 8, and 9). This perceptual merging of gold and marble is linguistically enabled FIGURE 6. Hagia Sophia, 532-37 and 562, north aisle, sunlight glistening on the marble revetment (© Bissera V. Pentcheva). FIGURE 7. A view of the Bosphorus in the morning on 6 December 2010 (© Bissera V. Pentcheva ). by the word marmairo (to sparkle, quiver), as the verb again conjures up the image of scintillating water. The shimmer of gold is seen through the metaphor of water. Marmairo forms a near-phonetic pair with marmaron , marmaryge , and marmar- ygma (sparkle), thereby linking these materials and phenomena aurally into one transmuting visual entity. The Linkage of Marmarygma and Charis: Animation as Empsychosis The iterative marmar- presents the perceived transforma- tion of different materials - light, metal, and stone - into water, and it is this image of water that offers a kinetic dimension to Paul's imagined world. Similarly, in conveying movement, the iterative marmar- foregrounds the process that causes inert things to become alive ( empsychos ). We can detect how the concept of liveliness operates by analyzing Paul's most memo- rable evocation of surging water in his ekphrasis of the ambo 98 Figures 6 and 7 also appear in the color plates between pp. 162 and 163 of this issue.</page><page sequence="7">FIGURE 8.

Hagia Sophia, 532-37 and 562, Justinianic gold glass mosaic in the vaulting of the inner narthex (© Bissera V. Pentcheva ). and solea. The power of this scene stems from the merging of perceptual memories with a recollection of the liturgical rite: And as an island rises amid the waves of the sea . . . , so in the midst of the boundless temple rises upright the tower-like ambo of stone. . . . Here the priest who brings the good tidings passes along on his return from the ambo, holding aloft the golden book; and while the crowd strives in honor of the immaculate God to touch the sacred book with their lips and hands, the countless waves of the surging people break around.37 Paul the Silentiary describes the ambo through the metaphor of an island washed by the sea. He expands on this figure of speech by comparing the congregation's pushing forward to reach the Gospel book to that of surging waves. The metaphoric language shifts between the man-made interior and nature out- side: floor becomes sea; the pulpit, island; the people, waves. FIGURE 9. Hagia Sophia, 532-37 and 562, sunlight in a tympanum in the south aisle makes the gold mosaic shimmer (© Bissera V. Pentcheva ). Animate and inanimate transform into each other. Anthropolo- gists have observed how combining the memory of sensual perception with that of ritual stimulates the most vivid imag- inings.38 This is exactly the combination put forward by Paul. The religious zeal and physical energy expended in trying to touch the Gospel book become subsumed in his poetry by the image of breaking waves. His ekphrasis seeks to express dyna- mism and the life that bursts forth and imbues the inert with movement: the kymata (waves) of kinymenon demon (moving people). Just like marinaron , marmarygma , and marmairo , the near-phonetic pair of kyma and kinymai strengthens the power of the metaphor and intensifies the intertwining of animate and inanimate. This phenomenon resembles Alfred Gell' s concept of interdigitation, when the subject projects his animacy on the object and thus experiences the latter as alive.39 The image of the breaking waves conveys the process of inspiriting matter, which in turn evokes the Eucharist, a model that his audience understood well. For the Eucharist, in essence, enacts the imparting of spirit into matter, transform- ing bread and wine into flesh and blood.40 Pneuma (the Holy Spirit) causes this transformation when it descends in the scent of burning incense over the gifts. In employing terms such as marmairo and marmarygma and kyma and kinymai , Paul com- pels his spectators-hearers to recognize in the changing appear- ances of marble and gold the presence of vivifying force - the Holy Spirit. The movement of the waves and the quiver of glittering gold mosaic reflected from the marble floor create an image of a world in flux. To this dynamic of molten metal and sparkling water, Paul adds the image of woods and lush meadows in spring that the marble columns of the naos and the revetments represent, and he seeks in them the manifestation of empsycho- sis linking glitter with charis (Fig. 11): In turn four columns firmly resting on the ground lift [the six columns of the gallery] by unshaken force, / with Figure 10 also appear in the color plates between pp. 162 and 163, and parts of Figure 9 form the background for the cover. 99</page><page sequence="8">gilded capitals they stand effusing grace (charitessi) / in the shimmer ( amarygmata ) of Thessalian marble. / They separate the airy central performance stage ( kallichoroio ) of the temple under the dome / along the length of the neighboring aisles. / Never in the land of the Molossians did they cut such columns, high-crested, full of grace (i charientas ), blooming ( tethelotas ) in the color harmony of variegated ( daidaleoisi ) forests and flowers.41 The four Thessalian marble columns appear as trees firmly rooted in the ground. Their gilded capitals please the eye with beauty ( charitessi ) and shimmer ( amarygma ). While charis suggests beauty and grace, it also evokes the memory of the Eucharist with its concomitant descent of pneuma.42 The glitter of the gilded acanthus in the spandrels stimulates the viewer to see them as animate, and, similarly, the shafts of the columns are filled with energy, perceived in the gleam (amarygma). Speckled with green, gray, and white, the Thessalian columns suggest the perceptual mimesis of polychromatic forests and flowers ( als e si kai anthesi). In Greek, "flower" also designates "color." Consequently, the image of a meadow of flowers is juxtaposed to the dynamic contrast of the shadowy forest; this antithesis has a kinetic dimension.43 Daidalos , meaning "com- plex" or "variegated," expresses this dynamic multitonality and luster. The colored marble of the columns does not offer an abstract depiction of landscape. Instead, the juxtaposition of shimmer and luminosity stirs the perceptual memory of brightness and shadow: the amarygma (sheen) of marmaron infused with the charis (grace, beauty) of gold. Roberts, who analyzed this principle of contrast and juxtaposition in Late Antique poetry, also characterizes this literature as a meadow in spring.44 His definition is fully justified when we look at Paul the Silentiary's ekphrasis of the marble revetments. His poetry uses marble to construct an image of a landscape filled with contrasting colors. Paul's poetry is not alone in intensifying the imagery; the material production itself becomes more lavish in this period. Marble revetments originated in Hellenistic architecture and became prominent in Late Roman Republican buildings, and the trend continued during the Imperial age. With Constantine, marble revetments entered the vocabulary of church architec- ture.45 What makes Hagia Sophia exceptional is the quantity and rich variety of marble used for its interior. Paul engages the perceptual properties of these revetments: And all the precious [stone] that sprung from Onyx / gleaming with the radiance of gold tesserae ( metallo ) / and that which the land of Atrax produces / in the smooth plains, not the highlands, / in part with the intense green of spring ( chloaonta ) not unlike emerald, / in part from the deep green ( bathymenou chloerou) appearing almost blue in form ( kyanopidi morphei ); / just like the juxta- position of snow next to the shimmer ( marmaryges ) of black: / an intertwined charis has risen from the stone.46 FIGURE 11. Hagia Sophia, 532-37 and 562, naos and south aisle (© Vanni / Art Resource, NY). The way onyx looks is compared to the radiance of gold tes- serae (me talion), while the face of the stone from Atrax alter- nates between the sheen of spring green and a deep green almost resembling dark blue. These lines capture the cultur- ally specific color perception of Byzantium. Rather than hue, color words stress brightness and saturation.47 Once again, an intense contrast is sought between the light-reflective and the light-absorptive properties of materials.48 The metamorphosis is phenomenal, triggered by ambient changes. The shifts and contrasts express a larger concept, that of the presence of spirit in matter: "an intertwined charis has risen from the stone." Glitter has a long tradition in Greek literature. Homer uses marmairo and marmaryge for the sea and the sparkling appear- ance of metal armor.49 Nonnos of Panoplis in the early fifth century triples the use of marmairo and marmaryge , writing about light, metal, and the gifts of the sea. Most frequently, however, he uses the terms to capture the sparkle of the eyes, showing how glitter becomes a marker of the soul and thus an outer expression of liveliness.50 Nonnos offers a bridge between Homer and Paul, explaining the metaphysical turn in the per- ception of glitter: marmarygma marks the animation of matter. Rather than naturalistic figurations, the marble floor and walls 100 Figure 11 also appears in the color plates between pp. 162 and 163 of this issue.</page><page sequence="9">as well as the gold mosaic perform through their polymorphy the presence of pneuma in matter.51 In an influential article on the marbles of Hagia Sophia, John Onians has argued that the Late Antique viewer, trained in the culture of ekphrasis and encomium (praise), was capable of discovering naturalistic images in increasingly abstract visual representations.52 Onians credits the increased role of ekphra- sis for this development of imagistic capabilities that allowed viewers to conjure up naturalistic anthropomorphic forms from the abstract figuration of veined marble. He explains: "the imaginative response of the spectator created a new imagina- tive activity in the artist. The same is even truer of the rela- tionship between the modern artist and his public, with both exploring the frontier of imaginative alertness. Now, as then, the real measure of that alertness is the capacity to see repre- sentational reference in what is essentially abstract."53 Link- ing medieval abstraction to modern art, Onians believes that ekphrasis helped viewers to imagine pictorial representation in the marble slabs. I would like to propose an alternative interpretation. Abstraction in modern art is characterized by a desire to break away from naturalistic representation. This concept does not apply to nonfigurative medieval art. Rather than using the imagination to see representation in what is abstract, the medi- eval viewer wanted to see the presence of the spirit in what is essentially changing appearances of matter such as glitter or shadow (Figs. 4-6, 8-10).54 As Gregory of Nyssa stated, sense perception is a means of reaching the spiritual.55 Hagia Sophia's interior presents a synergy between two forces that produce the effect of animation: first, the imaging power of such forms and materials as columns and wave-pattern book-matched marble slabs; and, second, the phenomenal polymorphy of these sur- faces. Faced with both, the viewer simultaneously could conjure images of quivering water based on his/her perceptual experi- ence and tie them to the concepts of charts and empsychosis. Georges Didi-Huberman's interpretation of the fictive marbles painted by Fra Angelico in S. Marco, Florence, may be put in parallel with our study. Indeed, his approach high- lights the capacity of nonanthropomorphic figuration to trigger mental images.56 What distinguishes my analysis of marble from Didi-Huberman's is the recognition of the role of such natural phenomena as shimmer that trigger observers to view the inanimate as animate. Materiality, in the Byzantine model, has the potential under certain conditions to be perceived as alive. In using reflective materials such as gold and marble, the interior of Hagia Sophia acts like an iridescent shell; sun rays, shadows, and drafts of air moving across its surfaces acti- vate or cancel the display of marmarygma. The temporality of these phenomenal shimmers and moving shadows conveys the ephemeral descent of pneuma , or, to use Paul the Silentiary's words, a charts emanating from the stone.57 Byzantine anima- tion is performative and objectively nonrepresentational; it is steeped in a material production that uses reflective and trans- lucent surfaces and in the spectacle of ekphrasis and liturgy. The Sound of Marmaron; The Scientific Study of Hagia Sophia's Acoustics The optical marmarygma issuing from the marble also has an acoustic correlate. Marble reflects most of the energy of sound waves hitting it back into the surrounding space. This phenomenon together with the immense volume of Hagia Sophia result in extremely reverberant acoustics.58 What fol- lows is an excursus in the scientific study of sound in Hagia Sophia, revealing what methods and computer technologies have been used and how the results could be integrated into the larger study of aesthetics. The experience of listening to sound is as much a function of what the source emits as it is about the space in wfiich sound propagates. When a sound is made by a source in a room, an acoustic wave is produced, which propagates in all directions. The sound first heard at the listener's position is called the "direct sound." As other portions of the propagating wave front interact with obstacles along the way, some of their energy is absorbed by those obstacles and some is reflected back into the space. This reflected energy reaches the listener's posi- tion slightly later, and these delayed arrivals are called "early reflections." As the sound reflections continue to be reflected by the surfaces and obstacles in the room, their staggered arrivals create the "late field reverberation." The sound will continue to be reflected until all the energy is absorbed by the air and the objects in and boundaries of the space. The staggered arrivals and different energies of the direct sound, the early, and the late field reverberations enable the listener to perceive the imprint of space on sound. This imprint is called the "Impulse Response" (IR), and the process of imprinting a space on a sound is called "convolution" or "auralization."59 Both technical terms, IR and auralization, will feature widely in my discussion. The spatial imprint on sound indicates an important psy- chological dimension of aural architecture, more specifically, that a piece of music can have varying effects on the listener depending on the space in which it is performed.60 This is the case with Hagia Sophia and Byzantine chant. The huge marble- revetted interior is reverberant and quickly mixes the reflected sound energy, especially at the wavelengths in the range of the human voice; it stays full and well mixed for the long reverber- ation time of about ten seconds. The chanting, which triggers this aural experience, uses the human body as an instrument, thus further implicating the corporeal experience of architecture and the synergy and interaction between the faithful and the mass of reflective marmaron. Studies of the acoustics of Hagia Sophia began in 2003, when the Danish group of Christoffer Weitze, Jens Rindel, Claus Christensen, and Anders Gade, using three sound sources and twelve receivers, measured a standard reverberation time (RT30)61 in Hagia Sophia at about ten seconds for a sound source in the apse, and slightly more than eleven seconds for a sound source in the space under the dome when the church is empty.62 The long reverberation time is a result of the immense interior,</page><page sequence="10">which is more than 70 meters in length and 55 meters in height, with a total volume of 255.800 m3, all enclosed in reflective surfaces of marble and gold mosaic.63 This long reverberation time remains uniform across a vast spectrum of frequencies in the range of the singing human voice, from 200 Hz-4,000 Hz (Hz=Hertz, a unit of frequency equal to one cycle per second).64 In comparison with modern concert halls, whose reverberation time is often less than two seconds, Hagia Sophia's exhibits a particularly long resonance.65 The Danish research revealed that the dome and conches, because of their parabolic surfaces, reflect high-frequency waves and focus sound directly down to the space under the dome.66 The current cupola, dating to 562, has a steeper apex, so the focus is higher above the floor. By contrast, the original flat dome of 537 would have lowered this focus, better project- ing the reflections back to the people gathered underneath it. Clarity and intelligibility of speech are poor overall, even in the space under the dome.67 The Danish group then placed the measured acoustic data in a computer model created by the software Odeon® developed by Rindel and Christensen to pro- duce predictive room acoustics. Together with the musicolo- gist Christian Troelsgaard, the engineers offered auralizations of Byzantine chant and Qur'anic readings.68 Although they measured sound on-site, they used a computer model gener- ated by Odeon® to convolve studio recording of music with the acoustic parameters of Hagia Sophia ("to convolve" or "to auralize" denotes the process of imprinting a space on a recorded sound). Stanford University' s " Icons of Sound" Project and Cappella Romana The Danish project inspired me to seek a collaboration with Jonathan Abel, a consulting professor at Stanford's Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics, because I was interested in the phenomenological aspects of sound, more spe- cifically, in the difference between the experience of a melody recorded with minimal room acoustics versus one imprinted with the resonant matrix of Hagia Sophia. What could be the psychoacoustic response to the reverberant as opposed to the anechoic sounds? To experiment with imprinting room acous- tics on recorded music (auralization), one needs to measure the Impulse Response of Hagia Sophia. And because the Danish group did not publish an IR, we had to obtain one by gathering acoustic data in situ. Abel developed a new method of measuring and reproduc- ing room acoustics by recording the sounds of balloons pop- ping. Balloons are inexpensive and easy to use. When they explode, they produce a simple but compact acoustic pulse, which radiates rather uniformly and contains the entire fre- quency range of human hearing. Knowing how a space imprints itself on a simple pulse enables us to study and reproduce more complex processes such as human speech or singing, which may be thought of as being composed of a series of pulses. In May and December 2010, we recorded four balloons popping in Hagia Sophia with the balloon under the dome and the listener both under the cupola and in the west end. The information from one of the resulting wave forms is plotted as a spectrogram image on the axes of time and frequency, with color (grays in the black-and-white figure) representing the intensity of sound (Fig. 12). Several reflections likely came from the dome and are visible in the background of diffuse arrivals, which in turn probably came from the colonnades. Over time, the acoustic energy in the space became well mixed, and the response took on a smooth, noiselike character as the balloon's energy slowly decayed. A second graph presents the impulse response as a wave form (Fig. 13).69 The spectrogram shows the ten- second reverberation as a function of frequency on a logarithmic, nonlinear time axis, because the logarithmic corresponds to human perception (Fig. 14).70 The curve rises and plateaus at a ten-second reverberation time for frequen- cies between 150 Hz and 1,000 Hz (the range of human speech and singing). This "hat" shape is an acoustic feature displayed by some of the best concerts halls today, whose interiors, too, sustain the longest reverberation for the mid-frequencies.71 Yet, in contrast to the modern concert hall, clarity in Hagia Sophia is poor for listeners positioned away from the source, and the reverberation can overwhelm the direct sound, render- ing speech unintelligible.72 Abel then used the Impulse Response of Hagia Sophia to convolve an existing recording of the Cheroubikon with Hagia Sophia's late field reverberation.73 In the process, he devel- oped a new method of convolving anechoic performance with an Impulse Response derived directly from in situ balloon- pop measurements.74 As a result, the new auralizations are based on the sound pulse recorded in Hagia Sophia, and not entirely synthesized using a computer software (like Odeon® or CATT®) that assigns relative values to materials and archi- tectural shapes. Subsequently, Abel and I collaborated with Cappella Romana, a choir specializing in early music, and recorded their performance of Romanos Melodos' First Kontakion on the Nativity, the Prokeimenon of St. Basil, and Psalm 140. In this way we produced new anechoic recordings, which we con- volved with the Impulse Response of Hagia Sophia. During the recording session, the voice of each singer was captured on a separate track, dry (with minimal room acoustics imprinted on the recorded sound). Each chorister received live feedback via earphones, auralizing his or her performance in Hagia Sophia. This real-time experience enabled the singers to hear them- selves sing in the Great Church during the recording session, as opposed to an effect introduced during postproduction.75 This new approach helped the singers interact live with the immense interior of marmaron and align their pitch with the maximum resonance of the building. As a result, they dramatically slowed their tempo. Abel's use of simultaneous auralization marks a departure from the traditional method and offers a potential for future studies in psychoacoustics.76 102</page><page sequence="11">FIGURE 12.

He then recorded the same chanter anechoically in a studio and convolved this recording with the measured Impulse Response. The auralization was found to be sonically very similar to the recorded live performance in Memorial Church. A comparison of two spectrograms from the anechoic recording and the Hagia Sophia auralization clearly demon- strates the resonant acoustics of the Great Church (Figs. 15 and 16). Both graph the first few seconds of the soloist, John Boyer, and Cappella Romana performing a Prokeimenon , or gradual for the feast of St. Basil. In the dry performance, one could clearly see how the soloist's voice peaks at about 200 Hz, triggering harmonics ranging between 300 and 5,000 Hz. The drone ( ison ) hovers around 100 Hz, with harmonics reaching to 2,000 Hz and above (Fig. 15). When the same performance is auralized in Hagia Sophia (reproducing the acoustics for the empty interior), it is enhanced and enriched, with the acoustic energy lingering and harmonized with the new notes produced in the space (Fig. 16). The spectrogram shows how the rever- berant acoustics of Hagia Sophia bring about a smoothing effect and flesh out the fullness of sound. Since the scientific study of Hagia Sophia reveals its reso- nant acoustics, it is important to ask if reverberation was a Figure 12 also appears in color on the front cover and in the color plates between pp. 162 and 163 of this issue. ЮЗ</page><page sequence="12">design consideration for the architects Anthemius of Tralles and Isidorus of Miletus or a by-product of an architectural tradi- tion using large quantities of marble and many, domes and semi- domes. This question is impossible to answer because of the lack of written evidence.77 The sixth-century Byzantine sources describe the two designers of Hagia Sophia as mechanikoi or mechanopoioi (engineers). Anthemius was a mathematician with an interest in conic structures, ellipses, and mirrors. Since reverberation is about reflected acoustic energy, it is plausible that Anthemius' interest in mirrors contributed to the design of a reverberant interior. Similarly, Isidorus, a professor of geom- etry and mechanics who edited mathematical texts and wrote treatises, was concerned with inscribing solids in other solid shapes, vaulting, and the design of a special compass for the drawing of parabolas.78 The plan and orientation of the build- ing and the shape of the dome demonstrate exact knowledge of ancient science.79 The nave of Hagia Sophia takes the form of a solid enclosed within a solid. The same paradigm is man- ifested in the smaller-scale precedents of the church SS. Ser- gius and Bacchus (527-32) and the concurrent church of St. Irene (532-37). 80 These structures suggest a trend to develop a space free of columns at the center but enclosed in an ambula- tory.81 Such an interior will create diffused reflections, suffusing unpleasant echo. Did the sixth-century visitor recognize the reverber- ant acoustics of Hagia Sophia? This question also cannot be answered because of the lack of direct textual evidence. Yet the concepts of a powerful reverberant voice hovering over a soundscape of marble is present in Paul the Silenti ary' s ekphrasis: "Who would sing with thundering voices the sounds of Homer, the marble meadows solidly assembled along the walls or the well-formed pavement of the hauntingly high naos?"82 Paul connects the perception of a thundering sound with Hagia Sophia's immense interior and marble revetments. His rhetorical question, "Who would sing," highlights the acoustic interaction between the human voice and material surfaces, imitating in this way the synergy between the viewer and optical marmarygma stirred by ambient light. Are Paul's words just intertextual tropes? Clearly they evoke Homer, the model Paul emulated in his hexameter form and the Odyssey travel structure. But what the verse also conjures is the vision of an aural architecture and a transcendent voice. The Embodiment : Singing , Breath , and Holy Spirit Reverberation time in the range of ten to eleven seconds is extremely long. Not only does it make recitative speech unintel- ligible, but it also affects singing by causing strong dissonant effects. The church full of people will be far less reverberant than the empty interior (in our computer auralizations), since the sounds will not reflect from the hard surface of the floor (Fig. 17). Similarly, some of the energy of sound waves will be consumed by the textiles of interior furnishings and the bod- ies and clothing of the spectators. When people moved, their clothing also produced the sound of rustling, whose acoustic dimension would have contributed to the overall aesthetic of marmar-. Through this synergy of body and space, the interior became a better instrument for the human voice, assisting the singing of simple monodie chant. Not surprisingly, such sing- ing defines the character of the Byzantine cathedral liturgy. The service, known as "the sung office," or asmatike akolou- thia , included antiphonal chanting of psalms with refrains and prayers, which reaches back to fourth-century practices in Jeru- salem and Antioch.83 It is also important to note that in the sixth century there was no daily celebration in Hagia Sophia; instead, services took place in this interior only at Saturday vespers and Sunday matins and on major feasts such as Christmas and Eas- ter.84 The two weekly services thus incorporated* the times of sunrise and sunset in their temporal dimension by celebrating the Eucharist in the third hour of the day, which coincides with light coming from the east and maximum marmarygma in the sanctuary, stimulating the faithful to link in their imagination physical light with the descent of the Holy Spirit.85 Reconstructing the sound of the asmatike akolouthia is a complex problem. The deciphering of musical notation only reaches back to the Middle Byzantine period. Thus, we do not have a written basis on which to reconstruct the sixth-century musical arrangement. What we do know, however, is that cho- ral refrains were chanted in the singing of the psalms86 and in the kontakion , or sung sermon, which emerged in roughly the same period.87 Similarly, the new Cheroubikon hymn, sung dur- ing the Eucharist procession, might have involved the entire congregation.88 Once inside Hagia Sophia, a soloist known as a domestikos probably ascended the ambo to sing from there the opening and the refrain. The professional choir, psaltai , standing under the ambo and possibly the anagnostes (readers) positioned in the space between the sanctuary and the ambo then began to chant the psalm responsorially, meaning they were divided into two groups and sang in alternating fashion verse by verse.89 When one group chanted the poetic line, the other held the drone and vice versa. At the end of each verse, the congregation joined in with the refrain. The Cheroubikon hymn was a more complex production designed specifically for the Great Entrance of Hagia Sophia and officially incorporated in its liturgy in 573-74. 90 In the course of its singing, two corteges proceeded to meet: the clergy with the oblation from the west, and the emperor from the east.91 The performance of this hymn might have included the entire congregation.92 The Cheroubikon starts by explicitly recalling the previous visions of the divinity in Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Revelation: "We who mystically represent ( eikonizontes ) the cherubim and sing the thrice-holy hymn to the life-giving Trinity, let us lay aside all worldly care [Luke 21 :34] to receive the King of All escorted unseen by the angelic corps. Allelouia, allelouia, allelouia."93 The hymn asks the participants in the rite to imagine the actual ecclesiastical cortege as a host of angels, intertwining the terrestrial with a vision of heaven. The sung 104</page><page sequence="13">FIGURE 17. Hagia Sophia, reconstruction of the Justinianic liturgy unfolding in the interior (© Lars Grobe, Oliver Hauck, Martin Kim, Andreas Noback, Rudolf H. W. Stichel, Helge Svenshon, Technische Universität Darmstadt). text invites the participants to perceive their action in space as a "representation" ( eikonizontes ). But what is also clear is that its visual dimension is combined with an aural one. We might not have a historical record to reconstruct the sixth-century musical setting of this hymn, but we do know what the room acoustics of this interior are (measured for an empty interior devoid of liturgical furnishings and textiles). The vast naos ensures a long initial delay (the time between the arrival of the direct sound to the recorder-hearer and the arrival of early reflection), lowering the intimacy of sound and creating the mimetic effect of being lost in an immense container.94 The psychoacoustics of this distant, nonintimate kind of sound could be perceived in meta- physical terms. Since the hymn was originally composed for the Justinianic interior of Hagia Sophia, its text and its sound were imprinted by the optical and acoustic properties of this space. A Middle Byzantine commentary of the Cheroubikon states: "When the singers perform that hymn together with the people, it is signifying that also the angels sing together in the highest."95 In the act of performance, human bodies become "representations" of the angelic host. Just as the nonobjective figuration of the marble produced images in the imaginations of the spectators, or the phenomenal marmarygma of marble and gold was seen as a marker of animation, so, too, the reverber- ant sound produced by singing the Cheroubikon compelled its performers to perceive the totality of their bodies in space as icons, like marinaron, reflecting divine figuration. To grasp this process of perceived animation, it is impor- tant to explain the range of meanings of pneuma in Greek. The word signifies the "Holy Spirit," which is sensorially mani- fested in the scent and smoke of burning incense.96 Pneuma also denotes human breath and concomitantly human chant.97 Thus, the experience of indwelling spirit could be manifested optically, aurally, and olfactorily: pneuma as breeze, incense, smoke, and breath. Its multisensorial energy is activated in the Eucharistie liturgy through the burning of incense, the obla- tion procession, chanting, and, finally, the consumption of the bread and wine transformed into the body and blood of Christ. The reverberant acoustics of Hagia Sophia transform the human voice into an emanation, no longer focused on the intel- ligibility of words but on their sensual perception.98 The reflec- tive interior and its immense volume manipulate the spectator to experience the Logos (Word/Christ) in the bodiless voice of sound reflections. Only film studies have addressed this phe- nomenon, calling it the acousmêtre and defining it as the voice behind the screen with no face or body to be seen that could be taken as the source of the sound. The perception of acousmêtre in film has a menacing and threatening effect, which is due to the visual absence of the source.99 By contrast, the Byzantine acousmêtre as realized in Hagia Sophia is salvific and luminous, manifested as an acoustic and optical marmarygma. As bodies and clothing trap some of the sound waves, consuming their energy, the faithful corporeally partake in the acousmêtre .10° In 105</page><page sequence="14">this way , pneuma is perceived as reentering mortal flesh. Rather than threatening, the bodiless voice of Hagia Sophia offers a return to dwelling in the divine by the consumption and recov- ery of spirit. In this inspiriting/ empsychosis process, the faithful are transformed back into eikones tou theou : "icons of God" in the model of Adam. Whereas in Genesis 2:7 God breathes life into Adam, animating his inert flesh, in Hagia Sophia a reversal happens. Human breath emptied as chant becomes a reverber- ant sound perceived as a divine acousmêtre and consumed by bodies and clothing. Conclusion In exploring the way objects and spaces appear and the way they affect the spectator, phenomenology as a new method in art historical analysis has the potential to transform the field of medieval studies. It is especially applicable to Byzantine art, which exhibits an artistic tradition invested in polymorphy and an aesthetic response, recorded in epigrams and ekphrasis, showing the awareness of phenomenal light and shadow as a manifestation of animation. Poikilia and marmarygma are just two examples of the terms that structure Byzantine aesthetics. Seeing and hearing the shimmer of marmaron led the faithful to recognize the presence of pneuma in the exteriority of optical and aural reflections. It is also important to acknowledge that visual marmarygma is caused by an external factor, a ray of light from the sun or an oil lamp. By contrast, aural marmar- ygma is generated internally by the singer: breath exhaled by the mouth and sound energy partially consumed by the body and drapery. In this distinction between sight and hearing, we can detect a Byzantine hierarchy of the senses implied by Hagia Sophia's interior and ritual. The closer this gradation of sensual perception reaches to the spiritual, the more, paradoxically, it strives toward greater bodily investment. The faithful move from the mirror reflections of sight to the consumed energy of sound, to climax with the sweet taste of the body and blood of Christ at the Eucharist. Our modern scholarly discourse falls short of the intensity and complexity of this multisensory experience. Rfeaching out to film and computer auralization has enabled me to mobi- lize new media to convey aspects of Hagia Sophia' s performa- tive aesthetics and the psychological effect they exercised on the spectator. Yet the saturated phenomenon at the core of its space and ritual is built on the principle of excess: a multisen- sory experience tied in Byzantium to the theurgical concept of empsychosis.m Hagia Sophia plunges the faithful into a sea ruffled by human breath transformed into divine reverberation, beguiling them to approach the harbor of the Eucharist, where the faithful recuperate pneuma and ephemerally transform into eikones of God.

The tenth-century Typikon of Hagia Sophia credits only the psalmists as performers of the hymn; Mateos, Le Typikon de la Grand Église, 2:6, 82, 90, 96. Codex Isidore Pyromalus states both the psaltai and the crowd 110</page><page sequence="19">sang the hymn. Similarly, several later sources state that the crowd {ho laos) chanted the hymn: Sinai, MS gr. 973 (twelfth century) and Sinai, MS gr. 1020 (thirteenth century), Opisanie liturgicheskih' rukopisei , ed. A. Dmitrievskij, 3 vols. (Kiev, 1895-1917; rpt, Hildesheim, 1965), 2:84 and 141. All these sources are assembled in E.
