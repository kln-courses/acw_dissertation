<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHURCH HISTORY 'seeing' God, and implicitly an apology for the reality and activity of God" (104). Given this focus, it is somewhat problematic that McClymond fails to consider Edwards's two most overtly polemical texts, Freedom of the Will and Original Sin. He justifies his exclusion of these two treatises with the observa- tion that they were "occasional writings" composed in response to the rise of Arminianism in New England, and therefore "not nearly as central to Ed- wards's lifelong intellectual concerns as is commonly thought" (6). However, Arminianism was an expression of the "trend toward liberalism and tolera- tion in early-eighteenth-century New England" that McClymond identifies as forming the "backdrop to Edwards's apology for Christianity" (107). And Edwards himself describes Freedom of the Will and Original Sin as continuous with the same course of inquiry that produced the ethical writings that McClymond considers integral to Edwards's implicit apology. A consider- ation, therefore, of the apologetic dimension of these two treatises would have strengthened the book's thesis. Although McClymond admits that it is not possible "to claim that Personal Narrative falls into the genre of Christian apology," he includes a discussion of this text in Encounters with God because it enhances a second dimension of his argument (103). According to McClymond, theologians responded in two opposing ways to the Enlightenment challenge to the Christian faith. Conser- vatives developed "logical and empirical arguments on behalf of faith," while romantics maintained "that religion consists in a unique spiritual perception of the world that has little to do with ... rational arguments" (vi). Edwards occupies a "mediating position" between these tendencies (106). Although his explicit apology resembles the conservative position, his writings on the new spiritual sense, which form part of his implicit apology, anticipate romantics such as Schleiermacher. Personal Narrative illustrates this latter approach, for it describes a life of contemplative spirituality in which the world is transformed by the perception of divine excellency. McClymond's explanation of how Edwards "occupies a unique middle ground between liberalizing and conservative tendencies in modern Christian thought" is one of the great strengths of his work (106). In my view, however, this mediating position did not entail a "blurring of any sharp line between the natural and the supernatural" (110). McClymond himself argues that the concept of the new spiritual sense "vindicates the epistemological distinctive- ness" of regenerate perception, and that Edwards's metaphysics "is designed chiefly to highlight the utter uniqueness and incommensurability of God" (21, 31). Without further clarification, therefore, it is difficult to conceive how Edwards could have advocated a "graduated supernaturalism" that "was roughly equidistant between the usual versions of naturalism and supernatu- ralism" (110). This position would have aligned Edwards with Arminian- Calvinism, a heresy that he labored to oppose throughout his career as both pastor and theologian.

Benjamin Franklin has long enjoyed the image of the American philosophe, and with that image has gone the reputation of being, like so many of the 216</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS AND NOTES philosophes, a deist who, at best, had no use for religion apart from the cash value it might yield in human behavior. This, clearly, is the picture we get from the Autobiography: a "benevolent live-and-let-live deist who does well by working hard and doing good for his fellow men regardless of such matters as their station in life, politics, or religion" (in the words of Melvin Buxbaum; see Benjamin Franklin and the Zealous Presbyterians [University Park, Pa.: Penn State Press, 1975]). Those who have dissented from this insufferable secularized Cotton Mather-from the image of "Ben Lightning-rod," as one contemptu- ous Philadelphia contemporary put it-have usually bolted for a variety of extremes. Franklin is either a revolting bourgeous hypocrite, faithless because faith has no cash value (in D. H. Lawrence's memorable essay, printed in idem, Studies in Classic American Literature [London: Martin Secker, 1924]), a pessimistic unbeliever who cannot rid himself of the tinge of Calvinism (as in Ronald Bosco's essay, "'He That Best Understands the World, Least Likes It': The Dark Side of Benjamin Franklin," Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography 111 [1987]: 525-54), or else a lifelong antireligious bounty hunter, looking for revenge for a repressed Calvinist upbringing (which is the way Buxbaum sees things). In this highly persuasive essay, Kerry Walters argues against nearly all of these propositions, beginning with the fundamental one that suggests that religion was little more than peripheral to Franklin's intellectual concerns. Walters's Franklin instead possessed "an awed appreciation of the often murky depth of the self's yearning for self-knowledge and ultimate meaning" (6). And while Walters concedes that the story of Franklin's religion does indeed begin with a rejection of his parents' Calvinism, Walters also insists that, reject them as he might, Franklin's Calvinist origins had long innings in the shaping of his religious ideas, not only in terms of a skepticism about human goodness but also in a vivid appreciation for the consoling powers of knowing that an omnipotent God takes a personal interest in one's affairs. It is also true that Franklin swung from Calvinism into a youthful deism. But the chief product of that fling, Franklin's Dissertation on Liberty and Necessity, only illustrated for Franklin the ethical dead end of eighteenth-century natural religion. The key moment in Franklin's development came, for Walters, in 1728, when Franklin forged a compromise position in his "Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion," which committed him to belief in a deistic Supreme Being, but which also gave legitimacy to the various religious expressions of that deity. Walters, in other words, rejects those readings of Franklin that see him as a feckless bourgeois whose "Articles" are no more than another Poor- Richardesque jest. Walters argues that Franklin developed a "theistic perspec- tivism," which recognized some measure of truth and solace in all organized religions, provided one did not claim that these were more than perspectives about the only genuinely knowable aspect of God, his existence as First Cause. In this way, religion itself becomes more than "merely anthropomorphic projections," because behind them stands the very real First Cause. Yet this position allowed the specific ways in which the First Cause was understood to be graded on a scale of experimental usefulness. On those terms, the mature Franklin emerges as a genuine religious seeker, never passing a church "without regretting that he could not join in it honestly and cordially," and willing by the end of his life to espouse both a doctrine of particular Providence and the depravity of human reason. No wonder, in that light, that he could find common cause with George Whitefield, since he saw in 217</page><page sequence="3">CHURCH HISTORY Whitefield's concern for the origins of religion in spiritual experience and Whitefield's contempt for religious bureaucrats something akin to his own perspectivism. What we get in this reading of Franklin is a religious pragmatist rather than a religious skeptic. The problem is that we also get a relentlessly avuncular image of Franklin, perhaps a little too close for comfort to Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood. There are more teeth in Walters's Franklin than in most, but not quite nearly enough to explain Franklin's occasional outright hostilities to some "theistic perspectives." Walters's treatment of the Hemphill affair in the 1730s smooths away the long-term spite and antagonisms Franklin displayed toward mid-Atlantic Presbyterians; it ignores Franklin's cynical willingness to play Quakers and Presbyterians off against each other in provincial politics; and it underestimates the venom Franklin could employ, for instance, against Anglicans like William Smith and Richard Peters. And yet, this is only to point out that Walters may have strained too hard to homogenize a picture of Franklin that could have stood quite well even with some serious inconsistencies on Franklin's part. Walters is certainly correct in his estimate of Franklin as much more preoccupied a religious thinker than most commentators have allowed. And while attributing to Franklin a "doc- trine" of perspectivism hangs around Franklin a kind of religious-studies ahistoricism, Walters's argument allows us to accept both Franklin's skepti- cism and belief, without feeling the necessity to confine Franklin to explicit eighteenth-century categories. Walters's care in reading Franklin's religious commentary, his sensitivity to nuance, and his quickness in capturing Frank- lin's implications set Benjamin Franklin and His Gods apart as the best freestand- ing treatment of Franklin's religion on offer; and in so doing, the book takes up an important position on the complexities of eighteenth-century religious and intellectual history in a province. Franklin always liked to think of himself as a self-made man; it is no surprise to find him inhabiting a self-made universe. Allen C. Guelzo The Templeton Honors College at Eastern College New England's Moral Legislator: Timothy Dwight, 1752-1817. By John R. Fitzmier. Religion in North America. Bloomington, Ind.: Indiana University Press, 1998. xiv + 261 pp. $39.95 cloth. Some books are so well done that a fair review is largely a recitation of their merits. Moral Legislator is such a work. Based on the author's doctoral dissertation, and more than a decade of further reflection and revision (would that others delayed longer and revised more!), this volume provides the most comprehensive analysis yet undertaken of the life, thought, and influence of the individual sometimes dubbed the Connecticut "Pope." Timothy Dwight's career was varied-as poet, minister, schoolmaster, college president, divinity professor, leader of the Federalist Party, and heir to the familial and theologi- cal traditions of Jonathan Edwards's descendants-and he lived through a period of rapid change, including the Revolution, the early era of nation building, the so-called Second Great Awakening, and the conflicts of the Federalists and Jeffersonians. Apropos of its topic, Moral Legislator is a many-sided work. 218</page></plain_text>
