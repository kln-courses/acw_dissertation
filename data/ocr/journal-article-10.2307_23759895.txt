This figure (Inv. No.: IV Ca 4946) is part of a sizeable collection, which came to the Museum of Ethnology in Berlin at the end of the 19th Century and was acquired from a Mexican collec tor named Florentino Jimeno. The total corpus includes 179 figures and is currently being recorded and studied by the author. A great part of these figures are in the style of Jaina and the related style of the coast of Campeche (Corson 1976; Goldstein 1979). The figure shows a male individual with the upper part of the body naked. The moulded face was worked over after the removal of the front part of a mould. The ear ornament was applied by hand, but only one dise on the left ear and the headdress remain. There is a round spot on the ehest, which seems to indícate the former existence of a circular pendant. After the removal of the front part of the mould and the closing of the back of the figure, the artist elongated the upper part of the head. Then he wrapped a small, trapezoid slab of clay around the head which built the headdress. The head dress fits deeply into the forehead and was wrapped again with two long and rounded slabs of clay, which cross just before the forehead. The top of the headdress and the right part of the two rounded slabs are damaged. The man sits on the back or stands over the back of a zoomorphic or anthropomorphic being. The visible arms, hands and fingers seem to shore up the body of it and are certainly human. The face of the being, however, is deeply furrowed and the big round eyes, the flat and broad nose and the angles of the mouth, which are pulled far back, seem to be non-human. The legs and feet of the standing individual are very simplified and are pulled sidewards. They stick out at a slight angle to the body. The position of the feet and toes, which lifted up the figure at the front présent an effect of the figure as if it is Standing on its toes. The back of the figure is rounded and worked as a third foot. Such a pedestal including feet pointing to the side is typical of so-called "tripod-figures". The contour of the body is poorly marked. The face, hands and toes were worked with a small spatula after removal from the mould. Jewellery such as the ear dise, the pendant and the headdress are applications. Figures of this type have been found in Jonuta (Berlin 1956:figs.9bl,9gl, 10a2; Alvarez&amp; Casasola 1985: láms. 28a, b), Zona Sala (Rands &amp; Rands 1965: 545, fig. 24), Palenque (Goldstein 1978:93, fig. 3c) and Jaina (Coe 1975:1). This suggests the area between Jonuta, Palenque and Jaina as the place of origin of this figure. More evidence comes from the collector himself. In a note, Jimeno states that the figure originated in Palenque. All clues together suggest Palenque as a likely place of origin.
