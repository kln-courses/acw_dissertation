<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Wagner, Klimt, and the Metaphysics  of Creativity in fin-de-siècle Vienna Kevin C. Karnes It is precisely the poet’s task to interpret and record his dreams. —Hans Sachs in Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg In a recent follow-up to his classic study Wittgenstein’s Vienna, theAustrian historian of philosophy Allan Janik astutely observes that“Richard Wagner’s role as the philosophical father of Viennese mod- ernism has been completely overlooked by cultural historians.” To be sure, Janik exaggerates a bit. But it is certainly true that Wagner’s influence on the period has not received much consideration.1 Janik’s principal concern is with the visual arts, and he attributes Wagner’s absence from art-historical narra- tives to the “uncritical reception” of Carl E. Schorske’s pioneering study of the Vienna Secession. That study appeared in 1979, in Schorske’s Fin-de-Siècle Vienna, a volume widely regarded as having founded the field of modern Austrian cultural studies, and one whose influence continues to dominate scholarship in the field today.2 In this work, Schorske emphasized the influ- ence of Friedrich Nietzsche, both early and late, upon Gustav Klimt and other I am deeply grateful for the comments of Conny Chen, Walter Frisch, Peter Höyng, Silvio dos Santos, and Holly Watson on earlier versions of this article; and for the comments of the anony- mous reviewers for this Journal.

Although his work remains valuable for its insightful interpretations of artistic works and political movements, aspects of Schorske’s thesis—heavily indebted to Freudian psychoanalysis and argued in terms of a genera- tion’s “collective oedipal revolt” against the “paternal culture” of Austrian liberalism (see  p. xxvi)—has recently been subjected to critique. For various attempts to revise and complicate Schorske’s theses, see, in addition to Janik’s Wittgenstein’s Vienna Revisited, the essays collected in Steven Beller, ed., Rethinking Vienna 1900 (New York and Oxford: Berghahn, 2001). Although Schorske’s work still dominates much musicological work on the period, the nature of its role  has recently been questioned, most notably by Leon Botstein, in “Music in History: The Perils of Method in Reception History,” Musical Quarterly 89 (2006): 1–16.

But he paid little attention to Wagner, who was the source of many of Nietzsche’s ideas, or to the philosopher who inspired both Nietzsche and Wagner: Arthur Schopenhauer.3 The problem with Schorske’s book, Janik argues, is that the ideas of Wagner, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche simply cannot be isolated from one another. Most importantly, they simply were not isolated from each other in the late nineteenth century. Indeed, Janik  continues, of the three, it was Wagner whose work most successfully delivered aspects of their intertwined philosophical convictions to a mass audience dur- ing the period. Nietzsche and Schopenhauer, though gifted writers both, are difficult and require significant effort and commitment to understand. Wagner’s statements, as Janik has it, “were so crude that they were seldom misunderstood.”4 Although the present article is inspired by Janik’s call to establish Wagner’s role in the history of fin-de-siècle Viennese modernism, I advance my thesis in opposition to his suggestion that the composer’s philosophies were “crude.” Wagner was not, I would argue, the none-too-deep proselytizer of Schopen-  hauerian metaphysics that Janik and others have suggested, a figure who, in essays such as his widely read Beethoven (1870), produced nineteenth-century “Cliff ’s Notes” versions of the philosopher’s lengthy tracts. Moreover, I would suggest that Wagner’s influence cannot be attributed primarily to his essays. Rather, that influence emanated primarily from his work as a composer, one whose late music dramas, especially Tristan und Isolde, Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, and Parsifal, embodied and even literally enacted essential facets of his unique and largely coherent philosophical worldview. Un-  questionably, Nietzsche was, as Schorske suggests, an important force in  shaping the outlook of many late-century Viennese. But my focus here will be on the influence exerted by Nietzsche’s onetime mentor—Wagner—precisely because that influence has so often been neglected in the work of cultural  historians.5 3. It goes without saying that Wagner’s influence upon musical life and culture in turn-of- the-century Vienna has received considerable attention. Among recent large-scale studies, see, for instance, Margaret Notley, Lateness and Brahms: Music and Culture in the Twilight of Viennese Liberalism (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2007); and Kevin C. Karnes, Music, Criticism, and the Challenge of History: Shaping Modern Musical Thought in Late Nineteenth- Century Vienna (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2008). 4. Janik, Wittgenstein’s Vienna Revisited, 93. 5. The extent to which Wagner’s influence continues to be neglected can perhaps be mea- sured by a remark made recently by Peter Gay, who in his survey of European aesthetic mod- ernism notes that “the study of Wagner” seems largely “tangential . . . for tracing the early twentieth-century evolution of modernism in music.” See Gay, Modernism: The Lure of Heresy; From Baudelaire to Beckett and Beyond (New York: Norton, 2008), 238. The single, classic excep- tion to this historiographical trend is William J. McGrath’s study of Viennese student culture in the 1870s and 1880s, in which Wagner and Schopenhauer figure prominently: Dionysian Art and Populist Politics in Austria (New Haven, CT, and London: Yale University Press, 1974). </page> <page sequence="3"> Wagner, Klimt, and the Metaphysics of Creativity in fin-de-siècle Vienna 649 As Eric Chafe has recently suggested with respect to Tristan and as I will argue here, Wagner was neither a parrot nor a simplifier but an interpreter of his philosophical idol, Arthur Schopenhauer. At times, he was an insightful and highly original one, as evinced in what the composer described as his “amendment” to Schopenhauer’s metaphysics of sexual love played out in Tristan und Isolde.6 As we shall see, Wagner’s other late music dramas are also threaded through with similar enactments of his distinctly personal philosoph- ical convictions. And, thanks in large part to the frequent performance of those works under the direction of Gustav Mahler and others in the years around 1900, a complex of Wagnerian-Schopenhauerian ideas—or, more ac- curately, Wagner’s distinct brand of Schopenhauerianism, the philosopher as interpreted by the composer—continued to permeate Viennese society for decades after Wagner’s death in 1883. Undoubtedly, there were many creative figures in turn-of-the-century Vienna and environs who were simply disinter- ested in reading either Schopenhauer or Nietzsche (or, for that matter, Wagner), however familiar they might have been with the philosophers’ names. But many such individuals would have encountered traces and variants of those authors’ philosophical ideas through Wagner’s music dramas, either heard in performance or discovered in conversation with members of the city’s musical community. Klimt, to take but one example, was notoriously uninter- ested in bookish pursuits. Yet much of his Secession-era work appears as though imbued with Schopenhauerian themes, and he certainly seems to have known his Wagner.7 6. Eric Chafe, The Tragic and the Ecstatic: The Musical Revolution of Wagner’s “Tristan and Isolde” (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2005), 8–11. A handful of other recent studies have likewise taken seriously Wagner’s philosophical contributions. See, for instance, Roger Scruton, Death-Devoted Heart: Sex and the Sacred in Wagner’s “Tristan and Isolde” (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2004); and Bryan Magee, The Tristan Chord: Wagner and Philosophy (New York: Henry Holt, 2000). Aside from these, most studies to address the subject of Wagner’s Schopenhauerianism have tended either to portray the composer as an uncritical appropriator of Schopenhauer’s ideas or to charge, as Thomas Mann and Theodor Adorno did early in the twentieth century, that Wagner misunderstood or misrepresented Schopenhauer’s philosophy in his work. See Mann, Pro and Contra Wagner, trans. Allan Blunden (London and Boston: Faber and Faber, 1985), 195; and Adorno, In Search of Wagner, trans. Rodney Livingstone (London: Verso, 1981), esp. 143–56. 7. The first studies to suggest Klimt’s apparent debt to Wagner, evinced most clearly in the published program for his Beethoven Frieze (1902), were Johannes Dobai, “Zu Gustav Klimts Gemälde Der Kuß,” Mitteilungen der österreichischen Galerie 12 (1968): 108; and Peter Vergo, “Gustav Klimt’s Beethoven Frieze,” Burlington Magazine 115, no. 839 (1973): 107–13.

Of the </page> <page sequence="4"> 650 Journal of the American Musicological Society One aspect of Wagner’s largely unacknowledged philosophical legacy espe- cially begs for attention: his Schopenhauer-inspired view of artistic creativity. Of particular import is his conviction that the source of artistic creativity re- sides in the depths of the unconscious mind, accessible to us in dreams; that what the creative artist must therefore depict in his or her work is not the world outside (however transformed by fantasy, as the Romantics were apt to present it) but the world within ourselves; and that it is precisely within our- selves that essential truths, or the essence of human existence, is to be found. To illuminate the resonance of these ideas in fin-de-siècle Vienna, I will con- sider the case of Klimt, whose evolution from historicist master to a singular modern who, in Schorske’s terms, “plunged into the self,” “embarked on a voyage intérieur,” and recorded painterly visions of a psychic reality “not dis- similar” to those probed in Freud’s Interpretation of Dreams (1899), sparked unprecedented scandal in Viennese society.8 I will attempt to locate some of the roots of Klimt’s artistic dive into the “inner world” (in the words of his contemporary Hermann Bahr) in Wagner’s interpretations of Schopenhauer’s metaphysics.9 Along the way, I hope to shed light on Wagner’s heretofore un- recognized role as a creative interpreter of the philosopher, as evinced in an as- pect of his musical output whose Schopenhauerian foundations have eluded the notice of nearly all commentators upon it: the compositional lessons im- parted by the poet-singer Hans Sachs to his student Walther von Stolzing in Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg.  Nuda Veritas : Gustav Klimt and the Vienna Secession Founded in May 1897 amidst the literal secession of Klimt and twelve others from the Genossenschaft bildender Künstler Wiens, Vienna’s only significant artists’ society, the Vereinigung bildender Künstler Österreichs (popularly known as the Vienna Secession) never declared a unifying aesthetic vision.10 thirteen others, eight are either books about Klimt himself or autographed copies of books au- thored by friends and presented to him as gifts. 8. Schorske, Fin-de-siècle Vienna, 208. The “modern” nature of Klimt’s work was widely noted by contemporary supporters and detractors, many of whose published statements are col- lected in Hermann Bahr, ed., Gegen Klimt (Vienna and Leipzig: J. Eisenstein, 1903).

Its members promoted freedom of artistic expression, untouched by the “marketplace” concerns of the Genossenschaft, which held, until the completion of the Secession’s own hall in November 1898, a near monopoly over exhibition space in the city.11 And it sought, through its exhibitions and its monthly jour- nal Ver Sacrum, to promote Austrian art both at home and abroad, and to  effect the “heightening of artistic sensibility in Austria” by bringing “the most significant artistic achievements of foreign lands” to the provincial Habsburg capital.12 Appointed the Secessionists’ leader at the start, Klimt was widely  regarded as the organization’s guiding light. Remarkably little is known about Klimt’s life, in large part because of his powerful aversion to written correspondence and every other form of writing. Nonetheless, its broad outlines, many related through the recollections of friends, are clear.13 Over the course of the decade leading up to his secession from the Genossenschaft, Klimt had enjoyed a stellar career. As a founding member of the Künstlercompagnie, an “Artists’ Company” consisting of him- self, his brother Ernst, and their friend Franz Matsch, he had completed a se- ries of prestigious imperial commissions, decorating the interiors of new Ringstrasse buildings in the historicist style of his early idol, Hans Makart.14 Society for the Promotion of Science and Scholarship, 1981), 5–26; Vergo, Art in Vienna, 17– 44; and Frank Whitford, Klimt (London and New York: Thames and Hudson, 1990), 67–80. My account in this paragraph is based upon these sources. 11. As Anna Harwell Celenza observes, however, members of the Secession were hardly im- mune to financial incentives.

For the Secession’s founding statutes, see Ver Sacrum 1, no. 1 (1898): 27; they are par- tially reprinted in Nebehay, Gustav Klimt, 137. In its deliberately internationalist outlook, in- tended to broaden the aesthetic horizons of late-century Viennese, the Secession had much in common with the “Jung-Wien” literary movement of the early 1890s. Significantly, the critic Hermann Bahr, who would emerge as the leading literary spokesman for the Secession, had ear- lier played the same role for Jung-Wien. On Bahr’s role in the Secession, see Donald G. Daviau, Understanding Hermann Bahr (St. Ingbert, Austria: Röhrig Universitätsverlag, 2002), 134–61.

His rendering of her fig- ure is flat; he gives no sense of depth or perspective. At her feet grow flowers, signs of a nascent “sacred spring” (ver sacrum), the metaphor by which mem- bers of the Secession described the rebirth of Austrian artistic culture they  envisioned. Her image incorporates classic elements of the pan-German Jugendstil that Klimt’s work of this period is often seen to represent: the or- ganic, curving lines that frame her head and shoulders, and the “flatness or two-dimensionality” (in Walter Frisch’s words) of the whole.18 “Truth is fire, and to proclaim the truth is to illuminate and to burn,” announces the draw- ing’s crowning text, credited to one L. Schefer.19 In her right hand the the Birth of Urban Modernism.” On Viennese historicist painting of the period, including some of Klimt’s own early work, see the exhibit catalogue Pre-Modern Art of Vienna: 1847–1898, ed. Leon Botstein and Linda Weintraub (Annandale-on-Hudson, NY: Bard College, 1987). In the latter catalogue, Alessandra Comini’s essay “From Biedermeier to Secession: The Golden Age of Franz Joseph, 1847–1898” (66–79) is especially helpful. 15. Whitford, noting a significant falling-off in Klimt’s productivity beginning around 1892, suggests that personal upheavals might have been at least partly to blame for what appears to have been the artist’s “creative crisis” mid-decade. These included, most significantly, the deaths of Klimt’s father and brother Ernst. However, there exists no documentary evidence to shed light on the situation. See Whitford, Klimt, 45–46. 16. The most widely known among these was the second of three works by Klimt entitled Musik (often called Musik II), commissioned for the music room of the home of the Viennese  industrialist Nikolaus Dumba. The painting was destroyed by fire in 1945. See Schorske, Fin-de- siècle Vienna, 220–21; a photograph is given on p. 223. 17. Ver Sacrum 1, no. 3 (1898): 12.  18. Frisch, German Modernism, 109. Frisch provides an illuminating discussion of music and Jugendstil throughout chap. 3 of his study, “Convergences: Music and the Visual Arts.” 19. The source of this text—like the identity of its author, L. Schefer—is obscure. It is possi- ble that Klimt found it second-hand; it appears as the title-page epigram in Johannes Scherr’s Geschichte der deutschen Frauenwelt, 3rd ed., 3 vols. (Leipzig: Otto Wigand, 1873), a book with which Klimt, given his self-proclaimed fascination with women, might well have been familiar. In Scherr’s volume, the quotation is similarly ascribed to “L. Schefer.” In 1899, Klimt reworked the Nuda Veritas drawing as a painting, which was displayed at the fifth exhibition of the Secession (November 1899 through January 1900) and identified in the exhibition catalogue as Die nackte Wahrheit (The Naked Truth); see Nebehay, Gustav Klimt, 197, and p. 199 for a photograph of the exhibit space with Klimt’s painting on the wall. In the 1899 painting, Klimt replaced Schefer’s text with a passage from Friedrich Schiller’s poem “Die zwei Tugendwege” (1795): “Kannst du </page> <page sequence="7"> Wagner, Klimt, and the Metaphysics of Creativity in fin-de-siècle Vienna 653 Figure 1 Klimt, Nuda Veritas (Ver Sacrum 1, no. 3 [1898]: 12) nicht allen gefallen durch deine That und dein Kunstwerk, mach es wenigen recht; vielen gefallen ist schlimm” (“If you cannot please everyone through your deeds and your artwork, strive to please just a few. To please many is of little worth”). This painting is among Klimt’s best-known works and is reproduced in nearly every monograph on the artist.

In Carl Schorske’s classic interpretation of the work, the Nuda Veritas con- stitutes a graphic manifesto for Klimt and his Secession colleagues. It is an “ideological drawing,” Schorske writes, in which Klimt sought, in the words of the Secession architect Otto Wagner, “to show modern man his true face.”20 Juxtaposing an imagined, reflected image of the observer with his fig- ure’s stark, uninhibited nakedness, Klimt lay “bare the instinctual life that had been sublimated or repressed in the classic tradition.” Revealing this world of inner instinct, according to both Schorske and Otto Wagner, was the rightful charge of the modern artist and the charge Klimt set himself to fulfill.21 To be sure, the Nuda Veritas can be seen as all of the things Schorske claims.22 But if the drawing was intended or read as a manifesto proclaiming the proper role of the artist in modern society, then it is important to note that it might also be regarded as a deeply Schopenhauerian vision of the same. Although Schopenhauer is often mentioned, by Schorske and others, as a pos- sible or generalized influence upon Klimt and his work, the specific nature and scope of that influence has yet to be examined in detail.23 Nonetheless, I 20.

Though Schorske touches upon it only obliquely, it is extremely important that Klimt portrays a woman. As Lisa Fischer has recently suggested, the gender of Klimt’s subject is highly significant with respect to observations such as those of Schorske and Otto Wagner just quoted. As she aptly points out, “the crisis of the ego” that Schorske posits as a defining precondition to the production of modernist art in fin-de-siècle Vienna “was a crisis of the male subject.” Fischer continues: “Women [of the period] dared to set out on the path to self-discovery, forced their way as never before onto the labour market and into male art domains, where they posed a threat as ri- vals. In politics, they demanded the right to vote and access to education. They thus became part of that mood of upheaval and crisis that marked the cheerful apocalypse. . . . In the minds of men who stylised themselves as gods, women, as ethereal beings, advanced to become the symbol, as it were, of a new womanhood, behind which real women were deliberately made to disappear.” I will return to this issue in note 31 below. See Fischer, “Gender Asymmetries in Viennese Modernism,” in Klimt’s Women, ed. Tobias G. Natter and Gerbert Frodl (Vienna: Öster-  reichische Galerie Belvedere, and Cologne: DuMont, 2000), 32–33; and idem, “Über die erschreckende Modernität der Antimoderne der Wiener Moderne Oder über den Kult der toten Dinge,” in Die Frauen der Wiener Moderne, ed.

In his principal philosophical tract, The World as Will and Representation (Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung), Schopenhauer devotes literally hundreds of pages to aesthetics: a quarter of the work’s first volume (1818, revised 1844), plus eleven of fifty chapters in its second (1844). The gist of his argu- ment regarding the nature of the artist and his work, widely discussed in the literature on the philosopher, can be briefly summarized as follows.24 For Schopenhauer, the essence of reality, the “thing-in-itself” (the singular is im- portant), is what he called the will: basically, energy—existing outside of time and space, undifferentiated, always charged and always striving after no partic- ular thing. All objects and phenomena we observe in the world are, in con- trast, mere “representations” (Vorstellungen) of the will, representations that we construct for ourselves in accordance with the only perceptive tools we have: our five senses and our faculty of reason, which cannot directly appre- hend something transcendent of time, space, and causality. On account of our cognitive limitations, and in spite of the undifferentiated essence of all things, we see ourselves and other beings and objects as individual entities, existing in our individual pockets of time and space. This way of perceiving the world we inhabit Schopenhauer called, after the Sanskrit, the “veil of ma ̄ya ̄”; we persist, he argued, enveloped in a veil-like illusion that obscures our perception of the thing-in-itself. But although we cannot perceive the will directly, Schopen - hauer explains, we perceive its effects all around us. For the striving of the will is what lies behind all forces of motion and transformation (gravity, light, en- tropy), and also everything that motivates, propels, and enables human and painting Philosophie (1900), which considers a number of specific Schopenhauerian references made in that work; see Vergo, “Gustav Klimts Philosophie und das Programm der Universitäts-  gemälde,” Mitteilungen der österreichischen Galerie 22–23 (1977–79): 69–99. Vergo suggests, moreover, that “it is entirely possible that Klimt took his Schopenhauer not directly from the source but second-hand”—that is, from Richard Wagner (93–94). Vergo’s suggestion is acknowl- edged by Schorske but also quickly dismissed; the imagery of Philosophy, Schorske writes, “points, in my view, rather to Nietzsche’s than to Wagner’s reading of Schopenhauer’s existential meta- physics” (Fin-de-siècle Vienna, 228). Schorske then departs from the topic of Schopenhauer to en- gage in discussion of Nietzsche’s Thus Spoke Zarathustra (227–31). 24. For detailed discussions and analyses of Schopenhauer’s aesthetics, to which my under- standing is indebted, see Cheryl Foster, “Ideas and Imagination: Schopenhauer on the Proper Foundation of Art,” in The Cambridge Companion to Schopenhauer, ed.

Atwell, Schopenhauer on the Character of the World: The Metaphysics of Will (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1995); and Christopher Janaway, Self and World in Schopen hauer’s Philosophy (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989). </page> <page sequence="10"> 656 Journal of the American Musicological Society animal life, from the beating of our hearts to the sparking of our nerves to our hunger and thirst and longing for love. Indeed, Schopenhauer refers to these latter things as manifestations of the “will-to-live.” “The action of the body,” he explains, “is nothing but the act of will objectified, i.e., translated into per- ception. . . . What is known immediately to everyone is denoted by the word will.”25 Now, since the will is the thing that motivates all human action and emo- tions, Schopenhauer reasons, the will must also be the ultimate cause of every human suffering. After all, given that the will is timeless, transcendent of space, and endlessly striving, it cannot be stilled or satiated by anything we might conceive as a possible goal or satisfaction. This property of the will is  familiar, in fact, to everyone from his or her everyday experiences. However much food we might consume to satisfy our hunger, we will always grow hun- gry again. However much money we might someday earn, our desire for more will remain one step ahead of our earnings, and we will inevitably yearn for a raise. However powerfully we might long for love, our hoped-for rela- tionship will remain but a dream, or it will turn sour, or we will tire of our partner and grow bored—a fate, for Schopenhauer, worse than all the others. “Every satisfied desire gives birth to a new one,” he writes. “No possible satis- faction in the world could suffice to still its craving, set a final goal to its de- mands, and fill the bottomless pit of its heart.”26 It is enough to make one want to turn his back on it all and renounce all desiring, or at least to find a means by which to blunt the pain it engenders, even for a moment. This latter blunting, in the philosopher’s view, is precisely the role of art. Before one can transcend the interminable pain of endless desiring born of will, Schopenhauer argues, one must, first and foremost, recognize the world for what it is. We must pierce through the veil of ma ̄ya ̄, look beyond the “principle of individuation” (principium individuationis) imposed by our senses upon our minds, and strive to apprehend the essential oneness—as will—of all being. Thus, the philosopher reasons, we might hope to recognize the root cause of our desiring and our suffering. An important step toward this goal, he suggests, is taken by the artist. For although even the most bril- liant artist cannot perceive the will directly, he can come closer to that goal than most others can.27 This is because the creative genius, for Schopenhauer, 25.

My choice of pronouns is deliberate, for Schopenhauer’s notion of creative genius explic- itly excluded women from its ranks. As the philosopher wrote in 1851, “The sight of the female </page> <page sequence="11"> Wagner, Klimt, and the Metaphysics of Creativity in fin-de-siècle Vienna 657 has the ability to see the “Idea” behind every individual representation, the common type related to the individual “as the archetype is to its copies.”28 “Always to see the universal in the particular,” Schopenhauer writes, “is pre- cisely the fundamental characteristic of genius.”29 In his work, the artist of  genius portrays the ideal type or essential manifestation of whatever object  he contemplates. Of course, such an object of the artist’s contemplation might well be hu- manity itself. And it is with respect to his consideration of such a situation that Schopenhauer’s statements find resonance and expression in Klimt’s Ver Sacrum drawing. “In the lyrics of genuine poets,” Schopenhauer counsels with regard to the Idea portrayed therein, “is reflected the inner nature of the whole of mankind.” Indeed, he argues, the gifted poet “is the mirror [Spiegel] of mankind, and brings to consciousness what it feels and does.”30 In this pas- sage, we find a philosophical counterpart to the figure of the Nuda Veritas, her nakedness revealing her inner self (the veil of her clothing having been lifted by the artist to reveal what lies beneath the obscuring facade; her  flat, featureless visage undermining the principle of individuation), and her right arm holding a Schopenhauerian mirror before our gaze, to “show,” in the words of Otto Wagner, “modern man his true face.”31 Schopenhauer  form tells us that woman is not destined for great work, either intellectual or physical. She bears the guilt of life not by doing but by suffering; she pays the debt by the pains of childbirth, care for the child, submissiveness to her husband . . . [women] really and truly have no bent and receptiv- ity either for music, poetry, or the plastic arts; but when they affect and profess to like such things, it is mere aping for the sake of their desire to please. This is why they are incapable of taking a purely objective interest in anything.” This “purely objective interest,” as we shall see below, was Schopenhauer’s prerequisite for artistic creativity. (Schopenhauer, Parerga and Paralipomena, trans. E. F. J. Payne, 2 vols. [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1974], 2:614 and 619; Parerga und Paralipomena, SW 6:649 and 655.)

The Nuda Veritas, she argues, is emblematic </page> <page sequence="12"> 658 Journal of the American Musicological Society continues with another anticipation of Klimt’s drawing. The revelation of “pure, true, and profound knowledge of the inner nature of the world,”  the philosopher writes, “becomes for him [the artist] an end in itself”—thus reminding us of the Nuda Veritas’s crowing maxim about veritas (truth)  and fire.32 “Nothing artistically beautiful,” Schopenhauer concludes, “can be without truth” (ohne Wahrheit kein Kunstschönes seyn kann).33 Schopenhauer’s statements on the role of the artist provide a tantalizing perspective on Klimt’s Nuda Veritas, and also on its reception in Klimt’s time and our own. But before we celebrate our discovery of a new interpretive key to the drawing, we must recall an important fact: There exists not one shred of evidence, either documentary or anecdotal, to suggest that Klimt ever read the philosopher’s work. And while we might be tempted to conclude simply that Schopenhauer’s ideas were “in the air,” we can indeed find compelling, even if partly circumstantial, evidence that Klimt knew and pondered the work of that philosopher’s most prominent late-century disciple. And so it is to Richard Wagner’s writings and music that we should now turn. Schopenhauer, Wagner, and the Metaphysics of Creativity Although the Nuda Veritas appears to draw upon Schopenhauerian imagery in a number of tantalizing ways, there is at least one very significant respect in which the drawing’s message seems to be deeply un -Schopenhauerian. This pertains to the question of just where the “truth” communicated by the art- work is posited to reside. To say that truth, or the essential nature of the world, is somehow manifested within us (behind our gaze, or the face in the mirror) is, to the philosopher’s mind, certainly true, since every human being, like everything else in the world, is a representation of the thing-in-itself or will. But for Schopenhauer, the way in which artists can glimpse that truth, or at least come close to it, is not by taking a look inside our psychic selves. Time and again in The World as Will and Representation, Schopenhauer argues that the special perceptive gift of the artist is not to penetrate his inner world but to see things outside of himself as they really are, with what the philosopher calls of the way Klimt “used [women] in his life and abused them in his work by concealing their real diversity behind a uniform artistic facade.” The work, she continues, “is a destructive variant of  a male fantasy that strives to master woman by reducing her to a symbol.” See Fischer, “Gender Asymmetries in Viennese Modernism,” 35 and 37. 32.

As Cheryl Foster nicely summarizes, “For Schopenhauer, genuine aesthetic experience, though rare, leads directly to an apprehension of metaphysical truth, to the core of genuine knowledge.” (Foster, “Ideas and Imagination,” 213.) </page> <page sequence="13"> Wagner, Klimt, and the Metaphysics of Creativity in fin-de-siècle Vienna 659 “the most complete objectivity” (die vollkommendste Objektivität). Our inner lives, he argues, are simply too bound up with emotions and desires—with “our own will,” as he called it—to permit such an objective look within. This is one aspect of Schopenhauer’s philosophizing, for all its indebtedness to Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder, Ludwig Tieck, and other Romantic writers, that is thoroughly un-Romantic.34 “The gift of genius,” Schopenhauer writes, “is nothing but the most complete objectivity, i.e., the objective tendency of the mind, as opposed to the subjective directed to our own person, i.e., to the will.”35 The artist’s work, he explains, springs from “knowledge turning away entirely from our own will . . . and [from] considering things as though they could never in any way concern the will. For only thus does knowledge be- come the pure mirror of the objective inner nature of things. A knowledge  so conditioned must be the basis of every genuine work of art.” Such “pure will-less knowledge,” he continues, “is reached by the consciousness of other things being raised to so high a potential that the consciousness of our own selves vanishes.”36 As is evident from these passages, Schopenhauer was not describing the sort of inward-facing path to Schopenhauerian insight depicted in Nuda Veritas. Rather, as we shall see, it was described by Richard Wagner. That Klimt was familiar with Wagner’s work, and particularly with his Beethoven essay, was first suggested by Johannes Dobai and Peter Vergo  more than thirty years ago, in discussion of the artist’s Beethoven Frieze first shown in 1902.37 Klimt’s frieze, to which we will return at the end of this  article, was described in the exhibit catalogue by way of a narrative program, concluding with quotations from Friedrich Schiller’s Ode to Joy and thus  suggesting clear, conceptual links to Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony.

Diesen Kuß der ganzen Welt.”)38 The final panel of the Beethoven Frieze (see Fig. 2), as Vergo points out, was exhibited separately at the Secession’s all-Klimt show the following year, when it was described differently in the accompanying literature. There, instead of the Schiller quotations, it bore the descriptive title “Mein Reich ist nicht von dieser Welt” (“My kingdom is not of this world”), a biblical passage cited by Wagner in the dramatic conclusion of Beethoven. “Just as Christianity stepped out from under the universal civilization of the Romans,” Wagner wrote, “so does music now break forth from amidst the chaos of modern civi- lization. Both say to us: ‘Our kingdom is not of this world.’ Which means: We come from within, you from without; we spring from the essence of things, you from the appearance.”39 Certainly, the evidence presented by Vergo and Dobai invites a close look at Wagner’s Beethoven essay, especially since its  primary concerns are precisely those broached in our examination of Nuda Veritas: questions about where and how the artist gets his ideas, about how he creates his work, about what his work brings to the observer, and about the nature of the artist’s role in society. The Beethoven essay, published to commemorate the composer’s centen- nial, is widely regarded as Wagner’s Schopenhauerian credo. It was, in the words of Bryan Magee, the essay in which he sought to “reformulate the  theory set out in Opera and Drama”—his great artistic manifesto, written in 1851, three years before he encountered the philosopher’s work—“in a way that takes account of Schopenhauer.”40 Indeed, much of Wagner’s commem- orative essay, including those parts discussed almost exclusively in the musico- logical literature, are paraphrases of Schopenhauer pure and simple. In Beethoven, Wagner refers repeatedly to the philosopher and cites extensively from The World as Will and Representation. He argues, just as Schopenhauer did, that music is unique among the arts. While all other arts portray only the Idea or common type behind the infinite diversity of individual representa- tions (it depicts the “universal in the particular,” as Schopenhauer wrote in a 38.

Accordingly, we could just as well call the world embodied  music as embodied will.”42 41.

Significantly, these latter remarks address precisely the introspective, “Orphic and internal” (in Schorske’s terms) quest for essence that we encounter in Klimt’s Nuda Veritas.43 Wagner’s account  of creativity is obscure and esoteric, however. And although he frequently refers to the philosopher, his statements bear no direct relationship to what Schopenh auer actually wrote on music or art. After summarizing Schopen-  hauer’s argument about music as a reflection of the will, Wagner makes the following statement: Alongside the world that is visible to us when we are awake and also in dreams, we are aware of another world perceptible only through our sense of hearing, a world declaring itself through sound—literally, a sound-world existing alongside the light-world, to which we could say it is related just as dreaming is to wake- fulness. The former is every bit as apparent to us as the latter, even though we must regard it as something completely different from it. Just as the vivid world of dreams can present itself to us only though a special function of the brain, so too can music enter our consciousness only through a similar brain function.44 After providing this curious overview of the composer’s psychic landscape, Wagner proceeds to introduce a faculty he calls the “dream-organ” (Traum -  organ). He ascribes the idea to Schopenhauer without citation and defines this organ as “an inward-facing function of the brain” that becomes active during sleep. In deepest sleep, Wagner explains, the dream-organ brings us into con- tact with an “inner life, through which we are directly allied with the whole of nature, and thus we are brought into a relationship with the essence of things that eludes the forms of outer knowledge (time and space).”45 unmittelbar Abbild des Willens selbst ist und also zu allem Physischen der Welt das Meta-  physische, zu aller Erscheinung das Ding an sich darstellt. Man könnte demnach die Welt ebenso wohl verkörperte Musik, als verkörperten Willen nennen.” (Die Welt als Wille, SW 2:310.) 43. Schorske, Fin-de-Siècle Vienna, 85. 44.

And a person awakens from such dreaming, he writes, with a terrible scream, which “we can only regard as the most immediate  expression of the will itself.”46 But as a scream, the utterance is incomprehensi- ble. And so, Wagner explains, “the dream of deepest sleep can be appre- hended by waking consciousness only when it is translated into the language of a second, allegorical dream, which immediately precedes our waking.” For Wagner, that language is music. “In order to reveal to us an image of its own self, the will creates a second communicative organ, of which one side remains turned toward the inner vision while the other reaches out to the outer world, now reappearing to us as we awaken, through the immediate, sympathetic  experience of tone.”47 In deepest sleep, the composer of genius comes into contact, through the medium of the dream, with the will. Terrified of that  inner vision, he awakens with a scream. Sometimes, however, his waking is preceded by another, shallower kind of sleeping, in which the will no longer appears directly but is “translated” into an allegorical language comprehensi- ble by our conscious faculties. This latter is the language of music, which the artist records when he awakens. In this part of the Beethoven essay, we encounter an unfamiliar aspect of Wagner the writer: a perceptive, original, and creative interpreter of the philosopher he idolized. For although Wagner’s theory of creativity has little in common with Schopenhauer’s writings on music or art, it borrows heavily from another, more obscure aspect of the latter’s work. The relevant text is found not in Schopenhauer’s principal tract but in his Parerga and Para - lipomena (Additions and Omissions, as Magee translates the title),48 a massive collection of essays that comment on, elaborate, or extend the discussions in The World as Will and Representation. Seldom read today, Parerga and Paralipomena was in fact the most popular of Schopenhauer’s works in the late nineteenth century. (When the musicologist Guido Adler sought to ac- quaint himself with the philosopher’s thought in the 1880s, for instance, it was to Parerga and Paralipomena that he turned.)49 In the first volume of the 46.

And although William Ashton Ellis, Wagner’s Victorian transla- tor, pointed out the composer’s indebtedness to this essay over a century ago, the relationship between the composer’s Beethoven and Schopenhauer’s “Spirit Seeing” remains virtually unexamined to this day.51 As I will argue, however, we find elaborated in the latter essay the very theory of dreams ap- propriated by Wagner as the foundation for his statements on creativity. In his “Essay on Spirit Seeing,” Schopenhauer introduces us to each of  the metaphysical elements from which Wagner constructed his arguments. The essential stuff of dreams, Schopenhauer explains, consists in “feeble echoes of certain events in the interior of the organism, which disappear right up into the brain and give rise to its dreams.”52 The phenomenon of dreaming itself, he continues, might well be called “second sight. For the ability to dream . . . is indeed a second faculty of intuitive perception and is unlike the first that is brought about through the medium of the external senses.”53 He describes the “dream-organ” (Traumorgan) as a “faculty of intuitive perception which has been shown to be independent of the external impress on the senses.” And, he adds, “Every case of vision through the dream-organ is the activity of the intuitively perceiving brain-function that is stimulated by inner instead of outer impressions.”54 He calls dreams in which we see and experience things 50.

The phenomenon of clairvoyance (Hellsehn), he argues, “loses . . . its absolute incomprehensibility if we reflect that, as I have often said, the objective world”—the world of representations—“is a mere phenomenon of the brain.” Apparently, he continues, the parameters accord- ing to which we perceive the world—time and space—“are to some extent set aside in somnambulistic clairvoyance.”56 The clairvoyant is able to transcend those parameters because he or she somehow taps into the timeless, spaceless essence of all being, the will itself, in his or her dreams. Having advanced this hypothesis, Schopenhauer delivers his knockout punch: he describes the phe- nomenon of clairvoyance as something accessible, at least theoretically, by  us all. “Since we ourselves also form part of the inner essence of the world,”  he explains, it is conceivable that we might “succeed for once, by eluding the principium individuationis, in getting at things from quite a different direc- tion and on quite a different path, namely directly from within”—via clairvoy- ant dreams—“instead of merely from without.”57 In the telling of the clairvoyant’s morning-dream, he argues, we hear echoes of the universal will. And since that will is the essence of us all, we recognize ourselves in her vision. ist.

In-  deed, the leap from one to the other is so simple that one is surprised Schopen hauer failed to make it himself. For the philosopher, all dream-visions arise within ourselves. And some dreamers, those endowed with clairvoyance, are somehow able to tap into the essence of the world, the will, in their dream- experiences. Now, if music, as Schopenhauer wrote in The World as Will and Representation, is itself a reflection of that same will or essence, then it is no great stretch to fuse the philosopher’s metaphysics of music and his theory of dreams in precisely the way Wagner did. In Beethoven, Wagner gives us, re- worked as one overarching theory of creativity, all the essential elements of Schopen hauer’s arguments regarding both topics. We have the dream-organ, through which the genius taps into the will, and also the allegorical or  morning-dream through which that inner vision is made comprehensible to the conscious mind. For the Schopenhauer of the “Essay on Spirit Seeing,” the reflection of the will brought back to consciousness is the clairvoyant’s  vision. For the Schopenhauer of The World as Will and Representation, music is also a reflection of the will. For Wagner, they are one and the same.58 The significance of Wagner’s theory for our present investigation is great, for it locates the source of creative vision and the universal, essential truths un- veiled through the artwork in precisely the place where the Nuda Veritas sug- gests they reside: within the inner reaches of the human psyche—that is, behind the gaze in the mirror. As Vergo and Dobai have suggested, Klimt probably read Wagner’s Beethoven. But whether he did or not, one cannot fail to notice that Wagner’s artistic vision, at once Schopenhauerian and yet dis- tinctly his own, permeated not only Klimt’s Secession-era work but a signifi- cant part of the creative culture of the Viennese fin de siècle, in large part because it was embodied, even literally enacted, in the composer’s music dra- mas. In Tristan und Isolde, as Eric Chafe has shown, Wagner produced what was perhaps his century’s most insistently inward-facing work, vividly em- bodying in his musical setting his Schopenhauer-inspired vision of transcen- dence achieved through the experience of romantic love.59 In Parsifal, as  58. Indeed, the logical step that Wagner took to connect these two aspects of Schopen - hauer’s work was so straightforward that even he seems not to have been entirely clear about where Schopenhauer’s theories ended and where his own began. In an entry recorded sometime in early July 1870 in his so-called “Brown Book” diary, Wagner, in outlining his plans for the Beethoven essay, seems to conflate the two: “Starting point: Schopenhauer: World as Will and [Representation] . . . Distinction in inwardly and in outwardly directed consciousness. This second is what music creates from. Great diversity, dream theory. . . . Interpretation of dreams. Music the direct dream image. The innermost power on which our poets unconsciously fed, whose presence they divined and sought to explain. . . . Beeth. = Schopenhauer: his music, translated into con- cepts, would produce that philosophy.” See Wagner, The Diary of Richard Wagner, 1865–1882: The Brown Book, ed. Joachim Bergfeld, trans.

For as we shall see, in the scenes of Hans Sachs’s composition lessons and Walther von Stolzing’s triumphal singing, Die Meistersinger stages the same theories of artistic creativity that Wagner laid out in his essay of 1870. With this in mind, I would also suggest that it is not far-fetched to regard Die Meistersinger as a sort of popular, fin-de-siècle Viennese lesson on the Wagnerian-Schopenhauerian metaphysics of creativity. For that very music drama was among the most frequently performed works at the Vienna Hofoper under Gustav Mahler’s direction, where it was staged eighty-two times during Mahler’s tenure from 1897 to 1907. That figure includes  seventy-two performances of the complete, uncut score, the Viennese pre- miere of which was given under Mahler’s baton in November 1899 to consid- erable critical acclaim and attention.61 Perhaps needless to say, considering the nature of the biographical record, we do not know if Klimt attended any of these performances. But it seems likely that he would have been aware, at least, of the loudly trumpeted complete productions given between 1899 and 1901, especially since he and Mahler had traveled in overlapping social circles since the time of Mahler’s arrival in the city in 1897. In one of her memoirs, Alma Mahler recalled a party at the Mahlers’ apartment circa 1905, at which Klimt was present and “a fierce argument broke out about Wagner.”62 And the journalist and famous socialite Bertha Zuckerkandl recorded a conversa- tion with Klimt shortly after 1900, during which the painter referred to his Viennese critics as “Beckmesser und Kompagnie.”63 As we shall see, in that 60.

Art and Dreams in Die Meistersinger It is now common, in the literature on Die Meistersinger, to identify the char- acter of Hans Sachs as an ideal Schopenhauerian man—and thus, some have suggested by extension, as an idealized self-portrait of Wagner.64 Almost all writers who make such claims identify Sachs’s Schopenhauerianism in one or the other of two dramatic aspects of the opera: in Sachs’s so-called Wahn or “madness” monologue delivered at the beginning of act 3, in which the char- acter draws upon Schopenhauerian imagery to depict humanity as a teeming bed of wicked, self-destructive beings; or in Sachs’s renunciation of his love- interest in Eva, which frees her to pursue her own romantic interest in Walther. This turn in the plot dramatizes Schopenhauer’s view that denying the sexual impulse is an important step toward quieting the will, as well as his conviction that self-sacrifice for the benefit of others lies at the heart of the truly ethical act.65 What I wish to focus on here, in contrast, is an aspect of Sachs’s Schopen-  hauerianism—or, more specifically, his Wagnerian Schopenhauerianism—that has passed practically unnoticed in the literature on the opera. This concerns the lessons in composition bestowed by Sachs upon his pupil Walther von Stolzing, which enact the very same Schopenhauer-derived ideas about  art and creativity described in Beethoven and depicted in Nuda Veritas.66 64. See, for instance, Lucy Beckett, “Sachs and Schopenhauer,” in Richard Wagner: “Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg,” ed.

Wagner seemed, moreover, to identify himself with the character of Sachs during the period of the com- pletion and first performance of Die Meistersinger. See his letters to King Ludwig II of  22 November 1866 and 20 June 1868, in Selected Letters of Richard Wagner, ed. and trans.

The foundations of Schopen hauer’s system of ethics and its crucial idea of Mitleid or compassion, enacted in Parsifal, is found in World as Will and Representation 1:367–78; Die Welt als Wille, SW 2:434–46. Schopenhauer’s notion of charity or “loving kindness,” which preaches self-sacrifice for the bene- fit of others, receives its most direct and detailed treatment in his On the Basis of Morality, trans.

To my knowledge, only two writers have noted a connection between Schopenhauer’s dream-theories and Sachs’s composition lessons, and neither has explored the connection in de- tail. See Magee, Tristan Chord, 253–55; and Schild, “Kunst als Wahrtraumdeuterei,” 430–31. My own investigation of this issue deeply indebted to Magee’s provocative suggestions. </page> <page sequence="23"> Wagner, Klimt, and the Metaphysics of Creativity in fin-de-siècle Vienna 669 Attention to these scenes is crucial both to what I would suggest is Wagner’s intended philosophical message in the work (given the huge amount of musi- cal and dramatic space he devotes to elaborating it) and also to our under- standing of the reception of Wagner’s legacy by Klimt and other artists of his time. To grasp this point, we need to examine the story of Sachs and Walther as it unfolds across three sections of Die Meistersinger: first, Walther’s audition before the Meistersingers in act 1, scene 3, and Sachs’s reflections on that per- formance in act 2, scene 3; second, Sachs’s instructions, related to Walther, on the art of composition in act 3, scene 2, which culminate in the “christening” of Walther’s newly composed “prize song” and the ecstatic quintet that fol- lows; and third, Walther’s triumphant appearance before the Meistersingers in act 3, scene 5, in which he secures entry into their ranks and the hand of his beloved Eva. Walther’s first appearance before the guild of Meistersingers (act 1, scene 3) is, as is well known, essentially a love-drunk miscalculation. Enamored by the sight of Eva, he learns that her father, himself a Meistersinger, will give her hand to the winner of an upcoming singing competition among the guild’s bachelor members. Hearing this, Walther immediately decides to audition, even though, as his discussion with the apprentice David reveals, he has had no formal training as a singer. Before his audition begins, Walther introduces himself to members of the guild with “Am stillen Herd” (“At the quiet hearth”). In response to the Masters’ intermittent questioning (enabled  musically by a device Werner Breig calls “interrupted song”), the aspirant Walther claims to have been taught by the legendary poet Walther von der Vogelweide—highly respected, though long dead—and to have learned to sing “in the forest at Vogelweide” (“im Wald dort auf der Vogelweid’ ”;  Ex. 1).67 Walther’s account of his education is, so to speak, “for the birds”—in German, Vögel. He has never had any formal training, and he is called on this fact by Sixtus Beckmesser, a member of the guild, who indulges in a mocking series of puns on the name of Walther’s supposed teacher. “Oho!” Beckmesser exclaims in disbelief. “So you’ve learned your Masters’-songs from finches and titmice?” (“Oho! Von Finken und Meisen / lerntet Ihr Meister Weisen?”) After making this inauspicious introduction, Walther begins the audition itself with a spontaneously concocted song (“Fanget an!” or “Begin!”), which con- summately reveals his utter lack of musical erudition. After thus singing, he is dismissed unceremoniously. However, the music to which he made his intro- duction will hardly disappear from the opera. The real significance of Walther’s disastrous audition becomes apparent only halfway through the next act, where it is revealed in both text and music.

Sitting alone in his cobbler’s shop, Sachs finds himself struck by an uncanny aspect of Walther’s improvised audition-song. Noting that, however strange and incomprehensible it had sounded at the time, the feeling aroused in him by Walther’s singing has simply refused to leave his mind, he observes: Ich fühl’s, und kann’s nicht versteh’n; I feel it, but I can’t understand it; kann’s nicht behalten, I can’t hold on to it, doch auch nicht vergessen: but I also can’t forget it; und fass ich es ganz, and if I grasp the whole of it, kann ich’s nicht messen! I can’t take its measure! Though Walther’s singing had broken every rule and made no rational sense, there was, nonetheless, something in it that resonated deeply with Sachs’s own experience of being. As he continues to ponder this situation, Sachs recalls, perhaps unconsciously, Beckmesser’s punning on the word Vogel. Only now, Sachs inverts Beckmesser’s mocking intention. “It sounded so old and yet was so new,” Sachs remarks on Walther’s song, “like birdsong in sweet May” (“Es klang so alt, und war doch so neu, / wie Vogelsang im süßen Mai”). Then, he hits upon the Wagnerian-Schopenhauerian essence of the thing: Walther “sang as he had to! And as he had to, so he could. I noticed </page> <page sequence="25"> Wagner, Klimt, and the Metaphysics of Creativity in fin-de-siècle Vienna 671 that especially.” Revealingly, as Sachs sings these lines, the orchestra recalls the music of “Am stillen Herd” with which Walther had first identified himself to the Masters as a “student” of the long-departed Walther von der Vogelweide, and thus as someone entirely lacking in formal training. This passage is given in Example 2, where the orchestral accompaniment echoes the very melodic line to which Walther had pronounced the name of his supposed teacher in Example 1. As his boastful statements in “Am stillen Herd” unwittingly made clear, and as his disastrous performance of “Fanget an!” confirmed, Walther’s audi- tion song had emanated from somewhere near the core of his being, from an imaginative place untouched by the outside world, its teachers, and its compo- sitional rules. And now, in the cobbler’s shop, the juxtaposition of Sachs’s soli- tary reflections with the orchestral reminiscence from that same introduction reveals to us that the uncanny nature of Walther’s singing was itself a result of its inward-facing source. A direct outpouring from the depths of Walther’s psyche, Walther’s song resonated, like an echo of the Schopenhauerian will, with Sachs’s own ineffable experience of being. It was, like the music of Wagner’s Beethoven essay, a clairvoyant art, a metaphysical music of dreams. In act 3, Walther, since taken in by Sachs, finally receives formal instruction from the Meistersinger. And in his lessons, these Schopenhauerian resonances are made explicit. The second scene of that act opens with Walther telling Sachs that he had had “a wondrously beautiful dream” the previous night. To this, Sachs replies: “That bodes well. Tell it to me!” (Ex. 3a). Sachs then launches into a lesson in composition that might be taken directly from Wagner’s Beethoven, Schopenhauerian terminology and all: Mein Freund, das grad’ ist Dichters Werk, My friend, it is precisely the poet’s task daß er sein Träumen deut’ und merk’. to interpret and record his dreams. Glaubt mir, des Menschen wahrster Wahn Believe me, man’s truest madness wird ihm im Traume aufgetan: is revealed to him in dreams. All’ Dichtkunst und Poeterei All versifying and poetry ist nichts als Wahrtraum-Deuterei. is nothing but the interpretation of  dreams of reality. “Tell me your morning-dream” (“Erzählt mir Euren Morgentraum”), Sachs urges, continuing his lesson. At one point, Walther broaches the subject of the Meistersingers’ seemingly endless list of compositional rules, but Sachs quickly sets him back on track. “You make them [the rules] yourself,” Sachs assures him, “and then you follow them. Think of your beautiful dream this morn- ing” (see Ex. 3b). As Walther thus begins to sing, revealing in music his inner dream-vision, Sachs cheers him on: “You’ve rhymed it so well, I can’t tell the difference between what you’ve composed and what you’ve dreamt”  (Ex. 3c).68 And as before, Wagner’s orchestra highlights the true significance 68. “Auch weiß ich noch nicht, so gut ihr’s gereimt, / was Ihr gedichtet, was Ihr geträumt” (act 3, scene 2). </page> <page sequence="26"> 672 Journal of the American Musicological Society Example 2 Die Meistersinger, act 2, scene 3, mm. 349–360.

Walther stops, asking his teacher why he must pro- ceed with a literal repetition of the first stanza’s music. To this, Sachs responds: “So that one can see you’re choosing a wife to marry” (“Damit man seh’ / ihr wähltet Euch gleich ein Weib zur Eh’ ”). In Sachs’s response, we find encapsulated what one might call, after Walter Frisch, the ambivalent modernism that characterizes so much both in and about Die Meistersinger: “admiring and fostering the new,” in Frisch’s words, while simultaneously “clinging fervently to the past out of a sense that the past . . . was an essential part of the German character that could not be aban- doned.”69 After all, Sachs reasons, if Walther hopes to win the Meistersingers’ contest and, thereby, Eva’s hand in marriage, he must construct his song, born of dream-inspiration, according to the rules by which the Meistersingers will judge his performance. He must, in other words, strike a balance between in- novation and tradition, a balance embodied in what Carl Dahlhaus describes as the “interlocking of the willfully archaic and the modern” throughout the 69.

Bach. </page> <page sequence="29"> Wagner, Klimt, and the Metaphysics of Creativity in fin-de-siècle Vienna 675 opera as a whole.70 But Sachs’s instructions, I would argue, also echo Wagner’s statements in the Beethoven essay. For the primary function of the rules, as Sachs explains it, is to make the musical expression of Walther’s dream-vision comprehensible to those who did not experience it directly. Those rules comprise, in other words, the common grammar according to which Walther’s vision must be translated, via the morning-dream, into an  “allegorical language” that our waking consciousness can apprehend. In act 1, Walther’s audition-song was a spontaneous utterance of his inner being, and none in the audience could make heads or tails of it. In preparing now for  the contest upcoming in the opera’s finale, Sachs counsels Walther on the im- portance of translating his dream-vision into a familiar, and thus intelligible, language.71 At the end of Walther’s apprenticeship with Sachs (act 3, scene 4), Wagner’s theory regarding dreams and creativity is powerfully recapitulated  by all of the characters associated with the Sachs household. Once again in- voking Schopenhauer’s terminology explicitly, Sachs “christens” Walther’s new composition the “Blessed Morning-Dream Interpretation Song” (selige Morgentraum-Deutweise; Ex. 4), to the accompaniment of the harmonic dream-motive that we saw in Example 3, here made especially salient by the grand pause that precedes it. After this, Sachs and Walther, along with Eva, the apprentice David, and David’s love-interest Magdalena, join together in a quintet, in which each reflects upon his or her individual concerns and invokes the image of the morning-dream. “Is it only a morning-dream?” Eva asks, imagining her future with Walther; “in my bliss I can hardly interpret it  myself.” “It was a beautiful morning-dream,” sighs Sachs, thinking wistfully of his love for Eva, renounced just moments earlier; “I hardly dare interpret it now.” “It is only a morning-dream,” utters David in disbelief at his unex- pected promotion by Sachs to the level of journeyman; “What I see I can hardly grasp.”72 Magdalena is the last of the five to recite, in immediate suc- cession, the word Morgentraum, and as she does so Wagner gives us, in the or- chestra, one  to A–D  6–A  final statement of the dream-motive, here transposed up a fourth(Ex. 5). In the final scene of the opera, the Meistersingers’ competition gets under- way. When it is Walther’s turn to sing, he begins his “Morning-Dream Interpretation Song” precisely as he had in Sachs’s workshop. Only a few lines 70.

The Meistersingers’ rules can also, of course, profitably be examined as literal composi- tional guidelines. For a recent attempt at such an interpretation, see William M.

Singing now in what we are supposed to take as spontaneous improvisation,73 Walther once again leaves his audience wondering about his meaning. But this 73. The improvisatory nature of Sachs’s singing is difficult to believe, given the complex na- ture of both the text and the music he conjures. Along these lines, Dahlhaus describes the suppos- edly spontaneous composition of Walther’s songs as “an illusion” that reveals the “paradox” at the heart of “Wagner’s fundamental aesthetic conviction, which he shared with Kant . . . that art, in order to be art, must conceal itself and appear in the guise of nature. The means and expedients must not be allowed to be visible, reflection must be transformed into spontaneity, immediacy must be recreated and still be immediacy, and every trace of effort must be expunged. The para- dox is that it takes technique to deny technique.” See Dahlhaus, Richard Wagner’s Music Dramas, 69–70. In a similar vein, Eckhard Roch has examined the evidently fictive nature of what he calls the “inspiration-myth” (Inspirationsmythos) that Wagner cultivated with respect to his own work, and which is arguably dramatized in Die Meistersinger; see Roch, “ ‘Ein Kind ward hier geboren  . . .’; Zur Dialektik von Kunst und Kunsttheorie in Richard Wagners Meistersingern,” in Achtet mir die Meister nur! “Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg” im Brennpunkt, ed.

And significantly, the way in which it achieves this effect could hardly be more Schopenhauerian, for the entire as- sembled audience of Meistersingers and onlookers alike responds to Walther’s song in precisely the same way Sachs had responded earlier, in his cobbler’s workshop, to his memory of Walther’s audition. “Lulled as in the most beauti- ful dream,” the audience members sing together, “I hear it well but I can hardly grasp it!” (“Gewiegt wie in den schönsten Traum, / hör’ ich es wohl, doch fass’ es kaum!”). But although they cannot grasp intellectually the sub- stance of Walther’s singing, the musical language in which the listeners give voice to their impressions reveals an intuitive understanding of the music that surpasses their rational comprehension of it. For as Walther’s song draws to a close, the crowd proclaims its verdict to melodic lines drawn directly from the Abgesang of Walther’s bar-form improvisation. Example 6a shows Walther’s Abgesang, and Example 6b gives the crowd’s response, in which the townsfolk intone Walther’s opening arpeggiated figure (G–C– singers its chromatically descending answer (G–F –F   E–G) and the Meister -). Though unable to describe the structure or articulate the meaning of Walther’s improvised song, every member of the audience immediately and intuitively recognizes it, as his or her spontaneous echoing of its melodies  reveals, as an expression of things either felt or experienced him- or herself. Walther’s “Morning-Dream Interpretation Song,” in other words, touches upon something common to all who inhabit the world of Die Meistersinger, even though that thing is beyond the capacity of reason to comprehend. In his dreaming, we are meant to understand, Walther came into contact with a uni- versal, essential truth, something akin to the Schopenhauerian will.

Afterwards, the audience’s spontaneous, in- tuitive echo of his song confirms the universality of its substance. It reveals in tones the identity of the will within every individual, as translated into the alle- gorical language of music. It is Schopenhauer, creatively interpreted by Wagner and enacted in music drama. Dreams and Madness in the Beethoven Frieze The duality inherent in Wagner’s mature view of artistic creativity—the con- viction that artistic vision originates within the depths of the unconscious mind, and its pairing with a belief that the substance of that vision resonates with the experience of all individuals—found perhaps its boldest expression  at the turn of the century in another work by Klimt, the Beethoven Frieze. Created for the Secession’s fourteenth exhibition in the spring of 1902, the Beethoven Frieze unites the inward-directed gaze prescribed in Sachs’s compo- sition lessons and depicted in the Nuda Veritas with another aspect of the Meistersinger’s Schopenhauerian worldview not yet considered, one evident in Sachs’s famous Wahn or “madness” monologue of act 3, scene 1. In that number, among the most widely discussed in the opera, Sachs gives voice to his conviction that the nature of the thing that joins all individuals—the con- stantly striving, ever-hungry will—is the source not only of human suffering but also of human wickedness. Indeed, he muses, suffering and wickedness are two sides of the same coin, together comprising the Wahn or madness that characterizes human existence as a whole. After beginning with the famous line, “Wahn, Wahn, everywhere Wahn,” Sachs reflects: “To the point of draw- ing blood, people torment and flay each other in useless, foolish anger. No one receives reward or thanks for it. Though driven to flight, one imagines he is hunting. . . . He imagines he is giving himself pleasure, when really he is tearing into his own flesh.”74 The essence of humankind, Wagner declares through the voice of Sachs, comprehends not only the beauty exuded by Walther’s love-filled melodies, but also something violent, even horrifying. This latter duality too, I would suggest, is exquisitely captured in Klimt’s Beethoven Frieze. The exhibition at which Klimt’s homage to Beethoven was unveiled was unique for the Vienna Secession. Breaking from prior practice, the group’s 74. “gar bis aufs Blut / die Leut’ sich quälen und schinden / in unnütz toller Wut! / Hat keinen Lohn / noch Dank davon: / in Flucht geschlagen / wähnt er zu jagen . . . wenn er sich wühlt ins eig’ne Fleisch / wähnt Lust sich zu erzeigen!” (act 3, scene 1).

The latter, he wrote, was inspired by Wagner’s Gesamtkunstwerk, or “what Wagner strove for and attained in his music dra- mas.”76 As Marian Bisanz-Prakken has documented, Roller and his colleagues, inspired in turn by Klinger and the experiments of the Scottish artist Charles Mackintosh especially, attempted to demonstrate in the exhibition that the Secessionists were capable of creating a Raumkunstwerk on an unprecedented scale.77 The result, as one contemporary critic observed, was a show that re- sembled not a typical art-exhibition but a veritable “Beethoven temple” (Beethoventempel ).78 Or, as Schorske famously observed in a more cynical vein, “If there ever was an example of collective narcissism, this was it: artists (Secessionists) celebrating an artist (Klinger) celebrating a hero of art (Beethoven).”79 One could, of course, take any number of interpretive tacks in a considera- tion of Klimt’s contribution to the “Klinger–Beethoven” exhibition, as it was billed.80 Indeed, the rich exegetical tradition surrounding the Beethoven Frieze 75. On the exhibition, see especially Bisanz-Prakken, Gustav Klimt, “Der Beethovenfries,” 9– 30; idem, Heiliger Frühling, 133–39; Comini, Changing Image of Beethoven, 387–415; and Nebehay, Gustav Klimt, 276–300. 76. “Was Wagner in seinen musikalischen Dramen anstrebte und erreichte.” Max Klinger, Malerei und Zeichnung (1891), in Malerei und Zeichnung: Tagebuchaufzeichnungen und Briefe, ed.

The history of the preservation and reconstruction of the Beethoven Frieze is complicated and interesting in itself, the work having disappeared from public view after the Secession’s  all-Klimt exhibition in 1903, not to resurface in its entirety until 1986. It is now on permanent display in the basement of the Secession building in Vienna.

There, we read that the frieze’s first panel depicts “the sorrows of feeble humanity,” which looks for assistance, in its “longing for happiness,” from a “well-armored knight as an external force,” and from “compassion and ambition as inner, striving forces.”81 In the second panel (Fig. 3), humanity’s longing for happiness encounters “hostile forces”: “the giant Typhon, against whom even the gods fought in vain; his daughters, the three Gorgons; Sickness, Madness, Death; Unchasteness and Lust, Immoderation; Nagging Grief.” Yet in spite of the forces arrayed against them, the program continues, “the longings and hopes of men fly over and beyond” such hostile things. On the left-hand side of the third and final panel, “the longing for happiness finds repose in poetry.” And at its end (as we saw in Figure 2), “the arts lead us to an ideal kingdom in which alone we find true joy, true happiness, and true love; a choir of paradise-angels; ‘Freude, schöner Götterfunke’ [sic]; ‘Diesen Kuß der ganzen Welt!’ ”82 In the literature, the Beethoven Frieze and its catalogue-program have been interpreted most often as allegorical commentaries on the hostilities faced by the modern artist (the well-armored knight) in an uncomprehending society. The identity of that artist is generally posited to be Klimt himself, then in the midst of scandal over his paintings for the great aula of the University of Vienna, though it might also be Wagner, Beethoven, or Mahler.83 In a partic- 81. For full-color reproductions of the first panel of the frieze, see Bouillon, Klimt: Beethoven, 30–33; and Koja, Gustav Klimt: The “Beethoven Frieze,” 30–31. 82. The identity of the program’s author is unclear. Its full text is as follows: “Erste Langwand, dem Eingang gegenüber: Die Sehnsucht nach Glück. Die Leiden der schwachen Menschheit: Die Bitten dieser an den wohlgerüsteten Starken als äußere, Mitleid und Ehrgeiz als innere treibende Kräfte, die ihn das Ringen nach dem Glück aufzunehmen bewegen. Schmal-  wand: Die feindlichen Gewalten. Der Gigant Typhoeus, gegen den selbst Götter vergebens kämpften; seine Töchter, die drei Gorgonen. Krankheit, Wahnsinn, Tod. Wollust und Unkeusch - heit, Unmäßigkeit. Nagender Kummer, Die Sehnsüchte und Wünsche der Menschen fliegen darüber hinweg. Zweite Langwand: Die Sehnsucht nach Glück findet Stillung in der Poesie.

Chor der Paradiesesengel. ‘Freude, schöner Götterfunke.’ ‘Diesen Kuß der ganzen Welt!’ ” (Max Klinger—Beethoven: XIV. Kunstausstellung, 25–26.) 83. The idea that the figure of the knight might represent Mahler derives from the fact that Klimt contributed a reproduction of that figure to Paul Stefan’s book Gustav Mahler: Ein Bild seiner Persönlichkeit in Widmungen (Munich: R. Piper &amp; Co., 1910). On the circumstances surrounding this contribution, see Ute Jung-Kaiser, “Gustav Klimts verschlüsseltes Mahler- Bildnis,” Archiv für Musikwissenschaft 55 (1998): 252–62. Although Klimt’s contribution does not imply—to my mind, at least—that the painter intended the knight to represent Mahler either in 1902 or in 1910, the image of the knight has been identified with the composer, with Klimt,  or with the two of them together, united in struggle, in almost every major study of the frieze. See, for instance, Bisanz-Prakken, Gustav Klimt: Der “Beethovenfries,” 37–39; Bouillon, Klimt: Beethoven, 44–47; Comini, Changing Image of Beethoven, 401; and Stephan Koja, “ ‘. . . just about the nastiest women I have ever seen . . .’ Gustav Klimt’s Beethoven Frieze: Evolution and Programme,” in Koja, Gustav Klimt: The “Beethoven Frieze,” 100–101. </page> <page sequence="37"> Wagner, Klimt, and the Metaphysics of Creativity in fin-de-siècle Vienna 683 Figure 3 Klimt, Beethoven Frieze, “the hostile forces,” detail from second panel.

More recently, another scholar has suggested that both  program and frieze seem to depict episodes from Goethe’s Faust.84 What I want to focus on in the remainder of this article is something over- looked in all of these studies, and that brings us back to the world of Schopen-  hauer, Die Meistersinger, and the Nuda Veritas. For significantly, the Secession 84. On the affinities between the published program for the frieze and Wagner’s 1846  program notes, see Bisanz-Prakken, Gustav Klimt: “Der Beethovenfries,” 32–34. Her reading  along those lines has been widely repeated, as in Bouillon, Klimt: Beethoven, 26–28, and Koja,  “ ‘. . . just about the nastiest women,’ ” 93–96. Wagner’s program is in “Bericht, über die Aufführung der neunten Symphonie von Beethoven im Jahre 1846 in Dresden, SS 2:50–64; trans. William Ashton Ellis as “Beethoven’s Choral Symphony at Dresden,” in Richard Wagner’s Prose Works 7:239–55. A more recent and compelling translation, by Ian D. Bent, is provided in Music Analysis in the Nineteenth Century, ed. Bent, 2 vols., 2:57–68 (Cambridge: Cambridge Uni versity Press, 1994). On the Beethoven Frieze and Goethe’s Faust, see Clare A. P. Willsdon, “Klimt’s Beethoven Frieze: Goethe, Tempelkunst and the Fulfilment of Wishes,” Art History 19 (1996): 44–73. It should be noted that the arguments advanced by Willsdon and Bisanz-Prakken are by no means mutually exclusive, since Wagner’s program itself borrows heavily from Faust. On the latter point, see Bent’s translation of Wagner’s essay, in which borrowings from Faust are noted throughout; and Nicholas Vazsonyi, “Beethoven Instrumentalized: Richard Wagner’s Self-Marketing and Media Image,” Music and Letters 89 (2008): 207–10. </page> <page sequence="38"> 684 Journal of the American Musicological Society program lists, and the first panel of Klimt’s frieze depicts, not only the physical strength (the “external force”) embodied in the figure of the knight, but also three other forces posited to motivate human behavior. And each of these  latter forces is internal in nature, either spiritual or psychological: longing for happiness; compassion; and ambition. Moreover, with the possible exception of the Greek god Typhon, depicted by Klimt as a giant ape-like being, all of the “hostile forces” shown in the frieze’s second panel—madness, lust, nag- ging grief, and so on—are likewise forces within ourselves. Finally, the king- dom or Reich attained through victory over these hostile forces is not one of material wealth, social prestige, or political power, but one of joy, happiness, and love. I would argue, therefore, that the Beethoven Frieze depicts not so much Klimt’s overt struggle against his critics or the literal unfolding of Beethoven’s symphony, but psychic forces essential to and experienced by all human beings. It depicts, in symbolic, allegorical fashion, a psychic universal that lies behind (or within) the manifest particularity of individual men and women. What Schopenhauer described over a half century earlier in The World as Will and Representation we find “reflected” in the Beethoven Frieze: “the inner nature of the whole of mankind.” Its images are the stuff of the col- lective dream-world tapped by Walther von Stolzing in Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, here saturated with Sachs’s Wahn-vision and translated by Klimt into the allegorical language of anthropomorphic, sometimes nightmarish fig- ures. In these latter figures, both blissful and ghastly, we find revealed the “true face” reflected in the mirror held by the Nuda Veritas, the visage of Secession architect Otto Wagner’s modern man.85 To pursue this line of interpretation further, I would suggest that Klimt’s ape-like rendering of Typhon, the only figure in the Beethoven Frieze explicitly linked to Greek mythology, might in fact be regarded as the most explicitly Wagnerian-Schopenhauerian image in the work. Though it has often been suggested that Klimt’s well-known fascination with Greek mythology derives in large part from Nietzsche’s engagement with it in The Birth of Tragedy (1872), we should not forget the fact that there is no evidence, either docu- mentary or anecdotal, to suggest that Klimt ever read Nietzsche’s work—just as we noted earlier with respect to Schopenhauer’s.86 And even if we assume 85. My interpretation of the frieze thus stands in marked contrast to the extremes to which some writers have taken their attempts to read Klimt’s biography in the work. The figure described in the program as “nagging care,” for instance, is posited to represent the artist’s fear of syphilis in both Bouillon, Klimt: Beethoven, 72–73; and Koja, “ ‘. . . just about the nastiest women,’ ” 96. 86. The only study of which I am aware to hypothesize a clear line of transmission of Nietzsche’s ideas to Klimt is Timothy W. Hiles, “Gustav Klimt’s Beethoven Frieze, Truth, and The Birth of Tragedy,” in Nietzsche, Philosophy, and the Arts, ed. Salim Kemal, Ivan Gaskell, and  Daniel W. Conway, 162–86 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998). To my mind, how- ever, Hiles’s argument is unpersuasive. Invoking William J. McGrath’s classic study of Viennese student culture in the 1870s and 1880s, Hiles suggests that Nietzsche’s ideas “would have been apparent in Vienna throughout [Klimt’s] early career, not only through organizations such as the Rede Klub within the [University of Vienna’s] Leseverein der deutschen Studenten Wiens, but </page> <page sequence="39"> Wagner, Klimt, and the Metaphysics of Creativity in fin-de-siècle Vienna 685 that he had read the book, we should remember that Nietzsche strove, in The Birth of Tragedy, not to inspire an interest in ancient myth out of antiquarian or philological concerns, but as a means of addressing what he regarded as a “seriously German problem.”87 Specifically, by revisiting the myths of Apollo and Dionysus, Nietzsche hoped to help his contemporary Germans to acquire a deeper understanding of their own, distinctly modern cultural dilemmas. In Nietzsche’s view, mythology was relevant to—indeed, needed by—the mod- ern world precisely because it embodied essential, timeless truths about hu- manity as a whole, truths that were all too easily ignored or forgotten amidst his nation’s rush for political unification and scientific advance.88 And, like much in The Birth of Tragedy, this latter position was at once both Schopen - hauerian and deeply Wagnerian. As Wagner wrote in Opera and Drama (1851), anticipating his setting of Der Ring des Nibelungen and spelling out his view of the psychological utility of myth in the modern world, in ancient myth one “instinctively apprehends nothing other than his own human essence. . . . The incomparable thing about myth,” he continued, “is that it is true for all ages, and its content . . . is eternally inexhaustible.”89 Recasting his position in Schopenhauerian terms ten years later, he explained that the mythic tale “places the mind in that dream-like state in which it comes to full clairvoyance [Hellsehen] and per- ceives a new coherence in the world’s phenomena.”90 In Parerga and also through publications and lectures which explained the heroic ability of the artist as repre- sented in Wagner and interpreted by Nietzsche.” Klimt’s Philosophy, Hiles continues, thus con- veyed his “sympathy with the young intellectuals of the university.” And, “with the Beethoven Frieze, Klimt attempted to clarify his relationship with popular Nietzschean theory” (175). Klimt, however, was never a university student. And the Leseverein’s Rede Klub, though an important intellectual incubator for the political activist Victor Adler and some others of his generation, was nonetheless a tiny organization without much of a presence beyond the university itself (it had only thirty members at the height of its activities). Moreover, the activities of the Leseverein peaked just before it was dissolved in 1878, nearly two decades before Klimt’s abandonment of historicism and nearly a quarter century before he created either Philosophy or the Beethoven Frieze. On the Leseverein and its Rede Klub, see McGrath, Dionysian Art and Populist Politics in Austria, 32–83. I take my figure for Rede Klub membership from the Jahresbericht des Lesevereines der deutschen Studenten Wiens über das VII. Vereinsjahr 1877–78 (Vienna: Selbstverlag des Lesevereines der deutschen Studenten Wiens, 1878), 29. Other studies to suggest Nietzsche as a source for Klimt’s interest in Greek mythology include Schorske, Fin-de-siècle Vienna,  221 and 227–31; and Lisa Florman, “Gustav Klimt and the Precedent of Ancient Greece,” Art Bulletin 72 (1990): 310–26. 87.

As he wrote in an essay of 1851: Perhaps as a consequence of the primary and original relationship of all the be- ings of this phenomenal world by means of their unity in the thing-in-itself, it is at any rate a fact that collectively [those beings] bear a similar type and, in the case of all of them, certain laws are laid down as the same. From this it is easy to see that not only can the most heterogeneous things be mutually explained or made clear, but also striking allegories are found even in descriptions where they were not intended. . . . More than anything else . . . the mythology of the Greeks has from the earliest times provided material for allegorical explanations and interpretations. . . . In fact it contains to a certain extent the archetypes of all things and relations which, precisely as such, always and everywhere make their appearance.91 For Wagner, Nietzsche, and Schopenhauer alike, mythologies reveal the Idea of man; they are essential, timeless expressions of human nature. And so we come to Typhon. For the ancient Greeks, Typhon was the god of wind and storm, an embodiment of the elemental forces of sky and sea. He was winged and typically depicted with serpents’ tails in place of legs, some- times with a human head (or heads) and face.92 In Schopenhauerian terms, Typhon was an embodiment of raw power, of unmediated will. But as the philosopher often emphasized, one need not look to the heavens or the seas to observe the effects of such elemental will, for the animal kingdom provides  us with innumerable examples in whichever direction we look. “Willing and striving are its whole essence,” Schopenhauer wrote of the animal, a willing that “can only be compared to an unquenchable thirst.” “Within the animal kingdom,” he continued, “every animal is the prey and food of some other,” and “every animal can maintain its own existence only by the incessant elimi- nation of another’s.”93 And just as Wagner’s Sachs observed in his Wahn 91. Schopenhauer, Parerga and Paralipomena 2:408 (translation modified). “Es mag eine Folge der Urverwandtschaft aller Wesen dieser Erscheinungswelt, mittelst ihrer Einheit im Dinge an sich, seyn; jedenfalls ist es Thatsache, daß sie sämmtlich einen ähnlichen Typus tragen und gewisse Gesetze sich als die selben bei allen geltend machen, wenn nur allgemein genug gefaßt. Hieraus wird es erklärlich, daß man nicht nur die heterogensten Dinge an einander erläutern, oder veranschaulichen kann, sondern auch treffende Allegorien selbst in Darstellungen findet,  bei denen sie nicht beabsichtigt waren. . . . Mehr als alles Andere jedoch hat von jeher die Mythologie der Griechen Stoff zu allegorischen Auslegungen gegeben; weil sie dazu einladet, indem sie Schemata zur Veranschaulichung fast jedes Grundgedankens liefert, ja, gewissermaaßen die Urtypen aller Dinge und Verhältnisse enthält, welche, eben als solche, immer und überall durchscheinen.” (Parerga und Paralipomena, SW 6:439–40.) 92.

The irrational, animalistic, Typhonic will is within us, devouring us and others as well through its ceaseless exer- tions, the most hostile forces of all.95 In the Nuda Veritas, Klimt invited us, like Sachs the teacher, to look into the mirror and thereby discover the truth within ourselves. Four years later, in the Beethoven Frieze, Klimt donned the role of Sachs in the Wahn monologue, showing us what we can expect to find if we gaze deeply enough. As Sebastian Gardner has recently shown, though without reference to the arts, the trou- bled image of humanity elaborated by Klimt and Wagner is only one among many aspects of late nineteenth-century Schopenhauerian thought that antici- pate the work of Sigmund Freud, penned at precisely the time when Klimt was creating his Secession-era paintings.96 And so it is no wonder that the Beethov en Frieze, just like Freud’s Interpretation of Dreams, caused a scandal when it was unveiled. Among fifteen articles on the frieze anthologized by the critic Hermann Bahr from contemporary newspapers in 1903, one describes  it as a “Wahngebilde” or madness-picture, another claims that it depicts Nahrung hat, und in welcher selbst wieder jedes Thier die Beute und Nahrung eines andern wird . . . indem jedes Thier sein Daseyn nur durch die beständige Aufhebung eines fremden erhalten kann.” (Die Welt als Wille, SW 2:367 and 175.) 94. Schopenhauer, On the Basis of Morality, 129. “Diese Tausende, die da, vor unsern Augen, im friedlichen Verkehr sich durcheinander drängen, sind anzusehen als eben so viele Tiger und Wölfe, deren Gebiß durch einen starken Maulkorb gesichert ist.” (“Ueber das Fundament der Moral,” SW, vol. 4, part 2, 194.) 95. It is worth noting that Klimt’s Typhon-symbol of pure willing would reappear a few years later in a work by Gustav Mahler, who conducted an arrangement of Beethoven’s Ode to Joy in the Klimt-Saal of the Secession’s fourteenth exhibition during a private showing the day before its opening. In its climactic third verse, the first movement of Mahler’s Das Lied von der Erde (1908), which sets an eighth-century Chinese text as interpreted by Mahler’s contemporary Hans Bethge, likewise invokes the image of an ape as a symbol of the Wahn lurking beneath the surface of osten- sibly tranquil human existence: “Look down below! In the moonlight on the headstones, a wild, ghastly figure is crouching. It’s an ape! Hear how his howling pierces the sweet fragrance of life!” (“Seht dort hinab! Im Mondschein auf den Gräbern / Hockt eine wild-gespenstische Gestalt. / Ein Aff ’ ist’s! Hört ihr, wie sein Heulen hinausgellt in den süssen Duft des Lebens!”) Also note Nietzsche’s characterization, in the first book of his Thus Spoke Zarathustra (1883), of what he re- garded as the essence of contemporary humanity: “Once you were apes, and even now, too, man is more ape than any ape”; ed. and trans.

Yet another contemporary writer characterized the frieze as a psychopathia pictoria.97 Robert Hirschfeld, a lead- ing music critic who taught aesthetics at the Vienna Conservatory, wrote that “this time Klimt produced a work of art that only three people will be able to assess: a doctor and his two orderlies.” And he went on to compare Klimt to the pioneering psychologist of sexuality, Richard von Krafft-Ebing.98 Needless to say, all of these charges were meant by their authors to disparage Klimt and his frieze. But the critics’ metaphors are revealing, for they all acknowledge, like the exclamations of the Nuremberg crowd after witnessing Walther von Stolzing’s prize-winning performance, that the images encountered in the Beethoven Frieze, however inexplicable they might seem, somehow hit upon something familiar, upon something essential and universal to the human psy- chic experience. As yet another contemporary critic, the sympathetic Ludwig Hevesi, observed, to look at Klimt’s rendering of “the monster Typhon” causes “a shock to our optic nerve, which we might almost call reflexive. The cause of the sensation is a mystery, and one must dig deeper to find out what lies behind it.”99 Conclusion: “The Inner Person Becoming Visible” We do not know why Klimt abandoned his historicist style of the 1880s for his “plunge into the self,” as Schorske describes it, which brought with it a shift to those allegorical, symbolic, and mythological modes of expression that charac- terized his work of the Secession years. In closing, we must note that there are many other possible sources of inspiration for the subjectivism of his turn-of- the-century work beyond those considered in this article, such as the paintings of the symbolist Arnold Böcklin, the popular German translations of philo- sophical and dramatic works by the Belgian Maurice Maeterlinck, or the po- ems of Richard Dehmel, which proved so influential on another member of the Mahler circle, Arnold Schoenberg.100 In his only surviving autobiographi- 97. Bahr, Gegen Klimt, 65–75. 98. Quoted in ibid., 68: “Klimt Produzierte diesmal wieder eine Kunst, nur drei Leute, ein Arzt und zwei Wärter, gerecht werden könnten. Klimt’s Fresken paßten für einen Krafft-Ebing- Tempel.” 99. Hevesi, Acht Jahre Sezession, 392: “Das ist der Unhold Typhoeus mit seiner Sippschaft von Lastern und Sünden jedes Namens. . . . Diese Schattenhälfte des Bildes, obgleich von ruhiger dunkler Tonwirkung, ist ein Gewimmel von seltsamen, meist dem Begriff von Gefieder entlehnten Formen und Nuancen, die im Sehnerven ein fast mechanisch zu nennendes Geprickel erregen. Es ist ein mysteriöser Reiz in dieser Empfindung, deren Elemente man sich erst hinterher genauer ansieht.” 100. On Böcklin’s influence upon German artists of the period, see, for instance, Shearer West, Fin de Siècle: Art and Society in an Age of Uncertainty (Woodstock, NY: Overlook, 1994), esp. 105–7. On Maeterlinck and Vienna, see Paul Gorceix, Maurice Maeterlinck: Le symbolisme de </page> <page sequence="43"> Wagner, Klimt, and the Metaphysics of Creativity in fin-de-siècle Vienna 689 cal statement, both tongue-in-cheek and frustratingly brief, Klimt avoided the subject of his creative development and simply asserted, “There is nothing special about me” (“An mir ist weiter nichts besonderes zu sehen”).101 And yet, this statement, though obviously penned in jest, captures something im- portant and common to all of the works considered in this article. For like Walther von Stolzing’s “Morning-Dream Interpretation Song” and Schopen - hauer’s writings on the will and dreams, so too do Klimt’s renderings of his  inner visions strive to capture essential human truths, truths transcendent of the principium individuationis, truths that are “nothing special” to any partic- ular person. In the end, I would argue that the affinities between the visions articulated by Klimt, Schopenhauer, and Wagner are not coincidental. For in a jotting by Nietzsche of early 1874, made in one of his many unpublished notebooks, the young philosopher reminds us of the powerful presence of one particular fig- ure in the creative consciousness of late-century German-speaking Europe, and of the role played by that figure’s artistic work in defining the philosophi- cal landscape of the age. The question Nietzsche pondered, from who knows where, was “whether in Wagner’s case one could speak of magnificent ‘nude figure music.’ ” In response, he observed that Wagner “has in mind the image of the inner person becoming visible, of the process of emotions that can be seen as motion; this is what he wants to represent: to grasp the will directly  in an extremely Schopenhauerian fashion.”102 When Nietzsche penned these words, of course, Wagner was still at the center of the philosopher’s world. But what is interesting here, in the present context, is the fact that Nietzsche la différence (Mont-de-Marsan, France: Éditions InterUniversitaires, 1997), 207–29.

This undated statement by Klimt, entitled “Commentary on a Nonexistent Self- Portrait” (“Kommentar zu einem nicht existierenden Selbstporträt”), is preserved, in typescript, at the Wienbibliothek im Rathaus, cat.

Friedrich Nietzsche, unpublished notebook, beginning 1874–Spring 1874 (Notebook 32 = U II 5a), in Unpublished Writings from the Period of Unfashionable Observations, ed. and trans. Richard T. Gray, in The Complete Works of Friedrich Nietzsche, vol. 11 (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1995), 327–28. Gray suggests, in his translator’s notes, that “Nietzsche is apparently thinking of a form of music that would invoke the nude poses (Act) of sculpture or painting. Cf. in this regard his reflections on the sculpturesque aspect of Aeschylus’s dramas” (454–55). Though plausible, Gray’s suggestion is, to my mind, not particularly illuminating. Another possibility is that Nietzsche is referring to Wagner’s remarks in the latter’s “Eine Mitteilung an meine Freunde” (1851), in which the composer describes myth as revealing the “real, naked man” (“der wirkliche, nackte Mensch”), as opposed to history, in which man’s “clothing interests us more than his actual figure” (Wagner, Sämtliche Schriften 4:312; Prose Works 1:358.) I am indebted to Holly Watkins for suggesting this possibility. </page> <page sequence="44"> 690 Journal of the American Musicological Society identified the composer as both a mediator and an interpreter of Schopen-  hauer’s work, and also that he explicitly linked Wagner’s distinct brand of Schopenhauerian metaphysics with the “inward turn” that was characteristic of so much of fin-de-siècle culture as a whole. As Dahlhaus has argued with respect to musical creativity around 1900 that the philosophical “complex” of Schopenhauer–Wagner–Nietzsche was  “characteristic of the epoch as a whole,” so I would argue that the influence of this philosophical triumvirate permeated the entire creative milieu.103 Common to all members of this trio was a questing for the essence of human nature and experience, and the conviction that the arts can shed light upon the matter. Schopenhauer’s writings were, in effect, the common denomina- tor for the work of all three. And Nietzsche was the period’s celebrated philo- sophical enfant terrible. But we must not forget that Wagner’s work played a crucial role in making the intertwined philosophical convictions of these fig- ures available to an audience of thousands, maybe millions—many of whom, like Klimt, probably never read either Schopenhauer or Nietzsche. After all, Wagner was not only a prolific synthesizer and interpreter of the ideas of his contemporaries and idols. He was also a brilliant composer, whose music dra- mas enacted his metaphysical convictions and brought them into the realm of popular culture. Works Cited Adorno, Theodor. In Search of Wagner.

Abstract This article takes a close look at a pair of well-known works by Gustav Klimt, the Nuda Veritas (1898) and the Beethoven Frieze (1902), and argues that the Schopenhauerian worldview evident in them testifies to the underappreciated influence of Richard Wagner on the Viennese artistic scene circa 1900. I begin </page> <page sequence="51"> Wagner, Klimt, and the Metaphysics of Creativity in fin-de-siècle Vienna 697 by isolating previously unnoticed strains of Schopenhauerian iconography  evident in the Nuda Veritas pertaining to the source and value of artistic cre- ativity. I proceed by demonstrating that Klimt’s peculiar use of that iconogra- phy conflicts with Schopenhauer’s own theories of art, although it hews closely to Wagner’s idiosyncratic interpretation of Schopenhauer’s ideas out- lined in his Beethoven essay and enacted in Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg. After surveying evidence of Klimt’s familiarity with Wagner’s works, I turn to Die Meisters inger, highlighting the unacknowledged ways in which that opera dramatically enacts Wagner’s theories of creativity. I conclude by suggesting that some of those same theories underlie the imagery of Klimt’s Beethoven Frieze, and by suggesting more broadly that the Beethoven Frieze and the Nuda Veritas testify to the vital role played by Wagner’s music dramas in me- diating and popularizing a quasi-Schopenhauerian worldview in the creative culture of the turn of the century.
