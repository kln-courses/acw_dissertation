One searched in vain for a rigorous, comprehensive, up-to-date, well-illustrated introductory history and ultimately had to settle for the still informative but now dated classics: Irving Sandler's The Tri- umph of American Painting (1970) or Dore Ash- tons The New York School: A Cultural Reckoning (1973). Equally frustrating has been the lack of an anthology of essential primary documents-key statements and essays by the artists and influential reviews and articles by critics and historians. But the pedagogical landscape appears to have changed dramatically: the publication in 1990 of three anthologies and a new introductory history marks progress toward filling these gaps in the academic textbook market. Have the needs of teachers and students now been adequately met? The field of New York School studies is too riven by disagreement and dispute for all needs to be satisfied by even this surge. When there is no consensus on such basic questions as which artists are Abstract Expressionists, which of their writings are significant, and what are the relative values of the various interpretative traditions that have grown up around this art, the business of compil- ing an anthology will be a hazardous enterprise. In such circumstances, a responsible anthologist must cultivate an unwaveringly critical self- consciousness and be entirely forthright about the premises, beliefs, and commitments that guided the selection of texts. To the extent that one in- dulges one's own intuitive judgments of impor- tance or quality or leaves the selection criteria unexplicated, the project's utility will be compromised-its values and intents will remain concealed. Clifford Ross's Abstract Expressionism: Creators and Critics suffers from an acute lack of critical self-consciousness. His stated purpose seems simple enough: "to present the most infor- mative writings by and about the Abstract Expres- sionists" (p. 9). Three-fourths of the book is de- voted to statements by the artists themselves, one-fourth to writings by critics through 1959. Looking through the table of contents, a reader is likely to question certain decisions-I wished, for example, that William Baziotes had been included, that Ad Reinhardt had not, and that room had been found for Robert Motherwell's "The Modern Painter's World" and Barnett Newman's "The First Man Was an Artist"-but overall the selection seems comprehensive enough to be broadly rep- resentative. Any reservations at this stage pale to inconsequence once one discovers that Ross has not limited his editing to the selection of texts: he has liberally abridged many of the documents he reprints. Often an important text is represented by the one or two sentences Ross finds most "in- formative." The result is predictable: familiar, overquoted passages are collected here, fre- quently deprived, as usual, of any larger, poten- tially illuminating textual frame. Some of the documents are simply travestied. Mark Rothko's fascinating, untitled short statement published in an exhibition pamphlet in 1945 is edited by Ross to one famous sentence (whose punctuation, incidentally, is incorrectly transcribed): "Rather be prodigal than niggardly, [sic] I would sooner confer anthropomorphic attributes upon a stone, than dehumanize the slightest possibility of consciousness" (p. 171).1 What Ross has deleted are three short but rich and complex preceding paragraphs in which Rothko attempted to define his artistic project and re- flected upon his ambivalence toward Surrealism and abstraction, cataloguing his debts to and de- partures from both. In 1945 these were issues of considerable importance to him, and the docu- ment is highly revealing for any historical account of the development of Abstract Expressionist aes- thetic and intellectual commitments. What is re- vealed about Ross's interests if he finds these paragraphs less informative than the rather self- serving affirmation of humanist values he chooses to reprint? As the question suggests, Ross's editing is tendentious. His handling of this Rothko text is one small indication of larger tendencies that plague the volume: disinterest in facilitating his- torical analysis of Abstract Expressionism and commitment to demonstrating its timeless univer- sality and high-mindedness. Insensitivity to his- tory is further indicated by the misdating of the Rothko statement; it is mistakenly assigned to 1950, apparently a result of confusing the title of the exhibition the pamphlet accompanied, A Painting Prophecy-1950," with the date of the exhibition and pamphlet, 1945. What is revealing is the fact that this misdating is much less conspic- uous than it would have been had the entire Roth- ko text been reprinted, for by 1950 Rothko had moved beyond the concerns articulated in the deleted paragraphs. This example is by no means anomalous here. There are so many egregious errors in this anthology that no document should be assumed to be immune. Newman's "The Sublime Is Now" (1948) is included in all three of the anthologies under review, which makes it an interesting test case. The other two volumes reproduce it fully and correctly. Ross seems to have intended to publish the essay unabridged, but roughly mid- way through itathirty-four-word passage is omit- ted, leaving a clause about the Cubists completely incoherent. Worse still, the climactic last para- graph is entirely missing. In Ross's version of the essay, Newman seems to have raised the question of how it is possible to make a sublime art in a ART JOURNAL 99</page><page sequence="2">culture without sublime legends or myths only to leave it hanging. A perspicacious reader may be able to locate the missing paragraph appended to the preceding reading, Newman's "The Plasmic Image" (1943-45), where Newman is portrayed as having moved from a description of the alle- giances and ambitions of "the new painter," in the third person, to a rousing first-person manifesto. This false, unhistorical ending is tacked onto a text that has been abridged from an already abridged version published in 1971.2 Following the logic of Newman and his colleagues is ordinarily difficult enough without having to work from dismem- bered and botched renditions. Fortunately, com- plete versions of these essays by Newman have recently appeared in Barnett Newman: Selected Writings and Interviews,3 to which scrupulous teachers and students will want to turn. Sloppiness aside, Abstract Expressionism: Creators and Critics gives us, through its excising of many obscure or difficult passages and topical references, a sanitized, dehistoricized, eviscerated picture of Abstract Expressionism. Furthermore, an unmistakable note of triumphalism lingers throughout, evident especially in the book's intro- duction. If this volume had been published twenty years ago, it might have had some value as a companion to Sandler's history; as a 1990 publica- tion it seems anachronistic and misguided, a valu- able opportunity missed. Another anthology, with a different focus, is Abstract Expressionism: A Critical Record- principally, as the title suggests, a collection of critical responses to Abstract Expressionism. The editors, David Shapiro and Cecile Shapiro, have assembled, in the book's longest section, a survey of the critical reception of the New York School over the past forty years; six shorter subsequent chapters concentrate on individual artists, giving a brief biographical chronology, a short essay ortwo by the artist, and a representative sampling of critical reactions. The elite collection of artists given special attention-Willem de Kooning, Adolph Gottlieb, Franz Kline, Newman, Jackson Pollock, and Rothko-requires some defense, particularly regarding the exclusion of Clyfford Still and Motherwell; none, however, is offered. If my test sample is a fair indicator, the documents reprinted here are rendered accurately and fully; the fact that the title is misspelled on the cover and the spine of the book-the first "t" in "Abstract" is left out-might lead one to expect otherwise. Although some of the selections are abridged, the editing seems minimal and judi- cious. The editors claim that their volume contains "most of the important statements made about Abstract Expressionism" (p. xi). What constitutes an "important" statement (does it differ from an "informative" one)? We are given two insights into the criteria that determined this selection. One is that range of opinion and inter- pretation is desired. The editors state that by their tabulation less than 10 percent of the critical litera- ture on Abstract Expressionism is negative. They have deliberately sought out "reasoned argu- ments attacking its assumptions," which they bal- ance with sympathetic assessments in an effort to illuminate the paintings from "as many angles as are needed to see them clearly" (p. xii). The collec- tion of interesting, unsympathetic essays, by Leon Golub, Cleve Gray, and others, is one of the vol- ume's valuable contributions and may help to rectify the underappreciation of these texts in Ab- stract Expressionist scholarship. More revealing in critical writing than verdicts are the manners in which works of art are described and represented; here, too, the editors have sought variety. They have tried to supplement some of the more fa- miliar essays by Abstract Expressionism's most prominent interpreters-principally Clement Greenberg and Harold Rosenberg-with less fa- miliar writings, such as Parker Tyler's rich essay on Pollock, and Frank O'Hara's on Kline. One might argue that this editorial strategy is not pursued energetically enough. The volume contains six texts by Greenberg and five by Rosenberg, while nowhere to be found are Maude Riley or Douglas MacAgy on Rothko, James Fitzsimmons on Pol- lock or de Kooning, or many others whose serious reviews and essays unfortunately have dropped out of the history of the New York School. And I do not understand why the major piece by Green- berg that the editors choose to include is the very early "Towards a Newer Laocoon" (1940), the only pre-1947 text in the volume, when only "Avant- Garde and Kitsch" (1939) is discussed at length in the editors' introduction, and when the later " 'American-Type' Painting" (1955) forms a much better contrast to Rosenberg's "The American Action Painters" (1952), which follows in the an- thology.4 Still, the selection overall is useful, pro- vocative, and ecumenical; the presentation of contrasting interpretations and evaluations should be effective in stimulating classroom discussions. The other insight the editors offer into their selection criteria stems from the distinction they posit between criticism and history: "The major critical works are all in. The responses to Abstract Expressionism when it was fresh and evolving have been written. Comments since then come under the heading of art history" (p. xi). The publication of this book is posited as demarcating the period of critical response, which the book summarizes, from the era of art-historical anal- ysis. This is patently a plug for the timeliness and significance of the volume, but it reveals worri- some premises. First, it assumes that the period from 1947 to 1990 can be taken as discrete and coherent with respect to attitudes toward Ab- stract Expressionism. Is it really not until 1990 (rather than 1960 or 1970?) that the tide turns and Abstract Expressionism comes to seem alien to viewers and commentators? The extended chron- ological field proposed here diffuses the focus of the book: it necessitates spotty coverage of the criticism and renders fragmentary any charting of historical and evolutionary developments within it; the survey races across dramatic changes in historical conditions and reigning aesthetics with- out taking notice. Second, is the criticism/history distinction sustainable at all? Unsurprisingly, it col- lapses around many of the essays included in the volume.5 That the editors invoke it tells us some- thing significant aboutthe type of writing that will be seen to belong to this anthology: what has traditionally been understood as "criticism," writ- ing that confronts the work of art "directly," un- mediated by historical consciousness. The distinc- tion arbitrarily divides the writing on Abstract Expressionism that falls within the period, exclud- ing, to cite just one example, the line of inquiry into the political content and effects of Abstract Expressionism developed by Max Kozloff, Eva Cockroft, Serge Guilbaut, and others-not least of whom are David Shapiro and Cecile Shapiro themselves.6 Is such work excluded because it is "history" and not "criticism"? Is this volume meant to be used in conjunction with Francis Frascina's anthology Pollock and After: The Criti- cal Debate (1985), which focuses specifically on the political dimensions of Abstract Expression- ism? If so, the claim to have presented "most of the important statements made about Abstract Expressionism" is compromised. The third of the new anthologies, Ann Eden Gibson's Issues in Abstract Expressionism: The Artist-Run Periodicals, is distinctly different from the other two. It was obviously conceived more as a scholarly reference work than as a sur- vey text. One of its purposes is to make more widely available a broad selection of writings from certain low-circulation, hard-to-find, artist-run magazines of the period 1946 to 1951: Icono- graph, Tiger's Eye, Possibilities, Instead, and Mod- ern Artists in America. Many of the Abstract Ex- pressionists contributed written and/or visual materials to one or more of these periodicals, which, Gibson contends, became "a forum in which the visual and the verbal operated in a dialectic and through which attitudes were articu- lated, developed, debated, and refined" (p.3). The volume contains a substantial introductory sec- tion sketching the history of each publication and situating each in relation to Abstract Expressionist ART JOURNAL 101</page><page sequence="3">participation and interests. A "Comprehensive In- dex to the Periodicals" at the back of the book will greatly facilitate scholarly research on the period. Ironically, although this book is in some ways the least suited for classroom use (among other things, there is no inexpensive paperback edition), it may be the one most valuable for such service. If one wants an anthology that provides a wide-ranging textual and cultural-historical frame for the writings and visual works of the Abstract Expressionists during a crucially important forma- tive period, one cannot do better at present than this volume. The interest of these artists in myth, for example, is illuminated by juxtaposition of their mythic subjects (Newman's Genesis-The Break, Richard Pousette-Dart's Cathedral-The Ascension) with essays on myth by Meyer Scha- piro, Andrea Caffi, John Stephan, and others. The continuities between the Abstract Expressionists and the wider artistic, literary, and intellectual world of New York in the 1940s are made evident, and serious historical analysis is facilitated. In such a context, the writings and paintings of the artists are freshly illuminated. Some readers might find that there is too much frame and not enough Abstract Expressionist material collected here. I was surprised to discover that Rothko's classic text "The Romantics Were Prompted" and Pollock's "My Painting," both from Possibilities, were not reprinted in this volume, though they are included in both the Ross and Shapiro anthologies. Gibson opted to reprint less familiar materials instead, which is, of course, sensible for a reference work; still, for pedagogical purposes, I wanted to see the classic essays reset in proximity to the literary and visual works that originally enframed them. There is much to be gained from such an exercise, as Gibson herself notes in the conclusion to her intro- ductory chapters: "I was originally attracted to this material because I believed that the subject matter of Abstract Expressionism would become more apparent when its context in these maga- zines was taken into account. I was not mistaken" (p. 57). Finally, David Anfam's Abstract Expres- sionism is not an anthology but a new, updated introductory textbook; it aspires, as the back cover text tells us, to be "a first concise account of the subject," one that takes "into account recent re- search that has transformed our understanding of the movement, . . . examines it in terms of its political implications and cultural context, [and brings] fresh insights to the works themselves." The book is indeed concise-roughly two hun- dred pages, profusely illustrated. In some respects it is too concise: its brevity is bought at the price of footnotes and bibliography. Not only does this limit the volume's value for academic use, it also seems somewhat arrogant given the touted de- pendence on innovative "recent research." The commitment to brevity also clashes with Anfam's decision to pursue breadth of coverage over con- centration. He includes analyses of early and late as well as "classic" works, treatment of not only painting but also sculpture (David Smith) and photography (Aaron Siskind), and a chapter map- ping the multifaceted legacy of Abstract Expres- sionism through the 1970s. Doing all this briefly requires that the author establish a brisk pace, which precludes careful consideration of complex issues. As a result, the book frequently cannot sustain close scrutiny. A few themes emerge as motivating and organizing principles of the study. As the cover promises, cultural context is one recurrent con- cern. Anfam's preferred cultural frame for Ab- stract Expressionist art is literary, constituted prin- cipally by contemporary fiction. Frequent and often illuminating references are made to works by William Faulkner, Norman Mailer, and others. Necessarily in a book of this length and scope, the effort to relate works of art to other historical and cultural developments operates at a level of ab- straction that holds limited value and credibility. Anfam, for example, detects a "traumatic zeit- geist" in the art (p. 20) that corresponds to a "strain of existential angst" in post-Depression America (p. 149). But by no means does he pro- pose to fully immerse Abstract Expressionism in its culture. A traditional, dual claim is made here, whereby the art both expresses and opposes or transcends its cultural context: while Pollock has "internalized the age's forces and then expressed them in bodily actions" (p. 189), Abstract Expres- sionism generally promotes resurrection, moral critique, and intensified experience, all antagonis- tic to the dominant tendencies of its society (pp. 144-46). Another persistent interest of the book is debunking accumulated myths and stereotypes surrounding the New York School. In some re- spects, this iconoclasm is refreshing: Anfam is skeptical of nationalist claims for this art, and he is critical of the traditional composition of the Ab- stract Expressionist roster. He shuffles the ranks a bit, elevating Still to the level of Pollock, demoting Baziotes, and making room for Lee Krasner- saying prejudice alone has kept her out (p.15), but offering little insight into the importance of her work. In other respects, his iconoclasm seems to blind him. As an author interested in cultural his- tory, Anfam has a rather unusual disregard for prior critical and historical writings. When he does not ignore them completely, he portrays them as largely misguided and distorting rather than as potentially illuminating historical documents (e.g., p. 135). Among those writers who are sin- gled out for particularly harsh treatment as propa- gators of misleading myths are Harold Rosenberg, Life magazine authors, and "slanted" Marxist in- terpreters (pp. 9-11). This is a serious mistake on all counts. It reveals an inability to recognize the insights into the art's cultural resonances offered by Rosenberg and the Life critics.7 Rather than analyze their myths, Anfam seeks to cut through them to "the truth" (p. 127), which can be seen if one will simply "look without prejudice" (p. 136). This phrasing suggests a failure of critical self- consciousness. Anfam's own analysis sometimes falls back upon the very myths he wants to chal- lenge, as when he fantasizes that the mood and forms of Still's paintings may have been inspired by "moments on the barren prairies, especially at night" (p. 138). Anfam is condescending toward the "slanted" scholarship investigating the political dimensions and implications of Abstract Expres- sionism. It is highly misleading that the book's cover (for which Anfam is probably not responsi- ble) proclaims this interest to be featured in the text, because the subject is never considered seri- ously; it is raised only to be caricatured and dis- missed. Anfam's position is that the art and artists are essentially apolitical: "no evidence has yet associated them with Cold War ideals" (p. 106), and furthermore, whether the involvement of the art in cultural imperialism abroad "reflected a con- spiracy or the coincidence of innovative art with a nation at the zenith of imperial power appears less consequential than that the artists never engi- neered it" (p. 174). This amounts to saying that if there was no conscious, complicitous intent on the part of the artists, there is nothing to discuss. That is not quite the model of rigorous scholarly analysis students should be encouraged to emu- late. A good survey text should represent contro- versial areas of scholarship with requisite difficulty and complexity; it should present not a seamless narrative but a multilayered one with fissures in all the necessary places. Too often Anfam settles for asserting specious resolutions to complicated is- sues hotly contested in the new scholarship his book professes to represent. In his introduction, Anfam says that we do not yet have much "historical distance" from Ab- stract Expressionism (p. 7), and indeed that is the sense one gets from reading his history of it. But given that by most accounts this art is securely positioned on the far side of the postmodern di- vide, its premises no longer tenable, are we not entitled to expect a thoroughly distanced, histori- cal appraisal? Anfam writes as though the art were hardly dated at all but rather still breathing fire, still undoing our boundaries between self and ART JOURNAL 103</page><page sequence="4">space (p. 16), still "fusing concrete and transcen- dent levels" (p. 185), as if these very categories had not become problematic for us. Although he con- sistently strives to situate the art in the culture of the 1940s and 1950s, he finds, in the end, that it really accomplishes more or less what its authors said it did: intensification of experience (p. 146), and representation of the "modern human pre- dicament" (p. 22). He means to resecure the pleni- tude of this work, its richness, its inexhaustibility (p. 13). A survey that truly took full account of recent scholarship on Abstract Expressionism would exhibit a much more profound realization of the art's untraversable distance from us and of the inability of its categories-of self, spirit, and authenticity, for example-to compel empathic identification. The art's historical character might then come into sharper focus. Until such a volume appears, survey course coverage of Abstract Ex- pressionism will continue to require resourceful- ness, ingenuity, and customized solutions. Notes 1.
