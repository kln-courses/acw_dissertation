<plain_text><page sequence="1">CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Vol. 15, No. 1, March 1974 ) 1974 by The Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research DISCUSSION AND CRITICISM On the Phylogenesis of the Speech Function by EARL W. COUNT Berekely, Calif., U.S.A. 19 x 72 Hewes (CA 14:5-12), Livingstone (CA 14:25-26), and Mourant (CA 14:30-31) treat different aspects of anthro- pology's most critical and, on the whole, most neglected problem: the phylogenesis of the speech function (herein- after "phasia"). Each article raises issues larger than its particular treatment; taken together, their horizon expands beyond the scope of a mere commentary. Each demands its special consideration; some closing remarks must apply to them all. It shall not be forgotten that each article is suggestive, not assertive. Each of them speculates upon speculations by others. Since we shall never possess any reconstruction of the phylogenesis of phasia that is other than speculation, any responsible speculation has the right to be taken seriously; every time a new level of speculation is added the "coeffi- cient of plausibility" must diminish by some statistical law. Long before this happens, in the present case, one must probe into the initial speculations: how valid are the factual conclusions from which they take off? At any and every juncture, the speculations themselves must be watched jealously: are there non sequiturs? are alternative possibil- ities given due consideration? At all events, suggestions (as Mourant is careful to state) cannot be promoted to scientific theory until they have been made amenable to disproof. It would be simple to try balancing between two conflict- ing speculations and asserting one's own preference-but unless there were facts that favored the one and undercut the other, it would not be objective to choose between them. Much of the following commentary, therefore, will concern the soundness of the original authorities, but space dictates that this be only selective. Hewes's argument essentially seems the following: By all indirect evidence, the australopithecines must have had the cognitive powers at least of the extant pongids and the signing capacities of a Washoe. At the same time, the call systems of alloprimates (my neologism for nonhuman primates) do not carry "voluntary" messages, for allopri- mates do not possess the "speech areas" present in the human cortex; nor-fide Geschwind-do they possess the cross-modal nonlimbic associative channels of man. Hewes doubts that these human requisites were fully present until the Neanderthal stage had been transcended. It must therefore have been the kind of hunting-party life affected by Homo sapiensthat generated the selection pressures which eventuated in the speech capacity. He believes that these selective pressures generated a "more precise tool and weapon manipulation, much greater terrain cognizance involving right-left consistency with respect to responses to visible landmarks, and the growth of a manual-gesture language," all associated with a predominant right-hand- edness and the functional dominance of the left cerebral hemisphere; granting, then, the temporal priority of ges- tural language over vocal language, hemispheral lateraliza- tion must be more ancient than phasia. The chimpanzees' capacity for gestural language is the (evolutionary) link between the non-speech of monkeys and the speech of man. Hewes skirts the question of a mouth-gesture language and believes the transit from a reliance on gesture to the emphasis on vocalization must have included "changes in the innervation of the lips, tongue, and larynx, and cortical linkages mediating between sounds and stored visual in- formation." He suggests that the ease with which we can decode the "gesture-like marks" that are letters may be based on the prehuman ability to decode gestures. This phylogenic reconstruction would serve to rationalize our use of gesture when we write or draw symbolically and our use of phonation when we exchange messages face to face. It is to Hewes's credit that he sees the evolution of phasia as ineluctably a joint problem of cerebral and behavioral evolution (which latters he casts as an ecological proposi- tion). His array of sources is catholic: neurological, primate- behavioral, linguistic. Admittedly, his space budget has him at a disadvantage; he can deal but suggestively with any and all of them, so the prima facie validity of each can appear unduly facile. None the less, their merits are genuinely uneven. Certain of them are more or less author- itative; others are secondary, their interpretations chal- lengeable. I have no intention of citing which are which. I have selected minimally from the first category, and then but to comment upon certain salient issues raised by Hewes's exposition. Geschwind's theory -of certain cortical differentiations presumably absent in alloprimates but present in man has drawn increasing attention from anthropologists and has been adopted as a basis for further speculation on the origins of phasia. Geschwind is an eminent neurologist. In matters strictly neurological, it were a presumption for any anthropologist to debate him; but when he speculates about human evolution, the anthropologist cannot defer. The issues are broader than a clinical neurology can cover, and the relevance of data from that discipline demands another frame of discourse for their appraisal. My neuro- logical acquaintances do not find all of Geschwind's conclu- sions beyond challenge, but I have yet to encounter an anthropologist who has done other than adopt them un- critically together with their author's deductions as to the neurology of an evolving phasia. I am not now challenging Geschwind, but I am concerned over anthropology as a sound science. Ours is a secondary, a derivative discipline. Its function is to effect an image of man synthesized from broader generalizations particularly applied. We constantly risk building upon unvalidated foundations from the pri- mary disciplines. The danger to us lies in the entrenchment Vol. 15 No. 1 March 1974 81</page><page sequence="2">when a second anthropologist builds on the reliances adopted by a predecessor and neither has exercised skepti- cism. This is occurring, at present, with the very challenge- able hunting-party hypothesis. One such piece of lore at a time is all we may have room for. Geschwind argues (1965:275): "It is only in man that associations between two non-limbic stimuli are readily formed and it is this ability which underlies the learning of names of objects." The prerequisite associations are between vision, audition, and somaesthesis, especially be- tween the first and second and the first and third. The brain features concern the inferior parietal lobule (angular and supramarginal gyri; roughly, Brodmann 39,40), which Geschwind says is absent in macaque and "rudimentary" in apes. It is a-thalamic, and myelinates late in childhood. That this is where cross-modal associations are effected is inferable in some sense from the fact that, if this region is impaired, the passage of "names" through Wernicke's area (which Geschwind prefers to define narrowly) is impaired; and it is this nodal position that effects arousal of the associations seated peripherally to it. Back of this conclusion lie assessments of experimental data on ma- caques from Ettlinger and others and the author's experi- ences with "disconnexion syndromes" in man. Under the particular experimental conditions, the macaques indicated an inability to make the modal transfer. Humans also demonstrated, at best, great difficulty. Geschwind concludes (p. 282 n): "In an illiterate society a lack of visual-auditory associations would not seriously inconvenience anyone ex- cept under unusual conditions. Unless I do him an injustice from misunderstanding, I am compelled to some caveats: (1) "Naming," in Gesch- wind's parlance, refers to the behavior elicited from a patient by the brain surgeon, from certain control faradic stimula- tions during an operation, and to the behavior of children when learning speech-code. Linguists possess yet other definitions. None of these, however, may be transferred uncritically to considerations of the origin and evolution of speech, for two reasons: (a) "The language in which information is communicated [within the brain] . . . nei- ther needs to be nor is apt to be built on the plan of those languages that men use toward one another" (McCul- loch 1965:56, cited by Pribram 1971: 1), and (b) "Even if the evolution of words should proceed from concrete to abstract terms, this would not disprove that mental devel- opment proceeds in the opposite direction" (Hayek, in Koestler and Smythies 1971:321). The pathological disin- tegrations of phasia and the temporary aphasias that can occur in sound individuals under psychophysiological fa- tigue almost never proceed by "dissection" along the lines of cleavage set up by linguistics; nor do they trace in reverse the course of the ontogenesis of speech. The student of the evolution of words should proceed from concrete to and viable definition of his phenomenon, if he wishes to use the term "naming" at all. This is never done, by anthropologists at all events, under that circumstance. Actually, we could legitimately write a treatise on the evolution of phasia without ever mentioning the term, but this obviously is quite another matter. (2) The student of this phylogenesis must value the information emanating from the neurological clinics, but intuitively and on principle he should be very skeptical about evolutionary speculations based upon the principles of the deprivation experiment. (3) The absence of comparable experimental data on chimpanzees does not help Geschwind's case. Still, it no longer matters much; for, shortly after he published, Washoe confounded his supposition by demonstrating that she performs such transfers. (4) Geschwind asks us to suppose that a capability difficult for H. sapiens to exercise is at once not essential to primitive societies of our species and a precondition to the phylogenesis of phasia (phasia being a sine qua non to cultural genesis). What, then, was it that "selective pressures" acted upon? Or have I missed something? How the human brain evolved into a speaking mechanism (together with certain other capabilities) is to be sure much more than a question of cortical refinement, but I have yet to encounter any anthropologist's discussion of this evolution that recognizes the fundamental nature of the thalamocortical relationship. Hewes mentions the presence of "speech areas" in the human cortex and their absence in the alloprimates, but he does not elucidate this very complex and paradoxical subject. True enough, whatever the specific facts, they do add up to the result that man speaks and no other animal does; but I suspect that here explicatio and explicandum have been interchanged. All speculative theory necessarily is simplistic. Here, the applying canon, I believe, is that simplicism should not go so far as to be a stumbling-block. There are many associated problems. For instance, until we can wring an understanding of brain performance from the now-incipient applications of holography, some of our cherished notions about the "languages of the brain" (with thanks to Karl Pribram [ 1971 ] ) must be held in abeyance. Yet this sounds no futilistic note. The great corpus of facts on the brain still has valid claim to examination on its own terms. And this brings me back to Geschwind's propo- sition: does it sustain its own weight? I think not. There exists a general opinion that the functional asym- metry (laterality) of the human cerebral hemispheres is a human uniqueness, but the "phenomenon" is more amorphous than popularly supposed. Hewes forges a chain from left cerebral dominance through right-handedness of refinement of motor skill to an evolving necessity for a more sophisticated topognosic analysis, and so finally to phasial capability. To support this, he argues that the topognosic elaboration came with gestural language, so that lateralization preceded the emergence of phasia. It is a thought-provoking concatenation, to be sure, but every link is fraught with empirical paradoxes; when thus assembled, the whole compounds them. I can but hint at their nature. Neurologists themselves are increasingly dissatisfied with the old notion of "dominance," a term that blankets a domain of ignorance. At all events, the "dominance" of the left hemisphere, in the matter of speech, is not be lumped with right-handedness. Statistically, the prepon- derant incidence in man is indeed left "dominance for speech" and right-handedness. But we simply do not know why there should be this greater frequency of incidence, and there is a large body of "exceptions" that cannot be tossed off as due to culturally prescribed "training." Still-to lend Hewes the comfort we can-topognosia is a function of that area of the parietal cortex in both hemispheres the impairment of which, on the left side, seriously impairs the "naming" process (let us leave it in that vague state). Now to pursue this paradox a step farther: Many highly intelligent children, very capable of speech and sym- bolopoea, have insuperable difficulty with spelling very simple words, yet can read longer ones readily, and also have difficulty with topognosia. Gooddy and Reinhold (1961) believe that this frequently is due to a failure of the two hemispheres, in early postnatal years, to develop fully the functional asymmetry of the "normal" human brain. So far, Hewes's speculation would seem to have one sound feature. But the human infant acquires most of its linguistic ability long before the hemispheres develop this asymmetry,.and children who do not complete the development are yet capable of doing university work, although their handicap dogs them and they must develop compensatory habits. 82 C U R R E N T A N T H R O P O L O G Y</page><page sequence="3">Hewes places the chimpanzee as intermediate between monkey and man, declares for a laterality as a prerequisite for the precision of gestural propositioning, then denies to the chimpanzee both hemispheral functional aniso- morphy and handedness; then, somewhere, he reinserts the anisomorphy as something that had to be present in the preconditions he has just expounded, prior to the transfer of propositioning to a vocal modality. I have not succeeded in piecing this together. Nor can I fit in the appendicular motorization with the conceptualizing functions of the parietal cortex involved in the programming of speech. Interhemispheral relations, functional anisomorphy, the callosum and other commissures, form currently a very lively subject of investigation in neurology. We simply do not know yet just how the two hemispheres are mutually involved in effecting speech. One notion, I believe, may be safely ruled out: in the acquisition of speech, no one hemisphere does it while the other remains idiotic. The canon mentioned above applies here. Hewes make the chimpanzee the "missing link," behav- iorally, in the present regard, between monkey and man. In the years of its immaturity, a comparative evolutionary morphology acted upon this linear principle, but today we understand that the (Oligocene-Miocene) human lineage never passed through a morphology of discrepantly exag- gerated arm-size and canines, a sagittal crest, a simian shelf, quasi-nonexistent coccyx, and the arboreal-terrestrial compromises of habitat that go with this body-size and morphology. The pongids are not linearly ancestral to the hominids, but collateral. One may guess that the ready capability of the chimpanzee for using its arms is correlated with its "arboreality," so much greater than man's. Certainly, at somehow compara- ble ages, the chimpanzee infant learns some motor skills, even complex programmings of them, more readily than the human does. The only point to this speculation (based as it nevertheless is on empirical observation) is to emphasize that we can no more view the chimpanzee's gestural capa- bility as a precondition for an eventual human "transfer" to vocal capability than we can see man's morphology as having passed through a pongid stage. If we repeat the "missing link" fallacy when we turn from physical to psychological morphology, we shall end up by missing the point of the extremely significant lessons that Washoe, Sarah, and now yet others have to teach us. We are indeed learning about the mentational capacities of the primate brain at a given level of nervous control. This is why investigation of cognitive processes in monkey, ape, and man is acquiring a new lease on our interest. A recent remark by the psychologist David McNeill is so very a propos that I shall dub it "McNeill's Principle": noting that Washoe seems to "structure" her "language" in a way unlike that of human children, McNeill (1971:307, italics mine) says that this, "along with the possibility of a very rich capacity for language in humans, might suggest some kind of canalization of evolution. If chimps have advanced a small distance in one direction and we have advanced a great distance in another, it might mean that our direction was more canalized." I can see no reason that the human lineage had to be propositionally gestural before it became phasial. The notion of a coeval and concomitant Weiterbil- dung of gesture and vocalization at the very least obviates the necessity for Hewes's supplementary postulate of buccopharyngeal "changes of innervation"-a notion which my anatomist's intuitions are incapable of picturing. Nor am I helped by the aplraisal that alloprimate vocalizations are (by contrast with gesturing) "emotional," not "volun- tary," only "meagerly propositional" (which lets the cat out of the bag). Hewes explicitly recognizes the formidable problem o,f nauropsychology when one essays to reroute, evolutionally, instructions from cognitive processes through another externalizing channel (gestural to vocal). Personal- ly, I suspect the problem to be fatal to his hypothesis. I am trying to be fair to a respected colleague; so I am begging to be set straight. Hewes speculates that the quickness of the human eye and the visual-perceptive plus cognitive process which makes scansion of letters a more rapid performance than the auditive reception of speech may be due to the phylo- genetic priority in the hominid lineage of gestural over vocal propositioning; for letters, he says, are the fixations of their effecting gestures, as eventually, is (Magdalenian) pictorial art. This certainly draws a very long bow; again we have a speculation not amenable to disproof, but the scientific canon of parsimony militates against it. None the less- The relative speed and capacity for perception via optic and acoustic channels is a problem of neurophysiology; it covers at least the range of the terrestrial vertebrates. To imagine, in disregard of all this, that it is because letters had to be made with the strokes of gesture (which have left no trace) that the speed of their decipherment points to an age-seniority of gestural communication is something of a tour de force. I wonder what Hewes would say to the Gestaltists' confronting even the intellectually unim- pressive hen with visual patterns. (The logic takes an ironical twist if we recall that American children with reading problems, in a pilot experiment, acquired a literacy of English when Chinese ideographs were substituted for the Latin alphabet [Rozin, Poritsky, and Sotsky 1971]-the more complex the "gestures," then, the more readily deci- pherable!) As for the Upper Palaeolithic murals, whatever the "gestures" that produced them (and shall we ignore the sculptures?), I am sooner reminded of the bricolage that had been producing stone artifacts for centimillennia previously, including their intentional designing; but per- haps Hewes would wish to extend his gestural hypothesis even that far back? The principle at issue here is this: Proposition represents a semantic load of message. Neither gesturing nor vocalizing can be shown to have a logical priority as its vehicle. (Human infants, by the way, develop propositioning via vocalization sooner and more fully than via gesturing, despite the fact that they readily use limb movements when expressing emotions.) Alloprimates here and there are sedulous "painters" a visual-somaesthetic transmodal phenomenon-and chimpanzees can be taught to play a simple tune on the piano-an auditory-somaesthetic transmodal phenomenon. Such associative identification is perhaps universal among mammals at least. It cannot be asserted, empirically, that this capability has limbic involvement in all other mammals but is nonlimbic in man. It is the synthesis of this multimodal identification with a symbolic signing that stands forth as a capability of the chimpanzee-pace man. There really is no way that we can assign a greater primitiveness to gesture over vocalization, except by saying that chimpanzees do the one and not the other. If we disallow the "missing link" principle and recognize "McNeill's Principle," the state of the gestural hypothesis becomes parlous indeed. It is high time that someone interjected an admonitory note on the growing use of the term "feedback" in some loose sense akin to "reciprocation," "response," even "con- tinuing reinforcement." We cannot control the escape of the term into a popularity among the laity; we should halt its similar abuse by professionals, such as is appearing already in the pages of CA. Human evolutionists, confront- ed with the improvement of tools or the expansion of brain power in the human lineage, try to convert this into a case of progressive, selective adaptation to an environment by invoking "feedback"-a convenience when specifiable Vol. 15 No. 1 March 1974 83</page><page sequence="4">agencies are not to be had. "Feedback" is a performance by a servomechanism in which some of the informational output returns under monitoring by the mechanism itself. A cybernetic system thereby narrows the channels of its "goal-searching" if the feedback is negative. It is incongru- ous to apply a precise term vaguely as a substitution for another vagueness. "Feedback" belongs to the vocabulary of systems. An excellent maxim would be: Unless you intend to describe or define a cybernetic system, don't use it. Livingstone's argument, essentially, takes off from Hock- ett and Ascher's design features as they apply to nonhuman and human vocal communication. The latter authors found themselves compelled to open up a prehuman closed system in order to effect speech, and they did this by imagining a blending of haplalogies uttered under the duress of strongly conflicting situations. Once this had started, selec- tive pressure took care of the rest. Livingstone adopts the principle involved, but he finds that bird song is already an open system and, with this clue, notes that man is the only primate that can sing and that song is more primitive and simpler than speech and therefore must be evolutionally prior and prequisite. His argument proceeds from the versatility of bird song, which is learnable and not fastened upon stereotypic situa- tions and can be used by birds even for recognizing their individual conspecifics, in contrast to calls, which are rigidly genetical and are applied to elemental, stereotypic situa- tions. The original function of human song may have analogous to that in birds, which is territorial. Alloprimate call systems also lack the versatility of song; yet the human lineage had to pass through the call-system stage of the chimpanzee "to a learned set of personal and group songs." This went along with an expanded territorialism, which "preadapted the hominids to both speech and symboling." The process must have been selective, favoring those prehuman groups that underwent the process. Because this reconstruction emphasizes social dynamics coupled with vocalization, Livingstone rules the researches upon Washoe and others irrelevant, rejects their possible capacity for symbolopoea, and states that their "vocabulary" of signs is limited to no more than 30 (which, by the way, is not so). His scheme raises quite a number of points, both of logical principle and of substance; I must remain selective. As he combines considerations from Hockett and Ascher and from Marler, we must consult these. To discuss Hockett and Ascher first: Alloprimate "call systems"-illustratively, the gibbons'- are "closed." There is only one logical way to open up a closed system: an ordered fragmentation of hitherto irrefragable sequences, with consequent permutations and combinations of unlimited possibilities. If there has been any serious challenge of the principle involved, I am unacquainted with it, although originally the authors sub- mitted their theory avowedly for severe criticism. But it is challengeable. The first fallacy, to my mind, is that logical consideration is confused with biological process: there is no mediation between the two universes of discourse. But logical considerations and design features simply do not evolve. As a logical proposition, a "closed system" may be "opened up" by the appropriate abstract transformative steps. But Hockett and Ascher merely identify a natural (a behavioral) phenomenon with a logical existent; then they make it conform, deductively, to that logic, and invent a behavior to fit the logic. This fault is compounded with one deriving from neuropsychology: the "opening up" would have to be translated as a "jamming" of the afferent channelings from an overload of simultaneous perceptions; but to have this occur, we would be compelled to assume a mechanism of nervous control capable of being jammed this way, and this begs the whole question. Thereupon, selective pressure must come to the rescue. By placing (human) song as more "primitive" than speech and desig- nating it an "open system" because it is like bird "song" (and assigning to the human kind a potential for infinite combinings denied to the avian kind), Livingstone obviates the jamming-and-haplalogy difficulty, but he does not escape the rest of the fallacy. The argument that "song" is simpler than speech and therefore more primitive and therefore evolutionally older and therefore must have been the precursor and precondi- tion is a series of non sequiturs which need be handled here only partially. As any palaeontologist or comparative anatomist could point out, simplicity very frequently is the end result of an evolved simplification from antecedent complexity. Each case has to be scrutinized on its own merits. "Melody" (I can do much better with "melody" than with either "song" or "pitch")-patterned tonal change, tempo, rhythm-is a built-in feature of any animal utterance beyond the "monosyllable." It is of course possible to hum nonverbally; it is impossible (except under certain brain damage, or with great conscious effort) to speak a-melodial- ly; in the infant, recognizable echomelodia sets in weeks earlier than recognizable echolalia with the subsequent echoverbalization. I do not know what Livingstone means by "simpler" when comparing song and speech. If he means that melody lacks the propositional dimension or the discontinuities of speech, this is easily granted; but it only raises new difficulties whose discussion here would be out of place. At all events, "pitch" as "the meaningless duality which can be combined into different sequences to produce an infinite number of songs" shares the fallacy which attempts to invest logical design feature with a biological evolution. Turning, now, to Marler's "parallels" between bird "song" and human "speech," we may ask first what, in biological comparisons, are "parallels." Marler, for instance, sees a "parallel" in that young birds and young humans learn some important aspects of their vocalizing patterns from their adults. In order to maintain his "parallel," he has to be selective, restricting himself to avian "song" and human speech; avian "calls" are rigidly innate. In other words, avian vocalization is never seen as a totality, the productive repertory of a peculiar neuropsychological mechanism; it is dichotomized first on the basis of observed behavior. This instances well the reason current biopsychology finds a straight behavioristic empiricism of limited applicability. Marler goes on to rationalize that there must have been, in the evolution of the avian capacity for vocalizing, an evolutional selection, with survival value, of constraints on the learning process. Clearly, the selection has favored a brain that learns something in one situation but is incapable of doing so in another. There are also "parallel" constraints upon the human child, in that it learns those applying to language more readily than those applying to other sounds that impinge upon it. A further "parallel" is the laterality governing the nervous controls of the larynx and of the syrinx (of which more in a moment). By being selective, it is easy to find "similarities" in all sorts of features among animals. But what are they, in each particular case? Homologies? Analogies? Parallel evolutions? Illustrations of one or another abstract princi- ple? Merely interesting coincidences? Salamanders and cockroaches alternate the progressions of their legs. Hydras, starfish, and the bloom of many angiosperms show radial symmetries. A fundamental property of all nervous tissue is "learning" (provided one defines "learning" appropri- ately). Hockett's design features are heuristically valuable as long as evolutional relatedness between comparates remains irrelevant. 84 C U RRE N T A N TH RO POLOG Y</page><page sequence="5">In Marler's instances, he is really comparing the outcomes of independent evolutions. Bertalanffy (e.g., 1950) estab- lished the principle of equifinality in (biological) systems, whereby similar results are achieved from nonidentical processes; and it is common knowledge that the bird and the mammalian neuropsyches, under certain set conditions, can solve identical problems (see, e.g., Krushinsky 1965). This is very striking; nevertheless, the neuropsychologist would inquire more profoundly. The bird solves the prob- lem without cerebral hemispheres but with certain other well-evolved neural structures. Mammal and bird inevitably perceive, abstract, cognize differently. Both have schemes of neural control that make it possible for its immature state to "learn" from the performances of matured states. Now, when you say that there are "parallels" in the bird's and the human's learning, respectively, a relatively stereo- typical and limited range of specifically ad hoc "songs" and a repertoire of permutable elements, just what do you mean by "parallels"? Let there be no misunderstanding: Marler is not talking nonsense, but Livingstone is attempting an evolutionary account without ever examining the relevance or validity of Marler's design features for such an account. Marler's citation to laterality of nervous control in avian and human vocal communication leads him to an anatomi- cal-physiological comparison that is spurious. To begin with, structural and functional anisomorphy superimposed upon a bilateral symmetry is very widespread in the animal kingdom, though the kind and degree of it vary. The human hemispheral functional anisomorphy has nothing in com- mon with the fact, cited by Marler, that the two syringeal nerve-trunks behave synchronically, complementarily, and nonidentically to produce the bird's "song" passage. The action resembles, in closer analogy, the performances of the right and the left hands of a pianist. While Marler's comparisons of design features are not intended to elucidate evolutionary sequences, Livingstone's intent is precisely to do so; his first step is to deflect the "parallelism" from human speech to human song. The synonymy for the avian and the human utterance is really meant-as appears when we find that both are melodious expressions. I don't believe that Livingstone can avoid, by this, the label of anthropomorphism, or the suspicion of a semantic trick. Avian "song" is that to us because it sounds so; but by far not all bird's territorial identifications would seem to us "song." In fact, what Marler seems to be referring to are only the Passeriformes-more narrowly, the Frin- gillidae. There is nothing to be learned about the evolution of human singing and talking from an examination of bird vocalization. Livingstone could have omitted all citation to Marler without affecting his thesis at all. Both Hewes and Livingstone raise the problem of mimic- ry. Generically speaking, the avian brain has a genius for mimicking animal sounds (plus a few others, presumably limited by interest and not mechanical capability; that not all birds prove to be such geniuses is beside the point). The mammalian brain, in this regard, is idiotic (by special concession-dolphins and humans are moronic). On the other hand, birds are idiotic at gestural mimicry (let us except bottle-opening, etc.). But the imitation, by various alloprimates, of certain human motor programs (including a goal-directedness, which the mimicry by birds does not include) is a manifestation that these alloprimates possess "body schema" in the sense known to the neuropsychology clinic and to primate-experimental psychology. This radical discrepancy about the respective mimicries of birds and of mammals vitiates, I think, any significant comparisons between them. Behind Hewes's theory lurks a "sleeper"; behind Livingstone's, the threat of dissolution. The same stricture about the "missing link" applies to Livingstone's use of it as to Hewes's. And now, may I hope that Livingstone will clear up for me a confusion about his characterizing of alloprimate call systems? If the chimpanzees are the inescapable intermediate stage between monkeys and man, precisely how does one pass from the calls of monkeys to the songs of australopithecines via this stage? Just what, in the latter stage, were the anlagen of personal identification-and-territoriality in the aus- tralopithecine song, for which otherwise only bird "song" offers whatever "parallelism" there be? Because he starts immediately from social communication by vocalization, Livingstone pronounces the gestural "speech" of a Washoe irrelevant; chimpanzees are also denied a symbolopoeic capacity (although one may surmise that this is for the convenience of the theory). By contrast, Hewes at any rate puts substance into his use of the chimpanzee as a "missing link" between monkey and hom- inid. His theory at least accommodates the critical etape wherewith propositional messaging entered into early- human communicative code. Hewes's difficulty lies where gesture transfers to vocalization. Livingstone does not encounter this difficulty, but he offers no clue at all to the evolutional emergence of propositioning itself. It seems ironical that his holding-forth on the effecting agency of melody as the prodromon of speech should increase the critical difficulty of, so to say, passing from analogal consideration to digital. Did the australopithecines sing? Perhaps. It is an intri- guing idea, in its own right, when stripped of nonsupportive support. Did they speak? Perhaps. Mourant's approach contrasts diametrically with the foregoing two. Both of the latter look upon the expressive side of communication; Mourant looks upon the semeic load of expression, and the load merits priority of consider- ation. Hewes and Livingstone are in a position to agree or disagree; Mourant does not enter their argument. All three are trying to weave schemata. The first two writers implicate matters neocortical; Mourant implicates relations between neocortex and limbic system. This puts upon the problem of phasia quite a different complexion. One might say that Mourant is suggesting a rationale of the phylogenesis of the symbolic process, which is the seedbed of phasia, along with evolu- tional changes in the ontogenesis that must have been involved pari passu. The argument appears to go thus: Following Comfort, who proceeds from Freud, human postnatal ontogenesis is seen as containing "rehearsals" of sexuality which point toward eventual adulthood. The Oedipus complex belongs within this development and functions, socially, to protect the young from a premature and dangerously disadvantageous sexual competition with adults. The attendant castration anxiety led, perhaps from the start, to the formation of a particular Unconscious (in the psychoanalytic sense), which also generated the symbolopoesis of speech. Drawing upon Krantz's proposi- tion that the capacity for phasia must wait upon a volumetric of no less than ca. 750 cc, it is supposed that symbolopoesis and phasia were achieved, in the H. erectus stage, only with adulthood. But with the accelerated growth rate that came to characterize the H.sapiens brain, which allows the 750 cc volume to be achieved in very early childhood and a further expansion to continue for another dozen years, phasial capacity has been achievable ever earlier. Mourant speculates that this particular precocity was an advantage conducive to the expansion of culture and of enculturation, the while sexual maturation (implicitly, its psychosexual aspect) correlatively was postponed into an adolescence. If I read correctly between his lines, the ontogenesis of phasia and that of (psycho)sexuality, during hominid phylogenesis, have thus become in some way and in some Vol. 15 No. 1 March 1974 85</page><page sequence="6">degree desynchronized, while the Oedipus complex has developed as a fender against the consequences of an early sexuality; and (although he is not explicit in this matter) the specifically human developmental characteristic we call "adolescence" has come into being. His argument is an ingenious and plausible synthesis; however, no more than he can I see a way to its disproof. Notwithstanding, what are the credentials of his sources of suggestion? Mourant would be the first to agree that Comfort's Darwin and Freud deserves much more attention than he can afford it. And I am not qualified to discuss the Oedipus complex on its own recognizance; whether it serves as Comfort would claim in H. sapiens must depend, I think, on what it does in or contributes to "adolescence." But when and insofar as he supposes the emergent evolution of a particular Unconscious, he opens the window to powerful drafts from neuropsychology. What would be a viable scientific mount- ing of the phrase "the evolution of the (an) Unconscious"? Actually, this is not altogether a terra incognita. It very much concerns the nature and the performances of the limbic system. A minimal hint of this must be given. (The pertinent literature is enormous.) It was Kubie, neurologist and psychoanalyst, who devel- oped most tellingly the meaning of the brain for psycho- analytic concepts (selectively, 1953a, b). A symbol-whether the literal one that is predominantly conscious, the meta- phorical one that is predominantly preconscious, the psy- choanalytical one "whose roots are predominantly uncon- scious," or a combination of all three-is always secured at one end in the internal, the bodily-I, polarity and at the other in the external, outer-world, the non-I, polarity. Where the temporal lobe and its (limbic) connections meet is where these two polarities meet and the past and the present are integrated. This "psychosomatic organ" makes possible projection and introjection. Back of Kubie's neurologic identifications in this matter lie the classic researches of MacLean upon the limbic system ("visceral brain"). MacLean (1949), drawing upon Lorente de N6, remarks that the hippocampus is structured essen- tially the same from mouse to man. (He considers that the hippocampus, by contrast with the far finer resolutions by the neocortex, can deal with information but crudely.) He continues (1949:348): One might imagine . .. that, though the visceral brain could never aspire to conceive of the colour red in terms of a three-letter word or as a specific wave length of light, it could associate the colour symbolically with such diverse things as blood, fainting, fighting, flowers, etc. Therefore if the visceral brain were the kind of brain that could tie up symbolically a number of unrelated phenomena, and at the same time lack the analyzing ability of the word-brain to make a nice discrimination of their differences, it is possible to conceive how it might become foolishly involved in a variety of ridiculous correlations leading to phobias, obsessive- compulsive behaviour, etc.. . . Considered in the light of Freudian psychology, the visceral brain would have many attributes of the unconscious id. However, before we merely follow Mourant and Comfort (and even Kubie) to an acceptance of the Freudian Uncon- scious, we must read MacLean a little farther: One might argue, however, that the visceral brain is not at all unconscious (possibly not even in certain stages of sleep), but rather eludes the grasp of the intellect because its animalistic and primitive structure makes it impossible to communicate in verbal terms. Perhaps it were more proper to say, therefore, it was an animalistic and illiterate brain. (For a simplified, succinct, and less technical account of man's limbic system and its relations with the rest of the brain, see MacLean 1964.) MacLean is the author of that classic parable of the visceral brain as the horse and the neocortical brain as its rider. At this point, I think we have eliminated the utility of Comfort's "special uncon- scious" and have effected junction with the undeniably present visceral and neocortical brains of the alloprimates, not to mention the other Eutheria. (Something is known of their functionings, as well as of their cytoarchitectures.) MacLean appraises the visceral brain as the most "associa- tive" of all newer brain, a point that will surprise those who confine their attention to the "association areas" of the neocortex. Since Mourant's hypothesis has opened upon the role of the "analogal" brain in the evolution of symbolopoea and of phasia whereas the first two writers remain "digital" (i.e., try to account for the emergence of proposition), I shall push the problem still farther down, that its full global nature may be realized. Speaking of the reticular formation, Yakovlev (1958:293) has remarked: "I shall venture that it is from this primordial neuronal swamp that human thought arose like a sinful orchid." The foregoing is slanted phylogenetically; there must be a few remarks slanted ontogenetically: Comfort's com- parison of the Oedipus complex to, e.g., a thymus gland is apt in the sense that such structures supposedly are but temporary structures with temporary functions at a period of the ontogenetic course. But the comparison is no more than a parable. An atomistic approach can do no better than this, I think. Under a holistic, organismal approach, such "entities" become episodes in the continuous readjustments of relations that make up a developing system. And the eventual fates of thymus gland and Oedipus complex are vastly different. The thymus degenerates and ceases to participate in the system that is the organism, but, if we may judge from what happens in other matters of developmental psychology, the Oedipus complex very likely persists somehow, latently or in limbo, throughout life. It probably fits the popular observation that the child is father to the man, that the man remains a child at heart, that the adult never outgrows his "need" of mother. Indeed, a little reflection must indicate that this popular wisdom has entered into the shaping of human familialism. Fur- thermore, under hypnosis the childhood condition at any selected age can be made to surface again. Such considerations should make for a receptivity toward the notion that the same symbolopoeic capacity has operated in the emergence of phasia and of the Oedipus complex and that it is no mere coincidence that they run along with a great body of other identifiable growth processes and episodes in ontogenesis. But the notion that "castration anxiety may have led to the development of a separate unconscious mind . . . and the development of speech" draws a long bow. Moreover, I suspect that Mourant has overextended his lines of battle. Mourant is trying to place under Comfort's speculative synthesis a common rationale of evolution of brain capacity. No one has ever doubted that a brain must have some sufficient cell population if certain capacities for abstracting and polarizing information are to be present, but the more that is learned about the statistical or mass behavior of cell populations, the fuzzier becomes the question of how large this population must be. And anyone acquainted with the sizes, the dendrifications, the population densities of cortical neurones in, e.g., man and chimpanzee becomes uneasy in the presence of an unrelievedly volumetric comparison of total brain masses. No doubt Mourant is not thinking as simplistically as his hypothesis is stated. None the less, the hypothesis is open only to simplistic thinking and discussion. The rub is that how the brain functions is far better understood today than it was when the differences between the brains of apes and men were being summed up as a volumetric. 86 C U R R E N T A N T H R O P O L O G Y</page><page sequence="7">Krantz's simplicism allows this interpretation: The brains of H. erectus and of H. sapiens have (had) the same cytoarchitectonics, the same ontogenetic course; it was but in the growth rate, which in erectus was several times slower than in sapiens, that they differed, so that by the time each species had achieved its adulthood, erectus was left far behind. The cytoarchitecture being the same, of course the volume requisite for speech was achieved in sapiens far earlier than in erectus. (Krantz goes farther than Mourant in that he arranges growth factors to suit the hypothesis: erect usand sapiens reach adulthood at the same chronological age; in both, the "intellectual advantage" of the adults is the same, with definitive brain volumes respectively 850 cc and 1,400 cc (a constant ratio throughout [erectus = .6 (sapiens)]) and 750 cc being achieved respectively at ca. six years and one year. Now, a human nanocephal exercises a modicum of viable propositional speech with a brain volume of less than 400 cc. The feasibility undoubtedly resides in possession of the H. sapiens DNA instructional templates; the cytoarchitec- tonics are unmistakably sapiens. There is and can be no evidence of what the erectus cytoarchitectonics were, whether at adulthood or in infancy. Whatever may have been the phasial capabilities of the species, never were they delivered by a duplicate of those in sapiens. The ontogenetic "Rubicon" of 750 cc is backed by neither logic nor empiric. However, Mourant is not insisting on the figures. He is submitting the more general proposition that, in evolu- tionary course, phasia has appeared at a progressively earlier ontogenetic stage. The idea is not unreasonable; if it be entertainable, however, it must be in spite of and not by virtue of Krantz's scheme. Let me indicate some of the simplicism that haunts the scheme and Mourant's exploitation of it. In matters of morphological comparative development, a palaeanthropologist is careful to distinguish between relative and absolute chronologies. For example, in the eruption of teeth, the Taung child perished at the developmental equivalent of six sapiens years. A chimpanzee at this equivalent e'tapewould be much "older" than a human in motor aptitude, and in some ways psychologically more advanced, while in others it would be far behind; and it would not yet be six years old. Actually, we have no idea when the H. erectus infant began its echolalia (it is reasonable to suppose that it did, at some time). Even supposing that echolalia began at a mental-developmental- equivalent stage equatable with that of H. sapiens, the erectus infant may well have been much less than one year old and had a cerebral volume of far less than 750 cc. We have no idea whatever as to the absolute age of the onset of puberty-which may indeed have been around the eruption of M2-or whether it was marked by the onset of a rudimentary psychological "adolescent" period. Of one thing I believe we can be certain: whatever "speech" was possessed by H. erectus-at any life-stage-it was as unlike that of H. sapiens as their cytoarchitectonics undoubtedly differed. And it is quite as tenable as Mourant's speculation that the infant H. erectus was younger, absolutely, than H. sapiens, achieved a viable pithecanthropine speech in less time, had less developmental distance to go before "speaking like a man." Personally, I prefer the latter alterna- tive; we must toss a coin. Mourant's most pregnant remark, I think, is one uttered incidentally: "The evolution of the primate brain in the direction of increased size and efficiency began many millions of years before speech started." Actually, the brain/body ratio of primates is the highest of all mammalian orders. Anthropologists are not used to remembering this, for they are prone to think only of, the marked volumetric superiority of the hominid over the pongid brains and to plot this against some centimillennia of the late Tertiary- early Quaternary time-span. The increase has been termed an "explosion of brains" and left to be the last bastion to the edifice of human anomaly. Elsewhere, I have pointed out that from a chimpanzee brain size to a human (all else assumed as equal, which of course it really is not) is a stretch that could be covered by a little less than two more mitotic divisions (231+-233-); that the gestational period would easily cover this if increased from seven to nine months; and that, stretched over the time-span allowed for the evolution of the hominids, the process becomes a gradual one indeed. I do not know from what log2 one would have to start, in the earlier Tertiary and with the lowlier primates of that time, to trace the trend of increase in primate brain size; no more do I dare imagine what increases of mentational capacity paced it. The locus of trend extends back that far, and the later end of it curves sharply upward. The believer in an "explosion of brains," disregarding this secular trend, invents some special "selec- tion pressures" to account for the latest upsurge of the curve. He is at liberty to do so, for his hypothesis is not amenable to disproof; it remains none the less a special pleading and it transfers to external factors an agency that belongs to internal factors. In any event, the human capacity should first be examined as the extreme-logical develop- ment of a "trend." Man's is the primate brain par excellence, not an anomaly. A final matter-one that extends over all three essays, but seems best educible from Mourant's: Scientific thought (exclusive, I fear, of bioanthropology) is moving from atomistic to holistic theory. Traditionally, we are very used to naming Things: tangible existents, characterizable as isolable Facts, which are assured of definition when at last we can refer them to a metric. Such is our epistemology. This is why Krantz, for example, can treat maturational span as a Thing identical in erectus and sapiens and a special volumetric as a Thing that can be shifted along this scale in both species. While Mourant doubts the accuracy of the quantities, he does not escape the constraints of the reasoning: phasia is a Thing sufficiently identical in erectus and sapiens as to be amenable to shifting along the scale to an ever earlier point. His "central hypothesis" fits this frame of thought, and we end up with the notion that the Thing did not arrive, in erectus, until the sexually mature state of adulthood, while in sapiens it has become detached from a correlation with sex and is now incident at the incipient end of maturation (when sexuality is just begin- ning). In this our transitional era, we are having difficulty with a vocabulary legacy from discontinuous Things. But we are confronted with the dawning realization that organic phenomena are systematic continua. The emergence of phasia, both phylogenetically and ontogenetically, is an indeterminate (in the technical sense) episode of such a continuum. A "period of maturation" is but a statement about how long it has taken a dynamic system to track over its program of transformations. "Maturity" is an adjective disguised as a nominal; it describes the "definitive" state of that programming. In organic nature, the tempo within which its potenti- alities are achieved is one of the properties of any system. It follows that no two such systems ever duplicate that property. This is why the not-uncommon notion that man achieved his present life-span at some earlier, pre-sapiens state and then proceeded to evolve further within it is not just a moot statement but a nonsensical one. By the same token, so is any statement that phasia has "receded" in phylogenesis to an earlier ontogenetic age, for phasia in erectus and phasia in sapiens cannot be the same Thing. Phasia is assumed to be a Thing in a further sense: thought-plus-vocalization. But it is not a Thing. Its utterance Vol. 15 No. I March 1974 87</page><page sequence="8">is an end product of a processing by a very complex system. The processing, indeed, need not even issue in (vocal) utterance; there are degrees of freedom, at this supremely high level of order, that allow other consequences. One frame of discourse permissibly common to the cases of erectus and of sapiens is that of symbolopoesis-it being understood that the process (or processes) can be effected by a variety of systems. We have an idea what the process is in sapiens; we have no idea what it was in erectus. Very probably, the cytoarchitectonics resembled those of sapiens; the surfaces of the endocasts-tenuous evidence at best-at least do not forbid us to suppose that there was vocalized utterance of thought. But by now, we have definitely moved over into questions of hierarchy in syntheses, and we have escaped from atomism into holism. Symbolopoesis is not a Thing. It is, basically, a function of relationships at a high level of computable order. It has no determinate quo ante non. Even in H. sapiens, after the onset of adolescence it achieves an abstractive capacity hitherto not obtaining. (Geniuses attain it much earlier; it is not generated by sex hormones.) What spoils Mourant's treatment of phasia as a Thing that has developed ever earlier as the erectus level was transcended by the evolving sapiens is that Pan evidences a genuine abstractive capacity at so very early an age of infancy-childhood. That Washoe uses gestures instead of vocalizations is clearly beside the point, and so is the safe surmise that her symbolopoesis does not duplicate ours. Here, Hayek's remark (cited in Koestler and Smythies 1971:321, italics mine) is as appropriate as it is in the (different) context within which it was uttered: Once we realize that the capacity to act in accordance with abstract rules is very much older than language, and that man developing language was already guided by a great many abstract rules of action, the fact-if it is a fact-that language begins with names for relatively concrete things would mean no more than that in the development of language that sequence characteristic of development of mind is reversed. And I am unwilling to deny to the erectus infant an early capacity for mentation at least equal to what even a Pan mentation possesses so very early. The "fallacy of Things" comes from extending to the information of relationships (a concept of information theory) the methodology of information on entities-as-ob- jects. Under the latter, an erectus MI may be legitimately quasi-equated with a sapiens M1 and inferences drawn therefrom. But phasia is a configuration of relationships among computing processes-clearly, an utterly different matter. A still profounder dimension underlies all this-an indis- pensable consideration that can only be mentioned here: Traditional considerations of evolution have been only of what results from the processings and transformations of energy. But the essence of neuropsychological evolution is that of information processings by systems-a radically different problem and approach, and one that we are only beginning to acquire a capability for handling. A conse- quence of this situation is that our discussion of the evolution of language is confined pretty much to such topics as the adaptive advantages of possessing speech. What we really need to know is what actually has evolved, and how; and to talk about speech without a foundation in neuropsychology is a Hamlet without Hamlet. Anthropology needs the neurologist. The neurological sciences embody a mountainous supply of pertinent sub- stantive matter, treatable only within a frame of systems and information theory; and they entertain a salutary rigor of thinking that we cannot afford to do without. Replies by GORDON W. HEWES Boulder, Colo., U.S.A. 10 VI 73 Inasmuch as I commented at length on the responses to my article, I shall be brief, although Count's very thoughtful and penetrating critique not only of my article, but of those by Livingstone and Mourant, merits equally careful rebuttal. First, I insist that my version of the gestural theory of language origin is capable of falsification, as all useful scientific proposals should be, and at several points. My omission of explicit statements about how my glottogonic model might be disconfirmed did not mean that the problem had not occurred to me. A demonstration that spoken language could be elicited from chimpanzees by methods not different in principle from those used to get chimpan- zees to communicate by means of manual sign language, or plastic tokens, would certainly weaken part of my argument. If replications of the reconstructions of the vocal tracts and accompanying acoustic properties of early fossil hominids should disprove the contentions of Lieberman, Crelin, and Klatt that these forms did not possess articulate speech, my model would be weakened still further. A complex, synthetic theory of an evolutionary phenomenon is usually disconfirmable not by a single crucial demon- stration, but by the invalidation of a whole series of component arguments. There are dozens of elements in my model, drawn from work in neurology, infant and child language acquisition studies, studies of gestural behavior, etc., which, in principle, might be disconfirmed to the further weakness of my theory. I do not understand Count's reference to the "hunting party scenario" as a feeble feature of my model. While the amount or intensity of hunting (and scavenging) by the early hominids may have been exaggerated in certain writings, there is prehistoric archaeological evidence enough to show that our bipedal, tool- and weapon-using ancestors engaged in considerably more "hunting party" activity, for perhaps some millions of years, than is exhibited by any of the modern alloprimates. Contrary to Count's impression, I have not used the chimpanzee data on sign-language (by Washoe et al.), or plastic-token-language (by Sarah) acquisition because I believe that Pan troglodytes or any living pongid is a very good representation of man's Pliocene ancestor. The chimpanzee language data are used, obviously, because they are all we have so far to show that capacity to handle propositional language, at a modest level, is not an absolutely species-specific property of mankind. It is in a sense incidental that the brain size of the chimpanzee falls within the lower end of the range of the Australopithecinae and that the manipulatory capacities of the chimpanzee are the closest to man's, despite the somewhat more hominid proportions of the gorilla hand and digits. If there had been no demonstration of propositional language in chimpanzees, but evidence (actually nonexistent so far) that dogs or elephants could acquire propositional or predicative language, I would not have had to change my basic model fundamentally, but instead would have predicted that chimpanzees, too, should be able, with appropriate training, to achieve a mastery of manual sign language. As a matter of fact, I did predict this, in an unpublished letter to Keith Hayes, who was then working with the young chimpanzee Viki, dated July 3, 1951 (cf. Hewes 1973), 16 years before either the Gardners or Premack began to develop language behavior in their chimpanzees. Also contrary to Count's view of my position, I do not argue that propositional language is absolutely localized in the left cerebral cortex. It is yet to be established where 88 C U RRE N T A N TH ROPOLOG Y</page><page sequence="9">the sign-language-handling capacity of chimpanzees like Washoe is localized, although the fact that one of the chimpanzees acquiring sign language at Norman, Oklaho- ma, under the training of Roger Fouts, is a split-brain animal should permit the determination of this, at least in this individual (cf. Fouts 1973). Data emerging from studies of a girl who was brought up without any opportu- nity to acquire language to age 13 indicating that the belated development of her speech is being localized in her right hemisphere, although she is right-handed and has no apparent left-cortical brain damage, also contradict a sim- plistic view of the cerebral lateralization of the speech function (Curtiss et al. 1973). Finally, Count asserts that in the human infant vocal communication is prior to gestural communication. There is contrary evidence (Cicourel and Boese 1969, 1970; Denzin 1971). by FRANK B. LIVINGSTONE Ann Arbor, Mich., U.S.A. 7 VI 73 Although Count's discussion raises many questions about evolution in general and the evolution of language in particular, I will only respond to his discussion of my article. Our disagreement results both from misunderstanding and from differences in our interpretations of the course of human evolution. First of all, I think that the hominids did evolve from the pongids, or, in other words, that man's ancestor in the Miocene would be classified by most taxonomists as belonging to the Pongidae and shared many characteristics with the modern members of that group. Of course, the pongids have evolved since the Miocene; but since they are still adapted to the same general ecological niche, they have evolved far less than the hominids, who have under- gone some of the most drastic ecological shifts known in mammalian evolution. Pongid vocalization may have been one feature which evolved considerably, but its general similarities to the vocalizations of other primates would seem to be evidence against this view. Second, Count states that "there is nothing to be learned about the evolution of human singing and talking from an examination of bird vocalization." Obviously, I disagree. Evolution or natural selection operates on function, so that one can study bird or bat wings as adaptations to flight regardless of the fact that these structures are very different. The resultant behavior was adaptive, and this can be considered by itself. This is only one other way in which the study of natural selection has a very different focus than the usual phylogenetic reconstructions. Similarly, New World monkeys or birds in zoos make astonishingly similar vocalizations which indicate common adaptations to the same ecosystem, the tropical forest. The adaptive nature of these vocalizations is now being extensively studied, and Marler's work in particular is significant for its implications as to the possible functions of learned vocalizations and their features. There is apparently no adaptive value in having great variability in the warning call of a species, and this is one reason for these calls' being "innate" and constant throughout a species. On the other hand, territorial calls, which involve both personal and group identifications, would seem to require a considerable amount of variability in their expression by individuals, simply to distinguish the individuals or their group. Marler has shown that territorial calls in monkeys contain discrete vocalizations, while within-group calls are not discrete but continuous. Although variability in continuous aspects of speech is the basis of individual recognition, discrete vocalizations can be permuted in regular ways and thus are capable of much more variability. Further, discrete variation can be learned, and with this advance the variability in calls is increased enormously. Given this interpretation of the "opening of the call system," the central problem is the evolution of learned vocalizations and whether the pongids have any, however rudimentary. Marler has found that chimpanzee vocaliza- tions are primarily continuous and not discrete, and all other work on chimpanzee vocalization indicates that the great majority is emotional and probably innate. But some chimpanzee calls can be heard for up to two miles in the tropical forest, and I am sure that group or individual recognition is communicated over these distances. Of course, this does not necessarily mean that the calls are learned, but I think the possibility exists. If so, then their learned vocalizations would surely be what I have called simple. Count questions this use of "simple," so perhaps I should say "laryngal" in the sense that the variation is primarily produced in the larynx and hence is mostly tonal. This simplicity contrasts with the elaborate pharyngal varia- tion in human speech, which Lieberman asserts, and I agree, is quite late in human evolution. The many failures to teach chimpanzees human speech are the result of the demand for pharyngal manipulations they cannot perform. In any case, I am almost convinced that the evolution of human language went through a stage of learned, laryngal vocalizations, which would be comparable to the com- munication systems of some birds, and furthermore that this stage occurred after the separation from the pongids and thus at approximately the australopithecine stage. by A. E. MOURANT London, England. 6 vi 73 Count, more than any of the other contributors to the discussion, has made the response which I hoped to elicit when I wrote my article. He has appreciated that my suggestions were made in a field marginal to my own regions of competence, and that I hoped others would take up and develop those aspects which were of value. From his wealth of specialised knowledge Count has developed some of them far beyond these hopes. I appreciate that symbolic speech is not a single "Thing" in Count's sense, but I still think that it depends substantially on the size of the brain, or of some specialised part of it. This would, I think, be true especially of that kind of speech with high objective informational content which would be needed to pass on details, as suggested by Krantz, of technological processes. We do not know the chronological age at which different early types of man either reached puberty or began to speak, and perhaps we never shall-but unlike the timing of his purely mental processes, these are not inevitably beyond the possibility of finding out: we are, after all, now able to measure the growth of ancient corals by the day, the lunar month, and the year; perhaps human skeletons contain some of the same information, though more subtly encoded.
