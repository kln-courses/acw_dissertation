Confronted to person it gradually acquires somatic connotations and generally means person inarnate, creative individuality. Asomatic attitude is reflected in Nesmelov. In soteriological perspective, as Sergius Stragorodskij sug- gests, personality should be subjectively abandonded in order to be finally glorified by God. Keywords Theology • Personality • Hypostasis • Somatic/asomatic • Salvation In an inspired address preceding the defense of his doctoral thesis devoted to the anthropology of St. Gregory Palamas in 1950, Archimandrite Cyprian (Kern) resolutely affirmed that "... the concept of the value and significance of human personality was the most important achievement of Christian theology, as expressed in the doctrine of the deification of man and salvation of every individual" (KmipHaH (KepH) 1997, p. 419). One gets the impression that all Russian theologians throughout the thousand years of Christianity in Russia shared this conviction. However, even the opening lines of Konstantin Leontev's renowned work, Byzantism and Slavdom (1875), thoroughly discredit any such assumption. If Russia really was the successor to the Byzantine tradition, it should have preserved the essence of the latter. However, according to Leont'ev, "the Byzantine ideal does not N.

Gavryushin know the sublime and often exaggerated idea of the earthly personality, which history owes to German feudalism" (JleoHTbeB 1875, p. 1). Who is right, then? Russian theological book learning had never used the term "personality" before the 19th century. Neither Greek originals nor their translations into South Slavonic provided any significant motives for its emergence - especially considering the utmost impersonality of ascetic precepts found in monastic collections. It should be kept in mind that in the Confessions St. Augustine expresses a fundamental personalistic trend of Western Christian civilization, which did not become notable in Russia until the beginning of the 19th century. Academic theology of the eighteenth and early 19th centuries used only Latin, with token exceptions, and reproduced a conceptual structure rooted in Thomas Aquinas. The shift to Russian as the language of instruction partly revived contacts with the Byzantine and medieval Russian tradition. Translations from St. John of Damascus made up the basic theological arsenal of medieval Russian book learning and fixed a correlation between 'person,* 'hypostasis' and 'will' that was to remain in place for six centuries. Archimandrite Alexis (Rzanitsyn) returned to the paradigm in 1846 in order clearly to distinguish between the Greek terms for "hypostasis" and "person": npf/aomov always means the free and rational indivisible while vnocrcaaic means essence (essentia), substance (substantia), and the indivisible (A^eKCHii (PxaHHUbiH), 1848, p. 197 note). It is worth mentioning that Archimandrite Alexis would hardly accept the opinion of Vladimir N. Losskij, who distinguished between the salvation of human nature by the Son of God and the salvation of particular persons by the Holy Spirit. Such approval was impossible, not only because it supposed the admission of separate action by the Persons of the Holy Trinity, but also due to a concept of relations between nature and Person based on the same John of Damascus (Ibid, p. 199). The inner demand for introducing the term "personality" into theology was felt as early as the 1820s, as testified by works of St. Innocent (Borisov), who approached the treatment of the Person of Christ as an object of empathy and an ideal to be followed. Innocent stressed the ethical and psychological aspect of the Savior's struggle - which was in perfect keeping with the spirit of the Tubingen School even before Strauss' famous book appeared. Innocent stressed that many could not bring into conformity the spiritual struggle in the Garden of Gethsemane, the 'deviation' from the Cross, with the moral grandeur of Jesus, because they "wanted to see Him as Son of God at times when He should appear only as Son of Man" (MHHOiceHTHfi (Bophcob) 1830, p. 184). In this way, he makes it explicit that one of the crucial instances of the Gospel story made Christ act as an independent, God-forsaken human personality. That was why St. Paul regarded the struggle in the Garden of Gethsemane as "consummation of His suffering, past and future" (Ibid p. 213).1 However, Innocent did not yet use the term "personality" (which could be used to in describing the composite Hypostasis of Christ), and he found a way out in 1 Innocent alludes to Heb. 5:9. £) Springer</page><page sequence="3">The concept of personality in Russian theological literature 137 pointing to the limits of the theological idiom: the Church "deemed this inexplicable just as philosophers deem inexplicable the way of combining the finite with the infinite" (Mhhokchthh (BopHCOB) (s.d.), p. 357).2 The term "personality" repeatedly occurred in lectures from 1835 to 1841 by Philarete (Gumilevskij). To all appearances, this was one of its earliest occurrences in Russian theology. In particular, he used it while accusing Hegelians of Docetism. The Docetic context adds grounds to the assumption that, unlike Person, which is related to the Divine Hypostases, personality is understood here as person incarnate and indissolubly linked to human flesh (4&gt;H7iapeT (FyMnneBCKHH) apxHenwcKon 1865, p. 70). Further confirmation of the development of the somatic line in the treatment of the concept of personality can be found in the literary heritage of Archimandrite Theodore (Alexander Bukharev). Bukharev owed his general theological and philosophical percepts to Romantic literature and to his mental dialogue with Vissarion Belinsky, who promoted the same Romantic ideals in the secular literary language supported by the Hegelian tradition. As he protested against Docetic and spiritualist misrepresentations of the Gospel truth in his essay On Christian Orthodoxy in its relation to Contemporaneity, Bukharev resolutely insisted on the spiritual meaning of "corporality," an inherent part of the person or personality (3&gt;eoAop, apxHMaH^pMT 1991, p. 433). Bukharev regarded the plenitude of personal being and the grace of Christ as correlative categories (Ibid). Motives that later characterized the personalist constructs of Mikhail Tareev and Archimandrite Cyprian (Kern) were clearly pronounced in his works. Archimandrite Theophanes Avsenev (1812-1851) discussed the concept of personality in a unique context. He was convinced (largely under the influence of Gotthilf Heinrich von Schubert and certain other German authors) that the human personality rested on the human heart, the "organ of magnetic clairvoyance" (4&gt;eo$aH ABceHeB 1869, pp. 79-80, 179). He was explicit that human individuality as personality rose to the height of the Universal in the act of self-comprehension. Archbishop Nicanor (Brovkovich) repeatedly treated the problem of personality both in the context of the Incarnation of God as well as in departing from the issue of free will. It is noteworthy that Nicanor deemed the full corporality of the Theandric Personality of the Savior necessary, in particular, to "conceal" the infinite glory of God from the mortal eye (HnicaHop [Bpobkobhm] apxHen 1886, p. 52). Nicanor is not very explicit as to the definition of the will. Occasionally, he merely identifies it with instinct. It might be regarded as the "inner dynamic energy" of any subject whatsoever, not necessarily endowed with distinctive properties of personality. Influenced to an extent by Schopenhauer, Nicanor introduces the idea of two types of will - "utilitarian," aimed at "advantage" in the empirical world and at 2 Regrettably, the inferior textology of this edition does not specify the dates and originals of the published texts. £} Springer</page><page sequence="4">138 N. Gavryushin self-preservation, and "disinterested" ready for self-sacrifice to the sublime values of Eternity. However, Nicanor regards the question "whether we can - and if so, to what extent - consider man's personal will to be free in his choice of these inclinations, i.e., in the determination of his final goals" as the most difficult of all questions because it presupposes the correlation of personal will with the Universal will (HfficaHop (BpoBKOBHM) apxiien 1909, p. 544). There is a trace of the neo-Leibnizian trend in his personalist reasoning, though, in the final analysis, Nicanor did not fully identify with it. We meet it again in Veniamin Snegirev (1841-1889). The last-named revealed in a remarkable way the somatic aspect of personal ism in his summary of Tertullian, whom he took as having "profoundly understood" Christ and Christianity (CHernpeB 1997, pp. 238-239). Here, Snegirev uses terms which later appear in Tareev and Archimandrite Cyprian (Kern). Later on, he paid much attention to unconscious and paranormal manifestations of the human psyche, though moving on to concentrate on conscious manifestations, leaving aside the somatic aspect. He uses neo-Leibnizian philosophical terms to refer to the human Ego as a "point of energy," an "atom sui generis" and a "monad" (Ibid). The idea of Ego, personality or ^//-awareness becomes a kind of hypostatic manifestation of the one self-identical principle (Ibid p. 202). Snegirev's student, Victor Nesmelov, worked within the emerging trend toward the asomatic treatment of personality. As he pointed out in the preface to his Science of Man (1895-1896), "positive science," i.e., experimental natural science, experimental psychology included, cannot solve the "great riddle of philosophy," viz. define the essence of man. Nesmelov conceded only one field to it, which has no bearing on the heart of the matter: "It can &lt; . . . &gt; regard man solely as food for worms" (HecMcnoB 1997, I, p. 214). As he later took up the problem of Resurrection, Nesmelov dismissed the issue of the identity of the dead and the resurrected body saying that "man owes his identity solely to the unity of his personality" (HecMcnoB 1997, II, p. 309). Nesmelov was certainly not an Augustinian or a voluntarist. He acknowledged the dependence of will on the content of consciousness, which indicates the inner development of the human personality (HecMcnoB 1997, I, p. 342). Metropolitan Anthony (Khrapovitskij) was very close to Nesmelov though utterly independent of him. He argued with Nesmelov from the Augustinian point of view on the primacy of will to reason. Anthony borrowed from Kant the idea that the very act of "... self-cognition and self-objectivizing occurs through activity, through the tension of willpower, through volitional orientation to things, and thus not by theoretical but by practical reason" (Ahtohhi! (XpanoBHUKHfi) enncicon 1900, p. 544). According to Anthony, the creatively free, "assertoric Ego of Kant" helps us to "dispel the illusory anthropomorphism of outer things" and arrive at the idea of the Absolute Personality, which "is the basic category of reason that has both a formal and a real meaning to our mind - again as our Ego: the positive meaning of activity £) Springer</page><page sequence="5">The concept of personality in Russian theological literature 139 and the negative meaning of freedom, which again blend in one - creation and personality" (AhtohhH (XpanoBHUKHfi) enHCKon 1900, p. 613) Tareev's personalism is essentially linked to his soteriology and Christology. It crystallized in his Master's thesis The Temptation of God Incarnate (1892) (TapeeB 1892) in which he sought to penetrate "the mystery of the human Person" of Jesus Christ "from the point of His temptations" (TapeeB 1892, p. 19). Russian theology had never used such language before, and had never attempted to unveil the "mystery of the Person" through an analysis of His "temptations." In this Tareev was certainly influenced by Dostoyevsky, whom he frequently quoted, by Renan and the Tubingen school. As he accentuated the innermost moral mission of the Incarnate Person of the Savior (implicitly counterpoised to its outward, juridical treatment), Tareev, at the same time, also ascribed ontological personal features to the Tempter, thus creating a quasi-Manichean picture of the struggle between good and evil. Tareev held that "... the Church does not limit the free personal activity of any of its sons, nor does it deprive them of direct personal communion with their Redeemer" (TapeeB 1892, p. 20), and that it "... leaves ample room for research by the personal mind" (TapeeB 1892, p. 20). His basic premises are not unlike certain passages of Alexei Khomjakov, whom Tareev accused of Protestant arbitrariness. Tareev viewed personalism and the principle of Christian freedom as indivisible. He contrasted personal faith to historical Christianity and "personal creativity" to the tyranny of the Church Tradition. As Tareev saw it, personal freedom equally implies the freedom of spirit and body. In that sense, his personalist concept was expressly somatic and bore an explicit anti-ascetic message, unlike Nesmelov's. According to Tareev, personal vocation to inner work rules out the reception of the spiritual ideal from the outside in an unchangeable form, established once and forever. Tareev was convinced that the sacrifice of Christ is properly understood not as an outer action but as a personal religious experience of exceptional importance. Here, Tareev is at one with Metropolitan Anthony (Khrapovitsky). In Anthony's view, this religious experience was love as compassion for the entire human race, and for Tareev it was the rejection of outer power, might and perfection for glory in humility. The theological purport of all this is quite transparent: only inner moral self- determination can be the basis of personal salvation, the first step to which is the moral heroism of God Incarnate. In his Orthodox Doctrine of Salvation (1896), Sergius (Stragorodskij) endows the concept of personality with ambivalent meanings and connotations. On the one hand, he rejects the emphasis on personal effort toward salvation with genuine anti- Pelagian force (CTparopoacKHfi Ceprnfl 1898, p. 78) and contrasts divine grace and its closest connotations to such efforts. The idea of personal salvation is tolerated only as a transition to a state in which (as in medieval mystical ecstasy) the awareness of selfhood is completely de- actualized. As Sergius has it, the personal is logically linked to self-interest and egotism. Likewise, he refuses to include it as a goal of salvation! When man £} Springer</page><page sequence="6">140 N. Gavryushin concentrates on his own personal and exclusive salvation, his goal is egotistical and therefore blatantly sinful. Whoever poses his own salvation as his goal is alien to God. Thus, personal salvation should not be the goal of religious life. The latter presupposes total rejection of the previous person, "putting off the old man" and giving birth to the new man, that is, spiritual transfiguration. Striving toward the Truth demands self-abnegation and rejection of everything personal and subjective, i.e., depersonalization. Such a perspective on the sinner's person is proper to him alone, however. To him, his old self vanishes, and he is reborn in a new self only by rejecting the old, even though objectively, in God's eyes, he remains the same self. Thus, phenomenologically, selfhood must be rejected for the cause of salvation. Here Sergius is at one with the quietist ideal. However, selfhood is important, ontologically, as the object of God's love. Here, the Russian theologian is close to Malebranche and even Origen and Meister Eckhart, for charisma, i.e., freedom, is an extra-temporal gift. Personality discovers itself in God, since only with God does it acquire the plenitude of personal communion. This act of Divine Truth is performed in an evident contrast with personal wellbeing as the goal of this life to holiness, in which the true human self, that is pleasing to the Lord, reveals itself (CTparopoacKHfi CeprHfi 1898, p. 156). Close to Sergius' Orthodox Doctrine of Salvation is the soteriological theory of Archbishop Michael (Mudjugin), which directly links the concept of personality to that of subjectivity. Archbishop Michael describes egotism as the lowest state of human spiritual activity, which is comparable to, or might be identified with, slavery (MynbiorHH MHxami 1973, p. 171) The works of Sergius (Stragorodskij) and Michael (Mudjugin) fit, in principle, into the personalist program for reforming Orthodox dogmatic theology, which was advanced rather explicitly by Professor Alexej Vvedenskij of the Moscow Theological Academy (1861-1913). (BBefleHCKHft 1886).3 From a comparison of the dogmatic systems by Metropolitan Macarius (Bulgakov) and Archimandrite Sylvester (Malevansky),4 he concluded that the latter had the benefit of an orientation to the free and intelligent personality and its intellectual requirements (BBeaeHCKHfi 1886, p. 132). The Kantian discourse on the autonomy of the moral law is the dynamic background for Vvedenskij's arguments in favor of the superiority of Sylvester's system. As Vvedenskij saw it, for Macarius (Bulgakov) the dogma was a heteron- omous law (BBejieHcicnH 1886, p. 133). As for Sylvester (Malevanskij), "... the dogma is not only a yoke imposed on me from without but also a burden I strive for as it accords with the essential requirements of my nature, and is the norm and basis of religious life" (BBeAeHCKHH 1886, p. 298). Vvedenskij is at one in his personalist premises with Tareev, to whom he refers directly (BBeaeHCKHfi 1886, p. 205). 3 Not to be mistaken for neo-Kantian philosopher Alexander I. Vvedensky. Later Archbishop. £) Springer</page><page sequence="7">The concept of personality in Russian theological literature 141 The development of Father Pavel Florenskij's concept of personality took quite a different turn. He turned traditional folklore personifications into a personalist metaphysics as early as in The Universal Human Roots of Idealism (1908). His metaphysics personified the woods, wells, stars and the elements, endowing them with selfhood, while magical manipulations with names promised control of personal will and even bodies and their locations. Here, Florensky assumes that the name is the norm of personal being, and the name is primal in the respect to the empirical personalities of its bearers, in a hypothesis he straightforwardly advances as Church doctrine. Hence follows the hierarchical subjection of the Person of Christ to His Name: "Christianity is the preaching of the Name of Jesus Christ and of the Gospel, an appeal to profess the Name of Christ, while we have substituted the profession of Jesus Christ Himself for the profession of the Name" (O/iopeHCKHfl II. 1990, p. 330). The Cross-Name correlation remains rather ambiguous as, in his Philosophy of Cult, Florensky argues that even the Cross of Christ is a person (&lt;I&gt;;iopeHCKH8 n 1977, p. 91). If we accept his logic, the primeval name of the Cross as person should exist. Archimandrite Cyprian {Kern) places personality at the crux of all theological problems, and lays special emphasis on it. For Cyprian Antiquity was not able to grasp that idea to a full extent because it was ignorant of the Divine basis of the person, while the flawed Old Testament idea of personality was replaced by the idea of "cooperative personalism." Vladimir Losskij first came across the problem of personality when studying Meister Eckhart, according to whom "... the chosen will not be depersonalized in grace: possessing everything in common, they will differ from each other, in a way, producing a multitude transcending the number" (Lossky 1960, p. 189). Losskij repeatedly returned to the idea, as his pneumatological conception tied in with his personalism. As he wrote, "... to all appearances, there are as many forms of union with God as there are humans, because every human personality presupposes unique and absolutely inimitable relations with God, and as many manifestations of holiness are possible in Heaven as there are, were, and will be personal fates on earth" (JIoccKHii 2000, p. 283).5 For Losskij, the sources of Christian personalism should be sought in St. Gregory of Nyssa, for in his writing "... we find the only concept of the image (or the expression 'in the image') that might correspond to the criteria of Christian anthropology. Man made 'in the image' is a personality capable of revealing God to the extent to which his nature allows deifying grace to penetrate it" (JIocckhH 2000, p. 318). At the same time, as we said above, Losskij paid tribute to the mystical- naturalistic concept of salvation by advancing the idea of distinguishing between redemption and salvation, attributing the former to impersonal "human nature" and the latter to "personality" (JIocckhH 2000, p. 554). 5 "The Incarnation and the redemption of Christ, separated from the oikonomia of the Holy Spirit, cannot substantiate the personal magnitude of the Church, which is just as essential as its natural unity in Christ" - JIocckmH (2000, p. 287). "The new unity of our nature in Christ shall not rule out the 'poly- hypostasis' of man" - Ibid, p. 575. ^ Springer</page><page sequence="8">142 N. Gavryushin Sergei Jepifanovic (1866-1918) was among the first Russian theologians to regard the specifics of the philosophy of St. Maxim the Confessor through the prism of the concept of personality, which is its differentia specified. Proceeding from an understanding of Platonism as a "pantheistic system" that does not "distinguish between God and the creature not between personal will and intention," Jepifanovic contrasts it to St. Maxim's voluntarism and personalism. The interpretation of St. Maxim by Archpriest Vladimir Baskirov not only proceeds from Jepifanovic but also follows Urs von Balthasar, though occasionally argues with the latter. Baskirov dramatically complicates the theme of personality, bringing in the concept of tropos, though not in the meaning of Svjatoslav's Izbomik of 1073. Expounding Maxim the Confessor in Losskij's paradigm, Baskirov emphasizes that "... in any activity whatever, the primary act (actus primus) belongs to nature, while fulfillment (actus secundus) pertains to the person &lt; ... &gt; Freedom of nature and personal freedom blend according to him in a unity that installs the created being above the antagonism of freedom and necessity, and identifies it, to an extent, with the Lord" (BauiKHpoB 2006, p. 91). What would St. John of Damascus and Archimandrite Alexis (Rzanitsyn) say to that? * * * The concept of personality, with its connotations and semantic nuances, as compared to that of the "person," appeared in Russian theology as late as the first third of the 19th century largely under the impact of German religious-philosophical and secular literature. Even then it brought forward the somatic aspect correlated with the doctrine of Incarnation (Archimandrite Theodore Bukharev). In due course its importance increased significantly, especially in the conceptions of Tareev and Archimandrite Cyprian Kern. At the same time, Nesmelov developed a fundamen- tally asomatic treatment of personality. Florenskij's rather exotic position can be brought together with the latter only with considerable reservations, since he treated personality as a function of name. The treatment of the nature-personality relation also varied. Some, such as Archimandrite Alexis Rzanitsyn, regarded it in conformity with St. John of Damascus, while others, such as as Lossky and Baskirov, deviated considerably from him. On the whole, a trend to a personalist re-orientation of Russian theology became ever more pronounced throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Alexej Vvedenskij placed emphasis on it, while Tareev, Patriarch Sergius Stragorodskij, and Archbishop Michael Mudjugin developed it with profound originality. The phenomenological plane of personality receded into the background to make room instead for the plenitude of its ontological status. References AhtohmH (XpanoBMUKHft), entfCKon (1900).
