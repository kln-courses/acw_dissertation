<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Question of Immortality Marjorie Suchocki "If a man die, shall he live again?" Increasingly, the modern answer to the ancient question is negative, finding a strong basis for its conclusions in the hard realities of a finite world. Perpetual perishing characterizes existence, and the notion of immortality is scarcely more than wishful thinking, or perhaps even the defiance of the human spirit as it prefers an illusion to the acceptance of its own death. Theologians have joined secular thinkers in renunciation of immortality, adding theological reasons to the material evidence against this hope. Schu- bert M. Ogden, for example, argues in "The Meaning of Christian Hope" that the desire for existence after death issues from a basic denial of "the essential difference between God and man-the Creator and the creature, and Redeemer and the redeemed." Such a desire for immortality constitutes a reenactment of the primal sin, which is "precisely the desire to be like God."' By aspiring to an immortal condition, one is coveting for oneself the prerogatives of God, who alone has immortality. Is not this the sin of idolatry, of self-centeredness rather than God-centeredness? Far more fitting for hu- manity is recognition of our creaturely dependence upon God, with a conse- quent affirmation of this life and this world. Such an affirmation releases us for renewed efforts toward a better world for all peoples. As for the hope of immortality, it remains in the confidence that the significance of our efforts and all our values are retained everlastingly, without loss of vividness, in the memory of God. The beauty of Ogden's view lies in the appreciation and zest it engenders toward a world in which we are responsible for creating value. In this sense, and to the degree that immortality involves the idolatry he suggests, his argu- ments call for Christian assent. However, there is another dimension to the doctrine of immortality which is not addressed by arguments such as Ogden's, and this dimension-the overcoming of evil-calls for continued theological consideration of the question of immortality. New Testament texts and the witness of the early church fathers indicate that this doctrine is not related to the desire for unending existence in and for itself, but to the 1 Schubert M. Ogden, "The Meaning of Christian Hope," Union Seminary Quarterly Review 30 (1975): 153-64; quotations from p. 161. 288</page><page sequence="2">The Question of Immortality urgency of the dark issue of evil and its overcoming. The temporal world does not exhibit the victory of a wholly good God over evil, despite the sign of this victory in the Cross and Resurrection. Christian faith asserts, against the strength of evil experienced in the world, that God is yet the overcomer, the great redeemer from evil. But the burden of this assertion rests in the hope of an immortality involving the life of the person beyond physical death. By reexamining this dimension of the doctrine, we may judge the contemporary need to construct anew a viable interpretation of immortality. Ogden's valu- able insights must be retained, but we must strive to go beyond them. The process philosophy utilized by Ogden also provides a conceptual framework in which to attempt this wider answer to the question of immortality. THE NEW TESTAMENT WITNESS Even a brief look at modern interpretations of the texts reveals that for New Testament writers subjective immortality was an integral component in God's victory over evil. Norman Perrin, in his interpretation of the Gospel of Mark, finds a dual culmination of the book in the parallel notions of passion and parousia: both speak of a suffering which is answered by a fullness of life. The passion has its primary reference to the death of Jesus, which was answered by the Resurrec- tion. However, the Markan references to the passion appear to go beyond this death itself, to include "many things" (Mark 9:12b).2 This broader identifi- cation of suffering relates to the sense in which the Markan readers partici- pated in the passion of Christ through their own trials. Just as the suffering of Christ was answered through resurrection, even so their own suffering will be answered through a fullness of life to be received at the parousia: Christ, as the Son of Man, will break in upon the present age, bringing the fulfillment already begun to its ultimate consummation. The parousia, as the sign of that consummation, is therefore of equal force with the passion: it is the trium- phant answer to the experience of suffering. In the movement from passion through resurrection to parousia, the church experiences its redemptive inclu- sion in Christ's victory over evil. Passion was the present experience of the church; parousia was future and was thus framed in apocalyptic imagery. Yet the parousia formed a vital aspect of present experience as well for the Markan reader through the di- mension of hope and anticipation which it provided: the action of hope transformed suffering, removing its finality and placing it in the context of 2 Norman Perrin, "Towards an Interpretation of the Gospel of Mark," in Christology and a Modern Pilgrimage: A Discussion with Norman Perrin, ed.

Those within a paragraph refer to the one being discussed unless otherwise indicated. 289</page><page sequence="3">The Journal of Religion Christ's passion and resurrection. Parousia was a present transcendence of suffering, infusing as it did the present reality with the meaning of the future. Note, however, that the power of this proleptic force depended upon continu- ity between the believer's present and future: if there is no future fullness of life beyond suffering neither is there a basis for redeeming hope. Only if it is the believer's actual future can the parousia qualify the believer's present; the essential presupposition is that the believer will experientially share in the glory of Christ. Death cannot preclude the believer's participation in this glory, for death itself is overcome in the victory of Christ's resurrection. The believer's future experience despite death and beyond death is thus essential to the symbolism of the parousia: parousia answers passion; immortality an- swers evil. While the Gospel of Mark reflects a primary use of apocalyptic imagery to convey a Christian hope related to a future life, the Gospel of John gives greater emphasis to the sense in which eternal life is a present event. Can this be read as an alternative understanding, whereby the overcoming of evil is not related to the personal immortality of the believer? For the Johannine evangelist writes, "We have seen his glory" (John 1:14); "the man who hears my words and has faith in him who sent me possesses eternal life" (John 5:24); "now is the judgment of this world, now will the Prince of this world be driven out" (John 13:31). Raymond E. Brown, in his commentary on John,3 considers the heavy emphasis upon a realized eschatology in this gospel to be a balancing mea- sure, a corrective against the danger of allowing Christian belief to devolve into a mystery religion due to a preoccupation with the future. The evangelist of John, no less than the writer of Mark, relies upon both future and present experience to express the fullness of Christian life. Regardless of the scholars' debate as to whether the Johannine future does or does not include apocalyp- tic elements, there is wide agreement that this future does refer to life after death as an integral component of redemption from evil. "To suggest that the Fourth Gospel is so much in the atmosphere of realized eschatology that the writer expects no further victory over evil than that won in the victorious hour of Jesus' life is to reduce him to a hopeless romantic who cannot recog- nize existing evil in the world."4 Brown further points out that the glory of Jesus which men have seen on earth is to be supplemented by a future vision of glory in the Father's presence (17:24), that the intervention of death can- not destroy eternal life (11:25), and that Christian life exhibits a tension between a victory already won and a victory still to be won (12:31-34, 1 John 2:13, 1 John 5:4-5). Thus in John as well as in Mark the intimations of immortality relate to deliverance from evil. 3 Raymond E. Brown, The Gospel according to John, I-XII (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday &amp; Co., 1966), pp. lii-lvi, cxv-cxxi. 4 Ibid., p. 477. 290</page><page sequence="4">The Question of Immortality Even the primarily catechetical Epistle of James includes reference to an eschatalogical dimension of Christian hope. This work, directed to the Chris- tian congregation as it struggled with frustrations in social and personal hopes, reinforces exhortations to temporal perseverance by referring to a fu- ture consummation of the salvation now begun. This future hope belonging to the Christian community gave meaning and zest to temporal efforts; apart from this hope, the present existence easily degenerated to futility. Redemp- tion, the overcoming of evil, the answer which Christian hope offered to an existence beset with anguish and anxiety thus included two dimensions: a present reality wherein one lived and acted from the confidence of God's love, and a future reality transcending the present world, in which God's love would be experienced in its fullness of perfection. This was the "crown of life" of which James spoke (1:12); it involved a final judgment which was an acquittal from evil and its effects, and a consequent full maturation of life at "the coming of the Lord" (5:7). The imagery used is organic, either of decay unto death (1:10, 11, 15), or of growth unto life (1:4, 21; 3:18; 5:7); the counsel is that of present patience in good works in anticipation of a culmi- nating fruition at the coming of the Lord. Despite the very divergent approaches within the three New Testament books briefly cited here, each demonstrates a dynamic interrelationship be- tween the Christian's future and his present. Just as the present cannot be abstracted from the individual's experience neither can the future, as in its own time the future must become the individual's present. For it is the Chris- tian, in his/her concrete actuality, who must be redeemed from evil; if the consummation of this redemption is always future, then it is never actual, and the Christian is not redeemed. If God is to overcome evil wholly, there must be some "present" in which the individual fully realizes his/her redemption from evil in the depths of experience. The biblical writers use imagery of both realized and final eschatology to convey the assuredness of this present; the usefulness of this imagery such that it is pervasively appropriated by the Christians is precisely in its unqualified assertion of a mode of life awaiting the individual beyond this world's present experience. The contemporary theological task of clarifying scriptural texts through demythologization may well question the continued usefulness of the imagery, but care must be taken to preserve the central insight, which is the fullness of redemption from evil for each individual. THE WITNESS OF THE EARLY CHURCH The importance of immortality to the overcoming of evil is also central in the developing doctrines of the early church. These doctrinal developments took the following three forms: (1) Evil was sin and its punishment, with death as 291</page><page sequence="5">The Journal of Religion the punishment. Victory over sin entailed the abolition of the punishment; hence immortality was essential to the victory. (2) In a somewhat similar vein, evil was considered to be the frustration of man's intended growth toward goodness and toward God:5 man's proper destiny is God and immor- tality. The overcoming of evil is the restoration of man to his destiny. (3) As the Roman influence gained ground, evil was considered in relation to jus- tice. But justice does not prevail in the temporal world; immortality is re- quired. Three of the church fathers-Ignatius of Antioch, Irenaeus, and Ter- tullian-provide examples of these respective developments. Ignatius clearly sets forth his association of death with sin: it is because of man's disobedience that man incurs death (Magnesians 5. 2). This death, however, is twofold, for those who die unredeemed suffer "not a mere tempo- rary death, but one which shall endure forever" (Trallians 11. 2). Here Igna- tius is foreshadowing the Augustinian dictum that all evil is sin and its pun- ishment (see, for instance, Augustine On True Religion 12. 23). Evil is first the disobedience which turns man from his true end, and second the loss of that true end in everlasting death. The overcoming of evil must speak to both dimensions of the problem, to disobedience and to everlasting death. For Ignatius, Jesus Christ provides this comprehensive victory over evil; his death provides forgiveness of sins, and his resurrection reverses the destruction of death (Trallians 2. 1). Henceforth, faith in Christ releases the believer from everlasting death; death is then the prelude to true and everlasting life. It is what Ignatius refers to as "attaining to God" (Trallians 12. 2). Ignatius speaks most fully about this notion of attaining to God as he awaits his martyrdom; he instructs the Roman Christians to whom he writes not to pray for his release but to rejoice in his imminent realization of his full being in God. He shall "pass from the world to God" (Romans 2. 2), he shall "be the freedman of Jesus and shall rise again emancipated in him" (4. 1, 2), and he shall then "indeed be a man of God" (6. 2). For Ignatius, "eternal life" seems to refer to the life of God in the believer, experienced here and now in the world, while "immortality" signifies the life of the believer in God. Paradoxically, then, physical death becomes the means whereby the believer escap6s death, for it initiates him into the fullness of redemption, which is active participation in the immortality of God. Immortality, then, is more than an expression of the believer's reception of new life in this world. Rath- er, it is the "attainment of God" which awaits the believer following death; it is the completion of salvation and the ultimate overcoming of disobedience and death. Thus an immortality which involves the participation of the be- liever is at the heart of this doctrine of redemption-for indeed, if the believer is left to a death "which shall endure forever," then evil is in no sense fully answered. The overcoming of evil requires subjective immortality. 5 This section follows the usage of "man" rather than the more appropriate "humanity," since it is a representation of the views of the church fathers, who consistently used the more restrictive term. 292</page><page sequence="6">The Question of Immortality Throughout the five books of Against Heresies, Irenaeus interprets man in terms of his destiny, which is ultimately to share God's immortality (3. 19. 1; 5. 1. 1). Like Ignatius, Irenaeus understands evil to be the sin of disobedience and its fruit, which is death, but he goes beyond Ignatius in his analysis of the manner in which evil has frustrated human destiny. Man's purpose in history is to grow toward the capacity to see and appre- hend God (4. 37. 7); this capacity is to be developed through obedience to God in the covenant designed for man at his particular stage of history (4. 9. 3). Through disobedience, however, man is blinded to God and given over to the power of evil in bondage to the devil. This bondage, in turn, prevents man's destined union with God; man is therefore in a state of alienation from God (3. 19. 1). And finally, this union with God was also to be the destiny toward immortality; sin, however, required death, lest the malevolent effects of disobedience remain forever (3. 23. 6). Bondage to the devil, alienation from God, and death are thus the threefold fruits of sin; these are the evils to be overcome if man is to be restored to his destiny. Christ is the correction of the fault and the restoration of the destiny. As God incarnate, Christ is the perfect union of God and man, bringing God to man and lifting man to God (3. 19. 1). As representative man-a second Adam-Christ renders perfect obedience to the law of love; by his unde- served death he requites the debt of sin, breaking the power of death and bondage to the devil (5. 1. 1). As a result of this union and this work, there- fore, Christ overcomes alienation, death, and the devil, conferring immortali- ty upon what, through sin, had become mortal (3. 20. 2). Man participates in this overcoming of evil through his union with Christ by faith; he then receives the Holy Spirit. Through the enabling of the Spirit, who is a "ladder of ascent to God" (3. 24. 1), man resumes the pathway of obedience toward the end of a full maturity, which is "promotion into God" (3. 19. 1; 4. 5. 1). Since it is the Spirit who enables man for the requisite obedience to God, the goal is sure: the Spirit is thus the "earnest of incorrup- tion" (3. 24. 1) and the "pledge of immortality" (5. 10. 1). That Irenaeus in no sense considers the fullness of redemption to be experi- enced solely in this life is evident throughout his writings, but perhaps partic- ularly so in his treatment of Adam. In 3. 23 Irenaeus goes to great lengths to indicate the importance of Adam's salvation in God. Adam is the first fruit of the victory for the devil. It is fitting and necessary that the first fruit be taken from the devil's grasp, for "neither would the enemy appear to be as yet conquered if the old spoils remained with him" (3. 23. 2). Therefore Adam, who once died, is now rescued by Christ from the bonds of death and the devil and participates in immortality in God. For Irenaeus, then, subjective immortality is not only necessary to redemp- tion, it is redemption. This state, following from the lessons learned through obedience to God in the temporal world, is the end and destiny of man- immortality is the overcoming of evil in an everlasting union with God. 293</page><page sequence="7">The Journal of Religion Ignatius illustrates immortality as abolition of the punishment of sin; Ire- naeus illustrates immortality as the restoration of human destiny; Tertullian illustrates the third sense in which the church fathers considered immortality as essential to God's victory over evil: the vindication of the justice of God. In this context, immortality as reward or punishment is far deeper an issue than the bliss or agony of an individual, for it relates to God's victory over evil in his ultimate and wholly righteous reign over the cosmos. "Not otherwise is one fully good unless jealous of evil," writes Tertullian in the treatise Against Marcion (1. 26); this goodness which is justice absolutely requires immortality for its manifestation. The necessity of immortality for the reign of justice follows first from Tertullian's understanding of the nature of God and second from the ambiguity of justice in the world. Tertullian develops his doctrine of God particularly in his writings against the Marcionite position, which separated the qualities of justice and goodness. The two qualities, argues Tertullian, are inseparable, controlling each other: God, to be good, must be just, for true goodness cannot permit the triumph of evil. Goodness, therefore, is manifest- ed through justice. This justice is understood to entail the reward of the righteous and the punishment of the wicked. The world, however, does not exhibit any neat division of reward and punishment for the virtuous and the wicked. The justice of God, then, and the ambiguity of the world together demand an immortality in which right- eousness shall indeed reign. This perfect manifestation of justice begins neces- sarily immediately following death with the soul in Hades: "Would it not be the highest possible injustice even in Hades if all were to be still well with the guilty even there and not well with the righteous even yet? What, would you have hope be still more confused after death. Would you have it mock us still more with uncertain expectations?" (De Anima 53) The judgment thus begun shall eventually be culminated with an apocalyptic final judgment, wherein there will be a resurrection of the body in order that justice may accrue to the whole man, body and soul. Here again, Tertullian argues the issue passion- ately, asserting in On the Resurrection of the Flesh that such justice is the princi- pal and sufficient cause for a belief in the resurrection: "The entire cause then, or rather necessity of the resurrection will be this: namely, that arrange- ment of the final judgment which shall be most suitable to God." Were it to be otherwise, God would be unjust (14). This is but a brief summary of these three positions insofar as they associate immortality with God's victory over evil; the texts I have cited are but a few from the many which support this interpretation. Given this evidence, it is exceedingly problematic whether the early church fathers ever considered immortality in terms reflecting self-assertiveness or idolatry, which are the major two theological objections Ogden and others have raised against the doctrine. Rather, the issue is sheerly God's victory over evil. Irenaeus, in 294</page><page sequence="8">The Question of Immortality Against Heresies 3. 23. 1, provides a concise summary of the classical concern: "The whole economy of salvation regarding man came to pass according to the good pleasure of the Father in order that God might not be conquered, nor his wisdom lessened in the estimation of his creatures. For if man, who had been created by God that he might live, after losing life through being injured by the serpent that had corrupted him, should not any more return to life, but should be utterly and forever abandoned to death, God would in that case have been conquered, and the wickedness of the serpent would have prevailed over the will of God." THE CONTEMPORARY QUESTION Yet changes in time and place produce changes in the way we perceive our basic human condition; the needs of one era are not necessarily formulated in ways easily translated to the needs of another. Evil is no longer uniformly perceived as sin and its punishmepnt, nor is the redemption from evil strictly a matter pertaining to Christians in a world grown conscious of a valid plurali- ty of religions. Further, the issues of human destiny and the reign of justice are no longer so clearly and imperatively tied to the issue of God and the overcoming of evil. Is it the case, then, that because our perception of evil differs from that of our forebears, we no longer require the notion of subjec- tive immortality? Ogden has moved in this direction. On page 155 he speaks of evil in terms of the continuous loss which qualifies temporal experience, and he refashions the Christian hope to answer this loss: "Because [God's] love of others is literally boundless, whatever comes to be is fully embraced by his love, where it is retained forever without loss of vividness." The divine memory, in Ogden's view, retains the value of the individual, thus preventing the evil which is loss. Objective rather than subjective immortality is thus the proper Christian hope, since it preserves the objective value of all things and directs human efforts toward improving the value of the world. However, if we look more closely at the kinds of loss which characterize existence, I suggest we will find that we, like our early predecessors, must have recourse to the doctrine of subjective immortality if we are to under- stand God as the overcomer of evil. For we do not perceive loss solely as death, even though that term be extended to cover the death of the past insofar as we cannot retain it in its vividness in our finite memories. Indeed, a finite memory which retained the full vividness of the past would be a doubtful privilege, since the sense of the past would then crowd out the openness to novelty in the present. All existence would be trapped in the confines of one experience, and life-if the term could apply-would be static rather than dynamic. The loss of the past, then, is not the evil it sometimes 295</page><page sequence="9">The Journal of Religion appears to be and is surely not the evil which stirs our spirits to long for redemption. Nor is loss confined simply to those evils sustained through the course of being a finite creature in a finite world. If death were the sole loss to be sustained, then we could renounce a doctrine of immortality in the recogni- tion that finitude is limitation and death is our ultimate limit. Our affirma- tions would then concern an existence whose very limitations give it brilliance and intensity, for the sense of transience can highlight the wonder that we exist at all. How can such a fragile gift be taken for granted? Finitude in and of itself is no lamentable evil but is our very creatureliness. We have cause to delight in these conditions of our existence and to know that the loss which is death is no unmitigated evil. The loss which pushes us to the notion of immortality is rather like the second and third points of the classical doctrine: Irenaeus spoke of evil as alienation from a destiny; Tertullian spoke of evil as a lack of justice. To consider the modern sense in which alienation from a destiny is still felt as evil, we do not require recourse to what Irenaeus posited as union with God, for we can stay within the human realm and still know the agonies of alienation. The sciences of humanity-sociology, psychology, anthropology- reveal the structure of human existence to be rich in potentialities for creative interaction in human community. The vision of what humanity can be is the lure which draws us onward toward actualization of that ideal, but the very vision of the ideal increases the sense of separation from the ideal. If an ideal of freedom in community, of human interaction for the mutual good of all members in the society of the world, is perceived as human destiny, then we confess that we have not yet attained to our union with humanity, let alone union with God. In this context, the sense of loss is not related to the lessened vividness of the past, nor to the boundary of death, but to that loss which measures the distance between what we can be and what we are. Several political philosophies speak specifically to this problem, yet regard- less of the ways in which we seek to conquer this alienation from a fully human destiny the haunting dilemma persists that the very striving toward the ideal reinforces the sense of alien otherness, both with regard to the ideal and with regard to the human community. The ideal itself fosters "either/or" judgments with respect to our identity. If we take the ideal as representing our essential humanity we experience our actual existence as "other"; if, conversely, we define ourselves according to the actualities of the present the ideal remains elusively other. There remains, of course, the alternative of finding our essential humanity in creative affirmation of the very striving toward the ideal-and yet we then meet the existential problem wherein forces for change encounter the resistance of the established past; striving toward an ideal, all too often degenerates into strife with each other-disuni- ty, rather than the ideal community, too frequently reigns. The road to full 296</page><page sequence="10">The Question of Immortality humanity is grimly long and bitter. Our situation is not unlike that noted in the New Testament texts: we experience a tension between present and fu- ture and require a sense of real continuity between present and future such that the vision of a future does not reduce the experience of the present to one of longing and loss. The continuity required cannot be provided through the temporal world. If we look only to the lessons of history for our encouragement we see the checkered board of human triumph matched by human holocaust. Futility and despair are as justified by history as zest and optimism; the impetus to an effective hope must come from beyond history itself. Ogden's proposal begins to speak to the problem, for he centers the bridge between present and future in the constant actuality of God's love. God preserves the value of the present in his everlasting memory and responds continuously to the world in light of the contributions of each successive present, luring the world toward its high- est destiny. The only difficulty we find in this proposal is that it does not alleviate the sense of loss for the individual's living experience. That is, the individual him/herself does not participate in the future save through antici- pation, but since it is not the future of the particular individual, anticipation is undercut by personal loss. Like the New Testament believers we require a sense of personal inclusion in the envisioned fullness of life in order to realize its effective anticipation. This is not an encouragement to self-assertiveness and idolatry; it is simply affirmation of the full humanity of the vision: the many are to be as one in creative interaction and mutual love-the commu- nity is inclusive, not exclusive; its ultimate fulfillment is the. inclusion of all, not the exclusion of many. Yet if the vast majority of participants in human history are excluded from the fulfilled vision, is there not a pervasive sense of loss haunting the fulfillment? Does not this loss contradict the vision itself? Objective immortality, or one's remembrance even by God, does not answer the problem since this objectifies and hence excludes the immediacy of indi- vidual experience. Resolution to the difficulty remains now, as in early Chris- tian experience, a sense of real participation in the fulfillment of human destiny. This participation is provided neither by present temporal experi- ence nor by divine memory; subjective immortality is required. The dimension of justice is also pertinent to the modern experience of evil and hope for redemption. The need is heightened beyond that of Tertullian's time, for sociology and psychology have increased our awareness of ambigui- ties in responsibility and guilt. While the ancient problem of sin is undoubt- edly involved, this in itself neither clarifies nor simplifies the problem of justice: the human freedom which establishes responsibility is a matter of degree not easily determined, due to the complexities of interaction between individual and environmental factors. Maltreated children are a case in point: a child may suffer atrocities in which the psychological damage grossly surpasses the physical damage, so that the child never develops the human 297</page><page sequence="11">The Journal of Religion capacity to love. In his/her own adult life, the child may, in unhappy perpe- tuation of the evil, become a parent who inflicts similar injustice upon his/ her children. Where is the clear assignation of guilt? And more pressingly, where is the redemption in this world from such evils? How is there justice for those victims who are permanently marred through the effects of evil, beyond the ministering aid of social agencies or caring individuals? For many victims, evil is the final and overwhelming word; apart from redemption, this word remains in everlasting contradiction to the redemptive word of God. Christianity has asserted, through 2,000 years, that God is indeed the over- comer of evil. But an overcoming of evil which rests solely with the progress of the temporal world, or in the objective memory of God, or even in the fact that for many individuals the good in life far outweighs the evil, is no full overcoming of evil. The victory of God over evil must be greater than that which is experienced in the world, either individually or as a whole-but only a doctrine of God which allows subjective immortality for the world can provide such a vision of redemption. The contemporary world, no less than the ancient world, must raise the question of immortality in order to proclaim effectively that evil is not final and that God, in his justice, triumphs over every evil. A PROCESS VISION OF IMMORTALITY Ogden has noted that any advocacy of immortality requires a coherent philo- sophical basis if it is to be at all viable as an ingredient in contemporary hope; he himself utilizes the process philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead and Charles Hartshorne to develop the notion of objective immortality in the memory of God. But both Whitehead and Hartshorne provide intimations of an immortality in God which is more than objective memory. Whitehead speaks of the everlastingness of God, wherein "immediacy is reconciled with objective immortality."6 The sentence is opaque unless one is accustomed to Whitehead's unique terminology, but the very precision of the terminology gives the statement startling import. "Immediacy" is defined by Whitehead as the self-functioning of a subject, as "the real internal constitution of an actual entity" (PR, p. 38). "Objective immortality" is the "functioning of one actual entity in the self-creation of another" (ibid.). In the finite world, this objective immortality signifies the sense in which the values of the past have an objective participation in the becoming of present experience. But subjec- tivity-immediacy-has perished, insofar as the past is concerned, so that "immediacy" and "objective immortality" are successive rather than simulta- neous conditions. However, if the immediacy of an entity is retained in the 6 Alfred North Whitehead, Process and Reality (New York: Macmillan Publishing Co., 1929), p. 532; hereafter cited as PR. 298</page><page sequence="12">The Question of Immortality everlastingness of God, even while it functions in the self-creation of God, then indeed "immediacy is reconciled with objective immortality" (PR, p. 532). Hartshorne echoes this affirmation: ". . . the entity itself with all the reality of life it ever had, no more and no less, is added to the de facto sum of entities apprehended in the subsequent phases of the divine life. The saying that 'subjectivity is lost' . . . is misleading."' The type of immortality which a process conceptuality suggests is subjec- tive, retaining the living experience of the entity, but it transcends personality and therefore is not simply a duplication of finite conditions in an infinite realm. That is, within process thought a person is understood to be an indi- vidual composed of many actual entities making up the elements of the body; within the body there is a singular series of entities-the "soul"-which coor- dinates activities of the body in terms of characteristic purposes and goals. A person, then, is many "entities," and it is the entities themselves which are to be understood in terms of immortality rather than the person as a single whole. However, an immortality of entities is not less than personality but more, for it indicates that a person in every element of his or her experience is destined for God and not simply the person at one particular state of development. Every state is included. However, if every state is included, and if this immortality applies to every entity, personal and nonpersonal, which has ever existed, holding them all in the harmony which is God's own subjec- tivity, then the boundaries of personality have been left far behind as perti- nent solely to finite existence in the temporal world. In God's subjectivity, immortality would signify a mutual immediacy wherein every entity would feel its relationship to all others through the mediation of God's unity. This mutual immediacy would certainly extend to all entities which had contri- buted to the temporal series of personhood, but it would not be restricted to these entities. For the sense of an encompassing personality would be derived from God's inclusive unity rather than from finite exclusiveness. Thus a pro- cess vision of immortality indicates a multidimensional inclusion and tran- scendence of the finite personality. In order to develop these suggestions insofar as they pertain to the Chris- tian affirmation that God overcomes evil, it is necessary to indicate the basis of philosophical coherence underlying the vision. Whitehead gives a concept of God wherein God is a dynamically becoming actuality everlastingly incorporating the world into his own nature,8 integrat- ing the realities of the world with his own primordial vision of harmony. This 7 Charles Hartshorne, "Whitehead in French Perspective," Thomist 33 (1969): 575. 8 In this conceptuality, God is a singular entity and personal in the common (though not Whiteheadian) usage of the word. Therefore, a personal singular pronoun is appropriate in speaking of God. However, neither "he" nor "she" is strictly accurate, since in this view God includes masculine and feminine components, but transcends them both. The pronoun "he" is here used in application to God as a matter of literary convention, and is not to be taken as indicative of a deity restricted to masculinity. 299</page><page sequence="13">The Journal of Religion primordial vision is the conceptual unification of all possibilities whatsoever in terms of beauty and peace. Insofar as this divine harmony involves only possibilities it is necessarily abstract; insofar as the divine harmony is a guid- ed unification of the actualities of the world it is concrete. Thus God is the unity of the abstract and the concrete, for his primordial beauty is everlast- ingly manifested through the apotheosized world within his own nature. Despite this destined unity of the world with God, both God and the world transcend each other in their respective freedom. The process vision is one of a great rhythmic interchange between God and the world, such that God and the world are in a qualified sense the past and the future for each other, even though each transcends the other in its "presentness." The qualification is that this speculative vision posits God as one everlastingly present entity, so that strictly speaking every actuality incorporated into God shares that pre- sentness; no actuality is ever past to God. Nevertheless, the world can be called the past of God in this sense: God's reception of the world into himself is his apotheosis of the world and hence his transformation of the world. By virtue of the world's incorporation into the divine nature, its context is utterly changed. Since the actualities of the world are not retained in their original configuration, but are integrated instead into the divine harmony, that original configuration is past, even for God. But the actualities which created themselves through this matrix persist with- in the infinitely complex actuality which is God. The importance of this change of context for the overcoming of evil lies in the contextual nature of much that we feel as evil; the "pastness" of the original configuration of actualities is simultaneously the "pastness" of any evil which depends upon the configuration for its continued power. The manner in which an actuality which incorporates the pain of such evils into its very being nevertheless transcends this pain in God will be discussed below. The world is the future of God inasmuch as the presently becoming actual- ities of the world will, in their own turn and at their own completion, be taken into God. In this sense, we can say with Irenaeus that God is the destiny of the world, but now the corollary of this is that the world contrib- utes to the destiny of God. How the beauty of the primordial vision will be manifested in the dynamic glory of God depends in large measure upon what the world becomes; that this world shall be transformed in beauty depends upon God. For the freedom of God in his relation to the world as past and future lies precisely in his own everlasting presentness, governed by his eter- nal vision of beauty. God, in his own feeling for harmony, determines how the world will be unified in his own nature. Thus God's harmony rather than the world's discordancies prevails in God's own becoming; hence God's freedom with regard to the world, even as he incorporates it into himself. God is one; the world is many. Although God in this view must be infi- nitely complex, he is yet one unified being. The world, however, is understood 300</page><page sequence="14">The Question of Immortality as a countless number of infinitesimal subatomic actualities called "occasions of experience" by Whitehead. For each of these, God is both past and future. God is past, since his incorporation of the occasion's past into his divine harmony is part of the data of the becoming occasion of experience. This occasion becomes actual as it unifies the data of its past into its own unique present; for this process, a guiding principle of harmony is needed. God's harmony includes an accomplished unification of the occasion's past, yielding a specific and optimum possibility for the nascent occasion's own unification. God's overcoming of evil in his own nature is thus of prime influence in the becoming world, continuously presenting new possibilities for the temporal overcoming of evil. In Whitehead's words, "The reality of heaven passes back into the world"; it "qualifies this world so that each temporal actuality in- cludes it as an immediate fact of relevant experience" (PR, p. 532). God is the future of the occasions of the world in that whatsoever an occasion becomes that occasion of experience will be taken into God. In every instant of its completion, in every moment of its perishing, the world passes into its destiny in God. The world, then, exists from and to God-yet in the presentness of each of its occasions the world transcends God, freely becoming that which it alone chooses to become within the parameters of its possibili- ties. The world is ultimately responsible for itself in its presentness, just as God is responsible for himself. Each influences the other but is yet self-de- termined. The world is in no sense superfluous to God in this process vision: "Either of them, God and the World, is the instrument of novelty for the other" (PR, p. 529). Through his infinite resources in the primordial envisagement of all possibilities, God is the source and ground of novelty for the world, providing new possibilities of harmony for the world. But the world is also the source of novelty for God-not in the sense of possibility, but in the sense of actuality. The world, in its vividness of concrete experience, creates the novelty of a possibility made actual. From the perspective of our own worldly existence we frequently take the actuality of the world for granted; we are accustomed to the world and scarcely perceive the wonder of its existence. Yet this won- der nevertheless inheres in the world and is the gift of the world to God-who made it possible. He receives the wonder of the world's actuality, and, by interweaving it with his primordial vision of the beauty which can qualify every existent occasion, he brings the world to its everlasting culmination. This is indeed the world's "attainment to God." Yet it is the actuality of the world which is the wonder; it is the reality of its creative existence which is of prime importance. This reality lies precisely in the self-realization of every occasion of experience; it is the immediacy of its own creative significance for itself. If, then, the world contributes actuality to God, is not this accomplished in the highest sense insofar as the world con- tributes its living reality to God? Living actuality, rather than perished sub- 301</page><page sequence="15">The Journal of Religion jectivity, is the value of the world to God. In keeping with this, Whitehead says that the world is felt by God "in a unison of immediacy" (PR, p. 524), with "the retention of mutual immediacy" (PR, p. 525), and God is fulfilled "by his reception of the multiple freedom of actuality" (PR, p. 530) and by "a multiplicity of elements with individual self-realization" (PR, p. 531). The living reality of the world in its subjective experience is thus valued and retained by God. Unfortunately, Whitehead's affirmations that immediacy is retained in God do not include an explanation of how this is possible in terms of the philosophy. He does indicate that whereas the occasions in the world must negate a portion of another occasion's value this is not so for God: God does not take account of finite occasions selectively but in the entirety of their self-valuation. Therefore, while finite occasions disrupt the unity of another's total value, this is not the case for God. By preserving the unity, he also preserves the immediacy.9 Yet more than simple preservation is required if we wish to utilize the philosophy to answer the problem of evil as loss; and indeed, more is required if the essential dynamism of the philosophy is to be exemplified in the fullness of God. For simple preservation would often be the preservation of intense pain, frozen everlastingly in static reminder of an evil which was not overcome from the standpoint of the experiencing subject. The retention of immediacy must result in a mutuality of immediacy between God and the occasion; the mutuality must indicate the sense in which the occasion participates in God's immediacy, even while retaining its own. We might visualize the needed condition in the following manner. As not- ed above, every occasion comes into existence through its creative unification of every item in its own unique past. The procedure is this: a becoming occasion (1) is evoked by the transitional creativity generated by its unique past, (2) progressively unifies that past by negating or emphasizing its compo- nents in terms of its own requirement for harmony, and (3) attains its com- pletion in one determinate feeling called "satisfaction." This satisfaction then becomes a datum for succeeding becoming occasions which repeat the pro- cess. The second stage, that of unification, comprises the subjectivity of the occasion; it is here that the occasion decides the significance which it becomes in stage 3. But it is the third stage, the satisfaction, in which the occasion's creativity becomes transitional. Only at this stage, when the immediacy is completed, is the occasion available to another, even God. God might retain the occasion's immediacy-and provide for its transcen- dence-through the very completion with which he feels every occasion. That is, in accordance with Whitehead's categorial scheme, God would receive the occasion in its entirety upon its completion, or stage 3 as given above. But 9 Hartshorne develops this more fully than Whitehead in many of his writings, such as "Whitehead in French Perspective." 302</page><page sequence="16">The Question of Immortality God has previously received every occasion, in its entirety, from the subject's past. Therefore God fully knows both the third and the first conditions of the subject's immediacy. With his full knowledge of the third and the first terms, could God not reenact the second term-the living immediacy of the occasion itself? I say "reenact" rather than "duplicate" since there is no way in which the fullness of stages 3 and 1 could produce anything other than the self-same immediacy of the subject. Given the everlasting presentness of God, the reen- acted subject is not created "in time," and hence is not simply a second subjectivity, twin to the first. Rather, the effect is that the finite occasion is twice born, first in its own decisive creation of itself, and second in its re- creation-its resurrection-in God. In both cases, it would be the one subjec- tivity. There is, however, one momentous difference: the finite mode of the subjectivity was grounded in its own activity and hence perished with its conclusion; the divine mode of the subjectivity is grounded in God's recreat- ing activity and hence is as everlasting as God. It is reborn to immortality. But it would also be reborn to transcendence. Grounded in God's concres- cent activity, the occasion shares in God's own immediacy, even as God shares the immediacy of the occasion. This sharing, this participating in God, takes the immediacy of the occasion beyond its satisfaction, which was its finite completion, to a deeper completion in integration with God: "In this way God is completed by the individual fluent satisfactions of finite fact, and the temporal occasions are completed by their everlasting union with their transformed selves, purged into conformation with the eternal order which is the final absolute wisdom" (PR, p. 527). The possibility of this "fluent satis- faction" through which the occasion goes beyond itself might well stem from the fact that in God, the occasion's immediacy is reenacted from its satisfac- tion rather than toward its satisfaction, which was the case in its finite imme- diacy. In God, the occasion's satisfaction would be like an everlastingly re- tained basis from which immediacy would flow, constantly feeling the changing relations made possible through the manifested primordial vision of God. In this case, the occasion would always be truly itself-and truly God as well, in the mutuality of immediacy. "Creation achieves the reconciliation of permanence and flux when it has reached its final term which is everlasting- ness-the Apotheosis of the World" (PR, p. 529). In such a vision of immortality, how do the sensitivities concerning justice apply? For we are obviously discussing an immortality which not only goes beyond anthropomorphism, including as it does all occasions of the world whatsoever, but which entails a universal salvation for humanity as well. All actuality, not some actuality, is retained by God. How is there justice in this vision? For as Tertullian so clearly saw, God to be good must be just. Justice would apply to personal occasions in the sense of judgment, and the judgment would be in the form of the fullness of self-knowledge. For a re- tained immediacy such as we have described would, for a personal and con- 303</page><page sequence="17">The Journal of Religion scious occasion, result in a self-knowledge never possible in the limitations of finite existence: the individual would know as he/she was known. This would mean that, as successive occasions affected by one's actions were added to the nature of God, one would feel one's completion through others, be it for good or ill. For the knowledge of oneself in God would include the living feeling of one's effects, if indeed the divine mode of immediacy flows from satisfaction to integration in God. In such a vision, judgment and justice are not imposed externally but flow internally from the realities of one's being and one's effects. Again, such justice flows from the unity of all occasions in the love which is God; it is the mutuality of immediacy which makes such justice possible. There is a further aspect to this judgment, this self-knowledge, which goes beyond the actuality of one's effects. For in God the occasion would be woven into God's primordial vision-but this divine vision is precisely the source of every finite occasion's ideal possibilities. In God, then, the occasion's self- knowledge would include a knowledge of what he/she might have been. Self-knowledge in God would be a function of both possibility and actuality; the fullness of such self-knowledge is both judgment and justice-and re- demption as well. For in God, judgment would also be peace. The sense in which judgment simultaneously is peace follows from the very mutuality of immediacy which allows justice. For the inexorable corollary to the occasion's relation to the whole is not only the final availability of a clear judgment of one's own worth but also the companion fact of one's own inte- gral relation to a whole which surpasses the bonds of personality. Thus, whether one's judgment concerning oneself is for good or ill, one is no longer "locked in" to that self so judged. In the temporal world such self-knowledge could conceivably result in a hell of despair in the boundless egotism of self-condemnation. But in God the very knowledge of oneself is mediated through the knowledge of the other. Whitehead's words concerning the occa- sion in God, "the sense of worth beyond itself is immediately enjoyed as an overpowering element in the individual self-attainment" (PR, p. 531), indi- cate not only a sense of one's own worth but also a sense of the worth of others. A mutuality of immediacy in God means that egotism is transcended; the joy of the whole stemming from the worth of the whole is the focus of existence. The very unity of God's being, the oneness which is the ground of the unified multiplicity, the love which is the ultimate mutuality of relatedness which is God's own subjectivity-the "being made God"-mean that the value of the whole reverberates to the retained subjectivity of each part; no occasion, however adverse its sense of its own worth may be, is excluded from the harmony which is the whole. For the whole has come into being just as much through this attainment as through the attainment of others; the whole is no abstract thing but the togetherness of all occasions in the unity of a 304</page><page sequence="18">The Question of Immortality harmony which is ever intensifying through its everexpanding nature. Just as the one contributes to the many, even so the many contribute to the one; the harmony belongs finally to every participant in the infinite and all encom- passing subjectivity which is God. The judgment which flows from the occasion's relation to the whole is finally, then, a knowledge of one's partici- pation and belongingness to the completed whole; judgment is also peace. This togetherness of judgment and peace is redemption, not only from the moral evil which has been central in the above discussion, but also from the evil of deprivation and suffering as well. For the sense in which every occa- sion transcends the boundaries of personality indicates a given openness to the richness of others. The prison of an impoverished spirit cannot obtain in God-such conditions are only possible in the finite world, where openness to others is precluded by mental or physical pain. In God there is healing in the transcendence of personality which constitutes the retention of mutual imme- diacy. The richness of the whole belongs to every part, everlastingly supple- menting the initial impoverishment with the harmony and love which is God. Since God governs the dynamic flow of experience with his own will to- ward love, is the freedom known in finitude completely lacking to occasions in God? Yes and no: the immediacy of finitude, reenacted in God, exhibits the free formation of value on the part of the occasion. Finite freedom created the finite satisfaction. Divine freedom integrates that satisfaction into a har- mony with all others. Finite freedom then flows into divine freedom, partici- pating in the subjective aim of God. But since the occasion does participate in the subjectivity of God, the divine unity precludes any deviation from God's subjective will toward harmony. Such deviation is possible only in the free- dom which is separation from God, but that freedom belongs only to the world in temporality, not to the world in God. The process vision of immortality developed here is one in which God takes the world unto himself, transforming the world as he governs its participation in his own nature. This is the apotheosis of the world; it is Ignatius's "attain- ing to God" and Irenaeus's "promotion into God": death is overcome, and destiny is fulfilled. The justice which Tertullian so jealously guarded is also served, albeit now in a conceptuality which combines judgment with redemp- tion for all. With regard to the biblical texts, the process vision answers the need of a continuity between present hope and future fulfillment, both tem- porally and eschatologically: redemption and fulfillment is the destined reali- ty of the individual in God; this divine overcoming of evil affects the ongoing possibilities given to the world in its continuous creation of its history. While the hope is eschatological, it thus points toward encouragement in temporal efforts to actualize on earth the redemption made possible in "heaven." For indeed, redemption on earth enriches the continuing redemption in heaven. The divine harmony is not the "best of all possible worlds"-it is the very best possible, given this world. 305</page><page sequence="19">The Journal of Religion The vision is one of Christian hope, given the substance allowed it through philosophical analysis and speculation-but it is an image, a hope. Like the vision of the biblical writers, the church fathers, and the church throughout the centuries, the process vision stems from reason formed through a particu- lar perspective, a particular tradition, a particular faith. God is revealed in Christian experience to be wholly good and to be the overcomer of evil. By faith we assert that this God is ultimately victorious over all evil. Through the carefully developed notion of subjective immortality we are enabled to give conceptual coherence to this faith and to visualize the Christian hope in cosmic dimensions. With Irenaeus, we affirm thereby that "God is not con- quered"; he is, indeed, the overcomer of evil. 306</page></plain_text>
