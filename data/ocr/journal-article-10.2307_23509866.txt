<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Giküyü Religion and Philosophy A Tool for Understanding the Current Religio-Political Debates in Kenya Matthew Muriuki Karangi Introduction The study and reconstruction of local religions be fore and after the time of colonialism in Africa has been a complex and arduous task. There are a num ber of crucial questions that have set the discussion on, and about religion: What exactly is "religion"? What is its nature? What are specific characteristics of African religions? (Blakely et al. 1994; Horton 1993). One important point is that in defining "reli gion" we are frequently constructing this category by drawing primarily on European languages and cultures. As a cognitive category, therefore, "reli gion" is fluid and contextual, and any attempt to de fine it too narrowly may lead to what Fiona Bowie (2004) terms "a positivist stamp to what is an inter pretive process" (see also Ellis and Ter Haar 2004). Anthropos 108.2013</page><page sequence="2">Berichte und Kommentare 613 This article instead sees "religion" not only as a sys tem of beliefs in spiritual beings but also as "some thing" that is incorporated into various dimensions of life, e.g., into ritual, social, political, and econom ic behaviour. Consequently, the "Gîkûyù religion" is understood here as a phenomenon contextual ised within various social, economic, and politi cal dimensions that are crucial for human experi ence, both on individual or/and communal levels. In other words, a study of an indigenous "religion" conceptualised as a set of beliefs or a structured creed would be misled; what is important in this case is the broadly understood "religious" experi ence. Thus, Gîkùyû words that could be translat ed as "religion" are wïtïkia or kîrïra. Here wïtïkia means "to consent" or "be willing," while kîrïra re fers to the ethnic teachings or customs given by the elders of the community. Such concepts do not co incide, therefore, with the Western understanding of "religion" as a system of "beliefs." Moreover, in this article, we also emphasise the fact that human inter action and ritual participation, rather than knowl edge of beliefs and proper ritual behaviour, are es sential components of any indigenous cosmology, including that of the Gîkùyû. The religious system understood in these terms has also a functional di mension - namely, it serves the purpose of explain ing, predicting, and controlling everyday events. To put it differently, their "religious" thought is primar ily based on the existing social and political models, and as a result, Ngai (the highest deity of the Gîkù yû) and ancestors, though not visible, had a lot of impact in people's daily lives. The relationship between religion and other as pects of life is also important for understanding the current political debates on land and land owner ship in Kenya. As such, they may also constitute a firm foundation for a dialogue between different re ligions, especially Christianity and local religions. Gîkùyû people believe that Ngai arîmaga na ihiü nduhu ("Ngai plants with blunt knives"), and hence he is fair to every member of the society. Ngai uses land to manifest himself and, as a consequence, land becomes sacrosanct; land and trees become a stage on which "religious" interaction, participation, and experience can take place. The Gîkûyù Conception of Ngai The Gîkûyù conception of Ngai can be understood by examining the names given to that deity. Here one can use the translation of the Bible into the Gî kûyù language, made between 1909 and the 1950s under the auspices of the United Kikuyu Language Committee (TJKLC). The task of the committee was to reduce the Glküyü language to a standard written form, and to use it subsequently for Bible transla tions. Not surprisingly, the committee experienced certain problems in the process of setting up a "re ligious" vocabulary. Some members of the commit tee were concerned that certain Glküyü words could evoke non-Christian ideas, and they suggested that Hebrew vocabulary be adopted instead, e.g., "an gel" (the Semitic word is malak) which was trans lated to müraika. The Glküyü equivalent of "angel" is mürekio, however, which means "the one who has been sent" - either by the Glküyü deity or by a hu man being (Karanja 1999: chap. 5). The names more frequently used in the Glküyü language to signify "god" are the following: Ngai, Mwene nyaga, Mwene thï, Kïthuku, Kïrînyaga, Mümbi, Mürungu, Mügai, Mwene hinya, and Maa gü ngürü. The word mürungu, for instance, has a personal prefix (mû), which denotes humanity in Bantu languages. Indeed, the Swahili word for the deity is Mungu with a similar prefix (mu), which points to Bantu origin. Similarly, mürungu or mu lungu in some Bantu communities means "ancestral spirit" (Hastings 1996: 333). It does not, however, convey the idea of power and omnipotence as Kibi cho (1978: 372) and Leakey (1977/III: 1075) sug gest. The name most commonly used by the Glküyü to refer to their deity is Ngai. The word comes from the Maasai enk-ai, which was assimilated into the Glküyü religio-philosophical worldview as "ngai." In the Maasai language, the word denotes "rain," "deity," and "sky" (Leakey 1977/III: 1075). Thus, Enk-ai na-rôk means in Maasai the "deity who is black" and Enk-ai na-nyokié is the "deity who is red" (Mol 1996). In addition to the name En-kai, the Glküyü also borrowed certain Maasai concepts re ferring to divine attributes, especially those connect ed with the sun, the sky, and the dual personality.1 Although the Glküyü are believed to be mono theistic, there is compelling evidence suggesting for their original dual conception of the divine be ing. This is striking, especially when we explore the word Ngai from the point of view of its Maasai or igin. According to their tradition, the Maasai have a dual understanding of deity - namely, the above mentioned Enk-ai na-rok, and Enk-ai na-nyokié. Before the coming of Christianity, the Glküyü also believed that there were two personalised divine be ings (Gathîgïra 1952: 29). One of them (who be longed to the Glküyü) people) was good, and the other, who belonged to the Maasai, was bad. It was 1 Macpherson (1970: 10); Muriuki (1974: 98); Hobley (1922); Thomson (1885); Beecher (1944).

It is the title most frequently used Anthropos 108.2013</page><page sequence="4">Berichte und Kommentare 615 in prayers today. Again, the missionaries might have introduced this name since Ngai as baba was not traditionally used in the Giküyü religious vocabu lary. Instead, he was referred to as "moulder," and hence again as a woman. Other titles used in prayers directed to Ngai were already mentioned Gïthuri ("great elder"), Kiri-nyaga, Mwene-Nyaga as well as Mürungu, and Kïthuku.2 All those titles point to the fact that - as Hob ley observed - Gîkùyû language related to the sa cred is quite "down to earth" and concrete, in par ticular because of its ritual connotations: "We pray to you Ngai, we sacrifice a goat" (1922: 43, 45,47, 49). Ngai is particularly close to people during sac rifices, when he comes from the mountain, using the "ladder" of the sacred Mügumo tree, in order to eat the sacrificial meat. The Giküyü believe that during ritual sacrifices Ngai is actually present at the spot - that is near the sacred Mügumo tree. He watches them to prepare the fire and the sacrificial lamb. He observes them as they implore him through their prayers and enjoys the smell of the roasted meat of sacrifice. They also believe in a give-and-take rela tionship (kanya gatune nimwamükanlro) with their god. Later, he consumes the sacrificial meat and re turns to where he came from. Being so close to peo ple, Ngai can be spoken to while at the same time he could communicate with them and respond to their supplications. That is why the Giküyü approach him in times of need, without fear of disturbing him or incurring his wrath. Ngai is also merciful and does not send punishment and tribulation upon his people unless he is very angered. Furthermore, he would stop any punishment, if proper sacrifices are made beneath the sacred Mügumo tree. Ngai loves and dislikes people in accordance with their behaviour or, in other words, "Ngai arehaga kîguni na gïtei" ("Ngai punishes and blesses"). The Manifestations of Ngai The Giküyü believed therefore that Ngai reveals himself through nature, in the first place through mountains and through the Mügumo tree. Nonethe less, the power of Ngai could also manifest itself in such phenomena of nature as the lightning, the sun, the moon, rain, stars, rainbow, and thunder. The thunder and lightning in traditional Giküyü cosmol ogy are taken as manifestations of the presence of Ngai, as he moves from one place to another and thus cracking his joints on his journey. The Mountain God The Gïkûyû believe that Ngai lives primarily on four mountains: Mount Kenya, Kinangop Mountain in the Aberdares, Kianjahi in the east, Kiambirüirü in the south, and Mount Longonot in the Maasai territory (Karangi 2005). Mount Kenya (Kïrïnyaga) is the most important geological feature in Kenya. With its 5,199 m above sea level, it is the second highest mountain in Africa. Additionally, people were always confronted with the glistening snow on top of Kïrïnyaga ("white spotted mountain, white as the ostrich's feather and shiny as the sun") (Gathïgïra 1952: 30; Karangi 2005: 88). This might have prompted them to pose some fundamental questions about the creator and the power behind the creation. Who else, besides Ngai, would live and survive in such magnificent but cold place? When the Glküyü conceive of Ngai as the bright one or the "dazzling one," they associate him therefore with Mount Kenya.3 They say, for instance: Ngai aikaraga kïrïma-inï gïa Kïrï-Nyaga ("Ngai fives in the mountain of Kïrïnyaga"). Still, the Gîkûyù also believe that Ngai can reside in a large number of dif ferent places at the same time. People are not only fascinated by the height and the volume of that mas sive but also - because of its influence on the local ecology and land use. Indeed, Mount Kenya is the source of many rivers and streams that feed most of the Gîkûyù country. As such, it was also believed to be a source of rain, and - by extension - of the for est that the Gîkûyù needed for their survival. Although Ngai dwells on Mount Kenya, he nev ertheless makes endless journeys every day in or der to inspect the land, and in doing so, he stays on other mountains as well. For instance, Ngai is also associated with the mountain Kïrïma kïa-njahï (Donyo Sabuk), as well as with the lablab bean (Dolichos lablab) which symbolized that moun tain because that plant is believed to have grown in abundance on the lower slopes of that particular mountain. They were seen as crops of Ngai. People would refer to that plant as njahî cia Ngai (Ngai's lablab). Apart from Donyo Sabuk, Ngai was also be lieved to be present on the Aberdare Range (Kïrïma kïa, Nyandarüa), situated west of Mount Kenya. The prefix nya is part of all feminine names in the Gîkû yù language - designations for certain insects, vege tables, and several common objects. Thus, the noun ndarüa denotes "hide of a cow" or ox, which was used traditionally used by the Gïkûyû as a sleeping mat. Literally, the word "Nyandarüa" means "heap 2 Leakey (1977/III: 1076); Kihara (1985); Kenyatta (1995: 81, 215, 246, 253, 258, 274f.); Cagnolo (1933: 18, 26f., 196f.). 3 Kenyatta (1995: 234); Leakey (1977/III); Middleton and Ker shaw (1972: 61); Cavicchi (1977: 12).

Another name of that mountain is Kïrîma kïa thimbara, where the verb thimba means "to look dull," "gloomy," "cloudy," or "misty," which perhaps explains why, being a dwell ing of Ngai, the mountain was also associated with rain. Similarly, the black mountains called Ngong Hills (Kïrîma kia-Mbirûirû) were the fourth tempo rary abode of Ngai. Ngai as the Lord of Rain The beliefs that Ngai dwells in these mountains is spread across the Gîkûyû territory and it is also evi denced by certain Gîkûyù prayers.4 In these prayers, the Gîkûyù acknowledge that Ngai is in affiliation with Mount Kenya by the fact that he lives there, although he is still close to his people. They see his abode, feel his action in the thunder and lightning, and experience his presence when he accepts and eats the meat and food offered to him under the sa cred Mûgumo tree. Still, Ngai is more powerful than any natural phenomena since he is the source of rain and makes rivers flow. This is emphasised during the planting ceremony, when people are anxiously hoping for an abundant rainfall and a plentiful har vest, and the elders responsible for imploring rain beseech Ngai on people's behalf. For a horticultural community, such as the Gîkûyû, rain has always had a more ontological value. During the prayer for rain, the Gîkûyû made clear that Ngai and mbura came from the same source. They would say: Ngai tondu, mbura yumaga o käu wikaraga n, tüigulre tha na ütühe yo ("Ngai, since rain comes from where you live, be merciful to us and give us rain"). Accord ingly, abundant rainfall meant that Ngai was pleased with his people and blessed them. Ngai and the Rainbow Yet another hierophany of Ngai is the rainbow. All indigenous religions of the world provide mytho logical explanations of that phenomenon. For the Gîkûyû people, rainbow is a visible manifestation of Ngai. According to pre-Christian Gîkûyû beliefs, the rainbow ended in a great pool somewhere in the world or in the waterfall where the ndamathia (sea/ river monster) lived. Finally, Ngai reveals his pres ence and acts also through thunder and lightning. The Gîkûyû believe that Ngai comes down occa sionally from Mount Kenya, either on an inspec tion tour or to take his present offered to him under the sacred Mügumo tree. On such occasions a route is prepared by his two envoys, thunder and light ning. There is a common belief that when it thun ders, Ngai is stretching himself before moving from one place to another. If one is struck by the light ning, people believe that the person had crossed the path of Ngai provoking him to retaliate. Ngai and the Seers In the traditional Giküyü cosmology and ritual, the arathi (seers/diviners) and the ago (medicine men) had a significant religious and political influence. However, with the introduction of Christianity, their number has diminished considerably. The two groups of religious specialists were believed to be mediators between Ngai and his people. MQgo wa Kïbiro, a famous seer, was taken by Ngai through the kathürümündü/gacumbm (peak) of his house and spent long hours talking with Ngai. He was then sent back in order to transmit the divine message to people. Mügo wa Kïbiro is remembered by the Gïkûyû as having foretold the coming of Europe ans and the construction of the Kenya-Uganda rail way. There were other seers around the country who had similar experiences. It was through these char ismatic personalities that Ngai communicated and warned his people. Even with the proliferation of Christianity, many people still believe that seers and medicine men continue to influence lives of many, and that some Christians and Muslims visit them secretly as well. The notion of Ngai and his hierophanies was not an abstract discourse but rather something that was pragmatically experienced by the Giküyü in their daily fives. Ngai was therefore thought of as a con crete, anthropomorphic being who communicated with people and cared for what was happening to them. As a result, the existence of Ngai was never questioned because it was experienced. They also claimed that they could know his "thinking," in the sense that when Ngai was angry or satisfied with people, he demonstrated it in multiple ways. The continuous interaction between Ngai, the Giküyü and the ancestors did not happen in the vacuum but in the land, in the first place on the mountains. That is why the ancestral land had a very strong religious value to the Gïkûyû, as it has to other indigenous peoples of the world. 4 Leakey (1977); Cagnolo (1933); Routledge (1968); Middle ton and Kershaw (1972); Kabetù (1947); Gathïgîra (1952); Wanjohi (1997). Anthropos 108.2013</page><page sequence="6">Berichte und Kommentare 617 The Land: Its Meaning and Religious Value Land as a Mother In chapter two of his book "Facing Mount Kenya" (1938/1995), Kenyatta presents and explains the concept of land tenure among the Giküyü and the link between land and their mythic-ritual system. In the preface, Kenyatta observes that land is "the key to the people's life; it secures for them that peace ful tillage of the soil which supplies their material needs and enables them to perform their magic and traditional ceremonies in undisturbed serenity, fac ing Mount Kenya. ... Anyone who wants to under stand Gikuyu problems must have a correct grasp of the questions relating to land tenure" (1938/1995: xxi). In the first place, the ancestral land has been traditionally conceptualized by the Giküyü as a fe male, motherly figure. Kenyatta (1938/1995: 21) has written in this regard: The Giküyü consider the earth as the "mother" of the tribe, for the reason that the mother bears her burden for about eight or nine moons while the child is in her womb, and then for a short period of suckling. But it is the soil that feeds the child through lifetime; and again after death it is the soil that nurses the spirits of the dead for eterni ty. Thus the earth is the most sacred thing above all that dwells in or on it. It supplies them with the material needs of life, through which spiritual and mental contentment is achieved (see also Droz 1999; Thomas 2003). Kenyatta points to the powerful images of "mother" and "womb" to demonstrate that there has always existed an ontological connection be tween people and their land in Giküyü culture. As the womb has a latent potentiality to give life, so has the land. In the myth of origin, for instance, land was a free gift from Ngai given to the ancestor of the Giküyü people. As the Giküyü can trace their origin from this male ancestor, so can they equally understand their cultural genesis and position in his tory, and how this historical configuration legitimis es their claim to their land (comp. Anderson 2005; Elkins 2005). The Giküyü, having been a conglom erate of various migrating groups, had forged them selves over several centuries into what they and oth ers now recognize as a separate ethnic unit. Their sweat, while toiling on the land and clearing the virgin forests, had produced a culture from nature. Working on one's land gave an identity and self respect. In their relationship with the land, the peo ple were searching for the religio-political meaning and identity, so much so that what emerged from this relationship was a theory of labour and value, both material and moral (Njûrùri 1969: no. 386; Dundas 1955: 297). In short, the ancestral land is also Gîkûyû's mother because it produces everything that sustains them (Karangi 2005; Mworia 1994: 101). In conse quence, the Gîkûyû believe that to take someone's land is like depriving a newborn baby of mother's milk, and as such it is tantamount to denying what is essential for survival. Even after one's death, the soil continues feeding the ngoma (ancestors) for eternity. For that reason, members of the clan would pour libations and propitiate the ancestors to ensure a smooth running of their families and strengthen their communal bond. In this way, the land consti tutes the bones and sinews of Gîkûyû religious, so cial, economic, and political structures. It is also important to emphasise that the com plex relationship that existed between the Gîkûyû, land, and family was meant to increase the wealth and fame of the mbarî (clan). Wealth was measured in the form of livestock, land, and population. It was also a sign of blessing from Ngai. The products of the land could be used to trade with the Maasai, the Kamba, and with Arab traders. Alliances with other mbarî were kept alive through festivals, beer drinking, and finally it could feed the labourers who toiled hard to prepare and clear the forest for planting (Clark 1980: 365 ff.; Berman and Lonsdale 1997). Land that bonded members of a mbarî to gether strongly defined, therefore, the character of their collective life. Furthermore, the Gîkûyû com munity considered their land as the foundation on which particular families were built.5 Land equally united Ngai and ancestors with the Gîkûyû and the neighbouring groups. As stated above, the Gîkûyû can see in their land the presence of Ngai, not as a detached deus otiosus but as the one who uses the soil to give life to people. As such, land was not only the main unifying factor in of the Gîkûyû life but also the focal point of their religious, economic, and political praxis. The Religious Significance of Land While the neighbouring Maasai pastoralists ensured their survival by maintaining sufficient stock and ac cess to grazing land and drinking water as well as by organising themselves into small, mobile herd ing units, the Gîkûyû relied to that purpose on the clan-owned, sacralised land that acted as the me dium through which they could communicate with Ngai around the sacred Mügumo tree, and other sa 5 Wa-Githumo (1981: 3); Wilson (1953: 68); Elkins (2005).

Indeed, the land which fed and sustained the Gïkû yü was sanctified by the ancestors beneath it, giving the present occupiers a strong link and claim to that soil. To emphasise that bond, the Gîkûyû bury the umbilical cord in the soil to welcome the living and unite them with their ancestors. Similarly, during a circumcision ceremony, the blood was allowed to ooze out slowly on ground so that the initiates were ontologically united and blessed by the ancestors. Finally, the ultimately binding oath among the Gî kûyû was to "swear by the earth." The colonial domination affected the religious bond of the Gîkûyû with their land. Berman wrote in this context: "The idea of land lay at the core of the colonial relationship: it was the emotional bed rock of dominance and subordination, of achieve ment and loss, of possessing a social identity, and therefore, either a fitness to exist or a reproach for living ... Land was also time: the past with its an cestral bones; the present as the resource with which people made their wealth and civic virtue in a com petitive world; and the future, sustaining the marital networks of reproduction and preserving the pos sibilities of productive labour for one's grand chil dren" (1990: 313-344). Conclusion In this article I proposed to present and analyse at tributes which the Gîkûyû give to Ngai, which - in turn - points to the way they conceive of that de ity. I focused on the fact that the Gîkûyû view their land as the platform on which the communion be tween Ngai and people (including ancestors) is ef fectuated. Some of the attributes used by the Gîkûyû to conceptualise Ngai are: great, powerful, creator/ moulder, owner, and giver. They clearly demonstrate the immense and significant role that this deity has played in their cosmology as well as the solid and active relationship maintained and nurtured by both parties, the Gîkûyû and Ngai. Specifically, Ngai, the creator, is imagined as the axis through which eve rything else revolves; an ontological pivot through which all other forms of relationships are based. The attributes of a strong, powerful creator and owner were reflected in the social organisation of the Gî kûyû, centred on elders who, using their experience and secret knowledge, control the clans in a "strong and powerful" way. The coming of Western Christi anity along with the colonial political and economic system, replaced the traditional power of elders with the Western forms of leadership, and consequently destabilised the social and religious-political struc ture of the Gîkûyû. Given the traditional religious relationship of the Gîkûyû to their land, and the po litical ramifications of that relationship, any study of land ownership among that people must necessar ily include the issues of religion and of the politi cal structure and practices. It is important because between 1900 and early 1930s neither missionar ies nor the colonial administration gave a due con sideration to this matter. Most ethnological studies dealing with the Gîkûyû "religion" and their social system are biased as well.6 Kenya gained its independence from Britain in 1963, but it inherited the British parliamentary system and a strong legacy of Western Christian ity. Nonetheless, the postcolonial political system, supported by three consecutive presidents - namely, Kenyatta, Moi, and Kibaki - did not adequately ad dress the problems faced by ethnic divisions, land ownership, and economic imbalance in Kenya. As a result, these divisions have haunted and will con tinue to haunt Kenyans until a satisfactory religio political and economical solution is found. There exist several theories as to what triggered the post election violence in Kenya between December 2007 and early 2008, which claimed over 1,000 lives and caused the displacement of over a hundred thousand people, most of whom were of Gîkûyû ethnic ori gin. Some people would argue that it was provoked by the presidential candidates themselves, the in cumbent Mwai Kibaki of the Party of the National Unity (PNU) and his rival Raila Odinga of the Or ange Democratic Movement (ODM), each refus ing to admit defeat. Others might reiterate that fol lowing the subsequent presidential campaigns all over Kenya, which had strong tribal overtones, the postelection violence was inevitable. Those violent events had two aspects. The first of them was the targeting of members of an ethnic group (specifi cally, the Gîkûyû) that had widely and openly sup ported Kibaki and PNU by rival members of other ethnic groups who gave their support to Raila and ODM (Branch and Cheeseman 2008: 3). The other aspect was the violence perpetrated by police and tribal militias against those who opposed the elec tion results. In the course of the 1990s, Moi had used a similar mechanism of political control, and consequently most members of the Gîkûyû group were driven away from the Rift Valley. Apart from losing their land, they also suffered many casual ties. About 1,800 people lost their lives and more than 350,000 were displaced during the tribal clash 6 Wa-Githumo (1981: 40-44); Meek (1945: 18); Karangi (2005). Anthropos 108.2013</page><page sequence="9">620 Berichte und Kommentare es (Branch and Cheeseman 2008). The politics of "othering" by tribal mark or majimbo (regionalism; Branch and Cheeseman 2008: 3) also tinted the questions of land and power, and marks Kenya's political life at present. Furthermore, over the last decades, Christiani ty became part of Kenya's cultural and social land scape, and as such it influences people's moral choices. Nonetheless, I argue that if the traditional Gîkùyù values are promoted across the country, they might also help clear negative consequences of the ethnic violence caused by religio-political and eco nomic divisions. Unfortunately, no such approach seems apparent, particularly in contemporary de bates on land ownership and unequal social and eco nomic distribution of resources in Kenya. Moreover, as the missionary endeavours to promote Christi anity in Kenya marginalised traditional religions (Eboussi Boulaga 2002; Magesa 1997), they also "suppressed" Africanness because African cultures were seen as "anti-Christian," and hence in need of cultural improvement. However, if African indige nous sacred ways are seen as anti-Christian, what is the place of those Kenyans who are Christians within their own communities? How can the 70 80% of Kenyan Christians address the postelection problems without using their religion as a mask for convenience? These factors have strongly contrib uted to their failure to be prophets within their own communities during the postelection violence, and leaders of different denominations failed to show any form of leadership during the postelection vio lence. By contrast, they supported their particular ethnic groups. One can even argue that during the postelection violence of 2007/2008 most Christians in Kenya showed how deeply tribal, and hence Af rican, they were. Their Western religious mask was thrown off and they treated each other like enemies simply because of their tribal affiliations. As a re sult, in March 2008 the National Council of Church es of Kenya (NCCK) apologised to the people for its failure to be a neighbour, and its failure to heed its prophetic dimension during the postelection skir mishes. They apologised for taking sides during the violence and failing to be the voice of the voiceless. Although this is a move in the right direction, nev ertheless, the churches need to address serious in consistencies within their organisational structures. It is also a fact that the mainstream churches are the biggest landowners in the country. As such, they have participated in the process of unequal distribu tion of land since the independence (Southall 2005). Some evangelical churches have been even accused of having benefitted from the irregular/illegal allo cation of public land during the Moi regime. One may ask, therefore, how can the churches in Kenya challenge the government on land graft, while re maining its beneficiary? Besides, even within the Giküyü group there are some individuals, especially the ex-Mau Mau, who felt betrayed by the process of the land redistribution in the 1960s by the first president Kenyatta. They continue to feel marginal ised even today (Branch and Cheeseman 2008: 7). This article does not suggest that religion alone has been responsible for ethnic clashes in Kenya. Nevertheless, most perpetrators of those heinous crimes were adherents to Christianity, although oth ers were members of Mûngïki, who identify them selves with Giküyü traditional beliefs and practices. As such, these events call for revisiting the role played by Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism in Ken yan society. They also call for a serious study of indigenous sacred ways - namely, their limitations as well as contributions that they can make to the nation-building and the healing process. Although current political dialogue continues, little progress is being made on how to address the questions of land tenure, political inequalities, and the socio-po litical role of traditional religions. In fact, the pro ject of the current government to resettle millions of landless Kenyans fails to address these quintessen tial issues. The traditional religion of the Giküyü - as discussed above - was able to address and con tain all spiritual, economic, and political problems because - like most African traditional religions - it was holistic in its approach.7 While Christianity and other major religions endeavour to address nu merous religio-political contradictions within their religion abroad and in Africa, they did fail to ad dress the political and humanitarian crisis in Kenya during the postelection violence. Some important questions must be therefore posed: How far do the current debates on land and ownership, social exclu sion, and resettlement of the victims of land grab bing include all ethnic groups in Kenya? What is the role of the traditional religions and mainstream religions in initiating practical debates on the land distribution and ownership in the country? Has the new constitution considered the traditional notion of land tenure while trying to address the question of land reform? For the displaced Giküyü people, whose ancestral bones still lie buried in their land, thus making it sacrosanct, the current discourses on land ownership might not provide any answer to the their problems, but rather produce more tensions in the future. 7 Magesa (1997); Eboussi Boulaga (2002); Mbiti (1990).
