LEWIS tjl@jhu.edu The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21218 Though recent years have seen a plethora of research on divine representation, little attention has been paid to one of the Hebrew Bibles most common depic- tions of the Almighty, that of divine fire. Of the many texts about divine fire in the Hebrew Bible, one of the oldest (Deut 33:2) is also one of the most difficult. This article supports two studies of Deut 33:2 by Richard C. Steiner (the most recent coauthored with Sid Z. Leiman) by addressing additional relevant texts and iconography. The resulting analysis unpacks how fire was used sym- bolically to represent preternatural forces that attended the divine. Methodolog- ically, the present study challenges future scholars to incorporate iconographie analysis into ones philology- even when trying to understand abstract ideas. Deuteronomy 33:2 is often referred to as "one of the most difficult cruces in the Bible."1 The poem in which this verse is found is often assigned to the corpus of archaic Hebrew poetry. The opening describes Yhwh coming from the south/ southeast with cosmic vocabulary and topographic allusions that resonate with other archaic biblical passages (Judg 5:4-5; Ps 68:8-9, 18 [Eng. 68:7-8, 17]; Hab 3:2-7). The antiquity of these motifs was underscored when they were found in the late-ninth- to early- eighth -century b.c.e. inscriptions from Kuntillet Ajrud.2 The 1 Gary Rendsburg, "Hebrew &gt;šdt and Ugaritic Hšdym JNSL 8 (1980): 81. 2 The relevant texts read as follows: Judges 5:4-5 O Yhwh, when you set out from Seir, yhwh bësë3tëkâ missëcîr When you marched from the steppe of Edom, bësacdëkâ miššěděh 3ëdôm The earth quaked, 3eres rãcãsâ Yea, the heavens rained, gam-sãmayim nãtãpú Yea, the clouds rained water, gam-cãbím nâtëpû mãyim The mountains shuddered, hãrím nâzëlû Before Yhwh, the one of Sinai, mippënê yhwh zeh sînay Before Yhwh, the God of Israel. mippënê yhwh Dëlôhê yisrã^èl 791</page><page sequence="2">792 Journal of Biblical Literature 132, no. 4 (2013) scribes at this site located in the northeast Sinai Desert (50 km south of Qadesh- Barnea) knew well of cosmic battles where "God dawned" ( bzrh *1), mountains melted ( ymsn hrm) and peaks grew weak ( wyrkn pbnm) on the day of war ( bym Psalm 68:8-9 , 18 [Eng. 68:7-8, 17] O Yhwh, when you set out yhwh bèsèHèkã lipnê cammekã at the head of your army When you marched in/from the wilderness, běsacděka bíšímon The earth quaked 3eres rãcãsâ Yea, the heavens rained 3 ap-sãmayim nãtèpu Before Yhwh, the one of Sinai, mippënê yhwh zeh sînay Before Yhwh, the God of Israel. mippënê yhwh Dèlõhê yisrtfël Yhwh s chariotry (numbers in) the myriads, rekeb yhwh ribbõtayim Thousands upon thousands; 3alpê šin^an Yhwh comes from Sinai . . . yhwh bã 3 missînay . . .

They also looked to "Yhwh of Teman/the South" ( yhwh tmn/yhwh htmn ) as a source of blessing and personal protection. I. The Anachronistic Problem of Děšdát Seen in this context, Deut 33:2 reverberates with antiquity apart from one glaring problem that is so anachronistic (and out of context) that it jars the reader s sensibilities (Deut 33:2-3a): Yhwh came from Sinai yhwh missínay bã D He dawned from Seir . . .3 zärah miššěcír . . . He beamed forth from Mount Paran. hôpîac mëhar pãDrãn With him were myriads of holy ones, Httô-mA ribèbõt qõdes At/From his right hand is the "fire of law" mîmînô Děšdát . . .5 Yea, the consecrated (?)6 troops. Dap hõbèb cammîm 3 Similar to the JPS translation, the two occurrences of lãmô in the MT of Deut 33:2 could be translated in context as: He shone upon them from Seir . . . zãrah miššécír lãmô The "fire of law" (flashing) at them from His right mîmînô 3èsdãt lãmô Yet even the JPS translators are at a loss, having to supply the verb "flashing" and footnoting the uncertainty of the phrase mîmînô 3ësdât for which they desperately suggest a place-name. The RSV's translation is no cleaner when it comes to the two occurrences of lãmô , omitting the second one entirely and emending the first to lãnú ("The Lord dawned from Seir upon ws"), a reading found in several of the versions and reconstructed by many commentators including the new CEB (Common English Bible) translation. Yet lãnú seems to be a secondary change trying to deal with a lectio difficilior lãmô. The emendation to lě-cammo ("upon his people/army") is a creative solution, yet too conjectural. Contextually, the problem of the two occurrences of lãmô could be solved redactionally. Once a later heading in Deut 33:1 was appended to the earlier poem, its mention of "the children of Israel" ( bënê yisrã^êl) would provide the necessary antecedent for the insertion of both occurrences of lãmô. One could then even argue that the resulting references to the children of Israel in Deut 33:1-3 served in a prefatory manner for the end of the poem, where Israel is again highlighted (33:28-29). [I thank an anonymous JBL referee for these insights.] As for reconstructing the original poem in Deut 33:2, it seems best to omit the two occurrences of lãmô , as we have done above. If there was a referent for an original lãmô, it is at this stage unrecoverable. Yet more likely (especially if one factors in prosodie considerations) lãmô seems to reflect a later understanding of Yhwh shining upon Israel. 4 Here we follow most scholars who read the preposition "with" plus enclitic -m ( Httô-m ) based on the LXX, the Targums, and the Vulgate rather than the MT s pointing °ãtâ ("he came"). The MT s vocalization seems secondary, the result of the influence of late Aramaic (cf. also wayyëtë J in 33:21). The occasion for the mispointing of the MT is surely its lack of knowledge of how -h in early (tenth century b.c.e.) orthography can represent a third masculine singular suffix, a feature well attested from our epigraphic sources. See Frank Moore Cross and David Noel Freedman, Studies in Ancient Yahwistic Poetry (SBLDS 21; Missoula, MT: Scholars Press, 1975), 72 n. 8. Yet if the MT stands, the meaning of the passage remains unchanged. 5 On what seems to be a secondary insertion of lãmô, see n. 3 above. 6 All scholars struggle with the difficulty of translating the hapax legomenon hõbèb. The best</page><page sequence="4">794 Journal of Biblical Literature 132, no. 4 (2013) Today, scholars universally note the anachronistic appearance of the word dät ("law"), an Iranian/Old Persian loanword into postexilic Hebrew (passim in the book of Esther).7 In the past, confessional and precriticai traditions felt comfortable situating the fiery nature of the Torah in early Israel. Yet modern historians have balked at such a retrojection that would be so blatantly out of place chronologically.8 II. Solutions for Interpreting Dèsdãt Patrick D. Miller writes of the enigmatic Děš dat that it is "entirely unintelligible."9 Frank Moore Cross and David Noel Freedman note that "conjectures are almost as numerous as scholars" - to which they then add their own ingenious conjectural reading.10 Scholars who try to salvage a reading from the consonants of the MT solution may be to leave the word untranslated or to understand it (as does Patrick D. Miller following Cross and George E. Mendenhall) as a reference to troops being consecrated for war. See Miller, "Two Critical Notes on Psalm 68 and Deuteronomy 33," HTR 57 (1964): 243. 7 As early as 1886, August Dillmann would note that the presence of the Persian word dãt in an archaic Hebrew poem was "schlechthin unannehmbar" (Die bûcher Numeri, Deuteronomium und Josua [Kurzgefasstes exegetisches Handbuch zum Alten Testament 13; Leipzig: Hirzel, 1886], 418). Samuel Rolles Driver would write in 1895 that "it is next to impossible that it [dût] can have been used in Heb[rew] at the time when this Blessing was written" (A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on Deuteronomy [ICC; Edinburgh: T&amp;T Clark, 1895], 393). 8 For bibliography on the history of precriticai scholarship on 3 ěšdat , see Richard C. Steiner, "dät and cên : Two Verbs Masquerading as Nouns in Moses Blessing (Deuteronomy 33:2, 28)," JBL 115 (1996): 693-94; and Mark Verman, "The Torah as Divine Fire," JBQ 35 (2007): 94-102. The earliest example of this approach can be seen in Targum Onqelos. As Verman notes, "Midrashic literature is replete with discussions of Deuteronomy 33:2" often referring to the primordial and heavenly origin of the Torah. Verman quotes Sifre Devarim 343, which reads in part, "Just as fire exists perpetually, so too are the words of the Torah eternal." In addition, Verman notes, "the activity of studying the Torah is intense and incendiary. This can be readily observed by walking into a beit midrash in which study partners are engaged in fierce debate." Of particular note are the teachings of Resh Shimon b. Lakish, who understood God to have given the Torah to Moses "from white fire inscribed by black fire. It was fire, mixed with fire, hewn from fire and given by fire, as it is written, 'From His right hand a fiery law to them' (Deut 33:2 )- Talmud Yerushalmi , Shekalim 6:1, f. 25b." See Verman, "Torah as Divine Fire," 95-97. With regard to understanding the original meaning of &gt;èsdãt in its Iron Age context, Steiner notes that "by the nineteenth century, such [pre-critical/confessional] interpretations had fallen on hard times," that is, outside of confessional contexts (Steiner, " dãt and cên," 694). In confessional settings such understandings were woven into halakah such that one is required to save a Torah scroll endangered by fire even if such an action would violate the prohibition of work on the Sabbath (m. Šabb. 16:1). Again, see Verman ("Torah as Divine Fire," 98), to whom I am indebted for this material. 9 Miller, "Two Critical Notes," 241.

Tigay s "blazing fire" (&gt;ës d[õleqe]t).n A breakthrough came with Richard C. Steiner, who keeps the consonantal text as is but reads dãt as a contraction of an archaic verbal form - thus produc- ing the translation of mîmînô Dës dãt as "from his right, fire flew."12 In a follow-up article, Steiner (together with Sid Z. Leiman) makes a strong case for how the Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Epic: Essays in the History of the Religion of Israel (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1973), 101.

Steiners interpretation (understanding dãt as a third person feminine singular perfect from the root d3y ["to fly"] agreeing with the feminine subject 3ěš) is well reasoned. From the perspective of historical Hebrew (and comparative Semitic) it is flawless. Historically, the third person feminine singular perfect form is *qatalat. The historic use of -t to mark the third person feminine singular (as opposed to the later use of -h) is well attested in Biblical Hebrew verbs (e.g., ^ãzèlat, iãbat, gãlãt, gillãt , cãsat, hoglãt). See GKC §44f, §75m; Joshua Blau, Phonology and Morphology of Biblical Hebrew: An Introduction (Linguistic Studies in Ancient West Semitic 2; Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2010) §§1.3.5; 4.3.3.4.6-8; 4.3.8.6.4.1-2; Robyn C. Vern, Dating Archaic Biblical Poetry : A Critique of the Linguistic Arguments (Perspectives on Hebrew Scriptures and Its Contexts 10; Piscataway, NJ: Górgias, 201 1) 219-28. The original third person feminine singular -at ending regularly appears before pronominal suffixes (e.g., qètãlat- [GKC §59g]). Epigraphic Hebrew also represents the third person feminine singular *qatalat form (and with a third weak verb as in Deut 33:2 s d3y) in line 3 of the late- eighth -century b.c.e.

Randall Garr, Dialect Geography of Syria-Palestine, 1000- 586 B.C.E. (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1985), 61. Note how the earlier (historic) form of this root is represented in the Ketiv of 2 Kgs 9:37 (hyt) while the later (doubly marked feminine) form is represented in the Qere of 2 Kgs 9:37 (hãyètãh). Cf. cãsat in Lev 25:21</page><page sequence="6">796 Journal of Biblical Literature 132, no. 4 (2013) original meaning of^ěš dãt ("fire flew") was lost due to much later midrashic layers of interpretation that emphasized the meaning of its homonym dãt ("law") of Iranian/Persian origin.13 Steiner and Leiman argue that remarkably "traces of the original interpretation can still be detected in the Palestinian Targum (to Exod 20:2), especially when it is read in conjunction with the Sipre (to Deut 33:2)."14 The purpose of the present article is to underscore how Steiner s (and Leimans) insight into Deut 33:2 is indeed on the right track even though it has not found wide acceptance. Compare, for example, the new CEB translations rendering of Deut 33:2 ("his warriors were next to him, ready"), which exhibits little resemblance to the Hebrew text deemed by the translators to be "uncertain." Moreover, as will be shown below, Steiner s understanding is fully congruent with what we know from ancient Israelite religion (in text and iconography) about how divinity could be represented. As for the verbal root dDy ("to fly"), Steiner nicely notes that the same verb occurs "only a few chapters earlier" in Deut 28:49. In a footnote, Steiner mentions in passing that the same verb occurs in Ps 18:11 [Eng. 18:10]. 15 It is here that we now turn, for this material is, in our opinion, a strong support for his argument. Divine Fire The numinous quality of fire is one of the most (the most?) enduring of images used by the authors of the Hebrew Bible to depict divine presence. It appears in every literary (i.e., pentateuchal) strand, in most literary genres, and throughout every period. One need only mention Yhwhs self-revelation found in the burning-bush episode in Exod 3:1-6 (the locus classicus for divine fire) or the fre- quent "pillar of fire" ( cammûd 3ès) motif. The latter, a symbol of Yhwhs presence during the exodus wanderings, is articulated in both J (Exod 13:21-22; 14:24; Num 14:14) and P (Num 9:15-16) literary strands, not to mention its use in Deut 1:33, Ps 78:14 ("with fiery light," běDor Děš)y and as late as Nehemiah (9:12, 19). and Hans Bauer and Pontus Leander, Historische Grammatik der hebräischen Sprache des Alten Testamentes (Halle: Max Niemeyer, 1922), §57u. The quality and orthographic representation of 3aleph in Hebrew can at times be so weak and unstable that GKC refers to its "feebleness." Its quiescence (i.e., loss of consonantal sound) is paradigmatic (e.g., the regular loss of Daleph at the end of a syllable in both the perfect and imperfect of III-5 verbs [GKC §74; Blau, Phonology and Morphology, §3.3.4] and the regular loss of ^aleph in the first person prefixai I-5 verbs [GKC §68g; Blau, Phonology and Morphology ; §3.3.4.2.1]). There are numerous attestations of 'aleph being dropped entirely (yãsãtí for yâsâ'tî; mâlëtî for molèsti; mãsãtí for mãsãHt; tômïm for të^ômïm; sëlâtèk for šě^ělátěk; gëwâh for gë^ëwâh; rëmîm for rë^ëmîm; sèrît for šě^ěrít; hêmãh for hem^ãh, etc.; see GKC §23a-f). In short, the loss of 3aleph in dãt from *dãyãt in Deut 33:2 presents no problems. 13 Steiner and Leiman, "Lost Meaning of Deuteronomy 33:2, 1 57-66. 14 Ibid., 159. 15 Steiner, " dãt and cên 696 n. 20.</page><page sequence="7">Lewis: Divine Fire in Deuteronomy 33:2 797 The use of fire to represent Yhwh appears in other memorable J (non-P) pas- sages as well. Fire depicts the divine presence as a "flaming torch" ( lappíd Děš) mov- ing between the cut animals in the Abrahamic covenant ceremony in Gen 15:17. Yhwh descends on Mount Sinai in fire and smoke "like the smoke from a kiln" ( yãrad ...yhwh bã^ès ... cãsãnô kěcešen hakkibsãn) in J s theophany in Exod 19:18. The famous trial by ordeal on Mount Carmel between Yhwh and Baal (and their respective prophets, with Elijah taking center stage) in 1 Kings 18 climaxes with a fiery theophany. The Priestly tradition uses distinctly different vocabulary, yet its description of the divine theophany (i.e., the appearance of the radiance of Yhwh, marDëh kěbodyhwh) also emphasizes how its nature was like "devouring fire" ( kěDěš Dõkelet) on the top of the mountain (Exod 24:17). So too the Deuteronomic tradi- tions describe the mountain of divine revelation as "ablaze with fire" ( bõcér báDěš, Deut 4:11; 9:15). Fire (together with associated storm images) is the norm for depicting the active presence of Yhwh. In the storm-god theophany found in Psalm 18 (// 2 Samuel 22), Yhwh again descends (cf. Exod 19:18) but this time by "bowing the heavens" (Ps 18:10 [Eng. 18:9]; cf. Ps 144:5). With "fiery transcendent anthropomorphisms" via "poetry of high antiquity"16 we read: The earth heaved and quaked, wattigcaš wattircas hã^ãres foundations of mountains shook; ûmôsëdê hãrím yirgãzú they reeled, because his (anger) burned. wayyitgãcãsú kí-hãrâ lô Smoke rose from (Yhwh s) nostrils, cãlâ cãsãn bě^appo fire from his mouth devouring; wěJěš-mippíw tôDkël coals blazed forth from him . . . gehãlím bãcãrú mimmennû . . .

Divine Fire and Deuteronomy 33:2 Let us return to Steiner s (and now Leimans) breakthrough on * ësdât in Deut 33:2. When set against the ubiquitous imagery of divine fire documented above, and the general preference to start with the MT unless it is hopelessly corrupt, it makes good sense to follow Steiners lead in retaining the MT s Děš as "fire."17 As for his handling of dãt as a verb depicting this fire as flying, note in particular how the psalmists picture of Yhwh coming with fire also involves him flying- and with the same verb (dDy, "to fly") being used in Ps 18:11 [Eng. 18:10] (yèdeD) that Steiner posits for Deut 33:2 (dãt &lt;*dãDãt)' With the parallel verb wayyãcõp (not to mention Yhwh mounting a winged cherub), there is no doubt that verb yëde° in Ps 18:11 [Eng. 18:10] has to do with flying- and a divine flying that is surrounded by fiery images. With such solid support, I translate Deut 33:2: Yhwh came from Sinai He dawned from Seir . . . He beamed forth from Mount Paran. With him18 were myriads of holy ones, From his right han ¿fireflies forth (*ěš dãt), Yea, the consecrated (?)19 of the troops. This is not the only place where we read of fire accompanying Yhwh. Indeed, in several passages, fire is an attendant being that makes up part of the divine retinue. Thus we read in Ps 97:1-5: Yhwh is king! Let the earth exult! Let the many isles rejoice! 17 This is in contrast to the many conjectural proposals that repoint the MT to read differently.

Fire goes before him [Dès lèpãnãyw tëlëk] burning his foes on every side [tëlahët sãbíb sãrãyw]. His lightnings lighten the world; the earth sees and trembles. The mountains melt like wax before Yhwh s presence, at the presence of the Lord of all the earth. Similarly, according to Isa 29:6, when "Yhwh of Armies" brings his divine visitation ( mëcim yhwh sèbãDôt tippãqêd) suddenly, in an instant, he does so with thunder, earthquake, and loud roar ( běracam úběracaš wěqol gãdôl) with tumult, tempest, and a blaze of consuming fire ( sûpâ ûsècârâ wělahab Děš Dôkëlâ). Such passages could be replicated elsewhere, for many other poets picked up on the motif of how "con- suming fire preceded Yhwh" ( Dès-lépãnãyw tõDkél; Ps 50:3). 20 With the specific vocabulary of "fire going before Yhwh," one wonders if fire was ever thought to be a member of Yhwh s divine entourage similar to Deber and Reshep mentioned in Hab 3:5.

The Iconography of Divine Fire Ever since Othmar Keels groundbreaking work The Symbolism of the Biblical World : Ancient Near Eastern Iconography and the Book of Psalms (first published in 1972 and now in its fifth German edition), historians of Israelite religion have 20 There are several related themes that are beyond the scope of the present treatment and which I develop elsewhere in Theodore J. Lewis, Ancient Israelite Religion (forthcoming, Yale University Press). These include (a) Deuteronomic/Deuteronomistic views of divine fire; (b) the relationship of the maPãk Yhwh to divine fire; (c) the relationship of the various kãbôd traditions (e.g., P, Ezekiel) to divine fire; (d) divine fire and its relation to the aniconic traditions; and (e) the question of whether divine fire was ever used hypostatically similar to divine anger (cf.

A depiction of the Mesopotamian storm god Aššur with radiant melammu and fire from the time of the ninth-century b.c.e. king Tukulti-Ninurta II. Image taken from Walter Andrae, Coloured Ceramics from Ashur and Earlier Ancient Assyrian Wall-Paintings (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner, 1925), pl. 8. of the ninth-century b.c.e. king Tukulti-Ninurta II.24 The winged god in fig. 1 is anthropomorphic from the waist up with taut bow in hand. Most importantly, he is encircled with flames of fire together with wavy lines depicting a radiance of some kind. It is little wonder that scholars have described this as perhaps our best exam- ple of the Mesopotamian concept of melammu (a radiant, supernatural force) being depicted in art.25 24 Though I am not arguing for any type of direct dependence of such symbol sets, historically the ninth-century b.c.e. dating of this image would work well with the antiquity of Deuteronomy 33, which could date to around this time period. If Deuteronomy 33 dates earlier still, this too would be supported by the ubiquity of similar motifs throughout the ancient Near East. For detailed studies of such symbols and the various mechanisms of intercultural transmission, see Tallay Oman, "A Complex System of Religious Symbols: The Case of the Winged Disk in Near Eastern Imagery of the First Millennium BCE," in Crafts and Images in Contact: Studies on Eastern Mediterranean Art of the First Millennium BCE (ed.

LeMon, Yahwehs Winged Form in the Psalms : Exploring Congruent Iconography and Texts (OBO 242; Fribourg: Academic Press; Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 2010), 95-1 12. 25 The Mesopotamian concept of melammu as "radiance" and its relation to brightness and fire are well documented. See esp. Shawn Zelig Aster, The Unbeatable Light: Melammu and Its Biblical Parallels (AO AT 384; Münster: Ugarit, 2012). At the same time, melammu depicts divine power, an irresistible force that overwhelms any enemy. Thus, when an Assyrian king went to battle, he was assured of victory because he was thought to embody "the awe of the radiance [pulhu</page><page sequence="12">802 Journal of Biblical Literature 132, no. 4 (2013) Several scholars have made mention of this image as providing an apt analogy for the visual symbols found in Ezek 1:26- 28.26 Though Ezekiel the priest/prophet is no worshiper of Aššur (indeed, see his harsh words against non-Yahwistic forms of religion throughout his book), he certainly could have adapted Mesopotamian artistic motifs for his literary portrayal of the kãbôd Yhwh. Contrary to scholars who emphasize the anthropomorphisms in his book (esp. 1:26-28), 27 Ezekiel no more thought of Yhwh as a mere man than did Aššur s artists envision their melamme] of Aššur," which frightened enemies into submission even from afar. See Albert Kirk Grayson, Assyrian Rulers of the Early First Millennium BC (2 vols.; RIMA 2-3; Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1991, 1996), 1:199, 208, 2:14, 15. Similarly, many depictions of Yhwh in ancient Israel had no problem combining motifs of Yhwh as radiant and militaristic at the same time. For treatments of fig. 1, (= ANEP §536), especially its connection to melammu and/or storm deities, see the following: George E.

Mayer-Opificius ("Die geflügelte Sonne," 200, 233, Abb. 25) and Klingbeil ( Yahweh Fighting from Heaven , 260-61) prefer to see the god Shamash being represented in fig. 1 rather than Aššur. Cf. Ornan ("Complex System of Religious Symbols," 212-17, fig. 2), who argues that the symbol of the winged disk need not be restricted to a single deity and was fully able to represent Shamash and Aššur, the latter of which she chooses for fig. 1 due to its military aspect. See further LeMon, Yahwehs Winged Form in the Psalms , 97-101. 26 See Keel, Jahwe-Visionen und Siegelkunst, 260-63, Abb. 189; Allen, Ezekiel 1-19, 36-37, fig. 5. While Uehlinger and Trufaut ("Babylonian Cosmological Scholarship and Iconography," 147) acknowledge the value of this image to depict the phenomenology of melammu , because of the ninth-century b.c.e. date of the image they are overly critical of those scholars (e.g., Keel and Allen) who use the image to unpack the visual symbols associated with the historical Ezekiel. Because of the chronological distance, Allen (p. 36) freely admits that "it is unlikely that Ezekiel would have seen such a representation." A moderate view is found in Aster ( Unbeatable Light, 312-13), who notes the likelihood of similar depictions in later periods. 27 This is a substantial debate that I address in my forthcoming Religion of Ancient Israel Suffice it here to say that Ezekiel does use anthropomorphic language (1:26-28), yet at the same time he uses a "rhetoric of circumvention" (what Moshe Greenberg called "buffer terms" [Ezekiel 1 -20: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary (AB 22; Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1983), 53]) to differentiate the Most Sacred from the profane. In particular, Ezekiel uses three terms of circumvention (mar^eh, dëmût, cên) - fourteen times in just three verses - to avoid explicitly describing the presence of deity. That the "human" (3 ãdãm ) is made up of fire from his waist upward and downward underscores that this preternatural being is no mere mortal.</page><page sequence="13">Lewis: Divine Fire in Deuteronomy 33:2 803 majestic deity as being a simple mortal. Radiant deities - though anthropomorphic at a glance - can manifest their power and majesty by flying through air engulfed in fire. What soon becomes apparent through a close examination of such iconogra- phy (though with no claims to direct dependence) is that it helps us unpack the conceptual world of Psalm 18 as well as Deut 33:2. In both of these passages a fiery Yhwh (or Yhwh with a fiery retinue) in a battle context takes to flight to rout his foes. Both Ps 18:11, 15(Eng. 18:10, 14) and the Tukulti-Ninurta II image also depict a deity using wings and with bow at the ready to let loose his arrows.28 IV. Conclusion Yhwh was thought to be a warrior in earthy, anthropomorphic terms (cf. Hš milhãmâ in Exod 15:3). Yet ancient lore also depicted his military prowess on a cosmic scale, where he, like Aššur in Mesopotamia, could mount the clouds and fly on the wings of the wind, with fiery brilliance as he let loose the lightning of his arrows (Ps 18:8-15 [Eng. 18:7-14]). Even though the crux of Deut 33:2 has resisted endless attempts at decipherment, other poetic texts and cognate imagery support the proposal of Steiner and Leiman that the verse should be translated "From his right hand fire flies forth [Dès dãt ]." Future studies of divine imagery will need to wrestle with how the ancients depicted abstract ideas (fire, invisibility, name theol- ogy) not only via words but also, counterintuitively, through iconography. 28 Obviously, we need not press for uniformity. There is no reflex of Psalm 18 s cherub ( kërûb ) in the Tukulti-Ninurta II image above nor Yhwh s "feet" {raglãyw). This is not the proper venue to explore the many ways that solar imagery also contributed to concepts of Yahwistic theophanies and divine fire. Solar vocabulary and iconography (cf. the winged sun disks on Judean Imlk storage jars) were certainly a part of the conceptual world of the author of Deut 33:2 as he described Yhwh "dawning" ( zãrah ) and "beaming forth" ( hôpîac ) from his southeastern locale together with flying fiery imagery (*ěš dãt). For a recent treatment of winged disks and winged anthropomorphic deities, see LeMon, Yahwehs Winged Form in the Psalms, 27-58, 95-1 12. LeMon argues that "the image of the winged sun disk is one of the most common images in the ancient Near Eastern- and, specifically, Syro- Palestinian - art from the Late Bronze Age to the Persian period." For the relevance of the Iron Age Judean winged Imlk seals and the debate over whether they represented an emblem of royalty or a divine emblem (even representing Yhwh according to some scholars), see J.
