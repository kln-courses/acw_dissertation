<plain_text><page sequence="1">Schubert, Glendon, and Masters, Roger D., eds. Primate Politics. Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1991. Pp. xvi+296. $40.00 (cloth). The papers collected here attempt to combine the insights of political science and ethology to see how like, and how unlike, we are to our near relatives (of which the closest are, most probably, pygmy chimpanzees). Of the 296 pages, sixty-three are by Glendon Schubert, who is chiefly concerned to criticize those who read their unreflective political dogmas, or their outdated understanding of political science, into descriptions of primate society. Male dominance is seen everywhere because the observers expect to see it and take steps to eliminate female dominance or indifference from their accounts and even from the world: because female dominance would be an anomaly, experimenters seek to restore the natural state of things. He is supported in his critique by Thelma Rowell's commentary on the misapplication of terms like 'harem', ideologically understood, to the doings of seals or primates. Schubert is less critical of those who draw morals from the observed differences between</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 189 Goodall's free chimpanzees and those at the Arnhem zoo described by Frans de Waal. Those latter, Schubert plausibly suggests, are in much the same position as inmates of a penitentiary or nineteenth-century asylum. They cannot get away from each other, or their guards, and have nothing to do but "politick." Free apes can leave and have better things to think about than social status. The first half of the volume deals with the social relations of nonhuman primates, the second with those of humans from an ethological perspective. One of the major differences between human and nonhuman primates is that humans share their food. Blurton Jones suggests that the practice has its origin in tolerated theft rather than in reciprocal altruism between close kin. Underproduction, which avoids the too-rapid exploitation of a natural resource, is a welcome consequence of individuals' selfish choices, to scrounge from more successful foragers rather than to forage for themselves. A multiply- authored paper discusses the difference between agonic and hedonic modes of persuasion, as they appear in political interactions: when and why do human leaders influence their followers by smiles, and when by frowns? This paper, and one by James Schubert, describes the facial expressions and vocal inflections that older rhetorical theory recognized as the fifth part of the art of rhetoric, pronuntiatio. Roger Masters concludes the volume with a careful and well- referenced discussion of the relevance of primatological research methods and research findings to human political science. That other primates may act intentionally is one thing, that they act with anything like a full understanding of their situation quite another (and neither, of course, do we). This volume is a solid and suggestive contribution to an evolutionary understanding of human society, though it is not as illuminating, so I think, as either G. S. Stent's collection Morality as a Biological Phenomenon (Berlin: Dahlem, 1978) or Biosocial Anthropology (London: Maleby, 1975), edited by Robin Fox. Philosophers are likely to think that merely experimental science will settle few of the problems of comparison and interpretation mentioned here. "When Darwin wrote that we could learn more from baboons than from many of the Western philosophers, he knew very little, in fact, about baboons," so Shirley Strum and Bruno Latour remark in their paper on the social and political. It is not clear that he knew much more about Western philosophers, though he did express his growing admiration for Aristotle, who taught long ago that we were rational animals and that the political rested on, and was not exhausted by, the social. The contributors to this volume are more Ar- istotelian than they realize and share what seems to be one error, namely, to suppose that what, say, chimpanzees do can sensibly be seen as a stage between what monkeys and what human beings do. The real error is not, as Schubert supposes, to interpret animal behavior in terms learned from human interactions ("anthropomorphism") but to think that what we do is more developed, closer to perfection ("egocentrism").
