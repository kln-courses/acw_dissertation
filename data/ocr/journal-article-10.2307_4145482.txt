Michigan Monograph Series in Japanese Studies, No. 38. Ann Arbor: Center for Japanese Studies, The University of Michigan, 2002. xvii + 329 pp. $60 As the stream of recent publications demonstrates, Western scholars' interest in Japan's old art of no seems unbroken. This interest is not only with no as a living stage art but also with the complexity and richness of the texts, which</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 105 invite fresh approaches inspired by new hermeneutic methods. Now we have one more book on the subject. Its fashionable title echoes trendy discourses -feminist, performative, or psychoanalytic-and its subtitle may confuse the reader with its list of heterogeneous terms pertaining either to literary tech- niques ("wordplay"), poetic imagination ("fantasy"), religious matters ("spirit possession"), psychic phenomena, ("madness"), or group-related behavior patterns ("mourning"). The cover flap announces an even wider thematic scope including problems of social status, economic and political structures, and religious institutions and creeds-a comprehensive agenda indeed. It must immediately be said, however, that this book is by no means a hasty and perfunctory application of new (Western) theories and method- ologies to the ongoing discussion of this classical Japanese art. Rather, it is the result of lifelong research accumulated layer after layer during patient and focused investigations of no texts and contexts. More than thirty years have passed since the author's 1969 dissertation on genzai (real life) plays, a span of time in which the scope of her interests gradually expanded and her method- ological competence was impressively enhanced. What at first glance may seem a heterogeneous and unfocused approach is shaped by two self-imposed limitations that are pursued consis- tently throughout the book. One concerns the aspect of no under discussion, which is explicitly the dramatic text, leaving out all problems pertaining to per- formance. The other concerns the span of time considered, which is (as far as the restriction is methodologically possible) Muromachi Japan (1392-1573), the heyday of no text production. This clear delimitation serves the book well. It offers a refreshing contrast to certain recent Western no publications in which the practice of mingling textual analysis and stage techniques produces imprecise and misleading assertions. (See, for example, my review of Stephen Brown's book in ATJ 20/2.) At the core of Terasaki's decision lies her recog- nition of a major chasm within the art of no: between the medieval world reflected in the texts and the much more recent and unstable language of the stage (essentially developed in the Tokugawa period [1603-1868] and even later). Thus Terasaki proclaims a "return to the texts." To back up her posi- tion she quotes one of the most prominent no scholars, Yokomichi Mario, who complained in 1986 that "the critical analysis of the texts as dramatic literature has not been carried out because it is too complicated and involved." Ironi- cally, such a delay in analyzing texts as opposed to describing performance does not hold true for Western no studies. Outside Japan, no was for a long time perceived, evaluated, and admired exclusively for its texts. (Paul Claud- el's famous refusal to include stage production in his consideration of no is but one striking example of this stance.) And the trend is well illustrated by a whole array of fine textual analyses based on solid philological and literary research (as, for example, the work of Donald Keene, Rene Sieffert, Karen Brazell, Royall Taylor, Thomas Hare, Janet Goff, and others). It is true that the tropological complexity of no texts came to be fully recognized only after long and intensive investigations of the techniques of intertextuality in medieval genres; moreover, textual studies of the plays drew</page><page sequence="3">106 BOOK REVIEWS much profit from recent scholarly work done on linked-verse (renga) rhetoric (Ito Masayoshi and others). Thus Terasaki is able to rely on substantial previ- ous research when dealing with the rhetorical complexities of no. But she aims at a more comprehensive investigation of the art "dealing with topics that seem to have been overlooked" (p. xiii). She names them in detail: These topics include the ideological totalization of Buddhism as the religious-cultural authority; the performative aspects of the text that subvert such an ideologic-cognitive thrust; the rhetorical function of reincarnation and prosopopoeia as other and the priest's most crucial act of apostrophizing the ghost, acting as a link between the living and the dead; the literal and figural dimension of the tropes; and the dynamics of the conscious and the unconscious of the character's psyche. [Ibid.] Although not all of these topics-to be honest, none of them-can be said to have been "overlooked" by previous scholarship (an extensive list of works could be quoted here), Terasaki's undertaking is by no means redundant or perfunctory. The book contains a series of excellent exercises in textual hermeneu- tics (even if the term is never used by the author) that make extensive use of recent theories ranging from psychoanalysis to deconstruction, from perfor- mance theory to gender studies, from religious studies (especially buddhol- ogy) to new historicism. Terasaki's extensive readings encompass an impres- sive array of European and American theoretical positions articulated over the past few decades. But her ultimate guide in the poststructuralist methodolog- ical jungle is, after all, her sensitivity to the performative power of the no texts: a sense for their polyrhythmic time structure and their multifarious scope dis- closing dialogic tensions and subversive undercurrents of meaning, which both reinforce and disrupt dominant discourses in a historical period marked by great turmoil and social mobility. A fascination with no texts as producers and conveyors of meaning stands at the core of this book. The map of coordinates is drawn in the intro- duction: Terasaki places the production of no texts in the ideological and sociopolitical horizons of their time (fourteenth-fifteenth centuries). Altough she considers the changes in social norms that informed the no texts, she also pays due attention to techniques of theatrical performance and stage lan- guage. The section titled "Narrative and Tropological Structures" deals with a set of notions crucial to the understanding of no texts (yokyoku). The intro- duction as a whole provides a compendium sui generis meant to facilitate access to the texts, which may prove a valuable didactic tool for teaching no to students (although the mixture of heterogeneous concepts may perplex the beginner). The topics include not only the return of the dead, the ghost as other, reincarnation and anthropomorphism, and prosopopoeia ("the voice- from-beyond-the grave," p. 17) but also technical problems such as the impor- tance of apostrophe in the plays' economy. We learn of strategies in the trans- mission (and distortion) of legends; we learn too of subject representation</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 107 (the subject as a site) and the complex treatment of temporality in correlation to the musical progression ofjo-ha-kyut posited by Zeami. The author dwells on the role of poetry as a catalyst in the texts, on techniques of intertextuality, and on the power of ellipsis. (The "absent hero" is one of her favorite topics.) All these topics appear as orientation marks in the discussions of six plays distrib- uted asymmetrically through two chapters: a shorter one including two "plays of living beings" and a larger part dedicated to the analysis of four "plays of spirits and ghosts." The author leads us through the labyrinthine structure of the texts, patiently discloses their intricate tropological structure and multiple layers of meaning, and dwells on the religious and ideological implications. She is always in search of the authentic voices at the core of the plays-for their hidden and sometimes contradictory or paradoxical message. All six of the no plays discussed, attributed to Kan'ami and Zeami respectively, belong to the hard core of the repertoire and have already received due attention from the academic community. Even so, Terasaki's analyses are not superfluous, as they aim at extended, quasi-exhaustive radiographies of the plays seen in the light of recent critical and psychoanalytic theories. The first drama discussed, Jinen Koji, confronts the reader with an acute problem of medieval social injustice overcome by an optimistic mes- sage: it affirms the redemptive power of (performative) art. Its hero, the lay priest "Selfsame," who dedicates his life to helping the poor and destitute, demonstrates the miraculous effects of his entertainment arts, moving the hearts of two cruel slave traders and rescuing an innocent girl from their hands. In this display of the effects of entertainment, the drama pays homage to the Buddhist rehabilitation of the once scorned "wild words and specious phrases" (kyogen kigo)-meaning the spurious ways of poetry and the arts- authorizing them as a means that may lead to salvation. Beneath this tribute to the official religious discourses of Muromachi Japan, however, the play lets us hear the authentic voice of medieval entertainers-those marginal groups to which the no authors themselves belonged. In fact, this play sounds a chord that remains audible throughout the others discussed in the book: their heroes are all outcasts or, to say the least, are of modest social standing. But the author's main interest goes to psychoanalytic readings of the plays. With the exception ofJinen Koji, all the other texts give ample occasion for incursions into the dialectics of the conscious/subconscious workings of the psyche during moments of crisis. They deal with reincarnation and mad- ness, with hypnotic trance and ecstatic remembrance of a traumatic experi- ence, with the tortures of inescapable passion and the longing for salvation, with the transcendent power of love and hate, with the redemptive power of repentance and prayer. The discussion sheds light on the concept of self artic- ulated in the no: self as an open site extending beyond the modern concept of the ego (as a stable unit), prone to transfiguration, redoubling, splitting, expanding. Self is both transient (limited by the life span) and resistant to time's destructive forces, as it transcends the finitude of human life, extending beyond the grave, and is subject to inescapable karmic bonds. (Reincarnation and ghostly apparition are the preferred rhetorical techniques in the texts.) The antidote proposed by the no to overcome this perpetual bond-</page><page sequence="5">108 BOOK REVIEWS age is a sort of psychoanalytic therapy: performed remembrance of the trauma that may lead to self-recognition and enlightenment-an act supported through religious assistance, meaning ritual and prayer. But this process remains more often than not a conventional pattern compared to the abysses opened by the complex dramatic patterns of the lyrical parts. The examples chosen by Terasaki are among the most eloquent in the repertoire: dramatic turmoil in the mind of an aged and decrepit poetess torn by a paradoxical per- sonality split and in an enlightened old woman and a spirit still haunted by the remembrance of youthful sins (Sotoba Komachi); the uncanny confrontation between the protagonists of an unconsummated love story performed by their dead souls (Kayoi Komachi); the predicament of a maiden, undecided between her two suitors, who chose death and drew her two unhappy lovers into the grave (Motomezuka); the obsession of two maidens with the image of their dead lover, heightened to madness and the fancy of a unio mystica (Matsukaze); and the miraculous transformation of the spirit of a sinful courtesan into the god- like figure of a bodhisattva (Eguchi). Terasaki fathoms the depths of these plays, mapping configurations of meaning in the multifarious texts, following the sinuous paths of allusions and quotations, listening to the multiple voices traceable in the dialogue. The vocabulary of Western psychoanalysis is helpful in discerning patterns within the diffuse texture of the no. Moreover, the author's feminist readings allow the perception of social realities behind the elliptic rhetoric of the texts, which confront the reader with the chasms between dominant power discourses and their subversion by performative strategies. The precarious position of women in the medieval world is one of the author's central concerns. In fact, she con- fesses that the order in which she discusses these plays was determined by the status of their heroines: "moving from the lowest position of a woman, an orphaned girl in Jinen Koji, to the highest level of deification in Eguchi. It is a movement from the material world to the spiritual world, and from helpless- ness to empowerment" (p. 297). It is precisely in this empowerment that Tera- saki recognizes one of the essential and daring innovations achieved by the no. Notwithstanding the thematic continuity among the chapters, the centripetal attraction of each drama is for the author so strong that the book maintains an episodic structure: it must be valued as a series of sensitive and enlightening analyses of individual plays arranged into one narrative by the- matic links-a charming procedure that recalls renga progression. After all, the selection of the plays is guided by extraneous criteria such as avoiding dra- mas already discussed in Western languages. Perhaps this is why Izutsu is not included in the study, although it would have provided an excellent addition to the discussion of the split subject and the unio mystica with the absent lover, topics central to the book. Moreover, the critical repertoire offered by Western theories is not always enlightening when dealing with the rhetoric of no and indeed some- times leads to overstrained analogies. Thus in her sensitive analysis of com- plex wordplay strategies in a no monologue, the author, quoting Jonathan Culler's discussion of deMan, recognizes Proustian associations "triggered by a mechanism of involuntary memory, a metonymical procedure caused by the</page><page sequence="6">BOOK REVIEWS 109 'accidental transfer of association'" (p. 143, n. 5). All readers familiar with the punctilious associations stipulated by the renga rule books (which played a decisive role in the formation of no rhetoric) will agree that it is very difficult to trace involuntary or accidental transfers of association in the elaborate fab- rics of no texts. But such far-fetched comparisons are rare in Terasaki's book, which displays solid philological work supplemented by a strong orientation in Western critical theories. There are some slips of the pen-such as the anachronism of placing Saigyo's poems in the Kokinshui (p. 274) or identifying Ariwara no Yukihira as "Fujiwara no Yukihira" as the hero of Matsukaze (p. 233, n. 2). Notwithstanding these critical comments, this new book on no adds substantial recognition and much detailed knowledge to the Western map- ping of one of the major dramatic arts in world culture.
