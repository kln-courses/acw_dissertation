Species common to both states are Calypso bulbosa (var. americana in Minnesota but var. occidentalis in California), Corallorhiza maculata, C. striata, C. trifida (its occurrence in California is not on Smith's map), Listera convallarioides, L. cordata, Malaxis mono- phyllos var. brachypoda, Platanthera dilatata (var. dilatata in Minnesota but var. leucostachys in California), P. hyperborea, and Spiranthes romanzoffiana. Smith's book might have been enhanced with atable listing extra-Minnesota distribution ofthe taxa, at least in the western Great Lakes region. California and Minnesota are indeed lucky to have such splendid orchid floras. The rather nicer one for Minnesota perhaps makes the nastier winters there more bearable. - Rudolf Schmid, UC Botanical Juvenilia V Rudolf Schmid, UC For previous accounts in this series see Taxon 39: 81-92 (Feb. 1990), 40: 164-168 (Feb. 1991), 41: 172-174 (Feb. 1992), 42: 288-291 (Feb. 1993); see also G.

Key to abbreviations: "PLB" = publisher's library binding (hardbound) as opposed to a hardbound "trade" edition ("HB"); codings after the designated age level refer to presence of a table of contents ("T"), drawings ("D"), photographs ("P"), maps ("M"), scientific names ("S," names used at least in an appendix or index), glossary ("G"), bibliography ("B"), index ("I"), or text of non-scientists checked by competent expert(s) ("E"). Unfortunately, many juvenile books lack various of these essentials. Sentence complexity, scientific and non-scientific vocabulary, and various aspects of format determine the age level. Age level also varies depending on whether the book is likely to be read by the child alone or whether an adult is sharing the book with the child, such as books with activities and projects that will be done together.

Instead this is a well-written, analytical book for adults with an interest in historical child- ren's literature and/or folklore. Bernhardt &amp; Holden in separate chapters treat the engaging botanical fantasies of May Gibbs (1879-1969), who from 1913 through 1953 was Australia's leading author and illustrator ofjuvenilia.

This welcome new series on environmentalism is very well done (there are at least 14 titles). Each volume has a detailed index, a brief glossary, and a concluding "Taking action" chapter that includes addresses. There are no bibliographies, and only common names of organisms are used. The two volumes seen, and also Willis &amp; Black's Cars: An environmental challenge (ISBN 0-516-05504-6), are well illustrated, clearly written, and present both the pros and cons ofvarious arguments on conser- 669</page><page sequence="2">TAXON 44 - NOVEMBER 1995 vation, although the slant is naturally clearly "pro." Each book gives suggested experiments or obser- vational exercises in a section entitled "An earth experience." This series, unlike many science and technology books for children nowadays, actually uses chapters and consecutive paragraphs instead of MTV snippets of information. Where appropriate boxes expand the text. There is only minor overlap between these three volumes, for example, "global warming" and "endangered species" each discussed in two out of the three books (surprisingly these do not cross-reference each other). The complex facts and concepts presented in this series suggest an audience range well into high school. However, some consistent blemishes preclude an "excellent" rating. These volumes begin out of context with a vignette presumably meant to grab the readers's attention. Thus, Endangered species starts with a story of the Polynesians arriving in Hawaii. I would have preferred a brief introductory chapter explaining what endangered species are and "Why does it matter?", that is, some of the information on, respectively, pp. 19 and 82-93. Some terms are not defined in the skimpy glossaries (e.g., "plate tectonics" in Land use and abuse). Other terms discussed and included in the glossaries are not italicized in the text ("mutation" in Endangered species). The fascinating illustrations missed some captivating possibilities, as for the extinct Irish elk on page 21 of Endangered species (or Cugnot's 1769 auto on p. 13 of Cars). There are some anthropomorphic and factual slips, as "The green pitcher plant eats insects trapped on its leaf bristles" (p. 74), which should be "Sarracenia oreophila digests animals drowned in the liquid in its pitchers." Periodic omission of dates fails to put some statements in historical context, as 1962 for Rachel Carson's Silent spring or 1776 for "by the time the United States became a nation" (pp. 49, 53 in Endangered species). Some statements cry out for clarification, as why Europeans introduced rabbits and rats into the Hawaiian Islands (p. 11; respectively, intentional and unintentional). A few more maps would be appropriate for some volumes, although Endangered species has numerous maps, including many contrasting the historic and present ranges of species. Finally, text boxes labeled "Fact" give Ripley-believe-it-or-not-type details, perhaps implying that all information outside the box is "fiction." Although the volume on Cars, which also treats bicycles and busses, will certainly attract most juveniles, Endangered species is the most worthy and fills a void in the literature. There are very few juvenilia on this topic (see Taxon 41: 173 and entry for Halpem below). The book clearly shows how the Endangered Species Act (1973, renewed 1993) works, or is supposed to work. It gives many examples of endangered species, admittedly mostly zoological; pages 73-76 treat plants, which get only 8% of the funding of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Chapter 7 on "Are there solutions?" is excellent in its appraisal of the massive problems we encounter in saving endangered species. Busenberg, Bonnie.

[Contents: changing seasons in a deciduous forest; the worst winters; trop. rain forest; deserts; water; conclusion; key words (i.e., glossary); index; no biblio.] This first young adult book published by Timber Press initially impresses very much, in good part due to the effect of Capon's attractive pastel drawings and comprehensive treatment of a neglected topic. The level of accuracy is very high, as would be expected, because Capon has a doctorate in botany and also did Botany for gardeners: An introduction and guide (Timber Press, 1990, ISBN 0-88192-258-7, PB, $17.95; for review see R. Schmid, Taxon 40: 358). The book receives demerits for the lack of a bibliography and avoidance of binomials in a work aimed at a rather high age level. Collard, Sneed B., III.

Index very detailed.] This is another spectacular Dorling Kindersley publication (see entries for Hewitt and Ody under "Notices" and, for other reviews, Taxon 44: 483-485). Other biological works in the series are on animals and the human body, but I especially liked Ships and sailing, Military uniforms, Flight, and Armor when I saw them in the bookstore. The aforenoted topics get a large format, most lavish, de- tailed treatment: gymnosperms and flowers each a gorgeous four-page spread, the other topics two pages each. Just a single paragraph per topic defines terms and introduces labeled illustrations that depict various major groups of"plants" as well as external and internal structure of organs and adapta- tions. Because each page has many terms that are scantily defined (some are not defined at all), the book is best used by persons with some prior botanical knowledge. The work is classified as "Juvenile literature," but its level ofcomplexity suggests appropriate use even as an atlas in introductory biology and elementary courses in colleges and universities. As is common in juvenilia, "plants" is used in an all-inclusive, old-fashioned sense (see R. Schmid, "Botanical Juvenilia I," Taxon 39: 81-92). Dowden, Anne Ophelia.

The Sonoran book depicts 12 plants for each of the 12 months of the year as used by the Tohono O'odham Indians. The stylized illustrations are attractive, but the verse verges on doggerel. The ocotillo blooming in June struck me as a bit late. A map and glossary entry for the Tohono O'odham Indians might have been added. Johnson, Rebecca L.

This enchanting little book uses Thoreau's journal entries and Murphy's prose to describe the exploration of central Maine, including Mt. Katahdin (Thoreau's "Ktaadn"), at 1607 m elevation the highest peak in Maine. Thoreau (1817-62) and two companions explored the area in September of 1846, 1853, and 1857, but the book does not focus on a particular year. Kiesler's 14 full-page color oils and numerous pencil drawings grace the book. A map would have been a worthy addition. I especially liked the book as it recalled memories of my daughter and I climbing the mountain this past July 12th via the treacherous, bouldery Cathedral Trail, when I was convinced that the recently dispatched August RevNot column would be my last.
