That a scholarly history of the early United States Naval Academy (USNA) was long overdue is evident by the fact that 2010 brought two of them. These beautifully produced and illustrated books appear similar—even sporting the same dust jacket image—but they diverge thematically. William P. Leeman's The Long Road to Annapolis narrates the broad strokes of early naval and USNA development, whereas Mark C. Hunter's A So ciety of Gentlemen details midshipmen's discipline and experience once at the school. Complementing each other, these monographs interestingly spotlight the in stitution, although the surrounding context often re mains outside that illumination. Both works begin chronologically, moving from ca sual naval education to the first organized naval school at Annapolis, Maryland, in 1845 and finally to its tran sition into the Naval Academy in 1850. After chrono logical chapters, the texts develop their different themes. Leeman concentrates on the formation of the naval school, essentially ending his study in 1845, and argues that navy men and government officials called for the institution because of the increasing diplomatic and commercial role of the navy, naval officers' pro fessionalization, and the ability to produce officers as "distinguished gentlemen who possessed strong moral character" (p. 234). Hunter carries his study through secession, including a final chapter on the 1851-1861 summer cruises and training on the Preble, Plymouth, or Constitution, and argues that the antebellum navy, Na val Academy, and midshipmen professionalized. The books' subtitles well reflect their divergent subjects; for example, both authors employ brief biographies as il lustrative evidence, with Hunter's average midshipmen representing his focus on students and Leeman's de American Historical Review April 2011</page><page sequence="2">Canada and the United States 451 scriptions of prominent naval men reflecting his insti tutional theme. Hunter and Leeman confirm the historiographie po sition that the U.S. Army and Navy began the process of professionalization before the Civil War; they build on the studies of Christopher McKee and William Skel ton, and concur with more recent works on the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. Unfortunately they limit their analyses to a narrow definition of military professionalization, based on the work of significant military historians, and this choice serves to neglect the extensive scholarship detailing and defining nine teenth-century professionals and their values; Lee man's bibliography includes Samuel Haber on the sub ject, but the discussions in both books revolve around the limited construction. In addition to the restricted definition, an absence of educational context beyond West Point sometimes leads Hunter to assert profes sionalization where other explanations appear equally valid. A few examples suffice: Hunter's assertion that "Like a true profession" the Navy "indoctrinate[d]" (pp. 166,167) students with moral and mental discipline potentially reflects professionalization as much as it does antebellum American educational goals; an over emphasis on the possible "subconscious absorption of [Francis Wayland's] 'Moral Science' " (p. 162) as pro fessional ethics unsatisfactorily alludes to the impor tance of specialized knowledge in standard literature on professionalization; youth may have acted with "pro fessional-style corporateness" (p. 90) in their more fre quent truancy to French versus math classes, but it surely reflected the schedule (as described in an earlier chapter), which made it easier to skip French, directly following lunch, as compared to math, tucked in a series of courses. In a direct comparison of the texts, Leeman does a superior job of contextualization. As a stand-alone dis cussion of the early American republic and navy, Lee man succeeds in creating a thorough narrative of the start of Annapolis. He well presents the numerous pro posals for a naval academy, especially the partisan 1827 vote. The text too quickly passes over the 1850 reor ganization from the naval school to the USNA because it locates significance in historian-appointed-secretary of-navy George Bancroft's 1845 extracongressional cre ation of the school. Its brief sections on the middle class, military education, and manhood tantalize the reader and suggest the USNA's milieu more than they explain it. As context, the authors agree on West Point as An napolis's model with Leeman presenting the army acad emy in greater detail and Hunter creating a chart using Skelton's West Point data. Specifically, Leeman uses the West Point antebellum survey in which cadets self identified as middle class to stress that class's presence at and influence on the USNA; he asserts that "By the early 1840s the naval officers corps' quest for greater professionalism had merged with the moral reform cru sade of the American middle class" (p. 193). Given the vast scholarship on the nineteenth-century middle class, this conclusion seems valid and echoes my own similar conclusions on class and professionalization in southern private and state military schools. Leeman, however, lacks evidence for the middle-class standing of navy midshipmen and their families, and both texts could more directly address Peter Karsten's assertion of The Naval Aristocracy: The Golden Age of Annapolis and the Emergence of Modern American Navalism (1972). On both West Point and social class, Hunter lacks Lee man's content discussion but provides some excellent data; overall Hunter's twenty-eight tables in the text and appendices present categorized information on midshipmen's geographic origins, disciplinary records, and summer cruise grades. Hunter makes the heart of his text two chapters that compare twenty-percent samples of midshipmen re ceiving disciplinary reports in the school era to those in the academy years. Using this data, he finds a slightly lower rate of disciplinary problems among post-1850 USNA midshipmen. The significance of this finding and the detailed tables could be better articulated. The dis ciplinary trend could have reflected increased profes sionalism among the youth; however, boys being boys (noted only in p. 210 n. 42) and nearly identical expe riences at other military and nonmilitary schools (the numerous studies on students and/or discipline are omitted) challenge Hunter's conclusion that midship men recognized the navy as a professional occupation. Hunter is significantly more convincing in showing that the navy and USNA professionalized as institutions, for example employing quasi-scientific systems to regulate students or the shipboard experience as a "Total In stitution" (p. 128). Again, he confirms for Annapolis what recent scholarship has asserted about it, West Point, and private and state military schools. The authors made extensive use of memoirs and ar chives, especially navy and USNA records, and Leeman mined additional personal papers and government doc uments. A few of the same events and examples un surprisingly appear in both works. For example, as Lee man interestingly narrates the 1842 Somers mutiny and executions, concluding that its notoriety reflected mid dle-class desires for discipline and institutions, Hunter references it with few details, concluding that it encour aged naval reform and the school's founding. The texts occasionally slip into anthropomorphic language, as can happen with institutional histories; although they generally ascribe agency to naval officers or secretaries of the navy, when the texts present "Annapolis" or "the U.S. Navy" wanting a particular goal or expressing mo rality, historical agency is sacrificed for appealing nar rative. Historians of the armed forces and education now possess two solid institutional histories on the devel opment of the U.S. Naval Academy. The Long Road to Annapolis will engage students and general audiences with interesting prose and chapter summaries; Leeman well describes the start of the school, the main players pushing for it, and some of its environment.
