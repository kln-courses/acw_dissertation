ABSTRACT While the popularity of cremation in China between the tenth and thirteenth centuries is well documented, archaeological evi- dence for the Buddhist impact on the practice has been lacking. A group of Liao dynasty (907-1125) tombs from the Xuanhua dis- trict in Hebei Province, belonging to Chinese residents, provides significant visual testimony to the application of Buddhist rituals in disposing of the dead by cremation. The paintings of celestial objects, drawn on tomb ceilings and framed with Buddhist motifs, show striking similarities to esoteric Star Mandalas and demonstrate the acceptance of Buddhist horoscopic astrology by the laity. Executed during the Liao-Jin transition period, the Xuanhua astronomical paintings include the earliest illustrations yet known of zodiacal symbols in the popular pantheon of East Asia. The paintings are important clues to the synthesis of Bud- dhist and Chinese views of, and the ways to deal with, life after death. 29 Ars Orientalis, volume XXIX (1999)</page><page sequence="2">M7~~~~~~~~~~ '~~~~~~~~~~ /~~~~; ?%b M4~~~~ M9~~~~ ~~~M6 = *~~~~~~.'~~~' (' wb M2~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 4F~~~~~~~~~~~~ FIG. 1. |i4t2\a * The Xuanhua YS= Y '*7v\ tombs.

T HE AIM OF THIS PAPER is to analyze the astronomical paintings found on the ceil- ings of a group of Liao dynasty (907-1125) tombs from the Xuanhua _S 4 district, Hebei Prov- ince, and discuss their relevance to contemporary astronomical and Buddhist drawings. Previous studies have described these paintings as star maps (xingtu I J )1 or "unusual flower depiction(s)."2 But are these really star maps-maps of the sky as the people living in the Liao kingdom saw it? Are they "unusual"? In this essay I shall attempt to show that Bud- dhist horoscopic astrology and esoteric mani4alas, popular in East Asia between the tenth and thir- teenth centuries, inspired the drawings on Xuanhua tomb ceilings. Contrary to current interpretations, scientific understanding of the universe, I will con- tend, had little to do with the execution of the Xuan- hua paintings. In order to present my arguments, I shall first discuss the social status of the occupants of the Xuanhua tombs and examine the Sino-Buddhist mortuary tradition practiced by them. Next, I will compare the Xuanhua paintings to other important astronomical diagrams found in Chinese tombs. I shall, then, demonstrate the striking similarities between the Xuanhua paintings and the esoteric Star Man.dalas found in China and Japan. The Xuanhua astronomical paintings, I argue, attest to the impact of Tantric Buddhism on Liao funeral rites rather than revealing any advances in the accu- rate mapping of the sky. These paintings are closely related to the patrons' belief in an afterlife as well as their wish to escape the torments of hell and achieve rebirth in fortunate realms. THE XUANHUA TOMBS AND THEIR OCCUPANTS The subterranean tombs containing the astronomi- cal paintings are located in the Xiabali T Ao _ vil- lage of the Xuanhua district (fig. 1), near the modern city of Zhangjiakou -k J 1 *f . During the Liao dynasty, founded by the seminomadic Qidan tribe, this region was known as Guihua prefecture (Guihua zhou J Ts 91 ), belonging to the Qinghe commandery (Qinghe jun a SIW ) in the Liao Western Capital Circuit (Xijing dao fi-i). The first tomb, numbered M 1, was excavated in 197 1.' The main chamber of this twin-chambered tomb is 6.8 meters long, 3.10 meters wide, and 4.40 meters high. Among objects found inside were a funerary inscription, various clay figurines, and stone statues of lions. The walls of the tomb are painted with figures of musicians and scenes from daily life. The astronomical painting (fig. 2), described below, is drawn on the ceiling above the coffin. From the funerary inscription we learn that the occupant of the tomb is a Han Chinese named Zhang Shiqing ?k F P, who died in the first lunar month of the sixth year of the Tianqing ;kI era (1116) at the age of 74 sui , .4 Following his crema- tion in the fourth lunar month of the same year, Shi- qing's mortal remains were placed in a wooden figu- rine found inside his wooden coffin. The funerary inscription notes that Shiqing received the titles of youban dianzhi t A3 I A (palace eunuch on the Right Duty Group),yinqing ronglu dafu ,R** 4- *k3k (grand master for glori- ous happiness with silver seal and blue ribbon), 31</page><page sequence="4">TANSEN SEN jianjiao guozijijiu *k&amp; 1 - ; (acting chancel- lor of the National University),jianchayushi R V 1tp t (investigating censor), and yunqiwei ;-f (commandant of Fleet-as-clouds Cavalry)5 because he donated food to the government during the fam- ine of the Da'an k-A period (1085-95).6 The inscription also points out that his grandson, Zhang Shen 5{'4+, married a woman from the Yelii J1P4 clan.7 In March 1989 two single-chambered tombs, numbered M2 and M3, were discovered near Zhang 8 Shiqing's grave. Located a few meters north of MI, tomb M2 contains a hexagonal chamber measuring 2.9 meters long, 2.4 meters wide, and 1.8 meters high. Objects found inside the tomb include a funer- ary inscription, earthenware, porcelain vases and bowls, and metal utensils. The walls, like those of Zhang Shiqing's tomb, are painted with scenes from daily life. The astronomical painting (fig. 3) is like- wise drawn on the ceiling above the coffin. The occupant of this tomb, according to the funerary inscription, is Zhang Gongyou , who died in the third year of the Tianqing era (1 1 13) at the age of 45 sui. Gongyou was cremated in the seventh year of the same reign era (I 1 17). The underground chamber of tomb M3, located 40 meters southeast of tomb MI, is circular in shape. Although only 2.64 meters in diameter, the tomb holds a large number of funerary objects, including an inscription, earthenware, porcelain and metal utensils, and wooden furniture. The walls of the tomb are painted with floral motifs and pic- tures of birds.9 The eastern and western walls fea- ture paintings of a woman in what seems to be a study room.'0 The astronomical painting (fig. 4) in this tomb, as in the previous two, is drawn on the ceiling above the coffin. The funerary inscription from M3 reveals that the tomb belonged to Zhang Shiben R-tf X, who died in the fourth year of the Da'an era (1088).1" Shi- ben's cremation took place five years later. His wife, bearing the surnameJiao Af-, died in the third year of the Huangtong *,it era (1143) of the Jin dynasty (1115-1234). She was then 93 sui. After her crema- tion a year later, her mortal remains were placed alongside her husband's. By the time of neeJiao's death, thejurchens had overthrown the Liao kingdom and established another non-Chinese dynasty in northern China. Also by that time, the grandsons of Zhang Shiben, according to his funerary inscription (re-?)written in 1 144, held the prestigious jinshi A+ degrees.'2 The occupant of tomb M4 is Han Shixun # 01 )IJ. The tomb, excavated in 1990, is situated far- thest from the above three.'3 This is perhaps because Han Shixun was not related to the Zhangs and therefore occupied a different site in the ceme- tery. Yet, like the Zhangs, his body was incinerated. Due to gravediggers only a few of the funerary objects originally placed in Shixun's twin-cham- bered tomb have survived. According to his funer- ary inscription, Shixun died in the tenth year of the Qiantong A *.k era (1 1 10) at the age of 68 sui and was cremated a year later. The inscription also dis- closes that Han Shixun was a merchant. On the western wall is a painting of a man leading a horse, a motif found in Zhang Shiqing's tomb and common to other Liao tombs as well, which may represent Han Shixun's profession. An astronomical painting was also drawn in this tomb, as can be discerned in the faded images on the ceiling. But severe water leakage reportedly damaged the ceiling and the painting.14 In 1993, excavation of six more tombs in the area was undertaken. The first of these tombs, num- bered M5, is located about 18 meters southwest of tomb MI. The hexagonal main chamber of this tomb measures 2.7 by 3.16 by 2.49 meters. The funerary inscription notes that the occupant, Zhang Shigu Rk i *, died in the eighth year of the Qian- tong era (1 108). Shigu, 59 sui at the time of his death, was cremated almost ten years later, in the seventh year of the Tianqing era (1 1 17).'5 Tomb M6, whose octagonal main chamber is 3.2 meters long, 3.22 meters wide, and 3.4 meters high, is as yet undated.'6 The proximity of the tomb to the already identified Zhang family graves indicates that the occupant of M6 was probably a member of the Zhang family. And, as shall be argued later, the occupant may have been cremated around the same time as the Zhangs who occupy tombs M3 and M7. Tomb M7 belongs to Zhang Wenzao Z YZ.J, who died in the tenth year of the Xianyong A, t era 32</page><page sequence="5">ASTRONOMICAL TOMB PAINTINGS FROM XUANHUA FIG. 5 (LEFT).

The main chamber of this tomb is 2.7 meters when measured north to south and 2.89 meters east to west.'7 The well-preserved artifacts and paintings in tombs M5, M6, and M7, including their astronomical paintings (figs. 5, 6, and 7), are examined below. The number M8 has been assigned to a com- pletely ruined tomb in the Xuanhua cemetery. According to the excavators, almost nothing of the tomb chamber or the funerary artifacts has sur- vived. 8 Similarly, the ceiling of tomb M9, located 5 meters south of tomb M7 and 12 meters southeast of tomb M6, is totally destroyed. Also, portions of front and back chambers, as well as the wall paint- ings, have been partially damaged. Lack of funerary inscription, furthermore, prevents the identification of the occupant and dating of the tomb. Tomb MIO, on the other hand, is well pre- served. Funerary artifacts, the epitaph, the vivid pic- tures of daily life (including that of a tea ceremony), musicians, and the astronomical painting (fig. 8) on the ceiling have survived the pillaging of gravedig- gers and ravages of nature. The occupant of this tomb, according to the funerary inscription, is Zhang Kuangzheng 5-k - E, who died in the fourth year of the Qingning. i era (1058) at the age of 75 sui. Kuangzheng was cremated thirty-five years later in the ninth year of the Da'an period (1093).'9 Funerary inscriptions help identify the relation- ships among the occupants of tombs Ml, M2, M5, M7, and M10.

More- over, Zhang Kuangzheng's funerary inscription sug- gests that Zhang Shiqing of tomb Ml was his great- nephew. Zhang Shiben, of tomb M3, cannot be definitively linked to any of the Zhangs.20 Diagram 1 illustrates the kinship relation among the Zhangs entombed in the Xuanhua cemetery. It seems that the Guihua Zhangs, who lived and died during the reign of Qidans, did not hold any bureaucratic positions. The funerary inscriptions would have mentioned the official posts held by the tomb occupants. Even Zhang Shiqing, who is noted to have received a number of titles from the Liao court, probably was given official designations with- out any actual administrative posts or authority. Nonetheless, the Zhangs were wealthy and influen- tial residents of the Guihua prefecture. The lavish display of funerary artifacts, the decorated tombs, and the facts that Zhang Shiqing could donate large quantities of grain to the government and, at the same time, afford to spend money on Buddhist monks and monasteries21 demonstrate the family's affluence. Much of their wealth (perhaps acquired through commerce) and fame may have been accu- mulated during the time of Zhang Shiqing. Shiqing seems to have provided funds for, and perhaps also oversaw, the cremation of Zhang Kuangzheng and his son Wenzao. This may be why Shiqing's name, accompanied by one of his titulary offices (the pal- ace eunuch on the Right Duty Group), is inscribed on the epitaphs of both Kuangzheng and Wenzao.22 Shiqing's wealth and reputation may have even laid the foundation for the ultimate change, by the early Jin dynasty, in the social status of the Zhang family from commercial specialists to degree and office holders. THE MORTUARY TRADITION OF THE ZHANGS Even after the change in their social status and the fall of the Liao kingdom, the mortuary beliefs of the Zhangs seem to have remained unchanged. From Zhang Kuangzheng, entombed in 1093, to neeJiao, the wife of Zhang Shiben who died in 1144, the Zhangs followed the method, increasingly popular in East Asia, of disposing of the dead by cremation. Promoted by the Buddhists, cremation was common among Chinese and non-Chinese people living in Central and Eastern Asia between the tenth and thirteenth centuries. Patricia Ebrey estimates that during the Song dynasty (960-1279) about 10 to 30 percent of the deceased were cremated.23 More than seventy crematory tombs, dating from the tenth to twelfth centuries, excavated from Beijing, Hei- longJiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Hebei, Shanxi, and Inner Mongolia indicate that the Buddhist custom was prevalent in Liao andJin territories as well.24 The connection between Buddhist beliefs and cremation in the Xuanhua cemetery is clearly recorded in Zhang Shiqing's funerary inscription. The "Chapi ritual of the Western Heaven [i.e., India]" (xitian chapi ii * 3E it`w-tt), according to the inscription, was employed to cremate his body. Chapi (Jp. dabi), a transliteration of the Pali word 34</page><page sequence="7">ASTRONOMICAL TOMB PAINTINGS FROM XUANHUA jhiipeti (Sk. dhy&amp;payati), was originally the manner in which the kaiipayatis (kings) in South Asia, and later the Buddha, were cremated.25 "Cremation," as Bernard Faure points out, "was perceived by Indian Buddhists as dissociation/anni- hilation, and/or as re-creation/reincorporation."26 In China, however, people believed not only in pre- serving dead bodies and delaying their decay but also in the existence of souls of the dead that needed nourishment from their living descendants.27 Indeed, the idea of the existence of souls seems to have had a great impact on the Buddhist teachings of anatta (no self) in China.28 As a result, we find indig- enous Chinese Buddhist texts, such as the Yulanpen jing kh 9 -;L (Avalambana S5tra)29 and Guanding jing TO h;." (Consecration Siitra),30 acknowledging the importance of offering food to the spirits of the dead and consenting to the Chinese custom of entombing the dead.51 One Tantric master, Yixing 4i (673?-727) of the Tang dynasty (618-907), even ventured to write several books on geomancy.52 The mixing of Buddhist and Chinese beliefs in an afterlife is manifested in the practice of cremation followed by the burial of mortal remains in deco- rated tombs. In this regard, the Xuanhua tombs are important examples because they provide visual and written evidence linking the practice of cremation in East Asia to Buddhist ideas, something Ebrey finds to be rare in cremation burials.33 In fact, the Xuan- hua tombs indicate that the residents of Guihua pre- fecture were strongly influenced by Buddhist teach- ings. Zhang Shiqing, for example, may have been a lay Buddhist. He is, in his funerary inscription, noted to have donated money to Buddhist monas- teries, invited Buddhist monks and nuns to build an altar (daochang 1ei #) in his manor, recited (song &gt; ) the Fahuajing ; - (Saddharmapun.darika Siitra) one hundred times and read (du *) the Jin- guangmingjing k 3 . HA ; (Suvarnaprabhasottama Siitra) two thousand times, and had a dharanzi pillar (beita 4t.) erected in the western suburb of his town. Moreover, one of the paintings in his tomb depicts the Buddhist siutras 3'ingangjing - Jl' K1 (Vajracchedika [prajfiaparamita] Siitra) and Chang qingjingjing * * ;+ A (Prasadika Siitra?) being prepared for reading. Tombs M5, M7, and M1O also display a signif- icant impact from Buddhism. The wooden coffins of Zhang Shigu, Zhang Wenzao, and Zhang Kuang- zheng, who occupy these three tombs, are decorated with various dharanis (incantations) written in both Chinese and Sanskrit (fig. 9). On the left side of the coffin covers appear the five bija syllables: om, ram, a, am, vam.34 The other three sides have Chinese graphs that may be translated as follows: The dharani coffin, with its reflective powers, will hopefully relieve the soul [from hell?] and [help] it return.

The association between cremation and Bud- dhism is demonstrated in other Liao tombs as well. For example, tombs in Shilipu + X_ Xi village near Datong kt M[, Shanxi, constructed around the same time as the Xuanhua tombs, show strong Buddhist influences. Dhiragis, Buddhist stelae, and the fact that one of the occupants of the tombs, a Han Chinese named Liu Chengsui 17J it, was a lay Buddhist confirm the popularity of Buddhism in the Western Capital Circuit of the Liao kingdom.35 Dhizrati pil- lars, numerous inscribed funerary bells,36 and recently excavated pagodas37 from other parts of the Liao territory imply that the influence of Buddhism, particularly Tantric teachings, on Liao funerary rites extended throughout the kingdom. Dhlraitis, such as the Foshuo shengtian tuoluoni 4 7 A i Xi Pt 0* (The Dharri [for those Seeking Re]birth in Heaven as Spoken by the Buddha), and Zhuanshengjingtu tuoluoni 4I a J Pt ! ft (The Dharn.i for Rebirth in the Pure Land), found on the inscribed funerary bells and in the Xuanhua tombs, suggest that a certain number, if not a majority, of people living in the Liao territory, including Han Shixun and the Zhangs of Guihua prefecture, believed that Tantric magical spells could help the dead escape from hell and achieve rebirth in fortunate realms.38 THE ASTRONOMICAL PAINTINGS Iconographically and chronologically the seven extant astronomical paintings from the Xuanhua tombs can be divided into three groups.39 The paintings in the first group, found in tombs M3, M6, M7, and M ,0 consist of four concentric circles. The innermost circles have drawings of lotus. Unor- namented circular bronze mirrors, all of which have now dropped to the tomb floors, were originally placed in the center of the lotus in each of the paint- ings. Surrounding the lotus, in the second circle, are the Sun, Moon, and illustrations of the twenty-eight lunar lodges in the form of star diagrams. The outer two circles, which are divided into eight sections, have drawings of flowers and leaves. We know from the funerary inscriptions found in tombs M3, M7, and Ml0 that their occupants, Zhang Shiben, Zhang Wenzao, and Zhang Kuang- zheng, were all cremated in 1093. Lack of funerary inscription or any dated material from tomb M6, as noted above, makes it difficult to date the tomb and, as a result, the astronomical painting. But the simi- larities in the layout of the astronomical drawings and the motifs used to paint the walls of tomb M6 and the other three indicate that these four tombs may have been constructed at the same time. It is conceivable that the wall paintings, including the astronomical drawings, in this group of tombs were all executed by the same artist(s).40 The astronomical painting in Zhang Shiqing's M1 tomb is, as yet, the sole representative of a second 36</page><page sequence="9">ASTRONOMICAL TOMB PAINTINGS FROM XUANHUA FIG. LL4 Calendrical animal (Ox), tomb M2. After Wenwu 1990.1O:-pl. 1.1. WRII FIG. lRB. Calendrical animal (Ox), tomb M5. After Wenwu 1995.2:15,fig. 38. group. In the center of this painting, perhaps drawn just before Shiqing's cremation in 11 16, is a nine- petal lotus. An unornamented circular mirror, as in the above paintings of the first group, was initially placed in the center of the lotus. The lotus is sur- rounded by the nine luminaries: Sun, Moon, Mars, Jupiter, Mercury, Venus, Saturn, and the two imag- inary planets R5.hu and Ketu. The Big Dipper (Ursa Major, or the beidou i1 +) is located in the north- west. The twenty-eight lunar lodges, in the form of star diagrams, encircle the luminaries. The outer cir- cle is illustrated with twelve Western zodiacal signs (shier gong + - t ). The astronomical paintings from tombs M2 and M5, occupied respectively by Zhang Shigu and Zhang Gongyou (both cremated in 11 17), can be classified into a third group. These two paintings, like the drawings discussed above, consist of lotus and mirror in the center. The twelve zodiacal signs, instead of being in the outer circle, now encircle the lotus. The twenty-eight lunar lodges (in the form of star diagrams) and the Sun and the Moon come next. The twelve calendrical animals (duodenary series) in human form, which are usually found on epitaphs, enclose the painting.4' It seems that the calendrical animals, which are drawn separately within two circles, were not part of the core diagram but may have been added to emphasize the patrons' belief in cosmic forces. There are, however, appreciable differences between the two paintings belonging to the third group: (1) the circle to enclose the lotus in tomb M2 is not used in M5; and (2) the Big Dipper drawn in the M5 painting is absent from M2. These discrep- ancies may have resulted from the fact that the two paintings were drawn by different hands. In fact, when compared, the images of the zodiacal signs and the duodenary series in the two paintings show two distinctive styles. For example, the gowns worn by the human figures representing the duodenary series in the painting from M2 have pointed edges (fig. 1 la), but in the case of M5 they are rounded (fig. 1 lb). While the images of calendrical animals in M2 are represented in the form of caps, the animals in tomb M5 are drawn inside the caps. Moreover, the zodiacal signs in tomb M2 bear distinct "v" marks that are not found in other drawings. The painting from tomb MI seems to indicate that all the above astronomical drawings were meant to be drawn facing the sky and not the floor of the tombs. This way (fig. 12) not only do the twenty- eight lunar lodges correspond to the four directional animals,42 but the Sun and the Moon also occupy 4 S~~~~~~4 Q~~~~~~~~ 1~~~~~~~~~% FIG. 12. Astronomical paintingfrom tomb Ml facing the sky. 37</page><page sequence="10">TANSEN SEN their proper positions (Sun in the east and Moon in the west), and the zodiacal signs follow their normal clockwise position. A major disparity among the three groups of astronomical paintings, apart from the addition of new motifs, is in the number of lotus petals. The painting in tomb Ml has nine, M2 has eight, M3 six, M5 (part of which is destroyed) may have had either eleven or twelve, and the lotus in tomb M7 has seven petals. A possible explanation for this incongruity is offered below. CURRENT INTERPRETATION OF THE XUANHUA ASTRONOMICAL PAINTINGS The use of celestial symbols is not unique to the Xuanhua tombs. The earliest evidence indicating the use of celestial motifs in Chinese mortuary tradi- tion can be traced to a tomb from Xishuipo 4-7g,K near Puyang city A 1* Ti in Henan. The tomb is car- bon 14 dated to between 4510 and 3850 B.C.E.43 According to Feng Shi ;4 Q and other Chinese scholars who have commented on this tomb, the fig- ures of a dragon and a white tiger (two of the four directional animals) and the Big Dipper represented inside the tomb imply the application of the twenty- eight lunar lodges concept. Feng Shi points out the similarity between the astronomical layout in the Puyang tomb and a diagram found on a lacquer box in the tomb of Marquis Yi 'R 1, Z, who lived in what is now Sui county f3i #., Hubei, during the Warring States period (403-221 B.C.E.).44 The graphs for the Big Dipper, on the box, are drawn in the center of the diagram. The names of the twenty- eight lunar lodges encircle the above two graphs. On the opposite sides of the lunar lodges are figures of a dragon and a tiger. This diagram, and the concept of drawing celestial objects in tombs, Feng concludes, developed from the pattern depicted in the Xishuipo tomb. The two diagrams, according to him, are "solid representations of the hemispherical dome theory" (gaitianyuzhoulun de liti biaoxian X According to Sima Qian's X t .i Shiji P. Z (Records of the Grand Historian), an astronomical diagram is also painted on the ceiling of Emperor FIG. 13. Astronomical paintingfrom Wuyue tomb M26, Hangzhou. After Kaogu 1975.3:190,fig. 8. Qinshihuang's +X~I I (r. 221-210 B.C.E.) tomb.46 It is only after the First Emperor's tomb is excavated that we can verify the above record. Yet a tomb from Luoyang confirms that the concept of drawing celes- tial objects on tomb ceilings was fully developed by the Western Han period (202 B.C.E.-9 C.E.). The paintings in the Luoyang tomb include the Big Dip- per in the form of a star diagram, and the Sun (with a raven in the center) and Moon (with a tortoise in the center).47 Astronomical diagrams continued to be drawn on tomb ceilings during the Northern Wei (386-535), Tang, and Five Dynasties (907-60) periods48 and can even be found in some Korean tombs.49 It is possible that some of the above diagrams may have influenced the Xuanhua paintings. The diagrams (see, for example, fig. 13) found in tombs belonging to members of the royal Qian A family of the Wuyue kingdom (907-78), for example, are chronologically close forerunners to the Xuanhua astronomical paintings.50 Given the evidence of flourishing political and commerciaf relations between the Qidans and the Wuyue kingdom in Zhejiang,51 it is conceivable that either the pictorial design or the concept of representing the universe 38</page><page sequence="11">ASTRONOMICAL TOMB PAINTINGS FROM XUANHUA IL~~~~~~~~ FIG. 14. Suzhou star map. After joseph Needam and Wang Ling Science and Civilisation in China (Cambridge, 1959), 3:pl. 106. on tomb ceilings, or both the design and concept, were transmitted to the Liao territory. The Bohai sea-faring traders, who frequented the Liao territo- ries and Zhejiang,52 and the fact that a considerable number of Bohai households were transplanted to Xuanhua by Abaoji FTV** (Emperor Taizu dk4L, r. 907-26), make the connection between Zhejiang and Xuanhua plausible.53 Similar arguments can also be made for the Korean paintings. As will be argued below, however, if the Wuyue and Korean diagrams were an inspiration at all, they may not have been the only one for the people who con- ceived the Xuanhua paintings.54 Chinese scholars who have analyzed the paint- ings from Xuanhua have focused only on their rele- vance to the development of astronomical knowl- edge in ancient China.55 One of their major concerns is to prove that the concept of twenty-eight lunar lodges existed in China earlier than anywhere else. As a consequence, scholars such as Xia Nai IL X have answered mathematical questions rather than explaining what the paintings may have meant to the occupants of the Xuanhua tombs.56 Although recent Chinese works on Liao society have also considered the Xuanhua paintings to be "scientific" renderings of astronomical bodies,57 the fact remains that these paintings are iconographically very different from any of the star maps and cosmic symbols found in China. First, none of the other star maps, including those found in the Wuyue tombs, employs the West- ern zodiacal signs, lotus, or the two imaginary plan- ets-Rahu and Ketu. Secondly, whereas the star maps, such as the Suzhou star map k.1' d11 - L1 (fig. 14), are divided into time or angle segments, the Xuanhua paintings are not.58 Scholars who have stressed the scientific value of the Xuanhua astronomical paintings have often pointed out various "mistakes" in the representation of lunar lodges. The number of stars in some lunar lodges, according to them, does not tally with con- temporary works on astronomy.59 It should be noted that the highly stylized Xuanhua paintings are definitely not maps of the actual sky. They were probably used for their symbolic rather than scien- tific value. Hence, the number of stars in a particular lunar lodge mattered less than the fact that all twenty-eight lunar lodges were represented. MAN,DALAS? Despite the overwhelming evidence from the Xuan- hua tombs that testifies to the popularity of Bud- dhism, especially that of Tantric teachings, in Guihua prefecture, the prospect of Buddhist ideas influencing the Xuanhua astronomical paintings has never been fully explored. Since the occupants of the Xuanhua tombs, some of whom may have been lay Buddhists, practiced Buddhist-style funerary rites, had Buddhist dharanis written on their coffins, and used drawings with Buddhist motifs in their tombs, it is conceivable that the astronomical paintings were also drawn to express their faith in or conform to a specific aspect of Bud- dhist teaching.

While the lotus, the zodiacal signs, and the concept of two imaginary planets, Rahu and Ketu, entered China with the translation of Buddhist texts,60 the use of mirrors and calendrical animals can be found in pre-Bud- dhist Chinese art.

Lotus. The tomb ceiling in China, as has been noted byJudy Chungwa Ho, symbolizes Heaven based on the gaitian theory, while the floor, often rectangular or square, forms the Earth. "With additional painted imagery the ceiling," she writes, "easily cre- ated the illusion of cosmic totality."'" The use of lotus, the zodiacal signs, and the two imaginary planets makes it evident that Buddhist doctrines exercised significant influence on the "cosmic total- ity" of the Xuanhua tomb ceilings. Lotus (padma), an important motif in Mahayana cosmology, can represent enlightenment, rebirth, and sometimes even the Buddha himself.62 It is fre- quently found painted on the ceilings of cave-tem- ples in India, Central Asia, and China. Yet lotus sur- rounded by celestial objects is not a common theme in Buddhist cave ceilings. In a unique painting found in Sengim, near Turfan in Xinjiang Autonomous Region,63 a multilayered, multipetaled lotus, with the Buddha on a white horse (an allusion to the Great Renunciation) in the center (fig. 15a), is sur- rounded by anthropomorphic images of lunar lodges (fig. 15b).64 The names of each of these lunar lodges is written in Chinese and Uighur scripts. Probably dating from the ninth or tenth century, when the Uighurs in the northern Silk Road area converted to Buddhism,65 the painting shows traces of Tantric influence. In esoteric Buddhist tradition, lotus forms the core of manz4alas, the map of the 66 Tantric universe. Employed in esoteric rituals, man.4alas are supposed to unite the patrons with the reality of the universe.67 This universe is often con- ceived in the siddham letter a 3T on a lotus (fig. 16) in the center of may4alas.68 In some versions of the Tejaprabha (Ch. Zhishengguang A A1 + ) and Big Dipper man.dalas the A-syllable on a lotus is sur- rounded by letters (or images) representing the luminaries, zodiacs, and twenty-eight lunar lodges (figs. 17 and 18).

The use of lotus itself, it must be pointed out, is not limited to the ceilings of Xuanhua tombs. Two Liao tombs from the Beijing area, for example, have the flower painted on their ceilings."9 The Buddhist symbol is also used to decorate the ceiling of a Song dynasty tomb from Baisha t7 ;&amp;, Henan.70 All the above tombs, it seems, belong to Buddhist patrons. What is unusual about the lotus in the Xuanhua paintings, however, is the variation in the number of petals. As noted above, the number of lotus petals in the Xuanhua paintings ranges from six to twelve. Usually in Buddhist iconography, lotus is depicted as having four, eight, or twelve petals. The inconsis- tency in the number of lotus petals represented in the Xuanhua paintings may have been intentional rather than erroneous. Although speculative, an explanation may be found in the horoscopic astrology popular when the Xuanhua tombs were being built. In both Daoist and Buddhist astrological traditions the time of birth of an individual is an important factor. Burial dates in the Daoist tradition are calculated according to the year, month, day, and hour of birth of the deceased. Moreover, the tail of the Big Dipper, rep- resented at the burial sites, points to a direction that represents the moment of the individual's birth.7' Similarly, for the Buddhists "the point of depar- ture," as noted by Shigeru Nakayama, "was the moment of birth of the individual. Each part of the human body was said to be influenced by a particu- lar constellation."72 It can be seen from the astro- nomical paintings in tombs MI and M5, in which the Big Dipper is clearly represented, that the tails of the Big Dipper point to different zodiac signs (Scor- pio in the case of MI and Capricorn in the case of M5) and lunar lodges (between xin '_ [heart] and fang /$ [chamber] lodges in the case of MI, and the niu 4 [ox] lodge in the case of M5). It seems that the Big Dippers in the Xuanhua paintings were, fol- lowing existing custom (whether Daoist, Buddhist, or Buddho-Daoist), drawn to imply a particular period in time, perhaps the moment of birth of the individual. The varying number of lotus petals in each of the Xuanhua paintings may, similarly, corre- spond to a specific time or period, most likely the month in which the deceased was born. Yet it is not clear what would happen if the individual were born in the first, second, or third lunar months. The tra- ditional number of lotus petals may have been employed in such cases. The Zodiacal Signs and Horoscopic Astrology. The zodiacal symbols in the Xuanhua tombs are the ear- liest evidence yet known of their application in the 42</page><page sequence="15">ASTRONOMICAL TOMB PAINTINGS FROM XUANHUA popular pantheon of East Asia. They are additional, if not convincing, proof of Buddhist influences on the Xuanhua astronomical paintings. The zodiacal signs have been known to the Chinese at least since the seventh century.73 Texts such as the Wenshushili Pusa ji zhu xian suoshuo jixiong shi ri shan e xiuyao jing a; 0 q 411 X pi &amp; *J4 Pt'Ai- 4 O Elt A.,- J 8 (Sultra on the Auspicious and Inauspicious Times and Days and the Good and Evil [Influences] of the Lunar Lodges and the Luminaries as Spoken by the Bodhisattva Ma-njusri and Various Other Immor- tals; T. 1299) compiled by the Indo-Sogdian monk Bukong T, 2 (Amoghavajra, 705-74) in 759, Qiyao rang zaijue -e UA L A (Ways to Avoid the Calamities Caused by the Seven Luminaries; T. 1308) translated by the Indian BrahminJinjuzha - A, 6 (Suvarnakiita?), and Fantian huoluojiuyao t, X k0 BL hL (The Indian Art of Horoscopy [based on the effects of] the Nine Luminaries; T. 131 1) attributed to the Chinese Buddhist astrono- mer Yixing explain the use of the zodiacs for prog- nostication. The above astrological treatises are based on Brahmanical and Hellenistic horoscopic traditions, written within the Buddhist framework and interspersed with Chinese beliefs.74 Certainly the interest of Tang emperors, especially emperors Xuanzong C Z (r. 712-56), Suzong X &gt; (r. 756- 62), and Daizong 4k &gt; (r. 762-79), in Tantric ritu- als and preachers may have contributed immensely to the popularity of Buddhist horoscopic astrology in China.75 In fact, a majority of Chinese Buddhist astrological treatises were translated or composed under these three Tang emperors.76 Horoscopes fromJapan, magic circles found in the Xi Xia terri- tory,77 and the zodiacal signs in the Xuanhua tombs attest to the widespread use of Buddhist horo- scopic astrology in East Asia even after the fall of the Tang dynasty. To simplify the complicated arrangement of multicultural astrological traditions, Tantric preachers seem to have created manuals for those who practiced Buddhist horoscopic astrology. The Hord AZ Diagram (fig. 19), housed at Kyoto's Toji *4 temple, is an example of such a manual.78 The diagram explains auspicious and FIG. 20. Tejaprabh&amp;i May/4ala, Dunhuang. After Edward H.

The text in the dia- gram, copied from an earlier work injison-in , 41 iZ in the second year of the Eiman * 5 era ( 1166), is taken from Yixing's Fantian huoluo jiuyao. Another set of diagrams that emerged due to the popularity of Buddhist horoscopic astrology and esoteric rituals is the Star Manidalas (Xing mantuoluo I ij 1t , Jp. Hoshi mandara). The Tejaprabha and Big Dipper man4alas and the painting in Sengim, mentioned above, are exam- ples of such diagrams.79 Star Mandalas and the Xuanhua Astronomical Paintings.

The "Tang edition of the Big Dipper Maindala" (Tfhon hokudo mandara ,*4iE + 1 O i, fig. 24) housed in Tokyo College of Arts , although copied in 1148, indicates that Big Dipper Manidalas were already in use during the Tang dynasty. The extant Big Dipper Man. dalas, which date from the twelfth century and later, are found in both circular and quadrilateral forms. Circular Big Dip- per Maijdalas are housed in temples including H6ryuji ;k J#+ in Nara (fig. 25) and Ninnaji l-$ 4+ in Kyoto. Some of the angular versions are preserved 45</page><page sequence="18">TANSEN SEN at Toji (fig. 26) and Daigoji b_ O + temples in Kyoto. Celestial objects in the Big Dipper Mandalas are rep- resented in the form of personified deities or star dia- grams, in Sanskrit letters or Chinese graphs, or in some combination of these. It may have been left to the patron to select the iconographic form. The Tantric texts from which the Tejabrabha and Big Dipper manz4alas originate explain the methods of invoking the celestial objects to cure ill- nesses, avoid natural calamities, win wars, and achieve rebirth in the fortunate realms. The seven stars of the Big Dipper are especially important in this respect because they were thought to control the life and death of individuals. Listening to or reading the Tantric texts on the Big Dipper, as the work Foshuo beidou qixingyanmingjing 4I - it + - L- (The Siutra to Extend Life-span Based on the Seven Stars of the Big Dipper as Spoken by the Buddha) reveals, helped the patron, his/her ancestors, and future generations achieve rebirth in heaven. Moreover, it was accepted that making an offering to the seven stars of the Big Dipper might pacify hungry ghosts, enabling the dead to escape from hell and achieve rebirth in the Land of Highest Joy (ile shijie 4i- i -r, Sukhavati).82 Other texts, such as the Dasheng Miaojixiang Pusa shuo chuzai jiaolingfalun k At - 7r A -it th t A+ ;_ k (T. 966), describe ways to draw (hua ) and estab- lish (ianli 4i v) the Big Dipper and various celes- tial objects in the form of madzalas, suggesting that these diagrams (tu 1 ) and altars (daochang 4 i*) were often used to make offerings to the stars and planets.83 The similarities between the Xuanhua astro- nomical paintings and the Star Manidalas, especially the circular Big Dipper Mancdalas, are remarkably striking. Like the Big Dipper Manidalas, the Xuan- hua astronomical paintings are composed of twenty- eight lunar lodges, zodiacal signs, luminaries, Big Dipper, and lotus. While the outer circles have exactly the same motifs, the difference is in the core of the two diagrams. Instead of the image of the Bud- dha or the siddham letter a, unornamented mirrors occupy the central position in the Xuanhua astro- nomical paintings. Since these mirrors are found inside a Buddhist symbol (lotus), and because they differ from the ornamented Chinese mirrors, it is -C~~~~~~~~~~~~~ hSi;= s~~~ FIG. 26. Angular Big Dipper Mazi4ala, Tfji. After Universe of Maindalas, 82, pl. 22. reasonable to address the problem of mirrors from a Buddhist perspective. Mirrors, in the Buddhist context, have multiple meanings and usages. There is, for example, a mandala called Yuanjing mantuoluo A1 it, i (Circular Mirror Maindala) that could be used to "understand the meaning of the dharmacakra-pra- vartana (the teachings of the Buddha) [found] in the esoteric pitaka (jie mimi zang zhong zhuanfalun yi a* V: t A t #*4k4 ).,,84 A mirror is also used as a metaphor for emptiness, human mind, and the 46</page><page sequence="19">ASTRONOMICAL TOMB PAINTINGS FROM XUANHUA FIG. 27. %.

Moreover, in the following passage from the Buddhist text Da Piluzhenafo shenbian jia chi jing Xfll wi t u* *S Wgt t' ha * 4; (Commentary on Mahavairocana Sfitra) the Moon is compared to a mirror: "The lotus is dazzling. Inside is a full circular Moon, dustless like a bright mirror (yuanmanyuelun zhong, wugou rujingjing 1i3 A A k 4, ii _)X 8 In the esoteric A-syllable visualization tech- nique, the siddham letter a on top of the lotus is drawn inside a moon disk. TheJapanese tantric text Ajikany3jin kuketsu PIT 4 , )#fl ' k Pk (Record of Oral Instruction on the A-Syllable Visualization) notes: "The eight-pettalled [sic] lotus is the heart [karita, corporeal heart] mind. This is form. The mind [shitta, spiritual mind] dwells in this lotus. These two minds do not separate for even a moment, and therefore you should visualize the moon disk above the lotus.... The seed syllable of the lotus is the A-syllable. Therefore you should visualize the A-syllable within the moon disk."86 By visualizing the symbol, according to Shingon teachings, a patron can become one with the Bud- dha.87 Moreover, the visualization of the A-syllable was seen as an important part of the esoteric Bud- dhist mortuary tradition. The Indian monk Shan- wuwei - A a (Subhakarasimha, 63 7-735) in his Foding zunsheng xin podiyu zhuanye zhangclhu sanjie mimi sanshen foguo sanzhongxidi zhenyan yigui 4f , i -S &gt; L,, perhaps the source of the "Zhiju rulai xin podiyu dh&amp;rayi" AO"' )+t jz'Q A -tk 1t }! written on the coffins in Xuanhua tombs, explains that by visualizing the A-syllable, one could escape various levels of hell and achieve rebirth in the Pure Land.88 The image of a moon disk with the A-syllable on top of a lotus, as noted above, forms the core of some Star Maindalas. In fact, an instruction to draw the Pole Star Manidala (Miaojian mantuoluo AS LQ Piu- i) notes: The Rites of the Divine Star King says: In the cen- ter [of the mazt4ala] draw a great circular Moon. Inside [the Moon] draw the figure of the Bodhisat- tva [of the Pole Star]. In the left hand [the Bodhi- sattva] carries a lotus. On [top of] the lotus make the figures of the seven stars of the Big Dipper.89 * : X t -A Am 4 O t 11 A X, ,,A +4 + - [ -IE4t + Ifo The mirrors in the Xuanhua paintings occupy the same position as the Moon does in the Big Dipper Mandikalas-inside the lotus. It seems, given the over- all similarities between the Xuanhua astronomical paintings and the Star Maindalas, that the mirrors within the lotus in the Xuanhua paintings symbol- ized the moon disk. It is possible that the mirrors placed inside the lotus may have even had the Bud- dhist symbol for the universe (the A-syllable) writ- ten on them. The maijdalic representation of the universe on the Xuanhua ceilings not only conforms to the eso- teric mortuary beliefs expressed inside the tombs but is also consistent with the popular funeral practices of the period. In eleventh-century Japan, for instance, Iri A ,4 Maindalas were used to cover the body of the deceased before cremation.90 These mayaalas, with images of lotus, dhiiranzis, and the bija syllables (fig. 27), were to help the dead dislodge 47</page><page sequence="20">TANSEN SEN bad karma and hence be reborn in paradise. This, as we have seen, echoes the written wishes of the occu- pants of the Xuanhua tombs and may thus explain the reason for drawing a mandlala on the canopy above the remains of the deceased. CONCLUSION Wu Hung ascribes the frequent representation of the universe in Chinese mortuary art to the concepts of Heaven's will and the mandate of Heaven that developed during the Han dynasty. "Heaven," he writes, "manifests itself as concrete signs or omens on the ceiling, a decorative position denoting the physical existence of Heaven in space. It is 'above' and opposite to Earth below, in accordance with the assertion of Dong Zhongshu, the founder of Han Confucianism: 'Heaven covers all."'91 Celestial symbols were also often used by the Daoists. The Dipper constellation, for example, occupies an important position in the Daoist liturgical tradition. Kristofer Schipper points out that the Dip- per constellation is the "Controller of Destiny." It is, he writes, "present everywhere in Taoist [Daoist] rit- ual: its image is engraved on swords to scare off demons; as a receptacle filled with rice, the dipper is a pure and purifying container where ritual instruments and sacred writings are placed and protect them against evil influences."92 The Big Dipper, as Livia Kohn explains, also "represents the Tao [Dao] or the One in the center of the sky and is thus parallel to Mount Kunlun on Earth," a paradise where immor- tals reside.93 Such Daoist beliefs in and representation of celestial objects, as Xiao Dengfu A ^A has shown, contributed immensely to the development of Chinese Buddhist horoscopic astrology and esoteric iconography.94 Although the belief in cosmic forces was already a notable aspect of Tantrism before it reached China,95 the focus on the Big Dipper may have been an outcome of Tantric-Daoist syncretism. In fact, it seems that the Tantric texts on the Big Dip- per were all composed in China.96 Similarly, the Star Man. dalas that are based on the Chinese esoteric texts may have been the creation of the Tantric masters in East Asia rather than imports from India. Some scholars have already suggested that Vajrayana mazidalas are of non-Indic origin. Schuyler Cammann, for example, has argued that the Chinese T-L-V mirrors contributed to the devel- opment of Tibetan man4alas.97 Edward Conze, on the other hand, has pointed out the Central Asian origin of ma,04alas.98 And recently Todd Gibson has emphasized the impact of an "Indo-Iranian con- tact zone" in the rise of man.dalic symbolism, espe- cially because "there is no proof that it [maindalic symbolism] was widespread in India any earlier than in Inner Asia."99 While Gibson's argument may not be entirely convincing, since we do find Kautalya, as early as the fourth century B.C.E., using man4ala as a geopoliti- cal concept,'00 the Star Maindalas, which are a fusion of Indian and Chinese symbolism, may have actually originated in either Inner or Eastern Asia. Perhaps the diagrams were conceived in the early ninth cen- tury, soon after the Chinese Tantric texts on horo- scopic astrology were compiled. The attractive mag- ical powers of esoteric Buddhism and the Huichang persecution of Buddhism in 842-45 may have cata- lyzed the outflow of Tantric monks and texts, and with them the concept of horoscopic astrology, from Tang China to the surrounding regions. Thereafter, esoteric Buddhism flourished in places such as Dunhuang, Dali, Xi Xia, and Liao kingdoms, and Japan. In some of these places, Dali, Liao, and Japan, for example, Tantric mantras and mazi4alas seem to have become an integral part of the native mortuary practices. The dhIraai coffins and pillars, Iri Mai.idalas, and the astronomical paintings from Xuanhua are all indicative of this process of amal- gamation. Finally, a distinction must be made between those who engaged themselves in the empirical study of the sky and those who were primarily interested in prognostication. The difference between the two has already been pointed out in the works of Shigeru Nakayama and Nathan Sivin.'0' They have called the former style "potent" or "judicial" astrology and the latter "horoscopic" astrology. Similarly, a distinc- tion must also be made between the iconographic representations of the sky by these two groups. The first group struggled to produce diagrams of the sky 48</page><page sequence="21">ASTRONOMICAL TOMB PAINTINGS FROM XUANHUA in a correct ephemeris. The second group, on the other hand, was more interested in the symbolic representation of the sky. While the Suzhou star map is an example from the judicial astrological tra- dition, the Star Manidalas, including those found in the Xuanhua tombs, are related to peoples' belief in life after death and the options available to deal with it. The Xuanhua tombs, the artifacts accompanying the occupants, and the mandalic paintings on the ceilings illustrate the synthesis of Confucian, Daoist, Buddhist, and geomantic beliefs rather than point- ing to any breakthrough in the mathematical under- standing of the cosmos. R Notes The connection between the Xuanhua paintings and the Star Mandalas was first examined in a term paper written for the Seminar on Liao Art taught by Nancy Steinhardt at the Univer- sity of Pennsylvania in the spring of 1991. Some of the points discussed in that paper can be found in Steinhardt'sLiaoArchi- tecture (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1997), 342-47, and in her recent article "Liao Archaeology: Tombs and Ideol- ogy along the Northern Frontier of China," Asian Perspectives 37.2 (1998): 224-44.

The late cremation dates, as is seen in tombs M3 (four years), M5 (nine years), M7 (nineteen years), and M10 (thirty- five years), may have been a result of current geomantic prac- tices. For geomancy and its connection to late burial dates, see Patricia Buckley Ebrey, "The Response of the Sung State to Popular Funeral Practices," in Religion and Society in T'ang and Sung China, ed. Patricia Buckley Ebrey and Peter N. Gre- gory (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1993), 209-39. 20. The generation name Shi seems to suggest that Shiben may have been a cousin of Shigu and Shiqing. 21. See the following section. 22. Kuangzheng's epitaph records that he and his "grandson" (sunnan . 4 X) Shiqing were "friends-from-heart" (yi xin xiangyou k( '-if 4 At). Wenzao's epitaph, on the other hand, notes: "[Zhang] Shiqing, the palace eunuch on the Right Duty Group, mourns him just as a son [would do]" Wft FE A ef PA t 4 e t- . See, Wenwu chunqiu 28.2 (1995): 15; and Wenwu 1996.9:45. Kuangzheng was probably Shiqing's great- uncle, and Wenzao his uncle. Shiqing could have also provided funds for the burial of Zhang Shiben, another Zhang family member whose cremation took place in 1093. Yet the author of Shiben's new epitaph, written in 1144, chose not to mention Shiqing. Instead, the focus is on the grandsons of Shiben who successfully passed the prestigious jinshi exams and may have financed the new epitaph upon the death of their grandmother. 23.

This view was also popular among the people who lived in the Kingdom of Dali (937-1253) in Yunnan. The common fac- tor between the two regions was the prevailing influence of es- oteric Buddhism.

Yi Shitong compares the number of stars in the lunar lodges de- picted in tombs Ml, M2, and M3 to those mentioned in Wang Ximing's XE * OA (fl. seventh century) Bu tian ge + Ak (The Song of Walking on the Heaven). He concludes by saying that "the artists of the [Xuanhua] paintings were not familiar with celestial objects" (21). The artists who drew astronomical paintings on Xuanhua ceilings may not have been familiar with scientific knowledge of stars and planets, but as the Song work Xuanhe huapu R l 4 (Catalogue of Paintings [Compiled during the] Xuanhe [Reign Period]) indicates, one could find painters expert in drawing celestial objects and the Buddhist images of R5hu and Ketu.
