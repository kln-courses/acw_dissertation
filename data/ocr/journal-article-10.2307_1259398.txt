<plain_text><page sequence="1">Folklore vol. 98:i, 1987 28 'My Brother, Vein of my Heart:' Arab Laments for the Dead in Israel MISHAEL MASWARI CASPI FOR JOSEPH H. SILVERMAN I conducted field research during the period 1980-1982 in Galilee and the Golan Heights region of Israel in order to discover whether oral poetry still exists there, and, if so, in what genre. My research concentrated on two areas of oral poetry: laments and lullabies. I wished to investigate whether content and motifs of oral poetry were still intact and any possible processes of change those intact had undergone. From a collection of over 100 poems,' I have chosen 36 of the laments to discuss here; unfortunately, owing to considerations of space, their full texts cannot be reproduced here, but references are given after each quotation. These poems were collected from various Christian, Muslim and Druze Arab villages; details about informants and the context of performance will be given below (pp. 37-9). I first translated2 and then added notes wherever I felt explanations were in order.3 Despite the unavoidable process of social change they are undergoing, this collection represents only one facet of the oral poetry still existing in these villages. One of my informants summarized the oral tradition in these words: My grandmother was a eulogizer and my mother learned from her. When my mother was at home alone and remembered a member of her family who had passed away, she sang sorrowfully and mournfully about them. I learned these poems from her, and those who come after me will learn from me. The genre of laments is extremely old. Human beings naturally express their sorrow over the eternal separation from a loved one in a poetic way. In these verses the poet sings about destiny and about emptiness in the heart. However, other motifs are also conveyed, such as praise of the beloved dead, and philosophical statements with which the poet concludes the lament. Images are employed to convey a sense of disaster which has befallen the family and has, in certain instances, even extended to the village, tribe, and people. The mourner is described as suffering because of an imposed separation. The beloved deceased is described as one who took the heart and soul of his loved ones and left them in pain likened to a searing fire. The mourner cries excessively, suffers from insomnia, and coos like a dove. Time is presented in the images as mercilessly striking a family unawares. Time is described in anthropomorphic fatalistic terms (and one can detect the permeating sense of fatalism) which can be summarized by the statement, 'Everyone is in the hands of Time.' The speaker speaks from a subjective point of view. On the one hand (s)he is the object of all afflictions; on the other (s)he is the subject reacting to the phenomena. It is interesting to note the uniqueness of this viewpoint where the eulogizer addresses the audience stating, 'The afflictions which have befallen the deceased are also my afflictions.' Other motifs in the laments stress the cessation of pleasure. The set of metaphors</page><page sequence="2">'MY BROTHER, VEIN OF MY HEART' 29 frequently used in this genre are borrowed from another, namely poems about separation, in which the beloved complains of abandonment or desertion. Separation, in both cases, is considered to be the ultimate end and is expressed as an extremely traumatic personal event. Thus, when the speaker laments the separation of a beloved in a eulogy, (s)he juxtaposes the past (when the beloved was still alive) with the present (the occasion of the beloved's death). This dichotomy is used to accentuate the sorrow and suffering of the audience by making it immediate and relived. Motifs relating to distress also existed in pre-Islamic poetry. Then, too, the eulogizer lamented separation from the beloved, fear of death, and Time-imposed suffering. In the ancient poetry 'Night' was another motif. It was described as seeming to last forever, or else howling like the sound of waves crashing upon the shore. The poet Imru al- Kais4 described Night as everlasting, with stars securely tied down as though immobile forever, paralleling the image of his own life which has darkened forever. This is just one method used to convey the subjective viewpoint of the speaker.5 Hebrew poetry of the Middle Ages used the same motifs and metaphors. Moses Ibn- Ezra' also wrote about the Night being tied down, with heavy clouds passing slowly. The poet Tudrus Abulafia7 wrote a whole chapter on the motif of Night in which he contrasts the long night of suffering with the short night of pleasure. A Bedouin was asked, 'Why are your laments the most noble of your poetry?' He answered, 'Because when we sing them our hearts are consumed with pain.' The lament holds a very special place in Arabic poetry. As Taha Hesin has explained in his interpretation,s they are considered to be the most beautiful because they are free from superficiality. Ibn Rabihi9 explains that laments soften even the hard-hearted and bring tears to the eyes. Classical laments in their convention are close to the poetry of the Hamasa,'o or the 'Courageous Ones,' which called upon the tribesmen to exact revenge for any wrongdoing or bloodshed committed against their tribe. So too the classical lament demanded revenge, as the poetess al-Hansa" has demonstrated, yet through the years this motif weakened and attention was shifted to the motifs of sorrow and the shock of the bereaved. The major themes expressed in classical laments are those of pain and grief, praise for the deceased, comforting words for the family, and philosophical statements. Although these elements were not all required of each lament, the actual disaster was always an important, if not central, part of every poem. In the physical world there are many contradictions: sunlight turns to darkness; the moon wanes; mountains are ground to dust; and fertile areas are turned into deserts. However, the beloved deceased is described as one who always brought light, abundance and blessing. The motif of weeping describes the immense sorrow of the mourners. Tears relieve sorrow and were thus called upon to 'flow like a river' or like the 'blood of the heart.' Although using tears as a means to relieve sorrow or pain, it should also be understood that the eulogizer intends sorrow to be everlasting. Thus is kept the vow to lament the deceased forever. The motif of the vow involves the mourner renouncing his or her right to joy, self- adornment or any pleasurable experience. In pre-Islamic poetry this motif was developed in response to the frequency of violent deaths, in which case the vowtaker could only break the vow after revenge had been exacted.12 In the Islamic period, however, the vow to mourn the dead expanded its dimensions. Here it appears that the mourner vows to relinquish joy for now and forever. We see examples of this in al-Mutanabi's'3</page><page sequence="3">30 MISHAEL MASWARI CASPI laments for his grandmother, as well as the laments of al-Ma'ari14 who took it upon himself to deny his own laughter. In our collection we see that these motifs common to Classical poetry were also preserved for generations in the oral tradition. In the laments death is described as a natural disaster, the occurrence of which darkens the world of the surviving lover. Thus it seems that the morner dooms herself or himself to live in eternal darkness: In the house I raise walls of brick To forbid the sun to shine upon me. (4:8-9) The eulogy for the Druze leader, Sultan Basha, echoes the same motif: The hero has died, darkening our hope and likewise the moon; The east has lost one of its foundations. (6:1-4) The death of a hero and leader leaves the followers in darkness. Images of eclipses and darkness connote a tumultuous disaster. When natural powers vanish and the foundation of the earth is destroyed only a void remains. This void is then filled with the sorrow of mourners: My eyes continue crying And the sun dampens its fire (8:1) and, in another poem: How can I sing praise to you? It is a shame that our destiny has darkened; It is a shame that our moon has eclipsed. (9:4-5) In the poetic form the speaker tries to bring the void upon herself or himself by cursing the foundation of the universe, causing it to crumble so that it may then be filled with sorrow and tears. There are several different methods employed to describe the death of the beloved and the response of the mourners. In one case we see what may be called a traditional eulogy, where the mourner laments the loss of the beloved: I wish for the holy days to cease their brilliance, And for the renouncement of Joy on earth. The pain will consume us ... And when I left I was griefstricken; God will curse your house. (4:18,21) In another instance death is described as a defeat on the battlefield; a disastrous situation for the family as well as for the whole generation. We see the despair and hopelessness expressed in the following lines: The spirit of mourning came to our family, Defeat and grief came to our generation. (7:6)</page><page sequence="4">'MY BROTHER, VEIN OF MY HEART' 31 The speaker may also describe the departure of the beloved in terms of physical maiming, as a stabbing of the heart or a burn: My brother, vein of my heart, Plucking it will hurt me; My brother, rib of my ribs, Breaking it will hurt me. (3:14-15) and: For the loss of the young one who brought us joy, Our hearts have been stabbed with grief. (12:2) and: 'Have patience' they said As my heart they singed; I suffered and the fire consumed me. (14:3) The secondary motif of fire and burns is used to emphasize the degree of pain and grief: Your separation weighs heavily on my heart, On my heart weighs heavily your separation, Like taking fire to a burn; But he who burns by fire should only a despot be. (13:10-11) Folk eulogies echo the themes in classical poetry in which the mourner dooms himself to a lifetime of sorrow and the renouncement of joy. The mourner vows to burn spring flowers, to leave the eyes unadorned, and to avoid smiling unless the beloved could be miraculously redeemed: But if they do not bring back my darling I swear to sear them in fire; And if my eyes should desire to be painted in blue Even with the pencil of K'hull shall I paint them; And if my teeth should desire to smile, I will break them on stones of basalt; If my hair needs combing, I will comb it with thorns. (1:3-6) Because the sorrow is so acute, the motif of tears as a release of pain, is common in the oral eulogies as well as in classical poetry, as in the following extracts from two different texts: Weep my eyes, weep; O eyes, do not cease your lament! (4:14) My eyes continue crying And the sun dampens its fire. (8:1) Perhaps the multitude of tears is blocking the sunlight from the mourner's eyes, but on another level the image of unceasing tears may be a hyperbole for the apparent darkening of the mourner's world. Similarly, weeping is stressed in two further poems: O tears of my eyes, flow forth, Renew your lament For the separation of the brother, weep! O my brother, close to my heart, Ah my brother, my beloved. This is life's destiny. (10:1-3)</page><page sequence="5">32 MISHAEL MASWARI CASPI and: If I sing they say she's happy, Though I mourn for the passing of the beloved ... I came to the home of the beloved, But found it empty and abandoned. (5:9,13) In another poem the speaker describes her cries like the cries of a black bird: In the name of God I clamour for the black bird For the day of separation which is black. (5:9) The motif of the black bird is another recurrent theme, the black bird actually being a raven,"5 a symbol of bad tidings and encroaching disaster. The raven signifies danger both by his physical presence and by the sound that he makes: Once we were together, then we were separated Because between us the raven cawed. (4:14) However, in one poem the poet does not even mention the raven or the black bird by name and yet that is the impression conveyed by the image of a bird soaring over a graveyard. Perhaps this is meant to symbolize the continued sense of calamity, despite the fact that the deceased has already been buried: And he soars above the lion. (35:5) Another motif which is developed in the eulogies is that of redemption. The speaker knows that death's decree is unavoidable, and that redemption of the deceased back to life is impossible, and yet as an expression of deep pain and as an act of love (s)he is prepared to forfeit life or worldly goods in exchange for the redemption of the beloved deceased. The poetess Al-Hansa offers to chop off her hand and forfeit her property in order to redeem her brother.16 The motif of the vow is twofold: on the one hand, a mourner takes a vow to grieve for his beloved for evermore, and yet on the other hand a vow is a commitment to redeem the deceased at all costs. Here are three instances of this theme: God have mercy upon your creatures; If we could redeem him with all our worldly goods. I wish to redeem you and bring you back; I would rather die to have you live. and: O son, take an oath to bring her back, Your mother who is dear to you, very dear. However, this motif is used only in respect to one who has died of natural causes or as a result of destiny, as opposed to poems in which we see a revenge-motive. In the latter type, blood-money is offered as a token for redemption; however, in such cases the mourners commonly refuse all tokens except revenge. All the aforementioned motifs have been preserved in the oral eulogies in the same manner of expression as in classical poetry. As we will see, not only were creative images preserved through the generations, but also religious concepts.</page><page sequence="6">'MY BROTHER, VEIN OF MY HEART' 33 Scholars of Islamic Studies have discussed the influence of the Prophet and the Quran on Arab poets in the Classical period.17 Classical poets frequently were spokesmen for the prophet, and were undoubtedly influenced by his religious perceptions. Religious concepts are preserved in classical poetry even more so than in Jahaligaha poetry. In reference to concepts of death, destiny, Time, and the pen (or qalam) of God (which decreed the destiny of humanity), we see numerous echoes of Quranic verse.'" The controlling ideology is that the world belongs to God alone, and all that He decrees is fulfilled.19 There is a contempt for death imbedded in these poems, perhaps as a response to the helplessness one experiences in the face of destiny. Only those who had sacrificed their lives for God were thought worthy of being close to Him. Thus the ideal of the Arab warrior as martyr was soon conceived; the selfless sacrifice to God and to one's faith in Him. However, this religious concept changed during the Ummayad period.20 The Ummayad poets wrote according to the poetic convention of the Jahaliyah; their fatalistic perceptions, however, were no different than they had been in the age of Muhammad. Garir, a contemporary of Farazdac, represents Ummayad Age poetry in which concepts of life and death are espoused, but death as a fatalistic concept has lost its religious significance.21 Destiny as God's inescapable decree, and death as a fatalistic concept, are both elements of oral poetry. That is to say the poetic convention which conveys these deep religious convictions is identical in the classical and the oral modes. On the other hand, the ghost of Death, a common image in classical poetry, is a rare element in oral poetry. In our collection the ghost of Death appears only once: Tell them that she lost, Give her a sign, you know. (5:1) Death (or 'the day of separation') is described as a day of blackness and calamity. In one poem this day is metaphorically described as bracelets falling from the wrist of the surviving lover: O Ibn Ammi who sheltered me! O like bracelets tumbling from my wrist! (13:3) in another like a howling caravan of camels: Ah! Cries like howling camels for the day of separation (36:5) In accordance with the fatalistic perception of death, it is believed that human beings should submit to their destiny and the Will of God: I pursued him to the Spring Asawar; O wife, leave him to his fate. (1:10) and: This is their destiny, yes this is their Time, And this is God's decree; Death leaves some unscathed. (5: 8-9)</page><page sequence="7">34 MISHAEL MASWARI CASPI Although the decree has been written and sealed, no one can be sure when their time will come, and hence all Mankind lives in the shadow of Death: It is decreed upon every creature; All of God's creatures walk in the shadow of death. (7:7). and: Let us entreat God's mercy; There is no escape from the pursuit of death. (10:6) And such is God's will: But such is God's will, And so we ought to suffer. (12:4) The eulogizer turns to God to ask for help in giving the mourners strength to accept their own destiny. It is thought that only He really understands the depth of their grief: Furnish us with patience when destiny arrives; We turn to you, He who knows our grief. (11:2) A feeling of powerlessness in the face of destiny causes the survivor to curse the dead man's fate and even his home. The place which had previously been a source of comfort and security suddenly feels strange and alien: Now I will sojourn to your house no longer, I entered your home but you were not there, And when I left I was grief-stricken, God will curse your house, Since trust no longer resides where the beloved does not. (4:20-22) Words of praise for the deceased are an integral part of the eulogy. The deceased may be described as a warrior, a generous person, a wise counsellor, or a respected leader. These images are emphasized in classical poetry, especially descriptions of leadership or courage in battle. Remnants of these images are also to be found in oral poetry, although more prevalent are descriptions of generosity and moral leadership: Oh Sheiks of the tribe, let your horses graze, So-and-so has gone to prepare you a feast. (1:15) and: It is piteous, O good shepherd: O modest and generous one, you are dying. (9:3) and: O noble ones, so comforting to be in their midst; The sheik and the judge trusted in him. (3:8) The courage of the deceased is metaphorically described using images of either a lion or horseman: Where is the lion, O lion's comrade, where? He is loading the gun by the spring. (32:1-2)</page><page sequence="8">'MY BROTHER, VEIN OF MY HEART' 35 and: Oh how sad, the brave one has died! ... Oh for shame that the brave one has no shepherd! And he soars above the lion. Oh how grievous for the brave one, why did the raven caw? He is cawing for the lion, lying cradled in the grave. (35:1, 4-7) In some cases the beauty of the deceased is praised in terms of dress or a graceful walk: 'like a bride.' These descriptions are more reminiscent of life situations than those of death, probably to cushion reality as well as to prolong the illusion that death has yet to arrive. This illusion is extended to the pall bearers who are occasionally portrayed as carrying a bridal canopy rather than a coffin. From these images we can infer that there is a relationship between a funeral procession and a wedding march, and that this relationship derives from the life cycle. It is a confirmation that death is just as much a part of life cycle as marriage: Why does the maiden depart so sadly? They walked with a wedding canopy past the graveyard. (2:12) and: He comes to me on a festive day adorned in fresh garments, More beautiful than the finery of maidens on a holy day. How handsome and beautiful he is, Even more than the maidens dressed for a holy day! (3:9-10) and: He is as graceful as a bride And so special even the house brightens when he enters (5:12) Sometimes images of beauty are derived from the genre of love poetry; Among the gazelles that went down to the spring, one gazelle White with a long neck. (25:5-6) and: Where is the dear one's house, that house up high? Call upon the beloveds that bring us so much joy. (27:6-7) When images of beauty are thus represented in eulogies, they contradict the stark reality of death: His moustache is like a fine line of a quill on paper ... His moustache is like the fine line of a quill on easels ... His moustache is like a line drawn on an easel. (34:4,6,8) Time, the carrier of fatal destiny, is the cause of separation and destruction. The concept of Time is represented in anthropomorphic terms, both in classical and in folk poetry. Al-Bahari conveyed the words of the prophet saying, 'And God said, "Man insulted me and accused Time, but I am Time and in my hand is Destiny and it was</page><page sequence="9">36 MISHAEL MASWARI CASPI I who sent the day and night." 22 Time does not allow Mankind the gift of immortality, therefore it would be useless to struggle against the hand of destiny. Thus in classical poetry Time is described as a poison which hastens life towards its fatal end. It is the task of Time to carry out the will of the deity in a blind way. In the eyes of Time human beings are little more than dust: Spring flowers of multi-colours, And my life is changing colours. (1:1) and: O Time, why have you stolen my joy And left only pain and sorrow in its wake? O Time, bring us no more sorrow. (11:5-6) and: Ah! woe is me, Ah what sorrow Time has caused! . Ah! woe is me, my Time has changed! (20:1,5) The place of interment is represented in classical poetry as an empty, cold dwelling- place of eternal darkness. This contrasts with the image of the lifetime dwelling-place, which is warm, secure and joyful. The description of interment clearly dichotomizes the joy of life with the eternal darkness of death. In our collection, however, this dichotomy is not clearly apparent. The interment is mentioned, but in very different contexts, which are as follows: a) the speaker pleads with the grave to watch the beloved: I went to your grave to touch the stones, And I said, O resting place which cradles the beloved! (3:5) or b) the speaker may request that the deceased carry greetings to the family: Come to our village, O woman, come! And if you are approaching the grave Take an oath to give regards to our deceased. (24-5) or c) as a contrast to the joy and security of the deceased's lifetime home: Since trust no longer resides where the beloved does not. (4:22) The house becomes empty, cold and insecure with the loss of the beloved: I came to the home of the beloved And I found it empty and abandoned. (5:7) and: Your death left us without a wall to lean upon, Nor even a ladder. (12:14) or d) lastly, the speaker may ask the grave to bless the deceased: The grave has blessed your interment And you are beloved in the family. (12:6)</page><page sequence="10">'MY BROTHER, VEIN OF MY HEART' 37 As we have seen, these poems centre around the main motifs of weeping and sorrow on the one hand, and powerlessness in the face of destiny on the other. Also we can note that underlying are descriptions of burial and mourning customs which still exist in rural Arab society today, despite the effects of modernization. Oral poetry has carried over the genre of classical poetry in which a dialogue is established between the deceased and the mourner: I went to your grave to touch the stones, And I said: O resting place which cradles the beloved! And he said: Only sister, go now, He who dies can never return. (3:5-6) and O my home, prisoner on a hilltop; O my sons, provide for this woman after me. (1:11) The actual speech in oral tradition is much simpler and folkier. Cultural values are interwoven in this genre more explicitly than in the classical genre. For example, we are told that a brother is responsible for his sister: The brother is responsible for his sister, And towards her he is compassionate. (3:12) A father unites the family and towards it he is merciful: My father who unifies the household, O my father, lay open your house To guests and sad women. O my father, my merciful father. (4:2-3) He is also the family guardian: O my shepherd Who gathers the children! (13:4) There are also references of the old custom of marrying a relative, since Ibn' Ammi means both 'beloved' and 'cousin': O Ibn' 'Ammi who sheltered me! O like bracelets tumbling from my wrist! (13:3) However, one cannot suggest that oral poetry as presented here is a continuation of classical poetry, even though there are motifs and literary devices which are common to both. It seems that the source for both genres was the same: on the one hand a search to express the depths of grief, and on the other to express the religious concepts of the Quran. It is possible to conclude that while oral poetry coined the simplicity of oral transmission, classical poetry developed and broadened literary devices and metaphors. APPENDIX: PERFORMANCE AND INFORMANTS The poems numbered 6 through 12, as well as the revenge poems 21 through 24, were taped in Druze villages in the Golan Heights. The lament for the Sheik al Sultan</page><page sequence="11">38 MISHAEL MASWARI CASPI Basha, no. 6, which was composed by Hasin Khatib, a village schoolteacher, was taped on a memorial day in his honour. Sultan Basha was born March 5, 1891, in a village south of Jabal al Druze. He opposed the Ottoman Empire and struggled for years against the Turks together with Sharif Faisal Hussein (who was later crowned King of Iraq). In 1925 he began his struggle against the French with only a small, poorly equipped army. His wars and his heroic deeds have been recounted from one generation to the next among the Druze. In March 1982 he died at the age of 96. On Sunday, March 28, 1982, the village council of 'A Gar decided to take part in a memorial to honour Sultan Basha. They decided that on this day schools would be given a holiday and a convoy of autos would drive to the grave of Nabi Shuib in K'far Hitin. The memorial services would be held there for all the Druze community in Israel to take part in. On that day, after the memorial services had been completed, the eulogizers began to recite their laments recounting the heroic deeds and righteousness of Sultan Basha. The lament in our collection (No. 6) expresses the sorrow of Druze everywhere; it also describes the wars and the generosity for which Sultan Basha was well-known in his community and the western world alike. This lament conveys the message that since the Sultan had died the East had lost its foundation. Poem 7 is a lament which is recited before placing the corpse in a shroud. During this ceremony friends and family members stand around the body and recite this poem lifie-by-line. The rest of the guests are standing and twirling kerchiefs over their heads. Just before the ceremony, as the body is being washed according to custom, an honourable person of the village eulogizes the qualities of the deceased. Afterwards they usually begin with a lament describing the day of separation. In this particular poem (7:7) the name of the deceased is mentioned; this of course is changed to fit the person for whom it is being recited. Following the funeral the villagers proceed to the home of the bereaved family before taking their leave. A few hours later relatives and neighbours are invited to share all the meals with the family for a period of three days. The mourning period actually lasts for seven days, during which time the family withdraws from all other impending business or responsibilities in order to remain available to guests and well-wishers. The eighth poem is recited while the body is being washed, following a prayer for the deceased. Once again his deeds and devotion are elaborated upon, and then the last line is repeated several times by oral participants. The first informant, Lady Darusha from the village Iksal, is a woman in her sixties. Before coming to this village she lived in 'Ein Mahal. Her two sons died, one at the age of 25 in a car accident, and the other at the age of 23 following a prolonged illness, at which time he had been engaged. The second informant, who also lived in Iksal, was another member of the Darusha family, who at the age of about 55 had witnessed the death of her brother as well as her parents. The senior Darusha had learned the lament from her mother who had eulogized the deceased of the village. She also participated every Thursday in commemorative visits to the cemetery. The junior Darusha remembers her mother reciting these laments in honour of her relatives and family members.</page><page sequence="12">'MY BROTHER, VEIN OF MY HEART' 39 I had difficulty in encouraging the informants to recite in front of me, because I was, of course, an alien and a stranger in their midst. This difficulty was compounded by their own personal grief, in particular the junior informant who was constantly reminded of her brother who had died at the age of 28. The third informant, also in her fifties, lives in an Eastside neighbourhood of Iksal. Her brother had died and left his children under her care; her daughter had also died at the age of 23. She used to listen to old women recite their eulogies, among whom was her aged mother. The first two poems in the collection were recited by the Lady Ikbal, a woman in her seventies. She was born at the beginning of this century in the village Tur'an. She was the only daughter in a family of sons. Her childhood memories were bitterly clouded by recollections of the Turkish regime and the famine of the times. In the early 1920s at the age of 16 she was betrothed to her cousin, a merchant whose only transport was camels, hence his nickname Gamal (meaning camel). When he was away from home she was expected to assume all his duties at home and in the fields. In the evening she had to walk one and a half miles to bring water from the spring. Women gathered there by the spring to recite poems and tell stories, in particular stories about heroes which were well loved. Nearby there were large stones called Banat al-Ein (Daughters of the Spring), which were thought to host female angels who descended at night to sit on them to discuss the village and its dwellers. Even at the present day people still take oaths in the name of these stones. The Lady Ikbal bore four sons and four daughters, the first of whom was born when she was 17 years old. After the establishment of the State of Israel, her husband purchased a truck to transport fertilizer to farmers. When she was 40 years of age her husband died in an automobile accident and she was expected to assume all of his duties, which included education of the young, care of the household, and ploughing the land (which she accomplished with her bare hands and a simple wooden plough). She divided the harvest into three parts: one for the household, one for storage, and one to sell in order to accrue funds for the children's education. Her comments about all this were summarized when she said, 'Now that I see my sons and my great grandsons, the fourth generation with me, I know that I have carried through the will of my husband? The last informant, Mas'ada Abu Gnam, was born in the early 1920s in Magdal, where she studied in a school run by nuns. In 1948 she fled to Lebanon, from Lebanon to Syria, and on to Jordan; she finally returned to settle in Yafia in Israel. She is the mother of nine children and has twenty grandchildren, all of whom live with her today. There were more sources for the laments than the aforementioned informants; however, since some of these poems were taped during actual funerals or memorial services, it was not possible to acquire information about the speakers. NOTES 1. A book is now in preparation for publication. This study was made possible by a grant from the Department of Humanities, University of California, Santa Cruz. The Editor of Folklore much regrets that limitations of space have made it impossible to publish the full texts collected by Dr. Caspi, as had originally been planned. 2. These poems were not translated according to poetic standards of rhyme and rhythm. My priority was to convey the meaning to the reader, though I owe my heartfelt thanks to Ms. Elisa Mishory for embellishing the literal translations with a semblance of poetic quality. 3. Much thanks to 'Aisha Muhammad for suggesting some valuable translation in some of the poems.</page><page sequence="13">40 MISHAEL MASWARI CASPI 4. Imru al-Kais, Dar al-Mu'araf, Cairo, 1908. 5.
