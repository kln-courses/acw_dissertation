<plain_text><page sequence="1">Men, Machines and History. S. LILLEY. (240 pp., 52 figs., 10s 6d. Cobbett Press, London, 1948.) Plough and Pasture. E. CECIL CURWEN. (122 pp., 14 pls., 21 figs., 7s 6d. Cobbett Press, London, 1946.) These two little books, the first a "double volume," are published as a part of a "Past and Present" series, "studies in the history of civilization," under the direction of an editorial board headed by V. Gordon Childe. From Savagery to Civilization by Grahame Clark, Writing and the Alphabet by A. C. Moorhouse, and History by V. Gor- don Childe have also been published in this series. Men, Machines and History by S. Lilley, formerly a Fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge, and on the staff of the University of Birmingham at present, is a history of</page><page sequence="2">548 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [52, 1950 technology. The author touches briefly upon the Neolithic and Paleolithic, but he is primarily concerned with the period since about 3000 B.C. He distinguishes two "in- dustrial revolutions," the first one culminated about 3000 B.C., the second began about A.D. 500 and reached maturity between 1815 and 1918. Tools, machines, motive power, mining, metallurgy, agriculture, transportation, manufacturing, etc., are dealt with functionally and historically. Lilley does not confine himself to purely technological matters, however. He is interested also in the effect of technological advance upon society and, conversely, the influence of social systems upon technological change. His discussion-and graphs-of technological advance and of invention rates are very in- teresting. The story is brought up to the end of World War II and the harnessing of nuclear energy. The volume is generously illustrated with excellent cuts and plates, and contains a good index. Plough and Pasture begins, after a brief discussion of the food quest, with "The Origin of Agriculture." The author employs the rather well-worn anthropomorphic and psychologistic theory of this origin: that somehow, somewhere, someone "hit upon the idea," and agriculture began. This theory actually explains nothing, of course. A con- sideration of cultural development in terms of technology, modes of subsistence, climate and habitat, might prove more valuable. Curwen discusses the most probable places of origin of agriculture, the diffusion of these arts, the technology of farming-reaping, threshing, milling, etc.-and also the origins of stock-breeding. There is almost no treatment of pre-Columbian America, and in the Eastern Hemisphere, the emphasis is upon Europe, and especially upon the Brit- ish Isles. The illustrations are excellent and relevant; there is a good index. Both of these volumes are, in the reviewer's opinion, learned, competent, and well balanced. They are written in a lucid and interesting style, but for the mature reader. They will be useful to anthropologist, historian, and layman alike. LESLIE A.
