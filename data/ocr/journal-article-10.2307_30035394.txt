<plain_text><page sequence="1">Folklore 118 (April 2007): 1-22 RESEARCH ARTICLE The Vanishing Volcanoes: Fragments of Fourteenth-century Icelandic Folklore [1] Oren Falk Abstract The entire corpus of Icelandic Family Sagas contains no express reference to volcanic fires. This article explores the reasons behind this puzzling absence in a genre whose realism is rightly celebrated. I propose to read a unique, oblique reference in Grettis saga as possible evidence of a submerged vernacular theory. Introduction Ransacking medieval literature for the folkloric relics it might contain is hardly a new practice. Like other hunters for trace histories in literary works, folklorists have recovered many impressive monuments-the recent Thesaurus Proverbiorum Medii Aevi (1995-2002), for example, contains some ninety thousand proverbs recorded in various medieval languages and literatures-but have also put their feet down some inevitable methodological rabbit holes. How may one detect truly traditional items, for instance, and distinguish the wisdoms of the many from the wits of individual authors? This problem may be especially acute in a literary tradition that was largely anonymous and that valorised antiquity over innovation; medieval authors would have had plenty of incentive to cloak their original turns of mind as bits of commonplace. [2] Moreover, students of the Middle Ages, folklorists included, are at a disadvantage relative to contemporary field workers when it comes to contextualising findings. Even authentic lore seldom reaches us embedded within more than a fragmentary, haphazardly preserved social context, making its interpretation a rather tall order (see Dundes and Arewa 1975; cf. Dundes 1975b; Harris 1975). Finally, although gaps in the empirical work are inescapable in all regions and periods, it is a safe bet that, when it comes to medieval folklore, whole realms lie not merely unrecovered but unrecoverable. Faced with a lacuna in her knowledge of a culture, a contemporary folklorist may fill in missing data by further field work, or at least fall back on comparing notes with other students of the same culture. What is her medievalist colleague to do, however, when no popular wisdom survives concerning phenomena she might have legitimately expected to generate folklore? Iceland's volcanoes may be a case in point. Perched atop the active mid-Atlantic ridge, this c. sixty-five million years young island rivals Hawaii and the Pacific Rim as one of the world's most active volcanic regions. We have every reason to believe that Iceland saw no less geothermal activity during the Middle Ages than it has in recent centuries. An Irish annal entry for the year 938 (recte 939), for instance, attests that "[t]he sun was of the colour of blood" for a day and a half (Chronicum Scottorum 1866, 203), which has been interpreted as "undoubtedly an ISSN 0015-587X print; 1469-8315 online/07/010001-22; Routledge Journals; Taylor &amp; Francis Â© 2007 The Folklore Society DOI: 10.1080/00155870601096257</page><page sequence="2">2 Oren Falk observation of the plume of the eruption of the volcano Eldgjai in Iceland" (McCarthy and Breen 1997, 17). Archaeologists and geologists have confirmed the deposition of ash layers from medieval eruptions, including the famous "landndm tephra"-distinctive strata of volcanic debris attributed to a major eruption around the year 870, just about the time that Norse migrants were embarking upon the colonisation (landndm, lit. "land taking") of Iceland. "Judging from the thickness and the extent of the ash blanket," one archaeologist remarks, "this eruption lasted for a long time, perhaps several months" (Orri Visteinsson 2000, 164). [3] Although we cannot be sure whether Norse settlers had already arrived at the time of this particular geothermal outburst, the colonisers and inhabitants of Iceland must have witnessed some spectacular volcanic eruptions over the course of the Middle Ages, [4] and, having no prior experiences to compare from Norway, Ireland, or elsewhere in the Viking world, would doubtless have been suitably impressed by them. We would thus expect some medieval volcano lore to have emerged in Iceland. Literary Traces in Landnimab6k: Volcanoes as Aetiological Props Sigur6ur Nordal, one of the most eminent twentieth-century scholars of Iceland's medieval literature, perceived traces of just such a fascination in the literary relics. He cites in evidence the story of the elderly P6rir Grimsson, a member of the pioneer generation: ]6rir was then old and blind, when he came out late one evening and saw that a person, big and ugly, rowed into Kalddr6s ["Cold River mouth"] in an iron rowboat and went up there to that farm which was called i Hripi, and there he dug in the cowshed door. But during the night, earth-fire (jaraeldr) came up there, and then the Borgarhraun ["lava field of the borg"] burned there. The farm was there, where the mount (borg) now stands (Landnadmab6k chap. 68 [S ]; IF 1, 98; cf. chap. 56 [H ], IF 1, 97-9). [5] "[T]he tale of Borgarhraun," Nordal writes, "shows that the first eruptions which the settlers saw excited their imaginations, and the capacity to create mythical tales was not completely dead" (1970-1, 112). Moreover, as Jakob Benediktsson remarks (IF 1, 98 note 2), an iron vessel is a typical vehicle of giants in later Nordic folklore, helping to classify P6rir's visitor as a forerunner of the denizens of latter- day folktales. (P6rir himself had exhibited signs of being a sorcerer in his youth, and had led a charmed life.) Still, perhaps none of the internal features of the tale of Borgarhraun are quite as striking as its external circumstances: the near-unique context in which it occurs, and the paucity of comparable passages outside this context. II6rir's encounter with the volcanic giant is recorded in Landndmab6k ["The Book of Settlements"], a text unusual even by Icelandic standards. First compiled c. 1100 or shortly thereafter, Landndmab6k consists in the main of brief entries describing seriatim some four hundred and thirty land claims, allegedly made by the first settlers of the island, in the period c. 870-930. Landndmab6k is associated with Iceland's most venerable medieval scholar, Ari Porgilsson inn frd6i, "the wise," the father of Icelandic historiography. It has consequently enjoyed immense prestige, and has been regarded as an unimpeachable factual check on Iceland's more freewheeling literary compositions, the famous sagas, whose storylines often seem to expand on</page><page sequence="3">Fragments of Fourteenth-century Icelandic Folklore 3 germinal clues contained in Landndmab6k. Nevertheless, whether the record preserved in Landndmab6k has anything to do with the original settlers, as Nordal seems to believe, must be very much doubted. Not only do two centuries separate its initial writing from the time of settlement, but surviving copies are all much later still, evincing signs of extensive editorial manipulation. [6] In fact, rather than representing the "factual" baseline from which later tradition elaborated its literary conceits, it seems that Landndmab6k may have been retrofitted (in places, at least) to bring it in line with the accounts contained in sagas. Whether it inspired saga literature or emulated it (or, most likely, a bit of both), Landnamab6k obeys a different logic from the sagas. In it, narrative is incidental rather than primary. The settlement record in Landndmab6k runs clockwise, starting with the first colonist's stake at the site of modern-day Reykjavik. Most entries are laconic: they name a settler and his land claim, then describe its boundaries in brief. Typical additions to this minimal formula may include the settler's ancestry or his place of origin, or may trace offspring into the authorial present (the latter presumably in cases where such progeny were prominent in contemporary Icelandic society). Occasionally, however, Landndmab6k waxes narrative, adding piquant vignettes like the following: Helgi inn magri went to Iceland with his wife and children; also with him was Haimundr heljarskinn, his kinsman. ... He spent the first winter at HdmundarstaJir ["Hamundr's Stead"]. They had a bad winter. ... After that Helgi carried aboard his ship everything he owned, but Himundr lived [there] afterwards. Helgi then landed at Galtarhamarr ["Boar's Cliff"]; there he put ashore two swine, and the boar was named Sqlvi. They were found three years later in Sqlvadalr ["SQlvi's Dale"]; there were then seventy pigs altogether (Landndmab6k chap. 218 [S ], IF 1, 250-2; cf. chap. 184 [H], IF 1, 251). Or again: In the spring, Au6r went searching for land [to settle] in BreidafjgrJr ["Broad Fjord"] together with her retainers; they ate breakfast (dggurJr) on the north side of Brei6afjQr6r, where now it's called Dggurdarnes ["Breakfast Headland"]. Afterwards they sailed into the sound between the islands. They landed at that headland, where Au6r lost her comb; she called it Kambsnes ["Comb Headland"]. Au6r took all of Dalalqnd ["the Dales"] in the interior of the fjord, from the Dggurdard ["Breakfast River"] to the Skraumuhlaupsd ["Roaring-Flow River"] (Landndmab6k chaps 97 [S] and 84 [H], IF 1, 139). Such snippets of storytelling only occur as embellishments to the genealogical and tenurial core. Folklore survivals in Landndmab6k are thus not just rare, but firmly subordinated to the text's overriding interest in a systematic accounting for Iceland's real estate. [7] Sometimes they consist of nothing more than throwaway comments made in passing, as in the following volcanic example: Hrafn hafnarlykill was a great viking; he sailed to Iceland and took the land between H61msa and Eyjard, and lived at Dynsk6gar. He foretold a volcanic eruption (eldsuppkvdma, lit. "coming up of fire") and removed his farm to Ligey. His son was Aslkikr aurgo6i, from whom the Ligeyingar ["Ligey Dwellers"] are descended (Landndmab6k chaps 327 [S] and 288 [H], IF 1, 328). The motivation for including such comments and anecdotes is not always obvious, but often it seems straightforward enough. The entry for Hrafn may record an historical eruption or, at least, rationalise a remembered relocation. With</page><page sequence="4">4 Oren Falk Helgi, the compiler seems to have tailored a narrative to make sense of the distribution of existing place-names. In P6rir's case, as in Au6r's, the story accounts neatly for the physical terrain of the locale where it is set. Borg has the primary meaning of "citadel" or "fortified location," but may mean "fortress-like rock formation," such as a volcanic cone, while hraun denotes a lava field that has cooled and hardened. Thus, while it is possible that P6rir's fable preserves a distant (or constructed) memory of a deserted farmstead on the site, it probably offers nothing more than a piece of aetiological fancy. [8] Similar motivation seems to underlie other volcanic notices in Landndmab6k, such as the tale of the magician Lo6mundr, who settles at the foot of Myrdalsj6kull, the great glacier near Iceland's south coast. A massive volcanic fissure simmers beneath Myrdalsj6kull's icecap. Landnimab6k tells of a sudden deluge that emerges from the mountains-doubtless a jikulhlaup, "glacier burst," a flash flood triggered by a sub-glacial eruption-and of Lo6mundr's sorcerous duel with a neighbour, each attempting to reroute the torrent onto the other's land. The outcome of their back-and-forth struggle is the serpentine course of a river flowing between their estates: Jikulsd, "Glacier River," a boundary marker between two of the country's Quarters (Landndmab6k chaps 289 [S ] and 250 [H], IF 1, 304-6). [9] Elsewhere, the early prosperity of the settler Molda-Gnupr is underscored by noting that he "distributed [parts] of his land claim to many men, and it became densely populated there, before earth-fire (jar~eldr) flowed over it, and then they fled west to Hqf6abrekka and erected tent-dwellings in the place called a Tjaldavelli ['at Tent Plain']" (Landndmab6k chap. 329 [S], IF 1, 330; cf. chap. 286 [H], IF 1, 331). As if in compensation for the damages the family has suffered, the bergbui, "mountain denizens", and landvxttir, "spirits of the land", later befriend Gnipr's sons. P6rir, Hrafn, Lo6mundr, and Gnuipr: between them, these four settlers-less than one per cent of the population according to Landnamab6k-more or less exhaust the store of volcanic lore contained in this text. [10] Far from offering full- blown narratives which might affirm that volcanicity "excited [the settlers'] imaginations" or showcase their "capacity to create mythical tales," the occasional pieces in Landndmab6k attest to the keen interest of twelfth-century (and later) compilers in constructing accounts of origins for farmsteads, place-names, and notable topographical features. An eruption could serve this purpose, but no more so than a pair of fecund swine or a stray comb. Rather than the tip of an immense mantle of volcanic folklore, the rare mentions in Landndmab6k appear more like exceptions to a general rule of utter disinterest in volcanic phenomena. The Volcano Vanishes: Stillness in the Sagas We should, perhaps, not be too surprised to find so few geothermal anecdotes here; we may simply be looking in the wrong place. Given Landndmab6k's by-and- large non-narrative nature and the confinement of its attention to real-estate issues, its near-silence on incendiary matters may not be all that surprising. Perhaps, then, one should look for folklore where it is to be expected, in the narratively affluent sagas. Beginning in the late twelfth century and continuing well past the fourteenth, Icelanders produced a great wealth of saga literature. Modern scholarship distinguishes several key saga genres, among them</page><page sequence="5">Fragments of Fourteenth-century Icelandic Folklore 5 Contemporary Sagas (including both the secular compilation known collectively as Sturlunga saga and the hagiographically oriented Bishops' Sagas) and Legendary Sagas (both the native fornaldarsigur, "Sagas of Olden Days," and the translated or imitative riddarasdgur, "Chivalric Sagas"). Nowadays, the best known and most widely read are the Family Sagas (or Islendingasigur, "Sagas of Icelanders"), a grouping that includes such undisputed masterpieces as Njdls saga, Gisla saga, and Laxdcela saga. Both the intellectual justifications for these genre classifications and their practical application have come under much critical scrutiny. Still, they seem, on balance, to retain greater heuristic utility than they pose difficulties. [11] Astonishingly, attestations of volcanoes are even more rare in the sagas than in Landndmab6k. A handful occur in some of the Bishops' Sagas. An eruption is reported on the occasion of Iceland's conversion to Christianity in the year 999; the pagans take it as an omen of divine anger, prompting one of their adversaries to quip: "what were the gods angry about when the lava-field on which we now stand was burning?" (Kristni saga chap. 12; IF 15 part 2, 33). [12] Another late- medieval saga, its eye clearly on the foreign readership who were to rule on its protagonist's sanctity, surveys Iceland's natural environment, noting: There are ... mountains in this land, which emit awful fire with the most violent hurling of stones, so that the crack and crash are heard throughout the country, as far in every direction, people say, as fourteen dozen [miles] straight sailing out from every headland. Such great darkness can follow downwind from this terror that, on midsummer at midday, one cannot make out one's [own] hand. Following such portents it has happened that, a league of sea to the south of the land, a huge mountain has come up on account of the fire-flowing in the very ocean, and another has sunk down in the same place, which had first come up through the same cause. There are plenty of gushing hot springs and sulphur there (Saga Guamundar Arasonar, H6la-biskups, eptir Arngrim db6ta chap. 2, in Biskupa sigur vol. 2, 5). [13] In both examples, the mention of subterranean fires appears to be tied directly to these religious sagas' soteriological and hagiographic agendas, in one case pulling the lava out from under pagan assertions against Christianity, in the other painting a hellish landscape against which the beatific protagonist's actions will acquire meaning. [14] As we turn to the Family Sagas, however, the silence surrounding volcanic fires deepens to a deafening emptiness. The mystery of this reticence only grows if we consider the one apparent exception, a passage in Grettis saga that (at first sight) might seem to point unequivocally towards a volcano: It happened one evening, extremely late, when Grettir was about to go home, that he saw a great fire erupt (hann sd eld mikinn gj6sa upp) on the headland which was below Au6unn's farmstead. Grettir asked about it, what novelty it might be (Grettis saga chap. 18; IF 7, 57). [15] What clearer attestation might one ask for? The very word choice (eld[r] ... gj6sa, "fire ... surging") seems to prefigure the Modern Icelandic noun eldgos, "eruption" (lit. "fire-surge"), not otherwise attested in Old Norse. But, on second look, the reference turns out not to be to a volcano after all. Grettir learns that the flames he sees indicate the location of a burial mound, whose occupant, not surprisingly, is not quite dead-although he will be soon, after Grettir and his sword have paid him a visit. Despite the suggestive language, this may hardly</page><page sequence="6">6 Oren Falk count as geothermal activity. Fires and jack-o'-lanterns play on grave mounds elsewhere in the sagas, [16] and, in any case, the event recounted here takes place not in volatile Iceland but in geologically inert Norway. The entire corpus of Family Sagas, thirteen thick volumes'-worth in the standard modern editions, seems to know nothing of lava and ash plumes. How to account for such uninterrupted ignorance? The Family Sagas, rightly celebrated for their gritty realism and insightful portraits of human character, show little insight when it comes to portrayals of the natural world. In fact, they are downright tight-lipped, disregarding not just subterranean combustion but natural calamities in general. Few wildfires or famines ravage the Icelandic countryside; harsh winters and disease seldom decimate the population; landslides and floods are mercifully rare; and ravenous polar bears, borne south on breakaway ice floes, almost unheard of. The utter absence of volcanic eruptions must thus be weighed against only four avalanches or landslides, for example, half as many again mentions of sea ice, and not quite a third of that tally ursine incidents [17]-a meagre haul, in all, which does little to disrupt the impression that saga Iceland must have been a serene paradise, a sort of medieval Tahiti. So long as one were careful to steer clear of one's neighbours, that is. Staying out of one's neighbours' (and thus out of harm's) way was no mean feat, of course. Medieval Icelanders appear to have had a peculiar genius for killing each other, and tales of their violence exercise the sagas greatly, to the exclusion of much else. So, for example, as Astrid Ogilvie and Gisli Pillsson argue, the sagas only bother to attend to weather when it is in the service of literary effects (metaphor, mood-setting, characterisation, and so on); meteorological extremes, in particular, typically appear as gerningaveJr, "performative weather," the work of witches kneading the natural environment to ill effect. [18] Much the same is true of descriptions of natural phenomena more generally. A narrative purpose always drives their occurrence in the text, and those at the more catastrophic end of the spectrum are almost invariably presented as the product of human or human-like agency. This point can be illustrated using reports of disease, for instance. Here, we see a girl who loses her mind after sneaking a peek at an undead corpse, and "she never let up her screaming and twitching the whole night, up to daybreak; then she dies" (HeiJarviga saga chap. 9, IF 3, 234). There, some scurvy sailors state matter-of-factly that "they were afflicted by sorcery" (Porsteins Pdttr tjaldsthexings chap. 2, IF 13, 430-1). And elsewhere again, a woman about to succumb to a plague has a vision of herself and others being led off in Bergmannresque fashion by a whip- brandishing angel of death (Eiriks saga rauda chap. 6, IF 4, 418 [S ]; cf. 215 [H]). [19] A first general principle we may thus formulate for the natural environment in the sagas, and for natural hazards in particular, is that they are seldom (if ever) natural. Narrative structure, not nature, determines their existence within the text (which is itself hardly surprising, of course; cf. Barthes 1968). A second principle states that those deaths we would classify as accidental or of natural causes are, in the sagas, typically the work of anthropomorphic agents: ogres, magicians, revenants and the like. We might compare the bewildering provision in the Icelandic law codes, known collectively as Grigds, which proscribes randomness: "It is decreed that there shall be no accidents" (Grdgds S92 [K] 1852 part 1, 166; cf. S296 [S 1, 1879, 334). [20] The law's sweeping rejection is presumably only meant to</page><page sequence="7">Fragments of Fourteenth-century Icelandic Folklore 7 deny coincidence as an explanatory (and exculpatory) mechanism in human affairs. By refusing to recognise happenstance altogether, saga narrative goes the legislation one better, outlawing chance equally from the social and the extra- social spheres. Focusing now on geological calamities specifically, we may note that movements of the earth do conform to these same general principles. Only two or three passages in all of the Family Sagas attest to earthquakes; of these, only one locates a seismic event in Iceland itself (Hariar saga chap. 15, IF 13, 41-3). [21] (This, too, is noteworthy, as the boundaries between the real and the fantastic tend to be more porous in far-off lands. As a working hypothesis for our third rule of thumb, we may suggest that [un]natural calamities in the sagas tend to occur abroad or involve foreigners.) In the single episode set in Iceland, a saga hero hunts down a family of Hebridean sorcerers; he and his men take precautions to ward off their victims' dying curses. Three magicians go to their graves without too much incident, but the fourth, Stigandi, is only captured some time later: now they take a sack and pull it over [Stigandi's] head. ... There was a rip in the sack, and Stigandi catches sight of the hillside across [from them]: it was a lovely piece of ground there and covered with grass; but thereupon it was just as if a whirlwind hit it. The earth was overturned, so that grass never grew there afterwards. It is now called di Brennu ["At the Burning"] there. Afterwards they stone Stigandi to death (Laxdcela saga chap. 38, IF 5, 109). The saga chooses to present a lurching of the landscape as Stigandi's failed attempt to strike back at those about to kill him. Rather than Man at the mercy of forces beyond his control, we witness nature convulsing under the lash of imperious human will. In a similar passage where a witch finds her plans stymied, she laments her thwarted "inten[tion] to overturn the entire lay of the land," counter-factually menacing her attackers: "and you'd all have gone stark raving mad with terror!"-before she expires (Vatnsdaela saga chap. 26, IF 8, 70. Cf. Landnamab6k chap. 180 [S ], IF 1, 222). [22] Such accounts of seismic tremors fit in seamlessly with the (admittedly few) saga passages about other forms of natural disasters. Why, then, do volcanic fires not receive the same treatment? Why would lava, pumice and ash-fall not appear in saga texts as raw materials for witches and evil-doers to draw on? A satisfactory solution is beyond the scope of this article, [23] but I believe we may begin to perceive the contours of an answer by considering comparative evidence from two other genres: poetry and ecclesiastical writings. Vernacular Verse and Learned Lore: Making Sense of Volcanoes Gestures towards the inclusion of volcanic activity in the generalised supernatural arsenal may be found in verse. Nordal long ago posited "Vqluspa"-our earliest source for the tradition of Ragnargk, the "Twilight of the Gods"-as a distinctively Icelandic apocalypse. Proposing a late-tenth-century date for its composition, he detected in the poem allusions to hot springs (stanza 35), flames shooting sky-high from the ground (stanza 57), and ash-clouds veiling the face of the sun (stanza 41). His readings have been widely, although not universally, accepted. [24] A more clear-cut description of volcanic unrest appears in "Hallmundarkviba," a singsong twelve-stanza poem, tentatively dated to the thirteenth century (IF 13, ccv, ccxi).</page><page sequence="8">8 Oren Falk Here, we hear how "glaciers blaze ... coal-black crags burst; the curse of wood [that is, fire] unleashes storms; a marvellous mud begins to flow from the ground," and so on (Bergbua ~Pttr, "Hallmundarkvi6a" stanzas 5-6, IF 13, 445-6). [25] Furthermore, the song is put into the mouth of a cave-dwelling giant; two men taking shelter from foul weather "heard singing, very awful and hugely loud," and evidently autobiographical: "I step from mountain to mountain ... I have a solitary home in the lava-field" (Bergbua ]Pattr, "Hallmundarkvi6a" stanzas 7 and 12, IF 13, 442, 446 and 449). If "Vqluspa" arguably appropriates volcanicity to its extreme vision of how the world comes apart at the seams, "Hallmundarkvi6a" normalises geological upheaval, ascribing it to seemingly everyday giantish conduct. Unlike the usual procedure in prose sagas, however, neither poem insists on viewing the disruption of the landscape as an exercise of supernaturally endowed will. Whereas Stigandi had to turn his malevolent gaze deliberately on a patch of fair earth in order to wither it, the giant Hallmundr seems to roil the cordillera simply by hiking through it. As a fourth heuristic principle-qualifying, to some extent, the volitional implications of the second general rule articulated above-we might thus propose that medieval Icelanders classified the causes of seismic and volcanic activity as lying just beyond the margins of workaday sensory reality, alongside trolls, ghouls, and dragons, but that they recognised it need not be intentional. Icelanders undoubtedly also had available to them a body of learned writings accounting for volcanic activity in terms scientific or theological-in the Middle Ages, often difficult to disentangle. Patristic writings had already portrayed volcanoes as gateways to hell, a notion made famous, for instance, in Pope Gregory the Great's Dialogues, where the departed soul of the Arian Theodoric is cast into a seething Sicilian caldera by the righteous souls of two erstwhile victims of his persecutions. [26] By the twelfth century at the latest, this tradition had migrated to Iceland's volcanoes, as reported for example in the English Chronicon de Lanercost: At that time William, Bishop of Orkney, a noble man and a lover of learning, was on a visit in England at Hartlepool; he related many wonders concerning the islands subjected to Norway, some of which I reproduce here, that they may be remembered. He told how in Iceland the sea at a certain place bums for the space of a mile, leaving behind it black and foul soot. Elsewhere, fire regularly erupts out of the ground, every seventh or fifth year, and without warning torches villages and all it finds in its path; nor may it be extinguished or turned back except with holy water blessed by the hand of a priest. And what is more wondrous, he said that, in that fire, loud shrieks can be heard of souls tormented there (Chronicon de Lanercost s.a. 1275; 1839, 97). [27] The imported learned tradition was thus compatible with the principles we have discerned in the indigenous literature, both prosaic and poetic. It, too, saw geothermal fires as tangible manifestations of a reality thought to lie beyond the reach of everyday sensory experience, a reality that was neither natural nor unmotivated. And it placed this reality squarely within the moral framework of Christian cosmology. As the author of the thirteenth-century Konungs skuggsja ["King's Mirror"] put it, "now no one may deny it who can see it with his own eyes; because such things are told us concerning the torments of hell as one may now see on that island which is called Iceland" (Konungs skuggsid 1945, 20). [28]</page><page sequence="9">Fragments of Fourteenth-century Icelandic Folklore 9 The prevalence of such a moralistic conception of subterranean fires (the volcanic verses of "VQluspa" and "Hallmundarkvi6a" may well be thought to represent a naturalising, or even paganising, adaptation of this notion) seems to offer us one clue towards making sense of the silence of the Family Sagas on such matters. Unlike much contemporary literature elsewhere (and, for that matter, the Bishops' Sagas produced in Iceland around the same period), the Family Sagas consistently shy away from thumping their audience over the heads with blunt moralising. Their authors may thus have considered volcanoes too vulgar, too imbued with a self-evident and unavoidable Christian ideology, to be narratively useful. It appears that, when it came to volcanoes, Church teachings coalesced so fully with the general Icelandic view of the natural world, as emplotted and anthropomorphic, that no room could be found within the secular sagas for volcanicity. The Lore that Dare not Speak its Name But if Hallmundr and Stigandi represent one muted strand of Icelandic popular tradition-a dominant strand, when it comes to types of natural hazard less problematic than subterranean fires-here and there we may detect some few traces of another, fainter tradition. Its clearest enunciation is in the passage in Grettis saga from which I quoted earlier. As already noted, this episode is set in Norway, far from Iceland's volcanoes, and the source of the flames Grettir had seen erupting from the headland turns out to be a burial mound housing one of the restless dead. But before dismissing the passage as a geothermal red herring, let us consider its denouement. When Grettir enquires about what he has witnessed ("Grettir asked ... what novelty it might be"), his Norwegian interlocutor, Au6unn, at first "told him that there was no urgency to know it." Since Au6unn ducks the question, Grettir submits his own gloss for the fire: "It would be declared", said Grettir, "if such a thing were to be seen in our country, that it's treasure [that] is burning there" ("Pat myndi mxlt," sagai Grettir, "ef slikt sxisk a varu landi, at Par brynni affr"; Grettis saga chap. 18, IF 7, 57). Two distinct levels of information are worth noting here, first the content of Grettir's comment, then its packaging. The content looks straightforward enough: Grettir suggests that fire spurting from the ground indexes buried treasure. As noted earlier, such a statement reflects a recurring motif in the sagas and elsewhere (see the examples listed in note 16). What is more, within the subcreated universe of the saga, Grettir is literally correct. Yet, strictly speaking, the text presents his hitting the jackpot as no more than a stroke of good luck. Grettir, in fact, makes no claim to know the provenance of flames in Norway, such as the ones he now beholds; he only attests to common opinion regarding comparable phenomena back home: ef slikt saisk d vdru landi, "if such a thing were to be seen in our country." We, the modern readers of the saga, know of course the true source of such fires in Grettir's homeland. We may thus conclude that he gives voice to a vernacular theory of volcanic origins. The process of deduction would go something like this: Grettir states that a fire of this sort, if it occurred in Iceland, would be taken to signal buried treasure; in Iceland, such fires are in fact the</page><page sequence="10">10 Oren Falk product of geothermal activity; thus Icelanders must have imagined volcanoes to be burial mounds in flames. But the coincidence whereby Grettir's homespun wisdom proves applicable to interpreting Norwegian flames cautions against such a reading. Yes, were a flesh- and-blood Icelander to offer this gloss, we might be justified in filing his predictive mechanism under the rubric "token-condition belief" or "sign superstition" (Forster 1968, 121; Dundes 1975a, 91-2; see also Dundes 1989). Were he, moreover, to strike gold, we would doubtless pronounce him uncannily lucky: whereas some weather superstitions seem to rest on a solid bedrock of folk empiricism, a belief linking grave goods and magma has little scientific foundation to commend it. We might compare Norwegian adventurer Helge Ingstad's discovery of Norse ruins at L'Anse-aux-Meadows, Newfoundland, in 1960, which furnished the first concrete, extra-textual evidence of Leifr Eiriksson's discovery of America. Ingstad had located the site by following saga directions to Vinland, prompting many to hail his accomplishment as a vindication of the sagas' historical authenticity. Given the calculated vagueness, literary embellishment and outright contradic- tions in the sagas' descriptions of Vinland, however, it is more appropriate to see Ingstad's triumph as a lucky accident, effected in spite of, not because of, his superstitious clinging to the trustworthiness of his sources. Unlike Ingstad, Grettir is a literary character; his unexpectedly accurate guess is predicated not on a face-value belief about the way the world really works, but on narrative requirements. In preparation for having his hero break into a mound and fight for buried treasure, the saga author wittily dresses up an idiomatic clich6 as reliable divination. As in any number of traditional riddles or Far Side cartoons, the narrative depends for its effectiveness on short-circuiting the literal and the metaphorical (see Georges and Dundes 1975). [29] Confirmation that the fantastic improbability of Grettir's divining gold from fire stems from a literal (mis)understanding of a particular kind of metaphor, a proverb, comes from Grettir's own lips. He prefaces the substance of his exegesis with an appeal to folk wisdom: Pat myndi melt ... a viru landi, "It would be declared ... in our country." Folklorists of earlier generations saw such a framing device as a sufficient identifying mark announcing the presence of a proverb (for example Cnyrim 1888, 6-8; Pfeffer 1954). More recently, however, Hofmeister has warned against accepting such introductory formulae at face value: "even when the author introduces some proverb-like statement or another with a phrase ... still a residue of uncertainty lingers, whether contemporary collective usage is thereby established for the few such 'extraordinary' sayings or whether such a claim isn't merely advanced-not to say, dissimulated with rhetorical skill-by the author." But even he acknowledges their utility as "especially strong undergirding" of the proposition that an associated phrase is probably proverbial (Hofmeister 1992, 44 and 54). [30] True, proverbial tags are suspiciously ubiquitous in the Family Sagas, often marking alleged traditional sayings that are nowhere else recorded; Grettis saga, in particular, abounds in aphoristic-sounding turns of phrase, many of them unique to this saga. Orn61fur Thorsson, who has studied them in detail, counts "about eighty proverbs and one hundred and fifty idioms" altogether (Orn61fur Thorsson 1994, 79, note 1). [31] Given the fragmentary nature of our sources, we have no way of telling whether such maxims did indeed circulate widely and simply left the merest wisp of a trace in</page><page sequence="11">Fragments of Fourteenth-century Icelandic Folklore 11 the manuscript record, or whether saga authors enjoyed making up their own sententious little verbal contraptions. Still, we may attempt to gauge the authenticity of alleged traditional expressions by attending carefully to both the alleged proverb's immediate textual micro-context and by cross-referencing our findings with independent attestations elsewhere in the cultural macro-context. Within the proximate micro-context, Grettir's circumstances and his precise wording enhance his credibility as tradition bearer. At this point in the plot, Grettir is a young man, away from home for the first time and only recently arrived in Norway. Upon witnessing a familiar phenomenon in his new environment, for which he has not yet learned a local label, he volunteers his native terminology instead. How many species of American flora and fauna, to pick an obvious set of examples-chestnuts, elks, robins, and so on-owe their names to mislabelling in this way by European travellers and immigrants? The literary character Grettir here performs a credible impression of a displaced native informant, testifying to the lore of the homeland he has left behind. Considered as a textual artefact, too, Grettir seems believable in his claim of access to tradition. It is difficult to imagine what reaction the author might have desired to elicit from his intended Icelandic audience if not nods of recognition and approval-"indeed, this is just what we say in our country"-an effect that would only have been achieved by putting into Grettir's mouth words that could have been spoken by any actual Icelander in conversation with a Norwegian. Whether saga authors routinely engaged in fabrication of proverbs or not, the local textual dynamics seem to support the hypothesis that here, at least, Grettir speaks from genuine Icelandic experience. We have, moreover, supporting evidence from at least two other so-called "post-classical" Family Sagas, [32] where buried treasure seems to give off a magma-like glow, to suggest that the saga author did not just invent a catchphrase to suit his fancy. Among the cartoonish adventures recounted in the first part of PorskfirJinga saga (also called Gull-P6ris saga) is the successful raiding of a dragons' lair in Norway. IP6rir, the protagonist, and his companions enter the dragons' cave bearing torches, "until a gust blew against them and the flames were then extinguished." Calling on his guardian spirit, however, P 6rir summons a supernatural light into the cave, allowing the men to proceed as far as the sleeping dragons, "and then there was no shortage of light which shone from the dragons and the gold on which they lay." In the ensuing battle, "highly poisonous fire splashed from [the dragons'] mouths," and an effusion of blood and venom from one beast's wound hits a man in the face, killing him instantly, while very nearly disabling another who is merely splattered (Porskfirdinga saga chap. 4, IF 13, 187-8). Nothing in this episode points explicitly at volcanic activity, but neither does it seem far-fetched (especially when informed by the clue in Grettis saga) to see the glowing dragons and their hoard as a stylised depiction of a volcanic crevice, and the devastating poisonous fire and blood as euphemisms for lava. An even more outlandish passage occurs in Bar1ar saga, where, upon arrival in the wastelands of Greenland, Gestr, the protagonist in the second half of the saga, sees "near some cliffs ... two poles of gold and, tied to them, a kettle full of gold." Gestr sends two servants for the gold, "but when they came forth to it and intended to take it, the earth tore open beneath their feet, and it swallowed them, so that the earth closed over their heads, and everything disappeared, the kettle</page><page sequence="12">12 Oren Falk and the poles" (Bdrdar saga chap. 18, IF 13, 163). The saga does not specify how the items Gestr sees are arranged, but it seems plausible to suppose that we are meant to imagine something like a cauldron suspended from a bipod [33] over a domestic cooking fire-except that this particular pot serves to cook not meat but precious metal. And again, it does not seem like much of a stretch to identify the bubbling gold with a pool of idly simmering lava, ready to swallow any who are foolhardy enough to approach. [34] If it is conceded that these descriptions of earth-bound treasure refer to a vernacular geothermal theory, the reasons behind saga reticence may begin to come into clearer focus. It is not simply that the unrelenting Christian gloss of such fires offended saga authors' secular sensibilities. Other natural disasters, after all, were equally apt to be presented as the instruments of demons and manifestations of hell on earth. [35] But while both saga authors and Church teachings could accommodate witches or trolls, above-ground agents of malfeasance (who might also ultimately be minions or victims of Satan), they seem to have had greater difficulty harmonising the attribution of subterranean fires to the glow of hidden gold, on the one hand, with claims that the souls of the dead might be heard shrieking in an underground rotisserie, on the other. [36] It may not be mere coincidence that both Icelandic law and sagas are also expressly, consistently hostile to the idea of committing treasure to the ground. [37] Whereas too great a conformity with ecclesiastical lore may have prevented one strand of vernacular geological thinking from finding voice in the sagas, inability to conform to Church teachings at all may have excluded another. It is always tempting to imagine a jackpot just beyond the horizon (or at least over the rim of the next crater, as the case may be), but this folk tradition never quite got off the ground as a saga narrative motif. Whether as superstition or as proverb, such folklore would certainly have served useful social functions. Besides helping to explain to Icelanders the natural environment they saw all around them, a literal belief of this sort would have helped dissuade both treasure- hunters and would-be hoarders (if they did not relish the thought of turning into dragons or undead corpses themselves) from going through with their sordid plans. As metaphor, meanwhile, the equation of molten rock with burning gold would have had an even wider potential amplitude, whose full range, now lost to us, we can only imagine. In a land where coins were a rarity-medieval Icelanders used vadmal, locally produced homespun wool, as currency-but fissures and eruptions a frequent reality, what lessons might Icelanders have drawn from juxtaposing fabulous imagined wealth with observable flowing fires? I hesitate to guess, and perhaps we will never know. We must count ourselves lucky to know even the little we do about these obscure fragments of fourteenth-century Icelandic folklore. Proverbs are often defined as words out of context (for example, Forster 1968, 42-51). In the present case, it took the speaker's literally stepping out of his native context to grant us a glimpse of proverbial volcanic lore. Had Grettir not travelled to Norway, we would probably not even know of its existence. Acknowledgements This paper began its life as a footnote in my dissertation (Falk 2002, 187, note 110).

Notes [1] Except as otherwise noted, all translations are mine. Icelandic personal and place names are only translated occasionally, as required by the discussion. Scandinavian names have been alphabetised in accordance with Icelandic convention: patronyms have not been transposed; 6 and d appear together, as do long and short vowels; 1, ae, and 6/0 follow z. Icelanders' names simplified in foreign publications have been restored to their native forms, with the exception of Gu6brandur Vigfiisson (see Cleasby and Vigfusson 1957). [2] Thus Taylor, for example, sensibly remarks (with reference to some extravagant blasons populaires): "It is difficult to know to what extent such epigrams were popular. Many, I suspect, are no more than semi-literary witticisms which enjoyed only a short life" (1931,102). A similar caution underlies Buc's assault on the category of medieval ritual (2001, esp. chaps 1-4). [3] The landndm tephra was first described by Sigur6ur IP6rarinsson (1944, 55 and passim); see also Gr6nvold et al. (1995, 150-3). [4] Information is sparse for the early period, but Falk (2002, 227-8 [Table 5.1]) enumerates five or six eruptions c. 870-1104 (to which must be added at least one more, Katla c. 920; Dugmore et al. 2000, 25), and approximately thirty more by the end of the fifteenth century. [5] It may be significant that the common noun hrip denotes a loosely woven, sieve-like basket, and the verb at hripa means "to leak" or flow profusely (Cleasby and Vigfusson 1957, s.v.). [6] Jakob Benediktsson describes the manuscript tradition in detail (iF 1, 1-cvi). My references are to two of five main manuscripts that survived into modem times: Sturlub6k [S ], compiled c. 1275-80, and Hauksb6k [H], from the first decade of the fourteenth century. [7] Landnaimab6k's purpose and ideology have been much debated. I follow Sveinbj6m Rafnsson (1974, 166-203). Adolf Fri6riksson and Orri VWsteinsson (2003) propose a divergent, but no less sceptical, view. [8] Compare J6hannes Askelsson (1955); he notes volcanic rock from an eruption in historical times superimposed over the older, pre-landndm lava deposits at the site. For borg, see Ordbog over det norrane prosasprog (1989-), s.v.; for hraun, see Cleasby and Vigfusson (1957), s.v. Other place-name aetiologies cited above are probably also folk etymologies: Galtarhamarr may mean "hogback-shaped crag" (compare Cleasby and Vigfusson 1957, sub ggltr), DQgurjarnes probably means "the headland over which the sun is at breakfast time," and Kambsnes likely describes a headland topped by a sharp, serrated ridge (Franzen 1964, 56 and 23).</page><page sequence="14">14 Oren Falk [9] Compare Grove (1988, 29): "[T]he long outlet glacier in the south west of Myrdalsj6kull, S6lheimaj6kull ... is drained by one of the most dangerous rivers in Iceland, known as the J6kulsA ' S6lheimasandi. It has another name, FRililaekur, which means stinking river, attributable to the smell of hydrogen sulphide emanating from it." [10] One other episode (Landndmab6k chap. 279 [H], IF 1, 323) has been interpreted as alluding to a jdkulhlaup (]Iorvaldur Thoroddsen 1905, 236), but this reading is extremely speculative. Elsewhere, mention of a farm site "where there is now a field of burnt lava" (Landndmab6k chap. 302 [H], IF 1, 345) apparently refers to old basalt exposed through soil erosion rather than to a recent flow; see Sigur6ur I6rarinsson (1977, 669-70). [11] Many excellent introductions to saga literature are available nowadays; Clover and Lindow (2005) is perhaps the most accessible. For disputes over genre classification, see L6nnroth (1975), Harris (1975), and Andersson (1975). [12] As Cleasby and Vigfusson dryly remark (1957, sub hraun): "The whole of Icel[and] may be said to be a burnt-out lava field." Kristni saga is thought to have been written in the second quarter of the thirteenth century (IF 15 part 1, cliv). [13] "Dau eru fj Ull ... pess lands, er 6r ser verpa aegiligum eldi me6 grimmasta grj6tkasti, sva at pat brak ok bresti heyrir um allt landit, sva vitt sem menn kalla fj6rtain tylftir umbergis at sigla r'ttlei6i fyrir hvert nes; kann lessi 6gn at fylgja sva mikit myrkr forvi6ris, at um hisumar um mi6degi ser eigi handa grein. Pat fylgir Pessum fidaomum, at i sjalfu hafinu, viku sjafar su6r undan landinu, hefir upp komit af eldsganginum st6rt fjall, en annat s6kk ni6r i sta6inn, Pat er upp kom i fyrstu me6 sbmu grein. Keldur vellandi ok brennustein fair Par in6g." This mid- fourteenth-century saga by abbot Amgrimr Brandsson, originally perhaps in Latin, was part of an ultimately unsuccessful campaign to canonise Gu6mundr Arason, bishop of the northern Icelandic see of H61lar in the early thirteenth century. [14] In a similar vein, compare St Porlikr's miraculous healing of a badly burned horse that had been carelessly ridden into a geothermal area (jarahitar, "earth-heat"; Porldks saga A chaps 33- 53, IF 16, 90; jarlhiti, an infrequent word, occurs also in Grettis saga chap. 61, IF 7, 199). [15] Grettis saga has traditionally been dated to the early fourteenth century (IF 7, lxviii-lxx). Its earliest manuscripts, however, are from the last quarter of the fifteenth century, and the saga's most recent editor suggests it may be not much older than these, although he tends to place its composition shortly before 1400 (Omrn6lfur Thorsson 1994, xxxvii-xxxix). [16] See, for example, Njals saga chap. 78 (IF 12, 193); Egils saga chap. 85 (IF 2, 297-8); PorskfirJinga saga chap. 3 (IF 13, 183); Hervarar saga ok Heifreks konungs chap. 4 (in Fornaldar s6gur Nordurlanda vol. 2, 14-23); and possibly also Hr6mundar saga Gripssonar chap. 4 (in Fornaldar s6gur NorJurlanda vol. 2, 410-11). See also Boberg (1966, N532). The same phenomenon is known in later Icelandic folklore as mdlmeldur, "metal-fire," or vafurlogi, "flickering flame" (J6n Amason 1954-61, vol. 1, 266-9; vol. 3, 221-2, 349, and 351-2; vol. 4, 43). Analogues occur in continental Scandinavian folklore (for example, Kristensen 1892-1901, vol. 3, 419-25 and 453) and elsewhere throughout the world (Thompson 1955-58, N532 and N564). [17] Not counting occurrences in Landnamab6k, I find in the Family Sagas six mentions of icebergs in Icelandic waters (Eyrbyggja saga chaps 57 and 61, IF 4, 158 and 165; Laxdcela saga chap. 66, IF 5, 196-7; F6stbrce6ra saga chaps 4-5, IF 6, 136-9; Vatnsdcela saga chap. 15, IF 8, 42; B"drar saga chap. 5, IF 13, 114; see also Landnaimab6k chap. 5, IF 1, 38-9), four mentions of skridur-"land-," "rock-," or "snow-slides"-(Hrafnkels saga chap. 1, iF 11, 97-8 [ = Landndmab6k chaps 283 (S) and 244 (H), IF 1, 299]; Eiriks saga rauda chap. 2, IF 4, 197-8 [H] and 405 [S ]; Gisla saga chap. 18, IF 6, 59-60; Vatnsdcla saga chap. 36, IF 8, 96; and cf.

[18] See Ogilvie and Gisli Palsson (2006). The inspired translation of gerningavefr is theirs. [19] Compare also Eyrbyggja saga chaps 51-4 (IF 4,140-50); Grcenlendinga pdttr chap. 2 (IF 4, 277-8); Grettis saga chaps 79-82 (IF 7, 251-61); HarJar saga chap. 15 (IF 13, 40); and Fl6amanna saga chap. 22 (IF 13, 284-5). [20] "Pat er mxlt. at engi scolo ver6a va6a verc." Gragds, the laws presumed to have been in effect in medieval Iceland prior to its incorporation into the Norwegian realm in the 1260s, are known principally from two lavish mid-thirteenth-century manuscripts, Sta~arh6lsb6k [S] and Konungsb6k [K]. Both manuscripts probably postdate, or nearly so, the abolition of the laws they contain (if, indeed, these were ever in effect). See Fix (1993) and, on the provision against accidents, Miller (1990, 61-8). [21] This tells how two of the saga's protagonists break into an undead king's mound in Sweden; to protect himself, the mound-dweller causes a tremor and blows out their torches. Bdrdar saga chap. 21 (IF 13, 169) locates a somewhat similar event in a rather fairytale Greenland. [22] See also the effects on the landscape of a duel between two shape-shifters in Landndmab6k: "It was as if the earth had been overturned" (chaps 350 [S] and 309 [H], IF 1, 356). [23] A more detailed treatment of this issue by the author is in progress. [24] I follow Nordal's stanza numbering (1984, 72-3, 81-2, and 110-11); for his dating and interpretation, see also Nordal (1970-1, 106 and 111-12; 1978-9, 115 and 122-3). Sigur6ur DI6rarinsson tentatively endorses Nordal's readings (1968, 21-2), and Dronke echoes them (1997, 63, 140 and 151); contrast, however, Hermann Palsson (1996, 33-5). Like the description of cosmic calamity in "Vgluspa," the thirteenth-century Villsunga saga's account of Brynhildr's flame-wall in chap. 27 may draw on Icelandic familiarity with volcanicity. See also Sigur6r's first sighting of Brynhildr's abode in chap. 20 (in Fornaldar s6gur Nordurlanda vol. 1, 176 and 156). [25] Gu6mundur Finnbogason compares these verses with first-hand accounts of various Katla eruptions, arguing that "it is entirely unlikely that anyone might describe a volcanic eruption in a glacier so well as is done in Hallmundarkvi6a, other than someone who had himself been eye- and ear-witness to such an event" (1935, 172; cf. 173-4). [26] See Gregory's Dialogi Book 4 chap. 31.2-4 (Gr6goire le grand 1978-80, vol. 3, 104-6); cf. Tertullian's De Paenitentia chap. 12:1-4 (1954, vol. 1, 339). The (possibly twelfth-century) ON translation of the Dialogues seems to have been avidly read in Iceland (Boyer 1993; Wolf 2001, 266-9). For the relevant passage, see Book 4 chap. 30 (Unger 1877, vol. 1, 245). [27] "Per idem tempus perhendinavit in Anglia apud Hertlepol Orchadiae episcopus Willelmus, vir honestus et litterarum amator, qui multa miranda de insulis retulit Norwagiae subjectis, quorum aliqua hic insero memoriae causa. Dixit quod in Yslandia aliquo loco ardet mare spatio unius miliaris, et relinquit post se scoriam nigram et sordidam. Alibi erumpit ignis e terra in certo tempore, septennio vel quinquennio, ac ex inopinato comburit villas et omnia reperta, nec potest extingui aut fugari, nisi per aquam benedictam manu sacerdotali consecratam. Quodque mirabilius est, dixit quod audiri possunt in illo igne sensibiles vagitus animarum ibidem tortarum." The identification of Iceland's volcanoes with the fires of hell, first attested in the Liber miraculorum (c. 1178-80) of Herbert of Clairvaux, earlier abbot of Mores, and later archbishop in Sardinia (Sigur6ur P6rarinsson 1952; 1968, 27-8), seems to have originated in a Danish Cistercian context (Einar Mir J6nsson 1997, 253-7). Compare also the ON translation of Honorius Augustodunensis's Elucidarius Book 3 chaps. 13-14 (1989, 122-3). [28] "Enn nu mi eingi dyliast vid sA er siA mi firi augum sier. firi kui at slijkir hlutir eru oss sagdir fri pijslum heluijtis sem nu m~ siA j keiri ey er ijsland heitir." Konungs skuggsjd (also entitled in the manuscripts Speculum regale) is a didactic text, probably written in Norway in the 1250s (Holm-</page><page sequence="16">16 Oren Falk Olsen 1993). Despite its title, it contains more practical advice for courtiers and members of the urban elite than for royalty. [29] See, for example, a bovine holiday snapshot captioned "The Holsteins visit the Grand Canyon," or a cowboy standing over a fallen body, peppering it with trivia questions ("OK, stranger ... What's the circumference of the Earth? Who wrote 'The Odyssey' and 'The Iliad'? ... What's the average rainfall of the Amazon Basin?"), who is reprimanded by a bystander: "Bart, you fool! You can't shoot first and ask questions later!" (Larson 1989, 150 and 240). [30] Compare Hofmeister (1995, 90-2 and 493). Hofmeister also sidesteps the insoluble problem of demarcating genre boundaries between proverbs proper and other types of pithy sayings ("Das alte Problem der Ziehung von Gattungsgrenzen zwischen Sprichwdrtern, geflUigelten Worten, Maximen, Gemeinplitzen, Sentenzen etc. verliert ... seine Schiirfe"; 1992, 54). I borrow from Hofmeister the term "proverbial micro-context" ("sprichwortartige Mikrokon- text"), although I use it in a different manner than does he. [31] He notes further that thirty proverbs and twenty-six idioms are put into Grettir's own mouth in direct speech (Orn61fur Thorsson 1994, 79, note 2). I have not been able to consult Orn61fur's MA dissertation, OrJ af orJi: hefJ og nymxli i Grettlu (Reykjavik: Namsritger6 [M.A.] vi6 Hsk61la Islands, 1993); presumably, this is what Richard L. Harris refers to in noting that "at Hask61i Islands there is a thesis by Orn61lfur Thorsson devoted to [the proverbs of Grettis saga ]"; see his online Concordance to the Proverbs and Proverbial Materials in the Old Icelandic Sagas, sub Grettis saga, available from (http://www.usask.ca/english/icelanders/ proverbs_GRS.html). [32] On this problematic genre classification, see Cardew (2004). The two sagas discussed below are, in their present forms, fourteenth century (iF 13, xcviii-xcix and cxxx-cxxxi). [33] Both archaeological and literary evidence attest to cooking in pots suspended over fires; see, for example, F6stbrceara saga chap. 23 (IF 6, 245-6), and kettle finds in Graham-Campbell (1980, 199-200 [Figs. 44-5]). Suspending a kettle from a tripod makes much better sense, of course, and a third pole would have helped strengthen my proposed reading of the scenario. Of thirteen manuscripts I have been able to consult (available from (http://saga.library.comell. edu/saganet/), all seventeenth-century or later, and only four employed by the editors of the IF critical edition), nine have tvxr or a similar verbal form, but four use Roman numerals, ij. We may perhaps imagine an original third minim to have been lost in copying. [34] Compare also cognate episodes involving giants' and dragons' treasure hoards in Yngvars saga viJfdrla chaps 5, 6 and 11 (in Fornaldar stigur Nordurlanda vol. 2, 435-6, 442 and 454-5). [35] For (super)natural forces Christianised through an interpretation as heathen or demonic power, see, for example, the account in Kristni saga chap. 8 (IF 15 part 2, 19) and Njdls saga chap. 101 (IF 12, 259) of the narrow escape the missionary Pangbrandr has from a sinkhole (which Nordal associates with a jiikulhlaup; see Nordal 1928, endorsed by Sigurour P6rarinsson 1968, 21). [36] Hugo von Trimberg had greater success at such harmonisation; see his Der Renner (c. 1300) 11. 5045-7: "Swelch schaz begraben ist in der erden, / Der sol dem endekriste werden / Swenne er kumt, als6 hoere ich sagen" [Such treasure as is buried in the earth, it shall belong to the Antichrist when he comes, so I have heard said] (1970, vol. 1, 209). Note the concluding proverbial tag. [37] See, for example, Grdgds S171 [K] (1852 part 2, 75); Egils saga chaps 58 and 85 (IF 2,174 and 297-8); Eirfks saga rauda chap. 5 (IF 4, 213 [H] and 416 [S ]); Grettis saga chap. 18 (iF 7, 60); Bandamanna saga chaps 10 and 12 (IF 7, 352 and 361); Vatnsdala saga chap. 28 (IF 8, 75); Porsteins Jattr tjaldstedings chap. 2 (IF 13, 431). Antipathy to the burial of treasure may be due to the pagan associations of this practice, if Snorri's mythography can be trusted on this point;</page><page sequence="17">Fragments of Fourteenth-century Icelandic Folklore 17 see Snorri Sturluson's Ynglinga saga chap. 8 (in Heimskringla, IF 26, 20; compare Matthias P6r6arson 1928, 109-10).
