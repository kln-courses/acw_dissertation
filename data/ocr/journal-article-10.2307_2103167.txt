<plain_text><page sequence="1">RUSSELL'S QUEST FOR OBJECTIVITY The endless variety of opinion on any topic that may be proposed for discussion affords the basis of a widespread conviction of subjec- tivity in human efforts at knowledge. Since the days of the Greek Sophists and Skeptics despair of escape from solipsism has been a recognized tradition in the history of thought. Where one believes such escape has been effected a challenge to show how it has been effected is immediate. Every attempt to state the nature of objective truth and the method whereby it is attained possesses a central appeal to the student of the problem of knowledge. Every proposed analysis of the nature of truth exposes itself at once to a cross-examination to determine whether the presuppositions upon which it rests are themselves acceptable beyond question. WN'hen Mr. Russell, therefore, states afresh his own concep- tion of truth the temptation to examine it carefully in order to see whether it can establish itself as universally satisfying becomes an irresistible temptation. This is the problem undertaken here; not to establish a preconceived thesis regarding either Russell's position or the nature of truth. The intention is to see what is Russell's approach to the problem, and whether his method of stating his position is more satisfactory than those already classic in the field of epistemology. The problem is broached by these words of Russell: "When the behaviorist observes the doings of animals, and decides whether these show knowledge or error, he is not thinking of himself as an animal, but as an at least hypothetically inerrant recorder of what actually happens." "By omitting the fact that he-an organism like any other-is observing, he gives a false air of objectivity to the results of his observation. As soon as we remember the possible fallibility of the observer, we have introduced the serpent into the behaviorist's paradise. The serpent whispers doubts and has no difficulty in quoting scientific scripture for the purpose.' The philosopher is, of course, the diabolic serpent in the paradise of common sense, of insufficiently reflective science, and even of philo- sophical systems. His diabolism sets in when he becomes hypercritical, turning his attention upon himself and applying his theory to itself. The man of common sense, and the empirical scientist, are aware of no diffi- culties in the relating of one observed term in experience to another. But when the relator himself becomes one of the terms in question to be 1. B. Russell, An Inquiry into Meaning and Truth, p. 14.</page><page sequence="2">RUSSELL'S QUEST FOR OBJECTIVITY 377 related to other terms, complications arise. Here he must be at once plaintiff, defendant and presiding judge, a complex part not easy to play. So when Mlar. Russell, or any other philosopher, sets out to inquire into meaning and truth, we wonder whether he occupies some position of special privilege to which the ordinary philosopher has not attained; and we wonder further by what method he raised himself to this privileged height. Is he not circumscribed like the rest of us by the limitations of the human situation, so that what he savs is merely the expression of his own individual opinion, without objective validity and without weight for any one other than himself ? Is not Mr. Russell the measure of all things-for MVlr. Russell, but not for me? He himself suggests his ego- centric predicament when he says: "All theory of knowledge must start -from 'What do I know?' not from 'What does mankind know?' For how can I tell what mankind knows? Only by (a)personal observation of what it says in the books it has written, and (b) weighing the evi- dence in favor of the view that what is said in the books is true."2 But let us not go too fast. There are crucial assumptions lurking in their own diabolic way even in this assertion; for while asserting that I must begin with myself it assumes that already I have been able to tran- scend my limitations; I have been able to establish the existence of "mankind" and of the "books" it has written. In other words, it assumes that already I have been able to establish the existence of other minds and of the physical world. And to the philosopher the first question of interest is: How does this establishment occur? Mr. C. F. Kettering recently included in a list of twenty-five unsolved problems of the pres- ent age this question: "How does the mind work?" If we just knew the answer to this question we might proceed with more rapid success to the answer to two dozen more. And in this analysis of the workings of mind, one of the basic aspects would be: how does one escape from the isolation of subjective impression to the objectivity of real fact? Let no one say, why bring up that old problem; for Mr. Russell has himself brought it up by his own discussion. Nor can it be dismissed in such words as those used by WVindelband fifty years ago: "It is a meta- physical sport which must be left to the taste of the individual: for the solipsist refutes himself by beginning to prove his doctrine to others.", There is appropriateness still in Bradley's remark.4 "some metaphysi- cians have shown unwillingness to look this problem in the face." The importance of the question, in Bradley's judgment, was indicated by his further statement: "Since we all believe in a world beyond us, and are 2. Ibid., p. 179. 3.

Any view which will not explain and also justify, an attitude essential to human nature, must surely be condemned." It is not enough to hold that self-transcendence occurs. Our scientific curiosity wishes to determine how it occurs; we want to know the "particular go" of the thing. II In the proper scrutiny of this problem of attainment of objectivity it is necessary to proceed in due order, putting first things first. One must determine the right starting point, and understand and correctly apply the necessary method of advance. As already suggested, Mr. Russell insists that all knowledge must begin with the question: WVhat do I know?. The ego-centric position is the inevitable beginning. "WVhat reason, if anyz, have I for believing in the existence of other people ?"6 "There is a tendency-not confined to Neurath and Hempel. but prevalent in much modern philosophy-to forget the arguments of Descartes and Berkeley. It may be that these arguments can be refuted, though, as regards our present question, I do not believe that they can be. But in any case they are too weighty to be ignored. In the present connection, the point is that v1yi knowledge as to matters of fact must be based upon viy perceptive experiences, through which alone I can ascer- tain what is received as public knowledge" (pp. 179-180). "This applies. in particular, to what is to be found in books." "But what do I know? (I) What I see when I look at them. (2) What I hear when others read them aloud. (3) What I see when others quote them in print. (4) What I see when I compare two copies of the same book. Hence, I pass, by elaborate and doubtful inferences, to public knowledge" (p. i8o). We have already noted that he has attained public knowledge in passing to the fact that others read and quote books. Again he says: "Neurath is making an attempt to secure publicity in data, but by mistake (through appeal to recollection of words) has arrived at one of the most subjec- tive forms of knowledge" (p. 183). When Russell himself rejects Berkeley's doctrine it is only because it is not in accord with the present rules of the game of interpretation (p. 273). "Scientific scripture in its most canonical form is embodied in physics (including physiology). Physics assures us that the occurrences which we call 'perceiving ob- jects' are at the end of a long causal chain which starts from the objects, and are not likely to resemble the objects except, at best, in certain very 5. Ibid. 6. B. Russell, op. cit., p. 167.</page><page sequence="4">RUSSELL'S QUEST FOR OBJECTIVITY 379 abstract ways." "The observer. when he seems to himself to be observ- ing a stone, is really, if physics is to be believed, observing the effects of the stone upon himself," and "physics assures us that the greenness of grass, the hardness of stones, and the coldness of snow, are not the greenness, hardness, and coldness that we know in our own experience but something very different." "Thus science seems to be at war with itself: when it most means to be objective, it finds itself plunged into subjectivity against its will." "So the behaviorist, when lhe thinks he is recording observations about the outer world, is really recording obser- vations about what is happening in him" (pp. i'-'3). "Every empirical proposition is based upon one or more sensible occurrences that were noticed when they occurred, or immediately after, While they still formed part of the specious present" (p. 6i)? "W4Ae must not say 'this is a cat,' but 'this is a percept such as we associate with cats,' or 'this is a cat-percept.' This phrase in turn can be replaced by 'I am cat-perceptive,' which asserts a state of myself, and is true on exactly the same occasions as those on which I am tempted (rashly) to say 'this is a cat,' and on which I am justified in saying 'this is a cat-percept.' What we directly know when we say 'this is a cat' is a state of ourselves, like being hot" (p. I42). According to Russell's view, "We may distinguish four assemblages of events: (i) those that I experience, (2) those in which I believe pn the basis of testimony, (3) all those ever experienced by human beings, (4) those assumed in physics. Of these I know empirically that portion of (i) that I now perceive or remember, from these I can arrive at my future or forgotten experiences by assuming induction. I can arrive at (2) by means of analogy, if I assume that speech or writing which I hear or see 'means' what it would if I spoke or wrote it. Given this assumption I can by induction arrive at (3). But howT about (4) ?" (p. 38I). It is to be noted that (i) is accepted as most certain; (2) and (3) are provisional; (4) is quite problematic. "I find in almost all philosophers a great unwillingness to face this question": (i.e., how do I think of things that I cannot experience?) (P. 272; cf. also p. 274, f.). "AVe thus arrive at the moment-ary perception as the least question- able thing in our experience, and as therefore the criterion and touch- stone of all other certainties and psetudo-certainties" (p. i89). "Any word that I can understand has a meaning derived from iry experience" (p. 368). "I start from sentences about particular occurrences, such as 'this is red,' 'that is bright,' 'I now am hot' " (p. 390). "My perceptual whole</page><page sequence="5">380 PHILOSOPHY AND PHEN-OMIENOLOGICAL RESEARCH is, from the standpoint of physics, inside my head as a physical object" (p. 428). With these statements Russell sets clearly the inevitable starting point of an exact theory of knowledge, and indicates where its most difficult problem lies,-v'iz., in the escape from subjectivity and solipsism to objectivity and super-individual fact. Every one of us is in the position of the behaviorist mentioned above. It is such a view that induces doubts, and leads us to a critical scrutiny of knowledge, going back once more to the persistent problem: How do we know? How much do we really know? And finally: How valid is Russell's theory of truth itself? HIt Having begun thus with my individual self, the first problem is to describe the process whereby I transcend myself and come to the belief, if not the knowledge, that there is reality beyond myself, in the form of other conscious human beings, and of non-human physical things. The question is: How does a "knowing mind" transcend itself ? (a) The answer must be given in accord with rigorous logic. And in disagreement with the logical positivists. Russell holds that logic does afford a basis for metaphysical doctrines (pp. 22, 23). "A great deal of metaphysics is involved in the belief that I can make assertions, suich as 'vou are hot' which go beyond mv experience" (p. 291). How far my mind can reach beyond the immediate sensory present is the crucial question upon which will depend the acceptance of such a realistic meta- physics as Russell holds, and in terms of which he defines his concep- tion of truth. We may, with him, begin without committing ourselves to a partic- ular theory of the nature of reality, by assuming merely that "experi- ences" are a sub-class of "facts" (p. 365). This leaves open the ques- tion how far the range of "facts" goes beyond that of "experiences." If this extent proves after all to be null then we shall accept a form of idealism; otherwise, realism. But at least we state the relation of the two terms-"experience" and "fact"-in a wAay which involves no initial begging of the question. The issue from this point of view becomes the one of determining the degree. if any. of the extent of this possible superior range of "fact" beyond "experience," and how one can come to know it. (b) The most elemental form of self-transcendence is to be found in the way in which language functions. Every assertion "expresses" a state of the speaker, and also intends to "indicate" a fact. Out of the</page><page sequence="6">RUSSELL'S QUEST FOR OBJECTIVITY 38i former develops the whole psychological process of belief; out of the second the epistemological question of truth and falsity (p. 23). In the process of "indicating," there is a reaching out beyond the immediate sense presentation. One must recognize principles of undemonstrative inference which are difficult to reconcile with mere empiricism (pp. 24, i90). Perceptive experience consists of a sensory core: but this is sup- plemented by expectations, which become habits (p. 5I). Referring to other of his statements, we find that the "significance" of a proposition transcends my own personal experience, reaching out beyond it to that which is in some sense not immediately present (p. 368) ; and "empirical" knowledge requires other premises in addition to pure perceptive propositions (p. i90). Mere empiricism, as a theory of knowledge, is self-refuting. For it involves some general proposition about the dependence upon experience; and any such proposition, if true, must involve the consequence that it cannot itself be "empirically" known (p. 207). The hypothesis that light waves and sound waves are mere auxiliary fictions in the causal interconnection of my percepts is as tenable as the realistic hypothesis if percepts are the sole ground of empirical knowledge (p. 375, f.). NIo one believes merely in the events which he experiences: hence, there are really no empiricists in the strict sense (p. 382, f.). Whenever onie sentence is said to increase or dimin- ish the probability of another sentence, this must be in virtue of some principle of interconnection which is believed on evidence other than that of perception (pp. 398, 399). (c) But when we say there is some kind of transcendence con- stantly involved in empirical knowledge. we have not specified the exact nature of this transcendence. That it is a form of inference we have noted, and is often asserted by Russell. WVhen, instead of saying "I see a canoid patch of color," I say "I see a dog," "statements of this latter kind always involve in their justification, some element of inference" (p. 23; cf. p. 98). The view of the Hegelians, which denies the distinc- tion between "data" and "inference," is not wholly false, but it over- states its case (p. 154). To me, the percepts of people who assert they have seen the Straits of Magellan are inferences, not premises (p. 170). The assertion, "you are hot," involves an inference from my experience of my body and its attendant feelings to the relation of your body to your feelings (p. 377, f.). The transition from subjective experience of seeing and hearing to physical space is a form of inference, though not of the sort performed by common sense (p. 379). "If we are to hold, as many philosophers do, that a factual premise may be rejected on the basis of later evidence, this must be because we accept a priori non- demonstrative forms of inference, x-hich experience can neither con-</page><page sequence="7">382 PHILOSOPHY AN-D PHENO MEN-OLOGICAL RESEARCH firm nor confute, but which see regard, in some circumstances, as more certain than the evidences of the senses" (p. 398, f.). Thus, inference is involved, but inference of what specific type? (d) At times he raises the question whether this inference is some kind of induction. For one thing, the meaning of a word involves many condensed inductions, not consciously or deliberately made (p. 98, f.). But this is not the question at issue here. The question is how I come to believe that there is an existing cat indicated bv the meaning which the word "cat" expresses. "'Whenever I think I see a cat I have the perceptive experience of 'seing a cat' even if, on this occasion, no physical cat is present" (p. 15I). And right there lies the problem of objectivity, for if on occasions when there is no physical cat 1 still can have the experience of "seeing a cat," how do I determine the occasions on which my experience is a true one, and wAhen a false? He says, "\Vhen I have 'seen a cat,' there has usually been a cat to be seen, for if this had not been the case I should not have acquired the habits which I now have. We have therefore inductive grounds for holding (on a common sense basis) that wAhen I 'see a cat" there probably is a cat" (P. I51). All of wAhich is weak at the crucial point, because it has to fall back upon conmmton SCUiSC, from which he often departs, and the only reason he does not depart from it here is apparently that he has a thesis to maintain in advance. Any theory so sophisticated as Russell's is confessing an embarrassment When it deserts its whole method of subtle analysis and falls back upon common sense to establish a point. "Induction allows us to infer that a pattern of light, which, we will suppose, looks like a cat, probably proceeds from a region in which the other properties of cats are also present." "Broadly speaking. a percep- tive experience is a dogmatic belief in what physics and induction show to be probable; it is wrong in its dogmatism, but tsitally right in its cobn- tent" (p. I;,2; cf. also p. 29I). In similar manner we read that it is induction which gives us our beliefs about what happened on Manhattan Island on Januarv Ist, in the year I A. D. (p. 347, f.). "Inductions in the physical sciences are always phrased in realist terms; i.e., they suppose that what you observe can happen without your observation. and does happen in suitable cir- cumstances " (P. 351 f.). Which says that the physicist assumes he has already solved the problem of objectivity, but does not tell how and on what grounds. "Perhaps all non-demonstrative inferences can be re- duced to induction" (p. 380). Yet, in spite of this, there remain problems. The argument is not wholly convincing even to Russell. "A and B have been frequently con- joined in experience; therefore, when I see A, I expect B. This raises</page><page sequence="8">RUSSELL'S QUEST FOR OBJECTIVITY 383 the problem of induction, but not our present problem, which is that of transcending my experience" (p. 292). "In a scientific induction two events, A and B, are observed to occur together or in close temporal succession, but no physical expectation is generated, or if it is, it is regarded as irrelevant" (p. 315). This he says in connection with the distinction between the psychology of expectation and the logic of in- duction. "We have to consider whether induction and analogy can ever make it probable that there are unperceived events" (p. 360). "Is it possible for an inductive inference to be not merely unverified, but un- verifiable? This is the case of sound waves, which can never be per- ceived. Do these require some further principle than induction?" (p. 380). The weakness of induction as a mean's of solving the meta-physical and epistemological question lies in the fact that its whole procedure can be carried out within the experience of a single individual. What it deals with fundamentally is merely generalization and expectation. (e) If induction in general does not serve to suggest a way of transcending all experience, what aspect of experience will? Perhaps causality will do it. If by familiarity with causal operations within experience we can be led to regard the whole field of perceptive experi- ence as the "effect" term of a super-empirical realm, we may be able to find a way to refer beyond experience on the basis of causality. "Physics," he has already said, "assures us that the occurrences which we call 'perceiving objects' are at the end of a long causal chain which starts from the objects" (p. 14). "When we have the experience which we call 'seeing a cat,' there is an antecedent causal chain ana- logous to that which we considered in connection with 'seeing the sun.' When the experience is veridical, this causal chain, at a certain point in its backward course, reaches a cat. (I am still dogmatically assuming the truth of physics). But it is clear that if. at any point in this chain, the event (light-waves, agitation of rods and cones, or disturbances of optic nerve or brain) which usually has its origin in a cat, can be pro- duced otherwise, we shall have exactly the experience called 'seeing a cat,' without any cat being there. I must beg the reader to remember that I am talking science, not philosophy" (p. I50). "An 'object' is etymologically something thrown up in my way; if I run into a post in the dark, I am persuaded that I perceive an 'object,' and do not merely have a self-centered experience. This is the view implied in Dr. John- son's refutation of Berkeley" (p. 144). On the authority of Lenin, also, matter is the cause of sensations (p. 145). "The realist is driven to a Ding-an-sich as the cause of his visual percepts, and to the statement that this Ding-aiL'sich can exist at times when it is not causing visual</page><page sequence="9">384 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOAMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH percepts" (p. 275 f.). The experiences of two people have causal con- nection with each other. "I suppose that I am seeing you. In that case, 'you' is related to an event in you, viz., the visual appearance of your body to me. This has a causal and also a perspective relation to an event in you, viz., the visual appearance of your body to you" (p. 288). "When I say, 'the sun is hot,' interpreted as in physics, I travel further from experience, since 'hot' now means, not 'hotness,' which I have experienced, but 'cause of hotness,' which I have not experienced" (p. 290). "Part, at least, of the hypothesis involved (that there is a physical space) is that a cause and its effect, if separated by a finite time-interval. must be connected by a continuous intermediate causal chain. There is evidently a causal relation between seeing and hearing an explosion; when I am on the spot they are simultaneous; we therefore assume that, when they are not simultaneous, there has been a series of intermediate occurrences, which, however, were not perceived, and are therefore not in perceptive space" (p. 379). "The physical and physiological causa- tion of percepts compels us to regard them as all in one region, which must be inside of the percipient's head (not, of course, inside his or anyone else's percept of his head)" (p. 427). From these numerous causal statements it might seem that the problem of objectivity is solved, and the method whereby escape is effected from subjective impression to objective fact is definitely indi- cated. Then we should no more need to be content with the assertion that everybody believes in other persons and in the physical world; i.e., nobody accepts solipsism. Now we should know why they do not. But the situation is not so final, after all. Still there are problems remain- ing. Russell slips in a qualification on the concept of causality here and there. In the first place, there are two sub-kinds of causality: one, that which connects the object with the present impression of that object; the other, that which connects a past impression with a present recollec- tion of it (p. 140). This raises a question whether the two relations are the same, and how they can be known to be the same. Secondly: "Sup- pose we say: the sensation of red has one sort of cause, and that of green has another. 'We are then, when we try to pass from sensation to physics, attributing hypothetical predicates to hypothetical subjects" (p. 276). Again, "We have spoken of the assumptions as 'causal,' but without investigating what we mean by this word, which, I am con- vinced, is capable of an important diversity of meanings" (p. 291). Also, "The notion that a percept is 'of' a physical object turns out to be inexact, causal, and unreliable" (p. 427). His final and most surprising qualification is given in the statement, "The belief from which we most</page><page sequence="10">RUSSELL'S QUEST FOR OBJECTIVITY 385 naturally arrive at matter is, I think, the belief that in sensation we are passive. WN e experience sights and sounds, broadly speaking, involun- tarily. BNow the conception of 'cause'- however loath we may be to admit this fact-is derived from the conception of 'will.' Since Zve do not will what we see and hear, the cause of what wve see and hear must, it is felt, be external to us. This is an argument which only has to be stated in order to be rejected" (p. 293 f.). Just why it is so obviously wrong is not clear at all. (f) As a substitute formulation of the correlation of experience with the fact it means to indicate, he puts his statements in terms of logical relation, rather than causal connection. Having rejected passivity in a causal relation as the ground of recognizing objectivity through experience, he finds himself in a dis- tinct difficulty. Some method of statement of the relation is necessary in order to make his definition of truth significant. He has stated it in terms of correspondence (p. 362 f.). But correspondence has two forms: (i) the correspondence of a proposition to experience, and (2) the correspondence of a basic proposition to a "fact" even if unknown. The former can be followed out within the realm of experience; but the latter faces the problem of transcendence again. Ultimately, he holds, the correspondence in question involves some sort of similarity. "What we want to know is the resemblance (italics Russell's), if any, between the sun and 'seeing the sun'; for it is only in so far as there is resemblance that the latter can be a source of knowl- edge concerning the former. Adhering to our uncritical acceptance of science, we find that there are important resemblances between the sun and 'seeing the sun.' To begin with, the sun looks round and is round. This resemblance, it is true, is not so close as it sounds, for the sun looks round in my visual space and is round in physical space. Never- theless, the resemblance can be clearly stated. The definition of round- ness is the same in one space as in another, and certain relations - notably, contiguity-are common to physical and visual space" (p. 146). He admits: "There are, however, limitations to the similarities of the visual and astronomical sun. During a partial eclipse, the sun looks like the crescent moon, but is just as round as at other times" (p. 147). And he asks: "WVhen I touch a tree, what resemblances are there be- tween my sensation of touch and the part of the tree with which I falsely imagine my finger to be in contact ?" His answer is: "There are qualities of touch-hard and soft, rough and smooth-which correspond to qualities of the object touched. By feeling round an object, we can infer its shape, just as we can by seeing it; the 'real' shape inferred is the same for a man who sees the object and for a blind man who only</page><page sequence="11">386 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH feels it. And when I say 'the same,' I mean strictly the same: there is no difference between the physical space inferred from touch and that from sight, except as regards degrees of nicety. In addition to shape, there is location." "It is unnecessary to consider hearing, smell, and taste, since exactly similar considerations apply." "The above account rests upon a dogmatic acceptance of physics and physiology" (p. 148). This correspondence, constituted essentially by some kind of simi- larity, is the heart of his theory of truth (p. 362), and applies primarily to basic propositions, i.e., propositions which appear credible independ- ently of any argument in their favor (p. I7), and are caused, as imme- diately as possible, by perceptive experiences (p. I71). At one point (p. 365), the word "corresponds" has the alternative "expresses." "A 'basic' sentence is one that 'corresponds' to an 'experience,' or 'expresses' an experience" (p. 365). He also says in this statement the term "fact" may be substituted for "experience" (p. 367). That it is difficult to define correspondence is conceded in the words: "The logical theory in- volves us in metaphysics, and has difficulties (not insuperable) in de- fining the correspondence which it requires for the definition of 'truth'" (p. 368). (g) There remains the still more exact and technical statement of this relation of "expression" in logical terms. This involves three steps: the analysis of the meaning of "unexperienced" objects, the explana- tion of the meaning of the assertion that they exist, and the determina- tion of cases of this existence. The first question is directly put at a number of points, "What is there on the side of expression correspond- ing to this indication of something outside my experience? or in old- fashioned language, how do I think of things that I cannot experience ?" (P. 272). "How can I think of things that I cannot experience? Take (say) the statement: 'Sound is due to waves in the air.' What meaning can such a statement have? Does this necessarily only mean: 'If I suppose sound to be due to waves in air, I shall be able to develop a theory connecting the sounds that I hear with other experiences'? Or is it capable of meaning, as it seems to do, that there are events in air that I do not experience?" (p. 274). "Logic assumes that, if I understand a statement '0a,' I can under- stand the statement 'there is an x such that Ox.' Then given two under- standable statements, Oa, Va, I can understand 'there is an x such that Ox and ix.' But it may happen that, in my experience, Ox and px are never conjoined. In that case, in understanding 'there is an x such that Ox and px,' I am uniderstaniding something outside experience" (p. 275). He declares: "The sensations caused by external objects are events like any others, and have not the characteristics we associate with the word</page><page sequence="12">RUSSELL'S QUEST FOR OBJECTIVITY 38- 'cognition.' This fact has to be brought into relation with the common sense view that there are occurrences called perceiving. in which we become aware of objects" (p. 149). He does not state what are the characteristics we associate with the word "cognition"; but we must commend the attempt he makes to consider carefully what it is to under- stand the nature of an object which is taken as existing. and his equally careful statement of what is meant bv understanding that it exists inde- pendently of any observer. "This question turns upon the interpreta- tion of existential propositions" (p. 274). If I have reason to believe there is an x such that dx and vx, I have reason to believe that there are things which I do not experience (p. 275). "If 'there is an x such that Ox' is not an analytical consequence of one or more propositions expressing judgments of perception, is there any significance in the statement 'I believe that there is an x such that Ox'?" (p. 275). "Let us take some simple example, such as 'my study exists when no one is in it.' The naive realist interprets this as: 'what I see when in my study exists when I do not see it.' To avoid the word exist, we can translate this into: 'there are events in my experience which are simultaneous with what I see when in my study, but not with my seeing it' " (p. 275). "There is a one-one relation S which correlates classes of physical events with shades of color, and which is such that, if a is a shade of color, whenever a patch whose color is a exists, a physical event of the class correlated with a exists at roughly the same time" (p. 277). With this the relation between the perceptive experience and the object it intends to indicate has turned into a temporal simultaneity. Compres- ence he refers to elsewhere (p. 285). If we take the case in which A says that B is hot we have, if this is true. an occurrence experienced by B but not by A, in virtue of which what A says is true. "We interpret this assertion by A as meaning: 'there is a hotness related to my percept of B's body as my hotness, when I am hot, is related to my percept of my body.' " "The relation involved may be called 'compresence'" (p. 285). But clearly, mere compresence is not enough to describe the rela- tion between a perceptive experience and its object, because many ob- jects may be compresent with the percept, yet to which it intends no reference. The understanding of B's experience by A is explained by means of analogy. "Consider what makes me think that you have experiences that I do not have. The argument is obviously analogical, but is hard to state precisely" (P. 292). "The argument, formally, is as follows: In a large class of cases I know that events of kind B are preceded by events of kind A; in another large class of cases, I do not knowe whether this is the case or not. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, I</page><page sequence="13">388 PHILOSOPHY ANXD PHENO-MEN-OLOGICAL RESEARCH assume that it is the case" (p. 292). "The above is the argument for the existence of other 'minds'" (p. 292). "The simplest form of the argument for the physical world is the argument that 'things' exist when I do not see them" (p. 292). Which is no argument at all, but a mere restatement of the belief ! Analogy cannot be used in establishing the existence of the physical world independently of 1'1y perceiving it: for that would commit us to Idealism, and this must not be accepted. It is, as in the case of Berkeley, "Against the rules of the game!" (p. 273). Interesting it is, moreover, to know that for Russell a method is against the rules of the game,,only when it leads to a conclusion one does not wish to accept! Why does one want to believe in an independent physical realm? The function of the belief in the physical world is to simplify the statement of causal laws, "not only of those that cannot be verified, but also of those that can" (p. 294). It is held necessary in our own per- sonal experience in order that habits of expectation may be acquired (p. i-i). "Certainly 'experience' depends upon our having a more or less stable body. A 'spirit' in the etymological sense-i.e., a gas in motion (sic!)-would not have the physical stability required for ex- perience or the formation of habits" (p. i5i f.). "Physics allows us to infer that light of certain frequencies is proceeding from the object to our eyes" (p. I52). This he says in spite of the additional statement: "In any significant sentence, the constants must all be derived from experience. Space-time order in physics, for example, is derived from space-time order among percepts" (p. 300). It must he accepted if things are to be regarded as existing when we do not see them (p. 277), and must be accepted as the basis of the fulfillment or disappointment of expectations (p. 149). IV B)ut just what success has Russell really achieved in establishing the existence of an objective realm, of other minds, and of physical ol)jects? Note some of the things he says about this realm. At certain moments his attitude is, "It is clear that klnowing is a relation of the organism to something else or to a part of itself" (p. I I ). The clarity of the situation does not seem entirely obvious, however, in view of the difficulty of stating the doctrine exactly. Apparent clarity is gained by overlookilng the central problem and assuming that it has been answered. "In this inquiry \\Vc' assume that the world is such as it appears in science. without, for the present, asking ourselves whether this assumption is justified" (P. 146). "Adhering, to our uncritical accel)tance of science, we find that there are important resemblances</page><page sequence="14">RUSSELL'S QUEST FOR OBJECTIVITY 389 between the sun and 'seeing the sun' " (p. 1417). "The above account rests upon a dogmatic acceptance of physics an(l physiology' (p. I48). "I am assuming that I can know that von are hot, anld asking what is the simplest possible account of such knowledge, supposing it to exist" (p. 28I). Sometimes the whole doctrine is Put 011 a baIsis 01f common sense. "\Ve have therefore inductive grounds for holding (()n a comnmon-sense basis) that when I 'see a cat' there probably is a cat" (p .,). "If we assert that it is meaningless to say that there are events which no one experiences, we cannot avoid conflicting grossly with scientific common. sense-just as grossly, in fact. as if we were solipsists" (p. 376). Yet, on the other hand, common sense is repeatedly rejected. "The judgments that common sense bases upon perception, Such as, 'there is a dog,' usually go beyond the present datum, and may therefore be refuted by subsequent evidence" (p. 173). "Unsophisticated common sense supposes that the book, just as it appears when seen, is there all the time. This we know to be false" (p. 293). Naive realism is "a doctrine which must be held to be false in fact, but not logically impos- sible" (p. 355). "Common sense believes in naive realism, and makes no distinction between physical and l)erceptional space. Many philoso- phers, although they have realized that naive realism is untenable, nevertheless retain some opinions logically connected with it, more par- ticularly in this matter of different kinds of space" (p. 379). Just when is a philosopher to accept common sense, and when not? He has said that in perception "we cannot go beyond 'probably,' since we know that people sometimes see cats that are not there, for instance, in dreams" (P. I51). "\We assume that perception caii cause knowledge, although it niay cause error if we are logically careless" (P 165). "Perhaps it was like Macbeth's dagger, a phantasm called tip by the intention of committing a murder" (p. i8i). You may believe you see a dog, but "the producer comes to you and says: 'Ah, I hoped you would think it was a dog, but in fact it was recorded by the new system of technicolor, which is revolutionizing the cinema' " (p. i88). Illusions are possible: If at any point in the causal chain, "the event (light-waves, agitation of rods and cones, or disturbance of optic nerve or brain) which usually has its origin in i. cat, can be produced other- wise, wve shall have exactly the experience called 'seeing a cat,' without any cat being there. I beg, the reader to remember that I am talking science, not philosophy" (p. I 50). "The hypotheses that the light-waves proceeding from Jones, the percept and utterance of my friend, and the sound-waves proceeding to me, are mere auxiliary fictions in the causal interconnection of my percepts, has the same consequences as</page><page sequence="15">390 PHILOSOPHY ALND PHENOMIENNOLOGICALE RESEARCH the realist hypothesis, and is therefore equally tenable if my percepts are the sole ground of my empirical knowledge" (p. 375 f.). Language, which in most cases both expresses and indicates something, does not always succeed in "indicating" even though it succeeds in expressing (p. 256). As a consequence, Russell finds no way to refute skepticism if on( chooses to hold it. "No arguments are logically possible, either for oi against complete skepticism, which must be admitted to be one among possible philosophies" (p. i66). "This epistemological skepticism has a logical foundation, namely, the principle that it is never possible to deduce the existence of something from the existence of something else" (p. 359). "The hypothesis that only experienced events occur is not logically refutable, any more than the solipsist hypothesis. WVe need only suppose that, in physics, all those events that are not experienced are mere logical fictions, introduced for convenience in interconnecting the events that are experienced" (p. 376). "The hypothesis that sound reaches me by means of sound-waves might be false without ever lead- ing to any consequence that experience would show to be false; we can suppose that the sound-waves are a convenient fiction. and the sounds which I hear occur cas if borne by sound-waves, but in fact without non- sensible antecedents" (p. 38i). "Let us now take a statement about something that no one experiences, such as sound-waves or light-waves. I am not arguing that such statements can be known to be true: I am only concerned to assign a significance to them" (p. 378). "When I say that we can understand a sentence. I do not mean that we know how to find out whether it is true" (p. 387). "If I believe that there are occurrences in the physical world which no one perceives, these occur- rences must be nameless; the translation which substitutes a hypotheti- cal name will therefore be false, even if the original belief was true" (p. 297). "If there are basic existence-propositions. as we seem driven to conclude, their relation to perception must be very different front that of judgments of perception" (p. 298). The utter elusiveness of the objective is seen in the statement: "'There is no reason to suppose the relation of 'There is an x, such that fx' to the verifier to be different when the verifier is not experienced from what it is when the verifier is experienced" (p. 297 f. and Pl 303). And the final confession of defeat lies in the admission: "It is possible to develop a complete solil)si stic physics. svmllbolicallx idclistinguishable fromt ordinary realistic physics" (p. 273).</page><page sequence="16">RUSSELL'S QUEST FOR OBJECTIVITY 391 V What shall we say, then, as to the outcome of Russell's treatment of the problem of objectivity, and consequently of the significance of his theory of truth? The crux of his discussion comes in his treatment of the difference between "expression" and "indication" on the part of language, and be- tween "meaning" and "significance" in non-linguistic experience. There is no essential difficulty in his treatment of "meaning." But when he comes to "indication" he fails seriously. According to his own position one cannot escape his initial subjec- tivity by merely explaining the meaning of what goes on within one's own experience. But this includes, also, the case in which Russell him- self tries to-explain what it would be to transcend his own subjectivity. Mere explanation of the meaning and acceptance of an assertion of existence remains an ontological argument, as inconclusive as such argu- ment in any other field. His final assertions are marked by several notable features: (I) They are marked by inconsistency and wavering, between the extremes of certainty about his realistic correspondence theory of truth and complete skepticism as to the possibility of showing the truth of this theory. (2) They are marked by constant begging of the question at issue, viz., how one can tell in what cases one's experiences are not erroneous or illusory. He repeatedly assumes the point at issue, the existence of the physical realm, and so settles nothing by all his apparently subtle analysis. He explicitly takes for granted that Idealism has failed in its arguments. (3) He wavers between a realistic and a personalistic, pragmatic, conception of truth. (4) He hedges on the finality of his own analysis, sometimes re- garding it as the answer, at other times merely as an answer to the basic question. (5) He is guilty of a tacit anthropomorphism in assuming that experience must be interpreted in terms of humanity and of those ani- mals that are similar in structure to human beings. (6) He confuses "objective" existence, i. e., outside one's indi- vidual experience, and "physical" existence outside all experience, and so disregards the significance of the whole Objective Idealistic school of thought. There is no objection to his disproving its contentions; but there is objection to his missing its central point.</page><page sequence="17">392 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH (7) On crucial points, instead of establishing the truth of his posi- tion by evidence, he shifts to the contention of the equal validity of his doctrine with some other doctrine. (8) He appeals often to common sense to validate a doctrine which is a long departure in many respects from common sense. But, as a philosopher, he is under obligation not to rely upon common sense as a criterion, but to pass judgment upon it from a more critical point of view and allocate it to its proper status. (g) In so far as he fails to point directly to the instant of tran- sition from "expression" to "indication," his discussion remains a purely hypothetical one, having the status of a mathematical theorem, not of a historical narration. (io) His failure leaves us in solipsism. The net result is that Russell has not shown how objectivity is -attained out of initial subjectivity; he has not obviated the arguments of Critical Idealism; he has not established Realism; he has not vali- dated his own theory of truth. The conclusions he should have drawn from his own discussion are rather these: (I) My belief in an objective world is based upon a judgment I pass, involuntarily at first, then later voluntarily, upon my own percep- tive experiences. (2) The clue to all reality and to every theory of reality and of knowledge is therefore the act of judging; and this should be frankly acknowledged as the basic premise of every doctrine. (3) That feature in my perceptive experience which is decisive in escaping solipsism and reaching objectivity is the judgment of "passiv- ity" of my experience to something acting upon it and determining the existential particulars of its immediate content. (4) This passivity is an aspect of causality, which has in it some- thing more than phenomenal, and more than mere temporal sequence of occurrences. (5) The kind of objectivity this act of judgment reaches is elab- orated first in the form of social experience, the belief in the existence of other minds, and the communication with them. (6) The theory of the objective world, whether in any sense "physical" or not, must then be interpreted in terms either of social experience, or of agnosticism. (7) Therefore a form of Critical Idealism would present a more tenable theory than Russell's; although this, too, must agree with him</page><page sequence="18">RUSSELL'S QUEST FOR OBJECTIVITY 393 in his moments of agnosticism as to the character and the independent existence of the physical world. What I have tried to do in this paper is to consider this one point: Does Russell's presentation succeed in showing how we get from our own individual impressions to a belief in a world beyond these and so have a ground for accepting his own theory of truth. My conclusion happens to be negative; but I should have been equally happy to come to the opposite conclusion. ALBERT E. AVEY. OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY.</page></plain_text>
