The assurance of human safety has two aspects -the prevention of accidents, and the reduction of in- juries and fatalities. Accident prevention has been the most logical and direct line of approach for improving human survival in traffic. The statistics1 for the past quar- ter century, as shown in Fig. 1, clearly illustrate that considerable progress has been made toward this objective on a national scale. The preliminary 1954 statistics indicate the traf- fic fatality rate has continued its downward trend. With a new figure of 6.4 deaths per 100 million miles of travel, a 60% reduction in the traffic toll has been achieved during the last 24 years. This accomplishment is all the more remarkable when we consider how the traffic load per mile of highway constantly has increased. Fig. 2 shows the growth in vehicle population, increase in total annual travel1, and miles of available highway facil- ities2, 3. Since the end of World War II, during the period from 1945 to 1952, vehicle registrations in- creased over 70%, and the total miles of annual DESIGN FACTORS travel increased two-fold, while the available high- way mileage increased less than 1%. Obviously, beneficial influences must have oper- ated during this period to improve human survival in spite of the greater apparent hazards of in- creased traffic congestion. There can be no doubt that driver education, better traffic management, and improved highway design have made important Fig. 3 - Declining death rate from accidents involving only one vehicle for past 25 years 644 SAE Transactions</page><page sequence="2">IN AUTOMOTIVE SAFETY A.

However, it must be realized that the automobile industry, through continual improvements in design, also has done much to promote this safety accomplishment. The facts become more apparent when the infor- mation on total fatalities per mile of travel are sep- arated into accident types. The steadily declining death rate from accidents where only one vehicle is involved (Pig. 3) shows how better highway and vehicle designs have reduced the possibilities of the driver losing control of the vehicle. During the same period, the pedestrian fatality risk (Fig. 4) also has been reduced. This four-fold improvement in human survival reflects the effects of safety education, and the vehicle improvements for better driver vision, braking response, and overall vehicle control. The subject of vehicle and highway safety has come to the forefront of public attention in recent months, both through the press and public state- ments. Various charges have been made and numer- 1 See "Accident Facts." Published by National Safety Council, Inc. 2 See Highway Statistics." Published by U. S.

The author shows how the passenger-car in- dustry has built safety into vehicles to the point where -as an example -only 14% of accidents on the Pennsylvania Turnpike over its 13-year history were attributed to vehicle failures. Paralleling these efforts and the increasing emphasis on safer highways, better traffic man- agement and driver education, are extensive studies aimed at bypassing the human factor and increasing human safety in automotive vehicles. Among those described here are crash investiga- tions, laboratory tests of safety devices, and es- tablishment through various other means of de- sign criteria for human impact tolerance.

The impetus from the interest of the many individ- uals and groups that have become concerned can- not but encourage further improvements in traffic safety. The automobile industry has been deeply con- cerned with the complex problem of vehicle safety for many years. During the last few years, our ac- tivity in this field has been greatly accelerated. In addition to our own research investigations, we are working with highway, traffic management, and safety foundation groups, and contributing to driver education programs with training films, text- books, and the provision of vehicles for high school driver-training courses. We believe these coopera- tive efforts are paying rewarding dividends in achieving better highway safety. Vehicle and components testing for performance reliability is one area where the manufacturer can have direct control over the behavior of his product in the hands of the user. We conduct extensive test programs, which simulate the extremes of actual operating requirements, to guard against vehicle failures. One such test setup is shown in Fig. 5. The steering mechanism is installed in this rig as it would be in an actual vehicle. Shock loads on the wheel spindles and constant turning of the steering wheel to the right and left are endlessly repeated to assure that an adequate safety factor is provided in the design. Numerous similar performance tests are made on components, assemblies, and the complete vehicle. Particular emphasis is on primary structure de- tails. That this attention to primary structure is successful is demonstrated by the fact that we rarely hear of any failure in these components dur- ing actual operation. The expenditure for scientific, research, and engineering talent constantly has been increased through the years so that the best and safest pos- sible product will be manufactured and offered for sale at any given period in the progress of the auto- motive art. To place this discussion in the proper frame of reference, the historical background of the modern automobile and the evolution of some of today's safety features should be reviewed. As shown in Fig. 6, the first cars had wooden bodies and were almost identical with the horse- drawn conveyances of the period. The primitive bodies rarely had tops; doors and windshields were nonexistent, and steering usually was accomplished by means of a hand tiller. Roadability was little, if any, better than for the horse and buggy. During the first two decades of the 20th Century, many of the design innovations (Fig. 7) contrib- uted to safety through better vehicle roadability, driver vision, and packaging of the occupants. The left-hand drive was adopted for safer passing of on-coming traffic. Steering wheels and progressive- shift transmissions were incorporated for better and safer vehicle control. Electric headlamps and tail lights replaced oil and gas equipment for re- liable night-driving illumination. Driver controls were positioned for greater convenience and oper- ating safety. The evolution of safety features became even more apparent during the 1920's (Fig. 8). The safety-glass windshield was adopted, followed by shatter-proof glazing of all vision area for greater occupant protection. Automatic windshield wipers assured driver visibility during inclement weather. The heater and defroster offered additional comfort and clearer visibility during cold-weather opera- tion. The introduction of the vastly superior 4- wheel brake system was followed by the adoption of hydraulic actuation for safer, better-controlled stopping ability. All-metal wheels, of both spoke and disc designs, became standard equipment for greater strength and durability. Shock absorbers bettered the car's riding quality and significantly improved steering control. Important safety improvements in the next 10 years (Fig. 9) included the all-metal body with in- tegral roof structure. Low-pressure tires reduced shock to the chassis, and were less subject to fre- quently disastrous sudden failure. The wheels for these larger cross-section tires were reduced in di- ameter, and the spoke structure became short and wide to provide a considerably sturdier base for the tire. The foot-operated headlamp-dimmer switch permitted night-time driving with convenient cour- tesy, and undoubtedly prevented many an accident that could have been caused by glare-blinding of on-coming drivers. Even the feature of indirect lighting for the instruments had important safety overtones, since the operator could keep informed of vehicle performance without reducing his vision acuity. Sealed-beam headlamps assured prolonged reflector efficiency and better controlled illumina- tion pattern on the road. By 1950 (Fig. 10), even with the production in- terruption of World War II, several additional safety features had been introduced. Automatic windshield washers became available for improved driver vision during adverse driving conditions. Direction-indicator signals were another courtesy feature with safety significance that quickly prompted the whole industry to adopt them as standard equipment. The introduction of the auto- matic transmission into practically all car lines simplified the act of driving still further, and per- mitted the beginner to master the routine driving skills more quickly. Further tire improvements brought about the extra-low-pressure design for added comfort and blowout protection. Fig. 11 shows some of the latest developments that have contributed to safer vehicle operation during the past five years. The introduction of air conditioning for better driving comfort will im- Volume 64, 1956 ^</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 1 1 - Air conditioning, expanded windshields, power brakes and steering, tubeless tires, and improved engine capacity have added to safe vehicle operation during past five years Fig. 12 -One busy intersection where thousands of cars make stops that depend on consistent tire and brake performance prove operator alertness during adverse weather conditions. Driver vision has been vastly improved with the wider field of view through the expansive windshield and rear window and the reduced ob- struction of body structure and sheet metal. Power steering makes the handling of the car almost ef- fortless in traffic and parking maneuvers, and, in addition, provides steering stability when running off the road, passing over chuck holes, or driving through snow, sand, or mud. The greater capacity of the high-torque engine permits better accelera- tion for safer maneuvering through congested traf- fic, and passing highway obstacles with less time and distance spent on the wrong side of the road. Power brakes reduce the energy demand on the operator during stopping, and shorten the interval between the decision to stop and the actual decel- eration of the vehicle. The new-type sealed-beam headlamps, introduced in 1955, provide a higher- intensity low-beam illumination pattern on the road, and also reduce both glare into the eyes of oncoming drivers and stray light reflections when driving through dust, snow, rain, or fog. The 4-way adjustable power seat simplifies the positioning of the driver for comfort, vision, and vehicle control. The new tubeless tires not only make a blowout highly improbable, but also tend to reseal against the loss of air when punctured. The refinement of any one component or mecha- nism usually has been gradual, but through the Fig. 13 -Diagram showing com- plexity of factors involved in safe vehicle operation 648 SAE Transactions</page><page sequence="6">years operation has progressed from critical be- havior to accepted reliability. The development of durable and reliable tire equipment is one example of progress in the automotive art, and the continu- ing improvement in vehicle brakes is another. The scene in Fig. 12 is not uncommon in many of our larger cities. As many as 40,000 vehicles may be re- quired to stop at a busy intersection during the course of a day's normal traffic. Similarly, vehicles of all types, with all kinds of people driving them, make repeated stops day-in-day-out, year-in-year- out. We take such consistent performance for granted. But this high degree of reliability has ac- tually been the outgrowth of many years of contin- uous engineering refinement. Similarly, we rarely think about the numerous engineering design achievements where, all through the automobile, research and development unceasingly have striven to provide a maximum in safety and reliability. The interrelationship of many factors becomes apparent whenever vehicle accidents are investi- gated. The Pennsylvania Joint Safety Research Group4 developed the chart shown in Fig. 13, which illustrates the complexity of the problem in safe vehicle operation. Although a considerable number of factors influence the total picture, it will be ob- served that they are all modified by the behavior and motivation of the driver. Through research and experience, automotive en- gineers have gained an extensive understanding of the components that make up a modern automobile. We know the characteristics of servomechanisms, the permissible stresses in primary structure, and the control problems as they affect the vehicle. Highway designers, traffic engineers, and law en- forcement agencies have collected a wealth of data from which they have learned how to build safer highways and better manage traffic. The one im- portant field where there is insufficient knowledge is that of human behavior. We cannot predict how a driver will respond to any given set of conditions. However, we are progressing toward some answers to that many-sided problem. With our new methods of analysis and the use of high-speed electronic computing machines and an- alog equipment (Fig. 14) , we consider the driver as the feed-back in a closed-loop servomechanism. As shown by the block diagram, Fig. 15, this feed-back is used in our control and stability equa- tions. The feed-back, of course, is a function of the reaction time of the individual, his psychological makeup, his anticipatory reactions, and similar fac- tors. We still need further data on these human factors, and have enlisted the resources of the vari- ous sciences, particularly the human engineering biological and psychological sciences, to furnish this information.

Perhaps hard-and-fast conclusions cannot be drawn from this report, since it repre- sents operation under a special set of conditions. However, these records are practically the only complete and consistently maintained volume data available at the present time. Since accident pat- terns are repeated year after year in these tabula- tions, it appears logical to assume they represent some of the general conditions experienced on any highway. The data from this impartial survey (Table 1) showed that 86% of the accidents and 97% of fatalities were caused by driver incompetence, carelessness, recklessness, inattention, or incapa- bility of judging distance. Only 14% of the acci- dents were attributed to vehicle failures. We can assume that this 327 miles of high-speed highway imposes a higher-than-normal strain on vehicles, and these were not all new, late-model cars and trucks by any means. Tire failures alone accounted Table 1 - Pennsylvania Turnpike Data (October 1940 - December 1953) Total Number of Accidents 13,426 Total Number of Fatalities 486 Driver Causation: Accidents, % 86 Fatalities, % 97 Type of Accident: Personal Injuries, % 34.4 Fatalities, % 3.9 Property Damage Only, % 61 .1 Majority of Accidents Occurring: Speed Range Weather - Road 41 - 50 Clear - Dry 31 - 40 Wet, Snow, Slush, Ice for about half of the vehicle failures leading to accidents. It must be realized that, during the period covered by the report, the tire shortage of World War II forced many operators to continue with the use of tires that, in normal times, would have been discarded as unsafe. The vehicle failures also included the results of inadequate mainte- nance, improper truck loading, and swaying trailers which, in the final analysis, are really caused by human neglect or inexperience. The highest accident frequency occurred in the 41-50 mph bracket during favorable weather, and in the 31-40 mph range when there was rain, snow, slush, or ice. Less than $15 expense was incurred in 85% of the property damage cases. This low loss figure would indicate that high-speed collisions were not prevalent; in fact, less than 2% of acci- dent-involved cars were traveling in excess of 70 mph. Statistics such as these clearly reveal that much more information is needed to evaluate the human factor in our equation. Unfortunately, well-mean- ing people are sometimes led to erroneous conclu- sions when they consider means of improving traffic safety. One such example is the insistent fallacy that engine power and accident frequency are di- rectly proportional; therefore, engine power should be limited by legislation. This reasoning is as short- sighted as the highways law in England, which early in the 19th Century stifled progress in the development of self-propelled, over-the-road trans- portation. A steam coach service between London and Bath was maintaining a traveling speed of 15 mph as early as 1829. Agitation against this means of transportation became so vehement that even though a Parliamentary investigation disagreed, a law was enacted which compelled the coach to be preceded by a man on foot carrying a red flag. Of course, the coach line could not continue when so restricted, and further progress in self-propelled highway vehicles was abandoned for many years. While it is true that engine power can be mis- 5 See "Brief Passenger-Car Data." Published by Ethyl Corp. 8 See "Automobile Barrier Impacts," by D. M. Severy and J. H. Mathew- son.

All of us are familiar with the pros and cons of high-torque engines, but the arguments for accelerating ability, improved middle-speed performance, increased operating economy, and reduced engine wear cannot be dis- regarded. It also must be realized that while each accessory improves the convenience and safety of car opera- tion, it absorbs a portion of the engine power. Consequently, the growing popularity of automatic transmissions, power steering, power brakes, power-operated windows and seats, and electrical accessories such as radios, heaters, air condition- ers, and so forth, calls for added engine output to maintain operating efficiency. Up to this point, the efforts made to prevent vehicle accidents have been emphasized. This first aspect of the problem always must receive high- est priority in vehicle and highway designing. However, it is apparent that human performance failures will continue to precipitate accidents, re- gardless of accident prevention features. The intro- duction of safety glass and the development of all- metal bodies are examples of some of the important measures already adopted in connection with the second aspect of the problem -the reduction of human injuries and fatalities. During the past few years, research investigation of crash injury has been intensified to learn what additional provisions will increase human safety in automotive vehicles. It has been found necessary to stage full-scale collisions to determine the behavior of the vehicles and occupants during impact. Many complex re- actions, which require careful evaluation of numer- ous factors, have been observed during these in- vestigations. Here again, there is no dearth of voluntary sug- gestions from the public at large and well-inten- tioned, self-styled experts. However, the problem is considerably more involved, and the forces gen- erated during collisions are much greater than Fig. 19 -Reduction in impact reaction and injury to vehicle occupants with distance from front bumper in 30-mph impact Fig. 20 -Human tolerance to dynamic forces (seated position, forward motion) Fig. 21 -Tension-testing machine and body block used in testing seat belts and hardware usually assumed. For instance, we frequently are criticized for not providing greater structural strength in our vehicles to withstand collisions with less damage. However, when the laws govern- ing inertia, deceleration, and the dissipation of kinetic energy are considered, it becomes obvious that structural bending and yielding forward of the driving compartment (Fig. 18) 6 greatly mod- erate the force of the impact. Fig. 19 demonstrates how effective the structure of the modern car is in reducing the impact reaction and injury to the vehicle occupants. The subject of seat belts for automotive use has been receiving considerable attention for some time. Properly installed and used, such equipment should improve the chance of human survival' and reduce collision injuries. For one thing, the driver Volume 64, 1956 651</page><page sequence="9">Fig. 22 - Pull tests on body floor to establish structural requirements for adequate seat-belt installation Fig. 23 - Laboratory setup for investigating energy-absorbing character- istics of various configurations and materials as they apply to instrument panels will be less likely to lose control of the vehicle during a minor accident, and be injured because the vehicle subsequently went out of control. We also know that the probability of injury-reception is reduced when the occupants are retained within the protective enclosure of the vehicle. However, we do not know the tolerance of the human body under various impact conditions. Considerable work has been done on the human tolerance to dynamic forces by Lt.-Col. J. P. Stapp7 of the U. S. Air Force. Stapp's preliminary chart (Fig. 20) indicates that, during ideal conditions of body re- straint, appreciable deceleration can be tolerated. Crash investigations using instrumented anthro- pomorphic dummies and seat belts have supplied the range in loading developed under various im- pact conditions. Laboratory tests (Fig. 21) , using a tension-testing machine and a body block, have assisted in the qualification of belts and hardware. Pull tests on the body floor (Fig. 22) have estab- lished the structural requirements for adequate seat-belt installation. In short, investigations to date have broadly determined the physical condi- tions which the seat-belt installation must meet to withstand the forces developed during collisions. The other half of the problem, the determination of the human impact tolerance, also is under in- vestigation. The values, preliminarily established by Stapp's work, cannot be translated directly into automotive practice, since the elaborate restraints used in the Air Force investigations could not and would not be acceptable to automotive users. How- ever, such information provides relative values which, along with the work of medical researchers and the examination of accident statistics, assist in the establishment of design criteria for human im- pact tolerance. Fig. 23 illustrates a laboratory setup for investi- gating the energy-absorbing characteristics of various configurations and materials as they apply to instrument panels. Similar techniques are used to evaluate various other components. Again, only relative values can be established by these means. But when these are correlated with full-scale crash studies and medical observations on human sub- jects, practical values which will be effective in re- ducing human injury can be determined. Fig. 24 is a schematic of the test setup used to conduct full-scale crash studies. The crashed car is instrumented to determine the impact forces developed, and in some tests an immovable barrier is substituted to simulate a collision with a tree or 7 See "Human Tolerance to Dynamic Forces," by Lt.-Col.

The anthropomorphic dummies shown in Fig. 25 approximate humans in size, weight distribution, and skeletal articulation. They can be instrumented to determine the history of the collision events, joint tensions can be preset to simulate human anticipatory reaction, and their "skin response" will disclose injury-producing con- tacts with the interior of the vehicle. Fig. 26 shows the dummies installed in a test vehicle. Crashes are conducted with the dummies both free to move and held by restraining devices. High-speed motion pictures are taken as the crash occurs, and these are analyzed frame-by-frame Fig. 26 -Dummies installed in a test vehicle.

These observations are guiding us in our research studies and design development programs for safer vehicles. We are working with numerous recognized groups in the vehicle accident field in our attempts to determine facts which accurately reflect actual operating conditions. Besides Stapp's group at Holloman Air Base, we are cooperating with the Crash Injury Research Group at Cornell University Medical School, various medical groups, and police officials. In summary, automotive history demonstrates the willingness of the industry to adopt new ideas and keep abreast of technological developments.

The complexity of the safety prob- lem is realized by everyone seriously participating in crash injury research.

D I S C U S S I O N of R. A. McFarland and A. L. Haynes papers Foresees Continued Progress in Safer Passenger-Car Design by P. C. Ackerman Chrysler Corp. SAFETY manding in a travel greater on share our of streets the public's and highways interest is com- and manding a greater share of the public's interest . . . and alarm. The fact that each year, over the past 25 years, has seen the national highway safety record steadily im- prove, has not had the impact on public thinking that other phases of the problem have. Perhaps this is as it should be. Certainly, the automobile industry has long taken a strong, positive interest in im- proving its products to reduce the likelihood of accident in so far as possible and to reduce the severity of accidents, should they occur. Progress has been substantial on all fronts. Vehicles are better; streets and highways improved; traffic engineering is contributing more and more; driver education has helped and will help more in the future; and the American motor- ists, themselves, are driving better. All of these factors have contributed to safety. If they had not, we should not have seen the highway toll cut more than in half in terms of vehicle miles, or even better when based on the use and numbers of vehicles, over the past quarter-century. But this does not erase the seriousness of the remaining problem, nor the earnestness with which the automobile industry regards it. Neither has it mitigated the highly vocal alarm and demands for action from groups of mem- bers of medical associations, large segments of the nation's press, lawmakers the country over, and many other institu- tions and groups. Neither have the facts shielded the automobile industry from broadly unjust accusations, attributing the accident toll in an unrealistic measure to alleged intrinsic defects of the automobile. One could be philosophical about this, and remind himself that it is human nature to blame the inanimate, in this case the machine, for shortcomings that are essentially human. It is easy to point the finger at such mute mechanisms as automobiles, or to such intangibles as horsepower races, when the fault lies largely within ourselves that we kill each other on the highways. But being philosophical does not grapple with the prob- lem. The automobile industry traditionally comes to grips with situations that call for action. It considers this situa- tion as a challenge worthy of its best efforts. These efforts have been continuous, and they have borne good fruit. The problem has been attacked on three fronts: First, to design cars that can be driven in a manner to reduce the likelihood of accidents happening; second, to de- sign cars that will minimize the effect of an accident on the occupants of the car should an accident take place; and third, to promote highway construction on a national scale that will reduce the number of accidents and the severity when accidents do occur. In each category, important progress has been made. We all know that significant new developments to improve the vehicle in these respects are under way in the auto- motive laboratories and proving grounds. The President's Highway Advisory Committee's recommendation to spend $101,000,000,000 for roads in the next 10 years is certainly proof that this phase of the problem is getting serious at- tention. But we cannot design automobiles that will make up for all the ineptness, carelessness, or selfishness of which human beings are capable. We cannot produce an automo- bile proof against a head-on collision without developing a vehicle of such grotesque appearance, and completely unrealistic cost, as to be unacceptable on a variety of im- portant counts to almost any car buyer. I say this mindful of the lay suggestions that continue to arise from people, often competent in other fields, which suggest an incredible lack of information about the technology and economics of automobile design and manufacture. But we know that we can continue the progress we have already made in the design and development of better, safer automobiles for all people. We will continue to im- prove the agility of cars, to better their stopping ability; to make them more maneuverable and more responsive to controls; and to enhance even more the day and night-time visibility enjoyed by their drivers. And we shall continue to improve the protection offered to occupants of our cars, should accidents happen, both through the structure itself and through an ever increasing number of inherent features and accessories designed pri- marily for passenger protection and safety. 654 SAE Transactions</page></plain_text>
