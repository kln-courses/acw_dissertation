<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS THE REINTERPRETATION OF AMERICAN LITERATURE. Edited by Norman Foerster for the American Literature Group of the Modern Language Association of America. New York: Harcourt, Brace and Company. I928. And now at last scholarship is ready for the long neglected problems of American literature.' We need not dwell upon the minor reason for this resolve to set in order the investigation of the literary mind in Amer- ica. It is true that subjects for doctoral theses are becoming scarcer and scarcer in the well-worked fields of English literature; but still more true that time and a juster estimate of history have lifted American litera- ture from the schools to the universities, where it raises immediately complex questions of origin and influence that only scholarship can answer. American books, like American antiques, are more prized as we grow greater, and if scholarship can make the new estimates of our literary treasures more intelligent than the rather absurd valuations of maple furniture, colonial glass, and provincial what-nots, it will serve as a welcome antiseptic as well as a guide to excellence. It was only day before yesterday that Whitman came into his own; but yesterday when Melville was acknowledged as one of the great novel- ists of the nineteenth century. Emerson had his due, but lost it, and is only now regaining the reputation he deserves. Thoreau has not yet reached the peak of his fame. Cooper went into eclipse, but is likely to shine again, though with diminished glory. Irving has sunk to a glow, but it is a serene and steady light. Longfellow must be re-established on a new and lower plane. Emily Dickinson is rising. Mark Twain has fought his way into literature, but his work has never been properly studied as such. Poe's case is better. Holmes, Bryant, Jewett, Webster, Simms, Crane, Bierce, the Alcotts, Lanier-to take a handful of minor names, and Hawthorne, to choose a major, all need orientation, explana- tion, appreciation on the sound bases of exact knowledge, and by the fine intuitions of trained taste, which have long been available for older literatures. The need of literary history and the need of literary criticism are both apparent. Under the editorship of Professor Norman Foerster, a recent book, The Reinterpretation of Anerican Literature, supplies a program. The book which Mr. Foerster has edited is not perhaps for the general reader-his turn will come later-but it is of the greatest importance for all who take their native literature seriously, and especially for scholars, critics, and teachers. In it a group of scholars have united in a carefully organized discussion, the purpose of which is to discover how far Amer- 1 This review appears also in The Saturday Review of Literature for March 2, I929.</page><page sequence="2">8o American Literature ican literature is American, and when so, why; and to their symposium has been added an excellent bibliography of American literary history and criticism, and of the sources from which new knowledge may flow. These writers are not armed with sneers and insinuations, though their purpose is radical, but with a weapon always devastating when properly used, a definition of terms, and with a knowledge of American history- social, psychological, economic, political-so broad that it is not possible to controvert them by ignorant appeals to authority. The Puritan influ- ence and what it actually was, is Mr. Murdock's task, who leaves it, not a reproach, but a subject crying for further study. In spite of Mr. Mencken, we do not yet know the Puritans. Mr. Hubbell discusses the frontier, that American factor whose discovery by Professor Turner led to the rewriting of American history. The strong tides of European ideas which have swept over us with only a change of name is Mr. Jones's theme. Mr. Schlesinger urges that not in great names and great books but in the mass of the people's writing is to be found the literary history of a nation. Mr. Parrington connects science with realism. Mr. Kauf- man dissects romanticism. Mr. Clark, in a finely analytic paper, sets down a method of literary study. Mr. Pattee gives the specifications for a new literary historian of America; and Mr. Foerster, in a chapter which is the nucleus of the book, distinguishes the five forces which made American literature-the frontier, the romantic movement, the Puritan tradition, realism, and a European culture operating in an American environment. Know these before you begin to try to comprehend Amer- ican literature. I have so briefly summarized this really excellent book because I agree too heartily with most of its contentions to stop with its summary, which seems to me like the Ten Commandments, indispensable for literary morals though often disregarded, but incomplete without a last and greatest commandment that must be added. What we have here is good doctrine. Many a literary opinion has gone wrong from a failure to observe, for example, the belated character of American romanticism. Indeed, Mr. Foerster's statement that our great period fell in the west- ward sweep of the romantic wave which had left England to Victorian- ism, is a brilliant generalization which helps to explain why we have a Hawthorne, an Emerson, a Poe to compare with the great English romanticists, but no offsets to the great Victorians, Dickens, Thackeray, Meredith. And the later chapter by Mr. Jones, on European influences, is an excellent corrective for provincial critics who write as if transatlantic communication had just been invented. But when Mr. Kaufman begins to define the romanticism which came from abroad, there is a sense of lack, not so much in his definitions, since definitions of romanticism have always been unsatisfactory, as in his stresses. One feels that by concen- trating on romanticism in literature it is easy to prove either too little or too much. Still more with the pervasive influence of the frontier upon</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 8i the American imagination. Fortunately, Mr. Hubbell, who does not fail, to emphasize the necessitv of understanding the West if you are to comprehend a literature largely produced in the East, is not gentle with the new enthusiasts for the frontier who make it almost synonymous with American. The actual conditions of the frontier were in every sense un- favorable to literature. The men and women of the frontier were not chosen spirits intellectually-they were more often not chosen at all but driven by their own incapacity to survive in settled regions. In recent years they have been romanticized quite as much as they were depreciated in the last century, when "he has gone West" was a sneer rather than a compliment. It was not the frontier but the idea of the frontier that influenced literature-and that idea, like all ideas, was by no means purely geographical and American. Only one chapter in this book seems distinctly dangerous in its premises, for the critical method there upheld is a patent example of the dangers waiting upon students of American literature who, after reading, may think that the reinterpretation of American Literature in terms of exact knowledge of the facts is going to be enough. Professor Schlesinger, of Harvard, would have us forego the "unusual, and the super-excellent" as a pre-occupation in literary study. He would have us regard the printed word "as a medium of communication among human beings, horizontally in its application to contemporary society, vertically as ap- plied to the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation. This, it is clear, is an approach to letters as one of the social sciences. The objective becomes an understanding of the literary culture of the people-their culture as embodied in print-in all its aspects, but with the main attention always fixed on what is broadly diffused rather than on what is usual or special." Emerson, to Professor Schlesinger, is less important than McGuffey of the readers! But this is the negation of all literary criticism that is not merely his- torical, and, whatever it may be in history, in literature is perilously close to nonsense. Literature is not the expression of all the people by all the people for all the people-if so, court records and the transcript of a stenographer's notebook kept on the boardwalk at Atlantic City would be worth all the novels in the period. By such standards, the Paston Letters are more valuable as literature than Chaucer. But the very defini- tion of literature is that it is articulate, in the sense of being highly ex- pressive of the essence of contemporary life, and while the essence may be distributed through the mass, it reaches artistic consciousness only in the rare, the "super-excellent" person. From the point of view of America, Emerson was made for the spiritual refinement of the people, but from the point of view of literature the American people and their experience may be said to have been made for Emerson. It is not what they profited, but what he wrote, that gives to his work, as literature, its value now. The volumes of sketches of romantic scenes and persons so</page><page sequence="4">82 American Literature abundant in the early nineteenth century, are all of them together not worth one "Rip Van Winkle"; and, indeed, there is more that is essential to be learned of the Federalist mind at work in a rapidly chang- ing America from "Rip Van Winkle" than from all of these volumes. It is social science, not literary criticism, or even literary history, that Mr. Schlesinger is writing of, and he belongs in this book only by virtue of his reminder that we must remember backgrounds if we are to get our foregrounds right. When he substitutes background for foreground, weird tales for Poe and Hawthorne, newspapers for novelists, McGuffey for Emerson, he is throwing out the baby with the bath. His chapter reminds me of those pious editors who used Shakespeare to teach morality and the philologists who saw in Milton only allusions and the niceties of English grammar. And yet I must not overstate my case. The prerequisite for a criticism of American literature is exact knowledge of the background. I should even criticize Mr. Parrington-an able historidn of our literature-for not going far enough in this direction. His theme of realism is by no means sufficiently related to the progress of experimental science. I should ask of the critic who proposes to discuss the nature and genesis of American realism a fuller knowledge of scientific education and scien- tific reading in this country than he demands. And I should not confine, as he seems to do, the influence to realism. * *k * * * But if this program of reinterpretation of American Literature is a challenge to scholarship, it by no means exhausts the case for criticism. Indeed, like many other manifestoes, it deals with past errors chiefly, and leaves the vital word for the future unsaid. The instances cited by Mr. Clark from Freneau and Melville are significant. It is impossible to know Freneau without exact knowledge of the waves of European ideas washing through his mind from overseas. It is impossible to know Melville without knowledge of a maritime America and a period of violent spiritual reaction against the violence of Calvinist orthodoxy, the enthusiasm of transcendental optimism, the materialism of American prosperity. And yet-as Mr. Clark says-"the background . . . must not be allowed to obliterate the foreground, the literature itself." This idea cries for more expansion than it gets in this book. A reading of this Reinter- pretation leaves the impression that these scholars believe the scholarship they advocate and criticism to be identical-that if one knows what made a work of literature, one knows that literature. It is the dogmatics of determinism carried over into literary criticism. Given the causes and the effect is predetermined and understood, is indeed only the complex sum. And yet while one cannot know too much of the origins of, let us say, Walden, a knowledge of every source and influence, no matter how accurate, will never suck out the art of Walden. We who propose</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews 83 criticism must break sharply from the assumptions of the last critical generation, that investigation of fact can of itself lead to correct esthetic conclusions. This is mere analogy with the supposed findings of experi- mental science, from which the premises of all of our scholarship and much of our criticism have been taken. The now discredited scientists upon whom we have leaned assumed that there were no mysteries; what they did not know today they would learn tomorrow. The chain of cause and effect from the first stir of force to the mind of Shakespeare had missing links, but those links would be provided. And likewise our scholars and critics have too often tacitly implied that what the intuition perceived of beauty and significance in literature was a secret to be taken by a few more assaults on the surrounding facts, the wall of the mystery of beauty was already undermined and would soon fall. Check rhythm by machines, test fiction by history, apply economics to poetry-sooner or later we would know all, not by vague appreciation but in numbers, concretely, by facts. We were to learn the causes of literary effects by the same general methods as those w4ich were about to solve the nature of the atom, the electron, force, and the universe! On such a program is this book constructed, and it is a sound program for literary criticism where, as in the case of American literature, so much of the background remains to be investigated, so many false conceptions need to be knocked on the head, and the accurate measures of science are still to be substituted for methods demonstrably false. But if it is meant to be a complete program for American criticism, it is not sound. Nor does science, modern science, not the science in which most of us were educated, give it one ounce of support beyond that point where the background of literature ends, and the foreground, literature itself, begins. We are not-this seems certain-to learn what lies behind the atom, the electron, force, the universe, by the methods of science alone. The new generation of scientists are measuring only the measurable, and both their philosophy and their mathematics provide for the unmeasurable, and for that which is unknowable except through the intuitions of consciousness, which are not scientific at all but have at least as great a validity.2 To insist upon accurate measure in literary scholarship-and that is the function of this book-is right, but to imply, as some of the chapters seem to do, that scientific scholarship, fully de- veloped and adequately applied, will provide a complete critique for American literature, or for any literature, is to rest upon premises drawn from scientific theories already invalidated in science itself. It is to leave untouched the esthetic, intuitive, and essentially unscientific study of the effect of the whole of a work of art, such as Walden or the poetry of Poe, which is much more than the sum of its measurable parts. It is to neglect the intuitive powers of the appreciative mind, at the moment when pure science is respectfully assigning to them a place where it is 2I am following chiefly Eddington here and the cyclic conception of physics.</page><page sequence="6">84 American Literature impotent. Once before, and not so long ago, the critical school of Brune- tiere seized upon what it supposed was science and proffered the evolu- tion of literary types as the new road for criticism. But the measurable evolution of science was soon discovered to be very different from the hypothetical evolution of literary form. Brunetierism disappeared with its fallacy. Let us not cling to determinism in literature until the scien- tists themselves have to re-educate us. If American literature is to be reinterpreted, we shall need, then, more than this book provides, although we shall need all it provides. It lacks specifically a chapter on esthetic criticism-a term I like as little as romanticism, but which I cannot take space to analyze beyond the state- ment that intuition and taste and the perceptions of the consciousness will be given an emphasis not less than the study of sources and influ- ence. If this means that we must risk the vagaries of impressionistic criticism-well, we must risk them, and go on. There must be a clear charge to scholars that without feeling, perceiving, interpreting in terms which mean more than facts to the consciousness, the most exact analysis of, say, Moby Dick in terms of its origins will fail to grasp the book itself. "The crudest anthropomorphic image of a spiritual deity," says Edding- ton in his The Nature of the Physical World, "can scarcely be so wide of the truth as one conceived in terms of metrical equations." The most uncritical appreciation of a work of art (provided it is deeply felt) can scarcely be so unrepresentative of the real nature of a great book as an explanation conceived only in terms of its background and sources. It is clear that most of the authors of this book are aware of this distinction, and have limited themselves to background because the back- ground of American criticism needs drastic reforming. But it is equally clear that others, notably I should say, Professor Schlesinger, are unaware that what they are writing is not criticism at all, but the preparation for criticism; and still less aware that they are proposing to substitute an accurate knowledge of the phenomena of physical living for a study of the manifestations of consciousness (of which one field is art) that must carry beyond the facts by means of intuition duly controlled. Let us not ask for a revision of this Program of American criticism, which will serve its purpose admirably, provided that purpose is under- stood to be preliminary to a more difficult task. Let us rather ask for another and much more radical volume, in which the daring critic leaves measurement to those best qualified to do it, and engages the new prob- lems of intuitive appreciation for whose solution science can only pre- pare. Those who from a passage in Melville get more than so many words, so many definable concepts, so many reflections of the appearance of life, so many reminiscences of ideas long current, must tackle such problems or admit that they cannot feel beyond the logical cycle of mathematical proof, or take one step without measuring rods for a fact</page><page sequence="7">Book Reviews 85 which, in the view of scientific relativity, has already become an illusion, convenient, but no more reality than the emotion that follows upon the reading of a great poem.
