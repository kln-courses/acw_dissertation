<plain_text><page sequence="1">Blackie and his Family. By M. E. CooK. (Harcourt, Brace and Co.: 1949) 69 pages, illus. $2.00. This review of a book for children is included in the Wilson Bulletin because it is believed that ornithologists are probably teaching their children about birds. Your editor will appreciate comments from the members concerning the desirability of reviewing children's books. Blackie (apparently a Brewer's Blackbird) and his wife Dusty lived in a garden and built a nest in a pomegranate. They successfully repelled Mr. Darting Hawk, Chucky Ground Squirrel, and Old Man Gopher Snake. After raising 4 young, the birds join a flock and event- ually migrate. Ornithologically the book is satisfactory. There are no serious errors in life history data and the anthropomorphism is not excessive although (p. 4) the function of song has the erroneous )oetic interpretation. Conservationists will regret the emphasis upon the hawk episode. From the viewpoint of a psychologist the book is satisfactory but not impressive. Children from 5-8 will enjoy a couple of readings. Unfortunately, the hawk and snake epi- sodes are likely to make the greatest impression. Ornithologists have discovered a gold mine in adult books. Why shouldn't they invade the field of children's books an(d teach our childlren correct ornithology? DAVID E. DAVIS IF. E. Saunders, Natutralist. Edlitecd by R. J. RUTTER.
