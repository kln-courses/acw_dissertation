As a result, it is found for good agreement between experiment and simulation that the exact input data of successive toeboard intrusion play an important role. As for the parametric study on vehicle crashworthiness, the authors propose the convenient method to represent the actual crash pulse by two simplified trapezoids. Then using these trapezoids, the parametric study clarifies the influence of veh i c 1 e deforma t ion characteristics as well as the interior parts on dummy injury. INTRODUCTION In order for new vehicle to be developed efficiently with respect to crash performance, it is important to evaluate the effects on occupant behavior of vehicle crashworthiness and the contribution of interior parts to clarify their appropriate 1 evel s . Usually, computer simulation of occupant behavior at frontal collision is performed under such a condition that only the acceleration in the longitudinal direction is given. Observing the actual crash sequence in detail, however, it is necessary to assess the deformation and the rotational behavior of passenger compartment, as well, for computer simulation to be more effective. This paper employs the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association (MVMA2D) Crash Victim Simulation Model, restrained by three point seatbelt. The objects of this study are, firstly, to obtain the method to achieve appropriate correlation between the results by the mathematical model and by actual full scale frontal crash experiment, and secondly, to acquire the method to specify the desirable levels with respect to acceleration level, rotational behavior of vehicle, cabin deformation and characteristics of interior parts. MATHEMATICAL MODEL FORMULATION AND SIMULATION FIDELITIES OCCUPANT MODELING - The MVMA2D occupant model treats the vehicle occupant as being made up of a collection of rigid bodies interacting with one another through hinged joints as shown in Fig.l. 1586</page><page sequence="2">ROOF HEADER ANCHORAGE POINT "X WINDSHIELD /Hļ^N INSTRUMENT f ' / ' '' PANNEL / - / DASH //////// y - T- / - - 'X.

The interaction between the occupant and the vehicle interior is treated by means of contact between ellipses and planes. The vehicle interior is described by planes. Ellipses are attached to the occupant to sense and to develop contact forces. When contact between the ellipses and planes take place, reaction forces between the occupant and the' vehicle are generated. These forces are described by polynomials or in tabular form as a function of the depth of penetration of the occupant ellipses into the planes. Frictional forces are developed during these interactions. The coefficient of friction is changed as a function of penetration. The model simulates the "ploughing effect" between the pelvis and the seat cushion as the pelvis moves forward with respect to the seat cushion in a crash. Here, the contact planes on the vehicle are set to move as a function of time to simulate intrusion of vehicle components such as toeboard and instrument panel. The MVMA2D model has advanced belt subroutines that simulate the three dimensional aspect of commonly used three point belt restraint systems. The model simulates the B pillar-mounted slings, that is, D- ring and a buckle "strap" on the lower side. The shoulder belt and the lap belt are prescribed, however, to pass through fixed attachment points on the chest and the pe 1 vi s . ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) VALIDATION OF THE MATHEMATICAL MODEL - In order to perform good correlation between the results by mathematical calculation and test, attempts are made to measure correctly the frictional force of the seat cushion, interaction of seatbelt with dummy's body and rearward displacement process of toeboard as foil ows . Seat Characteristics Experiments show that as the dummy goes forward, his hip submerges into the seat, which leads to increase in friction force. As shown in Fig. 2, therefore, measurements are made of coefficient of friction between seat and dummy by changing the deflection of the seat by means of adding weights to a seat cushion. Fig. 3 shows coefficient of friction, which are approximated by a quadratic curve of seat deflection. íř -U LL-i TENS I - ^ OMETER |~| LOAD CELL rl '' SEAT X jf WEIGHT PULLEY T ™ )- ' 'l Vļ Up POTENT I - r~n I , ^ OMETER 1 J I ■ fVl ^ 1 I I M Fig. 2 Test procedure to measure coefficient of friction 1587</page><page sequence="3">1,5 r / c / o / o 1.0 - y' VM o c o - 0.5 - H-t &lt;ü O U I I I 0 50 100 150 Seat deflection (mm) Fig. 3 The relation between seat deflection and coefficient of friction Seatbelt Characteristics - The following describes the procedure to make input data of elongation characteristics of seatbelt with the load limiter by means of tearing threads on the webbing. Firstly webbing elongation characteristics is obtained by applying the tensional force on the webbing. Here the fluctuating load caused by load limiter is approximated by an average load during tear of the threaded part as a matter of convenience. Secondly the load-deformation characteristics of waist of anthropomorphic dummy due to belt load are obtained by compressing it with steel plate of the width of seatbel t . As a result, the resultant elongation of seatbelt is, as shown in Fig. 4, obtained by the sum of webbing elongation and deformation of the dummy's waist. (3) Toeboard Displacement - High- speed film analysis reveals the time history of the rearward displacements of a steering wheel and an instrument panel in a conventional way. However, the movement of toeboard is hard to observe.

This is, however, responsible for irrelevant movement of knees in comparison with the experiment . As shown in Fig. 5(a), measurements are made of the toeboard movement by a high speed camera through a hole provided on the hinge pi 1 1 ar . Consequently, it is found as shown in Fig. 5(b) that a toeboard intrudes into a cabin, changing the slant angle. Fig. 6 shows time history of toeboard displacement between previously assumed condition and actually measured one. Fig. 7 shows comparison of results of the motion of knee between by mathematical calculation and by test. It is found that the calculated results by an employment of input data of measured toeboard displacement yield in good agreement with experimented ones concerning the motion of knee. Comparisons are made between the calculated results and the experimented ones at a 35 mph vehicle frontal barrier crash using HYBRID III dummy. Fig. 8(a) and (b) show the input data of vehicle crash characteristics in the form of the crash pulse, i.e., the vehicle acceleration versus deformation characteristics, and the rotational behavior with respect to the vertical plane during the crash, respectively. 1588</page><page sequence="4">Fig, 5 Motion of toeboard intrusion 150 H assumed ^ e yv s measured y c / / upper side c 0 ļQQ - / * of toeboard 1 // - 50 ■ r •o 50 ■ /1 f lower side £ / ļ / / of toeboard ° / / +' / •° / L' / O / &gt; / ~ I I 0 50 100 Time (msec) Fig. 6 Comparison of toeboard intrusion between previously assumed condition and actually measured measured -i -200 ^ calculated e O ' i ' ' - -100 _ i g ' CO O ' ' V M CO U O 09 , L_VJ V " U 09 V U 09 200 100 0 Forward displacement (mm) Fig. 7 Comparison of the motion of knee between mathematical calculation and test G 60 - = 40 - = i 40 ""/V~ - - ' -Q 0 250 500 750 Deformation (mm) (a) Characteristics of vehicle acce 1 erat i on versus deformation at a 35 mph vehicle frontal barrier crash Fig. 8 Vehicle crash characteristics 1589</page><page sequence="5">~ w 4 ^ r cö &lt;ü ^ c -o - " O G / OS «J L^- 1 1 1 0 50 100 150 Time (msec) (b) Rotaional behavior characteristics of vehicle Fig. 8 (continued) Fig. 9(a), (b) and (c) show comparison of head and chest resultant acceleration as well as motion of head between the results by the mathematical model and by the experiment.

Fig. 11 shows how the actual crash pulse is simplified into two trapezoid parts, separated by each other at the point where acceleration level changes abruptly. For a typical front engine and rear drive, namely, FR vehicle, the engine moves forward up to this point during the first half of this trapezoid representation, whereas the engine stops and intrudes into dashboard during the second half. Here Gl and G2 are average acceleration levels, and are determined in such a way that the area of each trapezoid is equivalent to that of actual crash pulse in the respective part for the purpose of energy conserva t i on . Fig. 12(a), (b) and (c) show the comparison of computational results of occupant response with respect to head and chest resultant acceleration as well as motion of head between the results by the approximated crash pulse and by the actual one. Good agreements are obtained between them. 1590</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 10 Comparison of dummy motion between simulation and experiment at a 35 mph vehicle frontal barrier crash 1591</page><page sequence="7">Fig. 10 (continu ed) u 60 r measured a ' g approximated /' iļ r 40 - / i i' r s 40 - / ' / / i Ví i' 8 20 ' s; / ^ "i " I /l o 250 500 750 Deformation (mm) Fig. 11 Comparison of the actuai crash pulse and the approximated trapezoids for FR veh i c 1 e using actual crash pulse ~ 120 &lt;£ using approximated trapezoids I 80 - ï 40 " y ^ I I 1 0 50 100 150 Time (msec) (a) Resultant acceleration of head Fig. 12 Comparison of results obtained by the actual crash pulse and by the approximated trapezoids for FR veh i c 1 e 1592</page><page sequence="8">using actual crash pulse using approximated trapezoids % /' ' g 40 - F ' ~ 20 " / ' / &lt; 1 1 JÜL I 0 50 100 150 Time (msec) (b) Resultant acceleration of ches t -f -100 Forward displacement (mm) 500 400 300 200 100 0 E E ■ 100 I! c E O «J - 200 g - 300 t &gt; J 400 using actual crash pulse using approximated trapezoids (c) Motion of head Fi g . 1 2 ( con t i nued ) Fig. 13 shows an another example of occupant response for a different crash pulse of a front engine and front drive, namely, FF vehicle. Different from FR vehicle, FF vehicle tends to have a relatively slow transient period between the first half part and the second half part due to the rotational behavior of an engine with respect to the vertical axis. Taking this transitive period into account can lead to good agreement between the computational results and tested ones as shown in Fi g . 1 4 ( a) , ( b ) and ( c ) . ^ ^ measured 0 approximated š " /X 1 20 - /"' V u&lt; ^ - » ' ' 1 0 250 500 750 Deformation (mm) Fig. 13 Comparison of the actual crash pulse and the approximated trapezoids for FF vehicle using actual crash pulse using approximated trapezoids 0 S 80 - 0 50 100 150 Time (msec) (a) Resultant acceleration of head using actual crash pulse 60 using approximated trapezoids 1 40 - / ' ī 20 - / ' o J 0 50 100 150 Time (msec) (b) Resultant acceleration of ches t Fig. 14 Comparison of results obtained by the actual crash pulse and by the approximated trapezoids for FF vehicle 1593</page><page sequence="9">-ļ -100 Forward displacement (mm) 500 400 300 200 IQQ r- i I - - 100 200 0 Î - 100 ~ c o E 4) co - 200 I TS &lt;0 ü ~ - 300 t 4) &gt; using actual crash pulse using approximated trapezoids - 400 (c) Motion of head Fig. 14 (continued) Thus, it is found that two simplified trapezoids can well represent the actual crash pulse for the purpose of occupant crash simulation. PARAMETRIC STUDIES ON VEHICLE CRASHWORTHINESS EFFECT OF CRASH PULSE As the parametric study, degree of effects of the crash pulse pattern on occupant injury indices will be examined. In conducting this parametric study, the total energy which vehicle has at 35 mph frontal barrier crash is assumed to be maintained. The following approach is useful to clarify the target level of the acceleration in developing new type of vehicle. First, under the condition of constant vehicle deformation, the influence of vehicle acceleration level is examined. As shown in Fig. 15, Gl and G2 are defined as the average acceleration during the first and second half par t , respec t i ve 1 y . Here, G2 is increased and Gl is decreased so that the total energy can be conserved. The results are shown in Fig. 16(a) and (b) in which a great influence of Gl and G2 on HIC (Head Injury Criteria) and 3 ms clip chest G (specified in FMVSS 208, respectively) are observed. - 60 r o o 40 - G2 * 20 - Gl 4J = O = O .mmm- mmmm- 0 250 500 750 Deformation (mm) Fig. 15 Parametric study on vehicle acceleration for constant deformation of vehicle 800 p . 700 - y 600 - / - 500 - i X 400 - J* 300 200 I I 1 I I I I 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 G2 (G) ■ I I I I I 16 14 12 10 8 Gl (G) (a) HIC 74 - 70 - y' 66 - / u / ^ 62 - ^ co 4&gt; / £ O J* 58 - 54 - yr 50 » * ■ ■ ■ " » 26 ,28 30 32 34 36 38 Gl (G) I I I 1 I I 16 14 12 10 8 G2 (G) (b) Chest G Fig. 16 Effects of Gl and G2 on HIC and chest G 1594</page><page sequence="10">Second, allowing various vehicle deformations, it is examined which acceleration level of GÌ or G2 dominates over occupant injury indices. Under condition of constant G2 , the effect of Gl is appraised by changing length of vehicle deformation to conserve the total energy as shown in Fig. 17. Fig. 18(a) and (b) show that increase of Gl improves HIC and chest G due to better initial restraint of an occupant by seatbelt. Under condition of constant Gl, the effect of G2 is likewise evaluated in Fig. 19. According to Fig. 20(a) and (b), the increase of G2 worsens greatly occupant injury indices because of diminishing so-called Ride-Down ef f i c i ency . ( 4 ) G2 seems to be more sensitive to HIC and chest G than Gl. Therefore it follows from the above that lowering G2 is more effective than raising Gl for improving occupant injury. § 60 " ! 40 - cd 1 1 i I f 20 - Gl f I 20 - ^1- Gl 1 . 0 250 500 750 Deformation (mm) Fig. 17 Parametric study on vehicle acceleration for constant G2 600 p 500 - * 66 u * ■ 400 - » 62 " 300 I I I I I ° 58 1 1 1 1 8 10 12 14 16 8 10 12 14 16 Gl CG) Gl (G) (a) HIC (b) Chest G Fig. 18 Effects of Gl on HIC and chest G 5 60 " I 40 - G2 U I 20 - Gl I Ü 0 250 500 750 Deformation (mm) Fig. 19 Parametric study on vehicle acceleration for constant Gl 800- |- 700 - 600 - S* ~ 500 - X J* 400 - s' 300 - 200 I I I I I I I 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 G2 (G) (a) HIC 72 - 68 - o 64 - en Ja 5 6° - 56 - 52 » « « « « » 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 G2 (G) (b) Chest G Fig. 20 Effects of G2 on HIC and chest G 1595</page><page sequence="11">EFFECT OF ROTATIONAL BEHAVIOR OF VEHICLE - In what follows, it is examined how occupant injury indices are influenced by the rotational behavior of the vehicle in the vertical plane at frontal collision against a flat barrier. At high speed frontal collisions, it is often observed that passenger compartment rotates clockwise or counterclockwise in the vertical plane, which is commonly referred as "nose dive" or "nose up", respectively. These rotations may have a great influence on crash space, and restraint capability of a seatbelt system due to an additional movement of the seatbelt anchorage points in response to a rotational direction. (5) Fig. 21(a) and (b) show effects of "nose dive" on occupant injury indices. In this analysis, "nose dive" is assumed to start at the time t=0,25,50, or 75 ms after impact, to increase linearly up to 5 degrees for the period of 50 ms and to remain cons tan t . From the result of computat i on , i t is found that an earlier start of "nose dive" tends to increase HIC but to improve chest G due to forward movement of the upper anchorage point in comparison with irrotatinal behavior shown by a dotted line in Fig. 21. On the contrary, Fig. 22(a) and (b) show effects of "nose up" on occupant injury indices. "Nose up" doesnłt seem to have much to do with HIC. However, chest G is greatly improved by an earlier rise of "nose up". This is because earlier rearward movement of the upper anchorage point relative to occupant contributes to better initial restraint by seatbelt, irrotational irrotational 700 r nose dive nose dive 600 K. 64 - 1 500 ^ 60 1 .c 400 I 1 1 1 U 56 I 1 1 1 0 25 50 75 0 25 50 75 Start time of Start time of "nose dive" (msec% "nose dive" (msec) (a) HIC (b) Chest G Fig. 21 Effects of "nose dive" on occupant injury indices irrotat ional nose up irrotational I" 700 r nose UP 62 u / u 600 - ; 58 •/ - ■ oj / X - - f. / 500 = ° 54 - 400 1 1 1 50 '*11 0 25 50 75 o 25 50 75 Start time of Start time of "nose up" (msec) "nose up" (msec) (a) HIC (b) Chest G Fig. 22 Effects of "nose up" on cccupant injury indices EFFECT OF TOEBOARD INTRUSION - Upon condition that crash pulse and maximum longitudinal deformation of vehicle are kept to be the same as the tested vehicle for validation of the mathematical model, Fig. 23(a) and (b) show effects of maximum toeboard intrusion and the initial position of toeboard on occupant injury indices. Here the ratio of toeboard intrusion for computation to that obtained from the actual test is kept constant during the crash. For various ratio, the maximum toeboard intrusion is given as the maximum value of the base toeboard intrusion multiplied by this ratio. As for the initial position of toeboard, that of the base vehicle is indicated by zero value. Negative and positive sign indicate the forward and the rearward direction from the position located at the actual crash test for the model validation, respect i vely . As a computational result, it is found that the increase of the maximum toeboard intrusion or the rearward increase of the initial position of toeboard tends to greatly increase HIC when the head of dummy begins to impact on his knee as shown in Fig. 23 (a) . For chest G,it is found that there seems to be an optimal initial position of toeboard in relation to toeboard intrusion as shown in Fig. 23 (b) . 1596</page><page sequence="12">270 ¡ 00 500 600 180 HHHÜ^MM^hhmhhkJLHM^^^^ -30 0 30 60 Initial position of toeboard (mm) (a) HIC 270 180 Lhmmhm^^LBMHMMJhhhmhm -30 0 30 60 Initial position of toeboard (mm) (b) Chest G Fig. 23 Parametric study on maximum toeboard intrusion and its initial position PARAMETRIC STUDIES ON INTERIOR PARTS In order for optimal specifications of interior parts to be decided, parametric studies are performed as follows. soo r*™^ S / 600 OJ 5 600 - / « 700 ° H-t f ° X OJ ļ I 400 - / / -o y « o ^ ^^800 25 50 75 100 Length of load limiter (mm) (a) HIC 800 " i- Al - 52G o _ _ - 58G 60G 0) v 400 - -6 2G "O o - 64G 200 25 50 75 100 Length of load limiter (mm) (b) Chest G Fig. 24 Parametric study on lap belt character i s t i es EFFECT OF SEATBELT ELONGATION CHARACTERISTICS - Upon condition that crash pulse and maximum longitudinal deformation of vehicle are kept to be the same as the case for the toeboard intrusion studies, Fig. 24(a) and (b) show effects of load limiter characteristics, namely of the load level of tearing thread and of the length of load limiter. 1597</page><page sequence="13">As a computational result, it is found for HIC that the increase of the load level and decrease of the length of load limiter tends to greatly improve HIC.

Especially, the method to measure the toeboard intrusion by a high speed camera through a hole provided on a hinge pillar is proven useful to achieve good agreement between the mathematical model and test with respect to motion of knee. 2 It is found that two simplified trapezoids can well represent the actual crash pulse in evaluating occupant injury indices. 3 Using the simplified trapesoid representation of crash pulse, degrees of effect of pulse pattern on occupant injury indices reveals that HIC and chest G seems to be more sensitive to the latter half average vehicle acceleration level than to the former. 4 In evaluating effects of rotational behavior of vehicle on dummy injury indices, "nose dive" is considered to give good effects on chest G, whereas to give adverse effect on HIC. 5 Parametric study on effects of maximum intrusion and initial position of toeboard reveals that increase of intrusion and rearward initial position of toeboard tend to worsen HIC greatly and that there seems to exist an optimal initial position of toeboard for chest G. 6 Parametric studies on interior parts show that, as for seatbelt elongation, larger load level of load limiter contributes greatly to improvement of occupant injury indices and that the stiffness of instrument panel gives small 1598</page><page sequence="14">effect on injurry indeces.
