The Navajo have an especially unusual worldview, one that has long fascinated the general public and those interested in the inter- relationships between language, culture, and cognition. Pinxten, a cognitive anthropologist at the University of Ghent, presents a rich and pen- etrating analysis of this important topic. His book is a description of the Navajo conception of space based upon detailed semantic analysis of the Navajo language. The result is a picture of an elaborate and cohesive worldview. Equally interesting is the method that Pinxten devised to construct it: the Universal Frame of Reference for Spatial Analysis. But more about this device later. In the first chapter Pinxten explores "the nat- ural philosophy of Navajo language and world view"; he believes that the worldview contains five basic conceptual clusters. The first pertains to the structure of the world. "Earth and Heav- en have a slightly arched form [portrayed in the shape of the hogan, and] there is no conceptu- alization of a totality, encompassing both Earth and Heaven" (p. 36). The second concerns the dynamic nature of the world. "In opposition to the common Western belief of segmentability of an essentially static world, Navajos systemati- cally represent the world and every discrete en- tity as a dynamic or continuously changing en- tity. A complex time-space notion seems more applicable than clearly distinct concepts of one- dimensional time and three-dimensional space" (p. 36). The third concerns boundedness and center. The notion of Navajo boundary "cannot easily be grasped within the Western perspec- tive; again, the essentially dynamic nature of anything existing has to be taken into account so that boundaries are recognized as extreme variations of process, rather than static posi- tions" (p. 36). The fourth concerns the closed- ness of the world. Everything happens within the world. The fifth concerns the interrelated- ness of everything. "Any single aspect or entity of the Navajo world enters specifiable, often del- icate, relationships with something else. One of the main consequences of this opinion is that any human action involving any one particular aspect of the world has a certain impact on other aspects (eventually on the whole creation). Re- spect is considered the most rewarding as well as the most natural attitude" (p. 36). The next two chapters cover Pinxten's se- mantic evidence (extensive field interviews were conducted through Navajo translators), which is used in Chapter 4 to build a model of Navajo spatial concepts, consonant with Navajo natural philosophy. The model is complex and difficult to summarize. Pinxten presents it as a lexicon or dictionary of terms although he does provide a graphic summary or flow diagram of the inter- connectivity of spatial concepts (p. 150). In the fifth chapter he summarizes key differences be- tween Navajo and Western views of space in order to discuss applications of his work for teaching children spatial concepts. Here he fo- cuses on the characteristics of hierarchy, part/ whole, and the dynamic world. With regard to hierarchy he says, "In contrast to the neatly reg- ular hierarchical structure and development that were shown in the Western space conceptual- 282</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 283 ization, Navajo space. .. appears to be found- ed on at least three equally important 'basic' notions (movement, volumeness/planeness, di- mensions). All three are topological in character. Moreover, none of them are really 'primitive' in the sense that the (Piagetian) Western notions are: They are clearly composites themselves, and have spatial notions as their constituents; they codetermine themselves" (p. 161). Similar- ly the part/whole that is so important in Western thought plays a minor role in Navajo spatial con- cepts because of the importance of process, events, and fluxes in that worldview. Indeed Na- vajo spatial terms are themselves dynamic. Time inheres in space. These constructions of Navajo spatial con- cepts are based upon Pinxten's identification of Navajo spatial terms, of what they mean, and of how they are internally related. He accomplish- es this by developing what he calls a neutral and universal frame of reference for spatial concepts in all cultures-a Universal Frame of Reference for Spatial Analysis. He sees this frame of ref- erence as analogous to Munsell color cards, as used in Berlin and Kay's work on peoples' lan- guages for color (Berlin and Kay 1969). For Pinxten, the significant categories of spa- tial relationships that every culture can employ are approached by emphasizing the practical as- pects of space-manipulating spatial objects and moving through space. He delimits the do- main of these relationships generally and loosely so that it could be easily translated into other languages. Each entry "is an autonomous unit ... [in the attempt to] avoid relationships of definition or of hierarchy between particular en- tries as much as possible" (p. 185). In sum he presents a list of "a maximally general and scientifically defined set of spatial terms and concepts" (p. 186). The concepts themselves cover three general levels of experience. The first is "physical or object space" -the scale of space "in which a people can manipulate, han- dle, look upon as a whole, move in totality and so on" (p. 188). The second, sociogeographical space, is an intermediate level between object space and the third, a cosmological space. Most of the spatial concepts apply to all three cate- gories. What then are these universal spatial con- cepts? The list of entries (without their defini- tions which take many pages) for the object space follows: near, separate, contiguous; part/whole; bordering, bounding; overlapping; internal/external, central/peripheral; open/ closed; converging/diverging; volumeness/ planeness/succeeding, ordering; preceding/ following (in front of, in back of); in perspective; deep, far (dimension of depth); distant (metric); upon/under, above/below; vertical, upright (di- mension); high, deep (metric); lateral, next to; left/right; horizontal (dimension); wide, broad (metric); cardinal points, cardinal directions; co- ordinate systems; multidimensionally extended (metric); geometric point; geometrically linear, straight; geometrically pointing, parallel, being an angle; geometrically being a volume, a sur- face; geometric figures; resting, moving; moving along one dimension; moving, linearly curving, rotating, spiraling; having a direction in move- ment; being spatially random/spatially deter- minable; global spatial characteristics; absolute/ relative; finite/infinite; bounded/unbounded; continuous / discontinuous / homogeneous / hetero- geneous. Pinxten claims these are roughly discrete cat- egories. Some are self-evident but others are not. What, for example, does "multidimension- ally extended" mean? He says "a phenomenon is said to be multidimensionally extended pro- vided it is recognized as an instance of volume- ness (or planeness) and provided it is specified further through the displacement of a conven- tional unit. The measuring can be more or less precise and accurate and may be performed fac- tually or mentally" (p. 211). As a definition it does not seem to stand alone. In English (and in the language of Euclidean geometry) it is a com- plex concept built up from simpler spatial terms. But in Pinxten's approach this concept (and the others) can potentially be isolated in another culture's language. If it is expressed in another language like Navajo, the point to observe is whether or not it is built up from other concepts on the list. If it is not and is used to define other concepts, it can be treated as something of a geometric primitive or axiom for that spatial lin- guistic system. From this schema, then, spatial terms can be isolated and interconnected to form the linguistic model of a conception of space. As I noted, Pinxten's construction of the Na- vajo spatial view seems plausible. He claims there were no difficulties in fitting Navajo words to his neutral spatial categories, and I have no doubt that the Universal Frame of Reference was invaluable for isolating and connecting spa- tial concepts. I am uncertain, however, about the instrument itself and the claim that it is uni-</page><page sequence="3">284 Book Reviews versal. Pinxten says the Universal Frame of Ref- erence is derived inductively and synthetically. Its categories do not flow from a set of basic spatial principles or from a spatial logic. If they did, it would according to Pinxten smack of an already established spatial conception and would be imposing one logic on another. He has instead formed something of a pastiche of spatial terms. But as I pointed out with the example of "multidimensionally extended," concepts are difficult to describe even in the test instrument without supposing other relationships. In other words even though many of the concepts are on the same level and all do not follow from a set of principles, some are still likely to be more derivative than others. Another difficulty is that because the schema is inductive there is no means of proving it is universal. All one can do is test it in each case. Two testings have already produced modifica- tions in the instrument (Pinxten used a similar instrument for the Dogan language). As it stands now, can it handle general spatial concepts of interest to geographers? It can accommodate some of the conventional spatial terms and some of the humanistic concerns of our involvement with objects. Geographers are included in the bibliography (e.g., Abler, Gould, Lowenthal) but not cited in the text. But what can it do with fundamental, yet complex, issues? For example, a striking difference between modern (post- Renaissance) conceptions and pre-modern ones is that geographical space is describable not only by a metric, but by a language of geometry. In other words, earth space is often conceived of as though it were a part of geometry. It can be conceptually emptied of all events and still have a structure. What is more, this structure is a matter of convention. Its center can be any- where; its metric can vary. As I understand Pinxten, he would consider this idea to be part of the problem of coordinates. About this he states, "The Cartesian coordinate system for three-dimensional space is a fairly specific ver- sion of the general and natural coordinate sys- tem that is formed by the structure of the human body: it is not the Cartesian system as such that is very different, but the way in which one tack- les the task of defining the system in terms of abstraction" (p. 209). But there are important overtones in the meaning of space that this reac- tion misses and that constitute a modern sense of space. Not using anything anthropomorphic in the language of space permits modern geom- etry to describe space and helps modern culture to use space in ways that are not easily imag- inable if this geometric system did not exist. For instance, the modern geographic distinction be- tween location and place can be discussed only in the context of a geometry of space. It is dif- ficult to see how these and other important spa- tial concepts in Western thought can be dis- cerned by the Universal Frame of Reference as presently constructed. This leads me to a final question. How much of a people's conception of space can be ana- lyzed through semantics? Metaphorical and other deeply symbolic meanings may not be pos- sible to disclose at the semantic level. This seems to be one of the critical points symbolic anthropologists make about the field of cognitive anthropology. It is certainly a legitimate issue to raise regarding Pinxten's Universal Frame of Reference. It is not an appropriate criticism for the entire book, though, because Pinxten em- ploys more than semantics and the universal frame to construct a Navajo conception of space; he considers meanings of terms in the context of Navajo natural philosophy and life and does it very well.
