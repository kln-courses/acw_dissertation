Articles and Notes I. Contributions should be sent to the Editor, Professor M.G. Fulford, Dept. of Archaeology, University of Reading, Whiteknights, PO Box 218, Reading, RG6 2AA; please note that from I January I999 contributions should be sent to the new Editor Dr L.J.F. Keppie, Hunterian Museum, University of Glasgow, Glasgow GI2 8QQ. The typescript should include the author's name at the beginning and address at the end. 2. Submission of articles/notes on computer disk is usual. A clean print-out should also be supplied for editorial use; this should be on A4 paper, printed on one side only, in double spacing throughout (including footnotes), with generous margins all round. The disk and hard copy should be identical with no corrections to be made. Disks should be new and clearly marked with the word-processing system used; all file names should be listed. Editing is done using Word 97 but disks using other standard systems may be submitted. IBM compatible disks are preferred but the Society can arrange the translation of Mac disks. Since conversion may result in the loss of some formatting (e.g. the loss of endnotes) it is recommended that whenever possible authors output on to the disk in Word. Britannia style should be followed but complex layout should not be attempted. Justify left-hand margin only. Notes will appear as footnotes but should be presented as endnotes - preferably in a separate file. The bibliography for the paper should also be submitted as a separate file. Tables usually need rekeying; they should be supplied in a separate file and a clear print-out on separate sheets should be provided. Figure and table positions should be noted in the margin of the print- out. 3. On submission papers should be complete in every particular. Every alteration made by an author in proof means higher production costs. The Society retains the right to charge authors for corrections/additions in proof in excess of ?I a page. Printer's errors are marked separately and the costs do not fall on the Society. All proof corrections and additions are subject to the jurisdiction of the Editorial Committee. 4. Unless there are exceptional circumstances first proofs only will be submitted to contributors. 5. For style refer to previous copies of Britannia but note change to referencing system from 1998. 6. Publications are to be cited by the author's name and the year of publication followed by the specific page or pages in a numbered footnote (e.g. Jones I980, 6-9). The full reference to a publication is to be given in an alphabetical bibliography at the end of the paper. Page references should only be given in the footnote if the reference is to a specific page or pages. Full page references of articles etc. should appear in the bibliography - f. and ff. should not be used to indicate following pages. Authors' initials should only appear in the footnotes if the bibliography contains two or more authors with the same surname (e.g. J. Smith 199o). For joint authorship give both names, for multiple authorship et al. is acceptable in the footnotes but all authors should be listed in the bibliography. a, b, c etc. should be used to distinguish several works of the same year (e.g. Smith 1990oa). Historical sources should appear in abbreviated form in the footnotes with full references in the bibliography. Bibliographical abbreviations should be in a consistent form, based for example on the CBA Archaeological Bibliography. Examples of bibliographic entries: Frere, S.S. 1972: Verulamium Excavations I, Reports Res. Comm. Soc. Antiqs. 28, London Frere, S.S., and St Joseph, J.K.S. 1983: Roman Britain from the Air, Cambridge Johns, C. 1996: 'The classification and interpretation of Romano-British treasures', Britannia 27, 1-16</page><page sequence="10">X11ii NOTES FOR CONTRIBUTORS Wacher, J. 1989: 'Cities from the second to fourth centuries', in M. Todd (ed.), Research on Roman Britain 1960-1989, Britannia Monograph I I, 91-114 7. Illustrations The type area of a page in Britannia measures 198 by 140 mm. All drawings should be designed to be reduced to or within such a space. Folding plans are expensive (c. ?400 each) and are often an avoidable extravagance. Scales in metres should be provided on plans and be long enough for any likely use. Illustrations do not need to be titled, captions can contain this information. Plate pages will have the same dimensions. Half-tone illustrations should be submitted as glossy black and white prints. Use of colour plates and colour overlays is expensive and must be discussed with the Editor on submission. 8. Contributors will be given 20 offprints of articles and Io of notes gratis. Additional copies may be ordered at cost price. II. Roman Britain in 19xx (a) Inscriptions I. For objects found south of the Mersey-Humber line information should be sent to M.W.C. Hassall, Institute of Archaeology, 31-34 Gordon Square, London WCIH OPP and for objects found north of that line to Dr R.S.O. Tomlin, Wolfson College, Oxford oX2 6UD, as soon as the inscribed material is ready for reporting, or at latest before I April of the year following discovery. See (b) 2a-f below for details required. 2. When photographs are taken the light should be raking and, where possible, from the left and well above the horizontal axis. 3. The principles which are followed for the inclusion or exclusion of inscriptions on pottery and tiles are set out in RIB I, p. xvii, s.v. scope (d) 1-4. (b) Sites and discoveries I. Information about sites explored and finds other than inscriptions should be sent to Dr A.S. Esmonde Cleary, Dept. of Ancient History and Archaeology, University of Birmingham, Birmingham BI5 2TT (a.s.esmonde-cleary@bham.ac.uk) (for England), Dr B.C. Burnham, Faculty of Arts, St David's University College, Lampeter SA48 7ED (for Wales) or Dr L.J.F. Keppie, Hunterian Museum, University of Glasgow, Glasgow GI2 8QQ (for Scotland), before I April of the year following discovery. 2. Notes on excavations should be clear summaries of the results obtained, supported by sufficient evidence (reference to dating material, significant stratification etc.) to be convincing, without going into the full detail of a published report. Correspondents should be careful to include the following details: (a) Location of site, including parish and National Grid Reference; (b) Name of director(s) of excavations; (c) Society or other body sponsoring excavation (where applicable); (d) Name of draughtsman/photographer responsible for any illustrations submitted; (e) Any previous exploration of the site; (f) Recent and forthcoming publications. 3. Dimensions should be given in Systeme Internationale units, e.g. metres (m), kilometres (km), hectares (ha), grammes (g). Non-metric equivalents may also be given where useful for comparison with earlier data. 4. Complimentary copies of 'Roman Britain in 19xx' are sent to correspondents whose drawings or photographs have been published in that issue. Copies can also be obtained by purchase from Dr H. Cockle, The Roman Society, Senate House, Malet Street, London, WCIE 7HU.</page><page sequence="11">Proceedings of the Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies 1997-8 The Annual General Meeting of the Society was held at 12.30 p.m. on Saturday, 20 June 1998 in Aberdare Hall, University of Wales Cardiff. The President, Dr Averil M. Cameron, FBA, FSA, was in the chair and welcomed members and non-members to the second AGM to be held outside London. On the Society's behalf she thanked Professor John Percival, FSA for his help in arranging the meeting in Cardiff, and the Warden and staff of Aberdare Hall for the domestic arrangements. Dr Cameron presented the Report of the Council for 1997, and drew attention to its most important item, the successful completion of the move of the Hellenic and Roman Societies and their Library to new premises in the Senate House of the University of London. The President thanked in particular the Society's Librarian, Mr Colin Annis, for his exemplary patience in organizing the Library's move. On the proposal of Professor S. Mitchell, FSA, seconded by Mr G.C. Dick, the Report of the Council for 1997 was accepted and approved. Mr G.E.A. Kentfield, Hon Treasurer, presented the accounts for 1997, full copies of which were available at the meeting. He noted that although the year had ended with a deficit of around ?20,000, as against a surplus of ?16,ooo in 1996, the net position over the last five years showed a small surplus of around ?4,000. The Society's overall financial position was healthy, but a further predicted deficit in 1998 would probably mean a rise in subscriptions in 2000. The meeting accepted and approved the accounts for 1997 on the proposal of Sir Arthur Hockaday, seconded by Mrs P. Gilbert. Council was authorized to agree the remuneration of the auditors, on the proposal of Mrs C. Waite, who was seconded by Dr G.B. Greatrex. Shipleys were re-appointed auditors for 1998 on the proposal of Mrs R.H. Niblett, seconded by Mrs P.M. Flowers. Dr R.D. Hackney proposed and Mr G.C. Dick seconded Council's nominations for election: as President for 1998-2001 the Rev. Professor J.S. Richardson, FRSE; as Vice-Presidents for 1998-9 the existing Vice-Presidents and Dr Averil Cameron, as Hon. Treasurer and Hon. Secretary for the same period Mr G.E.A. Kentfield and Mrs E. Matthews respectively; and as Council members for 1998-200I Dr R.E. Ash, Miss A.J. Claridge, Dr E.G. Clark, Dr K.J. Clarke, Dr I.P. Haynes, Professor S.J. Keay, Professor R.R.R. Smith and Professor L.M. Whitby. They were all declared elected. No other business was brought forward in accordance with the Articles of Association. Professor M.H. Crawford and Mr Kentfield paid warm tribute to Dr Cameron's distinguished Presidency, especially her hard work in steering the Society through the negotiations and arrangements for the move. Dr Cameron reminded members that the third Roman Archaeology Conference would take place in the University of Durham from Friday, 16 to Sunday, 18 April 1999, and that the AGM in 2000 would be held in The Queen's University of Belfast. The AGM was followed by a buffet lunch and a most successful visit, blessed by warm sunshine, to the Roman Legionary Fortress at Caerleon. The Society records its thanks to Mr R.J. Brewer, FSA and Dr P.V. Webster, FSA for organizing and leading the tour, and the National Museums and Galleries of Wales, and Cadw: Welsh Historic Monuments for granting free admission to the site.</page><page sequence="12">I.

WINNINGTON-INGRAM TRAINEE LIBRARIAN POST The Joint Library of the Hellenic and Roman Societies, run in conjunction with the library of the Institute of Classical Studies, is recognised as a premier international research library in Classics. A fund has been established in memory of Professor R. P. Winnington-Ingram, formerly Director of the Institute and Professor of Greek at King's College London, to raise ?250,000 to secure the annual Library Traineeship in perpetuity. This post helps to keep the Library open six days a week, including Saturdays and evenings, thus catering particularly for readers outside London and its university. The Fund has already attracted donations of over ?210,000. If you would like to help the Fund to reach its final target, please send your contribution to the Librarian, Institute of Classical Studies, Senate House, Malet Street, London WC1E 7HU.</page><page sequence="29">PERIODICALS BACK NUMBERS Journal of Roman Studies ISSN 0075-4358 LVIII, LX-LXIII, LXVI, LXXII-LXXVIII (1968, 1970-3, 1976, 1982-8): ?15/US$30 - individuals, ?16/US$32 - institutions, ?21/US$42 - booksellers LXXIX (1989): ?17/US$34 - individuals, ?18/US$36 - institutions, ?25/US$50 - booksellers LXXXI-II (1991-2): ?20/US$40 - individuals, ?25/US$50 - institutions, ?30/US$60 - booksellers LXXXV-VII (1995-7): ?25/US$50 - individuals, ?30/US$60 - institutions, ?36/US$72 - booksellers Indexes to vols XXI-XL &amp; XLI-LX (1931-50 &amp; 1951-70): ?5/US$10 each Britannia ISSN 0068-113X II-VIII (1971-7): ?7.50/US$15 - individuals, ?8/US$16 - institutions, ?10/US$20 - booksellers XI-XIV (1980-3): ?12/US$24 - individuals, ?13/US$26 - institutions, ?18/US$36 - booksellers xv-xIx (1984-8): ?15/US$30 - individuals, ?16/US$32 - institutions, ?21/US$42 - booksellers xxI (1990): ?17/US$34 - individuals, ?18/US$36 - institutions, ?25/US$50 - booksellers xxII-xxIV (1991-3): ?20/US$40 - individuals, ?25/US$50 - institutions, ?30/US$60 - booksellers xxv-vIII (1994-7): ?25/US$50 - individuals, ?30/US$60 - institutions, ?36/US$72 - booksellers All prices per vol.
