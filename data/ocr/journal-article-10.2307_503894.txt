<plain_text><page sequence="1">IO'S NAME ON A CORINTHIAN ARYBALLOS In a recent Archaeological Note M.G. Kanowski re- examines the inscription usually read as FOYX on an Early Corinthian aryballos.1 The narrative scene on this little, late-seventh-century vase, of which only the careful drawings survive, presents Herakles' Labor against the Lernaean Hydra. With a sword Herakles attacks a nine-headed hydra from left, while Athena seconds him from behind and Iolaos, harpe in hand, advances from right. This group is flanked on either side by a horse-drawn chariot, that on the right manned by Lapythos. In addition to goddess and men (all identified by name), Athena's owl and Hera's crab (both unlabelled), is figured a human-headed bird poised on the left-hand chariot, near the letters that have resisted decipherment. When Humphrey Payne commented on the inscrip- tions, he expressed himself with perhaps unintended wit: The first, written by a siren, has defied explana- tion. Kretschmer . . . takes it for nonsense, which is unlikely in a context of perfectly intelligible in- scriptions. . . . Mayer's suggestion . . . , followed by Harrison ... , that Foks can = ~Ouv, a diver, is far fetched and intrinsically improbable, as si- rens have none of the characteristics of aquatic birds.2 But Kanowski in turn rejects, along with at least two further proposals, Payne's own conclusion, with Weicker, that pFOV may simply be a lost archaic word. Instead, he accepts Renato Arena's persuasive reading of the supposed F as a Corinthian E; one could well compare the closely similar form of the epsilon in P FAM OM as Priam's name is spelled on a Mid Co- rinthian bottle in Athens. At this point he makes bold to posit the fading of the tail of a P where examiners of our vase when it still survived saw 0, the com- plete loss of a tv above the "siren's" head, and the reading of the word from left to right as M Y P3 IV for YYPHN. To deal with these points in order, (i) the omicron was apparently seen as circular, unlike the top of the P adduced as evidence in BBPAK A BM (2) the standard drawing of the vase, omitting as it does the horizontal lines that limit the scene above, shrouds the fact that space for a Iv never really ex- isted; (3) and most important, though the identifica- tions of Iolaos and Lapythos are also written left to right, there the individual letters invariably face for- wards (as without fail they do in the retrograde words also), while in this case both the letters in which bi- lateral symmetry does not prevail, upsilon and epsilon, would have to be interpreted as written backwards. At this point I hope merely to have ruled out the reading Yvpl(v) and with it the alleged evidence for an etymology of siren that derives it from the same root as that for avplw, as if the praeternatural birds symbolized "the wailing of the rising storm in the cordage."3 But to stop at destructive criticism without offering a viable alternative would be to forego a modest increment to the sum of Greek myth. Without assuming that any letters of the word have been lost or mistaken, I read FOYM retrograde as the 1 M.G.

In the first place and on good authority we are informed that the names of the figures repre- sented may be written indifferently in the nominative or genitive on the same vase, though in most of the cases cited a certain distinction seems traceable; now it is MevtAaoa vis-ai-vis the corpse of ['Ax]tAEo0, now an apparition of 'A4po8Lrqg to Ato/q8'68 and Alvia', now the principals AKTAION, APTEMIX AYXA observed by a Zeus (AIOI) who takes no part in the action.5 It is to this figure of Zeus as spectator that Io at the scene of Herakles' Lernaean Labor might seem to correspond most closely, though neither the JtSog with which Kretschmer proposed to complete such genitives, nor the alK4V Of Pfuhl and Beazley,6 quite satisfies since we would presumably be dealing with a manifestation in human-headed bird form of Herakles' ancestress: lo hovers over the field of action here as she is pictured brooding over the events of Aischylos' Suppliant Women. In the Prometheus Bound itself not only is Herakles' descent from Io twice made ex- plicit (vv. 771-74 and 871-72), but the geographical associations of lo's origins are also reiterated: Night visions kept . .. exhorting, '... Go, child, to Lerna's meadow, deep in grass, to where your father's flocks and cattle stand that Zeus's eye may cease from longing for you.' (646-47, 652-54) Later Io reports, Pricked on by the sharp biting gadfly, leaping in frenzied jumps I ran beside the river Kerchneia, good to drink, and Lerna's spring. (676-78)7 When the immortalized Herakles appears at the end of Sophokles' Philoktetes, it is his t'3e as the playwright specifies; but that must have been fully anthropomorphic. On the other hand, (5pvcg) with 'Ioi3 can not be understood so simply as with 'A0ava, had the goddess' name been added near the owl-headed bird on the reins of the chariot behind Athena. At this point one may well ask why lo should be figured in bird-form at all. The avian species con- nected with Io at least in name is the rpoxtAog, since, an Hesychian entry records, Io Kallithyessa (Kallithea in Schol. Arat. I6I), the first Argive priestess of Hera, bore Trochilos, inventor of chariots. It is thus momen- tarily tempting to see Trochilos in the hybrid form that perches on the horse goad and corresponds posi- tionally to the charioteer Lapythos on the opposite side of the composition; after all, though the bird's human head is long-haired, ribanded, and unbearded, the same goes for Iolaos. Yet, even with a Trochilos- Lapythos equation, Athena would still disrupt any strict right-left symmetry in the scene. Further, it would be hard to demonstrate the relevance of (K40po3) 'Iosk to the Lernaean Labor, since Trochilos does not figure in Herakles' genealogy. Finally, if the label was intended to identify Trochilos whom we might imagine as Athena's charioteer before his metamorphosis and Nike's succession, we should expect to read TpoxAov, not 'Io3. Be that as it may, the fact that the Crocodile Bird or Egyptian Plover was called rpoxlAo3 might at least point us in the right direction. For Otto Keller identi- fies the Green Plover (Vernellus cristatus) as the model in nature for the Egyptian soul-bird." This is not the place to consider whether or when the Egyptian artist, graphically rendering the Ba-concept, may have influenced his Aegean counterpart to rep- resent the soul freed from the body as a human-headed bird.9 It is noteworthy that the Ba or manifestation of Isis, with whom Io came to be identified, was pic- tured now in falcon or kite, now in swallow form.10 But exciting though it would be to find in our scene far the earliest trace of Egyptian influence on the Io myth," the actual situation is, I believe, much simpler. Strikingly enough, our bird turns her human head right round, a motion for which the wryneck is espe- 4Cf., in addition to PPFAMOM already cited, A(ETPF~ TAIV,AEFAM,AEMYVA:EVOM: Payne (supra n. 2) I64.

R.M. Cook's dating of this sort of Rhodian oinochoe to the second quarter of the seventh century B.C. (Greek Painted Pottery [London I960] 227) would mean that on Rhodes the notion of soul-birds antedates Peisandros's account of the Lernaean Hydra (included in his Herakleia as Paus. 2.37.4 confirms). That in turn Peisandros's epic reached Corinth, then in close commercial contact with Rhodes, in time to in- spire the painter of our aryballos is just possible, since "the lowest ancient estimate, that the Rhodian flourished . . . ca. 648 B.C., may not have been far wrong": G.L.

Tzetzes ad Lyc. 310 and Nikephoros Gregoras, Schol. in Synesium de insomniis, col. 539 Migne CXLIX. I owe this reference indirectly to D'A.W. Thompson, A Glos- sary of Greek Birds, 2nd ed. (Oxford 1936) 128, who thinks it "quite possible that i6 and rvy? are after all cognate, though the bird's cry had nothing to do with their etymology." Even if 1 does not reproduce the iynx's note, its derivative lw0' is used of a variety of sounds. A. Athanassakis, "The Word iwj7 in Homer and Hesiod," AJP 89 (1968) 77-82, moreover, has recently distinguished iwj(iW' "sound" from Fiw7j related to FIwK'7 "drive, onrush." This distinction would account for the absence of F on our vase, at the same time that it ex- plains why FLto' occurs on several Corinthian vases. Though S. Eitrem, "Io," RE 9 (1916) 1740, cites these occurrences of FLo'L in seeking an etymology for 'Io', the form seems always to identify a Nereid, and Arena's association of it with Ftlegat: FLdKEL corresponds to Athanassakis' Fiw?' : FIWK?6. 13 P. Amandry, "Skyphos Corinthien du Muste du Louvre," MonPiot 40 (1944) 29 and pls. III-IV; see further R. Arena, "Le iscrizioni corinzie su vasi," MemLinc, Cl. di sci. mor., stor. e filol., Ser. VIII, 13 (1967) 81, no. 4 (Amandry's own parallel, 'AXtXXeo6s, on a Corinthian cup in Brussels, is best explained otherwise). 14 The hybrid figure of Io on the red-figure oinochoe in Boston conceivably has a remote ancestor in the so-called Kentauris, painted on a larnax of apparently LH IIIB date, that T. Spyropoulos discovered at Tanagra (Ergon i971 [1972] 13-15, fig. 12). The "lady centaur" seems rather bovine than equine in shape, markings and tail, while the flanking dogs bring to mind the etymological derivation of Argos, lo's clas- sical keeper, from argos meaning "dog" (R. Carpenter, "Argei- phontes: a Suggestion," AIA 54 [1950] 178-79). Mycenaean traces in Boeotia of the Io-myth would be the less surprising as Io comes near the head of the longest of Greek mythical genealogies and as Tanagra lies opposite Euboea, named- according to Hesiod, fr. 296 (M. &amp; W.)-for theriomorphic Io, whose further associations with this corner of Greece are listed by Engelmann in Roschers Lexikon, s.v. Io, col. 265. If this proposal-made with due regard for the difficulty of identify- ing subjects of classical myth in Mycenaean art-should prove attractive, Spyropoulos's characterization of his excavations as a landmark would gain a new dimension: "Thus Tanagra provides evidence not only of a continuity of style but of cus- tom into a later period" (Archaeology 25 [1972] 207; cf. p. 206 for equine renderings on another Tanagran larnax).</page></plain_text>
