<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Rhesus Monkey Infant's First Four Months. 1979. Produced by Sylvia Howe. The Penn- sylvania State University, Audio Visual Services, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802. Patricia Hurley Hays Rhode Island College Even in the final seconds as credits flash silently upon the screen, explicit acknowledg- ment that this film is based on research at the Madingley Rhesus colony at Cambridge Univer- sity does not appear. The failure to note the location of the research colony is indicative of the attention given to the physical environment. Although, by comparison, the social environ- ment receives more extensive treatment, much useful information is never provided. Demo- graphic parameters for the group as a whole are lacking. Such basics as head count and age-sex composition of the cage are left to inference, and references to genealogical relationships among animals are introduced only as bio- graphical notes. Clearly, this is a film with a rather narrow focus. Its goal is to document the social develop- ment of a single Rhesus infant during his first four months of life. Simple black and white titles separate events recorded before birth and during the first, fourth, sixth, twelfth, and six- teenth weeks of life. The adaptation of focal animal observational techniques for the camera directs viewer attention to the rapid transforma- tion of Brian, the infant Rhesus, from popular pet besieged by "aunts" to playful pest, learning the meaning of rejection.

The infre- quency of references to deviations from behavior characteristic of Rhesus monkeys in the wild suggests that naturalism is sufficiently well approximated so that such contrasts are largely unnecessary. Subsequent discussion of this premise may challenge the student au- dience to think out some of the fundamental questions in behavioral research. A real strength of the film is in serving as a springboard for discussion of both methodology and primate social maturation. Toward this end, the film may be shown with or without narration. Since titles supply chronological order and natural sounds have not been incorporated, the sound track is not essential. Once background data have been ob- tained, students may sharpen their observa- tional skills by switching off the sound and watching the action unburdened by auditory distractions. The bulk of the footage is excellent despite the visual annoyance of chain-link fencing separating photographer and subjects. Occa- sionally sequences are a bit dark but actions are always clearly visible. Close-ups capture the in- timacy of the mother-infant bond and permit evaluation of physical changes in the maturing infant. The narration, presumably furnished by Sylvia Howe, elaborates the major events seen on screen, but offers few interpretive remarks. Technical language is infrequent; however, the blending of phrases such as "go ventral-ventral" with anthropomorphic musings is, at times, bothersome. In light of the film's potential for addressing contemporary theoretical concerns, especially issues within sociobiology, A Rhesus Monkey's First Four Months will disappoint some viewers. However, those searching for a purely descrip- tive film about primate social development or instructors who employ film to train students in observational techniques may discover that this chronicle of the early life of Brian meets their needs. :::r??miil'~iiiiiijlilililiilil)r)iijl :i'!tiijliiiliil!l':iil~lllldlll5illl i~~i~~iiii?Sii`i'i.i~iriilCiii~:~ar~B~ i~~iZ~Cii ::: i(lidii9iiii :; iii~ii:r~~e: ~~B~ (if: :~:~r;~:~jil:ii~~i:i::::::::;::: ~i~ii~iiii~ ?:?:?;-?:?:?-???:????

It could be the most radical and provocative of recent books reflecting on fieldwork, the defining experi- ence/method of the discipline. "-Renato Rosaldo, Stanford University Has anthropology betrayed its purpose by embracing either secure scientific detachment or narrow subjectivity? Kevin Dwyer's unorthodox response to this question pro- vides both an absorbing account of rural Moroccan life and a convincing demonstration of a radically different, dialogue-based approach to anthropological fieldwork. $28.50 TheJohns Hopkins University Press Baltimore, Maryland 21218</page></plain_text>
