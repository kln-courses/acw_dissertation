Having had dull experience with this style of composition, the French critics have hit upon a classification, with an unwritten wealth of connotation, as materiaux pour servir. It contains in full measure the material upon which the history of Afghanistan may be written. It bears every mark of careful re: search, of collation of a great number of rare and almost inaccessible documents, of accurate presentation of both sides of moot questions. An introduction by Sir Mortimer Durand is indicative of the appreciation in which the author's diligence is regarded by that high authority; yet Sir Mortimer does not wax enthusiastic over the result, nor does he agree entirely upon all points. In manner lacking the least spark of that dash with which the Afghan tribesmen have made their inroads upon the history of India, the matter of this volume is entitled to the most serious consideration. Very little has yet been discovered as to the genetic source of the Afghans, probably it will be little more than a pamphlet in the history of inner Asia, but an inordinate amount of space is given to the discussion of an origin from the lost ten tribes of Israel; even the missionaries have given over the attempt to write that professional mystery of their art into serious ethnography. But when the author arrives at the period of documented history he gives a concise summary of the campaigns of different Afghan rulers directed upon Persia on one frontier and upon India on the other, showing particularly the result this activity had upon the consolidation of an Afghan state. In the most modern period he is obscure, probably of political design, upon the status of Afghanistan as the buffer between Russia and England at the scientific frontier. WILLIAM CHURCHILL. Afghanistan: The Buffer State. Great Britain and Russia in Central Asia. A Comprehensive Treatise on the Entire Central Asian Question. By Capt. Gervais Lyons. With an Introductory Note by Sir Reginald C. Hart. vii and 232 pp. Maps* and index. Luzac &amp; Co., London, I910. 7s 6d. 8? x 5Y. From the time when Semiramis, Queen of Assyria, invaded India, there has been a Central Asian question, and during most of these years it has been a very complex one. A book, then, which attempts to explain the various stages and results of past invasions and the present diplomatic intrigue is valuable, and, in view of the recent disputes in Persia, enlightening; yet inasmuch as it is written by an Englishman, a representative of one of the countries in this border-land strife, one must expect to find the trend of the book favorable to the English occupancy of the Iranian plateau. The book opens with a statement of the English point of view, to wit, that Persia, Afghanistan and Western China remain independent and favorable to the British, that the Bosphorus be closed to Russia and that Russia be prohibited a port on the Persian Gulf. The value of India to the British government is given in detail, and the means of protection along the frontier of that country and the distribution and occupation * Listed under "Asia" and "The Nearer East" in Bull., Vol. 44, No. 2, Feb., gI92, pp. I57 and 158, respectively. 215</page><page sequence="2">Geographical Literature and Maps of the army of defense are indicated. The whole chapter is permeated with the expectation of a clash with Russia for the possession of India. In succeed- ing chapters, the past invasions of India and the progress of Russia in Central Asia are rehearsed. Following this review of events, the author attempts to explain the Russian point of view concerning an advance into India, and while he tries to present both sides fairly, the bogy of the advancing enemy is always present. The author describes the theater of operations which includes the lowland of Turan, the Central Asian mountain region and the plain of the Indus; and he describes the paths, railroads and trails intersecting the area, the condition and high water time of the streams and lists the passes into India. Following are chapters on the countries and peoples of this area and a state- ment of the present distribution of the Russian army in Central Asia. The book contains much valuable information. R. M. BROWN. Aspects of Religious Belief in Babylonia and Assyria. By Morris Jastrow, Jr. xxv and 47I pp. Map, 54 ills., chronological lists of the rulers of Babylonia and Assyria, and index. G. P. Putnam's Sons, New York, I9II. 8x5s. The prime appeal of Dr. Jastrow's book is to the students of comparative religion. Yet it is interesting to see how much of the work bears upon the geography of the Euphrates Valley, an unexpected yet on second thought wholly natural result of the fact that any work of such ripe scholarship must be broad and not narrow, fecund and never jejune. At base, the story of the great gods must be the story of the greater men who believe in them, who, in a broader view, have created them anthropomorphic. Dr. Jastrow has addressed his conclusions to those students who are interested in the study of the growth of the divine idea out of a congeries of village, municipal and racial gods keeping even pace with the growth of the earliest civilization of which we have record. To the furth,erance of his object he draws extensively, always brilliantly, upon the store of literary material which fresh exploration is bringing to light in the Assyrian-Babylonian region and which is daily becoming better interpreted and better comprehended. Equally with divinity is geography revealed in the course of such study, the geography of folk movement and folk settlement. Out of this rich store we have space to note but one instance of this contribu- tion of theology to civic geography. Associated with the temples of the alluvial plain are found tower structures in courses, to which has been assigned the name zikkurats. These towers, the author points out, are the machinery of the worship of the mountain gods, the "high places" of Old Testament heresies, the Jacob's ladder of an earlier myth. Their presence in the plain and in the double delta argue a movement thereunto of settlement of a race of moun- taineers. We need not pursue the intricate yet convincing ingenuity of his argument in the establishment of the home land of this remote migration; it is enough to point out the method whereby the gods are made to trace out the archaic highways long ages after the wind has swept away even the dust by themselves contributed in which these ancient wanderers left their footprints. We note, however, that having served their end in this line of proof the zik- kurats, of which the Babel tower was a type, have survived without meaning in the religious architecture which gives to the mosque its minaret and to the cathedral its twin spires. It is as much pleasure as surprise to find that the cuneiform slabs of the temple records can be read to set forth the geography of Sumer and Akkad. The gods themselves have preserved the ancient land- marks of the time when the world was young. WILLIAM CHURCHILL. 216</page></plain_text>
