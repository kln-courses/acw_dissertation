By ANNE VIRGINIA CULBERTSON. Illustrated by E. Warde Blaisdell. Indianapolis: The Bobbs-Merrill Company, I904. Pp. 348. The author has collected from the negroes of southeastern Virginia and the Cherokee Indians of North Carolina fifty stories, of which twenty-three are negro and twenty-seven are Indian. Aunt 'Phrony, " Indian on the father's side and negro on the mother's," tells the Indian tales in negro dialect "in order more strongly to emphasize the resemblance between them, -so marked as to give rise to the supposition that one race bor- rowed from the other, though which, in that case, was originator and which borrower it would be difficult to say." The author concludes her short introduction by remarking "that these stories were all collected from persons well on in years, unable to read and without opportunity of access to books. They are confessedly 'edited,' for all who have collected folk-tales will know the crude form in which they are obtained, usually a bare, brief outline, though now and then one falls in with a genuine raconteur. The aim has been to imitate, as far as possible, the style of the latter, while jealously preserving the original outlines, so as not to impair their value as folk-lore. To those who would study the imagination of primitive peoples these stories should have some value, if for no other reason than that they add a few more to the stock of this class, the opportunities for gathering which grow less and less with each year and soon will cease altogether." It is a satisfaction to note the sympathy of Miss Culbertson for the scien- tific value of her data, after the slurring attempt to be funny with which Mr. Harris in the Introduction to " Uncle Remus and His Friends" 1 disposes of " those who think they know something " about folk-lore, the " Fellows of This and Professors of That, to say nothing of Doctors of the Other." Miss Culbertson has mastered the Virginia negro dialect with rare skill. One notes among many interesting negroisms, "' havishness " for behavior, " squatulate " for expostulate, "gnorrin " for gnawing, "oon " for won't, "sont " for sent, "sidesen " for besides, "atter " for after, "aggervex" for aggravate, and " li'l" for little. There are several good folk-songs like "Cindy Ann," p. 72, whose value would have been enhanced by the score, for we are more fortunate in our possession of negro tales than of the music with songs. As should be expected the rabbit is generally the hero, but instead of the Brer of Uncle Remus,' the Buh of Jones,2 or the very con- tracted B' of Edwards,8 in the Indian stories of Miss Culbertson it is the 1 Uncle Remus and His Friends, Boston, I892. 2 Negro Mythsfrom the Georgia Coast, Boston, 1888. 8 Bahama Songs and Stories, Memoirs of the American Folk-Lore Society, Boston, I895.</page><page sequence="2">Bibliographical Notes. 213 masculine Mistah Hyar', and in the negro tales the feminine 01' Molly Hyar' or Mis' Molly Cotton-tail. In fact, only a few times in the work does Brer occur in connection with any animal. There are a number of elements common to other collections, as for instance in Mr. Bear tends. Store for Mr. Fox, p. 194, where the guilty Mis' Molly Cotton-tail, who has been tied up for later punishment by Mistah Fox, persuades the innocent Mistah B'ar to take her place with the promise of a party which she represents that the fox will give. In Harris 1 and Edwards 2 the same situation is developed, but in connection with other animals. The faithful work of a conscientious collector in hearty accord with the aims and methods of folk-lore has given us in this book a valuable contri- bution to the mythology of the American negro, while Miss Culbertson with evident literary talent has framed the simple stories so attractively that the general reader will be delighted to follow the naive adventures of the Ani- mal Folks at the Big House. The very clever illustrations by Mr. E. Warde Blaisdell will add much to the charm of the book, especially for the children. C. L. E. NOTES ON RECENT ARTICLES OF A COMPARATIVE NATURE IN FOLK-LORE AND OTHER PERIODICALS. ART AND MAGIC. Reinach, S.: L'art et la magie i propos des peintures et des gravures de l'age du renne. (L'Anthropologie (Paris), 1903, xiv. 257-266.) Com- pares the "homceopathic magic " of man of the French reindeer period with the "magic" of the Australian aborigines. Primitive art is largely dependent on magic for its origin and development. CAT. Browne, C. E.: The Cat and the Child. (Pedag. Sem. (Worcester, Mass.), I90, xi. 3-29.) Gives results of questionnaire inquiry among school children. Contains some ethnographic and folk-lore material. Cats' funerals are discussed at pp. 25-27; numerous funeral ceremonies are described; and " by far the larger number of the dead pets are buried with more or less ceremony." Author thinks " the child's attitude toward the cat is largely anthropomorphic." The cat is twice as often a girl's pet as a boy's. See Dog. " CONJURING " VERMIN. De Cock, A.: Women en rupsen bezweren en aflezen. (Volkskunde (Gent), I903, xv. 129-137.) Treats of the customs and formula in use in various parts of Holland (and elsewhere in Europe) to " conjure " or drive away worms, caterpillars, etc. The means employed are petitions, writing, etc. " DEATH OF CAIN." Hamelius, P.: De dood van Kain in de Engelsche Mys- teriespelen van Coventry. (Volkskunde (Gent), 1903, xv. 49-59.) Discusses the sources;of the scene of Lamech and the young man, and concludes that the resem- blances between this play and the Balder legend do not indicate a common origin, but grew up in the course of the Middle Ages. German influence is to be sus- pected, as also in the York mystery-play. DOG. Bucke, W. F.: Cyno-Psychoses. (Pedag. Sem. (Worcester), 1903, x. 459-513.) Treats of "children's thoughts, reactions, and feelings toward pet dogs," as ascertained by the questionnaire method. Contains ethnological and 1 Nights with Uncle Remus; Myths, etc., Boston, 1883, pp. 187, 194, and Uncle Remus, etc., New York, I88I, pp. Ioo, I23. 2 L. c. pp. 63, 64.</page></plain_text>
