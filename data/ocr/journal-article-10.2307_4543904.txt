<plain_text><page sequence="1">344 XII.-A CONTROVERSY ON IMPORT. .by J. BRO UGII. Two years ago I was permitted to read to this Society a paper entitled " Some New EncyclopTdists on Logic," in which I reviewed the recently published and translated first volume of a proposed Encyclopoediia of Philosophky. Each contributor to that volume lhad attempted the outline of a logical system, or, at any rate, of a very comprehensive problem within an assumed system. And as the editorial preface seemed to invite the reader to find in the several pathways of discourse a convergence to unity, I reviewed them as possible contributions towards a special kind of unity and idea of Logic which was certainly outside that volume, and perhaps outside the currents and eddies of philosophic opinion altogether. This was the primitive idea of Logic: to know the way of ' right notions," as a stage on the way of "ultinmate blessedness"; a scheme for controlling knowledge as a factor in the vitality of our spiritual nature, through self-consciousness. British logicians were not represented in that volume, and I am glad to have been invited to review some currents of logical theory prevalent among ourselves, that are contributions to the same primitive enterprise of reflection. The occasion for such a review has been offered in the Symposiuin puiblished in last year's Proceedings of this Society, on the Import of Pro- positions. That Symposium was perhaps the more repre- sentative of the real drifts of our own reflection, because, instead of collectino essays in logical system, it focussed on one definite problenm the light which could be thrown from each of the three methods in Logic which are now most</page><page sequence="2">A CONTROVERSY ON IPll'ORT. 345 prevalent; a specially British fashion of resolving controversy. It is, perhaps, a hardship to the three chosen representatives of logical militancy, that on their high festival a vagrant should intrude to chat about the spoils and wounds of intellectual wvar, like the fop whom Hotspur flouted on the stricken field at Holmedon. Midway betweein Aristotle's day and our own, the problem of Imiport was presented to the world by Avicenna in the following form: A proposition is the disclosure of a relation between two thinags, with truth or falsity. Avicenna would seem to have been a humorist as well as a faithful expositor of Aristotle, had he foreseen that, after a tliousand years of progressive reflection, we should still be discussing the same kind of formula; and that one symposiast should be obsessed by the " relation," it is identity with difference; another, with the " things," they are determinations of reality as a systemii; and a third, by " truth or falsity," it is relative to personal experience. And 1, seeing the argumen- tative entanglements, . am mesmerised by the wonder of Avicenna's initial terin. How comes such a sheer incident as " disclosure " into the eternal plan for a spiritual nature ? How is it a priori possible that anyone should disclose any- thing ? And will it require another thousand years before our logical technique shall have adapted itself to a curiosity so esoteric as that which poses the logical enquiries ? A real Symposium, as literary form, is an improveinent on the make-believe Symposium now too common even in our text-books for elementary instruction, in which there is a continual " for " and ".against," but one man sustains the whole colloquy. Too often, like a quick-change artist, he passes between doctrine of " traditional logic" or of some unspecified (but not, as he tells us, unpaid) league of teachers, on the one hand, and his own free reason on the other; but without giving</page><page sequence="3">346 J. BROUGH. any opening for a test as to whether what he says in propric&amp; persona is on the same level of abstract intention as belonged originally to the doctrine he impersonates. He perhaps speaks persuasively on the level of psychological positivism against voices whose native reach is only on the level of normative aspiration, and there is no reply. -In a real Symposium the' pilgrim on the way of right notions may from time to time test whether his competitive instructors are within hail of each other. Fortunately also our present symposiasts, E. E. C. Jones, B. Bosanquet, and F. C. S. Schiller, have each explained their meanings in earlier and larger contexts; and at the first crucial bend in the way of right notions, the Import of Propositions, we can the more easily orientate with our own position the discrepancies of guidance which they offer. Symposia on detailed questions of positive science familiarise us with a similar task, when they have not yet found the true genus of explanation, for example, Is grey a colour ? Are eoliths of human workmanship ? But our present problem makes us aware of still wider options of relevant assertion than the genera of positive science. Hamilton distinguished phenomenology, nomology, and ontology. We seem to hear as to Import, not only words from a definite positive science, Psychology, and from a normative science, the Morphology of Knowledge, but from some energy of expression that can hardly be called assertion at all, and is not art or poetry, and yet llust. be listened to. Mr. Schiller does not pass beyond the natural sphere of, scientific assertion when he tells us that standard propositions do not express any actual meaning, but only a potential meaning (pp. 385-6); that their function is not normative, but only a natural consequence of actual meaning (p. 395); that actual meanings entail processes of selection determined by the reaction of some individual human soul upon some situation. in real life. Hence that the attempt to describe actual meanings in the fantastically artificial terms of a nornmative</page><page sequence="4">A CONTROVERSY ON IMPORT. 347 logic is foredoomed to failure (p. 395); and all that can be general in the import of propositions is that they are relevant to some context (p. 422). Is there, then, no personal good of which impersonal truth is a condition; no way of right notions except the multitudinous tracks our idiosyncrasy of thought tends to follow; no import of propositions, except their unchartered suggestiveness to each individual as they are uttered ? Thanks to the actuality of our own Symposium Mr. Bosanquet shows that the latter douibt is certainly misuse of even positive psychology. "We have inexhaustible stores of propositions in full use with the most complete and accurately known application and context, in literature, science and philosophy" (p. 415). So that a normative meaning in judg- m-ent, should this be possible, may be matched by a standard import of propositions. But can he rescue also the normative function itself from the iconoclasm of the psychologist who, according to Mr. Schiller in propria persona, " observes in actual thought the lapses of the personal thinker, and the influences of unconscious complexes and feelings " (p. 395), and only finds in propositions that they " apply to problems anid are formulated by persons in pursuit of their purposes" (p. 419) ? The traditional logician whom Mr. Schiller is not, but impersonates, and whom he " charitably supposes never in- tended the traditional account to have any relation to actual meaning" (p. 395)-this imposing marionette certainly will not rescue it; indeed is not intended to do so. Mr. Bosanquet seems to hope something from "Logic," if not from the traditional Logician. "The elaborate study of the actual effort to express meaning, and of its relative com- pletion in the degrees of truth, which forms, at least in my intention, the whole argument of my work on Logic . . . is an attempt to criticise actual meaning in. the light of the conditions of expression and the fundamental impulse of thought. . . . You must take account of actual meaning, but you must take account as well of such general needs as</page><page sequence="5">348 J. BROUGH. completeness and self-consistency. And I know of no other sense in which actual meaning and truth are disregarded by Logic" (p. 383). If thought can trust a fundainental impulse of its own, the pilgrim to blessedness need no longer wait for a pass signed by Psycholoay, or pause under psychological afterthouahts like that attributed to a shipwrecked sailor: "Save my soul if I have a soul !" Mr. Schiller, however, complains that Mr. Bosanquet not only, by refusing the psychology of the iindividual " depersonalises thouoht,'" but by aimiing at the normative, with picturesque anthropomorphism of language, " personifies logical entities, allows 'universals' to contract matrimonial alliances, and attributes volitional 'efforts' to propositions " (p. 394); and that the hypothesis of a " funda- mental impulse of thought" could hardly be formulated nowa- days except in biological terms, as, say, a will to live or an elan vital (p. 396). And this criticism-i is so far discouraging to the plain man, that even in Mr. Bosanquet's more constructive method, the method -not of actual symposium, nor of imaginary dialogue, but of methodical descriptionl of the ideal, the logical consciousness may not yet have found its adequate expression. Methodical description is the expression proper to knowledge of fact or of theories of fact; and we must not assume that it is a satisfactory expression for what is not knowledge, but only reflection on knowledge. Carlyle resorted occasionally to the imperative even for what is properly knowledge, " The infinite terror! Thou shalt believe in this! " The use of symbols, as begun by Aristotle, and applied by Miss Jones to our present problem, is a larger step than this towards similar things. For, symbols are at least capable of sugaesting to us aspirations of thought, as well as empirical facts. But they are used sparingly by Mr. Bosanquet in his great undertaking, to describe our " efforts to express meaning." And the formula of Miss Jones's thesis in the present Symposium, that S is P asserts Diversity of Intension in Identity of Denotation (p. 359),</page><page sequence="6">A CONTROVERSY ON IMPORT. 349 is not made more prepossessing, nor her use of Euler's circles for the scheme of Immediate and Mediate Inferences more con- vincing, through the absence of full verbal syntax. Symbolism may evade impeachments for either Anthropomorphism or Psychologic Positivism. But the evasion has its own trouble in it, which becomes almost an absolute bar when not only difference and identity, but such living energies as those she describes as "application " and "intension," are committed to the care of symbols by our modern logisticians. The symbols have Ino distinctive adaptation to that play of personality which is essential and relevant to genuine logic, in the act of know- ledge. They suggest facts or at least recorded results of thouaht, rather than the aspirations of thought itself. At the close of this paper I intend to revert to a primitive method of logical instruction adopted by the Hindoos, who have left us the earliest records. It consisted in the inven- tion - of technical terms and the definition and illustration of their meaning. I shall simply state what I mean by the tertmi " Import of Propositions "; and though I shall meanwhile proceed to appreciate, as well as I can, the distinctive doctrines of our symposiasts, it is only in order to help myself to such conceptions as may be most useful in a definition. It is not that the method of definition solves the problem as to modes of expression. It mnerely, with the consciousness of its own primitiveness, postpones the graver task which reflective evolu- tion must bring. It deprecates beforehand, though it cannot dissolve, the illusion created and froin page to pag,e sustained by the use either of the syntax or the symbolic equations appro- priate to science; the illusion, naamely, that logical doctrine is an addition to the sum of positive knowledge possessed by man- kind. I am not bound to submit myself to such contradiction or disproof as wouild be a proper reaction on the part of persons to whom scientific knowledge is offered; what I offer is a branch not of knowledge, but of culture. It is not even an expression of cultured imagination, like Music or Poetry, but</page><page sequence="7">350 J. BROUGH. of intellectual desire. The unfairest demand that can be made on logic is, that it should be " logical " in the popular sense in which sciences and other argumentative achievements are lotical-that is to say, are demonstrable or evidentiary. What is a fair demand, is that it shall brina into consciousness the relation of any known fact to the aspirations of the knower, and shall be fit for that educative function. Logic may be described as a Liturgy of thought, rather than a science or an art of thinking; and a liturgical rubric-suich as, say, the "general confession "-cannot be criticised as though it were an autobiography or magisterial investigation. The latest volume of the Encyclopoedia of Religion and Ethtics contains a brief article on "Logic," in the course of which I have tried to indicate some tests by which we may detect the vein of unspoken energy within the inevitable grossness of syntactical, symbolic or demonstrative formi, which is properly locgical. WTe may require of any doctrine which claims to be Logical that it shall be (1) reflective, as distinct from assertive, in its significance; (2) teleological or purposive in its principle; (3) a priori or independent in its authority; (4) theoretical rather than practical in its limitations; and (5) disciplinary, not objective, in its motive. How far Logical doctrine can in its development carry on it the veneer of "picturesqueness" is comparatively an unimportant question. I presume that Mr. Schiller does lnot forbid this device, seeing the ferment of it which Williamii James has intro- duced into Psychology, and the freedom of it which Mr. Schiller is able to indulge (I shall have occasion to quote a specimen presently) when making his psychological assertions. But anthropomorphism is a different matter. Doctrine that is psychological may be freely picturesque, because it is what might be called " introlative," expressing the things of the mind by reference to the things of the world; :but doctrines</page><page sequence="8">A CONTROVERSY ON IMPORT. 351 that are logical probably must also be anthropomorphic, because they constitute a reflective hesitancy, as it were, in that evolution of scientific thought which aims to transcend fntliropomorphism. They must be thankful to receive no harsher criticism from the scientific or sub-scientific level than that they are near akin to the vitalism in biology. But now, the normative Import of Propositions! What has the devotee of right notions to do with Propositions ? Proposi- tions are a social incident which he may or may not choose to elndure. The recluse may be as earnest in the discipline of his thought, as the conversationalist or the lover of print. Our national wordmonger, Dr. Johnson, when making some impromptu verses about the absolute good, felt it more natural, indeed, to give his pretended judgment rather through a " hermit hoar, in solemn cell," than through some debater from Fleet Street. It is scarcely enough that language is an instrument of thought, and that we must also use it if we are to describe thought. Nevertheless, Import is a bye-path on the way of right notions which must certainly be followed if we are to see where we are on this way itself. It is distinctively the Import of Propositions, and not the nature of Judgment, that must be now considered, though I hope to show that Import carries with it some corollaries as to the nature of Judgment. And if -we are to argue at all about logical doctrine, instead of defining like the Hindoos or dogmatisino like Carlyle, we must treat Import as a consequence from the nature of Judgment, such that logical intuition of the latter may be confirmed or reformed through its theory. A man may be a recluse if he so chooses, but his inward nature must be such that he can be social if he chooses. And Judgment we must suppose to be such that -it can be communicated as we actually see it communicated. And Miss Jones has done us all at least the service of persuading Mr. Bosanquet to bring his impressive theory of -Judgment, originating as it does on a deeper philosophical</page><page sequence="9">352 J. BROUGH. ground, to the practical verification, How does it explain) Import ? In using so ultra-metaphorical a conception as the Liturgy of thought, I intend only to escape durina the logical pilgrimage, internment at the hands of an aggressive psychology or an oppressive metaphysic, as by soine Giant Despair. In my previous paper before this Society, I said-" Logic is the discipline of the faculty of knowledge for its teleological function in our complete nature . . . If we are to name the teleological principle of our spiritual life as a whole we must call it Conscience." Thus the way may be kept open, by a teleological scheme of our complete nature. The Liturgy of thought must adapt itself to the condition laid down. by Mr. Schiller, that " the site in which meanings occur, the soil in which alone they are alive and actual, is always some human soul reacting and operating upon somue vital situation" (p. 396). Instead of using, this condition empirically, however, to " base our norms and 'ideals' on a patient study of actual processes," we must translate it normatively at the beginning, and simiiply restore to our Liturgy the ancient rubric of Motive. The reason why in my previous paper I could not accept the " Absolute Pragamatism ' adopted by Royce, which should guarantee the norms of thoucht through" modes of action that coniform to the same logical laws to which classes and propositionis conform," was that a " calculus of modes of action" would seem to give complete priority to a rubric of " Rational Will "; while in prinmitive logic, rubrics of Intellectual Faculty anid Cosmic Category take precedence. If we have rationality, it seems a certainty that we shall have will; but, were action to appear in the cosmos isolated, there seems no necessary cosmic occasion for the recovery of rationality. I asked, " Is there any allurement in Reason which persuades the Will to become rational, outside the inward need of out personality ?'&gt; And from such an inward need, the ultimate creative life issues directly in intellect. So that were the calculus of modes</page><page sequence="10">A CONT'ROVERSY ON IMPORT. 353 of action available, we could only use it to confirm and reassure the self-consciousness of thought, and to dissolve the mirages that from time to time may mislead our logical intuition. Following, then, the order of log,ical intuition, our liturgy miust begin with the rubric of Faculty, and through Categ,ory and Doubt reach Motive, where the direct inter- vention of Humanism is invited. The logical consciousnLess must begin its development, that is to say, by anl analysis of judgment, either direct or through the Import of Propositions. But though this is only a beginning, it must contain the potentiality and premonition of the subsequent rubrics. Mr. Bosanquet analyses that structure within Judgment, whereby it can hope to sustain the complete system of " our world," as Atlas might shoulder the heavens; Aristotle apparently sees in it the promise of a world to be conciliated rather than sustained, and one prior to any subjective interest. Such responsibility Judgment can disclaim, such negligence, reform. The properly logical analysis of the faculty of Judgment is not psychological, nor metaphysical, but is a unique kind of reflection, a logical intuition; and any person who does not assent to the method is simply above or below the sphere of logical fellowship-a claim which is not more arrogant than similar claims by the moral philosophers. Butler, in his sermons on human nature, professes to do no more than explain what he means by saying that virtue is nattural, if haply some hesitating reader may give assent to that way of speaking; and Sidgwick declares that if any person does not understand for hirnself the idea of " rightness " there is no way of conveying it. A disturbing incident, however, in the story of specifically logical intuition is that, while nearly all the logicians seem to accept imnplicitly, in some moment of intuition, the analysis of judgment into a purely existential unit and its characterisation, few have faith enough to hold it firmly against psychological explanation or metaphysical criticism. The "ultimate subject," as the Aristotelians named the unit,</page><page sequence="11">354 J. BROUGH. instead of remaining content to be defined by logical intuition, becomes a "focus of attention" in the psychological act of knowledge, or a fragment of system in the summary of cosmic being. "The subject," says Mr. Bosanquet, "will always :be Reality in one form, and the predicate reality in another form" (Essentials of Logic, p. 41). Aristotle himself, proceeding to expound the rubric of the Categories, although defining them as kinds of predicate, yet, in discussino Substance and contrasting the second substance with the primary, identified this latter with the ultimate subject previously found in the faculty of judgment. And here the nemesis of weakness is that, if so, the ultimate subject which our Faculty accepts as an existential unit and nothing, more appears metaphysically as infinitely rich in potential *characteristics. The Faculty accepts it as uncharacterised, reality presents it as exhaustively characterised. Shall our logical intuition be thus discredited, and be treated as an irrelevant lapse into psychological observation, and perhaps be replaced by a metaphysical expansion of our objective; until this becomes the complete system of the world ? " I take it," says Mr. Bosanquet, " that in denotation there -is intension, only the intension is auxiliary to identification, as in a proper namie, and not regarded for its own sake" (p. 377). " I believe that every proposition possesses in principle the two sides of affirming a fact, and of laying down a law of universal connection. All the main types of proposition are produced, as it seems to me, by the struggle of these two tendencies, and the degrees in which either gets the upper hanid or the two beconme harmoniously fused" (p. 302). Then how does it come to pass that the slightest shifting of mere time or place, or the most impartial exchange of personal units within the express content of a subject that is to be characterised, can alter so profoundly the impending significance? Why should deniotative intension be so peremptory as compared with predicative ? The puritan of Mr. Bosanquet's story, when</page><page sequence="12">A CONTROVERSY ON IMPORT. 355 in his argument with the latitudinarian he was told, "Your God is my devil," is not expected to merge his two subjects, but rather to differentiate at all costs his characterisations; while the Jewish king who, after the prophet's parable, was told " Thou art the man," must assimilate two different charac- terisations. If, as Mr. Bosanquet says, the formal copula in a. proposition represents not sameness, but connection, not an existential unification) but that something " spells " something (p. 379), then how comes it that so slight a turn in a lettering produces such a vast change in a word? And why is this " auxiliary " function of intension so dominant that, without it, intension " for its own sake " would cease to exist ? Our intuition is saved mainly by the rubric which Aristotle and most subsequent logicians have neglected. For Motive implies that Judgment is an energy whose function is defined in Will. And in Will there can be no room for any outcome that is not finite and pluralistic. Each volition terminates on a point of objectivity; we may contemplate all tinle and existence; we can only originate some event, we can only change some substance, at some point in space and at some moment of time. The He or It may, if we please, be woven into a scheme of categories or a hierarchy of existential systems. But so far as this is done the logician has suspended his distinctive function, which is to express the preparation which judgment is making for its outcome in practical life. The strictly logical intuition of judgment is, that it characterises existential items with a view to distinctive emnotional or manipulative reactions; and it can only carry forward its characterisations into the place and moment for ultimate reaction, if it has already isolated the inembers of existential plurality. On this level of theory, we are part way, though not all the way, to the general import of propositions commended to us by Miss E. E. C. Jones; namely, an identity of application, along with a diversity of intension, between two forms. We are not all the way, especially as Miss Jones claims to substitute at z</page><page sequence="13">356 J. BROUGH. will the word " denotation " for " application," and so accents a special and less personal significance. The problem of the import for propositions thus includes a further question, the answering of which introduces a new rubric; one latent indeed throughout the history of Logic, and colouring all the (loctrine, but now needing a more definite and separate accentuation. It may be entitled " Interpretation." The plain man who pursues the analysis of his faculty of judgment under the order of topics in the more methodical Aristotelian text-books, must be prepared for a shock of bewilderment and perhaps a permanent distrust, before he reaches the organisation of syllogistic forms, and as he passes through these to the exposition of scientific ideals, and finally of controversial methods. It is natural that logical intuition should distinguish in judgment the predicates which stand in antithesis to the ultimate subject, sometimes called attributives, from those which now appear as predicates, now undertake to "represent" ultimate subjects, and are expressed by our concrete nouns; and these again from those which seem to have outgrown their predicative function, and to pose as pure points in an artificial realm of predicative possibilities, and are expressed by our abstract nouns. And again, when we begin to trace the differentiation of our predicates as a premonition of scientific method, we recognise genus, species, and differentia, the forward-feeling tendrils, as it were, of aspiration, which Aristotle describes as predicables. All this is an analysis of predicates, and the ultimate subjects stand aside as having had their turn. And suddenly the ultimate subjects are dragged forward without any express warrant to distiinguish property from accident. An "accident" is not a special kind of predicative idea in the light of scientific promise, but one which fails to reciprocate with its conceptual subject; to reciprocate, that is, the secondary function acquired by attributives, of " representing" a given area of ultimate subjects- their " suppositio." The " property " is " convertible " with the</page><page sequence="14">A CONTROVERSY ON IMPORT. 357 subject, the " accident " is not. This sudden emphasis on limits of denotation in a theory of predicables reads a false significance into the ultimate subject as revealed in our intuition of faculty. There is measurement, as it were, of a defined range of accomplished perceptions, a resting on achieve- ment rather than a freedom of aspiration. And the whole subsequent elaboration of rubrics is confused accordingly. Fiaures and Moods of Syllogism, Purely Enumerative Induction, are developments of denotation, and their significance is never clearly distinguished from the developments of predicative *comprehension, such as scientific connection, apodeictic certainty and explanatory hypothesis. And the faithful student may too readily relieve his embarrassment by surrendering to the guidance of logicians who have from the beginning not accepted the pluralistic intuition, and have substituted for the contrast between existential unit and characterisation, the mere contrast 'within the organisation of intensive ideas between the concrete and the abstract. Syllogism is then an illusion of universality, Enumerative Induction is an arithmetic of psychological experiences; while conservative expositors of tradition, like Mr. Joseph, spend pages of laboured criticism in distinguishing -between those symbolic forms of inference where denotation can be translated into real differences of intensive predication and those where they cannot. From such a bewilderment we may be rescued by our new rubric, one derived from a -hulmanism which may be called socialistic, as distinguished from the individualism of James and Schiller, and which was -possibly latent in Aristotle's mind wheni he postponed the -tabulation of the predicables until his book on dialectics. It is a gloss upon the text of our logical consciousness, I do not claim that it is part of the text itself, that the motive -or premonition of practical relevancy in judgment is not to be realised within the cult of an individual soul, but must, in the course of its working, out, unite in a main stream of spiritual tendency, a collective aspiration of mankind. Our reactions z 2</page><page sequence="15">358 J. BROUGH. on the pluralities of practical occasion are largely collective or co-operative reactions, and the power of judgment to discharge its task in our spiritual mechanism implies that it must select a plurality common to human judgment in general. The aspiration may be no less obvious to intuition than aspirations which imply less acquaintance with the empirical facts of life, for the social aims may be instinctive as well as the impulses of self-preservation. And the reinforcement of our pluralist intuition, a sustained emphasis on the faculty of isolating ultimate subjects in judgment, comes from the fact that all assimilation of the conceptual life of the individual to the conceptual standards of mankind in general must be reached through a previous identity in the existential references or assumptions on which predication depends, which are neither, to use Mr. Bosanquet's phrase- ology, " auxiliary to identification " of what is fact, nor intension " for its own sake "; or to use Aristotle's phraseology,, are neither " in a subject " nor " predicable of a subject," but. are sheer identities of subject. The origin of language is. traced by Max Muiller to our collective actions, such as the rhythm of oarsmen; and, so far as language to-day expresses. common judgments, it must be because we have learned to thilnk of the same things, rather than that we have learned to think the same things concerning them. If, therefore, we are to approach a logical consciousness, not only of how we think, but of the extent to which we share the thoughts of mankind, we must cling firmly to the application as distinct from the intension of our terms. We must be ready t&amp; transform a merely attributive predicate into the denotative word or phrase which prepares for formal conversion, e.g., the adjective into the plural substantive, "Man is mortal, some mortals are men." That every judgment expresses an identity of application along with a diversity of intensive characterisa- tion, if not the essential analysis of our faculty in solitude,, is a true analysis of our faculty of co-operating in the thoughts</page><page sequence="16">A CONTROVERSY ON IMPORT. 3559 of mankind, and hence of the Import of Propositions. And when Mr. Bosanquet objects that intension may be or must be our guide to denotation, this only means that when through our social use of a denotation a standard intension has also been acquired, we can, as a matter of method, use this intension in bringing to pass new denotative harmonies as a prelude to new intensive themes. A rubric of Interpretation must have implicitly governed Aristotle's dialectics, where he organised the methods proper wheni any accepted authority is to be held for, or urged against, interlocutors whose individual experience and foresight might raise a doubt. And like this practice seem to be all our internal questionings, if we would interact personally with mankind. We miust reduce our personal thought and the common thought to denotative expressions as the ultimate specific for discrepancy. We must recognise that when by common consent man is mortal, the personal freak of noticing somie mortals who are men, or that Alexander is mortal, is no departure from that august platitude, but is exactly the personal privilege of varied interpretation which must be exercised if the platitudinous harmony is to be realised. Identities of denotation amid varieties of connotation, denotative inter- subordinations such as arrange themselves into syllogistic figures and moods, may not economise the effective intelligence of a solitary, or bind into system the contents of formulated science. But they are the law by which our solitary impotence can hold by the strength of common consent, and by which each intellect may "do its bit" in sustaining the common formulation. The social aspiration, reliance on symbols, and demonstration of syllogistic validities, diverge so widely from the analysis of actual science, even when this is conducted teleologically rather than psychologically, that we may well suggest that they should be constituted into a separate discipline. They are nearer in spirit than is the morphology of knowledge to the Kantian</page><page sequence="17">360 J. BROUGH. theory of that " Kingdom of moral ends," where every will is a law-giver, yet no man's volition can run to the boundary. But since the way of right notions lies not merely through personal thinking, but, as Mr. Bosanquet happily describes it, through the inheritance of science and civilisation, we must rather anticipate the rubric of Interpretation as we do that of Motive, in our analysis of Judgment; and then, under this rubric itself, develop separately a scheme for the harmony of the personal and the common. A proposition, I would then say, as a personal utterance, imports an appeal by one mind to another, to think of certain things or events, identifiable in the act of common perception, description or conception; to think of them as characterised in a definite way, and so inviting from human feeling or will a definite reaction. The initension which is offered in order to secure that many minds shall think of the same thing, may or may not be the same as that by which the things are to be characterised. Even the much maligned S is S may symbolise a proposition, provided the first S is used for identifying the things, and the second for characterising them, " What I have written, I have written." S is P symbolises an invitation to identify the things through one intension, and to characterise them by another. Aproposition as a standing formula for the harmony we aspire to in utterance, imports an identity of denotation along with a diversity of intension. It is a potentiality of acts of communion. It implies a sphere of things and events which a given percep- tion, description or conception may serve to identify, and another breadth which the intensive predicate may serve to characterise. It is a goal at which all the talkers of all time must just fail to arrive. And its significance for logical conscious- ness is more in the content of personal import which it omits than in what it contains. The indefinite particular proposition, Some S is P, is a partial failure of different minds to think of the same things; and the undistributed predicate, S is some at least</page><page sequence="18">A CONTROVERSY ON IMPORT. 361 of P, is a wilful ignorance of the full range of objects which we might possibly know can be characterised as P. The selection of ultimate subjects by the individual lies within a common potential range, while the common unification invited by the formal copula " is," lies within a range potential for the individual. Our aspirations for community must acknow- ledge eternal limits of definiteness against which our aspira- tions for truth, for perceptual multiplicity and conceptual depth, must always rebel. Mill's reproach against Immediate Inferenice, that it is a mere change of verbiage, and against Syllogism that it is a mere interpretation of memoranda, is pointless as against an aspiration which can only be realised through personal acts of expression and of appropriation of record. Thinkers who test their thoughts by formal rules, know at least what degree of communioni is possible, and at what limits they must be content to allow the secrets of personal insight to remain for ever inviolate. The interest in which I entered on this discussion was the conditions of "disclosure." "How is it a priori possible for anyone to disclose anything ?" And the satisfaction suggested lies in the definition of Personal Import. To propose such a satisfaction perhaps involves the duty of tracing more fully the interplay between Personal Import and the Impersonal Import formulated by Miss Jones. For though not the a priori possi- bility of disclosure, this latter Import constitutes an axiom from which a methodology of disclosure may be demonstrated; and the mnethodology, with its equipollencies, syllogisms, and quasi-inductive summaries, is the ceremonial of seizin, as it were, with which the heritage of science anld civilisation passes from hand to hand. But I mnust apply to the relating of the Personal to the Impersonal the words in which Miss Jones herself relates her own problem to that which Mr. Schiller thinks should be undertalken :-" No enunciative sentenec is capable of setting forth all at once and unambiguously all the objective sine qud non implications of Assertion" (p. 403). And</page><page sequence="19">362 J. BROUGH. the many such sentences which would be required to relate Personal to Impersonal Import, I must at least postpone. And theoretically I ought also to relate the a priori possi- bility of disclosure in general, to the propositional forms; forms "highly continuous, representing a constant effort to modify the meanilng of sentences towards new burdens of expression"; or rather to what Mr. Bosanquet distinguishes in them as the " Existential, Categorical, Hypothetical, Relational, and other features of actual meaninrgs " (pp. 380 and 418). The possibility of disclosure is to the " features of actual meanings," as these are to the propositional forms. Mr. Bosanquet remarks that the man who uses the forms " is not always the best judge as to what he himself means to say" (p. 381); and I would add that what he means to say is not always the complete fulfilment of, but only germinal for, the " universal conditions of expression" in saying, it. Possibly I ought, in conclusion, to relate my special problem to the theory of truth and falsity, as well as to that of "relations" and "things," and so complete the survey of Avicenna's formula. This would mean the stupendous enter- prise of mediating between logical intuition, that is to say, the simple self-consciousness of the act of knowledge, and the more elaborate mode of reflection which I have contrasted with it as metaphysical. And I am glad to remember the assurance given by Mr. Schiller for the logical inquiry itself: " Is not our general analysis relative to a purpose and a standpoint, and may there not be a plurality of these?" (p. 420). What is most relevant to our present theme is, that metaphysical reflection on judament, and especially on the existential and the predicative elements in it, seems to invert the analysis made in strictly logical reflection. The logical priority lies with the existential, the metaphysica.l with the predicative. " Right or wrong," says Mr. Schiller, " we all predicate P of S including the logicians who choose to denounce the practice" (p. 387). And we must all still find S before we can predicate</page><page sequence="20">A CONTROVERSY ON IMPORT. 363 P or any other determination for it. And the metaphysical inversion can oiliy warn us that our selection from plurality must be continuously reformed under the test of progressive characterisationi. "The same thing cannot act in contrary ways. . . and therefore whenever this contradiction occurs, we know that they are not the tpame but different." (Plato: Republic, Bk. IV, 436.)</page></plain_text>
