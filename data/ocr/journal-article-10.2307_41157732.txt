<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Ecological Indian vs. the Spiritually Corrupt White Man: The Function of Ethnocentric Notions in Linda Hogan's Solar Storms Christa Grewe-Volpp ABSTRACT In her novel Solar Storms, Native American writer Linda Hogan employs the image of the Eco- logical Indian, a refiguration of the noble savage, and juxtaposes it with a detrimental, despiritu- alized, exploitative white society, thus perpetuating ethnocentric notions of the moral superiority of tribal cultures. In this article, I will show, however, that her use of the stereotypical Indian fig- ure is much more complex, that it is based on indigenous epistemologies as well as on ecological insights, and that it serves a strategic function: it is a conscious construction aimed at revising his- torically developed Indian feelings of inferiority and marginality, turning them instead into an ex- perience of dignity and self-empowerment. This can, as in the case of the novel's main protago- nist, lead to political action directed against environmental destruction as well as against cultural degradation. I will also point out how Hogan ultimately argues for an integration of both cultures, e.g., by emphasizing the creative function of words in a Native American as well as a Euroameri- can literary context. I. In his recent book on the history of the Native American treatment of the natu- ral environment, anthropologist Shepard Krech III reminds his readers of a pic- ture published by Keep America Beautiful, Inc. and widely advertised in the 1970s. It is that of Iron Eyes Cody as the Crying Indian. The implied message in the photograph is that Euroamericans litter and pollute the land whereas Indians treat Mother Earth kindly, conserve her resources and live ecologically responsi- ble lives. Krech has termed this figure the Ecological Indian. He sees him as an- other manifestation of the noble savage, a figure alive in American mythology since the times of Columbus, a Euroamerican projection evoking images of Arca- dia, Elysium, the Garden of Eden or the Golden Age. European settlers had made extensive use of this image to express their desire for a realization of a nostalgical- ly perceived past and a simpler life in the New World. Over the centuries, the no- ble savage has served various ideological and political purposes, mostly as a cri- tique of a civilization deemed corrupt. Tacitus, Rousseau and Montaigne, James Fenimore Cooper, Ernest Thompson Seton, and even a Native American, Charles Eastman, were foremost among the creators and propagators of this powerful im- age, whose latest manifestation exists in conformity with ecological imperatives. He is now, according to Krech, "the Indian in nature who understands the system- ic consequences of his actions, feels deep sympathy with all living forms, and takes</page><page sequence="2">270 Christa Grewe-Volpp steps to conserve so that earth's harmonies are never imbalanced and resources never in doubt."1 In his study, Krech convincingly shows that this mythological figure has neither a historical nor a sociological foundation, that the actual treatment of the land by Native Americans was much more complex, more in accordance with intricate cultural taboos and not necessarily with ecological insights, and that it varied among different tribes. Some of their practices even worked against concepts of conservation. The Cree's or the Cherokee's belief in reincarnation, for example, demanded that animals who offered themselves to the hunter had to be killed to assure their plentiful reappearance. Overhunting was thus an impossibility.2 The popular notion that Native Americans left no traces of themselves in nature is also shown to be a myth. "Where they were thickly settled," writes Krech, "American Indians pressured land and resources because they placed demands on the forests for fuel, building materials, and domestic crops." The fact that they did not have a greater impact on the ecosystem is due to their demography: "... their populations were too small to have made much of a difference."3 According to historian Richard White, the idea of Native Americans blending with the natural environment "demeans Indians. It makes them simply like an animal species, and thus deprives them of culture. It also demeans the environment by so simplifying it that all changes come to seem negative -as if somehow the ideal is never to have been there at all."4 Interestingly, however, the figure of the Ecological Indian has been adopted by Native Americans themselves, just like the image of Mother Earth, which is like- wise a Euroamerican construction.5 American Indians readily accepted the new image of themselves in the late sixties and early seventies, when many white mem- bers of the back-to-nature movement considered themselves "tribalists." Indians used the image basically for two reasons: a) to further their efforts toward self- fashioning, and b) to support their political struggles. Although the image remains deeply problematic -"[It] distorts culture. It masks cultural diversity"6- it pro- vided them with a moral justification in their indictment of a technocratic, imperi- alistic culture which had for too long suppressed, inferiorized, and colonized Na- tive Americans as the subordinate other in a system based on concepts of hierarchical dualism. This concept implies that the sphere of white, patriarchal Western culture is not only opposed to that of nature and so-called natural peo- ples such as Indians, but that that culture deems itself superior and thus legitimizes controlling and exploiting. One of the contemporary Native American writers who employs the figure of the Ecological Indian and juxtaposes it with a destructive, despiritualized, exploit- 1 Sheoard Krech III.

With her recourse to stereotypical figures- red as well as white- she seems to perpetuate an ethnocentric position and there- by to widen the gap between Native American and Western cultures. I will show, however, how Hogan employs the Ecological Indian critically, even subversively, to undermine dichotomous thinking, to work towards a symbiosis of Euroameri- can and American Indian ways of life. I will also demonstrate how her fiction con- tributes to an understanding of the function of Native American literature in Western culture today, how it mediates between two sets of cultural perceptions, traditionally indigenous and ecological, and must thus be seen as an example of what Catherine Rainwater has termed "crosscultural constructions."7 II. Linda Hogan, born in Denver in 1947 and raised in Oklahoma, is of mixed blood, her father a Chickasaw and her mother white, which, according to the au- thor, "created a natural tension that surfaces in my work and strengthens it."8 This tension not only becomes obvious in her protagonists' confrontation with two con- flicting cultures, it is also a feature of her narrative style informed by the oral tra- dition of her father's relatives as well as by her training in an American education- al system with its emphasis on written knowledge. Her three novels Mean Spirit (1990), Solar Storms (1995), and Power (1998)9 all deal with the political and spir- itual implications of a colonial encounter between a powerful white Western cul- ture and a subordinate indigenous culture.10 Her fiction must be understood as an effort to counter white interpretations of Indian history and identity, to record what had been omitted or falsified: "I knew there was a history to our life that needed to be saved, a history not in books or films."11 She articulates specific sen- sibilities that she believes she has learned from her Indian ancestors- "I saw that there is a better and alternative way to exist in the world, better ways to love, to take care of life"12- and sets them against white materialism and greed for power. These sensibilities convey a deep sense of tribal, feminist, and environmental val- ues as well as a spirituality conspicuously absent from her white protagonists. 7 Catherine Rainwater, Dreams of Fiery Stars: The Transformations of Native American Fic- tion (Philadelphia: U of Pennsylvania P, 1999) x. 8 Laura Coltelli, "Linda Hogan," Winged Words: American Indian Writers Speak, ed.

How then does Hogan, as an avowedly political writer, avoid the pitfalls of the deeply problematic image of the Ecological Indian which "masks diversity" and reduces Indians to the stereotype of the "natural" man outside of culture? The question gains special significance when we consider that her main protagonists are native women who, according to another stereotype, possess a "natural" sexu- ality and have thus been degraded not only because of their race, but because of their gender as well. How can Hogan depict them as ecological heroines without naturalizing an historically developed subordinate social position? Solar Storms, Hogan's second novel, published in 1995, deals with the political struggle of various northern tribes against "one of the largest construction projects of all time,"13 the James Bay hydroelectric development project, which was begun in 1972 and attempted to reroute the St. Lawrence and other rivers in order to provide power to New York City and other northern urban areas in Can- ada and the United States. Tribes such as the Cree and Inuit were denied their an- cestral claims to the land and displaced when their homes were flooded. "In short order," writes Krech, "Hydro Quebec built two hundred dams and dikes, moved and poured two hundred million cubic yards of fill, and flooded forty-five hundred square miles of land. The ecological and social effects of these and related projects are demonstrable: At least one massive drowning of caribou, mercury poisoning of fish, deforestation, and community relocation."14 One of the main concerns of Solar Storms is to reveal that Native Americans not only lost their land, but with it a whole way of life. The narrator's comment- "It was murder of the soul that was taking place there. Murder with no consequence for the killers"15- neatly high- lights the text's attitude toward the two clashing cultures. It is "soul" versus "kill- ers," life versus death, spirit versus materialism, a native way of life versus a Eu- roamerican economic system and, finally, the Ecological Indian versus the spiritually corrupt white man. The story is told from the perspective of a 17-year-old girl, Angela Wing who, in 1972, one year after the publication of the Crying Indian, returns to Adam's Rib, a fictive place in the boundary waters of Northern Minnesota, to live with her fe- male ancestors. Seriously abused by her mother as a very young child, she had been raised by various white foster families, deprived of her heritage as well as of a sense of belonging.16 By returning home she fulfills what William Bevis has 13 Krech 198. 14 Krech 198. 15 Linda Hogan, Solar Storms (New York: Scribner, 1995) 226. Quotations from this novel will be documented by page numbers in the main text. 16 Until 1978, the year the American Indian Child Welfare Act was passed, many Native American children were given away for adoption. In 1967, for example, almost every child born in the Indian Health Service Hospital in Pine Ridge, South Dakota, was adopted by white families, many of them Mormons. Cf. "An Interview with Linda Hogan," The Missouri Review 17.2 (1994): 109-32; 131. In 1982, almost every third child was still placed in foster homes or adopted. Cf.

Angel returns to her aunt, her grandmother and great-grand- mother, to the land, and to the stories that help shape her and her people, that have- so the implied message of the text- the capacity to heal her fragmented self, to make her whole by connecting her to the community, the land, and their common past. What Angel finds upon her return, however, is not an undisturbed traditional way of life, but one that has been deeply injured by its confrontation with a white, Euroamerican culture, a confrontation that had lasting and devastating conse- quences for the land as well as for the people and the animals. European immi- grants have taken whatever their economic interests demanded: French trappers harvested beaver and fox until both were gone, Norwegian and Swedish loggers deforested the land, contemporary Canadians and US Americans covet water power. "This Country," writes Hogan in Dwellings, "is a place desolate and ran- sacked by those who have tried to survive here. The land cries out the thefts that have taken place."18 Adam's Rib, for example, Angel's place of origin, is a poor little town consisting of a few dilapidated houses and one long street called Poison Road. The French had named it "Poisson" after the abundant fish, but when some stray wolves and fox were poisoned to make room for European settlers, the neg- ative term stuck. It serves as one of the many indications in the novel of how the natural environment was degraded by white immigrants. The name of the town it- self, Adam's Rib, alludes to the minor importance and subsequent abuse of the women in the history of white settlement. They had come to the land with the fur traders, some Cree, some Anishinabe, some White, but were left behind when the natural resources were used up: "When the land was worn out, the beaver and the wolf gone, mostly dead, the men moved on to what hadn't yet been destroyed, leaving their women and children behind, as if they too were used-up animals" (28). Treatment of the land is always closely connected to that of its people, the devastation of the one is the ruin of the other. The story of Hannah Wing, Angel's mother, is an especially drastic, but repre- sentative example of how the exploitation of the land has affected the people. Hannah is a destructive woman possessed by evil forces. She tries to kill Angel af- ter giving birth to her, later she bites her in an act of motherly cannibalism, leaving her daughter permanently scarred. However, she is also seen as a victim herself who as a child was forced to witness her tribe's genocide. The colonizers had poi- soned the animals and destroyed the land, forcing the people to eat the poisoned 17 William W.

Hannah's body had literally been taken pos- session of: "... when she was still a girl, she'd been taken and used by men who fed her and beat her and forced her. That was how one day she became the one who hurt others. It was passed down" (39). Her abuse is closely connected to historical exploitation, to unkept treaties and unfair legislation, "the sum total of ledger books and laws" (101), her scars the visual proof of Hogan's conviction "that the history of your people and your land is in the human body."19 Human beings are intricately woven into a natural and historical process that allows no clean separa- tion between a 'pure,' ahistorical nature and an 'infected' historical environment. Both are closely interconnected: the economically motivated destruction of the natural environment is not only visible in the land, but also in the human body and psyche. This, then, is Angel's origin: "My beginning was Hannah's beginning, one of broken lives, gone animals, trees felled and kindled. Our beginnings were intri- cately bound up in the history of the land" (96). The text is very explicit about who is responsible for the devastation and ruin that have fallen over the land as well as over the people, about who is the murder- er of the soul. It is the white immigrants who regarded Native Americans along with their land as the other, the subordinate and inferior in a dualistic value sys- tem. When Angel arrives North with her ancestors to fight against the construc- tion of the dam, she observes: "Nothing had changed since the Frenchman, Radis- son, passed through and wrote in his journal that there was no one to stop them from taking what they wanted from this land. 'We were caesars,' he wrote, 'with no one to answer to.' We were the no one" (285). At a political meeting, she learns that the white proponents of the dam regard her and her people as "remnants of the past," without history, as "ignorant" (280), an attitude that serves to legitimize the dispossession of the land in the name of technological progress. Euroamerican immigrants are almost without exception depicted as spiritually impoverished, morally corrupt and ignorant about the land and its inhabitants, a result of their belief in a transcendent, super-natural God, which has led to mis- trust in and fear of an animistic nature and which has fortified the Cartesian split between man and nature. Their box-like, square houses, for example, are built to leave nature out. About one of the houses Angel remarks: "Like the other squat places, it was designed and built by Christian-minded, sky-worshipping people who did not want to look out windows at the threatening miles of frozen lake on one side of them and, on the other, at the dense, dark forest with its wolves" (27). Their Christian God is understood as violent and wrathful: "The one who had tor- tured Job, who had Abraham lift the ax to his son, who, disguised as a whale, had swallowed Jonah" (169). For the settlers, the wilderness is full of demons; the voic- es of the animals singing at night are feared and subsequently silenced. The re- moval of spirit from the natural world leads to a disease of the heart that can only be "cured" by gold. Materialism, greed, and the desire to control are identified as the dominant traits of white settlers, and their adherence to the concept of hierar- chical dualism as the main source of their destructive behavior. In their view, ani- 19 Rachel Stein, "An Ecology of Mind: A Conversation with Linda Hogan," ISLE 6.1 (1999): 113-18; 115.</page><page sequence="7">The Ecological Indian vs. the Spiritually Corrupt White Man 275 mais and people alike are perceived as the dangerous "other" that needs to be tamed or exterminated. In the text, the violent treatment of the land, of animals and human bodies all have the same cause: the loss of an immanent spirituality and the subsequent separation of humans from their natural environment. III. Hogan sets this detrimental Euroamerican value system against a morally in- tact, communally oriented, spiritually rich indigenous population living in harmo- ny with nature, even if many of its members are fatally infected by their contact with the colonizers. The "Beautiful People"- as the Northern tribes call them- selves-show all the traits of the Ecological Indian: because they regard the land and the animals as sacred, they are depicted as noble ecologists who feel deep sympathy with all living forms and who lead responsible, caring lives, aware of their interconnection with a life system understood as a web, meaning that all ele- ments of the system, including humans, are intricately interwoven and dependent upon each other. Angel's reintegration into this animistic world, her psychological healing pro- cess, takes place during her journey North, a hazardous, dangerous canoe trip from northern Minnesota to the construction site of the dams in Canada, under- taken by four women the oldest of whom, Dora Rouge, is about a hundred years old. It is not only a trip that demands all their strength and ingenuity, but also a mythical journey connecting Angel with the land and its tribal history. She learns that there are no boundaries between herself and the natural environment as well as between species; that there exists a social relationship comprising not only hu- man beings, but all living and nonliving entities. She experiences a feeling of kin- ship with nonhuman creation which is an essential element of Native American epistemologies based on the spirituality of all existence. This feeling gives her a sense of belonging that was absent from her former life with white foster families, which is, however, important not only for her fragmented individual self, but for her dispossessed and psychologically wounded tribe as well. Even before the trip, in Adam's Rib, she begins to realize her involvement with the natural world: I began to form a kind of knowing at Adam's Rib. I began to feel that if we had no sepa- rate words for inside and out and there were no boundaries between them, no walls, no skin, you would see me. What would meet your eyes would not be the mask of what had happened to me, not the evidence of violence, not even how I closed the doors to the rooms of anger and fear. Some days you would see fire; other days, water. Or earth. You would see how I am like the night sky with its stars that fall through time and space and arrive here as wolves and fish and people, all of us fed by them. You would see the dust of sun, the turning of creation taking place. But the night I broke my face there were still boundaries and I didn't yet know I was beautiful as the wolf, or that I was a new order of atoms. (54) Interestingly, Angel's experience of being "of the same equation" (79) as the nat- ural world not only corresponds with a traditional indigenous world-view, but also with ecological insights. She realizes that she is part of the same biological, physi-</page><page sequence="8">276 Christa Grewe-Volpp cal and historical laws as other elements of the cosmos, that she is part of a com- plex ecosystem, materially woven into an ever-changing, cyclical natural process that allows no anthropocentric notions of superiority or exceptionality. Hogan is convinced that ecological knowledge has much in common with traditional indig- enous wisdom, which to her includes knowledge about the natural law of Earth, from the beginning of creation, and the mag- nificent terrestrial intelligence still at work, an intelligence now newly called ecology by the Western science that tells us what our oldest tribal stories maintain- the human ani- mal is a relatively new creation here; animal and plant presences were here before us; and we are truly the younger sisters and brothers of the other animal species, not quite as well developed as we thought we were.20 "Terrestrial intelligence" is a key concept in Hogan's ecologically as well as tradi- tionally based concept of interdependence. She imagines the natural world as a living, active, conscious and intelligent power that is endowed with a will and a voice of its own. Her native protagonists in Solar Storms keep pointing out this ba- sic ontological fact: "The people at Adam's Rib believed everything was alive, that we were surrounded by the faces and lovings of gods The stones, too, were alive, the stinging nettles, the snails of Fur Island, and the tree which folded its leaves when touched by human hands" (81). Water can become "angry," "[it] would do what it wanted and in its own way" (224), the land can be "defiant"; it shows "mischief and trickiness" and even "stubborn passion" (123). Most often, however, the text articulates the voice of nature: the wind speaks (102), the north- ern lights have their sound (119), an island "call[s] out" (169), the ice "cried out" and "groaned," and "[e]ven silence was loud on Fur Island" (115). At first sight, such an apparently anthropomorphic nature contradicts ecocriti- cal demands of human relinquishment in responsible, nondominant approaches to the natural environment; it even seems to be a new form of pathetic fallacy. On closer inspection, however, it reveals a new understanding of the relationship be- tween humans and nonhumans reflected in traditional nonhierarchical notions of kinship as well as in results based on scientific research. Donna Haraway has pointed out that, since Jane Goodall's and Dian Fossey's work with primates, the strict boundaries between humans and animals can no longer be sustained: "The last beachheads of uniqueness have been polluted, if not turned into amusement parks- language, tool use, social behavior, mental events. Nothing really convinc- ingly settles the separation of human and animal."21 She does not argue that ani- mals speak a human language; instead, she expands the definition of language be- yond the ability to articulate: "Nature may be speechless, without language, in the 20 Linda Hogan, "First People," Intimate Nature: The Bond between Women and Animals, ed.

Discourse is only one process of articulation To articulate is to signify."22 Like Haraway, Hogan repeatedly argues that human language is not the climax of evolutionary development but that, on the contrary, it can even be a limiting ap- proach to understanding natural phenomena. To her, there exist "intelligences be- yond ours," there are "ways of knowing and being in the world that have not been available to our own human intelligence."23 In order to communicate with these nonhuman intelligences, Angel has to develop sensibilities that bridge the gap be- tween species and thus help to overcome her own fragmentation and feeling of separateness. If she succeeds, she will not be reduced to the level of an animal but raised to a new level of consciousness which Hogan has elsewhere termed a "po- tential act of emergence."24 Angel gives up her anthropocentric position in the universe and is rewarded with admission into a community based on kinship rela- tions; she finally becomes a full member of her tribe: "And now I was one of the Beautiful People" (314). Anthropomorphizing nature in Solar Storms is thus not a relapse into a pathetic fallacy which falsifies nature by applying human attributes to its manifestations. It must instead be understood as a- paradoxical- effort to realize and appreciate nature's very own laws. The protagonists do not project their own feelings into a realm understood as fundamentally different from themselves. On the contrary, they try to articulate the close relationship of human and nonhuman realms with the aid of human attributes. Furthermore, not only is nonhuman nature endowed with human characteristics, human beings themselves are depicted in their in- stinctive, animal-like state, which grants them "a kind of grace" (67).25 Hogan does not perpetuate hierarchical dualism, because human capabilities are not the measure of all considerations. Finally, her nature does not speak a human lan- guage, and despite its seeming anthropomorphism, it is not a subject in the human sense. This does not, however, deprive it of agency and autonomy. This view is supported by Donna Haraway, who maintains that "in a sociological account of science all sorts of things are actors, only some of which are human language- bearing actors, and that you have to include, as sociological actors, all kinds of heterogenous entities .... this imperative helps to break down the notion that only language-bearing actors have a kind of agency.26 22 Donna Haraway, "The Promises of Monsters: A Regenerative Politics for Inappropriate/d Others," Cultural Studies, ed.

In Solar Storms, nature has a voice, but water has "its own speaking," and Angel understands that "the laws of winter were a justice foreign to my nature" (117). Nature can be indifferent, cold; a moose, sinking into a mire before her eyes is finally "embraced and held by a hungry earth with no compas- sion for it" (211). To enter this equal, but different, nonhuman realm on her journey across the waters, Angel must learn to trust her own physical strength and to "read" the signs of a landscape that is literally and figuratively fluid, in which civilization's tools of orientation- like maps and calendars- turn out to be insufficient. Apparently sol- id borders constantly change in the Boundary Waters, and maps "were only as ac- curate as their makers and those had been men possessed with the spoils of the land" (122). Research studies on colonial discourse and on American ethnicity have pointed out that early efforts at cartography served to appropriate and con- trol "unsettled" territories;27 they reflect the imagination and desire of their pro- ducers, i.e., "a wish that the space could be this well organized."28 The women in Solar Storms eventually lose their insufficient maps. To really find "the way in," they have to consider the land's "mischief and trickiness," its refusal "to be shaped by the makers of maps" (123). They have to rely on Dora Rouge's tribal memory, on intuition, sensual experiences, dreams and visions as well as on the traditional stories of an oral culture. The women cultivate a different sense not only of spatial orientation, but also of time, entering a kind of mythic timelessness beyond rational epistemologies: "Wednesday was the last day we called by name, and truly, we no longer needed time. We were lost from it, and lost in this way, I came alive" (170). Angel experi- ences her kinship with the fluid natural world very easily, a fact that is again sup- ported by scientific arguments as well as by traditional knowledge. She imagines herself as part of an interdependent (eco)system because of her materiality, her cells, her atoms, her DNA, and because of ideas of a racial blood relationship. The ecologically-established material connectedness is quite plausible; the "racial blood theory," however, is more problematic. Angel "knows" of her astral origin and her shared history with other material phenomena because she is a member of an indigenous tribe whose identity is the product of a very long, complex biologi- cal and historical process inscribed in her body. She is convinced that her body recognizes the traditional lifestyle practiced by the woman Bush: "I'd searched all my life for this older world that was lost to me, this world only my body remem- bered" (79). She speaks of "a cell-deep memory" (137), of blood knowing its own blood (23). 27 Lawrence Buell, The Environmental Imagination: Thoreau, Nature Writing, and the Forma- tion of American Culture (Cambridge: The Belknap Press of Harvard UP, 1995) 269, 270.

Scott Momaday or Paula Gunn Allen, is reminiscent of racist or even fascist tendencies. However, their and Hogan's ecologically motivated "racial memory," the hypothesis that identification with a tribe and its biotic commu- nity is "in the blood," has little to do with the exclusion of racial difference or with bi- ological determinism. It is closely connected to the social and political context as well as to the specific history of Native Americans, all of which manifest themselves- so- ciologically, psychologically, materially- in the bodies and psyches of a people that does not strive for dominance over other races. Hogan here comes dangerously close to ethnocentrism, but, as I will show further on, she avoids arguing for the superiority of Native Americans and opts for an integration of the two races. Angel enters the nonhuman realm via dreams which in Native American episte- mologies function as media to get into contact with the spirits of both human and nonhuman persons,29 and which therefore have a higher degree of "truth" than everyday events. Such a meeting on a transrational level is only possible if the nat- ural world is considered spiritual, conscious and possessing, in Haraway's term, a kind of agency, including the ability to dream and thus to establish contact with humans. On such a prelinguistic, sensuous, empathie level, the boundary between species as well as between living and nonliving entities becomes blurred, making communication possible between human beings and the land: But there was a place inside the human that spoke with land, that entered dreaming, in the way that people in the north found direction in their dreams. They dreamed charts of land and currents of water. They dreamed where food animals lived. These dreams they called hunger maps and when they followed those maps, they found their prey. It was the language animals and humans had in common. People found their cures in the same way. (170) Angel dreams of plants whose material essence is an inherent part of her own body; mind and matter form a symbiosis that reflects a traditional understanding of a "bond" between the human and the nonhuman as well as Western scientific concepts of the physical condition of natural phenomena. In Solar Storms, knowl- edge or the experience of the world is postulated as a biological process resulting from the materiality common to all bodies. This notion is reminiscent of N. Katherine Hayles's concept of "constrained constructivism," which emphasizes the significance of embodiment in epistemological constructions. For Hayles, to be "incorporated within a different body would be to live in a different world."30 Hu- man beings have a very specific perception of the world because of their biologi- cal, historical, and social conditioning, their "sensory equipment, neural process- ing system, previous experience, present context, and horizon of expectation."31 The natural world is, on the other hand, an "unmediated flux, a stream of potential 29 Cf.

A concept of nature based on an indigenous spirituality as well as on ecological insights has specific consequences for its adherents. It implies an ethos leading to direct political action and a questioning of hierarchical dualism, especially as man- ifested in naturism, sexism, and racism. When relationships to other human beings as well as to the natural environment are understood in terms of kinship, they ide- ally result in attitudes of solidarity and caring. The women in Solar Storms show a deep commitment to their communities, taking care of children as well as of the elderly, of animals and plants and of water. This behavior as well as their close as- sociation with the natural world seems to perpetuate clichÃ©s of a naturalized fem- ininity which has had disastrous results: women, outside the realm of culture, have had to bear the brunt of social welfare work. Many examples in the text, however, contradict this simple gendered essentialism. The caring mothers are not all bio- logical mothers; the latter, like Hannah, are often more destructive than nurtur- ing. The women furthermore show traits that are considered typically male in pa- triarchal Western culture: they are physically strong and independent, and they speak up and act in political conflicts. Many of the men in the novel, on the other hand, show so-called typically female characteristics: they are nurturing and ten- der. Women and men demonstrate a close relationship to nature because of their insight into their own material embeddedness as well as their socialization in an indigenous tribe with its emphasis on kinship and interdependence, not because of notions of naturalized gendered attitudes. Hogan obviously works against binary oppositions between the realms of the human and the nonhuman as well as between genders. The opposition between races, however, appears conspicuously rÃ©sistent. As shown above, her depiction of the "Beautiful People," reflecting the stereotypical Ecological Indian, is juxta- posed with the destructive, exploitative Euroamerican behavior and raises the crucial question of ethnocentrism. A serious critique of this position, however, 32 N.

In Hogan's case, they are clearly a strategy. Just as es- sentialist positions can be powerful tools in dismantling ideologies of domination in the hands of the subaltern, as Diana Fuss has pointed out,36 so ethnocentrism can have the effect of creating an "oppositional consciousness"37 when employed by ethnic minorities. It depends on who is utilizing an essentialist rhetoric and to what effect. In Hogan's case, Native American protagonists, most of them female, many of them Ecological Indians, are conscious creations in an effort to revise Eu- roamerican history from the perspective of the colonized other, and to give voice and thus authority to a formerly triply-silenced object of white historiography: the native woman belonging to a lower class of American society. Hogan's recourse to stereotypical images does not consolidate the marginal social position of Native Americans. On the contrary, it leads to self-definition and autonomy. In this revised Euroamerican history, words are of prominent importance. An- gel's healing process depends on her ancestors' telling of her story which in the act of telling makes sense of her life. Storytelling becomes an act of self-creation as Angel has to put together the pieces of her own and her ancestors' life that are slowly being revealed to her- "And I had to earn each word" (76)- and connect them in a way that give her and her tribe a new identity in opposition to tales in white history books and official documents which conceal the facts of cultural dep- rivation, of loss and humiliation. She learns from her female ancestors' stories that language as "a shaper and reflection of culture"38 is not only in the hands of white colonizers, but that the myths and personal stories of her tribe have their own powerful significance as language. Feeling a longing for creation, for making "something whole" (86), Angel participates in the reinvention of ethnicity by ar- ticulating her perspective on Native events, past and present. With her under- standing of the creative capacity of words, Hogan joins contemporary Native American writers who, according to critic Catherine Rainwater, "like their oral storytelling predecessors, insist that humanity makes the world through the stories we tell."39 Writing thus, according to Jace Weaver, "prepares the ground for re- covery, and even re-creation, of Indian identity and culture."40 Likewise, Angel's story, a continuation of her ancestors' tales, encourages Indian feelings of self- worth and helps her create a new, self-defined identity instead of accepting her degradation as the "no one," as the one without history. In the context of the nov- el, the clichÃ© of the Ecological Indian thus does not re-enforce a marginalized po- 36 Diana Fuss, Essentially Speaking: Feminism, Nature &amp; Difference (London: Routledge, 1990) 32. 37 The term was coined by Chela Sandoval who understands "oppositional consciousness" as a tactic of U.S. Third World feminists in their struggle for political revisions.

On the contrary, it is here used strategically to claim for them a position of strength and empowerment, active in cultural processes of their own. In addition to purposes of self-empowerment, the image is also used for out- right political ends, namely to legitimize the protest against the construction of a hydroelectric power plant and the dispossession of the land. Angel's journey into an animistic nature is not an escape from contemporary social and cultural prob- lems. Instead, it allows her to enter history,41 to understand that she- being so closely connected with the natural environment- has the power and the responsi- bility to fight against its and her tribe's extinction. She joins the protestors, speaks on the radio, and secretly destroys the food storage of the construction workers. Most important, however, is the way she can now unmask white reports as tenden- tious, racist, and outright wrong and counter them with her own version. Angel's, and finally Hogan's, purpose is not only to end the dispossession of northern indigenous tribes, but to end environmental destruction on a global scale. Such an ambitious goal implies an end to hierarchical dualism; it implies the dissolving of racial and cultural dichotomies, and thus an end to ethnocentric thinking. Hogan is quite aware of this. Despite her strategic use of ethnocentric el- ements in Solar Storms, she ultimately aims at a transcendence of dualism. Not all of her white protagonists are bad. For instance, there is the store owner Orensen, who begins to understand the plight of the Indians and to help them in their strug- gle. Native Americans do use and even enjoy many achievements of Western civi- lization. Angel and her family not only love American cookies and Coke, they ap- preciate the advantages of electricity and know how to employ the printing press, photography and the radio for their own political purposes. Angel yearns for rock music and takes the plane to reach her dying mother; the elders go to an American court to defend their rights. Even if the Native American value system and way of life are depicted as supe- rior to that of white Western society, Hogan ultimately works towards an integra- tion of both cultures. As a mixed blood, she identifies with her Indian ancestors, but at the same time she vehemently argues against racist points of view: "... to become anti-white is a mistake. It's self-destructive for those who do. Talk about a balance of things- talk about head and heart or head and soul- somehow I think that merging the two cultures in a really healthy way, not as done in the past, might be an integration "42 Such an integration is potentially possible for Angel who, toward the end of the novel, resumes her life in the city, keeping alive, however, her recovered spiritual values and her political ideas and goals. Despite the strong influence of Indian tra- ditions, she cannot go back to a traditional way of life. There is no indigenous en- clave; the land is flooded and lost: "I had to leave the songs behind with their own- ers, leave the herbs beneath water, the bundles in their caves and trees alongside bear skulls that had been watching us from hidden places" (345). Therefore she 41 Cf.

In the end, Angel rep- resents a symbiosis of Western individualism and Indian communality, a reconcili- ation of two cultures that Hogan sees as the only possibility of ending ethnocen- trism. The novel as narrative also aims at a symbiosis of two cultural forms of repre- sentation: it is a written text which makes liberal use of an oral tradition. This jug- gling of two different spheres of discourse aimed at cross-cultural goals- her audi- ence is Native American as well as Euroamerican- is a process that James Ruppert has called "mediation," an epistemological restructuring of two sets of perception and understanding.43 It moves from one cultural tradition to another, the elements of which function as parts of an ongoing conversation, "complement- ing and redirecting the discourse of each sphere."44 Native American literature is thus not a one-dimensional depiction and celebration of indigenous values at the cost of Euroamerican cultural perceptions; it is rather to be seen as an effort, often an ambivalent one, to realize a dialogic relationship, to come to terms with two conflicting cultures and to ideally find a symbiosis that might end destruction and exploitation. In this sense, Janet St. Clair speaks of an "uneasy" ethnocentrism, one that reflects the position of mixed-blood writers trying to integrate the best of their two origins: "Their [Allen's, Silko's, Hogan's] devotion to tribal spiritual truths about responsible interrelationship requires them to embrace the culture that has very nearly destroyed them and the earth that sustains them. But embed- ded in the very vision that might be labeled ethnocentric are correctives to con- temporary destruction and strategies for global survival."45 Last but not least, Solar Storms illustrates the function literature in general might have today. If the environmental crisis is understood as a crisis of language and per- ception, then stories such as Angel's and Hogan's can ideally help to bring about new, more sane relationships to our natural environment and to each other. In view of an impending ecocatastrophe in a racist society, they do not offer concrete solu- tions to social ills, but insist on the responsibility of the individual and on individual creativity while at the same time stressing communal values. They argue for the sig- nificance of a moral, ethical way of life that integrates both indigenous and ecologi- cal insights of reciprocity and interdependence, and they aim at empowering an op- positional consciousness that might end domination and control. Thus, they are of sociopolitical relevance in pointing out the creative function of words and didacti- cally reminding writers- as Hogan remarks- "to rethink not only the stories of a culture but where the stories take their people, and to what ends."46 43 James Ruppert, Mediation in Contemporary Native American Fiction (Norman: U of Okla- homa P, 1995) 3. 44 James Ruppert, "Dialogism and Mediation in Leslie Silko's Ceremony" Explicator 51.2 (1993): 129-34; 130. 45 Janet St. Clair, "Uneasy Ethnocentrism: Recent Works of Allen, Silko, and Hogan," Studies in American Indian Literatures 6.1 (1994): 83-98; 95. 46 Hogan, "First People" 11.</page></plain_text>
