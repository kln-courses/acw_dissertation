<plain_text><page sequence="1">YUCATECAN CHRONOLOGICAL SYSTEMS R. B. WEITZEL THE natives of Yucatan employed succes- sively three different chronological systems that had Maya nomenclature. These systems will be designated in the order of their appear- ance: the old Maya calendar, distinguished by a long count; the Mexicanized calendar, dis- tinguished by a shift in the month coefficients; and the Europeanized calendar, distinguished by the fixation of 10 Chen on January 1 and of 1 Pop on July. 16. The old Maya calendar is a system with an ascending order of units based on twenty, ex- cept the tun where eighteen is used. The value of each order is expressed by a coefficient that may range from zero to nineteen, excepting the uinal where the range is from zero to seventeen. An inscription at Chichen Itza, 10.2.9.1.9, 9 Muluc 7 Zac, will serve to exemplify how the long count operated. 10 baktun 2 katun 9 tun 1 uinal 9 kin 144,000X10 7,200X 2 360X 9 20X 1 1,440,000 days 14,400 days 3,240 days 20 days 9 days 1,457,669 days or 3,991 years When 1,457,669 days are counted forward from a zero or starting point, 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu- 3,991 years in the past, the inscribed date, 9 Muluc 7 Zac, is reached. In the formation of the large number 1,457,- 669, the Mayas employed five ascending units, which sufficed for ordinary needs. For purposes of computation, Maya mathematicians evolved, by using 20 as a base, additional units of an ascending order. On a stela at Tikal, as Morleyl was the first to point out, is carved a Maya number of eight units, 1.11.19.9.3.6.2.0. This Maya number equals 1,841,639,800 days, ap- proximately five million years. With their method of counting, the Mayas could handle numbers of astronomical proportions. The inscribed date, 10.2.9.1.9, 9 Muluc 7 Zac, will not recur in full until 2.7.9.10.2.9.1.9. The interval between the two occurrences of the Morley, 1915, p. 116. 53 date is 2.7.9.0.0.0.0.0, grammed: 2X1,152,000,000 7X 57,600,000 9X 2,800,000 which will be dia- 2;304,000,000 days 403,200,000 days 25,920,000 days 2,733,120,000 days or 7,482,875 years Maya mathematicians not only understood but may have derived independently the con- cept of zero-a concept which ranks among the greatest achievements of the intellect. No real concept of zero was possessed by the ancient Egyptians, Babylonians, Assyrians, Greeks, or Romans; nor by Europeans until Arabs bor- rowed the zero concept from India and intro- duced it to Europe in the twelfth century. A zero concept is all-important for fixing position values as may be seen from our Arabic method of counting by tens. The date on a lateral part of the Caracol stela at Chichen Itza is read: 17 tun, 10 baktun, 3 katun. This is an abbreviated form of 10.3.17.0.0, and as such would not recur for 7,482,875 years. A haab is a counter of 365 days, or 1.0.5 in Maya notation. It exceeds by five days the tun unit, 1.0.0 of the long count. Fifty-two haabs constitute a calendar round, in Maya terms 2.12.13.0. A calendar round contains 18,980 different dates, after which the dates repeat in sequence. Haabs and calendar rounds were counters commonly used by Nahua or pre-Con- quest Mexican people, who had no long count. A calendar round date without a clearly de- fined long count position can repeat 10 times in 520 vague years. When the calendar round date is defined by a positional determinant, its place in the Maya long count is fixed for a consider- able length of time. There are inscriptions at Chichen Itza that record some safely deciphered calendar round dates with positional determi- nants definitely fixing the dates in the long count, thus: 10.2. 4. 8.12,3 Eb 10 Pop, 5 Tun 1 Ahau 10.2.10.11. 7, 8 Manik 15 Uo, 11 Tun 1 Ahau 10.2.12. 1. 8,9 Lamat 11 Yax, 13 Tun 1 Ahau</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Since the uinal coefficient in each of the given cases is less than 13, the long count position of each date is fixed for 360 calendar rounds, or 18,707 years. Another calendar round date, 7 Akbal 1 Chen, with a positional determinant, 1 Tun 1 Ahau, will occupy the long count posi- tion 10.2.0.15.3, 7 Akbal 1 Chen, in 1 tun of katun 1 ahau; but in this case the uinal coeffi- cient is more than 13, therefore the defined date is fixed in the long count for only 143 calendar rounds, or 7,431 years. In brief, calendar round dates with positional determinants are fixed for more than seven thousand years. Taken by itself a positional determinant will repeat at intervals of 13 katuns or 256 years. On the front of Lintel III of the Temple of the Three Lintels at Chichen Itza is a positional determinant 10 Tun 1 Ahau, which can repeat as follows: 9. 9.10.0.0 10. 2.10.0.0 10.15.10.0.0 11. 8.10.0.0 10 tun of katun 1 Ahau 10 tun of katun 1 Ahau 10 tun of katun 1 Ahau 10 tun of katun 1 Ahau These four alternative long counts may be narrowed to a single choice. The front of Lintel III has eighteen glyphs in two rows of nine glyphs each, and on the front of the Initial Series lintel can be seen the same number of glyphs similarly arranged. The glyphs repre- senting 10 Tun 1 Ahau, towards the beginning of each inscription are practically identical in de- sign. Accordingly, the long count position of 10 Tun 1 Ahau recorded on each lintel is the same 10.2.10.0.0, 10 tun of Katun 1 Ahau. The accu- rately fixed dedicatory date on the front of the Initial Series lintel, 10.2.10.0.0, may be utilized as such in any chronological investigations.2 All safely deciphered inscription dates at Chi- chen Itza are baktun 10 dates. For convenience, a baktun is designated by its coefficient. The latest authentic inscription date at Chichen Itza is recorded on the Caracol stela, 10.3.17.0.0. The latest reliable inscription date found anywhere in the Maya area is incised on a jade gorget at Tzibanche. It consists of only three glyphs which clearly read: 12 Ahau, u katunil, end 4 Katun. Were the first part of the date, Katun 12 Ahau, taken alone it could repeat at intervals of 13 katuns, or 256 years thus: 9.11.0.0.0; 10.4.0.0.0; 10.17.0.0.0; 11.10.0.0.0; etc. Were the last part of the date, end 4 Katun, taken alone it could repeat at intervals of a 2 Morley, 1927, p. 234. baktun, or 394 years, thus: 8.4.0.0.0; 9.4.0.0.0; 10.4.0.0.0; 11.4.0.0.0; etc. The date in its en- tirety-12 Ahau, the Katun, end 4 Katun- will occupy only one long count position for a period of 374,144 years, namely, 10.4.0.0.0, 12 Ahau 3 Uo. Some calculations higher than 10.4.0.0.0 ap- pear in the Codex Dresdensis which is a com- pilation of magical rites, mystical numbers, astrological schematisms, and occult prophecies. A citation from Morley3 in part reads: "The 6 Baktun 10 I.S. from the Codex Dresdensis are marked 'P' in the third column of table 119, since all of them were probably 'prophetic,' i.e., still in the future at the time they were first cal- culated." The Dresden Codex is an astrological manuscript that lies outside the province of this paper. At Chichen Itza, the architecture reveals distinctive foreign features, including the ser- pent motif that inspired the titles: thefeathered serpent's city4 and the people of the serpent.5 The cult of the feathered serpent, Quetzalcoatl, was brought to Yucatan by Mexican warriors. Quetzalcoatl is sometimes represented by a serpent with a human head within its open jaws. Lintel IV of the Temple of the Four lintels at Chichen Itza and Lintel II of a small temple at Yula, "both have the same figure of a ser- pent carved upon them, with a human head issuing from the gaping mouth; the two pairs being practically identical in design."6 The two temples manifestly are Maya-Mexican struc- tures. Architectural features that characterize the Maya-Mexican era are: "Serpent columns, anthropomorphic and zoomorphic Atlantean columns .. .battered wall bases, roof crests, serpent balustrades, Chac Mool figures, At- lantean figures, Tlaloc incensarios."7 Anthro- pomorphic Atlantean columns and other archi- tectural features place the Temple of the Initial Series in the Maya-Mexican category. There are close architectural affinities be- tween the renamed Temple of the Three Lintels -formerly called the Temple of the Two Lintels-and the Monjas group at Chichen Itza. "Indeed, it is not overstating the case to say that the stylistic affinities between this temple and the Monjas Group are closer than 8 Morley, 1938, Vol. 4, p. 276. 4Marden, 1936, title page. 6 Thompson, 1932, title page. 6 Morley, 1925, p. 250. 7 Morley, 1931, p. 107. 54 [1, 1947</page><page sequence="3">YUCATECAN CHRONOLOGICAL SYSTEMS are the stylistic affinities of either to any third building or group of buildings in the city. A priori this would indicate that they both prob- ably date from approximately the same pe- riod."8 They date from the same Maya-Mexican era. The group of the Temple of the Wall Panels at Chichen Itza is Maya-Mexican, as evidenced by such features as "the battered basal zone, colonnade, roof crests, serpent columns and the feathered serpent and sun disk motifs in the sculptured panels."9 On the tail of a serpent column belonging to the Temple is carved a time count that falls in the Maya-Mexican period. Among Mexican features of the Caracol at Chichen Itza are serpent balustrades, roof crests, and Tlaloc incensarios.'0 The round tower-not decorative but structural in func- tion-is very distinctive of the Quetzalcoatl cult.11 A serpent hieroglyphic band was above the medial cornice of the round tower, and a stela with a permanent serpent border was shrined in a niche between the two divisions of the upper stairway. Undoubtedly the Caracol was a Maya-Mexican structure. All structures at Chichen Itza that have de- cipherable time counts, belong to the Maya- Mexican era. No chronological inscriptions associated with structures in the northern sec- tion of the city have been published. Chichen Itza, incidentally, was occupied right up into Spanish times.'2 This review of Maya-Mexican architecture in connection with inscriptions has prepared the way for considering Mexican influence on the calendar. The mental attitude of Mayas in counting time differed from that of Mexicans- the difference between thinking in terms of elapsed time and thinking in terms of current time. All units of the Maya long count were ending units, whereas the principal Mexican counter was a haab with a year-bearer having a beginning date. Not only were there different mental attitudes, but the haab of 365 days con- formed better to seasonal requirements than a tun of 360 days. Consequently, the 365-day haab of current time would find favor with the masses, while conservatives would cling to the 8 Morley, 1927, p. 236. 9 Ruppert, 1927, p. 256; also 1931a. 10 Ruppert, 1931b, p. 109; also 1935. 1 Pollock, 1936, pp. 160-8. 12 Thompson, 1927, p. 17. old units of elapsed time. In this unequal con- test, the Mexican method of counting current time prevailed. After the ending of Katun 12 Ahau 3 Uo, a Mexicanized calendar, identifiable by means of a shift in the month-coefficients, came into general use. It is uncertain when the change took place, but the fact that there was a shift of 18,980 month-coefficients in a calendar round is sufficient proof of a radical change. Calendrical shifts for adequate cause are not unusual. The Gregorian reform of 1582 was a forward shift of ten days. England in 1752-53 shifted the commencement of the year from the 25th of March to the 1st of January. An account of how the shift in the coefficients of Maya months may have come about will be presented. The old Maya calendar measured elapsed time; the new Yucatecan calendar measured current time. Transition from the old to the new could have been effected by use of a simple transformation coordinate. As an illustration, a selected katun ending date, 10 Ahau 8 Muan, with a comparative Julian date, May 18, 1448, will be transformed into a katun beginning date. 10 Ahau 8 Muan, katun ending, 1448 V 18 minus 4.0 -80 days 8 Ahau 8 Zac, katun beginning, 1448 II 28 To prevent confusing the new calendar of current time with the old calendar of elapsed time, the month coefficient of Zac is shifted from 8 to 7-a shift that automatically pro- vides the new calendar with 18,980 distinctive dates in a calendar round. The relationship be- tween 1 Pop of each calendar will be shown.

By counting forward 217 days, a date 11 Chuen 18 Zac, corresponding to February 15, 1544, is reached. A valid double date 11 Chuen 18 Zac, February 15, 1544, is entered on page 115 of the Mani manuscript and also on page 8 of the Tizimin manuscript. In the Europeanized calendar of the Yucate- cans, 10 Chen fell on January 1, and 1 Pop on July 16. The circumstances under which this calendar came into use will be discussed. On December 8, 1526, was published the Capitulation or patent to Francisco de Montejo, a native of Salamanca, Spain. The title of Adelantado was conferred on Montejo. He was named Gobernador and Capitan General and made Alguacil Mayor of Yucatan. Portions of stipulated royal revenues were assigned for the maintenance of clergy and churches until the Church was formally established in the province. An ordinance of November 17, 1526, which was incorporated in the Capitulation, provided that each expedition of discovery, conquest, and trade should include two qualified mem- bers of the secular or regular clergy. The Span- ish Crown and the Adelantado were sincere in emphasizing the spiritual obligations felt in regard to colonization. It was intended and de- sired to draw the Indians to true knowledge of God and of His Holy Faith through its preach- ings and through the example of properly en- dowed clergy. In accord with his patent, Montejo brought with him to Yucatan towards the close of Sep- tember, 1527, two members of the secular clergy, Juan Rodrigues de Caraveo, his own chaplain, and Pedro Fernandez, chaplain of the Armada. Also he brought a member of the regular clergy, a Carmelite, Fray Gregorio de San Martin.'3 The immovable Feast Day of the Carmelite order was July 16, the Day of Our Lady of Mount Carmel that had been instituted in the last quarter of the fourteenth century. At no time before or after the Gregorian reform did this ecclesiastical Feast Day fall on July 26. In 1528, Montejo defeated the natives at Chauaca and at Ake, receiving after both de- feats the allegiance of the local leaders. In the latter part of 1528, the Contador, Alonso de Avila, second in command, moved Salamanca from Xelha where Montejo had established it the prior year to the more favorable site of Xamanha. Montejo was appointed Alcade Mayor of Tabasco in 1529. Aided by his son he pacified Tabasco and Xicalango. The third town of Salamanca was established at the latter place. Avila, who was brought from the east coast in 1530, reduced the province of Acalan where he founded the fourth Salamanca. In 1531, Montejo and his son met Avila at Champoton, moved the combined troops by sea, and established a base at Campeche which became the fifth town to be given the name of Salamanca. On St. Barnabas Day, June 11, 1531, Montejo celebrated a victory over the natives of the region, after which the province of Ah Canul was subjugated. Later in 1531, Avila founded the town of Villa Real at Chet- umal on the east coast of Yucatan. Meanwhile, the secular and regular clergy, engaging in missionary work, preached Chris- tianity. Natives old and young were baptized and received into the church. In the years 1529, 1530, 1531, and 1532, the Yucatecan date 10 Chen fell on the Christian New Year's Day, January 1; and in 1528, 1529, 1530, and 1531, the Yucatecan New Year's 13 Tozzer, 1941, p. 48, note 234. 56 [1, 1947</page><page sequence="5">YUCATECAN CHRONOLOGICAL SYSTEMS Day, 1 Pop, fell on the Carmelite Feast Day, July 16. January 1 and July 16 in 1531 were Sundays. During the period from March 1, 1528, to February 28, 1532, the Yucatecan haab was Christianized and attached to the European year. The Spaniards defeated the inhabitants of Tiho on St. Barnabas Day, June 11, 1541, and formally founded Merida on Epiphany Day, January 6, 1542. In accordance with the Euro- peanized calendar, the native date 1 Pop, with a year-bearer 13 Kan, fell on July 16, 1541; 10 Chen fell on Sunday, January 1, 1542; and 1 Pop, with a year-bearer 1 Muluc, fell on Sun- day, July 16, 1542. Landa, who did not reach Yucatan until 1549, writes14 that the natives had a year of 365 days plus 6 hours, and from these 6 hours a day was made every 4 years, so that they had a leap-year. Before the arrival of the Spaniards, the Yucatecans had no year of 366 days. After the haab was Christianized, they acquired European leap-years. Whether Landa wrote in 1553, 1564, or any other year, he would find, in conformity with the Europeanized calendar, 10 Chen falling on January 1, and 1 Pop falling on July 16. Ten Chen was equated with January 1, and 1 Pop with July 16, by writers of the seven- teenth and eighteenth centuries-including transcribers of the Nah, Tekax, and Kaua manuscripts-and by the scholarly Juan Pio Perez in the forties of the nineteenth century. Don Perez in his Maya Almanac'5 conformed to the Europeanized calendar by equating the correct year-bearer 1 Kan on 1 Pop with July 16, 1841, and 10 Chen with January 1, 1842. Although native writings are usually reliable concerning year-bearers, they are replete with contradictory statements about katuns. Ac- cording to Landal6 the Yucatecans were wont to take katun stones and set them up in temples ten tuns or years before the katuns be- gan. The taking and setting up a katun stone may have been confused later with the com- mencement of the katun. A passage of consider- able weight in the second document of Yaxku- ku117 states specifically that 1517 was the year when the katun ceased to be taken, when the chronographic stone ceased to be set up. 14 Tozzer, 1941, p. 134. 15 Stephens, 1843, Vol. I, pp. 448-58. 6 Tozzer, 1941, p. 168. 17 Martinez, 1926a, p. 16. To conclude, the Yucatecans evidently em- ployed three different chronological systems having Maya nomenclature. ADDENDA Relative to sixteenth century Yucatecan calendars, a clause will be examined which reads: " . . . Landa's statement that the year started on July 26."18 Landa in the Relaci6n de la Cosas de Yucatan, written about 1566, began his calendar with a New Year's Day, Sunday January 1. A few of his Christian dates are selected and equated with uinal dates. Sunday January 1 10 Chen Thursday January 12 1 Yax Tuesday July 11 1 Uayeb Sunday July 16 1 Pop If Landa's date July 16 were shifted to July 26, the New Year's Day would shift to January 11, and Christmas would fall on January 4. Next will be considered a statement: "The 11 Chuen 18 Zac double date, as amended by Martinez to equal February 25, leads to July 23, 1553, for 1 Pop."19 An entry on page 115 of the Mani manuscript and a like entry on page 8 of the Tizimin manuscript state that 11 Chuen 18 Zac fell on February 15, 1554. In Paralelismo,20 Martinez writes that learned Indians convened at Bacalar on the Bay of Chetumal in 1544, consulted books which are no longer available, and determined that 11 Chuen 18 Zac corresponded to February 15, 1544. The date 11 Chuen 18 Zac which is explicitly equated with February 15, 1544, con- sistently falls in a year 2 Ix of a native calendar that had 1 Pop corresponding to July 13, 1543. Proposed amendments of the logically sound double date prove on analysis to be unsatisfac- tory. For instance, in his amending, Martinez took an extraneous almanac that was awry, used a three-ply shift, and obtained some dates of a year 13 Kan in which 11 Chuen 18 Zac did not fall. With an irrelevant year 12 Kan, Thompson amended the amendment. The double date 11 Chuen 18 Zac, February 15, 1544, complete and consistent, bears in- ternal evidence of authenticity. Besides being valuable in differentiating sixteenth century Yucatecan calendars, it supplies a criterion for testing correlation theories. 18 Thompson, 1935, p. 56. 19 Ibid., p. 56. 20 Martinez, 1926b, p. 5. 57 WEITZEL]</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY BIBLIOGRAPHY MARDEN, L. 1936.
