Bartley's deci- sion to approach these questions through an examination of the poems' digressions and similes is apt. Glancing at recent work on Homer, for instance, we find that digressions and similes continue to provoke.' In an introductory chapter, Bartley reminds us of what exactly these works are and then attempts (in the space of six pages) summaries of "Similes in heroic and didactic epic," "Digressions," and "Digressions in heroic and didactic epic." Here, there is little hint of the level of detail found in the remainder of the book. Chapters 2 and 3 divide the poems' digressions and similes, respectively, into three categories and analyze the relevant passages in the order that they appear, first in the Halieutica and then in the Cynegetica. The degree of allusion to earlier works is the primary basis for classification in a given category, such as "Digressions modeled on a range of passages." The focus of the study is on epic prece- dents, but Bartley periodically takes note of interaction with works in other genres. In putting these poems under the intertextual microscope, he explicitly aligns his study with Steven Hinds' recent presentation of the range of possible intertextual relationships (25).2 Bartley begins his dis- cussion of each passage with a summary of its main points of interest and then presents a thorough line-by-line analysis in the manner of a schol- arly commentary. These detailed comments on points of style and vocabu- lary will be particularly useful to scholars of these texts. This taxonomic approach allows the author to emphasize the degree to which these poets interacted with their predecessors in the construction of any given digression and simile. Bartley's close readings are consistently informative: Oppian alludes to a passage from Nicander in comparing the fighting between the muraena and the octopus to that between a stag and a snake (264-66); in digressing on when the desire among animals to mate is at its most fevered pitch, pseudo-Oppian builds on a passage from the Halieutica and perhaps turns to Vergil and Lucretius for inspiration as well (121-25). Bartley's larger propositions are clear and intriguing, such as "anthropomorphic images to describe the behavior of sea creatures is one of the most striking innovations of Oppian" (210). His method of analysis also aids him in stressing the differences between the two po- ems: in a section entitled "Other developed similes," Bartley argues that Oppian crafted several similes that reveal no debt to earlier works; he can find only one such simile in the Cvnegetica. Classification is a traditional means of addressing similes in particu- lar.3 Yet, any taxonomy runs the risk of provoking disagreement at the choice of categories and/or the placing of a given passage into a given category. In this case, some will object to Bartley's treatment of the be- ginning of nearly every book of each poem as digressive. To this reviewer's ' See M. Alden, Homer Beside Himself: Para-Narratives in the Iliad (Oxford 2001) (on digressions), and E. Minchin, Homer and the Resources of Memory: Some Applications of Cognitive Theorv to the Iliad and the Odyssey (Oxford 2001) (on similes). 2 S.

Bartley observes that slightly more than a quarter of the Cynegetica is devoted to digressions (19). It would be worth study- ing the deployment of these digressions in relation to one another regard- less of degree of allusion. Finally, some of Bartley's more intriguing sug- gestions do not rely on a taxonomic model-hints of Stoicism in the Halieutica, for instance. Anyone who has ever been intrigued by these poems will wish to con- sult this book, and certainly anyone working on them will now need to do so. Bartley's concluding chapter offers several suggestions for further re- search. Others should soon be joining Bartley in enhancing our under- standing and appreciation of these neglected works.
