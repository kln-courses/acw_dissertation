Due to the tourist boom and considerable construction activity along Yucatan's Caribbean coast many of the entry points and tunnels of cenotes and of the underground cavern system are severely endangered or have already been destroyed in this area. As is well known, Yucatan's interconnected caverns are passageways for underground sweet-water streams extend ing over thousands of kilometres and representing a unique ecosystem. For many years now, underwater archaeologists have been mapping and surveying the caverns and document ing their archaeological findings. However, this is becoming an increasingly difficult task due to the activities of profes sional looters, ignorant scuba-diving tourists and the con struction boom along the entire Caribbean coastline. Steel girders are being rammed into the ground. The tremors of traffic and construction work also endangers the lives of the archaeologists, who in some areas can only risk diving on Sundays when the construction workers rest. Large pyramid discovered in Mexico City Boston/Hamburg/München/London (The Christian Sci ence Monitor/Spiegel Online/Yahoo Deutschland/Reuters). A large pyramidal structure has been discovered under the Cerro de la Estrella, formerly thought to have been a natural hill, in Iztapalapa, in the southeastern part of Mexico City. The site overlooks this vast suburban neighbourhood, consid ered to be one of the city's poorest and most dangerous. The north side of the pyramid opens onto a large square, the limits of which are defined by a low stone wall. On the south side there is another much smaller structure, with holes in the walls where offerings were placed. The pyramid is 18 m high. At its base it measures 150 by 120 m, which corresponds in size to the base of the Pyramid of the Moon at Teotihuacan. According to INAH archaeolo gist Jesús Sánchez, who directs the excavation project at the Cerro de la Estrella, it was constructed between 400 and 500 A.D. as part of an ancient settlement belonging to the Teotihuacan cultural sphere. The pyramid was abandoned in the early 9th century. Later it was remodelled and fortified by the so called Coyotlatelco culture, which is believed to have had a close relationship to that of the Toltecs. Full exploration of the pyramid is not planned because the Cerro de la Estrella is now considered a religious centre in its own right. The hilltop has been an important ceremonial place of Catholicism for more than two hundred years. Every year, the hill covering the pyramid attracts thousands of pilgrims on Good Friday to watch a theatrical re-enactment of the cruci fixion of Christ. It is one of Latin America's best-known Holy Week rituals. For years, Catholics attending the event were unaware that the newer tradition took place o ver a Teotihuacan ritual site. The find is one of many examples in Mexico of important Prehispanic sites that have become Catholic places of worship. Churches were built atop ancient shrines and pyramids in sites around Mexico, including Chalma and Cholula near Mexico City. The Mexican capital's massive cathedral was built of stone from pyramids razed by the Spaniards. mexicon • Vol. XXVIII • Juni 2006</page><page sequence="2">Sánchez suspects that there might be much more Pre- The carving represents three anthropomorphic male fig columbian cultural material in the vicinity of the pyramid, ures, a central one with a fleshless skull flanked by two The pyramid's discovery has excited residents, but also raised decapitated and mutilated ones.
