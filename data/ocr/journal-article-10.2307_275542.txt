<plain_text><page sequence="1">GOLD ORNAMENTS OF CHAVIN STYLE FROM CHONGOYAPE, PERU S. K. LOTHROP fHAVIN DE HUANTAR is a small village located in the Depart- ment of Ancash in the high mountains of central Peru. Near the modern town is a vast, partly subterranean temple, dating from prehis- toric times, within and near which have been found numerous stone carvings of distinctive styles. The name Chavin has thus been applied to a very ancient culture which apparently once dominated the northern interior of Peru and, in places, emerged in the coastal valleys. The existence, if not the status, of Chavin culture was brought to the attention of the outside world many years ago by Antonio Raimondi, whose name clings to the celebrated stone carvings seen in Fig. 27, b.' Charles Wiener has left a description of the great temple at Chavin and the huge dagger-like stone carving that was its chief idol. Plans and photographs have been recently published by Cornelius Roosevelt. In 1919, Dr. Julio C. Tello made a most important journey to the northern highlands of Peru, where he discovered a quantity of new carvings at Chavin itself, as well as at other sites, such as Yauya, Aija, etc. As a further result of this trip, Tello was able to isolate at Chavin, a small percentage of pottery from the Chimu region on the coast, by its stylistic relationship to the stone sculpture, and thus to indicate that Chavin was in part contemporaneous with the Early Chimu culture. This surmise was definitely proved by Kroeber on the basis of grave association of the two cultures discovered many years before by Uhle at Moche. Subse- quent excavations by Tello in the Nepefia valley have revealed a stratig- raphy with Early Chimu remains lying over Chavin so that the latter is now known to precede in part the Early Chimu culture, to which ap- proximate dates of 200 to 900 A.D. are usually assigned. ' The history of the Raimondi monolith, most famous archaeological specimen in Peru, has been preserved by Jose Toribio Polo. It was discovered about 1840 in front of the temple at Chavin by one Timoteo Espinosa while cultivating his fields. Apparently it once had been set in the facade, from which it had fallen. For many years thereafter it served as a table and the back at times was used as a grinding slab. In 1873 the existence of the sculpture was brought to the attention of the authorities in Lima who ordered it to be transported thither. To accomplish this it was necessary to enlarge the road by blasting, but in 1874 the stone arrived safely in the charge of Sergeant Major Jose Man- uel Marticorena, the journey having cost 467 soles, 50 centavos. It is now in the National Museum of Archaeology in Lima. 250</page><page sequence="2">LOTHROPI GOLD ORNAMENTS OF CHA VIN STYLE FROM PERU 251 Chavin art, in spite of its proven antiquity, is not regarded by most students as a homogeneous unit springing from a single source. It has repeatedly been noted that the curling fangs on the headdress of the Raimondi stone (Fig. 27, b) show relationship with the art of Nasca from southern Peru. More specifically, Kroeber2 points out that the resemblance is not to the relatively severe designs of his very early pot- tery period A, but to the complex developments of period B, dating just before the penetration of Tiahuanaco-Epigonal influence to the southern coast (ca. 700 A.D.). We may add that the subject portrayed on the Rai- mondi monolith, a full face figure holding a staff in either hand, also is characteristic of Late Nasca but not of Nasca A. Another connecting link between the two cultures is the presence in Chavin goldwork of mouth masks closely resembling Nasca specimehs.3 In addition to the Nasca elements, the Chavin style embodies the use of vigorous curved lines and conventionalized heads which recall Maya sculpture (e.g., Plate XVII, d, e) and it has even been suggested that Chavin culture is a direct offshoot of the Maya, introduced to South America by migration. This hypothesis, however, must be re- jected because the available evidence on dating indicates that the classi- cal Maya style developed at about the same time or after that of Chavin.4 Most of the gold ornaments herein illustrated were not discovered at Chavin itself, but some 450 kilometers to the northwest near Chongo- yape, a small town situated about 50 kilometers from the sea in the Lambayeque valley. They consist of two distinct groups which were found in different localities as well as sQme scattered specimens.5 The first lot we shall describe was encountered in 1928 or 1929 under the fol- lowing circumstances:6 "A few years ago, Floro Morrofui, a boy of fifteen, accompanied by several other boys younger than he, found a hoard of gold in the bottom of a trench formed by a break in an irrigation ditch on the Hacienda 2 Kroeber, 1930b, p. 16. 3We have seen examples in a private collection in New York. They were purchased in the Callej6n de Huailas and it was said that they came from Chavin itself. Nasca mouth masks are illustrated in Lothrop, 1938, Plates XXXI and XXXII. 4Lothrop, 1936, p. 72. 5 All specimens illustrated, unless otherwise acknowledged, are in the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation, to which institution I am indebted for photographs and drawings. 6 Tello, 1937.</page><page sequence="3">252 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [3, 1941 Almendral, property of the Gayoso brothers of Chongoyape. Morrofui collected the objects and started to play with them, distributing the pieces he had found among his companions.

The specimens which ultimately reached New York, illustrated in Plates XVI and XVII, include: 3 tall gold crowns 4 undecorated ear spools a gold head band 7 decorated ear spools a pair of gold tweezers Turning now to the gold itself, Plate XVI, a shows a golden cylinder, which we believe to be part of a crown rather than part of a vase. We are of this opinion firstly because it is the right size to fit the head. Secondly, it is of exactly the same circumference as the golden head band in Plate XVII, b. Thirdly, the two other golden cylinders in Plate XVI have a portion missing, but, when the original circumference is calculated, as may be done fairly accurately by restoring the lost portions of the design the result is a cylinder of equal size. This correspondence in circumfer- ence of the four specimens can scarcely be fortuitous and, as they are too large to be worn except on the head, it is probable that all are crowns made for one individual. The construction of these specimens must have followed approxi- mately the following sequence: in the first place, gold was beaten into a large rectangular sheet, which was cut so that the sides were parallel and the corners rounded; three opposing pairs of holes were then drilled on the narrow sides. We believe that the maker must have bent the sheet of gold into a cylinder and secured it before the embossing, because the re- lief is so high that otherwise the metal would have buckled unevenly. The relief was pressed out with tools of various sizes, as may be seen by close inspection of the surface. There are no indications of hammering. From the construction and style of the crowns and from other examples of Chongoyape gold work we may feel certain that we are in contact with a remote period before many of the metallurgical processes had been discovered. At the same time,- the intricate design, the artistic merit and the complex symbolism all indicate an era of high culture. The pattern on the largest crown, repeated three times with slight variations,7 is a plumed jaguar head encompassed by two serpents (Fig. 26, b). The essential characteristics of the jaguar head, such as the presentation of the nose, mouth and teeth, eye, scrolls at the back of the I The drawings of this and other pieces were not necessarily made from the side photographed and hence may exhibit divergencies.</page><page sequence="7">254 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [3, 1941 head, etc., correspond very closely to a group of sculptures found at Chavin itself by Tello. For comparison we reproduce one of his illustra- tions in Fig. 27, c. The resemblance is perhaps not so close that we may assume absolute contemporaneity, but it is very striking, in view of the different materials in which they were produced. We shall not discuss the symbolism of the central pattern, which Tello8 has identified as a manifestation of the creator Vira Cocha. The serpents are one of the minor motives constantly found in Chavfn art (Fig. 27, a, b). The eye-like decoration between the serpent tails may be compared to the ends of plumes seen on the ceramics of Recuay9 and to a degenerate form of bird motive found on Nasca pottery.10 A second gold crown, illustrated in Plate XVI, c, is slightly smaller, for a fragment equivalent in size to half a unit of design has been broken from one side of the line of juncture. The original edge has rounded corners and three holes drilled in it. One unit of the repousse&amp; decoration, shown in Fig. 26, c, represents an anthropomorphic jaguar holding a staff in either hand. This conception of a standing figure shown full face and holding staffs, spears, purses, etc., in either hand has affiliations over a very wide area. In the first place, it occurs on two other examples of gold from Chongoyape published by Tello and reproduced in Fig. 28. In each case, the essential elements of the design correspond to our specimen but they are presented in a simplified form. The Raimondi stone from Chavin (Fig. 27, b) represents the same subject though rendered in a very dif- ferent manner, for the principal figure is crowned by a series of tusked and plumed heads, a simplified version of which marks the Chongoyape design in Fig. 26, c. The classic example of Tiahuanaco art is the great stone gateway at that site, and it has been recognized by archaeologists that the central figure, which holds staffs in the hands, represents the same conception portrayed on the Raimondi stone. While a general correspondence of pose may be noted, the Tiahuanaco example is typified artistically by the somberness characteristic of that culture, while the Chavin carving is flamboyant. It has been suggested that the Tiahuanaco gateway is the prototype of all other manifestations of this motive in Peru on the ground that the more simple must precede the more ornate.

Hence, we know that the simpler form is comparatively recent. While we may recognize an early Nasca-Chavin type of the man- with-staff motive, it probably owes its wide distribution to Tiahuanaco- Epigonal cultural irradiation. Similar figures holding staffs occur as decoration both on pottery and on wooden rape plates as far south as the Atacamefro and Diaguita areas both of Chile and the Argentine. Along the coast of Peru, they appear frequently on textiles and pottery; in northern Peru they were adopted by late Chimu artists and often were rendered in gold. North of Peru, a similar decorative motive is widely distributed. We note its presence in the stone sculptures of San Augustin in Colombia, of Chiriqui, the Atlantic side of Costa Rica and the Lake region in Nicaragua. It also appears in the gold work of the Sinu, Quim- baya and Chibcha of Colombia, and there are many examples in gold from Cocle, Chiriqui and Costa Rica, some of which passed northward in trade as far as Yucatan. In short, this is one of the major artistic de- signs of the New World, which, with regional variations in style, extend- ed from Mexico to Chile. Let us return to Chongoyape gold. Plate XVI, b, shows part of a third golden crown, which is thinner than the others and is broken and incomplete. The extended design, seen in Fig. 26, a, does not yield readily to analysis, although, in a general way, it suggests the highly conventionalized reptilian heads portrayed on Central American pot- tery. A golden circlet of the same workmanship as the three crowns appears in Plate XVII, b. Decoration is confined to a vigorously rendered jaguar head placed where one end of the band overlaps the other. It may be compared to a jaguar head from the stella discovered by Tello at Cha- vin (Fig. 27, d) which is now in Lima at the University of San Marcos. In the golden specimen the wing-like projection has been placed in front instead of beneath the jaw, perhaps owing to the exigencies of space, and at the same time it exhibits a higher degree of bilateral symmetry. Metal crowns and headbands usually made of silver or silvered cop- per, are not uncommon finds in the coastal valleys of Peru from the 11 An example is illustrated in Wira Kocha, vol. 1, no. 1, p. 35. Several of these jars are in the Museo Nacional in Lima.

The three Chongoyape specimens in Plate XVI are the only ones we have seen which can be assigned to a period earlier than Late Chimu. A number of golden ear disks appear in Plate XVII. According to the information received in New York, they all were discovered with the I FIG. 28.-Designs from gold sheets, Chongoyape, Peru. (After Tello, 1929.) crowns. A photograph taken at the time and published by Tello,13 how- ever, does not include the ear spool in Plate XVII, aa', which, from the technique of manufacture, seems to be of later date than the others. Tello's photograph does picture an additional ear disk somewhat like Plate XVII, e, of which he has also published a drawing.14 We do not know where this specimen now is. From the data available it is not unwarranted to assume that the Chongoyape ear spools, with the exception noted, belonged to one in- 12 Baessler, 1906, Figs. 344, 345, 380-389; Schmidt, 1929, pp. 387, 553; Antze, 1930, Tav. 1, 2, Abb. 1. 13 Tello, 1929, Fig. 107. 14 [bid., Fig. 11O.</page><page sequence="12">LOTHROP] GOLD ORNAMENTS OF CHA VIN STYLE FROM PERU 257 dividual and that, as he grew older, the lobes of the owner's ears became more and more distended. If this is so, we may place the ear spools in chronological order by measuring the diameter of the drum. This se- quence is: 1. Plate XVII, g-diameter, 2' in. 2. Plate XVII, d, e-diameter, 2' in. 3. Plate XVII, f-diameter, 2 7/16 in. 4. Plate XVII, cc'-diameter, 2 11/16 in. Several points of interest are brought out by this grouping. For one thing, the largest pair are unfinished and presumably were in process of manufacture when the owner died. It is also evident that two distinct styles, one severe (Plate XVII, f, g), and one flamboyant (Plate XVII, d, e), flourished at approximately the same time. As a matter of fact, these styles sometimes are combined in a single carving as, for instance, in Fig. 27, b, where simple angular serpent heads may be seen although the design as a whole is ornate. The elaborate ear spools in Plate XVII are adorned with a row of complex heads, in one case (d) facing sideways and the other (c) facing outwards. These designs, individual units of which are shown in Fig. 29, carry a suggestion of the Long-nosed God as portrayed in Maya art. The projecting frets which alternate with the heads on all specimens are a common painted motive on Early Chimu pottery. The process of manufacture of these pieces must have involved welding or the use of amalgam solder to join the flat decorated surface with the tube for insertion in the ear but the metal has been so thorough- ly burnished that it is difficult to tell. On the unfinished specimens in Plate XVII, cc', however, the joints appear to have been welded to- gether. The spool-shaped specimens in Plate XVII, aa', on the contrary was made of three pieces of metal (two side pieces and the drum) which definitely were joined to each other with solder. The drum, however, consists of a circular strip which was joined by welding. The overlapping tongues at the line of juncture are a characteristic of Late Chimu metal work, especially of silver cups. On account of its construction, then, we do not believe that this specimen should be grouped with the others al- though it is said to have been found with them. A pair of golden pincers from the same find appears in Fig. 30. This was a proper requisite of the Peruvian man of fashion and was used to pull out facial hairs. The example herein illustrated, from the associated material, must be considered perhaps the most ancient example now known. In outline, it corresponds to Chimu specimens which may be</page><page sequence="13">258 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [3, 1941 assigned to the Early period, both on account of this likeness and through the nature of their relief decoration. Two additional gold plaques from northern Peru appear in Plate XVIII, both of which may once have been part of the treasure from the Hacienda Almendral, dispersed by the boys who discovered it. The rec- tangular specimen (a) once was, we believe, part of a gold crown similar to those in Plate XVI, for the outside edge and the hole in the top appear FIG. 29 FIG. 30 FIG. 29.-Units of design from the ear spools shown in Plate XVIII, d, e. Actual size. FIG. 30.-Gold tweezers. Chongoyape, Peru. Actual size. to be the result of recent manipulation. The pattern represents a stand- ing figure with staffs in the hands, comparable to the design in Plate XVI, c, but more crudely rendered. The second plaque (Plate XVIII, b) consists of a curious face, framed by the heads of sixteen serpents, whose bodies overlie the cheeks and surround the features. This concept is not uncommon in Chavin art and we illustrate other examples in Fig. 27, a, b, carved in stone, both in re- lief and in the round. A second golden hoard also from the vicinity of Chongoyape came to light some years ago as the result of work on the reservoir for drink- ing water, which was being enlarged. This required excavation over a considerable area in soil that apparently was undisturbed. Three meters below the surface the workmen encountered three bodies with badly decayed bones. Accompanying them were traces of fire and funeral</page><page sequence="14">AMAERICAN ANTIQUITY, VOL.

After passing through various hands these specimens came to New York where they were acquired by the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. To the knowledge of the writer, this material represents the only Chavin tomb yet dis- covered of which the contents have been kept intact. Hence we have illustrated (Plate XIX, a-f) not only the metal but some of the speci- mens of pottery and stone. The complete contents of the grave were: 2 black pottery jars of Chavf'n style 16 ovate gold beads (Plate XX, r) (Plate XIX, a, c) 17 smaller ovate gold beads (Plate XX a fragment of a red plate q) a stone bowl (Plate XIX, b) 9 pottery beads encased in gold a small stone spoon (Plate XIX, d) 2 large pottery beads encased in gold a green stone ring (Plate XIX, e) (Plate XX, m) a fragment of black stone mirror 19 gold snail shells (Plate XX, p) (Plate XIX, f) 2 gold gorgets (Plate XX, n, o) 4 shades of cinnebar 3 gold finger rings (Plate XX, i,j, k) a gold head band (Plate XIX, g) a gold and silver pin (Plate XX, c) 24 spherical gold beads (Plate XX, 1) 4 gold pins (Plate XX, d, e, f, g) 9 spherical gold beads (Plate XX, m) a piece of sheet gold (Plate XX, I) The gold ornaments in this second lot are much thinner than those from the man's grave. The designs are of the simple school exemplified by Plate XVII, f, g, but the woman's grave seems to be of later date than the man's, because more advanced metallurgical processes are rep- resented and because some of the ornaments are more complex in their makeup. Plate XIX, g, illustrates a gold circlet cut from a thin sheet of gold. The ends are joined by lacings passed through two pairs of holes. The outer end has been slashed into four ribbons which terminate in conven- tionalized reptilian heads. Compared with the headband in Plate XVII, b, this specimen is of decidedly inferior workmanship. Gold beads of various shapes and sizes, found in the same grave, are shown in Plate XX, 1, m, g, r. They all were made by beating out the two halves separately, perhaps on a mold, and joining them together prob- ably with an amalgam solder or perhaps by welding. Like most Peruvian beads, the method of manufacture has been obscured by burnishing and can be detected only by examination of sections under a microscope. The joints run lengthwise in the elongated beads and crosswise in the round ones. Plate XX, P, is from a set of 19 golden snail shells of sheet gold, each with two perforations. Possibly these also formed a necklace or bracelet but they may have adorned a garment. Two golden gorgets appear in Plate XX, n and o. The latter is a</page><page sequence="17">260 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [3, 1941 crab, represented with some attempt at realism. This crustacean is fairly common in Chimu art, especially in the Early Period. It is ren- dered both in a natural form and as an anthropomorphic deitywith jaguar attributes. Incan stone bowls sometimes were carved in the shape of a crab. To the north, both the crab and the Crab Deity are portrayed in Chiriqui goldwork and the painted pottery of Costa Rica and Nicara- gua. The crab, but not the Crab God is a common motive in the art of Cocle. The presence of a crab in goldwork of Chavin style is important, for the crab is a marine animal and the fact that it was portrayed at Chongoyape is an indication of local manufacture near the coast rather than in the interior mountains. The other gorget (n) represents a number of intertwined serpents, each head having a second head pendent from it. They are rendered in the simple fashion of Chavin already discussed. In the center is a gro- tesque face marked by prominent teeth, staring eyes and flanking scrolls. It suggests a series of sun symbols on Recuay pottery published by Tello,15 and the scrolls are faintly reminiscent of the Raimondi stone. The golden ribbons used to assemble the various parts are a character- istic of the Lambayeque region in general, and are associated with both Chavin and Late Chimu styles. Plate XX, c-g, shows several pins of gold. In three cases the heads and shafts were beaten from a single piece of metal and the designs are in the simple Chavin style. The heads of c and d, however, were fashioned in two pieces like the gold beads and afterwards soldered on the shaft; c has a gold head set on a silver shaft. Three finger rings are shown in the same Plate. They all are of the same internal diameter and probably were the property of one individual. Two are made of wire, but the third is of sheet gold, decorated with a repousse bird head. Plate XX, h, is a very thin gold sheet of unknown use. The relationship between these two groups of Chongoyape gold de- serves a few words. The men's paraphernalia are much more massive and far outrank the women's in elaboration of design. This perhaps is the result of difference in wealth or sex of the owners, or it may represent a separation in time. The last conjecture seems probable because the women's gold embraces more elaborate technical processes and, in one case, the use of silver. That this separation in time is not very great may be surmised from a collection of Chavin gold offered for sale in New York during the winter of 1931. This collection afforded connecting links in types and technique between the two Chongoyape groups, and the designs, though exactly like neither, are repeated on classical Cha- 15 Tello, 1923, Figs. 22-28.</page><page sequence="18">LOTHROPJ GOLD ORNAMAIENTS OF CHA VIN STYLE FROM PERU 261 vin sculpture such as the Raimondi stone and the Wiener monolith. In addition to the Congoyape specimens, we show in Plate XX, b, a golden gorget possibly in the style of Chavfn. It represents a jaguar beaten in relief, over half an inch in height. Plate XX, a, shows a scallop shell cast in solid gold. Mr. Albert Gallatin of New York possesses two similar pieces. It is difficult to assign them to a definite culture as, re- gardless of period, they are the only examples of massive cast gold or silver we have seen from the Lambayeque region. The Chongoyape gold finds are important not only as a manifesta- tion of Chavin culture but because they aid in clarifying the history of northern Peru. Until their discovery, no archaeological remains were known which were other than of Late style Chimu.'6 Kroeber,'7 one of the most recent students of the north coast, writes: "I did not see a sherd, nor do I know of a north Chimu vessel in or out of Peru, that is Early Chimu, Middle period-Epigonal, Ecuadorean, Mexican, Chavin, Requay, or distinctly local in style." Although it might seem incredible, there nevertheless was no indication that northern Peru had been occu- pied for more than a few centuries before Pizarro. As a result of the Chongoyape finds and other more recent discoveries, however, we now know that Chavin culture had penetrated to the north coast, and further excavations will doubtless yield additional manifestations of it. Archae- ology is thus projected farther into the past, although in the north, as elsewhere in Peru, we are far from the beginnings. This conclusion is in accord with the altered picture of the north Peruvian coast which has been emerging in recent years largely as the result of investigations carried out by Dr. Julio C. Tello. The Early Chimu culture in unadulterated form is known to be confined to the Valleys of Chicama, Trujillo, Viru, Chao and Santa and is limited to the coastal belt. To the south of this area, Tello has found that Chavin culture extended to the coast in the Nepefia valley18 and, more re- cently, has discovered another type of highland culture in the Casma valley.19 Furthermore, Tello20 has also found stratified refuse at the Huaca de la Ventana in the Lambayeque region, with Late Chimu pot- sherds overlying those of Chavin. From these discoveries it is clear that coastal Peru in early times not only was populated by peoples emerging from the mountains but that large areas were dominated by the moun- tain cultures for many centuries after settlement had taken n1ace 16 Means (1931, Fig. 79) has subsequently illustrated a vessel of Chavin style found near Morrop6n in the Department of Piura. 17 Kroeber, 1930a, p. 97. 18 Means, 1934a, 1934b. 19 Described in a newspaper article published in Lima, also in the Report of the In- stitute of Andean Research, 1937-1938. 20 Tello, 1937.</page><page sequence="19">262 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [3, 1941 BIBLIOGRAPHY ANTZE, GUSTAV 1930.
