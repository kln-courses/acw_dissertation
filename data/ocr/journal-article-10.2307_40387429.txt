Oceania 44 Supplement (2009) 49-69 Dampier Archipelago petroglyphs: archaeology, scientific values and National Heritage Listing JO McDONALD and PETER VETH Keywords: Pilbara, Dampier Archipelago, petroglyphs, National Heritage List Abstract In 2007 the Dampier Archipelago petroglyph province was included on the National Heritage List. This paper outlines the process of determining the province's scientific values. We briefly describe our findings, which are based on all existing site data lodged with regulatory authorities. We synthesize published and unpublished systematic survey and rock art recording data collected over three decades for research and environmental impact assessment. Based on this synthesis we provide the first thorough analysis and contextualisation of petroglyph sites across the Archipelago. We compare this art province with other art style provinces in the Pilbara. The Dampier Archipelago comprises 42 islands off the coast of Karratha in the Pilbara of Western Australia (Figure 1). These islands range in size from &lt;2 ha to more than 3 square kilometres. Murujuga (also known as the Burrup Peninsula and formerly as Dampier Island) is much larger - 27 km long and 5 km wide. Prior to industrial development and the building of the causeway between Karratha and Dampier, Murujuga was separated from the mainland by tidal mudflats. Dampier is the port for distribution of iron ore from the Pilbara and is also a focus of gas processing from the North-West Shelf. The Archipelago is also home to a remarkable rock art province. In 2004, the Dampier Archipelago was nominated for inclusion on the National Heritage List. The (then) Department of Environment and Heritage (now Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts) commissioned the authors to assess the scientific values of the nominated area (JMcDCHM 2005, 2006). The Federal Environmental Protection and Biodiversity (EPBC) Act 1999, defines scientific significance as one of the criteria to be considered by the Australian Heritage Council (AHC) in assessing places to be added to the National Heritage List.

Our rock art analyses and study of existing site data concluded that the Dampier Archipelago petroglyph province is of outstanding scientific significance. In late 2006, the AHC published their findings which 49</page><page sequence="2">recommended that five of the eight EPBC Act heritage criteria had been met (http://www.deh.gov.au/heritage/laws/ publicdocuments/pubs/105727_07). It is only necessary for an area to meet one criterion to be added to the List. The AHC also recommended that the boundary of the listed area include all lands which had not been impacted by existing industry and residential development. In July 2007, the Honourable Malcolm Turnbull listed 99% of the area recommended and indicated that a detailed Plan of Management would be devised to ensure that this outstanding heritage landscape will be conserved. Woodside's Pluto Β development - an area which was identified by our study as containing National Heritage Values - represents, we believe, the 1% of land with values excluded from the area recommended by the AHC. This paper highlights the results of our two studies, the first concerned with 'heritage' (i.e. all archaeological evidence), the second focussed primarily on the rock art and significant stone features. The stylistic variability evident in the art of the Archipelago is briefly described as is its representativeness of Pilbara rock art generally. The development of a predictive model for petroglyph sites is outlined, as are the results of our landuse impact assessment. Our desktop analyses have utilised the results of systematic surveys done over the last 30 years as part of the cultural heritage assessment processes related to industrialisation. We do not explore the political and management aspects of the outcome as these have been described elsewhere (see Bednarik 2002, 2006; Vinnicombe 2002) and are ongoing. The known and predicted distribution of heritage The Brief for the first desktop study was to: • identify known scientific values for the Indigenous cultural heritage in the Dampier Archipelago; • establish the known and predicted distribution of this heritage across the landscape; and, • compare the range of motif types in the Dampier Archipelago with the range of motif types at other sites in the region to establish how representative the art on the Dampier Archipelago is of the region as a whole. The WA Department of Indigenous Affairs' Site Register was examined and all sites lodged with the DIA were audited. Only restricted sites were excluded. There are 2581 sites recorded within the study area of which 2534 had sufficient or appropriate information for an analysis of their cultural components. Many sites have more than one component and because of the array of component variation, site types are indicated here as major site types and major site type combinations. A detailed analysis of each component was undertaken for the first study (Table 1). Site distribution The known distribution of recorded sites largely reflects the location of current or proposed industry, where archaeological surveys prior to industrial development have Site type No. % Artefact scatter 220 8.6 Artefacts scatter combinations 135 5.3 Ceremonial 2 0.1 Ceremonial combinations* 5 0.2 Engraving 1070 42.2 Engraving combinations 543 21.3 Fish trap combinations* 4 0.2 Grinding patches 53 2.1 Historical 1 0.0 Man-made structure 327 12.7 Man-made structure combinations 45 1.6 Midden 53 2.1 Modified tree 3 0.1 Mythological 3 0.1 Mythological combinations* 9 0.4 Quarry 3 0.1 Quarry combinations 61 2.4 Repository/cache 1 0.0 Repository/cache combinations* 5 0.2 Rocksheiter combinations* 3 0.1 Burial 1 0.0 Burial combinations* 4 0.2 Total 2,534 100 Table 1.

Many have subsequently been destroyed. The only systematic survey that has been done in the study area, not related to development, is the NEGP survey (under the National Estate Grants Programme: Veth et al 1993). The 570 sites recorded by Bednarik (2002:29) have not been entered in the DIA Register and were unavailable for our analysis. Based on previous surveys in the area we identify the following about the known and predicted distribution of heritage across the Archipelago. Engraving (petroglyph^) sites In 2004 there were 1070 recorded sites that contained engravings alone and another 526 where engraving is one of multiple site components (JMcDCHM 2005: Table 6, Figure 10). Petroglyphs covered by midden at Skew Valley date to before 3800 years ago while others associated with the 1 'Petroglyphs' and 'Engravings' are used interchangeably throughout this paper to refer to the rock art images from the Dampier Archipelago. Both terms imply that various techniques have been applied by the artists, removing the stone matrix to form the resultant image. 'Petroglyph' as a term has been long-used in the Australian art literature (e.g. Worms 1954, Hossfield 1966, McCarthy 1968, Maynard 1977), but is generally not as popular amongst Australian archaeologists as 'engraving'. The DIA Site files refer to 'Engravings' as the rock art site type present within the nomination area(s). Recent publications on the Dampier Archipelago (e.g. Bednarik 2002, 2006; Vinnicombe 2002) use the term 'petroglyph'. 50</page><page sequence="3">Syrinx shell at Gum Tree Valley may date to before 18,000 years ago (Lorblanchet 1977, 1983, 1992). Multiple superimpositions, varying degrees of patination, the presence of desert varnish and evidence for general re-use of the boulders strongly indicate the repeated and continued usage of many sites over long periods of time.

Motif assemblage for the Dampier Archipelago (from 463 sites: 2006 analyses). The original site records (digitized photographs and recordings of rock art) were analysed and an extended motif classification was developed for this work (compare Tables 2 and 3). This has added considerably to an understanding of the motif variability and subject choices made by the Archipelago's artists. Motif Type No. % Anthropomorphs 2030 21.9 Animal 1978 21.3 Tracks 955 10.3 Geometric 2764 29.8 Unidentified 1556 16.7 Total 9283 100 Table 3. Motif categories as used in previous publications (e.g. Vinnicombe 2002). Anthropomorphs (human figures) represent 22% of the overall assemblage (26% of the classifiable motifs). There is significant variation in the way this motif type has been depicted. Marine species, including turtles, fish and crustaceans are the most frequently represented fauna, forming 57.5% of the animal motifs (Table 2). Birds comprise 3% of the identifiable motifs and include emus (no longer extant on the Archipelago), water birds and eagles (an important part of local and regional mythology). Bird tracks (8%) are significantly more numerous than the birds themselves and are more common than kangaroo tracks (2.6%). The most commonly depicted land animal is the macropod (3%) and a detailed trait analysis (JMcDCHM 2006: 115-125) revealed extreme variability in the stylistic characteristics of these motifs. Some of the macropod tracks and emu tracks are deeply pecked intaglio forms with desert varnish, indicating a significant age. Quadrupeds (animals with legs of equal length) are occasionally depicted, some with stripes across the body. These have been interpreted as thylacines (Brandi 1972; Wright 1972; Lewis 1977; Mulvaney this issue), which are now extinct. A total of 12 thylacines were included in the 2006 analysis. Reptiles (lizards and goannas) make up 2.5% of the fauna, but there are relatively few depictions of snakes (64; 0.8%) in the overall assemblage. Snakes are common on the Archipelago and in contemporary mythology. Around 30% of the Dampier Archipelago's petroglyphs are non-figurative ('geometric': Vinnicombe 2002) with the most common shapes being simple-non-figurative (SNF), complex-non-figurative (CXNF: both defined by Clegg 1987), ovals, arcs and circles. These proportions are somewhat different to those previously reported (Vinnicombe 2002: Table 2) where unidentified motifs were grouped with geometries and tracks were included in human and animal totals. Stratified caves and rockshelters The geology of the Dampier Archipelago is generally not conducive to the formation of caves and very few rockshelters are recorded there. Where these do occur they 51</page><page sequence="4">are usually overhangs formed by large boulders. One of the three registered shelters contains stratified deposit extending back to c. 8520 BP (Bradshaw 1994a, 1994b, 1995; Vinnicombe 1987b). These sequences show repeated use of such locations and document the use of key terrestrial species (euro, rock wallaby, flying fox, northern quoll, lizards) and shellfish (from mangrove, sand flat and rocky foreshore habitats). The scarcity of suitable shelters with stratified deposits means that the chronological control possible elsewhere in the Pilbara does not yet exist on the Dampier Archipelago. Middens Middens (scatters, linear and mounded) are common across the Archipelago and have been dated back to the time of initial eustatic inundation around 8000 years ago (Bradshaw 1994a; Lantzke et al. 1994; Morse 1997; Vinnicombe 1997a and b). Fifty-three midden sites have been recorded from the Archipelago, with another 269 sites recorded with midden as a component (JMcDCHM 2005: Table 7, Figure 11). Detailed midden excavations have been carried out (e.g. Bradshaw 1994a, 1994b; 1995; Clune 2003; Lorblanchet 1976, 1977, 1978; Vinnicombe 1987b). The older middens demonstrate a regional pattern of dominance by the mangrove shellfish Terebralia palustris. The last four thousand years reveal more localised environmental sequences with either Anadara granosa or a range of rocky foreshore species becoming dominant (Bradshaw 1995). Changes in shellfish species after approximately 4000 BP are linked to changing shoreline ecology (Harris 1988; Bradshaw 1995). The large mound middens such as those on West Intercourse Island and in Skew Valley provide clear evidence for the repeated collection, processing and discard of key marine species (shellfish, crustácea and fish) in association with rock art production. The sheer size, volume and age span of the major midden complexes is testimony to the intensity of occupation by Aboriginal people from c. 8500 years ago. Contact materials on the surface of major mound middens, such as on West Intercourse Island (Vinnicombe 1997b), demonstrate continued use of these localities into the contact period (Veth 1999a). Artefact scatters and quarries While the DIA site records vary in their detail, most consultancy reports from the Archipelago demonstrate that wherever intensive survey has been undertaken, surface scatters of flaked and ground stone artefacts are found. The Register included 220 open artefact scatters from the Archipelago and another 521 sites which include stone artefacts as a cultural component (JMcDCHM 2005: Table 9, Figure 11). These include both complex assemblages and task-specific sites. The larger sites provide evidence of repeated visits and a range of economic activities. Across the Archipelago, most lithic scatters are adjacent to water sources, ranging from reliable rock holes and springs through to more ephemeral sources (Brown 1987; 52 Strawbridge 1993). The pattern of human land-use is significantly influenced by the periodicity of rainfall events and maturation cycles of key economic species (e.g. grass seeds and turtle breeding cycles), which may vary from year to year (Green 1982; O'Connor and Veth 1983; Turner 1981). Quarries include extensive reduction areas with abundant debitage (Veth 1982, Veth et al 1993). Low proportions of non-local (exotic) and modified artefacts occur on these sites. On Murujuga, Aboriginal people have selectively targeted seams of fine-grained volcanics which were preferentially used at habitation sites: a range of locally available materials were used more opportunistically at smaller task-specific sites (Veth 1982). Quarrying occasionally occurs on engraved outcrops (e.g. at Watering Cove and at North Gidley Island, personal observation). Grinding areas Grinding patches are evidence of the processing of seeds and other foodstuffs. These are found on suitable bedrock slabs, generally located near water sources. Portable millstones are often located at larger occupation sites near more permanent waters. Grinding patches occur extensively across the Dampier Archipelago, near water sources and adjacent to productive mangrove flats. These features are found in association with almost every other archaeological component except burials, fish traps, mythological sites and caches: grinding patches are found wherever there are major occupation foci, and wherever systematic survey has been undertaken (JMcDCHM 2005: Table 11, Figure 12). Turner's (1981) study of 142 grinding patches from Withnell Bay established that 40 patches (28%) had evidence of grass-seed processing. More than half of these had been re-roughened (by incised lines or pecking) indicating repeated use over time. Eight of the grinding patches in Turner's study area had desert varnish over their surface, suggesting some antiquity for this practice: other patches were unpatinated, suggesting more recent usage. This economic practice overlaps with engraving: some patches occur on top of earlier engravings and pecked motifs are sometimes placed directly on top of grinding patches (Turner 1981: 44). Stone features Stone features include standing stones, placed stones, heaps and cairns, complex arrangements, hunting hides, pits, fish traps and walls. These types of features occur throughout the Pilbara but are especially common on the Dampier Archipelago (Gara 1984). Fish traps/netting are recorded ethnographically (Turner 1981) and include both non- durable materials (such as brush weirs over creeklines) and stone structure across inter-tidal flats. Some stone arrangements (thalu sites) have contemporary ceremonial significance. The DIA Register holds records for 327 stone features ('Man-Made Structures') while another 237 sites include stone structures as a component (JMcDCHM 2005: Table</page><page sequence="5">11, Figure 13). Stone pits and standing stones are included in this category and it is not always possible to discern from the records what type of stone feature is recorded. Many of the stone features are enigmatic (Gara 1984: 21; Vinnicombe 1997b: 52-57). Many archaeologists (most recently Draper 2007) question whether all examples, particularly the linear features and stone terraces, can be considered as anthropogenic. Vinnicombe (1997b: 57, citing Gordon) concluded that the linear and reticulate stone walls and terraces, while being influenced by geological and geomorphological processes, cannot all be excluded as natural. Chappell (1982) similarly found it difficult to explain the apparent size-selection of boulders in some linear patterns entirely by natural agency. Vinnicombe describes how Aboriginal custodians identify many linear stone features as being recognisably different from the surrounding stone - and their belief that these were intentionally made during the epoch of Creation (Vinnicombe 1997b: 57). A linear stone feature adjacent to Withnell Bay road is associated with the ancestral snake (Warlu) and is believed to be a particularly significant site (Morsela/. 1997; 34-36). Based on ethnographic evidence, Gara (1984) concluded that a wide range of stone features could be interpreted as being ceremonial in nature. He included the complex stone arrangement at Phillip Point and Echidna Hill in this category along with single standing stones, cairns and placed stones. Standing stones appear to be more common on the Burrup than on the mainland (Gara 1984: 17), and engraved standing stones are extremely rare outside the Archipelago. Two stone features on the Archipelago have been dated. The first of these is a hunting hide near Phillip Point - 'a wall enclosing a rectangular area 2.5 m long by 1 m wide with a floor of small stones...'. Shell and stone artefacts were recovered from beneath a corner of the structure. A shell date of 4280±100 BP (SUA- 1861) was returned (Gara 1984:3). The second dated feature is the Phillip Point stone arrangement. The prominent element of this stone arrangement is an arc comprised of 39 small mounds of coral fragments and beach pebbles. Test pits excavated into two stone circles south of the arc both revealed small shallow hearths. One of these was modern (SUA- 1873) while the other was pre-contact (410±110 BP: SUA-1874). Our 2006 analysis concentrated on standing stones (both single and multiple occurrences), fish traps, circular stone arrangements and definite mounds of stones (Table 4). We excluded terraces and stone pits per se unless these were clearly associated with cultural materials. A detailed examination of the DIA site files (and Veth et al. 1993; Vinnicombe 1997a, 1997b) allowed the identification of sites with standing stones and more complex stone arrangements. This review of the available material identified that significant and/or unusual stone features were found across the entire Archipelago. These features represent widespread and repeated efforts to modify the landscape and use its unique geology for a range of purposes. The few dates known suggest that this behaviour is long term. The ubiquity of these features suggests that this behaviour was highly structured.

One site has been dated with associated cultural material, and the other is irrefutably a cultural feature. This proportion is definitely an under-estimate of the distribution (and potential importance) of this site type. This conservative approach was taken to avoid any possibility of natural features being included in the present summary. Table 4. Identified Dampier Archipelago sites with unusual or complex stone arrangements. Contact sites There are numerous Aboriginal sites across the Pilbara that document Aboriginal occupation during the historic, pastoral and pearling periods. In 2004, only one contact site (in Withnell Bay) was registered in the DIA records (JMcDCHM 2005: Figure 14). A pilot study indicates that there may be further contact sites located across the Archipelago (Paterson &amp; Souter 2004:17-22). Contact engravings made by Aboriginal people, depicting historic themes/subjects, such as boats, riders mounted on horses, people wearing/carrying European clothing and artefacts (guns, etc.), have been recorded across the Pilbara (Paterson &amp; Wilson, this issue), but none yet has been documented on the Archipelago. Religious/ceremonial activities and the archaeology of the Dampier Archipelago The Briefs explicitly excluded an assessment of social significance, discussions with traditional owners about current cultural values and a review of restricted ethno- graphic reports from the Archipelago. This was to be done by DEH officers. Archaeological sites with possible cere- monial significance were, however, earmarked for review. Complex arrangements of mounds, heaps or lines of stones across the Pilbara are often identified as increase sites, initiation grounds or having other mythological or ceremonial significance (Gara 1984: 19). Thalu sites, some of which are still actively maintained, provide strong evidence for ongoing ceremonial activity. Thalu sites on the Dampier Archipelago are generally comprised of standing stones, boulder arrangements or simply natural features 53</page><page sequence="6">(Daniel 1990). A small number of thalu sites are registered (as ceremonial or mythological/historical sites) and these are focussed on stone structures that are clearly humanly modified (Robinson 1997; JMcDCHM 2005: Figure 14; Veth 1999a). 2005 Recommendations Our recommendations in 2005 were: 1. The entire Archipelago contains archaeological evidence, particularly rock art, of extremely high scientific significance; 2. The footprint of industry needs to be consolidated to allow for the conservation of contiguous cultural landscapes across as much of the Archipelago as possible; 3. On the islands of the Archipelago (with several small exceptions) and Murujuga north of Withnell Bay (Figure 1), the cultural landscapes are scenically and physically uninterrupted and have high integrity. Site complexes and cultural landscapes which retain integrity within the industrial lands should be managed as heritage locales and their cultural values adequately recognised and managed appropriately; 4. An integrated Plan of Management for the Dampier Archipelago is urgently required to guarantee these outcomes and to ensure compliance by both land-users and managers. Sdentine values: gap analysis The Brief for our 2006 study was to close gaps that we had previously identified in the data base and to provide further information on the petroglyphs and stone arrangements across the nominated areas. The brief required that we: • develop a definition of high, medium and low petroglyph density; • develop a predictive model for estimating density and distribution of petroglyphs; • undertake a land-use impact assessment of Murujuga to estimate the extent of impact that existing industry has already had. This would address the question of the nominated area's condition and authenticity; • undertake further stylistic analysis of the petroglyphs to explore the extent of stylistic variability across the Archipelago; • identify areas with unusual or complex stone arrangements. It was initially intended that this study would include an intensive fieldwork component to groundtruth the predictive model. This fieldwork did not proceed and the baseline assemblage information still does not exist. This remains a real gap in the knowledge base. Land-use impact assessment A significant component of the 2006 study was the land-use mapping exercise undertaken to quantify the impact that industry has had on this art province. Murujuga has been subject to industrial development for more than 30 years and analysis focussed there since industrial impacts elsewhere in the Archipelago have been minimal. Two categories of impact were used: • High impact. Severe disturbances to the soil/surface. These included industrial complexes, residential and urban infrastructure, roads, borrow pits, pipelines, rubbish tips, bulldozed tracks and formed roads, dams and water tanks, drains and other excavations. Archaeological material is wnlikely to have integrity (sensu Schiffer and Gummerman 1977) within this disturbance category. • No impact. Apparently not ever subject to significant soil/surface disturbance. Some flatter areas show signs of vehicle tracks, but there are no roads or tracks or other signs of soil disturbance. Archaeological sites are likely to have retained their integrity in this disturbance category. Air photo interpretation used the most recent photo mosaic (August 2004) from the Dept of Land Information in WA. Mapinfo Professional 8.0 was used to map the impacts (see JMcDCHM 2006: 34-36). This assessment demon- strated that industrial development has impacted roughly 1640 hectares of land on Murujuga. This represents less than 14% of the Murujuga land mass, calculated at c. 118 km2. As less than 14% of Murujuga has been heavily impacted by development, more than 86% of Murujuga retains integrity. This finding has significant implications for an assessment of the area's condition and authenticity. It also provided a major contradiction to the industry opponents to the Listing who had argued that 'so much of the Burrup has been disturbed that it cannot have scientific value'. Site density Site densities and petroglyph site densities were tabulated from systematic survey results (Table 5). These results were not sub-divided into geomorphic zones (Vinnicombe 1987a), as these cannot be replicated across the nomination area. The average site density is 44 sites/kir^: the average density of petroglyph sites is 27 sites/km2. To generate baseline density ranges in different environmental contexts, Vinnicombe's (1987a: Figure 35) mapped King Bay catchment results were used and high, intermediate and low petroglyph site densities were defined (Table 6). The overall site densities in the King Bay catchment are towards the lower end of the scale, and hence these figures are conservative. These are baseline figures and require further testing on the ground. Petroglyph assemblage size is an important consideration in establishing a workable predictive model given sample size and diversity effects: i.e. the larger a site's assemblage, 54</page><page sequence="7">Survey Area Area Sites Petroglyph Sites/ Petroglyph surveyed (n) sites (n) km? sites/km?

Predictions for high, intermediate and low archaeological site and petroglyph site densities in the King Bay catchment (from Vinnicombe 1987a: Figure 35). the greater the probability that a rare or unique motif will occur in it. A large number of petroglyph sites consist of single motifs, while c. 60% of sites contain fewer than five motifs (Vinnicombe 1987a, 1997a, 1997b). Vinnicombe's (1987a) King Bay density map was used to calculate the likely occurrence of large petroglyph assemblages in high, intermediate and low-density site scenarios. Her data indicate that large petroglyph assemblages will not be found in areas where there is generally low petroglyph site density; that large petroglyph assemblages will occur where there is intermediate petroglyph site density; and that several large petroglyph assemblages could be reasonably expected where there is a high density of petroglyph sites generally. High density site locations (i.e. places where petroglyph sites cluster) are likely to contain a number of petroglyph sites with varying assemblage sizes. Lower-density landscapes are likely to contain predominantly small sized assemblages; intermediate density locales will have a mixture of small, medium and large assemblages. High density locations where continuous petroglyph locations are found were, for the purpose of this work, described as 'major site complexes'. The following baseline categories of petroglyph assemblage size were used: • Small sites: 1-5 motifs • Medium sites: 6-20 motifs • Large sites: 21-150 motifs; • Major Site complexes: &gt;151 motifs These assemblage sizes were plotted using survey data (Vinnicombe 1997a) for the southern Burrup and Intercourse Islands (Figure 2). West Mid Intercourse (with an intermediate density of petroglyph sites) has one large petroglyph assemblage (WMI-18). Nine of the 21 petroglyph sites here are small assemblages; the remaining 11 sites have medium-sized assemblages. On West Intercourse Island, with a relatively high density of petroglyph sites, there are five major site complex-sized assemblages and 19 large assemblages (Table 7). Most (70%) petroglyph site assemblages are small. On the south- west Burrup, where petroglyph site density is in the intermediate range, there is only one major site complex, while 11 assemblages are large. Medium and small-sized assemblages are less frequent than on West Intercourse Island.

The predictive model Our predictive model assumes that the Dampier Archipelago was a permanent territory for a group of c. 120 Aboriginal people at all times except perhaps during climatic extremes (Gara 1983: cf. Richardson 1886 and Radcliffe-Brown 1913). At contact, the Dampier Archipelago was the territory of the Yaburarra (with other groups having overlapping interests: Federal Court of Australia 2003). Given the aridity of the region, this area could be considered an ecorefugium, an area of relatively rich resources in an otherwise patchy landscape (Veth 1993, 2005). Other refugia throughout the Pilbara and Western Desert (e.g. Millstream and the Calvert Ranges) have also provided long-term foci for people living in these areas. While the marine resources around the islands could have supported larger groups of people, potable water was a limiting factor (Gara 1983, Veth 1999b). During times of high resource availability (e.g. shell-fish spawning, wet season, turtle egg laying) larger groups of people such as the Yaburarra' s neighbours, the Ngarluma, Yindjibarndi and Mardudunhera language speakers (and others from further afield in the Pilbara) are also likely to have aggregated here. These periods may have been marked by ceremonial activity. Our model considers the residential mobility of these groups at any one time and, importantly, aggregation cycles. Aggregation phases were important for ritual production and facilitated the exchange of language, material items and marriage partners (Gibbs and Veth 2002). The 'aggregation locale' concept (Conkey 1980) is optimal for describing art sites/provinces where groups from many disparate social groupings coalesce (McDonald and Veth 2006). Rock art produced during aggregation phases can be predicted to have high degrees of stylistic variability (Wiessner 1989, 1990). While ethnographic details on Yaburarra occupation and the role that rock art played in this specific location are sparse (cf. Palmer 1977), we suggest that the contact scenario is likely to have had a mid-late Holocene inception. Focussed coastal occupation started c. 8000 BP as soon as the sea reached the outer islands of the Archipelago. The following predictions can be made: 56 • Petroglyphs are ubiquitous across the Dampier Archipelago wherever suitable rock surfaces are located; • Petroglyph sites have been recorded in every landscape setting across the Archipelago, with proportionally more petroglyph sites being found in valleys, near coastal uplands and on inland plateaux; • Preferred locations for the production of petroglyphs are on steep inclines/enclosed valleys bordering the larger watercourses and rock pools, and on rock platforms or cliff lines adjacent to marine resources; • Petroglyphs occur at quarry sources and at a number of other site locales. They can also occur away from primary economic zones; • Recent art will be clustered around key economic zones identifiable in current geography (e.g. reliable water supplies and marine resources); • Older art is likely to have been similarly focused on palaeo-economic resources. Predicting the locations of this older art is less straightforward; • A petroglyph site can range from a single motif through to a large assemblage of motifs. A site is defined as all archaeological elements (e.g. motifs) within 25 m of each other. Site boundaries must be (arbitrarily) at least 25 m apart from each other (Mattner 1989; Veth et al 1993; Vinnicombe 1987a, 2002). The study area includes significantly different landforms relevant to patterns of Aboriginal occupation and art production. These are: • Mainland Quaternary sediments (some only c. 6000 years old); • Volcanic uplands contiguous with the mainland and which, after sea-level stabilisation, could be easily accessed at low tide from the mainland (e.g. Murujuga, the Intercourse Islands, Dolphin Island); • Proximal islands to Murujuga (requiring a short water- craft journey or swimming); and, • Intermediate and distant islands to Murujuga which, after c. 6000 BP, required water-craft access (King 1827). It is predicted that there will be different site patterning in these diverse landforms. The highest densities of petroglyph sites and the largest petroglyph assemblages will be encountered on Murujuga and the inner islands - particularly where potable water is more reliable (e.g. rockholes and dune-base soakages). Lower densities of petroglyph sites and a higher proportion of medium-sized assemblages will be found on the proximal islands, while the lowest densities of (recent) petroglyph sites and smallest petroglyph assemblages are expected on the more remote islands where there is less reliable potable water and access is more difficult. A small number of petroglyph sites will be found on Quaternary sediments along the mainland coastline where suitable outcrops occur (e.g. on the Maitland River delta) or when transported (e.g. thalu sites).</page><page sequence="9">Based on known site and petroglyph density distributions we predict that (see Table 6 for definitions): 1 . High frequencies and high densities of petroglyph sites with a range of assemblage sizes will be found in association with identifiable resources (i.e. semi- permanent water, marine resources, etc.) in coastal and inland valleys, coastal hard-rock pavements and volcanic outcrops flanking sandy embayments. Major complexes and large petroglyph assemblages will predominantly be found where there are resource foci in the landscape; 2. Intermediate density petroglyph sites and small to moderate assemblage sizes will be found in areas without identifiable resource foci; and, 3. Low site frequencies and low-density petroglyph assemblages will be found where outcropping rock is sporadic (i.e. on the tidal mudflats and coastal plain). Most petroglyph assemblages found in these landscape contexts will be small. A purposive field strategy is needed to test these predictions on the mainland, Murujuga and the proximal and distant islands of the Archipelago. Survey should include transect sampling and intensive recordings of small, medium, large and major complex petroglyph assemblages in the full range of described landscape settings across the Archipelago. The Dampier Archipelago style province To identify representative and unique sites and to assess the scientific significance of the Dampier Archipelago style province a stylistic analysis was undertaken. This work built on previous rock art recordings and analyses (Bednarik 2002; Dix 1977; Green 1982; Lorblanchet 1985, 1992; Mulvaney, this issue; Vinnicombe 1987a, 2002; Virili 1977). Our rock analyses were based on a total assemblage of 9283 motifs from 464 sites (JMcDCHM 2006) The first desktop study examined every site registered in the DIA Register and analysed basic site information. For the detailed rock art analysis (both studies) the site recordings and original photographs for every registered engraving site were digitized. The digitized images were used and anlysed using first principles. McDonald undertook this analysis and used her own taxonomy and classification system. For the sake of consistency and comparability, verbal descriptions by others were not used. The 464 sites used represent a 30% sample of all recorded engraving sites, randomly selected from all parts of the Archipelago. Almost 30% of the recorded sites did not have pictorial records of the registered assemblages and these were not used. The entire assemblage from each site in the analysis sample was counted, including 'unidentified' (i.e. unclassifiable) motifs. The analysis revealed a petroglyph assemblage with extreme stylistic heterogeneity. The sites analysed were divided into sub-regions (Figure 3) and the trait analyses Figure 3. The sub- regions of the Dampier Archipelago used in the current art analyses. 57</page><page sequence="10">were examined on this basis. This consideration of the engraving sites in terms of their proximity and/or remoteness from the mainland was a preliminary test of the predictive model. Discussion here will focus on the analyses of anthropomorph motifs, which represent more than 26% of the identifiable petroglyphs (Table 2). Our analysis also included turtles (briefly described below), fish, kangaroos and complex-non-figurative motifs. The analyses were aimed at demonstrating the art province's schemata, regional art relationships and its uniqueness in the Australian context. Australia's figurative rock art styles, with regional emphases on particular traits and different schémas, provide insights into how different social networks operated, particularly in the Holocene. In the earliest art on the continent, and in much recent art practised through the arid zone (e.g. sand and body paintings), interpretation of the graphic vocabulary relied heavily on levels of initiation and social context (Gould 1969, Munn 1973, Palmer 1975, Myers 2002). In figurative art, while often still visually ambiguous, pictures are clearly motivated by visual resemblance to the subject, and the art contains a plethora of motifs that can be interpreted as 'looking like' the natural and cultural landscape. The development of regional figurative styles from an earlier, highly iconic, graphic structure where humans appear as visual signs (Munn 1966; Rosenfeld 2002), demonstrates a fundamental shift in the nature of graphic systems - particularly in terms of the intended audience. Anthropomorphs Anthropomorphs in rock art assemblages inform us about the culture and the artists that produced them. Most Australian regional style provinces are strongly imbued with people in their artistic landscape(s). Anthropomorphic diversity on the Archipelago is extreme. This can be seen particularly in comparison with other Pilbara styles (Wright 1968, 1977; Franklin 2004) and with regional figurative styles from elsewhere in Australia (e.g. Cobar, Laura, Sydney, Mt Isa: Franklin 1984, 2004; McCarthy 1977; Trezise 1971; McDonald 2008; Ross 1997; Smith 1983). A number of different general schémas were identified for this analysis, and typological analysis was undertaken. This was done instead of a trait analysis, because of the extreme nature of the various motif forms (Table 9). Stick figures. Stick figures have 'body, arms and legs all the same width' (Vinnicombe 2002: 18). These are the most commonly depicted type of anthropomorphs, but there is considerable variation in the ways these are drawn (67 varieties were identified from the 331 stick figures counted: Figure 4). The proportions of these types varied across the Archipelago (Figure 5). Solid figures. Solid figures have infilled bodies that are fatter than their limbs. This is the second most common form of anthropomorphs sampled. Distinctly Burrup depictions include solid bodied anthropomorphs with disconnected circular heads (Figure 6: cf. Green 1982, Vinnicombe 2002).

Proportions of the different classes of anthropomorphic figures counted in the anthropomorph analysis (n=901). have now been identified including various grouped compositions (see below). The distribution of these is focused on the central Burrup, with examples also recorded on Enderby and Dolphin Islands. Profile figures. A small proportion of the anthropomorphic depictions on the Archipelago are in profile or mixed perspective. The central and southern Burrup (with reasonable sample sizes) demonstrate marked variation in this type, despite geographic proximity. Outline figures. Outlined motifs consist of a line enclosing space (after Maynard 1976, 1977) with varying amounts of internal and anatomical detail. This form is more commonly found amongst Simple Figurative styles (e.g. Port Hedland, Sydney Basin: Maynard 1977; Franklin 1984). This form is not as common across the Archipelago as stick or solid figures. Because this is a relatively rare form of anthropomorph, the known distribution may be restricted to areas which have been systematically or saturation recorded (i.e. the LNG Plant between Withnell and King Bays, Skew and Gum Tree Valley). Lizard men. These anthropomorphic figures are defined on the basis that their genitalia are longer than their legs. They have various body shapes and are distinguished from lizards by body shape and limb position. They are often associated with headdresses and weapons. These are widespread in their distribution and there is localised patterning and extreme stylistic variability with this form. The majority of these forms are single-type examples (i.e. unique). Anthropomorphs associated with material objects. Boomerangs (curved single or concentric arcs) are the most commonly depicted items of material culture. Custodians have described symbolically arranged boomerangs '(as) clapping sticks associated with music and ceremony rather than with activities such as hunting or fighting' (Vinnicombe 2002: 19). Occasionally spears are depicted, either held by humans, or more commonly, positioned in the backs of kangaroos or marine animals. Several combined traits can now be defined as characteristic of this art province (Figure 7):</page><page sequence="11">Figure 4. Dampier Archipelago stick figure categories. Figure 5.

Note that images are schematic only, in line with senior traditional owner wishes from the NEGP surveys (30 people). • stick figures with a boomerang or straight stick held in one or both hands; • stick figures with between one and four boomerangs placed over the top of the head; • stick figures with either straight or curved (up to three concentric) lines which overlap with the lower body; • stick figures with the positioning of boomerangs symmetrically on either side of the body, either curving outwards, under the arms or curving inwards and positioned around the arms; • stick figures with a boomerang or straight stick on either side of the body, a dot on either side of the head and boomerang or headdress above the head; and, • an elongated stick figure with (usually) four arcs across the mid-body line, short legs with perpendicular bar feet and a round infilled dot head. These have combinations of arranged boomerangs in hands, and some have headdresses2. There are very different emphases of these various forms across the Archipelago. The northern Burrup sample has the greatest variation, with 71% being unique (i.e. occurring only once). The outer island sample has a focus on stick figures with items held in one or both hands, while the northern islands have a dominance of stylised forms (JMcDCHM 2006: Figure 27). The large southern sample (mostly from Skew and Gum Tree Valleys) has a high number of anthropomorphs holding weapons in their hands, including the stylised varieties. The outer islands sample, however, has the highest number of stylised 'hand' forms. Anthropomorphs with boomerangs at the waists and dots beside the head are not found on the outer or northern islands. Groups of anthropomorphs. The purposeful grouping of anthropomorphs is another characteristic of the Dampier Archipelago style province. Anthropomorphs in this category are either intricately composed or joined in some manner. Forty-three different configurations were identified during this analysis. Some common varieties of this type are (see Figure 8): • Linear groups of bilateral humans, joined by the arms or hands; • Linear groups of profile humans; • Linear groups of bilateral and/or profile humans located below a horizontal or sloping line; • Groups of humans in profile arranged in pairs or asymmetrically around a vertical line(s). The famous 2 Some headdress designs have contemporary sensitivity for some traditional owners (Vinnicombe 2002: 19). Because of this, the analysis of headdresses is not included here and headdresses have not been explicitly illustrated. 60</page><page sequence="13">tttttt ΠΑ w*^ ê jyiim^l iff Hm Ψ W ^ *1iiii&gt; φφ Figure 8.

This form is also found in the Cooya Pooya style (Wright 1968) but is taken to its logical extreme on the Archipelago; • Paired humans in coitus joined by schematised genitalia; and • Humans in coitus, sharing a single central body line. These purposeful groupings of humans in various social arrangements are suggestive of intense and structured social interaction across the Archipelago at different periods of time. This, added to the high levels of stylistic variability, indicates aggregation behaviour (McDonald and Veth 2006). 61</page><page sequence="14">D2 D6 D7 Dio vu, Du 6j S D13 D14 D16 Jß Di D3 Dl5 D18 D17 D19 Figure 9. Decorative anthropomorphs from the Burrup and Dolphin Island. Therianthropes. A small number of therianthropes (creatures with mixed human and animal features) occur in this assemblage. These mostly have kangaroo/human characteristics, lizard/human characteristics, bird/human characteristics or bat-like features. Decorative infill. These motifs are highly decorative, with either dot or internal line decoration (Figure 9). They are usually large (up to 2 m in length), although some smaller examples exist. These are characterised by a mixture of techniques (pecking, rubbing and abrading). While highly decorated, these rarely have facial features. This small group of motifs appears to be of considerable antiquity. Most of these are located on the Burrup with one found so far on Dolphin Island. Size. All previous syntheses of the art (Green 1982, Turner 1981, Vinnicombe 1987a, 2002) have used broad size categories (0-30 cm, 30-60 cm and &gt;60 cm). For the current analyses all motifs were measured in 10 cm intervals. This demonstrates that further stylistic characterisation is possible when size is analysed with greater resolution. The majority (75%) of the human figures are between 62 0-30 cm, but most (41%) are between 11-20 cm maximum dimension (Table 10, Figure 10). The different anthropo- morphic types reveal further size separation. Most of the unadorned anthropomorphs (i.e. without headdresses or associated material culture) fall in the smaller size categories. Stick figures are generally smaller than all other unadorned forms of anthropomorphs, with a greater proportion (c. 20%) of these motifs in the miniature (0-10 cm) size category. All of these anthropomorph categories peak in the 1 1-20 cm size range. Open figures are the only class with &gt;10% of the motifs falling in the &gt;100 cm size range. Gender. Many of the anthropomorphs can be attributed gender. Many images are ambiguous because of the characteristics shown, i.e. exaggerated or multiple (mixed) gender characteristics. Sometimes the style of the depiction leads to ambiguity. The 'Lizard men' category was established to categorise those anthropomorphs where the motif's member is longer than the legs (see Lorblanchet 1992; Vinnicombe 2002; Hayes-Gilpin 2004). As the intention of the artist cannot be assumed, we do not know whether these depictions meant to signal the male gender</page><page sequence="15">Figure 10.

Many (34%) Dampier Archipelago anthropomorphs are ungendered while some (3%) are ambiguous (Table 11). Almost half of the gendered anthropomorphs are male. Females depicted on their own are relatively rare (6.5%). Females shown in coitus with males (i.e. in groups) are relatively common (i.e. 30 in the current sample). Many of the identified groupings (24%), however, are not gendered. Anthropomorphs depicted in association with items of material culture are predominantly (63%) male. These gender proportions are different to many other Pilbara art provinces (e.g. Upper Yule, Sherlock and Hooley Stations) where females represented 20-40% of the anthropomorphic depictions (Wright 1968: 44). 63</page><page sequence="16">Gender Anthropo- % Groups % Material % morphs objects Mate 359 493 12 16^9 64 614~ Female 47 6.5 0 2 2.0 Ungendered 247 33.9 17 23.9 14 13.9 Ambiguous 24 3.3 3 4.2 2 2.0 Lizard men 52 7.0 19 18.8 Male and 30 42.3 female grouping Mixed 9 12.7 Total 729 100 71 100 101 100 Table 1 1 . Gender information encoded in anthropomorphic depictions (n=901). Turtles Five species of marine turtle are recorded on the Archipelago. These are the green (Chelonia mydas), loggerhead (Caretta caretta), fiatback (Natator depressus), leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea) and hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbucata). Suitable nesting beaches for four of these species are found on Rosemary, Legendre and Delambre Islands. Engraved turtles (n=315) were recorded from 70 sites. The sample included examples from all three Murujuga zones, the northern islands and the outer islands. The starting point for this analysis was the 12 defined turtle types which described the 62 turtle engravings in King Bay (Green 1982: 67, 68). This was quickly found to be inadequate to describe variability across the Archipelago (see McCarthy 1961 for the Depuch Island varieties). The current analysis identified 68 turtle designs (Figure 11; and see JMcDCHM 2006: Appendix 5; Table 33, Figures 52, 53). There is a high degree of design variability and aesthetic expression. Almost every conceivable variation on this theme can be found, and stylistic heterogeneity is extreme. The most common design theme is TU5 and TU3 followed by TU24. These three categories account for around 45% of the total assemblage. The TU5 design (with central longitudinal line and symmetrically placed horizontal or angled cross-lines) may well be schematic representative of turtle's scutes (the thickened horny plates on the shell). Several design elements are variations on this theme. Quite a few of the turtle designs are relatively accurate carapace representations (TU21, TU29, TU49 and TU55: Figure 11). Several of the designs/motif shapes could be representative of the leatherback turtle (TU7, TU44, TU52, TU54 and TU63), with either proportionally large front flippers and/or longitudinal stripes. Only a small proportion (c.3%) of the engraved assemblage falls in the natural size range for 'real' adult Figure 11. Turtle types identified in the current analysis. 64</page><page sequence="17">turtles (i.e. 80-120 cm). Most (c.71%) of the turtle depictions are &lt;30 cm in size (JMcDCHM 2006: Table 34, Figure 56). The largest engraved turtles on the Archipelago are between 2.2 m and 2.5 m maximum dimension. Eleven examples are 1-2 m in size. A number of the designs incorporate eggs within the turtle's carapace (e.g. TU27, TU33, TU34, TU35 and TU41: Figure 11). Turtle compositions include multiple turtles, turtles with varying numbers of turtle scrapes, with humans (usually associated via a spear or fishing line), turtles with egg clusters and combinations of the above. A number of turtles are paired as if mating (Figure 11). Localised variation in turtle motif distribution across the Archipelago was explored using the 18 most common designs. The three dominant design types occur in all geographic sub-regions of the Archipelago, with the highest proportion of TU5 found in the northern Burrup and the highest proportion of TU3 in the southern Burrup and islands (JMcDCHM 2006: Figure 57). The central and southern Burrup samples demonstrate the lowest degree of design variability; the northern Burrup samples demonstrate the greatest variability. Large turtles (70-130 cm) occur in all regions, but are relatively rare amongst the outer island sample. Miniature turtle depictions (&lt;10 cm) are absent in the North Burrup and Dolphin Islands samples. Clear patterned stylistic behaviour can be interpreted on the basis of these results. As found with the anthropomorphs and other analysed motifs, there is a mosaic of stylistic and schematic characteristics present in the engraved turtle assemblage. In no single part of the Archipelago is the assemblage representative of the entire engraved turtle population. Regional comparisons There are distinctive style-provinces in the Pilbara and there are also clear chains of stylistic connection through this region and into the Western Desert (Figure 12). These graphic systems appear to link people over short as well as Figure 12. Language areas (after Tindale 1974 and using his orthography here) and the Pilbara art provinces (Wright 1968). 65</page><page sequence="18">vast distances: e.g. between Dampier Archipelago and the Calvert Ranges (McDonald 2005, McDonald &amp; Veth 2006). Ongoing research suggests that further investigation of Pilbara language areas and social connections may elucidate the nature of these stylistic connections (McDonald &amp; Veth 2007). Data from Wright (1968) and McCarthy (1961, 1962; Franklin 1984) were used to explore broad trends and to highlight specific regional differences. This analysis made general comparisons between the smaller art provinces and the Dampier Archipelago (JMcDCHM 2005: Table 35, 36; Figure 48, 49). The Pilbara art provinces look different, and their assemblages also contain quite different subject preferences: there are both schematic and thematic differences. For instance, the Burrup and Port Hedland style provinces are similar in marine depictions and land animal proportions. Port Hedland differs significantly from the Dampier Archipelago (and Upper Yule) provinces in anthropomorph percentages, non-figurative motifs and depictions of material culture. A small number of characteristic Upper Yule anthropomorphs (Kurangara figures: Worms 1954) occur on the Dampier Archipelago (JMcDCHM 2005: 143-148) although on the Archipelago these figures generally have less exaggerated genitalia and headdresses. A small number of Port Hedland Minjiburu figures (McCarthy 1962) were also identified on the Dampier Archipelago. On the Archipelago these were not positioned around natural holes in the rock - a significant characteristic of the Port Hedland variety where they are engraved on a different rock type (limestone). Cooya Pooya figures are stylised stick figures with rayed headdresses which frequently have small anthropomorphs positioned under both their arms. A similar graphic vocabulary is present on the Dampier Archipelago. Similarities between the Archipelago's art and that of Sherlock Station and Depuch Island include highly decorated turtles and very small humans in hunting scenes with large land or marine animals (JMcDCHM 2005: Figures 53 and 54). There are a number of unique schemata as well as definite regional graphic vocabularies amongst the anthropomorphs and turtles of the Dampier Archipelago. It is the unique schemata that reveal the essence of this art province. The Archipelago demonstrates significantly more diversity than any of the Pilbara-upland art provinces and includes examples of the smaller provinces with additional unique forms. As well as demonstrating diachronic change, this diversity indicates that this area operated as a major aggregation locale (Conkey 1980; McDonald and Veth 2006) for people in the Pilbara, particularly throughout the Holocene. Essential to the Dampier Archipelago style province are the following anthropomorphic schemata: • stick figures with a boomerang or straight stick held in one or both hands; • stick figures with between one and four boomerangs placed over the top of the head; 66 • stick figures with a boomerang or straight stick on either side of the body, a dot on either side of the head and boomerang over the head); • elongated stick figures with (usually) four arcs across the mid-body line, short legs with perpendicular bar feet and circular infilled heads. These have combinations of arranged boomerangs in hands, and some have headdresses; • schematised stick figures with concentric arcs placed over the lower body; • schematised stick figures with symmetrically positioned boomerangs on either side of the body; • schematised stick figures with a pair of dots positioned on either side of the head or body; • solid-bodied and stick figure anthropomorphs with disconnected circular infilled heads and sinuous arm positions; • profile figures with solid bodies and thin arms, occasionally positioned in rows; • groups of profile figures with disconnected circular heads. These are in a range of compositions including grouped on either side of a central vertical line; • groups of figures positioned beneath lines, as if hanging; • groups (generally long lines) of figures joined by the arms with knees bent (dancing?); • complex groups of anthropomorphs which also incorporate other simple figurative motifs; • the use of infilled circles on stick figures to indicate joints (elbows, knees) or body parts, i.e. genitalia, stomachs, hands, feet; • therianthropes with various mixed animal characteristics, particularly lizard and bird; • a small number of ornately decorated and deeply pecked anthropomorphs; and, • ornate, embellished Burrup-style archaic faces which are unique to the Dampier Archipelago. These are produced in intaglio style and sometimes have bodies, headdresses or therianthropic characteristics (Dix 1977, Virili 1977, McDonald 2005). As indicated above these distinctive motifs are not evenly distributed across the landscape. No single area could be considered to be representative of the entire Archipelago, and major art complexes across all parts of the Archipelago demonstrate internal cohesion as well as patterning and links to the rest of the Archipelago and to the broader western Pilbara. The Dampier Archipelago has been an arid sub-tropical coastline with rich maritime resources throughout much of the Holocene. While lack of reliable water would have restricted use at certain times of the year, when water was available this area formed a rich focus in the broader arid landscape. The high degree of stylistic variability across the Archipelago demonstrates its aggregation context. The</page><page sequence="19">Pilbara style-provinces show clear stylistic connection through this region and into the Western Desert. Determining scientific values Significant findings in relation to the National Heritage Listing process were: • Engraving sites would only be absent in areas already destroyed by development. This area of approximately 14 km2 (c.15%) of Murujuga (covering existing industry/ township/infrastructure) is the only area where it can be reliably stated that there are no sites with National Heritage values; • Our finding that there is intra-Archipelago stylistic patterning across the nomination areas. The import of this conclusion is that no one area of the Archipelago can necessarily be considered to be representative of the whole. It is a basic precept of cultural heritage management that a good conservation outcome must include a representative sample of any cultural heritage resource; • Much of the data used in our assessment was collected in relation to clearance (or potential clearance) activity for Industrial development. Further broad-based systematic survey and saturation recording work is necessary to allow more detailed and informed management decisions to be made about the lands in the conservation estate and within the broader area designated as having National Heritage values. The Dampier Archipelago engraving province is visually spectacular and has demonstrated scientific values. The art of the Dampier Archipelago was shown to be both representative of the Pilbara arid piedmont and unique in terms of its own graphic vocabulary. Our analyses demonstrated the scientific value of the rock art and archaeological evidence across the Archipelago, fully supporting National Heritage Listing.
