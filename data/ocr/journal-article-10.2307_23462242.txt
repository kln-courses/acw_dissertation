<plain_text><page sequence="1">The China Review, Vol. 10, No. 1 (Spring 2010), 39-62 Growth Politics in Urban China: A Case Study of Jiangsu's Jiangyin Jingjiang Industrial Park* Luo Xiaolong Abstract This paper examines territorial politics in China, using the case of Jiangsu's Jiangyin-Jingjiang Industrial Park (JJJIP), jointly owned by the cities of Jiangyin and Jingjiang. By investigating the role of various actors, both state and non-state, as well as the interactions among them in the park's development process, this paper argues that the construc tion of JJJIP generates hybrid territorial politics, which combines neoliberal style of city competition with hierarchically territorial co ordination by the state. While the state has significant impacts on urban growth, this paper further argues that, with China's rapid urbanization, the growth coalitions between the local government and large business sector are on the rise. In fact, non-state business sector has been playing a more important role in China's new territorial politics. In addition, the process of urban growth is facilitated by party-state controlled media, which are very different from the local booster media in the West. The paper also pays attention to the negative impacts of urban growth on peasants. These negative impacts include land expro priation, unreasonable displacement, and lack of employment opportu nities, which need to be solved in China's future urbanization.

As spaces of neoliberalisa tion, cities have become key political-institutional arenas, and engaged in intensive interspatial competition, place-marketing, and regulatory undercutting in order to enhance their competitiveness.' Various institu tional realignments and political adjustments, what Brenner and Theo dore called "creative destruction," have been unfolding on a range of geographical scales in advanced capitalist countries.2 Such creative destruction has also taken place in transitional China. Since the launch of economic reforms and the Open Door Policy in 1978, the triple processes of decentralization, globalization and marketi zation have become vital driving forces underlying China's dramatic economic and political restructuring.3 A new territorial politics has emerged in transitional China. Reviewing the literature on China's urban politics and changing governance, it is clear that there have been two key advances. First, state-centred urban politics has been well documented. The decentralization approach has often been adopted by scholars to explain the strong role of the local state, especially in terms of fiscal reform. Many scholars concerned with the role of local states in economic devel opment argue that the decision-making power in economic development has been transferred from the central government to local states.4 Eventu ally local states have played active roles in local economic and urban development, because they have revenue stakes in the reform era.5 Many scholars attribute the intensive intervention of local government to economic and institutional incentives brought by the reforms after 1978.6 For example, Oi argues that decentralization allows local states to gain returns from economic development, so local states have strong interests in developing local collective enterprises under their control, giving rise to "local state corporatism."7 In addition, urban growth coalition and urban regime approaches have been applied to socialist China by Zhu and Zhang respectively,8 in efforts to understand changing local governance in China. These two studies argue that a socialist pro-growth coalition is driven by the state or state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which is much different from its Western counterparts. Generally speaking, the state is the leading force in economic reforms in China, and it has set limits to and guided the direction of institutional and spatial restructuring.9</page><page sequence="3">Growth Politics in Urban China 41 Second, diseconomy and negative externalities caused by the local developmental state have been noticed. Earlier works have emphasized widespread rent-seeking activities by local state/officials for local or personal interests. Rent-seeking is a factor causing states to be ineffec tive. There is ample evidence of this in urban China, such as a disor dered land market,10 urban sprawl," and widespread illegal building.12 Victor Nee attributes the rent-seeking activities to China's gradual and partial reform.13 He argues that an institutional framework and clear "rules of the game" are still absent during the transition. Recent studies have begun to direct attention to diseconomy and negative externalities caused by heavy inter-city competition in some developed regions, such as cities' competitiveness building and the battle to attract inward invest ment.14 Some institutional initiatives in the form of urban networks and inter-city cooperation have thus emerged in recent years to overcome negative externalities caused by inter-city competition. Further studies are needed to examine these institutional initiatives. Previous studies have also overlooked two important issues. First, most studies have treated the state as a singular and uniform political entity. However, in reality, there are different types of state with hetero geneous interests, ranging from the central state to local state. Therefore, Ma called for the need to examine "the anthropomorphic nature and multiple identities of state(s)" in studying China's urban transforma tion.15 This paper selects Jiangsu's Jiangyin-Jingjiang Industrial Park (JJJIP) for a case study. It examines the process of cross-boundary coali tion-building by investigating the interaction among the provincial government and city governments, attempting to provide a snapshot of China's complex territorial politics. Second, most studies have focused on the state in the study of China's urban politics, but the role of non state sectors, including the business sector, the media and peasants, has been neglected or devalued. This paper argues that non-state business sectors have been playing an increasing role in China's new territorial politics, but that peasants constitute a feeble group in urban growth. In addition, this paper also argues that party-state controlled media are very different from the local booster media in a US context.16 Not surpris ingly, the party-state controlled media speaks for the state and party, instead of the weaker groups in urban growth. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section will introduce the background of the research site, and includes a brief exam ination of the research methods employed. In the subsequent section, I</page><page sequence="4">42 Luo Xiaolong will first examine the joint building process of the JJJIP, followed by discussions on the interactions between provincial and county level governments during this process. The growth coalition between local government and the business sector, the role of local media in coalition building, and the coalition's negative impacts on peasants will be anal ysed in the three subsequent sections. The major findings of this research are summarized in the final section. The Background of the Study Area and Research Methods Jiangyin and Jingjiang are two county-level cities located to the south and north of the Yangtze River respectively. They are under the admin istration of the two prefecture-level cities of Wuxi and Taizhou respec tively, both of which are in Jiangsu province (Figure 1). Jiangyin has a higher level of development than Jingjiang. In August 2002, Jiangyin and Jingjiang jointly launched an industrial park, JJJIP, which is located in Jingjiang, but under the administration of Jiangyin. Because of the transfer of administrative power between cities, this cooperation can be viewed as cross-jurisdiction development. Figure 1. The Location of JJJIP, Jiangyin and Jingjiang Jiangyin 0 5 km Source: Compiled by the author</page><page sequence="5">Growth Politics in Urban China 43 JJJIP is located in the southern part of Jingjiang city and lies to the north of the Yangtze River and the west of the Jiangyin Bridge over that river (Figure 1). It has a planned area of 60 km2. In 2003, the area had a population of 53,376, in 15,754 households. It contains two designated towns, Dongxing and Bawei, consisting of 21 administrative villages (xingzheng can) and 3 residents' committees. The first phase of JJJIP covers an area of 8.6 km2 with 6 administrative villages and a rural population of 14,843, in 4,697 rural households. JJJIP has grown rapidly since its establishment. By 2006, there were over 50 enterprises investing in JJJIP, 7 of which had invested over US$100 million. The total amount of investment was US$2.5 billion. In 2006, its industrial output and local revenue reached RMB2.2 billion and RMB130 million respectively.17 In the study of urban politics, many researchers have focused on four actors: the local business community, the local state, the national government and the national business community.18 They were conceived of as the dominant actors in urban growth politics. However, others argue that other actors, such as civil movements and the media, are also crucial,'9 and that it is essential to incorporate them in the analysis of territorial politics. In order to provide a panorama of power dynamics, this study focuses on four main categories of actors involved in the process of cross-boundary coalition formation. Taking into account the specific context of this case, these are local governments, business sector, local media and the peasants. The first three actors are the main players in the growth coalition in JJJIP, while the peasants are largely affected negatively by the growth coalition. In order to fully understand the formation of a cross-boundary coali tion and its effects, this research focuses on the two locations that JJJIP initially started in the first phase. Fieldwork was conducted in Jingjiang and Jiangyin in August 2003, June 2004 and December 2008, including over 50 interviews and a study of 443 rural households affected by the intensive economic and land expropriation of JJJIP. Among these, there were 20 rural households in 6 villages covered by the first phase of JJJIP whose houses were demolished for industrial development. In addition to interviews with key local officials and businessmen who were involved in JJJIP, interviews with peasants were also conducted. Addi tional data sources include newspapers, government documents, and statistical data.</page><page sequence="6">44 Luo Xiaolong The Creation of JJJIP The creation of JJJIP is a process of cross-boundary collaboration building that has involved interactions of local governments at various levels. It can be divided into two stages. The first stage was spontaneous inter-city cooperation between the two cities. After the construction of the Jiangyin Bridge in 1999, the economic ties between the two cities has been greatly enhanced by increasing investment from Jiangyin into Jingjiang. Many manufacturing enterprises in Jiangyin have set up their operations in Jingjiang. The closer economic interaction between the cities spurred the two city governments to cooperate, and in December 2001, they initiated the Forum for the Enhancement of Jiangyin Jingjiang Riverside Area Development (FERAD). The aim of estab lishing FERAD was to enhance cooperation and association to achieve prosperity for both cities. Therefore, FERAD is a form of urban network which serves a neoliberal agenda of enhanced economic competitive ness. Under the mechanism of FERAD, inter-city cooperation has been greatly speeded up. Some cooperative programmes have been carried out by the governments, such as an exchange scheme for local officials and port cooperation between the two cities. A significant step towards closer inter-city cooperation was the launch of JJJIP on 18 August, 2002. JJJIP was jointly established by the two cities in Jingjiang. Initially, a site to the east of the bridge was chosen for JJJIP, but there were no roads and other infrastructure at this site. The Jiangyin government therefore suggested that JJJIP should be located to the west of the bridge, in close proximity to roads and to Jingjiang city proper. As the Jingjiang government had a strong desire for economic development, it conceded the land use rights of this land parcel to Jiangyin city, but the area of the land was reduced to 2 km2. Obviously, while one city is far more prosperous than the other, the former has greater leverage than the latter in the collaborative project, but the latter would mobilize material and discursive resources to make the most out of the association with its bigger and stronger partner. It should be mentioned that there was little progress in the construction of JJJIP until the involvement of the provincial government. The second stage was inter-city cooperation involving the provincial government. The construction of JJJIP attracted the then provincial leaders' attention, as the joint industrial park fitted into the province's new regional development strategy—the Yangtze riverside region</page><page sequence="7">Growth Politics in Urban China 45 development strategy. This strategy emphasised the construction of industrial zones along the Yangtze River, aiming to enhance the prov ince's competitiveness.2" JJJIP has thus been set up by the provincial government as a model for development of the riverside region. Provin cial leaders made intensive inspection visits to Jingjiang and Jiangyin in 2003, and urged the two cities to accelerate the construction of JJJIP. With this encouragement, the two city governments accelerated the construction of JJJIP, and its area was enlarged from 2 km2 to 60 km2. As a model for developing the riverside region, JJJIP was backed up by the provincial government not only in terms of preferential policies, but also financially. For example, the provincial government revised the plan for the northern riverside highway so that it would pass through JJJIP. It also contributed RMB3 million per km for the riverside highway construction, RMB54 million in total.21 It is clear that the provincial government had an interest in the cross-boundary coalition-building. In short, as a new industrial space, JJJIP is a neoliberal project on an inter-city scale, and aims to promote territorial competitiveness. At the early stage, Jiangyin-Jingjiang cooperation was spontaneous, but the involvement of the provincial government changed the nature of their cooperation. After examining the process of JJJIP creation, I found that it was a hybrid territorial politics generated from the combination of neoliberal style city competition, with command economy-induced, hier archically organized territorial coordination and collaboration. The Growth Coalition between Local Government and the Business Sector To uncover the role of the business sector in urban politics, I conducted in-depth interviews with six enterprise managers, focusing mainly on the reasons for their investment in JJJIP, the local governments' service provision and the business development plan. Two representative inter views are selected below to sketch out the role of the business sector in China's urban politics. In terms of ownership, they represent both joint ventures and domestic private firms. One is newly established in JJJIP and the other expanded its operation after the launch of JJJIP. Company A is a joint venture, and one of the earliest companies established in JJJIP. The total investment of the company was US$8.16 million. Regarding the reasons for locating in JJJIP, the general manager of company A summarised three driving forces using an old Chinese</page><page sequence="8">46 Luo Xiaolong formula: good macro-policy context (tianshi), a favourable location (dili) and support from local officials with developmental consciousness (renhe). She further elaborated that: Tianshi, dili and renhe have fostered a favourable investment climate in JJJIP. Firstly, tianshi refers to preferential policies that facilitate investment for business development. Currently, the consensus on the riverside region development strategy by the provincial government and the city governments of Jiangyin and Jingjiang, as well as many special attractive policies for private investment, have created a good investment environment. Secondly, dili is also an important factor in attracting investment, referring not only to favourable locations, but also good infrastructure. Last but not least, renhe, referring to the supportive local officials keen on development and service provision, is another factor in attracting investment in Jingjiang.... Certainly, it is worth noting that the above three factors are not independent. They are interrelated and jointly affect investors' decision-making.22 It should be pointed out that many businessmen in JJJIP23 and else where24 share similar views with this manager. For service provision by the local government, the case of land acquisition by company A was a good example. Local officials from various government departments held a meeting on the spot, and autho rized company A to use 20 ha. land with a river frontage of 286 metres. According to the land lease regulations of Jiangsu province, 5.44 ha. of the leased land could enjoy a preferential price of RMB450 thousand per ha., and the remaining area should be priced at the land preparation cost of RMB1.5 million per ha., to cover such costs as farmland compensa tion and replacement cost. Bearing in mind the possible rapid increase in land prices in JJJIP with the participation of Jiangyin, company A acquired more land than it actually needed, and its manager made a firm decision to expand its operation. Company B was a private enterprise, and operated in the JJJIP area before the launch of the industrial park. It expanded after the launch of JJJIP and acquired over 13 ha. of land adjacent to the river to develop a warehouse, although at that time its headquarters were located in Jiangyin. In August 2002, it moved and registered its headquarters in JJJIP. There were three major determinants underlying the manager's decision on this important matter.25 First, in order to broaden the city's tax base, the mayor of Jingjiang lobbied the company to change its registration from Jiangyin to Jingjiang in 2001 by offering attractive</page><page sequence="9">Growth Politics in Urban China 47 investment incentives, such as tax deductions and lower land use fee. Secondly, the active participation of the city government of Jiangyin, a more developed city, and the strong support of the provincial govern ment were expected to improve significantly government service provi sion and infrastructure conditions in JJJIP.26 Finally, the gap in the provision of government services between the two cities was narrowed and Jingjiang's top-ranking local officials made great efforts to create an attractive environment for investors, regarding it as a task of the greatest importance. The manager of company B, like the manager of company A, also predicted that the cross-boundary development from Jiangyin city and the provincial government's active participation would no doubt signifi cantly drive up land prices in JJJIP. Therefore, despite the prevailing high land expropriation fee due to a great deal of demolition and reset tlement, company B still invested RMB550 million to acquire a land plot of 200 ha. with river frontage of 1,500 metres in JJJIP to construct a logistics centre to serve the whole industrial park. It should be mentioned that the newly built logistics centre paid tax to JJJIP while the existing company B was still a tax-payer of the Jingjiang government. This arrangement protected Jingjiang's existing interests, while also paving the way for successful cross-boundary cooperation. During the process of the growth coalition formation, some property developers, aiming, like their counterparts in advanced capitalist soci eties, to maximize benefits from land transactions, also emerged, pushing up the land price. For example, the Jingjiang government released two land plots (Nos. 2 and 3) on the edges of JJJIP, planned for commercial and residential use, for sale by public auction in June 2003. The Suzhou Zhongtian Real Estate Company successfully purchased these land plots at a cost of RMB 169.2 million, 100 million higher than the base price. This case created the historically highest land price in the city.27 Obvi ously, as a pet project of the local city governments, JJJIP had become a magnet not only to manufacturing industries, but also to property devel opers. JJJIP brought huge land revenues to local government. As dominant state ownership in socialist China has given way to diversified ownership due to the rising importance of privately-owned businesses and joint ventures, the economic controlling power of the state has been weakened considerably compared to the pre-reform era. But the local state still has many governance resources such as land use control and policy-making powers, while the business sector determines</page><page sequence="10">48 Luo Xiaolong investment and production. To attract both foreign and domestic invest ment, the local state and the business sector have forged an alliance to foster urban development by mobilizing their respective resources as bargaining chips. Taking land expropriation as an example, enterprises can acquire land at the lowest price that is regulated by the State Council. Generally speaking, they have considerable freedom to build anything anywhere they wish, sometimes even altering the urban plan with the support of government.28 Company C in JJJIP is a good example to illustrate the local government's concessions to investors. To avoid the high cost of land expropriation to clear a large number of rural houses, the company selected a sizable plot of land with just 26 rural houses in JJJIP. The local city government took less than one month to settle the land expro priation and housing clearance, but the forced land expropriation and clearance induced severe conflict between the local government and the peasants, which will be discussed in the next section. Another issue that is worth mentioning here is the role of small business in the formation of the growth coalition in JJJIP. In advanced capitalist societies, the small business sector also exerts greater influence on coalition-building than in China.29 According to interviews with offi cials in the Small Businessmen's Association of Jingjiang (SBAJ) and a few small businessmen, the small business sector was a passive actor10 with little part to play in the coalition-building, compared with the major role of the big business sector in urban politics as discussed above. Therefore, the construction of JJJIP did not address the needs of these small businesses. This was due to the fact that the local government controlled the small business sector by taxation and registration management. The Role of the Local Media This section explores the role of the media in urban politics, with a particular focus on the relationship between the local government and the local media. Unlike the media run mainly by private enterprises in the West, it is well known that the state and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) tightly control Chinese media, from the central to local levels. Hence, the media have to a large extent become the propa ganda machinery of the party-state. In recent years, the control over</page><page sequence="11">Growth Politics in Urban China 49 communications systems by the party-state has been weakened, partly because of the conversion of several official media organizations to companies and the establishment of new commercial media companies in China.31 But these media are still overseen by the party-state at various levels. The local media in Jiangyin and Jingjiang, all overseen by the party state, played an active role in the formation of the cross-boundary coali tion. Here, I will take the media in Jingjiang city as an example. There were only three local media—Jingjiang TV (JJTV), the Jingjiang Daily and Jingjiang Web. All of them were under dual-track controls, of the Committee of the CCP of Jingjiang and the Jingjiang Municipal Govern ment. Although JJTV, the Jingjiang Daily, and the CCP propaganda department in the city belonged to different administration systems, two vice secretaries of the local CCP propaganda department were appointed as the heads of JJTV and the Jingjiang Daily (Figure 2). It is clear that most media were controlled by the local CCP. Figure 2. The Local Media in the Party System and Government System Government System Party System Source: Compiled by the author</page><page sequence="12">50 Luo Xiaolong Early in 2002, the local media were required by the two city govern ments to focus on news about the riverside region development and JJJIP, to keep track of the provincial strategy and serve local leaders in their policy-making on JJJIP.32 In April 2003, the Jingjiang CCP's Department of Propaganda launched a series of debates on "inspiring diligence and enhancing the riverside development." In addition, two local CCP newspapers (dang bao), the Jingjiang Daily and the Jiangyin Daily, cooperated to release a series of news reports headed "Cooperating for riverside region development" in July 2003. In response to the speedy progress of JJJIP, a series of news reports on the "golden river bank and the tide of development," was released jointly by the Jingjiang and Jiangyin newspapers in August 2003. The news reports covered the latest progress of JJJIP and the opinions of some local political figures as well as the successful experiences of economic development in southern Jiangsu (Sunan). To further understand the role of local media in the coalition forma tion, I analysed the contents of news reports published online in two local media in Jingjiang, JJTV and Jingjiang Daily,33 for the period between July and August 2003. All news reports on local issues were selected and grouped into seven categories (Table 1). It made classifica tion easier, as each online news item, including TV news, had a news title. If a news item involved several categories, it was counted only once in the main category. Analysis of the news reports from JJTV and Jingjiang Daily showed that reports on the riverside region development, local economic devel opment and other news related to economic development accounted for over 60 per cent of local daily news (Table 1). Although there were reports on the life of urban residents and peasants who benefited from local economic development, reports on the negative effects of economic development on those weaker groups were rare. During the interviews, some peasants, whose houses had been demolished or whose land had been occupied due to the construction of JJJIP, said that the local media would often pick up only their positive remarks or just reported lies to serve their purpose rather than revealing the true life of the peasants.34 In brief, the local media were spokesmen of the local party-state. They were an inseparable arm of the local state in the growth coalition in JJJIP, while they clearly had much closer relations with the government than with the business sector.</page><page sequence="13">Growth Politics in Urban China 51 Table 1.

This section examines the situation of those 4,697 rural households affected by the first development phase of JJJIP, including 6 administrative villages with a population of 14,843. A questionnaire survey was conducted and 443 valid samples were obtained from 532 issued ques tionnaires including 20 respondents who lost all their land when their houses were cleared.35 Apart from the questionnaire survey, interviews with village heads and villagers were also conducted to collect additional information. By analysing the major concerns of peasants with regard to the formation of the growth coalition (for example, living conditions, job opportunities, house clearance and resettlement), the impacts of the growth coalition on peasants could be identified. In the field survey, it was found that the number of peasants engaged in non-agriculture sectors accounted for 33.5 per cent of the total population in 423 rural households. The official statistics gave a figure as high as 80 per cent or more of the total number of peasants (Table 2).36 The major income of most rural households was from non-agricul tural activities. This could be further illustrated by the cost and benefit of farming. Generally speaking, the annual cost of farming a paddy field</page><page sequence="14">52 Luo Xiaolong Table 2.

However, in a year with a reasonable harvest, peasants could only benefit slightly from their farm land, earning an income of around RMB650 per mu, and in a year of poor harvest they would suffer a loss.38 Farmland, therefore, was no longer a major source of income for the peasants, and sometimes even a source of debt, but despite the burden of their farmland, they still felt immensely strong tie to their land. According to the survey (Table 3), the peasants' survival and living standards were considerably affected by land expropriation for JJJIP. Over 50 per cent of the respondents, whose farmland was either partially converted or not converted to industrial use, indicated that land loss had had various negative effects or poten tially negative effects on their survival and standard of living. All respondents who suffered complete land expropriation acknowledged the enormous negative impact of such a loss. The importance of land to peasants lay in the fact that it functioned as a type of social security for them, as peasants had no access to the urban social security system. Without land, peasants could become vagrants because they lack the three necessities (farmland, job and social security) to protect themselves. Table 3.

Percentages in parentheses. Source: The author's 2003 survey Most importantly, peasants had little bargaining power in the expro priation of their collectively-owned land.39 The fixed land compensation</page><page sequence="16">54 Lun Xiaolong was based on the government's land regulations rather than a market mechanism. This implies that peasants could not engage in speculative activities to make a profit in China, while peasants in Western countries could.40 But the worst situation for the peasants was the low level of compensation and the unreasonable method of distributing compensa tion. In JJJIP, the rate of land compensation, including land subsidy, a fee for labour force deployment and crop damage, was as little as RMB24,000 per mu. Furthermore, compensation was not directly distrib uted to rural households. Instead, it was managed by the local govern ment or enterprises that acquired the land from the peasants. Peasants who lost land only received the annual interest on the compensation, which worked out at less than RMB200 per household per year, from the local government or the enterprises. This unreasonable compensation arrangement resulted not only in hardship for the peasants, but also in many complaints and conflicts. Some interviewees revealed that peasants whose land was lost had formed several small self-organized groups of villagers to protest against the unfair compensation and forced eviction, but that they had not achieved a satisfactory outcome. Finally, it should be pointed out that land problems caused by land expropriation were not an issue unique to JJJIP, but were a pervasive issue involved in urban growth in all parts of China at that time. According to the statistics of the State Administration of Land and Resources, complaints about land issues accounted for 73 per cent of all appeals registered with the government in the first half of 2002, and 40 per cent of those related to land expropriation. As many as 87 per cent of appeals on the land expropriation issue concerned land compensation and displacement.41 Apart from the land issue, the peasants were also concerned about job opportunities. Low education levels and poor skills, as well as an employment policy which discriminated against the peasants, placed them in an unfavourable position in the job market. First, according to an official survey, 48 per cent of the over 2,000 new jobs planned in Jingjiang city in 2003 were for skilled workers, while manufacturing jobs accounted for 14 per cent. In addition, over 80 per cent of jobs required employees to hold university qualifications and over 80 per cent of occupations required employees to be below the age of 35.42 However, according to our survey (Table 4), the proportion of population aged 18 to 35 accounted for just 33 per cent of the total and only 0.7 per cent had received higher education. Among all the peasants in the age group</page><page sequence="17">Growth Politics in Urban China 55 18-35, only 13 per cent were skilled workers. It would be extremely difficult for the unskilled elderly to find a job. In addition, the employ ment regulations of the Jingjiang government restricted those peasants who had lost land from seeking non-agricultural jobs. Due to govern ments' reforms of SOEs and consequent SOE closures, about 2,000 to 3,000 SOE workers were laid off in the city each year.43 In order to avoid political instability, the government's employment policy priori tized urban residents who were laid off. Therefore, peasants who did not have urban hukou (household registration) were excluded both from the urban labour market and from the system of social security. In short, the growth coalition had generated negative impacts on peasants, although it cannot be denied that peasants will benefit from economic development in the long run. Table 4.

The data on education level were calculated from the information provided by 423 respondents. 3 respondents who were village heads or private enterprise owners claimed that they had college diplomas (dazhuan wenping) from Party schools or TV universities. b. The data on peasants' skills were extracted from questionnaires completed by the members of 423 households (1934 persons in total). Percentages in brackets refer to the proportion of the total. There were 631 peasants aged between 18-35 (see Table 2). Jingjiang was well known as the "home of tailors." In my field work, I learned that many peasants in Jingjiang had several years of training in tailoring. Therefore, tailors contributed to increasing the number of skilled workers. Source: The author's 2003 survey As well as the land issue and the scarcity of job opportunities, house clearance and resettlement were also closely affected by the growth</page><page sequence="18">56 Luo Xiaolong coalition. Because, at the early stage of construction, only 26 households were affected by resettlement in JJJIP, there were no mass clearance and displacement activities. In line with the principle of cash compensation and housing replacement, houses were cleared and new flats for replace ment were constructed. Because a slightly greater compensation level for house clearance than the cost of house construction was adopted, at RMB200-250 per m2, most peasants were willing to accept the clear ance and replacement agreements with the local government. Only a few households that had newly-built and luxury houses refused to accept these arrangements. Moreover, using apartment buildings to replace peasants' houses could prevent the formation of urban villages (cheng zhongcun),44 so it was impossible for the peasants to become landlords who could lease housing and thereby benefit from the urban growth in the area. Although there was no mass dissatisfaction with the compensation and replacement, there was sporadic resistance to the resettlement process due to the unreasonable operations of the local government. In order to quickly clear the land for company C, for example, the local government demolished peasants' houses by force before any replace ment accommodation had been completed. Displaced rural households had to lodge in friends or relatives' houses.45 These peasants formed a small group to appeal to the higher authorities for help (shangfang) and resisted the resettlement, causing conflict between resettled peasants and local government.46 However, an official in charge of the housing replacement who was interviewed said that the local government had to carry out the replacement by force as peasants had not followed the resettlement agreements reached previously with the government.47 It was obvious that there was misunderstanding and distrust between the peasants and the government. It was likely that the government's reset tlement programme gave more consideration to the needs of investors than to those of the peasants. While court hearings are the proper mecha nism to deal with such conflicts, they are rarely used in China. It seems that there is still a long way to go for the peasants to take full advantage of rule of law in order to protect their rights and interests. Conclusion Using the case of JJJIP, this paper examines territorial politics in transi tional China. By investigating the process of building JJJIP and</page><page sequence="19">Growth Politics in Urban China 57 interactions among local governments, the business sector, local media and peasants, this paper has come up with the following findings: First, the creation of JJJIP demonstrates a hybrid territorial politics. Initially, JJJIP originated from neoliberal style of city competition. It was the joint creation of two city governments, as a new industrial space to promote territorial competitiveness. It can be perceived as a market driven project, which is similar to inter-city coordination in neoliberal capitalist countries. But the later involvement of the provincial govern ment changed the nature of territorial cooperation. The provincial government, with its interest in Jiangyin-Jingjiang cooperation, has played an active role in coalition-building, leading to hierarchically orga nized territorial coordination. In the post-reform era, there are intensive struggles among different segments of government due to diverse inter ests.48 However, this study indicates that these governmental segments tend to form alliances when they have a common interest. But this finding does not deny that a city's economic conditions and governing resources affects its bargaining power and position in territo rial politics. For example, Jiangyin is far more prosperous than Jingjiang. Jiangyin thus has greater leverage than Jingjiang in the development of JJJIP. Jingjiang has to concede more power and resources in order to strengthen inter-city cooperation. Second, I argue that a growth coalition between the government and big businesses (including non-state enterprises), similar to its Western counterparts, is emerging in China's urbanization. Due to the formation of such coalitions, the local state has strong incentive to help these busi nesses reduce their production cost by mobilizing state resources. And the state consequently benefits from the development of big businesses itself. It should be noted that small businesses are not activists in the formation of growth coalitions, as they are tightly restricted by local state's regulations. This is fundamentally different from the previous argument that urban growth coalitions in post-reform China are dominated by local government-SOE coalitions.49 Of course, there are some clear differences between China's urban growth coalition and its Western counterparts, as urban growth coalitions are affected by their political, economic and cultural contexts. For example, local economic development and urban growth in China depends much more on local officials' individual personality and thinking.50</page><page sequence="20">58 Luo Xiaolong Third, this study found that the local media are active participants in territorial politics, but they almost exclusively act as the local govern ments' spokesman. In Western countries, the media are the "voice of the community," representing different interest groups. Sometimes they can have a great impact on local officials' pro-growth stance by supporting their desired candidates in local elections.51 In China, however, most media are part of the party-state apparatus. For this reason, it is difficult for these disadvantaged groups, such as peasants, to make their voices heard in the media. In the case of JJJIP, the state controlled local media intensively broadcasted good news and positive views on the project, and often neglect the voices of those peasants whose farmland had been expropriated or houses demolished in the process of urbanization. Fourth, fast urbanization has its own price too. This paper finds that urban growth had negative impacts on the peasants in the case of JJJIP. Although farmland was no longer a major source of income for the peas ants, their survival was threatened when land was transferred and commer cialized by the local government to investors. Land is a form of insurance for peasants in China, as there is no social security system for peasants without urban hukou. Moreover, unreasonable land compensation is an important factor that has caused hardship for peasants after land expropria tion. What has made this problem worse is the fact that there were very few job opportunities for peasants, after they lost their farmland. This was not only due to the peasants' low education level and their lack of skills, but also the governments' discriminatory employment regulations. In short, the peasants were a weak group in territorial politics, and their needs in the urban growth process were not sufficiently taken into account by the local authorities. Finally, it should be mentioned that this study is a record of social problems in an earlier stage of China's urbanization, as the Chinese government has made many efforts, such as the new socialist rural scheme (shehuizhuyi xin nongcun zhengce), to deal with the peasants' problems, since 2004. Despite of some new progresses in the right direction, the findings of this study suggest that policy-makers should pay more atten tion to the issues that peasants face in urban growth, in order to balance development and social equality. Any new policies formulated by local governments should give comprehensive consideration to the issues of land acquisition, job opportunities, displacement and social security.</page><page sequence="21">Growth Politics in Urban China 59 Notes 1.

According to my interviewees, most of the investors from Jiangyin who invested in Jingjiang, believed that the participation of the Jiangyin government would improve government service provision and infrastructure conditions in JJJIP, with Jiangyin's strength in service provision and adequate capital for infrastructure development. Many companies in Jiangyin intended to set up operations in Jingjiang for the purpose of further development. 27. Jingjiang TV, 21 June, 2003. 28.

As some respondents were unwilling to answer the questionnaires or could not be reached, the valid sample included only 20 households. 36. The difference is due to different statistical criteria (population in labour force in official statistics) as well as the fact that the population of sister villages in the towns (Bawei town) are counted in the official statistics. Therefore, the official figure was higher than the results of the survey. 37. The mu is a Chinese unit of area, and 15 mu equals one hectare. 38. Interview in Jingjiang on 16 and 15 August, 2003.

Unemployment is a common issue faced by almost all Chinese cities, and is a result of urban and SOE reforms. Since the mid-1990s, labour supply has been much greater than labour demand in the urban labour market in China.
