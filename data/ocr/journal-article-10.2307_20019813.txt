Albert Einstein (Gleick 1992 P58) Richard Swinburne has had some original and interesting comments on the arguments for the existence of God, spawning a wealth of critical literature. We review some of the literature here, and add some critical comments of our own. Swinburne (1968) first formulated a ideological argument as an argument by analogy. Olding (1971) criticized this argument for its dualist assumptions about the nature of a human being. Swinburne (1972) defended his original view in a reply to Olding arguing for mind-body dualism. We address here Swinburne's later version of the argument from design, as it appears in his book The Existence of God. (1979 and 1991) In this book he abandons his argument from analogy with the dualistic nature of human beings. Swinburne provides a theistic defence against Hume of the ideologi? cal argument as well as a theistic defence of other traditional purported proofs. On a book jacket of one of Swinburne's prior books (1977) the philosopher Robert Merrihew Adams remarks that Swinburne's treatment of the argument from design rivals that of Hume; the 1979/1991 work reprises this treatment and defends other traditional arguments as well. This paper argues that Swinburne's arguments, like other theistic arguments, fail. But this paper is not a point by point rebuttal of the plethora of theistic arguments ; such rebuttals are already and even presciently available in the many offerings of Antony Flew, in Scriven (1966), in Hanson (1971), and in the works of others. Rather, although this paper mainly examines ideological forms of argument, its main goal is to illustrate some of the sorts of deficiencies characteristic of theistic arguments that may not often have been emphasized in the relevant literature. Simplicity and Teleology Swinburne relies on a principle of simplicity for much of his argument. Presumably this principle states that, ceteris paribus, when choosing between two or more hypotheses, one should opt for the simplest one; and, the simplest hypothesis is one that postulates the fewest number of attributes, entities, relations, properties, processes, assumptions, or the like. But a ques? tion that immediately comes to mind is, What justifies using this principle of 1 Thanks to professor James M. Smith (emeritus) of California State University, Fresno for most helpful suggestions on an earlier draft.</page><page sequence="2">26o DON FAWKES AND TOM SMYTHE simplicity? A strong case for justifying the principle can be made if it can be shown that choosing the simplest hypothesis is conducive to finding truth and avoiding error. Perhaps the additional claims of more complex hypoth? eses are properly ruled out as otiose. Perhaps a well reasoned account of the epistemological role of simplicity also would explicate Wittgenstein's apt image, '... a wheel that can be turned though nothing else moves with it, is not part of the mechanism.' (1958 P95) It is the joint task of seeking truth and avoiding error that is important here : Note, for example, that argument to support consistency over inconsistency as a proper epistemological desi? deratum could not mark inconsistency for its lack of finding truth, for inconsistency admits all claims, so all true claims would be admitted by an epistemology that favored inconsistency over consistency; but, of course, all false claims would be admitted as well. Similarly, proper epistemological evaluation of simplicity cannot proceed simpliciter but must consider sim? plicity by contrast to more profligate alternatives in the interest of seeking truth and avoiding error. Perhaps outlines for an adequate justification of simplicity are already apparent, but Swinburne does not pursue argument along any of these or similar lines. The support that Swinburne seems to rely upon for his principle of simplicity is that it is a principle that scientists in fact use: When scientists choose between two or more hypotheses to explain some natural phenom? enon they always opt for the simplest one, everything else being equal. Here two questions come to mind. (1) Do scientists in fact always rely on this principle? And again, (2) What justifies using this principle of simplicity? Regarding (1) Swinburne furnishes no examples. But supposing scientists do rely as heavily on this principle as Swinburne suggests, it remains the case that such a widespread use of the principle requires some justification. Perhaps Swinburne requires no further support for the principle because he takes it that naturalistic philosophers are ostensible opponents of theism and that they use this principle in their philosophy of science, so it can be used against them in theology. In any event, let us suppose that this principle can be given adequate justification (as seems likely), and explore further prob? lems with Swinburne's arguments. Swinburne argues against Hume that given our ideas of patterns of order in the universe the simplest explanation for these is that the universe was created by one creator, rather than by the two or more that Hume suggested are closer to observed phenomena. Hume suggested that if theistic ideologi? cal forms of argument are taken to be cogent, then the hypothesis of several mortal creators of the world who have since passed away is more consistent with the observed evidence than is a single creator theistic hypothesis. Swinburne uses simplicity to respond to Hume on this point: It is simpler to postulate one creator rather than two or more.</page><page sequence="3">SIMPLICITY AND THEOLOGY 261 RECEIVED COMMENTARY In the literature on Swinburne's ideological argument, Mark Wynn (1993) has argued that an infinite designer hypothesis is simpler, but that a finite designer hypothesis is more likely because there is only one way to possess every power, or to know everything, but there is no limit to the number of ways in which an agent may fall short of this. Similarly, Wynn argues that in terms of power, a priori the more complex hypothesis is more likely (one or another finite designer), because there is only one way to have infinite power, but an innumerable number of ways of having finite power. Michael Martin (1990 pi43) argues that polytheism makes uniformity more likely than lack of uniformity. He says when several people work on furniture it is more uniform than it is when one cabinetmaker makes several pieces. Even when one skilled cabinetmaker makes cabinets on the same plan many times, the resulting cabinets are less likely to be uniform than if several skilled people do it. Thus there is no reason to expect more temporal uniformity with one God rather than many, but some reason vice versa. Somewhat more relevant to our concern with simplicity, Gary Doore (1980) has argued that Swinburne does not give the simplest kind of ex? planation because he multiplies the kinds of explanation of the universe beyond necessity. Consider the kind o? cause Swinburne postulates. It is a 'mind' that is infinite, eternal, unembodied, and must 'contain the reason for its existence within itself,' that is, it must be uncaused. Such an entity is of a radically different kind than any we have experienced. We don't need to postulate such a being to account for temporal order, and it is simpler not to do so because we would be refraining from multiplying kinds of expla? nation. Robert Pr?vost (1990, P33-55) argues that, though both Swinburne and Mackie (1982) use Bayesean analysis, they come to different conclusions because they use different evaluative criteria in applying Bayes' theorem, and Bayes' theorem alone cannot decide between competing hypotheses. According to Swinburne, theism has a high prior probability because of the criterion of simplicity : The God hypothesis is simpler because God is a simple kind of explanatory agent (something we examine below) ; because theism says that personal explanation is complete explanation ; and because theism postulates a good (complete) stopping-point for explanation in the choice of an agent. According to Mackie, theism is unacceptable due to its lack of fit with background knowledge, thus having a low prior probability. The result, Pr?vost concludes, is that Bayes' theorem gives each author different con? clusions on the basis of the prior probabilities employed. However, we suspect that a further conclusion also is warranted here. Attempting to establish prior probabilities on the basis of such claims about agency and personal expla? nation makes the resulting argument appear to be question begging and</page><page sequence="4">262 DON FAWKES AND TOM SMYTHE anthropomorphic, while fit with background knowledge is not subject to such criticism and is the usual source of prior probabilities in Bayesean analyses. Finally, Graham Priest (1981) addresses Swinburne's Bayesean ideologi? cal arguments by pointing out that Swinburne fails to take into account that 'brute facts' can serve as explanations, and hence that Swinburne's argu? ment inappropriately assigns a prior probability of 1 to the design hypothesis. Priest further argues that even when the prior probability of a ' brute fact ' hypothesis is taken into account, as it is taken by Schlesinger (1977), it is impossible to assign any supportable prior probability to either hypothesis ; this is so whether one uses a frequentist, or inductive subjectivist, or inductive non-subjectivist interpretation of probability theory. And, since theistic ideo? logical hypotheses (by contrast to (some) cosmological hypotheses) have no empirical consequences, we cannot depend on the fairly well known point that whatever prior probabilities are assigned, posterior (personal) probabilities consistent with the probability calculus converge to the same limit value as evidence comes in. (See, e.g., Earman &amp; Salmon 1992 P81-84.) So, Bayesean ideological arguments fail. (See Priest's careful, elegant discussion, P428-431.) Priest also notes that both Swinburne and Schlesinger do not distinguish adequately between the probability of certain evidence on altern? ative hypotheses, Pr(e|h1), Pr(e|h2)..., and the probability of alternative hypotheses on certain evidence, Pr(h1|e), Pr(h2|e)...; but these are not equivalent, and it is the latter sort of probabilities that are relevant to theistic ideological arguments, and (as the probability calculus shows) claims about the former are not sufficient to support claims about the latter. (Priest P426) But, if we do take proper account of the relations between these two sorts of probability, the just noted failure obtains. So, Bayeseanism cannot provide an adequate ground for a theistic ideological position (Priest P425-431). In addition to these compelling criticisms, we further examine simplicity as regards theistic ideological arguments, and then turn to more general problems with theistic arguments. TELEOLOGY AND SIMPLICITY There is an aspect of Swinburne's notion of simplicity that goes against his theistic position. There is a way in which his view is more complex than Hume's. Swinburne appeals to only one entity, but that entity is alleged to be infinitely complex. Swinburne's concept of God is one with infinite power, infinite knowledge and infinite goodness. Infinity is an attribute of the attributes of this concept of God. This God knows everything that it is logically possible to know, and the number of such items is claimed to be infinite (and likely would be at least indefinitely large).2 Such a God can do 2 Swinburne argues (1977) that an omniscient God would not know the future, by holding that statements about the future are neither true nor false. But even if this is right, such a God would know everything about the past and present, and there are an apparently infinite (or at least an indefinitely large) number of true propositions to know about the present and past.</page><page sequence="5">SIMPLICITY AND THEOLOGY 263 anything, consistent with his/her own nature, that it is logically possible to do, which Swinburne claims is infinite power (and surely would be at least the power to do or forbear an indefinitely large set of acts). Finally, this God is said to be perfectly good, having the attribute of goodness to an infinite extent. Thus this concept of God is that of the most complex being possible with respect to these attributes. But a much simpler hypothesis is to postulate, as Hume did, a mortal creator of the universe who was something of a bungler with just enough power and knowledge to create the evident uni? verse, and who has since died. Or again, Hume posits a few finite beings who created the universe and who are limited in their intelligence, power, and goodness. This is also a much simpler hypothesis with respect to the attributes of such beings. In addition, Hume's hypotheses have the advantage of avoiding the problem of evil ; suffering can be taken to be the result of an imperfect world created by imperfect beings. Perhaps the world was created by two Gods, one with a sense of humor, and one without. Simpler yet, perhaps the world was not created at all ; this too is equally consistent with the evidence and saves teleology from faltering on fallacy of composition. In any case, there is an adequate response to Swinburne's arguments employing his notion of simplicity. Elsewhere, Swinburne makes it evident that he thinks the attribution of infinity makes the conception of God simpler. He says 'It is always simpler to postulate infinite or zero degrees of some property than a certain finite value of it. ' (1983) We find this remark puzzling and take it as dubious in light of the foregoing discussion. Some Details Addressing some of Swinburne's specific points will give us a better view of the probative status of ideological arguments with suggestive consequences for other theistic arguments. Few Fundamental Particles and Laws. Swinburne says that (presumably ac? cording to current science) all bodies throughout the universe are composed of a relatively small class of fundamental particles. He says that this fact is evidence of the handiwork of an artisan creator. It is like having coins from the same mold or paintings with the same style. But suppose things were different. (Things may turn out to be quite different before the adventures of subatomic physicists come to an end.) Suppose basic particles of physics were like the elements of chemistry and there were many of them. Those who use design arguments often cite the great number of different species of animals as evidence of a prolific and artful designer. Suppose there were only a few species of animals on earth. Advocates of design arguments could then say that this is evidence of a creator on grounds similar to the 'few-particles' grounds. So it makes no difference whether a few fundamental particles or many, or few species or many are taken as evidence for design. Either way the facts equally can be taken to be 'evidence' of design. This indicates that</page><page sequence="6">264 DON FAWKES AND TOM SMYTHE it does not matter whether the world is complex, or its elements few or many ; it will still 'show design' on such grounds. Since it does not matter how the facts come out, the existence of a few fundamental particles of physics is no more evidence for a creator than any other possible state of affairs. Another point Swinburne makes is that (again, presumably according to current science) there are only a few laws of nature governing physical bodies, such as the law of gravitation. (Detailed exploration of current science might lead to questions about this claim, but let that pass for now.) Swinburne says that if there were more than one creator we would expect to find the law of gravity operative in one part of the universe and some other law operative somewhere else. But suppose that gravity operated differently or not at all at different locales and that there were no underlying regularity. Or suppose there were no universal laws of physics. Why would such states of affairs be evidence that there were many designers and not one? Wouldn't such complexity of the universe be just as consistent with one omnipotent and omniscient creator? A single such creator might simply express infinite (or an indefinitely large number of) possibilities in the universe. The hy? potheses of one or of many creators or of none are equally consistent with such evidence, and equally consistent with few or many laws as well. Another relevant point is that there is evidence of great diversity in the universe. Take our solar system as a fairly minor example. Each planet is vastly different from each of the rest. On the facts one can speculate that each planet and the sun were created by distinct deities who agreed to use the same laws of nature as though they were rules of a game. We find both apparent simplicity and uniformity in the universe in some respects, and apparently great diversity and multiplicity in other respects. The tremendous multiplicity of individuals stands over against the apparently relatively few laws of nature. But if there were many different laws and just a few indi? viduals it would make no difference for a design argument. The alleged evidence of design would still be there on the lights of such arguments. So the fact that our universe is the way it is constitutes no more evidence for design than many other possible universes. Perhaps these points help to make more evident Priest's (1981 P84) claim that theistic ideological hypotheses (by contrast to hypotheses in scientific cosmology, see e.g. Weinberg 1977, Hawk? ing 1988) have no empirical consequences; by being compatible with many contrary states of affairs they imply no particular states of affairs. All alleged 'designs' equally call for explanation, or are simply explained as the func? tional, relational, and descriptive facts of nature. Cosmological Argument. These last points bring out the dependence of design arguments on theistic cosmological argument, a feature which Swinburne acknowledges. But, Swinburne's ratiocinations notwithstanding, there are well known defects of theistic cosmological arguments, so this dependence is hardly helpful to a theistic position. One sort of difficulty for any theistic</page><page sequence="7">SIMPLICITY AND THEOLOGY 265 cosmological argument is raised simply by applying the cosmological ques? tion to the deity posited at the end of any such alleged proof: What caused the posited deity? Explanations do come to an end, but if one insists that they come to an end with some deity and that the cosmological question cannot be answered regarding the posited deity, then the proper response (beside suspecting anthropomorphism) is to ask for the grounds for such an insistence. One has proper grounds for bringing explanation to an end with the evident facts of nature because those facts are evident; and no insistence on stopping is required because there is still room for further open questions and for wonder as well. But questions and wonder are not arguments, nor are they grounds for the positing of any being, nor is consistency evidence; even less is consistency explanation. Similar remarks apply as well to theistic ideological arguments (What designed the designer?) and particularly to those that employ relational or functional facts of nature, such as spatio temporal order, to which we now turn. Spatio-Temporal Order. Swinburne suggests a spatio-temporal order form of argument from design. This form is based upon the fact that the world exhibits a tremendous amount of regularity to us. One leaves one's abode for work every day traveling along the same roads, and when one returns one's house is still there and everything is the way one left it. Physical objects exhibit spatio-temporal continuity. The world doesn't have to be this way. We can imagine experiencing a much more chaotic world in which physical objects disappear and reappear at irregular intervals; where laws of nature are operative at one time or place, and inoperative at another time or place. In such a world there would be no regularities, we could make no reliable predictions, and we could not readily learn from experience. Swinburne uses the existence of such regularities in dealing with the problem of evil. Once we learn some regularities in the world we can avoid some suffering and injury. A child who burns a hand on a stove can learn not to touch a hot stove and hence can avoid perhaps even greater physical injury. Of course, a knowing, powerful and benevolent deity might have found a more gentle way for a child to learn about hot stoves and one wonders what a child learns from the pain of childhood leukemia, but we can leave aside the further problems this theodicy faces and consider instead whether the existence of spatio-temporal order provides evidence for the existence of an omniscient, omnibenevolent, omnipotent God. It is a familiar point that the presence of regularities and order in the world is not evidence for the existence of a being with those attributes. The presence of order and regu? larity in the world are just as consistent with a finite God who is limited in power, knowledge, and goodness; and simpler yet (and closer to the evi? dence), explanation can come to an end with description of the evident facts of nature. Simplicity and Consistency. To see that Swinburne does not consistently apply</page><page sequence="8">266 DON FAWKES AND TOM SMYTHE his principle of simplicity to his own concept of God, consider the attribute of omniscience. The sort of complexity involved here can be shown by considering the following kind of example. Person A and person B have at least n items of knowledge in their store of beliefs. But A knows more things than B knows. We can say that A knows n + s things or has more items of knowledge in her store of beliefs than does B. It follows that A is more complex cognitively than is B. A is more complex cognitively because she has a greater number of items of knowledge. Now if a being is attributed an infinite (or indefinitely large) number of items of knowledge3 and another being is attributed a finite (or less than indefinitely large) number of items of knowledge, the being attributed with more items of knowledge is more complex cognitively. In fact, many theists (including Swinburne) hold that their concept of God is one that is as cognitively complex as it is logically possible to be. Applying Swinburne's principle of simplicity to the concept of a creator of the universe and its laws, we can note that it would take some finite number of items of knowledge to create the universe rather than an infinite number.4 It follows that Swinburne's argument does not consistently apply his concept of simplicity because, if it did, it would posit not an omniscient creator, but instead a creator that is less than omniscient. Similar considerations apply to divine attributes like omnipotence and omni benevolence, not to mention such attributes as omnipresence. Evident Facts of Nature The discussion above of natural order and of ideological and cosmological arguments brings to mind a story that Richard Feynman often retold about his father: He had taught me to notice things and one day ... I was playing with a... wagon .... It had a ball in it... and I pulled the wagon and I noticed something about the way the ball moved. So I went to my father and I said, 'Say Pop, I noticed something. When I pull the wagon the ball rolls to the back of the wagon... and when I'm pulling along and suddenly stop, the ball rolls to the front of the wagon. ' And I said, 'Why is that?' And he said, 'That, nobody knows. The general idea is that things that are moving try to keep on moving, and things that are standing still tend to stand still unless you push on them.... And this tendency is called inertia, but nobody knows why it's true. '-Now that's a deep understanding. He doesn't give me a name. He knew the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something. 3 William Alston (1983) has argued that an omniscient God would not have beliefs. Instead, on one construal, such a God would be immediately and infallibly aware of the objects known. Alston argues that an omniscient God's knowledge is of the intuitive kind rather than of the true belief + other condition(s) variety. However, this does not alter the fact that such a God knows everything it is logically possible to know. Such a God is still immediately aware of everything knowable to any cognitively endowed being. Such a God still has an apparently infinite (or at least indefinitely large) store of items of knowledge. 4 This is compatible with the point noted above that there are an apparently infinite (or at least indefinitely large) number of true propositions to know about the present and past. As an analogy, the inventors of chess needed only a finite number of true beliefs to create what is now such an apparently infinite (or at least indefinitely large) class of true propositions regarding past and present games of chess.</page><page sequence="9">SIMPLICITY AND THEOLOGY 267 He went on to say, that if you look close, you'll find that the ball does not rush to the back of the wagon, but it's the back of the wagon that you're pulling towards/against the ball, that the ball stands still or as a matter of fact from the friction starts to move forward really, and doesn't move back. So, I ran back to the wagon and set the ball up again and pulled the wagon... and looking sideways and seeing indeed he was right, the ball never moved back? wards... when I pulled the wagon forward. It moved backward relative to the wagon, but relative to the sidewalk it moved forward a little bit. It's just that the wagon caught up with it.5 Now the point of this little story which is relevant here is how explanation comes to an end with evident facts of nature, and yet with questions still remaining and indeed with some measure of wonder. As a matter of fact, Steven Weinberg's 1977 and 1980 chronicle the considerable progress that has been made toward answering Feynman's childhood question, 'Why is that?' But let the reader rest assured that Weinberg posits no beings, and that he does not overreach the evidence. It is the beginning of wisdom to say something like, 'That, nobody knows.' Positing beings beyond evidence is an end to wisdom, not a beginning of it. In reading the works of a Feynman (e.g. 1985) or of a Weinberg one can not help but notice the great care taken to attempt to disprove hypotheses. The fact that the logic of confirmation of hypotheses takes the form of the fallacy of affirming the consequent and that disconfirmation takes the valid form modus tollens, makes disconfirmation especially valuable in the search for truth and avoidance of error. Consist? ency with evidence is not enough. Confirmation is not enough. Every con? firmed hypothesis must be confronted with the most rigorous scrutiny for consistent alternatives and for possibilities of error, and the most ingenious efforts are applied to find ways to disconfirm or undermine the most cher? ished hypotheses. But such efforts are entirely absent in theistic arguments and this lacuna is among their most serious deficiencies. Conclusion Hume's criticisms of theistic arguments stand well against Swinburne's defense of theism. The principle of simplicity used by Swinburne requires justification and, when justified, works against theism. There are adequate counters to the features of Swinburne's arguments that depend upon there being few fundamental particles of basic physics, universal laws of nature, cogent cosmological argument, and temporal order in the universe. More? over, Swinburne does not appear to address the point that if theistic ideo? logical forms of argument are taken to be reliable ways of seeking truth and avoiding error, then some sort of nonomniscient, nonomnibenevolent, and/or nonomnipotent deity or deities are more consistent with the evidence 5 Feynman told this story in an interview for the PBS television show, NO VA first broadcast by PBS in the U.S. on 25 January 1983. The episode is titled, 'The Pleasure of Finding Things Out, An Interview With Richard Feynman.' See also Gleick (1992 P28-29).</page><page sequence="10">268 DON FAWKES AND TOM SMYTHE than are any of the 'omni' varieties. But it is this very antecedent that Hume's posthumous writings in theology (and the remarks of this brief paper as well) suggest to be faulty. Forms of argument that serve (many) contrary conclusions support none. Hume's challenges to the above antecedent work equally well against some of Swinburne's critics. Take Martin's (1990) cabinetmaker argument noted above. One can almost hear Hume ask, 'And what warrants the application of our experiences with cabine tmaking to the "making" of a universe? And what reasoning leads us to suppose that our universe is "made" at all?' Similar problems to those noted here affect other traditional alleged proofs as Hume, Flew, Scriven, Hanson, and others have shown and as the reader may readily verify. One begins to see the malleability, the profligacy, the positing of beings well beyond any evidence, the anthropomorphism, the treatment of consistency as if it were evidence or explanation, the selective and inconsistent use of principles, and the lack of any serious attempt to disprove hypotheses characteristic of theistic proofs. More recent theists claim to give arguments, but these arguments are just the old proofs in altered language, and alas, it is not surprising that there never seems to be a shortage of audiences or funding for those who wish to give the appearance of reason to that which many people wish to believe. But appearances of reason are only a facade anyway, for faced with a choice between reason and theism such persons almost always choose theism, as the long traditions of fideistic, revelationist, charismatic, fundamentalist, and mystic theisms attest. The words of Einstein with which this essay began are presented by Gleick in the following context. Theology, philosophy, and physics had not yet become so distinct from one another, and scientists found it natural to ask what sort of universe God would make. Even in the quantum era the question had not fully disappeared from the scientific consciousness. Einstein did not hesitate to invoke His name. Yet when Einstein doubted that God played dice with the world, or when he uttered phrases like the one later inscribed in the stone of Fine Hall at Princeton, ' The Lord God is subtle, but malicious he is not, ' the great man was playing a delicate game with language. He had found a formulation easily understood and imitated by physicists, religious or not. He could express convictions about how the universe ought to be designed without giving offense either to the most literal believers in God or to his most disbelieving professional colleagues, who were happy to read God as a poetic shorthand for whatever laws or principles rule this flux of matter and energy we happen to inhabit. Einstein's piety was sincere but neutral, acceptable even to the vehemently antireligious Dirac, of whom Wolfgang Pauli once complained, ' Our friend Dirac, too, has a religion, and its guiding principle is "There is no God and Dirac is His prophet.5" (Gleick 1992 P58) There may be a wise, ancient, and personal deity. Perhaps ancient Athena exists. Perhaps a thundering commander or compassionate redeemer like those set forth in many cultures exists. Perhaps a grand cosmic prayer granter</page><page sequence="11">SIMPLICITY AND THEOLOGY 269 exists. Perhaps too, a tooth fairy exists. But it remains the case that there is simply no good reason to conclude that any such beings exist. If one's interests are in seeking truth and avoiding error, then one wisely avoids such defects as those characteristic of theistic arguments. But one also remembers that a wise and prudent person must play a delicate game with language and, recognizing the risks, must avoid giving offense to the interest of seeking truth and avoiding error. But yet also, in the closing years of the twentieth century with the rising political, economic, and military power of theistic ideologies, one remembers as well Russell's words from earlier in this century, ' The opinions that are held with passion are always those for which no good ground exists; indeed the passion is the measure of the holder's lack of rational conviction' (1928 pi 3), and one wonders if prudence can yet stand with wisdom. An Allegory The divide between atheism and theism appears wide. The present writers represent this division, one on each side. We wish to close with the following dreamlike fiction. It seems a truly great philosopher (who we'll call Bertrand) dies and, to his astonishment, goes to heaven. Before meeting God, Bertrand is concerned that some of what he has written and said might be viewed as too dismissive of theism. But he reflects that he had presented honestly his arguments and, after all, here he is in heaven. Nevertheless, he feels a bit apprehensive. Losing himself in rumination he muses vaguely once more over the question, Are people but the dreams of Gods or are Gods but the dreams of people or.... Finally, God appears. 'God?', says Bertrand. 'Indeed', comes the reply. 4Why an atheist?', says God. 'Not enough evidence', says Bertrand. 'Not quite right', says God, 'No evidence in favor and some evidence against.' Bertrand seems to awake.
