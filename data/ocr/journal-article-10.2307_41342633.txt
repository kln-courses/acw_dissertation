By Fredric Jameson. London: Verso, 2009. Pp. 624. "Always historicize!"1 ABSTRACT This review essay attempts to understand the book under review against the background of Jameson's previous writings. Failing to do so would invite misunderstanding since there are few contemporary theorists whose writing forms so much of a unity. Jameson's book can be divided into three parts. The first and most important part deals with dialectics, the second with politics, and the third with philosophy of history. In the first part Jameson argues that dialectics best captures our relationship to the sociocultural and historical world we are living in. The second part makes clear that Jameson is not prepared to water down his own Marxist politics in order to spare the liberal sensibilities of his political opponents. In the third part Jameson develops his own philosophy of history, mainly in a dialogue with Ricoeur. Dialectics is his main weapon in his discussion with Ricoeur, and it becomes clear that the Spinozism of dialectics allows for a better understanding of history and of historical writing than does Ricoeur' s phenomenological approach. The book is an impressive testimony to the powers of dialectical thought and to its indispensability for a proper grasp of historical writing. Keywords: Fredric Jameson, Paul Ricoeur, Martin Heidegger, Jacques Derrida, Hegelian- ism, Marxism, dialectics, philosophy of history I. INTRODUCTION Jameson was born in 1934 in Cleveland, Ohio. He studied French and German at Haverford College in the early 1950s and at several universities in France and Germany from 1954 to 1957. He took his MA at Yale where he studied under the supervision of Erich Auerbach. His PhD thesis on Sartre was published in 1961 as Sartre: the Origins of a Style. In his thesis, Jameson used Sartre's work to reflect on the relationship between form and content- a theme that would occupy him throughout his intellectual career.2 Politics is absent from the book, even though it was so very prominently present in Sartre's own oeuvre. Jameson's interest in politics- and Marxism- only came with Marxism and Form (1971).3 1.

Jameson believed Marxism to be the best remedy for the shortcomings of Anglo-American (political) philosophy, but here too, this is above all a matter of style. For, as Jameson argues, the style of Anglo-American (political) philosophy necessarily blinds it to society's main problems, and it is, therefore, sui generis conservative: "the method of such thinking, in its various forms and guises, con- sists in separating reality into airtight components, carefully distinguishing the political from the economic, the legal from the political, the sociological from the historical, so that the fiill implications of any given problem can never come into view " (my italics).6 Obviously, this argument comes close to the familiar neo-Marxist argument against liberal political philosophy as being the victim of a "halbierter Vernunft" (halved Reason) because Reason is used solely for thinking about what the best means are for achieving certain goals, whereas these social and political goals themselves are believed to be beyond the scope of rational argument. These goals always concern the whole of the sociopolitical order, and each attempt to conceptualize this order would inevitably result, according to these liberal politi- cal philosophers, in idle, metaphysical speculation. Neo-Marxists see this as a sure sign of the intellectual bankruptcy of liberal political reason. In what kind of political order are we living if we are forbidden to conceptualize it as a whole ? And why should reason be incapable of meaningfully discussing the pros and cons of the political order as a whole? They agree, therefore, with Hegel's "das Wahre ist das Ganze" (the truth is the whole) and, hence, that we can get to the basic truths about our political order only on the condition that we do not hesitate to make use of the notion of that order's "totality."7 This is surely one of the more powerful (dialectical) arguments against liberal political philosophy, and it need not be surprising, therefore, that Jameson was never willing to abandon this idea of the social "whole" or of its "totality." Even though Louis Althusser (one of Jameson's main Marxist heroes) repeated over and over again that twentieth-century totalitarianism had discredited forever the notion of totality, Jameson remained convinced that surrendering the notion 4. The issue returns in the book under review. See 22ff. 5. The book has been described as "the Ur-text for the renaissance of Marxist criticism in the US academy throughout the 1970s." See Sean Homer, Fredric Jameson: Marxism, Hermeneutics, Post- modernism (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1998), 13. 6. Quoted in ibid., 15. 7. As Frederick Beiser argues, the notion of the whole or totality is an indispensable component of dialectics. The main idea is that, in dialectics, we cannot move on from "no single thing is both F and not-F at the same time" to "Reality as a whole cannot be both F and not-F at the same time." From this tension all dialectics arises. And, obviously, all this is possible only on the condition that we can make use of the notion of "Reality as a whole." See Frederic C. Beiser, Hegel (New York and London: Routledge, 2005), 162.</page><page sequence="3">86 FRANK ANKERSMIT would amount to the emasculation of all of political philosophy.8 Here we can only agree with Jameson.9 For it is a non sequitur that thinking the totality neces- sarily invites political totalitarianism. It is rather the other way around: responsi- ble political thought about the totality of our social-political order will arm us all the better against any future attempts to use it for totalitarian purposes, whereas removing it from our political vocabulary will blind us to any such threats. Jameson's Late Marxism: Adorno, or , the Persistence of the Dialectic of 1990 can be seen as a continuation of his Marxism and Form.10 Adorno' s "negative dialectics" is presented here as the main and most successful instrument against the workings of liberal reification- best understood as a "freezing" of the dialec- tics of history in an everlasting present11- and of commodification. Commodi- fication results from seeing in money the instrument for making everything- products, labor, services, science, art, culture, and so on- commensurable with everything else. If everything is commensurable with everything else, nothing really new can ever come into being. For newness is by definition incommensu- rable with what exists. So commodification has a natural affinity with reification and vice versa. Both "freeze" time, put dialectics to a standstill, and result in what Marcuse characterized as "one-dimensional man" (see note 11). By its refusal to think the whole, Anglo-American philosophy is, in fact, the ideology of a society taking reification and commodification as its two secular gods. This, then, is why we need the crowbar of dialectics if we wish to be able to think the past and the future again. As if to redress an overemphasis on matters of form and style, Jameson had previously criticized formalism's tendency to cut completely through the ties between form and content in his The Prison-house of Language: A Critical Account of Structuralism and Russian Formalism of 1972. 12 In this work, Jame- son insists that the interest in form, however recommendable it may be as such, should never allow us to abandon contextualization. We should never forget 8. For an account of Jameson's discussion with Althusser about the idea of totality, see Adam Charles Roberts, Fredric Jameson (London and New York: Routledge, 2000), 15-20, and Homer, Fredric Jameson , 60-62. One more contemporary critic of the notion of totality is Jean-François Lyotard, whom Jameson quotes: "let us wage war on totality" (Jameson, Valences , 210). 9. Jameson also appeals to the vintage Marxist argument linking the notion of "totality" to praxis (see Jameson, Valences , 10, 50ff.; see also Homer, Fredric Jameson , 94ff.). The nature of existing sociopolitical reality (its "totality") will reveal itself to us only when we try to change it ("praxis")- just as the nature of marble will reveal itself to the sculptor only when he or she makes a sculpture out of it. Inversely, without a notion of "totality," praxis is aimless. The argument makes sense, though, admittedly, in Jameson's case it is hard to see what this appeal to practice comes down to "in practice." 10. Fredric Jameson, Late Marxism: Adorno, or, the Persistence of the Dialectic (London: Verso, 1990). 11. This, of course, was the main thesis in Herbert Marcuse' s immensely successful and influ- ential, One -Dimensional Man (Boston: Beacon Press, 1964). Jameson rarely refers to Marcuse, however, probably because whereas Marcuse' s analysis of desire (as in his Eros and Civilization ) is still basically Freudian, Jameson prefers an approach à la Lacan and/or Deleuze. For Freud, desire is still an irrational, ahistorical given, whereas Lacan and Deleuze historicize it (and pleasure). As Jameson famously urged: "always historicize!" (these are the two triumphant first words of The Political Unconscious). 12.

This book defines Jameson's position with regard to the structuralism of Lévi-Strauss, Jakobson, and Barthes13 and can best be summarized in terms of the difference between dialectics and structuralist thought. Both see the world, or the text, in terms of oppositions. But whereas structuralism "freezes" opposition in terms of a system of ahistorical, binary oppositions, dialectics carefully avoids any such fixation- just think of the dialectical triad of negation, persistence, and "Aufhe- bung." Structuralism is a truncated dialectics. In the late 1980s and 1990s Jameson's thought moved in new directions. Before then the products of "high culture" were the self-evident subject matter of his writings. But now film, video, the visual arts, and architecture are also eagerly explored for their cultural and (hidden) political meanings. This is what was at stake in Signatures of the Visible (1990) and in The Geopolitical Aesthetic: Cinema and Space in the World System (1992).14 At the same time the theme of utopianism- already addressed in the two volumes of The Ideologies of Theory essays (1988)15- became ever more prominent. This resulted in The Seeds of Time (1994) and Archaeologies of the Future : The Desire Called Utopia and Other Science Fictions (2005), where Jameson presented Utopian models of the future by employing Marxist speculations on the classless society and science fiction as well.16 This combination of all-encompassing analyses of contemporary art and culture, both high and low, with the political agenda of utopianism established Jameson's reputation as a "cultural critic." Indeed, in both the blurb on the book under review here and on The Modernist Papers of 2007, 17 Colin MacCabe char- acterizes Fredric Jameson as "probably the most important cultural critic writing in English today."18 If one peruses the many things that have recently been said and written about Jameson, there seems to be near unanimous agreement that he should be seen primarily as a "cultural critic." This is why Jameson is now often heralded as one of our greatest contemporary sages, as our present counterpart to the Carlyles, Baudelaires, Nietzsches, Arnolds, Benjamins, Eliots, and Trillings of a remoter and more recent past, by such highly important and influential authors as Terry Eagleton, Dominick LaCapra, and Hayden White. Jameson has become one of the greatest names in the reflection on contemporary culture, if not the greatest. 13.

MAIN THEMES However successful the books I have mentioned may have been, Jameson is best known for two others: The Political Unconscious : Narrative as a Socially Symbolic Act , in which he develops his own brand of Marxist hermeneutics, and Postmodernism , or , the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism, which offers a Marxist interpretation of postmodernism. As will be clear by now, Jameson is a dialecti- cal thinker. In order to recognize what this must mean for his hermeneutics we should recall, above all, that dialectics is basically monist and therefore is pecu- liar among all Western philosophies since Descartes and Kant in that it leaves no room for the subject/object split or any variants of it. The Hegelian dialectic inherited this from Spinoza's doctrine of the One Substance, comprising within itself both subject and object.19 Dialectics is thus best seen as the historicization of Spinozist monist rationalism. As Homer shows, three consequences follow from this. First, instead of accept- ing the well-known epistemological relationship between historian or reader on the one hand, and some isolated cultural artifact we have inherited from the past, on the other, as his framework, the dialectician will prefer to see the interpreta- tion of the past, or of the text, as the process of a continuous mediation between past and present and in which both participate ex aequo?0 In dialectics there are no insurmountable epistemological gaps or fixed hierarchies between subject and object- this is, again, Spinoza's legacy to dialectics. Interpretation then becomes an allegory of the confrontation between two social forms, namely, past and pre- sent. Second, because of this, in all interpretation the past remains an active agent in its own right, so to speak. This is the paradox of dialectics: precisely by pulling the past "closer" to us- by doing away with the epistemological barrier between subject and object- we grant to it a power and presence for which epistemology leaves no room at all. Third, because dialectics comprises the past, the present, and the future, the future must also be incorporated in all this. Or, as Jameson puts it himself, we must allow for: "the sense of a hermeneutic relationship to the past which is able to grasp its own present history only on condition it manages to keep the idea of the future, and of radical and Utopian transformation alive."21 This, then, gives us the Utopian impulse in Jameson's thought. 19. See Beiser, Hegel, 61-65 and Beiser's quote on 46-47 from Hegel himself in his writings on the history of philosophy: "when one begins to philosophize one must be first a Spinozist. The soul must bathe itself in the aether of the single substance, in which everything one has held dear is submerged." See also Charles Taylor, Hegel (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1977), 99, 227. 20. As White insists, this has implications for how to conceive of ideology. Ideology cannot be framed within the reassuring, epistemological "science/truth" opposition: "ideology is not, for Jame- son, a lie, a deception, or a distortion of a perceivable reality but rather an attempt to come to terms with and to transcend the unbearable relationships of social life." See Hayden White, "Jameson's Redemption of Narrative," in idem , The Content of the Form (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1987), 154. 21 . Homer, Fredric Jameson , 42.</page><page sequence="6">THE DIALECTICS OF JAMESON'S DIALECTICS 89 Next, the question arises how to operationalize or conceptualize this dialec- tical "mediation" between historical reality in its subjectivist and objectivist manifestations. This is where Lacan comes in. For the Lacanian Real is exactly the same middle between objectified and subjectified reality that reality is within dialectical thought. So Jameson now posits a parallel between the Lacanian triad of 1) imagination, 2) the symbolic order, and 3) the Real and the hermeneutic triad of 1) the text, 2) society, and 3) history. It follows from this schema that history should be equated to the Lacanian Real; this can properly be said to be our political unconscious since, just like the unconscious, history is always present but nevertheless successfully resists ever being fully captured. As Homer puts it: "history is repressed in cultural texts and operates as a textual unconscious."22 This has, in its turn, consequences for how to think about narrative. For what is more natural than to tie dialectics and narrative firmly together? Is dialectics, in the end, not the narrative of the self-unfolding of spirit ("Geist") where we must never fall into the trap of seeing the intrinsically dialectical process of narrativiza- tion as solely a thing of the mind? For dialectics typically shuttles between what in the Cartesian, epistemological tradition is called mind and reality. It follows that narrative is just as much a thing of the mind as it is of reality: again, it medi- ates between the past itself and historical thought.23 Or, as epistemologists using their bizarre vocabulary would be compelled to characterize this state of affairs: narrative is both in the past itself and a category of the human mind. In this way the notion of narrative can be said to be a symbolization of what our hermeneuti- cal understanding of the past (and of the text) gives us access to. So the book's title- The Political Unconscious : Narrative as a Socially Symbolic Act- is most appropriate. In fact, it is the shortest possible summary of the book. Finally, Jameson illustrates his Marxist hermeneutics with an elaborate discussion of three novelists- Balzac, Gissing, and Conrad. No theory without examples! Taking into account all of this, one can only be deeply impressed by Jameson's success in weaving together all this within one coherent whole. This book truly is a tour de force. The Political Unconscious is probably Jameson's most difficult book. The book on postmodernism is far more accessible. It grew out of a much-discussed essay on postmodernism in the New Left Review of 1984 that is included in the book. As behooves a Marxist, Jameson relates the emergence of postmodernism to changes in the economy. He was one of the first to see how the victory of the ideology of the market, of neoliberalism, of Milton Friedman's radicalism, of the dismantling of the welfare state by Reagan and Thatcher resulted in an eco- nomic system that is basically different from the one we had. As early as 1991 he observed the Left's helplessness with regard to neoliberalism: "the surrender to 22. Ibid., 55; see also Roberts, Fredric Jameson , 61-68. 23. When discussing narrative, Homer agrees with Roy Bhaskar's criticism that Jameson is guilty of the "epistemic fallacy" and fails to give a convincing argument in favor of an independently exist- ing historical reality. See Homer, Fredric Jameson , 65ff. But the attempt to give such an argument would automatically require abandoning dialectics, and this one cannot reasonably demand of some- one who, like Jameson, openly embraces it.</page><page sequence="7">90 FRANK ANKERSMIT the various forms of market ideology- on the left , I mean, not to mention every- body else- has been imperceptible but alarmingly universal."24 The neoliberal market ideology is, above all, the regression to a pre- or ahis- torical truth about human society where, paradoxically, it intersects with Marxist thought. Jameson appeals here to Gary Becker's claim that the market economy is the most basic economic model one can think of and one whose perfect exem- plification already exists in the prehistorical household model.25 Indeed, this agrees with the old Marxist claim that economics is at the root of all of human society: it was there already when the take-off from the household model had not yet taken place. This is what neoliberalism and Marxism have in common. But as Jameson provocatively continues: "I will argue the proposition that we [that is, Marxists] have much in common with the neoliberals, in fact virtually eve- rything-save the essentials!"26 And the essentials concern how to interpret this regression. For the neoliberals this regression is a Rousseauean return to human nature, to whom and what we basically are and that we so sadly lost sight of with history (mainly thanks to all kinds of collective arrangements that we had, stupidly, handed over to the state). Hence, their Rousseauean rejoicing about this albeit belated rediscovery of our true social and economic selves. For Marxists (and the more enlightened liberals), however, this can only be half of the truth. For the mistake of the neoliberals is to confuse the rediscovery of our economic nature with the market model. And, as the Marxists go on to argue, identifying economics with the market model is to deny that econom- ics has a history of its own. It's an attempt to abolish history and to return to the state of nature. But economics has, needs, and will have its history, no less than anything else in the condition humaine. Neoliberalism is, therefore, an attempt to stop history in the name of the reification of the ahistorical nature of interhuman economic relationships. It is this attempt to close down history that has resounded through all of Western culture and from which postmodernism emerged. Postmodernism is what you get when you try to stop history and live in an eternal present- which is a resurrection of our Rousseauean natural past- and will result in the triumph of what Hegel called "schlechte Unendlichkeit" (bad infinity), excluding any qualitative change for the future. Where we are now, we will remain forever. The book on postmodernism is, mainly, an effort to detail what this must mean to our contemporary culture and to our (postmodern) societies. Jameson's primary focus is on the exchange of "time" for "space," where these two notions 24. Fredric Jameson, Postmodernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism, (Durham, NC, and London: Duke University Press, 1991), 263. 25. Obviously, Becker's argument cannot fail to remind us of Hannah Arendt's claim in her book on revolution that the word "economy" derives from the Greek word "oikos." Hence, economy has its origins in the private domain of the household and is, therefore, right from the beginning an unsuitable model for a politics serving the public interest. Jameson also briefly mentions her relevant ideas (see 353). A no less fierce denunciator of economy as a model for politics was, of course, Carl Schmitt in his Der Begriff des Politischen of 1932. But, as a Marxist, Jameson would disagree with both Arendt and Schmitt: for him politics is and ought to be subservient to economy (297). This raises the interest- ing question as to whether Marxism leaves any room for the notion of the public interest as different from the sum of all private interests. 26. Jameson, Postmodernism , 265.</page><page sequence="8">THE DIALECTICS OF JAMESON'S DIALECTICS 9 1 should be understood primarily in a metaphorical sense. Time is suggestive of change, and we can only properly appreciate it if we keep in mind the different phases of the process of change: of what a thing was (and is now no longer), of what it is now, and of what it may become in the future. This gives to the world a (temporal) depth comprising a tangible and real present apart from a past that we can only remember. That is time's chiaroscuro. Space (and we must think here of two-dimensional space), however, lacks such depth and offers us only a surface. Time is metaphorical or synecdochical; space is metonymical. Time focuses on identity and space on difference. In the time-model meanings are organized as sets of internal relationships; in the space-model we have only external relation- ships so that meanings become like items on a map that are only externally (that is, spatially) related to each other. Hence moving from the time- to the space- model, from modernism to postmodernism, involves a loss of meaning and of meaning's capacity to organize the world for us; it is therefore no less ominously than correctly described as a "breakdown in the signifying chain."27 Almost everything that we have learned since Jameson to associate with postmodernism can be derived from this shift from "time" to "space"; think of Lyotard' s thesis of the exchange of metanarratives comprising all of the past for postmodernist so-called "little" narratives that never exceed the horizon of the present. Hence, the loss of historicity in postmodernism. Hence, the exchange of modernist "paranoia" for postmodernist "schizophrenia" (Deleuze), that is, the shift from weaving the web of meanings as closely together as possible, to unraveling that web into separate threads of meaning. Hence, the predominance of science over history. Hence, "the waning of affect," since what "affects" us will affect now at best just a few of these individual threads of meaning but no longer "the web of meaning" as a whole. Hence, the exchange of parody for pastiche- which is, in fact, parody robbed of its meaning. Hence, postmodernist architecture's playfully combining classical or baroque architectural rhetoric with that of modernism- for these styles of the past have now lost their original mean- ing and therewith their innate resistance to "quotation" in postmodernist architec- ture. Hence, postmodernism' s ne plus ultra of the very dissolution of the category of meaning itself, as exemplified by Baudrillard' s theory of the simulacrum. So the resurrection of an economic state of nature in our modern world, which is advocated by neoliberalism to the present day, has had the most momentous consequences. All the more may one be surprised by Jameson's relatively posi- tive appraisal of postmodern architecture, art, and culture.28 Then again, perhaps we should we see his recent monumental book on literary modernism29- dealing with Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Mallarmé, Kafka, Joyce, Proust and others- as a, for him, welcome warm bath in the work of authors whose superiority to postmodern authors he has never really doubted. Moreover, does Jameson not observe in A 27. In the book under review Jameson adds to the analysis of space and time, as given in the book on postmodernism, by explaining how they can be related to each other dialectically. See 66-70. 28. "[A] s far as taste is concerned (and as readers of the preceding chapters will have become aware), culturally I write as a relatively enthusiastic consumer of postmodernism."

Jameson, The Modernist Papers.</page><page sequence="9">92 FRANK ANKERSMIT Singular Modernity a revival of the concept of modernity- apparently with his approval?30 So it seems. Commenting on Jameson's intellectual achievement, Homer observes: [I]n the last thirty years he has produced a hody of work that combines a formidable degree of philosophical breadth, political integrity and intellectual rigour. His great philosophi- cal-literary models remain Sartre, Lukàcs and Adorno, but he is equally at home engaging with figures such as Lacan, Derrida and Baudrillard. Moreover, he presents an astonishing range of cultural analysis from "high" literature to science fiction, from popular music, film and video to painting, sculpture and architecture. Jameson will slip from a discussion of Heidegger to pop art and Hollywood film with an ease that is at once breathtaking and unsettling.31 One can only agree: It is hard to conceive of a contemporary thinker with greater erudition, a better grasp of the profoundest philosophical and literary theories,32 or a more original and penetrating insight into the peculiarities of our contempo- rary postmodern world than Fredric Jameson. His work testifies to a wealth of learning and a scope of interest that are unparalleled by any other contemporary scholar. He seems to have read just about everything and to have a more secure grasp on all of it than anybody else. His reputation and standing in the academic world are in agreement with this. In 2008 he received the Danish Holberg Prize- a kind of Nobel Prize for the humanities. But this should not make us forget that this so very impressive oeuvre is not without its weaknesses, too. There is, in the first place, the "infamous Jameso- nian" style (Douglas Kellner33), which, unfortunately, has proved to be a fatal stumbling block for many readers wishing to orient themselves in Jameson's writings (and so it was with me for quite some time). His books belong to the most difficult and demanding texts written by contemporary theorists. This is not merely a matter of basically clear thoughts being unclearly expressed (think of Kant's or Donald Davidson's style of writing), but rather the more dramatic variant of unclear thoughts that are expressed unclearly. When this occurs, read- ing inevitably becomes guesswork. Though in all fairness it should be added right away that there is an immense difference between the tortuous and indeed impenetrable prose of, say, the first chapters of The Political Unconscious and the urbane, relaxed, and easygoing style of, for example, the one-hundred-page-long conclusion to the postmodernism book. Jameson is aware of the problem. He recalls that after the publication of The Prison-house of Language he received two sets of letters: one praising him for defending structuralism and one for attacking it.34 Most authors would be worried by such a contradictory reception of their work and conclude that they should try 30.

Jameson, Postmodernism, 291.</page><page sequence="10">THE DIALECTICS OF JAMESON'S DIALECTICS 93 to write just a little bit more clearly in the future- but that was not Jameson's reaction. His defense is that you inevitably get difficult prose if you deal with the kind of difficult topics he typically addresses.35 But this is the sort of argument that says that the description of something blue should be blue itself- and that will convince few people. A better explanation (and partial excuse for Jameson's arcane prose) would, in my view, be an appeal to his embrace of dialectics. In dialectical argument concepts are always in transition, and necessarily so because of their continuous shuttling between what epistemologists like to refer to as "language" and "real- ity." Language and the concepts we use are in permanent flux in dialectical and historical thought- think of Nietzsche's slogan "definierbar ist nur was keine Geschichte hat" (one can only define things that have no history). Obviously, this makes historical debate vague and imprecise and dialectical argument dif- ficult to nail down; in fact, if you find this intolerable you had better stop reading history (and dialectical texts) at all.36 It also follows that clear and unambiguous prose will be seen from the perspective of the dialectician as a sure sign of the "reification" of language, of a fixation on the relationship between language and the world that dialectics should always avoid. As Jameson puts it: "I believe that theory is to be grasped as the perpetual and impossible attempt to dereify the lan- guage of thought, and to preempt all the systems and ideologies which inevitably result from the establishment of this or that fixed terminology" (9). But there are more obstacles for the Jameson reader. There is the prolixity of his texts often obscuring the demarcation between the important and what is mere detail, the immense size of most of his books, and the fact that they are almost all collections of previously published essays. Jameson himself justifies his prefer- ence for the article or essay with the argument that in the contemporary intellectu- al world books have become a less appropriate vehicle for theoretical reflection. Perhaps. Nevertheless, it cannot be doubted that prolific writers such as Jameson would do their audience a most welcome service by now and then publishing a monograph explaining where they presently are on their intellectual journey. The problem is further aggravated by the fact that, as far as I can see, there has been little development in Jameson's thought: he seems to hold the same theories now that he argued for in the 1970s (though, of course, these theories are applied to ever new topics). There is nothing wrong with this- no doubt about that! -but it does reinforce the reader's impression of having been thrown into a sea of texts without compass or destination, and left to try to find one's way in it. Finally, since all of Jameson's writings are uncompromisingly theoretical, one sometimes wonders whether so much theory might not be counterproductive in the end. There is a real world outside "theory," after all, in which a Marxist theo- rist, probably more than any other, might wish to intervene. Do we not expect the Marxist theorist to focus more than any other on changing the world rather than on understanding it? I would agree therefore with Rorty's lament that there is little sign in Jameson's oeuvre of his being aware of this. Indeed, the second and 35. Roberts, Fredric Jameson , 6. 36. In recent decades there has been much interest in so-called "fuzzy thinking"- which does indeed fill a lacuna in contemporary philosophy.</page><page sequence="11">94 FRANK ANKERSMIT third parts of Rorty's Achieving Our Country are one continuous, subterranean philippic against Jameson's unrestrained lust for theory and abstraction. For this is, according to Rorty, what killed the American cultural Left, and here Jameson is his primary target: [T]he difference between this residual Left and the academic Left is the difference between people who read books like Thomas Geoghegan' s Which Side Are You On?- a brilliant explanation of how unions get busted- and people who read Jameson's Post- modernism, or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism. The latter is an equally brilliant book, but it operates on a level of abstraction too high to encourage any particular political initiative. After reading Geoghegan, you have views on some of the things which need to be done. After reading Jameson, you have views on practically everything except on what needs to be done.37 We can be sure that Rorty has no a priori bias against Jameson's political con- ceptions. On the contrary, he can be expected to be fully open to all that Jameson thinks and writes, and not to be far removed from him on the political spectrum, so such criticism should not be dismissed out of hand. III. DIALECTICS Against the background of the foregoing we can pencil in the main contours of the book under review. The book is huge, 620 pages, over 300,000 words; again, the book is a collection of essays published between 1993 and 2009 (though one of them is from 1981). It is the first part of a trilogy and will be followed by a book on Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit and one on Marx's Capital. Unfortu- nately, there is no introduction or conclusion suggesting how these three books will be related or how to approach this one.38 But perhaps such an elucidation would only state the obvious and therefore be superfluous. When dealing with dialectics Jameson begins by distinguishing among 1) "the dialectics" 2) "dialectics," and 3) the adjective "dialectical." Jameson defines "the dialectics" as the subsumption "of all varieties of dialectical thinking under a single philosophical system, and probably, in the process, to affirm that this system is the truth. And ultimately the only viable philosophy" (page 5; Jame- son goes on to add that this is how he would look at dialectics himself). So the strategy of distinguishing between 1) on the hand and 2) and 3) on the other is to suggest that there are more dialectics in the world than just "the dialectic" and that anyone wishing to participate successfully in the contemporary academic 37. Richard Rorty, Achieving Our Country: Leftist Thought in Twentieth-Century America (Cam- bridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1998), 78 .1 would like to thank John White for having drawn my attention to Rorty's book. However, Jameson might have a thought-provoking rejoinder to Rorty's criticism: "what happens is that the more powerful the vision of some increasingly total system or logic- the Foucault of the prisons book is an example- the more powerless the reader comes to feel. Insofar as the theorist wins, therefore, by constructing an increasingly closed and terrifying machine, to that very degree he loses, since the critical capacity of his work is thereby paralyzed. . . (Jameson, Postmodernism , 5). Thus Jameson might reply that it is precisely the impossibility of basing political action on his work that proves how right he is. It is a strong argument, but whoever uses it wins a pyrrhic victory over his opponent. 38. See 69, note 68 for a brief comment on how the book relates to the forthcoming ones on Hegel's Phenomenology and on Marx.</page><page sequence="12">THE DIALECTICS OF JAMESON'S DIALECTICS 95 world must have installed the dialectics program on his intellectual PC. You have dialectics, for example, in Kant's transcendental dialectics, in Nietzsche, in Bergson, in Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations , in Deleuze, and so on. All these philosophers "do" dialectics in one way or another, but without neces- sarily subscribing to Hegelian or Marxist dialectics. Even liberal philosophers work with dialectics: just think of Mandeville's "private vice, public virtue" or of Smith's "invisible hand" (287). Jameson discusses two specific traditions at length in this context: structuralism and deconstructivism. As we all know, structuralism requires us to look at culture in terms of binary codes where each element of the code is the other's opposite, even though for each element the presence of the other is the condition for its own existence. Self-evidently this must remind us of the role played by negation in dialectics. It is to this extent that structuralism can, indeed, be said to be "dialectical." The difference is, though, that in structuralism negation does not penetrate into the components themselves that are each other's binary opposition. They would remain what they are if the negation or opposition were taken away. As Jameson puts it, in structuralism "each pole of the specific dualism ... is governed by distinct laws and dynamics, which cannot be made to apply to or to govern the opposite term" (25). This is not the case with dialectics. Jameson mentions a fas- cinating example: Fritz Lang's film Woman at the Window (1944). After seeing the film the viewer does not know whether the film's main character is "a quiet, kind, decent, bourgeois professor dreaming that he is a murderer or a murderer dreaming, in his everyday life, that he is a quiet, kind, decent, bourgeois profes- sor" (57). Now, if one gets stuck in this dilemma, then one has not understood the film because there would simply be two mutually exclusive interpretations, which is not a matter of much interest. What is of interest and what the film wishes to convey is that a quiet, kind, decent, bourgeois professor can just as well be a murderer. That is the shocking message of the film that only comes across if the two opposite possibilities interpenetrate39 so that the viewer is constantly aware that the professor may be a murderer and the murderer a professor. The message is that the professor may be a murderer and vice versa.40 This was surely a most appropriate insight at the time that the Holocaust was nearing its dismal completion! Only this is " true " dialectics. As Jameson nicely summarizes: the deconcealment of structuralist antinomies that is "at the root of practical or theoretical dilemmas can serve as a powerful instrument of ideological analysis (as in deconstruction), but it should not be confused with the more dynamic and productive act of setting the antinomy itself in motion, that is to say, revealing it 39. This is the process that dialecticians call "mediation." As Jameson quotes Adorno: "media- tion is therefore in Hegel never- as any number of fateful misunderstandings since Kierkegaard would have it- a midpoint between the extremes: rather mediation takes place within the extremes themselves: and this is the radical feature of Hegel which is irreconcilable with any moderate or intermediary position" (56). 40. This also provides us with the model for how to think about the relationship between base and superstructure: we should begin with recognizing their opposition- and hence recognize their relative autonomy with regard to each other- but only in order to see that their opposition is the fuel for the machine of their dialectical interaction (47ff.).</page><page sequence="13">96 FRANK ANKERSMIT to have in reality been the form of a contradiction: for it is the unmasking of the antinomy as contradiction which constitutes dialectical thinking as such" (43). This is precisely why dialectics is so basic to all historical thought. For it is the historian's main task always to be aware of the dialectical proliferation of meaning, to see how meanings may invite their opposites, or negations, and to recognize that this interplay of meanings may never be broken off on penalty of "reification" (see the introduction) and which is tantamount to not being a histo- rian. There is no better example of this than Hegel's own "cunning of Reason": within this context it must be observed that in world history the actions of human beings may sometimes have results differing completely from what these human beings had in mind or intended to achieve, and from what was directly known and desired by them. Indeed, these human agents achieved their goals; but something more was brought about by this as well, that certainly had its roots in their actions, but not in their consciousness and intentions.41 Intentional meaning automatically produces nonintended meaning, and that may very well be its very opposite or negation. Colling woodian hermeneutics and its more recent variants, such as that proposed by Skinner or Bevir, is prototypi- cally blind to this dialectics of meaning. Admittedly, it proposes a way of looking at history whose value nobody would wish to deny. Nevertheless, if one aspires to being a true historian this can only be the beginning, and the real historical work will be done only on the trajectory of dialectical reflection coming after it. After Jameson's criticism of structuralism we may wonder whether he would consider poststructuralism in its Derridian deconstructivist garb an improvement. This question is not easy to answer. For when Jameson discusses Derrida he focuses on Glas and on Spectres de Marx- hence, on books in which Derrida analyzes Hegel and Marx and about whom Jameson has very pronounced opin- ions himself. The result is that it becomes hard to discern between 1) Jameson's appraisal of deconstruction and 2) Jameson's disagreement with Derrida over Hegel and/or Marx.42 Obviously, these two things must be carefully kept apart. Perhaps the closest to an ex cathedra comment on Derrida and deconstruction is the unconcealed relish with which Jameson expatiates on Derrida' s own confes- sion "I don't know how to tell stories" (131)- and where it becomes clear to every reader that this necessarily puts Derrida outside the world in which dia- lecticians, like Jameson, live. The Jameson of The Political Unconscious would be the first to stress that dialectics is nothing other than one way of codifying 41 . "jener Zusammenhang enthält nämlich dies, dass in der Weltgeschichte durch die Handlungen der Menschen noch etwas anders überhaupt herauskomme, als sie bezwecken und erreichen, als sie unmittelbar wissen und wollen. Sie vollbringen ihr Interesse; aber es wird noch ein Ferneres damit zustande gebracht, dass auch innerlich darin liegt, aber das nicht in ihrem Bewusstsein und ihrer Absicht lag." G. W. F. Hegel, Vorlesungen über die Philosophie der Weltgeschichte. Band /. Die Vernunft in der Geschichte (Hamburg: Felix Meiner Verlag, 1970), 88. 42. An additional problem is that Jameson's text is often regrettably unhelpful here. See, for example, 104, 105. It is clear that Jameson disagrees here with Derrida' s interpretation of Hegel's notion of "Aufhebung," but even after several rereadings of these two pages I have been unable to put my fìnger on what exactly the disagreement is about. There is more clarity on 106 where Derrida is accused of reverting to the rather banal question of whether Hegel was a theologian rather than a philosopher. But, of course, this is of little help if we wish to find out about Jameson's appraisal of deconstructivism.</page><page sequence="14">THE DIALECTICS OF JAMESON'S DIALECTICS 97 narrative, and this seems to suggest that, according to Jameson, at the end of the day, the deconstructivist and the dialectician simply live in different worlds. Nev- ertheless, in the long chapter on Derrida mainly focusing on Spectres de Marx , Jameson opts for a strategy of peaceful coexistence with deconstructivism.43 But a clearly repressed criticism sometimes shimmers through Jameson's exposition. For example, he observes that there are "moments of lowered guard" in Derrida' s customary posture of a philosophy that "neither affirmeth nor deny- eth" and where Jameson clearly prefers Rorty to Derrida (136). Similarly, when Derrida criticizes Marx for attempting to unmask specters with the argument that such an attempt is inevitably just one more fight against specters for the simple, but decisive, reason that specters do not exist, Jameson respectfully observes that the belief in specters is sometimes less harmless than their nonexistence seems to suggest (143ff.). Reminding us of this possibility is clearly what the Marxist notion of ideology has always been about. Finally, in Spectres de Marx Derrida discusses Marx's polemic against S timer- and we know this polemic to have been a particularly bitter and vehe- ment one since Marx was painfully aware that Stirner had been more successful in exorcising the last "specters" of Hegelian idealism than he himself had been. Derrida commented on this: "my own feeling is that Marx is afraid of himself, he obsessively pursues someone who is not far from being a perfect likeness of himself, a brother, a double, thus a diabolical image. A sort of phantom of him- self. That he would like to distance from himself, to distinguish from himself: to oppose" (173). And then Jameson, though almost à contre coeur , comes up with the inevitable rejoinder: namely, that there is a good deal of hypocrisy in Derrida' s "Es-Deutung" of Marx. For what philosopher is, after all, more "afraid of himself' than Derrida? Indeed, does not his permanent ontological and episte- mologica! abstinence and persistent preference for the parasitical use of other's arguments rather than "risking" one of his own, not make him into the very para- digm of philosophical "cowardice" (my term, not Jameson's, to be sure)? The undertone of irritation in Jameson's otherwise so very respectful discussion of Derrida and deconstructivism therefore need not be surprising. Who could blame Jameson for that? When turning to Jameson's own account of dialectics, two comments are in order. First, recall that Hegelian dialectics was, at least partly, the result of the Spinozist reaction against all the dualisms that Kant had introduced with his criti- cal philosophy. Since the Pantheismusstreit , beginning in 1786, many German philosophers had come to the conclusion that 1) these dualisms were, in fact, the Achilles' heel of the Kantian system, and 2) they had best be overcome by return- ing to Spinoza's notion of the One Substance- Deus sive natura. With one pow- erful blow this move eliminates the troubling dualisms of Kantian epistemology . Indeed, from the perspective of philosophical strategy, this was a most dextrous 43. Characteristic is his comment "so far, dialectics and deconstruction are consonant with each other: both work to bring up into light the structural incoherence of the 'idea' or conceptual 'posi- tions' or interpretations which are their object of critique." Though a few lines further on he does not hesitate to speak of the "nihilism" of deconstruction, which can hardly have been intended as a compliment (27).</page><page sequence="15">98 FRANK ANKERSMIT move. Nevertheless, no matter how one looks at it, arguing in favor of a Spinoz- ist identity of subject and object will forever remain profoundly counterintuitive if we have the sciences in mind- one need only remember Schelling' s lifelong hopeless wrestling with Naturphilosophie to realize as much. This is why we had better opt for a more modest and less outrageous monism by mixing Spinoza's monism with Vico' s "verum et factum convertuntur," with the result that the scope of Spinoza's monism is safely restricted to Vico' s world that has been made by man himself. Even more so, Spinozist monism is then almost trivially true. For who can make a clear demarcation between subject and object in the domain of culture, the humanities, and so on? We need only think of Freud's superego to recognize that all our thoughts, plans, decisions, fears, and hopes are permeated through and through with social and cultural determi- nations. We cannot live for even a moment without them nor they without us. The monism of subject and object is for the social and cultural world a basic and indisputable truth. We can therefore only agree with Jameson when he rejects Friedrich Engels 's (and Hegel's own) claim that dialectics should be valid for the sciences as well. Indeed, this may remove one more obstacle to our willingness to recognize the plausibility of Hegelian dialectics as our conceptual model when reflecting on cultural and historical reality. This leads me to a second comment. Hegel's dialectics makes sense only as long as one avoids the temptation of reification, whether inspired by materialist or realist assumptions or (unconscious) prejudices. Dialectics resists each effort to pull apart the order of knowledge and the order of what we have knowledge of. Dialectics is, so to speak, always "a thinking- with-the-thing." Admittedly, it is not easy to live up to this demand consistently, for we are all born "reifiers." Reification promises to give us a hold on the world for which we are always striving just as desperately as the drowning person for a piece of wood that might save his or her life. Against this background one may well have doubts about the ease with which Jameson is able to assimilate philosophical systems into his thought, though those systems may have contours that do not appear to agree with dialectics. Think, for example, of the Lacanian triad of the imaginary, the symbolic, and the Real where the symbolic order comes close to how the category of language functions in current accounts of the relationship between language and the world. This is certainly not meant to present Lacan as an (albeit peculiar) philosopher of language but to suggest that the Lacanian triad comes closer to current discussions in philosophy of language than to dialectics, and where such notions as the imaginary, the symbolic order, and the Real could only be used sous rature , to speak with Derrida. One thus has to ask oneself what is left of such notions once they are imported into Jameson's dialectical overall framework? One could equally think of Deleuze' s distinction between "codes" and "axioms." Codes are a matter of "custom and myth" and, as such, are probably reducible to a dialectical framework, but axioms "are operational; they do not offer anything for commentary or exegesis, but rather are merely a set of rules to be put into effect" (186) and thus appear to be quite undialectical. This is all the more wor- rying since for Deleuze, it is axioms and not codes that govern economics; this is the domain of dialectics par excellence for Marxists. So one wonders whether</page><page sequence="16">THE DIALECTICS OF JAMESON'S DIALECTICS 99 Jameson is at all times sufficiently aware of whether the many philosophical systems he tries to incorporate into his own thought really do lend themselves to his ever-so-hospitable eclecticism. IV. PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY It will not be surprising that Jameson discusses at length what several Hegelian and Marxist theorists have had to say on history and on our relationship to the past- theorists such as Lukàcs, Benjamin, Adorno, Horkheimer, Althusser, or Habermas. Nor that he has only meager interest in contemporary philosophy of history and its practitioners. As we have seen, for Jameson dialectics originated from the Spinozist revolt against Kantian epistemology and the dualisms result- ing from it, whereas for the last half-century, philosophy of history has held an almost exclusive interest in epistemological issues as occasioned by the question of the possibility and nature of historical knowledge. It therefore follows that contemporary philosophers of history would have little to offer Jameson even when they decide to write about Marx.44 For though an epistemological approach to Marx is certainly possible- no doubt about that!- one can only agree with Jameson's view that such an approach must remain blind to the very essence of Hegelian and Marxist dialectics. Nevertheless, a large part of Valences of the Dialectic deals with the philoso- phy of history of Paul Ricoeur- another discouragingly prolific writer. It is not easy to say why Jameson awarded to Ricoeur the honor of his interest in prefer- ence to any other philosopher of history. After all, because of his background in phenomenology Ricoeur does not seem to be notably closer to Jameson's own dialectical thought than is any other contemporary philosopher of history. Jame- son himself seems to recognize this when he characterizes Ricoeur as a "human- ist" or as "clearly a traditional philosopher" and these epithets are certainly not meant to be understood as compliments (485). 45 Moreover, Ricoeur never showed any interest in dialectics,46 or Hegel, and/or Marx. Finally, as we shall see in a moment, there is very little that Jameson actually finds worth recommending in Ricoeur' s philosophy of history. To my mind, Gadamer would have been a more obvious choice from Jame- son's perspective, first, because Gadamer can be seen as the most profound thinker in the hermeneuticist tradition. Although it is true that hermeneuticism arose from an epistemological inspiration (culminating in Dilthey), it has always remained fairly close to a Spinozist, Vichian, and/or dialectical approach to 44. As, for example, Melvin Rader, Marx's Interpretation of History (New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1979), or G. A. Cohen, Karl Marx's Theory of History (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1978). These are brilliant books, unparalleled in their knowledge of Marx's text and in the precision and perspicacity with which they analyze these texts. But their "throbbing heart" has been cut out. 45. It is true that just earlier Jameson had praised Ricoeur' s work as "a stunning example of the dialectic" (484)- but surely the term "dialectic" must be understood metaphorically here. 46. Though with some creative pulling and pushing, Ricoeur' s argument about the relationship among mimesis,, mimesis2, and mimesis3 could be fitted within a dialectical model. But Jameson apparently does not feel challenged to try to do so (502-510).</page><page sequence="17">1 00 FRANK ANKERSMIT history. One might well say that hermeneutics gives us the most ontological of epistemologies and the most epistemological of ontologies. Moreover, in Truth and Method , Gadamer was at pains to remove all traces of epistemology from hermeneutics.47 Second, one need only think of the so-called hermeneutic circle to recognize the affinities of hermeneutics with dialectical thought. But Jameson mentions Gadamer only once and when doing so mistakenly attributes to him views that had been proposed by Koselleck (527). One other more obvious choice would have been Hay den White. Like Jameson himself, White is much more interested in how we relate to the past than in epistemological niceties. Moreover, White shares Jameson's fascination with literature and with how literature may help us understand the nature of our relationship to the past. Both call themselves Marxists. Nevertheless, though Jameson is undoubtedly acquainted with White's oeuvre , he refers to it only a few times in passing. Ricoeur organized his own philosophy of history around the experience of time- and Jameson follows him here. When defining his position vis à vis Ricoeur, Jameson distinguishes among three ways of making sense of the experi- ence of time: 1) the psychologist approach, 2) the structuralist approach, and 3) the phenomenological approach (496). Jameson rejects the first- which makes the claim that "tenses merely express more fundamental human experiences of time" (496)- though without explaining why. Jameson is more elaborate on the structuralist approach, mainly associated with Greimas. Both Ricoeur and Jameson praise the structuralist approach for linking the experience of time to narrative : without the capacity for organizing our experiences narratively the experience of time is impossible. But both also criticize structuralism for com- pletely separating narrative structures in our use of language from the experien- tial material itself that is organized by them. The idea is that such structures are outside time themselves, since they are mere systems for how to connect textual components with one another. It then follows that the structuralist approach is sui generis incapable of explaining the experience of time (489, 492). So that leaves us with the third, the phenomenological option. Obviously, this is the approach favored by Ricoeur himself and is, therefore, the occasion of a lengthy exposition of what Jameson finds good and bad in Ricoeur' s philosophy of history. This results in a number of lists of proper- ties that are attributed by several philosophers to how the experience of time presents itself us to us, if seen from a phenomenological point of view. It all begins with the prephenomenological conceptions of time proposed by Aristotle and St. Augustine, and then moves on to Husserl' s thesis that the experience of time is always a matter of "retension" and "protension," which still is closely similar to St. Augustine's conception of time (499, 517). He then moves on to Heidegger's five existentials of "Sorge," "Zuhandenheit," inauthenticity, "Sein zum Tode," and so-called "collective time" (516, 517). This account is compli- cated by the fact that Heidegger had one more list up his sleeve, namely that of 1) "Bedeutsamkeit" (significance), 2) "Datierbarkeit" (datability), and 3) "Ges- panntheit" (spannedness)- and where it is not clear how these two lists hang 47. Though without being wholly successful in this, as I tried to show in my Sublime Historical Experience (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2005), chapter 5.</page><page sequence="18">THE DIALECTICS OF JAMESON'S DIALECTICS Ю1 together (517). Ricoeur further adds to the complication by adding two more lists of his own. The first list distinguishes among: 1) peripeteia , 2) anagnoroosis , and 3) pathos (504), and the second list among: 1) the calendar, 2) the generation, and 3) the Derridian "trace" (51 в).48 Jameson spends a lot of time and space on the pros and cons of all these lists, but one needs to have a theological turn of mind to be able to keep track of his argument here. I shall therefore refrain from trying to do so, all the more so since Jameson approvingly quotes Ricoeur, saying that, in the last analysis, there could be no pure phenomenology of time (482). 49 So, apparently, little is to be expected from these lists anyway. But Jameson has a far more fundamental objection to Ricoeur. He points out that when Ricoeur seeks to test his philosophy of history he turns to novels to provide him with concrete examples. Specifically, he turns to Virginia Woolf s Mrs. Dalloway , Thomas Mann's Der Zauberberg , and Marcel Proust's À la recherche du temps perdu. Jameson would be the first to recognize that what Ricoeur has to say on these novels is absolutely brilliant -however, novels are not historical writing. It is true that all of these novels were written against the dark and threaten- ing background of World War I- which Ricoeur characterizes as an "axial event"50- but all of the action in these novels is not situated in this background itself, whereas such backgrounds are typically at the foreground in historical writ- ing. Moreover, as Jameson mercilessly goes on to say, Ricoeur's blindness to the differences between the novel and historical writing and to the role played by time in each of them is not hard to explain. For here we encounter the incapacity of all of phenomenology to move in a convincing and adequate way from the level of the individual- and to which the novel is condemned- to that of collectivities, such as nations, cultures, classes, and so on and that are the object of study of historians. Phenomenology is marvelous as long as it investigates how the indi- vidual builds up his or her life-world from materials preceding it, but becomes utterly helpless when you move from the individual to the collectivity. Just try, for example, to make sense of the unintended consequences of intentional human action from a phenomenological point of view. Any attempt to do so will provide the non-phenomenological theorist a target that one simply cannot miss. So we can only agree with Jameson when concluding that Ricoeur's humanism and anthropomorphism made him forget to discern between two orders: "that of the appearance of Time and that of the appearance of History" (528).51 48. According to Jameson, in the "trace" "being and not-being co-exist in a fashion unconceptu- alizable by philosophy (this is an aporia if ever there was one)" (527). Some philosophers might feel tempted to use a somewhat more pejorative term here than Jameson's "aporia." 49. And then Jameson goes on to say: "a statement which, coming from the most eminent contem- porary phenomenologist and authority on Husserl, really amounts to a death sentence on philosophy itself' (483). 50. "Axial events" are events in which the frictions among the past, present, and future dramati- cally announce themselves (522). Think of how the French Revolution broke down the continuity among the past, present, and future. 51. It is somewhat disconcerting, to say the least, to see that after this fairly devastating com- ment on Ricoeur's failure to properly distinguish between the novel and historical writing, Jameson continues singing the praises of aesthetics and of the novel for making us see things that we would have remained blind to without them. The novel makes us aware of "the real toads in an imaginary garden," as Jameson nicely puts it (531). I wholly agree; but then the relationship between the novel</page><page sequence="19">1 02 FRANK ANKERSMIT This brings me to one last issue. Jameson invites his readers to recall the Fronde, a Pirandello-like spectacle coupé in the first years of the reign of Louis XIV, with ever-changing fronts and without any deeper historical sense or mean- ing and then asks the rhetorical question: "who should we cheer for in that mud- dled event that was the Fronde? . . . With whom are we to take sides, in a situation in which the so-called people of Paris are to be understood as notables, lawyers, shopkeepers and their apprentices, and very far indeed from anything resembling a proletariat or downtrodden or oppressed masses?" (547, 548). He then goes on to argue that this perplexity is not peculiar to the Fronde only, but a problem that one almost inevitably runs up against when writing history. So this is why Jameson can agree with Lévi-Strauss' s condemnation of historical writing for compelling us to become willy-nilly partisans in struggles with which we have no wish to identify ourselves (547). He then explains this most regrettable feature of historical writing by an appeal to Ricoeur' s notion of the "quasi-character" (546). Ricoeur introduces this notion in order to expand the idea of the historical agent far beyond the range of action of mere individual human beings, of even the Caesars or the Napoleons. Braudel's Mediterranean or Foucault's "discipline" are such "quasi-characters," and these are historical agents no less than Philip II or Jeremy Bentham. It will indeed be hard to avoid writing history without "taking sides" if we people the past with these "quasi-characters." This is a rather amazing argument and is in need of some comments. First, when trying to rescue historians from their sad predicament Jameson recom- mends a strategy that is impossible to reconcile with his condemnation of histori- cal writing for always compelling us to "take sides." For Jameson presents the Marxist interpretation of history as our unerring guide in our dilemma about with whom we should side in the past. So "taking sides" is not such an objectionable procedure, after all, as long as this "taking sides" is guided by the conviction that Marx was basically right. No less amazing is Jameson's (and Lévi-Strauss 's) claim that the historian is always confronted with the obligation to "take sides." For if there is just one thing that (almost) all historians and philosophers of his- tory agree upon, it is undoubtedly that there is no greater sin in historical writing than this "taking sides." Ranke said that it is the historian's supreme task: to stand aloof from the conflicting parties themselves, to understand them, to grasp the intentions of the combatants, to weigh their actions accordingly, and to describe them only against that background. To do justice to each, to the extent that is due to them, that is how the historian ought to proceed. However, it happens only too often that the historian, con- vinced of the infallibility of his own opinions, begins to participate himself in these strug- gles in the past and to decide them in agreement with his own convictions. The historian's narrative then becomes a weapon in the struggle itself, and history then becomes politics.52 and historical writing is fully on the agenda again- and we might therefore invite Jameson to think just a little harder about the nature of this relationship. 52.

Jameson is a most erudite and responsible theorist, so he will undoubtedly be aware that his argument about "taking sides" brings him into a frontal collision with all of contemporary historical writing and philosophy of history. This chal- lenges us to take a somewhat deeper look at the matter and to try to find out what made Jameson say such strange things. The most obvious point to start with is the observation that undoubtedly his- torians do "take sides"- namely, when they debate how we should look at the past. Historians disagree about how we should look at, say, the French Revolu- tion and then devise arguments that would, in their view, convince each reason- able person to "take their side" in the debate on the French Revolution. So we should then ask ourselves how to move from this conception of "taking sides" in historical writing to the one that Jameson had in mind. The simplest way to do this is to hypostatize the views historians have on parts of the past into entities existing in the past itself. This is, of course, what Ricoeur was doing with his "quasi-characters," and this earned him Jameson's criticism, as we saw a moment ago. But we can be sure that Jameson is guilty of the same mistake- for his own argument about "taking sides" in history only makes sense after a fusion of the order of knowing (that is, "taking sides" in a historical discussion) with that of being (that is, "taking sides" in the sense of identifying with historical agents in the past itself). There is no other way to move from the former sense of "taking sides" to the latter. We should observe, however, that for a dialectical philosopher like Jameson there is nothing particularly outrageous about the fusion of these two senses of "taking sides." For this fusion of knowing and being is precisely what the dialec- tical tradition inherited from Spinozism (as we saw in section II). This, then, is where Jameson's position would differ from Ricoeur' s . Ricoeur is not a Spinoz- ist; he safely operates in the epistemological tradition- and here the fusion of the two senses of "taking sides" does indeed require one to hypostatize historical views into historical agents. But this is different from Jameson. We therefore cannot accuse Jameson of inconsistency when criticizing Ricoeur while at the same time doing the exact same thing as Ricoeur by requiring us to "take sides" as Marx wishes us to do. Indeed, both come to the same result, but from a wholly different background. When expounding dialectics in section II, I argued that Spinozism makes sense if applied to human history. The question thus arises whether Jameson might not be right after all. Perhaps the domain of human history is such that the fusion of knowing and being (and, hence, of the two senses of "taking sides") is not only legitimate here, but even a necessary truth about the nature of historical writing, with the result that historians and philosophers of history who attack Jameson for his most objectionable recommendation of "taking sides" (in his sense), now find themselves in the dock. Jameson can now rightly denounce them as naïve positiv- iste falsely believing that they could rise above the great "powers" active in the past and present themselves (however one might wish to define their nature) to some timeless, ahistorical Archimedean point from which they can pronounce</page><page sequence="21">1 04 FRANK ANKERSMIT about their conflict. This is certainly a most powerful rejoinder to Ranke and his thousands of contemporary followers- whether historians or philosophers of history. So the question now is: how can we 1) accept Spinozism with Jameson (and dialectics) and at the same time 2) avoid the fusion of these two meanings of "taking sides"? Having arrived at this stage, we should recall Louis O. Mink's argument on "Universal History." Mink defended the amazing claim that, despite thirty years of speculative-history bashing (he wrote this in the 1980s) most his- torians and philosophers of history still believe in "Universal History." For they all assume that there should be some "untold" story in the past itself and that it is the historian's task to approximate this as well as one can with one's own stories. This belief is, from whatever way you look at it, what speculative philosophy has always been about. But as Mink goes on to say, there is no such "Universal History." Although historians can tell stories about the past and although some of them are demonstrably better (or worse) than others, the past is not a story or a narrative itself, stories and narratives are found only in history books, or in novels, for that matter.53 Just as the physicist's formula can be found only in the articles written by physicists, not in actual physical reality itself. As I have recently suggested elsewhere,54 Mink's argument (whose tremendous theoretical significance is impossible to overestimate) comes quite close to the gist of Donald Davidson's attack on conceptual schemes.55 In both cases the main idea is that there are no fixed rules or algorithms of whatever nature tying together language and the world. For Davidson, the claim is argued by an attack on the epistemological scheme that allegedly enables us to move faultlessly from lan- guage to the world, and vice versa. Similarly for Mink, much the same is argued by showing that stories and narratives simply have no counterpart in the past itself. In both cases we therefore have knowledge and being- whose existence no Spinozist feels any temptation to deny!- but without there being some clear and final demarcation line between the two of them (coinciding, for example, with the alleged barrier between subject and object or with that between language and the world). Both knowledge and being are simply part of some larger whole within which a continuous- dialectical, if you will- interaction is going on between the two of them. Davidson's theory could thus be characterized as a Spinozism with- out the notion of the One Substance; the same would be so for Mink. Next, precisely because of the absence of any such epistemological rules tying language or knowledge to the world, language or narrative would have a certain autonomy with regard to what they are about. This is dramatized by Mink's claim that the historian's narrative does not possess its exact counterpart in the past itself. But such a claim entails that we abandon Jameson's model suggesting that "taking sides" on the level of the writing of history cannot be discerned from, 53. Louis O.

This inability to recognize the ways that Spinozism and/or dialectics is able to grant an autonomy of its own to knowledge is, in the last analysis, the error in Jameson's argument. But as we have seen, adopting Spinozism and/or dialectics is reconcil- able with the old Rankean maxim that the historian should never "take sides" in the Jamesonian sense; this is a most satisfactory finding indeed. V. CONCLUSION "Gallia omnis divisa est in partes tres," said Caesar. So it is with Jameson's book, which also consists of three parts. The first part deals with dialectics, the third part with philosophy of history. Both parts were discussed above. Between the two of them is a third part of a more varied character- though mainly devoted to more practical and political issues. Jameson's political pronouncements are, on the whole, in agreement with what one would expect a Marxist to believe. Even so, it may surprise readers when Jameson declares that Soviet communism did not fail because of its weaknesses but because of its success (397);56 that prerevolution- ary regimes should be held responsible for all the crimes of revolutionary terror- ism (298, 389); that the Right has always provoked the violence in communist states (which makes one wonder how Jameson would assess the Hungarian and Czechoslovakian revolts of 1956 and 1968 and the achievement of Solidarnošč in the 1980s); that the political tyranny of Stalin should be seen in the light of the universally accepted doctrine that the state has the monopoly on violence (385) or that "Stalinism was thus a success and fulfilled its historic mission, socially as well as economically, and it is idle to speculate whether this could have happened in some more normal peaceful, evolutionary way" (397). This last quote especially could be read as an extenuation of the show trials, the Gulags, the great famine, and all the other horrors unleashed by Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, and so on. I am not saying that such a reading would be correct, but Jameson does not take the trouble to avoid being misunderstood here. This is all the more regrettable because he does not devote one word to the many millions who lost their lives under the most dreadful circumstances in the name of Marxist ideology. This needlessly compro- mises Jameson's political pronouncements. Even if one is willing to share most of Jameson's Marxist analysis of our contemporary Western societies and of what is wrong with them (as is the case with me), he goes to political extremes that will make him lose even his most sympathetic audiences. At times it even looks as though he willfully prefers provocation to conviction. Given Jameson's political pronouncements (cited above), an appeal to the Marxist doctrine of the unity of theory and praxis might lead the reader to infer that his theory of dialectics must then be wrong as well. But such a reaction would be as overhasty as it is short-sighted; here we must recall that Hegel's dialectics presents us with precisely the reverse of Marx's unity of theory and praxis. For Hegel, wisdom comes only in the evening when the owls of Minerva fly out, and here "theory" comes after "praxis"- as is, of course, typically the case with 56. Though he writes on the very next page that Soviet communism was no match for the West because of its "flimsy " structures.</page><page sequence="23">106 FRANK ANKERSMIT historical writing as well. Here, the doctrine of the unity of theory and praxis is not necessarily part of dialectics, and dialectics is therefore not automatically compromised if someone were to infer objectionable political conclusions from it. This is all the more reason to look forward to Jameson's next books on Hegel's Phänomenologie and on Marx's Das Kapital. Let's never forget that dialectics is the key to many of the secrets of historical writing, and therefore we should be most grateful to Fredric Jameson for having so powerfully reminded us of that.
