<plain_text><page sequence="1">SEA HORSE, William M. and Peggy Stephens, 48 pp., $3.50, Holiday House New York, 1969. This is an unusual children's book in that it is entirely suited to the in- tended audience, and still is neither anthropomorphic nor condescending. The illustrations are functional rather than merely decorative, and even though they have no captions, their meaning is unmistakable. The book is recommended for young readers and for reading aloud to pre-readers. H.G.</page></plain_text>
