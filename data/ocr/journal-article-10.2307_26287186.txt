<plain_text><page sequence="1">ACADEMIC DISCOURSE AT HAVANA: PAN AMERICAN EUGENICS AND TRANSNATIONAL CAPITAL IN ALEJO CARPENTIER's ;ecue-yamba-o! Stephen M.Park When it was first published in Madrid in 1933, iEcue-Yamba-O! novela afrocubana must have been an object of curiosity. As Roberto Gonzalez Echevarria has imagined it, the few readers who came across this book were most likely puzzled by its indecipherable title (which in Afro Cuban vernacular would translate to Praised Be the Lord!) and by its virtually unknown author, who, until then, had published only music reviews and a few poems (Gonzalez Echevarria 64). Beyond the title page, the novel is devoted, as the subtitle promised, to an "Afro Cuban" story about Menegildo Cue, a man who grows up in rural Cuba and, after committing a murder that lands him in a Havana jail, is initiated into the city's strange criminal underworld. The novel's main characters speak a mix of underworld cant and vernacular Spanish, the text exchanging r's for I's and eliding whole syllables. There is an accompanying "Glossary" to guide the reader through this cant and, interspersed amid this strange text are illustrations of black dancers, photographs of orishas and animist deities. In this sense, the book, at first glance, may have seemed to early readers to be a study in anthropology more than a novel. Mfs MFS Modern Fiction Studies,Volume 58, number I, Spring 2012.

ACADEMIC DISCOURSE AT HAVANA: PAN AMERICAN EUGENICS AND TRANSNATIONAL CAPITAL IN ALEJO CARPENTIER's IÉCUE-YAMBA-Ô! Stephen M. Park</page><page sequence="2">Park 47 What were readers in 1933 to make of this strange book and its concern with Afro Cuban culture? If it confounded readers of its time, it has similarly confounded readers today. While much atten tion has been paid to Carpentier's later novels, most scholars have excluded iÉcue-Yamba-Ô! from the larger conversation surrounding his work. Moreover, nearly eighty years after its publication, it has yet to be translated into English.1 The few critics who have examined the novel in detail have read it very much in the context of its European publication in 1933 and have argued for understanding it as a Sur realist work.2 Within this reading, Carpentier's focus on Afro Cuban and Haitian workers, their labor in Cuba's sugar plantations, and their incarceration is subsumed under a broad Surrealist fascination with the "primitive," and the original context of Carpentier's setting is lost. The text of iÉcue-Yamba-Ô! ends with two sets of dates fram ing the composition: "First version: Havana Prison, August 1-9, 1927 / Definitive Version-. Paris, January-August, 1933." In order to understand the novel's complexity, we need to attend not only to the context of 1933 Paris, but also to that of 1927 Havana. There fore, I situate the novel within that historical framework for several important reasons. First, it should be remembered that Carpentier composed the first draft of the novel while in Havana's Prado Jail serving time for signing a manifesto opposing the dictatorship of Gerardo Machado, whose close ties with the US government and with US business facilitated the labor conditions that Menegildo and the other characters of iÉcue-Yamba-Ô! faced on the sugar plantations. Second, the Afro Cuban prisoners with whom Carpentier shared his cell provided him with the source material for his novel, making his investment in the characters less abstract than the primitivist reading of the novel suggests. Finally, I situate Carpentier's novel in 1927 because in that year Havana played host to the First Pan American Conference on Eugenics. This conference demonstrated the efforts of US scientists to export biologically defined conceptions of race to Latin America. While these delegates from eighteen American na tions met in Havana to parse the distinctions of racial "vitality" and "degeneracy," Carpentier was in the nearby Prado Jail alongside such degenerates (Transactions 232). At key points in his novel, Carpentier directly engages the eugenicist discourse and correctly identifies it as an extension of US empire and the Pan American project to know and contain Latin America. By reading the novel within this context, I argue that Carpentier reformulates the prison as an alternative archive from which to understand transnational relations.</page><page sequence="3">48 Pan American Eugenics and Transnational Capital The Landscape of Havana: Afro Cubans, Sugar, and Transnational Capitalism The plot of the novel is fairly simple: it follows the life of Mene gildo Cué from birth to death. Growing up amid the cane fields of rural Cuba, his childhood is intended to show the typical life of black Cubans, defined by physical labor and traditional African culture.3 Along the way, he passes through a series of initiations. In the "In fancy" section of the novel, Menegildo is introduced to his family's animist deities (which he, significantly, knocks over and breaks). "Adolescence" describes his sexual initiation when he meets Longina, a Haitian immigrant who labors at a nearby cane field. They eventu ally conceive a child, but things become complicated when Longina's common-law husband, Napoliön, assaults Menegildo. In retaliation, Menegildo murders him and is sent to Havana's Prado jail, where his final initiation into the criminal underworld of the nâningo takes place. It is in this final "City" section that Menegildo's story moves into decline, his criminal activities leading to his eventual death at the hands of a rival gang. Rather than a conventional story of development, iÉcue-Yamba Ô! presents the story of Menegildo's underdevelopment. More pre cisely, the plot marks his path toward delinquency, a key term among criminologists of the time. While these scientists set out to identify the biological reasons that would explain why so many blacks were in prison, Carpentier's narrative offers an alternative explanation, one that looks to the social and political conditions of Cuba in order to understand Menegildo's delinquency. In his 1977 preface to the novel, Carpentier described how the characters grew out of his childhood acquaintances who "learned to welcome me, the white boy whose father, to the scandal of our fam ily friends, 'let him play with blacks.'" He claimed to have found, in "their misery in the bohfo [shanty]," a "dignity" worthy of celebrating in his novel, but, more important to his political purposes in iÉcue Yamba-Ô!, the blacks of his childhood possessed "ancestral beliefs and practices that signified, in reality, a resistance against the dis sipating powers of external factors" (ll).4 Therefore, more than just an anthropological fascination, the novel's immersion in the details of Afro Cuban religious practices reflects Carpentier's desire to offer an alternative reading of the transnational forces corrupting Cuba—the sugar industry, US support of the Machado dictatorship, as well as Pan American eugenic and immigration policies. These external fac tors had constructed the Afro Cubans of Carpentier's childhood as degenerate and criminal, and so in iÉcue-Yamba-Ô! he attempts to understand these global systems from the internal perspective of the</page><page sequence="4">Park 49 culture itself. By exploring Afro Cuban culture, particularly the hâningo subculture that Menegildo finds in prison, Carpentier frames his novel as a redemptive work to counter the pathologized and criminalized view that Cuban society had of its black population. While I will begin by exploring the novel within this national context, it is crucial that we also understand the transnational valence Carpentier gives to Afro Cuban culture. All of the external factors that he will rail against are there from the beginning of the novel. Carpentier makes clear at the outset of the novel that the ma chine of capitalism, symbolized by the rhythmic churnings of the local sugar mill (the ingenio), is a dehumanizing force that dictates the rhythms of life and drives Menegildo, and the novel, into Havana's underworld. As the novel opens, the first image that Carpentier offers the reader is the ingenio, as Menegildo's father, Usebio Cué, watches it rise with a creeping force of inevitability to dominate the landscape: Angular, simple lines like the figure of a theorem, the block of the Central San Lucio rose in the center of a wide valley bordered by a crest of blue hills. Old Usebio Cué had seen the fungus of steel, plaster and concrete grow over the ruins of the ancient sugar mills, attending year after year, in the manner of an admiring ghost, to the conquests of space achieved by industry. (15) Anguloso, sencillo de li'neas como figura de teorema, el bloque del Central San Lucio se alzaba en el centro de un ancho valle orlado por una cresta de colinas azules. El viejo Usebio Cué habia visto crecer el hongo de acero, palastro y concreto sobre las ruinas de trapiches antiguos, asistiendo ano tras ano, con una suerte de espanto admirativo, a las conquistas de espacio realizadas por la fabrica. (15) As part of one of the novel's several "Landscape" ("Paisaje") chapters, these first sentences do far more than establish a pastoral setting. Carpentier first uses the vocabulary of geometry to describe the sugar mill, as if it were some abstraction, as intangible as a "theorem." In the next sentence, though, the Central takes on the organic proper ties of a "fungus," feeding off of dead tissue and growing rapidly and inevitably over the valley's decaying sugar mills. This brief chapter recounts the story of how Usebio, before Menegildo's birth, lost the land that had been in the Cué family for generations. Once the foreign owned ingenio, the San Lucio, moved in, it began to buy up land from the local peasants for somewhat large sums, the result of the high value of sugar during World War I when US trade options were limited, a period known in Cuba as the "Dance of Millions." Usebio,</page><page sequence="5">50 Pan American Eugenics and Transnational Capital however, waited too long to sell his land. The sugar market crashed and his land was worth half of what it had been, but by now the San Lucio had achieved a monopoly in the region and it was Usebio's only option. Ultimately, the Cués end up working the same sugar fields they always had, but now they do so as tenant farmers on land owned by a foreign company. Thus, in a few pages, Carpentier conveys the "conquest of space achieved by industry" (15). Even though the novel eventually moves away from the cane field, all of Carpentier's themes, from his celebration of local Afro Cuban culture to his critique of the Cuban state and transnational capital, pass through the mill in this chapter. We see the conflation of all these issues within the ingenio as the machine rips indigenous materials from the ground and whitens them for export: The locomotive pulls out millions of sacks full of red crystals that still know the earth, hooves and bad words. The foreign refinery will return them pale, lifeless, after their journey over discolored seas. From the doctrine of the sun, to the doctrine of the manometer. (15) La locomotora arrastra miliares de sacos llenos de cris talitos rojos que todavîa saben a tierra, pezunas y malas palabras. La refineria extranjera los devolvera pâlidos, sin vida, después de un viaje sobre mares descoloridos. De la disciplina de sol a la disciplina de manômetros. (16) In this scene, the land and its materials are the literal objects of conquest, but it is important to note the shift in knowledge forma tion that Carpentier implies. Along with the raw sugar, the "bad words" muttered by the workers as they bring in the harvest are also consumed by the ingenio, effectively silencing their complaints and extinguishing their language. By indicating a shift in "doctrine," from traditional agricultural life to the scientific pressure gauges of the Central's machines, Carpentier emphasizes the extent to which the growth of industry depends on a reorganization of knowledge and, as we shall see throughout the novel, an insistence on measurement. Once the language of the workers has been processed, we are left with the "lifeless" language of capital. As Usebio and the other workers throw their crops into the refinery's oven, they encounter a burning bush of capitalism: But the cut made, the fiber breaks under the arc of the steelyard. The fire speaks: "For each hundred arrobas of cane that the sugar planter delivers to the Company, he will receive the equivalent in official money of X arrobas</page><page sequence="6">Park 51 of refined sugar, polarization 96 grade, according to the fortnightly average corresponding to the fortnight in which the cane for sale was milled." (15-16) Pero hecho el corte, el hilo se rompe bajo el arco de la ro mana. Habla el fuego : "Por cada cien arrobas de cana que el colono entregue a la Comapni'a, recibirâ el équivalente en moneda oficial de equis arrobas de azücar centrïfuga, polarizaciôn 96 grados, segün el promedio quincenal cor resspondiente a la quincena en que se hayan molido las carias que se liquidan." (15-16) The language itself transforms the "doctrine of the sun" by which the Cués have lived into an economic system of weights and measures whereby the value of labor is calculated according to the market price of sugar. If the ingenio produces only what is "pale" and "lifeless," it is in black culture that the novel locates all that is vital and opposed to transnational capital. As Carpentier phrases it at one of the novel's anti-imperialist high points: "The bongo [was the] antidote to Wall Street!" ("iEl bongô, antîdoto de Wall Street!"; 118). Carpentier's use of Afro Cuban culture is at times problematic since he formulates his characters as gente de la tierra (people of the land) in a way that can make them one dimensional. But behind the superficial white/black dichotomy there lies a much more complicated tension between the rise of global systems of thought and more local kinds of knowledge that Carpentier locates in the Cué family. Perhaps the most obvious sign that Cuba's population was sub ject to transnational forces was the way in which US business interests were protected by the dictatorship of Gerardo Machado. His regime was eventually toppled by the revolution in 1933 (the same year that iÉcue-Yamba-Ô! was published in Madrid), but in 1927 Machado was at the height of his power. Any opposition to the government was quickly suppressed.5 So, when Carpentier, along with other art ists, signed the Minorista Manifesto, demanding among other things free elections, he was quickly arrested and imprisoned in the Prado jail.6 What the Minorista Manifesto also demonstrates, though, is the interconnection between "vernacular art," and what it calls "artistic and scientific doctrines," and the forces of transnational capitalism driven by "Yankee imperialism." While those in power—Machado and his US backers—manipulated this interconnection between science and capital to measure and contain the population, Carpentier, as we shall see, co-opts this same system in order to critique it from below. One of his goals in the novel is to offer an alternative vision of how a transnational community might function, how immigrant laborers of</page><page sequence="7">52 Pan American Eugenics and Transnational Capital all nationalities might recognize their commonalities. This recogni tion is as yet unattainable though since, as the Minorista Manifesto stresses, Cuban workers still live at the mercy of the world's oligarchs. As Carpentier introduces the world of Cuban agriculture in the opening "Landscape" chapter, it is clear that the same political and economic forces that artists were protesting against in Havana also shape the daily lives of those workers in the countryside. Continuing the novel's anthropomorphism, he describes the sugar mill itself as imposing a "tyrannical dictatorship" on the local workers. Carpentier describes the power that the San Lucio held over workers: The latitudes of their pistons—breathless pistons, forged in lands smelling of Christmas trees—were able to change at a whim the rhythm of the lives of men, beasts and plants, imprinting on them frenetic trepidations or at times im mobilizing them in a cruel manner. (16) Los latidos de sus émbolos—émbolos jadeantes, fundidos en tierras olientes a arbol de Navidad—podfan alterar a capricho el ritmo de vida de los hombres, bestias y plantas, imprimiéndole frenéticas trepidaciones o inmovilizândo a veces de modo cruel. (16) Carpentier sees the obvious intersection of the sugar industry and Machado's power over the island as the ingenio metonymically stands in for the dictator himself. The "rhythms" of mechanized labor and the surveillance of Machado's police work in tandem to discipline the population within the confines of transnational capitalism. Indeed, the sugar that the Cués produce sustains the very system that keeps them tied to land they no longer own. It is clear by the end of the chapter that "the ingenio is the law!" (21). Along with the influx of capital to the island, the sugar industry also brought waves of new immigrants to Cuba in order to meet the demands of production. The Cuban population was consequently transformed by this importation of labor, and indeed Carpentier peoples his "Landscape" with a variety of immigrant workers. Most of the newly arrived were workers from nearby islands, and so the novel's streets are also filled with "asthmatic accordions" from Haiti and African rhythms of Kingston as more and more immigrants flow into the region in anticipation of the harvest (18). But in the novel, as in reality, these immigrants meet with resentment and racial hatred in their new homeland. These workers are ordered in by "el Tiburön," the country's nickname for then-Cuban President José Miguel Gomez (1909-1913), in order to meet the demand for labor: "And later, the new plague</page><page sequence="8">Park 53 consented to by the Shark's decree two years before: squadrons of ragged Haitians, who surged over the distant horizon bringing a black mercenary captain with a guano hat and a machete in his belt" ("Y luego, la nueva plaga consentida por un decreto de Tiburôn dos anos antes: escuadrones de haitianos harapaientos, que surglan del horizonte lejano trayendo condotiero negro con sombrero de guano y machete al cinto"; 18). The image of troops invading from Haiti certainly strikes a revolutionary tone, but it also evokes the Haitian Revolution of the eighteenth century and hints at themes Carpen tier would later develop in El reino de este mundo (1949), in which Haiti's Creole gentry flees to the safety of Cuba but anxiously look over their shoulders for the next revolt. These immigrants at once portend revolution and disease. It is tempting to read this "plague" as the sole result of Cuban racism and anti-immigrant sentiment. Indeed, the Afro Cuban characters in iÉcue-Yamba-Ô! freely refer to the Haitians as inferior blacks, and much of the action revolves around Menegildo's forbidden union with a Haitian woman. But even in this opening chapter, Carpentier makes clear the transnational forces at work. He locates the source of the perceived plague not in the immigrants but rather in the sugar industry that has made their migration necessary. The ingenio consumes both sugar and human labor despite the harm this does to the body politic. Carpentier sug gests that the illness ultimately lies in transnational capitalism when, at the end of the long description of immigrants, he collectively refers to them as "those who will enter daily into the belly of the diabetic giant" ("los que entraran cotidianamente en el vientre del gigante diabético; 19). While Cuba had become entirely centered on sugar production, its "body" was incapable of metabolizing the consequences that came with that industry. This language of plague and disease tapped into the global immigration debates of the 1920s, which were largely targeted at excluding immigrants from East Asian countries. Carpentier includes in the "Landscape" chapter an odd assortment of Chinese immigrants, including "Asian horticulturists [who] knelt in the garden making fortuneteller's gestures [as well as] Chinese storekeepers [and their boss] Sung-Sing-Lung, the alimentary cacique of the capital's yel low neighborhood" ("horticultores asiaticos [quien] se arrodillan en el huerto de la casa vivienda con gestos de cartomântica" as well as "almacenistas chinos" and their boss "Sung-Sing-Lung—cacique ali menticio del barrio amarillo de la capital"; 18-19). These allusions to the criminal underworld reflect the way in which Chinese immigrants were perceived in the popular imagination. Such immigrants, as we shall see later in the novel, pose a threat to the economic system because they create networks of exchange outside the authorized</page><page sequence="9">54 Pan American Eugenics and Transnational Capital channels. But this economic threat, as Carpentier will make clear, was framed as a genetic threat so that this imminent "yellow peril" was the driving force behind new immigration policies throughout the Americas. In the US, eugenics research and nativist fears had led to the Immigration Act of 1924, which set quotas for immigration in an attempt to keep the balance of national origins equal to that of the 1890 Census. Although the Act was aimed at Chinese and Eastern European immigrants, it was very much on the minds of intellectuals and policy makers in Latin America.7 At the Pan American Eugenics Conference in 1927, representatives from Latin American govern ments were under pressure from the US to enforce similar restrictions or else have the migration of their own citizens into the US similarly limited. Cuba, for instance, reacted with hostility to its Chinese im migrants, criminalizing and demonizing them almost to the extent it did its black population. It is also important that we understand the circulation of immigrants (and immigration laws) within the trans national framework of the Americas depicted in Carpentier's novel. In the same way that Carpentier constructs the immigrants in his novel as a "plague" while demonstrating that they were necessary to the "health" of the Cuban state, the immigration codes adopted by the Cuban government as a result of US influence simultaneously pathologized and criminalized the very workers who made the mate rial wealth of both nations possible. Archives of Folklore: Knowledge Production in Mach ado's Cuba In order to understand the transnational forces at work in the novel, I read it against the backdrop of not only the Pan American Conference on Eugenics, but also the Sixth International Conference of American States, held from January 16 to February 20,1928, which took place a month after the eugenics conference. The Conference of American States was a grand affair, attended by heads of state, diplomats, and celebrities from twenty-one nations, including then US President Calvin Coolidge, and Charles Lindberg (who received the "Order of Merit" as well as the key to the city of Havana, both presented to him in person by President Machado). Carpentier was certainly aware of and deeply influenced by the Conference of American States. The impending arrival of dignitaries and heads of state had, after all, been part of the reason that Machado cracked down on dissidents and arrested Carpentier and others. If he had been critical of Yankee imperialism before, then his incarceration</page><page sequence="10">Park 55 followed by the fawning welcome the US received at the Confer ence would have done nothing but bolster Carpentier's resentment of Yankee influence. Thus, iÉcue-Yamba-Ô! champions Afro Cuban culture in large part as a counterpoint to the ever-encroaching US culture on the island. In the chapter entitled "Polftica," Carpentier lays bare the symbolic weight that the novel's black characters are intended to carry. They, the "low-cost laborers," are lost in a world of "Yankee" cultural imperialism. Not only does the ingenio make the country's economy beholden to foreigners, but the Cués must also turn to imported food for their sustenance. Rather than grow their own food (on land that they no longer own) they are forced to "harvest" the grocery shelves: "they ate—when they ate—what could be harvested from horizontal rows that spread within the walls of the bodega: sardines fished in Newfoundland, apricots locked in cans with the name of a romantic novel" ("comian—cuando comian—lo que podia cosecharse en los surcos horizontales que fecundaban las paredes de la bodega: sardinas pescadas en Terranova, albaricoques encerrados en latas con nombre de novela romantica"; 117-18). The tragedy of imperialism becomes, at the Cués' grocery store, a farce of consumer goods: The Creole country folk still produced images of foreign fruit, now maturing in ads for soft drinks! Orange Crush was a tool of imperialism, like the memory of Roosevelt and the Lindbergh plane ... ! Only the blacks, Menegildo, Longina, Salomé, and their offspring jealously preserved an Antillean character and tradition. The bongo, antidote to Wall Street! The Holy Spirit, venerated by the Cués, did not allowed Yankee sausages within their votive buns ... ! None of these hot-dogs with the saints of Mayeya! (118) i La campina criolla producfa ya imagenes de frutas extran jeras, madurando en anuncios de refrescos! iEl orange crush se hacîa instrumento del imperialismo, como el recuerdo de Roosevelt o el avion de Lindbergh.. . ! Sölo los negros, Menegildo, Longina, Salomé y su prole conserva ban celosamente un carécter y una tradiciön antillana. i El bongô, antldoto de Wall Street! i El Espiritu Santo, venerado por los Cué, no admitia salchichas yanquis dentro de sus panecillos votivos. . . ! iNada de hot-dogs con los santos de Mayeya! (118) Exclamatory passages like this one, in which Afro Cuban culture ("el bongo") opposes the economic forces at work on the island ("Wall Street"), leave little doubt about Carpentier's attitude toward the</page><page sequence="11">56 Pan American Eugenics and Transnational Capital "Yankee." The passage also lashes out against Roosevelt, whose Rough Riders were still a "memory" in Cuba, and Lindberg, who had just completed his tour of Latin America in "The Spirit of St. Louis" before arriving in Havana in time for the 1928 Conference. Against these "tools of imperialism," Carpentier positions his black charac ters, who turn away from Yankee materialism and protect their own culture. The function of Afro Cuban culture in the novel is to offer an alternative to the logic of capitalism. It provides the black charac ters with a way of understanding themselves in relation to the world and a means of being reborn into a life that has not consigned them exclusively to the role of laborers. Rebirth, however, was also a policy of the Cuban state. Macha do's campaign of national regeneration, as he called it, required Afro Cuban labor in order to complete numerous public works projects dur ing his rule, including the 700-mile Central Highway that was Cuba's main thoroughfare as well as an exact replica of the US Capitol in the middle of Havana. The Machado administration also took a great inter est in promoting scientific development in tandem with the island's material development. Alejandra Bronfman has explored in detail the relationship between science and the Cuban state during this period. To demonstrate Machado's investment in intellectual projects, she quotes one of his speeches: "We must stimulate literary and scientific production . . . since we have received so much knowledge from the rest of the world, we must participate and reciprocate with our own contributions" (qtd. in Bronfman, Measures 109). These contributions centered on the anthropological study of Afro Cuban folk culture, which flourished during the 1920s as an effort to salvage Cuba's unique heritage and bring it into the fold of modernity. However, Bronfman argues that the initial goal of incorporating black Cubans into the regenerated nation as full citizens was eventually replaced by the goal of controlling and containing this population through the social sciences, namely criminology and eugenics. Perhaps the work of Fernando Ortiz is the best illustration of how these social projects of salvage and control could work in tandem. In 1923, Ortiz founded the journal Archivos del Folklore Cubano, an intellectual enterprise approved by the state, which had the declared goal of becoming, as Ortiz put it: "an organ for the collaboration and the exchange of new ideas between those in Cuba who like to scruti nize the past, to savor the fruits of popular knowledge and to browse the soul of our pueblo" ("Esta revista" 5). Archivos was a complicated mix of academic research and literary work. It featured detailed anthropological studies of Afro Cuban cultural practices, from music to ritual teeth-filing, as well as philological studies of vernacular. On the other hand, Archivos also published Nicolas Guillen's important</page><page sequence="12">Park 57 poem Motivos del son, though it added glosses by Fernando Ortiz in order to explain Guillén's use of the vernacular.8 But, it is Ortiz's own early work that demonstrates the slide toward criminalizing and pathologizing Afro Cuban culture. In 1926 Archivos began the serial publication of Ortiz's Los negros curros, which was described as a "study in criminal ethnography" and which extended the investigation of black criminality that he began in his 1906 work Hampa afrocubana: Los negros brujo. This fascination with the "Afro-Cuban underworld" is an aspect of Ortiz's work that is too often forgotten. Within the context of US-based American Studies, he is best known for his later work introducing the concept of "transculturation," which Mary Louise Pratt has extended.9 And within Cuban scholarship, Ortiz's legacy is also centered on his later work, which celebrated Afro Cuban culture and promoted the work of artists like Wifredo Lam. However, in the 1920s Ortiz was predominantly known for his work as a criminologist. It is important to recall these early works if we hope to fully grasp the cultural setting of iÉcue-Yamba-Ô! and to understand the complex intersection of science, prisons, and politics that Carpentier was engaging. The intense study of Afro Cubans during this period, even when their culture was claimed as part of a regenerative na tionalist project, demonstrates the foundational interest in correctly identifying and containing the variety of "delinquents" brought before the scientists' inspection. The ornate fashions that Ortiz describes in Los negros brujos are fascinating in and of themselves, but the value of such studies lies in the criminologist's ability to decode such cos tumes and correctly identify markers of the underworld's hierarchy. Likewise, philological studies, such as Ortiz's Glosario de afronegris mos, were also aimed at deciphering the cant of criminal organiza tion, thereby facilitating their detection and incarceration. All of these "studies" were manifestations of the positivist approach that Ortiz adopted from Italian criminologists of the time, most notably Cesar Lombroso, who wrote a preface for Los negros brujos. Lombroso's notorious emphasis on anthropometrics and studies of physiognomy helped to shift criminology in the early twentieth century from the study of the crime to the study of the criminal, who was biologically predetermined toward deviance. Ortiz's early works represent just this kind of anthropological criminology, offering photographs, in profile and head-on, of the brujos under examination and illuminating the telltale signs of black "delinquency." Carpentier was certainly aware of such studies of Afro Cuban culture. He made use of this archive of material in writing iÉcue Yamba-Ô!, and the illustrations within the novel made no secret of the author's efforts to engage and challenge the work of criminal anthropologists. It is in response to works like Ortiz's Glosario de</page><page sequence="13">58 Pan American Eugenics and Transnational Capital afronegrismos that Carpentier provides his own "Glossary" to the novel. In Carpentier's entry for nâhingo, he makes clear that he is engaging with the academics, but he also offers a corrective to these studies that attempts to understand the nâhingo apart from their association with criminality. He defines them thus: Secret associations of mutual protection, brought to Cuba by black slaves, and which still subsist, though transformed, in some of the island's populations. ... It has been said erroneously that the hâhingos practice witchcraft, and they have even been implicated in the perpetration of human sacrifices. But if one becomes better acquainted with them and can detach oneself from these magical practices, then sorcery, properly speaking, does not form part of the ritual. In their meetings, the hâhingos observe a picturesque and complicated ceremony, which includes songs, dances and percussions of great beauty. (203-04) Asociaciones sécrétas de protecciön mutual, traîdas a Cuba por los esclavos negros, y que subsisten aun, algo transformadas, en algunas poblaciones de la isla. ... Se ha dicho por error que los hâhingos practican la brujena, llegandoseles a imputer la perpetraciôn de sacrifices huma nos. Pero si bien sus afiliados pueden librarse aisladamente a practicas magicas, la hechiceria, propiamente dicha, no forma parte del ritual. En sus reuniones, los hâhingos ob servan un ceremonial pintoresco y complicado, que incluye cantos, danzas y percusiones de una gran belleza. (203-04) Focusing on the "picturesque and complicated" elements of the mu sic and dances, Carpentier reveals his aesthetic investment in the nâhingo rituals. In order to write about them, though, he inevitably made use of the academic studies that criminalized Afro Cuban cul ture, even as he was trying to write a corrective to those studies. The novel itself shows Carpentier coming to terms with this archive, which had informed his own understanding of Afro Cuban culture but, seen from the inside of a jail cell filled with practitioners of this picturesque culture, must have looked horribly flawed. The kinds of illustrations that appeared in Los negros brujos and Archivos del Folklore Cubano are closely mirrored in Carpentier's novel. For instance, Ortiz's illustration of Afro Cubans during slavery celebrating El dla de Reyes (figure 1) is matched by Carpentier's version (figure 2). Carpentier also captions these illustrations with excerpts from his own text, in this case adding : "But the blacks of the country ignored the splendor of the Celebration of Kings, which was</page><page sequence="14">Park 59 only celebrated in a dignified manner in the city" ("Pero las negra das del campo ignoraban los esplendores de la Fiesta de Reyes, que sölo se celebraba dignamente en las ciudades"; 92). By creating this tight interconnection between illustration and text, he furthers the illusion that iÉcue-Yamba-Ô! is a work of anthropology. In this case, his text seems to follow the same analytical line as Ortiz, creating a link between the legacy of slavery and the practices of modern Afro Cubans. It is in the book's photographs, however, that iÉcue-Yamba Ô! departs from the anthropologists. Again, the subject matter is strikingly similar, but the medium serves as a reminder that such academic studies had roots in criminology. Figura 12.

["El dîa de Reyes"], from Alejo Carpentier, iÉcue-Yamba-Ô! novela afrocubana (1933). These photos allude to the forensic practices of Cuban anthro pologists and the source of their material evidence—objects that police had seized during arrests. The photographs that Carpentier includes in iÉcue-Yamba-Ô! are closer to those that Cuban police would take as evidence than any image the criminal anthropologists would care to include in their works. In Ortiz, his claims about the intimate objects of Afro Cuban life are supported by a sanitized line drawing of an altar scene from the home of a "brujo" (figure 3). Meanwhile, Carpentier includes photographs of similar objects and captions them with explanatory comments that echo the fascination of criminal anthropologists (figure 4). Carpentier's presentation of these objects as photographs is ultimately a satirical gesture aimed at exposing the true sources of these "scientific" studies. Again in Ortiz's book, photographs do appear, but only in the form of booking photos of black men (figure 5). The objects of supposed brujeria that were taken from these men are represented in more benign, academic drawings that attempt to conceal the origins of these objects and present them as objects suited for the museum rather than the police station. On the other hand, the orishas in Carpentier's photo seem</page><page sequence="16">Park 61 to form their own police lineup, parodying the study of Afro Cuban men and women and emphasizing that the source of these cultural artifacts was the criminal justice system (figure 4).

As Stephan Palmié has argued in his studies of the criminaliza tion of Afro Cubans, when police and anthropologists approached these "ill-understood heaps of de-contextualized objects," the goal "was not to understand their meaning, but to create evidence of some thing which had no meaning" ("The Cuban Republic" 75).10 We can see further evidence of this process in some of the illustrations in Archivos del Folklore Cubano, especially in articles by Israel Castellanos, who had direct access to confiscated material as Director of the Labora tory of Penitentiary Anthropology. In an article on the "diabolito" (a figure in the nâhingo hierarchy), Castellanos includes an illustration of a diabolito costume and notes in the caption: "Model extent in the Criminological Museum of the University of Havana's Academy of Medicine" (figure 6). In iÉcue-Yamba-Ô!, Carpentier includes his own diabolito—a doll photographed by the police as though it too is being booked and jailed (figure 7). So, while the material construc tion of the novel places it in conversation with the academic studies of Afro Cuban culture of the time, Carpentier consistently undercuts</page><page sequence="18">Park 63 that work by insisting on the inseparable nature of anthropology and criminology in Cuba. By emphasizing the prison as the original archive for these academic studies, he offers an alternative anthropology of Cuban culture, one that assumes the perspective of the prison cell and scrutinizes the rest of society from behind bars.

"El Diablito se adelantô," fromiÉcue-Yamba-Ô! From the Measure of Industry to the Measure of Science: Inside Havana's Jail Perhaps the most frequently overlooked of Ortiz's works was the one most fully embraced by Machado's government: the Proyecto de côdigo criminal cubano, which Ortiz published in 1926. After years of studying Cuba's criminals and documenting their distinc tive traits, this book-length plan for reforming the prison system was the ultimate application of Ortiz's theories about criminology. It laid out in detail how various criminals should be punished based on their mental status and "responsibility"; it defined the conditions</page><page sequence="20">Park 65 of the new "modern" prisons; and, most importantly, the Proyecto introduced the idea of the "delinquent" into the lexicon of Cuban criminal justice. Again, building off of earlier anthropological studies, crime was not a product of social conditions, but quite the reverse: the biologically determined (and empirically observable) traits of the individual were what threatened public safety. Ortiz writes that delin quents are "dangerous persons," who "show by their external conduct, notoriously contrary to the good customs or laws of public security, a state of extraordinary mental, moral, or legal maladjustment that has created in them a proclivity toward delinquency and social fear" (Proyecto 14). Again, this "maladjustment" is located entirely within the individual under scrutiny, precluding any discussion of how the "good customs" of Machado's Cuba and its reliance on foreign capital might have produced and even necessitated "delinquency." In her essay on the Proyecto and its place within Ortiz's larger body of work, Bronfman points out that the book received wide recog nition and was endorsed by Machado's government. Ortiz distributed his book to fellow scholars and to newspaper editors, both in Cuba and abroad, who published favorable reviews. Thus, according to Bron fman, "the Proyecto was widely publicized" ("Poetry in the Presidio" 162). She quotes from a glowing letter addressed to Ortiz that makes clear the extent to which his views represented the mainstream of criminology as well as the regenerative aims of the state: "General Gerardo Machado y Morales, like you suffers the most intense, incur able, and beneficial fever in favor of the advancement, morality, and progress of the Republic. . . . Your Penal Code will be from now on in Cuba THE CODE OF MACHADO!!"11 The fascinating medical language of this letter, in which Ortiz and Machado share the same reformist disease, demonstrates how prevalent this biological rhetoric actually was among Cuban intellectuals. Everyone, from the dictator to the prisoner, was to have their symptoms diagnosed. As a consequence of Ortiz's Proyecto, Cuban prisons refocused their attention on the "external" criteria of the criminal. This positivist methodology was finally realized all across the island when Ortiz's recommendation for an "anthropological exam" (50) was implemented in all of Cuba's prisons. He states unequivocally in the Proyecto that "Each inmate will be submitted to an anthropological exam according to the conditions established in the Criminal Ordinances" (50-51). Behind this discrete sentence lies an entire system for measuring and studying Afro Cubans. Its simplicity conceals the countless scenes of horror and humiliation involved with conducting such exams. It is at the site of criminal examination that Carpentier most directly engages the academic discourse of his day and critiques the system that has reduced his characters to objects of study. In his</page><page sequence="21">66 Pan American Eugenics and Transnational Capital version of the exam, Carpentier offers us the humanizing details of these scientific practices. At the climax of iÉcue-Yamba-Ô!, Menegildo has been arrested for murder and brought to the city, where he finds himself in the Prado jail. By way of processing him into the carceral system, "he was subjected to an anthropometric exam. Each scar, each sore on his body was located without delay. His description, in feet and inches, cranial capacity and enumeration of decayed mo lars, were all plotted with astounding exactitude" ("se le sometiö al examen antropométrico. Cada cicatriz, cada matadura de su cuerpo fue localizada sin demora. Su retrato, en pies y pulgadas, capacidad craneana y enumeraciôn de muelas cariadas, quedô trazado con pasmosa exactitud"; 131). The similarity between Ortiz's language in the Proyecto ("estara sometido al examen antropolôgico") and Carpentier's language ("he was submitted to an anthropometric exam"; "se le sometiö al examen antropométrico") is striking. The important change that Carpentier makes, from "anthropological" to "anthropometric," signals the dubious nature of this inquiry, more intent on acquiring "measurements" than "knowledge." It may be that Carpentier differentiates this act of criminal anthropology from more affirming studies of Afro Cubans, among which he no doubt included his own novel. What is remarkable about Carpentier's portrayal of the exam is that he presents it from the perspective of the inmate. After Menegildo's body is scrutinized and measured, he is, astonishingly, flattered. Carpentier satirizes, though not without a certain pathos, the sense of importance Menegildo feels at having this much atten tion paid to him: In spite of his confusion, he began to wonder at the im portance granted to his person. Who until now—except Longina—had devoted even a moment of attention to him? It had never happened in his entire life as just one more black in the village. (131) A pesar de su desconcierto, comenzaba a admirarse de la importancia concedida a su persona. iQuién hasta ahora— excepto Longina—le habîa consagrado nunca un momento de atenciön? No habia pasado en toda su vida de ser un negro mas en el caserïo. (131) By narrating the anthropometric exam from the perspective of the subject, Carpentier highlights the inherently dehumanizing nature of contemporary scientific studies. Even though Menegildo's impulse to admire himself is naïve, he is right to ask—who has paid attention to him until now? While Menegildo is made visible to the Cuban state in</page><page sequence="22">Park 67 terms of measurements and profiles, no doubt to see whether he fits any of the criminal types, the exception that he provides—Longina— ends up being the vehicle for Carpentier's critique of eugenics and his parodie "antidote" to the sterile culture of "Wall Street" (114). In addition to the plotline that follows Menegildo's path into the Havana underworld, the novel also traces a reproductive plotline. Menegildo's sexual encounter with this Haitian immigrant is as crucial to his de velopment as the other "initiations" of the novel, and the child they produce, outside of marriage and the legal and medical surveillance that goes with it, flies in the face of contemporary eugenics and im migration laws. Before turning to this reproductive plotline, and the rest of the novel in detail, I first want to explore the importance of eugenics within the context of Carpentier's composition. Production and Reproduction in jÉcue-Yamba-Ô! Just weeks before its large and public conference at which Machado's government was toasted, the Pan American Union held a much quieter meeting in Havana. This was the First Pan American Conference on Eugenics and Homiculture of the American Republics. While a small proceeding, the Eugenics Conference was not a niche interest unrelated to the larger Pan American conference held after it. Rather, the effort to bring Latin America into the fold of US-defined modernity was contingent on such scientific endeavors. As Cuba's Secretary of State, Rafael Martinez Ortiz, declared when he welcomed the delegates on behalf of President Machado, the countries of the Americas needed to track individuals with "hereditary pathological defects" and curtail their migration as a crucial step in the economic advancement of the Hemisphere. He made clear that the work of regulating populations, which the delegates were setting out to do, was essential to the "material progress" of all nations (Transactions 206).12 While the US delegation was interested in extending its eugen ically-informed Immigration Act of 1924 beyond its own borders, both the US and Cuban delegations saw the link between the work of the eugenicists and the production of a viable workforce to sustain the economic systems of the Americas. The creation of this work force would require stricter immigration policies, but it would also necessitate that the states supervise procreation, applying what the delegates termed "marital prophylaxis" (311). As a member of the Cuban delegation, J. A. Lopez del Valle, put it in his closing remarks: with the appropriate application of Eugenics laws, we shall try to avoid improper unions between sick or vicious per</page><page sequence="23">68 Pan American Eugenics and Transnational Capital sons, who may generate children with pathological defects and who cannot develop their life in a satisfactory manner. We will insist that marriage parties bear the "vital capital" necessary for the adequate development of their children, with the object of avoiding the procreation of human beings who are biologically unfit, and therefore unfit for the enjoy ment of a healthy and strong life. (Transactions 311-12) In iÉcue-Yamba-Ô!, Carpentier's black characters have been reduced to their value as "vital capital" and it is only by circumventing the systems of production and reproduction into which they have been born that they assert their individuality. The union of Menegildo and Longina, two supposedly vicious individuals, becomes a defiant act in the face of such state regulation. As it becomes clear in Carpen tier's meditation on eugenicist discourse, any attack on transnational capitalism must recognize that the politics of material production are inseparable from the politics of reproduction. Menegildo's relationship with his Haitian lover, Longina, is at the core of the novel's critique of eugenics and the immigration policies that eugenic science had informed. Their union takes place outside the surveillance of the state, whose policy of "marital prophylaxis" would surely have prohibited two such "doubtful" individuals from reproducing. As such, the birth of their child has the potential to be an act of political defiance equal to the alternate epistemology of the "doctrine of the sun." However, the realities of Cuba's labor economy make this conclusion more complicated. At the end of the novel, Carpentier leaves us with an ambivalent triumph since it is unclear whether Menegildo and Longina's son will disrupt state order or merely become "just one more black" in the cane fields (131). Before he meets Longina, Menegildo is initially wary of even approaching the Haitian camp, full as it is of "esos negros inferiores." Walking past it, he is surprised by the silhouette of a woman ap proaching him, but he is even more surprised when she speaks to him "en cubano." He presumes that, as a Haitian, she would be unable to converse with him as an equal: "She should be of the earth, because hardly any Haitian woman succeeded in making herself understood with 'the patois of over there"' ("Debia ser de la tierra, porque casi ninguna haitiana lograba hacerse entender con "el patua ese de alla"; 73). His initial fears recapitulate the xenophobia underpinning the immigration and eugenics policies of the era. By having a black Cuban character label a black Haitian character inferior, Carpentier satirizes the way in which eugenicist discourse conflated race and nation. The relationship between Menegildo and Longina is therefore a direct refutation of the state apparatus set up to keep them apart. The</page><page sequence="24">Park 69 ability of these two characters to understand one another, to realize that Menegildo's "cubano" is not so different from Longina's "patois of over there," symbolizes the creation of an alternative transnational community to the one being formulated by scientists and statesmen. As the relationship between Menegildo and Longina progresses, the music and the "rhythms" of their lives are repeatedly measured against the hum of the ingenio. While its roar had silenced their first "encounter," the machinery gradually fades as their sexual relationship crescendos. When they first make love, the menacing hum becomes a kind of accompaniment to their own rhythms, as "the dull mur mur of the ingenio danced in a breeze that still smelled of dew" ("el rumor sordo del ingenio danzaba en una brisa que ya olfa a rocfo"; 90). However, the real triumph comes later when their union, and Longina's pregnancy, mute the hum of the ingenio: Longina's belly grew day in and day out. The marriage prospered. The memory of the Central San Lucio was being lost in veils of fog. . . . The ingenio remained mute. The clocks struck twelve. They listened to the confidences of the breeze and their bellies tightened. . . . (179) El vientre de Longina crecia de di'a en di'a. El matrimonio prosperaba. El recuerdo del Central San Lucio iba perdié ndose en cendales de bruma. ... El ingenio permaneda mudo. Los relojes teman doce horas. Se escuchaban las confidencias de la brisa y los vientres estaban apretados. . ..(179) Thus, it is the reproduction of Carpentier's Afro Cuban characters that serves to counter the material production of the ingenio, churning out tons of processed sugar for the US market and facilitating the incarceration of Cubans, both as prisoners in Machado's jails and as workers tied to the ingenio's clock. The tone of anti-imperialist victory, though, rings hollow. While the image of Longina's belly (vientre) growing is an optimistic one, suggesting that even after Menegildo's eventual death the Cués will live on, Carpentier's counterpoint is the family's clenched bellies as they anticipate hunger. The relentless churn of the ingenio has indeed been silenced, but the fate of these characters is so inextricably bound with the factory that if its pistons do not turn, then the characters will not eat. Even at the end of the novel, they are still victims of the labor economy, which produces everything for foreign markets and leaves them just enough to sur vive. It remains unclear how the life of Menegildo's son will be dif ferent from that of Menegildo, both growing up in the shadow of the ingenio. The reproductive plotline of the novel suggests resistance to</page><page sequence="25">70 Pan American Eugenics and Transnational Capital the discourse of eugenics, but its oppositional potential is ultimately disappointing. If we look at Menegildo's time in prison, though, we can see the one brief reprieve from transnational capitalism that Carpentier offers his characters. Modernity and Its Incarcerated Other: Carpentier's "antidote to Wall Street" As Carpentier wrote the first draft of his novel, it must have been evident that the "primitives" alongside him in prison had already been incorporated into modernity—that of Cuba's prison system. In his 1977 preface to iÉcue-Yamba-Ô!, Carpentier indicated that there was a "Surrealism" at work in the novel, but it was a Surrealism very much invested in the present moment. He described the scene of its composition: "Imprisoned by Machado's police in 1927, I wrote to circumvent the tedium of confinement in the prison which stood then at Prado No 1." Carpentier labels the location of this prison surreal ist since "the sinister building was installed on the beautiful avenue which was the preferred walking place for the Havana bourgeoisie of that time" (8). Although there may be similarities between Carpen tier's anthropological bent and those of European Surrealists whom he encountered while living and working in Paris, iÉcue-Yamba-Ô! is more directly invested in the injustices of Machado's Cuba and the US wealth that backed up the regime and made possible the close proximity of prisons and "bellas avenidas." We might think of this as a kind of Havana Surrealism that Carpentier presents us with, whereby modernity and its barbaric underside are continually present on the same city street. This biographical encounter with Havana's juxtaposition of prisoners and bourgeoisie will be echoed in Carpen tier's novel, in which the close proximity of hâningo prisoners and North American tourists brings together the author's concerns with the policing of the Afro Cuban body and the transnational forces (like the Pan American conferences) behind their containment. Once in prison, Menegildo encounters an entirely different world in which he achieves a new autonomy and ultimately inverts the poli tics of surveillance that have dominated the novel thus far. After the anthropometric exam has made him visible to the state, his initiation into the haningo underworld makes him socially visible, so that the jail paradoxically serves as an alternative space where Carpentier offers a vision of social constructions that resist Machado-era surveil lance. The prison world that Carpentier presents in iÉcue-Yamba-Ô! is, oddly enough, one of carnivalesque liberation in which Menegildo, 1) finds a new language and a reprieve from economic production</page><page sequence="26">Park 71 of driving Cuba; and 2) inverts the power dynamics of anthropology by turning his scrutinizing gaze back on white society. In the three chapters entitled "Rejas A," "Rejas B," and "Rejas C," or "Bars," Menegildo is introduced to the underworld run by the nâningo, who create their own alternate language and alternate economy both of which evade the gaze of mainstream Cuban society. When he first enters the cell, Menegildo is reassured by Güititio, the "president" of the nâningo, "You'll soon get used to the jail, the jail was made for men!" ("Hay que accotumbralse a la carsel, que la carsel se jizo pa los hombresl"; 131). Indeed, it was made fora certain kind of men, who, thrust under the wheels of Machado's forward-moving society, created an alternative world that reflects all too accurately the world outside the jail. In this polyglot and multinational jail cell, there were "Creoles . . . mulattos . . . French . . . Poles . . . [all of whom] lived under the domination of a few strong men, Radamés and the Chinese Hoang-Wo who presided over the trust of nations" ("criollas . . . pardas . . . francesas . . . polacas . . . [todos los cuales] vivfan bajo dominaciön de unos cuantos varones fuertes, Radamés y el chino Hoang-Wo presidian el trust de los nacionales"; 137). While Havana's jails were certainly a place where all sorts of non-whites could meet, Carpentier's creation of a "trust of nations" is a timely parody of the international conferences going on outside the prison. The composition of the prisoners opens up the seemingly local is sue of how Afro Cubans were policed and studied in Havana to the larger conversation about the ways in which race operated within the hemisphere. The fact that all these prisoners are presided over by "the Chinese Hoang-Wo" signals a clear inversion of the racial hierarchies enforced by the immigration laws of the Americas. In the nâningo prison community, then, Carpentier offers an alternative vision of transnational cooperation to the one being articulated by the Pan American Union. The principal attribute of the nâningo is their cant, developed as a mix of Afro Cuban vernacular and physical gestures called the "Chinese Charade." This system of communication, designed to elude the surveillance of police and prison guards, makes use of the riddles and codes that Chinese Cubans had used to run Havana's underground lottery. The very target of immigration restrictions, the Chinese criminal, is thus reframed as a useful figure that provides an alternative to the transnational economy. Carpentier demonstrates his claim that "the inventors of the Chinese Charade had needed only 36 figures to summarize the essential activities and desires of man" ("los inventores de la Charada China sölo habian necesitado 36 figuras para resumir las actividades y los anhelos esenciales del hombre"; 137) by providing the most curious illustration in the book (figure 8). The</page><page sequence="27">72 Pan American Eugenics and Transnational Capital body of this Asian man is covered with a confusing array of symbols— from the horse that rides across his head to the snake that crawls down his ankle—each of which is paired with numbers and Chinese characters. Presumably, these parts of the body would be touched in a certain sequence to relay a message to someone conversant in "the verses" of the Charade. However, if we place this diagram of the body alongside the discourse that contemporary criminologists and eugenics were producing around the body of inmates, the illustration takes on greater significance for the novel. Just as the body of the immigrant had been inscribed by the state with labels like "doubtful" and "bad," this figure suggests an alternative inscription by which that same body is used to create meaning indecipherable to the state. Carpentier thus refashions the archive of anthropometric data to suit his own anti-imperialist project in the novel. ...

"Diagram of the Charada China", from iÉcue-Yamba-Ô!</page><page sequence="28">Park 73 Carpentier makes clear the social inversions of his prison when he depicts his characters looking through the bars at the outside world. Driving home the kind of surrealism that Carpentier found in the juxtaposition of Havana's jails with its "bellas avenidas," the prisoners look out from their cells into an adjacent hotel room, fully lit. There, they find a blond North American woman undressing: The prisoners got up in a tumult, going to frame their faces between the bars in order to contemplate the interior of the lighted room. Separated from them by but a few meters of air redolent with asphalt, a blond woman, Ameri can without a doubt, was slowly stripping her lace bodice. Her hands, going to reunite with one another between her shoulder blades, made her arms into an arabesque of wings. Later, with a gesture that seemed to be launched from her hips, the woman began to escape from a wide girdle, which two fingers threw to the floor. She closed the wardrobe, and the mirror, positioned at a new angle, revealed the presence of a man, lying down and reading a newspaper. The blond, nude, came over to his side, with a sudden shock to the bed frame. Fifty anxious looks converged on the thigh that was being lightly scratched by a thumb. A breast rubbed several times against the elbow of the man without him abandoning the printed page. Disarmament conference? Cooperativism? The woman's fingers traced pantomimes that didn't have the least result. She then returned to a mound of caramels that rested on the little night table. In chorus the prisoners howled "Take her... ! Pig ... ! What are you waiting for... !" (143-44) Los presos se levantaron tumultuosamente, yendo a enmarcar los rostros entre las rajas para contemplar el interior de una habitation illuminada. Separada de ellos por unos cuantos métros de aire oliente a asfalto, una mujer rubia, americana sin duda, se iba despojando lentamente de su ajustador encajes. Sus manos, yendo a reunirse entre los omoplatos, daban a sus brazos arabesco de alas. Luego, con gesto de quien pretendiera deshacerse de sus caderas, la mujer comenzô a evadirse de una ancha faja, que dos dedos tiraban hacia el suelo. Cerro el armario, y el espejo, colocado en un ângulo nuevo, revelö la presencia de un hombre acostado, que lefa un periôdico. La rubia, desnuda, se instalö a su lado, con brusco sobresalto del bastidor. Cincuenta miradas ansiosas convergian hacia el</page><page sequence="29">74 Pan American Eugenics and Transnational Capital muslo que un pulgar rascaba levemente. Un seno rozo varias veces el codo del hombre sin que éste abandonara la hoja impresa. &lt;LConferencia del desarma ? iCoopera tivismo ? Los dedos de la mujer esbozaron mimos que no dieron el menor resultado. Se volvieron entonces hacia un porno de caramelos que descansaba en la mesita de noche. En coro los presos aullaron : "Aprovecha ... ! Verraco ... I Qué esperas . . . !" (143-44) Though behind bars, these prisoners are able to see and study the most intimate details of this white, North American couple. Their voyeuristic appetites are certainly fed by the blond woman as she undresses, removing the artifice of her girdle and bodice. From their perspective, this woman, her arms shaped into an "arabesque of wings," is no less exotic than the hyper-sexualized images of black women continually consumed by tourists and scientists alike. It is from this alternative space, which Carpentier has constructed within the prison, that the power relationships of anthropology in Cuba are finally inverted. As engrossed as they are in looking at the American woman dis robing before them, the prisoners also take note of the languid man, buried in his "printed page." Looking from the prisoners' perspective, Carpentier offers a stale and flaccid image of white society, immersed in its conferences and its Wall Street economies but ignorant of the sexualized "rhythms" in which Menegildo is fluent. When the American woman's sexual advances are not returned by her male companion, she retreats to her "mound of caramels," a product of the sugar in dustry and of Afro Cuban labor, in order to satisfy her needs. As she consumes the material goods that many of the prisoners across the way have produced, the realities of transnational capitalism become eminently clear. North American luxury is possible only because the workers of Cuba live under a police state. Likewise, money and sugar circulate freely because the more "doubtful" members of the Hemisphere are restricted in their movements. Beyond the taunting and howling of the prisoners, Carpentier has made the very serious suggestion that the worlds inside and outside of the prison are in terdependent—it is no coincidence that in Havana one finds the jail so close to the "bellas avenidas." The image of the North American woman lying in her hotel room, consuming the Cuban caramels, returns us to the beginning of the novel, where the "diabetic giant" that is the sugar industry consumes both sugar and human labor. Such anti-imperialist and anti-capitalist moments place iÉcue-Yamba-Ô! within a history of</page><page sequence="30">Park 75 Latin American writing that opposed the "Colossus of the North." We need only think of the works of Ruben Dario or Carpentier's Cu ban contemporary, Nicolas Guillén, to see that Carpentier's politics were shared by others. What makes his first novel unique, though, is his engagement with the academic discourse that made such im perialism possible. By incorporating the discourses of anthropology, criminology, and eugenics into iÉcue-Yamba-Ô!, Carpentier makes clear that by the 1920s and 1930s US hegemony in the Americas was very much an empire of knowledge production. As we have seen at the Pan American conferences of the time, the Utopian rhetoric of transnational cooperation often masked these pursuits to study and contain Latin America by amassing an archive of information about the region. Carpentier, however, incorporates this archive into his novel and deploys it for his own anti-imperialist ends. The way in which he engages the discourse of the eugenics movement and reframes that discourse presents Afro Cuban culture as an alternative vision of transnational community, one that counters the discourse of the Pan American Union. Notes 1. Gonzalez Echevarria's Ale jo Carpentier: The Pilgrim at Home is still the definitive English-language study of Carpentier's work, and it is one of the few critical studies to have devoted significant attention to iÉcue-Yamba-Ô! (see 34-96). While Gonzalez Echevarria's read ing of the novel is centered on its relation to Spengler's Decline of the West, the insightful connection he makes between Carpentier and the work of Fernando Ortiz has been the inspiration of my own study. 2. The fact that an English translation of iEcue-Yamba-O! still does not exist merits some reflection, especially since Carpentier's other works have been available in English for so long. Knopf was an early promoter of Carpentier's novels in the 1950s and his work continues to be easily available to readers of English through the University of Minnesota's reissuing of many of his works in 2001.One possible explanation for this is that iÉcue-Yamba-Ô! does not lend itself easily to translation since the original Spanish text makes extensive use of hâhingo cant and Afro Cuban vernacular. However, these obstacles did not prevent Gallimard from publishing a French translation in 1988. I am more inclined to think that there has been little eagerness to translate iÉcue-Yamba-Ô! into English because it does not fit easily into Anglophone readers' understanding of Carpentier's work. iÉcue Yamba-Ô! disrupts the idea of Carpentier the magical realist, an identity that has been constructed around his later works, especially Los pasos perdidos (1953) and El siglo de las luces (1962). Perhaps Francophone readers, who did not experience the same aggressive</page><page sequence="31">76 Pan American Eugenics and Transnational Capital marketing of Boom literature during the 1960s and 1970s as did Anglophone readers, are less invested in this version of Carpentier as a practitioner of magical realism. 3. Anke Berkenmaier's recent book is the most exhaustive study of Carpentier's relationship with Surrealism. For her discussion of iÉcue Yamba-Ô! in particular, see 53-79. 4. Although iEcue-Yamba-O! is the only example of an Afro Cuban novel, at the time the Cuban popular imagination was fascinated with the African elements within the island's culture. In addition to celebrating the achievements of Afro Cuban poet Nicolas Guillén, this negrismo movement also manifested itself in the music and popular culture of the day. See Moore, Nationalizing Blackness. 5. Composed in 1927, the novel was originally published as iÉcue Yamba-Ô! novela afrocubana. Citations from the novel, as well as Carpentier's 1977 preface, refer to the 2002 edition by Alianza Edito rial. Throughout this essay, I provide my own translation followed by the Spanish text of the 2002 edition, from which I have translated; for citations from the preface I will simply provide my English trans lations. 6. For an account of Machado's political rise and fall, see Luis E. Aguilar's Cuba 1933: Prologue to Revolution, especially 55-67. 7. For this translation of the manifesto as well as a discussion of the Minorista Group in Cuba see Martinez, "Social and Political Com mentary in Cuban Modernist Painting of the 1930s." 8. For a survey of eugenics in Latin America as well as a discussion of the Pan American Eugenics Conference, see Nancy Stepan's definitive study, "The Hour of Eugenics": Race, Gender, and Nation in Latin America. 9. While Guillén's poem had already been published, this reprint treats the text more like an anthropological specimen than the avant-garde poem that it was. In his introduction to the poem, Ortiz suggests that Guillén's work is so enmeshed with folk music that "soon these verses will pass into the popular repertoire and it might be forgotten who the author was" (Guillén 222). 10. As Pratt notes, Ortiz's use of this term appears in his 1940 study, Cuban Counterpoint: Tobacco and Sugar (97-103). She explains transculturation as follows: "Ortiz proposed the term to replace the paired concepts of acculturation and deculturation that described the transference of culture in reductive fashion imagined from within the interests of the metropolis" (Pratt, 228n4). Pratt and a generation of scholars found this term useful in their own work and one con sequence of this has been that Fernando Ortiz is now synonymous with transculturation. This is, however, but one part of Ortiz's body of thought, what we might call late Ortiz. As with Carpentier (see Note 1 above), Ortiz's work is perceived very differently by Anglophone readers who are less likely to be familiar with his decades of work as a criminologist.</page><page sequence="32">Park 77 11. Stephan Palmié's large body of work is indispensible to an under standing of Afro-Cuban religious practices and their relationship to the state. In addition to this article, see his book-length study, Wizards arid Scientists. 12. Letter from Ramiro Cabrera, October 16, 1926, Biblioteca Nacional José Marti. Quoted and translated in Bronfman, "Poetry in the Pre sidio," 162-63. 13. The minutes of the Eugenics conferences were published in a bilingual edition, yet the English half of the volume is filled with translation errors. In my quotations I have used the English half of the volume, relying on the Spanish text to correct obvious mistakes. Works Cited Aguilar, Luis E. Cuba 1933: Prologue to Revolution.
