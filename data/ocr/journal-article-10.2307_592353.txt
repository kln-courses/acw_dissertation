<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARTTGLE IV. CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE INTERPRETATION OF THE VEXA.* BY MAURICE BLOOMFIELDX PROFESSOR IN JORNS HOPEINS UNIBESITY, BALTIMORE, MD. Presented to the Society May 5th, 1891. I. THE STORY OF INDRA AND NAMUEL IN the explanation of the legend of Indra and Namuci, the first requisite seems to me to be to deal with the materials which the Vedic writings offer us as a story, an ztihasa or akAyana, which is, so to speak, their face-value. There is, so far as my knowl- edge of the Vedic passages bearing upon our subject is concerned, nothing which justifies the interpreter in looking for anthropo- morphic motives at the bottom of it; if these ever existed, they have vanished from record. Why should they, indeed, have ex- isted? Indla, the Hercules, the demiurge of the Vedic texts, encounters, in a manner to be explained below, a demon, an a.sura, named Namuci, and deals with him according to the fatlcy of the story-teller in this case a vely vivid fancy. Indra is, to be sure, very largely a storm-god, who attacks the clouds and other natural phenomena, personifiecl as demons, but he is also the heroic person Indla, and ill his latter calea(3ity the very one to become embroilefl with all sorts of unc.anny beings, suth as irlhab- itd the fanev ot the Vedic people.

XV. 19</page><page sequence="2">Sl. B/oornfeGd!, 144 divides the word, and Adalbert Kuhn (in KZ. viii. 80), in accord- ance with the method of the time, interprets Namuci as the cloud- demon who does not let go the waters. Fick (in Orient tbnd Occident, iii. 126) even goes so far as to regard Namuci as a proeth- nic mythological figure, and connects the word with Gr. 'A,uv%057 the son of Neptune and king of the Bebrvees (Ap. Rh. 2. 48), who was slain by Pollux ('A,uvxospovos, Opp. Cym. 1. 363). What is more important, this etymology of the name peeps out in the treatment of the legend at TB. i. 7. 1. 6, where it is narrated that Namuci would not let go (root srj) Indra unless he entered into a certain agreement with him: cf. Sayana at RV. viii. 14. 3. For us this means for the present nothing more than that we are in the- midst of story-telling about Indra and the demon ' Don't-let-go ' or ' Hold-fast.' The second requisite consists in giving up the belief that the allusions to the story which may be gathered from the soattered mantras are the only true material for its reconstruction. I would by all means place myself upon the ground that the legends of the Brahman. as which deal with Namuci, as well as the manipulations of the same in- the Sutras, are based upon essen- tially the same conceptions as the mantras. With the difference, however, that the looseness in the handling of a story which is an unfailing adjunct as it passes from mouth to mouth receives an additional impulse in the direction of liberality of treatment, owing to its application to practical matters, to sacrifice and to witcheraft. To separate these more individual ad hoc touches in the story from those which represent, so to say, its ethnic form and development represents a critical process for which no rule or set of rules can be devised. A species of instinctive judgment, or, perhaps better, tact, which is certain to develop in the illvesti- gat;or with the continuous handling of such materials, will be the safest guide in this mode of criticism; the proper attitude is, on the one hand, neither implicit faith in every detail of the con- nected legends and in every highly symbolic employment of the legend in ritualistic practice; on the other hand, a growing faith in the synchronism of mantra, brahrnana, and sutra. As far as the first two are concerned, the writer is more and more inclined to the belief that qnantra and brahnzana are for the least part chronological distinctions; that they represent two modes of lit- erary activity, and two modes of literary speech, which are largely contemporaneous, the mantras being the earliest lyric and the Brahmanas the earliest epic-didactic manifestation of the same cycle of thought. Both forms existed together, for aught we know, from earliest times; only the redaction of the mantra-col- lections in their present arrangement seems on the whole to have preceded the redaction of the Brahmanas. At any rate, I am for my part incapable of believing that even a single Vedic hymn was ever composed without reference to ritual application, and without that environment of legendary report which we find in a no doubt exaggerated and distended form in the Brahmanas and Sutras.</page><page sequence="3">the Story otf Indra and La6mqbe?&gt;. 145 The hymns of the Rig-Veda, like those of the other three Vedas} were liturgical from the very start. This means that they form only a fragment of a system of religious conceptions; practices, legends, and, no doubt, in a measure theological or theosophical speculation, surrounded the hymns from the start; a knowledge of these is essential to their interpretation, and our only means of obtaining this krlowledge is to reduce the hypertrophied body of the Brahmanas, Sutras, and Upanisads to a proper form and size, by discounting liberally the tendency towards phantastic and untrammeled development which has somehow fastened itself u)on every mode of Hindu thought of which we have any record. The same freedom from prejudice for or against the commenta- tors of Vedic texts and texts belonging to the classical literature may surely now be regarded as the true method. The old battle on the value of the so-called tradition I regard as definitely at an end. There are now no reputable Vellic scholars who wollld be willing to follow the " Sayallas " through thick and thin; there are, on the other hand (if there ever were any), none who would deny that late texts and commentaries may contain the correct explanation, or the key to the correct explanation, of difficult Vedic passages. But there is still irt existence an unwholesome tendency towards a purely esoteric interpretation of the rnsuntras, a reliance upon the fac?sltas se tpsam tnterpretandi, withollt an attempt to search painstakingly and exhaustingly their native interpretation and application. So the key to the hymn AV. ii. 27 and the exp]anation of the Vedic words pra,p, pr&lt;ttzprcsp and prsstzprcspita was found by the writer in the hands of the commentator Dari]a: see P. A. O. S. for May, 1885 (Journal, vol. xiii., p. xlii, and "Seven Hymns of the AV.," American Jo?rnat of Phitoho,qy, vii. 479 ffX, 14 of the reprint).* Similarly the Vedic word ctpctcit, which was tratlslated erroneously by many scholars, was understood colrectly by the medical lpastras as reported by Wise in his Digest of Hindu Med- icine: see the author in " Contributions to the Interpretation of the Veda," second series, Am. Journ. Phil. xi. 326 (p. 8 of the reprint). On the other hand, it is equally erroneous to deny-as some now tend to do- that time and distance obscure the view, and to assert that the post-Vedic literature has in general pre served an unchanged picture of Indian life and thought. We may liken the separate features of A7edzc life to streams which start to traverse the long distance from the Vedic head-spring to modern times. Some are lost in the sand on the way. Others flow on becoming more and more muddy and sluggtsh as they advance. Still others have preserved throughout their long journey their * In this connection I take the liberty of drawing the attention of the editors of the Zettschreftfqir vergteichende Sprachforschung to the fact that the word prattprag treated by I. N. Reuter at vol. xxxi. 229 owes its explanation to the papers just quoted: this is duly noted by Boht- lingk in his lexicon, s?b voce.</page><page sequence="4">146 S1/. BlSootnNel,d, limpid clearness. Who shall say beforehand what is to be the fate of any of them ? Thus, on the one hand, we fully acknowledge that the various literary types subsequent to the rnantras can be employed #UC- cessfully only with gleat caution and a still greater fund of what we designated above as tact, rather than judgment based upon schematic principles; on the other hand, we cannot emphasize too much the imperative need of search for help in all kinds of later literature. Only it must be tempered by such considera- tions as those which have been advanced here; the later the evi- dence, the more cautions must be its application to a Vedic passage. Our treatment of -the legend will, it is hoped, offer various illustrations of the manner in which the interpretation of the tnasleras is benefited by the remaining literature :- Brah- manas, Sutras, cotnmentaries, and classical legends. The story of Namuci m;ly be best treated in five chapters: 1. The battle between Indra and N;+muci, atld the subsequent com- pact. 2. Namuci gets Indra drurlk with sura, and robs him of strength, enjoyment of life, and the Soma. 3. Indra, with the aid of the A§vins and Sarasvatl, circumvents the compact and revenges hirnself on Namuci. 4. The A§vins and Sarasvat bring back the Soma from Namuci. 5. Minor points in the story. 1.

As clearly as this evidence places Namuci in the position of a</page><page sequence="5">The Sztory of Indra and UVamqlez. 147 natural enemy of Indra, ultimately to be slain by him, there is on the other hand conclusive proof that for some reason or other a friendly agreement, in the nature of an alliance, truce, or com- pact, existed between the two prior to their final falling-out. This is stated roundly at 5JB. xii. 7. l. 10: namuciqaai 'va "surena cacc-tra '(Indra) went with the asura Namuci.' Mahldhara at YS. x. 34 says: nan-uctr nama 'sura tndrasya sakha "sst 'an Asurs, named Namuci, was a friend of Indra'; so also Ml3h. ix. 2434: tene (SG. namucina) 'stdrah sakAyam akarot ' Indra made friends with Namuci'; and 2435, whele Namllci is addressed by Indra as asuraprestha sakhe. At PB. xii. 6. 8 tllis relation ap- pears as a compact: Indra and Namuci afflree not to slay one another either by day or by night, with nothing either wet or dry: tndrap ca namucip ca 'suraX7&gt; sam adadha,tcam na necu nak- tarza na diSe/, hanan(!) na "rdrena na pbske)we 'tz. At gB. sii. 7. 3. 1 Indra tells the Agvins and Sarasvatl that he had sworn to .Namuci that he would not slay him by day or by night, with a staff or a bow, with the flat hand or with the fist, with anythint wet or dry: gepazzo 'smi naqr^?6caye na tvez diva, eza naktsxxn hanani na slandena nct dhanvnana, zacb P}thena eza qsaustista na puskena ncz "rdrewba. The same compact is stated at AIS iv. 3. 4, and here we have fol the first time a motive assigned for this unhol.y alliance: indro VCbi nanztzeirn na 'Ibzbhata sa r(.lSmtn Dttta- yarn k.rtva "rohad amuret adityarn tasn V(b anvaR-zasdtrsbyata sa- kh&lt;.zya asave 'ti so 'brav bn na 'ham hanisy(xm ^ 'ti so 'bravtt samdhetrn te samdadhai yatha tvez na div-z hqedni na naktrn na puskena ncz "rdrene 'ti 'Indra did IlOt seize Natnuci. I-Ie (Nalnuci), making the rays (of the sun) into a net-work, aseended to yonder sun. He (Namuci) adflressed him ( Itldra), saying: " let us two be friends." He (Indra) said: " I shall not slay (you)." He said (further): "I will make an :wgreelllent with you not to slay rou either bv day or by night, with any thing either dry or wet."

Sayana in his commentary on P8. xii. 6. 6 quotes this passage from the TB., and reads vacah for tva 'vah. But the text of the Bibl. Ind. is by no means trustworthy.</page><page sequence="6">iJ{. B7Coomfi;eldX 148 hanah na diva na naktam itz. The same motive is assigned even more clearly by Sayana at RV. viii. 14. 13: pura k?&gt;le 'ndro 'suran jstvfi^ narnuctm asuram grahttqzq;z nc6 papaka: sa ca yudh- yamanas teficl 'surenajagrhe, sa ca grhttarrb ?&gt;ndram evam avocat tvam visrjami ratq av ahni ca puskena "rdrena ca "yudhena yadi mam nza htnstr oit?&gt;.

The belief has been expressed aboure that this motiere has some relation to the supposed etymology of the name namuc. The commentator at TB. i. 7. 1. 6, 7 cited byLudwig, Rig- Veda v. 145g* expresses with especial vividness the notion of ' holding close ' or ' not letting go ' which the name sllggests: ' as one wrestler, when fighting, puts forth his might, and, embracing, seizes the opposing wrestler with his hands, thus then Indra and Namuci, intent upon destroying one another, having closed with their hands and their feet, grasping one another firmly, fell upon the earth like a pair of wrestlers. (Namuci) turned out mole successful (abAi-puna- tara), i. e. stronger round about (abAitah) in his hands and feet. And he said: "I am sorry to have Indra die." ' . ' le mantrols report nothing of this preliminary contest between Indra and Namuci, nor of the compact resulting from it. But an allusion to the subsequent companionship of the pair may be gathered with a great degree of probability from the verse RV. x. 131. 5 _ AV. xx. 12a. 5; VS. x. 34; xx. 77; MS. iii. 11. 4; iv. la. 5; TB. i. 4. 2. 1; AgS. iii. 9. 3. The discussion of this stanza leads to the second chapter of the story, which may be entitled: 2. Xam?bcs yets Indra drunk wsth surc^, and robs hirn of strength, enjoyment of liSfe, and the soma. The stanza in question reads: pqhtrar&gt;z iva jpitdrc6v apvbno 'bAe 'ndra "vathuh kavyatr dansa- nc6bhth. yat suramam vy dpghah pdexvbAih sciraseatz t?oa magA^ab vann abAisnakt 'as parents a child, so did both Avvins, O Indra, help you with their magical wonders; when?

This stanza is preceded in the Sam- hitas etc. (RV.x.131.4AV.xx.125.4; VS.x.33; xx.76; MS. ibid.; TB. ibid.; AtJS. ibid.; Vait. 30. 12) by the verse * y?seam suraXmam aprina narnucav asure saca: vzptpanG6 pubhas pat?&gt; Z?bdram kdrrnstsv avagam 'you two AMvins, driIlking vour- * In the Bibl.

The pada-text of the RV. does not divide the word ;t neither does the VS. Prati- gakhya (see Ind. Stq4d. iv. 306). They were, indeed, in doubt as to its meaning. Mahldhara at VS. x. 33, 34 glosses it by susth?z ramayat?, .... s?l,sthu ramansyam; at sx. 76 by suramayam graham. Madhava at TB. i. 4. 2. 1 defiles it by s?l,rayG6 sampaditam imam patrastham dravya?nipesanx (text dravyaSesam), and suraya sanxpaditam imam rasav?&gt;esam.l Sayana at RV. x. 131. 4, 5 has susthu raman,asddhanam idaxn havir (st. 4) and szkhena rama- nasadhan,aym (st. 5). Both stanzas play an important part in the saactrantanz-ceremony, as will be seen below; the explana- tion Ole surasna is complicated further by thei employment in the same rite of certain praisas which contain the stem sqxra- man. Thus, VS. xxi. 42; kIS. iii. 11. 4 (p. 145): hota yaksad aSvtnG6u sarasvGtt?&gt;m sndram sutramanam ime se5mah s?l,rama- napll ehc6gczir 4 ?nesr rsabha'^h sutah, etc. Here again Ma- hldhara glosses surd mcznah with susth?s rama6yanti . . . . . ransan&gt;s,ydh. At A(7S. iii. 9. 3 a simiiar prczi.suz is inserted be- tween RV. x. 131. 4 and x. 131. 5: mGsrtiayitud yuve6an s?l,ecznsam a f v gne 'ti grahand rn puronuv&lt;zkycz, hotcz yaksad aSv incz saraseatz 'nd,rari- settramananb sontanam surctmnczm jusantcsn v?yantu pi- vanttb enadantqh somczn surczmno hotar ya,je 'ti praasah, putrarn iva pitarcsr apuino 'bAe 'ti yapya: cf. also 5JgS. xv. 15. 8-19; KgS. xix. 6. 20 and 23.

And yet the entire tra- dition of the stanzas exhibits it in close juxtaposition with stanza 5. The Yajus-salnhitas and the frauta-ritual point to the fact that the two stanzas are inseparable; what is perhaps rnore important, the two verses are part of the same story. 23ilnilarly the especially pithy verse RV. viii. 91. 21 is treated by Gkasslnann at i. 567, although it is found in close connection with verse 22 at VS. xi. 734; TS. iv. t. 10. 1 * MS. ii. 7. 7; and above all is fixed in its place by the ritual tradition, e. g. K(7S. xvi. 4. 38-9. The clearer it becomes that the primary purpose of the mantra-collections +ras their use in connection with religious practice# as prayers accompanying the acts, the less ground will there be for such ingeniou8 but subJective criticism. t In Max Muller's editions of the padapatha of the RV. surtmam in stanza 5 is written with avagraha, su-rcinam, and Aufrecht in his second edition quotes the undivided form of the word only in the fourth stanza. In a MS. of the padaptha belonging to Roth, however, surd- mam is left undivided in both stanzas? 4 and 5 * see KZ. xxiii. 476. § Madhava, ibid., states explicitly that sura was employed with the recitation of these two stanzas: atha mantradvayena suraya 'numan- tranam(!). Cf. also K(:S. xix. 6. 20. IlAt TB. ii. 6. 12. lt} the same jpraisc4 occurs? with the variant sutrd- manah for suramanah.</page><page sequence="8">150 Jl. Bloorn,;/ieZd, two Petersburg Lexicons translate the word From the juxta- position of suraman with surama in the books of the Yajur-Veda we are constrained to aonclude further that the authors of the praisas quoted above in some way conceived of surama also as 'delightful'-in other words, that surama was either misunder- stood by the authors or diaskeuasts of the Yajus-works, or that they exerted themselves greatly for the sake of the pun I incline to the latter view, because the stanzas containing the word are employed intelligently at Vait. 30. 11, as will be shown imme- diately beloxv. The translation of surama by 'sura-sickness,' or snausea due to the consequences of sura-drinking,' was first suggested by Roth, as cited l)y Garbe at KZ. xxiii. 476 ;* and the latter scholar (ibid. 526) showed that this interpretation of the word was implied at Vait. 30. 11, where the two stanzas containing the word suranza are employed in connection with a graha taken by a somatiputa or somarcomin 'one who has taken soma to excess.'t This one is very properly ordered to take a graha of surd mixed with milk, not of sura sstraight": yuvam suramarn sti catasrbAih (AV. ss. 125. 4-7) payahsuragraha.nam, na sauranarn. In fact, the employment of the sautramanz-ceremony as the expiatory performance of one who 'vomits the soma through his mouth or the other openings of the body' (Mahldhara in the introduction to VS. xix. ], and in h;s commentary on wix. 3: see R(pS. xis. 1. 2; Vait 30. 1-; cf. Webel, Irud. b'tud. x. 349), and the use of the sautramant-ceremon7 after soma-sacrifices (e. g. KB. xvi. lO), are no doubt founded upon thcse two mantras (guvam srai&gt;marn and putrdrn ?&gt;va p?&gt;tfhrau), which narrate the excessive drinking ex- ploits of Indra and the A§vins.: Conversely, the pre3minent r81e which the st4ra plays in the satztramant (see, in addition to the last citations V$. xix. a, 7, 14, 33^ 84; LgS. v. 4. l 1; Ind. Stud. x. 349) renders it likely that surama also contains this word.

I would render: 'By means of s?bra the Asura Namuci robbed Illdra of his strength the taste of his food, and the enjoyment of fiis soma.' In other words, Namuci got Indra drunk by giving him a drink to which he was not accustomed. As the lesult of this, IndIa came into a state which may be summed up in the German word katzenjamXmer. No better descriptiotl of this deplorable condi- tion could be presented in Sanskrit words.* And these qualities which Indra has lost are conceived as having been robbed from him by Namuci for his own benefit No wonder that Indra re- sorted to the Agsins the heavenly physicians, and to Sarasvatl the goddess of wisdom. Equally well does another passage, (pl3. xii. 7. 1. 10-12, desclibe Namuci's wile and Indra's mishap: nam?X- cinai 'va saha cacara (sc. tndrah): sa aiksscta namtscir apunar va ayam abhetd dRhantc 'sye 'ndRrbyam v?&gt;rya;i;7^ soxwapbtharrw anna- dya?n haranb 'ti tasyeti 'tayai 'va suraye 'nclrSytzm v?^ryam soma- ptthans ann(tdyam aharat sa ha n?yarnfxh pipye tam deua upasam- jaymzre prestho V(t, no 'yarn abAut tam iona?; pewma 'vadad dhante 'rnam bh,isajyczme 'ti: te 'gvgnau abr?van y?vam vai brah- mGi&gt;n&lt;zu bAisayGi&gt;t6 stho y?uarn imarn bAisajyatam itt .... te sarcesratem Gebruvan tv};s vat bha,iscGjyam asi tvarB zmam bAisagye 'tz.... 'Indra kept company with Namllci. Namuci reflected " This one has not come to his senses. Aha ! I will take his strength, manhood, soma-drink, and food." By means of this very szera he took his strength, manhood, soma-drink and food. He (Indra) lay unloosened. The gods came up to him and said: " This one has been the best among us, (but) sin has overtaken him here. \NJell, then, let us cure him." They said to the A§- vins: "Tou two indeed are the learned physicians, do you cure him" .... They s-aid to Sarasvatl: "You indeed are remedy do you cure him." It is to be obserlred that Namuci in his self- exhortation does not say anything about robbing Indra of sura ,- therefore the words etaycst 'ra suraya in the narrative subse- quently cannot mean 'along with this svr(t, but 'by means of this very sura.' Upon this the undelstanding of the situation depends: lndra in the preceding part of this chapter ((7B. xii. 7. * A similar description of the results of drunkenness at ($B. xii. 7. 2. t: apa va etasmat teja indriyatn vtryam kramati yarn somo tiparata urdhram va (text ca) vanca7il va ' brilliancy, strength, and manhood goes away from him who ejects the soma either from above or froln below.'

Now his cotnpanion Namuci further incapacitates him by plying him mrith sura, so that he comes into the state of surama, or intoxication from serc6. Then he robs him of those qualities which a drunkeal man loses: strength, taste for food, and especially the soma, which is later on regained by arduous labors on the part of the Agvins and Indra. A slightly different turn is given the same story by Mahldhara at VS. x. 33: namucir nar&gt; 'sura zndrasya sakha "szt sa viSvas tasye 'ndrscsya vtryarn surcjya somena saha papau tata indro 'gvzna?s saraseatzm co 'vaca.

C:f. also the commentary at VS. xix. 34: narntccine 'ndrasya vtryam pttarn. We must remember that the drink surc6 in general is, so to speak, not Indra's " tipple." In the RV., which states innumera- ble times that Indra gets his enjoyment and inspiration from his soma-potations, the drink sura is never mentioned in any especial connection with him: see i. 116. 7; 191. 1(s; vii. 86. 6; viii. 2. 12. Nor is Indra's name associated with the drink in the AV. In fact, so far as I know, Indra and sura are associated only in the sautsaman? the historical basis of which in all likelihood rests in a large measure on our legend. 'l'he sura is ill general not employed in prauta-practices ;t it is 7dyukika, not vaictzka, and everywhere in the worst repute possible. It is a strong drink. Mahldhara at VS. xxi. 1 says that the soma mixed with sura becomes strong (asz4tah suraya tzvqskrtah). Its preparation as described at K(pS. xix. 1. 20-27 and by Mahldhara at V8. xix. 1 shows that it was a strong spiced brandy prepared from fermented grains and plants.: cf. also Manu xi. 95 = Grhyas. ii. 16. As early as in RV. vii. 86. 6 sura along with wrath (many?i&gt;) dice (vibhtdaks6), thoughtless- ness (4citti), is spoken of as the cause of sin (anrta). For similar condemnation of the drink in the samhitas see Muir OST. v. 464; Zimmer, Att.

Once (p. 339) the practice of drinking sura at the sc6utrc6mans is alluded to contemptuouslfr. If our interpretation of the word surya and our conception of the stories at (7B. xii. 7. 1. 1() and 3. 1 is correct, if conse- quently the true value of RV. x. 131. 5 has been established by the aid of these stories, then we may once more recognize the value of the Brahmanas and Sutras.* For purposes of interpreta- tion the entire body of Vedic writings are a unit; one of the main faults of the interpretation of the Vedic hymns in the past has been the failure to investigate courageously and thoroughly the materials outside of the rnantras, to throw aside the abundant chafE, alld to derive from what is left the very considerable help which they yield, often irl the most unexpected manner. Con- versely the legends of the Brahmanas and the practices of the rit- ual, though they expand, adapt,. and symbolize, are usually founded upon conceptions expressed in 7nantra-form, and their explanation thus depends in a large measure upon the ntantras. Just as suraycb of the Brahmanas explains sur&lt;tma of the ma7btra, so also we were led to our interpretation of suraya by the theory that the word sqxrctma contained the word s?src6. 3. Indra with the aid of the A&lt;vzne and rFarasrat?, circ?mvents the coer^act, cznd revenges himself on ffiamuct. We have left In- dla in a sorry plight. According to gB. xii. 7. 1. 10 (cited above), he lies in a drunken stupor, and is so follnd by the gods, who esort to the A§vins and E3arasvatl in his behalf. According to (7B. xii. 7. 3. 1, and lAIahldhara at VS. x. 33 (see above), he is eapable of pleading his own case before these divinities. Other accounts of the story (TB. i. 7. 1. 6-7; Sayana at RV. viii. 14. 13; Mahabh. is. 2434ff.) omit all mention of the Avvins and Saras- vatl gt Endra gets the better of NaInuci apparently by his own X We may remark by the way once more in illustration of this truth that the article entitled ' Die Hauskatze im alten Indien,' Vedische Stu- dien (Pischel and Geldner) i. 313ff., would in all probability have remained unwritten if Geldner had had at his disposal Kaug. 42. 19 ff. which was not published at the time. It then would have been cleal that AV. i. 18 is directed against a wonlan with evil personal character- istics (papaZaksana sc. strt): the point of both hymn and practice is to ward off the evil consequences of those characteristics; they are there- fore exorcised, as it were, by word and deed. + Cf. also the transformed version of it at Mahabh. v. 318ff.</page><page sequence="12">W. Bloornfi,eldt, 4 cunning. In the RV. only the two stanzas x. 131. 4, 5 attest the part played by these gods. rrhe Yajus-samhitas and their attend- ant literature present quite a number of mantras which state dis- tinctly that aid was given by them to Indra in his afEair with Namuci. So especially a stanza which occurs in almost all accounts of the saut?c?nanz (vs. xix. 34; MS. iii. 11. 7 (p. 151); TB. ii. 6. 3. 1; gB. xii. 8. 1. 31; KgS. xix. 3. 10; Vait. 30. 12; LgS. v. 4. 15; S. xv. 15. 13) mentions all the dyramatTs personaN: Indla, the AJcvills, Sarasvatl, and Namuci.

Allthese will be discussed below in their proper places. C)f evident allu- sion to this story is also VS. xix. 12, where all but Namuci are mentioned by name; the same is true of VS. xix. 15, and a num- ber of other sautrainan-stanzas: VS. xix. 18, 80-8t) (= MS. iii. 9. 1 1; TB. ii. 6. 4); 88-90 (MS.

In the two stories of the gB. the AJcvins and Sarasvatl bargain for a share of the saut?amanz-sacri fice, and it is granted them by the gods at xii. 7. 1. 11, 12, and by Indra at xii. 7. 3. 1. The latter passage reads: te 'bruvan, ast? no 'tra 'py atha "harame 'ti saha na etad athcs "harate 'ty abra- vtt. Indra had complained of Namuci's robbery, and asks them to bring back what he has lost. ' They (sc. the AJcvins and Saras- vatl) said: "We must have a share in this also, then we will bring it back." Indra said: " This belongs to us together, bring it back then." ' In the former passage a goat is assigned to the AJcvins as their share, a sheep to Sarasvatl, while Indra's share consists of a bull: cf. VS. xix. 89-91; MS. ii;. 1 1. 9; TB. ii. 6. 4; Valit.30.11l5; K&lt;pS.six.3.2,3; S.xv.15.2-4; AS.iii. 9. 2. Both these represent the method, patented in the Bl ahmanas, of accountirlg {or the circumstance that the benefits of a certain sacrifice accrue to more than one divinity; this end is generally accomplished by an agreement between the divinities involved, or a promise rendered by one to the other: see e. g. gB. iv. ]. 3. 4; AB. iii. 20; TS. ii. 6. 6. Of this we must expect no trace in the nlantras; on the other hand, they report clearly that the Agsins and Sarassatl perfolmed a cure upon Illdra by means of a sacrifice, which is as a matter of course understood by the com- mentators to be the sctutra,rnan?,.

After the cure, we must assume, came the great act) the piece de ressstance of the entire story. Indra had sworn that he would not slay Namuci under the conditions stated above (p. 127); and yet some conditions lnust be invented which make him free to do this without perjuring himself. Down to the latest times the feat by which this was accomplished was a faarorite theme for the poets: Wamuci was slain b.y the foam of the waters. At Ramayana iii. 30. 28 (Bomb.; iii. 35. 94 Golresio) we read: sa vrtra iva vafrena phenena zarnucir yatha . . . . ntpapata hatah kharah ' Khara fell down slain .... as Vrtra was slain by tte thunderbolt, as Namuci by the foam.'

Nllakalltha in his commentary on Mahabh. i. 7306 ff. (Calc.; i. 197. 31 Bomb.) says: nam?beibadhe kartavye yatha czparn phene vafrasya pravegah .... ' just as when Wamuci was to be slain (Indra's) thunderbolt entered into tlle foam of the waters ' . . . .* Mahldhara at VS. x..83 says: ' the Avvins and Sarasvati gave to Indra a thunderbolt in the form of water-foam. With that Indra cut the head of Namuci.' And at xix. 71: (ccparn phenena) jata.dzndwrena namtzeer asurasya pirah (udavartayah) chinnavan ctst ' with the foam of water did you take of the head of the Asura Wamuci.' Sayana at RV. viii. i4. 13: 'Indra .... cut off his head at the junction of day and night, with foam, which is different from dry and wet. This pur- port is set forth in this verse: O Indra, with the foam of the waters, turned into a bolt, did you take off the head of the Asura Namuci.' The Brahmanas are more explicit. At MS. iv. 3. 4 we have: tctsya va upodaye suryasya nthararn samtatya 'pam phesaena giro 'chiznat ' having spread a fog at sunrise, he cut off his head with the foam of the waters.' At TB. i. 7. 1. 7 it is stated: sa etawb ap&lt;rn phenam asincat, na va esa pusko na "rdro, vyusta "stt, anu- ditah suryah, na va etad di?Ja na naktaxrt, tasyct?&gt; 'tasminl loke apczm phenena pira udavartayat 'he molded this foam of the waters: that, you know, is neither dry nor wet.

This promise was kept until at dawn one day Indra saw 'foam in the sea sirnilar to a mountain ,' this along with his thun- derbolt he threw upon Vrtra; Visnu entered the foam and slew Vrtra.

The stanza RV.iii.14. 13=AV.xx.29.3-VS.xix.71isthe onlyonein the entire qnantra-literature which mentions in this connection the 'foam of the waters.' It reads: apayn phenena namuceh psra indrd 'd avartayah: vwea ydd ajayaih sprdhah ' with the foam of the waters thou didst take off the head of Namuci, O Indra, when thou wast conquering all foes.' Lanman in the Notes to his Reader, p. 375b (cf. also Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, vol. lviii. [1889] pp. 28 i.), reflects, I imagine, a pretty wide spread opinion, whbn he says that " the form of the myth as it appears in the Brahmanas originates in a misconception ...." This has been the stereotyped attitude of investigators on comparing a story of the Brahmanas with what corresponded to it in the nzctn- tr; but opinion it is to be hoped, will soon start upon a career of rapid change on this point: cf. the introductory remarks of this paper. Certainly there is nothing anywhere in the story of Na- muci which favors Lanman's explanation of this asura (ibid. p. 375a) as the personification of a waterspout. For the sam-e reason lack of direct evidence of any sort, I cannot admit Ludwig's ex- planation, Rig- Veda s. 145, ' that Namuci was one of the principal opponents of the Arya in Indis. Bergaigne, La Reli.qion Vedique, ii. 346, justly points out that there is something very special in the choice of the verbs which describe Indra's destruction of Namuci. Quite frequently Vrtra's head is the object of Indra'sattack: RV. i. 52. lo; viii. 6. 6; 65. 2; and the root bAid ' split ' is enlployed in each of these three passages, as it naturally would be. But in the case of Namuci, in addition to familiar verbs of destruction which are found at RV. i. 53. t; ii. 14. 5; vii. 19. 5, we find the unusual verb rnanth (stem rnatha,vxu) at RAT. -. 30. 8; vi. 20. 6; the causatilre of the root vart at RV. v. 30. 7; and the same folm . * The verb udvasayami is employed here not without humor. It is a ritual expression used regularly in the sacrifice for the act of taking utensils off the altar: Indra took off Namuci's head as a pot is taken off the fire. Cf. e. g. Eaug. 2. 37; 6. 20.</page><page sequence="15">with the -preposition ud at viii. 14. 13. Why not ? The act of taking off a head with the foam of the waters is correspondingly unusual. .The root manth means 'rub, churn ;' the conception that the head was churned ofE in a mass of foam offers quite as atural a picture as any other mode of taking of a head with foam. The causative of the root vrt at v. 30. 7 naturally means 'cause to twistn' and Ad avartayah at viii. 14 13; though not altogether clear as to its precise shade of meaning, is paralleled by gB. iv. 4. 3. 4 irl connection with Vrtra: vrtro v(zi soma astt taen yatra deva yAnans tasya mqxrdAzo 'd vavarta. I shall now endeaver to show that the version of the story given in the Brahmanas was familiarly known to the AV. i. e. in nantra-times, as well as to the stbtras: in other wordsn there is no reason to believe that it was ever preceded by any historical or naturalistic version which was afterwards lost to Indian tradition. The hymn AV. i. 16 is a witcheraft practice in which lead is supposed to chase away evil spirits and demons of various sorts (yatTbeatanam). Thus especially the second stanza reads: stsaya 'dAy aha vartenah sbsayc-b 'gnr Xpa 'vati: sbsarn ma tndrah pra 'yachat tad anJgcz y{tuc&lt;itanam ' Varuna supports the lead; Agni helps the lead; Indra gave me the lead: that surely scatters the demons.' Lead is mentioned elsewhere in the AV. only st xii. i.t The opening stanza, addressed to the dead bods, reads: nadanx se roha na te cttra loka idam stsam bhagadheyaJm ta Eht: ' ascend the funeral fire, your place is not here; this lead be your share; come ': i. e., ' after this lead has destroyed you and rendered you halmless, -ou will be cremated.' Cf. also xii. S. 19, 20, where dis- ease is wiped off and lodged in the lead and other symbols of the body-burning fire; and xii. 2. 53, where lead is spoken of as the special property of agnih kravyc6d. Colrespondingly, at Kau§. 47. 23, while recitiIlg AV. i. 16, lead is put into the food or the cosmetics of an enemy; 47. 39,the head of a lizard, which is a substitute for lead (see Wau. S. 18), is employed in a witcheraft practice; at 71. 7, 15 lead is employed in connection with the extinction of the funeral- fire (kravycbc-chamanam). Now there is a very interesting parz- bhast-svtra at Kau§. 8. 18, which reads: stsa-nadesbse ayorajansi krkalctsapirah stsctni ; this may be paraphrased as follows: ' lead, river-lead, iron-filings, and the head of a lizard are in practice all of them equivalent to lead.' Darila explains nad?&gt;wtsa by q2.adxphezazpindah ' a lump of river-foam ;' Ee§ava by nadSphe- nan i river-foam.' The suggestion that the employment of this river-foam in hostile practices iS due to a reminiscence of In- dra's feat performed upon the head of Namuci may be safely made, and it can be supported by a parallel practice in the prezuta- ritual.

It is eastr to guess at the cause of the substitution: foam is too volatile, it does not preserve its character long enough to manipu- late successfully in practice.

For thespaidva which at RV. i. 116. 6; ix. 88. 4, AV. x. 4, means 'the horse of Pedu which slays serpents' there is substituted at Kaug. 32. 2l, 22; 35. 4 an insect, hostile to ser- pents, it may be supposed; this is manipulate.d instead of the legerXdary horse. See Kau§. Introduction, p. sliv fE. If I have succeeded in showing that the practices mentioned above and the reference to lead in the mantras of the AV. and the Yajus-samhitas are connected with the 'foam of the waters' in our story, no hesitation need be felt.in regarding the view of the RV. as identical with that of the remaining literature. 4. The ASvins and Saraseatt bring back the soma from Xa- qnuci. --- After Namuci's head has been cut off, Indra is still without * C:f. also the statement at VS. xxi. 36 * TB. ii. 6. 11. 6: Musati? saras- vatt bhisak stsena dxha indriyam ' strength and vigor Sarasvatl milks with lead,' in evident allusion to the version of the sto-y current among the Vajasaneyins, according to which the Agvins and Sarasvatl forged for Indra the bolt out of the foam of the wabters (9B. xii. 7. 8. 3). Hence, probably, at the sdutramant materials for the preparation of the surd are purchased of a eunuch, who lepresents Nainuci, the'oliginal owner of the sura; he is given lead in payment: see S(:S. xix. 1. 191 Mahldhara at VS. xix. 1; gB. xii. 7. 2. 12. Again, at the rajasuya, a eunuch is struck with the lead according to TB. i. 7. 8. 2. According to K(:S. xv. 5. 22 * Mahidhara at VS. x. 10; (:B. v. 4. 1. 1, brass (lohayas) is thrown into the mouth of the eunuch. This agaill reminds us of the ayorawansi of Kaug. 8. 18, which are there equivalent to ' river-lead.'

(But) they saw* this drink of the two somas according to the stanza "King Soma when pressed is cgmrtam " (VS. xiX. 72), and, having made it (the drink which had floved lerotn Namuci) palatable) they put it into them- selves.' The most prominent of the rnantras which alludes to this event is tha first one wllich contains the word s2GrCtma (cf. above 01): RniT. x. 131. 4 - AV. cx. 125. 4; VS. s. 33; sx. 76; MS. iii. 11. 4 (p. 145); iv. 12. 5 (191); TB. i. 4. 2. 1. It has been translated above: 'you, drinking yourselvest into a surfeit of sura with the asura Namuci, helped Indra in his deeds, O ye lords of light.' The implication is that the drink was disagreeable and too much for the Agvins, but, as it had to pass through them to become pure and {it for Indra's use, they subjected themselves to ' sur- sickness ' (stbrama) in Indra's service. Here belong a number of Yajus-stanzas,asVS.xx.59; MS.iii. 11.3 (p. 143); TB.ii.6.12.2: csSvbna qtnouceh sutam sJmam pukram parisrAta: saraseatt tarr? cuBharad Barh?,sE 'ndr6ery(x patave ' the A§vins brought the pure pressed soma along with parisrut from Namuci; sarasYatl brought it along with the barhis for Indra to drink.'

I believe that Mahldhara and Madhava both misunderstand the stanza. The purport of their comment is that Indra, after he had been strengthened by the A§vins and Sarasvati, s]ew Vala along with Namuci. Thus Mahldh.: . . . sa indro narnucav asure saca namucincb asw6renca saha magham moshccnbyarn valanx me,qham vidaritavaqt . . . namuciri vidarya vq stitn karitavan ity arthah. And Madhava (p. 721): so 'yam indro namucinamczstbre saca sambandhaqn mGccham naGchanzyarst balanamc6nam Gcsuram bi- bAeda vidctritarccw. My concepti(n of the stanza differs materi- ally: ' Indra, wholn the A§vins and Sarasvatl had strengthened on the occasion of (the slaughter of) the asura Namuci, cleft proud** Vala.' 'l'his rendering has the double advantage of not conflicting with the StOl'y and of introducing a translation of the phrase namuc&lt;6 cesecre sacce in accold with its value elsewhere: e. g.

Some of the Brahmanas and the Mahabharata take oceasion to moralize, to accuse Indra of deceiving a friend, and to condemn him to certain penitential acts. Thus TB. i. 7. 1. 7, 8: tad (sc. girah) enam Gczeavartata rnitradArug gti, sa etan apamcbrg&lt;en ajanayat, t&lt;n GtjuA^ot, tctir vai sa raksansy apahan 'this (head of Namuci) rolled after him, saying: "{you are a) * (2(:S. asure dadhi. t TB. asanod. t LgS. indriyena. § MS.

I do not see how the editors of the Petersburg lexicons escaped giving either word an adjectival value very much in accordance with the commentators. They define magha by ' gift ' and madga by ' erfreuend ' and ' into2cicating drillk.' None of these seem to suit the connection.</page><page sequence="19">Che Story of Indqa and l\Tam¢ez. 161 traitor to a friend." He caused these apaqnaq $rex-plantst to spring up.

He was not able to drive away this (head) by means of either rk or sKtAnan. Then he drove it away by means of the sama^w-finale called harivarna.' At Mhbh. ix. 2436 we have: ' that head of Namuci, after it had been cut off, followed after Indra, exclaiming close by: " Woe to you, wicked slayer of friends." And he, being thns goaded by this head, again an;l again in grief narrated this afEair to Brahma.' Acting upon his advice he performs a sacrifice and bathes in the river Aruna; this atones for his guilt, arld the head vanishes. A more unprincipled view of the same event is taken at Mhbh. ii. 1957, where Duryodhana says that Indra had rnade friends with Namuci; nevertheless he cllt ofE his head, that being the usage betnveen enemies. There are elsewhere similar stories of had faith on the part of the gods: e. g. TS. vi. 5. 1. 1-3; PB. xx. 15. 6; and the Mhbh. presents a goodly number of passages in which adroha and forgiveness of enemies is preached: see Ludwig, Wig- Veda vi. p. 202 (s?zb ';wortbruch Indra's" and ;sxxdroha"). It seems quite likely that this entire phase is a secondary append- age to the story. It is worked ul? in a still different fashion at MS. iv. 3. 4. Once it is said rather vaguely at RV. i. 53. 7 that Indra enjoyed the support of Waml in his conquest of Namuci: nxzmyczt yEd zndra sakAya paravati xibarh&lt;tyo nenuczm eama nczy?nan?,. A still less explicit association of Natnl Sapya with the story of Namuci occurs at RV. vi. 20. 6; it is stated there that Indra, after he had cut off the head of Wamllci, bestowed upon Naml while asleep wealth, strength and prosperity: . . . sro d(lsucsya nKnagoer mcthayci,n: pravaz nmem svjpyfim sasantc6rn penG6g rayms sairn tsa scceis srase^. The latter )assage is preceded and fol- lowed by stansas in each of which it is stated with rather schematic regularity that Indra on the one hand slew some demon and on the other benefited some man: Susna, the demon, and Dagoni, the bard (st. 4); 5Jusna, the demon, and Klltsa, the allv (st. 5); Na- muci the demon, and Naml, the friend (st. 6); thfe wily Pil)lu, and the pious Ki§van (st. 7). At RV. x. 48. 9 Naml Stipya is again an assistant of Indra, who this time furnislles ]lim with food and strength: pra me rzasws S(-{pyCb iSE bhtge bAuet. iSgainst * The word suggests the root mrj with preposition apa s to wipe off ' e. g.

Cf. also AV. iv. 17. 6 ; vii. ¢5. 2 S (:B. v. 2. 4. 14 * siii. 8. 4. 4. t Sayana explains the word here as the instrumental of numt7t, and refers it to Indra's thlmderbolt.</page><page sequence="20">the two passages in the RV. which mention Waml in connection with Namuci there are seven which do not refer to Naml: ii. 14. 5; v. 30. 7, 8; vii. 19. 5; viii. 14. 13; x. 73. 7; 131. 4.* While we may take it for granted that Naml stood in some relation to Indra, it is possible that his introduction into this afEair is due in the first place to his somewhat accidental antithetical juxtaposi- tion with the demon at RY. vi. 20. 6; this may have given rise secondarily to the statement at i. 53. 7. Cf. Ludwig, Rig- Veda iii. 149. The assonance of the two names Waml and Namuci may have favored the process. The texts arc not allvays very partic- ular as to the person to whom they give credit for assistance rendered in such contests. At RV. v. 30. 8 the author of the hymn (acc. to the Anukr., Babhru Atreya) says in a whole-souled fashion that Indra made him an ally in his contest with Namuci: yXzjam hz ntam akrtha ad zd sndra ptro dasKsya namqmcer math- ayan. At any rate we have in the relation of Naml, Indra, and Wamuci the germ of a story which was never developed; with this single exception all the reports about Namuci can be brought together into a single firmly-jointed whole. We may finally present in brief a connected sketch of the en- tire legend as reconstructed above. Indra, the god of the clear Bky, is forever slaying with his thunderbolt the cloud-demons who obstruct the rain and withhold from mortals the blessings consequent upon it. But in one instance he encounters the demon Namuci (' Don't-let-go&gt; or ' Eold-fast '), who, instead of falling an easy victim to his thunderbolt, engages him in close combat and rather gets the better of him. Namuci holds Indra fast, and re- fases to let him go unless he enters into a strict agreement not to slay him sllbsequently. The compact is constructed very diplo- matically, so as to leave apparently no possibility of danger to Namuci from Indra: the latter agrees not to slay the former either by day or by night: i. e., as Namuci construes it, at no time whatsoever. He agrees further not to slay him either with a staff or a bow, with the dat hand or the fist, with anything wet or dry: i. e.&gt; as Namuci intends, with no known weapon. For a while the pair are boon companions. ButL Namuci, the asura, is boun(l to betray his nature, fundamentally hostile towards Indra, the deva; and upon one occasion, when Indra had iTnbibed freely of his favorite beverage the soma, he plies him still further with the strong drink sura (brandy), which is regalded as unholy, and is no doubt conceived as the special drink of the Asuras. Indra becomes stupefied and loses his strength, his senses, the taste for food, and soma, and in the story Wamuci is conceived as having robbed him of these and applopriated them to his own use. The gods now step upon the scene. The Agvins, the heavenly * The remaining Salnhitas do not, as far as is known, mention Nam at all; ,at PB. xxv. 10. 17 he is said to be a king of Videha who went to heaven by pious praCtiGeS. 162 M.

In order to evade the clause of the compact which forbids him to do the deed e-ither by day or by night, they choose the time of the dawn before the sun had risen, sthat being neither day nor night.' In order to intloduce a weapon not exclllded by the stipulation of the com- pact, they forge a bolt from the foam of the waters, ' tllat being neither wet nor dry.' Indra slays Namuci, but he is still without his soma which now flows from the body of Namuci mixed with bloodandimpule,sothat he maynotdrinkit. Here again the Agvins lend their aid; they drink the loathsome mixtllle, and having purified it in their divine bodies, they return it to Indra. II. TH E Two Doss OF YAMA IN A NEW ROLE. The extent to which Vedic Jmantras may be based upon events which are nalrated more completely or in full in the literature of the Brahmanas has Just been illllstrated by our treatment of the story of Indra and Namuci. The hymn AV. vi. 80 oSers another instance o{' this kind'; its purport is unintelligible, and it collld in fact not have heen composed, without the background of a group of parallel legends narrated in the Maitrayanl-saulhit.l, Kathaka- samhita, and Taittirlya-brahmana. Furthermore, its explanation by means of these legends throws, as we believe, valuable light upon certain early, if not the earliest, conceptions of the two dogs of Yama which are mentioned from the time of the RAT. in vari- ous statements difficult to ullderstand and to harmonize with one another. The hymn AV. vi. 80 is as follows: t. antariksenaspatati viMva bhuta 'vacakaMat: funo divgasya yan mahas tena te hasvtsa vtdhema.* 2. ye trayah kalakanjA din devA iva frita7.T: tAn sarvan ahea utaye 'emd artstatataye. 3. apsi6 te janma divi te sadhasthan samtedre antar mahimd te prthi- vy4ffw: vuno dtvqyasya yan mahas tena te havisa vtdhema.+ We ma- translate: 1. sHe flies through the air looking down 1lpon all beings; we desire to do homage with this havis to thee [who art] the majesty of the heavenly dog. 2.

'In the waters is thy origin; upon the heavens thy home; in the middle of the sea and upon the earth thy greatness. We desire to do homage with this havis to thee [who art] the majesty of the heavenly dog.' But few attempts have been made to exlllain this hymn. Lud- wig, Ssg- Veda iii. 373, translates it under the caption puno dsry- asya havih, without defining its aim. Zimmer, Altindssches Leben, p. 353, surmises that the pran divya is the dog-star: cf. also Weber, Xaksatra ii. 372. The legend of the TB. (i. 1. 2. 4-6) which bears upon the hymn is as follows: ka1ukebnvcz vcizz nKbScb 's?brez asan te s?vargaya lokaycx 'grzsm acinvata, purusa istakanx z6pcz 'dadhat purusa istakam, sa indro brxAmcx.no br?brana tstaDctm ?pCz 'dhatta, esa me cttra name '!i, te s?brargatokam Cb pra 'rohan, sa tndra istakarn a 'vrhat, te 'va ktryarbta, ye 'va ktryanta, ta urnanfbbhayo 'bhavan, dvav tbd apatatam, tCb?b diVyCbU Svctnxv abhavatam 'there were Asuras named Kalakalljas. They piled up a fire altar in order to obtain the world of heaven. Man by man they placed a brick upon it. Indra, passing himself off for a Brahmana, put a brick on for himself, saying: " this one, citra (the hright one) by name, is for me." They c-limbed up to heaven. Indra pulled out his brick; they tumbled down. And they who tumbled down be- came spiders; two flew up, and became the two heavenly dogs.'* Sielilarly at Kath. S. viii. lt (reported by Weber, Ind. St?d. iii. 465) we have: kalakanjct veti net,mcl, 'sura asans, ta istaka acin- vata, tad indra istaDctm ap?/ xgp(z 'dhatta, tesetnx mitht6na? divam a 'kranxetam, tatas te--rB a 'vrhat, te 'va ksryanta, ta eta?b divya peanamb 'there were Asuras, Kalakanjas by name; they piled bricks (for an altar). Then Indra also put on a brick. A pair of these ascended to heaven. Then he (Indra) tore out this (brick); they (the Asuras) were thrown down. Those two are the two heav^enly dogs.' The legend as told at MS. i. 6. 9 is essentially identical with these, but it carries us an important step forward by designating the 'two heavenly dogs' as yamcuSvf^,, the 'two dogs of Yama': kalakanja vc4 a,sura istaka acinvata divam c4roksyc4ma iti ta,n inClro brahwano bravana ?sp&lt;4it sa etam i.staDctwb apy tbpa 'dhatta ta prathama iva divam a, 'kre:i,rnanta 'tha sa tcem cx 'brhat te asurah papsyanso bhavanto apa 'bAran,garbta .?/a uttamcz astam tau yarna- pra abhavatam .?ye 'dhare ta urnav&lt;x,bha?yah 'the Asuras called Kalakanjas piled bricks (for an altar), saying: "we will ascend to heaven."

The Asuras becoming quite feeble fell down; the two that were uppermost became the two dogs of Yama, those which were lomrer became spidels.' This identification of the pv(tnc4N div.yau with the dogs of Yama does not rest on this passage alone. At the aSvasnedha-sacrifice during a certain stage in the proveedings the horse is bathed; it is accompanied to the middle of the water by a 'four-eyed' dog (pran caturaksa),* i. e. a symbolic dog of Yama (RV. x. 14. 10, 11; AV. xviii. 2. 11, 12; TA. Afriw 3 1) wllo is slain by a low-born man under the feet of the horse, by means of a pestle made of the wood of the sidAraka-tree: see TEl. iii. 8. 4. ] ff.; gB. xiii. 1. 2. 9; R:S. xx. 1. 38 ff.; Mahldhara at VS. xxii. 5. The reason assigned for this practice by the Brahmanas is: f ebrbap cataraksasya pra- hanti pre 'vapexpma bArat.rryah petpmaobam eva 'sya bArat.rvgam hanti . . . . vayrb vt aSvah pr(tjeqvatycxh vajrer&lt;zz 'va papnananx bAratrryam arakq antats (TB.) ' he slays the four-eyed dog. The dog is evil as it were, and his lival; 11;s evil indeed and his rival he slays.... The horse descended frorn Prajapati has a thun- derbolt; with the thunderbolt indeed does he overcome evil and his rival.'t Similarly 5JR. loc. cit.: vapro 'peah a * O * pvanaen caturaksaiQ, hatva 'dhaspadarvb aSvasyo ')pa plavayati,vafren,ai 'vai, 'na7ez ava kra,m^ti n(ti 'narst papma bAr&lt;.ttrrya c.upnoti. Cf. also t!B. vi. 3. 2. 7. This hostility agaillst the dog of Yama refers no doubt to tlle legend aboven in connection with which it is also stated that hostility and rivalry are removed from him who recognizes its purport: erctm asya scapatrbo bAratrryah pap^.?yan bhavann apa bArcxn,gcxte ya erctrB vidvan, ete.

The sutra and its corurnentators, as also the exact relation of the hymn to its ritual ale obscure ;* the practice is inGended to cure paralysis. It ap- pears that the spot where the disease has struck the victim is made the object of attack; this the priest(?), while keeping in motion (cankrawnay), rllbs over with mud taken from the foot- plint of a dog. Then he fumigates the place by burning an insect. But one point seems certain: that the use of the insect symbolizes the fate of the k(zlakanja who in the legend become spiders. Madhava, ibid., says of them: te co 'rrzanabhtnamakcbh l?tctkttah prG6b1^avan, tena kttena samerstan2 tantetjG6lans ?brnapab- deno c,yate. C:f. with this the word ktta at Kaug. 31. 19. What now was the Hindu conception regarding the two dogs of Yama, which are at the same time the heavenly dogs ' flying through the air and looking down upon all beings ' (AV. vi. 80. I ) ? Weber's and Zimmer's supposition that they refer to some star or some constellation of stars is improbable, first, because a constel- lation of a character sufficiently marked to lend itself to such a comparison is otherwise ullknown; secondly, because the refer- ence is evidently to a pair, eac.h of which is independent enough to exist by- itself. No poet would have spoken of a single mem- ber of such a dualism, any more than he would mention separately one of the rsw of the saptar.sayah, the great Bear (e. g. RV. iv. 42. 8; ix. 92. 2; x. 82. 2; 109. 4; AV. iv. 11. 7; v. 17. 6; viii. 1(). 25, etc.).t The sphere of conceptions which have produced the legends of the two heaarenly dogs can, we believe, be made to tell us what they were. At Kath. S. xxxvii. 14 (cited by Schroeder, M3. i. p. lOl, note 2) we haare the statement that the two dogs of Yama are day and night: ettb vai yamapecb crvhap ca rcbtrt ca. The same staternent more explicitly we have at KB. ii. 9 (end): scbyarn astam ste purcb tanbasas tasmin kcble juhuyc6t sa devaycbnah ketuh .... prGbtah p?ro 'daya,d apsr,hate tamasi tasmin kate jezhuyc6t sa devayci,nah ketuh .... atho yo 'to anyatha 'gntho- tram juhoti pyamapabalc6tz ha, 'sycb 'gnihotram vikAidato Char vz pabalo ratrSh pycbmah SCb yo nahayrcbtre j#hoti pycbnzo hcb 'sycb 'gnihotrarn vtkhidaty atha ,?yo maAc6hne juhoti pabalo h(as 'sya ',qnihotrawn vikAidati.

Here the mention of the pyamapabalc/,rh intervenes between sun and moon on the one side and morning and evening twilight on the other; the pyamapabatau stand here as a special designation either of day and night, which are mentioned by name in the next section (v. 7. 20), or of sun and moon themselves. The latter, in- deed, is their purely physical value in this sphere of conceptions; they are primarily sun and moon, and secondarily day and night. This is stated in part explicitly at SB. xi. 1. 5. 1: sa (sc. candra- mah) hai 'sa divyah pVC-6 sa yajanxctnasya papmn ave "ksate. The moon (night), the divine dog, is here one of the dogs of Yama, the pyamapabala,?X; the conclusion that the sun (day) is the other is almost self-evident, and we are s)ared the task of looking for two individual stars or a constellation of two stars in order to explain the pvanaq divyav. A stanza parallel to AV. vi. 80. 1 occurs at RV. x. 136. 4. The translators regard the RV. hymn as a song in praise of an aseetic. Grassmann (ii. 499) entitles it ' Lob des Biissers '; Ludwig (v. 553) thinks that it sketches a yogin. This seems to me only a partial explanation of the hymn; it is rather a hymn in which Surya is praised and compared with a muni. Stanza 1 reads: kegy dynzm kepz visam kepz bibharti ro'dass kepb vyvaqn svdr cZ.rpe kept 'das-rb jydtir t4cyate. ' KeJcin the fire, KeJcin the visam (fluid ? cf. Naigh. i. ] 2), Kegin carries the two worlds. KeJcin is all brightness which is to be beheld; KeJcin is called light here.' At Naigh. v. 6 kepin and Aceginah occur as divinities; at Wirukta xii. 26 (4c6ivatakandam vi. 26) kegin is identified with czditya.t Of the three kegin, Agni, Surya, and Vayu, which occur at RV. i. l 64. 44, ' the one who with his mighty qualities looks at the whole world (vpeam eko abh?&gt; caste pc/cthAih) is surely Surya: see Wir. xii. &gt;7; Elaug, Vedische Rathse7&gt;fragen ?ind Rathselsprflche, p. 53; Katy.

Support for our explanation of the dzvyau peanat6 as sun and moon seems to be afforded also by a passage in the Chand.

Bohtlingk in his recent edition and translation of the text renders: ' Vom Schwarzen fluchte ich mich zum Scheckigen, vom Scheckigen fluchte icll mich zum Schwarzen. Wie ein Ross seine (losen) Haare von sich abschuttelt, so schuttele ich das Bose von mir ab, .... und begebe mich in die Statte des Brahman.'* The passage becomes tore intelligible if we translate: CI go from the moon to the sun and from the sun to the moon, .... and arrive at the world of Brahman.' C!f. the passage Kaus. Up. i. 2, 3.t where it is said that all those who go away from this world go to the moon, the moon being the door of the world of light. They come to earth again, and then pass to the world of Brahman by the road of the gods which has many stages * the the world of fire, of wind, of the sun, of tbe moon, of lightning, of Varuna, of Indra, of Prajapati finally of Brahman. Cf. also Chand. Up. iii. 13. 1-6, where the five kinds of bleath, personified respectively as sun, moon, fire, rain, and wind, are spoken of as the doorkeepers of Brahman; also AB. viii. 28, which ends this text iD a manner altogether parallel to the ending of Clland. Up where the pyama and pabala are mentioned. One would fain look for more information on the kakbkartja in connectiorl with this study. I have found but one Vedic passage in addition to those above, namely Kaus. Up. iii. 2, where Indra is made to say of himself that he killed the Paulomas in the sky and the Wala- kanjyas upon earth. The ritual of the AV. (Eau§. 31. 19) clearly conceives of the k&lt;tZkctn,ja as spiders, the shape they assumed after the final catastrophe: see above.

Up., comes to the golden city of the Pauloma and Ealakanjya, whom he dlily conquers: see WebeAr, Ind. Stud. i. 416; Holzmann, ZDMG. xxxii. 312ff. Weber explains both as the 'black-haired children of a dark mass of clouds.' It seems to me more likely that some manifestation of the starry sky (perhaps the galaxy ?) is at the bottom of this conception. But I do not know. More important is the question of the relation of the sun and rnoon personified as the two dogs of Yama to that other well- known physical view which apparently deals with the dogs simply as animals. The principal passage of this sort is RV. x 84. 10- 12-AV4 xviii. 2. 11-13-TA. vi. 3. 1, 2. They are aliuded to further mole or less explicitly as animals with the qualities of animalsatRV.i.29.3; vii.a5.2-4; AV.v..30.6; viii.1.9;2.11; 8. 10, 11; MS. iv. 9. 19; TA. iv.29; PGS. i:16. 24; in- a §10ka which serves as a prayer at the end of the manuscripts of AGS.;* and at HGS. ii. 7 2.t It is not impossible to mediate between the two conceptions from the point of view of the Brahmanas alone. The dogs are destructive agents of death, and day and night are also familiarly conceived of as destructive instruments of death: e. g. KB. ii. 9 states that day and night are the arms of death: atho mrtyor ha qncz etccu vrccjabc6hu ycgd ahorcctre; at 5JB. x. 4. 3. 1 ff. we have: escs vas r),rtyur ycst sar;zeatsarah, ess6 hz mar- tycc^ctrn a,/^orcctrc6bAyam a6yuh ksinoti 'the year i8 death; by means of day and night does it destrov the life of mortals.' The substitution of sun and moon for day and night would be even simpler,t and thus the dogs of Yama would be identified with those heaveIlly bodies. Yet this seems unsatisfactory. The wri- ter believes that there has been a superabundance of mythologiz- ing otl this point. Especially the latest explanation of the two dogs, that of J. Ehni, lWer Vedtsche Myth?s des Yama, p. 138 ff., seems to be devoid of every basis of fact. The explanatioll there offered (p. ] 39) is that the sararneyccu are two winds, namely the west-wind and the south-wind.§ I fail to find a single attribute as reported by the Hindus themselves which makes in any way for such a mythology. Let us consider but the one point of color, ln the partial activity of its phases suggested the propriety of establish- ing symbolic connection between the jpaksa of the moon and the paksa- hata. * See Weber, Ind. Stud. ii. 296: vaivaseatakule j&amp;tau dv&amp;u MyaswaMa- valdu Munau: tabhyam pindo maya datto rakset&amp;m pathi mast sada. + Especially interesting is this passage: athorama (! for adhorama) udumbarah saraqneyo ha dhavati: samudram iva (! for ava P) c&amp;kaMad bibhran niskam CCb rakmath ca ' Sarameya, dark below and brown, runs, looking down ul)on the sea, carrying ornaments and gold.' The verse shows notable points of contact with AV. vi. 80 and RV. x. 136. Cf. also Ap. Gr. vii. 18. 1-4, and its commentary. t Therefore perhaps the frequent statement in the Brahmanas that the sun is death. Thus (:B. ii. 3. 3. 7: ya esa tapati tad yad esa mrtyuh. f For earlier explanations see Ehni, ibid, p. 138, note Ind. Stud. i. 114; ii. 296.</page><page sequence="28">o X. Bloomfle7,d, which appears persistently as an attribute of the dogs: pabala at RV. x. 14. 10; AV. xviii. 2. 11; TA. vi. 3. 1; tudumbalau, RV. x. 14.12; AV. xviii. 2. 13; TA. vi. 3. 2; pyctnza-pabala?s, AV. viii. 1. 9; PGS. i. 16. 24; arj?sna and jpiparwcza, RV. vii. 55. 2. Almost all these epithets are assembled at HGS. ii. 7. 2.t Who ever heard of winds of a certain color ? or why should the element of color turn up so persistently in the personified form of these winds? Ehni exhibits in fact no better argument than an ety- mological one: the sarameyau are the offspring of sarawna, and sarawba contains the root sar 'go.' He compares sarama with sarany¢ ' fleet, mobile,' used as an epithet of the Maruts at RV. i. 62. 4; iii. 32. 5, and assumes that sarama is a goddess of the stolm, and that therefore her children are also gods of the wind. Aftel careftll deliberation, I would for my part point out that the identity of the two dogs with sun and lrloon which is clearly implied in the Brahmanas seems to account for many qualities and statements of them mentioned in the mantras. The color or brightness of sun and moon would comport well wWith their attri- butes of color. They are called the messengers of Yama who go after people, a very suitable epithet for sun and moon.$ I would draw attention especially to the statement ya?s te prawzco6?s 3zawna raksttG6ra?z .... pathtrakst (AV. pathtsads) nrcdksasat6, RV. x. 14. ll-AV. xviii. 2. 12 = TA. vi. 3. 1; here the epithets rak- sttarG6u and pathtrakst are falrorable to such a construction, and the word nrcaksas 'looking upon men' is a standing epithet of sun and moon. Thus, nrcdksah s?'ryah at RY. vii. 60. 2; nrec6k- sah p?isa at RV. x. 139. 2 ; savttaram nrcaksasarn, RV. i. 22. 7; adityasya nrcaksasah, AV. xiii. 2. 1; G6dstye nrec6ksass, AV. x. 3. 18; tvdrn soma . . . . abhavo rwrcaksG6h, RV. i. 91. 2; tvam hs nas tarwvAh sowna goqpcc gatre-gG6tre ntsasatthGi^ ne caksah (double enten- dre: soma the drink, and sorna the moon); RAT. viii. 48. 9, etc. Note also the use of the word as epithet of the stars of the night at AV. xix. 47. 3: ye te rG6tr?&gt; rwrgaksaso drastaUrah. The entire scope of the epithet is well di3scribed by Grassmann, Worterbuch, s.v.: 'von den gottern am haufigsten von der sonne und ihren gottern, von Soma (i. e. the moon), und xron Agni.' Above all, the + The epithet asrnrnukha at MS. iv. 9. 19 * TA. iv. 29, may also have been suggested by the notion of color. I would note here, without being able to assign a reason, that in the ritual of the AV. the eight verses beginning with the three verses which deal with the dogs of Yama have a special designation, seemingly by a word for color. At Kauc. 80..35 (see the An- tyestipaddhati and Kecava ibid.); 82. 31; 88. 20, 23; 84. 13; Vait. 37. 24, the verses AV. xviii. 2. t1-18 are designated as harinz-verses. The verb har is always enlployed in connection with them (harintbhir hareyuh). Whether this justifies us in regarding the word harintbhWh (sc. rgbhth) as meaning ' verses with which the act of taking is performed,' or whether this represents a punning juxtaposition of harins ' yellow ' and hr ' take,' I am not in the position to decide. $ Cf. RV. x. 92. 12: sAryamasa vicarsmta diviksita * and RV. x. 88. 11: yadd carisnA mithunav abhutam ad tt prapaMyan bhuvanani vi,cra, which evidently refers to sun and moon.</page><page sequence="29">Zhe Itqoo l)oys of Yagno6. 171 assumption that sun and moon, are implicated in the myth of Yama's dogs relieves us of many apparent inconsistencies in the statements concerning them. On the one hand the exhortation to the deadj ' run past the two spotted dogs . . . . straightways; then come to the kindly fathers, who hold high feast with Yama,' suits well the conception of the pV({4at.b diV,?/(t,t6, heavenly dogs who are suspended in the sky (RAT. x. 14. 10). On the other hand, by the easiest change of mental attitude the same two dogs are the protectors who guard the way, and look llpon Tnen (favor- ably: this implication is always contained in nq cetksat), are ordeled by Yama to take charge of the dead, and to furnish them prosperity and health (RV. x. 14. 11). Again, by an eqllally simple shift of position, sun and moon move among men as the messengers of death; by day and by night men perish while these heavenly bodies alternate in their presence among men.* This furnishes the terrible side of their natllre (RV. s. 14. 12). For me at least the verses when viewed in this light have hecome fuller in meaning and more consistent in their relation to one anothel, and if this view stands we are saved the problematic assumption that the conception of the pvelnezu di?nyex,u in AV. vi. 80 and the Brahmanas represents an essentially novel develop- ment, totally foreign to the principal passage which describes them, RV. x. 14. 10-12. I add a summary of the preceding investigation. At AV. vi. 80 a 'heavenly dog,' dtryah pvei^,, is mentioned who flies through the air and looks down upon all beings. Alltlsion is made in this to a legend reported in the 13rahmar.las, according to which two heavenly dogs, formerly Asuras, managed to ascend the heavens and to gain there a permanent foothold. The Maitrayanl-samhit; states explicitly that these same two dogs are the dogs of Yama. Further the two dogs of Yama, either under their collective name of yamaSvcz or separately desigllated as py(lsza (or gyezea) and pabala, are constantly identified in the Brahmanas with day and night, and once in the Satapatha-br&gt;ihmana the moon is styled 'the heavenly dog who looks down upon the cattle.' The con- clusion derived from all these statements is that in the-Athatvan and the Brahmanas the two dogs of Yama are familiatly identified with the sun and the moon. 'rhis result is then brought to bear upon the reports on the two dogs of Yama in the hymns themselves, especially the very inter- esting passage RV. x. 14. 10-12, and the corresponding passages in other collections of mantras. It is shown that the apparently * In this connection RV. i. 29. 3 is very noteworthy: ni srapayd m- thvdr'Ma (Say. yamadvtyau) sastam abudAyawlane ' put to sieep the two (female messengers of Yama) who are visible by turns; let theln sleep without waking.' The epithet mithvd17'Ma fits sun and moon admirablv. But why should tlley be feminine ? Tlie Pet. Lex. refers tlle epithet to day and night.</page><page sequence="30">172 1ff. BloornfeldC, conflicting attlibutes which are bestowed upon them in the hymns are best separately accounted for and harmonized with one an- other by the aid of this vely explanation; every statement in these muchdiscllssed stanzas falls natllrally illtO line with the other, and the passage seems to be freed from nearly everv serious difficulty. III. THE MARRIAGE OF SARANYU, TVASTAR'S DAUGHTER. In venturing to add one more to the many essays* on the nar- rative of Saran.yu's conJugal exploits as recorded at RV. x. 17. 1, 2, my justification is that I come to the task armed with a theory which I hope will gain general, if not universal, assent as soon as it is applied to the instance in hand. The passage, according to my view, belongs to the class of Vedic literary endeavors which are styled in the Vedas themselves brahsxodya or brahmavadya; it is a riddle or charade, not, as has hitherto been held, either a fragment, or a story cuf a form so condensed as to be foreign to Indian habits of narration. The brahmodya occur in the majority of Vedic works: e. g., at RV. i. 164 = AV. ix. 9 and 10; VS. xxiii. 9-12; 49-52; 61-62; TS. vii. 4. 18; AB. v. 25; ($B. xiii. 2. 6. 9-17; 5. 2. 11-21; A(7S. viii. 13. 13, 14; x. 9. 1-3; gtSS. xvi. 4-6; Vait. 37. 1 fE.; 38.5 f.; L(7S. ix. 10. 9fE.; E(7S. xx. 7. 11; Ap. (pr. xx. 19. They differ somewhat in character alld structule: sometimes, as at RV. i. 1R4. 34, 35, the question is stated in a full verse followed by an equallv explicit answer; sometimes, as at AB. v. 2o (15 fE.), the riddle is put categorically and concisely, not in the form of a question ;t the answer again follows. Again, frequently onlythe question is put in the form either of a categorical statement or of an interrogation, the answer either being too obvious or being wlthheld in order to impart additional interest and mystery to the riddle. Of this sc)rt is RV. viii. 29, and i. 164, excepting vv. 34, 35. Finally, at A(7S. viii. 1%. 14 and AB. v. 25 (23), there is a brahmodgya as the texts explicitly state which contains only answers to a question which is presupposed and easily supplied.t * The literature on the subject, consisting of translations, comme.l.- taries, and mythological explanations, is very extensive: see tIuir, OST. v. 227-9 * Kuhn in KZ. i. 440 ff.; Roth in ZDMG. iv. 425; L.

It may be divided naturally into two parts. The answer is embraced in the one last word, sarasryv'h; the riddle is posited in the form of a cate^,orical staternent, wLich stands for the ques- tion. The Ilame to he guessed is suggested seveIl times in the riddle, each suggestion plesentillg a diSerent attribute or aspect of Saranyu: a. the daughter of 'l'vastar; b. the mother of Yama; c. the wife of Vivasvant; d. the imr;ortal (who was in sonle solt of touch with mortals); e. she for WhOHl a double was made in her image; t the mother (?) of the A§vilS; q. the divility who ahandoned two pails of twins. We should have put the riddle somewhat as follows: " Who is the daughter of Tvastar, the mother of Yama, the wife of Vivasvallt, ete., etc. ? Answer: Saranyu." We tan feel tllat the very multiplicity of striking and conflieting events ill hel histov would challenge to their embodi- ment in the epitotne of a bra/^modqJce. 2.

At st. 2 a no reason is assigned for the hiding away of Saranyu; at 2 c no account is given of how she bore(?) the Agvins. Other points might be added. The whole, moreover, to our feelitlg is pervaded too by an air of pla-fulness,*which cannot be fastened upon any single word or expression, bllt is felt more and more keenly after each reading. If our theory is correct, it will afect materially our attitude towards the later versions of Saranyu's life-story. One can scalcely doubt that a legend which had become so firmly seated in th£e popular mind as to be deemed fitting material for a riddle would in the main be reported correctly in the ttshasa-literature. This does not of course exclude such inevitable embellishments or omissions as are almost certain to modify the story on its passage from mouth to mouth. Yaska in the Nirukta xii. 10 (daivata- kete?.da vi.) and gaunaka in the B.rhaddevata vi. 33, reported by Sayana at RV. vii. 72. 2, narrate the ttihasa corresponding to the brahnzodya; my complaint is that, though they present some points more fully than the latter, they omit tnany motsfs which can be, as I believe, lead with a good deal of certainty between the lines. Yaska, commenting on x. 17. 2, says: ' In reference to this (stanza) an itiAc-bsa is told. Tvastar's daughter Saranyu gave birth to tsvins from Vivasvant (the sun). She, putting in her place another female, a savarna, taking on the form of a mare fled forth. Vivasvant, correspondingly taking on the form of a llorse, followed her and coupledwith her. From that were born the two Agvins (the 'Horse-men'). Of the savarna was born Manu. Such is the meaning of this stanza.' ()aunaka's version is as follows: abhavad rnithunam tvastuh saranyzuh trigirah saha: sa vAi saranyzum prayachat seayarn eva vivasvGlte. tatczZl, saran?yva;z jate te yamayam.ya?h vseaseatah: tav apy ubhathyanzctv eva hy astaxn yam?yc6 ca vai yama^. ts} stva bhartuh paroksclnz tu sarany?XA sadrpbm strsyazn: ^a,iksipycz rnitA2,?nau tasyam asSva, bh?ited jprcg6cakrame. avijnanad vivaseans tu tasyc6nz ajanayad mar7um: rczyarsir astt sa mfisnur vzvasec6n sea tejasa. scz ripeetyfb 'pakrantam tam saranyztm atmarupism: * We may however question whether any suggestion of humor was conveyed to the Hindus themselves by any of these literary perform- ances.

These two were also twins. \ithout the knowledge of her hus- band she created a woman like herself, foisted her twin-children upon her, and, turning herself into a mare, fled. Vivasvant then in ignorance begot on this (female who was left) Manu, a rc6jarsz like Vivasvant in glory. But, discovering that the real Saranyu had gone away, he quickly followed the daughter of Tvastar, having assurned the form o£ a horse with qualities corresponding to hers. Recognizing him in that form, she approached him with the desir&lt;3 of intercourse, which he there gratified.... From this act sprang the two Kumaras, . . . who are known as Horse- men.' The Stoly is told again upon essentially the same lines in the Harivanga, 545 ff., in the S;lmvavijaya 12 (Weber, Sitzunys- berichte der Berliner Atade^nie, Jan. 19, 1880, p. 72), in the Vis- nupurana iii. 2 :* the versions there given are well calculated to confirm the belief that a fairly well defined single story underlies every report which has corne down to our times. Turning now to a more detailed analysis of the brahrnodya, the first point that claims our attetltioll is the unusual character of the marriage of Sarallttu. The words t4am v^yvamo bhAvanam san eti seem to me capable of but one construction, namely that the whole mrotld, not only the gods but notably also such inhab- itants of the ealth as were then in existence, were admitted as wooers for the hand of the lady. We might be tempted to sup- pose that a seayct;lvarft 'a self-choice marriage' (cf. Pischel, Vedgsche Studien i. 16 Ef.) is indicated, but for the explicit state- ment of the Brhaddevata: 'Tvastal of his own accord gave Sa- ranyu to Vivasvant.t 'l'he statement is sign;fieant, and not to be taken lightly, as it accords well with the unusual circumstance that he gave his daughter not to a god but to a mortal. For in . this stoty Vivasvant and the twins Yama and Yaml which he begot with Saranyu are, I believe, designated as mortals (mar- tyebAyah, st. 2).: We may assutne with a good deal of certainty, * Cf. also Mark.

The character of Vivasvant as a mortal, or at least as a divinity with a not unblemished escutcheon, forms the dramatic mottf of the story. His designation here as a ntart?/a is supported by the designation of his son Manu as a ravarsi in the Brhaddevata, as also at Mahabh. iii. 12747.* At TS. vi. 5. 6. 2, it is stated ex- plicitly that men are the ofEspring of Vivasvant: tG6to vzeaseasn G6dityA 'jc6yata, tasya vc6 st/am prajct yczrb wbanusya, h. Especially interesting is the legend about Aditi and her eight sons, which is indicated at RV. x. V2. 8, 9, and expanded at (7B. iii. 1. 3. 3 fE. It is told with the evident intentiotl of showing that Vivasvant, though called *6dttya, is yet of a rank and quality very different from that of the orthodox seven Adityas, inasmuch as the race of man is descended from him.t All this is in accord with the char- acter of Vivasvant in the myth from the start. I do not hesitate to identify the epithet wbartya as assigned to Vivasvant and Yama with qnashyo of the Avestan myth; at Ya§na ix. 3, 4 Vivanhao is spoken of expressly as the first moItal (pctotryo qnashyo); at ix. 6, 7, Yima is stated to be the second mortal bityo nashyo). Whatever may be the genetic developtnent of the myths concerning these divine personalities-a question with which we are here not directly concellled there is present at sorne stage, probably a very early one, the notion that they were men, the first men. In the Avesta and in the Persian literature Vivanhao (Pers. Vaivendshehan, Janbekhan, or Alludshihan: ZDMG. iv. p. 422) is always a mythical king, there being no longer any trate of naturalistic conceptiolls in corlnection with him. In the mantras the naturalistic side (vivasrant, the shining sun) is altogether prominent; the anthropomorphic side is in fact represented most clearly and expressly by the passage here under discussion. But as king Yama is the first mortal, (AV. xviii. 3. * In Madhusudana Sarasvati's gloss on Bhagavadgita iv. 1, Manu is also called a ksatriya: see Muir, OST. i. 508. f RV. x. 72. 8, 9 we translate: s with seven of the eight sons which were born from Aditi she (Aditi) went to the gods; Martanda (vivas- vant) she threw aside. With seven sons Aditi came to the race of old v but Martan. d. a she brought to beget (the race of man), and on the other hand to death again (and again?).' The legen(l at (:B. iii. 1. 3. 3ff. is as follows: ' Now Aditi had eight sons. But those that are called ' the gods, the Xdityas ' (note the implication that Martanda is not a god) were seven; for the eighth, Martanda, she brought forth unformed he was a mere heap, as high as broad, some say of the size of a man. Then the gods, the Adityas, saying " What was born after us let it not be in vain * come, let us fashion it," fashioned him as man is fashioned. The flesh which they cut off and threw down became the elephant (' he with the hand, or trunk': note again the allusion to man); hence thsy say that one must not ace,ept as a gift an elephant, since the elephant has sprung from snan. Now he whom they had thus fashioned was Vivas- vant, the sun (Aditya). Of him came these creatures.' Cf. Muir, OST. iv.2 14; v.50, note; Eggeling, SBE. xxvi. 12ff.

His lluman character appears even more clearly in the circumstance that Manu, ' the man ' (cf. RV. i. 80..16; 112. 16; TS. iii. 1. 9. 4; 5JB. i. 8. 1. 1ff.) the plogeni- tor of the present race of men, is very early regarded as his son: manau vbrasrati, RV. viii. 52. 1 (Valakh. 4. l); r)adnter vctivaZ- vatcth, AV. viii. 10. 24. (cf. Nir. xii. 10; gB. xiii. 4. 3. 3, etc., below). The human element in Vivasvant's character manifests itself also directly in his connection with all sorts of sacrificial acts, especially the composition and promotion of prayers at the soma-sacrifice. At RV. ix. 99. 2 the pious thoughts of Vivasvant (the soma-hymn) urge the flow of the yellow soma: yad vivas- vato dhbyo harfriz hinvantt yatave: cf. also i. 1.89. 1; ix. 14. 5 (soma cleaned by Vivasvant's fingers). At viii. 6. 39 Indra is urged to take delight in the thought or invention of Vivasvant, i. e. either in his hymn or in the (soma-) sacrifice which he has devised: (indra) matsea vzeasuato matet.* Similarly i. 46. l3 The expression sadaze vivaseatah ' at the seat of Vivasvant; (RV. i. 53. 1; iii. .84. 7; 51. 3; x 12. 7; 75. 1) means in plain language 'in the place where the (soma-) sacrifice is performed, where the soma-songs are sung ':t see Grassmann s. v. vivadvat, a; Ludwig, Rig- Veda v. 77; Ehlli, Yana, p. 38, all of whom fol- low Sayana's rather bald rendering of vivasvs4tah by yajamanasya. Vivasvant is the typical sacrificer, and it is perhaps not accidental that Indra is the divinity to whom honor is shown most frequently at the seat of Vivasvant, since the sacrifice of Vivasvant and Vivanhao is the soma,: and-the soma is Indla's drink. Thus, i. 53. 1: pra mahe bharamahe gbra a,ndr&lt;tya sadctne vivaseatah; iii. 34. 7 :-vivexseatah scedane asyG/, (sc. a,q}drasya) tani vbprr&gt;, uk- theDhWh kavayo g.ncbnti; and iii. 51. 3: ,ndro .... viv&lt;zseatah sczdana *x, hb piprSye. At any rate, the supposition that the a-n- thropomorphic Vivasvant m:wy be viewed as a mortal in a story of evident cosmogonic character seems to be plausible, and the de- velopment of the story, according to our view, will tend to show that it furnishes the only possible explanation of the word mar- tyeDhyah in our passage. Saranyu presents Vivasvant with the tsins Yama and Yaml, but after this the feeling that she is the victim of a mesalliace gains ground more and more. The poet at Harivan§a 547 has a true sense of the situation when he says: bhavq ts rupena sci, 'tlesyad rupayauvanaSctlin§ ' Saranyu, endowed with beauty and youth, * Sayana: paricarax1avato yajamctnasya n1atyd. + Cf.

Possibly the story aims to convey a more special form of Saranyu's dissatisIeaction, which peeps out not only in her abandonment of her husband, but more clearly in her metamorphosis into a nlare: Vivasvant in his human capacity may have failed to satisfy the instincts of the goddess, which were probably laid out on too large a scale for his mortal capacities.* Without desiring to imply any genetic connection, we may bear in mind the prevalence of similar fea- tures in ancient novel-literature: e. g. in the story of Pasiphae and in the ovos of Lucian. At any rate, we need not hesitate to regard Saranyu's metamor- phosis iIltO a mare as an integral part of the story, even if the motive assigned turns out to be foreign to it; our theory that the version of the Rig-Veda is a brahmodya makes it more than natural that her change into a mare (apect) be left to be inferred from the designation of her second pair of twins as ' the horsemen (aSvin).' The course of the story accordingly is as follows: Since Saranyu does not approve of her husband, she makes her escape (nan- czga), and betakes herself to the gods, her natural associates, living there as a mare for the reasons indicated abolTe. By the aid of the gods she lived there unknown to Vivasvant and ner children by him. Therefore it is said that the gods hid away the im- mortal woman from her mortal relatives. To make her securer in her changed circumstances, they devise the sdvobrncz, which we have interpreted above as involving an intentional double sense: 'one like herself' and also 'one like (Vivasv-ant) in char- acter or class.' For the latter use of the word varna cf. dasaxrz varnarn at RV. ii. 12. 4; GDryasib v(rna?n at RV. iii. 34 9; asterydm varqbam at RV. ix. 71. 2; TB. i. 4. 7. 1; AB. vi. 36. 15. At RV. i. 104. 2 men speak of their varna, saying: te (sc. dercsso) na a vaksan s?svitaya varnasx ' may the gods lead our kind to prosper- ity.' At Gaut. xxviii. 40 and Ap. Dh. Su. ii. 13. 1; 27. 11 savarna is 'a woman of the same caste.' Yaska, gaunaka, and the later versions further report unanimously that the savarnas (chayc6 she is * I'he assumption of animal shapes on the part of the male and female principles in early cosmogonic stories is known elsewhere. At AB. iii. 83, Prajapati, intending to cohabit with his daughter Dyu or Usas, changes to a buck, while she becomes a female deer: tdm rfyo bhutva rohitam bSutdm abSydit. At (:B. xiv. 4. 2. 6ff. the female principle appears successively in the form of cow, mare, she-ass, she-goat, etc.; the male as bull, stallion, he-ass, goat, etc. So also PB. xi. 3. 5; aMvo vdi bhutvd prajdpatih prajd asriata; and gB. xiv. 1. 3. 25: 'thou (O earth) art the horse of Manu * for she, having become a mare, car- ried Manu; he is her husband, Prajapati.' Cf. also VS. xxxvii. 12. EIere also there seems to be a choice of animals of recognized produc- tivity. We may note in this connection that at RV. x. 68. tt the heavens are compared with a horses and at RV. x. 73. 10 Agni is said to be descended from a horse, which perhaps again is the heavens. Cf. also RV. ii. 35. 6, and Sayana ibid.

This, of collrse, harmonizes the statement at RV. viRi. 52. 1 (Valakh. 4. 1); AV. viii. 10. 24, that Manu was the son of Vivasvant, with that other more common one that Yama is the son of the same father. Now we must not fail to note that nevertheless Manu and Yama are scarcely ever mentioned together in tlle sawhitas- at least, so far as we are able to.find with the means at our control. In fact, AV. viii. 10. 23, 24, where it is stated rather loosely that Yama and Manu were the calves of the vir:tj, is the only passage, and that too of evident brethmaeza-character, of this sort in the sawhitsbs. The statements there are: tasy&lt;t, (sc. vir.ujah) yamo rc.eja vatsa erse,t; .... tasya man?r veztvaseato vatsa c;st,t. Nor are Yama and Manu associated flequently or intimately in the Brahmanas and Sutras. At AB. they occur together in the abAisecane,ya- stanza: yfbbAir indram abAyasincatprajcfpaltSh soma?n raja,nam varunai ,yan,m, rsa.anu,m: tethAir adbAir abAist,nca,mq, tvam aham, etc. At gB. xiii. 4. 3. 3-5; gqs. xvi. 2. 1-5; AgS. x. 7. 1-2, we have the statement, first, that Manu Vaivaqvata is the ruler of men; second, that Yama Vaivasvata is the ruler of the manes (manur vcbivaseato r(-Yja ta,sya m,a,nusyc6 vigah .... yamo vai- vaseato raja tasyapitaro vigah); this certainly implies that Manu and Yama are viewed as the childten of the same father Vivas- vant, and that they ale hoth intimately connected with the races of mortal man: cf. Mahabh. i. 3137, where this is stated explicitly. At TS. wi. 5. 6. 2 we have the incidental statement that the race of man is descended from Vivasvant: tato ve,vc6sean adityc3 Say- ata, tczsya va, iyczm,praje. yczn mcznttsyah; this naturally points to Manu as the intermediate progenitor. Of far greater impor- tance in determining the antiquity of the fable of Manu's descent from the savarnfl is the dctnast26ti at RV. x. 62. 8-11, in which a mcinuX .savarni or sc4varnya is praised for his generosity to the poet. Grassmann in his lexicon and ill his traslslation renders the word n2ctntz by ' man,' anci quietly assumes that savarnz and SCl- varya are deseendarlts of a man sclvarna: ' savarna-spross.'* Lud- wig in his translation ii. 390 rathel inconsistently translates nanu in st. 8 as a proper name, in st. 11 by 'man,' but at any rate he recognizes here, as also ill iii. 165-6; v. 308, the existence of one Manu Savarni or Savarnya.t The passages of importance for our theme are the following: pra n?nczmjc4yatam ayam man?s toDme cva rohattc (st. 8 a, b); s&lt;varyctsya daksinc4 v ^ s'^ndAur tva paprathe * The Pet. Lex. also has assumed this derivation for these two words and Muir OST. i2. 17, noten also fails to recognize the early existence of a Manu Savarni and his relation to the savarna of our passage. t Manu Savarni is the very designation under which the son of the chaya is known to the compilers of the Visnu-purana (iii. 2), of the Bhag. Pur. (Vi. 6. 89), and of the Mark. Pur. (106. 14) * also at Samvavijaya 12. 16 (Weber ibid. p. 721) the son of Samjna is called Savarni.</page><page sequence="38">180 91{.

We may lzegard it as certain that such a person as savarsza (mase.) never existed in Indian literature,t and it is ratller remarkable that all the author- ities have overlooked the evident relation of the patronymics to the savarnc6 of our riddle. The fact that some family of Mana- vast had this patronymic vouches for the existence of an original Manu Savarni, and points to this fable no less than the patrony: mic vccivaseata which is elsewhere applied to Manu.§ We need therefore not hesitate to regard the introduction of Manu in the later versions as an originally integral part of the story. The lXemainder of the story is that Vivasvant, becoming aware of the imposition which Saranyu had practiced upon him, also assumed the form of a holse, 'with qualities colresponding to hers (salaksanah, as (paunaka remarks significnantly).' And Sar- anyu ' approached him with the desire of sexual connection, which he gratified' (ibid.). From this sprang the 'Horsemen.' The foundation for this part of the story is laid securely in the pas- sages from the Brahmanas cited in the foot-note on p. 178; indeed, Vivasvant's pursllit is from the point of view of these legends the inevitable consequence of Saranyu's ilight. Likewose the origln of the A§vins flom the illtercourse of the metamorphosed pair, though it is reported in no other connection, must almost cer- tainly have suggested itself in connection with their name (aSvin: afra), from the very existence of this line of conceptions. And there is positively no ground for insisting that this suggestion did not come, or could not have come, even during the earliest period of the composition of the enantras.ll We have thus endeavored to place the legend out of which the riddle at RV. x. 17.12 was extracted upon the hroad ground of Vedic conceptions in general, and we believe the claim not an * Cf.

This view is supported by the mention in the next llymn, viii. 52. 1 (Valakh. t. 4), of Manu Vaivasvata.

As the chief difficulty in the way of such an interpretation has been regarded the existence of a some- what related cycle of conceptions which })resents the original cos- mic principle in the act of creating the inhabitants of the universe by incestuous itltercourse with his own daughter. Thus the question has arisen in sthe minds of the interpreters whether the marriage alluded to in the riddle dos3s not refer to the connection of Tvastar with his OWN daughter; this would lead to the identi- fieation of Tvastar and Vivasvant at RV. x. 17. l.* I believe however that the decisive rnoment ill this questioll can be found in the language of the two kinds of stories; the stories of Praja- pati's incest with his daughter exhibit an utter absence of all the *technical words indicative of Vedic lnarriage rites; the stories of the marriage of Prajapati's daughter almost always exhibit them. Thus, as regards the latter kind, we have e. g. at AB. iv. 7. 1 the expressions prc6yachcrt (cf. c6dad tt at RV. s. 85. 9, and pitrf6 prattdm 66de6ya, PGS. i. 4. 15), varex,h,, alld vahatuan; at KB. xviii. 1 we haveprctyachctt and uAyGlv^&lt;txayah (cf.

Kau§. 30. 17, note) the hyme is grouped along with AV. iv. 33 and vi. 21 as one designed for the purpose of destroying evil (pG6pmaAc6).* More precisely, the hymn is intended, as the re- frain clearly shows, not onlt to removc evil (V'k . . . papmanct V?&gt; yc6ksmena), but also to bring life (sc6sn (-ymSez) t Thus the hymn is divided into two parts, leaving the refrain out of the question: sts. 1-4, which pray for and emphasize separation from evil; sts. 6-l l, which contain prayers for endowment or junction with life. In stanzas 1-4 the preposition vb with the verb vrt$ either explessed or understood in the sense of ' turn away ' is the key- word; in stanzas 6-11 the preposition sctm with roots ctha and tr, either expressed or understoodX in the sense of ' etldow, join to,' is the leading word. Now the stanza under discussion (5) stands between these two unambiguolls divisions, alld the question arises which it belongs to. Weber unhesitatingly takes the view that st. o belongs to the first part: sc Die vv. t3. 4 enthalten Belege fur grtindliche Scheidung; .... es muss sornit auch unser Vers hie einen ahnlichen Inhalt haben (p. 310)." Accordingly he translates: " Tvastar schirrt der Tochter den Hochzeitzug an darob; stob die ganze Welt atlseinander " (ibid.). And on p. 3 l2 he says that the verse certainly exhibits horror of the vclhatu which Tvastar ar- ranges, because it involves a sin (palva). If our observation above that the passages describing cosmic incest ate totally de- void of technical marriage-words is of value, thetl we may ask for the reasons which have led Webel to a conclusion diametrically opposed to this consideration. Cannot stanza 5 belong to the class whicsh deal with the positive side of the hymn: endowment with life, etc.? VVeber does not state the reasons wllich have brought about his conclusion; I fail to see any other than the occurrence of the word vb in the stanza in question. This, to be sure? renders it externally more similar to sts. 1-4 than to 6-11; but the similarity is simply extertlal. The verb vb yfxti, no matter * Cf. also the statement of the Anukramam: . . . papmahadevatgclrn . . brahmci ?nena suktena tnantrokt48 devan?&amp;pzeclg7wno 'stciut. + Accordingly the hymn is also rubricated at Kauc3. 58. 3 in a list of hymns intended for (friendly) greeting; this list coincides largely with the ayusyayana, Ganamala 4 (cf. Kauc3. 54. ll, note), although the latter does not contain AV iii. 31. t Thus, not crt, as the printed text has it: see the Index Verborum. The manuscripts are unanimous.</page><page sequence="41">lyhe Barrzaye of Waranyu,. 183 how it be translated,* has nothing to do with the idea of separa- tion from evil expressed by vb with the root vrt understood in the first four stanzas. Weber's translation of the word by "aus ein- ander stieben " evidently corresponds to his theory, but it may be fairly questioned whether the mrord will at all bear this rerldering. The RV. has scim eti, and this also is the reading at AV. xviii. 1. 53, where the original stanza occurs in full. In the AV. vz ya is a z. Asy., occurring only in the passage under discussion; in the RV. the word never means 'go asunder,' as does vi i (e. g. x. 14.9 =AV. xviii. 1. 55; VS. sii.45; TS. iv. 2. 4. 1; TB. i.2. 1. 16; TA. i. 27. 5; vi. 6. 1 ); but it is transitive, and means ' pass through.' Thus, i. 39. 3, vb yathana uan^Reah prthivya vy apah parvatanam; i. 86. 10, tamo v'^ yctta; i. 116. 20, vs pa,rvatc6n . . . ayatam; i. 1]7. 16, vb .... yfl,yathuh seenv ctdreh; i. 140. 9, yativs jrc6yah; iii. 31.19, dru,ho vs yats bahula adev?,h; vi. 12. 6, vs yass duchAna; vi. 62. 7, vs .... yatam adriws; -i. 66. 7, vs rddass yats; viii. 7. 23, vs vrtecbrn .... yay?r vs parvatan; viii. 73. 13, yo vc6m rezjc^cnsy aveina ratho vsyctti; ix. 91. 3, s?i,'ro dnvam vs yati; x. 32. 2, vi&gt;+ndra ytsi divyft,nt rocanc-t. Thele is no other case of vi ycz in the RV. At MS. i. lO. 14 _ Kath. S. 36. 8 = Nirukta v. 5 the word is also transitive: tccm (sc. vrtrcem) rnarW6tah Acsurcipavincz vy dyuh; at (7B. xii. 4. 1. 2, 3 the word is also transitive and means 'pass through' and not 'go apart': sa yadi hsz 'sya 'py antare-na gr(zmo 'gnbn viyaycst. Resting npon such testimony, one may venture to say that vs ya in the Veda does not mean ' go away, turn aside,' ete.,t and therefore perhaps both the Pet. Lexicons remark that vt yetti at AV. iii. 31. 5 is probably a corrupt reading. If any value at all is to be at- tached to this AV. reading, we may surmise that vb has crept in from the other stanzas in the place of sam; in the four preceding stanzas including the refrains vb occurs no less than 16 times * if we add the remaining refrains, it occurs altogether 30 times in the hymn. Or if, on the other halld, we assume that vb in the body of stanza 5 is intentional, the passage its 'dam vpram bhAvananz vb yczts would seem to mean ' thus knowing (or hear- ing) he (VivasYant, or perhaps Tvastar himself) t passes through * We may indeed question whether any importance at all is to be attached to this variant; the AV. poet tnay have worked in the half- verse out of the old legend in a pure]y fantastic, nay nonsensical fash- ion; the entire hymn iS largely conjurer's hodge-podge.

At any rate it seems clear that Weber's theory that the passage expresses the horrified dispersion of the inhab- itants of the universe is not supported by the ordinary meaning of vb yati. On the other hand, there is, so far as can be seen, nothing to prevent us from regarding st. 5 as the opening of the auspicious part of the hymn. The mention of Tvastar, the fash- ioner of creatures and of visible shapes, the creator of the world, by itself renders the passage applicable to a charm for the pro- duction or continuation of life. The cosmogonic character of the passage as a whole, the allusion to the production of Yama, Manu, and the Agvins, seem to me to point the same way.t It is to be regretted that there is no record of any kind of action in connection with RV. x. 17. 1, 2 in the Sutras or Brah- manas of the Rig-Veda. In the AV. the two stanzas occur sep- arately in the funeral-mantras, as xviii. 1. 53; 2. 33; they are employed neither in the Kallgika, the Vaitana, nor any of the AV. Parigistas. It would be useless to surmise at what point in the funeralpractices the stanzas were recited at least, prior to a complete investigation of the brahmodya-material of the Vedas. Many a hymn and part of a hymn will turn out to be of this character. Thus it seeXms to me quite certain that the so-called hiranyagarbha-hymn, RY. x. 121 = AV. iv. 2 = VS. x. 20; xii. 102; xiii. 4; xxiii. 3; xxv. 12, 13; xxvii. 25, 26; xxxii. 6, 7 = TS. ii. 2. 12; iv. 1. 8; vii. 5. 16, 17 = MS. ii. 13. 23 is a brahmodya, whi-ch does not in leality ask for information in its refrain kdsna&amp;t devaya havssct vidhema, but puts well-known theological dogmas into this favorite form. There is primarily no god Hiranyagar- bha,t and no god Ka, as Ludwig (Sig- Vedes ii. 575) assumes; the hymn is a brcchnxodyKr,, every stanza of which states evident qual- ities of Prajapati, and then asks ' who is the god characterized by these qualities ?' In the last stanza, RV. x. 121. 10, the answer is given: ' Prajapati.' But there is nothing xkeptical and nothing inquisitive in all this; every one knows, both the questioller and the hearer. And so I wollld now assume that the famous cos- mogonic hymn RV. x. 129 is not a skeptical inquiry, but a brah- modya, which has in mind an answer to every question it puts. Here also it will appear more and more that the hymnal litera- ture of the Vedas is connected with action, and was not composed to still any independent literary demands; the brahntodya is an adjunct to the liturgy; and, but for the habit of instituting these doctrinal or theological ' quizzes,' as we might call them, at the end of solemn sacrifices, we should have in all probability lost the earliest traces of Hindu systematic theology. * By the svay, the stanzas following, AV. ii;. 3l. 6-10, are also con- structed out of ideas which are frequently worked up in the brahmodya: cf. e. g. VS. xxiii. 9. a2, and elsewhere. + So Sayana at RV. x. 121. 1, quite correctly: htranyagarbho htran- 184 yamayasya 'ndasya garbhabhuta7.^ prajapattr hiranyagarbbclh.  X.

Y.lska, Nir. xii. 11, says: rexrtir adityasya "dit- yodclye 'ntardhuyate 'night vanishes at sunrise.' There is nothing more in this tllan the later stereotyped equation vzeasrant = aditya ' the sun.' Naturally, if there is something which vanishes when the sun appears upon the scene, that something is night; thus reasons Yilska. Western scholars also have not hesitated to subject the passage to direct ulythological analysis, assuming that the story it told was bllt the veiled anthlopomorphic version of a series of natural phenomena. Roth, ZDMG. iv. 425, regards Saranyu, 'the hurrying, impetuous olle,' as the dark storm-cloud which hovers in space at the beginning of things. Tvastar, the creator, unites her to Vivasvant 'the shining one,' the light on high. Now light and the darklless of the storm-cloud ploduce two pairs. Then chaotic darkness vanishes, i. e. the gods hide her (in the tale), and Vivasvant is left with a savarnccX ' a similar one'; his sprouse is a nameless indefinable something: i. e. the myth is at a loss to assign allother wife to him. Ad. Kuhn, in KZ. i. 444, accepts Roth's interpretation of Saranyu as the storm- cloud, but, after having identified Tvastar with Vivasvant accord- ing to the theory of cosmical incest which we have endeavored to discredit (above, p. 181 fE.), regaYds Vivasvant as the sun which hides behind the clouds: i. e. utlites with the cloud in wedlock (p. 449), producing two pairs, Yama and Yaml, lightning and thun- der (p. 450), and the A§vins, Agni and Indra (p. 451). Other mythological interpretations are furnished by Mviller, Lectz6res, Second Series, p. 502 = o29; -v28 = 556; Myriantheus, I)ie Ap- vgns, p. a6 fE.; Bergaigne, La P¢eligion Vediqee, ii. 98, 318, 506-7; Ludwig, Rig-Vedb6, iii. 332; v. 391; Ehni, Yama, pp. 20, .54. Our attitude towards the passage renders it unnecessary, in fact superKuous, to enter into a detailed presentation or discussion of all these views. We do not believe that the legend which we have endeavored to restore from the brahnsodya and the narrative versions represent either one single natural event or a chain of natural events, clc)thed in anthropomorphic language. Mytho- logically we believe that the passage has been taken too much azu grand sEriev. It is a prime need of mythological investigation, and one which has certainly been neglected in the past, to draw a sharp line of demarcation between the primary attributes of a mythological personage which furnish the causes of the personifi- cation, and the attributes and events which are assigned, or are supposed to happen, after the anthropomorphosis has been com- pleted. He who would search for the primary qualities of the Greek Zev5, as expressed e. g. in the formula se6b Jove,frsgido, in every action and attribute of the Homeric Zev5 necessarily errs; his error is likely to be as great at some points as is his who would look for naturalistic events and physical phenomena in the actions of the Hellenic gods in a play of Euripides, where the gods are afflicted with all the passions and weaknesses of mortal</page><page sequence="44">186 Jl. BloornfleldS, men. Yet he who refuses to mythologize on the basis of Eurip- ides' presentation need not therefore be skeptical about the naturalistic origin of the majority of the Greek gods; he may be willing at the right time and in the right stage of the history of any myth to point out the physical factors and the physical events which gave it a start. But he will be wise to remember that as soon as the anthropomorphosis has crystallized, as soon as a person has taken the place of a natural force, as soon as a legend has taken the place of a natulal event, then the person and the legend become parts of the inventory in the possession of those of the people who are endowed with fancy, with creative imagination, and the desire to tell in captivating words their individual con- ceits to willing and delighted listeners. Then these persons take by the haild other persons, and these legends interlace with other legends, derived perhaps flom totally different sources, and all that is then produced is no longer fitting material for mytholog- ical analysis. The disregard of these simple considerations has rendered futile many attempts at mytllological explanation in the Vedas. The Indian STairuktas and Aitihasikas, and after them the commentators, never hesitate to urge the primary naturalistic conceptions thich they have established somewhere or other, correctly or incorrectly, through every legend which they have occasion to present. Western interpreters have by no means permitted themselves to accept their particular versions without question-they are, indeed, at times as palpably untenable or ab- surd as their etymologies-but they have largely fallen into their error of making pretty nearly every legendary narrative the cor- pus vsle of naturalistic anatomy. Thus, as regards the story of Saranyu, we do not deny the unity of the legend as- conceived by its author, but we do most firmly believe that it was constructed) or, perhaps better, glued or soldered together, by him out of a stock of conceptions derived from a considerable variety of sources, and conceived originally at different times and in different connections. The marriage which Tvastar institutes for his daughter comes unquestionably from that eycle of primary cosmogonic conceptions which tell of either the marriage or the incest of a female divinity: Surya, RV. x. 85. 9, 13; KB. sviii. 1; Surya Savitrl, AB. iv. 7. 1; Usas, PB. viii. 2. 10; Usas or Dyu, AB. iii. 33. 1; daughter of Prajapati, RV. x. 61. 7 ; TS. ii. 3. 10. 1 ; AB. iii. 33. 1 ; (7B. i. 7. 4. 1. Ac- cordingly it seerts most likely that Sarallyu is in fact identical with Surya or Usas ;* whatever may turn out to be the funda- mental conception of their marriage will also in all likelihood include the case of Saranyu-Erinnys. On the other hand, the introduction of Vivasvantt and his children Yama and Yaml and * Here belongs, therefore, according to Ad.

It seems under- taken solely for the purpose of applying cosmogonic notions to various legendary accounts of the origin of man, and it seems to me utterly useless to associate any natural phenomena with either of the last three personages. Yama and Yaml are the primeval twins,* while qnanec, the Indo-European word for ' tnan,' by a natural hypostasis furnishes a legendary Manu, who like Yama has also been associated with Vivasvant, and who also naturally claims a nook in the edifice of the story which has previously given shelter to these worthies. The presellce of Manu in the story may again have suggested the propriety of nreaving in the legend of the savarne7,, which is likely enough to have had an indepelldent ex- istence elsewhere.t Once again, the legellds about cosmical incest contain the feature of the change of the female principle into an animal, followed by a corresponding change of the male,t and it is natural enough that this also should find a place in the story. Finally, the change of Saranyu and Vivasvant into horses sug- gests the A§vins, and they ale duly incorporated as their children; this feature of the story is of a saliency the more captivatin alike to the poet and his hearers as the Agvins are twins, and Saranyu and Vivasvallt have heen previously blessed with the twins Yama and Yaml. We are far from claiming that the stratification of the materials as placed by us necessarily accords in manner or chrono]ogical order with the facts in the case; all we hope to establish is the exceeding variety of the lnaterials, and the uselessness of any attempt to see in them a chain of connected natural phenomena or events. The degree of probability which attaches to any single naturalistic explanation is certaiIlly, as every one will admit, ill an inverse ratio to the number and variety of these explanations advanced for a given case; in this instance they ale indeed very numerous; exTery scholar llas a new one. These remarks, mt6tatis mutasnctzs, apply to many Vedic myths, or for that matter to the study of mythologv in general; the amount of energy which has been expended upon the unravel- ing of secondary legends full of individnal fancies and paradoxes has been vast, and we believe out of all proportion to the value of the results obtained. The course which I have followed in the explanation of RV. x. 17. 1-2 is briefly as follows: At the base of the passage is a * Thus Roth, as early as 1850 (ZDMG. iv. 42£}). Forty years later Ehni Yama, pp. 42 ff., 163, finds it necessary to add one more sun-god to the glutted market. Yama is the god of the day-sun and the ' night-sun." t The origin of the entire legend of a savarna may perhaps be looked for in a universal Manu or man who shares the kind (caste) or varna of all men. He would be sa-varna with all men; such a conception may have furnished the basis for a person Manu Savarni or SavarnyM a metronymic from a supposed savarna, and a pendant to the patro- nymic Vaivasvata. Now the flood-gates of fancy are opened wide in the effort to nlake the savarna and Vivasvant man and wife. t This feature of the story is also of pre-Vedic origin, as it occurs in the legend at Pausanias viii. 25; see Kuhn, ibid.</page><page sequence="46">188 X. BI&gt;oomfelod. legend. of a distinctly composite character which has combined with considerable fancy a number of mythological and legendarisr points into a single story. This story must have been well known to the Vedic poets: first, because all later reports of it are essen- tially unanimous; secondly, because it was sufficiently familiar to justify its embodiment into the condensed form of a brahmodya or riddle. The StOl'y seems to be as follows: Tvastar ofers his daughter Saranyu in marriage to the whole world of gods and mortals, and the suitor who seems to have gained favor in his eyes is Vivasvant, the mortal. Salanyu, barely married, is dis- pleased with Vivasvant, and flees from him, giving birth however to the twins Yama and Yaml, the reputed children of Vivasvant. In order to make secure her escape she changes into a mare and resolts to the gods, who hide her away from the mortals Vivas- vant, Yarna, and Yaull; and, in order to make matters still more safe, they construct a savarac6 which takes Saranyu's place in Vivasvant's affections. The word savarna means at the same time one who is like Saranyu in appearance,, i. e. her double, and also one who is suitable in her character to the rnortal Vivasvant - more suitable than the divine Saranyu, we may perhaps under- stand. Vivasvant begets Manu with the savarna, but ultitnately iinds out the deception practised upon him, follows Saransru in the form of a horse, and thus gaining hel favor, begets with her the Agvins, sthe horsemen.' Saranyu abandons them also, just as she had previously abandoned the twins Yama and Yaml, and resumes, we may understand, her independent statzon as a divinity.</page></plain_text>
