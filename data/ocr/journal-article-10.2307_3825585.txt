<plain_text><page sequence="1">Morse Peckham DARWINISM AND DARWINISTICISM VERYONE KNOWS THAT THE IMPACT of the Origin of Species was immense and that it has had a profound influence upon the lit- &lt;! erature of England and of the West ever since that late November day in 1859. But when one tries to tally up the writers affected and to list the books and make an inventory of passages showing Darwinian in- fluence and Darwinian assumptions in novels, poems, and essays, a fog seems to arise in one's mind, through which are discernible twinkles of what may or may not be bits of genuine Darwinism. Indeed, here is the first problem. What is Darwinism? Or at least, what is the Darwinism found in the Origin, for that alone is the Dar- winism with which I am here concerned. The name of Darwin has magnetized to itself a thousand bits and pieces of ideas which are cer- tainly not be found in the book itself, and some of which Darwin, had he been able to understand them, would certainly have repudiated. For ex- ample, it has been said a million times and will be said a million times more that for Darwin competition between species and members of spe- SEPTEMBER 1959</page><page sequence="2">Morse Peckham cies is the only mechanism of directive and progressive evolution. Thus he has been adulated for having revealed that in capitalism and its re- lated and derived values was to be found the natural system of social and economic organization which assures the progress of man; and ex- ecrated for having led men to disbelieve the seemingly obvious truth that man's proper, natural, and normal mode of behavior is cooperation, harmony, and love. Again, it is always being rediscovered that in natural selection there are cooperative as well as competitive mechanisms at work. Alternatively, it is frequently stated that Darwin failed to perceive the element of cooperation because he was himself the product of a laissez-faire society: Marxists are particularly grand and imposing on the subject. In this one example are to be found the typical confusions ob- servable in many discussions of Darwinism carried on by non-scientists and even by scientists when they are not scientizing. First, there is by the very use of the terms an introduction of values into a descriptive con- struct; or the misinterpretation of descriptive terms by ascribing to the words a moral significance and to the author a moral intention. The roots of this error are to be found in the ancient exhortation that Nature should be our basic model for Right Behavior. Not surprisingly it is constantly assumed that the Origin rests on moral assumptions: that a value state- ment may be verified in the same way that an empiricial or predictive statement is verified is an attitude that only a small fraction of human beings have yet outgrown, and that in only a small part of their behavior. The difficulty arose because Darwin did not have the word "ecology." He was in fact an ecological thinker, and in ecology words like "compe- tition" and "cooperation" are too inexact, too value-weighted, too meta- phorical, and too anthropomorphic to be used at all. Second, scientific statements are continuously subjected not only to moral interpretations but also, and more subtly, to metaphysical in- terpretations. Hence, the unconscious ascription to the Origin of a meta- physic. Darwin is said to have discovered the Law of Evolution, accord- ing to which the universe is characterized by a steady growth in richness and complexity and excellence. Now Spencer formulated a Law of Evo- lution, but there is no such law in the Origin. In fact, in the fourth edition there is a brief but profoundly important passage at the beginning of Chapter Four in which Darwin specifically disclaims any knowledge of and any statements about Laws of Nature, which he clearly labels men- tal conveniences, or constructs. He is a scientist, not a moralist and not a metaphysician, and he knows it. Unfortunately, most humanists then and now have little notion of what a scientist is and does. They are in- VICTORIAN STUDIES 20</page><page sequence="3">DARWINISM AND DARWINISTICISM terested in metaphysics and morals, and when a science seems to have a metaphysical and moral implication, or when a scientist assumes another role and makes metaphysical and moral statements, then only do they evince an interest and subject themselves to what they think are sci- entific influences.* It will be apparent from what I have said so far that the problem of the impact of the Origin upon the culture of the last one hundred years is a complex one. It involves, above all, the question, what is the dif- ference between "Darwinian" and "Darwinistic" (that is, between those propositions and implied assumptions which may be properly ascribed to a source in the Origin, and those propositions and derived assump- tions which are not properly so ascribed). I shall attempt to clear the way for future studies of the Origin and literature, using "literature" generally and loosely. The question to be answered, then, is, what was the Darwinian and Darwinistic impact of the Origin upon Western culture? But even this is much too vague. How is the culture of the past available and what do we mean by "culture"? It is said that historical investigation is con- cerned with the events of the past. But of course past events are not ob- servable, and so we are left with the question as to what in fact the his- torian observes. The problem may be put somewhat crudely, though I think not naively, tackled by observing what the historian actually does. He is engaged in the manipulation (with all that the word implies) of documents and artifacts. These are his data, not past events. The empiri- cal referent of his "History," that is, his construct which purports to refer to the events of the past, or "history," is his own operations with those documents and artifacts which he assumes to have had an existence prior to the moment he began examining them. His History is a linguistic construct, characterized by what he hopes is at least an intuitive con- sistence, designed to justify his work. Since internal inconsistencies are always discoverable in his construct, and since his collection of docu- * The question of the influence of the Origin hangs on not merely, what is Darwinism? or, what is the Darwinism of the Origin? but also on what is the Darwinism to be found in which edition of the Origin? In my recent variorum text of the work are to be found be- tween fifteen and twenty thousand individual variants, or well over seven thousand sentence variants, a sentence variant ranging from the exclusion or addition of a sentence to a minor and apparently non-semantic change in punctuation. The majority of these are probably of not very great importance, but there are thousands of sentence variants of crucial significance. The collation of these variants reveals how difficult the question of Darwinian influence really is, but at least in the future it will be possible to find out if Darwin really made a statement ascribed to him. SEPTEMBER 1959 21</page><page sequence="4">Morse Peckham ments and artifacts is never complete, nor its degree of completeness ever known, History, like any science, is characterized by instability. (Like physics, it is always being reconstructed.) Thus the process of historiography is the consequence of a continuous interaction, manip- ulated by historians, between construct and data. One particular problem remains:* what is the model of the his- torian's construct. Such models certainly are now, and perhaps always will be, intuitive. At least I know of no mathematical or logical model for a historical narrative. But though models for battles, parliamentary de- bates, and assassinations are probably pretty reliable, those for cultural history are probably not. In cultural history we are involved with matters of extraordinary difficulty and subtlety. Whereas the assassina- tion of Lincoln was eminently observable at one time (there were witnesses; a reasonably consistent construct may be created of his murder and death), a priest may lose his religious belief and nobody be the wiser (Pater thought he could have a successful career as an An- glican clergyman with no religious belief whatsoever, and he was prob- ably right). The difficulty lies in the fact that the locus of cultural history is covert behavior. When we realize that there is no such entity as "cul- ture" but only human beings doing something, or behaving covertly, and that such behavior may or may not leave traces in documents and artifacts, the general problem of the inaccessibility of the past is twice compounded; for cultural behavior is not necessarily observable even when it is going on in a human being who is right before the observer's eyes or even at times, when it is going on inside the observer. When we talk about "culture" in the old-fashioned way, or "high-level culture" in the modern way, we are referring somewhat vaguely to two kinds of data, first, recorded verbal behavior, sufficiently complex and highly- valued to be called literature, philosophy, or science, and recorded sign- systems of a parallel complexity which we call the visual and auditory * Another question is more easily answered and is less important to the problem of this essay, for the historian derives from his construct certain propositions which purport to predict where certain documents and artifacts may be found and what will characterize them when they are found. Thus a construct led me once to predict that certain unidenti- fied watercolor illustrations to Milton would be found to have been prepared between 1790 and 1810 for copper-engravings to illustrate an edition of Paradise Lost. An ex- amination of such editions led to the discovery of one with such engravings and with the name of the artist. An intuitive construct of stylistic history had led me to predict that they had been done about 1800, and according to bibliographical information derived from the engravings themselves they could be dated in 1797 and 1798. Finally an in- tuitive model of the behavior of artists and publishers led me to conclude that the water- colors had not been done more than three or four years before the date of first publication. VICTORIAN STUDIES 22</page><page sequence="5">DARWINISM AND DARWINISTICISM arts, and, second, unrecorded and covert linguistic and aesthetic semiotic behavior. On the model of our own behavior, insofar as we can and have trained ourselves to observe it, aided by various admittedly inadequate personality or psychological theories, we try to write cultural history. Now, we know very little about cultural transmission and cultural in- novation at any level, let alone complex high-level transmission and inno- vation. It is not surprising that when we undertake to write cultural history we finish feeling a bit baffled and inadequate. At least, however, we can now see our basic problem somewhat more precisely. On the one hand there are the Darwinian and Darwin- istic documents, on the other, documents and artifacts which show Darwinian and Darwinistic influences, and in between, causally, we hope or assume for constructive purposes, connecting the two categories, a doubly inaccessible process of cultural history of which we wish to make a construct. But, alas! each part of the problem consists of a set of variables. For instance, a single Darwinistic sentence might have had a profoundly revolutionary impact upon the covert behavior of an indi- vidual, with the consequence that he wrote a single poem profoundly different from anything he had written before. (Did this happen in the case of Swinburne's "Hertha"?) Or a reading of the entire Origin might have had a slight impact which resulted, for the moment, at least, in a fairly brief document. (Was this the case of Kingsley's famous letter which Darwin was so happy to quote in later editions in order to avert the theological lightning?) Or a very thorough reading of Darwinian and Darwinistic material might so confirm the already existing attitudes of an individual that he perceived nothing innovative. (Was this the case with Browning, whose post-Origin work indicates that he not only read Darwin but read him with such extreme care that frequent re-reading is implied?) To analyze this range of variables is the next task. I have already given one example of a fairly notorious confusion between Darwinism and Darwinisticism. I wish now to treat this prob- lem more extensively, and particularly to indicate how the two came to be confused. I shall begin with one of the biggest questions, evolution itself. Evolution may be considered as a fairly straightforward meta- physical theory with a long history which was not so much confirmed by the theory of natural selection as embarrassed by it. The difference between the two is indicated by the fact that Darwin himself did not use the word until the fifth edition of the Origin (1869), and then he ap- pears to have used it with some hesitation, almost as if he did not quite know what he was talking about. And no wonder. I have called it a SEPTEMBER 1959 23</page><page sequence="6">Morse Peckham metaphysical term, because it purports to make certain descriptive propositions about the structure of the universe. One way to indicate its significance is to employ a metaphysical distinction between appear- ance and reality and their relation to permanence and change. Accord- ing to a non-evolutionary metaphysic the changes which we observe are only apparent; the reality of things lies in their permanence. The exalted status of Platonism in the Western tradition, both in theology and out of it, was one of the principal reinforcements of a non-evolutionary metaphysic. In his recent intellectual autobiography, My Philosophical Development, Bertrand Russell has related how his early interest in mathematics was stimulated by a desire to penetrate a world of ideal permanence and perfection and he admits that he still has a certain re- gret that Wittgenstein persuaded him that mathematics and logic are tautological and do not refer to any such ideal realm. But Yeats, Rus- sell's contemporary, and the hard-headed and profoundly anti-meta- physical Nietzsche toyed with eternal recurrence, though how seriously they wished us to take them presents an apparently unresolved problem for their commentators. All of these men were post-Origin, and they all evince the distress which resulted from the apparent confirmation of metaphysical evolutionism by the scientific construct of natural selec- tion. For according to a metaphysic of evolution, the appearance lies in permanence, the reality lies in change. The permanence of things, whether houses or social institutions, is only a function of the fact that they change more slowly than we the observers do. But the difference between evolution and a Heraclitean doctrine that all things are a flowing lies in the proposition that evolution is directive. As I have indi- cated above, the claim that natural selection works in an orthogenetic or teleological fashion is an application to Darwinism of the already ex- istent and widespread notion that the laws of nature direct the course of events to move towards a higher, purer, better state of affairs. I have encountered in recent years a theology which claims that the history of the universe is the history of God ridding himself and his creation of evil, and that the purpose of man's existence is to help God in this sub- lime task. Hegel is, of course, the figure whom everyone thinks of in con- nection with metaphysical evolution, and "One far-off, divine event/ Towards which the whole creation moves," the lines that everyone quotes. But the concept is ubiquitous in the earlier nineteenth century. It seems, at first glance, almost impossible that Browning could have VICTORIAN STUDIES 24</page><page sequence="7">DARWINISM AND DARWINISTICISM written Paracelsus' great final speech a quarter of a century before the Origin. In the cancelled stanzas of the "Palace of Art,"* written even earlier, Tennyson applied metaphysical evolutionism to the data of sci- ence, specifically astronomy and geology. It is implicit in Carlyle's theory of history, in which each inorganic period is less inorganic than the preceding one, and each organic period more thoroughly organized than its corresponding predecessor- an idea which seems to inform The Idylls of the King, the first installment of which came out in the same year as the Origin. Newman has both the notion of progressive revelation and, of course, of the growth of doctrine. The two essential ideas of metaphysical evolutionism are that the world is an emergent world, with novelty continually being introduced from outside or coming into existence by the nature of the evolutionary process, and that it is an irreversible and a non-repetitive world; evolu- tion has direction. Even before Darwin, as Tennyson's stanzas suggest, there had been apparently scientific substantiations of the evolutionary meta- physic. Ever since 1839, J. P. Nichol, the astronomer, had been writing and re-writing a whole series of books popularizing astronomy. Over and over again, basing his conclusions on the nebular observations of the younger Herschel, he had painted a picture of a universe in the process of creation and in 1855 had used the word "evolution" to describe it. It is hardly necessary to point out how Lyell gave apparent confirmation to the notion at the geological level. Yet the evolutionary metaphysic is not necessarily or logically connected with scientific constructs about the biologic past. The term, "the development hypothesis," which was employed throughout the century until in the 186o's "evolution" took its place, is considerably more descriptive and relatively free from the metaphysical implications of "evolution." To understand what happened, it is necessary to keep the dis- tinction between the two quite clear. The development hypothesis was a scientific hypothesis concerned with the problem of how biological species originate.

SEPTEMBER 1959 25</page><page sequence="8">Morse Peckham or other develop out of already existent species? As early as 1827 Lyell wrote in a private letter that he believed the latter, but since he had no explanation of how it could have happened, he had to use, in his great Geology, the theory of special creation. The scientists were of course perfectly aware of the implications, for contemporary theologians, of denying the theory of special creation, and they had no desire to get into trouble unless for a good scientific cause. Hence their lack of interest in Chambers' Vestiges of Creation, and even annoyance with it, for it aroused theological fury to no good scientific purpose, simply substitut- ing one metaphysic for another. What was above all necessary was a scientific explanation of what a great many scientists were quite pre- pared to accept, the origin of species from pre-existing species. The crux of the matter is revealed by comparing Spencer's essays and books with the Origin. In his introduction to the General Principles Spencer complained that Darwin had received credit for establishing biologic evolution, although, in fact, he had already revealed the truth several years before. And of course a great many people, particularly in the United States, believed him. Yet Spencer has all but disappeared from contemporary culture while the current scientific theory of bi- ological evolution still has a firm, if partial, place for Darwin's theory of natural selection and admits and insists that the Origin was the founda- tion for all subsequent work. Scientifically, Spencer's theories on the subject were of no importance; they were entirely metaphysical, more complicated than Chambers' but not less naive. Spencer uttered a Law of Evolution; Darwin proposed a theory of the origin of species from pre-existent species. In the later chapters of his Great Chain of Being, A. O. Lovejoy has shown how metaphysical evolutionism emerged from a kind of static, Platonic thinking which had dominated the Western mind for over two millenia. In my "Towards a Theory of Romanticism" (PMLA, LXVI [1951], 5-23), I attempted to show some of the cultural forces respon- sible for that shift in metaphysics. Using the argument of that essay, and developing it further, I should like here to suggest how the evolutionary metaphysic, although it had an unimportant previous existence, was accepted and developed in the early nineteenth century. To use the terminology of that article, the "Negative Romantic" was left without any metaphysic and without any theoretic basis for morality. In his isolated state he was thrown back upon himself. But since it is extremely difficult to maintain a total spiritual death for a very long period, some of the Negative Romantics simply returned to former beliefs. But others turned to a new metaphysic, which in its many forms VICTORIAN STUDIES 26</page><page sequence="9">DARWINISM AND DARWINISTICISM can be generally subsumed under the rubric of Evolutionism as I have defined it above. In this process of recovery there were usually two stages. First came the stripping bare of the self, the discovery of the ego as the basic datum of experience. That revelation is one of the principle themes of works as various as the Prelude, the Ancient Mariner, Sartor Resartus, the paintings of Constable after 18o8, of Caspar David Fried- rich beginning about the same time, and of Turner after 1827. It is the subject of Berlioz's Harold in Italy and of Schumann's piano cycles of the 1830's. It is the theme of The Red and the Black and even, faintly enough, Rob Roy. This discovery of a basic datum, however, was not sufficient. It had to be connected with the rest of the world; the problem of how to get from the self to the world remained to be solved. For its solution there was only the data of the self and its experiences, of which now the most important event was the recovery or rebirth consequent upon the dis- covery of the self. If the self is the model of the world, and if the process of the self in moving from negation to affirmation is its essential char- acter, it then followed that the character of the world is not merely process but process directed toward a goal. The weakness of this position was precisely in assuming that the self was a model of the world; but that assumption could be and was easily overlooked, for Western culture was filled with all sorts of notions which would provide the bridge between self and world. Hence the mental construct by which the processes of the personality were or- ganized under the terms "self" or "ego" or "Ich" or "I" was projected upon the experienced world, and as Coleridge put it, the act was sub- stituted for the fact. The tremendous emotional force behind this pro- jection made it easy to find its confirmation, first, in already existent evolutionary metaphysics, and second, in apparent scientific confirma- tions of evolutionary metaphysics. The total development is perhaps most clearly outlined in Paracelsus, which reveals Browning as a man who grasped the romantic culture of his century with astonishing pro- fundity. Hence it is no accident that the conclusion of the poem* sounds like an anticipation of Darwin - to one who has not really understood the Origin. * Paracelsus describes the formation of the surface of the earth, then the coming of vegeta- tion, insects, birds, land-animals, and he continues: Thus he [God] dwells in all, From life's minute beginnings, up at last To man - the consummation of this scheme Of being, the cc mpletion of this sphere SEPTEMBER 1959 27</page><page sequence="10">Morse Peckham In 1859 a metaphysic of goal-directed organic growth was dom- inant in the higher levels of Western culture. Canon Raven has pointed out that the agitation produced by Darwin can not be understood with- out reference to the Essays and Reviews, which appeared only a few months after, or to Colenso's work, which appeared in 1862. The aca- demic difficulties of Max Miiller and of Benjamin Jowett are equally inseparable from the total situation. Today it is somewhat difficult to understand why all of these books and events should have been inter- connected in the covert culture of the day. But a reading of Essays and Reviews shows the deep penetration of metaphysical evolutionism into the minds of its authors. That was their offense: they were addressing a world of a lower cultural level which still lived by a static metaphysic. I have referred to Newman's speculation about the possibility of apply- ing his ideas of development to the biological world, and he has been praised for his profundity in thus anticipating and understanding Dar- win. But the praise has come from individuals who did not themselves understand Darwin, for in fact the Origin was an embarrassment to the metaphysical evolutionists. The evolutionists were already used to having their metaphysic apparently confirmed by scientific developments. Lyell and Herschel and Nichol seemed to support them, and they took the Vestiges of Crea- tion to be a scientific work. Consequently, there is no indication that the Origin disturbed Tennyson, for example, or Newman, or George Eliot. "Hertha," again, is a good example. Written in the latter half of the 186o's, it appears to be a perfect instance of the impact of Darwin. Yet it can just as well be thought of as a humanistic and anti-religious interpreta- tion of the concluding speech of Paracelsus. It could have been written had the Origin never been published. That it was written as a conse- quence of the Origin seems highly probable, but as a consequence of a misunderstanding of the Origin. For the biologic world that Darwin revealed, if you do not read him with the assumptions of metaphysical evolutionism as instruments for understanding the book, is a world to- tally lacking in the organized and teleological process characteristic of Of life: whose attributes had here and there Been scattered o'er the visible world before, Asking to be combined, dim fragments meant To be united in some wondrous whole, Imperfect qualities throughout creation, Suggesting some one creature yet to make, Some point where all those scattered rays should meet Convergent in the faculties of man. VICTORIAN STUDIES 28</page><page sequence="11">DARWINISM AND DARWINISTICISM evolutionary metaphysics. New species come into existence by a process which can only be described as accidental. If a species has a range of variations among its individuals such that when the environment of the species changes, hitherto non-adaptive variations are selected as means of survival, a new species will in the course of time emerge, provided that the change in environment is not so great as to cause the total ex- tinction of the species and provided that the population of the species is sufficient to maintain itself during the period of the development of the new species out of the old. No organism, Darwin said, is as perfectly adapted as it might be. That is, it includes within its population instincts and organs which are not instrumental to its environmental adaptation, although in its ancestry at some time or other such organs and instincts were adaptive. (To be sure, Darwin was not very certain about this and proposed other reasons, particularly morphology, for non-adaptive or- gans. ) Further, there are numerous instances not only of extinction but of total or partial regression, or regression at some stage of an organism's life-cycle. Nor is there any reason to believe that natural selection op- erates in a morally or metaphysically progressive fashion. Indeed, from the Origin it is very easy to conclude that the more complex an organism the less its chances to survive. It is impossible to find in the Origin a basis in the biological world for any kind of orthogenesis or goal-directed process. Consequently it has been misread or simply not read at all, though discussed by all varieties of metaphysical evolutionists from Newman to Gerald Heard and current Catholic theologians. Thus the grand thesis of metaphysical evolutionism-from simple to complex means from good to better, infinitely or finitely, as your metaphysical taste determines - not only received no support from the Origin but, if the book were properly understood and if the indi- vidual involved felt that a metaphysic should and could have scientific support, was positively demolished. Hence the curious spectacle, to be found so often, of orthodox fundamentalist Christians and anti-Chris- tian or quasi-Christian metaphysical evolutionists ranged side by side in opposition to Darwin. And hence the equally curious spectacle of other metaphysical and Christian evolutionists swallowing the book without even a catch in the throat. But the book presented an even deeper problem of which very few were apparently aware, although it was implied in the early edi- tions and was clearly spelled out in the fourth. In the middle of the cen- tury most scientists characteristically conceived their task as discovering the laws of nature. Newton's Law of Gravity was held to be unrepeal- SEPTEMBER 1959 29</page><page sequence="12">Morse Peckham able, and for a hundred and fifty years Law had been gradually replacing Providence at the higher cultural levels. To be sure there were excep- tions. Newman preferred to believe that the weather was controlled by angels, and he has several very pretty passages on the subject. But for the most part advanced thinkers felt like Nichol, who in 1839 hailed the advent of the comprehension of Nature through discoverable Laws and rejoiced at the disappearance of the capricious ways of Providence. He felt it added greatly to the dignity of God to think that He governed the world through Laws and not through unpredictable wilfullness. It is hard not to see the influence here of political liberalism. Or perhaps it is the other way around. Certainly the two seem to be connected, for the idea of the subjection of the Crown to the rational laws of elected rep- resentatives, the progress away from capricious tyranny, is remarkably like Nichol's conception. An Enlightenment idea, it was a basic ingre- dient of most Romantic metaphysics and fundamental to evolutionary metaphysics. The metaphor unconsciously used seems too transparent to be missed, and yet it was missed. The notion was that just as it is possible to study the political behavior of a people and hence deduce its laws, so it is possible to study the behavior of nature and arrive at the laws which govern it. It was a notion particularly appealing to Englishmen, who, because of the peculiar and highly admired nature of the English Con- stitution, were in part governed by written laws and in part by laws not spelled out in a written constitution in the style of the infidel Bentham and the misguided Americans but implicit in the political structure of the nation. In Nature the laws are there, they are immanent in the nat- ural world, and it is the will of God that in our enlightened progress we should discover them. Constant reference to such economic ideas as the Law of Supply and Demand continually reinforced such concepts; and it is typical that Ruskin's aesthetic and socio-economic writings are filled with Laws of This and Laws of That. The Origin did not fit into this conception at all. Not only was an apparently accidental world revealed, but even if one insisted upon discovering an order in the apparent chaos of the biological world, the incredible intricacy of ecological relations was such that Darwin himself felt that a full comprehension was beyond him or any human being. When biology can be studied mathematically - and biologists are mak- ing progress in that direction, particularly in genetics - perhaps a few people will comprehend the biologic world, but it is too much for mathematically unorganized descriptive language. Thus at the time there were frequent complaints that Darwin did not really reveal the Laws of Nature. The culture was still penetrated VICTORIAN STUDIES 30</page><page sequence="13">DARWINISM AND DARWINISTICISM by the Baconian notion that the Laws of Nature are not only immanent, because they had been put there by God, but also were few in number and essentially simple, because God had so designed them that the hu- man mind might understand them. The culture accepted the Baconian notion that if one assembled all the data pertinent to a line of inquiry, the true relations between the separate bits of data and the laws that governed them would reveal themselves. Again we find, metaphysically, the desire to penetrate into a world of pure order. But Darwin's notion of scientific law was empiricistic and extraor- dinarily moder. He implies it in his superb discussion of the term "species" and its related words. He demonstrates that to the term there is no corresponding reality or entity in the biological world. It is essen- tial to his argument that species should not be regarded as fixed, and he disproves their fixity not so much by aligning data as by analyzing the term to demonstrate that the attempt to find distinct species in nature is necessarily fruitless, since the term is only of convenience in creating hypotheses, or, as we should say today, constructs. Further, he spelled his notion out in additions made to the opening of Chapter Four in the fourth edition. To him a scientific law was a mental convenience. The mind organized the data into meaningful structures; it did not discover the principles of organization immanent within the data. To a certain extent his public was at least intuitively aware of this position and re- sponded to it negatively. Nevertheless for the most part the Legalists of Nature simply derived from the Origin further proof of their argu- ments. It is yet another example of how Darwinism was converted into Darwinisticism and is comparable and related to the similar absorption of the Origin and natural selection into metaphysical evolutionism. There are further variables in this part of the basic question, such as adaptation, economy, and morality. Huxley, in his Romanes lec- ture, and Mill, earlier, in Three Essays on Religion, concluded that the ancient "Follow nature" as a basis for morality was in error, and that if a genuine morality were to be developed it must be on a purely human basis, indifferent to and even opposed to the workings of evolution. The economists, as we have seen, followed a different course, and with the aid of Spencer found in the Origin a basis for their own morality. And in the matter of adaptation, the final basis of British empirical theology, the notion of perfect adaption of organism to environment was washed away by the Origin. Consequently, as might have been expected, Dar- winisticism in the field of moralized psychology has used Darwin as a basis for attempting to make perfect adaptation of the individual per- sonality to its social environment into the criterion of psychological SEPTEMBER 1959 31</page><page sequence="14">Morse Peckham health. There can be located still other variables, but I have attempted to go into at least two of the problems involved in the impact of the Origin in order to show the profound difference between Darwinism and Darwinisticism. Darwinism is a scientific theory about the origin of biological species from pre-existent species, the mechanism of that process being an extraordinarily complex ecology which can be observed only in fairly small and artificially isolated instances. It reveals a world not of accident precisely but rather one in which "accident" becomes a meaningless problem. Darwinisticism can be an evolutionary meta- physic about the nature of reality and the universe. It can be a meta- physical and simplicistic notion of natural law. It can be an economic theory, or a moral theory, or an aesthetic theory, or a psychological theory. It can be anything which claims to have support from the Origin, or conversely anything which claims to have really understood what Darwin inadequately and partially presented. Once one is aware of the distinction, much which is ascribed to Darwin and much which appears to be Darwinian in the cultural documents of the past one hundred years turns out not to be Darwinian at all but Darwinistic. Is it true that what Darwin said had very little impact, but that what people thought he said, that is, what they already believed and believed to have been confirmed by Darwin, had an enormous impact? We appear to be faced with a curious problem, not with the impact of Darwinism but with the absence of impact. The answer, or at least some insight into the possible structure of an answer, lies in the area which I have called covert culture. We need, to begin with, a formula or model which will do something to explain not the rejection of the Origin, which is not too difficult to understand, but the perverting and self-deluding acceptance of the work. The following formulation will serve, I think, as a start. When a human being encounters a stimulus which cannot be fitted into an existent orientation, the fundamental tendency is either to negate the value and importance of the stimulus or to inhibit its effect, either by denying its existence or by misinterpreting it. Beyond this range at one end we have dying of fright and at the other the highly sophisticated effort not to do away with the stimulus but to re-structure the disturbed orientation without misinterpreting the stimulus. The two extremes are fairly rare, and perhaps, if we include the entire human race, equally rare. The arrival at a new high-level orientation requires high intelligence, a personality strong enough to endure considerable disturbance and frustration without collapsing or putting up defenses, VICTORIAN STUDIES 32</page><page sequence="15">DARWINISM AND DARWINISTICISM a high-level culture, and - very probably the most important factor - willingness to endure considerable loss of energy. For maintaining a pattern involves loss of energy, but creating and maintaining a novel pattern, particularly one not reinforced by the environment, involves even greater loss. It is easy now to range the responses to the Origin in a kind of order: those who totally rejected it; those who completely misunderstood it; those who incorporated it into their existing set of attitudes by misinterpreting it; and finally those who understood it and subjected their personal cultures to a complete restructuring. The history of high-level culture is the history of complex and richly-structured orientations. Considering the rarity of thorough-going re-orientations, it is by no means surprising, it is indeed to be expected, that the history of the impact of Darwinism should principally have been a history of rejection or misinterpretation. By talking of "kinds" of orientation I refer to their function in the culture of the time. At any time a stimulus which conflicts with an exist- ent orientation is disturbing, and Darwin is still capable of being very disturbing. It is difficult to absorb the fact, but for the most part our total culture has still been only very superficially affected by Darwinism. In May 1959 I was interviewed over a Philadelphia radio station on the Origin; it was a program in which the listeners are encouraged to tele- phone in questions and comments. The first call was from a woman to whom Darwin was a vicious man, ideas about biological evolution worthless, and I an ignorant and evil person for encouraging the young even to be aware of such notions. I must confess to having been a bit startled that the cultural conditions responsible for the Scopes monkey trial were still so active. The promptness and vehemence of her message were interesting, and equally interesting was her refusal not only not to consider reading the Origin but even to say why Darwin and I were so utterly wrong and bad. Similarly a recent book by Gertrude Himmel- farb, written at a higher cultural level, attempts to dismiss Darwin by raising evolutionary problems long since out of date and, most signifi- cantly, by appealing to the authority of Kierkegaard and Bergson and by ridiculing Darwin's metaphysical knowledge and abilities. In both instances one has a feeling that the anger and, in the second case, the sophisticated contempt, conceal fear. Certainly, the Origin has always displayed an extraordinary capacity for arousing anger and fear. The reason for the fear is to be found in the fact that between any orientation and a re-orientation comes a stage of dis-orientation. An orientation functions as a means of reinforcing the sense of identity, and it would seem that another way of referring to the sense of identity SEPTEMBER 1959 33</page><page sequence="16">Morse Peckham is to speak of the sense of value. (I mean the conviction that life is worth the trouble it takes to live it, as irrational a proposition as one could well arrive at.) For instance, the denial of the adequacy of a religion or a metaphysic, since it implies a denial of the system of values appar- ently derived from it and dependent upon it, involves guilt as well as fear. Anger, fear, guilt, the loss of value and values, and the loss of identity were therefore the great themes of what I have called the literature of Negative Romanticism. In Coleridge and in Byron, for ex- ample, the whole nexus of emotions is symbolized by the inability to love, inversely expressed in Wagner's Flying Dutchman by the inability to be loved. This may seem a long way from Darwin, and yet I think it is not. Reading from bottom to top, it is possible to discern a limited range of religious and metaphysical orientations current in 1859. The lowest level of higher culture was occupied by the believers in Providence. Such a "metaphysic" is perhaps the most primitive way of maintaining stability of personality and the sense of value in the face of the unpredicted and the accidental. It simply states that accidents are not accidents; they are willed by a Deity who controls, from behind the scenes, the sparrow's fall. Next comes the notion of transcendent order, of which the observed world is only the dark and confused shadow. A step higher, at least historically, is immanent order, Natural Law or cause-effect Determin- ism. Both were often enough the underpinning of an evolutionism. Next came what was perhaps the most modern, confined, I think, to a very few individuals (or at least to very few who left documents), of whom Browning was, or was to be after 1859, the most important. I would call it Radical Romanticism. It assumed, as Browning put it as early as Sordello, that great and wickedly neglected poem, that any metaphysic is only temporary, that as soon as we arrive at a solution to a metaphysi- cal problem, or any problem, that very solution immediately gives birth to a new problem and is incorporated within it. This is essentially a psychological and skeptical metaphysic, not to be confused with Hegel's, which is both less subtle and more rigid. Its classic statement was given by Rimbaud with his realization that a new orientation could only be arrived at by a willed dis-orientation totally devoid of any expectancy, even, of a new orientation. Finally there was the skepticism descended from Hume, which led a very faint life indeed, and was generally felt at the time to be quite unendurable. Dismissing the strategy of outright rejection, we can for each of these deduce first an incorporation of the Origin by perversion and sec- VICTORIAN STUDIES 34</page><page sequence="17">DARWINISM AND DARWINISTICISM ond a thorough-going dis-orientation; a re-orientation can take any form: Darwinian, Darwinistic, or something quite disconnected from either. The Origin implied at least four fundamental orientations: the biological world, and by implication the entire empirical world, is a complexity beyond our comprehension; it is possible to create mental constructs which make sense out of the data; these constructs are most satisfactory if characterized not by straight-line cause-effect thinking but by ecologi- cal thinking, that is, by the observation of patterns of relationships within and among fields abstracted from empirical reality; one can hope for increasingly complex and reliable constructs. Providential thinking incorporated the Origin by ignoring most of this and seizing upon the accidental nature of the emergence of new species. It triumphantly insisted that the only possible explanation of such emergence was the operation of the Providential Will. But even that much of the Origin was disastrous to a Providential thinking which perceived that the emergence of new species with its waste and suffering could not possibly be reconciled with a beneficent Providence. Hence the bleakness and despair of those whose Providentialism was shattered and who were unequipped to discover a new orientation. This seems to have been what happened to Yeats, and before him to Morris. The Prologue to The Earthly Paradise presents a very Darwinian world, beyond comprehension, filled with disconnected gratification and suf- fering and horror, and populated with a wide variety of false gods. The effect of the Origin upon the orientation of Transcendental Order was a little more subtle. Whereas not many Providentialists were able to exploit Darwinism, England and the West in general, in the post-Origin years, saw an immense revival of Platonism and its related and derivative orientations. It was essentially a defensive reaction, and the dislike of Darwin exhibited by such Platonists as More and Babbitt is an example of how powerfully ideas of transcendental order were challenged. The Origin gave science an enormous new vitality and status, and that in turn gave the various anti-scientific transcendental- isms immense new energy. But Darwin's uncompromising empiricism meant that if the Origin were fully accepted, Platonism and idealism, like Providentialism, crumbled. There is perhaps no logical reason why they should have crumbled, but we are here dealing not with logical relations but with covert culture, which works by half-unconscious and intuitively perceived consistencies. The rigid idealist with profound emotional commitments to his idealism simply erected higher and thicker defenses. The flexible and non-dogmatic idealist was disturbed. As we have seen, the various forms of Natural Law, the forms SEPTEMBER 1959 35</page><page sequence="18">Morse Peckham of immanent order, including evolutionism, could most easily, of the higher orientations, incorporate Darwinism by misrepresentation and create that odd amalgam, Darwinisticism. It is easy to see today, after the peculiar fate that has overtaken classical physics, that Natural Law is ultimately anti-scientific, although it appears to be scientific on the surface and is, up to a certain point. It is not, therefore, surprising that the effect of Darwinism upon Natural Law was to popularize it. Simi- larly, there was a strong re-inforcement of cause-effect Determinism. Classical physicists were particularly disagreeable to Darwin, and Hux- ley himself abandoned his determinism only after some time, perceiving that it was not scientific but Calvinistic. We should remember that the physicists were quite wrong in their insistence, to the great embarrass- ment of Darwin and to the weakening of his argument, that the earth was not old enough for biological evolution to have taken place. It seems to me unquestionable that the position of Darwin on the nature of sci- ence was more advanced than that of the physicists. Yet, because of the superficial content of science in the orientation of Natural Law and Determinism, the dis-orientation effected by Darwin was to increase that content and to convert its metaphysical content into a heuristic function, even before the heuristic concept of Law had been formulated. It was the "Radical Romantic" who could most readily (with the exception of the Humean skeptic) accept the Origin. The Radical Ro- mantic's view of the world as a never-ending series of solutions and dissolutions not only corresponded with Darwin's world, but his concept of moments of vision into the heart of things from which neither moral nor metaphysical nor empirical propositions could be derived was not too far away from Darwin's conception of scientific knowledge as not final. Nevertheless, because of the instability of holding a truth which is expected not to remain a truth or to be eventually revealed as un- reliable, Radical Romanticism constantly threatens to turn into a stable metaphysic. But in spite of this weakness, it created the modern en- vironment in which science, the scientific orientation, and skepticism could flourish. Part of the reason for this lay in the fact that it was more interested in patterns than in cause-effect relationships. The Radical Romantic in his moments of vision tended to see truth as a pattern of relationships. It is thus no accident that Nietzsche, for all his revilings of Dar- winisticism, appears in a post-Darwinian world, and that Existentialism, the most recent form of Radical Romanticism, should have followed not long after, built as it is upon Nietzsche and an early Radical Romantic, Kierkegaard. As the case of Browning shows, Radical Romanticism was VICTORIAN STUDIES 36</page><page sequence="19">DARWINISM AND DARWINISTICISM the least disturbed of all orientations in the post-Origin period (except, again, for Humean skepticism, as revived not only by Huxley but far more profoundly by Ernst Mach). My purpose in this essay has been to create a construct by which the impact of Darwinism might be investigated rather than actually do the investigation itself, and I must leave it to the reader, if he finds the construct useful, to make what use of it he can. However, I should like to examine a couple of literary documents and a pair of writers in order to show how the construct may be used. I shall begin with some comments on The Return of the Native, written within fifteen years of the first publication of the Origin. If in Under the Greenwood Tree we seem to be living in a kind of idyllic providential world, and in Far From the Madding Crowd in a causal world, in the Native we have an entirely different picture. It is true that, to begin with, coincidence, or more accurately, accident, is indeed the means whereby the story is carried on.* The vision that we live in a world in which the unexpected, the unanticipated, the totally unpre- dictable rules our lives can be unbearable, when it is insisted on. How- ever, Hardy holds the story together from the outside. Behind the series of unpredicted events, providing not a causal but a patterned inevitabil- ity, lies the cycle of the year. The lovers meet as the sun is turning north, their love grows as the sun moves northward, it is consummated in mar- riage very nearly at the summer solstice, by September it has begun to go wrong, and the final tragedy occurs in late November, when once again the sun is sinking towards its southernmost point. This pattern is further reinforced by subtle references to the time of day, particularly in the latter part of the novel, in which the crucial September scenes * Some incidents from my own experience in teaching this novel are particularly pertinent. Some twenty years ago in a Southern college which shall be nameless I had the task of trying to persuade a group of badly educated freshmen to grasp the book. They objected to it violently. They had been taught in high school that a good novel or play does not depend for its plot progressions and resolutions on coincidence. Hardy's novel does de- pend on coincidence. Therefore it is a bad novel. Again and again I explained that that was Hardy's whole point. They always said that they understood, but at the next meet- ing of the class the same objection would be brought up again. I fear I failed. Ten years later I was relating my experience to a colleague in a Northern university. He was most condescending, not only to freshman and Southern freshman, but especially to me, for my failure in not getting the students to grasp the point. "However," he added, "there's one thing in Hardy I can't swallow. In Tess everything hinges on the fact that the letter goes under the carpet." Here are two good examples of how profoundly the orientation of causality has penetrated our culture. Reading detective stories is a kind of a meta- physical ritual for reinforcing it. But the Native clearly does not belong to that kind of orientation. SEPTEMBER 1959 37</page><page sequence="20">Morse Peckham take place in the afternoon and the final November scenes not long after sunset. But there is a further element of organization: the opening de- scription of Egdon Heath, the careful topography, without which the catastrophe cannot be understood and could not have happened in the way it did, the mixed racial background of Eustacia, Clem's alienation from his native attitudes by his residence in Paris - a thousand big and little elements which show the relation of the characters to their cultural and natural environment and equally their violations of those relations. One great theme of the novel is the ecological relation of personality to, in the anthropological sense, the landscape. All three of these elements - accident beyond our anticipation or comprehension, control of structure by pattern, ecological thinking - are Darwinian. To be sure, Hardy might have derived the notion of the seasonal cycle from the folklorists, anthropologists, and archaeologists of his day, but they in their turn had been strongly influenced by the Origin. And no doubt there is already something of Schopenhauer and von Hartmann in the work. But these last influences on Hardy seem to me to govern more the later novels. The Native exhibits, to my mind, a pro- foundly Darwinian orientation, even to the implication that we can never fully understand the world in which we live, and our relation to it. My second example comes from something apparently highly remote, though almost contemporaneous, Pater's Renaissance, a su- perbly structured book, from the opening Preface to the famous Con- clusion. But its structure - and this is perhaps why it has been taken to be merely a collection of only historically related essays with a conclu- sion tacked on - is not the structure of logic, which, it is to be remem- bered, was thought of as descriptive of the cause-effect structure of reality. Rather it is organized, first by the recurrence of themes, and second by Pater's delicate revelation that in each of the individuals or works discussed is to be found a similarity of pattern, the orientive pat- terns of the modern world, gradually emerging from an early gothic love story through Leonardo to Winckelman, and crystal clear only in the Conclusion. Here again, I think, is a Darwinian kind of thinking, but much more Darwinian is another ingredient in the basic structure of the Conclusion. I have pointed out that one of the shocks administered by Darwin to theology was that the one thing which remained unattacked in the eighteenth- nineteenth-century argument from design, or natural the- ology, was the perfect adaptation of organism to environment, a subject on which the Bridgewater lectures had been so wearisomely explicit. But Darwin, of course, had revealed that the whole mechanism of nat- VICTORIAN STUDIES 38</page><page sequence="21">DARWINISM AND DARWINISTICISM ural selection and the origin of species depended upon the imperfect, or less than perfect, adaptation of organism to environment. Now this, I believe, is the basic assumption for the argument that we should burn with a hard, gem-like flame. In terms of the history of Romanticism, Pater was applying to art, to religion, to metaphysics, to morality, ex- actly the pattern of the momentary spots of time which Wordsworth had applied to nature. The problem of the disoriented or negative Ro- mantic was to re-create the sense of value by establishing an orientation which would relate the self to the universe. Hence Wordsworth makes a romantic and psychological adaptation of the argument from design, which was already current, when in the passage from the Recluse quoted in the Preface to the Excursion he speaks of how exquisitely the mind is adapted to the universe. Because of this adaptation we can make the transition from self to nature and perceive it as a symbol of the Divine, or value. But Pater, the post-Darwinian who had lost his Christian faith even before the publication of the Origin, can make no such leap. As he sees it, the mind, the emotions, the personality are not adapted to the conditions of human existence. Rather, ideas, whether metaphysical, theological, or moral, are instruments of adaptation by which we adjust ourselves to the world. They are not final truths, nor ever can be. They are, rather, adaptational illusions, but far more satisfactory than any of these is the work of art, since it gives the highest value to the discon- nected moments of the personality as they appear and does not pretend to be true. Art, therefore, is the most successful of our adaptational mechanisms. Admittedly, this is in part to translate Pater into Darwinian terms, but its seems irresistible that Pater is saying that the world can- not be known and that our modes of knowing and experiencing are in- struments of the observer, not modes of comprehending metaphysical or even scientific truth. The case of Pater indicates how delicate and subtle is the problem of Darwinian influence. There is always the possibility of cultural con- vergence. Perhaps he could have come to these conclusions had it not been for Darwinism, but it seems most unlikely. At any rate, that is a question that cannot be answered. We can only say that in the Origin is a locus of a novel orientation, and that it seems not to be a misinter- pretation of Pater to discover the same orientations in his work. Pre- sumably, the Darwinian orientation entered into Pater's covert culture and left important traces in the Conclusion to the Renaissance. In conclusion, we can examine briefly two figures both currently of great cultural importance, Nietzsche and Freud. In Nietzsche's con- SEPTEMBER 1959 39</page><page sequence="22">Morse Peckham cept of the will to power (by which he did not mean political tyranny) we have a highly Darwinian notion of the desire to control our environ- ment. This desire has no transcendental source. Rather its roots are phys- iological within the individual and ultimately biological. The will to power is a way of stating the endless and never-to-be-consummated drive to adapt ourselves to our environment. Hence, for all the suffering in the world, the power of joy is deeper than suffering. The drive towards a sense of value is greater than all its frustrations. The "will to power" thus brings Darwin's ecological vision within the reach of human psy- chology and human morality. In the same way Freud, who refused to read Nietzsche because he feared his own originality might be thereby damaged - thus showing that he knew something about him - presents neurosis not only as the repetition of a pattern but something from which everyone suffers and which can never be entirely overcome. Hence analysis is endless. We can never make the perfect adaptation. The only complete adaptation is to adapt our neuroses to those of others in our social environment, to conform; but that is a counsel of despair. It is in the endless effort to solve the unsolvable that Freud finds his peculiar grim optimism closely resembling both Darwin's and Nietzsche's. Yet in Freud we find another example of Darwinisticism, of turning a Darwinian perception into a metaphysic. Implicit and explicit in Freud is an idea which has been so over-developed by naive dogmatic Freudians that it completely dom- inates their thinking. That notion is that in the psychological world there are no accidents, that all is determined, that cause and effect rule everywhere, and that everything in the individual's psychological past can be understood and accounted for. It is not surprising that a Freudian metaphysic has become most popular in those areas and levels of Western culture which, to a con- siderable degree through the impact of Darwinism and Darwinisticism, have been most thoroughly secularized. It has filled the vacuum left by the departure of religion and metaphysics; but the drives of Providen- tialism are still with us. This new metaphysic, now so popular at middle- class American cultural levels, is only another example of how Darwin- isticism has perverted Darwinism, and how the Origin has had far less impact than have other orientations, both already existent and more recently emergent, which have mis-used and mis-interpreted that great book for the purposes of their own survival.
