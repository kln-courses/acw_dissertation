<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS AND BOOK NOTES Instead, the bulk of the chapter contains description and discussion of each prehistoric phase (e.g., LeCroy, Guilford) and an enumeration of research questions. Most of these questions truely are useful for planning research but an occasional one will provide misguid- ance. Given the phase-by-phase organization of the chapter, it would have been more useful had Purring- ton di-cussed the amount of land surveyed systemat- ically, the techniques used on the major survey proj- ects, the estimation of the square meters actually excavated in western North Carolina, and if he had summarized some data by the geographical units out- lined. His claim for settlement-pattern data for the region was supported poorly. Inclusion of this material could have occupied the space spent on determining site significance and CRM issues that seem out of place in this article. These articles summarize different levels of knowl- edge-Ward and Coe address interpretive problems, Phelps and Purrington basic data. Each author has judged correctly, in my opinion, the most fundamental need of the region. The editors saw to it that the head- ings and subsections were consistent in presence, order, and label. Words like "Paleo-Indian" are consistent in spelling and figures, in layout and labelling. An index is provided along with a single set of references. I per- sonally found the CRM language and detail unbalanced between the papers and cumbersome in the Purrington introduction. I also think the editors should have asked for an estimation of the area excavated in each region and for more recent references. The three-year delay in the appearance of this volume largely reflects rewrite time. References as late as 1982 are to be expected- Purrington's 50 references since 1971 amount to 63 percent of all his references, Ward 52 percent, and Phelps 39 percent, if you subtract references to his own writing. Fourteen references in the entire volume post- date 1979. What is ancient and honorable in archae- ology is included here, what is new, is not. The Prehistoric Native American Art of Mud Glyph Cave. CHARLES H. FAULKNER, editor. Univer- sity of Tennessee Press, 1986. ix + 124 pp., illus- trations, references, index. $12.95 (cloth). Reviewed by John G. Douglas, Bureau of Land Man- agement. Since reading the promising 1984 preliminary report on this unmatched example of Mississippian period cave art (AmericanAntiquity 49:350-36 1), I have looked forward to a more-developed analysis. This volume might best be considered an interim or progress report. Mud Glyph Cave is a small solution cave in south- eastern Tennessee. Deep within the cave and extending for nearly 100 m, thick mud deposits on the walls are decorated with trailed and incised designs. The cave's constant temperature and high humidity keep the mud plastic and easily impressed with fingers, sticks, or oth- er implements. A lower cave passage carries stream water and protects the "gallery" passage from flooding. Many of the designs bear obvious affinity to Missis- sippian art, including "Southern Cult" motifs, known in other media from numerous Southeastern locations. They are termed "mud glyphs" in analogy with petro- glyphs, a few of which also occur in the cave. Dark surface staining, thought to be soot from torches and fires, obscures the mud's bright orange color. A few simple hearths are the sole nonart features, and no portable artifacts are present. The only uncharred or- ganic material found is a fragment of eastern red cedar. The cave's art was discovered and brought to Faulk- ner's attention in 1980. Study under Faulkner's direc- tion, supported by a National Geographic Society grant, was conducted in 1982. The 1984 report gives a good summary. Like its precursor, this report is mostly descriptive. Several brief chapters tell of the cave's discovery and exploration, its survey and mapping, the photographic recording of the glyphs, and the identification of in- cidental animal marks. A chapter on dating reports eight radiocarbon dates from the fifth to eighteenth centuries A.D.; five cluster around the mean, A.D. 1248, which is taken as a reasonable date. Chapters by Mul- ler, on the art of the cave, and by Henson, on rock art in the Tennessee Valley area, make up most of the volume's length. A brief concluding chapter by Watson gives a comparative perspective for prehistoric cave utilization in the Midsouth. Muller presents a preliminary analysis of the art's execution and style, cautioning repeatedly against pre- mature interpretations of "meaning," especially iden- tification of prehistorically rendered figures with his- toric mythic beings. He compares the Mud Glyph Cave figures stylistically and thematically with similar rep- resentations in shell and copper from around the Southeast, finding cross-dating justification for a mid- to late thirteenth-century date for the cave art. Muller's caution about one-to-one equations is well taken, but I hope it does not deter him from considering the very fundamental symbolic relations that do seem to hold through the centuries. As Watson puts it, "there are resemblances between some of the art motifs on the walls of Mud Glyph Cave and some of the basic themes in the mythology... of the Southeastern United States. An explanation of Mud Glyph Cave, therefore, necessitates attention to the descendants of its crea- tors" (p. 116). Muller often notes the ambiguities generated by bird- like elements on "anthropomorphic" and "herpeto- morphic" figures, using those terms to stress that rep- resentations are probably not humans or serpents per se, but may be purposely ambiguous. Similar mixing of attributes is common in the metaphorical conven- tions of many eastern North American narratives, where one finds oppositions among the spirit realms together with reference to natural species and substances that link the realms as intermediaries. For example, cedar and shell link dry-land and water aspects of the Earth's surface (where humans live) with the Above Earth realm; copper links Below Earth and Above Earth; all three materials have considerable ritual power. In this con- nection, I suggest that attention to the medium is po- tentially important in any examination of symbolic representation, certainly in the case of shell and copper, and I would consider this for the mud itself. Not only is subterranean location significant, so might the mud's 205</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY color be. Troublesome superposition of glyph elements could suggest renewal, perhaps revivification, ofglyphs that have had their reddish color obscured by soot. Tools for manipulating supernaturally charged media are also important; I would consider the fragment of cedar in this regard. Muller concludes his chapter by noting that "Mud Glyph Cave may give a glimpse into beliefs of its time, but only as a result of very careful internal and com- parative study" (p. 80). I eagerly take this and his sev- eral other indications of studies not yet done as a prom- ise that he will do them. Anyone inspired to work independently with the site data will need to travel to Knoxville or Carbondale, since this volume is limited in both explication and description. There is no listing of glyphs, motifs, and provenience. The map of the glyph gallery is scaled to about 1:580 to fit page size, and does not show glyph locations except for 12 illustrated in plates. There are no line drawings. The 26 photographs are small (largest is 8 x 12.5 cm), and the scale is cropped out on four of them. There is no knowing how many glyphs are not represented or how glyphs relate one to another. Rock art only recently has begun to gain respectabil- ity. My hope is that Muller's continuing analysis and interpretation of the similar art of Mud Glyph Cave may stimulate yet more acceptance of stationary art as a proper subject for serious scholarship. The dust jacket proposes that the volume "will be prized by scientists, cavers, and armchair archaeologists alike." I suggest that scientists may need to wait a bit longer for their prize, but it could be a very well-rewarded wait. Ancient Texans: Rock Art and Lifeways along the Lovw- er Pecos. HARRY J. SHAFER, with photographs by JIM ZINTGRAFF. Texas Monthly Press, Austin, 1986. xiv + 247 pp., appendix, biblio., index. $35.00 (cloth). Reviewed by Karen Nissen, Basin Research Associates. At a time when many archaeological reports are writ- ten in jargon that is difficult for archaeologists to de- cipher, it is welcome to see a publication written in language for the general public. The publication of An- cient Texans is aimed at unraveling the lifeways of the Indians of the Lower Pecos River, and it is intended to complement an exhibition covering the 9,000 years of culture history on display at the Witte Museum in San Antonio. While other archaeologists have pre- sented more detailed examinations of individual sites discussed in this book, Shafer has synthesized these data to present a readable overview of the archaeology and rock art in the Lower Pecos region. Shafer introduces the reader to the prehistory with a fictional account of one band living in the region 1,740 years ago. This novel ethnography encapsulates a small segment of the seasonal round of a band. Hav- ing recently read some of Jean Auel's novels, I was expecting the worst when I was introduced to Moon, Lizard, Owl, and other band members. However, Shaf- er has written a good account of how one small band functioned, describing the resources, artifacts, and be- liefs in a manner that leads the reader to an under- standing of how life might have been. Adding to this reconstruction are illustrations by George Strickland. The second chapter covers the environmental back- ground, discussing how geologic forces and climate gradually transformed the region to its present state and formed the rock-shelters and caves in which the inhabitants lived and left their rock art. Shafer notes the importance that geology, paleontology, palynology, botany, etc. play in providing information on the evolving landscape. Minor reversals to a warming trend are present ca. 2500 B.P. and 650 B.P. when cooler and moister conditions prevailed, and this led to short periods when bison moved to the region and were ex- ploited by hunters. Shafer notes that the most dramatic changes have occurred within the past century when domestic animals were introduced, range fires sup- pressed, and dams and waterworks were constructed resulting in overexploitation of the environment. Vaughn Bryant wrote sections on palynology and cop- rolite analysis, describing how these studies can con- tribute to our understanding of environment, diet, uses of artifacts, etc. Shafer continues with a discussion of the cultural sequence in the Lower Pecos. Following a brief intro- duction discussing the peopling of the New World, there is a detailed description of the cultural sequence ranging from Folsom points associated with a bison drive at Bonfire Shelter to the historic period. More than 800 bison remains recovered from Bonfire Shelter during the Devil's Interval (3000-1000 B.P.) point to a cooler moister period ca. 2500 B.P. The Pecos River Style of pictographs represented by large anthropo- morphic figures holding atlatls is correlated with this period and may be older. During the Comstock Inter- val (1000-400 B.P.), small projectile points mark the introduction of the bow and arrow, and some new site types suggest movement of populations into the region. Two new pictograph styles, the Red Monochrome and Red Linear, appear at this time; notable in the Red Monochrome Style are figures holding bows and ar- rows. During the Historic Interval (400-150 B.P.), a number of groups are known to have used the area, and depictions of churches, priests, horses, etc. are rep- resented in the rock art. Discussions and descriptions of Baker Cave by Thomas Hester and Bonfire Shelter by Solveig Turpin follow. These brief articles provide additional data on techniques used in excavating cave deposits, the cul- tural sequence, etc. Turpin also wrote a section on small hearth sites located along canyon rims and on isolated hilltops. These are interpreted as sites for sig- nal fires, and they are thought to date to the Late Pre- historic or Protohistoric periods. Shafer continues with a description of the material culture and lifestyles of the inhabitants of the region. He notes how the diversity of resources and the sea- sonal round archaeologically are reflected in sites such as burned-rock middens, rockshelters, etc. A nice chart shows the sequence of projectile points, pictographs, painted pebbles, and sandals in the region. An in-depth discussion by Shafer of the pictographs, painted and engraved pebbles, and clay and fiber fig- urines follows.
