<plain_text><page sequence="1">David E. Mungello The reconciliation of Neo-Confucianism with Chris- tianity in the writings of Joseph de Premare, S. J. THE OBJECT OF INQUIRY: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MOTIVES AND CONCLUSIONS IN CHINESE STUDIES The relationship between motives and conclusions in scholarship is a subject which attracts only passing interest, and yet we may have much to learn from studying this connection. This is particularly true in a field of scholarship with a historical dimension, that is, where scholars at different times in history have come to differing conclusions about the same body of material. The history of the field of Chinese studies contains a number of differing Western inter- pretations of Chinese culture, some of which are far superior to others in the depth of their understanding of China. Among these, the interpretation by a Jesuit named Joseph de Premare (1666-1736) seems a particularly fruitful example for study. Premare lived in China for thirty-seven years, most of the while residing in northern Kiangsi province. He absorbed a knowledge of Chinese language and culture which few Westerners have achieved, and yet his motives also belonged to the Society of Jesus and to the intense struggle of his own time known as the Rites Controversy. This study is an examination of some of Premare's motives and conclusions in his interpretation of Chinese culture, particularly his interpretation of Neo-Confucianism of the li-hsiieh (School of Principle) strain. The results are perhaps somewhat surprising to those of us who have been taught the overriding ideal of objectivity of motive in scholarship, but then the reader should be free to draw his own conclusions. Let us look at Premare. BACKGROUND Joseph Henry Marie de Premare (Ma Jo-sea) was born in Cherbourg, France on July 17, 1666. He entered the Society of Jesus in 1683 at the fairly typical entrance age of seventeen, and fifteen years later embarked for China. He was enrolled in the China mission by Joachim Bouvet, S. J. (Po Chinb; 1656-1730), who was on a recruiting mission to Europe at the request of the K'ang-hsi emperor. Louis XIV was not interested in giving further support to the China mission-he had already financed the 1685 mission of six Jesuit mathematicians that had included Bouvet-but Bouvet was able to find backing elsewhere by combining the mission with a private commercial venture.1 Consequently, Bouvet was able to return to China with ten Jesuits, of whom Premare was one.2 Premare departed from La Rochelle on the Amphitrite on March 7, 1698 and arrived seven months later at Shang-ch'iianc, an island approximately fifty miles southwest of Macao. Here the group made a pilgrimage to the tomb of Francis Xavier, S. J.,3 and then proceeded on to Macao and Canton, after David Mungello is Assistant Professor, Briarcliff College, Briarcliff Manor, N. Y.

From 1699 through 1724, Premare was located primarily in northern Kiangsi province at Jao-choud, Chien-change, Nan-changf, and Chiu-chiangg. There is evidence that in 1714 Premare was ordered to Peking, but there is little detail of any of his activities there.4 Premare's work in the establishing of churches and conver- sion of new Christians in Kiangsi was halted in 1724 when the new restrictions of the Yung Chengh emperor (r. 1723-1736) ordered all missionaries to either Peking or Canton. Though a number of Jesuits violated the order by secretly remaining in the provinces, Premare obeyed.5 The years 1724-1732, which Premare spent in exile in Canton, provided him with the opportunity for assimilating his twenty-five year experience in China and for committing his thoughts to paper. It was during this period that his major works were either composed or put into final form. In 1725, Premare completed his corrections and revisions to "Selecta quaedam vestigia praecipuorum Christianae Relligionis dogmatum ex antiquis Sinarum libris eruta" [Selected vestiges of certain preeminent Christian religious dogmas extracted from ancient books of the Chinese]. The work is more familiarly known by its later translated and published title, Vestiges des principaux dogmes Chretiens tires des anciens livres chinois (Paris 1878). This treatise first had been composed in 1712, but Premare explains the considerable differences between the initial and revised versions: ... from that time [1712], I have not ceased in perusing the Chinese authors, and that all my time and my attentions have been consecrated to the completion of this work. I have felt obliged to begin anew. I have completely changed the plan. I have corrected those errors, and I have added more than half.6 The Vestiges is a work involving a great deal of research and familiarity with classical Chinese literature. It presents the "figurist" position by dealing extensively with such works as the Book of Changes (I ching) and the Book of History (Shang Shu), the Analects, and the Mencius. In 1728, Premare completed Notitia Linguae Sinicae [A knowledge of the Chinese language]. This work firmly established Premare's excellence as a grammarian and philologist.7 In the same year, he composed his Lettre sur le monotheisme des chinois, a fifty-four page treatise in which he exhibits wide familiarity with Chinese, and especially Neo-Confucian, texts. Both the Vestiges and the Lettre address the great issue of compatibility between European Christianity and Chinese Confucianism. The Jesuits, since the time of Matteo Ricci (Li Ma-t'oui, 1553-1610), had been the strongest advocates of compatibility. The Figurist group within the Jesuits represented an even stronger advocacy. However the Roman pontiffs since the late 1600s had shown progressively less sympathy for the Jesuit approach and position. Also, the former support which the Jesuits had received from the Chinese monarchs had been receding since the disastrous mission of 1704-1710 to</page><page sequence="3">391 China by the papal legate, Charles Tournon. A further contributing factor to growing imperial disfavor was a struggle for succession which occurred at the death of the K'ang-hsij emperor in 1722. In this struggle, a branch of the imperial family which had been converted to Christianity opposed the man who finally acceeded to the throne. This experience, along with the inter- missionary strife which marked the last years of his father's reign, helped foster a negative attitude toward the missionaries in the Yung Cheng emperor's mind. And so it is not surprising that the second year of the latter's reign saw the beginning of restrictions upon the missionaries which went far beyond what the K'ang-hsi emperor had initiated. It is in the context of both the European and Chinese imperial attitudes of growing negativism, that Premare's works were composed. Sitting on the edge of China and denied reentry into the Chinese heartland, assailed by negative and destructive attitudes from both home and from fellow workers in China, Premare in his predicament evokes a recurring image in the history of Chinese- Western relations. In 1733, in an intensification of governmental restrictions, Pr6mare and a number of missionaries were expelled from Canton to Macao. He died in Macao on September 7, 1736. PREMARE AND THE FIGURISTS The members of the Society of Jesus were the chief proponents of the view that indigenous Chinese culture was compatible with Christianity. Within this group of Jesuit sinophiles there developed a subgroup of learned, extremely enthusi- astic men who carried the argument for compatibility far beyond their fellows. In the view of this subgroup, God revealed his wishes and teachings in an Ancient Law which was presented to mankind through a Lawgiver. This Lawgiver was thought to be a universal figure, although he has been known under a number of different names. For example, among the Jews, he is Enoch ;8 among the Greeks, Hermes Trismegistus; among the Syrians, Zoroaster; and among the Chinese, Fu Hsi. In short, the Lawgiver did not belong to any single nation or race. A number of seventeenth-century Europeans wrote on this topic of the Ancient Law and Lawgiver, and the Figurists appear to have made considerable use of their ideas.9 At the core of the Figurists' ideas was the doctrine of Logos- the eternal, universal reason which is referred to as the "Word of God." 0 They held that the Flood of Noah (Genesis 6-9) was the same flood associated with the Chinese legendary sage, Yao. One of Noah's sons, Ham, was said to have taken the spirit of corruption into the ark and thereby to have contributed to the destruction of the Ancient Law, while another son, Shem, saved the Ancient Law from complete destruction and so preserved it for his descendants. Once, the whole world shared the single universal language of Logos, but this pure tongue was later displaced by a proliferation of tongues. (This confusion of</page><page sequence="4">392 Mungello tongues is associated by Genesis 11:1-9 with the building of the Tower of Babel.) Drawing from the juxtaposition of the Lord's dispersion of mankind and discussion of Shem's descendants mentioned in Genesis 11:9-32, there was a belief that Shem carried the doctrine of Logos to eastern Asia, but to everywhere else this doctrine was lost. Consequently, Chinese culture came to occupy the unique position in the world of being the sole preserver of the language of the Lawgiver and the sole inheritor of universal Logos. Four Jesuits of the China mission devoted themselves to finding confirmation for these ideas in Chinese literature and particularly in what they regarded as the symbolical significance of the Chinese written characters. It is these four who constitute the core of the Figurists. They are Joachim Bouvet, Jean- Francois Focquet (Fu Sheng-tsek, 1665-1741), Jean-Alexis de Gollet (Kuo Chung-fu', 1664-1741), and Premare. Figurist views were not well received in Rome. From 1726 to 1728, the Propaganda denounced Premare and ordered his immediate recall on the grounds that he had "destroyed the veneration of the Old Testament by exalting the Chinese book, the I Ching." l The Sacred Congregation later commuted this order on the condition that Premare either deny under oath that he had authored the writings favorable to Chinese rites attributed to him or else make a clear retraction of his ideas. (I have seen no evidence of Premare's retraction.) In 1736, the recall order was again brought forth, but Premare was now dead. Although the Figurists were all members of the same religious order and each spent at least twenty years in China, there was nevertheless considerable diversity of points of view. In the case of Bouvet and Premare, this diversity was fostered by their different situations in China. As Premare's recruiter and initial leader, Bouvet doubtless contributed to the shaping of Premare's own Figurist views. Furthermore, there was at least one work on which they col- laborated.12 However, Bouvet's situation in China had placed him at the court in Peking, while Premare's time was spent in Kiangsi province as a missionary proselytizer and later in Canton as an exile.13 The imperial court dominates Bouvet's thinking in a way that it does not Premare's. Bouvet's perception of Chinese culture is more through Manchu eyes and the Manchu selection of literary works, whereas Premare seems to be affected by a more directly Chinese influence. Premare's writings certainly reflect an awareness of a far greater range and diversity of views of Chinese philosophers than do Bouvet's writings, though this may also reflect Premare's greater ability as a scholar. There is no doubt that Premare's range and depth of understanding and familiarity with Chinese textual materials is the greatest of the four Figurists. In his sympathy for contemporary literati culture, Premare differs from Bouvet. In the depth of his comprehension of Chinese culture and in his sympathetic interpretation of current as well as ancient cultural forms, Premare reminds one of his out- standing predecessor, Matteo Ricci, of which more will be said later.</page><page sequence="5">393 THE TRANSMISSION OF THE TAO AND CHRISTIANITY IN OPPOSITION: THE YUNG CHENG EMPEROR'S EDICT OF 1727 The climate in which Premare wrote his major works was one of intellectual and spiritual crisis. In January of 1724, the Yung Cheng emperor began the policy which is said to have confiscated three-hundred Christian churches in the provinces, in addition to expelling most of the missionaries to Canton.14 Whether because of the missionaries' usefulness to the throne, proximity to supervision, or other reasons, Peking was generally exempted from the restric- tions. The attitude behind the restrictive policy toward the missionaries is presented in an imperial edict issued by the Yung Cheng emperor in the fourth lunar month of 1727.15 Sinologists have written a great deal about the self-sufficient and absolutist forces associated with the Chinese notion of the "Middle Kingdom," which occupies the geographic, celestial, and cultural center of the cosmos and regards those beyond its borders as "barbarians" (im).16 And so it is of particular interest that this edict diverges from this Middle Kingdom absolutism enough to admit an element of cultural relativity into the determination of truth. The fundamental criteria of the True and Good, which the edict refers to as the "True Way" (cheng-taon), are agreement and harmony. Contention and discord are the signs of falsehood, which is referred to as "false teaching" (i-tuan?). Using these criteria, the edict speaks of the recent contention between the Buddhist-Taoist school and the "Western Teaching" (Hsi-yang chiaoP; literally, Western Ocean Teaching) or Christianity as signs that these teachings are false and immoral.17 The use of the term "Western Teaching" rather than a more specifically religious term such as T'ien-chu chiaoq (literally, Heavenly Lord's Teaching) to refer to Christianity indicates the Chinese tendency of this time to view Christianity as both a cultural force and a religion. Confucius is the chief teacher of the True Way, and he is quoted twice in this brief edict. The first quotation provides the fundamental position of the edict: "Confucius said: 'The study of false teachings is harmful indeed !' "18 The edict uses the second quotation to make the point that there are true and false types of prayer. The edict quoted only the first and last parts of the following quota- tion (as italicized) but, of course, the entire passage would have been very familiar to the Chinese reader. It is: The Master being very sick, Tzu-lur asked leave to pray for him. He said, 'May such a thing be done?' Tzu-lu replied, 'It may. In the Eulogies it is said, "Prayer has been made for thee to the spirits of the upper and lower worlds."' The Master said, 'My praying has been for a long time."19 The edict states that the prayer of Tzu-lu represents a false teaching, while the prayer of Confucius represents the True Way. By extension, the prayers or practices of Christianity, Buddhism, and Taoism represent false teachings,</page><page sequence="6">394 Mungello whereas those of Confucianism represent the True Way. Confucianism is true because it, more than any other teaching in China, preserves the teachings of the ancient sages, and, by preserving this continuity with the past, achieves the greatest unity and harmony of any teaching. The edict concedes that there are those who may call themselves Confucianists but who do not really practice the true teachings of the Sage, just as the prayers of Tzu-lu, the Confucian disciple, were of the false teaching, while Confucius' prayers were of the True Way. The edict goes on to state that the Western Teaching has proved itself to be false for China because it has broken with the sages of antiquity. It has taken a new term, 'T'ien-chu', to designate its God, whereas the true name for Heaven's unfolding as yin and yang, the five agents and the transformation into the myriad things is 'T'ien-tsai"'. The Christian notion of afterlife associated with T'ien-chu conflicts with the traditional type of afterlife associated with the legendary sage, Yao. Furthermore, the Western Teaching has produced con- fusion, hate, and contention. Both because of its disharmony with the past and its creation of discord in the present, the Western Teaching is a false teaching. It is worth noting that the Jesuits had urged the use of traditional Chinese terminology for God rather than the more alien T'ien-chu, but they were criticized for doing so by other missionaries and were eventually overruled by Rome. While the Jesuits' preference might have resolved the edict's first objection, their unyielding insistence on their own solution contributed to just the sort of contention and discord which is part of the second objection and which disqualified them from being part of the True Way. Yet the edict does not dismiss the Western Teaching as entirely false. It recognizes that the proponents of this teaching are accurate in computing the calendar. Furthermore, it introduces a sense of cultural relativism with the following statement on the appropriateness of specific teachings to their respective cultural regions: China has the teaching of China [that is, Confucianism]. The West has the teaching of the West [that is, Christianity]. The teaching of the West is not necessarily able to work in China, just as the teaching of China is really not able to work in the West. We have already discussed that the teachings of the West had not worked in China because of lack of accord with China's continuous cultural tradition and because of the contentiousness which the teaching engendered in China. Unfortunately, the edict does not specify why the teaching of China would not work in the West. The fact that this edict is in the Jesuit archives in Rome indicates that Premare probably had the opportunity to read its contents. And even if he had not read the edict, the position it embodies was so crucial to the status of the mission that it would doubtless have been communicated to all the Jesuits in China.</page><page sequence="7">395 Although there is little evidence that Premare's writings were directly responding to this edict, Premare's attempt to find accord between the Chinese traditional culture, as embodied in Confucianism, and Christianity represents an attempt to deal with one of the fundamental criticisms that the Yung Cheng emperor's edict was making. The Manchu throne did not welcome any teaching to China whose doctrines were not in accord with the truths and morality of traditional Confucian culture. We may explain part of the Yung Cheng emperor's reaction in political and social terms. As a monarch of a too loosely unified nation and particularly as a Manchu overlord among an overwhelmingly Chinese populace, he was vitally concerned with unity. On the other hand, this edict's stress on unity versus discord as the criterion of what separates the True Way from the false teaching had been part of Confucianism from its origin. In fact, this stress on unity as opposed to discord had become so ingrained into Chinese culture that one could probably speak of it as a cultural ideal, if not a trait. Not only had Confucianism traditionally been regarded as the philosophy which best captured and transmitted the ideals of these sacred ancestors, but Confucianism also had demonstrated a marked ability to survive as a political philosophy and stabilizing force. All of these reasons attracted the Manchus to the rigid support of Confucianism. Of course, background information tells us that by "Confucianism" (ju-hsiieh), the Yung Cheng emperor meant the Neo-Confucianist reinterpretation of Confucius' philosophy as given by the Sung masters and, above all, by Chu Hsi. The Manchus accepted the link between Confucius and the Sung masters as defined in the "Transmission of the Tao." According to this doctrine, the true transmission of discipleship had been from Confucius to Mencius and then, after a lapse of over a thousand years, to the Sung masters. The decade preceding this decree had seen the culmination of several am- bitious scholarly projects under the K'ang-hsi emperor's sponsorship. Of particular significance to Neo-Confucianism in the early 1700s were two projects, both of which were under the chief editorship of Li Kuang-ti' (1642- 1718), a follower of Sung Neo-Confucianism. The first was the Chu-tzu ch'iian- shuu [Collected works of Master Chu] in 66 chiian, published in 1714. The second project was the Hsing-li ching-iv [The essentials of the Nature and Principle philosophy) in twelve chiian, published in 1715. The Hsing-li ching-i is an abridgement of the much larger Hsing-li ta-ch'iianw [The great compendium of the Nature and Principle philosophy] in sixty chiian, published in 1415. However, as Wing-tsit Chan points out in his article on the Hsing-li ching-i, the selection process was a creative one by Li Kuang-ti which reflected the more concrete concerns of seventeenth-century China. The result was a proportional increase in the philosophy of Chu Hsi and, in particular, his methodology and a decrease in quotations from the other Sung Neo-Confucian masters as well as a deemphasis of metaphysics.20</page><page sequence="8">396 Mungello THE TRANSMISSION OF THE TAO AND CHRISTIANITY RECONCILED: PREMARE'S LETTRE SUR LE MONOTHEISME DES CHINOIS Premare's Lettre sur le monotheisme des Chinois (1728) represents not only a contribution to a vital debate of his time, but also the best summary of his interpretation of Neo-Confucianism and of how that philosophy fits into this debate. At the beginning of his Lettre, Premare explains his aim of rebutting those "libertines of Europe," who misuse Chinese culture to advance their atheism.21 With particular reference to France, Premare speaks of these libertines' attempt to further their cause by pointing to China as an antique and wise culture which publicly professes atheism. He also complains of the opposition of Pope Benedict XIII (1724-1730) to his aim and feels that such opposition plays into the hands of the libertines. Premare divides his rebuttal into two parts, the first of which examines the physical system of the Chinese. The second attempts to show that the Chinese have the same notions of divinity as do Christians and thereby rebut the accusation of Spinozistic pantheism. By referring to "the physical system of the Chinese," it is not clear whether Pr6mare regards this as merely the dominant or the earliest physical system in China. Since Premare has in mind the physical system of Sung Neo-Confucianism, modern sinology might concede an his- torical dominance while denying its chronological priority. (The Taoists had developed a physical system by the fourth century B.C.) The 'physical system' which Pr6mare has in mind is both metaphysical and physical and reflects a mixture far more characteristic of the natural philosophers among Premare's contemporaries than it does of twentieth-century natural scientists. Premare makes specific reference to Chou Lien-hsi (Chou Tun-i; 1017-1073) as the founder of this physical system of Sung Neo-Confucianism. He goes on to refer to the two Ch'eng brothers (Ch'eng HaoX; 1032-1085 and Ch'eng IY; 1033-1107) as "the most direct disciples" of Chou Tun-i--a debatable claim. Finally, he refers to Chu Hsi (1130-1200) as Chou Tun-i's "most eminent disciple."22 The physical system which these men developed is summarized by Premare in the following three points. (1) The universe is analyzable into the two components of ch'iaa and liab. Ch'i is without shape but may become shaped. Premare compares ch'i to a vase. Li completely transcends shape. Premare quotes from the Hsing-li ta-ch'iian (HLTC) where he translates Chu Hsi as stating: In the universe, there is li and there is ch'i. What one understands by li is the Reason which is above all shape and which is like the root from which all entities derive. What one understands by ch'i is the vase, subject to the shape and the instrument by which everything is made.23 Although Pr6mare worked at a time when sinological research was in its early stages, his scholarly standards were high. Characteristically, we find him taking</page><page sequence="9">397 care to include the Chinese characters from which this translation is made.24 It is certainly possible to question this translation by Premare, but the grounds for doing so probably would be occasioned as much by the inherent difficulty of the subject matter as by linguistic deficiency on Premare's part. Still, his use of "Reason" to translate tao could be faulted. In this interpretation, Premare goes on to say that li is the same thing as tao, but this is much too sweeping an identification. In this passage, Chu Hsi is merely using one aspect of tao to explain li. This usage is apparent in the very parallel structure of the passage in which Chu Hsi explains li and ch'i using two phrases for each. Li is the tao of what transcends form and the source of the generation of things. Ch'i is the instrument of what inheres in form and the means of the generation of things. (Li yeh che hsing erh shang chih tao yeh. Sheng wu chih pen yeh. Ch'i yeh che hsing erh sha chih ch'i yeh. Sheng wu chih chu yehaC.) Chu Hsi intends here to equate tao with li only to the extent that they both show a certain transcendence of concrete form. But though they may share this quality of transcendence, they are not identically transcendent. Tao tends to be more associated with the process of development while li tends more towards a stability of patterning and internal structure. (2) Ch'i manifests itself in the alternating cycles of motion and rest. Premare tentatively translates ch'i as "matter," but his tentativeness seems to show some awareness of the inadequacy of the translation. More precisely, we take ch'i to be "matter-energy" or "material force." (3) The two basic qualities of motion and rest further subdivide into the five categories of water, fire, wood, metal, and earth. Li pervades all aspects of this system. These three points of summary are probably derived from Chou Tun-i's "Explanation of the Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate" (T'ai-chi t'u shuoad), where great emphasis is laid upon the cosmological unfolding into active and quiescent forces and consequently into the five agents. Premare goes on to explain that ch'i is akin to an invisible and uncongealed liquid without sensation. When it congeals, it becomes hsingae, a body with form and shape. He states that this body manifests itself through the alternating phases of movement and quiescence. This leads Premare into the explanation of the "two fixed points,"25 whether of greatest heat and greatest cold in the yearly cycle or of noon and midnight in the daily cycle or of generation and decay in the life cycle or of inhaling and exhaling in the respiratory cycle. He refers to yang as matter (ch'i?) in a state of increase, and yin as matter in a state of decrease. Premare notes that some missionaries have concluded that this Neo- Confucian philosophical system equals the impiety of the pantheism of the Dutch philosopher, Baruch Spinoza (1632-1677). In Spinoza's system, God becomes identified with the laws and minifestations of the universe. This differs from the Judeo-Christian sense of a God who transcends the universe and is</page><page sequence="10">398 Mungello responsive to human needs. Premare quotes these missionary critics as stating: Chu Hsi and his disciples say of t'ai-chi all that which the ancient ching (classics) have said of t'ienaf, of shang-tiag, etc. But it is clear that t'ai-chi is none other than the atheistic li of the Chinese; therefore t'ien, shang-ti, etc. are nothing more than the atheistic li of the Chinese.26 A key to this argument is the interpretation of li. These missionary critics interpreted li as atheistic and consequently, t'ai-chi, t'ien, and shang-ti all acquired an atheistic tone. But Premare disagreed with these missionaries and felt that li was compatible with Christianity. Furthermore, he felt that the basis for his claim of compatibility was clearly present in the Chinese texts, par- ticularly in those of Sung Neo-Confucianism. There is a tone about Premare's sympathetic interpretation of Chinese culture that is reminiscent of Matteo Ricci. Premare's fellow Figurist Bouvet did not share Premare's concern for exonerating the Chinese moderns from charges of atheism. Bouvet's accommodation of Christianity with indigenous Chinese religion was aimed at Chinese antiquity. In Bouvet's view, the ancient Chinese had known a form of natural religion fully complementary to Christianity, but this natural religion had since been corrupted by modern literati, as well as by Buddhists and Taoists. Ricci held many views which were later shared by the Figurists regarding a sympathetic interpretation of ancient Chinese religion, but Ricci also extended this sympathy to contemporary Chinese literati, though not to Buddhists. Ricci also happened to be one of the most deeply learned of the missionaries in the Chinese language and culture. Premare shared some of Ricci's depth of learning as well as his accommodating views toward the modern literati. Nevertheless, when Premare comes to explain how the modern literati (that is, Neo-Confucian philosophers) avoid atheism, he finds it necessary to disagree with some of the interpretations of Chu Hsi, even though his rebuttal always uses citations from other Chinese authors. Consequently, Premare believes his disagreement to be entirely based on what the Chinese themselves maintain. Premare's disagreement with Chu Hsi's interpretation begins by centering on two main points. The first is Chu Hsi's treatment of Chou Tun-i's important phrase, "wu-chi erh t'ai-chiah," and the second is Chu Hsi's interpretation of li and ch'i. The phrase "wu-chi erh t'ai-chi" is the first statement of Chou Tun-i's cosmology, contained in the "Explanation of the Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate." This diagram is one of the foundations of Sung Neo-Confucian metaphysics and is so frequently referred to that its significance is central to Sung Neo-Confucianism as a whole. The grammatical particle "erh" is crucial to the interpretation. The question revolves between the extremes of whether erh links two elements which have ontological parity, such as in the phrase "wu-chi AND t'ai-chi," or whether it links two elements, one of which has ontological priority, such as in the phrase "wu-chi THEN tai-chi." In inter- preting both the phrase "wu-chi erh t'ai-chi" and the pair of terms li and ch'i,</page><page sequence="11">399 Chu Hsi tends toward a complementary and cyclical treatment, while Premare tends toward a hierarchical and linear explanation. Premare regards li as "Reason" and ch'i as "matter" and makes a parallel treatment of wu-chi as "eternal Reason" and t'ai-chi as "matter still in chaos." To support his position, Premare draws from the Taoist Chuang Tzu (339?-295?B.c.), to whom he attributes the following statement: "Reason (tao) existed before t'ai-chi" (Tao tsai t'ai-chi chih hsienai).27 However, Premare's quotation of the Chinese text is misleading, though his interpretation is not necessarily false. This is the only occurrence of the term t'ai-chi in Chuang Tzu's Nan hua chingaj, and it is doubtful that it carries all of the metaphysical connotations which appear in the Neo-Confucian usage on which Premare is relying. Consequently, modern translators have chosen less metaphysical renderings for this earlier occurrence and feel that Chuang Tzu's intended meaning of t'ai-chi is close to "all time" or "the highest point."28 Premare further quotes from a commentary by a Wang Shen (the Ming dynasty literatus?) on Chou Tun-i's phrase "wu-chi erh t'ai-chi": In the beginning, when there was not yet either t'ai-chi nor heaven nor earth, the Reason (li) which produces without limits existed from that time. Although it may not be represented by any image, although there may be no name able to designate it, it is infinite in all genres, and one can add nothing to it. This is why Chou-tzu (Lien-hsi) says that this is "the illumined and infinite being.29 Premare goes on to say that Chu Hsi is wrong to think that the circle which is the first figure in the "Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate" symbolizes "wu-chi erh t'ai-chi." Premare believes that the circle symbolizes infinite Reason in a manner not unfamiliar to European sages. Furthermore, he says that both Wang Shenak and Lu Hsiang-shan (1139-1193) agreed on this point and dis- agreed with Chu Hsi. Here Premare is touching upon what was a prime source of disagreement in Chu Hsi's system. Chou Tun-i had borrowed heavily from Taoist sources in composing his treatise on the "Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate." The diagram itself was probably of Taoist origin, and, as Wing-tsit Chan points out, the term wu-chi (ultimate of nonbeing) comes from chapter 28 of the Lao Tzu.30 In the following passage, Premare clarifies how he believes that Chou Tun-i's interpretation of "wu-chi erh t'ai-chi" differs from that of Chu Hsi: Chou Lien-hsi, the master of the Sung-ju, acknowledged an infinite Reason which existed before there was any matter and which had produced everything. This is the meaning which the particle erh presents, and which he had placed between wu-chi and t'ai-chi, and secondly that t'ai-chi or the material of the world, has existed only because there was a long time earlier an eternal and unlimited Reason, wu-chi, from which t'ai-chi has received its existence. That is so true that in the explication of his system, nowhere has it said that t'ai-chi was li. On the contrary, it is said that "the five elements are yin and yang; that yin, yang are t'ai-chi; and that t'ai-chi has for its origin wu-chi."31 The section within quotation marks at the end of the above passage is taken</page><page sequence="12">400 Mungello from the HLTC 1:24b and presumably originates with Chou Tun-i himself. The HLTC passage in which it appears is retracing the process of cosmic generation from the five agents (wu-hsing) back to the source. The following translation of the last sentence of the same passage is more literal than Premare's rendering and emphasizes the parallelism a bit more: The five agents are unified within (i.e. reducible to) yin and yang. Yin and yang are unified in (i.e. reducible to) t'ai-chi. T'ai-chi is rooted in (i.e. originates in) wu-chi. In this passage, wu-chi appears to be more fundamental than t'ai-chi. Premare combines several quotations from the first chapter of the HLTC to form the argument that while Chou Tun-i would concede the fundamental importance of the process of motion succeeded by quiescence,32 he would reject the words which Chu Hsi draws from Ch'eng I which states "movement and quiescence have no end at all; yin and yang have no beginning at all."33 Premare believes that the process has a beginning and an end. This beginning and end is wu-chi or its equivalent, li, and approaches Premare's conception of God. Premare's argument has a double foundation. It is not based solely on whether he can prove that Chu Hsi's system is reconcilable with Christian monotheism. He does attempt this reconciliation, but he also bases his argument on his perception of a great deal more diversity in Chinese thought than Europeans. recognized. He argues that it is a misconception to think that Chu Hsi's system is overwhelmingly accepted by the Chinese.34 While conceding that Chu Hsi's interpretations are important in the official examinations and may be aban- doned by the examinee only with great caution, he notes that Chu Hsi's views, in other situations, have been frequently and successfully rebutted. Further- more, while Chu Hsi's commentary on the Four Books holds great respect, Premare believes that it is far easier for Chinese to abandon his commentaries on the five ching (classics). In this regard, Premare claims that Chu Hsi has commented upon only two of the classics-the Book of Odes (Shih Ching) and the Book of Changes (I Ching).35 Premare states that Chu Hsi has been criticized for giving an elegant and lascivious interpretation to many of the odes of the first book of the Book of Odes. Premare also states that Chu Hsi's views on the Book of Changes have been refuted in the Chou-i che chungal [Annotations to the Book of Changes] (22 chiian, 1715). Premare misleadingly implies that a considerable portion of the authorship of this book belongs to the K'ang-hsi emperor, but the emperor was merely the official sponsor. The chief editor was Li Kuang-ti, who was well versed in the Changes, and he was assisted by, among others, Hu Hstiam (1655-1736) who was also a very diligent student of the classic.36 Nevertheless, unlike other missionaries, Premare does not abandon Chu Hsi. Much of the effort in the Lettre is devoted to proving that it is ". . . false that Chu Hsi and the authors who follow him may be atheists."37 The most tenuous part of Premare's attempt to reconcile Chu Hsi's system with Christian mono-</page><page sequence="13">401 theism occurs when he deals with the primal categories of li and ch'i. Premare accurately detects an unresolved tension in Chu Hsi's interpretation of li and ch'i. On a temporal level, li and ch'i are of equal priority, but on a logical level, li, for Chu Hsi, is of greater priority than ch'i. Unfortunately, the chronological and logical distinctions are not as clear-cut nor as satisfactory as they might initially appear, and Chu Hsi never fully resolves the tension. Premare finds it impossible to live with this tension and feels that a monotheistic system requires an unquestionably prior entity. This is why Premare tries to break the tension in Chu Hsi's system by elevating li to a more prior status than Chu Hsi gives it. Premare deals at length with this problem. There is no doubt that Premare is familiar with Chu Hsi's own explanations of the tension between li and ch'i. This is clearly evident in his selection of passages from Chu Hsi's writings to present this tension to the reader. For example: Li and ch'i are very certainly two things. If one considers the actually existent entities, these two things are so well united together that there are no means of separating them in order to place each one apart. That does not prevent this from being two very different things. But if one considers purely li, although there was no shaped entity, ii-the Reason of all entities-existed alone and it had nothing else before it.38 Premare feels that he could reconcile monotheism with the preceding state- ment by Chu Hsi but notes that Chu Hsi seems to contradict the same passage in statements found in the same chapter of the HLTC. Premare translated Chu Hsi as stating: Matter [ch'i] ... can be congealed and united and by these means compose and form different beings. But as regards Reason [li], certainly that has no affection, nor sight, nor desire, nor thought and can make nothing. But as soon as the Matter [ch'i] is solidified, Reason is found in its midst.39 and Li is a very vast, pure void. It has never left any trace behind of itself. It is indubitable that it can make nothing. This is uniquely done by Matter [ch'i] which by means of its diverse workings and gatherings, produces all things.40 In the Neo-Confucian interpretation, if li lacks affection, sight, desire, thought, and the ability to create, does this mean that ch'i possesses them? No. It has been stated above that ch'i lacks sensation. From what then does consciousness derive? It derives from the uniting of li and ch'i. From this point of view, li and ch'i are clearly abstractions of the mind or tools for analyzing reality. Taken separately, they have no real status. Premare appears to recognize this point, but feels that it is not conclusive. Rather, he sees a contradiction between Chu Hsi's treatment of li and ch'i as abstractions and li and ch'i as real entities, in which li is prior to ch'i. Part of Premare's perception of a contradiction in Chu Hsi's treatment of li</page><page sequence="14">402 Mungello and ch'i stems from Premare's misinterpretation of ch'i and is partly the result of seeing the Chinese term through the filter of a Western conception of creation which is prominent in Christian thinking. This is reflected in Premare's trans- lation of ch'i as "matter." "Matter" in this conception of creation is passive and requires not only a directing but also an activating force. Both the direction and activation are attributed to God. If either of these processes are denied to God, Premare feels that the role of God is destroyed and the result is atheism. However, the Chinese Neo-Confucianists attribute activation not to li, but to ch'i, and this is why ch'i must not be rendered merely as "matter" but as "matter- energy" or "material force." Ch'i is a chaotic material force and requires ordering. This is the role that is attributed to li. Li is the regulating and guiding aspect which supplies patterns to the material force. In projecting a Western conception of creation onto the Chinese conception, Premare distorts the Chinese conception and so finds the preceding quotations from Chu Hsi to be contradictory. In the Chinese context, they are not contradictory, but the question remains of whether they are reconcilable with Christian monotheism. The problem is a complex one, as we may gather by looking at the issue raised in the following statement by Premare: Do our philosophers of Europe not explain the machine of the world with matter and movement? Have they need of endlessly resorting to the One who had imparted movement to matter in order to inform by means of this that they are not at all atheists?41 Here Premare implies that movement, along with matter, may be discussed separately from God. In Europe this is precisely what the natural philosophers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries-the precursors of modern natural scientists-were beginning to do. The deist view which sees God as creating the world but then leaving it to run on its own laws of matter and motion was coming into prominence. Premare's implication is that even though God may impart movement to matter (ch'i), movement is not an attribute of God However, in the Chinese conception, ch'i already possesses motion. Conse- quently, the Chinese perspective could only interpret the notion of 'imparting' to involve the flow of a directing force to the activated, but unordered, material force. Is this sufficient to satisfy the Christian monotheistic conception of God? While Chu Hsi concedes a certain separation on a logical level in which there is a slight elevation of li over ch'i, it is questionable whether he concedes enough separation to satisfy the demands of Premare's conception of God. In rebuttal to Chu Hsi, Premare quotes from a contemporary literati named Yu Shih (Yu Wen Tzu) who rejects the Sung Neo-Confucian lack of separation of li from ch'i. Yu Shih turns to the greater authority of one of the classics, the Book of History (Shang shu).42 In the passages which are cited from the Book of History, Heaven is spoken of as a force that responds to all men impartially on the basis of what is felt in their hearts. Also, Heaven is said to reward virtue and punish evil.</page><page sequence="15">403 Premare suggests that the problem of Chu Hsi-like dualisms in Chinese philosophy could be resolved by applying a trinitarian interpretation to certain classical phrases.43 Perhaps because he realizes that this trinitarian interpre- tation raises as many problems as it solves, he treats it as a digression from his main concern. Applying himself more forcefully to the problem of dualisms in Chu Hsi's philosophy, Premare believes that the difficulty may be resolved by recognizing that Chu Hsi used the term t'ai-chi in two different senses. In the first sense, t'ai-chi is equivalent to tao or "eternal Reason" which, Premare notes, Chou Tun-i referred to as wu-chi. In the second sense, t'ai-chi represents the idea, property, or reason of a given thing.44 Premare connects this second sense of t'ai-chi with the Chinese term tsean (pattern, rule, standard) and tang- jana? (what should be). Among the quotations which he uses to explain his point, Premare draws the following from the Book of Odes (Shih ching): "There is no being which does not have its nature, its essence (yu wu yu tseaP)."45 Premare attempts to connect this idea of the li (principle) of each thing with the notion of the soul of man, which he refers to as ming-te (literally, "illumi- nated power-virtue"). To do this, he translated Chu Hsi's commentary on the first line of the Great Learning (Ta hsiieh) that ming-te ... is that power which man received from Heaven. It is disengaged from matter, it is intelligent, it is not of itself mysterious. This is why it receives all reason and responds to all types of affairs.46 (Ming-te che jen chih so te yu t'ien erh hsii ling pu wei i chu chung li erh ying wen shih che yeh.aq) Drawing upon the comments of the Neo-Confucianist, Ts'ai Ch'ingar (1453- 1508), Premare finally arrives at a position where he can accept Chu Hsi's in- separability of li and ch'i.47 Ts'ai Ch'ing explains Chu Hsi's comment on the Great Learning passage by referring to the heart as a material element which functions in its complete role only insofar as it is spiritual, intelligent, conscious, and sensible to perceptions. In one sense, the heart is flesh (that is, the ch'i aspect), but in another sense it is a spiritual and conscious element (that is, the li aspect). It is only as it becomes spiritual and conscious that it can come into contact with the spiritual and conscious elements in the rest of the world and find its appropriate place in that context. As mere fleshly heart, it cannot perceive the spiritual and conscious elements. Premare goes on to draw a parallel to geometry. The thought of three angles being equal to two right angles immediately raises the corresponding thought of a right triangle. (A right triangle consists of one right angle (90 degrees) and two other angles whose sum is equal to 90 degrees.) For Premare, the conception of three angles being equal in degrees to two right angles represents reasoning or the li aspect. The figure of the right triangle represents a mani- festation or the ch'i aspect. Premare concludes the first half of the essay by conceding a great deal of subtlety to the reasoning of Sung Neo-Confucianism. In the face of this subtlety, Premare sees no sufficiently subtle argument to sustain the claim that Neo-Confucianists are atheists.</page><page sequence="16">404 Mungello The second half of the Lettre deals with the bases of monotheism found in the Confucian classics and in Neo-Confucian texts. Premare's concern with Chu Hsi diminishes somewhat because the subject matter becomes less meta- physical and more specifically religious than in the first part of the Lettre. However, Chu Hsi remains a central figure because, as Premare makes very clear, it is to his name and to those of his followers that the charges of atheism are principally attached.48 We have already discussed Premare's attempt to show that Chu Hsi's authority was not quite so overwhelming as many critics of Chinese religions regarded it to be. After dealing with what Premare regards as Chu Hsi's metaphysical support of monotheism, Premare now takes up Chu Hsi's support of monotheism on other grounds. Drawing upon the Chu-tzu ch'iian-shu (CTCS), Premare states: "... one concludes that this blue vault which revolves over our heads has a true master who governs it; and . . 'that it is Reason (li) which makes it so.' "4 Pr&amp;mare then quotes Chu Hsi: "To wish that there was in heaven a man who notes and judges crimes, that is not possible, to also say that Reason is not at all the master which governs it, that can be even less."50 The CTCS passage from which Premare draws is an interesting one and might be worth translating in its entirety, especially as the editor of the Lettre, Pauthier, feels that Premare's translation is not exact. The whole passage (my translation) states: Tias [Lord] is li [principle] acting as chuat [master]. The blue sky is called t'ien [Heaven]. It revolves and turns endlessly. Being like that, now some say that Heaven has a man in it who judges crimes. Certainly this cannot be so. Some, on the other hand, say that the tao is completely without a master. This too cannot be so.51 In this passage, Chu Hsi seems to reject the extremes of anthropomorphic deity on one hand and atheism on the other hand. Premare goes on to recognize the various meanings of the term for 'Heaven' by quoting Chu Hsi's statement that t'ien (Heaven) "... sometimes designates the blue vault [tsang-tsangaU], sometimes it signifies the sovereign worker of all things [chu-tsaia"] and some- times it denotes reason [li] alone."52 Neo-Confucianism lays great stress on the connection between Heaven and man. The medium of this connection is hsingaw (the inherent nature). Premare is not only very aware of this connection, but he also uses it as support for his contention that Neo-ConfLlcianism contains a monotheism. Premare quotes from Tzu Ssu, who begins the Doctrine of the Mean (Chung yung), with the statement "The mandate of Heaven, this is what is called Nature [hsing]."53 In addition to drawing from this prime Neo-Confucian source, Pr6mare demonstrates his familiarity with the foundations of Neo-Confucianism by quoting from the Mencius: "When one knows his own nature, one knows Heaven."54 So in Neo-Confucianism, one's nature is not only the means by which Heaven transmits its laws to men, but it is also the object of study for coming into harmony with Heaven. In Premare's view, this stress on Heaven</page><page sequence="17">405 as both guiding force and-indirectly via hsing-the object of devoted attention supports his contention that Neo-Confucianism does contain monotheism. Premare also draws from the Analects where Confucius states that "... at the age of fifty years, he understood the mandate of Heaven."55 This phrase is taken from the frequently quoted passage in which Confucius describes the stages of his path toward wisdom.56 In discussing this passage, Premare quotes from Ch'eng I: When one designates the sovereign Master, one says Ti, the Lord.-One will ask who is this sovereign Master?-I answer: He is very certainly a sovereign Lord, because the heaven, very vigorous and very rapid, revolves naturally without end. But the reason why it turns thusly without stopping is that there is without doubt a sovereign Master who governs it. But it is necessary that each person respond within to these sorts of questions because there are no words at all which are able to express this.57 The second half of the Lettre continues the monotheistic argument with Premare quoting from a number of authors and exhibiting a broad familiarity in dealing with Chinese texts. Because this article has emphasized Premare's quotations from Neo-Confucian authors, it may have given the impression that his sources are more limited than they actually are. Premare's larger work, Vestiges, provides ample opportunity for a study of his extensive use of sources outside of Neo-Confucianism, and especially for his sources in the Chinese classics. CONCLUSION The writings of Jesuit missionaries on China are frequently criticized for being distorted by their proselytizing concerns. One can hardly deny that the ultimate motive of the Jesuits included religious conversion, but it does not follow from this that the value of their work to contemporary study is as negligible as is widely believed. Some of the Jesuits clearly stood above their fellows in their knowledge of Chinese culture and in their contribution to the study of this culture. Premare was one of these Jesuits. His concern for justifying a mono- theistic interpretation of Chinese culture would be shared by few contemporary students, but it is my belief that this same motivation led him to a number of insights into Chinese philosophy which deserve our attention. Premare was one of the first Europeans to recognize the diversity of the philosophical point of view in China, although his recognition remained largely unappreciated. Rather, European sinology, for the most part, accepted the Chinese myth of cultural homogeneity until the beginning of the twentieth century.58 Secondly, the Figurist views of Premare and his fellows contained a universal outlook which carried them beyond being simply Christian. Uni- versalism in approach was slow to develop in European sinology. Because China was regarded as a unique civilization, many of the great advances in nineteenth-century philological and linguistic studies were not applied to</page><page sequence="18">406 Mungello China. It is true that the specific form which Figurist universalism took was not eventually confirmed, but the perspective of applying universal methods and achieving universal truths is something which Western students of China were slow to achieve until the twentieth century. Thirdly, Premare achieved, with a few notable exceptions, an accurate and even sophisticated understand- ing of basic Neo-Confucian philosophy and of such difficult conceptions as are contained in the terms wu-chi, t'ai-chi, li, and ch'i. Finally, an extended firsthand experience of Chinese culture helped give to Premare a language facility which was to be unequalled by European sinologists for a hundred years. When the first European university chair in Chinese was initiated at the College de France in 1814, it was necessary to appoint a man who had been self-trained in Chinese.59 Premare's manuscripts of the Lettre and Vestiges remained unpublished until 1861 and 1878, respectively, at least in part because of the lack of European editors sufficiently knowledgeable in the Chinese language and classical texts. And France was the leader in European sinology! But, in conclusion, I would like to suggest that it is not Premare's scholarly achievements in themselves, most of which have since been surpassed, which offer the most meaning to the contemporary student of China. Rather, it is the relationship between Premare's motivations and his conclusions. To perceive the value of this relationship, we must first be able to regard Premare as a serious student of Chinese culture, not totally unlike ourselves. This article has tried to show that he was such a student. Secondly, we must be able to move away from an obsession with the inadvisability of his specific proselytizing motivation to ask how his motivations affected his conclusions, in positive as well as negative terms. In contrast with the view that objectivity of motives is always preferable in scholarship, it appears that Premare's motives may have had positive effects upon his scholarship which outweighed the negative effects. If Premare's preoccupying motives had an overall positive effect on his scholar- ship, it is possible that this phenomenon extends to other periods of scholarship up to today. When one considers how post-1949 American scholarship on China has been influenced by political considerations, one can see that there is much to occupy us. Furthermore, the current ideological coloring of much of the scholarship-scientific as well as humanistic-coming from mainland China requires that we become more sensitive to evaluating the relationship between motives and conclusions rather than rejecting the scholarship because of its ideological underpinnings. I believe that studying such interpreters as Premare helps us to develop this sensitivity. But then this is matter for thought, as well as work for the future.</page><page sequence="19">407 NOTES 1.

Jean Pierre Guillaume Pauthier (1801-1873), the French sinologist who edited this work, tells us that Premare's original manuscript in the Bibliotheque Imperiale (present Bibliotheque Nationale?) of Paris includes the Chinese text for all passages from which Premare draws. However, some of this Chinese textual material was omitted through editing prior to publication. Lettre, p. 4, n. 2. 25. Lettre, p. 8. 26. Premare does not identify these critics other than to refer to them as "two or three mission- aries" (Lettre, p. 9). At least three Jesuits had written criticisms of such Neo-Confucian terms as t'ai-chi, li, and ch'i. They and their works are as follows: Julius Aleni (Ai Ju-liiehaz, 1582-1649) wrote San-shan lun-hsiehba [Discussing learning on the San-shan] (1625); Johann Adam Schall von Bell (T'ang Jo-wangbb, 1592-1666) wrote Chu-chih ch'un-chengbc [Of Divine Providence as proven by various reasons] (1692); and Francois Noel (Wei Fang-chibd, 1651-1729) wrote Jen-tsui chih- chungbe [The heaviest of man's sins] (1698). (See George H. C. Wong, "The Anti-Christian Move- ment in China: Late Ming and Early Ch'ing," Tsing Hua Journal of Chinese Studies. New series III, no. 1 (May 1962): 193-194.) Of the three Jesuits, only Noel was a contemporary of Premare's. 27. Chuang Tzu, Nan hua ching, ch. 6, quoted in Lettre, pp. 10-11. 28. Premare's quotation of the Chinese text is misleading because while the implied subject of the phrase being quoted is tao, tao does not explicitly appear at the beginning of the phrase in the manner that Premare has quoted it. Tao does appear at the beginning of the passage of which this phrase is a part. Furthermore, the quoted phrase is part of a larger statement which lies in an important parallel relationship with another statement. These statements are: "Tsai t'ai-chi chih hsien erh pu wei kao. Tsai liu-chi chih hsia erh pu wei shenbf." There is a strong parallel between the terms t'ai-chi and liu-chibg (literally, "the six points of direction"; less literally, "space"). Burton Watson's translation treats t'ai-chi and liu-chi as presenting a spatial contrast and renders the passage as: [The Way] exists beyond the highest point [t'ai-chi], and yet you cannot call it lofty; it exists beneath the limit of the six directions, and yet you cannot call it deep. [Burton Watson, trans., The Complete Works of Chuang Tzu (New York: Columbia University Press, 1968), p. 81.] An earlier translation by Richard Wilhelm treats t'ai-chi and liu-chi as a temporal-spatial contrast and the passage is rendered as follows: Er [i.e. tao] war vor aller Zeit [t'ai-chi] und ist nicht hoch; er ist jenseits alles Raumes und ist nicht tief. ("It [i.e. tao] was before all time [t'ai-chi] and yet is not lofty. It is beyond all space and is not deep.") [Richard Wilhelm, trans., Dschuang Dsi (Jena, E. Diedrichs, 1920), p. 49.] 29.

It is worth noting that Premare's distinction between Chou Tun-i's and Chu Hsi's respective treatments of the relationship between t'ai-chi and li is partially supported in a recent article by Wing-tsit Chan. The latter states: "Chou Tun-i did not equate the Great Ultimate</page><page sequence="21">409 [t'ai-chi] with principle [li]. In fact, he did not hint of any possible relationship.

Pr6mare's claim on page 26 of the Lettre that Chu Hsi commented upon only two of the ching (classics) is questionable. In the Chu-tzu yii-leibh [Conversations of Master Chu], one may find informal commentaries by Chu Hsi on the other three of the five classics, namely, the Book of History (Shang shu), the Spring and Autumn Annals (Ch'un-ch'iu), and the Rites (Li), in addition to commentaries on the Changes and the Odes. 36. Hu Hsu is the author of an intensive study of the Book of Changes entitled Chou-i han shubi (52 chiian). The original manuscript is said to have contained 158 chiian. The 52 chiian edition was not published as a whole until presented to the Ssu-k'u ch'iian-shubj editors in 1773. 37. Lettre, p. 26. 38. This English translation was made from Pr6mare's French translation of the HLTC 26:3b as quoted in the Lettre, p. 17. Although I find no serious fault with Pr6mare's translation, it might be useful to compare it to an English translation which I have made directly from the Chinese. So-called li and ch'i really are two entities, but if regarded from the aspect of a thing, these two entities are melded together and unable to be separated. Each of them abides in one place and they are indistinguishable. Each of the two entities are one thing. But if regarded from the point of view of li, although the thing does not yet exist, there is already the li of the thing. Moreover, there exists this li, yet the thing does not yet have a distinguishable reality. 39. HLTC 26:2b, quoted in Lettre, p. 17. 40. HLTC 26:3a, quoted in Lettre, p. 18. 41. Lettre,p. 18. 42. Book of History IV, v, 3, 1; IV, iv, 4, and IV, vi, 2 (Legge translation), quoted in Lettre, pp. 18-19. These quotations from the Book of History are said to be found in what is described by Premare as a dictionary entitled "Pin-tseu-tsien" (Pin chou chien?), p. 9. The work is said to have been authored by a Yu Shih (Yu Wen Tzu?) and published in 1676. 43. Some of these classical phrases and their trinitarian translations would be as follows: (1) T'ai-chi tan san wei ibk ["T-ai-chi includes three which are only one"]; (2) T'ai-i ho sanb' ["The supreme unity gathers together the three"]; and (3) Ku che t'ien tzu ssu shen san ibm ["The ancient kings sacrificed to a trinitarian and single spirit"]. Though he concedes that Chu Hsi did not use such a trinitarian interpretation, Pr6mare nevertheless believes that it resolves the apparent con- tradiction of how t'ai-chi can be both nontheistic and theistic. In this trinitarian interpretation of t'ai-chi there is (a) t'ai-chi as eternal, unlimited, and prior to creation; (b) t'ai-chi as something created and limited, which may be spiritual or material; and (c) t'ai-chi as a deity which unites in itself the creator and the created, the king and subject, God and man.

In its entirety, the Analects passage reads: The Master said, 'At fifteen, I had my mind bent on learning. At thirty, I stood firm. At forty, I had no doubts. At fifty, I knew the decrees of Heaven. At sixty, my ear was an obedient organfor the reception of truth. At seventy, I could follow what my heart desired, without transgressing what was right (Legge, Analects II, iv, 1-6). 57.
