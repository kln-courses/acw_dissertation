<plain_text><page sequence="1">GEOLOGY. By G. W. Tyrrell, A.R.C.Sc., D.Sc., F.R.S.E., The University, Glasgow. Granitisation, Metasomatism, Metamorphism and Tectonics The great granitisation controversy still goes on merrily and the big guns, not to say the atom bombers, on both sides have come into action. Two symposia have been held, which have done much to clarify the issues. The first is reported in Memoir 28 of the Geological Society of America (1948) ; the second in the Report of the International Geological Congress , 18th Session (Great Britain, 1948), Pt. Ill, 1950. Opinion seems to be rapidly crystallising to H. H. Read's common-sense conclusion that there are " Granites and Granites " (Geolň Soc. Amer. Mem. 28, 1948, 1-19). There is, he suggests, no unique solution of the problem, and " no need for an either-or attitude." The problem is essentially one of the inter- pretation of the facts of the field. To Read, the making of granite, migmatisation and regional metamorphism are all parts of the one process which, following Lyell, he has styled plutonism. Volcanism is essentially different and separate from plutonism in its nature</page><page sequence="2">716 SCIENCE PROGRESS and geological setting. Bead gives a masterly summary and criticism of the magmatic theory of the origin of granite, and dis- cusses such topics as the room problem, the granitisation process, the occurrence of feldspars in the adjacent country rocks identical with those of the granite, diffusion in the solid (on which he suspends judgment), the plutonie rocks, and " mobilisation." The con- clusion is : " Whether as migma or, if the process goes far enough, as magma, granitic material may move into higher levels of the crust and produce there the discordant granite bodies with aureoles of thermal metamorphism.,, There might thus arise a granitic series depending on the mobility of the material. Termier's opinion that granites with a narrow aureole of thermal metamorphism are magmatic, while those surrounded by vast masses of regionally metamorphosed rocks have been made by processes of granitisation, seems to be eminently reasonable. This view is reinforced by Raguin's classification, granites ďanatexie and granites en massifs circonscrits . In other words there are granites - and granites ! Professor Read further clarifies his position in his second Presi- dential Address to the Geological Society of London on " A Con- templation of Time in Plutonism " (Quart Journ. Geol. S oc., CV, 1949, 101-56). " As the whole operation of plutonism," he says, " depends upon the activity of migma-magma, it is necessary to deal with the time relations of crystallisation, deformation, granitisa- tion, migmatisation, metamorphism, intrusion and orogeny." The concept of the Granite Series " attempts to relate the plutonie phenomena at the various levels of exposure, and to give a unity to the processes of granitisation, migmatisation and metamorphism at depth, and at successively higher positions and later times. " The series begins with the autochthonous granites associated with migmatites and metamorphites produced in situ in the depths. The movement of the granitised material provides the successive terms of the series. The parting of envelope and core, the structural control of movement, straining off, selective mobilisation, over- taking, and chemical variation in the series, are discussed. The Granite Series ends with the late high-level plutons emplaced as viscous masses." The Granite Series is thus viewed as " linking granites in time, place and character. Place may vary vertically or horizontally, time differences may be small or immense, characters may be seemingly inconstant." But, " although there may be granites and granites, most of them are of one kind, and all of them may likely be of one connected origin." The two Presidential Addresses of Professor Read are likely to become classics of this fundamental study.</page><page sequence="3">GEOLOGY 717 G. E. Goodspeed is one of the few American geologists who incline decidedly to the metamorphic and metasomatic theories of the " Origin of Granites " ( Oeol . Soc . Amer. Mem . 28 , 1948, 55-78). He concentrates especially on field evidence and textural criteria, and describes transitional facies (replacement dikes, replacement breccias and metamorphic migmatites). Goodspeed does not pro- nounce on the relative efficiency of the " wet " and " dry " methods of diffusion, but appears to admit the possibility of both processes. He seems to stand with the exponents of the middle position that there are granites - and granites. In three long papers P. Misch, " Metasomatic Granitisation of Batholithic Dimensions " : Part I. " Synkinematic Granitisation in Nanga Parbat Area, NW. Himalayas " (Amer. Journ. Sci., 247, 1949, 209-45) ; Part II. " Static Granitisation in Sheku Area, NW. Yunnan (China) " (ibid., 372-406) ; Part III. " Relationships of Synkinematic and Static Granitisation " (ibid., 673-705), makes a very remarkable contribution to the granitisation controversy. In the first paper Misch takes up much the same position as Read's (although Read's name does not figure in his Bibliography) when he writes : " I wish to emphasise the general validity of the statement that high-grade regional metamorphism and synorogenic granitisa- tion are invariably and necessarily linked." In the Himalayan region which he describes, a thick series of ancient argillites with thin calcareous bands has been subjected to regional metamorphism during Early Tertiary orogeny. " Synkinematic metamorphism of the argillites progresses from slates and phyllites through mica- schists and paragneisses to silhmanite-paragneisses." Granitisation of the potash-predominant variety begins in the kyanite zone with porphyroblasts of microperthite, passing to potash-rich augen- gneisses of granitic aspect containing relict kyanite. Lit-par-lit replacement along active foliation planes produces banded gneisses. Tn the interior of the Nanga Parbat massif the process ends with a massive, coarse-grained granitic gneiss. The calcareous layers are not granitised but are preserved as conformable intercalations in the gneissose granite. There is complete structural continuity from the weakly metamorphosed area to the intensely granitised region. This is clearly one of the most complete examples of progressive granitisation yet described. The transformations have been effected by " granitising solutions." Most emphatically Misch is not a " dry " ! The second paper on static granitisation deals with granodiorite- porphyries which are believed to have been formed by the metaso- matic replacement of Mesozoic " red beds " in Yunnan. Stratifica-</page><page sequence="4">718 SCIENCE PROGRESS tion and the clastic textures of the sediments are largely preserved in the ensuing granodiorite-porphyries. The phenocrystic oligo- clase, microperthite and quartz of the porphyries are porphyro- blasts showing replacement features. Metasomatism took place at shallow depths and at a moderate temperature by rising solutions containing alkalis, especially soda. The third paper is of a general character and draws together the facts and conclusions from the study of the Nanga Parbat and Yunnan areas. We quote from the excellent summary to this paper : " Genetically, synkinematic granitisation is presented as a fundamental process in géosynclinal orogeny, and static granitisa- tion as its continuation after the end of orogeny. Post-orogenic conditions favour a carrying of the process into higher levels of the crust. Where only static granitisation is visible, the products of previous synkinematic granitisation may be concealed at depth. Granitic batholiths are considered as predominantly metasomatic, and the rise of magma in broad fronts to shallow levels without breaking through as unlikely. Mobilisation of metasomatised rock masses may more locally occur as a still more advanced stage of granitisation. To sum up, genetic unity of synkinematic and static granitisation in géosynclinal belts is emphasised." We regard this series of papers as one of the best statements of the moderate granitisation position. Most magmatists would admit that it would be very easy for arkoses to be transformed into granite, and for basalts and dolerites to be turned into gabbros, by simple metasomatic processes. An excellent instance of the transformation of arkose is reported by H. A. Coombs in his paper on " Granitisation in the Swauk Arkose near Wenatchee, Washington " {Amer. Journ. Sci., 248, 1950, 369-77). Along the axis of an anticline the arkoses have been locally transformed into a rock having the composition and texture of granodiorite. " The various steps in the granitisation process can be traced from the initial stages wherein the quartz is enlarged by secondary growths, and the plagioclase is rimmed with clear albite, to the final stage resulting in a coarse-grained rock of inter- locking crystals devoid of interstitial matter." The process seems to have taken place at comparatively low temperature, and only an extremely small amount of solutions may have been needed for the transformation. Dr. Doris L. Reynolds's paper " Observations concerning Granite " (Geol. en Mijnb., 11, No. 8, 1949, 241-53) presents as thorough a discussion and review of literature as Read's, combined with her own extensive observations on the subject, but from the more</page><page sequence="5">GEOLOGY 719 extreme Transformist standpoint. She discusses critically the original observations of Hutton on granite veins, and concludes that, while they are undoubtedly statements of fact, they do not bear the conclusion that Hutton drew from them, namely, that the granite was injected in the magmatic state. Great play is made with the now common observation that pods of granitic material are found completely isolated within the adjacent schists, etc., and MacCuIloch's neglected observations of 1816 on this phenomenon at Hutton's classic locality of Glen Tilt are brought into service. (The writer would like to be assured of the correctness of Mac- CuIloch's petrographical identifications on which much of the argument hangs.) Dr. Reynolds claims that " the Transformist interpretation of granite . . . satisfies the structural requirements, solves the space problem or at the worst reduces it to negligible proportions, and provides an explanation of the association with granite of basic roof-rocks and inclusions, and of aureoles of Fe-Mg enrichment." In his paper " Some Observations on Homogenization and on Geochemical Discontinuities in Granitic Areas," H. G. Backlund (Inter. Geol. Congr ., 18th Session , Great Britain 1948 , Report Part III , 1950, 31-44) endeavours to establish the proposition that the structural and textural peculiarities of megaporphyritic granites, and even-grained granites, can be correlated with the respective tectonic styles of the sedimentary formations within which they are emplaced. The former are developed by the transformation of sediments of fairly equal competence with harmonious isoclinal folding. The even-grained granites, on the other hand, are developed within sediments of varying competence that show crumpling and disorderly folding. The highly involved reasoning and the geöchemical considerations on which these generalisations are based are difficult to understand ; but that may be the writer's fault. Professor Backlund's mental eyes have the same faculty of piercing solid granite as Sam Weller's imaginary eyes had of pene- trating a brick wall. Backlund points out that geochemical dis- continuities in the ores associated with granitic masses militate against the theory of their magmatic origin but, on the other hand, harmonise with geochemical discontinuities within the sedimentary rocks from which granites have been developed according to the Transformist theory. On the other hand, Backlund believes in the gradual " homogenisation " of granites through the continued operation of the transforming agencies - a process which might be thought to have " ironed out " the geochemical discontinuities also.</page><page sequence="6">720 SCIENCE PROGRESS The following is a summary translation of the Abstract of C. E. Wegmann's paper, " Transformations métasomatiques et Analyse tectonique " (Inter. Geol. Congr., 18th Session , Great Britain 1948 , Report Part III , 1950, 45-52) : " The idea of the transformation of sediments has its roots in stratigraphical and tectonic studies, for both Pre-Cambrian and Post-Cambrian terrains. Sederholm found that he could only succeed with the aid of the metamorphic prin- ciples developed by the early French school. These origins are important for the logical structure and evolution of Transformism. The development of physical chemistry and the application of its rules to petrological problems has limited the field of view of many researchers to physico-chemical interpretations. These schools are inspired, each in its own way, by laboratory data, ending with the aid of extended extrapolations in very different results ; but the framework of stratigraphical, tectonic and kinematic facts must delimit the field of extrapolation. The progress of tectonic analysis permits the construction of a framework exhibiting the phenomena from the angle of geochemical tectonics. Wegmann, as shown by previous work also, is of the school of Backlund and Reynolds, with a tendency to stress the tectonic aspect of Transformism. " Granitisation of géosynclinal sediments in an orogenic setting is now a widely accepted theory, but the purpose of D. L. Reynolds's paper " The Transformation of Caledonian Granodiorite to Tertiary Granophyre on Slieve Gullion, Co. Armagh, Northern Ireland " (Inter. Geol. Congr., 18th Session, Great Britain 1948 , Report Part III , 1950, 20-30) is to describe an occurrence of granitisation within a kratogenic setting. In this paper she describes a spectacular series of changes whereby the Caledonian granodiorite of Newry has been transformed into typical Tertiary granophyre. The initial stages of transformation appear within the solid granodiorite as it approaches the down-faulted Tertiary volcanic pile of Slieve Gullion. More advanced changes are found within definite horizons of explosion breccias. The transition is illustrated by nine chemical analyses which, when plotted, give a regular variation-diagram. Dr. Reynolds, in collaboration with A. Holmes, has also published a paper on " A Front of Metasomatic Metamorphism in the Dal- radian of Co. Donegal " (C.R. Soc. Géol. Finlande , No. 20, 1947), which the writer unfortunately has not yet seen, but it doubtless represents a further illustration of the doctrine of " fronts " which is associated with these authors. In a memoir on " The Geology of the Osi Area, Ilorin Province," B. C. King and A. M. J. de Swardt (Geol. Svrv. Nigeria , Bull. No. 20 , 1949, 92 pp.) describe and discuss a complicated succession in</page><page sequence="7">GEOLOGY 721 the Pre-Cambrian Complex of Nigeria. Within an Older Gneiss Complex at least one of possibly several granite cycles has been recognised. These gneisses were later invaded by sheets of basic rocks (metagabbro). The whole complex was then penetrated by a large mass of coarse porphyritic granite. The authors discuss the study of textures in petrogenetic interpretations, the significance of " fronts " in granitisation in relation to ionic mobility, and the relations between granite emplacement and structures. Further, they adopt the conclusions of Lapadu-Hargues concerning the order of mobility of common elements in transformation processes, i.e. K (least), Ca, Na, Mg, Fe (greatest). Yet, as Bowen says, the large K atom, " must be assumed to be among the most susceptible to solid diffusion if granites are to be formed by that process. More- over Mg ... is both lighter and smaller than K. Why does Mg lag behind in this process of granitisation by solid diffusion ? " The authors favour, on the whole, the " dry " granitisation processes. This memoir is outstanding for its clarity and excellent mode of presentation. The Geological Survey of Nigeria is to be congratu- lated on publishing a purely theoretical and scientific memoir not- withstanding its dominant economic preoccupations. With R. Perrin and M. Roubault (" On the Granite Problem," Journ. Oeol ., 57, 1949, 357-79, and earlier papers) we reach the " dry diffusion " extremists. After some criticism of the magmatic theory the authors present evidence that " granite originated by diffusion and reaction in the solid state." This evidence is practic- ally the same as that which is used by the " wet " transformists to support their position, and by magmatists to explain pegmatites, etc. Perrin and Roubault impartially attack both ; both are accused of giving way to " anthropomorphic or subjective impres- sions " (whatever they are). But we think the present authors are by no means free from these intellectual vices. The whole paper is highly controversial in tone. The theory of dry diffusion as the main agent in granitisation is referred to later when dealing with the contributions of Bowen and Jagitsch to the problem. The same authors have re-asserted their position on " Meta- morphism of the Trias in the Alps " (Oeol. Mag., LXXXVII, 1950, 89-101) which was so devastatingly criticised by M. Lugeon and later by O. T. Jones (see Science Progress, July 1949, p. 520). To quote from the latter reference : " The basal Trias rests with great unconformity on ancient schists, gneisses and granites. . . . A reddening effect is seen in the rocks underlying this and similar unconformities, whether metamorphic or not, and is attributable to contemporaneous weathering. In the Scheidnössli section the zz</page><page sequence="8">722 SCIENCE PROGRESS unconformity is marked by a peculiar arkose about 12 fb. thick, which grades downwards into a gneiss, but is sharply truncated above by the base of the Trias. This in interpreted as due to ' disintegration in situ.9 But Perrin and Roubault claim this arkose as a product of post-Trias metamorphism which, with the subjacent gneiss, is regarded as due to granitisation working up from below, the [transforming agents] being blanketed off by the Trias which is assumed to have acted as a barrier to the trans- forming processes." In the present paper Perrin and Roubault have brought forward new evidence and further arguments in support of their views, but we think that the great majority of geologists will remain unconvinced. They seem to take up the position that the whole geological army is all out of step except them. In P. Eskola, " The Nature of Metasomatism in the Processes of Granitisation " (Inter. Oeol. G (mgr. 18th Session , Great Britain 1948 , Report Part III , 1950, 5-13) we have the exponent of " wet " diffusion involving original granitic magma within the foundations of the great gneiss-granite massifs. He shows that in the various types of sedimentary and metamorphic rocks which are subject to granitisation, the chemical change into " granite " is best explained by the " mass action of granitic magma which soaked into the rock," with fixation of the substances needed by the invaded rock, and expulsion of those not needed to turn them into granites. Thus,- the granitisation of quartzite would mean the addition of all oxides in varying amounts except silica, and a large amount of silica would be expelled. Characteristic of this kind of metasomatic granitisation is the constant occurrence of intermediate stages and of relict structures, such features being " lacking in those granites that otherwise prove to have crystallised from liquid magmas such as the Rapakiwi, the synkinematic diffeťentiated intrusi ves (the ' urgranite ' of Sweden), or the graphophyric granites differentiated from dolerite." The bulk composition of these granites, " whose magmatic origin is beyond any doubt," may be identical with that of granites derived from sediments, which is regarded as strong evidence that liquid magma has been the ultimate source of material in all cases. Eskola shows that the metasomatic changes have not occurred at constant volume ; hence the swelling into domes and upward intrusion, which are invariable features of granitisation. N. H. Magnusson, in his paper on " The Origin of the Sörmland Gneisses " (Inter. Geol. Congr., 18th Session , Great Britain 1948 , Report Part III , 1950, 14-19) shows that these veined gneisses are</page><page sequence="9">GEOLOGY 723 more or less strongly altered leptites, slates and granites, with a long and complicated history. This alteration was caused by granitic emanations and solutions coming from deeper zones of the earth's crust where palingenetic processes were in operation. The original rocks have been altered in such a way that enrichment in the most stable constituents, and impoverishment of the more soluble constituents, have taken place, resulting in a decrease in silica, alkalis and calcium, and an increase in Al, Fe and Mg. Mag- nusson finds it necessary to assume that the emanations and solu- tions from the depths soaked their way through the strongly schistose complex with its iron ores and limestones. In the roof of the veined gneisses the solutions have given rise to cross-cutting pegmatites, granites and mica-schists of metamorphic derivation. His point of view therefore approximates to that of Eskola. In his study, " Ueber Verschiedenheiten im Verlaufe mag- matischer und metamorpher Prozesse, erläutert an Beispielen aus dem Aarmassiv," H. F. Huttenlocher (Mitt. Naturf . Oes. Bern , (NF), 4, 1947, 85-116) considers granite intrusions and graņitisations which, in the Aar Massif, are differently developed according to their geotectonic arrangement and structural level. In some districts true juvenile magmatic melts occur on high structural levels where they cooled quickly, and show few or no " adjustment processes " with the adjacent rocks. On the other hand, in other regions where " granite " is exposed at deep structural levels, reactions between the melts and the adjacent rocks lead to the " hybridisation of the whole granite mass." The intimate " acid " penetration of rocks immediately adjacent to the Aar Massif has not been caused by these melts, but by anateetic material mobilised by orogenic movements at géosynclinal depths. In the Erstfelder Gneiss and other masses anatectic granitisation has reached a very advanced stage. Here again, Huttenlocher's standpoint is that of Eskola's. In a paper on " Tectonics of the Mt. Aigoual Pluton in the South- eastern Cevennes, France, I and II " D. de Waard (Proc. Kon . Nederi. Akad. Wełensch ., LII, 1949, No. 4, 389-402 ; No. 5, 539-50) shows that in this granite pluton the mechanism of intrusion has been doming of the roof and not stoping. Domes of flow structures, slates dragged upwards near the contacts, drag-faults indicating raised blocks near the pluton, and long-distance faults showing arching of the roof, provide evidence of a magma forced upwards, and enlargement of the magma chamber by doming of the roof. Thus the structures of the Mt. Aigoual pluton (and of all the granite massifs of the Cevennes so far as observed), and the narrow</page><page sequence="10">724 SCIENCE PROGRESS zones of contact metamorphism, prove the existence of " magma or mush," and magmatic flow. " The granite has been a mobile substance during its mise en place, and there are no indications [of] metamorphic diffusion in the present magmatic deposit. No evidence has been found bearing on the origin of the mobile granite mass in depth before its intrusion. " R. C. Heim describes the petrology of the above granite {ibid., No. 6, 676-84). His most noteworthy observation is that textural and structural features indicate that a long process of crystallisation and re-crystallisation had been going on prior to, and during the, emplacement of the pluton. In two recent papers, " Magmas " (Bull. Geol. Soc. Amer ., 58, 1947, 263-79) and " The Granite Problem and the Method of Multiple Prejudices" (Geol. Soc. Amer. Mem. 28, 1948, 79-90), N. L. Bowen makes powerful and penetrating criticisms of the granitisation theories from the Magmatist viewpoint. He says, however : " There is probably no magmatist who does not believe that igneous and especially granitic material has occasionally been introduced into and replaced other rocks to such an extent that they acquire the composition of granite. He does reject the con- tention that most granitic rock has been formed by this process of granitisation. Similarly there is probably no upholder of the, metamorphic view who does not accept the possibility of a little granitic magma on occasion. . . . The real question is, then : How much granite is magmatic and how much metamorphic ? " Thus, again, we have the view that there are granites - and granites. Bowen is especially critical of the views of the " dry " granitisers on physico-chemical grounds. His conclusion is that solid diffusion may explain some synantectic phenomena (coronas, reaction- rims, etc.), but it is highly improbable as a major factor in geological processes such as granitisation. His main objection to large-scale " wet " granitisation is based on the huge supply of energy it requires for which no source is in sight. Furthermore, the space- problem is just as difficult and insistent for Transformists as for Magmatists. Bowen's criticism of " dry " diffusion as the main agent of granitisation is powerfully reinforced by the results of R. Jagitsch in a note on " Geological Diffusions in Solid Phases " (Nature, 164, Sept. 17, 1949, 497-8). He shows that, in a most favourable case of diffusion of Na20 in AISi compounds at temperatures close to the melting-point, the velocity of diffusion is so small that in 108 years the reaction layer could attain a thickness of only a few dozen feet. He thus comes to the conclusion that diffusion in solid</page><page sequence="11">PEDOLOGY 725 phases cannot play any important part in the transport of matter over long distances. In a paper on " Granite and Metasomatism " the veteran and versatile geologist and petrologist R. A. Daly (Amer. Jonim . Sci., 247, 1949, 753-78) enters the granitisation controversy decidedly on the Magmatist side. The paper " is intended to show that the [Transformists] have not thought to scale, have neglected many vital facts bearing on the problem, and have in no wise weakened the arguments of the Magmatists which have led towards what appears to be a sound theory of the evolution of the earth's crust." He takes the same view of the energy problem, of " dry " diffusion and of " homogenisation " as Bowen does. Daly, true to his life- long preoccupation with penological tectonics and the earth-shells, claims that Transformists have not sufficiently considered the relations of metasomatism of the granitisation type to the Archaean basements which represent the nearest accessible approach to the Sial layer. Why, too, he asks, is the Sial shell largely confined to one hemisphere, and why has the basaltic substratum of the Pacific hemisphere escaped granitisation ? He lists twelve kinds of " argu- mentative trouble " for Transformists, and thinks that Magmatists have provided better answers for at least some of the questions he formulates.</page></plain_text>
