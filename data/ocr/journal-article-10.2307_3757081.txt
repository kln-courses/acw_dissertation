<plain_text><page sequence="1">Spore Liberation, by C. T. Ingold. ix + 210 p., 121 figs. Claren- don Press, Oxford. 1965. Price, $5.60. Since most terrestrial fungi and lower green plants are sedentary organisms, and since spores constitute their only mobile stage, the libera? tion and dispersal of these spores is a subject of great importance. With his earlier book, Spore Discharge in Land Plants (1939) and Dispersal in Fungi (1953), C. T. Ingold established himself as the leading authority on this aspect of the biology of fungi and lower plants. His latest books, Spore Liberation, is not merely a new edition of either of the earlier works. It supplants them in some ways and supplements them in others, because both the contents and the organization have been changed. There is considerably more emphasis on non-violent spore liberation in this book than in the previous ones, and instead of focusing attention on the mechanisms of spore discharge by using them as a basis for organization, Ingold has organized Spore Liberation along both topical and phylogenetic lines. Six of the seven chapters are devoted to fungi, and although some are more descriptive than others, an analytical approach is evident throughout. The first chapter is a general one which analyses the effects of size and shape on the rate of settling and impaction of fungous spores. The second chapter describes the methods of spore liberation and distribution found in the order Mucorales, and the third deals with spore discharge in Sordaria, particularly the periodicity of ascospore discharge and the consequences of the tendency of these spores to stick together. In the fourth chapter, water relations of terrestrial fungi are discussed with emphasis on the effect on spore discharge of wetting fruiting bodies, the ability of these structures to survive drought, and dispersal of spores by rain drops. A general chapter on rhythms of spore liberation is followed by one devoted to hymenomyeetes, which contains an analysis of the proportions of the sporophore and the con- figuration of the hymenium-bearing surface as well as a discussion of the still controversial question of the mechanism of basidiospore dis? charge. The title of the sixth chapter, "Gasteromycetes, or Nature Tries Again," not only hints at the diverse and fascinating dispersal mecha? nisms found in this group, but betrays Ingold's sense of humor which</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 987 bubbles to the surface frequently throughout the book. The concluding chapter is a description of the remarkable dispersal mechanisms found in Bryophytes, including the liquid-filled elaters of Cephalozia and other Jungermanniales, the spring-like elaters of Frullania, the intricate peri- stome teeth of Funaria, Polytrichum, and Eurhynchium, and, finally, the modification shown by Splachnum, a moss whose spores are dis- tributed by insects. The book is stimulating, because Ingold not only discusses what is known but also points out what is not known about various dispersal mechanisms. Although he has not hesitated to relate structure and function and to suggest the adaptive significance of various features, he has been scrupulous to avoid anthropomorphism, and he has been careful to indicate that phyogenetic or evolutionary speculation is just that. Not only is this book a useful and authoritative reference for the professional biologist, it is an ideal book to which to refer students for collateral reading, because it will surely whet their interest. With this lucid and interesting book, Professor Ingold has demonstrated once again that it is not necessary to be dull to be scholarly.?Robert M. Page.</page></plain_text>
