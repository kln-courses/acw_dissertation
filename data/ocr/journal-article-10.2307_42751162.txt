<plain_text><page sequence="1">Neuroscience and the Problem of Other Animal Minds: Why It May Not Matter So Much for Neuroethics Abstract A recent argument in the neuroethics literature has suggested that brain-mental- state identities (one popular expression of what is commonly known as neuroreductionism) promise to settle epistemolog- ica! uncertainties about nonhuman animal minds. What's more, these brain-mental-state identities offer the further promise of dismantling the deadlock over the moral status of nonhuman animals, to positive affect in such areas as agriculture and laboratory animal science. I will argue that neuroscientific claims assuming brain-mental-state identities do not so much resolve the problem of other animal minds as mark its resolu- tion. In the meantime, we must rely on the tools available to us, including those provided by such behavioral sciences as cognitive ethology, com- parative psychology, and ethology as well as the neurosciences. Focusing on captive animal research, I will also argue that humane experimental- ists do not doubt that many of their research subjects have minds (in some substantive sense of that term). In that light, to suggest that the res- olution of the problem of other animal minds would change the scientific use of animals misses the point at issue. Instead, what is required is a 'sea change' in the perceived grounds for human moral obligations to nonhumans. It is difficult to see how brain-mental-state identities could be the deciding factor in this continuing issue in applied ethics. 1. Introduction The epistemological problem of other animal minds is a subspecies of the problem of other minds familiar to any undergraduate philosophy student (or science fiction aficionado). Given that I only seem to have direct access to my own mental states (e.g., my beliefs, desires, emotions, feelings), how do I know that others, including other nonhuman animals "Neuroscience and the Problem of Other Animal Minds: Why It May Not Matter So Much for Neuroethics" by Andrew Fenton, The Monist, vol. 95, no. 3, pp. 463-485.

The epistemic uncertainty implied by these questions remains even after granting minds to fellow humans. The practical impli- cations of this problem seem clear. Animal welfare efforts in conservation biology, agriculture, scientific research, and the pet industry (and this list is not exhaustive) are predicated on understanding the needs of the relevant animals qua subjects who can fare well or badly (Dawkins 2005; Grandin 2010; McMillan 2005; Orlans 2002; Sherwin 2006; Sherwin et al. 2003). To fare well or badly as subjects presumes subjectivity and this brings us to questions (much like those above) about their minds (e.g., Dawkins 2005; 2008). A recent argument in the neuroethics literature (Farah 2008) receiving increasing notice (Allen 2010; Buchman and Reiner 2009; Fins et al. 2008; Wu 2008) (hereafter the Cognitive Neuroscience or CN Argument) has suggested that an assumed metaphysical materialism, common in the contemporary cognitive neurosciences and elsewhere, implies that neuro- scientific evidence provides (note the present tense) a different kind of evidence that is in principle more informative than what traditionally grounds ascriptions of mental states to others. This evidence, which assumes certain brain-mental-state identities, can settle epistemological uncertainties about animal minds once and for all. Such a monumental event, it is argued, would dismantle the deadlock over the moral status of animals and so morally advance their treatment in such areas as captive research (e.g., the laboratory) and agriculture (Farah 2008). In what follows I will contend that neither of these claims is particu- larly persuasive, though not because of a skepticism of animal minds. The apparent strength of the CN Argument arises from both the assumption that certain brain states are identical to certain mental states and that evidence of such brain states provides direct evidence of minds, in contrast to the kind of indirect (largely behavioral) evidence traditionally used to justify ascriptions of mental states. I will argue that the attraction of this claim for proponents of the CN Argument is grounded in a confusion of epistemic and metaphysical considerations relating behavior, brain states, and mental states. The CN Argument's analysis of the practical consequences of knowing brain-mental-state identities (or likely brain-mental-state identi- ties) is grounded in a naive view of how our perceptions of animals as</page><page sequence="3">NEUROSCIENCE AND ANIMAL MINDS 465 subjects impact human-animal relations. Using captive animal research as my focus, I will argue that knowledge of animal suffering or probable suffering2 through the relevant brain-mental-state identities is unlikely to change much of what is researched, or how the research subjects are treated, in animal laboratories. I am not quibbling with the claim that animal re- searchers care if their subjects are suffering or probably suffering, nor do I deny that researchers would change their practices if they discovered that their subjects are ««necessarily suffering or probably suffering. Rather, to think that knowledge of the relevant brain-mental-state identities will make a moral difference is to make a mistake regarding the epistemic position adopted by many researchers of captive animals (McMillan 2005; Orlans 2002; Sherwin et al. 2003; Sherwin 2006). Fundamental changes in our moral relations with other animals motivating the CN Argument requires a 'sea change' in the perceived grounds for human moral obligations to animals, or so I will suggest. Regardless of what grounds are favored, cognitive neuroscience will have no more relevance to the sub- sequent discussion than such animal sciences as cognitive ethology or comparative psychology. 2. The CN Argument and Neuroethics The reason for focusing on the CN Argument is, in part, its connec- tion to recent discussions in the neuroethics literature. More precisely, some claims in the argument resonate with certain problematic directions or commitments in this emergent discipline. For example, it is increasingly common in the literature to (i) present advances in the relevant neuro- sciences as philosophical and societal 'game changers' (see Belcher and Sinnott- Armstrong (2010) on legal evidence; Devonshire and Dommett (2010) on child education; Moreno (2003) on legal culpability; Narvaez and Vaydich (2008) on moral agency; Schauer (2010) on detecting deception)3 and (ii) implicitly or explicitly question the explanatory strength of other ways of knowing, including those empirical sciences dealing with mind or behavior, without advances in the relevant neurosciences. For examples see Iacoboni et al. (2007); Soon et al. (2008); Wölpe et al. (2005).4 Both of these directions or commitments are at work in the CN Argument. According to the CN Argument there is an alleged vulnerability in the ascriptions of minds to animals, presumably in and outside of the relevant natural sciences, because of a significant dependence on behavioral evidence</page><page sequence="4">466 ANDREW FENTON through what we might call 'crude analogical arguments' (Farah 2008). The analogical arguments in question have one of two forms. Form 1: "[W]hen I stub my toe, this causes me to feel pain, which in turn causes me to say 'ouch!' When I see Joe stub his toe and say 'ouch,' I infer by analogy that he feels pain" (Farah 2008, 10). Form 2: When I stub my toe, I feel pain and exclaim 'ouch!' When I observe a bat stub her/his toe and squeak I can infer that s/he feels pain (Farah 2008). Form 1 is the analog- ical argument taken to commonly underlie ascriptions of cognitive or mental states to humans, Form 2 concerns animals. Farah, whose version of the CN Argument is the focus of this paper, writes, For neurologists examining patients, as for philosophers pondering the problem of other minds, behavior is the most obvious and natural type of evidence to consult for the purpose of inferring the mental life of another being. Yet behavior is clearly inadequate in principle , because it is only con- tingently related to cognition (Farah 2008, 12 [emphasis mine]). For the purposes of knowing mental states, behavior is like an indicator light. . . . Their relation to the thing indicated is contingent on being hooked up a certain way. Inferences based on indicator lights and, analogously, behavior are therefore fallible. In contrast, virtually all contemporary approaches to the mind-body problem regard the relation between mental states and brain states as noncontingent. . . . [T]he argument from analogy with brain activity is immune to the alternative interpretations that plague the behavioral analogy. (Farah 2008, 14) It is important for understanding this position that brain activity offers both more direct and, thus, conclusive evidence of mentality than is otherwise available to the behavioral or mind sciences. As Farah writes, physiological data are not simply one more source of evidence about a being's mental life, to be weighed together with behavioral evidence, valuable as they might be in that role. Rather, physiological data can play a qualitatively different and more definitive role because of their noncontin- gent relation to mental states. (Farah 2008, 15) Though I will dispute Farah's claims later in the paper, it is important to note that the quotes from Farah's recent articulation of the CN Argument capture elements of the two problematic directions or commitments briefly canvassed above. The analogical arguments described above are presented as the traditionally favored inferential strategies used by those who would</page><page sequence="5">NEUROSCIENCE AND ANIMAL MINDS 467 study animals, human or nonhuman, through behavior. This effectively downplays the evidential base and strength of explanations arising out of the behavioral sciences. Knowledge of brain activity, in conjunction with knowledge of brain-mental-state-identities (or likely brain-mental-state- identities), is proffered as the better evidential basis for cognition in animals. This effectively overplays the epistemic landscape supplemented by the contemporary neurosciences (i.e., it is an instance of 'neurohype'), or so I will argue. 3. Materialism, Neuroscience, and Animal Minds The CN Argument makes two central claims: 1. Given that certain brain states are identical with certain mental states, neuroscientific knowledge provides direct evidence, invul- nerable to contingencies plaguing ways of knowing dependent on behavior, that can conclusively settle epistemic uncertainties about animal minds. 2. Knowledge of brain-mental-state identities in other animals will dismantle the deadlock over their moral status, changing how they are treated in such areas as agriculture and research (Farah 2008). In the sections to follow, I will critically examine each of these claims in turn. The first claim's assumption, that mental states are brain states, is in- creasingly regarded as common knowledge (Churchland 2002; Farah 2008; Kluger 2007), but its use requires care. Clarification on its use raises some of the first problems for the CN Argument. The CN Argument is compatible with both some cephalized animals lacking minds and the existence of brain states, unrelated to mental states, in cephalized animals with minds. Arguably, insects, spiders, crustaceans (e.g., crabs, shrimps) and amphibians are examples of the former, while brain states associated with the human autonomic system are examples of the latter. What the CN Argument requires with regards to the former, however, is a means of demarcating cephalized animals lacking minds from those possessing them, and this must be based on something other than brain function. An obvious route, one that Farah recognizes as natural (see the relevant previous quote), is to appeal to behavior. However, this</page><page sequence="6">468 ANDREW FENTON need not be one that assumes a simplistic analogy between human and animal behavior as outlined in the CN Argument.5 Fisher puts it usefully this way: Take the simplest example: next door a deer is munching on my neighbor's grass. I immediately think: that deer must be hungry. I haven't arrived at that thought by thinking: if / were to eat my neighbor's grass I would be hungry. If I went next door and started to munch on the lawn, I would perhaps have had a nervous breakdown or be under the influence of a drug. My reasoning was, rather, based on how I represent the deer, as creatures who make grass a regular part of their diet. (Fisher 1996, 14) My point here does not deny that some individuals use analogical arguments as described in the CN Argument, but approaches like Fisher's in circum- stances like those imagined do something more than what the CN Argument describes. Fisher suggests that, qua animals, deer fit within a complex framework of interpretation and understanding where they, like humans, eat, sleep, defecate, copulate, avoid predators, seek out conspecifics (i.e., members of the same species), and so on. Understanding how this partic- ular kind of animal tends to behave when in need of food supports Fisher's thought experiment mentioned above. To suppose that the animal is motivated by a need for food and that the grass fits this bill are the addi- tional suppositions assumed by Fisher in thinking that the deer is hungry. Though Fisher's approach raises legitimate questions about the nature of deer minds, this opens a door to the demarcation required by the CN Argument without falling foul of the weak Form 2 analogical argument. Further help can be gleaned from standard treatments of the evolution of central nervous systems, and different cognitive capacities, which appeal to the benefit conferred on those animals possessing the relevant nervous systems or capacities. Certain cognitive capacities have allowed the relevant animals to acquire behavioral repertoires useful in responding to certain stimuli while not being limited to responses that require a level of environmental stability or predictability missing in the current envi- ronment (Gómez 2004; Manning and Dawkins 1998). Learning is a common example of behavioral plasticity that fits this description and rec- ognizes that many animals respond to their environments in ways that go beyond mere reflex (Gould 2004). When explaining the behavior of animals in the field, factors such as behavioral flexibility, behavior best</page><page sequence="7">NEUROSCIENCE AND ANIMAL MINDS 469 understood as directed toward certain goals, and behavior best understood as expressing preferences can be important ways of demarcating the cognitive capacities of some animals from others (see de Waal and Tyack 2003). For example, certain intervening content-bearing states between sensory input and behavioral output that implicate information processing probably best explain anticipatory behavior that requires learning and occurs before the relevant stimuli is in the animal's sensory field (e.g., chimpanzee preparations of foraging tools before traveling to food sites). Such states are not unreasonably regarded as cognitive (Gould 2004; Tomasello and Call 1997). This way of demarcating brains, if taken up by proponents of the CN Argument, undermines the strength of its first claim. That this is such 'low hanging fruit' in assessing this first central claim raises the possibility that the argument is simply being misinter- preted. I will explain why this is not a misreading of the argument in the section to follow. 4. On Why Less Can Be More The CN Argument's first central claim is difficult to interpret. It is important to the argument that the current status of neuroscientific evidence is impacted by the assumption that brain states are mental states. Farah writes, within the context of a certain class of metaphysical assumptions concerning mind-brain relations, neuroscience evidence is different from the kinds of evidence traditionally used to infer mental life, and that is in principle more informative. (Farah 2008, 10, emphasis mine) The use of the present tense in the first claim is noteworthy for this point. This will be important later in our discussion when we briefly reconsider the significance of behavior in the context of evolutionary biology. As we have yet to discover brain-mental-state identities, it cannot be that the relevant metaphysical materialist assumption settles our current epistemic uncertainty about animal minds (or at least the uncertainty targeted in the CN Argument) nor obviates the need for behavioral evidence, suitably situated (more on this shortly). Nevertheless, the CN Argument would seem to be suggesting that, in light of a plausible metaphysical material- ism, the presence of certain brain states, unlike the presence of certain</page><page sequence="8">470 ANDREW FENTON behavior, is more direct, and less vulnerable, evidence of certain mental states in others. Farah writes, [H] owe ver sure you are of the ACC [anterior cingulated cortex] activation in Joe's brain, you can be that sure that Joe is in pain. . . . [T]he argument from analogy with brain activity is immune to alternative interpretations that plague the behavioral analogy. (Farah 2008, 14, emphasis mine) The analogical argument with animals is sensitive to dissimilarities between the brains of source and target individuals. As Farah writes, "sim- ilarity of psychological state will fall off as similarity of brain state falls off' (Farah 2008, 16). If we concede for the sake of argument that the human ACC is not only a part of the human pain system but, when active, reflects suffering, then the CN Argument would have us attend to those other animals similarly equipped with ACCs. When talking of what it might be like to be a bat, Farah muses, given that we do share the same general pain physiology with bats, including an ACC, we can know certain things about what it's like to be one of them. Specifically, we can infer that to be a bat with an injured toe is more like being a human with an injured toe and no pain relief than it is like being a human with an injured toe who has been given morphine. (Farah 2008, 16) At first glance, several things seem unpersuasive about the CN Argument. Metaphysically speaking, it is of course true that if certain brains states are identified with certain mental states in a given animal species, then the presence of those brain states becomes incontestable evidence of the presence of the relevant mental states (relative to our ability to know these brain-mental-state identities). Also, if behaviors are contingently related to mental states, then, unlike brain states, their presence is a weak indicator of the presence of mental states. But the issue, of course, is not only ' What brain states are identified with what mental states in x (where X is a particular animal or animal species)?' but ' Are certain brain states identified with mental states in xT To answer this second question - under the auspices of the problem of other animal minds - is to solve the problem, not find a way to solve it. That is, when we know the answer to this question, the only problem left will be a practical one, limited only by our abilities to identify the presence of the relevant brain states in the animal(s) in question. This discovery would be momentous, but it is important that the reason why - in light of such a discovery - brain states</page><page sequence="9">NEUROSCIENCE AND ANIMAL MINDS 47 1 play a different evidential role than behavior in justifying the ascription of mental states to animals is that the epistemic landscape has significantly changed from where it is now. In such an epistemic context, we know with certainty that at least some animals have minds. Perhaps more to the point, it is difficult to envision solving this problem - that is, the problem of other animal minds through the discovery of brain-mental-state identities - without a to-be-specified de- pendence on understanding the significance of the behavior of the relevant animal(s).6 To illustrate this point, consider nest building by a species of mud wasp and how this informs debates about their cognition (Gould and Gould 1994/99; Smith 1978). A species of Australian mud wasp ( Paralas tor sp .) creates temporary protective mud funnels over the entrance to their nest (only to be destroyed when the offspring are inside and the food cells are provi- sioned) (Smith 1978). These funnels are built perpendicular to the surrounding surface (even when the surface is on a slight incline), 'designed' such that predators like Chrysidid wasps cannot enter the tunnel and gain access to the cells containing offspring, and are reliably built to a particular height and shape (Smith 1978). Important for our purposes, the mud wasp building the tunnel can also exhibit a tantalizing degree of sensitivity and responsiveness to changing conditions created by an experimenter, suggesting prima facie intelligence. In the mid 1970s, Smith performed a series of revealing experiments on the funnels of a small group of mud wasps and noted the following. If the funnels are ex- perimentally reduced in structure to earlier stages of construction (Smith (1978) suggests 5 construction stages for these funnels - (1) creating the stem, (2) curve, (3) flange, (4) flange width, and (5) bell walls), the wasps will rebuild them. In effect, the wasp can reorder her behavior to begin earlier stages of construction. If the nearly completed funnels of other wasps are attached to incomplete stems, and do not block access to the nest, the wasps will complete the funnels (effectively jumping from stage 1 to stage 5 construction). Stems which are buried while a wasp is still in stage 1 construction are lengthened by the wasp until they reach a certain height from the new surface. However, should an experimenter add more surface material after a wasp enters stage 2 construction, so that the stem is no longer the length it was before curve construction begins, the wasp does not return to stage 1 construction. Whatever stimulus elicits her con-</page><page sequence="10">472 ANDREW FENTON structive behavior in stage 1 does not do so in stage 2. Smith suggests that this, considered together with the previously observed return to earlier stages of construction when the funnel is experimentally destroyed, indicates stages of inspection behavior associated with one of the five stages of construction. Stimuli encountered during inspections of the structure relative to a particular stage of construction act as cues to elicit a certain range of construction behavior. Different stages of construction provide different stimuli to act as cues to elicit construction behavior 'fitted' for that construction stage (Smith 1978). Holes or breeches in the funnel that the wasp is currently working on may be repaired to original form, though there are exceptions. Holes in the necks of the funnels after wasps have entered stage 5 construction elicit, though only after a pause of sometimes considerable length, the creation of a whole new tunnel structure over the breech - yielding a double funnel above the nest. The pause may be because the animal is trying, and failing, to repair the hole from the inside - unseen by the experimenter. (The inside of the funnel is smoothed out as the wasp constructs it, making it necessary to have footholds to navigate the inside structure) (Smith 1978). What is philosophically interesting about this set of experiments is that they can eliminate some interpretations of this wasp's construction behavior that would entail ascribing certain mental states or capacities. Some of a wasp's sensitivities to the physical integrity of the funnel under construction appear to evince her awareness of its weaknesses or vulner- abilities. However, burying the stem after the beginning of stage 2 construction undermines such an interpretation, as the wasp will continue to complete the structure even though the bell of the funnel will now touch the surface and so no longer serve to protect the nest from predators (Smith 1978). This limitation of a mud wasp's behavioral capacities also indicates that she does not work from an 'image' of what the funnel should look like. Nevertheless, there is a degree of sensitivity to certain changes (e.g., holes) that elicits construction responses (e.g., repair), and in so doing evinces some information processing and behavioral flexibility. What's more, it does not appear that they must follow a linear course in constructing their funnel. When all of the evidence is considered together, the funnel building behavior seems best explained by the 'implementa- tion' of rather simple construction 'rules' in response to certain stimuli. In cases such as these, and this case is not unique (see Gould and Gould</page><page sequence="11">NEUROSCIENCE AND ANIMAL MINDS 473 [1994/99]), behavior suggests complex mentation, further experimenta- tion pursues an understanding of the range of behavior possible for the relevant animal in relevantly similar contexts, and an explanation is developed to explain failures that are unexpected if the animal is actively cogniti vely engaging with her environment in certain ways. Arguably, in an instance such as this, before one pursues the search for brain-mental- state identities there is a need to discern behavior evincing an animal's sensitivity and flexible responsiveness to changing circumstances that requires explanations positing causally efficacious intentional states (i.e., content-bearing states whose content is about something in the world, including the animal herself). In sum, coming to understand the significance of an animal's behavior in a fashion useful for resolving the problem of other animal minds requires some knowledge of her natural history, including the proximate function (basically, causal role) of the relevant behavior and proximate causes relative to the animal's level of functionality (as opposed to dysfunction- ality) and stage of development (Gould 2004; Manning and Dawkins 1998). Perhaps, in light of these worries, we could modify the CN Argument's first claim to: the greatest hope of success in solving the problem of other animal minds lies in discovering brain-mental-state identities. Relying on behavior will not get us very far at all, it might suggest, largely because of the contingency of the relation between behavior and mental states and so the attending epistemic uncertainty as to what, if any, mental states are appropriately regarded as the proximate causes of the relevant behavior. The CN Argument, even under this reading, remains problematic. First, as I have indicated above, it is difficult to see how we can advance our knowledge of brain-mental-state identities without relying heavily on the perceived significance of the relevant animal's behavior. Second, even localized discoveries of brain-mental-state identities (e.g., discoveries of brain-mental-state identities in dogs, chimpanzees, or dolphins) will not result in the presence of brain-states playing a signifi- cantly different evidentiary role to behavior in evincing the presence of causally efficacious mental states when focused on animals other than those in whom these identities are discovered. Imagine that we discover brain-mental-state identities in chimpanzees - perhaps we discover brain- mental-state identities for those affective states that underwrite what it seems reasonable to regard as chimpanzee friendships (i.e., enduring social</page><page sequence="12">474 ANDREW FENTON bonds between individuals) (Mitani 2009). Let us regard these affective states as instances of chimpanzee fondness. What will this tell us about the presence of fondness in domesticate dogs or Norway rats? Imagine that (i) they have a relevantly similar neural architecture to chimpanzees, and (ii) we have evidence of neural activity in those brain regions identified with fondness in chimpanzees. If the basis of our conclusion is the neural evidence considered in isolation versus accompanied by a description claiming that, over the relevant period of time, the relevant dogs or rats were seeking out the company of particular conspecifics, the latter evi- dential context is epistemically stronger for ascribing fondness to the relevant animals. Note, we cannot yet claim a discovery of brain-mental- state identities for dog or rat fondness. In this scenario, the identity relation discovered in chimpanzees necessitates an ascription of the relevant mental states given the presence of the relevant brain states in chimpanzees. This necessity relation is absent with respect to dogs or rats. An indication that this is so is the possibility - without pain of contradic- tion - of denying that dogs or rats experience fondness. What's more, even if we remain inclined to ascribe such mental states to dogs or rats, we can doubt - again without pain of contradiction - whether they have the same mental states as chimpanzees. How would we move forward in resolving these doubts? More neuroimages or single neuron recordings would not advance matters. We are in need of recourse to the kinds of con- siderations currently at work in comparative psychology, cognitive ethology, and ethology mentioned earlier, including the natural history of these mammals (e.g., the proximate causes of the behavior), the learning histories of the relevant animals, as well as considerations of parsimony in ascribing (any) mental states to explain dog or rat behavior. Though a controversial construct, 'parsimony' need mean no more than that we restrict mental state ascriptions to that which implies supporting cognitive capacities or a variety of behavioral implications that best explains the behavior in question (Allen and BekofF 1997; Jamieson and Bekoff 1992). Of course, where we are comparing chimpanzees or orangutans and gorillas the epistemic context is slightly different again. Assuming an evo- lutionary understanding of the history of our geno- and phenotypic traits, features, or characteristics, we can reasonably expect that, in closely related animals, there will be homologues that underwrite ascriptions of</page><page sequence="13">NEUROSCIENCE AND ANIMAL MINDS 475 certain shared traits, features, or characteristics (Keeley 2004). This is due to the conservative nature of evolutionary change (de Waal 1997). Ho- mologous traits, features, or characteristics of another animal's central nervous system are more likely to subvene relevantly similar mental states. Perhaps at least here we have what we need through cognitive neu- roscience to ascribe mental states from the presence of certain brain states independent of behavior. In saying this, there will remain room for doubt (i.e., this is not a claim of discovery of brain-mental-state identity). The fundamental difficulty faced by the advocate of the CN Argument is the continued absence of necessity. To infer that orangutans or gorillas possess the relevant mental states based on the relevant homol- ogous traits, features, or characteristics of their central nervous systems carries greater weight, all things considered, if these animals exhibit behaviors with relevantly similar functions to what is observed in chim- panzees (in the relevant contexts in response to the relevant stimuli). It is noteworthy that, once again, behavior properly contextualized sneaks back into the picture. This slight amendment points to a substantial weakness in the CN Argument, particularly given its implicit devaluing of other animal behavioral sciences. Third, the contingency relation between behavior and causally effi- cacious mental versus brain states outlined by the CN Argument presents further problems for it. If an animal species' brain and mental states are identical, then the relevant brain states must also be contingently related to behavior. This, in itself, is not a reason to reject the CN Argument, though it makes discovering brain-mental-state identities tricky indeed (see above). It does, however, present a different problem. There can be little doubt that those offering the CN Argument grant that the brains of the relevant animals have an evolutionary history. We need not be adapta- tionists (i.e., believe that every phenotype is an adaptation) to consider the possibility that certain brain-based features of a species have resulted from selection pressures. If certain brain-based features have resulted from selection pressures, some brain capacities in the relevant animal species will reflect the benefit these conferred on their ancestors in to-be- specified social and/or physical environments. Understood as such, and independent of the current state of our knowledge of the relevant evolu- tionary history, we can reasonably expect there to be an important, probabilistic</page><page sequence="14">476 ANDREW FENTON relationship between some of the relevant brain states, processes or events either internal or external to the relevant animals, and their behavior. As Allen and Bekoff write, Natural selection generally acts on the functional properties ... of organis- mi traits; the material properties of an organism or its traits are important only insofar as they affect the functional capacities of those traits. Nervous systems of animals are no exceptions - the functions for which they are selected include the control of behavior. ... If selection acts on traits in virtue of their functional characteristics, then it acts on nervous systems in virtue of the behavioral functions they support (Allen and Bekoff 1997, 13) Since the CN Argument presupposes that "mental states are brain states" (Farah 2008, 14, author's emphasis) and embraces an evolutionary framework for understanding the evolution of central nervous systems, it must also presuppose that there is an important, probabilistic relationship between some cognitive or mental states and behavior. It matters little here that this relationship is yet to be discovered. Within such a framework for understanding an animal's traits, capacities, and character- istics, we have theoretical reasons to be optimistic - rather than pessimistic - about the use of behavior, and behavioral capacities, as a means through which to solve the problem of other animal minds. To conclude this section's discussion, there appears to be a stronger relationship than is acknowledged between behavior and brain states, once we grant that brains have an evolutionary history. Given the presup- positions of the CN Argument, this is also true for at least some cognitive or mental states. Also, though the evidentiary role for brain states in the epistemic context where we know brain-mental-state identities is impor- tantly different than where these remain to be discovered, the dependence on - among other things - behavior to make these discoveries undermines the wedge the CN Argument wants to drive between mind and behavior. None of what I have thus far argued should be read as skepticism of animal minds. I am willing to grant minds to many animals on the basis of arguments to the best explanation relative to what we know of their behavior, natural history, learning history, and so on. But cognitive neu- roscience's role in this debate is one of adding even more considerations to those on the table when ascribing cognitive or mental states to animals (Allen et al. 2005; Shriver 2006), rather than introducing evidentiary con- siderations of a different kind to what has been hitherto 'in play'. Though</page><page sequence="15">NEUROSCIENCE AND ANIMAL MINDS 477 this offers cognitive neuroscience a lesser role than proponents of the CN Argument would have us believe, it is, in an important way, more than what we would have without these brain sciences. 5. So They Have Minds. Now What? We now come to the second central claim of the CN Argument. The second claim follows a familiar line of reasoning that begins with the not unreasonable premise that, fundamentally, moral obligations arise from the interests of subjects. More specifically, an individual qua subject possesses the capacity to fare well or badly. This capacity provides a means through which to identify that individual's basic interests - those interests whose violation precludes her faring well. Further, or so it is commonly argued, it is prima facie wrong to act in such a way as to un- necessarily violate an individual's basic interests. Consequently, if we can determine that other animals are subjects, in the sense understood above, we can determine their interests and work out our attendant moral duties towards them. This, the CN Argument argues, should impact how they are subsequently treated. After all, certain (mis)treatments of animals - e.g., in agriculture or scientific research - only occur, or probably only occur, because of uncertainty about the mindedness, and consequent moral status, of the relevant individuals. Once this uncertainty is removed, these (mis)treatments will, or probably will, stop (Farah 2008). Farah writes, What is the relevance of the problem of other minds to neuroethics? Its relevance to ethics rests on the relation between moral standing and capacity for mental life, particularly the capacity to suffer. If a being is capable of suffering, then it deserves protection from suffering. (Farah 2008, 10) Or again, the mental life of animals is often treated by us as hypothetical, incomparably different from our own, or even nonexistent. How else to explain our accep- tance of glue traps for rodents and boiled lobster dinners? (Farah 2008, 15) My quibble with these claims concerns the expectation that knowledge of brain-mental-state identities will change how minded animals are currently treated in agriculture and scientific research. I am unconvinced that many of those currently working in agriculture or labo- ratory animal science deny the minds of those animals toward, or against, whom they act (Bekoff et al. 2002; Grandin 2010) (though see Kennedy</page><page sequence="16">478 ANDREW FENTON [1992]). Let me be clear here. I am not denying that many of those working in agriculture or laboratory animal science hesitate to ascribe, among other things, happiness, thought, self-awareness, or long-term planning to those animals with whom they interact. 'Mind,' however, encompasses a significant variety of cognitive or mental states, and these workers would have to hesitate to ascribe quite a lot to be 'guilty' of denying that animals are minded at all. My concern in this part of my analysis, then, is that the CN Argument misrepresents the epistemic position of many, though not all, of those currently working with animals in agriculture or laboratory animal science. To make this point manageable in a paper of this size, let us narrow our focus to laboratory animal science. Consider the current state of humane science - here understood to be laboratory animal science increasingly attuned to the welfare of its research subjects7 - within the relevant sub-communities of experimental animal scientists. It is now something of a mantra to claim that good science is ethical science (Barley 2005; Demers et al. 2006; Poole 1997), though the claim is not new (Haynes 2008). 'Ethical science' - at least among those tending to use this mantra in the context of animal laborato- ry science - is science in accord with Russell and Burch's 3 R's of refinement, reduction, and replacement (Demers et al. 2006). Minimally, refinement consists of minimizing the painfullness or harmfulness of ex- periments. For some 3-R advocates, it also consists in optimizing the well-being of the relevant subjects (see McMillan [2005]). Reduction concerns the number of animals used in an experimental protocol. Less is (ethically) better. Replacement concerns the move either away from animals entirely or those thought to have a greater capacity to feel pain or suffer (van Sluyters et al. 2003). Note that 2 of the 3 R's (i.e., refinement and replacement) directly address the mental lives of research subjects, while a motivation for the third is to reduce the pain or suffering of experimental animals. For those, then, who aspire to be humane experimental scientists, there is recognition that some of their animal subjects at least some of the time are minded. Though this understanding of animal subjects - and subjectivity - informs the choices that scientists make regarding animal models (e.g., when to replace animal subjects with cell cultures (Jarvis et al. 2005), or choosing earlier humane endpoints (Demers et al. 2006)), one fundamental issue remains throughout. Under the 3-R approach no animals rank so</page><page sequence="17">NEUROSCIENCE AND ANIMAL MINDS 479 high in moral status as to be precluded from the kinds of research that should not be done on any humans (Orlans 2002). It is important to note, given the argument in question, that this includes those animals who can - in the context of free-living social groups - engage in coalitions and alliances that benefit both parties (Duffy et al. 2007; Tomasello and Call 1997), modify their tolerance of others relative to past support or aggres- sion (de Waal 1998; Duffy et al. 2007), laugh and tease in the course of play (Jensvold 2008; van Hoof and Preuschoft 2003), and probably even form friendships (Mitani 2009): namely, chimpanzees. Those whose research makes use of these animals may quibble with some of the de- scriptions of what lies within the behavioral repertoire of chimpanzees (see, for example, Povinelli and Vonk [2006]), but not with most of the de- scriptions above (see Lonsdorf et al. [2010]). As I indicate, the studies grounding these claims can be found throughout the scientific literature dealing with chimpanzee behavior and cognition. The existence of chim- panzee minds, then, among many animal researchers is not in serious doubt. Though several developed nations now restrict the use of chim- panzees in harmful experimentation (Knight 2008), they are still used in countries like the United States of America for research on such infectious diseases as Hepatitis and HIV (e.g., Chen et al. 2007; Huang et al. 2007; Prince et al. 2005), monoclonal antibodies (VandeBerg and Zola 2005), as well as evaluating body-drug interactions (Bloomsmith et al. 2006; VandeBerg and Zola 2005). In such captive environments, it is not uncommon for these captive animals to exhibit behavioral atypicalities, including self-mutilation behavior, and exhibit symptoms resembling post-traumatic stress (Bradshaw et al. 2008; Walsh et al. 1982). This is of increasing concern to those working in animal welfare science and has been of longer concern to chimpanzee advocates (Balls 1995; Bloomsmith et al. 2006; Goodall 1995). Again, the issue in contexts such as these is not their mind- edness, but rather their moral status (Goodall 1995; Knight 2008). It is difficult to see what knowledge of brain-mental-state identifies could add to the 'snap shot' of chimpanzee cognition and behavior briefly offered above that would turn the tables on their continued inclusion in harmful research. Admittedly, it is difficult to see what chimpanzees would have to evince - short of being humans in disguise - that would be widely regarded as support for according them a moral status equal to that of a human newborn (Balls 1995; Fenton and Krahn 2010). This is certainly</page><page sequence="18">480 ANDREW FENTON a serious issue for those who hold chimpanzees in such low moral esteem. There is much that has been said about the inability of species identity to bear the weight of the relevant distinction that would warrant this differ- ential moral regard (e.g., DeGrazia 1996; Frey 2005; Singer 1993). Infelicities can be seen in human embryonic stem cell research, where human embryos can be sacrificed to develop stem cell lines. Long-standing arguments - involving fantasy and science fiction characters - point to the logical distinction between being human and enjoying high moral status (DeGrazia 2002). Though this appears to require an analysis of shared features, traits or characteristics able to bear the weight of high moral status, I confess ignorance of analyses that can avoid the traps of over- or under-inclusion. This is an important dispute in applied ethics and one long overdue for resolution. However, the solution is unlikely to reside in knowledge of brain-mental-state identities. What is fundamentally at issue lies in the realm of ethics, not science, the philosophy of mind, or epistemology, and concerns the appropriate grounds for high moral status. 6. Conclusions I have disputed the claim that, in the epistemological space where we are faced with the problem of other animal minds, cognitive neuroscience offers a way forward that is substantially different from appeals to behavior, either in analogical arguments or arguments to the best expla- nation. Discoveries of brain-mental-state identities will indeed play a substantially different evidentiary role in ascribing mental states than what they - or correlated behavior - currently enjoy. This is not, however, because knowledge of brain-mental-state identities solves the problem of other animal minds so much as marks its resolution. Until such discover- ies are made, we must rely on the tools at hand, including the methods and findings of cognitive ethology, comparative psychology and ethology. What's more, doubt about the mindedness of other animals has less sig- nificance than is implied by the CN Argument in the context of humane experimental science. Russell and Burch's 3-R approach - an approach shaping the rhetoric of those defending the value of laboratory animal science in Europe and North America - embraces the mindedness (in some meaningful sense of that term) of animals used in harmful research. The issue in such moral contexts is not the minds of these animal research</page><page sequence="19">NEUROSCIENCE AND ANIMAL MINDS 48 1 subjects so much as their moral status. It is difficult to see how brain- mental-state identities could be the deciding factor in this continuing issue in moral philosophy.8 California State University ; Fresno Andrew Fenton Notes 1. It is important to note that 'mind' and 'consciousness', or 'mental states' and 'conscious states', are not synonymous. Though we can be equally troubled by the problem of other animal minds and the problem of other animal consciousness, we can make headway resolving the former without a lot of headway resolving the latter (Allen 2010; Andrews 2010; Shettleworth 2001). 2. For those uncomfortable with the claim that animals suffer, substitute 'distress' for 'suffering' and understand distress as "an aversive, negative state in which coping and adaptation processes fail to return an organism to physiological and/or psychological homeostasis" (Ward et al. 2008, 15). Distress arises in contexts where a stressed animal cannot escape from, or control the frequency, duration and intensity of, the relevant stressors (Ward et al. 2008). 3. For criticisms of these positions see Carlat (2008); Caulfield et al. (2010); Downie and Murphy (2007); Fenton et al. (2009); Hall and Lücke (2010). 4. For criticisms of some of these positions see Herlihy and Gandy (2002); Lavazza and De Caro (2010); Racine et al. (2005). 5. Though my discussion in this paper will grant for the sake of argument that an in- ferential approach to human and animal minds underwrites justified ascriptions of cognitive or mental states this is a contested stance. See Dupré (1996); Jamieson (2009). 6. In discussing the neuroscientific grounds for ascribing pain to rats, Farah acknowl- edges the importance of the role of careful behavioral analyses to draw out analogues between humans and rats experiencing pain and activity in relevantly similar areas of the brain (Farah 2008). This inconsistency in presentation could be understood to modify her earlier claim about the importance of neuroscientific evidence. There is a cost. So under- stood, the paper says nothing new about the importance of neuroscience to the problem of other animal minds. 7. 'Humane science' is a locution associated with the legacy of the early to mid- twentieth century animal welfare movement among certain British scientists (Haynes 2008) and not to be confused with a view that the moral framework adopted in much animal laboratory science is ethically adequate. 8.
