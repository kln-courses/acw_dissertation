Save the great sanctuaries,2 no attempt has been made fco localize the centres of the worship of the Celtic gods. In Ireland, the usual method has been to bring together a crude heap of legends of all periods and districts, and try to bring order out of the chaos as it exists. Naturally no consistent results emerged from so unscientific a process; there was always a large waste product, as in an abortive chemical experiment, and 1 I use the following abbreviations among more obvious ones:?R.

The fault is that such workers failed to see that we have stories told of the gods in various tribes (contra dictory even where ancient), and a huge mass of corrupted theories and chronologies, later than a.d. 1050, formed without realizing its contradictory nature. There is no " in the beginning " in Irish mythology; and even of the ending, " the last great battle of the gods,"1 we have a duplicated and irre concilable account, not a clear-cut tale, like that of " the days when Ymir dwelt," or of Ragnarok, in the Norse mythology. It is our duty to begin research, even if we have to penetrate many a labyrinth leading to nowhere, and to lament the loss of many a plausible system. A false theory negatived is a positive result. I make no claim for my own theories, but that they seem to contain the facts known to us at present; in no confidence, but in much uncertainty, I am entering on an unexplored country. I was dis appointed that my 'Aine papers2 (a portion of the present larger study, then nearly complete) drew me no helpful criticism. I only got evidence of the existence of a deep prejudice against folk-lore and mythology, in such criticisms as " buttressing superstition" and " bringing legends into the study of forts." Now we, alone in Western Europe, have a large mass of very early literary material to help us, and (anywhere but here) it is a truism that every ray of light should be concentrated on a subject. Ireland being "the last resort of lost causes," preserved record of a European "culture" as primitive as that of the South Seas, and therefore invaluable for the history of human advance ;3 elsewhere its existence is only to be established from hints and equivocal survivals. Our early tales are no artificial fiction, but fragmentary beliefs of the pagan period, equally valuable for topography 1 The "First Battle" (Revue Celtique, xii, p. 57) mentions Norse coins, and is evidently "rationalized" and localized. Rhys hesitates to accept the battles as one, but the "First" battle seems a euhemerized version of the other. De Jubainville (Ir. Myth. Cycle, pp. 84-9) argues for their identity. The two battles first appear with Flann of Monaster, circa 1050. The battles coincide with the feasts of Midsummer and Samhain. Sanas Chormaic (ed. W. Stokes, p. 123) mentions one battle ; so does Cinaed Ua Articain (970), this being the so-called "second" fight.

Topographical comment?I will not say criticism?has been equally inefficient.1 A theory is not refuted by saying " all the great antiquarians are against you," " the Psalter of Tara (!) refutes that," or " O'Donovan has set the question past all doubt." These remarks only prove that we have hardly commenced scientific archaeology in this country. (A)?The Borderland before History. Ireland being cut off so much from the world-centre in the beginning of our era,naturally got little record from Greece, Italy, or from those wTho have left us so little independent material about themselves as Gaul and Britain have done. A great geographer, about A.D. 160, collected the names and positions of several nations and places in our island. Beyond that, we only get a tale of an expelled chief, who, late in the first century, sought aid from a foreigner against his countrymen; a hint of an unrecorded landing " beyond the shores of Juverna" ; sketches of " the Scot" (doubtless our Niall of the Nine Hostages) " making the sea foam with hostile oars"; of his defeat and the grief of " icy Ierne " at the slaughter of her sons?little else. Our native material in general was handed down (much, presumably, in mnemonic verses) by schools of bards and druids till Ireland, fully Christianized, reduced her tales to writing in the late sixth or earliest seventh century. There is little doubt as to our having some slightly altered material preceding, perhaps, the fourth century. Unfortunately this has been recast, so that even its broad outlines may be questioned. Ptolemy knows nothing of Tara or the Milesians f all his tribes are of the " tributary " or " non-Milesian " races3 and the Ulidians and Picts. However, much of value escaped, for Roman culture never intervened, and Christianity in Ireland was a tactful, warm hearted mother, and learned the stories to tell to her children. Of course, we should not presuppose that the ancient Irish had no writings. Their Gaulish and British kindred had them. Probably rituals and mysteries were not written ;4 but genealogies, lists of chiefs, and even 1 I discuss the one valid objection made to the identity of Oenach Culi at the end of this paper. 2 This may arise from his only giving coast tribes. 3 I use this term " Milesian " for the fair races presumably British, but commit myself to no theory in using these conventional names. Mil seems to have been a god, not unknown in Europe, so also was his father Bile. Rhys regards Mil as " the Celtic Dis " (Hib. Lect., iv, p. 582). Nuada was son of Beli in Welsh story. Beli was adored at Uisnech. 41 have not noted any definite pagan ritual save the sunward turn, certain formal curses, the offerings of men, cattle, pigs, milk, corn, and brushwood, and the excessive prostrations before Crom Cruach [but, since this was written, Professor Macalister's very suggestive paper on Tara gives much food for thought.] See preface to "Three Irish Glossaries," pp. xxxv-vi. [20*]</page><page sequence="4">130 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. tales may have been recorded briefly and on perishable materials; the ogham was not suited for literature. Ethicus of Istria, early in the fourth century, claims to have examined books of the " unskilled philosophers " and " unculti vated teachers" of Ireland. St. Patrick reckons " Gaulish rhetoricians " among his opponents in Ireland ; Juvenal tells us, " Gallia causidicos docuit facunda Britannos." Perhaps, these &lt; spread the light" to Ireland. The ' ' Yellow Book of Lecan " has a story how the saint burned 180 druidical books : and MacTheni (ante A.D. 698) tells of an ordeal by which Patrick and a druid tested the merits of their respective books.1 To argue that the tales of the long survival of Fin tan and Oisin imply a belief that there was no early written record is to go too far. Only such a being as Fintan could tell of colonies lost in the Deluge or exterminated, to the last life, by a pestilence (indeed, the Fintan story is evidently a clerical recension of an archaic tale of rebirths); while the Oisin cycle is confessedly late, too late to give a clue as to belief in the early fifth century?the omniscient " eagle (or hawk) of Achill" were as good an " authority " ! Taking the less popular (and on that account less corrupted and more archaic) cycle of tales of the Bed Branch, we have probably Ulidian legends of the opening centuries of our era, with no trace of the tribal pre dominance of the Milesians of Tara, or the provincial arrangements, or the ancient political importance of that place, or the dawn of the Milesian tribes of Magh Femen, Cashel, and Thomond. The Ernai and Mairtene loom large ; the manners and customs are identical with those of the Gauls just before our era ;3 and some of the legends3 are outrages on all the ethics and prejudices of the clerical writers, and evidently remotely ancient and almost unexpurgated. Now, for our own district we have a great mass of tales from several different, and even hostile, tribes; no mere fictions, but once told to those who believed that gods dwelt on the great blue peaks of Galteemore and 1 " Cosmographia Ethici," " Social History of Ancient Ireland" (Dr. P.

See also " Battle of Magh Lean a," p. 21 ; " Manuscript Materials " (Eugene O'Curry), p. 505. The opening " geasa " poem in the Book of Rights is purely pagan, save a "redeeming '" verse (pp. 1-25).

The tales were probably largely preserved by a notable guild of Druids round Cenn Febrat, or Slievereagh, round which so many of them centre. " Since the Tuatha De seized the soil of Fotla, above the ranks of the noble druids in general is the branch of Cenn Febrat."1 They were attached to the sacred mounds and tombs of Cush and Ballinvreena, where the chief gods and heroes of Corca Laegde " Ernai" dwelt, or were buried, at Temair Erann. This treasure of legend was common property of the tribes of Dairfhine and Dergthene, and passed to their bards and historians. Whether some of it came from the chief religious centre of the latter tribe, the home of the great god Bodb, on Slievenaman, we cannot distinguish; but its proto-history begins with MacNiad of the Ernai, Conaire, and Mog Neid, and his son Eogan3 " Mog Nuadat," in the second century, and ends abruptly with Eanna Airgthech, just before the introduction of Christianity3?a very eloquent fact. We, too, are fortunate in having much of it in a form preceding the synchronizing euhemerists of the tenth century and their incorrigible successors. Now what do we gain in broadest outline from these tales and poems ? There is no chronology; after the a servile revolt" so called (which is very possibly a shadow of some then recent Milesian invasion), we see the so-called " serf tribes " covering all western and southern Ireland, and new tribes only gradually spreading their power in Connacht (the seed-bed of the Tara kings), the Boyne valley, and at Tara, farther south in Leinster and in south Tipperary. Ptolemy shows at least one British tribe, the Brigantes, settled at the south west corner in Wexford.4 The Dergthene tribes of Magh (Feimhin) Femen in southern Co. Tipperary stand alone wedged among the " pre-Milesians " in Munster; the Ulidian tribes and the Eicts fill up the north-east angle of the island, from the Boyne northward. In south Munster the arrangements on Ptolemy's map agree well enough with the earliest sagas. In the latter the Erann, or Ernai,5 occupy the south 1 " Metrical Dind Senchas" (ed. G-wyrin, Todd Lecture Series), x, p. 230. 2 In Gaul " Eugen " is equated with il Esugen," son of Esus. Cf. il Les Celtes." p. 30. 3 There were Christian settlements on the south coast, at Cape Clear and Ardmore, and at Saighir Cairain, before St. Patrick. The alleged monotheism of Cormac mac Airt is plausible, as he introduced water-mills, a trained army, and a large oblong hall, and so sympathized with Roman culture. 4 Were these the Siol Breogain, whose name suggested to Ptolemy the British tribe name ? j 5 Ptolemy's " Iouernoi," from whom Ireland seems to have been named. Cf. Ernai, Ierne, Iouernoi, Iuverni. As I shall endeavour to show, " Ernai" is a vague term like " Firbolg " or Milesian. In early literature it seems to include the Corca Laegde, Clann Dedad and the Muscraige, and Corca Baiscinn.</page><page sequence="6">132 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. west from the " Genann " tribes at the Shannon mouth; the middle is held by the Muscraige; above them lie the Mairtene; above these again the Uaithne and Arada, north of the Saimer or Morningstar River. So far the arrangements in the Tain bo Cualnge persist, but a new tribe has come into sight in Femen. If its tribal genealogies may be trusted, it is a branch of that archaic tribe, living between the Brigantes and the Ernai, which called its chiefs " Maqi mucoi Netasegamonas," and recalled Nia Segamain, a great king's name1 and little else, in the past, before Cuchulaind was born. This may suggest a British origin, for there seems no other trace of the war god Segomo in Ireland; perhaps they passed up the Blackwater valley from Ardmore2 to Seskinan, where their monuments are found, or by the great ancient road, the Rian bo, up the passes between the Knockmeildons and Comeraghs, into the Slievenaman footplains.3 They were a feeble folk, under their chief, Mog Neid, and suffered from the might of the Ernai; but Eogan Mog Nuadat, probably by alliances or foreign weapons, asserted himself. He was believed to have divided Ireland with Conn, the King of Tara; at least " Conn's Half" and " Mogh's Half" were so explained ; at most a nominal question of spheres of interest was touched between the " fair races." In the tale, he and his father fell in battle, and his tribe was pitifully overthrown. His son Oilioll Aulom4 was more fortunate (the alternative succession of the Dairfhine and Dergthene is probably as mythical as that of the Eoganachta and DalCais), but he appears as closely allied with the Dairfhine and fosterer of their prince Lugaid. He outrages the sanctuary of the Mairtene of Knockainey,5 joins the land between it and the hills to Cenn Febrat, where he makes Dun Claire, above which he is buried, at the opposite side to the cemetery of the Ernai at Temair Erann. As his son Cormac was buried at Duntrileague, this may imply that the great cemetery of his race, 'Oenach Culi or Clochair, was founded later perhaps-by Fiacha.7 Oilioll and the Ernai go 1 "Of the Siabra"i his pretended chronology runs from about B.C. 150 to 50. He appears in all the Dergthene Pedigrees, though elsewhere very variant. 2 Ardmore is in Decies ; if (as seems established) the Dal Cais were " the northern Deis " (B. of Leinster, f. 319c 5 ; B. of Ballymote, 171b 39; B. of Lecan, 174b 10), this is a remarkable coincidence that both people of the Deis were Maqimucoi Neta Segamonas. The Eoghanacht prince in a.d. 630 is " King of the Deisi of Magh Femen " (Eriu, v, p. 35). 3 " Battle of Magh Leana " (tr. E. Curry, Celtic Soc), p. 1. 4 Supra, xxxiii, p. 479. 5 Supra, xxxiv, p. 50. f A territory had a right to establish an oenach (Ancient Laws of Ireland, v, p. 484). An oenach was marked by a cladh (ibid., iv, p. 221). For Irish kings' priestly functions see Rev. Celt., vi, p. 168. 7 Fiacha Muillethan appears in one legend as a northern king, if it be not another of the same name.</page><page sequence="7">Westropp?The Earthworks, Sec, of S. E. Co. Limerick. 133 to war; after alternate successes he is left, old and feeble, uninjured, living to see the victor's ruin and death. Now this story (whatever be its truth) is very remarkable. It evidently preceded the firm supremacy of the Dergthene apparent at the dawn of history. It is impossible to fancy court poets of either them or their rivals celebrating the overthrow and gross errors and follies of their princes, the dotage of Oilioll, or the ruin of Mog Nuadat and Lugaid mac Con, unless both tribes regarded the unpalatable story as beyond impeachment, " the memory of man going not to the contrary." The subsequent slow advance of the Dergthene and quietude of the Ernai in the third century tells of exhaustion from war. The late " discovery " of their later sanctuary, Sid Druim (or Cashel),some say by King Core, son of Lugaid, in the fourth century, marks their slow advance. As its name implies, it was " the abode of idolatry and druidry " (like Tara) when the idols fell on their faces at St. Patrick's approach.1 The great warrior kings, Lugaid Meann and Conall, similarly, are followed by the long obscurity of the Dal Cais during the fifth and sixth centuries, when the Dergthene tribe had split into two, and the lesser tribe, the Dal Cais, was struggling to hold its own against Connacht until a.d. 620. Oilioll's son, Cormac Cass, was mortally wounded in battle at Knocksauna, evidently trying to extend his territory westward. A century later all the east side of the Maigue valley was held, up to Cam Fhearadaig or Carnarry.2 When Lugaid Meann's conquests were consolidated, we see Dal Cais colonies up central Co. Clare to Inchiquin Lake -and the present north border of Co. Clare, a limit never exceeded. The tribes of the Tuath Echtge, the Corca Modruad, theCorca Baiscinn, the Aradha and Uaithne and the Ui Fidgeinte were allies, or allowed some nominal suzerainty to the tribes of Cass.a Of course in the legends there is a great admixture of frankly mythical elements ; still these are in essentials common to all folk stories, and sometimes attach to late historic persons (even to Garret, Earl of Desmond, and Oliver Cromwell) in the same region. Ethnology has advanced too little 1 " Ancient Laws of Ireland," i, pp. 22-23 ; v, pp. 472-5. " Tripartite Life of St. Patrick," pp. 41, 195. Cashel, founded by Core, see MS. R. 1. Acad., 23D 5, p. 99. 2 Despite the usage of '* Cam Feradaig " for Carnarry till after 1530, and its always being defined as on the northern border of older Thomond, O'Donovan places it on the southern border on the authority of a chaotic poem naming it, Slieve Claire, etc., in no order. It was seized by Tigernmais from Conmael after the battle of Oenach Macha. Feredach, son of Rochorp, was buried in its cairn (Metr. Dind., x, p. 267), of which the base remains (North Munster Archaeol. Soc, i, p. 168, P. J. Lynch, and Proc. R. I. A., xxvi, p. 88). '3 The chronology is usually?Oilioll Aulom, a.d. 190-230 ; Cormac Cass and Fiacha Muillethan, mid. third century ; Mogh Corb, 334 ; Lugaid Meann, 350 ; Oonall, 378 ; probably the first authentic date in their history.</page><page sequence="8">134 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. to help us. All that is clear is that, unlike the dark " Fir Bolg races," the two Cashel tribes were fair, ruddy, large men, with golden, or red, hair, and blue, or green, eyes; the same is told of the Tara tribes.1 The legends, unlike the Red Branch ones, belong to the "horse-riding period." Much may yet be done by our scientific colleagues to solve racial questions; till then, archaeology alone can do but little. Myths are to be expected in early tales ; the goddess Edaoin, making her favourite, Mog Nuadat, appear like a stone pillar while his enemies hacked actual rocks and pillars ;2 OiliolPs ear bitten off by the outraged goddess of the Mairtene; Cormac Cass and his singular medical treatment, can easily be classed, but a few other more intrusive matters in the more historic parts call for a note. I am not ready to believe that the mere, name " Lugaid " marks a god; " Lugodeecas" (of Lugaid) is common on the ogmic pillars, and Lugaid in the later history ; " Nuada " on the contrary, nearly always conno tates the idea of " the Severn god," Nuada Argetlamh. There is a legendary " Lugaid Lamhdearg" in the chaotic past of the Dal Cais descent ;3 the epithet is transferred to Lugaid Meann, on the edge of the historic period; the pride of Munster and opprobrium of Connacht, he is entirely devoid of more super natural features than attach to most favourite conquerors. Lugaid macCon, also, though in a mythic past, seems a mere mortal; as for his epithet we have " Cunogenus " in Gaulish inscriptions, and " MacCon " among the descendants of his stepfather, the MacNamaras and others, to this day. With his sons, however, we have pure god myth, though, I think, rather late, when the triad was infecting^everything ; their names are Oendia, Caindia, Trendia4 (one god, gentle god, mighty god), but they are evidently intruded into some .of the king lists (not all) merely to assert the poisonous myth of the alternate succession, for which history (even in the tenth century) was falsified and warped.3 " Lugaid Delbaeth " seems an old god,6 returned too late to earth. 1 Cormac mac Airt had " golden hair, like blue bells were his eyes " ; "his eyes were like (the bloom of) the sloe " (Irische Texte, Ser. i, p. 204). The Dal Cais?" Lachtna, a fair man from Cragliath " (Book of Munster, circa a.d. 847) ; " Dalchais of the yellow hair" (circa a.d. 900, Book of Rights, p. 81); "fair-skinned" (Wars of the Gaedhil, p. 79); and many allusions to their red and golden hair and green or blue eyes, in Cathreim Thoirdealbaith (from 1240-1318). 2 " Magh Leana," pp. 30-31. 3 The Cedraige, evidently from their name non-Milesians, are stated to be a branch of the Dal Cais (Battle of Magh Leana, p. 173). 4 New Ireland Review, xxvi, p. 135. So the three sons of the Boyne goddess are " Tear-bringer, Smile-bringer, and Sleep-bringer " (Rev, Celt., xxiv, p. 270); and the gate-keepers of Tara are " Key, Post, and Valve " (ibid., xxii, p. 309). 5 As by the alleged " Dal Cais kings" of Cashel, Aedh, 573, and Lorcan, son of Conligan.

Limerick. 135 He kindles five streams of magic fire, from which his sons, the fathers of the Delbna tribes, spring,1 and they are affiliated to the Dal Cais, undoubtedly without old warrant, for a mere political end. The horrible, and equally archaic, legend2 of the worm of Cian seems transferred from the god Cian to the human eponymus of the Cianachta, who had also to be affiliated to the Dal Cais. These show that, under political stress, tribal pedigrees, like the later " Roll of Battle Abbey," had a caddis-worm-like tendency to attach extraneous rubbish to themselves. Lastly, the simple churchman of the pre-Norse times (who tolerated god tales, and, at most, tried " to lure them into decency M) was replaced two centuries after by a priest full of the evil and wrongs of Norse heathenism, so gods had to become human?kings, wizards, jesters?anything but " gods." The old god reappeared at different intervals in archaic literature, so the later reviser made him not one man but many. It is with these transformed gods and their local cultus that I am most concerned in the first half of this paper, as I am more concerned with the tribes and their legends and history in the second. Both studies are needed to elucidate the character of the earthworks (residential or sepulchral) of the ancient Cliu mhail mhic Ugaine in south eastern Co. Limerick.3 (B)?The Gods in Cliu. We ventured to embark on the dark and stormy sea of Irish mythology to search for the uncharted subject of the local sanctuaries in Cliu at Cush, Knockainey, and Clogher. We established the objects of our search; but a mass of material of equal importance remains about other places and gods,4 both on the ground and in our literary sources, so we cannot leave it aside, but must deal with, and leave it to the amendment of the students of its obscure and difficult subject. It takes courage to attempt to deal with the Irish gods. The very word causes a nervous feeling that one's work might get confused with the work of the older antiquaries, who sat and created, without study, visions of Phoenician, Cuthite, Indian, serpent-, cow-, and even pig-gods worshipped 1 New Ir. Rev., xxvi, p. 130 ; xxv, p. 73. 2 Hib. Lect., iv, p. 392. 3 Cliu and Luchair evidently overlapped in the debatable land of Coshlea, Luchair extending to the east of Cenn Febrat and to Tul Tuinne, Dun Tultha (or Tonntinna), on Loch Derg (Metr. Dind S., x, p. 239). Glenlara, named in the " Battle of Magh Leana " as apparently near Killarney, is more probably Glenlara on Cenn Febrat, to which a defeated prince flying from Magh Feimhin to the south coast at Beare might more naturally have sought temporary refuge among its tangled oak woods and streams. The territory of Curoi mac Daire extended between Knockainey and Slievereagh (Mesca Ulad, p. 17). 4 Supra, xxxiv, p. 53. R.I.A. PROC, VOL. XXXIV, SECT. C L^1!</page><page sequence="10">136 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. in Ireland, or with that of inventors of druidical rituals and arrangements of earthworks to form eagles or serpents1 on the map of Ireland! One must prepare for bitter hostility, not only from the unexpected survivals of these discredited theorists, but from students of the old schools, whose faith in the pseudo-chronology and pseudo-history scientific antiquaries must endeavour to demolish. I will avoid the terms "fairy" and "elf" for the Sid folk, for each suggests the English idea, and gives as false an idea of the hero-like Sid as could well be imagined. The terms "demon" and "goblin" are, perhaps, even more misleading. There is no necessary implication of ugliness, or wicked ness and malignity, in "the bright gods of elder time." The Badb was usually beautiful and stately?a Pallas or Artemis. She only gradually reaches the nadir of loathsomeness and horror?" nor uglier follow the night hag " than she?in late works, culminating in the Cathreim Thoirdealbaigh. Even to the present day some goddesses?Aibinn, Aine, and Cliodna, for example?kept all their supernatural beauty. There were two main groups of gods in old Ireland,2 the Tuatha De Danann (many of whom are traceable in Gaul and Britain) and the Fomorigh. As in other primitive faiths, the " departmental" allocation of divine functions (elaborated by the later keen Greek intellect, and accepted in globo by the unimaginative, practical Roman) was not followed by the Celt. The gods overlapped each other in attributes and functions. Lucian was irritated and scandalized at the mixture of Hercules and Mercury in Ogmius in Gaul; the god Nodens seems to have resembled Mars and Neptune, with, perhaps, a trace of Apollo and Pluto, so we cannot take absolutely the identifications (even when made by their worshippers) with the Roman gods. I find no trace of the other family of gods outside Ireland, nor, indeed, in Cliu, unless, perhaps, of Bress; and even he is a half-breed. Besides these, however (and the Aine family was of the Tuatha De), are a number of gods of other races, often, possibly, non-Celtic, from the great Bodb Derg to the obscure mountain-gods, like Cliu, Donn, and Febra; and ancestral ones, like Cairbre Muse, Dergthene, and Deda, with his forty sons. The subject in its crude beginning leaves no excuse for dogmatism. 1 I know the possessor of this remarkable map, but not its author. 2 For the general subject consult various articles on the Gaulish and Irish gods in "Revue Celtique" ; Hib. Lect., iv; " Ir. Myth. Cycle"; Arthur B. Cook, "The European Sky-God" (Folk-Lore, xvii, p. 28); " Encyc. Relig.," iii; Charles Squire, " Mythology of the British Isles"; Dr. J. A.

Limerick. 137 I state what seems to me most probable views; but some, at least, must get overturned by further research. Though we have a substantial mass of early statements, even good, but slightly later, authorities do all they can to contra dict the obvious facts, and make the Tuatha De not " demons or fairies, but descendants of Japhet." All such euhemerist assertions are worth nothing. The " Fomorigh," or " under-sea folk," were probably gods of non-Milesian tribes. Only in the ranks of the Tuatha De do the gods of Gaul and Britain appear. The "Fomoraig" are "champions of the Sid" probably of the holy mounds, not of their rival gods. We have a similar phrase in " the host round the cairns," in St. Columba's poem, and the Coir Anmann says that Cormac Coinloinges, " who watched at cairns," was called Mia in Chaim, " the champion of the cairn."1 Of the Tuatha De we have full evidence from Gaul of the worship of Lug, Ogma, Neman, Net, Danu, Grian, Brigid, and Anu, with, perhaps, Midir2 and Bile. Along with them we have the three crow-like goddesses of war, one called Bodbh of Battle, " (C)athubodua," and the divine bull of the legend of Cualnge, " Donnotaurus."3 The worship of many of these gods in Britain is equally well established. Lieu or Lugh; Nudd (or Ludd) Lamereint, Nuada Argetlamh; Manawyddan, son of Llyr (or Manannan); Don or Danu ; and Govannan or Goibniu. The sacred mounds were divided between the divine races by Manannan and Bodb Derg; but they were "people of the Ski" (whatever exactly was intended), probably long before our literary sources begin. Traces of the worship of the following gods I have so far found in Cliu:? Lug, Nuada, Nechtan, Cuil, Aine, Ferfi, Segomo, Net, and Manannan, of the Tuatha De. Of the non-Milesian gods I may note Bodb Dearg, Cliu, Dairine, Dergthene, Deda, Garban, and Febra, Donn Firinne, Edaoin, Cliodna, and a swarm of the relations of Deda, son of Sen, including the mountain goddesses Mis, Echtge, and Eblinn, and the river goddess Sinann. 1 Log. cit., p. 403. 2 This I doubt, as the bull and Phrygian cap suggest that '' Medros " is Mithra (Rev. Celt., xxv, p. 47). The question whether Berekynthia and Brigendo are the Irish war goddess Brigid deserves more study. I venture to suggest that the mortal representatives of certain gods bore their patrons' names; the priestess of Knockainey may have been "'Aine." I do not think (as has been suggested) that kings were called "Nuada*' ; the name at different periods arises from chronologers dating the same god at various generations. Lastly, the equation of Bile with Balor rests only on similar but doubtful pedigrees. 3 Borne by human chiefs, as by the prince of Helvii. For Tarvus Trigaranos see Rev. Celt., xviii, pp. 253-4.

It is a widespread commonplace in Ireland that our ancient literature says nothing about the early gods. This arises from the acceptance of the euhemerist statements, and, like them, is unfounded.1 The pagan gods are fully recognized as such till the late tenth or even mid eleventh century. High clerics, like Cormac, felt as little hesitation to name them as St. Luke felt when he named Zeus, Hermes, Ares, the Dioscuroi, and Artemis. Evidently the new prejudice roused in the wars of the Norse and Danes rendered it desirable to sweep away every trace of a pagan deity, though the survival of so much ancient literature rendered the effort unsuccessful. Let us trace this decline from the frank statements of the early writers.2 Tain bo Cualnge (edited and written down in the early seventh century, and, in its existing form, as old as the eighth-century glosses) was fragmentary when first transcribed. It tells of the direct intervention of Lug, Neman, Manannan mac Lir, the Bodbh, and the Morrigu, daughter of Ernmas, and it regards Cu Chulaind as the son and re-incarnation of the sun-god Lug himself.3 Phrases like "the blessing of gods and non-gods" occur in the archaic Fled Bricrend.4 Even the " godless " Tain bo Flidais has an appari tion of the war spirit. Leabar na hUidre plainly calls Conchobar and Dechtire gods and earth-gods ;5 and Dechtire's son, Cu Chulaind, is a god, descended from the gods Net, Elathan, the Dagda, Cermait, Lir, and MacCuill, the husband of Ireland herself. A passage from the very early "Yellow Book of Slane" speaks of Cu Chulaind's holy mound, Sid Setanta, in Muirthemne.6 Tirechan7 (a.d. 656) tells how St. Patrick and his com 1 This feeling occurs in *' Book of Bally mote," 35b, 31, 34a, 39.

Note how little a Christian writer then hesitated to tell facts; but Tirechan's candour is as nothing to that of Cormac, King-Bishop of Cashel (about a.d. 896). In the latter's Glossary1 we find?"

He calls his predecessor, Eogan, " Mog, son of Nuada," and mentions 'Aine, daughter of Eogab&amp;l. Coir Anmann2 has many early notes?"In Munster was wor shipped the goddess of prosperity, whose name is Ana, and from her was named the 'Two Breasts of Ana/ over Luachair."3 It mentions the gods Nuada Derg Lamh, "Nia Segamain of the Siabra"; Nuada Salfada, son of Engus; Nuada Necht; Nuada Finn; Nuada Argetlamh; beside more definite entries?"Manannan mac Lir, god of the sea"; "the Dagda, the fire of god; he was a beautiful god, for the Tuatha D^ Danann worshipped him, for he was an earth god to them,"4 and " Diancecht, deus Salutis." Even the rather late "Battle of Magh Leana" (p. 90) tells of Conn's "powerful friends," the Tuatha De, helping him in that combat, and the Mesca Ulad names "the great Dagda, son of Ethliu, the good god of the Tuatha T&gt;6" with " Delbath, son of Ethliu," Aengus Og, son of the Dagda and Cermait honeymouth, " three noble youths of the Tuatha De."s In Tain bo Cualnge, Bruden Da Derga, and Fled Bricrend abound-many allusions to pagan gods6?" I swear by the gods by whom my people swear/* " by the god of my people," or " of my tribe* " or " by whom the Ulster folk swear," " by the gods whom I adore," and " we give thanks to the gods for our return to Erin." Indeed it was impossible to expurgate the old paganism and its phraseology. They even got copied into late works like the Agqllamh, which, despite its sturdy euhemerism/says?" the Tuatha De Danann, who are unfading and whose duration is perennial."7 The common sense of the old scribe of the Tain, in the Book of Leinster, looked facts in the face, but did not omit them?"

It is curious to find some belief in the Sid folk in even so orthodox a person as Rev. Geoffrey Keating, about 1630, where he does not understand how the euhemerists obtained tidings of such early events and wonders: was it aerial demons, the Sid lovers of the oldest inhabitants, who told it ? or was it engraved on flags of stone ? The gods so recorded are of the Aryan type, not the grotesque fiends of America and Asia, the gloomy, but impressive, gods of the Euphrates and the Nile, but supermen, like those of Olympus or of the Valhalla; " departmental gods," not almighty, subject to fate, wounds, mutilation, and pain, and the joys, passions, and sorrows that beset mankind. Sometimes great nature powers, like the Sun and the Ocean, they were yet compelled at times to seek human aid, and were parents of men by mortal lovers and protected, though they could not always save, their mortal offspring or favourites, as Zeus could not save Sarpedon. Their tale continued to be written and (when at last it passed into the hands of credulous pedants, bent on giving Ireland a prehistoric history, at least to the days of Noah) it was an invaluable quarry from whose fragments mosaics of false history and imaginary king lists could be made. These waifs and wreckage (washed up from a past ten or twelve centuries before the writers) became, not the exquisite stories of Greece or the fine sturdy tales, full of humour and pathos, of the Edda, but dried and mutilated husks, duplicated, split up,1 or blended with others, set in contradictory frameworks of chronology, where a god, like Nuada, becomes various persons in the year before our era 1741, 1007, 600, 150, 112, or 50, and the Milesian invasion took place in B.C. 1569, 1229, 1066-71, 554, or 331. There are yet persons living who regard any criticism of this turgid mass of perverted compilation as blasphemy against the greatest glory of our land, but their time is past, and soon the pre-Christian annals will be ranked with the tales of Geoffry of Monmouth, and left to mere country archaeologists of the older schools. Then, when we have removed the strata of euhemerist fiction and rubbish3 from the ruin, the foundations and beautiful fragments of the once noble fane of Irish mythology will stand clear to the sun. Doubtless when that is done men will wonder, no less at the large amount which has escaped the destruction of over fifteen hostile centuries than at the credulity that so long held, against all reason and evidence, the mass of late fiction which concealed it to be the only true history of early Ireland. 1 Like the divergent versions of the Battle of Magh Tured. 2 " Rubbish," like the pre-deluge legend, Keating, " History," i, sect. v.</page><page sequence="15">Westropp?The Earthworks, Sfcn of S.

His epithet was a note in many a religion, the creed of every high religion that " God's hand was not shortened," and recalls the pictures of the Disc God of Egypt with his hand-ended rays blessing his devotees. The euhemerists could not conceal Lug's nature?" Lug, like the sun is the splendour of his face, men are unable to look upon it" ; " as brilliant as a summer's day he rose from Manannan's territory in the east"; " he rode the steed of Manannan (the white-maned wave), swift as the bleak, cold wind in spring" ; when he is in the west men ask "what else than the Sun is it ? It is the radiance of Lug Lamhfada."2 He was " Master of all the arts," " Lug, with whom are all the arts." Caesar when he spoke of the Gaulish Mercury, " the inventor of all the arts,"3 evi dently meant Lugns. In Gaul he was a centre of cultus; the towns called " Lugdunum "4 were his special seats, three still echo his name?Lyons, Laon, and Leyden; the fourth is now St. Bertrand de Comminges, where the Lugnasad festival was kept in August, as it was in Ireland. He seems to have been personified (like the war goddesses) by a raven," Lougos," being so translated ;5 so Odin had two raven spies. He and his divine " boy," like Lug and Cu Chulaind,6 were represented in Gaulish carvings. Not to repeat his long story in Ireland, he was son of the Dagda, but his mother was Ethniu, daughter of the horrible darkness god Balor, the god of the evil eye. Lug's slingstone drove the eye through the fiend's head, as his Greek equivalent Hermes slew Argos, the many-eyed night.7 He was worshipped by Mac Greine, one of the three divine husbands of Erin. Men were called from him Mog Loga; his great sanctuaries were at " Lugmagh," or Louth, and Naas, which last was known as " Lis Logha "; perhaps its mote 1 Hib. Lect. iv., p. 384 ; " Ir. Myth.

The rainbow was his "hurling-stick," and the Milky way his u chain."2 In late times the annalists made him a king, from A.M. 3370 to 3331 (B.C. 1871-1830, but others said 1714-1674), and writers put in his mouth the degrading confession, " I am Lug Mac Ceithlenn, of Adam's race, who have returned from the dead,"3 making him ride a charger as a late feature. Some said his valour was only a seventh of that of Hector, but was (even so) 2401 times that of the bravest " modern hero," Murchad, son of Brian, in 1014 ! He was, however, cited as an example to fight against the Danes, for he " sprang over every obstacle and exterminated and expelled the foreigners and pirates out of Ireland."4 Even so late as 1750, Seaghan O Tuama compares Prince Charles Edward to Lug of the trenchant sword.5 Lug wTas ancestor of the Corca Laegde,6 and grandfather of Conaire (whose son, Cairbre Muse, we shall note); his descendants lay in the cemetery of the Ernai or Slievereagh, and perhaps one of the three tumuli on which " men feared to sit because of the Tuatha De " was dedicated to the sun god. He was also divine father of the Corca Oiche and Corcamodruad.7 The festival of the goddess Aine at Knockainey depended on Lug's festival, and was cele brated for three days after, and continuously with, it,8 for she being a harvest and meadow goddess, and giver of fertility to crops and cattle, naturally needed the sun. It will be remembered that Art Imlech gave his name to Emlygrennan, below Slievereagh, and dug the forts there; he was slain by Bress. The latter had been taken captive when Lug slew Balor and warriors of the Fomoraig " as numerous as the son of Ler's horses in a sea storm." To save his life, Bress offered that the cattle should give milk all the year round, and that there should be a harvest every quarter, but, only when he told his captors the lucky day for harvesting, was he set free.9 In another story, when Nechtan, son of the god of Nuada, reigned in Munster (his wife's sanctuary was at Clogher, near Emlygrennan), Bress imposed on him as tribute the milk of 100 dun cows for every house. " Lugh, who was dutiful on all occa sions," helped the overtaxed province. He singed and dyed all the cattle to 1 Folk-Lore, xvii, p. 157 ; " Manuscript Materials," p. 478. 2 Squire, p. 62. 3 " Ir.

Cork.1 Nuada and the War Gods.?The connexion between the god Nuada and the ruling races and districts of mid-Munster is well established and of much mythological importance. Like most primitive people, the Celt gloried in the divine descent of his tribe and chiefs. Professor MacNeill is most pro bably right in regarding the ancient accepted genealogies as " ending " with (i.e., leading up to) a god.2 Early people claimed not only the personified nature power, but the super-man and super-beast as ancestors. The Gaulish inscriptions give us names like Bodvogenus, Camulogenus, Esugenus, Totatigenus, Morigenus (" Morgan "), and Rhenogenus,3 and the general term Devogenus (God's son), as the man derived himself from Bodb, Camulos, Esus, Totates, the Sea or the Rhine; while others bore animal names, like Cunogenus (MacCon), Urogenus, and Artiogenus (MacMathgamhain), the non-Milesian Irish tribes Conraige (hound), Sograige (bitch), Gamanraige (calf), and Osraige (fawn, or even otso, werewolf)4 attest the other phase.5 I long hesitated to receive the names in genealogies as actual gods (regard ing them as mortal adaptations, like Diogenes, Phcebe, and Silvanus); but the presence of Lug Lamhfada, Manannan mac Lir, or Oirbsen, and Nuada Argetlamh is unmistakable. Nuada was closely bound up with Munster? Cathaoir Mor (ancestor of the Dairfhine, whose tribal ancestor Lugaid Laegde, was buried at Temair Erann on Slievereagh), descended from Nuada Necht and Nuada Finnfhail. The rival Dergthene not only called their first great prince " Mog Nuadat," servant of Nuada, but were derived from Nuada Argetlamh in direct descent; indeed, Mog Nuadat (if Cormac's Glossary be correct) was a son, being called " Mog, son of Nuada."6 Now, in view of the prejudice against treating the late eleventh-century imaginary king lists as anything but history, I must first methodize my material to show the identity of Nuada under his various surnames. Nothing 1 Metr. Dind S., x, p. 217 ; see supra, vol. xxxii, p. 271. Hackett and Borlase regard Leaba Mo Laga as a shrine of Lug (Dolmens of Ireland, iii, p. 769). 2 New Ir. Rev., xxvi, p. 134.

Brigid is triple, "of the smiths," "of the poets/' and " of the doctors " / " Eriu, Fotla, and Banba are Ireland ; MacCuil, MacCecht, and MacGreine, her husband ; Macha, Neman, and Bodb, the war goddesses, are interchangeable;2 while triads of separate gods were worshipped every where, as "Alldai, Buada, and Buan" ; or " Oengus, Boadan, and Elcmair," at the great Boyne Tumuli ;3 " Sinann, Dairine, and Macha," at the Shannon; " Eogabal, 'Aine, and Fer Fi," at Knockainey ;4 and " Nuada, Nechtan, and Boadan," on Carbery Hill, above Trinity Well, the source of the Boyne. This well may have been so dedicated to conciliate those who worshipped the old divine triad, in order that, like Patrick, they might " bind themselves to the Trinity." The fertility of the Irish mind in inventing genealogies is exuberant. Even Bunyan, with his convincing parentage and biographies of personified vices, pales before the riches of Irish allegory. We meet endless characters like " Violent, son of Extinction, son of Darkness, son of Ailment" (in the Dind Senchas of Carman); " Scrutiny, son of Cogitation, son of Great Knowledge, son of Enquiry " (in Cormac's Glossary) ; " Yellow, sen of Fair," and " Terror, son of Great Fear" (in Fled Bricrenn); the Dagda's wives, "Lie, Guile, and Disgrace/' and the druid's three sons, " Prophecy, Knowledge, and Truth " (in the Battle of Magh Leana).5 This teaches us caution in receiving genealogies as evidence for the non-identity of the Nuada names.6 Chronology proves it as little. The Nuadas are dated B.C. 1741, 1007, 160, 112, or 50; but then (as we saw) the Milesian invasion has the dates B.C. 1569, 1229, 1066, 1071, 554, and 331; Queen Medb's father, Eochu, is dated B.C. 137, 56, and 27 ; Eochu Mumho, eponymous King of Munster, who fell in Cliu at B.C. 1429, 1275, and 776. Endless other " synchronisms" show that, so far from being "authorities," the chronologers could not agree to tell the same story.7 Such systems are less authentic than the very myths of the gods ! and it must be remembered that the ever living gods naturally appeared in different ages in stories which, when 1 Ir.

In fact, these pedigrees are heterogeneous fragments stuck together. 7 The parentage of several of the great gods (e.g. Mider) is most variant. Ir. Myth.

His wife, Boand, " of the silver fore-arm " or " silver yoke," was drowned by the hazel well, which similarly drowned Sinann, who was also Dairine. It was identified with the Severn,1 beside which lay the shrine of Nodens; Cuil, another wife of Nechtan, was patroness of the chief cemetery of the Dergthene at 'Oenach Culi (or Clochair), near Knocklong.2 By this table it is evident that 1 to 5 are identical with the silver-handed god, "son of Eochaidh,father of Tadg," and predecessor of Bress; that 7 and 11 are the same; that 4, 7, and 8, the father of Glas, the red, or red-handed, god, are identical, and 4 identifies them with the first group; that 4, 5, and 10, relations of Sithbaicc and Dairfhine, are identical, and only the vague Nuada Fullon is unidentified save with Bress, the successor of Nuada Argetlamh. Nuada was a British god, not hitherto found in any Gaulish place-name or inscription.3 So far from being " an Irish high king," he was (as we noted) a purely divine nature power, god of light, of the deeps (of the earth and sea) and of war. Thanks to the discovery of his temple in 1805 at Lydney Park, Gloucestershire,4 and his representation in metal there, we know how his worshippers regarded him. Tablets are dedicated to him as " Devo M. Nodenti," or Nudenti, or Nodonti. He rides in a chariot drawn by four horses, wielding a club, his head decked by a spiked crown,5 or by rays. The winds fly round him ; he is surrounded by tritons and sea monsters, and a fisherman catches a salmon.6 His temple has three cellae, so perhaps he was one of a triad, as at Sid Nechtain, on the Boyne. Many figures of wolves were found, and " Nudd the superior wolf lord " figures so late as the sixth century in a poem of Taliessen. London and Ludgate were traditionally connected with his name " Ludd/' and he may have been the god whose temple lay where rises the great dome of St. Pauls. Being a leading war god, he may be identical with Nedem (Net),7 Camulos, and Segomo. Net's wife Nemetone (Nemon) 1 "Cu Nuadat," in one version of Boand legend (Metr. Dind S., x, p 29).

Now beside the last great river, called from the goddess, towers the lofty Craglea ; there the Dal Cais venerated their war goddess Aibinn (the " Fair " or " Pleasant"). Could she have been their ancestress called Macha, Net, and Dairine ?2 In Ireland Nuada Silver Hand was also a great warrior god ; ruler of the Tuatha De, and their leader in the battle of Magh Tured; there he lost his hand, which was replaced by a magic silver one.5 The Welsh have lost the legend, but Nudd's epithet " Lud Law Ereint" shows that it existed. In Ireland, as in Britain, he was a wealthy god, with great herds of cattle, a builder of forts from London to Cliu, and a god of rivers?the Thames, the Severn, and the Boyne; he was at least venerated beside the Suir. He and his wife, Boand, are distinguished by epithets implying " white " or " silver." Finn Fail may even refer to the Fail, the white pillar or slab, rounded at each end, which formerly lay beside the mound of hostages at Tara.* Now (as a certain war god)5 Nuada, even if not identical with the war gods Camulos, Segomo, or Net,6 is connected with Dairfhine. The Dergthene7 tribes, the later Eoganachta and Dal Cais (MacCarthys, 0'Donovans, O'Callaghans, O'Briens, MacNamaras, MacMahons,8 &amp;c.) were all descended from him and from the war goddesses. Their great ancestor was son (Mog, Mac), or servant (Mog) of Nuada ; his father was Mog Neid (servant of Net).9 The Eoganachta were called Ua Neit, descendants of Net ;10 their ancestor was Nia Segamain (champion of Segomo, a Gaulish war god). Etterlamh, son of Nuada Argetlamh, 1 It was not, however, put up by a Briton, but by a native of Treves. 2 Folk Lore, xxi, pp. 3 26-7 3 In later legend, his severed hand was dug up and made to grow to its injured limb. The Badb, as a royston crow, had flown off with the hand. 4 It fell a few years since and revealed this fact, and that it was little over 6 feet long, not 12, as Petrie wrote. 5 Dr. Hubner, ed. of Prussian vol. of Latin Inscriptions. Nos. 131-141 ; Hib. Lect., iv, p. 126.

Could this represent a contest with a priest of Nuada ? A Mog mac Nuadat was plundered by Asal; cf. Drom Asail in Co. Limerick.

E. Co. Limerick. 149 was connected with Glenlara, in Luachair Deagaid. This is probably Glenlara on Cenn Febrat, for evidence shows that the great and holy hill was in that district before Luachair was curtailed.1 Nuada Derg (or Salfota) was son of Dairine, ancestor or ancestress of the Ernai. The Dergthene tribes dedicated their chief cemetery and assembly place to the wife of Nuada's son, and their chief mountain home (Craglea) to a war goddess. Nearly all the southern tribal genealogies2 meet in Nuada Argetlamh ;3 from his son, Nochta, sprang the Gorca Laegde; from his son, Roma, the Muscraige ; from himself the ruling races. All of these divergent lines meeting in the one point can never be a late fiction; they show that the warlike races of Munster gloried in it, and boldly asserted that they " were sprung from the War God's loins," and had the war goddesses for mothers of their tribes. The glory departed from Nuada by the thirteenth century, though Lug and Manannan held their own. He and his son Tadhg became druids, not the stately hierarchs of the early ages, but tricksters and conjurers; and the author of the Agallamh na Senorach calls the great god of the rivers, "Nuada, a pestilent fellow and a magician."4 Manannan Mac Lir.?" The King of the Land of Light, in the Tain bo Cualnge ;5 the great sea god ; the British Manawyddan, son of Llyr,"6 has not been found named in any Gaulish or British inscription; whatever be true of the British Nodens, the Irish Nuada has nothing in common with him. His name looms large in the legends of Cliu as of all Ireland. He is one of the most definite of the Irish gods; we see him, armed with his red and yellow spears, his terrible sword " Retaliation " (which never failed to kill), and his daggers. Clad in his magic breast-plate and helmet, the gems flashing back the light as his great horse, " Splendid Mane," whirls his chariot along, he is, in later tales, " the horseman of the crested sea."7 Drawn by the white-maned waves (his coursers, his silver-horned stags, his sheep, " the fleeces of the flock that knows no fold," or his many-hued salmon) he drives over the flowery fields of the sea, a glorious god, whom the Irish hold in love to this day. So important was he that he and Bodb Derg of Magh Femen were 1 See " Magh Leana," pp. 23-25, Rev.

He gave the gods magic food and drink which kept them young1 like the apples of Iduna. He, like Nuada, was broken into different personal forms?(1) " the son of Allot, the splendid wizard of the Tuatha De Danann " ;2 (2) Gaer; (3) Oirbsen of Aran, killed by a grandson of Nuada; Loch Oirbsen (Loch Corrib) broke out of his grave ;3 (4) the son of Cerp and king of the Isle of Man, in the time of Conaire the king; (5) the son of Lir, the famous merchant of the Isle of Man, and (6) the son of Athngo, who avenged the sons of Uisnech. He was, under the name " Oirbsen," divine ancestor of the Ciarrhaige of Kerry, and, under the names " Luguid " and " Conmac," of the Conmaicne of Con(maic)nemara.4 The renowned Mongan in the seventh century was his son by a mortal mother.5 There was a sinister aspect (as became a personification of the lovely but deadly ocean) in Manannan. He could not bear victims to be rescued from him. I am told that the father of the late Lord Morris and his sons had difficulties in preventing some fishermen on Galway Bay (usually the best natured men) from forcing the survivors of a wreck back into the waves? "no man would have luck that tried to save them." Horses with naked young men on their backs were driven into the same bay on Garland Sunday (the day of the questionable Crom Dubh,6 perhaps the malignant god to whom Tigernmais offered human victims), but they were allowed to return from the realms of the sea god. Perhaps his altars, like those of " the pitiless Teutates, the horrible Esus and Taranis " (denounced by Lucan) were " no milder than those " of the Tauric Artemis. In a Welsh tale Manawyddan builds a fortress of human bones and mortar, and a beehive structure of many cells; this is at least suggestive of a grim side to the myths.7 1 Atlantis, ii, p. 385 ; Ir. Manuscript Ser. (R.I. Acad.), i, p. 46 ; Agallamh, ii, p. 116. 2Leab. Gabh., p. 169. 3 " Death of Athirne " (Rev. Celt., xxiv, p. 272), Dind S. (Ibid., xvi, p. 276.) 4 New Ir. Rev., xxvi, p. 136. 5 " Compert Mongain " in Yoyage of Bran, i, pp. 24, 27. 6 Miss Matilda Redington recorded this interesting story. There is a prejudice against retrieving a hat, or any other object blown into the sea, on the same bay, as has often been noticed. There is much evidence for human sacrifice in ancient Ireland ; on building a fort (Eman, Dun Emrys, cf. pig sacrifice at Dunfidhne) ; or for Harvest (Tailti and Tara), See R. Soc. Antt. Ir., xliv, p. 86, cf. Ir. Myth. Cycle, pp. 59-63; sacrifices to Crom Cruaich, &amp;c. (Metr. Dind S., x, p. 275, Voyage of Bran, Appendix, p. 304). The king of the Sid sentences men to die ; he is perhaps a priest of the mound (Bruden Da Derga, Rev. Celt., xxii, p. 368). I have myself, as a child, " passed through the fire," on St. John's Eve, near Attyflin, Co. Limerick. The Dindsenchas of Tailti mentions "the burning of the first-born," as well as cattle sacrifices, at the Oenach till St. Patrick forbade it. Sinless boys were offered, and their blood mixed with the soil of Tara to ensure good harvests (Eriu, vol. ii, p. 155). 7 Squire, p. 70.</page><page sequence="25">Westropp?The Earthworks, fyc, of S. E. Co. Limerick. 151 In Cliu, Manannan was the instructor and slayer of Fer Fidail, and the husband (or father) of 'Aine and Aife of Knockainey. In other tales his numerous sons love or wed these goddesses; but, as I shall try to show, these were coast stories brought inland, for the Knockainey stories have no such episodes. The Shannon was called from him "the stream of MacLir."1 Cormac of Cashel, telling of him as a merchant of the Isle of Man, adds " the Irish and British call him god of the sea."2 He met the usual fate of the Celtic gods?as " Oirbsen the wizard," Uillen Red Edge, slew him in the battle of Guillen. A Donegal legend makes him ask St. Columba if the Sid folk could be saved; the reply being in the negative, he cries that he will no longer help the Irish till they are weak as water.3 In Co. Limerick the questioners are fairies and ask " Crom Dubh." Later writers made him a wizard, but, altogether, he resisted the hostile influences of Christianity better than any other god,4 and remains, in half secret belief on the Mayo coast, a being of great and dangerous power. (B)? The Tribal Gods. Beside the great national gods there were a number of local deities, doubtless those of the pre-Celtic tribes. As their worshippers were absorbed, and genealogies invented to affiliate them to the stem of the conquerors, so such gods, in some instances, were affiliated to the divine race of D6 and Ana. Many were probably mountain and lake gods,5 a few, river gods, others tribal ancestors; but their connexion with the Sid mounds goes far to stamp them as divine, however " parochial" their cultus may have been. The goddesses, Eehtge the horrible, who was reared upon children's flesh ; Eibliu, daughter of Guaire; and Mer, daughter of Treg, undoubtedly were reverenced at Slieve Aughty, down to Feakle in Co. Clare, Slievephelim, and the Barnan Ele, or " Devil's Bit."6 They, however, are not connected with the group of Cliu, and would overcrowd an already overcrowded paper. Bodb Deug.?Of all the gods of Munster " Bodbh Derg," by a general consensus, was ruler.7 This probably sprang from his holy hill of Slievena 1 Rev. Celt., xvi, p. 276. 2 Sanas Chormaic, p. 114. 3 " Voyage of Bran," ii, p. 213. 4 Rev. Celt., xxxv, p. 6-9; Encyc. Relig., p. 6; Folk Lore, xxviii, p. 181. The Rennes Dind Senchas (Rev. Celt., xvi, p. 276) makes him a druid and a champion. In Achill he is "a king of druidism and enchantment and devil's craft." (Larminie's " Irish Folk Tales," p. 1.) 5 So the Gauls (like ail nations) had their holy mountains where gods were called Paeninus (Pennine Alps), Vosegus (Vosges), and Dumiatus (Puy de Dome), See Encyc. Relig., viii, p. 863. 6 Mesca Ulad, p. 15. 7 " Lesrend of Cacht," Book of Lismore (Eriu, viii, p. 35). R,IfA. PROC, VOL. XXXIV., SECT. Cf [23]</page><page sequence="26">152 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. man being in the chief and oldest territory of the conquering Dergthene, as their special goddess, Aibinn, became chief banshee of Munster in later days. He was at least affiliated to the great gods of the Boyne, being " son of Aengus of the Brugh, called the Dagda "; but this was a confusion, as the Dagda, " Eochaid OUathair, greyer than the grey mist," was evidently his reputed grandfather. There seems reason to believe that Oengus was a pre-Celtic god, unknown to Gaul and Britain, whose vast chambered cairn of Newgrange, the noblest monument of the Bronze Age in Ireland, impressed the early conquerors with reverential awe. Invading polytheists were ready to accept and bring into their own pantheon any local god. Even Israel took over the Baals, along with the vineyards and tillage of their worshippers; and the lion-worried settlers in Samaria, and the townsmen of Gezer, took over the worship of Jahveh. A local god " understood the country," and was worth winning as a friend. As Bodb and the sea god divided the holy mounds among the gods,1 each was evidently a " commissioner" for a different divine race. Others said that Bodb was " son of Eochaidh garbh, son of Duach temen, son of Bress, son of Elathan,2 which has this much in its favour, that the predominance of Nuada in the Dergthene beliefs may have brought his successor, Bress, into prominence, and, as we know, Bress was celebrated in the legends of Cenn Febrat. A " Derg of Sid Berg" appears among the Tuatha De at Magh Tured,3 and, in other legends, the Dagda (not Bodb) allots the mounds, and was himself preceded in the ownership of the Brug mna Elcmair by Elcmair and his wife.4 " Bodb, over the Sid assemblies of Munster," dwelt on the stately dome of Slievenaman, in southern Co. Tipperary, probably in the cairn on its summit.5 It has, however, a second cairn, an acknowledged Sid, on Knockshegowna, one of the spurs of the hill, which bears the same name as another famous fairy hill, farther north, in Ballingarry parish. The great cairn is about 86 paces round, and 9 feet high. Close to it (as at Uisnech) are remarkable natural rocks, one, with a slab resting upon it, and called "Finn's table," 5 feet 4 inches by 4 feet 6 inches by 3 feet thick; and, farther south, 1 Ir.

E. Go. Limerick. 153 resting on four pillars, is another stone, 7 feet by 4 feet.1 These probably mark Bodb's holy place. Nuada Derg had a fort on the same mountain, and may, perhaps, have been identified with Bodb Derg* if the Dergthene tribe took over the worship of the god of Slievenaman. The hill, as we saw,3 forms a conspicuous and beautiful landmark, when looking down the vale of Aherloe, from the hill of the goddess Aife, over Gleneefy and Duntrileague. Bodb seems to have had two residences?the Sid, so widely celebrated as Sid na mbann, Sid bann finn os Femen, and Sid Femen; and a second, some where near Loch Derg. Some said he was brother of the goddess Dechtire, and uncle to Cu Chulaind.4 He was a god of the more amiable type. When pressed to let his attendants pursue and wound Ler, the sea god, he, with calm dignity, forbade it, saying, "I am none the less king of the Tuatha De Danann because he is not submissive." He also controlled his anger when the wicked Aoife said that her husband Ler would not trust his children with him. Like Lug, he is called " one to whom all science has done homage."5 He had friendly relations with the mortal rulers of the land, and made a treaty with King Conn of the Hundred Battles, undertaking that neither he nor the Tuatha De under his rule would injure the king. Fer Fi of Aine was a hostage, or perhaps a guarantor, of the treaty. From his taking the place of Nuada Derg in some versions of the Mog Nuadat legend, I venture to suggest that the Dal Cais endeavoured to identify the chief god of their new settlement with the more familiar god, Nuada, whom their ancestors had worshipped before their invasion of Ireland. Bodb had a numerous offspring.6 His " seven sons " and his " three sons " are named. Among his children are Ferdoman; Artrach, who had a bruiden of seven doors, and a liss, Rath Artrach, once resplendent, but blighted even in Finn's day. Bodb's daughter, Sadb, was plighted to Finn at Sid Femen ;7 but (of course in so evidently late a poem) she was mortal, and her death was announced to " her highborn kinsmen" of the Sid, the Tuatha D6. Bodb's three sons were born in his father's Sid at the " many-windowed Brugh of the Boyne."8 - 1 Ordnance Survey Letters, Co. Tipperary (R. I. Acad., 14, F. 18), i, p. 170.

He kept a sort of training college, which gave " Sid na mbann " its name, " the mound of the women." Legend speaks unfavourably of the management. Bodb's own daughter was abducted; so was Deltbanna, Conaire's attendant, the wife of Life and daughter of Cannan;1 and Finnchada, who was carried off from it by Sengarman, so late as the reign of Dathi, in the early fifth century. Some said that Connla, son of the High King, Conn, when he was lured away by the lovely woman of the Sid, went with her, not beyond, or beneath, the sea, but to Sid Bodaige, by which Sid Buidb is probably intended.2 Cliu tried to lure Conchenn, another daughter of Bodb, out of it.3 In it, too, was edu cated Aoife, the cruel wife of Ler, who turned his children into swans. Another scandal was attached to Sid Fer Femen, if it be the same place, or the second cairn, when, during the absence of Oengus, son of the Dagda, on Samhain night, the god Midir carried off to it the unfaithful wife of Oengus, Englec, daughter of Elcmar. Len Linfiaclach, a retainer of Bodb, of Sid Femen, gave his name to Loch Lein, or Killarney Lake, in Luachair Deadaidh.4 His servants were also of doubtful character. His swineherd, " Nar-squinting-with-the-left-eye," sits cooking squealing heads of pigs over the fire, and bringing bloodshed to every feast which he " graced " with his presence."5 Two other swineherds, Friuch and Eucht, were turned to ravens.6 Yet another, Tummuc (in the form of a many-coloured beast), was swallowed, and became the Donn Bull of Cualnge, as he revealed to King Ailill. It seems doubtful whether the second residence, Sid Buidb, was near Portumna, or near Killaloe. It was beside Loch Derg. Perhaps it was the conjoined rings above Derry Castle, or even the Sid of Craglea; but 1 have no evidence. Tra Buidb Derg, on Achill, also bears his name. I know nothing but the mere dictum of O'Curry7 to regard Bodb Derg, king of Magh Femen, and his namesake, the son of the Dagda, of Loch Derg, as different persons. O'Curry had a childlike faith in the historic character of the Tuatha De. In the "Dream of Oengus" the king of Magh Femen evidently helps Oengus on his own ground, when he wins him the swan maiden on the lake in the Galtees. 1 " Magh Leana," p. 1 (and " Tochmarch Momera," p. 155) ; Rennes Dind S., Rev.

Limerick; Muscraige Mitaine, in Cliu among the Mairtene, in the Gal tees; in Muscraighe Treitherne, Muscraige Chuirc, Muscraige Tire, and Muscraige Breogain, in Tipperary, Muscraige Luachra, still Muskerry, n Cork, and small fragments at Tontinna on Lough Derg, in east Co. Limerick, in Magh Femen, and elsewhere.2 There was some close bond between it and the Dergthene, especially with the Dal Cais. In legend it was closely connected by descent with the CorcaDuibne in Kerry and the Corca Baiscinn in Co. Clare. When the tribal genealogists attempted to " regularize " the position of non-Milesian tribes (long before the euhemerist movement), they divided the family god, or eponymus, into a triad, the eldest of whom was (Oengus) Cairbre Muse. But so far from the group belonging to the third century, the Tain bo Cualuge mentions " the three Cairbres from Cliu " as warriors of fame. More than two centuries earlier legend made them sons of Conaire, High King of Ireland, successor of Conn of the Hundred Battles,3 " B.C. 82." His legend4 was certainly pagan, and outraged all Christian ethics. His epithet Muse was wrenched into Mo Aisgey " inordinate desire/' for the Muscraighe sprang from him and his own daughter, Duben, or Dovin, whence Corca Duibne. The territory covered the modern Corcaguiny and Iveragh to Valencia Island (Dairbre). In the former section we find several ogmic inscriptions with her name, " Maqi mucoi Dovinnias," one on a noble site, on the entrenched headland of Dunmore, overlooking the Blaskets. It seems very clear that mythology ran mad on this legend. Duben was possibly (as seems implied) the mother^ and then the daughter of Cairbre; then, to get out of the vicious circle, she was turned into a son. Cairbre's name was equated with Corbad, parricide, by some local Fluellyn. His name was said to have been Angus, and he and his brother slew their stepfather, MacNiad,5 in the arms of their mother. They were close allies of her last 1 " Sanas Chormaic," p. 127. The name " Muskry O'Noonan" is extant in the Elizabethan Surveys.

Limerick from Aine to Lough Derg. The mythology of Cairbre Muse seems to have no foothold in fact, and abounds in contradictions. On the birth of his misbegotten sons all nature sickened, and the crops failed. The tribes ordered that the children should be burned, but a druid saved one, Core, putting it on a red cow's back. After a year the sin entered into the cowr, who swam out to sea, and became the " Cow Rock," Bo Bui} Rhys,2 in a very elaborate study (which students should master and assess for themselves), equates Cairbre cinn chait, Cairbre, father of Ere ; Cairbre, the enemy of Bress; Cairbre Muse, the owner of the dog, " Mug Eime," and MacKinealy (the slayer of Balor, in the Torry Island legend), with the Gaulish " Mercury " and Lug. Be this as it may, Cairbre Muse is evidently from first to last a mythical personage and a tribal god of any date before the time of the Raid of Cualnge to the third century. We are confronted with a difficulty. Keating3 alleges that the descendants of Conaire alone were the Ernai. He tells how Mog Nuadat expelled the latter from Munster, " so many as would not submit." Conaire had an ancestor, Daire Doinmhar, who was possibly confused with " Daire "or " Dairine " in the Clann Dedad and Corca Laeghde pedigree. Conaire may be confused with another High King, Conaire Mor (B.C. 110, son of Eidersceol, a descendant of Degad, son of Sin, and of Oilioll Erann, and successor of Nuada Necht), from whom the Clann Dedat claimed descent. The three tribes possibly were branches of the Ernai by descent or affiliation. Indeed, the Iouernoi of Ptolemy seem to overspread all south west Ireland up to the Vellabori. The latter have of late been placed as far north as Tralee, but their position may be anywhere from Iveragh to the "Dour." Cliu.?Another eponymus of the extensive district of Cliu mhail mhic Ugaine, in south-east Co. Limerick and along the Galtees to the Suir, meets us in our district. The mighty mountains bore his name, Crotta Gliach, " the harps of Cliu," which I venture to suggest are the two harp-like cooms, with strings and frames of stream gullies, seen on the flank above Aherloe. Grot, however, is probably a pre-Milesian word, as a tribe named Crotraige dwelt along the foot-hills, and the name possibly gave rise to the folk-tale. Cliu may have been connected with the goddess Clidna, for the Mairtene, another non-Milesian tribe, near the Galtees, were called " the champions of Cliu and the contentious hosts of Cliodna,"4 suggesting such terms as " champions of 1 " Leabhar na hUidhre," 54a, and "Book of Leinster," " Magh Leana," p. 28.

Legend tells how Cliu was a harper who came to Baine's Sid, a place so sacred that the very " Book of Rights "* forbade anyone to walk on it " by the light of red fire," like the mounds of Slievereagh, that men dared not sit upon " for dread of the Tuatha De,"2 and the procession with flaming " wisps " at Aine's mound. Cliu became harper to King " Sinirdub," and used to play on two harps at once, whence the mountains were called Crotta Cliach. He went to the " Sid of the Men of Femen/' where Bodb dwelt, to carry off his daughter Conchenn. The inhabitants tried to drive him off by magic, but in vain; so, after a year, the lady Baine lost patience, and sprang out in dragon's shape, when Cliu died of the fright. Hence the lake was called "Loc bel draccon."3 It was evidently not the place of its name in Westmeath, but the lake in the Galtees, at which Oengus of the Brug, aided by Bodb Derg, won his swan-wife, " Caerib Ormeith," daughter of Ethal Anbual of Sid Uamain in Connacht, whom he found with her transformed maidens sporting on Loc bel draccon.4 The Leabar Breac5 tells a nearly identical story, but the king is called " Smirdubh mac Smail" of the Three Bosses of Sliab Ban, and Cliu seeks Bodb's daughter at Sid Femen, till the water bursts up under his feet, and forms Loch Beat Sead, on the mountain. On this " Coerabarboeth/' swan-daughter of Ethal, and her fifty companions float; it is also " Loc Crotta Cliach " and " Loc bel dragan." It is evidently some lake, still unidentified, on the Galtees. Rarely in Western Europe do we tread so closely in " the footsteps of the dead old gods " as around Cenn Febrat and the Galtees. Cuil and Nechtan.?Nechtan and Nuada Necht are sometimes taken as son and father, and sometimes as identical. Nechtan encouraged the family of Eogabal to settle on Knockainey ; and Cuil, wife of Nechtan, was patroness of the chief cemetery and fair of the Dergthene, called Oenach Chulimna, Nechtain, and 'Oenach Clochair.6 Nechtan brought the first pregnant cow to districts, the word Nia not occurring?yet there is no evidence for a district of Cliodhna near Emly in the Mairtene territory. 1 "Book of Rights," pp. 5, 21, the present Knockmany, a Bronze Age cairn chamber. There was also a Cnoc Maine near Kiifinnan (Silva Gadelica, ii, p. 123), probably the place referred to as Sid Bain in the Cliu legend.

Ireland,1 and the euhemerist Flann (in 1050) says he was killed by Sigmall, grandson of the god Midir ;2 but this is of the warped stratum of legend, not found in the early myths. Some (by the q to p change) identify him with Neptune, but this is more than doubtful ;3 and unless he is Nuada (with whom even then we have to go back to Nodens. in Britain, to find him a sea god), he has no connexion with the ocean. Old writers equated Necht with Sneacht, snow, because " Nuada Necht was as white as snow," a folk derivative.4 He was certainly Nuada, " fair head "or "red hand," a king of Munster, whose rival, Bress, was slain by Lug's device at Cam Ui Neid,5 for Nuada Argetlamh is superseded by Bress, and the king of Munster seems to be Nechtan. Nuada, his wife Boand, and son Nechtan, all abound in epithets like " white " and " silver." Nechtan reckoned the Corca Laegde amongst his human descendants. They owned a fort, Dun mic Nechtain, near Kenmare. I fancy the Co. Clare fort, Cahermacnaughten, is named from a human family. Near Kenmare " River," Inber Scene, dwelt also a namesake, a lady, Necht.6 He and his three cup-bearers could alone approach to look on the sacred well at the source of the Boyne, and a Loch Nechtain (so far unidentified) lay among the Echtge Hills.7 Despite her evident importance, I have so far found no legend of Cuil. She may lurk under an alias name, for what was told of the Hazel Well and the fate of Nechtan's wife Boand was also told of Sinann, Macha, or Dairfhine, the Shannon goddess, who had many alternative names.8 As regards Sinann, her sister " Echtach " is often confused with " Echtge the Horrible," the goddess of the mountains of Echtge, who was reared on children's flesh, and was -given the mountains by her lover, Fergus Lusca Beist. The latter was cup-bearer to Gann and Genann,9 who, with Sengann, 1 Egerton mss., 138 ; Catal Irish mss., Brit. Mus., p. 640; R. I. Acad, ms., 23. D. 13, p. 146. 2 Leab.

She was of the Tuatha De, and reared at Cuil Echtair, near Sid Nennta.1 Altogether, the important position taken by the Irish goddess corresponds to the high position of the mortal women/queens, and warriors, like Boudicca and Medb. It is notable that great sanctuaries, like Knockainey and Oenach Chuli, are called after women, and that Carman, Tea, Macha, Tailti, and Maistiu loom so large at Carman, Tara, Tell town, Emania, and Mullaghmast. Human sacrifice was offered at Emania, Tara, and Tailti, perhaps to the mother goddesses of the harvest. Deda, Garban, and Febra.?The great plateau of Cen Febrat, or Slieve reagh, so prominent an object over all eastern Limerick, was, as we saw, the chief cemetery of the Erann, or Ernai, the Clann Deda, and Corca Laegde. All the outstanding names of their mythic ancestry, save Deda2 and Curoi (the latter presumably buried at Caherconrigh), are attached to its monuments and mark it as the great cemetery of the Ernai at Temair Erann,3 so wrongly placed by O'Donovan as near Castle Island. In the later frantic attempt to unite all the tribal genealogies, the Ernai and Muscraige are given " Ailill Erann, the god of the bolg ga,"4 as common ancestor; but, in most docu ments, the Clann Dedad Ernai derive from Deda, son of Sen. Sen5 was probably father of a large group of gods of Mountains and Lakes ; Deda gave his name to the Clann Dedad, or Degaid, and to Luachair Dedad.6 Sen was son of the High King, Eochu Airiomh, " who was seventeenth in descent from Ugaine Mor, and first dug a cave in Erin,"7 and reigned from " B.C. 125 to 110," according to the chronologers. Deda and his brethren of the Clan Rudhraighe were expelled by the line of Eremon from Ulster. They fled (in one story)8 to Duach, King of Munster, who gladly received so valuable an army and gave them lands, so they became the Ernai (Ptolemy's louernoi). When Duach died, the High King Eochu Feidlioch (Queen Medb's father), 1 Some made her daughter of Deda, son of Sen (see infra). 2 Are the Clanna Deagaidh of Deda's line the Clanna mac Deichead or Maqi Deceddas of the ogmic inscriptions ?

The Ernai Dedad, with the Ultonians and the Feini of Tara, were named as " the three noble races " of Ireland in the Senchas Mor. Dega had forty sons; chief of these was?(1) Daire,5 father of the famous Curoi, King of Munster, in the Bed Branch* tales. Curoi was rival of Cu Chulaind, by whom, and by the treachery of his wife, Blaithnaid, he fell ;7 and his son Lugaid avenged him by slaying the " Hound." Forgoll, another son of Daire, was ancestor of Finn and Oisin; and Lugaid, a third son, had a wife Eithne, said to be buried in the group of disc barrows at Cooloughtragh in Temair Erann.

The latter, being the popular candidate for the kingship, was blinded by Duach. Another story tells how Duach fell by the Ulstermen and Degad, son of Sen, King of the Ernai. The hero Finn descended4 from Daire, son of Deda; while his mother, Murni, was derived from Tadg, son of Nuada, son of Achi. Clann Deda held all Luachair5 to Curoi Mac Daire's fort on Cen Febrat. Though Deda is nowhere (to my knowledge) called a god, he seems ancestor and father-in-law of a number of eponymi, mountain gods, and connexions of gods. His fame grew on no mortal soil, but is all mythic and superhuman; we need hardly look for a nucleus of fact, if such ever existed. Deda's issue, Corco Deda and Corca Muige (both in western Co. Limerick), are in the list of the Aithech Tuatha.6 Probably the pre-Milesian tribe had its own divine beings and ancestry which later scribes tried to euhemerize and connect with those of other tribes. Febra, son of Sen, Deda's brother, was slain by Cain Derccdualach, husband of the goddess Aife, sister of Aine and Fer Fi; from these heroes the mountain derived two of its names, Cenn Febrat and Sliabh Cain. Garban, son of Dedad, slew his uncle's murderer, and he and Febra, when the gods became mortal, were reputed to lie under two of the pre-historic mounds in Temair Erann cemetery, probably those to the south-west of the spring at the gorge of Glounacroghera.7 South from them, Lugaid Laigde, the eponymus of the Corca Laigde, was buried. Garban's other grave, the source of Wexford estuary, we have already noted; he is called " Garman Glas MacDegann," so his identity is well established. Eithne and three other ladies lay in the conjoined rings of Couloughtragh. She was niece of Curoi. Ere of Irluacra probably lay in the mound in Ballinvreena.8 This 1 Metr. Dind S., x, p. 305.

Now I have used the term " Ernai," not only for the Corca Laegde, but also for the Clann Degaid, and Keating (ii, p. 313) says that it was wrongly applied to these, and should be only used for the descendants of Conaire Mor, the " Muscraige," Corca Duibne, and Corca Baiscoinn. This seems doubtful; it is evident that the Clann Dedad and Corca Laegde had the same cemetery and sanctuary on Cenn Febrat, and occupy the very position where the " Iouernoi" are shown by Ptolemy. The Corca Oiche, possibly, are also of this kindred, though they, like the Ui Fidgeinte and the Corca Laegde, affiliated for political reasons in later years to the Dergthene tribes. The Sanas Chormaic (p. 16) speaks of the Corca Laegde or "Dairfhine" as descendants of " Daire Doimthech," and it seems evident that an early pedigree existed in which he appears with certain gods and ancestors?Lug, son of Ethleann, Deaga, Sithbolg, Nuada Neacht, and a group consisting of "Daire Sirchreachtech, Lugaid Laide, Lugaid macCon, MacNiad, and Duach," and a Sen Lugaid ;l Dairine was equated with Daire. The pedigree was old enough to find a place in the Saltair of Cashel. When the Corca Laegde tried to draw nearer to the Clann Deagaid, they naturally identified the pedigree names with the latter's ancestors, Sen, Deaga (Deda), and Daire.2 Lugaid Laegde was placed sometimes as fifteenth in descent from Ith (circa B.C. 900), sometimes a contemporary of Eogan and Art (about A.D. 300); Daire was first called " King of the West," then " King of the World," and reached the zenith of his power in the Cath Finntraga, when he invaded Corcaduibne. The Book of Lecan made him father of Mac Con and the three Fothads, mythical kings of Ireland (a.d. 296). Finally, it is evident that, when the Dergthene tribes of Cashel and Thomond became powerful, the Corca Laegde inserted aDergthene" into their own pedigree as a common ancestor, as the Tradraige, after attempting apparently to affiliate to the Caenraige and Corca Baiscoinn, asserted their kinship to the Eoganacht of Cashel to win favour of the powerful King Fedlimid,3 about A.D. 840. When we recall the extremely mythical legend of the three Cairbres, we see that we are not to let such tales weigh against the general fact that, like Crim thann, Nia Nair " of the Ernai" at the beginning of our era (one of whose forts stood on Slievereagh, near the Ernean cemetery), the term " Ernai" 1 Identified by some with Lughaidh Laeghde " Magh Leana/' p. 9. 2 " Miscellany " of Celtic Soc.

In Daire, Ded, Mis, and probably Lugaid Laegde we are dealing with gods, or demigod ancestors, not with facts. Dergthene.?We find in the Ancient Laws1 that " deirbhfine and deirgh fine " were tribal divisions, so one suspects that the ancestors from whom the Dergthene and Dairfhine are named were mythical and not even personal.2 Perhaps the descendants of Nia Segamain, in the flush of their invasion of Magh Femen, called themselves " The Tribe." In some of their pedigrees, indeed, a triad " Dergfhota, Deirgthenic, and Deirg "3 take the place of the single ancestor, the father of Mog Neid. The Corca Laegde pedigree makes him son of Nuada and great-grandson of "Lug macEthleann," a god con fessed. " Dairine " may also have been a goddess, as the name is identified with Macha4 and Sinann. We find a Core, son of Dairine, a king of the Corca Duibne, who accompanied St. Patrick to Ulster in late story.5 Dairine was also father of Nuada " Dearg " or " Salfota," foster-father of Dergthene's grandson, Mogh Nuadat/ and has been identified with Daire, son of Sen. Lugaid mac Con, who is seventh in descent from Dergthene, is contemporary with Oilioll Aulom, fourth in descent from him?the name Lugaid being as common in the one pedigree as the epithet Dearg in the other. Nothing can show more clearly that these and similar tribal pedigrees are built out of disconnected fragments, not consistent or truthful, but real, archaic tradition, warped, but not pure fiction, and so worthy of critical study. Donn.?This god has the merit of being free from the family complica tions of the divine fathers of tribes. Donn Firinne7 and Aine are the two ancient deities who hold their own in Co. Limerick as Donn Dumach and Aibinn do in Co. Clare. The word Donn8 has yet to be studied. It occurs in many a guise among the deities of Gaul, Britain, and Ireland, and is not merely the name of men-like gods (of both sexes), but of the Donn Bull, in 1 Ancient Laws of Ireland, iv, pp. 282-3. % Sanas Chormaic, p. 55. 3 Book of Lecan, f. 215, also "Miscellany" ("Corca Laidhe") as Dergthenedh, Deagha Dearg, and Deadh mannra, son of Sithbholg, p. 57. 4 Thus Duben, the sister-wife of Cairbre Muse, was made his son, and Lugh's mother, Eithliu, became his wife, Eithniu.

Ireland, and its counterpart, the Donnotaurus in Gaul.1 The Bull of Cualnge and his rival were reincarnations of human beings, and the step " from his brother the beast to his brother the god " was a short one in the ancient faiths. There are a great number of supernatural persons named Donn in later Irish literature; perhaps local forms of the same god. In the " Battle of Ventry "2 we have a li3t of the (human) Tuatha De, who hasten to defend Ireland against the allied armies of the whole outer world. Seven bear the name, Donn from Sid bee Uisge, Donn Fritgrinne (? Firinne), Donn Teimneach Donn Senchnuic, Donn Chnuic an dos (evidently two hill gods), Donn of the Sandhill (Dumach, now Dough, on Liscannor Bay, Co. Clare), and Donn of the Swamps. In the " Triumphs of Congal Clairingneach,"3 appears Donn, a Sid king, son of Iomchad, descendant "of the Dagda, of the prime stock of the Tuatha De Danann." Another Donn, son of Fionnlaoch,4 brought 100 women from the Sid of Aed (Assaroe, Donegal), to the Sid of Mis (on Slievemish, in Kerry). Among them was Aedh's wife ; and she, jealous of her rivals, turned them into deer, and Donn into a stag, which was eventually slain by Bran and Finn's other hounds at " Cenn Maghair," on the coast. The Bruden da Dergab has a Donn Tetscorach of the Sid mounds; the Agallamh has Donn, son of Midir, whose Sid was assaulted once a year by the Tuatha De.6 Irish gods (like those of Greece) did not hesitate to fight their own kindred, or we might suppose him of some other race. We are also told that Lir of Sid Fionnachaid, " the man who excelled in prowess all the Tuatha De," was slain by Caeilte (a late mark), who also slew Lir, Dub and Donn of the forces of the Sid."1 It is impossible to regard the Welsh goddess Don (the Irish Donn) as in any way connected. Cassiopeia's chair was her fort, Llys Don, but at least we have the name Donn for a god, a goddess, and a holy bull. Donn, son of Midir, or " Donn of Uisnech," was closely connected with our district, for his sons, Eogab&amp;l and Uainide, and the children of the first, Aine and Ferfi, loomed large among its gods. He was in touch with Nechtan, who recommended the migration, and therefore with Cuil of Oenach Chuli. I think it very probable that the Donn of Firinne, the god of the long ridge, 1 Hib.

I heard as a child, about 1872, from the peasantry at Attyflin much about King Donn. His blue dome was an infallible weather-glass, whence its name, " The Hill of Truth." He was a powerful fairy, who gathered the clouds on the peak. The fairy hares1 on the hill were his pets, " no doubt," and were often seen. He lived in the Sthrickeen,2 the big heap of stones on top. I heard from better educated (and therefore less reliable) sources that stories were told, the same as those embodied by Michael Hogan, " the Bard of Thomond.'' Hogan describes Donn, (i in his chariot of meteors," defeating the Cratloe fairies, and carrying off the young bride of Macconmara of Carrigogunnell; but the Ossianic flavour and bombast conceal the local mythology, if any. In a genuine (but probably late) folk verse, "Donn Firinne, Robert of the Carn, and Geroid Iarla, who vanished in the clouds,"3 are the three chiefs of the Munster fairies from " Carnthierna," near Fermoy to the Shannon. Donn of Dough dwells in a large sandhill, in the "golf links, near Lehinch, Co. Clare ; and I remember (in 1878) when people did not care to pass by night, and lights were said to be seen there. The last of the ancient bards of Thomond, Andrew Curtin (" fallen on evil days and evil tongues," in the eighteenth century) prayed this Donn to take him as his servant.4 It was better than depending on the illiterate squires, though Curtin received much hospitality from the MacDonnells of Kilkee, who appreciated Irish poetry ; but tradition does not tell that Donn granted the poet any favour. Edaoin.?Though forgotten locally, the yellow-haired Edaoin, the tutelary goddess of Eogan Mogh Nuada, deserves mention.5 She resided at Inis Grecraige or Beare Island, so their friendship may have been accidental. She rescued her protege, and aided his escape to Spain by making the pillar-stones and rocks appear to his pursuers in the forms of his company. The deluded foe vainly broke their weapons on their supposed victims. The story is evidently archaic, though we have it in a late and corrupt form. Elsewhere she appears with Cliodna and Aine as the " treasures of the Tuatha De Danann."

As we saw, Fer Fi thoroughly avenged the violence of Oilioll Aulom to Eogabal and his sister 'Aine.2 In addition to luring his enemy's family into civil war, he raided and burned Dun Claire fort, which deed keeps his remembrance green at Knockainey.3 He had a holy mound at Sid Firai mhic Eogabailf " to the south," perhaps the most southern of the conjoined rings. He first discovered the Slige Cualann road, and was guarantor of the treaty of neutrality between Bodb Dearg and King Conn. Now Cacht, wife of Eogabal, was tutelary goddess of Fingin mac Luchta, an early king of Munster (circa a.d. 130), who used to meet her at Kilfinnan, for Luachair Deadaid covered the district at Cliu, at least to the east of Cenn Febrat.* Cacht broke the treaty by warning her favourite against every move of Conn.6 Fer Fi's mother is said in a late poem to have been daughter of Crimthann Nia Nair, King of Munster, " B.C. 3 to A.D. 13,"7 who owned a fort of Cenn Febrat. Nia Nair commemorates another tutelary goddess, "Nar, the witch of the Sid mounds,"8 who protected Crimthann on his naval expeditions from Howth;9 but his fort there was not at the Baily (as O'Donovan decided), if it was in sight of Meath.10 If Fer Fi (as seems probable) was Fer Fidail, son of Eogabal, he was instructed by Manannan mac Lir, and used to bear a trident; but, having abducted and accidentally drowned the Lady Tuan, the sea god slew him.11 Eter was his wife, and Emer was wife of /Uainide.12 EogabaPs sons were Fer Fi or Fer 1, Lu, and Fainle. The others, Fere, Fermait and Fer Fidail, are possibly alias names of Fer Fi. In the latest edition of the legends 'Aine is also killed by Oilioll Aulom. A still later poem makes the latter straighten his bent spear-point with his teeth, one of which got poisoned with the 1 "Yew fork," a suspicious name in view of the magic yew episode.

Thus we have a complete evolution in the 'Aine legends, in which she appears as goddess, princess, banshee, and poisonous monster;1 but to the peasantry only the first stage remains. The euhemerists were discounted, and 'Aine remained beautiful, gracious, helpful, and deathless, as when the five Firbolg tribes adored her, before the coming of the Dal Cais. The Knockainey Legends.?There was no standard of pagan orthodoxy, and every tribe seems to have had its own recensions and divergent tales of the parentage and acts of the gods. Our study of Nuada, and W. M. Hennessy's study of the war goddesses,2 make this very plain. The tendency to make triads of the gods, even breaking up one into three gods, began early; the Gaulish carvings show the three birds of the war goddesses. The stories are kaleidoscopic, the same names and events reappearing in different combinations. In the 'Aine legend3 there were evidently two variants, one an inland version (perhaps of the Mairtene and Dergthene), making her and her relations children of Eogab&amp;l; the other a coast version (perhaps of the Corca Laegde), where the sisters were children or connexions of the sea gods.4 (1) The Knockainey tales tell how Eogabal and his brother and family come from Uisnech ; the outrage of Oilioll Aulom and revenge of Fer Fi; the magic yew tree, and the semi-historic battles of Cenn Febrat and Magh Mucrima. In one 'Aine is perhaps the wife of Dubthach, on Cenn Febrat, and her sister Aife, wife of C&amp;in, on that hill. The earliest trace is circa a.d. 886, in Sanas Chormaic. "'Aine's History " has an early tinge; the others recognize the gods as wonder-workers, but liable to violence and death; the latest reduce them to fiends. (2) 'Aine, Aife, Fer Fi, and Aillen of Sid Eogabail appear, so there can be no question of identity. The ladies are, however, daughters of Manannan, or his ollamh, or his father Ler, or his son Aillen, of Etar, or of Gailian; Etar is son (or grandson) of Etgath. (a) One of the latter gods, usually Aillen or Fer Fidail, desires Manannan's wife.

Outside the connected legends we have hints of many others. 'Aine (daughter of Modann),1 Lir, and Oengus of the Brug figure in one; Aife was daughter of Midir/ and the sisters vary as daughters of Eogabal, Eogamal, Durgabal, Lir, Gailian, Delbaoth3 or Midir. Aife, Clidna, and Edaen, " the treasures of the Tuatha De/'4 are of Manann&amp;n's household, and get drowned when surf-riding at Glandore, whence Clidna's Wave. Etar of Benn Etair (Howth), son of Etgath, pined away and died for love of 'Aine.5 Aife, daughter of Delbaoth, of Lir's household, is changed into a crane in the obscure "crane bag" story.6 The Leahhar Gabhala gives Aidne (Clidna), Aife, and 'Aine as daughters of Partholan ; Lir's children are probably the same group, Aodh, Aoife, and Ailbe, but they are daughters of Oilioll Aronn elsewhere, and the two first are successive wives of Lir.7 It is quite evident that three supernatural ladies, Aine, Aife, and Cliodna, were reverenced along the coast, at least from Glandore in Cork to Portacloy in Mayo, and that they give their names to the heroines of many divergent tales.8 No better example could be given of the impossibility of welding our material into a con sistent whole, and no better excuse can be offered should one get lost in such a quagmire. A few closing deductions may be given. We have a mass of material from the seventh to the seventeenth century which can only yield results to very critical examination. The mere heaping up of extracts from every period can yield nothing but contradiction and confusion. Those who regard the least supernatural tales as the oldest, and reduce the stories to histories of mortals, are reversing the true process, as any attempt to arrange the sources by their periods shows at once the godlike god as the earlier. Those who shut their eyes to the results of Continental and British study, and believe the Gaulish gods to have been high kings in Ireland over a thousand years before Christ, 1 Silva Gad., ii, p. 111. 2 Ibid., p. 110 ; Tochmarch Etaine, Irische Texte, i, p. 127, Ir.

Such " irra tional rationalizing " as made the Tuatha De, flying on the wind to the north coast of Ireland, to be Scandinavians coming in ships, and perverted science by pointing out the forts and skulls1 of what was a divine pantheon, is outside the true methods of study. Even a knowledge of Homer and Ovid might have shown our students that the heroes of Luachair and Muirthemne are replicas of the demigods who fought before breezy Ilion ; that Cu Chulaind was a counterpart to Sarpedon and the divine Achilles, and that Lug and Manannan were but Apollo and Neptune in Celtic attire. In A.D. 900, gods were recognized as gods; then the euhemerist movement by 1050 brought them down to dead kings and heroes and, later still, to magicians,2 protecting spirits, and family banshees, and at last to devils.3 Only the peasantry were faithful to the spirit of the old tales ; the god became a wizard and the druid a jester in literature. The gods " who o'er the Celtic roamed the utmost Isles " were as nearly dead as the Aesir and Wanir. Yet the dead weight of the old literature kept back the expurgators. A " redeeming verse " after a pagan legend, the praise of charity above keeping geasa, a verse on the Trinity after a poem to the " Seven Daughters,"4 reconciled the pious. It was as well, for there is less to offend a Christian spirit in the ancient tales than in St. Patrick's abuse and brutal threatenings in the late popular Finn poems, so unworthy of the "humble and holy man of heart" of his own writings and of the early " Lives," and even stories.. Ireland had no Saemund to give us uncorrupted tales of the old gods, but much survives before a.d. 1000 to enable us to "judge a people by their gods," and get an all-important side-light on the brave and brilliant race, poets and missionaries and warriors, wTho evolved the gods in their own image before St. Patrick preached. One advantage the Irish mythology enjoyed?there had been no cruel struggle between it and the new faith.5 The wise tolerance of 1 Sir VV.

King Cormac is slain by the siabra in old tales, " by siabra and demons," says Keating (Hist, i, sect, xii), " a devil attacked him," say the Four Masters. The Book of Ballymote discusses whether the Tuatha De " were diabolical demons," or a human tribe. So late as 1317 the Cathreim Thoirdhealbaith makes the Badbh dwell in hell. So the Welsh gods became demons or fairies (Squire, Myth. Brit. Isles, " Decline of the Gods "). 4 Celtic Review, x, p. 263. 5 In Scotland John Carsewell, Bishop of the Isles, denounced his flock for preferring tales of the Tuatha De Danann to the faithful Word of God and other cases.

It had won "by the Word, not by the sword/' and, itself thoroughly Irish in a generation, could afford to let the Sid faith die out. Christians gathered at the old sacred places for consulta tion2 or pleasure; the pillar was marked with a cross or a holy name ;3 the bile trees were left to flourish till cut by some hostile tribe, or felled by storm or by old age ;4 the holy fire was tended by nuns; the wells rededicated and held in new honour; the old tales of tbe gods were told without offence before priest and pious chief. So, wisely and without hurry, the old faith was let die out, while, had other methods been adopted, the clue not only to Irish but to British and Gaulish paganism had been lost for ever. PART II. (F)?The Earthworks. It is almost a relief to turn to tangible field-work once more. I may venture to tabulate the main types of the earthworks here. I have often opposed the confident statements of those who imagine they can determine the period and object of an earthwork by mere external inspection. Such theorizing (or rather allegation) is most dangerous to all sound archaeology; so we must try to avoid this great error. It is, perhaps, worse to take any fashionable theory in vogue outside Ireland, and apply it hastily to the antiquities of this country, playing the part of Procrustes in forcing facts to fit in it. In Ireland an error once in print in a journal can never be finally slain, for shallow beginners revive old'theories and identifications, without (1656 to 1678) denunciations from Dingwall Presbytery against cattle sacrifices at an ancient temple, " one god Mourie," and " Shony, a sea god," the last for a good seaweed crop (Pennant's "Tour in the Hebrides " ; Mitchell, '' The Past in the Present"; Squire, loc. cit., pp. 408, 412). " The Celtic Church in relation to Paganism" (W. J. Watson, Celt. Rev., x, p. 263.) 1 Elsewhere the Councils (of Aries, a.d. 452, Tours, 567, Nantes, 658, and Toledo, 681) fiercely forbade reverence of trees, stones, and wells, and punished those who prac tised it; cf. Olaf Tryggveson's crusade against paganism in the Heimskringla and the various acts of Charlemagne. 2 A trench for a church was marked " in the name of the Lord of the Elements" at the green of the Brugh for the first time in a.d. 499 (Rev.

I shall reserve the traditions relating to Knocklong and Dungrot, and confine myself to the earthworks near the first-named place, which complete the principal remains of the group from Kiifinnan to Kilmallock, Knockainey and Knocklong. I hope to deal later with the important remains of forts and mounds from Cromwell Hill to Dungrot. The first was the site of a Sid (though its god is, so far, undiscovered) in 1826. FitzGerald first noted "an inverted basin-like mound called Sighchann na Fionii" [Sidedn1 of the Fiana). The fine dolmen there has been already described, planned, and illustrated by Mr. P. J. Lynch and Dr. G. J. Fogerty. Forts.?I have to use this unsatisfactory term for ring-walls and ring mounds, often residential, sometimes sepulchral, and never military; but the usage implies no dogmatic theory in Ireland. (1) Ring-walls of earth and stone, with (or without) a fosse and outer ring. (2) The D-shaped fort. (3) ltoughly square forts. (4) The crescent fort, abutting on a scarp of cliff, like Dunganville. (5) Fortified spur, a mere variant of the last; e.g., one near Templenalaw. (6) The low platform fort, oval or round, with a fosse, and sometimes a ring. (7) The high mote, like Shanid Castle and Kiifinnan; the last with three rings and fosses, but no baily; the former with a Norman keep and baily. Baths.?The great ring-forts, like Dun Claire, Ballingaddy, and Ballinas caula, are evidently residential. So, probably, are most of the platform forts, with the vast majority of the lesser raths. The platform forts of Magh Adhair, in Co. Clare, and Cush and Ballinvreena, in Co. Limerick, may have been originally sepulchral, or at least ceremonial. The first was, however, " besieged " in a.d. 877. The lesser house-rings may date down to (or after) the Norman settlement. One rath made about 1240 in Co. Clare. The " square " are probably late; but some in Europe date from the Bronze Age, and the making by the god Nuada of an earthwork with corners is mentioned in the " Battle of Magh Leana.''2 Conjoined Rings.?These very interesting remains I hope to treat at some length hereafter. The occurrence of such at Knockainey, Clogher, Cooloughtragh (Temair Erann), and the 'Oenach, near Monasteranenagh, mark them as for ceremony, and perhaps for sepulture. They have counterparts. Two, of different periods, conjoin at Tara,3 and others occur at Uisnech, and 1 Limerick, i, p. 406. 2 Loc. cit., pp. 1-4. 3 The eastern, the so-called Teach Chormaic, I regard as the earlier, as the rings of the other join on to its perfect rings.

So far I note two varieties, one of several disc barrows (or else mounds of the Kathnarrow type), as at Cooloughtra (five rings), Knockainy (four), and Doonakenna, near Barna Hill (three). The others are very low platforms. In Co. Clare there are two types?ring-walls, or rings of earth and stone, like at Teernea and at Liscullaun, near Corofin station;1 or a ring and crescent-annexe (like at Clogher) as at Creevagh, Corbally, and Ayleacotty, near Quin, one at Moyfertagb church, and a marsh-fort at Lismehane,2 Co. Clare, and Ballinbeg, near Aghada, Co. Cork. Sepulchral Remains.?Irish literature is rich in side-lights on such monuments. First, there is the duma, a tumulus, an outlook, or the raised site of a house. We have an example in the twin tumuli at Clogher, which work probably resembles the "Two Breasts of the Morrigu," in the Great Cemetery of Brug.3 When going over the site of Tara with Professor Macalister, we found what exactly tallies in site and character with the Treduma Nesi. O'Donovan was right as to its nature.4 It was evidently three small mounds within an oval ring, partly terraced up; but the road has destroyed the middle mound. Such tumuli were probably (as in this case) connected with the gods. We read5 how duma mfcunds were made over nobles, leaca over heroes, fcarta over warriors. We find elsewhere6 how a fert of one door was for a man of science, one of two doors for a woman, and a mur, or ring-work, for those dying in a pestilence. When square or suitable stones were not to hand, square sods were used for the dartaire. The conjoined disc barrows at Cooloughtragh are evidently the joined tombs, traditionally, of Eithne and three other ladies, in the cemetery of the Ernai, ** side by side." Eithne was sister of MacNiad, and a daughter of Lugaid mac Daire, and was mother of Conaire by Mog Lama, and of Lugaid Laga by Mog Nuadat.7 Maer, who was buried near her, was a daughter of Ugaine's son F'ergus. The Knockainey rings were evidently connected with the gods 1 Dr. George U. MacNamara has made me a plan which, with my own plan of Ballinbeg, I hope to lay before the Academy in a future study. 2 A groom named Clancy, long ago, was told by an old labourer not to exercise horses on it for fear of ill luck. 3 For two mounds at Da Chich na Morrigain (The Paps in Kerry) see " Burning of Finn's House." 4 O.

A fine group of earthworks extends from Clogher through Knocklong, and down the valley of the Saimer, or Morningstar.- There are no traces of earthworks on the ridge of Knocklong, whose fifteenth-century castle of the Hurley's and the graveyard are so conspicuous from the railway from Dublin to Cork. It is the ancient Drom Damhgaire, the scene of the very mythical defeat, or rather flight, of King Cormac,3 about a.d. 230. I must study its legend hereafter, and only give a brief sketch of its history and traditions. The O'Hurleys built the castle late in the fifteenth century, after 1460. The records only begin in the reign of Elizabeth in the "Fiants" of 1568, 1570, and 1584, as Loinge and Knockneloinge. The Hurleys held it till Sir Maurice Hurley lost all in the civil war of 1641-51. His confiscated manor had " a ruyned castle, a mill, two fairs, and Courts Leet and Baron/' His lands extended from Dunmoone and Mitchellstown down to Startin (Scarteen) and Ballinalanga on the borders of Co. Tipperary. In 1853 it was said to take its name from long, a ship in which Hurley used to sail from it to Emly.- It is true that there was a lake at Emly in a.d. 896, named in Cormac's Glossary, and there are traces of several other lake-beds; but no 1 Skipra, xxxiv, p. 62. 2 Metr.

Windele found the old legend still remembered, how a " king of the Dandonians " and his army suffered from thirst, and his druid " shot a sleagh," and where it pierced the ground the well of Curraheen, on the north-west slope of the ridge (Slievereagh), broke out.1 Mr. Molony, of Hill House (to whose kindness and hospitality I am indebted), tells me that, when digging a fence above the quarry on the west slope, a layer of bones of men and horses was found. Here John Windele, in 1853, found " a limestone pillar, or dalldn, 4 feet high and 13 inches thick, on the edge of a precipice."2 Mr. Molony also tells me that long ago a cave was opened between the castle and the graveyard, and silver candlesticks were said to have been found, and long preserved by a Mr. Ryan. The railway cuts the group of forts in two. Unfortunately, Windele's untidy method of making notes on any loose bit of paper, and hardly ever writing out a full account while his memory wTas fresh, deprives his jottings of much of their value, and the Ordnance Survey Letters, as usual, ignore them altogether. I take them from the north, southward:?(1) The northern mote is 8 feet to 11 feet high, circular, flat, or slightly hollowed, on top, and 51 feet across. The sides are steep, especially towards the north, with hawthorns on the sheltered side to the south-east. The fosse is 12 feet wide and 2 feet to 4 feet deep, wet, and full of " flaggers " (yellow iris), with a trace of an outer ring, 10 feet wide and 2 feet high, to the south-east. This, I presume, is Windele's " Liss of Knocklong West," described as a mote " 20 feet high," with a deep fosse, 20 feet wide and 56 feet across the top, which is slightly hollowed. It lies beside a little rivulet, in wet fields, now drained. (2) In the same marsh, southward, is a curious platform fort and a ring-fort in Knocklong Townland. The first consists of two rectangular platforms, in line, north and south, 5 feet to 6 feet high and 66 feet wide, within a fosse 12 feet wide, now nearly filled; the two divisions had banks round the tops, and have a fosse 12 feet wide between. The northern is 70 feet long, much levelled to the north-west; the southern is 54 feet long. (3) At 63 feet to the south-west is a marsh fort, a ring, 66 feet inside; the rampart is 6 feet thick and high, the fosse 12 feet wide and only 2 feet to 3 feet deep, with an outer ring 3 feet high and 6 feet thick. It was nearly concealed in tall meadowsweet, loose 1 FiantsNos. 1765, 2472 ; Desmond Roll, 1584 ; Civil Survey, vol. xxv, p. 9 ; Windele's "Supplement," i, pp. 526-530 ; Sanas Chormaic, p. 93. 2Mss.

Windele describes it as "a mote 13 feet high, with a cave, in which a dog was lost." This opening is not to be seen, and though he places the mote near the oblong platform, he probably means the next mound. (4) The mote near the Elton road is 12 feet to 14 feet high ; it has a dry fosse 15 feet wide, and a sort of ledge, such as one finds in bell barrows, to the east, round the foot of the mound. The flat summit is from 64 feet to 66 feet across, the base about 90 feet. Many hawthorns grow on its side. There is no outer ring. A long circuit through the village brings us past (5), a low liss, a thicket of thorn-bushes, with a fosse and inner and outer rings, to the north of the railway, east from the station. We eventually reach a group with two good forts south from the line, from which they are well seen, with their noble background of mountains. Owing to the increased tillage (from the German submarine campaign), many fields round them were broken up ; I carefully, but vainly, looked for sites of hearths or objects of antiquarian interest, but saw none. (6) The fort nearest the railway is a perfect little oval mound, 11 feet to 12 feet high, 42 feet across north and south, by 30 feet east and west on the top. The fosse is 15 feet wide, 4 feet to 5 feet deep, and partly wet, with no outer ring. (7) Another fort, which I failed to find, and could not see from the railway. (8) The most southern, and finest, mote, near the road from Knocklong ridge to Aghadoon, is on the summit of the plateau; it has a beautiful outlook to the Galtees and Slievereagh. It is a very perfect mote, 13 feet to 15 feet high over the fosse, 40 feet to 45 feet across the top, and 70 feet at the base, with steep sides, and thick hawthorns growing on it to the south-east. The fosse is 16 feet wide in the bottom, and over 6 feet deep, being still wet.1 The fact that so many raised flat-topped forts remain where no cattle is recorded is noteworthy, there being, as we see, four at Knocklong, and nine near it at Atheneasy, Aghadoon, Ballinvreena, Cush, Raheenawadra, Ballinscaula, Bulgadin, Glenbrohaun, and Rathtany.2 None of these occur in the sanctuary cemeteries of Oenach Clochair and Knock ainey, though the third and fourth are near Cush. This seems to imply that they are not necessarily either burial tumuli or feudal castles, for what need of four in one townland ? and the number precludes the idea of their being inauguration mounds, like their congener at Magh Adhair. I can only draw the conclusion (so strenuously denied) that such flat-topped forts (and the remark applies to Pallas, and to those in Co. Clare, Lisnagry, Lugadoon, Killilagh, Moyarta, Lisnaleagaun, and Kiltinnaun) are Irish residential " forts." The bearing of this on Shanid rath is also very clear. 1 Plans of Nos. 2 and 3, and sections of 4 and 8, are given, Plate VI. 2 Ratheany in Inq. post mort. of Tho. de Clare, 1287 ; Rathtany in Memoranda Roll Exchequer 1317, m 82, as to succession of his son Richard.

S. 40).?The Saimer, to judge from its old channel, was once a goodly stream, and if it be the Saimer of a list of the chief rivers of Ireland, got more than its share of recognition. Now, the great rain-collecting forests being long felled, it, like the Cammoge, has dwindled to a brook. It divided the Ui Fidgeinte from the Arada before the Dal Cais intruded. The ford Aghadoon (Athnaduin), also called " Doon Ford," is marked by the old road from Knocklong. to Kilmallock on either bank. It is evidently the Athdunbari,1 named, along with Laythyralaw (or Templenalaw, on Slievereagh) and Garthagriffin (Ballingarry in Coshlea), and was named from the Barrys. It is most probably the ford at the earth work of Raithin an Imaraigh9 " the little fort of the contest," where, in the " Battle of Knocklong," Colga, King Cormac's chief druid, was slain by the superior magic of King Fiacha's druids, who turned his " handstone " into an eel or serpent,3 for the ford lay west from Knocklong and had a little rath near it. The utterly mythical nature of some Irish Sagas never affects their accuracy in topography. The Doon is a low mote in Knocktorin ;3 a shapely mound, carpeted with ferns, violets, and primroses, and planted with sycamore and beech. Through these trees it has beautiful views of Slievereagh to the south, and a glimpse to the north of Thountinna, over Loch Derg. The mound is well seen from the train, between Knocklong and Kilmallock, to the south. It is 16 feet to 18 feet high, the top girt by a low ring, 8 feet to 10 feet thick, and rarely 3 feet high. The platform inside this measures 60 feet across, or 123 feet at the base. There are traces of a fosse, but too defaced to be measured.4 The old road runs from it to the ford, westward down the slope. Atheneasy (0. S. 40).?Like Aghadoon, the next ford down the stream to the north of the railway has got a high fort near it, but on the other bank. The name Ath iia nDeisi refers to a tribe, the Dels, denizens of the Tara district of Bregia in Meath, who are said to have fled for refuge to Oilioll Aulom in the late second century. Under his segis, one section settled in the present baronies of Decies in Co. Waterford, the other in Deisbeg, or Small County, in Co. Limerick. It is called Athenysy in a papal letter of 1260. In 1335, Elizabeth Milton, widow of Walter de Bermingham, had owned Athnedess. The church of Aghnedesse was robbed by John Staloun ; 1 Plea Roll, No. 22 of xxv, Edw.

It, like the Doon, lies not far from the village of Elton. This name is supposed to be very modern, but it is found as " Elltown, the pro perty of Sir Edward Fitton," in 1586 ; two years later, James Fox of Elton claimed the land which Fitton held as patentee. Moriertagh O'Grady (I presume as Fitton's tenant) held Elltown in 1610, and it is mentioned very frequently in the Civil Survey in 1655. The mote is from 18 feet to 20 feet high, surrounded by a fosse 18 feet wide, and rarely over a yard deep, with a stream running into it to the south-west* The mound is 51 feet to 54 feet across the platform, and 104 feet at the base; it is well preserved and the sides are steep, but it is overgrown with hawthorns to the east. Ballinascaula (O. S. 40).?Of a different and more interesting type is the mote of Ballinascaula. On a lesser scale of height and massiveness, it still resembles Kiifinnan in having a raised mound girt by three rings. It lies in a marsh, not far to the n6rth of the railway, and between Bulgadin and Atheneasy. It is locally supposed to mean " fort of the heroes," or " fort of the clouds," being on the map " Ballinscaula," but locally " Ballinascaula."3 Like its neighbours, none of its early records remain. In 1583, Gerald mac Thomas, alias "Tonboy Beagh," a Geraldine, held Glenlarhy, Ballin wryny (Glenlara and Ballinvreena on Slievereagh), and Ballinskaly. It was granted, May 14th, 1588, to Richard and Alexander Fitton as part of their demesne, " Phitton's fortune," long forgotten, along with it, the above lands, Coch (Cush) and Ballenvistellane down, or Mitchellstowndown; the grantors were pledged to erect houses for twenty-three English families; Mahone mac Teige held Ballynscholly under Sir Edward Fitton. The Civil Survey, 1655, gives " Ballinscala, half a townland, mearing on the north with Gormanstown, and with Bulligidyn-Eady to the west and north-east."3 No tradition seems to attach to the forts; Mr. Thomas Bennett, of Summerville House (the owner), tells me that there were traces of other small forts round it, but they were levelled at various times in farming the place. 1 Cal.

The fort1 is a large earthwork in a very marshy field which, before the great drains were dug, must have been a shallow lake in wet weather. It has a low mote in the centre, girt by a ring of level field, fenced by a ring mound and two fosses and mounds, fairly concentric, and measuring 280 feet over all. There seem to be traces of a causeway through the marsh to the east, but there are no entrance-gaps to that side. The rings are usually from 12 feet to 15 feet thick, and 2 to 4 feet high; they were probably palisaded, as in one of the Ancient Laws, which describes an earthwork on a headland?" a ditch on one side and a ditch on the other makes a full fence; the (cladh) mound, 6 hands (3 feet) high; the palisade, 6 hands also "*?no very lofty defence. The fosses are as wide as the rings and are literally filled up with lush marsh vegetation, rushes, peppermint, and such water-loving plants. The interspace round the mound is from 42 feet to 45 feet wide. The mote is from 6 feet to 7 feet high, 60 feet to 62 feet across the summit, 87 feet to 90 feet diameter at the base ; it has no apparent house sites. The southern gangway is 15 feet wide. There is a " satellite fort" to the south-east, about 66 feet from the entrance. Such are not uncommon; I need only recall Rathadrinna and Lismortagh in Co. Tipperary, where the little fort nearly touches the outer ring. The " satellite" is well preserved; its fosse is 3 feet to 4 feet deep and 12 feet to 14 feet wide, with no trace of the outer ring. The inner bank is 15 feet thick, 5 feet high outside, and 1 foot over the oval garth, which is 60 feet across north and south, and 54 feet east and west. It has a nearly levelled annexe to the west, 18 yards across, and defined by a shallow hollow; the west corners are rounded off. I may incidentally note that a spell of very broken weather (culminating in heavy rain for a whole day and night) rendered my exploration of these forts and their surroundings very difficult, and even necessitated wading. In this manner I was altogether prevented from making a close examination or any measurements of a somewhat similar marsh fort, called Ballinastona, some miles away, near Summerville House, beside the main road from Kilmal lock to Bruff and to the west of the same. Judging from the large scale maps, it measures about 300 feet across. It has a low mound like a disc barrow, perhaps about 5 feet high and 40 feet at the base. The map shows a ring about 160 feet across, a mound and shallow fosse. The rings seem to be only about a yard high, but I could not cross the quagmire and deep drains around it, flooded into a shallow lake. There are several other marsh forts round Kilmallock, mostly small; the largest to the south-west of the town is 1 Plate VI. * hoc. eit9 iv, p. 139.</page><page sequence="53">Westropp?The Earthworks, fyc, of S.

It measures about 330 feet across the inner ring, anc^ 430 feet across the outer ring, there being a rather wide interspace about 30 feet wide between the mounds. Temair Erann When I recognized the importance of the remains in the cemetery of Cush, and subsequently found its description in Maccraith's poem,1 about A.D. 990, I was struck at once by its rich mythical suggestion, and the lack of mention of the cemetery in other sources. As in the case of 'Oenach Chuli, I could not for the moment free myself from the prejudice of old identifications till a passage most familiar to me seemed to give a new light which made it evident that here, and not near Castle Island,3 lay the chief cemetery of the Ernai Temair Erann. Let me restate the case. If Cush be the constituent of Coshlea," Foot of the Hill," and Cossetlereogh or Cosse Clerough, Coss of Cleire, in 1580,3 the Irish must have recognized the cemetery as a suitable place to give its name to the district called Fontymchyll by the English. Maccraith shows that, in the reign of King Brian, every outstanding person of the Ernai, save Curoi, was reputed to have a grave on Cenn Febrat, at Cush. There were said to rest Febra, the brother, and Gar ban, the son of Deda, the eponymus of the Clann Dedad Ernai; Lugaid Laegde, another eponymus of the Corca Laegde; the wife of Daire, father of Curoi; the famous Dodera; Ere from Ir Luachair; C&amp;in, son of Derg, who, like Febra, gave his name to one of the hill-heads up the slope; and Eithne, daughter of Lugaid, the son of Daire and sister of Mac Niad.4 All the mythic valour and beauty of the tribe lay there, "each in his own house." Now, the Tract on the Cemeteries says:?" The Clann Dedat, i.e. the race of Conaire and the Ernai (were buried) at Temair Erann; the men of Munster, i.e. the Dergthene at 'Oenach Culi"; it only names 1 Metr. Dind S., x, p. 227, supra, xxxiii, p. 460. 2 So far as I can find, the identification was made first by Curry from the Down Survey, " Sliabh Luachra is laid down . . . south-west of Castle Island " (note "Magh Leana," p. 164), with no further definition, while O'Donovan brought in the Bealahantowragh equation. On this deduction from a single map (despite all other evidence) came the error of placing all the Munster Taras near Castle Island.

Only one other great burial place is named, also in Leinster, 'Oenach Colmain.1 The outstanding cemetery of Cenn Febrat, with a fair still held at its foot, in Ballinvreena (usually a sure mark of old importance), can only be Temair Erann. It is well known that 0'Donovan's only reason for putting Temair Luachra near Castle Island was the name " Bealahontowragh"; this place contradicts (as I have shown) all the indications in the Mesca Ulad,2 our only clear authority, while the further equation, that Temair Erann, Temair Luachra, and Temair Shuba are the same,3 has not a line or a fact to show in its favour so far as we know. The old-school antiquaries fancied that Luachra lay exclusively in Kerry, never realizing its extension, at least to Cenn Febrat,4 near the fort of Crimthann Nia Nair, and over Muskerry Barony in Cork, and up to Loch Derg. O'Donovan's unhappy obsession that he could date a dolmen by identifying Duntrileague Hill with Sliab Claire5 against the clear topography of the Agallamh and other sources, poisoned the whole central Munster topography, and so long as modern students follow blindly his far from infallible authority no sound result can be attained. The name Temair, if it implies a "wide outlook,"6 is most suitable to Cush, and accounts for the author of the Agallamh bringing St. Patrick to sit on the three mounds of the Tuatha De, there to watch the great hunt.7 To summarize?Cen Febrat had for its king Sedna Sithbaicc, " King of Claire," one of the " fathers " of the god Nuada (b.c 909); the forts in Emlygrennan at its foot were made by Art Imlech ("b.c. 1019"); Crimthann, lover of the 1 Cited by Petrie, "Round Towers," p. 101. The Christian writers long spoke freely about these sanctuaries even in religious works. Dathi consulted the druids on Samhain Eve, 422, at Rath Archaill, where they had idols and altars (Encyc. Relig., vii, p. 128; Manuscript Mat., p. 284); Tara was "the chief abode of idolatry and wizardry," (Tripart. Life, p. 41) ; people worshipped idols and abominations (Confessio S. Patricii) ; idols fall on their faces in Munster (Tripart. Life, p. 195), and idols and images are destroyed (ibid., p. 259), like Crom Cruaich. 2 W. M. Hennessy's note, Introd., p. iv ; cf. Proc.

I),1 and the Ernai, in the time of Deda (" B.C. 130 "), their great cemetery, Temair Erann, whose three tumuli were dedicated to the Tuatha De Danann. These disjointed tales show how large it loomed as a holy hill in the sight and belief of the peoples of the plain. APPENDIX. Temair Luachra. O'Donovan and O'Curry identify Temair Erann with Temair Luachra and Temair Shuba.2 They give no authority for the dictum, which, so far as I can find, is (as so often) a mere guess. There is (as I have pointed out) some mistake in the Mesca Ulad. The raiders pass through the (M)Airtine, into Smertaine, with Loch Gur on their right, across the pool stream of Maig, to Cliu, into Deise beg. They come to 'Aine Cliach, then to 'Oenach Clochair, on by the road to Temair Luchra. The Cammoge, rather than the Maigue, must be intended. Temair Luachra was on the east slope of the hills of Luachair, at least twenty miles beyond the Maigue, and over thirty miles from 'Oenach Clochair. As we have seen, the cemetery of Cush is the chief cemetery of the Ernai and Clann Dedad; it is therefore Temair Erann, and so cannot be the other place. I know of no mention of Temair Shuba but the incidental inclusion among the forts claimed by the King of Cashel, which favours its identity with the once predominant Temair Luachra. We find another curious tradition of the great importance of the latter in the same book. The High King of Ireland, from the royal namesake Bregian Tara, had to send a cauldron to the King of Cashel, at Temair Luachra. It had ceased to be chief centre of Munster in a prehistoric past, but the fact was not forgotten. The King of Cashel indeed was expected to go to it with twenty chariots, thirty vats of liquor, and food in proportion, " to eat the Feast of the Ernai," and stay there for a week. As to my attempts to fix its site,3 the last were partly based on O'Donovan's identification of 'Oenach Clochair with Monasteranenagh, not with Clogher, This suggested that the route in the Mesca Ulad lay to the north and not to the south of Knockfirina, as is evidently intended. This, however, does not necessarily preclude the possibility of Dunganville fort being Curoi's fort; but 1 The silver bow of Crimthann was carried by the Uladh, after the sack of Temair Luachra, to Cenn Febrat, and they wrecked the Cathair and slew the king (Rennes Dind S., xvi, pp. 73, 78). Was it Dun Claire ? For other allusions to Crimthann (other than those connected with Howth), see Mesca Ulad, p. 53 ; Keating, ii, pp. 232-6, 242, and i, p. 44. 2 Book of Rights, p. 225. 3 Supra, xxvi, p. 62, and xxxiii, p. 26,</page><page sequence="56">182 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. I must confess that no decisive argument can be made save against the old identification with the site near Castle Island. It is strange that the name should have died out where so many of the other Ernean names survive. One more point may be noted The Elizabethan armies frequently followed the same routes. Now Pelham, in March, 1580* passed from Glin to " Dowau," near Portrinard, and thence (say the Four Masters) to Temair Luachra. On July 18th, 1600, Carew rested " upon the midst of the mountains of Slewloghor, at a place called Ballinture, twelve miles from Askeaton/' and five from Glin, i.e. somewhere near Athea.1 As we noted, there is a Tooradoo between that place and Portrinard. In Co. Limerick Teamhair might be expected to become Tawer or Tower, for Tower Hill, in eastern Limerick, was " Teauragh " and " Tearaffe," in 1655 in the Civil Survey, and in 1666 in the Act of Settlement. If the Mesca Ulad be right, the fort was on the slope of east Luachair, overlooking the plain and facing the rising sun. Much has yet to be done, as the indications so far give no fixed result, but perhaps hereafter some hitherto unknown document may set the question at rest. I lay this paper before the Academy in the hope that the encouraging results, attainable by combining careful field-survey with the study of early legends and literature, may lead other workers to extend to other districts the work of scientific identification of the sanctuaries and cemeteries. Venerated by the pagan Irish before Christianity rooted itself in our island, and by their descendants (down to, and sometimes even after, the Normans had settled on the rich plains of southern Ireland), there may be much to guide us on our search. It rests with us, living in an age of destruction of our ancient land marks and of the dying out of early traditions and place-names, to save the ancient topography of Ireland for future generations. Note added in Press. 'Oenach Culi (supra, vol. xxxiv, p. 63). Objection has been made to my identifying 'Oenach Culi with 'Oenach Clochair, on the grounds that they are named separately in the " Tract on the Cemeteries " (Senchas na relec) and the Charter to Monasteranenagh, 1186.2 The older text of the Tract, in the Leabar na hUidre, does not name '0. Clochair. It gives eight cemeteries, '0. Culi being sixth. The later text 1 Cal. State Papers, Ireland, 1580, p. 236, 1600, p. 317. 2 Petrie, "Round Towers," p. 97, and note,.p. 99. Cal.

Eamhna,1 and adds Martra muinter Finntain, evidently a Christian cemetery. It nowhere asserts that A. Clochair and A. Culi are different. In the charter " Enachculi in Corbali" and Cloghur (not Enach Cloghur) are named apart; the last is probably Clogher, near Dromin, which has only a small defaced earthwork and a liss. The "Agallamh na Senorach,"2 a high authority for topography, with especially minute knowledge of this district, identifies the names, placing between Cullen and Ardpatrick " 'Oenach Culi mna Nechtain, now called . . . 'Oenach sen Clochair." Its allusion to Nechtan, who appears in independent poems at the neighbouring Knockainey and in the Dalcassian pedigree, shows local knowledge in legend as minute as in that of the topography round Cenn Febrat (Slievereagh). The Mesca Ulad? places '0. sen Clochair between Knockainey and Slievereagh. Lastly, Corbally adjoins the townlands in which the group of earthworks are found near Clogherbeg and Clogher Hill. The remains are similar to those at the other great 'Oenach cemeteries?Tara, Br ugh, Slievereagh (Temair Erann)Kand 'Oenach cairbre at Monasteranenagh. It is most improbable that the Dergthene had two cemeteries in that small well-defined area. In face of this cumulative argument I see no reason to revise my former statement for what is evidently a late marginal note inserted out of place in the later text. 1 " Aonach Macha " at Emania (Ann.
