Chap man &amp; Hall and Methuen, New York. x + 206 pp. Price: $55.00 cloth; $23.00 paper. There are approximately 1,200 living species of ants, and the variation and com plexity of their social organization is unique in the animal world. Ant colonies are characterized as eusocial, because they have overlapping adult generations, cooper ative brood care, and sterile worker castes. According to the authors, this small volume primarily concerns two related issues: (1) how eusociality has evolved under the influence of natural selection; and (2) why it is found only in termites, ants, and some species of bees and wasps. Although, the authors succeed in their mission, it is somewhat misleading. For in addition to providing a theoretical discussion on the evolution of social behavior in insects, the book provides an excellent up-date on the behavior and ecology of a wide variety of ant species. After an introductory chapter on kin selection and its influence on the number of queens in ant colonies, the authors provide a brief review (Chapter 2) of ant phylogeny. This is not so much a systematic treatment as it is a discussion of the major ecological and behavioral differences among the approximately 12 ant subfamilies. Chapters 3 and 4 are a bit more esoteric, dealing with "economics" and caste structure. The former topic considers issues such as the time-course of colony growth and reproduction, while the latter focuses on division of labor among individuals differing in morphology or age. Age-related jobs are called temporal polyethism, the best example being that young individuals typically stay in the nest and tend the brood, while foragers are almost always the oldest workers.</page><page sequence="2">252 JOURNAL OF THE NEW YORK ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY Vol. 96(2) The next three chapters include a heavy (and refreshing) dose of ant natural history. Thus Chapter 5 reviews the recent literature on the mechanisms of communication among ants, including the pheromonal basis for nest recognition, alarm behavior, recruitment to food, and mating. Chapters 6 and 7 are complementary, and consider how communicatory processes are used by ants to interact with other organisms. These topics range from ant-plant associations on the one hand, to parasitic rela tionships that ants have with closely related species. The section on slave-making behavior is particularly noteworthy for its inclusion of some very recent research on the ontogeny and evolution of social parasitism. This small volume doesn't pretend to include every aspect of ant ecology and behavior, but what is does cover, it covers well. Perhaps my biggest complaint is with the all too frequent use of anthropomorphic ecological metaphors. For example, j ust about everything the ants do for a living is called a "strategy." The term "strategy" has clearly become the ecologist's equivalent of the ethologist's concept of "instinct." It is a vacuous term which is applied to everything, but which explains nothing. My second-place vote goes to the term "resource." And exactly what is a resource? Not simply food, water, or nesting material. According to Sudd and Franks, even infor mation is a (non-tangible) resource. Thus the beginning student is left with the notion that ants (as well as every other living organism) have evolved a wide variety of strategies to conserve resources. Profound, it's not! Finally, the cover of the book proclaims that The Behavioural Ecology Of Ants is a "Tertiary Level Biology" text. Translation: it is written for advanced undergrad uates, postgraduates, and researchers in entomology, ecology, and animal behavior. But thanks to the lucid treatment by the authors, most of this book is not technical, and will be of interest to anyone fascinated by the diversity of social organization in the ant world. -Howard Topoff7 Department ofPsychology, Hunter College of CUNY, New York, New York 10021. Announcement: A special field course on insects of the Maine coast will be taught from June 26-July 2 at Eagle Hill Wildlife Research Station, located 35 miles east of Bar Harbor. The course will be taught by Richard Dearborn, senior entomologist of the State of Maine. The course is on a research participation basis (tax deductible). The station is beautifully located on a 235 foot high hill at the edge of the ocean.
