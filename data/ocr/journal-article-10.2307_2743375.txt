<plain_text><page sequence="1">Our Readers Write One would have thought that as we prepare to enter the final decade of the 2oth century the major interna- tional journal of anthropology would have dispensed with the anachronism "sciences of man" and adopted the far more accurate and fitting "sciences of human- kind" or "sciences of the human species." We assure even beginning students that anthropology is the study of the whole species, not half of it. My Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary (i986) provides this definition: "i: the science of human beings; esp: the study of human beings in relation to distribution, ori- gin, classification, and relationship of races, physical character, environmental and social relations, and cul- ture." It consistently uses the term "human being," not "man," in defining such related words as "an- thropic," "anthropocentric," "anthropography," "an- thropoid," "anthropometry," "anthropomorphic," and so on. Why, then, should CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY cling to a term that is so gendercentric, especially as our field increasingly is composed of women as well as men?
