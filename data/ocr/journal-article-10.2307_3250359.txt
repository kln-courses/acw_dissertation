<plain_text><page sequence="1">a comparatively large number has not yet been dealt with. Bergman devotes this beautifully illustrated mon- ograph to them. The bigger finds chiefly consist in carved wooden beams and other wooden carvings found in the ruins of a small Buddhist temple. Some of them represent human beings, whereas others are of a merely ornamental character. They belong, of course, to the art of Gandhara, but some show a marked Iranian influence. They are the oldest hither- to known remains of Buddhist art from this part of Central Asia. The smaller finds seem to go back to different periods. Some of them may belong to the stone age, such as the microlithic objects resembling those found near Lake Lopnor and in Ordos. Several stone axes closely resemble those discovered by An- dersson at Sha-kuo-t'un in Fengt'ien and may there- fore belong to the Neolithic age. The remains of pottery discovered are of doubtful date, but possibly only go back to the time of the Chinese invasion. As kilns have been discovered, they seem to have been fabricated by Chinese settlers. The coins and metal objects have already been described by Conrady, but Bergman gives a number of valuable additions and supplementary remarks referring to similar finds from different regions made during the last years, which may help to ascertain the provenance and use of the objects found and to get a closer knowledge of the flourishing trade on the silk roads of Central Asia during the early Middle ages. 5) G. Montell, Sven Hedin's Archaeological Collection from Khotan. pp. I45 -2 I. In 1896, Sven Hedin discovered near Khotan two early mediaeval sites, Yotkan and Dandan-Uiliq, which among other antiquities yielded a large number of terra-cotta sculptures, of which only a few have been published. Montell devotes a systematic study to them, illustrated by numerous reproductions, and quotes the entire literature which may give help to- wards explaining them. As no systematic excavations have been made, but the whole material is due to accidental discoveries, only provisional opinions as to the date, the meaning and the cultural connections of the finds can be given. The descriptions are very detailed and conscientious, and nothing which may help to elucidate the antiquities has been neglected. The numerous figures of human and animal shape are of special interest. Among the latter, the large number of monkeys represented in every imaginable posture is conspicuous. Perhaps some of them may have been intended as caricatures of human beings, but of others, especially the erotic representations, the author, though with great reserve, thinks it possible that they may have served as amulets against evil influences in the same manner as similar subjects are used in North China and among many other nations. The Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities Stockholm, Bulletin Nr. 8. Stockholm, 1936. S81 pp. This volume has been entirely written by Karlgren and contains two most important contributions to- wards the elucidation of ancient Chinese civilization. The first essay, which has also been published in the separate volume mentioned above, has been reviewed by Professor Fischer, 1. c. pp. 145146. So only some additions to this review which represents an archaeo- logist's opinion will here be given from a philologist's point of view. i) B. Karlgren, Yin and Chou in Chinese Bronzes. pp. 9- 54. Starting from the assumption that the views express- ed by Chinese archaeologists on the age of bronzes generally attributed to the Yin or Chou times are, as a rule, correct - as has been amply proved by the results of the last excavations at Ngan-yang- Karlgren compares the inscriptions of those bronzes and shows that three peculiarities, the so-called car- 240</page><page sequence="2">touche ya q, on which he has given his opinion in vol. 2 of the Bulletin, pp. 32 a. f. (comp. also my remarks in vol. 3, p. 66) and two other expressions, the meaning of which is not yet clear, only occur on bronzes that are generally regarded as Yin and whose inscriptions contain nothing which points to Chou origin, but never on such as bear allusions to the Chou kings or to territorial rulers. So these pe- culiarities may be regarded as criteria for determin- ing Yin bronzes. With their help, about 45 0-500 vessels can be fixed as Yin'. Having thus secured a base for dating the bronzes, K. examines their style and shows that a large number of ornamental designs only occurs on Yin bronzes and on such Chou bronzes as are shown by their inscriptions to belong to the reigns of the first Chou kings, though some slight di- vergencies between the pure Yin and the so-called Yin-Chou style appear. But those Chou bronzes which belong to the time between B. C. 95o (following the so-called official chronology) and that of the Eastern Chou (about B. C. 770) show an entirely different and much simpler style as well as some entirely new forms of vessels. This so-called Middle Chou style is soon replaced by the Huai style2 which rejects most of the ornaments peculiar to the Middle Chou style and resumes the Yin motives of decoration, but keeps the new types of vessels characteristic of Middle Chou. In those regions of Eastern China where the Shang civilization continued to flourish, especially in Sung, no traces of the Middle Chou style have come to light. Here the Huai style seems to have developed directly out of the Yin style. 1 Some doubts against Karlgren's method were raised by Herrlee Glessner Creel in J. R. A. S. 1936, 463 a. f., but K. could easily refute them in J. R. A. S. 1937, 33/39. 2 K. emphasizes the sometimes forgotten fact that this style is only called thus because the first finds showing it were made in the Huai valley, not because it is supposed to have originated there. Thus a solid base for the dating and attributing of bronzes is gained, and the correctness of the tradi- tional Chinese ascriptions proved.l The study raises of course a large number of questions, chiefly as to the reasons of the stylistic development and the suc- cessive changes. K. himself gives some hints to prob- lems which present themselves. Thus he supposes on p. 146 that the Middle Chou style may have been the result of China's extension into the Yang-tse regions- then the Middle Chou style would probably be due to Ch'u influence. As the bronze vessels had a religious character, the question also arises whether the changes of style may have had something to do with the development of religion? K. points for in- stance on p. 144 to a fundamental difference between Yin and Middle Chou which shows itself in the con- spicuous reduction of animal motives in the latter style. Could this be explained as a consequence of the reduction of theriomorphic divinities in favour of anthropomorphic ones, or rather, of a transition from the theriomorphic to the anthropomorphic con- ception of divinities? Again it is shown on p. 149 that the Huai style has rejected the decorations of Middle Chou but retained the types of vessels de- veloped during the same period. Might we interpret this phenomenon as a sort of renaissance of the mythology of Yin - evidently the chief source of decoration motives - which perhaps came again to the front when its suppressed adherents rose again with the decay of the Chou feudalism, whereas at the same time the sacred rites of the Chou, in which the new vessels were used, continued to be observ- ed? These are only a few of the many questions which are raised by Karlgren's fundamental investi- gations. 1 On p. 137, note I, K. gives some instructive examples o the fallaciousness of datings which neglect the well-established Chinese tradition. 241</page><page sequence="3">Hardly less important is the following essay: 2) B. Karlgren, On the Script of the Chou Dynasty. pp. 357-178. Our knowledge of the structural evolution of Chinese writing is sadly hampered by the undeniable fact that only a very small part of the characters which must have been in use from the earliest times has been directly transmitted. For the oracle bones of the Yin time as well as the Yin and Chou bronzes only show a limited vocabulary, as the questions put to the oracle as well as the contents of the in- scriptions necessarily repeat themselves again and again. Also a very large number of characters has hitherto remained unidentified. As writing was extensively practised during these times, many thousands of cha- racters must obviously have existed which are not found on such materials as have reached us. Now the question is, were the characters not transmitted composed in the same way as their later equivalents which we know since the Chin and Han times, or were they generally constructed in a different way? This, as K. puts it on p. 160, is a fundamental prob- lem, as important for the history of palaeography as for the question of the transmission of ancient literature in general. As to the purely pictorial cha- racters, they can for a large part be traced on the bones and bronzes, and thereby it is shown that hard- ly any alterations have occurred, though many mis- interpretations of old and indistinguishable characters have taken place. But in the case of the so-called hsie-sheng, the characters composed of a "radical" and a "phonogram", the question is not so easily answered. As K. puts it on p. 162, it amounts to this: Were the phonograms of the Chou time the same as those chosen in the Han time, and did the additional ra- dicals already form part of the written forms of antiquity, or are they later additions? K. answers these questions by means of his investigations into the pho- nology of the Shi-ching. He is able to show that by comparing the rime system of the Shi to the phonograms occurring in the rime characters it is proven that they cannot have been replaced by others but have remained the same since they were written. Therefore the same phonograms must have been in use about B. C. 800, when the larger part of the odes was composed. By comparing the readings of Shi words not found as rimes with their pronunci- ation as given in the Sui dictionaries, he again de- monstrates that the same holds good for these. So the phonograms were not chosen after the language had altered, but go back to a time when the pho- nology of the Shi was still in actual use. Therefore the phonograms occurring in the present Shi are the same which were used in the Chou time, which means that the so-called phonetical parts of the cha- racters have undergone no changes but essentially re- mained the same from the first until now. I am not so sure of the thesis laid down on p. 175 that the language of the Chou time was that of Royal Chou, nor that the capital of the Chou was the "religious, ritual and cultural centre" of China. I think it far morc probable that the centre of Chi- nese civilization had remained in the old domains of the Shang in the East, and that the scholars work- ing in the capital to whom most of the inscriptions are probably due were mostly men of Shang who used their own dialect. The facts that the whole of Chou civilization rests on Shang foundations and that nearly all the famous scholars of antiquity were men of Eastern China seem distinctly to point in this direction. So it is probably the language of Shang and not that of Chou which is chiefly transmitted in ancient literature, and this again coincides with the fact pointed out by Conrady that the words found in the oldest literary sources are mostly such as are indicated by the Fang-yen to belong to dialects of 242</page><page sequence="4">Eastern China. But all this does not invalidate Karl- gren's statement that the language of the inscriptions seems to be fairly uniform, and that therefore the doubts which might be raised against the assumption of a comparatively uniform pronunciation during the earlier Chou time are not very important. As to the question if the radicals from the first belonged to the characters, K. answers it in the affirmative, simply because so-called chia-chie phonograms used in a sense different from their original meaning would have been unintelligible without distinguishing radicals, if used in the large number we already find in early Chou literature. Against this answer, K. himself raises the objection that on the oracle bones and in the inscriptions quite a number of chia-chie occurs in which the distinguish- ing radicals are missing. He meets this by answer- ing that such chia-chie might have been used as long as their number was small, but that this would have become impossible as soon as it was enlarged, i. e. with the development of a real literature under the Chou. This answer does not seem to me altogether satisfactory. For a real and probably very extensive literature already existed under the Yin (comp. Creel, The Birth of China, pp. 171/73). Then, regarding the nature of the Chinese language, mere phonetic writ- ing must always have been more or less unintelli- gible, and therefore it is highly improbable that it was ever tried. Therefore I think that the explana- tion of the occurrence of so-called phonograms with- out explanatory radicals in ancient writing is to be looked for in another direction: the phonograms were not mere indications of the sound of a word, but had a pictorial value in themselves, so that one cha- racter was interpreted in different ways, and several ideas seen in the same picture. So for instance the character i ch'iu given by K. as an example of a chia-chie, the picture of a fur-coat, appears on oracle bones and in early inscriptions in forms like I (see Ku-chou-p'ien 67, 29ga3ib), which look far more like a hand grasping a tail. Therefore it must have been very easy to associate with it another meaning like "to get, to want, to seek, to pray". Of course, con- fusion would nevertheless have been inevitable if this manner of interpreting one character in different ways had been largely indulged in, and therefore the radicals or rather determinants were probably used as early as confusion became visible. That the so- called chia-chie are comparatively often met with on bones and bronzes, is probably to be explained from the religious character of these writings. For the gods are generally supposed not to like innovations, and therefore the oldest modes of writing were pro- bably faithfully adhered to when the writing was in- tended to be read by the spirits. K. gives on p. Ioo a similar explanation of the phenomenon. The thanks to Karlgren which Gunnar Andersson expresses in the preface will certainly be shared by every reader of the volume, the value and import- ance of which can hardly be overrated.
