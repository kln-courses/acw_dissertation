<plain_text><page sequence="1">Real Presence: The Numina in Italian American Poetry Anthony Lioi The Juilliard School In an influential essay, Dana Gioia asserts: "The full range and quality of Italian-American poetry . . . remains inadequately understood" in any critical environment (n. pag.). With few exceptions, environmental liter ary criticism has remained indifferent to white ethnic literature, in part, I suspect, because nature writing and the literature of environmental crisis is thoroughly Anglo-American; thus, when ecocritics enter multicultural discourse, "white" tends to mean "Anglo." Italian American poetry has been lost at the margins of whiteness. This is not surprising because, as scholarship in Whiteness Studies has shown, many of the peoples now considered "white ethnics"?Ashkenazi Jews, southern Italians, the Irish?were not entirely white when they arrived in the United States dur ing the great migrations that ended in 1924.1 The assimilation of these groups into middle-class whiteness after World War II?the creation of "dark white" ethnicities?has occluded the difference between immigrants and groups present during the continental phase of nation-building.2 For American Indians, African Americans, Chicanos, and Anglo-Americans, the creation of the American nation was a shared, if agonistic, experience. The dramas of Emancipation, the Indian Wars, and the annexation of the Southwest coincide with the creation of "nature's nation" in the narrative of Manifest Destiny, the new multicultural history, and the environmental ist narratives of industrial devastation and conservationist repentance.3 For immigrants whose influx peaked in the early-twentieth century, however, the question of participation in these racialized histories of nature remains open. Can the narratives, plots, tropes, and aesthetic principles that drive the literature of these earlier groups account for the post-immigrant rela tionship to American environments? What new forms of cultural poiesis have been fashioned by the environment of diaspora, by the interchange between old and new immigrant worlds? In this essay, I will begin to answer these questions relative to Italian American poetry by considering the work of John Ciardi and Diane di Prima. If, as Josephine Gattuso Hendin asserts, "[e]thnic heritage is his tory in action" and "it subjects the fact of immigration to a scrutiny of its MELUS, Volume 34, Number 2 (Summer 2009)</page><page sequence="2">142 LIOI ongoing effects" (13), it makes sense to ask what difference that heritage has made to poets who encountered the United States as a diasporic envi ronment. To put it another way, we can scrutinize the ongoing effects of Italian heritage on American poets in their encounter with the presence, or presences, of the nonhuman world. From such an angle, we discover a striking dynamic in Ciardi's and di Prima's poetry: an encounter with the numina?"divine powers"?the spirits of place, that founds a theo phanic aesthetics quite distinct from the Emersonian transparent eye ball, in which the nature of the other is subsumed in the All; from the Dickinsonian microcosmos, in which Vesuvius is contained by the domus; and from T. S. Eliot's adventures in Indie religion, in which rivers are, necessarily, brown gods. I call this poetic principle the aesthetic of real presence because the voice of the poet arises from an encounter with a creature whose role as an instance of the divine roots the diasporic speaker in place, despite any claim of Anglo-American dominion. Real presence is, of course, a reference to the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, a Christian idea of incarnation through liturgical action. I suggest, however, that the Catholic heritage of Italian American culture can be used to talk about religious experiences that are not strictly Christian. The incarnational imperative to encounter the divine in the world of the senses through the mediation of art radiates from the official sacraments, but is not confined to them. Ais thesis, the sensory experience of the divine in or as a creature, founds ethnesis, the production and renewal of culture. The idea of the Mediterranean peasant and her/his offspring as closer to nature is not so much displaced as revealed to be an alternate origin for civilization itself. Like the three predators that block Dante's progress at the beginning of the Inferno, there are three challenges to my project: the status of Italian American literature as ethnic literature; the expectation of the performance of authentic difference in ethnic literature; and ignorance of the ironic rela tionship Italian American literature bears toward American and Italian lit erature. The first challenge is conventional: in contemporary departments of English, "ethnic literature" refers to the literature of racial minorities: American Indian, African American, Chicano/a, Asian American, and so on. In the identity politics of the 1980s and 1990s, this conflation of eth nicity with race served to obscure dark white literatures on the grounds that white identity is consubstantial with high Anglo-American culture. This is a category error?the confusion of racial status with cultural identity?that MELUS itself has defied by its attention to white ethnic literatures, including two special issues on Italian American literature (Fall/Winter 1987 and Fall 2003). Unfortunately, this inclusion does not resolve the status of "hyphenated identity" and its relationship to cultural production.4 In literary studies, the ambiguous status of dark whiteness</page><page sequence="3">NUMINA IN ITALIAN AMERICAN POETRY 143 leads to the demand that ethnic writers prove their alterity by devoting their literature to a consideration of difference.5 This is a problem shared with other groups. For instance, Toni Morrison is widely understood as an "African American writer" because her novels contend with the his tory of blackness, while Samuel R. Delany is considered a science fiction writer who happens to be African American. The best example of this in Italian American literature is Don DeLillo, who must be defended against charges of betrayal because his novels do not center on Italian American experience (Gardaph? 174). To the expectations of authenticity, I reply that the performance of ethnicity, whatever that is, is not the writer's job.6 "Italian American poetry" should be defined by its ongoing relationship to Italian American culture in every regard, not just self-regard. Ciardi and di Prima count as Italian American poets because their work displays an aesthetic developed in Italian American history, whether or not they are talking about identity as such. This aesthetic is an outgrowth of the cultura negata, the peasant "un-culture," denied as a culture on both sides of the Atlantic (D'Acierno 720). This fact contradicts the assumption that Italian American literature is simply a hybrid of Anglo-American and Italian liter ature. This idea is a historical chimera, l?italianit? did not dissolve in the American melting pot, neither did it represent, originally, the modern heri tage of the Italian Renaissance. Most Italian Americans?including both di Prima and Ciardi?are the descendants of southern Italian peasants and townspeople, products of the "Southern Question" that still plagues Italy today.7 Most of the farmers and skilled workers who migrated were locked out of the classical and Renaissance inheritance by virtue of their roots in the rural and impoverished Mezzogiorno region, the "land that time for got." Italian Americana is a mutation of normative American and Italian traditions; when continuity is asserted with either, it is often ironic, strate gic, parodie, mythic, or Utopian. The shift from southern village life to the cities and fields of the New World created exactly the kind of tension that warranted the aesthetic of real presence, which I will now explore. Robert Viscusi has claimed that Italian American literature enacts an allegoresis whereby immigrants are recognized as Godlike because their act of making America through suffering recapitulates the Trinity's act of making the world, suffering in order to redeem it, and descending upon it as Spirit (271-76). Though Viscusi grounds this idea in works of fic tion, his pattern also applies to the aesthetic I am about to trace. However, an application of Viscusian allegoresis to this aesthetic will require some adaptation. Because immigrant literature is particularly good at depicting the suffering inside the creation of America, there is a Christological cast to the allegory that does not describe entirely the aesthetic of real presence. Rather than using only Christian terms to describe the divine in Italian</page><page sequence="4">144 LIOI American poetry, I have adopted the Latin numen/numina: "divine power/ powers," as a more accurate, inclusive, and environmental term (Rives 19). These words are familiar to contemporary readers as a nominalized adjective: "the numinous," a gut-level sense of the sacred-in-place. This term gained ground, particularly in modernist anthropology and religious studies, through Rudolf Otto's The Idea of the Holy (1917). Unlike Otto, I use the more basic noun-forms because they denote a presence in a par ticular place and time, appearing to a particular person. Numen is a phe nomenological term: it points toward an appearance or performance of the divine.8 It is also specific to culture and environment: just as an ancient Greek would not experience Artemis as an Arctic fox, so Yellow Corn Woman of Laguna Pueblo would not appear in the grain of Ceres. For this reason, the concept of poetry as an encounter with numina is a poignant one for immigrants: how, as the psalm says, can we sing the songs of Zion in a foreign land? This tension structures "Mystic River," a poem by Ciardi, first collected in As If(1955) and later reprinted in The Collected Poems of John Ciardi (1997). Stephen Sartarelli calls Ciardi "the Italian American poet who has found perhaps the most secure place in the American literary pantheon" (270). Nonetheless, like African American modernist poets?Gwendolyn Brooks might be the closest parallel?Ciardi was obliged to prove that an ethnic poet could operate within the traditional norms of verse. In this sense, the modernist experiments of Eliot and Pound, Marianne Moore and H. D., appear very much a function of literary privilege: one can only discard something?in this case, English versification?that one already possesses. Ciardi, the child of illiterate immigrants, the first member of his family to go to college, had to gain entrance to Parnassus first. His teach ing career at Harvard, Rutgers, and the Bread Loaf School, as well as his television show, Accent, suggest that this strategy succeeded brilliantly and laid the foundation for a popular following at the very moment in the 1960s when poetry was losing ground in the culture at large. Whatever else they accomplished, the great experiments of Anglo-American modernism were incomprehensible outside the bounds of a university education at a time when most Americans did not attend college, so we must see Ciardi's formalism at least as an attempt to make literature his own family would understand. Ciardi's standard of the "Unimportant Poem," the lyric poem of everyday experience, should also be seen in this light (Cifelli xxviii). But if everyday experience rendered as formal verse constituted the heart of Ciardi's work, we should not assume that this experience was uncom plicated. On the contrary, "Mystic River" appears to be a map for the over coming of the Puritan aversion to the numina of the New World through a participation in the spirits of place. This is a historical and cultural victory:</page><page sequence="5">NUMINA IN ITALIAN AMERICAN POETRY 145 as Joseph P. Cosco notes, the Boston Brahmins, inheritors of the Puritan mantle, thought of southern Italian immigrants as "ignorant, uncultivated peasants" relative to the superior Germanic blood of the northern Italians (174). "Mystic River" is divided into three parts. In the first, Ciardi intro duces the river as a polluted relic of Puritan environmental destruction that has outlived the death of these "Gods" (115). In the second, Ciardi compares this with his own experience of the river as a child in Medford, Massachusetts, where he and his friends witnessed the deaths of an old man and one of their friends (116). The final part recounts or constructs a numinous experience in which Ciardi joins with the river and its creatures to outlast the Puritan heritage and attain a kind of enlightenment (116-17). Before considering each part in detail, it is worthwhile to consider the nature of this pattern as a whole. Although the encounter with the divine presences of the water and its animals follows a broad pattern laid down by the English and American Romantics, it is grounded in the history and rhetoric of a child of immigrants. The function of the poem's plot is to show how such a child succeeded, along with the river, in outlasting a Puritan heritage that is understood as the main source of the river's pollu tion. There is an ironic bite to this plot which suggests that the Mystic?as river and mode of revelation?does not manifest in an abstract otherworld, but appears as the scene of ethnic revenge. Like many Italian American poets in the twentieth century, Ciardi records, elsewhere, the public school system's desire to erase or cast shame upon his name, the language of his parents, and his physical appearance. In a cultural milieu controlled by Boston Brahmins, in which the poet's immigrant culture is seen as degenerate and diseased, Ciardi's alliance with the nonhuman world is an attempt to combat the violence of American culture with the power of American nature. The WASP sense of genetic and cultural superiority?an echo of the Puritan sense of the elect?is met with evidence of its material and spiritual failure. This conflict is expressed and victory assured in the first lines of Part I: The dirty river by religious explorers Named Mysticke and recorded forever into its future Civilization of silt and sewerage, recovers The first sweet moon of time tonight. (115) The recovery of a "sweet moon" is a Ciardian swipe at the aesthetic values of Anglo-Protestant culture. In a snarky note in his translation ofParadiso, Ciardi comments on the disservice other translators have done to Dante's italianit? by rendering "sweet" and "bitter" as "good" and "bad." This is</page><page sequence="6">146 LIOI a disservice because it replaces sensory adjectives with moralistic terms that suggest an alienation from the senses that is anathema to Dante's poet ics (Alighieri 240). Add to this the Comedy's Neoplatonic ascent through the stars, and it becomes clear that the river's recovery is linked to its reconnection with divine grace through a Dantean cosmic scheme. This assertion is followed by several stanzas of Puritan accounts of the river as "pleasynge gentle," "salubrious," and "refreshynge" at the moment of colonial contact. That state is contrasted with its post-Puritan condition: "the moon / Dances on pollution, the fish are fled / Into a finer instinct of revulsion," but, in an example of contrapasso, or poetic justice, the mur der of the river and the fish results in the death of gods. The Mystic "lights the wake of Gods," in fact. Here, the Nietzschean drama of the murder of God is understood as a suicide, an ecological suicide at that: the Puritan heritage dies because of its betrayal of the water. The river itself is no sui cide: "'Let me be clean,' / It cries and cries, but there are years between" (115). What follows is an account of the suffering left by the Puritan catas trophe in which the river, its inhabitants, and Ciardi's neighbors pay the price of environmental collapse. The river becomes the scene of many deaths: a homeless man dies "of epilepsy or DT's" on the bank; Ciardi and his friends "watched the alewife [Alosa pseudoharengus, a kind of shad] smother"; and one of the friends, Willie Crosby, dies of a fever contracted from the dirty water. Ciardi points the finger at the true inheritors of this legacy when he begins this section with the line "And I have stoned and swum and sculled them all," an allusion to Eliot's "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock," which details its speaker's inability to connect to his environment (116). By aiming at an iconic poem of Anglophilic modern ism, Ciardi seems to imply that if Eliot and his ilk want to regain their English heritage, they ought to reclaim all of it, including the heritage of environmental destruction in the New World. The Mystic River suggests that Prufrock's rejection by mermaids may have a more sinister origin than his personal failings. The resolution to this story of environmental collapse is initiated by the moon, which "drowns / Pollution in its own illusion of light." The speak er's response to radiance, a traditional Christian synecdoche of grace, is worth reporting in full: Let me be lit to the bone by this one stir, And where the Gods grew rich and positive From their ruinous landing, I'll attend disaster Like night birds over a wake, dark and alive Above the shuttered house, and, bound and free, Wheel on the wing, find food in flight, and be</page><page sequence="7">NUMINA IN ITALIAN AMERICAN POETRY 147 Captured by light, drawn down and down and down By moonshine, streetlamps, windows, moving rays, By all that shines in all the caved-in town Where Mystic in the crazy moon outstays The death of Gods, and makes a life of light That breaks, but calls a million birds to flight. (116-17) American poetry will have to wait until the Black Arts Movement and the Native American Renaissance to witness a more vigorous rejection of Anglo-Saxon supremacy. That this rejection occurs in the poetry of a dark white writer is yet another reason to acknowledge that race is not ethnicity. Ciardi's identification with natural and artificial creatures suggests that the division between nature and history, or nature and culture, which ani mates the canon of American nature writing, is a Puritan dilemma. This poem wants no part of it; the suffering of nature is the suffering of culture: the old man, the boy dying of fever, the choking fish, and the dirty river are all connected; the light of the moon is one with streetlamps and win dows. Their survival is also one. Each element of Medford has survived the death of its original European "Gods" by surviving together; the light of the moon, a power of illumination beyond the power of the gods, tries to clean an entire ecocultural scene. The voice of the poet as herald of this transformation is evoked by all the presences, all the numina, in its milieu. Like the moon and town, he shines; like the birds, he flies; like the river and its history, he is illuminated. They qualify as numina not only because Ciardi takes them seriously as real presences, but because their power fills a particular place in a particular kairos, a moment of opportunity for the appearance of grace in history. In his foreword to the Collected Poems, Edward M. Cifelli warns the reader to be ready for Ciardi's avowal of "the impossibility of a traditional belief in God" (xxviii). What we find here, after the death of God the White Father, is the possibility of resurrection through the power of real presence. If there is no patriarch in heaven, there are the powers of light, the elements, and animals that can be summoned to a real end. "Mystic River" is a gesture of apophatic mysticism?an account of a dark night of the soul in Massachusetts?that is also a record of reunion with other creatures spurned amid the twilight of the gods. It is an assertion of an original relation to America that does not depend on a book of myths in which our names do not appear. Commenting on the centrality of material elements?relics, statues, models of body parts?to the cult of the saints, historian Tommaso Astarita asserts: "Southern [Italian] religion was thus almost a form of shamanism" (144). He notes also the "focus on the dead," both the saints and the suf fering souls in Purgatory (150). If we extend this thought, we find that Ciardi's relationship to the Mystic River is not so surprising. Ciardi had</page><page sequence="8">148 LIOI a strong sense that the Holy is always local, that the ancestors are always involved, and that human suffering must be answered by intervention from transhuman powers. His relationship to the river and the town, the fish and the birds, is, indeed, "almost shamanic." There is a crisis, a journey into a spirit world, and a return home with spiritual power. This reinvention of an Old World pattern in a contemporary form continues in Loba, the book-length poem published by Diane di Prima in 1978 and again as an expanded version in 1998. Though di Prima is acknowledged as a central figure in the Beat movement and in feminist poetry, she is most famous for not being as famous as she should be. Unlike Ciardi, di Prima has never been the subject of sustained critical or popular attention.9 One is tempted to blame it on brutta figura, a failure to keep up appearances for the sake of community standards. A woman poet who did not destroy herself in the 1950s, an intellectual Italian, esoteric and syncretistic among Catholics and Neopagans, a pan-sexual in the feminist wars of orientation, di Prima does not genuflect in the right direction. The resulting obscurity of her work is a critical disaster of the first order. If Ciardi's work merits close attention from ecocritics because of his profound relationship to animals and elements, di Prima's Loba is a major work of the ecocentric imagina tion. Although it is often called the female counterpart to Allen Ginsberg's Howl, a better parallel would be to Gary Snyder's Mountains and Rivers without End. Like that poem, Loba is an epic made of lyrics, composed over many decades, growing like a coral reef into its author's spiritual and aesthetic monument. The numen of the title is, of course, the wolf as woman, goddess, ancestor, muse, and authorial alter ego. Di Prima writes of, and through, this numen in the tradition of contemporary feminist visionary poets, a lineage that includes H. D., Audre Lorde, Marge Piercy, Margaret Atwood, Lucille Clifton, H?l?ne Cixous, Alicia Suskin Ostriker, and others. Like these writers, di Prima rewrites Western religious his tory, its central narratives and characters, to refigure God and the soul in the form of a sister.10 What distinguishes di Prima from this mythopoetic cohort is, of course, the Beast herself. Loba is a poem in which an Italian American woman reaches back to the Old World to refigure a mythic Latin animal as a numen in the New World, asserting her poetic authority in the face of both Anglo and Italian American patriarchy. Loba allows di Prima to affirm all the religious elements in her ancestral cultura negata, pagan and Christian alike, in a feminist, syncretic mode. So, before moving on, a few words about the Wolf. The most significant thing about this wolf is her place in the origin myth of Rome. The legend that Romulus and Remus, the city's founding brothers, were rescued by a she-wolf is one of the first accounts told in Western Civilization 101 (Plutarch 2.6). After the boys are old enough to</page><page sequence="9">NUMINA IN ITALIAN AMERICAN POETRY 149 fight, the wolf disappears from the story, but her significance lingers. The primal wolf of Rome connects the city to the wild as saved to savior, cli ent to patron, and child to mother. Many civilizations trace their lineage back to a female divine ruler, but Roma?the ancestor of Byzantium, the British Empire, and the United States?is descended from a wolf mother. The famous statue of the nursing wolf and her human sons proclaims: one predator fosters another. Her ferocity became its own. Di Prima claims to be the daughter of that wolf, the wolf at the beginning of the West. This is a complicated gesture in diaspora. Di Prima is from New York, not Rome or any other Italian city. As the scion of the Italian south, she is not an obvi ous inheritor of classical culture. In the period between the founding of the Italian Republic and World War I, southern Italians made up the majority of Italian emigrants because they were not the children of the Renaissance, but a peasantry oppressed by urban and ecclesial elites. Di Prima's ances tors left Italy because they were not the blood of the wolf. Like Ciardi's identification with Dante, di Prima's claim to the wolf is a gesture that could only happen, ironically, outside of Italy itself. Her appropriation is double-edged, pointed backward at the via vecchia, the Old Way, which denied her people access even to the memory of Rome, and forward at the elite of Anglo-America, who saw her parents as degenerate and barbaric, a threat to the American Republic. Di Prima's choice to call the wolf Loba, rather than the Italian Lupa,u signals this diasporic cut; a snub of the old country, it is an identification with the descendants of Spain in the United States, who are also called bestial and diseased in nativist rhetoric. Di Prima went behind the origin of Italy and America to seize the formative power of civilization before it was turned against her.1 The poem that results from this epic gesture defies close reading. It is the kind of book that deserves another book to unlock its meanings. I will not pretend to be comprehensive here, but I will comment on passages that are particularly relevant to the aesthetics of real presence. The introduc tory section, "Ave" ("Hail"), makes it clear that di Prima understands the figure of the Loba and her consequences. The section opens with a direct address to the poet's "lost moon sisters," women who wander the streets of New York as Bohemian fl?neuses: "crescent in hair, sea underfoot do you wander / in blue veil, in green leaf, in tattered shawl do you wander" (3). They are identified as denizens of a modern metropolis because of their location?Avenue A, Bleecker Street?but as nature divinities as well, with the moon in their hair and the sea at their feet, wandering in the leaves as well as in shawls. The iconography is reminiscent of Mary, Queen of Heaven, and her predecessors Isis, Anath, and Ishtar. The women are more and less than human, and represent the recuperation of women in history and deities in cosmography. Although they are lost, di Prima does not so</page><page sequence="10">150 LIOI much seek to save them as to evoke them through direct address. If they can be addressed, they can be taken back into consciousness and appear as numina in their proper place. The tone of this section is hortatory and ecstatic, yet it also transforms the drama of recuperation, which, in less skilled hands, can become melodramatic, into an opportunity for humor: you lie with the unicorn you lie with the cobra you lie in the dry grass you lie with the yeti you flick long cocks of satyrs with your tongue (4) The women wander through the city, the wilderness, and the realm of myth all at the same time, and the journey is overtly erotic, a frank rejection of the behavior expected of the good Italian woman. That the erotic journey is also funny, and includes the yeti with the satyr and the unicorn, indicates that di Prima wants an ironic relationship to phallic wildness, a negotiated peace with powers that could be dangerous and patriarchal. Like Ciardi's acceptance of pollution in the mystical river, di Prima's attitude towards masculine elements in myth is pragmatic, not Utopian. Unlike feminist mythographers who seek to create an aesthetic space devoid of male influence, di Prima charts a cosmos in which the male encounter with women and nature is acceptable because it is decentered and relational. In figures drawn from the most important sacred tales of East and West?Buddha, Krishna, Tiferet, Arthur, Apollo, Tristan, Christ, Lucifer, Thoth/Tehuti, Coyote?male numina populate, but do not domi nate, the poem. Whether in these gods and heroes or their female counter parts, gender is always an attribute of presence for di Prima, making her divinities less abstract than the Neoplatonic Light evoked by Ciardi. This sense of gender as unavoidable places her squarely in the realm of gyno centric ecofeminism, along with Mary Daly, Susan Griffin, Starhawk, and Charlene Spretnak, among others. While Loba's sense of gender might be called essentialist, in that gender is of the essence where numina are concerned, there is no sense of the Manichean dualism sometimes implied by the charge of essentialism. There is no sense that male numina are to be avoided or eliminated, either in matter or in spirit. Because the Wolf is a maker of cosmos, men and gods have a place because it is the nature of all the numina to be in place. In Book I, di Prima elaborates the paradox of the Loba as participant creator. She is larger than human artifacts, older than civilization, and capable of entering time and space:</page><page sequence="11">NUMINA IN ITALIAN AMERICAN POETRY 151 Is she city? Gate she is we know &amp; has been, but the road paved w/ white stones? her paws are cut by it, the lights blind her, yet she knows, she comes to it, white porcelain lining dome of her brain, she flies to it on broomstick, on gold m?ndala platter or calendar, she sits, her tail curled round her neat white paws.... (12) In this strophe the Loba transcends the boundaries between nature and cul ture, personality and impersonality, spirit and matter. She is greater than but contained by the city, a gate to it and its citizen; though her paws are cut by the paving stones, she is both the paws and the stones that cut them. Furthermore, as a numen, she is characterized in ecumenical terms: her broomstick is Neopagan?di Prima would probably say "magickal"; the golden m?ndala is Buddhist; and the round calendar may be a reference to lunar timekeeping in pre-Christian Rome. The representation of the Loba as part of many religions, but limited to none, continues throughout the poem as she is identified with many female divinities from Near Eastern, Celtic, Hebrew, Greek, Roman, Christian, American Indian, Chinese, and Hindu pantheons, as well as epic protagonists such as Helen of Troy, Guinevere, Iseult, Lilith, and Ariadne. Part Six of the poem, "The Seven Joys of the Virgin," is a revision of the Catholic account of Mary's role in the life of Jesus as told from Mary's point of view. Though di Prima's strategy of collapsing multiple goddesses from world religions into one figure, only to treat the Loba at other times as a figure from a single tradi tion, may confuse the first-time reader, it is consistent from the perspective of feminist religious movements of the 1970s. In the Women's Spirituality movement in North America and the United Kingdom, it was common to assume that all goddesses are really manifestations of the One Goddess who appears in multiple forms throughout world cultures and eras.13 One unnamed poem bears out this assumption: it is a litany of goddesses from all over the world, name following upon name in no discernible order (di Prima, Loba 54). This gesture makes sense in light of di Prima's own claim, in the biographical note, to be a "teacher of western magickal tradi tions," which was influenced by the universalizing strains of modernist anthropology and history of religions in the first part of the twentieth cen tury. These tendencies in feminist Wicca were criticized during the 1980s and 1990s as culturally imperialist, metaphysically idealist, and politically retrograde.14 But Loba should not be reduced to a series of suspect fundamentals of feminist religion. Instead, di Prima's universalist mythmaking must be</page><page sequence="12">152 LIOI taken seriously as a gesture in ethnic diaspora. If di Prima had wanted an imperial universalism with an explicit set of dogmatic principles, she could have remained under the wing of the Roman Magisterium. It seems more likely that the poet was, instead, trying to fashion a mythopoetic bridge across traditions to other practitioners of female-identified spiritualities. Because she was never an imperial feminist in quotidian life, it seems rea sonable to assume that her attraction to religious syncretism was more of a search for allies than a quest for dominion. The figure of the Beast plays a significant role in this hypothesis. In imperial universalisms, there is a reduction of multiple figures to one pre-existing figure, identified with the imperialist's home tradition. An example of this in modernist literature is Robert Graves's The White Goddess (1948), in which Graves claims that all European and Near Eastern goddesses are really versions of the White Goddess, and that he is her chosen mouthpiece and acolyte. Feminist crit ics of religion noticed that this is not so different from monotheistic claims to final, perfected revelation of the One, and so they began to purge femi nist discourse of "the" Goddess entirely. Loba does not fit this pattern. She is not the center of an ancient tradition; her name and manifestation do not eclipse others; and her primary identity as wolf calls into question the primacy of any anthropomorphic goddess. Loba is not a renovation of a deity whose function is to catapult Italian American goddesses to the top of the supernal heap. She is a theriomorphic numen, a real presence in the shape of an animal; she hosts a gathering of numina in a textual space that is no one's semiotic property. Is she a city? Sometimes, but she is definitely a gate to something new. Di Prima suggests as much when, in "Point of Ripening: Lughnasa," one of the final lyrics in Loba, she quotes Carl Jung's question, "What Myth are you living?" and answers "There is no myth / for what I am living now" (305). Di Prima honors the past, but overcomes the insular version of campanilismo?the sense that one's vil lage is the whole world?with an enlightened version: the local environ ment is a microcosm of a universe of spirits. If we take seriously di Prima's training in Zen and Tibetan Buddhism, it becomes possible to think about Loba as a sutra, the Loba Sutra, a White Wolf Sutra, a contemporary Buddhist scripture that is left to help others attain the end of suffering. This way of thinking about Loba, and about the Loba herself, is not inconsistent with an emphasis on the numina. This is true in two ways. First, although Buddhism distinguishes between gods and buddhas?deities are said to need enlightenment as much as humans need it?there are a number of deities regarded as buddhas, and also as bodhisattvas, enlightened beings who dedicate themselves to the enlight enment of others. If Loba is a sutra, then the Loba is its bodhisattva, seek ing out the lost moon sisters to aid them in their wandering. Given the</page><page sequence="13">NUMINA IN ITALIAN AMERICAN POETRY 153 profusion of numina in the poem, it is not too much to see the many ver sions and daughters of the Loba as a sangha in poetry, a community of enlightenment that includes the reader. The other sense in which the numina serve Buddhist ends is how they promote attention to the present moment: if the Loba lives in cities and wilderness, in bag ladies and hipsters, in pav ing stones and the wolves walking over them, she could be apprehended at any moment. Therefore, the reader should pay attention to every moment, in order to see the W?lfin it, and glimpse the end of suffering. This brief excursion into the place of presences in Ciardi and di Prima's poetry has ramifications for the way we talk about literature and the land, "America" and its environmental history. The aesthetic of real presence relies on a dialogue between divinity-in-place and the transcendent God of classical Western theism for which Italian American culture is an ideal host, given its roots among the pagani of southern Italy and their descen dents. In the contemporary canon of American environmental literature, this kind of dialogue is usually found in American Indian writers?Leslie Marmon Silko, N. Scott Momaday, Gerald Vizenor?and white writers who borrow from the First Nations, such as Gary Snyder. Though Ralph Waldo Emerson and Mary Oliver certainly have a sense of the Holy, it is restrained by the Anglo-Protestant fear of idolatry, of identifying creature and creator. Ciardi and di Prima suggest that dark white poetry may pos sess a more ardent and sacramental sense of the divine-in-place. More radically, white ethnic poetry of the environment should oblige critics to reconsider the relationship between the senses, the emotions, the spirit, and poetic language. The aesthetic of real presence is not an aesthetic of the sublime, an appreciation of landscape, or a call to pastoral contempla tion. This has to do with the sense of campanilismo and pride of belonging derived from the Mezzogiorno, and the importance of cities, suburbs, and working farms in the experience of Italian Americans. Real presence finds the divine in environments that are unimportant or actively shunned in most American nature writing. This ground for an alternative aesthetic in an alternate history of the United States is not accidental. Like the numina themselves, Italian American history is a disruption of conventional narra tives of the American environment. Belated relative to the great conflicts of nineteenth-century nation-building, including the history of conserva tionism, Italian American eco-poetry provides another beginning?or bet ter yet, another in medias res?to the story of the human relationship to the spirits of North America, original cultural resources for a sustainable nation and a spirituality of place. Where once we were vermin in the cities on a hill, now we are a holy presence ourselves.15 The power of poetry to effect this kind of environmental ethnesis should be the subject of further investigation.16</page><page sequence="14">154 LIOI Notes I. See, for instance, Jennifer Guglielmo and Salvatore Salerno, Matthew Frye Jacobson, and David R. Roediger. 2.1 take the idea of "dark whiteness" from Maria Laurino. However, the term has a longer history; see Jacobson 243. 3. The idea of Anglo-America as "nature's nation" comes from Perry Miller. 4. See Donna R. Gabaccia. 5. Morrison addresses this issue. See also Vincent J. Cheng. 6.1 thank Katherine Lynes for the phrase "expectations of authenticity." 7. This is the question of whether southern Italians and the South of Italy can be integrated into the modern Italian nation, given their "backwardness." See Antonio Gramsci. 8. There is a controversy among classicists concerning the nature of numen. While some authorities argue that it can only be used to refer to the presence of a particu lar deity ("the numen of Diana"), others offer late-antique evidence that the word can be used for unknown powers, or even a single transcendent One appearing in a particular place. See "Numen," Simon Hornblower and Antony Spawforth 1054. See also Jason Davies 265-68.1 have capitalized on this ambiguity consciously. 9. For a revealing account of the negative criticisms Diane di Prima has received, see Roseanne Giannini Quinn. 10. On the revision of myth and religion in women's poetry, see Alicia Suskin Ostriker, Stealing the Language 210-38 and Feminist Revision and the Bible. II. Plutarch notes that "the Latins not only called she-wolves 'lupae,' but also women of loose character" (3.1). Since di Prima is something of a Latinist, she may be commenting on this double meaning. 12. In her memoir, di Prima notes that, as she went off to high school after hav ing tested first in New York City, her father cautions her: "'Now don't expect too much. I want you to always remember that you're Italian.' Not that we weren't as good, but however good we were, we would always be held down. Or back. An underclass" (Recollections 71-72). Loba is the result of expecting too much. 13. See Charlene Spretnak 3-86. 14. See Margot Adler. 15. For an ironic account of immigrants as vermin by an Irish American writer, see Robert Sullivan. 16. For reasons of space, I could not include all the poets I wanted. Future research should consider, among others: Phyllis Capello, Gregory Corso, Tina DeRosa, Sandra Mortola Gilbert, Maria Mazziotti Gillan, Dana Gioia, Daniela Gioseffi, Edvige Giunta, Jay Parini, Felix Stefanile, Nick Virgilio, and Robert Viscusi.</page><page sequence="15">NUMINA IN ITALIAN AMERICAN POETRY 15 5 Works Cited Adler, Margot.
