<plain_text><page sequence="1">Response to Thomas Princen's review of Vibrant Matter: A Political Ecology of Things doi:1 0.1 01 7/S1 53759271 0003476 - Jane Bennett Tom Princen and I share many commitments - to tread- ing lightly on the earth, to the political potential of every- day habits, to practicing the difficult art of countercultural persuasion, to a political economy of sustainability, and to the advantages of short and earnest books. I am grateful for his review, which raises many good points. I will respond to just three. 1. On the relationship between a political vision and a nature imaginary: Princen says that I develop "a politics that is every bit as natural' as that premised on subject-object, life-matter dualisms, on man apart from nature,' on hierarchy and domination." I think this is true, though I wasn't fully conscious as I wrote the book of the extent to which its rhetoric relied on an appeal - both dangerous and unfashionable- to "nature." But yes, my political and ethical claims are closely linked to an onto-picture, a rerum natura whose logic is processual, creative, vibra- tory, heterogeneous. Much harm and suffering has been imposed in the name of appeals to nature: racism, sexism, homophobia, colo- nialism. But it is very hard to avoid some such appeal. Maybe it is unavoidable. And Princens comment serves as a reminder to be careful - to be alert to the tendency of even an open, porous, vibrant "nature" to reify, to become idol rather than fallible heuristic. 2. On the relationship between a vital materialism and an ecological commodity-chain approach to food design, pro- duction, and consumption: Princen rightly points out that, by my account, fast food and its disposable packaging and the human and nonhuman materials of its design and production are all vibrant matter. So what, then, is the distinctly "vital mate- rialist argument against fast food"? I don't think there is a specifically vital materialist cri- tique. The neo-animist ontology that I try to work out and live through is not a replacement for critiques made in the name of ecological sustainability and/or human health, but might serve as a 'supplement or bolster to them. This nature imaginary might have a bit of affective pull for some audiences that the other kinds of critique don't. It might reinforce the point that junk food matters - it may be junk, but it isn't inert. It's dangerous and powerful stuff, and we better pay attention to what it's doing to our bodies as eaters and workers, to the bodies of the animals and plants displaced by agribusiness, to the bodies of water (such that there now exists giant swirls of plastic debris about the size of Texas in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans). 3. On the claim that now is not the time for the faint- hearted: Princen says I am "unduly cautious" in my advocacy of a vital materialist politic^. That might be because I am in a discipline, political science, where claims on behalf of the agency of matter and in favor of an anthropomorphic mode of inquiry are likely to be received with great skep- ticism. But I agree with Princen that however dramatic a philosophy of vibrant matter may be, it pales in compar- ison to the drama of ecological collapse that Treading Softly has as its motive force. Princen is right: we are in seriously bad shape, and now is not the time for the fainthearted. The relentlessly extrac- tive, hyper-consumptive political economy of massive waste, profound inequality, and thoughtlessness toward the future can't go on. The trick, which both of us are trying to learn, is to exercise some smart human agency before the agency of things renders it moot. Notes 1 Ray Kurzweil's claim in The Singularity is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology (2005) that we are on the verge of intelligent machines that will usher in a "post scarcity" society is perhaps the most confi- dent and thoroughgoing rejection of Princens com- mon sense recognition of natural limits. Though I am intrigued by Kurzweil's claims about the expo- nential growth of information technologies and agree with him that "the human" will surely be 1 20 Perspectives on Politics</page><page sequence="2">altered as it enters into relation with newly emerging (techno-natural) bodies, I also agree with Steven Shaviros criticism that the "ideological function" of Kurzweil s work is "to bring us to utopia without incurring the inconvenience of having to question our current social and economic arrangements. This is why Kurzweil supposes that the onward march of technology will produce the society of plenitude, all by itself - so long as government bureaucrats and religious fundamentalists do not interfere with en- trepreneurial innovation" (Steven Shaviro, "The Singularity is Here," http://www.shaviro.com/ Othertexts/Singularity.pdf ) . 2 Decontested terms "aim to limit the range of possi- ble contestation around central political concepts" and identifications.
