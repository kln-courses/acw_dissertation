AUGUSTIN, GL(CKSTADT</page><page sequence="4">IN MEMORY OF LUCY TALCOTT</page><page sequence="5">PREFACE O ne of the surprising rewards of the American Excavations in the Agora and its vicinity was the comparative wealth of early or "prehistoric" material. Although the excavations were primarily concerned with elucidating the history and topography of Classical Athens, these early finds constitute a most important addition to our knowledge of Athens in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages and the place she occupies in the wider field of Aegean archaeology. Of the nearly one thousand inventoried items of a date prior to about 1150 B.C. (roughly the end of the Mycenaean period and the date at which the Submycenaean material begins), by far the greater amount is pottery, both whole vases and potsherds. But, in addition, the Agora has produced objects of stone, bone and ivory, bronze, lead, and more rarely silver and gold, glass and semi-precious stones, some of these of real artistic merit. The very quantity of material is a striking proof of the habitation of the Agora and the sur- rounding slopes of the Acropolis, Areopagus and the neighboring hills from at least the fourth millennium B.C. This had been in part deduced from earlier excavations, notably those of the Greeks and Germans on the Acropolis, the Americans on the North Slope, the Italians on the South Slope, and it is currently being supplemented by Greek excavations in several areas, particularly the South Slope, the Hill of Philopappos, the Olympieion, and Plato's Academy. Nowhere, however, isenand the evidence so full and the series so complete as in he Agora. Although no actual prehistoric settlement has been laid bare, nor has any building of this period been uncovered, this is not surprising considering the continuous habitation and usage of the area from Geometric through Classical, Roman, medieval and modern times. Many of the building projects of these later periods entailed a cutting down and levelling of bedrock, so that only those deposits that cut deeply enough into virgin rock or those that were used to fill in natural pockets and declivities have survived. Thus, our greatest source of information for the Neolithic and the Early and Middle Helladic periods comes from wells, pits and bothroi, and for the Late Helladic period from over forty chamber tombs and graves. Numbers based on the Agora grid have been assigned to almost eighty such prehistoric deposits, which are listed alphabeti- cally (followed by items in the Catalogue in boldface) in the Index of Deposits; these are located with appropriate symbols on the Plan (PI. 91). Since there is little real stratigraphy, the material from the Neolithic through the Middle Helladic period has not been presented according to deposits, but selectively according to types and fabrics. 408 items have been chosen to illustrate the range of finds from these periods, and they have been arranged in the Catalogue under two main headings, "Neolithic" and "Early and Middle Helladic," each preceded by a general discussion of the types of deposit, the main characteristics of the pottery and other finds, and conclusions as to date and cultural affinities. For the Mycenaean period, the tombs and graves are discussed individually, each followed by the publication of its complete inventory. The tombs are designated by Roman</page><page sequence="6">PREFACE numerals, and are arranged in a topographic sequence, beginning with the large ones on the North Slope of the Areopagus. Te objects within each tomb are given a separate series of Arabic numerals; thus each item from a tomb has a double numeral, Roman plus Arabic (for example I-16 for the large ivory pyxis from the chamber tomb N 21-22:1). In addition, some- what less than 100 other Mycenaean objects, not from tombs, continue the running sequence of Arabic numerals from the first part of the book (409-504). The Mycenaean section is preceded by a discussion of the tomb types, burial customs, offerings, and an appraisal of the Agora Mycenaean pottery, its chronological range, characteristic shapes and motives, and local idiosyncracies. This section concludes with an attempt to place the Agora material within the broader context of the Mycenaean remains on the Acropolis and the North Slope, and to synthesize a brief history of Mycenaean Athens. This study was begun in 1961 under a fellowship from the American Association of University Women, which enabled me to spend the summer months in Athens working with the objects and using the excavation notebooks. A further period of study in Athens, from January to July 1964, was assisted by a grant-in-aid of the American Philosophical Society. Meanwhile library research has been pursued at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and at the Insti- tute for Advanced Study at Princeton during several summers. To all these institutions I owe my thanks. Of the many people who have encouraged and contributed to this volume I should like to thank especially Homer A. Thompson for making this material available to me, for answering many questions and explaining many problems, and Lucy Talcott for her interest and her knowledge of the objects. Of the various Agora excavators over the years who dug and recorded significant deposits of prehistoric material, the following deserve special mention: the late Arthur W. Parsons for the prehistoric wells in Section OA, Eugene Vanderpool for the Myce- naean chamber tombs on the North Slope of the Areopagus and for supervising those dis- covered under the Stoa of Attalos, and Emily Townsend Vermeule for her excavation and study of the tomb under the Temple of Ares (Tomb VII) found in 1951 and the new tomb with the coffins discovered in 1965 (Tomb XL). Thanks are also due the various members of the Agora staff, especially Poly Demoulini and Spyro Spyropoulos. The new group photographs of fragments (Pls. 2-13; 15-20; 24) and of Mycenaean shapes (Pls. 65-67) were taken by James Heyle in the spring of 1964; most of the others are by Alison Frantz. The plans are mainly the work of John Travlos assisted by his daughter Nina, who has also drawn most of the pottery profiles. The drawings of the Mattpainted pottery found in 1936 were made by Piet de Jong when the decoration was still fresh; other drawings are by Hero Athanasiades. With- out the help and patience of these people, this book could not have been completed. To my colleagues in the field of prehistoric studies my debt is great: to the late Alan J. B. Wace and the late Mary H. Swindler for furthering my interest in Mycenaean studies, to Carl W. Blegen for his inspiration and guidance, to Saul S. Weinberg and Cohn Renfrew for dis- cussing specific Neolithic and Cycladic problems with me, to John L. Caskey for applying the wisdom of Lerna and Keos, and to Evelyn L. Smithson for many helpful suggestions with the later Mycenaean material. Our special debt to Oscar Broneer, who first revealed the full im- portance of Mycenaean Athens with his excavation of the Mycenaean Fountain, will be apparent in the third section of this publication. To the pottery experts, Frederick R. Matson and Marie Farnsworth, I am indebted for much helpful counsel, although in not all instances was the verdict unequivocal. I should also like to thank members of the Greek Archaeological viii * * Vlll</page><page sequence="7">PREFACE ix Service for allowing me to see comparative material, both published and unpublished, es- pecially George Dontas and Nicholas Platon for pottery in the Acropolis Museum, and Semni Karouzou and Agnes Sakellariou for objects in the National Museum. This book was finished in the summer of 1967, and it has not been possible to include sub- sequent bibliography. It was possible to add the new chamber tomb (Tomb XL) and the Mycenaean grave (XLI) found during the clearing of the South Square in the summer of 1965, but the manuscript was too far along to incorporate in the Catalogue other fragments of prehistoric ware found that summer; these are referred to by their inventory numbers under similar objects.

THE NEOLITHIC PERIOD INTRODUCTION 1. DEPOSITS (Plate 91 and pp. 274-275) O ur main evidence for the Neolithic period comes from the fill of twenty wells dug by the late Arthur W. Parsons from 1937 to 1939. These were not in the Agora proper but high up on the northwest slope of the Acropolis in an area below and to the east and west of the classical Klepsydra, and also not far from the famous caves and Long Rocks of the North Slope.1 Here the water table was so high that the natural springs which fed the Klepsydra in classical times could be reached with a minimum of digging, and the caves may once have served as rock shelters or places of burial or worship. Of such usage, however, all vestiges have disappeared and we have merely the fill of the adjacent wells to indicate the period and type of occupancy. From the number of wells one must surely surmise some near-by settlement, but perhaps farther down the slope in the area of the later Eleusinion where miscellaneous Neolithic sherds have been unearthed. Since these wells have received only scant treatment in the preliminary reports,2 it may be advisable to describe one or two individually as well as to indicate their general characteris- tics.3 On the whole, the wells were roughly circular or irregular in plan with an average diameter of about 1.0 m. at the top, often tapering toward the bottom. They were crudely cut with the primitive tools at the disposal of the diggers, and reach an average depth of only 3 to 4 m. Whenever a too large or intractable boulder was encountered, the well was either abandoned before water was struck (T 24:2, T 26:4, T 26:5 and probably R 28:2, T 26:1, U 25:1) or the shaft was deflected so as to avoid the boulder. This was the case with U 24:2, the deepest of the Neolithic wells. It was unusually neatly cut with a diameter of 1.0 to 1.10 m. down to a depth of 6.0 m. when a ledge of harder rock projecting from the northeast was met. This necessitated an undercutting of the southwest side, and beyond that point the well continues another 1.70 m. on the new axis, but the scooped out depression at the bottom is made to fall approximately beneath the center of the upper shaft for convenience in drawing water. With a total depth of 7.70 m. this well yielded the 1 The widening and improvement of the modem peripatos (Odos Akropoleos = Section Omicron Alpha) by the Greek government led to the excavation of this area (Shear, Hesperia, VII, 1938, pp. 330f.). 2 Also Shear, Hesperia, VIII, 1939, p. 221; IX, 1940, pp. 297-298. 3 This information comes from the carefully kept notebooks of the excavator, Arthur W. Parsons, who unfortunately did not live to publish these prehistoric wells. Although often supervising the digging of four or five at the same time (ranging from Neolithic to Archaic), he kept an admirable record, and with few exceptions the finds had been mended and sorted before World War II closed the excavations. In the spring of 1957 when this material was being transferred to the Stoa of Attalos, Miss Margaret Crosby reexamined it and noted those wells which seemed in need of additional sorting and mending. This work was given priority in the summer of 1961, when the author began study of the Agora prehistoric material, and she wishes to thank her daughter Mary for many patient hours of joining and mending, resulting in a number of significant new fragments which were inventoried, and the practically complete pot 5.</page><page sequence="19">NEOLITHIC PERIOD: INTRODUCTION largest inventory of catalogued objects as well as eleven containers of sherds, one of stone and obsidian fragments, and one of bones. Although the material was divided by the excavator into an upper and a lower fill, there is no apparent stratification or distinction in material between the two lots, and the whole seems to represent a single dump fill rather than a period of use or gradual accumulation plus dump. The pottery from this well covers fairly completely the full range of types from the other Neolithic wells, and it also contained seven obsidian flakes, one blade, several fragmentary handaxes, pieces of mortars and millstones, as well as animal bones. Unlike some others it yielded no human skeletal material and no whole pots. Human bones and complete vases were found in several wells, although the association is not consistent enough to suggest disturbed graves as the source of both. T 26:3 produced the intact biconical jar 3, along with a human humerus, whereas S 27:4 yielded the skull of a child and the coarse wide-mouthed bowl 171, likewise complete except for chips. However, the two wells with the most abundant skeletal material, which has been published by Angel,4 namely the child's skull from U 25:1 and the three skulls from U 26:2, yielded only fragmentary pottery. From U 26:5 came the beautiful intact Red Burnished jar 1, and no skeletal material. There- fore, it seems better to reject the idea that the whole pots, which are mostly the Red Burnished biconical jars, came originally from graves. In U 26:5 the biconical jar 1 was found beneath a projecting boulder near the bottom, along with the usual assortment of animal bones and fragmentary pottery. The well is very neatly cut and, apart from the boulder, almost perfectly circular with a diameter of 0.85 m. It had a preserved depth of only 2.40 m. and there is no certainty that water was reached. Nonetheless the position of this jar and its intact condition may well indicate a use fill, and the possibility exists that the Red Burnished biconical jars served as containers to draw water.5 Although their size and capacity in general are small and the surface far finer than would be expected for such utilitarian pots, one should perhaps not reject this possibility. The vertically pierced lug handles of 1, 2, 3, etc. would have been ideal for inserting strings or thongs to let down the pot, and if the cord snapped when the pot was at the bottom or snagged under a boulder, an intact vase would be the owner's loss and the archaeologist's reward. This may explain why the Red Burnished jars are far more nearly complete than most other types; whole or nearly whole examples are found in seven wells. The scrappier material may then be considered dump fill, used to fill in the wells once they ran dry, and with this latter might be associated some skeletal material from neighboring graves as well as animal bones and other household refuse. If we can accept this conclusion as a working premise, it may furnish some chronological guidance, although the time difference need not be great, when one considers the shallowness of the wells. There are few certain Neolithic finds from the Agora proper, although stone celts and obsidian flakes which may be Neolithic have turned up in a number of miscellaneous contexts, perhaps having travelled far from their original location. This is the case also of the unique marble statuette of a recumbent woman 219, a stray find among the demolition marbles of N-Q 19-22, which has probably worked down from the northwest corner of the Acropolis. Although its location tells us nothing, it is of rare importance as proof of settlement at a somewhat earlier period than indicated by the wells.6 A few Neolithic sherds have turned up in miscel- laneous contexts (36, 48, 66). The two prehistoric fills associated with ancient roads (E-G 2-4 and O-Q 16-17), which are discussed below (pp. 52, 113), produced nothing that is distinctively Neolithic; there are some coarse and nondescript sherds below the Middle Helladic stratum, 4 J. Lawrence Angel, Hesperia, XIV, 1945, p. 291, pl. XLI, 1, pp. 292-293, pl. XLI, 3, 4, 5. 5 Suggested to me by Lucy Talcott on the analogy of whole pots in later classical wells. Against this theory, however, is the occurrence of such jars in wells which were apparently not completed (e.g. T 26:4 which yielded 2 and 5). 6 See below, pp. 16f. 2</page><page sequence="20">DEPOSITS but these may well be Early Helladic. The early grave in the Metroon drain-cut (I 9:2) was published by Shear as a Subneolithic burial,7 but it is more likely Middle Helladic and will be discussed in the next section. There is thus no certain evidence for Neolithic occupancy in the Agora proper, but one must assume a settlement on the Northwest Slope not far from the wells. The other main area of Athens which has produced Neolithic material is the South Slope. Here Skias in 1899 had found a prehistoric burial which was at first considered Neolithic but is more probably Middle Helladic.8 Then, in 1922, excavations conducted by the Italian School, under Della Seta and Doro Levi, revealed near the Stoa of Eumenes the foundations of a Neolithic hut of rectilinear or slightly curved plan with a central hearth.9 This was apparently a stratified site with four layers comprising construction fill, use accumulation, destruction, and post-destruction fill, followed by a sterile layer dividing the Neolithic from the Early Hel- ladic. It should therefore be of prime importance in establishing a relative chronology for our wells near the Klepsydra. Unfortunately, however, the resemblances are not close, since painted ware of both Sesklo and Dimini types and their imitations are dominant in the Neolithic hut and almost completely absent in the Agora material.10 Some red and dark burnished mono- chrome ware was also found, but again the similarities are not striking,"l although Milojcic has used this material to assign the Agora biconical jars to his Period III or Late Sesklo period.12 We shall return to this problem when we consider the outside connections and the chronology of the Agora material. In 1923 the Italians continued their excavations on the South Slope by exploring a small grotto with several entrances above the Asklepieion.13 This contained habitation material in part assigned to the beginning of the Bronze Age. Some of the pottery is clearly Early Helladic II with sauceboats and Urfiris ware,14 but much of it is earlier monochrome ware, either coarse or burnished, with lug handles, plastic bands with thumb impressions, etc. not far removed from some of the fragments in our wells.15 Whether it should be termed Neolithic or Early Hel- ladic I is a problem to which we shall return. To such an intermediate position belongs the Neolithic material from the lowest level of the prehistoric area of the North Slope investigated by Hazel Hansen in 1937.16 Recent Greek excavations on the hill slope below the Odeion of Herodes Atticus and in the area of the Asklepieion have uncovered several small Neolithic pits which provide close paral- lels for the Agora Red Burnished jars and for the Coarse ware from our wells.17 7 Hesperia, V, 1936, pp. 20-21. 8 'Ep.

The coarse ware included rims of cooking pots or baking pans like 185 and 186, and bases with grass or straw impressions like 180 and 181. The material from two Neolithic pits below the Odeion of Herodes Atticus excavated by Mrs. Sakelleraki (1955-1960) includes several Red Burnished fragments with pierced lugs and a bowl with vertical ribs like 84. I wish to thank Mr. Travlos and Miss Maro Tsoni for making arrangements for me to see this pottery which is stored in the Fetihe-Tzami (Mosque in Roman Market).

POTTERY (P1s. 1-13) The pottery from the Neolithic wells divides itself into two main classes, fine ware and coarse, with the former coming in general from small or medium-sized pots, the latter from larger storage-containers, cooking pots, and the like. There is, however, no absolute dividing line between the two, and some of the incised ware (especially the scoops and related frag- ments, 111-124) seems to occupy an intermediate position. RED BURNISHED WARE (Pls. 1-5, 68, 69) Of the finer wares, the most characteristic ware and indeed the hallmark of the complex is our Red Burnished class. It occurs in every well, though not always in its best quality, and it is often the only finer ware present. Furthermore, it makes up to a number of fairly complete pots, which as we have suggested above may represent the use fill of the wells. There is no question that it should be considered a local specialty, and this is confirmed by the gray misfired sherd of a biconical jar (84) found in T 26:3. FABRIC AND TECHNIQUE This is a heavy ware with fairly thick walls ranging from ca. 0.005 to 0.01 m. or even thicker in the largest examples (8). The clay is gritty with some sand and impurities,l9 reddish brown in color, usually fired with a gray core. It seems to have been coated by a rather thick red slip on all parts that would be visible.20 The surface ranges in color from a clear orange-red (1, 4) to a darker cherry-red (19), and is sometimes mottled in firing, though usually not on the best and presumably earlier examples. In 5, the mottling, ranging in color from buff to dark gray, looks deliberately produced by the application of coals. In 19 we have quite a different, and probably unintentional, effect with a sharp line of demarcation between a red and a brownish black zone, where the vase was in contact with another pot in the kiln.21 After the application of the slip, and before firing, the pots were burnished with a blunt in- strument and polished with a cloth to achieve a luster, which in the best examples is very 18 Schachermeyr, Die dltesten Kulturen Griechenlands, p. 70, believes that the distribution of Neolithic material on different sides of the Acropolis would lead to the conclusion that the Acropolis itself was occupied, and if so it would have surpassed in size all other Neolithic settlements in the Mediterranean, even Knossos. However, we do not have the lengthy sequence of the Thessalian sites or Knossos represented in our material. 19 Unpublished botanical studies by Dr. Hopf have revealed the use of various seeds for tempering: leguminous seeds in 3 and 8; naked barley (Hordeum vulgare L. var. nudum) in 6, the latter important as up until now its cultivation was not known from Neolithic Greece, and scarcely known in the Bronze Age. See now Appendix, pp. 267-269. 20 The question of an applied or of a technical slip (i.e. one which results by smoothing and working the damp surface) is one on which archaeologists disagree. I have consulted two pottery experts, Frederick R. Matson of Pennsylvania State University and Marie Farnsworth of New York, on a number of technical problems and have profited greatly from their ob- servations. There are, however, cases where they disagree or where one cannot be certain of the exact technical procedure. On the Red Burnished class a separate application of slip seems likely because the deep red color stops abruptly on the interior of biconical jars just below the collar (fragments 13 and 14), nor does it occur under the foot-ring (16). Furthermore, it is apparently related to a Red Slipped class where there are clear traces of a separate application and no burnishing (see some incised ware 104, 112, 113, 114, 117, 118, 119, 122, etc. and some of the finer plain ware 125-127). 21 Restored painting by Piet de Jong, Hesperia, IX, 1940, p. 297, fig. 38. 4</page><page sequence="22">POTTERY: RED BURNISHED WARE high.22 Sometimes a pattern was produced by having the burnishing strokes go obliquely or at right angles and reserving an unburnished area between them, a technique related to a large Pattern Burnished group of the Late Neolithic period, where the patterns are usually confined to a narrow zone and the remainder of the pot uniformly polished.23 Our examples are rather different with a coarser all-over pattern, in one or two cases composed of meandroid or laby- rinthine elements (35 and 36), and they resemble fragments from the Kephala graves on Keos (see below, p. 20). Most of the patterns on our Red Burnished group were produced, however, not by partial burnishing but by the application of a matt white (?) paint, which has flaked off, dulling the originally burnished surface, sometimes only imperceptibly, at other times gouging it out in deep furrows.24 Paint was certainly the source of the elaborate pattern of opposed oblique lines framed by vertical and horizontal bands on 9, for these are dull rather than shiny and there- fore the negative effect of a true pattern burnishing. It is likely that more traces of white paint survived at the time of excavation, for Shear25 comments on the fact that "linear de- corations made by white painted stripes are fairly well preserved" on our 1 and 2, whereas today only the pattern is perceptible, and that barely so on 1. On 19 a design of oblique lines can be detected only within the brown reduced area where the bowl was in contact with another pot.26 These occurrences show the fugitive and elusive nature of the white paint and thus make any separation of the Red Burnished ware into Plain, Painted or Pattern Burnished a risky business. We have accordingly grouped them all together with the exception of a few small fragments on which the painted design rather than the vase-shape is important (87- 92).27 The interiors of some biconical jars (7 and 8 for example) show that they were built up by hand coilwise, and they still bear traces of thumb impressions, and some horizontal scoring with a blunt instrument. Bases, lug handles, etc. were added separately. On several of the larger examples with a flattened base (6 and 8) there are traces of a mat impression, which would suggest a relatively late horizon and the anticipation of the slow wheel.28 SHAPES There are two main shapes: the biconical or ovoid jar and the hemispherical or shallow bowl. Among the examples of each there are differences which suggest a stylistic development.29 The biconical jars which we presume to be of the earlier type are more clearly biconical in shape, 22 In only one or two examples (20 and less certainly 21) do we seem to be dealing with a real glaze, i.e. a slip which fires to a naturally glossy surface (for this distinction see Caskey, Hesperia, XXVII, 1958, p. 137, note 22). In both cases the sherds are roughly rectangular in shape and show wear on one or two edges, having been deliberately cut down for use as burnishers. They might thus be considered relics of a somewhat earlier period, as their Urfirnis surface would indicate. 23 E.g. Orchomenos, II, pls. X, XII, 1, c, e, f (gray or black); Prosymna, II, fig. 635 (Red Burnished). 24 Professor Matson has examined these vases carefully and is of the opinion that paint was the source of the dulling of the surface. He likens the eating away of the surface of 12, 27, etc. to the effect of Scotch tape when peeled from a painted surface. 25 Hesperia, IX, 1940, p. 298. 26 Apparently the paint adhered better on the area that was reduced; this explanation seems preferable to the possibility of the design being a "ghost" from the adjacent pot. 27 87 might perhaps have been better grouped with the Red Burnished open bowls (19-55), but for the others (88-91) the uniqueness of the pattern and the smallness of the sherd justify our separation, even though there is no separation in technique. 28 6 only clearly shows traces of a mat impression, which however does not approach the regularity or complexity of those on Early Cycladic (Phylakopi, pl. VI). 29 Since we do not have a stratified sequence nor do our wells provide a chronological sequence, our observations on stylistic evolution must be regarded as tentative. They are based primarily on the premise of artistic decline at the end of the Neolithic period, and this seems supported by the comparative material from Kephala, Palaia Kokkinia, Aegina and the cave at Patissia (see below, pp. 8f.) which does not exactly parallel our finest examples and which is certainly close to the beginning of the Early Cycladic period. There seems no good reason to doubt that the best Red Burnished biconical jars are earlier, and the real problem is how much earlier (see below, p. 21). 5</page><page sequence="23">NEOLITHIC PERIOD: INTRODUCTION have a straight low collar and a ring foot of about equal height (1-4). Ornamental lug handles are set on opposite sides of the shoulders and their double piercings are usually matched with corresponding pairs of holes in the ring base (1, 2, 3). The characteristic form of lug is an elongated horizontal, with two vertical piercings and two depending vertical ridges (the "inverted U-attachment") seen on 1, 3, 7, 12 and 13. It assumes its most elaborate form on 4 where there are two horizontally pierced lugs set one above the other and con- nected by vertical ridges each pierced four times horizontally. This is a unique example, but the type with inverted U-attachments is exactly matched elsewhere in Athens (see above, note 17), and has some affinity to lugs on some of the Late Neolithic material from the Kephala graves on Keos (see below, p. 8). A further development of the biconical jar apparently produced a more ovoid shape with flat or slightly concave base (6, 8, 10, 18) and protruding tubular lugs pierced horizontally (5) which develop into regular ribbon handles (8). Although the red burnish remains good on some (10), it is often mottled in firing (8) or thin (5), and it rarely attains the high even luster of the presumably earlier shape. Furthermore, painted patterns are rare. No. 9 is an exception to this statement, but it does not exactly fit into this later group. It is more angular than the others, has a lower rim, loop handles set from rim to shoulder, and an excellent deep red burnished surface, on which an elaborate pattern (see drawing, P1. 69) of opposed oblique lines set off by horizontals and bounded by vertical panels on either side of the handles is just barely detectable. No. 6 also stands outside the main line of development. It is large and coarse with a dull burnished slip, and has horizontal lugs pierced vertically at the widest part of the body, two sets of stringholes in the collar rim above the handles, and traces of a mat impression on the flattened base. It seems to connect with the Coarse ware pithoi and baking pans, and is almost certainly ery late in the series. The Red Burnished bowls are mostly of a simple hemispherical shape with a flattened or lightly concave base (19, 52, 53), in one case only (55) with a developed conical foot. The best preserved and most elegant example is 19 with a tapering and slightly flaring lip, which occurs also with even more flare on 23. Many bowls are deeper, quite large and more strictly hemi- spherical in shape, sometimes with a lug pierced horizontally (28-30), which develops into a real handle on the shallower bowl 31 and into a horizontally set loop handle on 32. Some were decorated with painted patterns of oblique parallel lines, etc. (19 and 27) which relate them to the biconical jars. Other examples are more straight-walled, and in two cases (33-34) are decorated with applied ridges which recall the lug-attachments of the jars (1, 3, 7, etc.). In another (37) the wall is lightly concave with flaring lip and the remnants of a handle-attach- ment. Other bowls (39-43) are shallower with incurved rim, in at least one case of a shape which would normally be ascribed to the Early Helladic period'.30 The carinated bowls (44-47) with outturned lip, while not numerous, sometimes attain great elegance as in 47 with its delicately profiled ribbon handle with a slight knob at the bottom suggestive of a metallic derivation. Such is also true of the fragmentary bowl with offset collar-neck and slightly flaring rim (48) which closely parallels the shape of one of the gold bowls from Euboia in the Benaki Museum.31 At any rate, with some of our Red Burnished bowls we seem already to have entered a Chalcolithic horizon. Other shapes present in Red Burnished are less easily identified because of their rarity and the fragmentary nature of the material. The fruitstand is, however, certain, because of two base 30 Cf. the bowl from the First Meter Deposit at Eutresis (Eutresis, p. 84, pl.

One (66) is almost cylindrical and preserved to its full height, the other (57), a mere fragment, has clear traces of two triangular cutouts like those found on fruitstands and spit supports from Thessaly and Central Greece in the Late Neolithic period.32 A bowl fragment with flaring wall and lip drawn up to a point (59) may well come from a fruitstand of well- known Thessalian B type, although it could be from a related bowl type with flat bottom.33 More enigmatic are the fragments of enormous ribbon handles (60-64) for which we have little comparative material. They range in width from 0.06 to over 0.10 m. (60), an example which curves at both ends and preserves the stump of a strut on its unburnished concave side.34 Another type seems to be sharply bent or folded (62-64), in one case with three horned pro- tuberances at the top. It seems likely that 62-63 belong to one handle, 63 being part of the folded apex, 62 near the lower attachment to a curving rim (P1. 5 for reconstruction).35 Parallels to these handles occur in the Coarse ware to be discussed below. Small fragments of knobs or feet suggest other shapes: 65 is apparently the truncated foot, probably one of three, from a large closed pot which would thus have had affinities with the Troy I and Anatolian tripod-footed pots.36 On the other hand, 66 seems to be the knob from a large lid; 67 and 68 are less easily diagnosed. DECORATION The only decoration, as we have seen, consists of ornamental lugs, plastic ridges, and fugitive traces of painted patterns (probably originally in matt white) or occasional examples of pattern-burnishing (35). On the whole, the patterns are rather careless and amorphous, and can hardly have improved the appearance of such satisfying shapes as 1 and 19. They consist mostly of opposed groups of parallel lines, which cover the whole vase in an untectonic way (the pattern can be made out in the photographs of 2 and 27). There is a general resem- blance to the incised patterns of Early Cycladic, where however the design is usually better organized.37 The tectonic arrangement of 9, where the decoration is confined to the shoulder and takes account of the handle positions, is exceptional. Other motives, used more sparingly, are the interlocking squares of 35 and 36, and the tangent S-quirk of 88, which we have classified under Painted ware. In their meandroid and spiral affinities these last examples show connections with the Late Neolithic Dimini culture. AFFINITIES As our most important and characteristic group, Red Burnished has received a detailed analysis; furthermore its dating is difficult. At first glance it bears a superficial resemblance to the A 1 Red Monochrome ware, which is now dated to the Middle Neolithic period.38 These resemblances are, however, confined to a very few simple shapes, notably the ovoid or biconical jar and the hemispherical bowl, and even here the shapes do not coincide exactly, for the jars lack our characteristic lugs and stringholes, and the bowls usually have a raised base.39 32 D.S., pls. 10, 30 (B 3 p ware); Orchomenos, II, pi. II, 3 and stand with triangular cutouts mentioned by Weinberg, Hesperia, VI, 1937, p. 502, note 2.

If so, it would be a unique example in Red Burnished ware. 35 Although they come from two wells not very close together, they agree remarkably in fabric and width. 36 Troy, I, Type C 34, pp. 72, 102, fig. 230 (35.539); also Thermi, pls.

It is rarely decorated, except occasionally by applied pellets of clay, but there is a related class (A 3a) with patterns in matt white which are simplified versions of the A 3 p Red-on-White Sesklo ware.40 Despite these striking differences, Milojcic has assigned the Agora Red Burnished jars to his Period III (advanced Sesklo) and considers them "beautiful products of the old Chaironeia folk." For confirmation of this early date he uses the stratification of the Neolithic Hut on the South Slope where Sesklo ware fragments were found in the lower strata.41 This conclusion does not seem tenable because of the obviously late features which occur in our repertory of shapes, notably fruitstands with cutouts, bowls with pulled up rim, wide folded ribbon handles, all of which have affinities with the B wares of the Dimini period. Furthermore, the more complicated painted and burnished patterns of a few pieces, such as the incipient spiral and the meandroid elements of 35, 36 and 88, point to the same horizon. The dating of our biconical jars was complicated by the fact that until recently no close parallels had been found for our elaborate lugs with inverted U-attachments. These have now been found in identical form in a Neolithic pit near the Asklepieion and in a related form on one of the burial jars from the Kephala cemetery on Keos.42 The latter is most significant in suggesting the chronological range and cultural relations of our biconical jars. Although all too little is known about the Cyclades in the Late Neolithic period, one may suggest that our Red Burnished class shows new elements coming from this direction at the end of the Neolithic period, perhaps amalgamating with an older indigenous Red Burnished class which may have been the descendant of A 1 Red Mono- chrome.43 A Late Neolithic and Cycladic-oriented horizon is suggested by two other sites in Attica which have yielded a related, but not identical, Red Burnished ware in company with Early Cycladic imports. One is the site of Palaia Kokkinia near Peiraeus which produced Red Monochrome hemispherical bowls with concave bases and heavy vertical lug handles along with fragments of very early Early Cycladic pyxides and frying pans.44 This is obviously a some- what later complex than our wells, and to such an intermediate period should be assigned a group of vases found accidentally in March, 1964 in a cave near Patissia, where likewise Cycladic elements were present although in less canonical Early Cycladic form.45 40 For the more complicated shapes in Red Monochrome see P. T., p. 87, fig. 40, c, f, h and Holmberg, Neol. Pot., pp. 16f., pl. V, 1. For the painted patterns see P.T., pp. 89, 92, figs. 42, a, 44, a; Naissance, I, figs. 220-222. 41 V.

The presumed parallels with the South Slope Hut material are probably to Levi, Abitazioni, pp. 439-440, fig. 25, b-d and especially fig. 26, which, however, is described (p. 494) as coarse monochrome "bruno-caffe." In our opinion the closest published parallel to the Agora biconical jars is the fragment (fig. 25, d) which is described as "levigato in rosso cupo" and comes from the fill of the Hut, namely the fourth or top stratum, directly beneath the sterile layer separating it from Early Helladic. 42 For the parallels from the Neolithic pit near the Asklepieion, see above, note 17. The Kephala example is unpublished but was shown me in 1964 by J. L. Caskey. It is a large mottled Red Burnished jar, used for the burial of a small infant, and had two horizontal lugs doubly pierced, from which depend three ridges, the outer ones longer than the central ones. These were set on opposite sides of the shoulder and were matched with vertical ribbon loop handles, like those of 8, on the belly. 43 The preference for lug handles (perhaps from an area where stone vases were prevalent), the skeuomorphic arrangement of the painted patterns, and a general resemblance to Early Cycladic Red Burnished pyxides (Cyclades, figs. 59-60, 63-64, 67, 71-72) suggest Cycladic affinities, although our material must be somewhat earlier than the beginning of Early Cycladic. The Neolithic period on the Cyclades is only beginning to be recognized; the excavations at Kephala on Keos have contributed much. Note the occurrence of an early stone vase with pierced lugs in one of the graves (Hesperia, XXXI, 1962, pl. 92, d, p. 265), the proto-Cycladic terracotta head discussed below (p. 17, note 92), etc. The recent excavations of Colin Renfrew on Saliagos near Antiparos (Antiquity, XL, 1966, pp. 87, 218-219) should shed further light on the period. Mr. Renfrew spent considerable time going through the Agora material for Cycladic connections, and I have profited from discussions with him. 44 npaKIKic, 1951 (1952), pp. 102ff., figs. 8-14, which compare closely with our hemispherical bowls 19, 28, 29, 40, 52, 53.

See now also the comparable Red Burnished pottery from Thorikos (Thorikos, 1965, III, pp. 25-29). 45 These were brought by the Archaeological Service for cleaning and mending to the Stoa of Attalos, where they were seen by the author. 8</page><page sequence="26">POTTERY: GRAY OR BLACK BURNISHED WARE Accordingly, we reject a Middle Neolithic or Late Sesklo date for our Red Burnished jars and feel that they belong to the end of the Neolithic period at a time when new impulses from the East, traveling across the Cyclades, were to introduce the Copper or Bronze Age.46 Such a conclusion is bore out by the metallic shapes of certain bowls and handles (47 and 48) and the near Early Helladic profile of the bowl with incurved rim (43). Furthermore, this is the horizon suggested by the rest of the material from the wells, and although the intact jars may represent a use fill, as we have suggested, the interval between them and the dump fill can scarcely have been the millennium that intervenes between Late Sesklo and the end of the Neolithic period.47 GRAY OR BLACK BURNISHED WARE (Pls. 6, 69) This ware forms only a small proportion of the material, and with few exceptions (84, mis- fired example of biconical jar like 5, etc.) is totally different from Red Burnished in shapes and decoration. Furthermore, aside from a small group of distinctive fluted fragments (70-75), there is no great homogeneity among the material. TECHNIQUE All fragments are gray throughout, and therefore the color is the result of firing in a reducing kiln. The surface is usually burnished, and in only a few cases (72, 76, 82) does the color seenl to have been enhanced by the application of a carboniferous substance.48 Some fragments are thinner-walled and finer than any examples in our Red Burnished group (see especially 72, 76, 79 and 80). SHAPES Only three shapes can be recognized: a deep open bowl (77-78), a shallow pot with offset collar rim (70), and a low bowl or plate with rim rolled inward (81) or thickened and pulled out to a point (82). The bowl profiles are different from those of Red Burnished, being steeper (78) or straight-walled (77) and in one case with a high splaying lip (76). The pot with offset collar rim (70) occurs in the most complete of the fluted ware fragments, and is probably represented in the others (71-75). Here there is a parallel among the Red Burnished bowls, namely 48 for which a metallic prototype has been noted. In the present group both shape and decoration suggest a Chalcolithic horizon. The small Gray ware ribbon handle (79) reminds one of the Neolithic Gray ware from Corinth; if this parallel is valid, it would be considerably earlier than the rest of this class.49 DECORATION There is a unique sherd with fine incision (80) which seems to belong here rather than with the larger group of coarser incised ware (101-124). Otherwise the only decoration is the fluted or reeded treatment of the surface of the group 70-75. On the finest example (72), where the surface has an obsidian-like brilliance, the flutes are very sharp and a deep groove sets off the junction of neck and shoulder. The same treatment, but more blurred, is used on 70, 71 and 73. On 74 and 75 blunt incisions with flat planes between give a reeded rather than 46 This is also the opinion of Saul Weinberg (C.A.H., I, Ch. X, p. 49), and I have been aided by his suggestions. 47 Holmberg's chronology (Neol. Pot., p. 38) would give an interval of 1200 years, from 4200 to 3000 B.C. 48 For the latest discussion of Neolithic Black Burnished, see E. Holmberg, "The Appearance of Neolithic Black Burnished Ware in Mainland Greece," A.J.A., LXVIII, 1964, pp. 843-348 and S.

The flutes are generally vertical or slightly oblique, but on 74 there is an op- posed group of diagonals at the right. AFFINITIES This ware, probably imported for the most part, is important in suggesting the chronological range of our deposits. No. 82 has been recognized as a Western Anatolian import by David French, who has shown its close affinities to Kumtepe I b and to the earliest subphase of Troy I.50 No. 81 should also come from a Kumtepe I b bowl, of a type also found on the North Slope, some of which have broad horizontally pierced lug handles.51 The color of these is mottled brown to black. The other sherds resemble more generally the Gray and Black Burnished wares of Central and Northern Greece referred to by the designations Larissa (Milojcic and Grundmann) or r la (Tsountas and Wace-Thompson). Although certainly current at the end of the Dimini period and just prior to the beginning of the Bronze Age, these wares are not entirely Chal- colithic, and their first appearance must go back to the beginning of the Late Neolithic period,52 if indeed not earlier. Our material is unstratified and much too scanty to contribute anything to the chronological debate. It is our opinion, however, that apart from the Gray ware sherds (79 and 80) and the nondescript hemispherical bowl fragment (78) our fragments are late and probably Chalcolithic, with Anatolian parallels for the fluted ware. Exact parallels for this distinctive group are hard to find, but it is certainly related to the Thessalian r la3 "rip- pled or ribbed ware" and the ribbed ware from Servia in Macedonia.53 A bowl with collar neck similar in shape to our 70 occurs in black Pattern Burnished ware at Orchomenos, and seems to continue into the latest stage of Neolithic in the burial urns at Soufli Magoula in Thessaly.54 None of these, however, gives quite the same sense of elegance conveyed by our finest fragments, which in shape and to a lesser extent in decoration call to mind the gold and silver bowls in the Benaki Museum, which are almost certainly Anatolian imports to Euboia at the beginning of the Copper Age.55 The implication of these metallic prototypes for dating our Agora Neolithic material will be discussed more fully below (pp. 20-21). PAINTED WARES (Pls. 7, 69) The paucity of painted ware from the Agora deposits is striking and contrasts markedly with the material from the Neolithic Hut on the South Slope excavated by the Italians, where Late Sesklo Red-on-White painted ware occurred in the lower strata, and with it later Matt- painted and polychrome Dimini-type ware, which predominate in the upper strata.56 Whether 50 David French, "Late Chalcolithic Pottery in North-West Turkey and the Aegean," Anat.

Even the reeded pattern of 74 recalls the pattern of verticals framing diminishing triangles on the gold bowl no. 1 (pls. 1-3). A similar fluting is also found on the black polished ware pyxides from Towns I-II at Thermi on Lesbos (Thermi, pi. VIII, 10, 98, 138). 56 Levi, Abitazioni, pp. 438ff., figs. 29-31, 34-37, pl.

Pot., p. 18, who summarizes Miloj&amp;i6's division into Sesklo I, II, and III). 10</page><page sequence="28">POTTERY: WHITE SLIPPED WARE these Sesklo-related sherds represent dump-fill in the construction of the Hut or whether a Late Sesklo-type pottery was still in vogue during the occupation of the Hut is not clear from the publication. Its main occupancy, however, seems to belong to the Late Neolithic period in which Mattpainted and the various B 3 wares were in vogue.57 There is nothing really comparable in our material. Our main decorated ware was, as we have seen, the Red Burnished with patterns painted in a fugitive matt white, which has mostly flaked off. These were discussed above, p. 7, but here are cited five additional fragments on which the design or the paint is better preserved (87-91): 87, a fragment of a very fine little bowl with indrawn but flaring lip, has a neat pattern of horizontal and vertical lines; 88, from a closed pot, has a connected band of S-quirks on the shoulder above parallel oblique lines; 89-91 have a pattern of horizontals and verticals vaguely recalling brickwork. Of these, the incipient spiral of 88 is important and may confirm the gen- erally late date and Cycladic affinities of our material. One unique sherd (86) of Red-on-White painted ware appears to come from a considerably earlier phase. Technically, it differs greatly from the rest of our sherds, for it was covered with a thick creamy white slip on which the design has been painted in orange-red, presumably with a multiple brush, after which the whole was polished. Coming from a closed pot, it bears a neat pattern of opposed parallel diagonals, which do not cross or abut to form the typical zigzag pattern of Chaironeia ware; instead they interlock and give the impression of an overall skeuomorphic pattern. The closest parallel we have found is a fragment of a Red-on-White ware jug from Sotira on Cyprus. The resemblance may be fortuitous, but its date would accord bet- ter with the rest of our material than would the much earlier Chaironeia ware.58 One typical sherd of Neolithic Mattpainted ware (93) bears a pattern in black on a buff ground, of elongated triangles depending from two horizontal bands. Coming from the shoulder of a small closed pot, it has parallels both at Orchomenos and in the Hut on the South Slope.59 The other sherds with dark paint on a buff ground (94-97), and in one case red on a gray burnished slip (98), are too scrappy and nondescript to classify exactly, but all seem to belong to the B 3 classification. In no case, however, do we have polychrome or typical Dimini dec- oration. The fact that everything from our wells with even a trace of red or black painted dec- oration was catalogued, and that the total adds up to merely eight sherds, suggests that the widespread Late Neolithic painted wares were no longer popular in the context of our deposits, although they were in the Hut on the South Slope. The chronological implications of this will be discussed below (pp. 19-20). WHITE SLIPPED WARE (Pls. 7, 69) Two small fragments (99-100) plus a few more sherds (e.g. P 13980) of this distinctive fabric occur in our wells. The ware is thin and covered with a hard creamy slip which is less white and more permanent than on the typical E.H. II White Slipped and Polished ware which occurs exclusively in our Middle Helladic deposits. Thus there seems to be no possible confusion in context. No. 99 is from a small fairly high flaring foot decorated with incised lines at right angles framing a panel filled with fine incised dots, a pattern which may be related to one group of the B 2 wares.60 No. 100 is from the rim of a straight-walled bowl and shows two neatly bored holes which may be mendholes. 57 For a brief discussion of the subdivision of the Late Neolithic painted wares with an account of the Arapi, Otzaki, and Classic Dimini terminology of Miloj6i6, see Holmberg, Neol.

All are characterized by a thin red to brown slip with clear traces of the burnishing tool. Nos. 101 and 102 are decorated on the wall with parallel diagonal lines incised with a blunt tool; 103 and 104 are decorated on the rim only with a pattern of parallel zigzags or filled triangles.61 There is no trace of white filling in the incisions. SCOOP FRAGMENTS Only generally related to the above is a much larger group of fragments (111-124) character- ized by blunt or grooved incision, sometimes taking on curvilinear or meandroid forms and apparently covering the whole surface. The fragments are small of rather heavy gritty clay, often with traces of a red slip; they consist of enigmatic shapes, such as "legs" and frag- ments of double curvature, which at first defied classification.62 Through the realization that 111 was part of the branching strut of a broad-handled scoop like that found by Tsountas at Sesklo, and here illustrated again,63 the other fragments began to fall into place as parts of similar scoops, coming from the struts (111-116), the broad ribbon handle (116, 120, 121), the bowl (117), or the flaring base (123), of four or five different examples.64 Until very recently the scoop from Sesklo was a unique piece. It was found unstratified on the side of the mound, and assigned by Tsountas to his Thessalian B period, because of its general affinities with a group of B 2 incised vases with decoration composed of spiral and meandroid elements and thus loosely associated with the Dimini-type painted wares.65 It has now been joined not only by our Agora fragments but by several more nearly complete examples from the Kephala graves on Keos.66 None of our Agora fragments preserves any trace of burnishing or of white filling in the incisions, both of which are found on the Sesklo scoop; otherwise our finest fragments agree with it remarkably well in style, and the same may be said of the handle fragment from Keos. Furthermore, both in Athens and in Keos we seem to have some inferior imitations, for the restored Kephala scoop and our fragments 120 and 123 are noticeably simpler. The greater number of examples from Athens and Keos certainly raises the question of non- Thessalian origin for the Sesklo scoop, although it is the finest piece of the lot and does have a close association with a larger group of Late Thessalian incised ware. At any rate, the presence of this rare shape in southeast Thessaly, in the Cyclades and in Attica is proof of their close intercommunication in the Late Neolithic period. 61 They bear a general resemblance to the Late Neolithic incised ware from Prosyuna (Prosymna, II, fig. 627), without furnishing very close parallels. 62 Philip Auerbach, a member of the Keos excavations in 1961, first suggested that scoops were represented in our Neolithic material, while he was examining it for possible parallels with the vases from Kephala. 63 D.S., pl. 16, 3. Cf. Naissance, II, figs. 383-384. Our photographs were taken by James Heyle through the kindness of the National Museum. 64 In view of the rarity of this shape, it may be worthwhile to speculate on the number of examples represented in our fragments. Our thirteen fragments from six different wells seem to divide into four or five different groups: 1) an excellent group composed of 111, 11, 114, 116, 117, 119 and 121 which approaches the Sesklo scoop in elaboration of design; 2) a smaller and rather debased imitation represented by fragments 120 and 128; 3) two fragments (112 and 118) with less deeply incised and more curvilinear decoration; 4) the coarse strut 115 which seems to come from a larger example; and 5) the less certain example 122. (124 is certainly not from a scoop but related in technique and style.) This should yield a total of at least four, and probably several more, examples, for of the finest group only four (111, 116, 117 and 121) are homogeneous enough to assign to one example, even though they come from three different wells situated in the same general area (T 26). 65 D.S., cols. 206-207. For the related ware, see Naissance, II, figs. 379-381. Holmberg distinguishes between an Otzaki and a Classical Dimini phase in the incised ware and assigns the scoop from Sesklo to the former (Neol. Pot., p. 31, pl. XIV, 2). 66 The Kephala graves have now produced a fine handle (Grave X, inv. 2, Hesperia, XXXI, 1962, p. 265, pl. 92, f), a more or less complete example (Grave XX, inv. 10, Hesperia, XXXIII, 1964, pl. 46, e, f), and "fragments of several others" (ibid., p. 316). 12</page><page sequence="30">POTTERY: FINE UNDECORATED AND COARSE WARES That the vase shape was actually a scoop for grain, as Tsountas suggested, seems doubtful, for the base would be awkward. Furthermore the Sesklo example preserves clear traces of black discoloration, as if from burning, at the base and inside the bowl, both of which are very thick.66a There is also a row of diamond perforations along the top of the bowl and down the center of the broad ribbon handle (found also on our 120 and 121). Such holes, along with the blackening, suggest a brazier or incense burner, more ritual than practical. Both Caskey and Holmberg have noted a resemblance of the scoop shape to the curious four-legged vessels from Elateia and Corinth, which Weinberg has shown derive from a class of Jugoslav cult vessels datable to Vin6a A.67 Although dating to a late stage of the Middle Neolithic, they continued in a brownish ware with curvilinear incisions into the Late Neolithic period, and these later examples are thus not far removed in time from our scoops. The location of the Kephala examples in tombs suggests a religious significance (and in this connection one should not forget that skeletal material in our wells might likewise connote disturbed burials). In brief, a ritual rather than a practical function seems most likely for the scoops. A small group of incised sherds with simple angular patterns (105-110) bears no relation to the group we have just discussed but seems rather to be an inferior version of the group 101-104. FINE UNDECORATED WARE (Pls. 9, 69) A small group fits into none of the above categories, the ware being fine and slipped, but not burnished or otherwise decorated. In 125-127 there are clear traces of a red slip, in 128 it was white, and in 129 it seems to be merely the buff technical slip of the fabric. The charming diminuitive whole pot, 125, seems to be the latest evolutionary stage of our Red Burnished biconical jars. It has acquired a piriform shape with a continuous flaring foot, a wider mouth and two small horizontally pierced lugs on the shoulder. It is a well-made miniature with close parallels in the Red Burnished or slipped ware from Palaia Kokkinia and perhaps in the Cyclades.68 No. 127, the fragment of a small spoon with straight handle, has a good parallel in the complete spoon from Early Helladic Lerna (Lerna III).69 Whether such terracotta spoons antedate the beginning of the Bronze Age is uncertain; the fragment of a larger specimen from Sesklo is apparently unstratified.70 COARSE WARE (Pls. 9-13, 69) Next to the Red Burnished, the largest proportion of material from our Neolithic wells consists of Coarse ware. Indeed these two classes make up to 90-95%, of the total, which is suggestive of the local origin of both. The Coarse ware is thicker, has considerably more grit and tempering material (in some cases chopped straw or chaff), is usually only wet-smoothed, and rarely shows any applied slip or burnishing. Few shapes can be made up, although the two wide-mouthed bowls 171-172 were found virtually intact and may come from the use fills of their respective wells. Despite the fragmentary nature of most of the material, many pieces show interesting decorative treatments and unusual handles, which enable the ware to be compared 66a The scoop was examined outside the case in 1964 through the courtesy of Mrs. Sakellariou. 67 S.

T., p. 73. 18</page><page sequence="31">NEOLITHIC PERIOD: INTRODUCTION with Late Neolithic to Early Helladic pottery from other sites. The following classification is based on type of decoration. INCISED WARE A number of heavy fragments, mostly rim or wall pieces of large open jars or pithoi, bear fairly elaborate incised decoration, applied either directly to the surface or to a raised band (132, 133, 136, 137). This consists for the most part of opposed parallel oblique lines, which are arranged in bands of interlocking triangles (131-134) or simpler zigzags (136-137). The incision varies from the very sharp and neat (130-133) to a broader grooved (134-135) or careless and scratchy (136-138) treatment. We now have some idea of what these pithoi must have looked like as a result of the Kephala excavations on Keos, where they were sometimes used as burial jars. Here two types were in vogue: a large bulbous jar with collar neck and a wide-mouthed type with straight upper wall tapering toward the flattened bottom.71 At Kephala the decoration consisted primarily of plastic bands with thumbmarks, and incised decoration was rare and inferior to that on our best fragments.72 Although the closest parallel to our fragment with the raised band and alter- nating hatched triangles (132) occurs on several large pithos fragments from Troy II (where the motive occurs in a more elaborate context),73 it seems hardly necessary to postulate so late a date for the simpler occurrence.74 IMPRESSED WARE Another decorative treatment resulted from impressing the wet surface with a series of short strokes made by a sharp tool (139-143). The pattern was usually arranged in one or more horizontal or curving bands, and was in one case (143) combined with regular incision. Sometimes the tool was pushed in vertically, leaving the impression of its circular (144 and 148) or triangular section (145 and 146); in one case (147) a thumbnail was clearly the tool. Some of the impressed ware fragments come from thick-walled pots or pithoi (142-148), but a smaller pyxoid bowl with incurved rim (139-141) also occurs.75 RELIEF-DECORATED WARE Eight fragments, all except one (154) from large heavy pithoi, bear relief decoration of applied strips or pinched out ridges, not treated plastically by thumbmarks but left plain. These bands are usually arranged in an angular fashion, as verticals, horizontals, diagonals, or in combi- nation, but in one case (153) a rudimentary spiral occurs, which suggests Dimini affinities. This ware is matched closely among sherds from the Cave of Pan near Marathon, where the spiral as well as the crossing diagonals of 160 also occurs; it is also found in Thessaly among the B and r wares.76 On 167 the decoration is produced differently, namely by impressing with a circular implement from the back and causing bosses to stand out in relief.77 71 Hesperia, XXXIII, 1964, p. 316, pl. 46, h, i. 72 Ibid., pl. 47, a. 73 Troy, I, p. 237, fig. 411, 37.998, 37.999. 74 The motive itself is common on both Pattern Burnished and Incised ware in the Late Neolithic period (Orchomenos, II, pls. X, 1, b, e, g, VI, 1, b, IX, 4) and raised bands with incised or plastic decoration occur in the First Meter Deposit at Eutresis (Eutresis, p. 88, fig. 109). Cf. also Hesperia, XXIX, 1960, p. 145: "numerous fragments of very large storage jars ... top of rim with bands of incised hatching and a row of punched circles. Fragments with applied plastic strips or bands." (Group IV, E.H.I). 75 The shape is surprisingly like one found in the Neolithic Gray ware from Corinth (Hesperia, VI, 1937, p. 510, figs. 26- 27) where even the nicking of the rim of 139 is found; however, ours is a coarser ware, and from its context should be later. 76 Cave of Pan: Naissance, II, figs. 834-836.

The wide-mouthed, straight-walled type occurs in the rim fragments (169, 161-164), several of which have horizontal or arched lugs slightly below the rim. An alternative form with slightly indrawn mouth and vertical loop handle is represented by 160, but there is no certain indication of the collared type found at Kephala.78 The bands are nicked with horizontal or diagonal gouges (168, 169, 160, 164, 166, 170), impressed with a circular tool (162, 163, 169), or crimped with the thumb like piecrust (161, 166, 167, 168). All give the general impression of ropes bound around the jars. Some run obliquely to the lugs or handles, while others are in a parallel or right-angled arrangement (165, 167). Such plastic bands imi- tative of ropework are common in Early Helladic contexts, but they also occur in the Late Neolithic period, where they are often more elaborate and have closer resemblances to ours.79 UNDECORATED Very few shapes can be reconstructed, and some of the handles included in this group may well belong with the decorated pithos fragments discussed above. We have evidence for: wide-mouthed deep bowls or cooking pots (171-174), shallower bowls with inturned rim or carinated shoulder (176-177), an open saucer (178), flat baking pans tempered with chaff and sometimes having internal lugs and stringholes below the rim (180-182,184-188),80 fragments of pithoi, in one case with four vertical dashes which may be a numeral (183), and many coarse handles of both vertical ribbon and horizontal lug varieties. The latter occur in many forms, some of which are paralleled in the Thessalian r 3 wares: the projecting horizontal ledge with rounded corners (199-200), with downturned edges making an inverted U (201), with semicircular indentation (202) or with thumbhole (203). The vertical rib- bon handles have closer affinities with our Red Burnished ware, particularly in the few coarse equivalents to the large folded handles (206-206); however, in many of these vertical handles the addition of a plastic knob (189, 194, 196) or vertical grooving (193, 196, 207, 208) sug- gests a Chalcolithic horizon. Once again the Kephala graves have provided helpful parallels: 196 is similar to the "elephant-head" lugs and 206-207 resemble some unpublished examples.81 Furthermore, this material has shown that the same pithos could be equipped with both horizontal lugs and ribbon handles.82 The horned handles, 204-205, suggest Thessalian parallels.83 Of the miscellaneous shapes represented by single fragments the following may be noted: a high stand (213) recalling the Red Burnished fruitstands (66-58), a shallow plate or lid (214) which should perhaps be associated with the baking pans as the upper part of an oven, the 78 Hesperia, XXXIII, 1964, pl. 46, h. 79 E.H. examples: Korakou, p. 5, fig. 3, 4; Zygouries, p. 121, fig. 113; Eutresis, p. 111, fig. 147, p. 114, fig. 149 (E.H.

Characteristic among our sherds are the flat bases with straw or grass impressions, perhaps the result of chaff tempering (180-182) (cf. a similar fragment from the Hut on the South Slope, Levi, Abitazioni, p. 435, fig. 22, c), flat wall pieces with stringholes (184-186), and some indication of internal lugs (186-188). We have no clear indication of the cut-down rim found at Eutresis and Asea (Eutresis, p. 107, fig. 141; Asea, p. 56, fig. 58), but our rim fragments are small. A heavy grayish fragment, 215, smoothed inside but roughened and with straw impressions on the base, must be from a pan with thickened rim and sloping sides like Eutresis, p. 108, fig. 142, 1-2. 81 Hesperia, XXXIII, 1964, p. 316, pl. 47, b-d. 82 Ibid., pl. 46, i. 83 D.S., col. 279, figs. 215 (Dimini), 217 (upside down?). 15</page><page sequence="33">NEOLITHIC PERIOD: INTRODUCTION baking pan or basin (215) of alternative form, and the knobs or feet (216 and 217), the latter probably from a tripod-footed pot, the former more likely from the wall of a pithos.84 The general picture conveyed by our Coarse ware is of a somewhat later milieu than was suggested by the fine. Many pieces have parallels in E.H. I, and some even in E.H. II material from other sites. On the other hand, there are equally strong, if not stronger, comparisons with the Late Neolithic Coarse ware from Asea and with that from the Kephala graves on Keos: these would suggest that our material need not be later than the latest Neolithic or the transi- tion to Early Helladic. 3. SCULPTURE AND OTHER ARTIFACTS (Pls. 14-15) SCULPTURE Three examples of Neolithic sculpture have been recognized among the Agora material. One, a large and handsome marble statuette of a reclining woman (219), was found unstratified in the general area of the Eleusinion; the other two (220-221), both of terracotta, came from the Neolithic wells T 26:3 and T 26:6. The statuette85 is important evidence for Neolithic occupation at a period considerably earlier than the fill of our wells. Although her recumbent and twisted position, with head and chest elevated and the lower torso twisted to the right with knees drawn up, is not easily paralleled in other examples, she conforms in general to the well-known nude steatopygous type which was rendered with great fondness and naturalism in the Sesklo period, both in terracotta and, occasionally, in marble. Especially close is the resemblance to a group of seated statuettes with folded legs published by Weinberg.86 These all show an obesity restricted to the area below the waist, and an angular abdominal protrusion, and all have the hands folded across the chest, characteristics which are also to be found on our statuette. She may be compared especially with the marble statuette in the Fitzwilliam Museum which is reported to be from Patissia near Athens.87 In this example, although the surface is less well preserved and the pose less complicated, one may note the same broad square shoulders and folded arms, the overdevel- oped buttocks, and the deep incisions below the abdomen and between the thighs. Because of the fracture of our statuette at the base of the neck we cannot be certain that it had the long neck and undeveloped head which are characteristic of this type. Weinberg has derived the type from the Near East and dated it to the end of the Middle Neolithic period. At the time of his writing (1951) the closest parallels came from Adalia and the Amuq plain and were dated to the end of the Anatolian Chalcolithic period, shortly before Troy I. James Mellaart's recent ex- cavations in the Konya plain at Hacilar and ?atal Hiiyiik have confirmed the general correctness of Weinberg's conclusions, while pushing back the date of such steatopygous figurines by several millennia. Curiously, the closest parallel for the complicated pose of the Agora statuette occurs 84 Cf. Eutresis, p. 88, fig. 110, 2-3 (from First Meter Deposit and therefore E.H. I). 85 Hesperia, VIII, 1939, p. 235, fig. 33, where the statuette is shown upright, although Shear rightly conjectured that "the best interpretation of the pose seems to be that of a figure lying on its stomach." Newer photographs on Plate 14 reveal the complexity of the twisted position: from the front, the right side, above and below. A second fragmentary marble statuette of more conventional type was found by Broneer below the west entrance to the Mycenaean Fountain (Fountain, p. 406, fig. 88). 86 S. Weinberg, A.J.A., LV, 1951, pp. 121-133, pls. 1-3. Also A.J.B. Wace, Hesperia, Suppl. VIII, 1949, pp. 423-426.

Add now the new "Fat Lady of Saliagos" (Antiquity, XL, 1966, pp. 218-219, pl. XXXVI) which Renfrew believes is Late Neolithic. 87 Weinberg, op. cit., pl. 1, C and Naissance, I, fig. 145. 16</page><page sequence="34">ARTIFACTS in a terracotta from Hacilar VI.88 Here a reclining female with pendulous abdomen is portrayed with much the same double twist-shoulders and head raised frontally, hips and thighs turned almost 90 degrees-but the pose is rendered with greater finesse and more naturalistic' transi- tions in the Hacilar example which must nevertheless be considerably older.89 Can we assume that the reclining female type was part of the general repertory of steatopygous figurines in- troduced from Anatolia and the Near East by the bearers of the Old Sesklo culture? In this case our marble statuette would be a late survival of a type otherwise unknown on the Greek mainland. Chronologically it must belong at the end of the Middle Neolithic period, a period attested for Athens by the Sesklo-type pottery found in the construction fill of the Hut on the South Slope. The type, or types, of statuettes current in the later period of the wells on the Northwest Slope are revealed by two small terracottas (220-221), at first not easily recognized as such, one being a head broken off from a good-sized statuette, the other a small but complete figurine. This latter (221), suggestive of a profiled knob but clearly finished at the bottom and with a cuplike hollow underneath, has general affinities to the terracottas from the Thessalian B period at Sesklo, Dimini and Tsangli.90 It also finds a parallel in a crude little figurine from Kephala,91 which is, however, nude and ithyphallic whereas ours seems clearly female and wears a kind of bell-shaped skirt. Points of similarity are the dumpy proportions, the unformed head, and the knoblike arms formed by the application of a roll of clay which encircles the back. The head (220), which must be from a good-sized statuette perhaps 25 to 30 cms. tall, is of considerably greater artistic importance and is also paralleled at Kephala.92 Not only its size but its flatness, simplicity and backward inclination relate it to the well-known class of Early Cycladic marble statuettes.93 At first glance, the only humanized feature is the triangular nose set rather high, but on further scrutiny lightly incised verticals or perforations at either side suggest ears, and remnants of a broken lump at the top of the back may have represented hair or merely the bulge of the cranium. All these features are paralleled on the Kephala head, which is a little coarser, having been made of the local clay. Our head is perforated vertically through the cylindrical neck, and must have been made separately for setting into a statuette. ARTIFACTS A number of stone celts without boring and of the primitive handaxe type were found in the Agora in unstratified contexts. Only one (222), a complete and perfect specimen of dark red stone agreeing in form with Tsountas' Type A,94 is here included, along with two fragmen- tary examples (223 and 224) from Neolithic wells, the former of dark steatite and broken at both ends but apparently of Type B,95 the latter a coarse specimen agreeing in general with 222. No.225, a bored celt of double-hammer or battle-axe type, comes as a surprise in 88 Anat. St., XI, 1961, pp. 56-57, fig. 18, pl. X, b. I am indebted to Professor Machteld Mellink of Bryn Mawr for calling to my attention the occurrence of the same pose in stone in Anatolia: a small'statuette in the Alistair B. Martin Collection in New York which was said to have come from Hacilar and is to be published by her in the forthcoming catalogue of this collection, and secondly a miniature green stone statuette found on the surface at Sukurkent near Hacilar. Both have the same twisted recumbent pose as the Agora statuette. See now Peter J. Ucko, Anthropomorphic Figurines, London, 1968, p. 397, who makes the same Hacilar comparison for the Agora statuette. Steven Diamant brought this book to my attention. 89 Carbon 14 dates give the destruction of Hacilar VI at about 5400 B.c., cf. Anat.

No. 227 is a fragmentary dome-shaped grinder, agreeing with some from E.H. levels at Zygouries,98 but of too simple and widely diffused a form to draw chron- ological or cultural parallels. The same is true of the fragmentary millstones or saddle-querns (228-230) which turn up in several of our Neolithic wells.99 More significant is the occurrence of obsidian. A small matrix (231) and a fragmentary blade (233) were found in S 27:3, a complete blade (232) plus seven additional flakes in U 24:2, and uncatalogued flakes also in T 24:4, T 26:6, U 24: 3, and U 26:5. These represent clear evi- dence of trade connections with the Cyclades, particularly Melos, and supplement the Cycladic parallels, especially to Kephala on Keos, we have noted in the pottery. The contrast with Troy, where only one blade was found in Troy I and two in Troy II,100 is noticeable, especially if one adds to the Agora material the wealth of obsidian found in the Italian excavations on the South Slope.101 The occurrence of obsidian has, however, little chronological significance, since Melian obsidian is found on all the Thessalian sites, even in the earliest strata.102 Two shallow-domed spindle whorls (234-236) and a conical-shaped object of terracotta (236) which may be a heavier whorl, less likely a loomweight, complete our inventory of Neolithic objects. 4. RELATIVE AND ABSOLUTE CHRONOLOGY Our knowledge of the Greek Neolithic period has undergone profound changes in the past decade. With the German excavations of Milojcic at the Thessalian sites of Otzaki, Arapi and Argissa103 and the Greek excavations of Theochares at a number of sites, both old and new,l?4 the picture has become far more complex than the simple division into Thessalian A and B proposed by Tsountas and followed by Wace and Thompson. Not only has the sequence been lengthened considerably by the discovery of preceramic remains and other well-marked ceramic phases that precede the typical Sesklo ware of Tsountas' Thessalian A but the use of radiocarbon dating has shown that Thessaly did not lag far behind the Near East as a center of early village culture. Dates in the sixth millennium for Early Neolithic pottery in Greece are now a possibility. Mellaart's excavations at Hacilar and (atal Hiiyik in central Anatolial05 with their early C-14 dates, steatopygous figurines and a pottery style related to the Sesklo culture have confirmed the bridge whereby this essentially Near Eastern culture travelled to Greece, as 96 Eutresis, pp. 206-207, fig. 278, 6-8 (M.H.).

Weinberg in 1947 proposed a tripartite division into Early, Middle and Late Neolithic and this is followed by Holmberg in his recent monograph.108 If we accept this division as a working hypothesis, our material is confined to a relatively narrow compass, and does not involve us with the first, and scarcely at all with the second, phase. We have nothing from the Agora typical of Early Neolithic with its softly baked Rainbow or "Bunt-Keramik,"l09 or the Proto-Sesklo Early Painted or Pre-Sesklo Barbotine classes of Thessaly, nor do these seem to be present among the Neolithic material from the Hut on the South Slope. Attica, however, should not be ruled out for this early period, since Theochares' excavations at Nea Makri on the east coast near Marathon have revealed a fine collection of Early Neolithic pottery, both Rainbow and Black Monochrome, some with white-filled incisions paralleled in the Early Chalcolithic from Mersin.110 Some Early Neolithic is also found in the Cave of Pan near Marathon, partially excavated by Papademetriou in 1957.111 The position of Nea Makri on the east coast may indicate the direction from which these early settlers came.12 From the Middle Neolithic period characterized by the Red-on-White Sesklo ware, the Red Monochrome wares from Central Greece, and the Urfimis and Patterned Urfinis wares from the Peloponnesos, we have nothing, or practically nothing, unless we accept our Red Burnished ware as a branch of the A 1 Red Monochrome ware, a conclusion we have seen reason to reject. The South Slope Hut, however, has produced some Sesklo-type painted ware, and our ex- cavations have yielded the marble statuette of a reclining woman, 219, with Middle Neolithic affinities, so that one must assume occupation of Athens in this period. Less certain ascriptions to a Middle Neolithic horizon might be our Red-on-White painted sherd (85), the red glazed sherd (20),113 and possibly the small Gray ware fragments (79-80); but with these examples we are dealing with very fragmentary material. It is the Late Neolithic period that provides most of our parallels, yet, curiously, the striking Dimini-type painted wares of Thessaly are completely lacking, and there is only one small recognizable sherd (93) of the related Mattpainted ware of Central and Southern Greece. The fact that these B 3 Painted wares were found abundantly in the Hut on the South Slope sug- gests a still different, and probably later, horizon for our material. What we do have that can be paralleled elsewhere are: 1) a medium fine Incised ware with all-over curvilinear and mean- droid decoration (the B 2 ware of Thessaly) which was here in Athens apparently confined to scoops of the Sesklo type and which was perhaps imitated in a coarser variant; 2) a Black Burnished and sometimes fluted ware which seems to have been partially imported from the 106 Weinberg, A.J.A., LV, 1951, pp. 132-133; C.A.H., I, Ch. X, pp. 32ff.; Rel. Chron., pp. 285-320. Schachermeyr, Die altesten Kulturen Griechenlands, 1955, especially Ch. V, pp. 49-66. Also Das Agdische Neolithikum, a convenient summary of the newest evidence. 107 Schachermeyr (Das Agdische Neolithikum, p. 9) thinks these dates are 600 to 1000 years too high, and Miloj6ic is ap- parently of the same opinion. Both had presented shorter chronologies in their earlier books (Schachermeyr, Die altesten Kulturen, 1955, pp. 30-31, and Miloj6i6, Chronologie der jungeren Steinzeit, 1949, table at back) with Pre-Sesklo ending some- where in the mid fourth millennium and Dimini and Larissa put in the first half of the third millennium. Weinberg, on the other hand, has always favored a longer chronology, and welcomed the early dates of Carbon 14 samples from Elateia (Hesperia, XXXI, 1962, pp. 207-209), which put Early Neolithic or Pre-Sesklo in the sixth, Middle Neolithic and Sesklo in the fifth, and Late Neolithic in the fourth millennium. 108 S.

Accompanying these classes is our Red Burnished ware which in its finest specimens is not exactly duplicated anywhere else, but which has general affinities to a more widely diffused class of heavy, heavily burnished red ware found at Palaia Kokkinia near Peiraeus, on Aegina, and at Kephala on Keos at the transition from the Neolithic to the Early Bronze Age. Further- more, the complicated lugs, stringholes and generally pyxoid shapes of our jars suggest Cycladic affinities, even though these cannot as yet be exactly matched. The appearance of the fruitstand shape, of bases with triangular cutouts, and wide ribbon handles, sometimes horned, suggests the incorporation of Thessalian B elements (as does also the occurrence of the scoop shape and the spiral-meander patterns of the incised ware, patterns which also occur, but more incipiently, on some few of the painted or burnish-decorated sherds). The tripod-footed pot as evidenced by 65 and 217 points rather to northwest Anatolia and to Troy I114 but at Athens it occurs in the local Red Burnished rather than in the dark burnished wares of that region. In conclusion, our Red Burnished, as well as the whole context of the wells, seems to point to a transitional period at the very end of the Late Neolithic when immigrants were arriving who were to be the introducers of metal. That they came by way of the Cyclades, perhaps in- corporating certain specifically Cycladic features, seems likely because of the number of paral- lels between the Kephala material and that from the Agora wells. In this connection the Proto- Cycladic terracotta head, 220, should be cited. It is uncertain how the Thessalian elements reached Athens. There must have been a ready exchange back and forth between the Gulf of Volo and the Cyclades, as shown by the profusion of Melian obsidian at Thessalian Neolithic sites and occurrence of scoops of Sesklo type on Keos; perhaps the Thessalian elements arrived late along with the northwest Anatolian and the Proto-Cycladic.ll5 On the other hand, these Thesslian features may in part have been a legacy of an earlier contact, since Dimini-type Painted ware was present in the South Slope Hut and in the Cave of Pan near Marathon.116 The question may be asked why our material should be considered Neolithic if it already presages the beginning of the Bronze Age. This is because it is still primarily of a Neolithic character-witness the fruitstands, the Incised ware scoops, etc. The so-called Chalcolithic fea- tures seem to occur in imported or foreign-inspired ware. Furthermore, there is nothing dis- tinctively Early Helladic from our Neolithic wells, with the possible exception of the bowl with incurved rim 43. There is no sign of typical E.H. shapes such as the askos and the sauceboat nor of E.H. Urfirnis; and the general fabric is a thicker, heavier ware than is typical for this period. It might be argued that this phase should be designated E.H. I, and indeed our Neolithic wells must contain the only material that can be assigned to this stage in Athens.117 The site which ought to provide the closest information about the stratigraphic context of our well deposits is Eutresis in Boeotia, where in 1958 the Caskeys reopened and enlarged the deeper 114 Troy, I, fig. 223 a-b, B 14 and C 34, pp. 67, 72, where Blegen cites parallels with Protesilaos, Thermi and Yortan, showing its essentially Chalcolithic origin. 115 Weinberg has recently proposed the theory of Cycladic influence on Dimini ware (C.A.H., I, Ch. X, pp. 47-48), elaborating on the earlier view of Sylvia Benton (B.S.A., XLII, 1947, pp. 165-170). 116 Arch. Anz., 1962, cols. 170f., figs. 18-19. Still later material from the Pan Cave more closely parallels our material, cf. Naissance, II, figs. 834-837, 840. 117 The relatively small quantity of verifiable Early Helladic material from the Agora comes almost entirely from wells and rubbish deposits laid down in the Middle Helladic period, and from these the pottery is E.H. II and III with parallels in Lerna III and IV. Lerna has unfortunately furnished very little evidence for the Late Neolithic period and there was per- haps a break in habitation in E.H. I (see Caskey, "The Early Helladic Period in the Argolid," Hesperia, XXIX, 1960, pp, 285-303, especially pp. 286-288). 20</page><page sequence="38">RELATIVE AND ABSOLUTE CHRONOLOGY soundings of Miss Goldman's excavations.l18 Of their nine stratigraphic groups (ranging from Neolithic of Group I through E.H. III of Group IX) our material corresponds best with Groups II and III, both characterized by a thick-slipped and burnished ware, sometimes decorated with matt white, with some parallels in the eastern Aegean and Troy I. Although shapes and details do not agree exactly, both the Agora Red Burnished and the dark burnished ware from Eutresis are marked by horizontal lugs and rudimentary handles; furthermore, there is a close parallel to our fluted ware in a small ribbed jar from Group III.119 Of Group II the Caskeys say that it is provisionally to be dated in a very early, perhaps preliminary, stage of the Early Bronze Age. Group III they regard as representing further change and development with the Red-slipped ware of E.H. I the typical and distinctive fabric.120 However, the red jugs and jars of this level do not closely resemble our best Red Burnished jars, which we prefer to con- sider a local Attic development of a somewhat earlier period, probably corresponding to Group II. From the foregoing discussion it must be clear that for an absolute date one is dependent not on Neolithic chronologies, but on the date of Troy I and the introduction of the Bronze Age, for we are approaching very closely this period. There are two schools of thought-the higher chronology championed by Weinberg and Caskey, who would put the beginning of Troy I about 3200 B.C., and the lower of Schachermeyr and Milojcic who would make it about 500 years later.l21 In the absence of any additional evidence, we might propose a date of about 3200- 3000 B.C. as the closest dating we can give for the fill of our wells. Although there may be a few earlier pieces, on the whole they seem to represent a unified complex. 118 Hesperia, XXIX, 1960, pp. 126-167. 119 Ibid., p. 140, pl. 47, III. 10. 120 Ibid., p. 162. 121 Weinberg, C.A.H., I, Ch.

The only close parallels are from Athens, particularly from a Neolithic pit on the South Slope near the Asklepieion (see above, note 17), but the general chronological range and cultural affinities have now been clarified through the excavations at Kephala on Keos, where a Late Neolithic cemetery has produced a related but less fine Red Burnished ware with similar lug handles (see above, pp. 8-9).

In this case it should be earlier than our Late Neolithic complex, and might owe something to the Middle Neolithic Urfiris ware.

Although exact parallels are not plentiful, this ware seems certainly to have been imported and to belong to a Chalcolithic horizon with Anatolian af- finities. A black ribbed or rippled ware is found in Towns I-II at Thermi in a pyxis shape not unlike ours but with pierced lugs (Thermi, pl. VIII, 10, 98, 138) and at Servia in Macedonia (Pr. Mac., pp. 141- 143, nos. 19-36, fig. 11, pl. VII), where the designs are more elaborate. It is certainly related to the Larissa stage of Late Neolithic Thessalian wares (the r la 3 and r3 wares of P.T., pp. 105, 152, figs. 55, m., 96, e; D.S., col. 278, fig. 211) and the latest Neolithic from Soufli Magoula, where the fluting consists of painted lines (Arch. Anz., 1959, cols. 63- 65, figs. 10, 11, a; Naissance, II, figs. 434, 436). Our examples seem later than those from Servia and the best Larissa ware, and are probably more akin to the pyxides from Thermi. The shape and the type of decoration are suggestive of the metal bowls from Euboia in the Benaki Museum (see 48) but these should belong to the true Bronze Age rather than to a Chal- colithic horizon (see Renfrew, A.J.A., LXXI, 1967, pp. 1-18, especially p. 7).

A fine fragment, this seems earlier than 70-76 and should probably be connected with the Black Burnished ware which comprises one of the new wares toward the end of Middle Neolithic and which con- tinues into Late Neolithic in Central Greece (see Holmberg, A.J.A., LXVIII, 1964, pp. 343-348; Wein- berg, A.J.A., LXIX, 1965, pp. 160-161).

Thin and fine, this is very different from the Red Burnished ribbon handles (60-64) and may perhaps be connected with the Neolithic Gray ware from Corinth where ribbon handles on carinated bowls oc- cur (see Weinberg's Class II C, Hesperia, VI, 1937, p. 508, fig. 23, g).

Fragment of Gray Biconical Jar, Misfired ? P1. 6. P 13899. Well, T 26:3. P.H. 0.084 m., P.W. 0.057m. Fragment preserves rim, part of shoulder, and one horizontally pierced lug of biconical jar. Gritty clay, fired gray throughout; burnished slip, pale gray. This fragment seems to belong with the Red Bur- nished biconical jars (cf. 5 and 8) and is probably gray merely through an accident in firing. Surface very friable with the appearance of a Fehlbrand (Marie Farnsworth concurs in this opinion). If so, this is important confirmatory evidence for the local manufacture of the Red Burnished jars, a fact which seems clearly indicated by their distribution. Late Neolithic.

The nearest is a Red-on-White ware jug fragment from Sotira in Cyprus, which is decorated with parallel zigzags covering the whole surface, also painted with multiple brush (Sotira, p. 183, pl. 78, 511, o). Although geo- graphically distant, it seems closer stylistically than the Red-on-White Chaironeia ware, where the paral- lel lines either cross to form a lattice pattern or make parallel triangles (cf. Orchomenos, II, pls. XV- XVIII). The general skeuomorphic effect as well as the Late Neolithic range of our wells accords better with the Sotira fragment than with Chaironeia ware.

The design is very similar to that of the handle of the Sesklo scoop (P1. 8). Late Neolithic. 123. Fragment of Flaring Foot(?), perhaps from Scoop. P1. 8. P 14761. Well, U 24:2, upper fill.

Incised decoration of parallel chevrons and diago- nals. Since this is higher than the usual scoop base and no part of the floor of the bowl is preserved, it should conceivably be turned the other way and considered the flaring rim of a pot.

A well made miniature, as if intended for a child. Technically this is similar to 46, which is larger and has a slipped int. and which we have classified with the Red Burnished bowls. This pot may perhaps be considered the final stage of the Red Burnished biconical jar in the Late Neo- lithic period. Cf. the pot from Palaia Kokkinia (1TpoK- TIK&amp;, 1951, p. 104, figs. 12-13) which is twice as large as ours and should perhaps be restored with a foot. See also p. 13. Late Neolithic. 126.

A larger terracotta spoon was found at Sesklo (D.S., col. 348, fig. 285), and they are fairly com- mon in the earliest Early Helladic stratum at Eu- tresis (Eutresis, p. 86, fig. 106, 1-4) and at Lerna in a level antedating the House of the Tiles (Hesperia, XXIV, 1955, pl. 23, c). They occur both with a loop handle or with a short solid handle as in our example. They are also known from Troy (Samml. Troj. Altert., nos. 8836-8843) which may represent the region from which this more sophisticated shape entered at the transition to the Bronze Age. ject. 37 Late Neolithic to Early Helladic ?</page><page sequence="55">NEOLITHIC PERIOD: CATALOGUE 128.

Head, forearms, lower legs and feet missing. Pentelic (?) marble. Female figure in twisted position with upper part of body facing front and legs shown in profile; arms placed horizontally across the body with hands meet- ing in the center; knees drawn up. Nude and stea- topygous with incisions indicating the vagina and the division of the buttocks. Gouges on upper torso probably accidental. The position is unusually complex with the upper torso twisted 90 degrees to the left and bent back at right angles at the waist. The most satisfactory in- terpretation of the pose seems to be that of a reclining female resting on her stomach with knees drawn up and head and shoulders elevated. This is the only Neolithic marble statuette from the Agora, but the lower part of a female figure of more conventional type was found in the North Slope ex- cavations below the west entrance to the Mycenaean Fountain (Fountain, 1939, pp. 405-406, fig. 88). There is also a marble statuette of a seated woman said to come from Patissia, Athens, and now in the Fitzwil- liam Museum (Naissance, I, fig. 145), which, al- though in a different pose, shows a similar stylization and steatopygy restricted to the area below the waist. It and six other figurines of the steatopygous type with folded legs have been published by Weinberg and dated to the end of the Middle Neolithic period (A.J.A., LV, 1951, pp. 122-123). There is no close parallel in Greece for the complicated twisted pose of our statuette, but a terracotta example found at Hacilar (Anat. St., XI, 1961, pp. 56-57, pl. X, b) and two miniature stone examples from the same general region (see above, note 88) show a twisted recumbent pose rendered with greater finesse than in our female. The Anatolian examples are considerably older (sixth millennium), but suggest the prototype. See also pp. 16-17. End of the Middle Neolithic. 220. Head of Terracotta Figurine of Cycladic Type.

L ghtly incised lines from top on either side may represent ears. Slightly raised surface at edge of missing chip on back, hair (?). The Cycladic appearance of this head is now strengthened by the discovery of a similar head in a Late Neolithic tomb at Kephala, Keos (Hesperia, XXXIII, 1964, pl. 46, c-d).

Whereas 222 belongs to Tsountas' Type A, 223 is apparently an example of the slenderer Type B (cf. D.S., col. 310, fig. 233). Such handaxes continued into the Early Bronze Age: cf. Zygouries, pl.

In the context of this well a connection with Western Anatolia in the Late Chalcolithic period seems likely.

Late Neolithic. 50</page><page sequence="68">II. EARLY AND MIDDLE HELLADIC INTRODUCTION There are no pure Early Helladic fills from the Agora and very little material that can be definitely assigned to this period. Some material from the twenty Late Neolithic wells pre- viously discussed may be transitional to Early Helladic, or might even be termed E.H. I, as we have suggested above (p. 20). On the other hand, the fill of deposits laid down in the Middle Helladic period contains scraps of pottery of well-defined E.H. II types, as well as a few whole pots that are E.H. III or transitional to Middle Helladic. Because of the difficulty of isolating the Early Helladic material, we have kept it in its separate mixed contexts. 1. DEPOSITS (Plate 91 and pp. 274-275) The area of the Northwest Slope below the Klepsydra contained five wells which were filled up in Middle Helladic times (R 28:1, S 27:1, S 27:2, T 24:1, T 26:2). These are interspersed among the Late Neolithic wells, but show a clear distinction in the deposits.' In general, the Middle Helladic wells are a little deeper, but are not any more carefully cut or regular in shape than the Neolithic. In T 24:1, the deepest example with a depth of 8.80 m., the center of the shaft was shifted when a hard ledge of rock was struck, as had been done in the Neolithic well U 24:2. T 26:2 was shallow (2.30 m.) with no apparent water, but a thin layer of sand at the bottom. In no instance was there clear evidence for a use fill, and the intermingling of Early Helladic with Middle Helladic material suggests that we are dealing mostly with dump fill. How- ever, the number of complete or restorable pots is surprising, fifteen in R 28:1, twelve in T 24:1; furthermore eight were intact except for chips (250, 252, 328, 338, 360, 361, 353, 354). Of the two quite elegant specimens 328 and 338, one wonders why a chipped spout was suf- ficient reason for their being discarded. Although there are copious remains of animal bones, the absence of any human skeletal material would seem to preclude the possibility of disturbed graves. For the other intact specimens which are heavier and coarser, especially the pitchers, 360-361 and 353-364, a connection with the actual use of the wells seems likely.2 Unlike the Neolithic period where our evidence comes primarily from the slopes of the Acropolis, the Middle Helladic finds suggest widespread occupancy over the entire area of the Agora. In almost every spot where bedrock was reached sherds of characteristic Gray Minyan ware came to light, and it even appears that Middle Helladic pottery was so generally available 1 Hesperia, VII, 1938, pp. 335-338. 2 Lucy Talcott assured me that evidence for a clearly stratified use fill is frequently absent and does not mean that none of the pottery found was connected with the use of the well.</page><page sequence="69">EARLY AND MIDDLE HELLADIC: INTRODUCTION (probably offerings in small cist graves which were disturbed) that it sometimes found its way into or around Geometric graves (see 283, 292 and 346). Natural clefts and declivities in bedrock were filled in and levelled in Middle Helladic times, providing us with dump fill roughly comparable to the material from the five wells but producing no whole pots. The two pits (B 21:15 and G 19:1) off the North and West Slopes of the Areopagus are of this type, more irregular and shallower than the wells, with no evidence for artificial shaping or water, and the presence of household refuse (cinders, ash, fragmentary pithoi) shows that they were used like bothroi. The gully R 21:4 was larger and more irregular and presupposes general levelling operations in Middle Helladic times. This likewise was the nature of the M.H. fill beneath the archaic houses to the east of the Tholos (G-H 11-12). But in none of these areas were there any extant architectural remains, either house walls or pavements, to be associated wTith Middle Helladic occupancy. Two stratified deposits, one at the extreme northwest corner and across the Athens-Peiraeus railroad track (E-F 2),3 the other in the southeast central area near the Mint and Southeast Fountain House,4 point to the existence of ancient roads which were in use at least as early, and probably considerably earlier than, the Middle Helladic period. The former road was the main thoroughfare leading from the area of the later Dipylon to the Agora, the latter the main South Road across the area. The routes of both are indicated on Travlos' plan, Plate 91. For the South Road, excavated by Margaret Crosby in 1955 and 1956, Homer Thompson comments on the extraordinary thickness (1.50 m.) of the stratified deposit of the Middle and Late Helladic periods and on the fact that "the volume of pottery was enough to attest habitation ... it provides the most ample and indeed almost the only evidence yet available for habitation, as distinct from burial, within the area later occupied by the Agora or its immediate environs. Even within the thickness of the prehistoric deposit appeared traffic-beaten, gravelled surfaces which implied the existence of a thoroughfare."5 With this widespread Middle Helladic occupation of the Agora area, one must assume that there were also characteristic intramural burials, although no trace of any has been found intact, doubtless due to the fact that the burials were in shallow cist graves that fell prey to the later users of the area as a cemetery in Mycenaean and subsequent times. Indeed the only pre- Mycenaean burial found in the Agora is of a deeper and rather extraordinary type, and is not easily datable. In 1935 during the excavation of the civic buildings along the west side of the Agora a circular cutting in bedrock 0.73 m. in diameter came to light slightly to the east of the facade of the Metroon (1 9:2; P1. 78).6 It proved to be the top of a shaft going down 8.0 m. and then opening out toward the southeast into a small rectangular chamber, quite rough and irregular, with an adult burial. The chamber was small, 0.80 m. in length, and the body was laid in a con- tracted position on its side with knees drawn up. Two small handmade vases were the only offerings (384-385). The Metroon burial was published by Shear as Subneolithic and compared with the prehistoric burial found by Skias on the South Slope of the Acropolis in 1899,7 although 3 Hesperia, IX, 1940, pp. 299-300. Layer XIII produced hardpacked road gravel and clear M.H. material (Minyan and Mattpainted); the underlying layer XIV was also M.H., XV mixed E.H.-M.H., XVI probably only E.H., and the pockets in bedrock (XVII and XVIII) possibly Neolithic. Since the pre-Middle Helladic material is very scrappy and nondescript, one can merely note that it is heavy and handmade and could be either Late Neolithic or Early Helladic. 4 Hesperia, XXV, 1956, pp. 47ff., pl. XII, b. 5 Ibid., p. 49. From three separate roadcuts (two in Section Tau and one in Psi) there is nothing distinctively earlier than Middle Helladic. The bottom strata and pockets in bedrock produced much Minyan, both Gray and Yellow, Mattpainted and Coarse wares; the upper prehistoric strata yielded Mycenaean, in some cases mixed with Classical. In 1965 during further clearing of the South Square, evidence was found for the existence of a third road across the Agora in prehistoric times (see Hesperia, XXXV, 1966, p. 45); this road must have been the "remote ancestor of the familiar Panathenaic Way." Several interesting fragments of prehistoric pottery (P 27397-27399) from M 12:2 have been inventoried, but it has not been possible to incorporate these in the Catalogue; they are, however, referred to under appropriate comparisons. 6 Hesperia, V, 1936, pp. 20-21.

T., p. 221. 52</page><page sequence="70">DEPOSITS the latter seems to have been lined with crude brick and to have contained six bodies. It is no longer possible to uphold a Neolithic date for either grave, since the fill of our shaft was entirely Middle Helladic, and Minyan, Red Burnished and incised sherds were found in the South Slope grave along with a small handmade jug. Another point of similarity is the occurrence of a small obsidian arrowtip (386) in the fill of I 9:2, and eight obsidian arrowheads of the hafted type plus three flakes in Skias' tomb. Although the arrowheads could equally well be Late Neolithic, the pottery in the fill of both graves is clearly Middle Helladic, and therefore the burials and the crude handmade pots should also be of this period. The actual form of our grave may be roughly compared with the double grave at the bottom of a shaft discovered many years ago at Corinth.8 Here, however, the offerings point to an Early Helladic date with strong Cycladic influence in the pottery. From other excavations in Athens one can draw much the same conclusion of widespread and long-lasting occupation in Middle Helladic times, preceded by clearly attested but more frag- mentary evidence for the Early Helladic period. From the Acropolis itself a few sherds may be Early Helladic,9 whereas there is ample evidence for Middle Helladic in both Minyan and Matt- painted wares.l0 The North Slope excavations of Broneer" and Hazel Hansen12 yielded some Early Helladic but far more Middle Helladic pottery. The South Slope had presented a somewhat misleading picture from the older excavations, since Early Helladic predominated over Middle Helladic. The Grotto above the Asklepieion, excavated by the Italians in 1923, contained not only the heavy, burnished monochrome ware with Anatolian Chalcolithic parallels, which we have already cited in connection with our Neolithic (see above, pp. 10-11), but also the best and largest assortment of developed Early Helladic pottery so far published from Athens.13 It consists of a number of sauceboat frag- ments, Urfirnis ware as well as White Slipped and Polished, and a few decorated sherds which should be E.H. II Painted ware.l4 With this material was found a large collection of obsidian blades and several matrices.'5 There was nothing Middle Helladic in this grotto, but not far away and somewhat closer to the Odeion of Herodes Atticus, Skias had found the early tomb we have discussed above, which now seems more properly to be Middle Helladic. Recent Greek ex- cavations have added substantially to the evidence and have shown the importance of the South 8 A.J.A., I, 1897, pp. 313-332. 9 Mylonas, Aghios Kosmas, p. 4, note 17, refers to Early Helladic found by Leicester Holland within the Erechtheion (cf. Korakou, p. 110, note 5 and James Morton Paton, The Erechtheum, Cambridge, Mass., 1927, p. 581). The sherds figured in Graef, Ant. Vasen, I, pl. I, 2-4 appear to be Early Cycladic III with affinities to our 253-254. Similar vases were found in the earliest Middle Helladic or transitional stratum at Eutresis (Eutresis, pp. 182-183, figs. 253-254) and are therefore not really evidence for the Early Helladic period. 10 Graef, Ant. Vasen, I, p. 1 refers to "six sherds of monochrome Trojan ware of the Sixth City" of which one is of "fine Gray Ware" (Minyan?) as well as no. 6, a fragment from a "Gray Ware cup with handles." The Mattpainted are more fully il- lustrated (pl. I, 10-25). In addition to the various classes found among the Agora material, they include polychrome Mattpainted (nos. 14-17) and sherds of cups with running spirals (pl. II, 27-29) resembling those from the upper M.H. level at Korakou (Korakou, p. 26, figs. 35-36). 11 Hesperia, II, 1933, pp. 356-363. Figs. 26 and 27 are labelled Early Helladic, but a few fragments seem to be Middle Helladic (namely fig. 26, a, cf. with our 263; and fig. 27, b, cf. with 383). Among the E.H. material there are "sherds of sauceboats" (fig. 26, i-m), one of Light-on-Dark Patterned ware (fig. 26, f), and some incised ware of Cycladic origin in- cluding a duck vase (fig. 27, h). Unfortunately, the illustrated material from the 1931-1932 excavations is not now avail- able for study in the Agora Museum, nor could its whereabouts be ascertained. Most of the prehistoric material illustrated is Middle Helladic (ibid., figs. 28-33) or Late Helladic (figs. 34-45). 12 Hesperia, VI, 1937, pp. 542-557. Figs. 3 and 4 are called Early Helladic, but include many Middle Helladic (see below, notes 57 and 133). Fig. 3, a-d and f are E.H. II White Slipped and Polished ware, and a few sherds of E.H. were found in the fill of the Mycenaean Fountain (Fountain, p. 349, fig. 23, e-j). The pottery from the 1937 and 1938 campaigns on the North Slope is housed in the Stoa of Attalos and was available for study and comparison; specific comparisons are cited in our Catalogue according to the A.P. (Acropolis Pottery) numbers. See Index of Acropolis Pottery, pp. 285-286. 13 Levi, Abitazioni, pp. 479-480, figs. 64-65. 14 Ibid., fig. 64, b, 1-2. Caskey (Hesperia, XXIX, 1960, p. 292) has made a distinction between E.H. II Painted ware and E.H. III Dark-on-Light Patterned ware on the evidence of the material from Lerna III and IV respectively. 15 Levi, Abitazioni, pp. 481-483, figs. 66-67. 53</page><page sequence="71">EARLY AND MIDDLE HEIrT,ADIC: INTRODUCTION Slope in Middle Helladic times. In 1959 Miliadis, excavating below the Odeion of Herodes, found both Early and Middle Helladic sherds and a bothros with pure Middle Helladic fill.6 In 1961 during salvage operations on the Angelopoulos property south of the Street of Dionysios the Areopagite, two small cist graves and traces of two Middle Helladic houses were excavated by Dontas.17 The latter are important as the first architectural remains of this period so far dis- covered in Athens. Further east and nearer the Asklepieion a Middle Helladic bothros has more recently been dug by Platon.18 Especially in the Middle Helladic period we have evidence for occupation some distance away from the Acropolis. Far to the south in the area of the Olympieion, excavations in 1959 by Travlos and the late John Threpsiades disclosed a deep prehistoric deposit with both Middle and Late Helladic pottery, but apparently nothing of Neolithic or Early Helladic date.19 And to the southwest on the Hill of Philopappos Threpsiades in 1962 found an interesting Middle Helladic deposit in a rock cutting which was later used as a Geometric grave.20 To the north- west in the Kerameikos German excavations before the war had disclosed a Middle Helladic cist grave with three interesting pots,21 as well as other pre-Mycenaean sherds from the general area. Still farther to the northwest excavations by Stavropoullos have shown the importance in prehistoric times of the region later occupied by Plato's Academy. Especially significant are the mention of Early Helladic sherds and the presence of an Early Helladic stratum beneath the mud-brick "sacred house" of Geometric times.22 In order to draw definite conclusions one must await fuller reports from the new excavations. It would seem, however, that Athens, both the Acropolis and its slopes and also the Academy, was inhabited in Early Helladic times, but that this material has been disturbed and telescoped by the far denser and more pervasive Middle Helladic occupation. We have nothing comparable to Early Helladic coastal sites in Attica like Askitario3 on the east coast or Aghios Kosmas24 on the south, both of which escaped the superposition of a Middle Helladic stratum and are thus more or less intact. Moreover, it is unlikely that Athens had the importance in the Early Helladic period of these coastal sites which may have been Cycladic foundations and must have drawn their livelihood from trade and seafaring. 16 Excavated by Mrs. Sakelleraki during excavations conducted by Miliadis from 1955-1960; to be published in a forth- coming AeAriov. Through the kindness of Dr. Platon, Mr. Travlos, and Miss Maro Tsoni I was able to examine this material in 1964 in the Fetihe-Tzami (Mosque in Roman Market). The bothros contained Gray and Yellow Minyan, M.H. Red Burnished, Mattpainted and Coarse, and it seemed to be purely Middle Helladic. 17 Reported briefly in AEAr., XVII, 1961-1962, pp. 83-86, esp. pp. 85-86, 90; see also B.C.H., LXXXVI, 1962, p. 640. The graves contained few offerings, and no pottery is illustrated in the preliminary report. However, material from a near-by stratified deposit on the Angelopoulos property was shown me in the Fetihe Tzami. It ranged from M.H. through early Mycenaean (Myc. II-III A:1) and included a fragment of an E.C. frying-pan, Gray and Yellow Minyan, Red Burnished and Fine Mattpainted, but nothing specifically Early Helladic. 18 Excavated in 1963 or 1964. The pottery was examined in the storeroom of the Acropolis Museum through the kindness of Dr. Platon. It consisted of two fragmentary Mattpainted pithoi, a Gray Minyan kantharos, and a Cycladic duck vase without decoration. 19 B.C.H., LXXXIV, 1960, p. 634; J.H.S. Arch. Reports 1960-1961, p. 3; Arch.

It consisted of a large M.H. Red Burnished bowl like 260, a complete Cycladic duck vase and three fragmentary ones like 256, as well as a coarse handmade jug. The good condition of the pottery would suggest that they came from a grave rather than a bothros. 21 Arch. Anz., 1936, cols. 197-203, figs. 18-19. 22 npCoKIK&amp;, 1955 (1960), pp. 53ff.; J.H.S.

Aghios Kosmas and Askitario were abandoned until Late Helladic times, but at Brauron25 a strong Middle Helladic stratum with a fortification wall succeeded the Early Helladic settlement, and a large Middle Helladic foundation was made at Skala Oropou26 to the north. The slightly inland position of these last two sites is probably symptomatic of changed conditions. Athens, which is even further inland, shows a comparable dominance of Middle Helladic over Early Helladic, but coastal Eleusis has revealed no clear Early Helladic stratum and shows a remarkable con- tinuity from Middle to Late Helladic.27 2. POTTERY (Pls. 16-27) Because of the unstratified nature of our material, one must depend on outside parallels for establishing even a relative chronology. For this the carefully stratified site of Lerna in the Argolid is of great importance. Our material from the wells and bothroi filled up in Middle Helladic times covers the three periods of Lera III, IV, and V, with the last dominant and with a few pieces coeval with the period of Lerna VI. These strata have been equated by the ex- cavator, J. L. Caskey, with the periods traditionally known as E.H. II, E.H. III and M.H.28 Although Athens and Lerna lie some distance apart and the development may not have been exactly the same in the two regions, Lerna is now the basic reference site for Early and Middle Helladic, and we have therefore divided our pottery into three main groups which seem to be roughly contemporary with the Periods of Lerna III, IV, and V.29 THE PERIOD OF LERNA III OR EARLIER HEAVILY BURNISHED WARE (Pls. 16, 70) The three small fragments 237-239 are clearly early, but only for 239, the pared open spout of a bowl or sauceboat, do we have good Early Helladic parallels.30 No. 237 is more enigmatic; its deliberate and artistic mottling differs from anything in our Neolithic Red Burnished ware, but the shape is not easily ascertained (probably a closed pot with a flaring base and the remnants of a stringhole). It may conceivably be Late Neolithic,31 and the same is more likely for 238, which has parallels among our Red Burnished bowls with lug handles, for example 29 and 30. If so these two would represent the only Neolithic material in their respective wells, T 26:2 and T 24:1. SLIPPED AND POLISHED WARE (Pls. 16, 70) No. 240 is from a shallow bowl with incurved rim, and is covered with a highly polished orange-red slip, somewhat flaked and showing striations from the burnishing tool.

I should like here to acknowledge my thanks to Prof. Caskey for sharing with me his expert knowledge of Early and Middle Helladic material, and I take full responsibility for the few cases where I have not followed his opinion. 55</page><page sequence="73">EARLY AND MIDDLE HELLADIC: INTRODUCTION correspond to the A II ware from Zygouries, which was characteristic of the earlier part of Early Helladic,32 and it cannot under any circumstances be confused with Neolithic. However, it may conceivably be Middle Helladic, since its surface treatment closely resembles 258 and 268, and the sharply carinated profile of the former seems to lead directly into the Middle Helladic Red Burnished bowls 260-261.33 Fortunately for 241-244 there is no difficulty in recognizing the fine Slipped and Polished ware, usually creamy white, yellow or mottled, so well described by Blegen and known from a number of Early Helladic sites.34 This is our best index for Early Helladic in Athens, not only in the Agora, but also for the North Slope and the Grotto above the Asklepieion on the South Slope.3 From stratigraphic evidence elsewhere this fabric seems to be typical of the earlier part of E.H. II, for it decreased at the very end of Lerna III.36 Being very brittle and fine, it occurs only in small fragments in our deposits; 241 seems to be part of the spout of a sauceboat and 244 the flaring foot-ring of an open bowl or sauceboat. URFIRNIS WARE (P1. 16) There is a surprising absence of typical E.H. II Urfirnis from the Agora deposits,37 and no fragments of the ubiquitous sauceboat in this ware. Smallin this ware. Small scraps were noted in the context pottery from T 26:2, from layer XV of the stratified deposit at the northwest corner of the Agora (E-F 2), and from a mixed layer of the fill of the area of the Tholos (G-H 11-12). The only piece that has been catalogued (245) is atypical: the fragment of a heavy lid with a flange; it is coated with a crackly black glaze resembling Urfinis, but of poor quality and there- fore perhaps E.H. III in date. INCISED WARE (P1. 16) Only one sherd of our incised ware, which is presumably imported from the Cyclades, would appear to be early. No. 246 has a lustrous black burnished slip and neat fine incisions which can be paralleled by a sherd with stamped spirals from the First Meter Deposit at Eutresis.38 One should note the extreme scarcity and fragmentary nature of this material, which is all that we have which can be paralleled with the period of Lera III. THE PERIOD OF LERNA IV The fortunate occurrence of a burnt stratum marking the end of the House of the Tiles and of Lera III has enabled Caskey to draw a sharp distinction between E.H. II and E.H. III and to reappraise the Early Helladic material from other sites. Patterned Ware, both Dark-on-Light and the reverse Light-on-Dark or "Aghia Marina" style, makes its first appearance, and new shapes such as the tankard and the two-handled bowl replace the askos and the sauceboat of E.H. II.39 32 Blegen, Zygouries, pp. 77-78, pls. V, VII, 1. 33 258 and 268 are considered Middle Helladic by Caskey. 34 Zygouries, pp. 78-83, pl. IX; Eutresis, p. 97, pl. VI, 1. Also Asine, pp. 219-220, fig. 161, 5, where it is dated to E.H. III (but see Hesperia, XXIX, 1960, p. 801). 35 In addition to eight inventoried sherds, several dozen more were noted in the storage containers from S 27:2, T 24:1, and T 26:2. Our material is covered uniformly with a creamy white slip, and does not show the range of colors or mottling found at Zygouries. From the North Slope: A.P. 1801-1304 and 1306 (Hesperia, VI, 1937, p. 542, fig. 3, a-d, f). From the South Slope, see Levi, Abitazioni, pp. 479-480, figs. 64-65. 36 Hesperia, XXIX, 1960, p. 289. 37 Urfirnis was apparently found in the Grotto on the South Slope (see note 35) and has been reported from Plato's Academy (see note 22), so its absence among our material is probably accidental. 38 Eutresis, p. 81, fig. 97, 2. 39 See Hesperia, XXIX, 1960, pp. 295-297. 56</page><page sequence="74">POTTERY: PERIOD OF LERNA IV PATTERNED WARE (Pis. 16, 70) Three small fragments (247-249) have been recognized. They are all in the Light-on-Dark style, apparently more characteristic of Central Greece than the Peloponnesos, and if one can judge from the splaying lips of 248-249, they presumably came from the characteristic tankard shape.4 Only on 247 is there a clear remnant of the pattern of hatched triangles,41 but on the other two there are certainly traces of horizontal lines in white. BLACK BURNISHED WARE (Pls. 16, 70) Three more or less complete vases (250-262) in a brick red clay with a gray or black burnished surface come from three different Middle Helladic wells (T 24:1, S 27:2, and R 28:1). They seem to form a group by virtue of their foreign affinities and their probable dating to the period of Lera IV. No. 250, a globular jar with flattened bottom, vertical lugs, and flaring rim with stringholes, bears a general resemblance to our Neolithic Red Burnished biconical jars, but is surely from a different horizon. The fabric suggests Trojan-Anatolian connections, and the shape is roughly paralleled by Type C 28 characteristic of Troy II, although no exact parallels have been found.42 The paired stringholes in the rim are found in a brownish black pot from Asine, for which Persson has also found a parallel in Troy II.43 No. 21, a graceful bowl with incurved rim and silvery gray burnished surface, has closer affinities with the Cyclades, and is probably to be associated with Black Burnished bowls from Eutresis and Aegina, where they appear in a transitional Early to Middle Helladic context.44 No. 252 is also unique among the Agora material and stands out as an import by reason of its mammiform bosses, ear-shaped handles and irregular shape. Northwest Anatolia seems to have been the ultimate origin of this shape, for it is found there as early as Thermi I and occurs in a variant form with single bosses and horizontal handles in Troy IIg.45 The closest counter- parts to our example come, however, from Early Bronze Age Macedonia,46 where they are found in the company of tankards and cups of the depas shape which show Trojan influence. These do not always have knobs, but one from Gon&amp; is remarkably like our example in shape and has a single boss on either side. A less direct connection may be noted with the black Slipped and Polished bowls which are ubiquitous in Lerna IV, occurring both in a handmade form and in a gray wheelmade variant which is indistinguishable from Minyan ware.46a 40 Light-on-Dark: Eutresis, pp. 116-117, figs. 155-156, pi. VIII. Dark-on-Light: Zygouries, pi. XIII; Korakou, p. 10, fig. 10; Hesperia, XXIII, 1954, pi. 10, b (Lema). Note Caskey's remark that the "Aghia Marina style" is well attested but relatively scarce in Lerna IV (Hesperia, XXIX, 1960, p. 295). 41 The pattern appears to be darker than the ground because the paint has flaked off, but has preserved the surface from incrustation. Cf. the similar effect on the Mattpainted jar 328. 42 Troy, I, fig. 401, 37.1117 (Phase IId) and 35.479 (Phase IIg), both with different types of lugs.

The Trojan examples often have a higher more cylindrical neck. 4" Asine, p. 265, fig. 184, 8 compared with Schmidt, Samml. Troj. Altert., p. 64, no. 1489. Its M.H. I date need not make it later than Lerna IV (see Hesperia, XXIX, 1960, p. 297). Note also the Trojan jar of bizarre form imported into a late stage of Lena IV (Hesperia, XXIII, 1954, pl. 11, b), the general resemblance of the tankards of Troy II (Troy, I, fig. 380) to the Patterned ware tankards of E.H. III, and the occurrence of the depas amphikypellon shape (Troy, I, figs. 381-382) in a modified version in Patterned ware at Lerna (Hesperia, XXIV, 1955, pl. 21, i). All these show a close connection between E.H. III and Troy III-V. 44 Cf. Eutresis, fig. 177, p. 134 ("found in a stratum where Early Helladic sherds still outnumbered the Middle Helladic").

No. 263 is a fragment of the cylindrical type with tapering sides and has parallels in the First City of Phylakopi; No. 264 comes from the higher type with curved wall and is also matched at Phylakopi I.47 Not only the current later dating of Phylakopi I but the occurrence of similar pyxides at Eutresis "on the floors of houses of the first (M.H.) building level or in the transitional stratum just preceding it"48 confirms our assigning these fragments to the period of Lerna IV. The small quantity and the imported nature of this material should be noted, but the three whole pots contrast with the earlier material contemporary with Lerna III. THE PERIOD OF LERNA V It is natural that most of the pottery from the Agora fills laid down in the Middle Helladic times should be ascribed to this period. The five wells on the Northwest Slope have provided an excellent series of whole or restorable pots, but even with the additional catalogued fragments from them and from the other deposits, one has no real conception of the quantity of Middle Helladic material from the Agora unless one has examined the uninventoried context pottery, which runs into a far greater bulk than for the Neolithic or even the Late Helladic period.49 CYCLADIC IMPORTS (Pls. 17, 70) No. 266 is a fragmentary ribbed askos or duck vase of well-known Cycladic type. Such vases, often with incised decoration, were common in the mature phase of Phylakopi I50 and were exported as far afield as Troy,51 but they turn up in considerable numbers at Aegina and on the Greek mainland, often in company with other Cycladic or Cycladic-inspired material, particularly the Red Burnished carinated bowls like our 260-263. The closest parallels to our ribbed example come from Aegina,52 Eutresis,53 and from the recently found deposit on the Philopappos hill.54 Whether these duck vases should really be assigned to a later period than the late pyxides 23- is not absolutely clear; however, the incised pyxides are late survivals of an older tradition, whereas the duck vases are usually found with ware that can more properly be called Middle Helladic.55 No. 267, a miscellaneous find from the area of the later Eleusinion, was recognized as prehistor- ic but its exact classificreation and interpretation are difficult. Of coarse heavy fabric with a 47 Phylakopi, p. 87, Section 4, p. IV, 1, 2 (double), 3. Caskey now makes Phylakopi I contemporary with Lema IV (C.A.H., I, Ch. XXVI, p. 26). 48 Eutresis, pp. 182-186.

They were found on the floor of House X assigned to the first building level of Middle Helladic (ibid., pp. 36-37), and a ribbed black jar (pl. XII, 2), probably also of Cycladic origin, was found in the same context. 54 See above, note 20: a complete incised duck vase and three fragmentary ribbed examples. In 1909 an incised example was found on the South Slope (EAT. , 1, 1915, HapapT., p. 34, fig. 1, 1); another comes from the North Slope (Hesperia, II, 1933, p. 357, fig. 27, h). 55 At Lerna the sole duck vase that has been illustrated comes from the first stratum of Lerna V (Hesperia, XXVI, 1957, pl. 42, d and referred to in XXIX, 1960, p. 298) whereas there are fragments of lids with stamped spirals and incised pat- terns from the lowest E.H.

It also occurs in the material from the North Slope, where it is not always correctly designated.57 It runs the gamut from a thin, transparent, but easily flaked slip with a high polish (258 and 268) to an evenly high red burnish on a brick red clay (260) and can be fired partly red and partly black with an almost vitreous surface (263 and numerous uncatalogued fragments from the North Slope). This last, when fired predominantly black, approaches, if it is not identical with, the fabric of Argive Minyan, and indeed some of the shapes of Middle Helladic Red Burnished are strongly carinated or reproduce well-known Minyan types.58 This is not true, however, of many examples from the Agora,59 which are mostly shallow bowls with carinated shoulder and slightly incurved (258-261) or offset (262-263) rim. They are often provided with lug handles, in 260 and in 261 horizontal with double piercings, in 262 a small vertical lug pierced once. Such shapes are found also at Eutresis, but are especially common on Aegina and in Melos, as Miss Goldman notes.60 More examples like 260 and 261 are turning up in fair numbers in the new Greek excavations on the South Slope and on the Hill of Philopappos, sometimes in company with Cycladic duck vases suggestive of their foreign origin and a dating near the beginning of the Middle Helladic period. The more strongly carinated profiles and the fabric resembling Argive Minyan of 262 and 263 may represent a mainland development under the influence of Minyan ware. No. 264 is somewhat different, coming from a large bowl with upstanding rim splayed toward the inside and decorated on the upper surface with short parallel strokes of matt black. The red slip is unusually lustrous and seems to be a real glaze. Here, there is the likelihood of another Cycladic import, as the only parallels I know come from the islands.61 Nos. 266 and 267 are rim fragments of large bowls with slightly carinated profiles and have traces of white mattpainted decoration on the upper wall. They seem to belong with the Red Burnished ware with white patterns from Eutresis62 rather than with the Light-on-Dark Matt- painted ware (324-330). No. 268 has the flaked transparent slip characteristic of 258, and for both of these there is some question whether they should be considered Middle Helladic. With 258 goes 259 which has 56 Phylakopi, p. 91, pi. IV, 9 and Cyclades, fig. 94. A similar but more complete ring-shaped object with a narrow aperture throughout was found on the Angelopoulos site along with Middle Helladic material. In neither case, however, does the "spout" veer at the angle of the Phylakopi example. Similar vases, but with feet, are found in Troy II (Troy, I, pp. 240- 241, Shape D 30, fig. 406, a) and in Aegina (Welter, Aigina, p. 13, fig. 11), presumably under Cycladic influence. 57 Goldman, Eutresis, pp. 126-132, gives perhaps the fullest account of this fabric. North Slope examples: Hesperia, II, 1933, p. 360, fig. 30; VI, 1937, p. 547, fig. 5, a, g, k, 1 and also p. 543, fig. 3, g, k, 1 which are labelled E.H. 58 E.g., Eutresis, pp. 132-133; examples pl.

Miss Goldman's remark, Eutresis, p. 125, on the "unpleasant dull appearance like that of a sticky surface" of some of her Red Burnished). Caskey considers this latter fragment contemporary with Lerna VI. 60 Eutresis, p. 128. For examples see p. 127, figs. 170, 1-7, 172, 1; p. 130, fig. 174, 2-3. For Melian examples cf. B.S.A., XVII, 1910-1911, p. 20 and reference to bowl shapes of Phylakopi, pl. XXXIII, most of which are painted in the Geometric style of early Phylakopi II, and resemble but do not exactly correspond in shape to our 260. Similar bowls are displayed in the Aegina Museum. 61 Shape does not exactly correspond, but perhaps similar to a standed plate from Phylakopi with short strokes of white on the rim (B.S.A., XVII, 1910-1911, pl. VII, 167). Cf. also the fragment of a wheelmade Red Burnished bowl from Siphnos witn traces of groups of strokes in matt purple on rim (B.S.A., XLIV, 1949, p. 32, fig. 6, 5) and a fragment from Aegina with groups of vertical strokes in matt white on a highly polished red surface (sherd collection of the British School at Athens). 62 Eutresis, pp. 129-130, figs. 174, 5; 175, 1, 4, 7. 59</page><page sequence="77">EARLY AND MIDDLE HELLADIC: INTRODUCTION a similar profile but is coarser and has no trace of a burnished slip.63 No. 268, which comes ap- parently from a closed pot, has a rather nicely profiled base comparable to those on some Middle Helladic Red Burnished bowls from Eutresis.64 No. 269, which is heavier than most Middle Helladic Red Burnished and in this respect resembles Neolithic, comes from Well R 28:1; it is almost certainly the stem of a large M.H. goblet or fruitstand.65 ARGIVE MINYAN (P1. 18) We have mentioned the affinity of certain mottled Red Burnished fragments like 263 to Argive Minyan, and the same shape is found almost completely black among the North Slope material. We have only one fragment (270) in this fabric which reproduces a well-known Minyan shape,66 but there are additional fragments from the North Slope.67 The handsome water jar 271, of a shape which occurs in Middle Helladic Mattpainted (301, 325-326), is an excellently fashioned pot, large, wheelmade, with profiled handles having raised edges. It is covered with a highly polished black slip which is similar to the surface of Argive Minyan, although probably later than most examples of this ware. GRAY MINYAN (Pls. 18-19, 70) Although not many whole pots could be made up, Gray Minyan was found in great quantity in all Middle Helladic deposits and almost everywhere that bedrock was touched. The total number of vases represented by the inventoried fragments plus the uninventoried sherds must have run to several hundred or more.68 Our examples belong to the types well-known from other Middle Helladic strata and can be discussed briefly. Our catalogue includes fourteen fragmentary examples of stemmed goblets (272-285). The type with ribbon loop handles set vertically on the carinated shoulder (272-273) and the type with rolled loop handles set horizontally and rising from the rim (275) are represented, as they are in the North Slope material.69 The preserved stems are of the high type with many rings (280) or with a few at the top of a plain flaring column (281-282), but the low type with a single ring (283) also occurs.70 No. 284 is from the base of a very large goblet, while 285 is a much smaller unfluted stem apparently in a kind of imitation Minyan.71 Only two other shapes are represented in our Minyan material. Nos. 286-289 come from 63 The carinated upper wall seems higher and straighter than in certified E.H. examples (e.g., Zygouries, p. 82, fig. 68; p. 106, fig. 90, 107) and 258 resembles 260, for which there is a sure early M.H. dating through the occurrence of similar bowls in contexts with imported duck vases.

R 28:1 (stems of 2 or 3 ring-stemmed goblets plus smaller scraps); S 27:1 (at least 2 ring-stemmed goblets and 2 kantharoi); S 27:2 (at least 12 goblets with rim and handle fragments; some smaller cups); T 24:1 (6 or 8 goblets, wall fragments, carinated rims and handles of both types); T 26:2 (about 12 fragments); R 21:4 (about 80 fragments); I 9:2 (21 fragments); E-F:2 (55-60 fragments); G-H 11-12 (about 70 fragments); O-Q 16-17 (at least 45 fragments). The durability and unmistakable character of Minyan ware may have led to a greater preservation of sherd material than for some of the less distinctive wares (this was pointed out to me by Homer Thompson). 69 Loop-handled type: Eutresis, pp. 136-137, figs. 184, 1, 5; 185, 2, 4; A.P. 1338 and 1341 (Hesperia, VI, 1937, p. 551, fig. 8, a, d).

It may have had one loop handle, but scarcely two, since no trace of attachment is preserved. Perhaps a later development of the Black Burnished bowls of Lera IV which also continue into Lerna V,73 it occurs with a single ribbon handle from the rim at Asine and with a high-swung handle at Krisa.74 YELLOW MINYAN (Pls. 19, 70) The catalogue of Yellow Minyan is comparatively small, since our classification is restricted to ware which resembles Gray Minyan in technique and which reproduces many of the same shapes or shows an evolution from the more strongly carinated forms of the gray ware. We have not included the finer buff ware, as does Miss Goldman,75 since its shapes are more closely al- lied to those of undecorated coarse ware.76 Nos. 292-293 are small fragments of stemmed goblets with ring handles like the Gray Minyan example 275, whereas 295 is the Yellow Minyan version of the type with vertical strap handles (cf. 272-273).77 In these there is no essential difference in shape between the Gray and Yellow Minyan versions and they may be contemporary, but in 296, the stem of a goblet with curving bowl, we are well on the way to the Ephyraean shape of Myc. I-II.78 Nos. 297-298 are pro- filed bases of fine buff ware with polished surface, apparently from closed pots, and may be compared with similar examples from Eutresis.79 Nos. 299 and 300 are Yellow Minyan ware with Mattpainted decoration, and could be put in either classification.80 No. 299 is the rim of an open bowl with carinated upper wall, probably like the examples from Korakou,81 but with a simpler pattern of crossing diagonal lines creating open lozenges. No. 300, the fragment of a splayed rim with angular Minyan profile and an interior flange, is decorated with loops on top of the rim. It is wheelmade of fine buff clay, and seems to come from a closed shape, possibly a small storage jar.82 MATTPAINTED WARE (Pls. 20-23, 71-74) This, the most interesting Middle Helladic pottery group from the Agora excavations, includes several first-rate and unusual whole pots (e.g. 328 and 338) which have been cited by Robert 72 For the first type cf. Eutresis, p. 139, fig. 187, 3; for the second, Korakou, p. 15, figs. 18-19. No specimens of this shape noted in North Slope material. 73 Hesperia, XXIX, 1960, pp. 296-297, pl. 70, i and references. Also Korakou, p. 16, fig. 22. 74 Asine, p. 265, fig. 184, 4; B.C.H., LXII, 1938, p. 114, fig. 3, 2 (perhaps related to the round-bodied kantharoi, Kirrha, pl. XXXV, 10-12). 75 Eutresis, pp. 165ff. 76 Although the evolution from Gray to Yellow Minyan to Mycenaean has been correctly analyzed by Blegen (Korakou, pp. 116-117), there was also involved the influence of Mattpainted and Coarse ware shapes, as well as the strong influence of Minoan imports. For this reason the jug with cutaway neck, 351, the ancestor of the well-known Mycenaean shape (cf. VII-19), although of fine buff ware, is scarcely to be considered Yellow Minyan in the restrictive sense. Its shape occurs in Middle Helladic Coarse ware 349, and belongs to the Mattpainted repertory (Robert J. Buck, "Middle Helladic Mattpainted Pot- tery," Hesperia, XXXIII, 1964, pp. 231-313, shape B8 who, p. 286, refers to this shape as "a 'Minyanized' version of the older shape, i.e. made by potters used to Minyan techniques"). 77 Cf. the larger fragment from the North Slope, A.P. 1398 (Hesperia, VI, 1937, p. 558, fig. 13, m). 78 Cf. Eutresis, p. 169, fig. 238, 1 for the existence of this shape already in Middle Helladic. Our fragment 296 came from a predominantly M.H. fill, R 21:4, which however did contain some Late Helladic material. For Ephyraean goblets see Korakou, pp. 54-57, pls. VI, VII. 79 Eutresis, p. 165, fig. 231 (ower row). 80 Miss Goldman keeps her examples with Yellow Minyan (Eutresis, pp. 167-174), but Buck includes these in a special group under Fine Wares (Buck, p. 241). Since we have only two examples, which are more interesting for their shapes, we have kept them under Yellow Minyan. 81 Korakou, p. 28, fig. 39. This is Buck's shape A4, for which he suggests Cycladic rather than Yellow Minyan derivation (Buck, p. 284). 82 Cf. Buck's shape C9 (Buck, pp. 249, 296), which occurs in polychrome Mattpainted ware with Yellow Minyan connections.</page><page sequence="79">EARLY AND MIDDLE HELLADIC: INTRODUCTION Buck in his recent and definitive study of Mattpainted ware.83 From -the standpoint of technique the Agora examples can be divided into five classes which correspond closely to all but two of Buck's seven classes. In the coarse ware we have: I) dark paint on light clay (Buck's "Buff- Green ware"); II) dark paint on a white-slipped red clay (Buck's "White-Slipped ware"); III) light paint on red clay (Buck's "Light-on-Dark Mattpainted"), and we lack only his "Red Ware" (with black matt paint) which had a more restricted, and particularly Central Greek and Thessalian distribution.84 In fine ware we have: IV) dark paint on a fine creamy white fabric (Buck's "Green-Yellow ware") and V) Yellow Minyan, but we lack any examples of his "Poly- chrome ware," which did, however, occur in Athens.s8 The material in the Catalogue is presented according to these classes, of which we have already considered two fragments in the Yellow Minyan group. CLASS I-COARSE LIGHT CLAY WITH DARK MATT PAINT (301-317; Pls. 20-21, 71-72) The material is quite fragmentary with the exception of the small amphora with shoulder handles, 301, which is almost complete and had been mended in antiquity with lead clamps. Buck uses it as the type example for his shape C8, and, because of its pendant triangle decora- tion (Mot. 38) which occurs on spouted bowls of early date from Korakou and Lerna, dates it early in the series.86 It may also be related to the larger water jar type, which has another set of horizontal handles lower down on the belly and occurs in a fragmentary example with the same decoration from Korakou.87 Nos. 302-306 are rim fragments from large open bowls of various shapes. All except 306 are of the earlier type Al, probably with pierced horizontal lug handles like 304.88 No. 306 seems rather to belong to type A5, characterized by a defined shoulder and a treatment of the lip "showing a close relationship to Minyan ware"89 with which the wheelmade technique of our example accords. The flanked saltires (Mot. 30) of 303 and multiple zigzags (Mot. 7) of 302, in each case arranged in a horizontal band in the handle zone, are characteristic of such bowls, whereas the curving festoons of 306 may imitate the incised festoons of Argive Minyan.90 No. 313 consists of two fragments from a large pithos o tr barrel jar (Type Cl) with offset rim with stringholes and flange for lid, a type well-known from Aegina and other sites.91 No. 314, a large wall fragment, and 315, a pierced horizontal lug, come from similar pithoi. The wheel patterns (Mot. 100), stars (Mot. 122), and crosshatched lozenges (Mots. 20-21) belong to the well-known decorative repertory of these pithoi, a group which may have originated in Aegina.92 83 See above, note 76. Like Furumark's study of Mycenaean Pottery (Ame Furumark, The Mycenaean Pottery, Stockholm, 1942) Buck concentrates on a typological arrangement of shapes and motives, and refers to, but does not illustrate, specific vases. 84 Cf. Buck's remarks on the Lianokladhi style (Buck, p. 301). 85 A few examples come from the North Slope (Hesperia, II, 1933, p. 361, fig. 32, d-g and A.P. 1403, Hesperia, VI, 1937, p. 560, fig. 14, e) and others from the Acropolis (Graef, Ant. Vasen, I, p. 3, nos. 14-17, pi. I, 15-16). 86 Korakou, p. 21, fig. 29; Hesperia, XXIII, 1954, pl. 8, a. The latter example is from the original floor of House M which succeeded House D of the transition from Lema IV to V (cf. ibid., p. 16, and Hesperia, XXIX, 1960, p. 298). See also Buck, p. 288 for early dating. 87 Korakou, p. 23, fig. 33. 88 See Buck, p. 284. Nos. 302-803 closely resemble in decoration the pedestalled example from Lerna (Hesperia, XXVI, 1957, pl. 42, a) which is early. 89 Buck, p. 284. 90 E.g., Black Minyan bowl from Lerna (Hesperia, XXIII, 1954, pl. 7, c, from House D). See also Buck, p. 284. 91 Welter, Aigina, p. 17, figs. 19-20. For further examples see Buck, pp. 247-248. He considers (p. 287) the ultimate origin of this shape the E.C. III pithos type as seen at Phylakopi (Phylakopi, pls. VII, 1, VIII, 4). 92 The greenish white clay of our examples is suggestive. Buck does little in using fabrics as an indication of place of origin, but it seems unlikely that the red Athenian clay could have produced the fabric of this class. Our excavations have yielded far more examples, including uncatalogued material, of Classes II and III, the White Slipped and the Light-on-Dark ware, for which Attic clay was suitable. 62</page><page sequence="80">POTTERY: PERIOD OF LERNA V Nos. 307-312 are sherds from pots of uncertain shape, 312 having been cut down into a button or whorl with a central piercing. They are interesting chiefly for their decoration, 307 having a certain affinity to the decorated Yellow Minyan of Eutresis and the Fine Mattpainted of Zygouries.93 Nos. 308-309 are of standard type, but 310-311 are different, and in their parallel diagonal lines and less adhesive paint resemble the Dark-on-Light Middle Helladic Glazed ware from Asine and Lerna.94 The jug fragments, 316-317, seem to anticipate Mycenaean, and may well be from the end of the period or even from the time of Lerna VI. The wheelmade neck with flaring rim is paral- leled in the coarse undecorated pitchers 353-354, and is similar to a jug from the penultimate phase of Lerna V.95 CLASS II-DARK PAINT ON LIGHT SLIP (318-323; Pls. 21, 71-73) While not so large as the preceding class, the small number of examples in the catalogue is perhaps misleading. Because of the poor preservation of the slip, which has often flaked off removing the painted decoration, there are not many examples worth including, but nearly every Middle Helladic well contained fragments of large pots in this technique.96 It is tempting to consider it an Attic substitute for the more standard coarse Mattpainted of Class I, but if so its occurrence was not restricted to Athens.97 No. 318 is a large pithos of Cl shape with an elaborate panelled decoration of hatched loz- enges, opposed latticed triangles, and interlocking triangles, but the whole poorly preserved. No. 319 is the better part of a large conical lid with small loop handle and the bottom edge bevelled to fit against the interior flange of a pithos of about the same size as 318. It is similar to the undecorated example 369. The remaining examples are sherds: 320 from the rim of a pithos like 318, 321 the rim and handle of an open bowl like 302-305 of Class I, and 322 from a large closed pot of indeterminate form. No. 323, from a carinated bowl with vertical loop handle, shows the influence of Minyan ware and is of Buck's Shape A6.98 With the exception of 318 the patterns are not noteworthy. It is possible that 371, from a beak-spouted bowl of coarse gritty red clay with traces of creamy white slip, once bore Mattpainted decoration, no trace of which is preserved.99 CLASS III-LIGHT-ON-DARK (324-330; Pls. 22, 73-74) Once again the number' of items in the catalogue minimizes the occurrence of this class at Athens, where most Middle Helladic deposits yielded a considerable quantity.100 Coming from large heavy pots, badly broken and with only a few simple patterns, they add nothing to the better preserved examples. Their simplicity and their resemblance in clay and technical d etails to the coarse undecorated ware would suggest that a good proportion of this class was made locally. Nos. 324-327 are fairly complete amphoras of three different types. Nos. 325-326 of the same shape as 301 (Buck C8) have simpler decoration, almost obliterated, but the long rays of 326 relate the pattern to the more canonical pendant triangles of the Class I example. No. 326 could thus well be a local imitation of an imported early amphora such as 301. No. 324 with 93 Eutresis, p. 168, fig. 235, 3; Zygouries, p. 132, fig. 126, 12. 94 Asine, p. 275, fig. 190, which Persson considers a possible import from Phylakopi. Cf. Caskey's remarks (Hesperia, XXIX, 1960, p. 298) and the example from Lerna V (pl. 70, k) which also has a similar decorative scheme. 95 Hesperia, XXIII, 1954, pl. 7, b (right). 96 Examples noted in R 28:1, S 27:1, S 27:2 and T 26:2. 97 Pithoi in the same fabric have been found at Eutresis and elsewhere (Eutresis, pp. 145, 149, fig. 205, pl. XIV). The pot- tery from an early tholos tomb in Messenia seems also to have been of this White Slipped variety (Hesperia, XXIII, 1954, pp. 159-160, nos. 1-5, pl. 37). 98 Buck, pp. 243, 284. Asine, p. 273, fig. 189, 2 is a particularly good parallel for our fragment. 99 Cf. vases 2 and 3 from the early tholos tomb near Pylos cited above, note 97. 100 Especially from R 28:1, S 27:1, S 27:2, T 24:1. 63</page><page sequence="81">EARLY AND MIDDLE HELLADIC: INTRODUCTION horizontally set loop handles is really a small version of the pithos type vith indrawn mouth (C5).101 Its decoration, a zone of zigzag lines and another of concentric arcs tastefully arranged above the handles, is a simplified version of the scheme on a Light-on-Dark jar of the same shape from the upper Middle Helladic stratum at Lerna.02 The latter in turn is related to the Light-on-Dark Glazed ware jars from Aegina and Asine,l03 which are of Cretan or, more probably, Cycladic inspiration. No. 327 with vertical handles from just below the rim may be an early version of the small two-handled jar (D6), although the rim which is pulled out into two pour channels is unusual.104 Its pattern is almost obliterated. No. 329 is a large hydria with two sets of handles (7), the upper ones vertical and placed on the shoulders as in the C8 tye amphora, the lower hor the izontal lugs resembling those of the closed jar or pithos (C5). Little trace of decoration remains, but it seems to have consisted mainly of large pendant triangles. A similar example comes from the North Slope.105 No. 330 is a pithos or barrel jar (Cl) resembling the fragmentary examples of Class I and II (313-315 and 318) we have already discussed. Its decoration is simpler, consisting merely of crossing diagonal lines and concentric arcs. The most interesting vase in this class is 328, an intact deep bowl with tubular spout and vertical handle. It is listed by Buck under his B4 shape, although most have the basket handle of our undecorated version 370. He claims a Cycladic origin for the shape and points out that the Cycladic examples "have a more exaggerated protrusion at the tip (of the spout) .. None from the Cyclades is reported as having a basket handle."106 Ours is thus more Cycladic than most of the mainland examples, and is very likely an import. Only the pattern of short vertical strokes on the rim is preserved in the original matt white paint; the zone of pendant triangles on the shoulder now appears in the original red surface against the lighter incrustation of the wall. CLASS IV-FINE DARK-ON-LIGHT MATTPAINTED (331-341; Pls. 23, 71) This fine ware was first described by Blegen in his publication of the Korakou material."7 The clay, ranging from greenish yellow to buff or almost white, is well refined, and the vases, which are usually handmade, have thin delicate walls. The patterns in dull black, gray or brown are made up of fine linar motives, with occasional spirals or concentric circles. In some cases (e.g. 333) the panel arrangement and the fine geometric detail anticipate a later Myce- naean (particularly Myc. III B) style in a remarkable manner, as Buck also points out.108 Oc- casionally (333, 336) the vases are wheelmade, and then the attribution to decorated Yellow Minyan or to Fine Mattpainted is purely academic. Nos. 331-336 belong to deep one- or two-handled cups of Buck's shapes All and A12, which constitute the majority of examples in this ware at other sites as well. Only 336 has the strongly carinated profile of All, which was usually equipped with one or two high-swung rib- 101 This example, although published (Hesperia, VII, 1938, p. 338, fig. 20), is not included by Buck and differs somewhat from the other examples of his shape C5. 102 Hesperia, XXIV, 1955, pl. 17, e (from Grave B. 12, almost certainly belonging to "later phases of the period," p. 35). 103 Welter, Aigina, figs. 17-18 (fig. 17 has polychrome decoration with red details superimposed on the white); Asine, p. 277, fig. 191. Persson argues for mainland manufacture under Cycladic influence. 104 The examples cited under D6 by Buck (p. 249) are all late and show the influence of Yellow Minyan in their flat ribbon handles and offset rims (cf. Prosymna, I, p. 383, II, fig. 646). 105 Hesperia, VI, 1937, p. 555, fig. 11, a. 106 Buck, p. 286. Phylakopi, pl. XIX, 8 has a spout much like ours. Cf. Aberg, Bronzezeitliche und Friiheisenzeitliche Chrono- logie, IV, p. 130, fig. 240 (Thera). 107 Korakou, p. 27, type 6. 108 Buck, p. 303. There can, of course, be no question of direct continuity as there is a time gap of 200-300 years, and Buck's hypothesis of a resurgence of native preferences in later Mycenaean seems the only possible explanation. The resemblance between M.H. Mattpainted and Myc. III B does require caution in assigning sherds from unstratified contexts, and of the North Slope material classified as Mycenaean the following seemed to me to be almost certainly Fine Mattpainted: A.P. 1399, 1405-1406, 1416 (Hesperia, VI, 1937, p. 560, fig. 14, a, g, h, r). 64</page><page sequence="82">POTTERY: PERIOD OF LERNA V bon handles under the influence of the Minyan kantharos.109 A12 is less strongly carinated and is distinguished by a rather heavy rolled handle. It was certainly more popular than the three examples cited by Buck would indicate;110 to this type belong 331-332 and probably also 333- 335. The patterns of 331-332 are badly effaced, but a water color of 331 made soon after its discovery showed a pattern of concentric circles with a double hatched lozenge between. No. 332 preserves a circle filled with dots near the handle. Vertical framing lines near the handle and curving arcs on the interior of the lip are characteristic of these cups. The most interesting example is 333, not only because its well-preserved panel decoration anticipates Mycenaean,ll but also because certain technical peculiarities suggest that it may have been a Fehlbrand. The larger fragment has been deeply indented, either accidentally while in leatherhard condition or intentionally to form a pour channel, and the smaller fragment has been burnt to a dark greenish gray color.ll2 The finest example of this class from Athens is the intact hole-mouthed jar 338, which re- produces in Mattpainted technique the well-known Middle Minoan shape,"13 although its im- mediate ancestry should perhaps be sought in the Cyclades.l4 The fine zonal pattern below the rim is Buck's Mot. 8, found only on this vase and on a sherd from Eleusis,ll5 but the S-spiral band descending below the spout occurs in more elaborate form on a jar of similar shape from Grave Beta at Mycenae.l6 This latter should give the general chronological range toward the end of Middle Helladic. I know of no parallel for the melon-like arrangement of vertical lines on the body.l7 The presence, on the wall a little above the base, of a potter's mark lightly incised before firing, which in form is closely paralleled by those on Middle Cycladic pots from Phylakopi, might suggest a Cycladic origin, although somewhat similar marks occur on Coarse ware from Lerna and Asine.18 No. 339, the rim fragment of a rounded pot with plain mouth, may have come from a similar but less globular jar, also with fine linear patterns on the shoul- der and vertical lines on the body. No. 340, a series of non-joining fragments from a larger closed pot, shows a pattern of pendant loops similar to that of 339, repeated on a larger scale on the wall and with horizon- tal bands framing a hatched zigzag pattern.l9 109 Buck, pp. 244, 284-285.

All motives of the composition can be matched in other examples of Fine Mattpainted (Buck's Mots. 49, 118A, 123, pls. 43, 44), and it is the arrangement rather than the details that suggest Myc. III B. 112 Shear, Hesperia, VII, 1938, p. 338, considered it certainly a Fehlbrand, but Homer Thompson inclines to the view that the indentation was intentional (cf. the pour channels on 827 and perhaps more conclusively the rims of Eutresis, pl. XV, 4, p. 158, fig. 220, 1 which are described as "trefoil-mouthed jugs"). In this case the burning of the smaller fragment might be regarded as accidental after breakage. If 333 could be regarded as a certified Fehlbrand, it would be an important argument for local production of this class of Fine Mattpainted, but in the author's opinion the evidence is not conclusive either way. 113 Also Buck, p. 246, B6, where he cites only the Agora vase and some fragments from Korakou (Korakou, p. 26, fig. 35, 8,14) in Mattpainted ware. An imported Middle Minoan jar was found in the M.H. Grave J 4 at Lera along with Argive Minyan and Fine Mattpainted (Hesperia, XXVI, 1957, pl. 43, c), and by the time of Lerna VI this shape had been incorporated into the L.H. I repertory (Hesperia, XXIV, 1955, pl. 16, c). 4 See also Buck, p. 294. Aberg, IV, p. 136, fig. 255 (Thera); Phylakopi, pi. XXV, 1-3 (probably later) but cf. pi. XVIII, 11-12 (fragments of same shape in earlier Mattpainted ware of Group 9, see pp. 116-117). 15 Pr. Eleusis, p. 102, fig. 82, 15, where the lines are doubled. 116 Mylonas, Anc. Myc., fig. 43, b. U7 There is a general resemblance to the White-slipped II Cypriote milk bowls (cf. S.C.E., I, pl. CXIV). A few fragments of such imports were found at Phylakopi (Phylakopi, pp. 158-159, fig. 148), in a deposit which should be contemporary with the Shaft Graves at Mycenae. 118 Phylakopi, pp. 177-180 and table.

Hesperia, XXIV, 1955, p. 34, pl. 15, o-f (Lera); Asine, pp. 283-284, fig. 195, for which Frodin and Persson also draw Cycladic parallels. The oc- currence of these potter's marks may merely indicate close cultural interrelations at the close of the Middle Helladic period, rather than their being proof of Cycladic imports. 19 Perhaps a variant of Buck's Mot. 9; of.

COARSE WARES (Periods of Ler a IV-VI; Pls. 24-27, 71-74) It is unlikely that our material includes anything earlier than E.H. III or the period of Lerna IV. The repertory ranges from very coarse handmade pots, some so crude they are dif- ficult to date out of context (e.g. 384-385) through ordinary coarse domestic ware (the pitchers, amphoras, pithoi, etc. 363-359) to finer wheelmade and well-shaped vases of light buff clay (350-351) which are influenced by Yellow Minyan and are the immediate ancestors of undec- orated Mycenaean. Unlike the Late Neolithic-E.H. I material of the preceding section, there is only a small group with incised or plastic decoration, and that is of a careless and inferior order (379-383). The material in the Catalogue is presented typologically according to shapes: large bowls and cooking pots (342-346), jugs and pitchers (347-354), amphoras (355-357), pithoi (358-368), and a miscellaneous group (369-383) which includes two fragments with potter's marks (377-378) and five with incised and plastic decoration (379-383). The two pots (384-385) from the well shaft burial (I 9:2) are published separately at the end, but in view of their Subneolithic attribution, it seems advisable to consider them first. POTTERY FROM BURIAL I 9:2 (Pls. 27, 71) The two small vases, 384-385, are made of coarse, unusually gritty clay, with a dull orange- red slip, rudely burnished. They do not at all resemble our Neolithic Red Burnished either in technique or in shape. In form they are careless and warped, the conical foot of 384 being higher on one side and the rim of 386 far from a perfect circle. The handles which rise from the rim, small loops with vertical wall attachments on 384 and cleft lugs on 385, have no parallels in our Neolithic material, but are roughly matched in a group of crude Middle Helladic vases from other sites.121 We have presented the evidence of the fill of the shaft, which was predominantly Gray Minyan and Coarse ware, in support of a Middle Helladic date for the burial. On the other hand, the occurrence of a crude pot with a similar handle in Lerna IV,122 as well as the resemblance of the type of burial to the Early Helladic double tomb at Corinth, might suggest that this deposit should be dated somewhat earlier, i.e. to the time of Lema IV or transitional to Middle Helladic. The crude small handmade pitchers 347-348 and the fragmentary cup 376 have a resemblance, if only in their coarseness and irregularities, to the pots from the Metroon burial, but they lack the surfacing and may be considered more standard Middle Helladic Coarse ware.123 COOKING POTS (P1. 24) The cooking pots, 343-346, represent a specialized group. They are all handmade of coarse micaceous clay, heavy but well-fashioned. Nos. 343 and 346 show a blackening of the exterior through use. The latter, although found in a Late Geometric context, agrees more closely with 120 A.P. 1372 and 1373 (Hesperia, VI, 1937, p. 554, fig. 10, e-f); Asine, p. 290, fig. 199, 16; Eutresis, pp. 161-162, fig. 225. m See Miss Goldman's remarks on the deterioration of Middle Heladic household pottery (Eutresis, pp. 175 f.) and of. the handles of fig. 245, 5-6 with those of 84. 2 Hesperia, XXIII, 1954, pi. 9, e, which was found in House A, of the period of Lema IV. 123 No. 848 has fairly close parallels at Eutresis (Eutresis, p. 178, fig. 246, 2) and Asine (Asine, p. 281, fig. 193, 1). For 876, cf. Eutresis, p. 179, fig. 248. 66</page><page sequence="84">POTTERY: PERIOD OF LERNA V Middle Helladic cooking pots, and may be considered a survival along with the fragmentary Minyan ware (283 and 292) found in the same area.124 The raised base of 344 and the high- swung handle (or handles?) of 345 are found in Middle Helladic cooking pots from Asine125 and suggest the influence of Minyan ware. STANDARD DOMESTIC WARE (Pls. 24-27, 71-74) Much of the standard domestic ware finds parallels in the Mattpainted repertory of shapes. This is true of 342, a large open bowl of Buck's shape Al, of the spouted bowl, 370 (B4), which closely resembles ourLight-on-Dark example, 328, of the pithos cover 369 (D3), which parallels the white-slipped example 319, and the belly-handled amphoras or storage jars, 366-357 (C5). This last shape becomes the customary form for undecorated pithoi, occurring in numerous fragmentary examples (359-361 and 363-365) and in the outsize example, 358, where the hand- les are above the greatest circumference. The barrel jar (Cl), which was the popular Matt- painted pithos shape, is not found in an undecorated version, but the wide-mouthed storage jar (C2) occurs in several examples. These may not have had handles, and are distinguished by small decorative bosses,'26 on 362 associated with a small incised chevron and on 377 with a more elaborate potter's mark.127 Of plastically decorated pithos fragments, 366 has a simple raised band with thumbmarks below the neck and 367 has one or more bands with diagonal slashes imitating ropework, both much inferior to the comparable Late Neolithic examples (compare 161, 165-169 with 366; 159, 164 and 170 with 367). No. 368, a squat knob with a cuplike depression, may be from the wall of a very large pithos.l28 The large pitchers, 353-354, and the amphora with vertical handles, 355, are probably less directly connected with Mattpainted shapes. Their closest parallel is the large hydria with vertical handles (C6) found in the Shaft Grave period and in later Middle Helladic levels, for which Buck assumes an evolution during Middle Helladic with some influence of Minyan types.129 The small jug with cut-away neck, 349, of coarse heavy fabric, looks early and has some parallels in early Mattpainted ware,130 but its development into 350-351 is surely due to the influence of Yellow Minyan ware, and one must assume a considerable time span.l31 No. 350 is rolled handmade with a rolled handle, whereas 351 is wheelmade of fine orange-buff clay with a metallic ribbon handle. It is one of the most pleasing shapes evolved in the Middle Helladic period and it leads directly into Mycenaean; whether one terms it Yellow Minyan or finer Coarse ware is a matter of choice.132 The fragments 373-375 also occupy an intermediate position between fine and coarse, and 373 might well be called an imitation of Yellow Minyan. It is wheelmade of light orange-brown clay covered with a thin orange wash; in shape it is an imitation of the Minyan goblet (cf. 295 in Yellow Minyan). 124 Hesperia, Suppl. II, 1939, p. 33, fig. 20 (VII, 9). Published with the Geometric offerings, although Young comments: "The rolled handle is unusual for coarse pitchers at this period, as also the tall shape and shallow neck." The way in which the rolled handle has been thrust through the wall and finished off in a lumpy fashion agrees with other Middle Helladic examples. For the Minyan ware and an obsidian blade from the same cemetery, see ibid., pp. 115-116, fig. 83, B 22-B 25. 125 Asine, p. 283, fig, 194, 2-3. 126 Cf. the complete examples from Asine (Asine, p. 281, fig. 193, 8-9), of which the second is also distinguished by "three small bosses set vertically" on the shoulder. 127 General similarity to G 12 and 13 of Edgar's list from Phylakopi (Phylakopi, p. 179). 378, the base of a small closed pot, has a graffito of three parallel strokes (Edgar's A 5 or A 12) which resembles those on Coarse ware from the filling of Shaft Grave I at Lerna (Hesperia, XXIV, 1955, pl. 15, c, f). 128 Cf. the Middle Helladic knobbed pithoi from Eutresis (Eutresis, p. 34, figs. 35, 1; 41); also the complete E.H. knobbed pithos from Zygouries (Zygouries, p. 120, fig. 112). Neither has the hollowed interior of our knob which could perhaps have been used for a thumbhold when shifting the empty pithos. 129 Buck, p. 296. 130 Buck, p. 246, Shape B9 and references. 131 So also Buck for his Shape B14, p. 295. 132 The surface is unpolished and rather soft, so that the vase is less Yellow Minyan in texture than in shape. 67</page><page sequence="85">EARLY AND MIDDLE HERT,ADIC: INTRODUCTION Little need be said about the incised or plastically decorated fragments 379-383 which show the customary deterioration of this class in Middle Helladic. Similar coarse scratchy incisions are found at Eutresis, as well as on the North Slope, and are related to Valmin's "Adriatic"133 ware. 3. ARTIFACTS (Pls. 28, 77) There are no statuettes or works of sculpture in the Middle ielladic deposits, but this is not unexpected. The Early and Middle Helladic periods represented a decline in such works after the Neolithic floruit, and not until Mycenaean times does production become common.134 The artifacts are all purely utilitarian: oval and spherical grinders (387-390), oval millstones or querns of the well-known saddle shape (391-395) which do not differ from those found in Neolithic contexts, and obsidian blades (400-401). Worth noting is the flint blade with serrated edge, 399, the obsidian arrow-tip of hafted type, 386, from the fill of the Metroon burial shaft, and the large obsidian matrix, 398.135 No. 396 is apparently a paving stone, our only bit of architectural evidence for Early to Middle Helladic times, and 397 is a worked stone of un- certain purpose. From S 27:2, one of the Middle Helladic wells, came five large pieces of staghorn, sawn and whittled, or bored vertically or transversely, for use as handles (402-406). No. 406 shows the branching of the antler, which has been cut off neatly above its root. Such objects do not occur in our Neolithic wells, and may be compared with the worked antler fragments found in transitional Middle Helladic contexts at Asine (i.e. contemporary with Lerna IV), for which Fr6din and Persson claim an Indo-European origin.136 Nos. 407-408 are small conical terracotta spindle whorls, undecorated and differing little from the Neolithic examples, 234-235. 4. RELATIVE AND ABSOLUTE CHRONOLOGY As we have indicated above (p. 51), the absence of any real stratigraphy for the Early and Middle Helladic deposits necessitates an evaluation of our material in terms of what has been found stratified at prehistoric habitation sites in the Argolid and in Central Greece. Among these sites Korakou, Zygouries, Asine, and Eutresis especially furnish valuable parallels, but the newest excavations by J. L. Caskey at Lerna have proved most valuable because of the clear separation of typical Early Helladic (E.H. II) from a later intrusive culture, sometimes called E.H. III, sometimes M.H. I or "transitional to Middle Helladic" at other sites.137 At m Eutresis, p. 179, fig. 250; A.P. 1315-1317, 1320 (Hesperia, VI, 1937, p. 545, fig. 4, a-c, f) wrongly called, in my opinion, Early Helladic. See also discussion under 881 below. 1m For Early Helladic statuettes, see fragment from Lerna IV (Hesperia, XXIV, 1955, pl. 22, j-k); Zygouries, p1. XXI, 1-3; Eutresis, p. 197, fig. 269, 2, 4, 5. They are even rarer in Middle Helladic contexts: e.g. Eutresis, fig, 269, 8 (the head of an animal attached to a ring handle in Gray Minyan clay). A Middle Helladic fragmentary statuette (T 3710) was found in 1965 in the prehistoric deposit in the South Square, M 12:2, and will be discussed by Richard Nicholls in the Agora publi- cation. It has an incised dotted and chevron pattern and does not closely resemble any of the published statuettes. 135 This find consisted of a large piece of obsidian (0.14 x 0.14 x 0.05 m.) and four smaller chunks found in an unstratified context in the central area of the Agora (Section Lambda, which has produced little prehistoric but is not far removed from the prehistoric deposits of the South Road in Sections Tau and Psi). Four small prehistoric sherds were found in the area; they are not clearly Neolithic and may more probably be considered Middle Helladic. Although its exact period cannot be vouched for, it has seemed appropriate to include this enormous matrix. 1m Asine, pp. 253-254, fig. 178. But against this theory, cf. Blegen's red deer antler fragments from Zygouries, House D, which is apparently of the period of Lema III (Zygouries, p. 193, fig. 182). 137 J. L. Caskey, Hesperia, XXIX, 1960, pp. 285ff., especially pp. 299-303. 68</page><page sequence="86">RELATIVE AND ABSOLUTE CHRONOLOGY Lema the burning of the House of the Tiles at the end of Lema III and the designation of its area as taboo by a covering tumulus suggest that the culture of Lerna IV was that of a different people.138 This conclusion is supported by a new house type, the apsidal megaron, ubiquitous bothroi, and new classes of pottery, among them Patterned ware, "Smear Ware," deep bowls with two handles ranging from dark slipped and burnished handmade examples (cf. our 252) to gray wheelmade ones which are in fabric indistinguishable from Gray Minyan, and some exotic pieces with Trojan connections (cf. our 250). There was no break between Lema IV and V, which represents the developed Middle Helladic stratum with the full complement of characteris- tic features: intramural burials in cist graves, Gray Minyan in the usual ring-stemmed goblets (cf. our 272-285), kantharoi (286-289), etc., the first appearance of Mattpainted ware, along with many examples of imported pottery, such as Cycladic duck vases (cf. our 256) and Middle Minoan I and II pots. With Lerna VI we come to the end of Middle Helladic, the time of the Royal Shaft Graves at Mycenae and Late Helladic I. Although the Agora material apparently covers the entire range from Lerna III through VI, the first and last phases are represented only minimally, Lerna IV somewhat more fully, and it is only with Lera V that we have a more or less complete inventory of types. Several questions arise. Should one assume a chronological gap between the Neolithic wells and the later wells? Only a few pieces from the latter (e.g. 238, 239) seem to evolve directly from the former, and the material of Lerna III types is woefully meager. If, however, our Neolithic material is in part contemporary with what has been called E.H. I elsewhere, the actual gap may not be so great. At the lower end too there is an apparent gap between our latest Middle Helladic and our earliest Mycenaean (e.g. Grave XVI, the Lily Bowl Grave), perhaps because Middle Helladic forms may have lasted longer in Athens than in those centers which were to provide the impetus for Mycenaean development (see below, pp. 149-150). Among the pieces which may be coeval with Lerna VI or Late Helladic I in the Argolid, one may cite some of the Fine Mattpainted (e.g. 336, 338), the Yellow Minyan goblet stem (296), and some of the Undecorated and Coarse ware (350, 351, 363, 354, 378). In terms of absolute dates for these deposits we are likewise dependent on other excavations, where externally datable objects such as fragments of Minoan pottery or material susceptible to C-14 analysis have been found. Here again Lerna is especially helpful. Radioactive carbon dates from the destruction of the House of the Tiles range from the twenty-third to the twenty- first century B.C.139 Lerna III was, however, a long period with at least six architectural phases, its beginnings probably going back to middle Troy I and its floruit coeval with Troy II. Wein- berg'40 postulates dates ca. 2800 to 2300 or 2200 B.C. for E.H. II. Lerna IV would then com- prise the last two or three centuries of the third millennium with the beginnings of Lerna V and Middle Helladic dated by the imported M.M. Ia fragments, which ought to be about contempo- rary with the beginning of the XIIth dynasty or the early second millennium.141 Lerna V must have been a fairly long period of perhaps four centuries, since it is not until Lerna VI that we pick up parallels with the Royal Grave Circles at Mycenae and attendant synchronisms with the end of the Second Intermediate Period and the beginnings of the XVIIIth dynasty (1580 B.C.). With this, however, we are dealing with Mycenaean chronology. 188 Ibid., p. 301; J. L. Caskey, C.A.H., I, Ch. XXVI a, 1964, pp. 16-17. Also Weinberg, Rel. Chron., p. 305. 189 Weinberg, Rel.

Good shape with flat bottom, ovoid body and low neck curving concavely into flaring rim. Two small pierced vertical lugs on shoulder. Above each lug a pair of small holes is pierced in the rim. This pot is somewhat reminiscent of the Neolithic Red Burnished biconical jars (1-18), with which it was associated by Shear (Hesperia, VII, 1938, p. 337). It is, however, certainly later, and probably of the period of Lerna IV. The black burnished fabric sug- gests Trojan-Anatolian connections, but no very close parallels have been found. See Blegen, Troy, I, fig. 401, 37.1117, a black burnished pot from Troy IId, which has double lugs with vertical stringholes. Cf. the M.H. I example with 2 pairs of stringholes at rim and no lugs (Asine, p. 265, fig. 184, 8) for which Pers- son also cites Trojan parallels. See also p. 57. E.H. III, probably imported from the Troad. 251.

Two-handled round jar; chip missing from lip, otherwise intact. Brick red clay, rather coarse; black burnished slip, considerably worn, mottled red to black in firing. Squat pot with wide mouth and flaring rim, an- gular body sloping to small depressed bottom, not quite symmetrically placed; two ear-shaped band handles set vertically on shoulder. Two button-like knobs on shoulder front and back. Very irregularly made; one side much higher than the other. The closest parallels to this pot are from Early Bronze Age Anatolia and Macedonia, where examples of globular pots with knobs of Black Burnished ware are common. Cf. Troy, I, p. 333, fig. 398, 35.424, which has horizontal handles and only one knob on each side, from Phase IIg; Thermi, pl. XIII, 30, same general shape as our example from Town I; Pr. Mac., p. 82, nos. 190, 271-2, 316. No. 271 (p. 186, pl. XIV) from Gona was examined in the Museum at Thes- saloniki and is particularly close to ours in its fabric and warped shape. Cf. also the M.H. I (E.H. III ?) pot from Asine with 3 pairs of nipple-like pellets (Asine, p. 265, fig. 184, 11) and note also a general resemblance to the black- slipped two-handled bowls characteristic of Lerna IV (Hesperia, XXIX, 1960, pp. 296-297, pI. 70, i and references to other Proto-Minyan examples). These are more Proto-Minyan in appearance, some being wheelmade, and none seem to have had applied bosses. See also p. 57. E.H. III, probably a Macedonian import.

Similar duck vases are found in early M.H. strata at Eutresis (Eutresis, p. 184, figs. 255, 256, 1), Aegina (Aigina, p. 14, figs. 12-15) and Lerna (Hesperia, XXVI, 1957, pl. 42, d).

Coarse brick red clay, red throughout; highly polished red slip inside and out; handmade. The shape, with a low neat foot-ring, a strong carination at shoulder and small lug handles pierced twice vertically, is one of the most pleasing Middle Helladic creations.

Upper wall bent in sharply; perhaps damaged in manufacture, but cf. pour channels of 327. No handle preserved, and should probably be restored with one rather than two on analogy with 331 and 332. Decoration: two bands below lip, two at shoulder and one above base; shoulder decorated by a panel pattern consisting of a central triglyph of herringbone pattern (Mot. 49, Buck, p. 262, pl. 43) framed by S-spirals (Buck's Mot. 118, p. 275, pl. 44) and dot rosettes (Mot. 123, p. 276, pl. 44). Decoration very neatly and carefully done. The smaller fragment is burnt to a greenish gray. If this pot was definitely damaged in firing, it would be an important indication of local manufacture of this Fine class of Mattpainted ware. Probably Buck's Shape A12 (see 331 and 332). The S-spiral is found on numerous examples of Fine Mattpainted: Eutresis, pl. 15, 3; Zygouries, pl. 14, 1; Prosymna, II, fig. 648, 573, 522, 569, 586, 590; Hesperia, XXVI, 1957, pl. 43, d (Lerna).

A graffito (P1. 23), incised before the firing, occurs near the base directly beneath handle to left of spout. Round-bodied, flat-bottomed pot with plain lip; two horizontal handles round in section at the shoulder. Spout, roughly triangular in section, bridged at the lip, projects horizontally, very finely shaped.

The shape, Buck's B6 (pp. 246, 294) has Middle Minoan parallels (P.M., I, p. 268, fig. 199, a), but occurs also on the Cyclades (Thera: Aberg, IV, p. 136, fig. 255, Phylakopi, pl. XVIII, 11-12) and in the Argolid (Korakou, p. 26, fig. 35, 8, 14) in Matt- painted ware. The Agora jar is the best preserved of these. An imported M.M. jar in Kamares ware was found in Grave J 4 at Lerna (Hesperia, XXVI, 1957, pl. 43, c) and the shape occurs in an early Mycenaean (L.H. I) jar found in the fill of a Shaft Grave at Lerna (Hesperia, XXIV, 1955, pl. 16, c). The running S-spiral is fairly common on the main- land toward the end of Middle Helladic under Minoan influence (Korakou, pp. 24-26, figs. 34, 8; 35, 4; 36, 17; Eutresis, pl. 15, 4). A similar usage, below the rim and descending beneath the spout, occurs on a spouted bowl of Shape B4 from Grave Beta at My- cenae (Mylonas, Anc. Myc., fig. 43, b). The potter's mark, consisting of one vertical and two upward oblique strokes to right, is close to Edgar's signs C 6 and C 9 (Phylakopi, table p. 179) and is the only example I know in Fine Mattpainted from the Mainland, although this is the period of similar marks on coarse ware bases from Asine (Asine, p. 284, fig. 195) and Lerna (Hesperia, XXIV, 1955, pl. 15, c-f).

The possibility exists that it is a Middle Helladic survivor into Geometric times; cf. the frag- mentary Minyan vases (283, 292, and P 5082 cited under 275) found near the Geometric Graves 16 and 17 in the same general area; on the other hand it may merely represent the conservatism of cooking pot designs. Lucy Talcott knew of no exact Geometric parallel and favored an attribution to Middle Helladic. See also pp. 66-67. Middle Helladic? 347. Small Jug. Pls. 24, 71. P 10637. Well, S 27:2.

EARLY BURIAL IN METROON DRAIN CUT: I 9:2 Pls. 27-28, 71; Plan, P1. 78 Hesperia, V, 1936, pp. 20-21, figs. 17-18; A.J.A., XXXIX, 1935, p. 441, fig. 3; I.L.N., Oct. 19, 1935, p. 647, fig. 2. The only pre-Mycenaean burial discovered intact in the Agora was found in April, 1935, during excavations to the east of the Metroon. The grave was of an unusual type: a small side-chamber at the bottom of a circular shaft 0.73 m. in diameter which reached a depth of 3.00 m. below the surface of the bedrock (P1. 78). This shaft was apparently originally cut as a well, since it tapped a generous vein of water. The side-chamber extending 0.80 m. from the side of the shaft to the southeast seems to have been an afterthought, as it was much more roughly and irregularly cut. Within this chamber, his head toward the main shaft, lay an adult male skeleton in crouching position, much crushed and disarranged by the stones and earth.1 The only grave offerings were two simple handmade pots: 385 by the head and 384 by the feet. The shaft had been filled with clay and rocks and broken pottery, which is uniformly of Middle Helladic date.2 It also contained the small obsidian arrow tip, 386. In the preliminary publication, Shear dated this burial to the Neolithic period prior to 3000 B.C. (a date also accepted by Angel for the skeleton). This was presumably on the basis 1 For an anthropological study of this skeleton (27 AA), see J. Lawrence Angel, "Skeletal Material from Attica," Hesperia, XIV, 1945, pp. 291-292, fig. 1, pl. XLI, 2, also pp. 319-320. His conclusion of a hybrid mixture "of all four elements, Mediterranean, 'Megalithic,' Dinaric-Iranian and Alpine" (p. 320), is not conclusive evidence for dating the skeleton to the Neolithic period. 2 Twenty-one fragments of Gray Minyan, three of Mattpainted, and several Coarse ware fragments were counted. Shear explained the presence of M.H. pottery in the shaft as due to its use as a well in M.H. times (A.J.A., XXXIX, 1935, p. 441). 92</page><page sequence="110">EARLY BURIAL IN METROON DRAIN CUT of the pots found with the skeleton and did not take account of the uniform Middle Helladic character of the filling of the shaft. Furthermore, the pots have no close parallels among the Neolithic pottery from the Agora, and although at first glance they seem much cruder than the more standard Middle Helladic fabrics of the filling, they have some fairly close parallels among the coarse handmade pottery from Eutresis and other sites. Consequently, a Middle Helladic date is to be preferred. The type of burial is, however, not the characteristic Middle Helladic cist grave.3 It has its closest parallel in a double grave at the bottom of a shaft discovered many years ago at Old Corinth,4 where, however, the considerable grave offerings were exclusively of the Early Helladic period with some possible Cycladic imports. Such an early date does not seem to be indicated for our burial, since the grave goods correspond better with those from the prehistoric tomb of unbaked brick with upper and lower burials, on the South Slope of the Acropolis, excavated by Skias.5 This also contained obsidian arrowheads (11 of them) and several sherds of Minyan ware; a rough handmade jug was found near by. Although the date of the grave on the South Slope has also been considered Neolithic by some,6 it seems wiser to regard both as unusual grave forms of the earlier Middle Helladic period, perhaps of the transitional phase from Early Helladic (i.e. period of Lerna IV).

THE MYCENAEAN PERIOD INTRODUCTION ven before the Agora Excavations more was known of the Mycenaean period in Athens than of the preceding periods. Monumental stretches of Cyclopean or "Pelasgian" walls, re- vealed during Greek and German excavations of the Acropolis in the nineteenth century,' had proved that here was the site of a Mycenaean citadel comparable to those in the Argolid, and equalling them in the size of its walled area. Scantier traces of terrace walls had localized the site of the palace megaron in the general area of the Erechtheion and the Old Athena Temple but the two stone bases near the Porch of the Maidens are now suspected of being archaic.2 Fragmentary pottery published by Graef revealed contacts with the Argolid going back at least as early as the period of the Palace style in Late Helladic II and made it clear that Athens was part of the Mycenaean world from the late sixteenth or early fifteenth century.3 In the 1930's Broneer's excavations on the North Slope produced important evidence for the latter part of the Mycenaean period. A Mycenaean stairway northeast of the Erechtheion which led down through a postern gate was blocked off in a period of more intensive fortifica- tion, and squatters' houses were built over the staircase, but these too were abandoned, prob- ably in haste. Even more indicative of the troubled times is the secret underground Fountain which Broneer discovered ingeniously constructed in a cleft of the Acropolis rock to the north- west o te etion the Erechtheion near the House of the ArrephoriThe pottery rom the houses, from the construction of the Fountain, and from the fill after its collapse confirms that the develop- ment of Athens is parallel to that of the Argolid strongholds in the later thirteenth century, at a time when there was widespread refortification followed by destruction and abandonment.5 At Athens there is no trace of conflagration, but Desborough6 has recently developed the theory of a shift of population and the gradual infiltration of new elements, a theory which will be considered below. The pottery from Broneer's excavations on the North Slope, briefly but admirably published in Hesperia, is for the most part stored in the Agora Museum, and has been carefully studied 1 P.

How much this is due to the different nature of the deposits-the one essentially domestic, the other sepulchral-and how much to a chrono- logical difference, the Agora material being in general earlier, are questions to which we shall return. 1. THE MYCENAEAN CEMETERY Until the advent of American excavations in the Agora in 1931 very little had been found of a funerary nature to complement the architectural remains on the Acropolis. D6rpfeld had found two small Mycenaean graves between the Areopagus and the Pnyx,8 and a few Mycenae- an stirrup-vases had turned up in the Dipylon area, presumably from disturbed burials.9 In 1931 a rich chamber tomb, unfortunately looted, was found below the Hill of Philopappos; apparently belonging to Late Helladic II, it still contained a few gold oraments and a gem, which have since disappeared.10 The first evidence that the Agora area had been used as a cemetery in Mycenaean times came from a badly disturbed tomb (VIII) in the central area, which was discovered in 1933 and produced the only gold signet ring (VIII-6) so far found in Athens." In 1935 a Mycenaean cist grave (XXXVII) containing a skeleton and two pots was discovered to the north of the Middle Stoa.12 These earlier finds, however, gave little indication of the richness that awaited the excavators with the discovery in 1939 of the large chamber tombs on the north slope of the Areopagus. The unplundered Tomb of the Ivory Pyxides (I) and a badly disturbed one (II) some 15 meters to the west were discovered that year, while two more, the Tomb of the Bronzes (III) and another badly destroyed one (IV) were excavated in 1947, when excavations were resumed after the war.13 With the more intensive excavation of the deeper areas of the Agora in the post-war period the number of Mycenaean tombs and graves increased greatly. Nearly every excavation report from 1947 on records the finding of several, and during the engineering operations for the rebuilding of the Stoa of Attalos in 1952 and 1953 it was difficult to keep up with the large number of newly discovered burials, which were especially concentrated at the northeast corer of the Agora. At present forty-six burial places which can be ascribed to the Mycenaean period have been recorded, but the very fact that two of these were found only in 1965 during final clearing of the South Square14 shows that the actual number must have been far greater. With 7 Parallels to the North Slope pottery (with their A.P. numbers) are cited wherever pertinent. Although it has not seemed necessary or desirable to republish this material, any historical conclusions about Mycenaean Athens must combine the ceramic evidence from the Agora, the North Slope and the Acropolis.

A word of explanation is needed to account for the apparent discrepancy between the 45 burial places cited by Mrs. Vermeule (Hesperia, XXXV, 1966, p. 55) and our Roman numeral series of 41 (which includes N 14:3 not counted by her). We have assigned numbers only to those having an Agora deposit number, i.e. those which yielded pottery or skeletal remains, usually both. Therefore, 5 additional presumed or intended Mycenaean burial places are not included: the unfinished and collapsed chamber tomb on the Hill of the Nymphs (below, p. 178), the two large tombs on the east side of the Kolonos that had been scarped back and almost destroyed (below, pp. 181-183), and two small pit graves in the central area which had been totally cleared out (below, p. 193).

LOCATION AND GEOGRAPHICAL GROUPING The general location of the Mycenaean cemetery to the northwest of the Acropolis con- forms with a fairly widespread Mycenaean practice, whether dictated by religious tradition or some other cause.15 Within this area the slopes of the larger hills seem to have determined the location of the larger and more important chamber tombs, with the Areopagus in first place because of its nearness to the Acropolis. Certainly the four tombs discovered on its north slope (Tombs I-IV) form a special group both in size and in wealth of contents. Another favored location was apparently the east slope of the Kolonos Agoraios where, however, later building operations on the west side of the Agora have all but destroyed at least two large chamber tombs.16 The Hill of the Nymphs seems not to have been especially singled out, but served as an ordinary small cemetery at a somewhat later period (V-VI and unfinished chamber tomb). On the other hand, the Mouseion Hill (or Hill of Philopappos) was the location of an early and wealthy chamber tomb, perhaps part of a larger cemetery now destroyed.l7 By and large, however, our tombs and graves are concentrated in the Agora proper, an area which is now almost entirely level but which in Mycenaean times must have had small rises and declivities which determined the orientation of the dromoi of chamber tombs. A group of tombs and graves (VII-XII) along the west side of the Agora forms one part of this cemetery, and the western orientation of the original dromos of Tomb VII should indicate a slope in that direction and thus a level area or road between the Kolonos and these tombs.18 A much larger group occupies the northeast corner of the Agora. Although we have made a distinction between those to the west of the Stoa of Attalos (XIII-XXI) and those lying beneath and to the east (XXII-XXXVI), they all undoubtedly belonged to the same cemetery. Here the prevailing direction of the dromoi is toward the north, and this would suggest that the central Agora was somewhat higher in Mycenaean times and probably sloped toward the Eri- danos and was skirted by a road running from west to east. A final group of burials (XXXVII- XLI) including the important additions of 1965 lies somewhat apart in the south central Agora, separated today by the Panathenaic Way from the larger group to the northeast. In this con- nection the western orientation of the dromos of the only chamber tomb of this last group (XL) is somewhat puzzling.19 CHAMBER TOMBS Of the total 41 Mycenaean burial places only slightly more than half (21) were certainly chamber tombs, evidenced by some preservation of the dromos or blocking wall or by multiple burials. To these should probably be added five others (VIII-X and XXV-XXVI) where the evidence is less nearly complete, owing to disturbance in the central Agora or under the Stoa of Attalos. There are, however, at least 12 examples of the simpler pit or cist type of grave, in all cases but one (VI) with a single interment, and two others (XXIX and XLI) of unusual types.l19 These other types of burial will be considered below (pp. 103-104), but it should be noted here that the occurrence of types other than the chamber tomb is unusual in a Mycenaean cemetery. 15 Is it accidental that other great Mycenaean cemeteries (Mycenae, the Argive Heraion, Berbati, Dendra) lay to the west of the acropolis ? One is tempted to wonder whether the concept of the "islands of the blest" already goes back to Mycenaean times. 16 Hesperia, VI, 1937, p. 167; XX, 1951, p. 69. But see below, pp. 181-183. 17 Above, note 10. 18 This is the only one of a group of tombs and graves (VII-XI) near the Temple of Ares with a preserved dromos, Ares Tomb, pp. 187-219. 19 Hesperia, XXXV, 1966, p. 56. 19a For XXXV, a disturbed burial, it is impossible to hazard a guess whether it was a chamber tomb or a cist grave. 98</page><page sequence="116">MYCENAEAN CEMETERY ARCHITECTURAL ANALYSIS (Plans, Pls. 79-90) The Agora examples vary from the monumental Tombs I and III on the north slope of the Areopagus, tombs which would have been noteworthy in any Argolid cemetery, down to the miniature Tombs XIII and XX which have chambers of 1 square meter or less. The majority of tombs that could be measured belong, however, in the classification of "small," i.e. with cham- bers of less than 6 square meters, usually with a dimension of approximately 2.0 m. in each direction. Only three exceeded these modest proportions: Tomb I with an area of over 24 sq. m., Tomb III somewhat over 13 sq. m., and Tomb XII just barely over the 6 sq. m. limit. The first two were clearly tombs of important, if not princely, persons and the third was un- finished and seems to have collapsed during construction. Fear of such collapse may indeed have been the main controlling factor in limiting the size of chamber in Athens, where the softness of the rock (a friable marl without the conglomerate ledges of the Argolid) precluded the more spacious proportions found there.20 The small scale of most of the Agora tombs thus seems to have beenof the result of conditions of the terrain rather than of poverty or scarcity of persons to be buried. (Tomb VII with 25 burials and many rich offerings in an area of only 512 sq. m. is a good example.) Despite the precaution of cutting small chambers, the ceilings collapsed early, sometimes while the tomb was being constructed (XII), at other times immediately after an interment (I) or during the course of a relatively short period of use (XL). No roofs were found intact, but in most cases we have no real evidence of their fate, since the rock had been trimmed down by the later Classical builders often to within 10-20 cm. of the tomb floor. The relatively good preservation of the burials, with less evidence for later disturbance than in most Argolid cemeteries,21 suggests, however, that the Agora tombs were sealed in early by fallen bedrock and were not discovered until the building operations of the Classical period. How much rifling was done then we do not know, but the two votive deposits of funerary lekythoi in the Ares Tomb (VII) and the evidence that a fourthat-century monument base was shifted so as to avoid destroying Tomb XV seem to indicate that they were in general respected, if not venerated. In 10 examples the shape of the chamber was well, or reasonably well, preserved. In Tombs I, III, V, XXIV and XL it was roughly rectangular with the transverse axis greater than the longitudinal. Tomb XIV had a roughly square chamber, somewhat deeper than broad, whereas Tombs XXI and XXIII had more deeply curved rear walls, resulting in a roughly semicircular or stilted semicircular plan. Tomb XX was little more than the enlargement of the dromos into a small cubbyhole, and in Tomb VII the chamber was very irregular, almost triangular in shape. The position of the doorway and at least portions of the blocking wall were found in all the above 10 examples except for Tomb XXIV, but the wall was preserved to a significant height only in Tombs I, III, V, XIV and XL. In the first and last it was found intact, and both exhibit the characteristic upward taper of Mycenaean doorways in Argolid tombs. A deep stomion characterized only Tombs I and III; in other examples it was no deeper than the blocking wall. The doorway was fairly accurately centered with respect to the chamber in Tombs I, III, XIV and XL, but in Tombs V and VII it was quite unsymmetrically placed. 20 Rough statistics following the pattern of Blegen's study of the Argive Heraion tombs (Prosymna, I, p. 244) have been compiled for Wace's chamber tombs at Mycenae (Ch. T.), the tombs at Dendra (R. T.D. and N. T.D.) and at Berbati (Berbati). Of 50 tombs at Prosymna, 33 had chambers with an area greater than 6 sq. m., 15 of these with an area greater than 10 sq. m. Of Wace's 24 tombs at Mycenae, 18 chambers were greater than 6 sq. m., 7 of these greater than 10 sq. m. Of 9 tombs at Dendra all were greater than 8 sq. m., 5 of them greater than 15 sq. m. They ranged up to the gigantic proportions of Tomb 10 which had an area of about 33 sq. m. The 7 chamber tombs so far published from Berbati all had an area of 9-10 sq. m. 21 Many Argolid tombs had post-Mycenaean deposits, particularly Geometric. C. W. Blegen, "Post-Mycenaean Deposits in Chamber Tombs," 'ApX. 'E9., 1937, pt. 1, pp. 377-390. See also now the Geometric grave in Berbati, Tomb III (Berbati, pp. 81-90). 99</page><page sequence="117">MYCENAEAN PERIOD: INTRODUCTION The dromos was preserved to a significant length in only a few tombs (I, XIII, XIV, and XL). The 11.0 m. preserved length in Tomb I need not have been much less than its original measurement,22 but in Tomb III the 3.80 m. length was obviously far short of the original. Neither of these dromoi reveals much widening toward the doorway, a feature which charac- terized the tombs at Prosymna and Dendra and made possible wide jambs beside the door- way.23 The less well-preserved dromoi of Tombs V and XV seem also to have been of the "straight" type, whereas those of Tombs XIII, XIV, and XL widen perceptibly. Of these XIII and XIV are comparatively late, whereas XL is early and is the only clearly preserved occurrence of the stepped type of dromos. Tomb VII is unusual for its two dromoi, of which one is clearly a later addition in the interests of expediency.24 The dromos of Tomb XIV, the Tomb of the Niches, one of the best cut and best preserved of the ordinary chamber tombs, was equipped with two lateral niches symmetrically placed, one on either side, giving it a cruciform plan. Although such dromos niches, with child burials as here,25 or with secondary burials,26 occur elsewhere, they are rarely, if ever, used with the same architectural regularity. The neat angular cutting of the jambs and the centering of the doorway also distinguish this tomb. Only in the case of the large Tomb of the Ivory Pyxides (I) does the chamber itself have any architectural pretensions. Here not only the monumental size and costly offerings, but the rock- cut benches along either side wall, the lightly hipped ceiling, and the deep rectangular floor cist show that this tomb belonged to a family of quality. It is our only example with rockcut benches, and although these are found in Argolid tombs, either for interments or for offerings, they seldom display the same symmetry.27 Likewise the burial cist with its single slate covering slab is unusual, and is of quite a different order from the shallower and irregular bone pits wvhich are common in the Argolid and in Athens.28 Such primary burial cists are usually re- stricted to tholoi or to the wealthiest chamber tombs, and even in these they seldom attain the regularity of ours, nor is the single covering slab customary.29 One is reminded rather of the rockeut and built tombs of Crete in the last days of the Palace at Knossos, a period which should be contemporary with our tomb.30 22 If one can draw conclusions from the Argolid chamber tombs, dromoi from 11-12 up to 17-18 m. long are typical for those having chambers measuring more than 20 sq. m., but of course the gradient of the hill is the actual controlling factor. 23 At the Argive Heraion the divergence toward the doorway is especially marke ad d can readily be observed on the plans (Prosymna, , pls. 2-40), the measurements often being in a 1:2 or 2:3 ratio (Tombs 34, 1.05-2.02 m.; 42, 1.05-1.98 m.; 7, 1.15-2.33 m.; 2, 1.30-2.02 m.; 3, 1.05-2.20 m.). This feature is less marked at Dendra, where only Tomb 9 has so marked a widening (1.0-2.15 m.) and Tomb 10 (2.15-2.55 .) is er to our Tomb ) I (1.90-2.40 m.). At Myenae the dromoi appear straighter, although Tombs 502, 515, 529, and 533 have marked widening. There is perhaps some relation of this feature to the "broad" and "narrow" types as defined by Wace (Ch.T., pp. 124-125) and Blegen (Prosymna, I, pp. 232-233), where however the terms apply to the overall proportions of length to width. 24 Ares Tomb, p. 193. 25 Prosymna Tomb 30 (Prosymna, I, pp. 73, 235); Berbati Tomb 12 (Berbati, pp. 68-71, fig. 51); Perati, Tomb 23a (Epyov, 1957, p. 19, fig. 18); Asine, Tombs 1:3 and 4 (Asine, pp. 171-175, 391-392).

These benches were used either for an interment, often secondary, or for offerings as in our tomb. 28 See the discussion of such bone cists by Blegen (Prosymna, I, pp. 245-247). 22. Of the 87 cists found at the Argive Heraion, only two (both in Tomb 45) contained a primary interment. 29 See shafts I, II, and III of Tomb 9 at Dendra, which were rectangular but had multiple covering slabs (N. T.D., pp. 51- 56, fig. 61); shaft I of Tomb 10 without covering slabs (bid., pp. 59-68, figs. 75, 87); and the irregularly-shaped burial pits I and III of the tholos at Dendra (R. T.D., pp. 13-18, figs. 11, 13, 15). The tholos at Vaphio contained a burial cist ('Ep. 'Apx., 1889, pp. 130-172; also Mylonas, Myc. M.A., p. 126); there were two in the tholos at Myrsinochorion (B.C.H., LXXXI, 1957, pp. 558-559) and others in the destroyed tholos at Pylos (A.J.A., LXII, 1958, p. 178, pl. 40, figs. 12-13; W. Taylour, The Mycenaeans, Cambridge, 1964, pp. 80-82, pl. 24). None of these was apparently roofed with a single slab. 30 The typical form of interment in the contemporary Warrior Graves at Knossos was either directly on the floor or in wooden coffins (Hood, B.S.A., LI, 1956, p. 86) and in terracotta larnakes in the slightly later chamber tombs at Zafer Papoura (Evans, P. T.K., pp. 6ff.). However, neat and deep rectangular burial cists are characteristic of the vaulted tombs at Isopata, 100</page><page sequence="118">MYCENAEAN CEMETERY MANNER OF INTERMENT AND FUNERAL RITES The burial cist of Tomb I, clearly a burial cist albeit empty, was unique among the Agora tombs, with the possible exception of one in the badly destroyed adjacent Tomb II. Another unusual method of burial is found in Tomb XL, where the first two burials had been placed in wooden coffins.31 Mrs. Vermeule has noted the significance of this practice in connection with a small group of wealthy tombs in the Argolid and in Crete at approximately the time of the fall of Knossos.32 In the light of this new discovery, one is reminded of the traces of wood, ac- companied by blue pigment and ivory rosette inl inlays, in the much wealthier Tomb III. Here, however, since the traces of wood were all found to the right of the skeleton, the original sug- gestion of a low wooden table on which the bronze sword, razor and bowl (III-17 to 20) were placed seems preferable.33 The majority of interments were placed directly on the floor of the chamber, the skeleton on its back in an extended or only slightly contracted position. Single burials in diminutive chamber tombs like XIII and XX were treated more like those in pit graves, the five-and-a- half year old child in XX being in a curled-up position. Surprising in comparison to the cham- ber tombs at Mycenae and the Argive Heraion is the large number of more or less intact burials. Of the 68 skeletons recognized by Angel in 11 chamber tombs (III, V, VII, XIV, XV, XVIII, XX, XXIII, XXIV, XXXIV, and XL) no less than 25 seem to have been in their primary position, a contrast to the many bone piles in the Argolid with their confusion of swept- up remains. This would certainly suggest that the individual tombs in Athens were used over a shorter span of time, probably because of the tendency of the roof to collapse. Where the burials were intact no consistency could be observed in the orientation of the skeletons, either in respect to the doorway or to the cardinal points, and one must assume that expediency of burial dictated position. In tombs having a somewhat longer history, many of the same practices used in the Argolid can be observed. Bone cists, or piles of swept-aside bones from previous interments, were noted in Tombs IV, V, VII, X, XIV, VXXI, X, and XXIV (at least 12 people, , 8 in two separate pits). The Argive system of spreading a layer of sand over previous interments34 is found only in the Ares Tomb (VII), where such a sterile stratum separates the later Myc. III C burials from the earlier ones. This tomb, despite its modest size, contained the greatest number of interments (25).35 The practice of general fumigation with a thorough burning of earlier re- mains, noted at the Argive Heraion,36 is not found in our tombs, although in Tomb XL there is some evidence that a fire had been lit between the time of the coffin burials C and D and that of burial A.37 A different type of burning, more directly connected with funeral rites than with purification, was noted in Tombs I and III. The former presents many problems because of the empty both the Royal Tomb and Tomb 1 (Evans, P.T.K., pp. 136-145, esp. pp. 143-144; T.D.A., pp. 6-13) as well as the rock- cut Tomb of the Doube Axes (Tomb 2, T.D.A., pp. 33-59). The occurrence of rockcut benches on opposite walls enhances the resemblance of this last tomb to ours. 31 Hesperia, XXXV, 1966, pp. 62ff., figs. 1, 2. 32 Ibid., pp. 69-72, notes 7-11 for references to other examples, the best preserved coming from Katsaba in Crete (Alexiou, KplrT. XpovIK&amp;, VI, 1952, pp. lff.). 33 The alternative suggestion of a bier used for bringing in the corpse (cf. the examples at Prosymna, Tombs 29, 42, and 10, Prosymna, I, p. 249) and its re-use as a table for the offerings seems less likely, for it was apparently a fairly elaborate piece of furniture with traces of blue paint and probably inlaid ivory rosettes, see below, pp. 171, 177. 34 Ch. T., p. 137. 35 The number 14-16 given in the original publication (Ares Tomb, p. 189, note 6) must be raised to 25 in the light of further skeletal analysis by J. L. Angel. 36 This was a more common practice than spreading a layer of sand and was noted in the following tombs at the Argive Heraion (2, 3, 7, 10, 14, 24, 34, 41, 42, 44 with especially great conflagrations in 7 and 14, Prosymna, I, p. 250). 37 Hesperia, XXXV, 1966, p. 61. 101</page><page sequence="119">MYCENAEAN PERIOD: INTRODUCTION burial cist and absence of human remains, problems which are best deferred until a full de- cription of the tomb is given (see below, pp. 158ff.). Here, however, we should note the pres- ence of an ash pile in the center of the chamber, which had obviously been disturbed since a quantity of ash was strewn over the lid of the cist and extended down into the grave cutting. Furthermore, at the back of the chamber in the area of a group of small objects (1-17 to19 and 1-23), which may have been removed from the cist, were found numerous small scraps of bone and several large canine-looking teeth. Since these have proved to be animal rather than human,38 they cannot have anything to do with the actual burial, but must rather point to the sacrifice of a pet dog39 or the remnants of a funeral meal.40 In Tomb III we have clear evidence for a sacrificial pyre, probably in connection with the last interment. Although no blackened area was found on the floor of the chamber or in the extant part of the dromos, the contents heaped into the three-handled jar (III-15) found opposite the door are clearly the remnants of such a pyre. Bits of carbonized wood, blackened ivory, vitrified sherds of pottery including a kylix stem, and a few scraps of bone from a small animal reveal the type of sacrifice.41 From the Agora little information was obtained concerning the nature of the dromos fill, since the cemetery had been so greatly encroached upon by later builders and original fill was found only in the dromoi of Tombs I, III, V, XII, XIV, and XL, and in a substantial amount only in the first and last. However, in both these tombs fragments of pottery in the dromos join fragmentary vases in the chamber and involve some difficulty with the canonical theory that they represent a sweeping out of the chamber at the time of a later interment. Tomb I was presumably used only once, and in Tomb XL fragments of the teacup (XL-9) were found under the coffin of the first burial, suggesting a ritual smashing.42 Apart from the niche burials of Tomb XIV, where two children had been buried in the right-hand niche and one in the left, primary interments which did not involve opening the blocking wall of the doorway, no other skeletal material was found in the preserved dromoi.43 With the necessity for frequent re-opening of chamber tombs for subsequent burials, one must assume some sort of tomb marker visible on the surface, once the dromos was filled in. No proper grave stele was found in any of the 52 tombs at the Argive Heraion, but the use of a large boulder above the door was suggested by Blegen.44 Agora Tomb XL has revealed the existence of a worked stone stele, which although broken and built into the upper filling of the doorway, is the first yet recognized at Athens,45 and it now seems likely that the rough limestone slab (XXIV-24) with face and sides worked smooth, which was found in the cham- ber of Tomb XXIV, may be a fragment of another such stele.46 38 Examined by William Phelps in August, 1966. He found evidence for pig, sheep or goat, and possibly dog (one split tooth). It therefore looks more like the remnants of a meal than a sacrifice. 39 Noted by Persson in the tholos at Dendra (R. T.D., pp. 39, 69-70) and in two of the chamber tombs at Mycenae (Ch. T., p. 145: Tombs 505 and 533). 40 See Mylonas, Myc. M.A., pp. 94, 99, 109, 113, 133 and 183 for references to funeral meals, a custom which seems to go back to the Shaft Grave period. Also Anc. Myc., pp. 132, 134, 146, 148. 41 See especially the remains from Pit IV in the Tholos at Dendra (R. T.D., pp. 40-41) and Persson's remarks on the sacrificial pyre (ibid., p. 70). 42 The evidence for Tomb I will be discussed in detail under the tomb description (below, pp. 158ff.). Mrs. Vermeule suggests ritual or accidental smashing to explain the broken and incomplete vases (9, 11 and 12) in Tomb XL (Hesperia, XXXV, 1966, p. 67). Persson also assumed ritual smashing to explain a stirrup-vase and a beaked jug found partly in the King's grave and partly in the dromos of the Dendra tholos (R.T.D., pp. 68-70). Wace and Blegen seem to have restricted this practice to the kylikes used by mourners in drinking their farewell toast (Ch. T., p. 131; Prosymna, I, pp. 237-238). 43 A Protogeometric cist burial of a child was, however, made in the original dromos of Tomb VII (Ares Tomb, pp. 200- 201). John Travlos has also suggested that the Mycenaean cist grave XIX was set down in the dromos of the adjacent chamber tomb XVIII, but since the dromos has been completely destroyed, this remains at best conjectural. 44 Prosymna, I, p. 237. 45 Hesperia, XXXV, 1966, pp. 59, 77-78, no. 15. 46 It seems too small and too well-worked to have served as a covering slab for one of the bone cists. 102</page><page sequence="120">MYCENAEAN CEMETERY PIT AND CIST GRAVES Over one-third of the Mycenaean burial places in the Agora were definitely not chamber tombs. There were 12 certain, and 3 probable, examples of the simpler cist or pit type, where a single body had been deposited in a rectangular or oval cutting often covered with slabs of stone. These were scattered throughout the chamber tomb necropolis with the exception of the Areopagus and Kolonos Agoraios areas, and it is difficult to make any chronological distinc- tion between the two types. Apart from the late Grave VI, which is clearly Myc. III C, the others, like the chamber tombs, run from Myc. II B through III A or the transition to III B, i.e. from the second half of the fifteenth century to somewhat after 1300 B.C. One is consequently forced to examine the reasons for the occurrence of the simpler type in an era in which the chamber tomb with multiple burials was the dominant form, indeed at most Mycenaean sites the only acceptable form, apart from occasional pit burials of children.47 However, in our cemetery only five pit graves (VI, XI, XVI, XXXVI, and XXXIX) contained child burials, and an equal number contained adults (XVII, XIX, XXVII, XXVIII, and XXXVII).48 Since this form of interment was clearly not restricted to children in Athens, one may ask whether it represents a cheaper and poorer mode of burial. For adults the answer would seem to be affirmative, if one can judge from the solitary pots deposited in Graves XIX and XXVIII, or the two pots and bronze knife of Grave XVII. For children, however, there was clearly no stigma attached to burial in a pit grave. The little girl of less than two buried in Grave XVI had been showered with offerings: a necklace with a gold pendant, an ivory comb and pin, ten vases including the beautiful Lily Bowl (XVI-1), and a group of sea-shells. Together they constitute one of the richest inventories of a single burial in the Agora cemetery. In Grave XXXIX the offerings were fewer, but still considerable, three good pots and a necklace of minute beads. In Grave VI, on the other hand, with two children crammed on top of each other and a single Granary style cup as their only offering, we are clearly dealing with an impoverished burial, which may be a reflection of the troubled times. The question arises whether there is a genuine distinction between pit and cist graves and, if so, what is the relation of the latter to the earlier Middle Helladic cist graves and to the later Submycenaean type found in the cemeteries of the Agora, Kerameikos and Salamis. Since Desborough has recently proposed that the Submycenaean cist burials represent a new type intrusive from the North which first comes in at the end of the Mycenaean period,49 it seems worthwhile to examine the evidence for Mycenaean cist burials in some detail. The distinction between pit and cist graves made by Desborough is perhaps artificial: that cist graves were covered with roofing slabs, pit graves were not and were furthermore usually restricted to the burials of children. I should prefer a distinction based on the shape of the cutting and the relation of the body to the cutting. Pit graves are in general small and oval with the body contracted, whereas the genuine cist, especially as used in the later cemeteries, was long and narrow with the body extended and filling practically the entire grave cutting. Thus, Grave VI would be a good example of a pit burial, XXXVII of a cist grave (even though it had no preserved cover slabs). With the child burials in Graves XVI and XXXIX we are dealing with rectangular cuttings of considerably greater dimensions than the body; while they may re- present a continuation of the wealthier cist or shaft graves at the end of the Middle Helladic period, they seem to have little to do with the new type of cist grave discussed by Desborough. 47 Note the examples from Voula (Aliki Glyphada) cited by Desborough, L. Mycs., p. 33, note 13. 43 In two other examples of the family cemetery (VIII-XI) the pits had been cleaned out. In three further examples (XXX, XXXV, and XXXVIII) the form of grave is too uncertain to count. 49 Desborough, L. Mycs., pp. 33, 37-38, 112-113 and passim. He admits the continuation of the Middle Helladic cist grave form at Eleusis and in a few other isolated examples, but seems to me to have minimized its usage in Athens. 103</page><page sequence="121">MYCENAEAN PERIOD: INTRODUCTION On the other hand, Graves XVII, XIX, and XXXVII seem true cist graves, and cover slabs were preserved in XVII and XIX. The cuttings range from 1.40 to 1.90 m. in length and are only 0.50 to 0.60 m. in width, with an adult burial in each case.50 Although Desborough may be right that the cemeteries of the Kerameikos and Salamis rep- resent a new intrusive type of burial, the Mycenaean cemetery in the Agora shows the exist- ence of single adult burials in long rectangular cuttings, sometimes-(perhaps always, if the evidence were better preserved)-roofed with covering slabs, and going back to the beginning of the fourteenth century.51 Together with these were pit burials, both of children and adults, and oversized rectangular cists for children. All of these are probably derived from Middle Helladic types, and they should thus be compared with the Mycenaean graves at Eleusis52 rather than the Submycenaean cemeteries. Since there is nothing that distinguishes our cist graves from contemporary chamber tombs in their contents, they should be regarded as the survival of an older form rather than the introduction of a new one.53 UNIQUE TYPES Two of our burials do not conform to either of the other two main groups. Grave XXIX has been described as a pit grave with one side closed off by a wall of fieldstones,54 but several features seem inconsistent with this explanation. Actually, there is an outer walled cist and an inner rockcut cist as large as the chamber of many of our tombs (1.50 by 2.0 m.), and further- more the interment and offerings have been tucked away against the far wall as if allowance had been made for subsequent burials. One wonders whether this was intended for a chamber tomb, with the dromos and blocking wall as wide as the chamber, or whether it was open above and thus a kind of cist or shaft grave, comparable perhaps to the pit graves in the Zafer Papoura cemetery,55 or to the abortive chamber tomb XXXIX at the Argive Heraion.56 Since the rock had been trimmed down by the builders of the Stoa terrace, we have no information about the roof. Grave XLI is a simple burial in the mouth of a disused well, which was found in the summer of 1965 at the south end of a trial trench dug through the South Square.57 Its single offering, the crooked kylix (XLI-1), suggests a late period roughly contemporary with the upper burials in the Ares Tomb (VII), with the children's pit grave (VI), and with the refuse fills in the dromos of Tomb XII and the Kylix Pit 0 7:4. OFFERINGS All the Mycenaean tombs and graves with the exception of the cleaned-out tombs under the Stoa of Attalos (XXX, XXXIII, XXXIV) and another in the central area (XXXVIII), were equipped with at least one funeral gift. POTTERY Pottery constitutes the major part of the offerings, a total of 208 vases from tombs, with more from disturbed areas adjacent to the cemetery. This material will be discussed more fully 50 Grave XXVIII, with an exposed cutting of 1.30 by 0.60 m. and with three stone slabs tumbled in the grave and a single interment, should be of the same type. 51 Note the Myc. III A:1 ewer fragment XXXVl-2. 52 West Cemetery: nppaccK&amp;, 1952, pp. 58-70; 1953, pp. 77-87; 1956, pp. 57-62. See also Mylonas, Myc. M.A., pp. 110-111. 53 Perhaps the difficulty in cutting chamber tombs that would not collapse led to the continuation of the older form in Athens. 54 Actually a second wall was discovered a little further to the southeast, leaving a passage 0.45 m. wide between them without any trace of covering slabs, bones or offerings, although the base of a kylix (XXTX-1) was embedded in the stones of the north wall of the outer cist. 55 Evans, P.

The number of vases in individual tombs ranges from the single pots of Graves VI, XIX, XXVIII, and XLI to large numbers in tombs with multiple burials (26 in VII, 21 in XXIV). With the exception of the remains of a pyre in III-16, all pots were found empty, but one must assume that they originally held substances thought useful to the dead in his journey to the underworld.58 The large vases (three-handled jars, kraters and amphoras) probably contained wine, which could be poured from the ewers and pitchers into kylikes and cups for actual drinking by the funeral party and for symbolic refreshment for the deceased. The open shapes like the shallow handleless bowls and bowls with ribbon handles (III-12 and III-4) and the kalathos (VII-24) may have contained offerings of solid food,59 whereas the small squat alabastra so frequent in our tombs doubtless held perfumed oil or unguent. A few other shapes seem to have had a more specialized function: feeding bottles (XIV-6 and 7, XXXIX-3) and smaller askoi (XVI-8 and 9) which were definitely associated with the burials of small children, and the ritual vases from Tomb XXVI, which support Blegen's theory of the burial of a priest in Tomb 44 at the Argive Heraion.60 None of our tombs contained vessels of precious metal, although the burial cist in Tomb I may have been originally so equipped. However, in both this tomb and in the neighboring Tomb of the Bronzes (III) a special class of imitation silver vases, where the surface of the pot has been sheathed with a thin layer of tinfoil, has been recognized.61 BRONZES Bronze vessels were found in three tombs: the long-handled "ladle" or more probably lamp62 found just inside the door of Tomb I (1-22), the poorly preserved shallow bowl found on the table with the swords in Tomb III (III-20), and the small kalathos-shaped bowl with wishbone handles in the diminutive Tomb XIII (XIII-1). Costly bronze weapons which were associated with the Mycenaean warrior aristocracy occurred in only one tomb. In Tomb III a long horned rapier (III-17) and a short sword or dagger (III-18) were found on a wooden table beside the third burial, and the gold-plated rivets near by show that these were luxury pieces of the same general type as those current at the time of the fall of Knossos.63 The fragmentary bronze sword or dagger (409) from the Bouleu- terion Plateia, which probably came from one of the large destroyed tombs along the east side of the Kolonos, is of a different type. Although poorly preserved, it seems to belong to a shorter slashing weapon with flanged hilt and without a midrib.64 Other weapons from our tombs are a badly corroded dagger (XV-4) and the tip of another (VII-28), a simple bronze knife (XVII-3), and a monumental spearhead, perhaps used for boar-hunting, found in the Tomb of the Coffins (XL-5).65 To these might be added the collec- 58 The alabastron XL-2 was filled with a pale crumbly earth, possibly unguent.

The large ivory pyxis (1-16), decorated with a spirited and savage scene of two winged griffins of Minoan type attacking two deer and two fawns amid a rocky landscape, was well described and illustrated by Shear in the original publication of this tomb and has already earned a place with the finest Mycenaean carved ivories.69 Whether one emphasizes the Minoan inspiration of the theme or the Mycenaean transformation along more abstract lines, the style clearly represents the fusion that resulted from the presence of Mycenaeans at Knossos in the last days of the palace, a period which coincides in time with the date of our tomb.70 Whether it was something of an heirloom brought back from Knossos or originated in the Argolid workshop which seems to have been responsible for most of the pottery found in this tomb, it has a strongly metropolitan character and can hardly be claimed for local Athenian work.7' The small ivory pyxis (1-17), only slightly more than two inches in height and decorated with three zones of nautili with dotted tentacles, has a goldsmith-like delicacy. The handles, in the shape of figure-eight shields, were three in number and were dowelled on separately. Perhaps because of its small size it lacks such technical refinements as the double bottom and tin lining of the large example.72 It also must have originated in a metropolitan workshop and seems to have been of a more traditional type, for the same combination of nautili and handles in the form of figure-eight shields occurs in an alabaster example, at twice the scale of ours, from a thirteenth-century tomb at Antheia in Achaia.73 66 Blegen, Prosymna, I, pp. 347-348, suggested the possibility that these were offensive weapons or meat cleavers. If so, we are left with no candidate for a razor. 67 For pins with crystal heads, cf. Blegen, Prosymna, I, pp. 293-294 and examples cited; II, fig. 575, 13, 14. 68 Prosymna, I, pp. 351-352; II, figs. 215, 6, 7; 543, 5; 196; 443, 2; 485, 3. These are all small scale pans, usually pierced at the rim with four holes, and with no remains of the balance, which it is conjectured may have been of wood. In our example no trace of the pans survives, suggesting more a symbolic balance like the gold examples from Shaft Grave III at Mycenae (Schliemann, Mycenae, p. 197, nos. 301-302, Karo, S.G., pp. 55-56, pl. XXXIV). The more functional pans, like those from the Argive Heraion, may have served a practical purpose like the weighing out of cosmetics; they often accompany mir- rors and other feminine equipment. 69 Shear, Hesperia, IX, 1940, pp. 283f., figs. 27-29; Helene Kantor, "Ivory Carving in the Mycenaean Period," Archaeology, XIII, 1960, pp. 14-25, fig. 3; Vermeule, Gr.B.A., p. 219, pl. XXXVI, B-C; Mylonas, Myc. M.A., fig. 141. 70 Miss Kantor's date of possibly before 1400 B.C., and the suggestion that the pyxis was something of an heirloom when it was buried, is I think preferable to Mrs. Vermeule's dating after the fall of Knossos. Since the pottery in this tomb is clearly Myc. II A :1, it is difficult to make the pyxis any later; and whatever absolute dates are assigned, it is generally recognized that the fall of Knossos is contemporary with the end of that phase (see Verneule, Gr.B.A., pp. 144-145). The new pyxis from Katsaba with the capture of a wild bull (B.C.H., LXXXVIII, 1964, p. 846, fig. 3) is earlier and apparently in the pure Minoan style of the earlier fifteenth century. 71 Less well preserved pyxides of similar scale and slightly tapering form, revealing the original section of the tusk as in ours, were found by Tsountas in chamber tombs at Mycenae and are now displayed in the National Museum ('Eq. 'ApX., 1888, pl. 8, 6). These have never been fully published, but will be the subject of a special study by Mrs. Agnes Sakellariou. Vermeule, Gr.B.A., p. 343, note 18, refers to a pyxis fragment with griffin attacking a bull from Tsountas' Tomb 27. 72 See description in Catalogue, below p. 166. 73 nlpaKTrK&amp;, 1937, p. 91, fig. 10.

The other ivories are less elaborate than those from Tomb I. From Tomb III came four rosettes and several other small fragments of carved ivory (1-21) which were presumably used as decorative inlays on the wooden table beside the third burial. The Ares Tomb yielded an ivory comb with central medallion (VII-31) like some from the Argive Heraion75 and also six fragments of at least two bone pins or hair ornaments (VII-32) resembling the barrettes from Tomb I. The Lily Bowl Grave (XVI) produced another type of comb (XVI-12) with a straight top and simple mouldings, as well as fragments of a straight pin (XVI-13). A similar ivory comb of simple form (XXIII-7) was found in Tomb XXIII. JEWELRY Of the more sumptuous offerings such as the gold necklaces, earrings, bracelets, rings found in the wealthiest chamber tombs of the Argolid,76 the Agora tombs produced little, although it is probable that the body removed from the cist in Tomb I was richly bedecked. Nonetheless, a badly disturbed tomb found in 1933 produced a gold signet ring (VIII-6), the only one so far found in Athens. Although small and relatively unimpressive in comparison with the finest Minoan-Mycenaean signets, this ring has attracted considerable attention because of its possibly mythological subject.77 A male figure striding to the right, either bull-headed or wearing a bull mask, is followed by two flounce-skirted women, the first seemingly attached by two curving bands or "fetters" to the man. Shear immediately proposed a connection with the legend of the Cretan Minotaur and the sacrifice of the Athenian maidens, but other scholars have been less sure of the bull-headed character of the man, and have proposed religious rather than mythological interpretations. The Reverend V. E. Kenna has recently examined the ring with me, impressions have been taken, and a new drawing has been made which seems more accurate than the one originally published.78 His observations are described more fully in the Catalogue (p. 192), but here one might note that he thinks that the bezel was re-engraved, which accounts for a certain carelessness of drawing and some peculiarities. The male figure, he believes, is wearing a bull mask, comparable to those found on male ministrants on cylinder seals in Cyprus,79 and although he disavows any connection with the Minotaur legend, the presence of a bull-headed or bull-masked male on an Athenian ring is nonetheless provocative of speculation (see below, p. 156). However, if our ring has any connection with the Theseus legend, it constitutes an additional argument for pushing this back into an early period. The context of the ring was clearly the first half of the fourteenth century B.C. and not about 1200 B.C.80 74 No exact parallels for these have been found at other sites. The serration of the curved pieces looks suitable for keeping the hair from slipping, but there is no visible means of fastening nor of attaching the plate to the pin. 75 Prosymna, II, fig. 419, 2 from Tomb 14. 76 Tomb 10 at Dendra was exceptionally wealthy in gold jewelry (N.T.D., pp. 75ff., figs. 89, 92-93, pls. III, V, VII), but enough has been found in other chamber tombs at Mycenae, the Argive Heraion, etc. to suggest that the early burials were wealthy and that much of the gold has been removed (see Ch.T., p. 191). 77 Hesperia, IV, 1935, pp. 319-320; T.

Kenna part of the original engraving). The new drawing was made in 1964 by Miss Hero Athanasiades. 79 H. B.

This pendant compares favorably with the individual mem- bers of fine gold necklaces from Dendra and the Argive Heraion.81 Simpler gold beads, either elliptical and fluted (I X-2) or spherical and plain (XIV-10 and XXI-12), were found in single examples in three other tombs, in two cases associated with necklaces of paste beads. The latter, mostly in poor preservation, were found in seven tombs (VII, XIV, XVI, XXI, XXTTT, XXIV, and XXXIX). These range in color from white to pale green, yellow and blue, and include most of the well-known shapes found at the Argive Heraion: plain spherical, melon-fluted, tubular, annular and small spherical.82 In only one case (VII-33) was there a possible trace of gold leaf. The paste beads were often accompanied by individual beads of quartz, carnelian, or other semi-precious stone (XVI-11, XXI-12, XXIV-22). Three amethyst beads, all glo- bular (VIII-7 and 8; XXIV-22) were probably imported from Egypt, and confirm the early chronological range of our tombs, at the transition from Late Helladic II to III.83 There is only one occurrence of amber, an amygdaloid bead from the left wrist of skeleton D in Tomb XL (XL-16). From the same skeleton came our only engraved sealstone, a carnelian with a flying eagle (XL-17) which has been well described by Mrs. Vermeule.84 Its context, not much after 1400 B.C., confirms the existence of a careless, linear style of engraving at a fairly early period. EVIDENCE FOR FUNERARY COSTUME Here may be considered three disparate types of object: gold leaf repousse ornaments, lead wires, and steatite whorls or buttons. Ever since Schliemann's discovery of countless gold foil ornaments in the Shaft Graves at Mycenae, there has been little doubt that these served to bedeck the funeral shroud, those with small holes sewed into position, those without either glued or merely laid in position.85 Such a practice seems to have been reserved for royalty or the nobility. Only in our two wealthiest chamber tombs on the north slope of the Areopagus did such ornaments occur. In Tomb I a total of 128 separate pieces (1-26 to 29) of five different types (ivy leaf, shell, two sizes of rosette and plain discs) were found, concentrated near the cist and cover slab, where they had presumably fallen off the body as it was being removed. In Tomb III, 38 small gold rosettes were found in the northeast corner of the chamber (III-22), not immediately connected with any of the three skeletons. It has been conjectured that they may have decorated a cloak or garment hung on a peg in the wall.86 More enigmatic are the pieces of lead wire found in three of our tombs (VIII-10, IX-3, and XXVI-6 and 7) as well as in those of the Argolid, where they have been variously interpreted as wires for trussing the corpse in position, for sealing the tomb or some particular deposit, or most recently as dress weights to stiffen the flounces.87 Unfortunately our three tombs were too badly disturbed to contribute additional evidence, but elsewhere the proximity to the bones makes the first or last theory preferable to the second. Holmberg88 considered the evidence 81 Prosymna, II, figs. 577; 359, 2. N. T.D., p. 78, fig. 92, 1, pl.

Karo, S.G., 1930-1933, pp. 38-40,189-191. Persson, N. T.D., pp. 111-119 attempted to revive the theory that they decorated wooden coffins (originally proposed by Stais, 'Ep. 'Apx., 1907, pp. 31ff.) but the evidence from Grave Circle B is against this (see Mylonas, Myc.M.A., pp. 92-93). 86 Hesperia, XVII, 1948, p. 157. 87 Blegen, Prosymna, I, pp. 255; Persson, N.T.D., p. 50 with reference to the unpublished evidence from Berbati. 88 Thanks to A. Akerstrom I have been able to see photostats of the as yet unpublished manuscript of Holmberg dealing with chamber tomb 1 of the N.E. Cemetery at Berbati. In this tomb lead wires (no. 70) about 5.0 m. in total length were 108</page><page sequence="126">MYCENAEAN CEMETERY from Berbati in favor of dress-weights, which would seem to imply the female court dress as depicted in Mycenaean frescoes. However, they are not found in all female burials, and it there- fore seems more likely that they represent a mortuary practice, used at the undertaker's dis- cretion, in arranging the corpse and supporting the shroud. At any rate, they were evidently confined to a relatively early period and to fairly wealthy interments. Equally uncertain is the purpose of the steatite button-shaped objects found very frequently in Mycenaean tombs. Originally called spindle whorls, they were recognized by Blegen as more probably buttons, since they are too numerous and universal to be connected exclusively with woen's burials. He has liewise demonstrated the development of a new and improved shanked type during the course of Late Helladic III; but no one has attempted to explain the type of costume on which these buttons were used, occurring sometimes singly and sometimes in groups of six or more.89 The cut and sewn sleeved garment depicted in male representations on frescoes does not indicate such buttons, nor do they seem to have a place in the traditional female court costume, where steatite buttons would have been heavy indeed.90 It seems to me that the only likely place for such stone buttons, especially where single, would have been at the shoulder of a heavy woolen cloak.91 Where a set of such "buttons," sometimes assorted in size or type, occurs, perhaps we should best visualize them strung as a necklace of beads. Two small steatite objects (VII-34 and 442), each pierced horizontally and having the form of a figure-eight shield, were almost certainly beads. Both were found in relatively late contexts. SPECIAT1TZIED OFFERINGS Three tombs (X, XX, and XXVI) yielded terracotta figurines of the well-known Mycenaean female types, best referred to by Furumark's designations (Phi, Psi, and Tau).92 All but the first tomb, where the bones were disturbed and the evidence was incomplete, contained the burials of children. The evidence thus confirms Mylonas' theory that female statuettes served as symbolic "nurses" for the journey to the underworld.93 Our statuettes will be studied more fully by Mrs. Elizabeth French in connection with the complete corpus of Agora terracot- tas,94 but one might note here that they conform to Furumark's general classification and confirm hlis dating. X-1 is an early type of Phi-figurine and occurs with a fine stippled teacup of Myc. III A:l1; X XVI-4 and i are of more advanced Phi-type and occur with later Myc. III A pottery; the Psi-type (XX-3) from the small chamber tomb of a child is of late type and should belong to the end of Myc. III B.95 It is possible that the occurrence of sea-shells in Mycenaean tombs likewise points to the burial of a child. A group of shells (XVI-14) was found in the Lily Bowl Grave, where a little girl of found. "Some of these were, without doubt, used in the edges of shirts or cloaks to improve the hang of the material and of the pleats ... but it must also have been used in other ways." He mentions a piece found through the handle of a stemmed goblet and probably used for suspension, and two others "bent in the form of rings and plated with thin gold." 89 Blegen, Prosymtna, I, pp. 256-257, 312-313. Single examples occurred in our Tombs VIII, XI, XIII, XVIII, XXI, XXIV, XXVIII; 2 examples of different types in Tomb XIV and 2 of different sizes and color in Tomb XL; 3 examples of different types (including 1 of terracotta) found near Burial 8 in Tomb VII; 4 examples of 2 different types of steatite buttons as- sociated with the eastern skeleton in Tomb XXIII, as well as an earlier terracotta example from a bone pit; and finally 9 examples of two types in Tomb III, 6 of which were found near the head of skeleton B, a woman. 90 The best discussion of Mycenaean clothing is to be found in Vermeule, Gr.B.A., pp. 178-180, 191ff. and passim under frescoes. 91 Ibid., p. 179 for the evidence for heavy woolen cloaks. 92 Furumark, C.M.P., pp. 86-89. 93 Mylonas, 'Apx.

III C" but there is nothing distinctively III C in the pottery, which is however rather nondescript. 109</page><page sequence="127">MYCENAEAN PERIOD: INTRODUCTION less than two had been buried, and in two other tombs with child burials (5 in XXI and 2 in XXIV) individual shells occurred, although not in a closed context.96 By far the most interesting specialized group of offerings came from the walled pit grave XXIX which yielded a single coarse pitcher (XXIX-2) and a group of implements which it is tempting to associate with the craft of the deceased. The most revealing of these is XXIX-3, which has been recognized as half of a stone mould for making glass beads. Although small and simple, it conforms in type to the casting moulds for making elaborate glass paste ornamerts which have been found at Mycenae and Thebes.97 The other objects found with it are less in- formative: a stone celt (XXIX-4), a bone handle (XXIX-6), and a small bone chisel-shaped tool with drilled holes (XXIX-5). CHRONOLOGICAL RANGE OF MYCENAEAN CEMETERY Although a fuller discussion of Mycenaean chronology and the relation of the cemetery to the remains on the Acropolis will be presented later when we have considered the pottery in more detail, a brief summary may be given here. Significantly, well over half the tombs fall in the Myc. III A period, with a large number in the early stages of that period, and only a few belong exclusively to III B or III C. Myc. II B: VII (1st 5 burials), XVI, and probably XXXI (before 1400 B.C.). Myc. III A:1: I, VII (middle burials), X, XXXVII, and XL plus the earlier burials in III, XIV, XXI, XXIII, XXIV, and XXXII (from ca. 1400 to 1375 B.C.). Myc. III A:2: II, III, IV, XV, XVIII, and XXXIX plus some of the material from XXI, XXIII, and XXIV (second quarter and mid fourteenth century). Myc. III A:2 late: V, XI, XIII, XVII, XIX, XXVI, XXVII, XXVIII, and XXXVI plus the later burials in XIV (second half of the fourteenth century, and probably into the thirteenth century, see below, pp. 151-152). Myc. III B: XX and XXV (thirteenth century). Myc. III B/C: VI, VII (upper burial stratum), and XLI (end of thirteenth and early twelfth century). 2. OTHER MYCENAEAN DEPOSITS In addition to fragmentary Mycenaean vases which turned up in miscellaneous contexts in various parts of the Agora and almost certainly came from destroyed tombs (410-412 from those along the east side of the Kolonos; 413-424 from others beneath the Stoa of Attalos), several concentrations of Mycenaean material need to be considered. While not strictly "closed" in the same sense as the tombs, these deposits were laid down in Mycenaean times and afford a different type of information. We have divided these into: 1) rubbish deposits, 2) wells, and 3) road fill. At the end of this section we shall also briefly mention 4) other Mycenaean de- posits outside the Agora and the North Slope (i.e. those not dug in the Agora Excavations of the American School). 96 Shells were found in the following tombs at the Argive Heraion: Tombs 1, 3, 4, 19, 25, 26, 34, 35, 37, 38 and 44 (Pros- ymna, I, p. 465). No suggestion is given as to their purpose, but Vermeule, Gr.B.A., p. 300, refers to "lead-filled shells" for children to play games with. 97 Mycenae: Schliemann, Mycenae, p. 108, figs. 162-163; Vermeule, Gr.B.A., pl.

Thus, this deposit and the gully which extends southward ally themselves with the small bothrosP 8:9. In both there were legs of tripod cooking pots similar to 441 and to those from houses on the North Slope,98 fragments of pithoi and other large coarse pots, fragments of undecorated domestic kylikes (like 433-438), as well as animal bones and a grinder (in 0 7:14), fragments of roof tiles and a chunk of stone (in P 8:9). The same type of domestic refuse, but without the admixture of earlier and finer material,99 is found in two more homogeneous deposits: the so-called "Kylix Pit" (O 7:4) which yielded fourteen or fifteen fragmentary kylikes as well as other material which must be assigned to an advanced stage of Myc. III B, and the dromos fill of the un- finished chamber tomb XII, which likewise produced a dozen coarse kylikes and other frag- mentary vases of an even later style, probably III C. Clearly some explanation for these deposits of a domestic character in the immediate vicinity of the Mycenaean cemetery is needed, although there is little to suggest that they overlapped in time the use of the area as a cemetery.100 On the other hand, it is surprising to find evidence for habitation so far from a the Acropolis at the very period of intensive fortification, when one would have expected Athenians to have gathered within the Pelasgian defenses of the Acropolis. Still another explanation might regard these fills as rubbish brought from some little distance, perhaps from destroyed or abandoned houses on the slopes of the Acropolis, in connection with levelling operations in the Agora at a period when danger was no longer im- minent. However, the few burials that are contemporary with these deposits (Grave VI, the upper burial stratum of Tomb VII, and the well burial XLI) suggest a period of impoverish- ment, whereas the quantity of fill in the Mycenaean Fountain shows that the Acropolis re- mained the main area of habitation.101 WELLS AND WATER SUPPLY If the Agora area, or even the region to the north of the excavated area, was inhabited in the later Late Helladic III B period (as might be indicated by the rubbish deposits cited above), there is surprisingly little evidence for wells or adjacent water supply. The Agora has yielded only two small wells of the Mycenaean period, neither of which can be considered a major source. H 11:2, in the area of the later Tholos, produced only a handful of sherds and the pitcher 446, which is of advanced Myc. III C style and hardly applicable to the period in question. K6:1, north of the Temple of Ares and thus in the region of the Mycenaean cemetery, is even smaller but produced three Mycenaean pots (443-445) and some earlier sherds. If the well itself served some function in connection with funeral rites, as Mrs. Smithson'02 has suggested to me, its fill points to a date essentially later than the cemetery and closer to that of the other rubbish deposits cited above. 98 Hesperia, II, 1933, pp. 365 ff., fig. 45, a, b. 99 In addition to the catalogued items from 0 7:14 the gully produced about 20 fine painted sherds badly worn including a painted kylix stem, the scrap of a stirrup-vase with III A papyrus blossom, and a small scrap of a kylix (?) with a natural- istically drawn vertical murex. The decorated material in P 8:9 was even scrappier, but included two small sherds of a kylix with vertical murex decoration of III B style. Curiously, these represent the very period that is most lacking in our material (see below, pp. 151-152.) 100 They would thus not contradict the Mycenaean custom of setting the cemetery some little distance away from the settlement, often to the west (see above, note 15). 101 See below, p. 154 and notes 413-414. 102 The sequence of water supplies and the historical conclusions implicit in this sequence have been worked out jointly with Mrs. Evelyn Smithson, who is publishing the Submycenaean and Protogeometric material. 111</page><page sequence="129">MYCENAEAN PERIOD: INTRODUCTION The main sources of water in the Mycenaeaen period seem to have clustered around the northwest Acropolis slopes in the area of the later Klepsydra, and thus follow in the tradition of their Neolithic and Middle Helladic predecessors. Two Mycenaean wells were located during the pre-war excavations of Arthur W. Parsons, and to these must be added Broneer's secret "Fountain" and some evidence for the earliest exploitation of the Klepsydra spring. It is im- portant to arrange these sources in a chronological sequence on the basis of their pottery, in order to form some idea of the location and concentration of settlement in the various periods. Well V 24:, about 6.20 m. deep with a diameter of 1.10-1.40 m., was situated about 35 meters down the slope northwest of the exit of the Mycenaean Fountain. It seems clearly to have been the earliest water supply for the area, with the bulk of pottery good Myc. III B along with an admixture of III A (447-448, 451) and possibly earlier (465) material, and a few pieces transitional to Myc. III C (465-466, 460). With the exception of the large amphora, 464, and the crumpled lead sheathing, 471, which may be connected with the actual use of the well, the material seems to have been dump fill from neighboring houses on the North Slope, houses which were earlier than the squatters' houses built over the northeast staircase.'03 Although the fill of the Fountain, or underground cistern, contained some Myc. III A and earlier material, it was essentially latest III B and III C in style, with those pieces that could be associated with the actual construction and use dating to the very end of Myc. III B or close to 1200 B.C.104 This Fountain must have been the main water supply not only for the ruling family on the Acropolis, but for the entire Mycenaean city gathered within the Pelasgian walls and the Pelargikon during a time of threatened invasion, and in this function it answers closely to the so-called Perseia at Mycenae and the two recently discovered cisterns approached from within the walls at Tiryns.105 Broneer has shown that the staircase with its wooden tie-beams could not have lasted more than about twenty-five years in the damp environment of the rock cleft, but that once the staircase had collapsed the secret Fountain had already served its purpose and became a convenient dump for debris from the Acropolis.106 Our second well, S 27:7, which was situated considerably further west and only a few meters from the Klepsydra, belongs to approximately the same period as that in which the Fountain was serving as a dump. From the large fragments of small vases at the bottom, which seem to constitute a use fill, this well must be assigned to an advanced Myc. III C date (note the Granary style skyphos, 472, and cup, 474), i.e. later than most of the fill from the Fountain. To a still later period, either the very end of Mycenaean or the beginning of Submycenaean, belongs the first exploitation of the springs of the Klepsydra, if we may judge from the strati- fied deposit found beneath the paved court in front of the fountain (T 26-27:2). Although the krater fragment, 479, is advanced Myc. III B and contemporary with much of the material from Broneer's Fountain, the small hydria, 482, is close in style to some of the Perati vases'07 and there are other links with Submycenaean. The near-by well, U 26:4, which has been desig- nated Submycenaean, must be only slightly later.108 The evidence for this sequence of wells and water-supplies has been presented in full, because of the historical implications to which we shall return in our last section (see below, pp. 147ff.). 103 Hesperia, II, 1933, pp. 365ff., figs. 37-45. 104 See below, p. 116 and notes 126-127. 105 G.

There were three main areas in which such deposits were found: 1) at the northwest comer of the Agora on the other side of the Athens-Peiraeus Rail- road (E-F 2); 2) at the west side in the area of the Tholos (G-H 11-12); and 3) in the south central Agora in the area of the Mint and Southeast Fountain House (O-Q 16-17) to which may now be added another deposit somewhat to the north in the South Square (M 14:2).109 In all cases the greatest depth of deposit could be assigned to the Middle Helladic period, with some underlying earlier material (Neolithic or Early Helladic) and some Mycenaean recognizable in the upper strata, at least in the area of the Mint (O-Q 16-17).1ln These deposits imply the existence of roads leading across the Agora: one running along the north side roughly in an east-west direction, another running diagonally from northwest to southeast in the general direction of the Panathenaic Way, and still another in an east-west direction along the south side of the Agora. All antedated the Mycenaean period, but doubtless remained in use during it, and all headed toward the northwest corner of the Acropolis, where, as we have seen, the main sources of water were located. EVIDENCE FOR MYCENAEAN OCCUPATION BEYOND THE AGORA AND THE ACROPOLIS In addition to the slight evidence for the existence of Mycenaean tombs beyond the area of the Agora (see above, p. 47), recent Greek excavations have contributed substantially to our knowledge of Mycenaean occupation, particularly to the south of the Acropolis. Several My- cenaean wells yielded material running from Myc. II through III A: 1, i.e. roughly contemporary with our earlier tombs and closer in style than most of the material from the North Slope, and one produced an imported Late Minoan I B octopus stirrup-vase as well as fragments of imported Ephyraean kylikes.111 These would seem to indicate that the gentler and sunnier slopes to the south of the Acropolis, especially below the Odeion of Herodes Atticus and the Askle- pieion, were preferred for habitation in the period of early Mycenaean settlement.112 But during the subsequent Myc. III A and B periods, and presumably before the threat of invasion which led to the construction of the Pelasgian walls and the underground cistern, habitation may have been more widespread and scattered. This conclusion is suggested by the discovery of two Mycenaean wells on the Hill of the Muses near the monument of Philopappos"3 and by 109 Hesperia, XXXV, 1966, p. 45. 110 The greatest amount of Mycenaean was found in the road cuts in Sections Tau and Psi (O-Q 16-17) where in general it overlay a strong Middle Helladic stratum and was beneath the Classical stratum. Only two Mycenaean pieces (483-484) have been catalogued, but there were numerous kylix stems, a few with painted decoration, fragments from large closed pots and from some smaller closed pots. See below, pp. 262-263. 111 Through the kindness of Dr. Platon, I was able to examine this material in the Acropolis Museum in the summer of 1964. One well yielded the L.M. I B octopus stirrup-vase, numerous fragments of Ephyraean kylikes (nautilus, lily, etc.), fragments of decorated cups of Keftiu shape, several large squat alabastra with crested wave and wheel decoration, Myc. III A:1 fragments of stippled teacups and sherds of three-handled jars with scale pattern. The range is in general earlier than the material from our tombs, and the Myc. II ware appeared to be standard and imported. See now AE-^., XX, 1965, XpoviK5 (1967), cols. 23-33, pls. 25-31. 112 Other Mycenaean material excavated by Miliades below the Odeion of Herodes Atticus and by Dontas on the Angelopoulos property was shown me in the summer of 1964 in the Fetihe-Tzami (Mosque in the Roman Market) through the kindness of Miss Maro Tsoni. In general this is a little later than that from Platon's well near the Asklepieion (above, note 111) and agrees more closely with the range of our tombs. 113 Two Mycenaean wells were excavated in 1963 beneath a building on Chariatidon Street by J. Travlos, through whose kindness I was able to examine the material in the apotheke of the Library of Hadrian. One well was essentially Myc. III A with a few fragments of earlier material; in general it contained poorer pottery than that coming from our better tombs, mostly what we have termed "provincial ware" (see below, p. 118.). The other was somewhat later (transitional Myc. III A-B) and again contained much plain dull glazed ware, no stirrup-vase fragments, no fragments of Panel style skyphoi, nor any. thing that would relate it to the Mycenaean Fountain. In short it looks like a dreary continuation of the provincial style in the thirteenth century.</page><page sequence="131">MYCENAEAN PERIOD: INTRODUCTION some Mycenaean sherds in the area of the Olympieion.114 Until these excavations have been completed and the material is published, it seems unsafe to go beyond the general conclusion that there was some settlement beyond the Acropolis and its immediate slopes. 3. THE MYCENAEAN POTTERY FROM THE AGORA Since pottery is the one common denominator of all our deposits-tombs, rubbish deposits, wells and road stratification-it provides the best evidence for the history of Mycenaean Athens, both for its internal development and for its connection with the Argolid and with other parts of the Mycenaean empire. For this reason we have reserved a detailed study of the pottery until the end.1l5 CHRONOLOGY We have followed throughout the typology and classification of Furumark, and, although we differ in some minor details, we accept the basic divisions of his chronology, which assigns the Myc. III A style essentially to the fourteenth century, III B to the thirteenth and III C to the twelfth century B.C.116 Furumark recognized a Myc. III A:1 style which was transi- tional between Myc. II B (Ephyraean and the later Palace style) and the Myc. III A: 2 koine, which he divided into an earlier and a later phase. Since III A: 1 was contemporary with the latest phase of the palace at Knossos, the destruction of which had been set about 1400 B.C., Furumark assigned the last quarter of the fifteenth century to III A: , and the entire fourteenth century to III A: 2, making the dividing line between his III A: 2 early and III A:2 late at 1375 B.C., i.e. coeval with the beginning of the reign of Akhenaten and the closed context of sherds from Tell el Amarna in Egypt which can be assigned to the second quarter of the century. Myc. III B he equated with the reign of Rameses II (1800-1230 B.c.), through synchronisms found at various Levantine sites to which Myc. III B pottery was exported and through a firm relative chronology from stratified palace sites on the Greek mainland, the great architectural phases of which belong to this period. Myc. III C was the period of the dissolution of t he d oli Mycenaean koine, caused by the upheavals of the Sea Peoples in the reigns of Merneptah (1232-1224 B.C.) and Rameses III (1198-1166 B.C.), and of the destruction of the mainland palaces and the Mycenaean way of life, probably by northern invaders. Furumark separated Myc. III C into two main and distinct divisions, My. III C: 1, from ca. 1230 to 1150 B.C. before the destruction of Mycenae and Myc. III C:2, the period of the Submycenaean cemeteries on Salamis and in the Kerameikos. Although he originally divided III C :1 into an early and late phase, he later refined this into three divisions: C: la, a late continuation of III B, C :1 b, the Close style, and C: c, the Granary and wavy-line style."l7 In the twenty-five years that have elapsed since Furumark's basic work new developments naturally necessitate slight modifications of his divisions and dates. Particularly important are the recent reappraisals of the destruction evidence from the palaces at Knossos and Mycenae. The material from the first site, both the excavators' notebooks and the pottery from the 114 From mixed fill beside the polygonal wall came at least one recognizable Mycenaean sherd, the stem of a kylix with painted bands. This also was seen in the apotheke of the Library of Hadrian in the summer of 1964. 115 It must be remembered that most of our pottery comes from tombs (over 200 items in the Catalogue) whereas only somewhat over 70 items come from non-sepulchral deposits, a ratio of about 3:1. Although this latter material is scrappier and scantier, it can be made more meaningful by reference to the fuller repertory from the North Slope and the Acropolis. 116 Furumark, C.M.P.; M.P. 117 Furumark, Opus. Arch., III, 1944, pp. 194ff. 114</page><page sequence="132">MYCENAEAN POTTERY FROM THE AGORA destruction level, is being restudied"18 in answer to Leonard Palmer's charge that the palace was actually destroyed about 1200 B.C. or some two hundred years later than Sir Arthur Evans' date."9 Although Palmer has been proven wrong in his basic thesis, a careful sifting of the pottery current at the time of the destruction has shown that the Late Minoan II Palace style was already yielding to the simpler L.M. III A style, and that therefore the great confagration must be set some time in the fourteeenth century rather than at the end of the fifteenth. The fact that the destruction pottery does not yet presuppose the mainland Mycenaean development of the Tell el Amama style would suggest that 175 B.C. must be the lower limit. Because of this lowering of the date of the destruction of Knossos we no longer have 1400 as the dividing line between III A:1 and III A:2, and it would therefore seem more sensible to combine the last decade or two of the fifteenth century with the first quarter of the fourteenth century and use the designation III A:l for the entire period that is contemporary with the last phase of the Cretan palace and which is pre-Tell el Amarna in style.120 Myc. III A: 2 would thus cover the last 75 years of the century, with the earlier phase, the second quarter, restricted to the Tell el Amarna material and its exact parallels elsewhere,l21 and with the later phase a more decadent continuation in which some elements of Myc. III B appear toward the end.122 At Mycenae recent excavations both by the British School and by the Greek Archaeological Service have helped to refine and subdivide Furumark's Myc. III B period, and have shown that the city suffered not just one catastrophe in the burning of the Granary during the twelfth century, but was visited by at least three separate destructions.123 The first, which destroyed the houses outside the walls, occurred during the heyday of the III B style, perhaps about the middle of the thirteenth century, and it affords a convenient demarcation of two phases Myc. III B:1 and III B:2 (a division not used by Furumark). The burning of the Potter's Shop at Zygouries may well have been roughly contemporary with this catastrophe.124 Following upon this earlier destruction is a period of more intensive fortification of mainland palaces accom- panied by a slacking off of trade with the Levant. Stylistically this phase is characterized by deep bowls with developed Panel style decoration as evidenced in the earlier strata (I-V) of the Lion Gate deposit.125 118 S.

XpOVIK&amp;, XV-XVI, 1961-1962, I, pp. 162-166. Few scholars seem to have accepted Palmer's basic premise (see this author's review, A.J.P., LXXXIV, 1963, pp. 304-308), and with the further study of the destruction pottery by Popham (see above, note 118) it becomes increasingly unlikely. 120 Our designation Myc. III A:l would thus include transitional II B/III A, III A:1 and whatever of Furumark's III A:2 early is clearly pre-Tell el Amama. 121 One of the fallacies of Furumark's Myc. III A:2 late period was that it did not make full use of the closed Tell el Amarna deposit in sorting out the style of the second quarter of the fourteenth century (see review by J. F. Daniel, A.J.A., XLVII, 1943, pp. 252-253). 122 Elizabeth, Wace French is doing a valuable service in presenting the evidence from closed pottery groups at Mycenae (B.S.A., LVIII, 1963, pp. 44-52; LIX, 1964, pp. 241-261; LX, 1965, pp. 159-202). In the article dealing with Myc. III A:2, some of the material, particularly from the dromos of Tomb 505 and from the terrace on the Atreus Ridge, seems to overlap Myc. III B (at least the stage we would call III B:1). She herself admits that there is some overlap (ibid., pp. 159, 194ff.) and prefers to make the dividing line between III A and III B the advent of the deep bowl (Type 284) rather than the vertical murex. 123 Desborough, C.A.H., II, Ch. XXXVI; L. Mycs., 1964, pp. 73-75; Alin, Fundstatten, pp. 10-25. Mylonas doubts the evidence for three destructions at Mycenae, and thinks that only the last was the result of enemy action (Myc.M.A., pp. 221- 229). 124 Zygouries, pp. 30-38, 143-167 and pls. 16-18. There seems to me some real difficulty in connecting the burning of the Potter's Shop with the destructions at the end of III B as Alin tentatively does (Fundstdtten, pp. 58-59) but perhaps one is misled by the scarcity of decorated pottery and the restricted repertory of shapes in which no panelled bowls occurred. See now Elizabeth French, "A Group of Late Helladic III B 2 Pottery from Mycenae," B.S.A., LXIV, 1969, pp. 71 ff., especially pp. 87ff. 125 B.S.A., XXV, 1921-23, pp. 20-27, pls. V, b, d, e. 115</page><page sequence="133">MYCENAEAN PERIOD: INTRODUCTION The second and most important catastrophe at Mycenae resulted in the burning of the palace on the acropolis, and occurred at a time when the latest III B style was still in vogue and before the advent of the Myc. III C Granary and Close styles. It has been dated around 1200 B.C. and has been shown to be contemporary with a wave of destruction on the mainland which also burnt the palaces at Pylos and Tiryns and caused the abandonment of a number of sites.26 These catastrophes were immediately preceded by last-ditch defensive efforts at several palaces, notably the walled extensions at Mycenae, Tiryns, and perhaps the Pelargikon at Athens, and the construction of elaborate secret water supply systems to withstand siege.127 This wave of destruction clearly marks the end of an era, and it would thus seem perverse in the light of this new evidence to end Myc. III B with the reign of Rameses II in 1230 B.C. and to call this latest pre-destruction pottery Myc. III 0:1 early as Furumark did. Although tendencies toward the new III C style are present, neither the Close style nor the Granary class has appeared. At most it can be designated "transitional B/C" as the end of the four- teenth century can be called "transitional A/B." The third destruction at Mycenae was the one recognized long ago by Wace in the burning of the Granary and the burnt stratum between VIII and IX of the adjacent Lion Gate deposit.128 This occurred in the full bloom of both the Close and the Granary styles, i.e. well into Myc. III C and probably toward the middle of the twelfth century. Not all Mycenaean sites are characterized by this period or this destruction, for some had already been abandoned at the end of Myc. III B, and others were founded only in the Myc. III C period. The uniform devel- opment of a pottery koine throughout the Mycenaean world no longer exists, and we have a break-up into regional styles.'29 A comparative tabulation of the chronology of Furumark and the one proposed here is as follows: FURUMARK IMMERWAHR 1550 B.C.

On the other hand, many vases are decidedly inferior in technique with a dull glaze and less refined biscuit, and these certainly suggest local production. Between these two extremes lies another more amorphous group which approximates but does not quite measure up to the highest Mycenaean standards; furthermore in some cases idiosyncracies of shape or decoration or both suggest the work of a local potter. Here, however, technique alone cannot be the only basis for judgment. The following classification is based on fabric only; in the discussion of shapes and decorative motives there will be some further attempt to appraise the role of local Attic potters. a) STANDARD WARE (fine) The standard Mycenaean fabric has a fine well-purified biscuit varying in color from creamy yellow to pinkish buff, the amount of tempering material determined by the size of the vase and the thickness of the walls. Nearly always wheelmade,130 it shows clear marks of the wheel- rotation on the interior of closed pots, but has the surface well smoothed on the interior of open shapes. The surface is lightly polished, often to a high lustre, the result not of an applied slip but of the "technical slip" resulting from wet-smoothing and polishing.131 Handles, feet, necks, etc. were made separately, and one can often detect on the interior the junction of two parts; such a join was sometimes concealed on the exterior by a plastic band (I-1, 4; III-14; XXIII-1, 2; XXXI-1; etc.). Unusually thick and metallic handles were often pierced with small vent-holes at top and bottom to allow for better firing (I-1; XXIII-2; XXXI-1), and in one case the torus base has been pierced with eleven firing-holes (I-13).132 In some examples (e.g. II-1) the biscuit was too refined, with insufficient tempering material, and this resulted in a laminated wall with an air-space between. The glaze is lustrous and varies from a clear orange-red to mahogany-brown or even black, depending upon firing conditions and thickness. The thick black variety often became crackled and seems in general to have adhered less well than the thinner orange-red or brown. That firing conditions also were responsible for changes in color is shown by the differences occurring on the opposite sides of the same vase (e.g. 1-4), where it had been exposed both to oxidizing and reducing conditions. The surface could be treated in the following manners: 1. Smoothed and polished but otherwise undecorated: VII-14 (interior waterproofed with glaze wash); XV-1; XXIV-16; XXXII-3; XXXIX-1; etc. An especially popular treat- ment for the stemmed kylix. 2. Covered completely with lustrous glaze, usually in reddish brown: 1-4; X-2; XXXII-1 (see below for provincial imitations). 3. Decorated with horizontal bands while vase was revolving on wheel and with free-hand shoulder ornaments in lustrous glaze. The majority of Mycenaean vases in fine ware are so 130 A few shapes were handmade, notably small mugs and baseless askoi which often resemble figurines in their decoration. See below, p. 180 (XX-2 and 450). 131 Although the term slip is still commonly used, I have been assured by Frederick Matson that the surface was the result of wet-smoothing. 132 I know of no other example with so many firing holes, nor in this location; furthermore the fabric is not altogether standard (see below, p. 118.). 117</page><page sequence="135">MYCENAEAN PERIOD: INTRODUCTION treated. Technically fine examples are I-1 to 3, to 6, 14; 111-14; VII-16; XVI-1; XXVI-2; 425; 426. Some early examples have a stippled or "thrush-egg" surface, the glaze having been applied thinly with a brush (X-4; XXIV-1; XL-7 and 9). Three examples (XXVI-1; 425; 426) have applied matt creamy white paint for subsidiary decoration, a practice confined to exceptional examples, often of the pictorial style, and apparently an indication of quality rather than date.133 b) IMITATION SILVER OR TIN-INCRUSTED WARE In this class, which has been the subject of a separate study,134 the surface was only rough- smoothed and originally covered with a sheathing of tinfoil so as to produce the illusion of a silver vase: I-l1 and 12; III-1, 4 to 13,16; possibly others (VII-15 ?) where no trace of the tinfoil remains. This technique, which seems to have been relatively rare and restricted in time,135 was apparently limited to funeral usage among the well-to-do. It occurs also in the Argolid, Crete, and Rhodes in the early fourteenth century; the twelve examples from our Tomb of the Bronzes (Tomb III) show that Athens was indeed in the mainstream of metropolitan practices. c) PROVINCIAL WARE (imitating STANDARD) Here the fabric is apt to be coarser with more- grit and tempering material, even in relatively small vases (e.g. 412, XL-3, 9, 10, 11, 12), and the biscuit is often orange to brick red, resembling the characteristic Attic clay of later periods (1-7). Especially numerous and certainly provincial is a group of vases, usually in a pinkish orange clay, covered with a dull thin glaze ranging from brown to orange-red and occasionally black, obviously imitative of Class a 2. Especially common are deep-bowled kylikes of Ephyraean shape (Type 263136: 1-15; XXII-1; XXIII-4; XXIV-12 to 14; etc.), pitchers with beaked spout (Type 144: XXIV-8 to 10), cut-away neck (Type 136: VII-18) or straight mouth (Type 112: X-6), shallow bowls and cups of various forms (V-6; X-3; XIII-2; etc.), askoi and feeding bottles (V-5; XIV-6; XVIII-8; XXIV-21), amphoras and wide-mouthed jugs (VII-20; XIV-5; XV-2; etc.). Harder to detect are provincial examples imitating Classes a 1 and 3. In examples of a fine buff ware it is possible that a rough-smoothed surface (VII-13; XVIII-4 and 5) or warping (XXXII-3 and X 7 and 7 a 2) suggests less than the high standards of the Argoid, and therefore local production has been proposed.37 With the decorated vases the occurrence of abnormalities and carelessness in the application of traditional decorative schemes aids one's assessment (VII-2, 3, 8, 9, 919; XVI-3 to ; XXI-3 to 5 and 9). In other cases the clay is noticeably pinker and the glaze less permanent (1-13; VII-17) or the fabric grittier. However, some examples of excellent technique, indistinguishable from the finest products of Argolid workmanship, have been suspected of local manufacture merely because their shapes are especially common in Attica.138 133 The use of applied white, which goes back at least as early as Myc. I (the applied dots on tangent spiral bands), ap- pears in the pictorial style from the early Myc. III A Octopus Krater from Enkomi to the Myc. III C Warrior Vase from Mycenae. This argues against Broneer's theory of lateness for this technique (Fontain p. 872, note 59) but in general see his excellent description of fabrics based on the Fountain material (ibid., pp. 348-349 and passim). 1'4 Hesperia, XXXV, 1966, pp. 381-396. 135 Ibid., pp. 394-395 for list of known examples. While it is indeed probable that many more examples have gone un- noticed or have been lost through cleaning in hydrochloric acid (see p. 396), it is noteworthy that the known examples are confined to a relatively narrow period in the early fourteenth century (ibid., pp. 388-392). 136 All references to shape derive from Furumark's "Catalogue of Vessel Types" in M.P., pp. 583-643, the number preceded by "Type." 137 See Vermeule, Hesperia, XXXV, 1966, pp. 67, 77 (no. 12). 138 Ibid., pp. 75-76 (no. 6). See below, pp. 133-134 for discussion of ewers. 118</page><page sequence="136">MYCENAEAN POTTERY FROM THE AGORA d) COARSE AND DOMESTIC WARE Since most of our pottery comes from tombs, this is not a numerous class, and is represented in the cemetery mainly by wide-mouthed amphoras and jugs (V-7 and 8; XX-1; XXXVI-3). The rubbish deposits J 10:1 and 0 7:4 and the wells V 24:1 and S 27:7 furnish additional examples, mostly of a somewhat later chronological range. In these examples the clay is in general a warm buff, tempered with grit, usually unslipped and undecorated. In those shapes also characteristic of fine ware the pot is treated with greater carelessness, only roughly turned and without removing the rotating ridges and grooves, and is sometimes badly warped and misshapen (note especially the kylikes 433-438, 444, 473). Here parallels to the domestic pot- tery of other Mycenaean provincial sites, particularly Pylos,139 may be noted, for in general the surface treatment at'the Argolid sites is better.l40 The big pots (XII-8 and 464) are usually better technically, probably in the interest of serviceability. A special fabric, sandy and micaceous with an almost stone-like feel, was used for tripod cooking pots (represented by 441 and by uncatalogued fragments from P 8:9 and 0 7:14). It is carefully handmade, has a dark gray core, and is somewhat blackened on the exterior from use over an open fire. e) NON-MYCENAEAN WARE The Canaanite jar (1-8) from the Tomb of the Ivory Pyxides is the only import from outside the Mycenaean world. Here not only the shape, which is paralleled in Egyptian tomb paintings of the XVlllth dynasty and in examples from Canaan and the Near East,141 but the coarse gray fabric with numerous small pebbles testifies to its foreign origin. Curiously, nothing can be ascribed to Crete, although a fine L.M. I B octopus stirrup-vase was recently found in a well on the South Slope, and a Minoan basket-shaped vase with dolphins from Varkisa on the coast has been published.42 Two vases found in Mycenaean contexts are not strictly speaking Mycenaean, but have closer ties with Middle Helladic: the handmade black-burnished askos (XVI-9) and the burnished jar (466) from Well V 24:1. SHAPES If we classify the Agora material on the ibasis of Furumark's catalogue of 336 types, or shape variations,l43 we may note that it contains the surprisingly high total of approximately one hundred types, a substantial repertory when one remembers that the domestic series is very incomplete and the chronological range somewhat restricted.44 Two more or less unique shapes (XVI-1 and XXVI-2) are not found in Furumark. The ensuing arrangement is an adaptation of Blegen's classification according to function:45 a) vas ses for storing; b) vases for eating and drinking; c) vases for pouring; and d) specialized shapes. 139 See especially the kylikes from Pylos, Pylos, I, 1, pp. 366ff., Shapes 27 ,29; 2, figs. 359-364. Pylos, however, has certain variations not found in our kylix types. 140 Zygouries, p. 151, figs. 141-142. 141 V.

His 336 types are arranged under 103 basic shapes or "forms," such as the pithoid jar (Form 7) or the stemmed cup or kylix (Form 79). 144 For the distinction between pottery found in tombs and pottery from domestic deposits, see E. W. French, B.S.A., LVIII, 1963, pp. 44ff. 145 Troy, I, pp. 56-76, which is also the basis for the arrangement of the Pylos pottery. Since our material is largely from tombs with a greater incidence of closed shapes, we have begun with Troy, group c), vases for storing. 119</page><page sequence="137">MYCENAEAN PERIOD: INTRODUCTION a) VASES FOR STORING 1. The Pithoid Jar (Form 7) (called Three-handled Jar in Catalogue) P1. 65 Types 18-19: large (above 30 cm. in ht.)146 with three vertical handles, usually ribbed. Myc. IIB to III A:1. I-1, 2, and 13; III-2 and 15 (5 examples). Type 23: medium (ca. 20-25 cm. in ht.) with three vertical handles, sometimes ribbed. Myc. III A:1-2. I-3; VII-11 and12; VIII-3; XIV-1 and4; XVII-1; XXIV-3 toS; 419; 420; 491 (13examples). Types 23 and 24: small (ca. 10-15 cm. in ht.) with three vertical handles, plain. Myc. III A: 1-2. I-9 and 10; III-3; VII-10 and 13; 486 (6 examples). Types 20-21: large with three horizontal grooved handles. Myc. II A-B. I-7 (1 example). Type 28: small (ca. 10-15 cm. in ht.) with three horizontal handles. Myc. II B-III A 1. XVI-3 and 4; XXI-1; XXIV-6 (4 examples). Types 44-45: small (ca. 10-15 cm. in ht.) piriform shape with three horizontal handles. Myc. III A:2-B. V-4; XIII-3; XIV-2; XVIII-1; XXIII-3; XXIV-7; XXXV-3; XXXVI-1;421; XXXVII-1; XL-10; 457; 485; 492 (14 examples). Next to the kylix the pithoid jar is the most prevalent shape in the Agora, accounting for 43 examples. Significantly, the type with three vertical handles outnumbers the alternative form with horizontal handles 24 to 19, and is an indication of the early date or derivation of our material, since this shape was especially characteristic of the Palace style and the Myc. III A: 1 period. The perfection of this form with low concave neck separated by a plastic band from the shoulder, broad piriform body, and profiled handles terminating in a plastic knob is best seen in the two splendid specimens from Tomb I (1 and 2), which rank with the finest examples from the Argolid and Rhodes and should certainly be regarded as imports.147 III-15 is the only other example which comes close in size and quality, although some of the medium range (Type 23: VII-12; XIV-4; XXIV-3, etc.) are close approximations of the type seen in 1-2. 1-3 re- presents a slightly different form with lower neck, taller and more concave body, less metallic handles and narrower decorative zone (Type 23); it too is closely paralleled in the Argolid148 and occurs in other less perfect examples from the Agora (VII-11; XIV-1; XXIV-4 and 5). 1-13, a large specimen found in fragments in the dromos of Tomb I, has a torus base pierced by 11 vent-holes, an uncanonical feature which along with its pinkish fabric is suggestive of local manufacture. The large jar III-2 is undecorated, a practice also found in the Argolid.149 146 The heights of our examples are all somewhat less than the average heights given by Furumark: e.g., the large spec- imens of Types 18-19 (50-60 cm.), medium of Type 23 (30-50 cm.), etc. 147 See below, pp. 146, 162 for discussion of nautilus jar (I-1). For 1-2 there are many close parallels in the Argolid, particularly two examples from Tomb 10 at Dendra (N. T.D., pp. 67ff., figs. 79, 83). 148 Dendra, Tomb 10, nos. 7 and 8 (N.T.D., fig. 81, 1-2). 149 Prosymna, II, figs. 260, 1053; 438, 174; 536, 1038. 120</page><page sequence="138">MYCENAEAN POTTERY FROM THE AGORA The alternative form with three horizontally set loop handles also goes back to a Palace style prototype but was especially popular in the Myc. III A:2 Amara koine. Of the early Types 20-21 we have only the large jar with ogival canopy decoration from Tomb I (7); its coarse fabric and careless ornamentation suggest local manufacture.l50 Three small jars of early shape (XVI- 3 and 4; XXI-1) belong to Myc. II-III A:l, the first two showing some affinity to the two- handled form seen in Shaft Grave I at Mycenae.151 Of the later form (Types 44-45) which was marked by small vases of advanced piriform shape with a narrow shoulder zone decorated with simple linear patterns, we have 14 examples, a few of which are probably still III A: 1 (X XIV-7; XL-10). The fragment 457, if it comes from a piriform jar, is best ascribed to an advanced Myc. III B date because of its decoration.152 2. The Krater with Strap Handles (Form 3) Types 6-7: conical to conical piriform. Myc. III A:1-2. 1-14; XL-3 and 11; 411; 412; 425 (6 examples). Type 10: advanced piriform or stemmed. Myc. III B/C. VII-25 (1 example). This shape, often the vehicle for pictorial decoration, enjoyed a wide vogue in the earlier Mycenaean period and was especially popular in Attica.l53 In the Agora it occurs with pictorial decoration in the fragmentary Altar Krater (425), which ranks among the finest Mycenaean vases and was probably imported from some Argolid center (see below, pp. 248 ff.).Equally fine technically is the fragmentary krater from the dromos of Tomb I (14). The shape to which these should be restored-a graceful piriform to conical form with wide mouth and offset lip, two broad band handles without metallic features-can be seen better in the newly discovered complete example from the Tomb with the Coffins (XL-3), which although "extraordinarily impressive," betrays certain technical defects and is therefore probably of local manufacture.154 XL-11 is far less perfect in shape and is technically poorer. All these vases should be dated to Myc. III A:1 or earliest III A: 2. Nos. 411 and 412, miscellaneous finds from the west side of the Agora, probably came from destroyed tombs along the Kolonos. No. 412 must have been a handsome krater, local in manufacture, of about the same period and style as XL-3; 411 is perhaps slightly later. Such kraters, as the evidence from Tomb XL has shown, were important in funerary ritual.155 A later example, also fragmentary, was found in the top burial stratum of the Ares Tomb (VII-25). It has parallels among the material from the fill of the Mycenaean Fountain and should be dated to the end of Myc. III B or early III C.156 150 There is almost no color contrast between the biscuit and the glaze; the wave on the neck is carelessly drawn and the ogival canopy much simpler than in the best examples from the Argolid (e.g. Dendra, Tomb 8, no. 2, N.T.D., p. 43, fig. 46). 151 If the double-axe pattern should be restored on XVI-4 (as suggested by the Piet de Jong drawing made soon after its discovery, see below, p. 206), this would strengthen the parallel (see Karo, S.G., pl. CLXVII). 152 More likely of the amphoriskos shape (Types 59 and 64); see discussion in Catalogue. 153 Markopoulo: 'Ey 'Apx., 1895, pl. 10, 9, 9a; Vourvatsi: Attica, pl. 10, 1; other fragmentary examples cited by Stubbings, Attica, p. 39. 154 Hesperia, XXXV, 1966, p. 74. One might note that it (as well as XL-11) lacks the characteristic loops beneath the handles, which are found on the Altar Krater (425), the fragmentary krater from the dromos of Tomb I (I-14), and the early pictorial style vases from the Levant such as the Window Krater from Kourion (Vermeule, Gr.B.A., pl. XXXIII A), and seem to represent a kind of hallmark of excellence. Note Mrs. French's observation of this feature on the fragmentary kraters from the Atreus bothros at Mycenae (B.S.A., LIX, 1964, p. 248). 155 Note its position on top of the coffin of Burial D (Hesperia, XXXV, 1966, p. 58, fig. 2, pp. 63-64). For the probable connection of pictorial-style kraters with funerary rites in Cyprus, see Vermeule, Gr.B.A., pp. 204-206. 156 Similar late examples of the strap-handled krater were found by Broneer in the fill of the Fountain (Fountain, pp. 361- 362, fig. 39). 121</page><page sequence="139">MYCENAEAN PERIOD: INTRODUCTION 3. Krater with Loop Handles (Form 80) Types 281-282: deep rounded bowl with diameter equal or greater than height. Myc. III B-C. 440, 451, 452, 479, 498 (5 examples). This form is more characteristic of domestic than sepulchral deposits, and is restricted to Myc. III B and C.157 Both facts explain its rarity among the Agora material in contrast to that from the North Slope and the Fountain. Indeed all five examples are very fragmentary, four coming from wells or rubbish deposits and one from a miscellaneous context. No. 479, a good example of the developed Myc. III B :2 Panel style, finds close parallels both at Mycenae and among the Fountain material;158 440 has a late version of the murex pattern seen in the Pot- ter's Shop at Zygouries.159 Both could be imported pieces, although the fabric of 440 seems inferior. Nos. 451 and 452 are less canonical, the latter certainly late III B, whereas 498 with a Myc. III B flower is perhaps earlier.l60 4. Squat Jars of Alabastron Shape or with Angular Profile (pyxis) (Forms 16, 17, 19) P1. 65 Types 82 and 84: large flat shape with three handles. Myc. II B-III A:1. I-5 and 6; VII-3 and 5; VIII-1; 413; 489 (7 examples). Type 88: small flat type with three handles. Myc. II-III A:1. VII-2, 4, 6-8; VIII-2; IX-1; XV-3; XVI-6; XXI-2 and 3 (11 examples) Type 85: higher rounded type. Myc. III A:2-B. VII-9; XI-1 and 3; XVI-5; XVIII-3; XXV-4; XXXV-2 (7 examples). Type 87: squat jug with one handle. Myc. II B-III A:1. VII-1 (1 example). Types 93-94: angular-profiled squat jar or pyxis. Myc. III A:1-B. XXI-4 and 9; XXIV-20; XXVIII-1; XL-2; 414; 459 (7 examples). Type 98: straight-sided with two handles. Myc. III C:1. 500 and 501(?) (2 examples). Grouping together the curved alabastra, the straight-sided pyxides, and a solitary squat one- handled jug, we have 35 examples of this type of small container suitable for offerings of perfumed oil or unguents in tombs. Numerically it is exceeded only by the pithoid jar and kylix shapes. Our earliest examples of the large flat type (Types 82, 84) are two fragmentary vases from beneath the Stoa of Attalos (413 and uncatalogued); on these the dot-outlined crested wave and wheel pattern on the base are clearly Myc. II B (see below, p. 237). The largest and best preserved examples are, however, the two alabastra from the East Bench of Tomb I (5 and 6), which are Myc. III A:1. They are closely paralleled in the Argolid,161 and are reminiscent of the alabaster examples from the Throne Room at Knossos.l62 157 French, B.S.A., LVIII, 1963, pp. 44-52; B.S.A., LX, 1965, p. 159. 158 B.S.A., XXV, 1921-1923, pl.

VI). 162 Evans, P.M., IV, 2, p. 939, fig. 910. 122</page><page sequence="140">MYCENAEAN POTTERY FROM THE AGORA In the small flat type (Type 83) where the diameter ranges from ca. 0.07 to 0.095 m. (com- pared to 0.15 to 0.20 m.) the shape is apt to look less flat and depressed. Especially interesting are the five examples from the Ares Tomb which range from Myc. II B to III A:1 and include typical imported specimens (VII-4, 6 and 7) and careless local imitations (VII-2 and 8).163 Although XVI-6 is too badly preserved (undecorated?) to be closely dated, its context in the Lily Bowl Grave indicates an early date. XXI-2 and 3 seem a little later than the examples from the Ares Tomb, as does XV-3.164 The higher rounded type (Type 85) is essentially the later Myc. III A: 2 form, with a height greater than half the diameter and the greatest volume set higher (cf. the rather prosaic examples with wave pattern XI-1 and 3; XXXV-2). On the other hand, the examples XVI-5 and VII-9 are clearly earlier and should be assigned to Myc. II B and III A:1 respectively; they are quite uncanonical and certainly local. XXV-4, gray and brittle throughout with traces of glaze on the upper body, seems to be an example of misfiring. The alternative pos- sibility of subsequent burning and vitrification seems less likely. The straight-sided alabastron or pyxis (Types 93-94) was the more prevalent later type, particularly in the export trade to the Levant from the Amarna period on. XXVIII-1 and 414, with bands on the lower body and a simple geometric ornament on the angular shoulder, are typical of this phase, whereas XL-2 with its wavy line and degenerate ivy leaf pattern must be somewhat earlier.l6 The angular type has Myc. II B antecedents, which usually have two decorative zones, and this treatment seems imitated in the rather careless examples from Tomb XXI (4 and 9). Like the uncanonical curved alabastra from the Ares Tomb, they should be regarded as local products of the Myc. III A:1 period. No. 459 from Well V 24:1 is of the later Myc. III B form with convex bottom, and has parallels in the pottery from the Mycenaean Fountain.l66 The fragments 500 and 501(?) seem to belong to the still later III : 1 development of the angular shape into the larger pyxis with two handles arching above the shoulder and often applied plastically to the side-wall. This type, 98, had a vogue in Athens at the time of the construction and fill of the Fountain.167 VII-1 is our only example of the squat jug type (Type 87), which has an early ancestry and may have influenced the development of the true alabastron shape. It was found with one of the earliest burials in the Ares Tomb, and, although badly worn, has canonical decoration of curve-stemmed ivy leaves which relates it to the example from the Maket Tomb in Egypt'68 and others of Myc. II date from the Peloponnesos169 and Thessaly.170 5. False-necked Jar or Stirrup-Jar (Form 46) Type 171: globular with height equal to diameter. Myc. III A: 2. II-1; V-3; XXVI-3; 448; 487 (5 examples). 163 See Ares Tomb, pp. 202-204, although Mrs. Vermeule does not consider that those of greenish clay and with close parallels in the Argolid were valuable enough to have been imported. 164 XXI-2 is in the tradition of the alabastra decorated with wave and ivy leaf, although here parallel rows of dots have been substituted for the leaf; XXI-8 with its tangential spiral band and open wave is earlier and less canonical; XV-8 with wave and dot rosettes is apparently standard Myc. III A :1-2 work. 185 Hesperia, XXXV, 1966, p. 78. Although XL-2 is associated with Burial A (the third in sequence), all four burials took place within a span of 25 or 30 years within the Myc.

Myc. III B. XXV-1 (1 example). Type 176: Eastern type with height greater than diameter. Myc. III C:1. 603 (1 example). Uncertain type: 466. One of the surprising features of the Agora material is the infrequency of the stirrup-vase, a shape which seems well-nigh ubiquitous to Mycenaean collections, indeed the most charac- teristic Mycenaean shape. We have only three complete (II-1; V-3; X XV-1) and one fragmentary example (XXVI-3) from our tombs, the other four fragments coming from Well V 24:1 or from miscellaneous deposits. II-1, V-3, XXVI-3, and probably the fragments 448 and 487, are typical examples of the small globular form with banded decoration and simple geometric arcs or chevrons on the shoulder which characterizes Myc. III A:2, whereas XXV-1 is an example of the later III B squat or "perked-up" type (Type 180), one of the few specifically III B forms from the Agora tombs. It is paralleled not only in the Argolid, but also in the Mycenaean pottery from chamber tombs in Attica.171 No. 603, a most interesting fragment, apparently comes from a large stirrup-vase of Late Eastern type (Type 176) decorated with an octopus. Although paralleled by numerous examples in Rhodes and the Dodecanese,172 and more recently from the late tombs at Perati in east Attica, this type has not previously been noted in Athens, with the exception of the example from the Dipylon.173 The fact that the Agora tombs have produced so few stirrup-vases may be explained largely by their chronological horizon. Many of our tombs fall in the Myc. II to III A:1 period, the heyday of the squat alabastron shape, before the great rise in popularity of the stirrup-vase in the Myc. III A: 2 commercial expansion. While the two shapes are not altogether mutually exclusive, the stirrup-vase and the straight-sided alabastron or pyxis tend to supersede the round alabastron as small closed containers for perfumed oil or unguents in tombs.'74 Although some of our tombs must certainly be assigned to this later period, preferences and styles seem to reflect the earlier period of contact with the Argolid (see below, pp. 151-152). 6. Globular Flask (Forms 48 and 49) Type 188: vertical type decoration. Myc. III A :2. III-14 (1 example). Type 190: horizontal type decoration. Myc. III A:2. 416 (1 example). We have a single example each of these two related types, which were extremely popular in the export trade to the Levant from the Amarna period on and gave rise to Levantine imita- tions.175 III-14 is a particularly fine example of the "vertical type" or characteristic pilgrim- 171 Prosymna, II, figs. 115, 280; 141, 145; 354, 782; 507, 83; Zygouries, p. 168, fig. 161, 356; p. 172, fig. 167, 331; Attica, pi.

Other specimens have been found in Attica.177 The bottle 416, with horizontal bands and somewhat careless lattice pattern on the shoulder, seems somewhat later but still III A. 7. Hydria (Form 33) Type 129: small (10-20 cm. high), globular, wide-mouthed. Myc. III A: 2-B. XXVI-1; XXXVI-2 (2 examples). Type 128: tall (ca. 40 cm. high), domestic. Myc. III B-C:1. XII-8; 460; 476 (3 examples). Type 130: globular narrow-necked, medium (ca. 20 cm. high). Myc. III B. 482 (Myc. III C miniature). Of the two examples from tombs,178 XXVI-1 is a finely decorated specimen (see below, p. 138) and is furthermore distinguished by a pierced hole about 6 mm. in diameter through the resting surface and thereby communicating with the interior; this hole is located in the exact center of the front directly beneath the largest octopus (P1. 75). It is clearly a ritual vase, belonging to a class first noted by Stubbings in examples from Attica, Rhodes, and the Argolid.179 A similar vase from a tomb in Nauplia180 suggests that ours was imported from the Argolid. XXXVI-2 is coarser in both shape and fabric, has no pierced aperture, and is covered with a dull glaze wash. It is presumably a local product, and from its context ought not to be later than the end of III A. The other small decorated hydria 482, found intact beneath the court of the Klepsydra, is of a quite different type, with tall narrow neck and rolled rim. Although not easily paralleled among hydriai, it is best explained as a variant of a late jug type to which shoulder handles have been added. The same decorative scheme-tassel pattern on shoulder and wavy line in handle zone- occurs on late III C: 1 jugs from Perati18l and Asine.182 Indeed the vase might almost be termed Submycenaean. The other examples, all fragmentary, come from large coarse domestic hydriai, which have parallels with the pottery from the fill of the Mycenaean Fountain.l3 They should thus be dated to the end of Myc. III B or even III C. Nos. 460 and 476 may have been used to draw water from their respective wells (V 24:1 and S 27:7), although they are too incomplete to be con- sidered actual use-fill. 176 C.V.A.

II B-III A:2. XVIII-7; XX-1; XL-1 (3 examples). All examples come from tombs with the exception of XII-7 and 430, which are fragmentary large domestic amphoras from rubbish deposits containing late Myc. III B material. The sepulchral examples are about half the size (ranging from ca. 12 to 20 cm. in height) and are either covered with a thin glaze wash or are left unglazed (V-7 and 8; XX-1; XXXVI-3). Both types-with handles from the rim (Types 66 and 68) and with handles set vertically on the shoulders (Type 74)-were in use concurrently as proved by the evidence from Tomb XL.184 They certainly go back to the earliest Myc. III A period, and indeed one should probably seek a Middle Helladic ancestry in Mattpainted ware.185 There was apparently little develop- ment in type, although the examples with a narrower and more clearly defined neck (Type 68) seem slightly later. Such amphoras can be matched in Mycenaean tombs in the Argolid,86 but there they seem proportionately less characteristic. Furthermore, our examples in a coarse pinkish fabric with dull glaze belong to the "provincial ware" of Class c we have noted above (p. 118) and were clearly local products, perhaps reflecting the strength of Middle Helladic tradition in Athens. Not found in our wealthiest tombs (I and III), the amphora shape may have substituted for the more elegant and imported pithoid jars as the largest container for wine and water in poorer burials. b) VASES FOR EATING AND DRINKING 1.

The kylix, with over 50 examples and many other uncatalogued fragments, was the most prevalent shape in the Agora, because it occurred in both cemetery and domestic deposits and runs through all chronological phases. From the multiplicity of types listed above, several general conclusions may be noted. First of all, the almost complete absence of decorated examples (only four: VII-16; XVI-2; 424 and 426) is unusual and in contrast to most parts of the Mycenaean world. Our two excellent examples, the deep-bowled kylix with octopus (426) and the kylix with spiral band from the Ares Tomb (VII-16), are best explained as imports either from the Argolid or from Rhodes.l87 XVI-2, a deep-bowled kylix with high-swung handle from the Lily Bowl Grave, is clearly early and a variant of the Myc. II Ephyraean type; it too is probably an import, although the decoration is poorly preserved.188 Of the developed Myc. III A: 2-B decorated kylix types so numerous in both tomb and habitation deposits in the Argolidl89 as well as in chamber tombs in Attica90o we have only the small sherd 424 decorated with a vertical murex of Myc. III A :2/B type.191 The possible significance of this absence will be discussed below (p. 152). All other examples of the kylix shape are either smoothed, glazed, tin-incrusted, or left quite rough in the late domestic examples of Types 267 and 274. For many, and particularly the earlier examples, there is a strong metallic tendency seen in the offset lip and flat ribbon handles.'92 This metallic effect was reinforced by a monochrome glaze (XXXII-1) or a lightly polished surface (VII-14), and in a special class (see above, p. 118) imitated silverby the ap- plication of tinfoil. The variety of metallic shapes prevalent in the earlier fourteenth century is well illustrated by the six kylikes of this class from the Tomb of the Bronzes (Type 264: III-8; Type 267: 111-6,9, 10; Types 271-272: III-7, with one handle, and III5, two-handled). 187 Ares Tomb, pp. 203, 210-211 (with Aegean rather than Argolid parallels for VII-16). I am not certain that Mrs. Vermeule is correct in thinking this piece an import from Rhodes (?). Note Mrs. French's remarks on the fortuitous absence of the Myc. III A:2 early kylix type from Mycenae (B.S.A., LX, 1965, p. 160). The Rhodian origin of 426 would seem more likely in view of the popularity of the kylix decorated with octopus there (B.M. Cat., I, 1, A 870, pl. XIV, etc.) yet even here the Rhodian type seems derivative rather than identical (see below, p. 250). 188 Cf. 3 examples of this shape from the Prehistoric Cemetery at Mycenae (B.S.A., XLV, 1950, pl. 21 a, 2, 5, 7) dated to L.H. I; also cup from Koronion near Pylos decorated with double axes (HpoKTclK&amp;, 1952 [1955], p. 480, fig. 6). 189 B.S.A., LX, 1965, pp. 164ff., figs. 2, 3, 5. 190 Attica, pl. 4, 7-12, 14-15, pl. 5, 1. 191 Cf. also the few additional uncatalogued scraps from O 7:14 and P 8:9 noted above, note 99. 192 Attica, pp. 62-63. 127</page><page sequence="145">MYCENAEAN PERIOD: INTRODUCTION This practice of tin-incrustation is found elsewhere, and in Tomb 10 at Dendra the same shapes were duplicated in silver.193 There are few other examples from Athens equally elegant in shape, although the goblet with one high-swung handle from the Ares Tomb (VII-15) is a somewhat earlier version of III-7, and the two-handled type XXXIX-1 is perhaps also a little earlier than III-. These are in a fine buff ware without any trace of tinfoil. Likewise the stemmed type with two low handles (111-8) occurs without tinfoil in several buff monochrome examples (XV-1; XXIV-15; XXXII-3; XL-12), two of which are badly warped and may have been made locally.94 The short-stemmed type with one handle and lightly carinated bowl (III-6, 9, 10) was more widely used and occurs both in glazed examples (428 and 431) as well as in an early plain smoothed specimen (XL-13); furthermore, it became one of the characteristic later forms of the domestic repertory. If one may consider the decorated kylikes and the "imitation silver" examples as de luxe pieces,195 the characteristic kylix for more ordinary burials is the deep-bowled short-stemmed type (Type 263) covered with a dull monochrome glaze. Here the derivation of the shape from the Myc. I-II kylix of Ephyraean form is unmistakable, and the inferior "provincial" fabric and chronological range suggest the perpetuation of the type into the Myc. III A:1-2 period when the Argolid favored the taller stemmed types and decorated examples.196 Our domestic examples are all later, coming from wells and rubbish deposits of the transitional Myc. III B/C period. They are uniformly poor in quality, unglazed and undecorated, only very rudimentarily smoothed and often with broad wheel-marks. Frequently they are badly warped and misshapen (434 and 435). Two main shapes occur: a late continuation of the carinated one-handled type (Type 267) and a new conical-bowled form (Type 274) which, while perhaps owing something to earlier deep-bowled Ephyraean forms, marks the advent of Myc. III B:2 and is particularly characteristic of domestic deposits at the end of that period.197 Both forms occur in the Mycenaean Fountain, but neither is specifically Attic, although our examples were certainly locally produced.198 Broneer has suggested that the low-stemmed carinated type may have served alternately as a lamp,199 and several of our examples (437 and 438) show traces of black accretion within the bowl. XLI-I (an example of Type 274) is the only instance of a late domestic type associated with a grave in the Agora, and it came from the uncanonical burial in the mouth of a well (N 14:3). 2.

III B, which she sets somewhat later than most scholars (see above, note 122). 198 The numerous examples from the Kylix Pit 0 7:4 are about as poor specimens as one can make; and 436 shows the interesting aberration of two handles on a one-handled type (Type 267).

We have grouped together here some 21 cups without stems, which represent ten or more different types and reveal less uniformity than in the kylix types. Of the teacups, the first three (Type 219) are typical examples of Myc. II-III A:1 cups with stippled decoration.200 The shape continued into the Myc. III B period, where it is found in a simple banded example (XXV-3) and a late domestic undecorated version from the Kylix Pit (439). An alternative form with raised handle, perhaps influenced by the early shallow cup with ring handle (Type 237), occurs in several examples (XVIII-2; XXIII-6 and XXXII-2), the last two covered with the monochrome red wash of our "provincial" group.201 The deeper semiglobular cup is more characteristic of the later period, especially Myc. III C. However, V-6, a deep cup on a conical foot in Red Monochrome ware, cannot from its context be later than the end of Myc. III A or transitional III B. It is best regarded as a kind of Attic "sport," derived from the deep teacup with low conical foot of Myc. I-II times (Types 211- 212). The other examples (VI-1; VII-23; 474) are typical of the later development. They run chronologically from the transitional III B/C example from the Ares Tomb (VII-23), undecorated and somewhat ogival in profile,20 through the developed III C:1 cup from the Children's Grave (VI-1), a cup which has good parallels in the Argolid,203 to the late example, 474, which comes from well S 27:7 and should be dated to the end of Myc. III C: 1.204 In the spouted cups (Types 253 and 249) the early form was shallow like the teacup and had a raised handle and a spout at 90 degrees from the handle. The fragment 410 is typical; dec- orated with the canonical solid wave pattern pendant from the rim, it has close parallels from the Argolid and Rhodes and is probably an imported piece.205 The monochrome example 200 Hesperia, XXXV, 1966, p. 76, nos. 7, 9, the latter more carelessly made. 201 XVIII-2 may have been incorrectly restored with a high-swung handle; see discussion in Catalogue. 202 Indeed it differs very little from the teacup 439 except in its somewhat greater height and higher base-ring. This ought to establish the contemporaneity of the late burials in the Ares Tomb with the adjacent rubbish deposits (J 10:1 and 0 7:4). 203 Korakou, p. 65, fig. 92; B.S.A., XXV, 1921-1923, pl.

The later form, with a deeper bowl and a low handle opposite the spout (Type 249), occurs in the handmade miniature XIII-2 from the diminutive chamber tomb of a child. Both the conical (Type 230) and cylindrical cup or tankard (Type 226) are related to the famous Keftiu or Vaphio shape with metallic prototypes. XXIV-2 is our only example of the first type with markedly concave walls and carinated offset foot. In a yellow monochrome ware, possibly handmade, it seems to owe something both to Yellow Minyan and to Fine Mattpainted, although it is clearly of Myc. III A date.206 The two tankards (XXV-2 and 429) are both relatively late in the Agora sequence, probably Myc. III B. XXV-2 is more akin to the earlier shape with a diameter greater than its height (Type 225); however, it lacks any reminiscence of the metallic midrib and is decorated with a grotesquely large row of retrograde N's. No. 429 is a large specimen of the later shape with a height equal to or exceeding the diameter; it, how- ever, preserves some trace of the midrib and is decorated in two zones. The "kantharos" (Type 240) XXXI-2 is a rare early Mycenaean form which owes much to its Gray and Yellow Minyan ancestry.207 It occurred in one of our earliest closed groups along with a large ewer of early type (XXXI-1), both datable to Myc. II B or earliest III A:1. The handmade mug X X-2 found in a child's chamber tomb must be dated to advanced Myc. III B on the basis of the Psi-type figurine found with it. Only 4 cm. in height, it belongs to a baggy type of handmade jug which showed little development from Myc. II to III C.208 No. 450 from Well V 24:1 is a fragment of another handmade miniature, decorated in a style recalling Mycenaean figurines.209 3.

Also from Mycenae (Ch.T., pl. XXII, Tomb 524, no. 8) and Attica (Attica, pl. 8, 6-7).

Myc. III B-C:1. XII-6 (+3 uncatalogued). Deep open bowl with 3 loop handles on rim. Myc. II B. XVI-1 (1 example). Here we have grouped together some 26 examples of 10 different shapes. Significantly, several of these shapes (e.g. Types 284, 285, and 294) are found only in our late domestic deposits. The shallow handleless bowls of Types 204 and 207, which occur in several of our tombs, were most likely simple containers for food offerings and have no pretensions beyond their utilitarian function.210 However, the three examples from the Tomb of the Bronzes (III-12, 13, and 16) were sheathed with tinfoil to harmonize with the imitation silver kylikes, whereas XIV-3 has a simple red glaze. X-3 with a flat projecting lip resembles Myc. II B saucers with interior decoration,211 although ours is plain. The shallow bowl with ribbon handles (Type 295) was apparently the more common form in domestic deposits, XII-2 and 499 representing typical examples from late Myc. III B or C:1.212 The same shape, however, goes back to Myc. III A, and occurs with tin-incrustation in two examples from the Tomb of the Bronzes (111-4 and 11), as well as in others from tombs at Mycenae and Ialysos.213 Examples of deep bowls with one horizontal handle (Types 304 and 283), although not com- mon, are significant, since they are clearly earlier than the advent of the typical deep bowl or skyphos (Type 284) of Myc. III B. No. 415, which probably came from a disturbed grave beneath the Stoa of Attalos, has a conical foot underneath and a deep bowl resembling kylikes of Type 263, and is covered with the monochrome red glaze so frequent in that form.214 X-5 is a rather ordinary example of Type 283, a deep bowl of semiglobular shape with one handle, which may have contributed to the evolution of the Myc. III B krater and skyphos shape.215 Although especially popular in Attica in Myc. III A: 2 and transitional III B, the one- handled type is also found at Tell el Amarna, Rhodes and the Argolid and cannot be claimed as specifically Attic.216 The small fragment 432, from a bothros in front of the Stoa of Attalos (P 8:9), is a rare and important piece. Although only a small part of the bowl with a curve- stemmed spiral band of early type is preserved, the horizontally set handle is intact and is distinguished by a vertical protuberance giving it a wishbone-like effect.217 The closest parallels, however, are not with pottery but with the two silver and gold cups with inlaid bulls' heads from Dendra and Enkomi, each of which has a button-like protuberance rising above the loop handle.2l8 Such cups, which were clearly the product of the same atelier and which can be dated to the earlier fourteenth century, may well have given rise to ceramic imitations like our cup which, on the basis of its ornament, ought not to be later than the first half of the fourteenth century. 210 Hesperia, XXXV, 1966, p. 386 and note 21. 211 Korakou, p. 53, fig. 72. 212 Fountain, pp. 379f., figs. 61-62, Shape 9. 213 Hesperia, XXXV, 1966, p. 394 (catalogue). 214 See also Furumark, M.P., p. 66. 215 Also Furumark, M.P., pp. 46ff., who emphasizes, I think correctly, the basic Middle Helladic origin of the deep bowl with loop handles, leading to the large Myc. III B kraters (Types 281-282) and the more bell-shaped skyphos (Types 283- 284). In this development the hemispherical bowl with one handle (Type 283) seems more an offshoot than a direct link from Types 279 to 281-282 and 284-285. 216 B.M.Cat., I, 1, A 996 (Tell el Amama); lalysos, p. 188, fig. 111 (Ialysos); Berbati, fig. 19, 7-9; B.S.A., LX, 1965, p. 176, fig. 7, 22 (Mycenae).

C. 131</page><page sequence="149">MYCENAEAN PERIOD: INTRODUCTION None of our examples of the deep bowl or skyphos (Types 284-285) comes from a bona fide tomb group, since the dromos fill of Tomb XII was clearly not sepulchral. Indeed this shape has usually been associated with habitation levels, and even in the Argolid is usually confined to late burials of a period that is hardly represented in the Agora.219 With the possible excep- tion of XII-3 and 4, our examples can all be connected with the occupation of the Acropolis and its slopes in latest Myc. III B and III C:1, 43-4566 coming from Well V 24:1, 472 from Well S 27:7, and 496-497 from miscellaneous contexts. Our closest parallels are naturally with Broneer's pottery from the North Slope and from the fill of the Fountain. Nos. 453 and 464 are good examples of Myc. III B:2 panel patterns,220 whereas XII-3 and 472, which are com- pletely covered with dark glaze inside and out except under the foot, are typical of the Granary style.2 The others should be assigned to a transitional III B/C stage.222 A single example of the deep conical bowl or kalathos shape (Type 291) came from one of the latest burials in the Ares Tomb (VII-24). This shape, which enjoyed a late vogue in the Myc. III C0:1 period, particularly in Rhodes and the eastern Aegean,223 has also been found in the fill of the Mycenaean Fountain224 and more recently at Perati225 in east Attica, where some examples have plastic figurines of mourning women attached to the rim.226 Our example with its interior frieze of carelessly drawn fish may show some influence from the Late Eastern pictorial style227 but is hardly to be considered an import. The metallic origin of this shape has been pointed out by Furumark,228 and one should note that the Agora produced a diminutive bronze example (XIII-1) of the earlier type with spout and wishbone handles terminating in a but- ton.229 The fragmentary examples of large open bowls with thickened rim and low ring foot from the dromos of Tomb XII (XII-6 plus 3 uncatalogued specimens) seem to belong to vessels of Type 294. Such bowls, with pinched out ribbon handles set horizontally at the rim, are found in domestic deposits at Korakou, Athens, and elsewhere in a late Myc. III B to C:1 horizon.230 This accords well with the general nature of the fill in this unfinished chamber tomb (see pp. 197-199). We have reserved until the last a consideration of our most handsome bowl, the beautiful Lily Bowl from a child's grave (XVI-1), because this is not a standard shape in Furumark and to the best of my knowledge is not exactly paralleled elsewhere. The flat projecting rim, the semiglobular shape, and above all the naturalistic floral decoration relate it to a group of Myc. II B-III A: 1 spouted cups with a vertical ribbon handle rising above the rim (Type 253).231 In our specimen, however, the three handles rise horizontally from the rim and suggest that 219 Cf.

Low Beaked Jug or Ewer (Form 41) P1. 67 Type 143: big, depressed ovoid with narrow neck, long beak, metallic handle, etc. Myc. II B. VII-17; XXIII-2 (2 examples). Type 144: big, ovoid, with generally shorter beak and less clearly metallic features. Myc. III A:1. XXIII-1; XXIV-8, 9, 10; XXXI-1; 417; XXXVII-2; XL-6 (8 examples). Type 145: shape more globular with wider neck and shorter beak. Myc. III A:2. XIX-1 (1 example). Our 11 examples of this attractive shape give a distinctive character to the Mycenaean pot- tery from the Agora. Although such ewers are- known from the Argolid,235 from Thebes, Chalkis and Volos to the North,36 and from Ialysos and Cyprus,237 Attica has produced an astonishing number of fine examples,38 a fact which naturally raises the question of local production. The origin of the type, which at first had strong metallic features, must lie in the Myc. II B style of the Argolid, e.g. the ewer from Korakou and early imported examples at Ialysos and Thebes,239 and this derivation may account for the Ephyraean-like arrangement of isolated motives distributed usually three times over the polished clay ground of the vase. Furthermore, the motives themselves, such as the nautili of XXXVII-2 and XL-6 and the more abstract triple spiral of XXIII-1, were popular in Ephyraean ware.240 Ours are clearly a bit later and some- what less metallic in shape, although most preserve something of the plastic ridge at the junc- tion of neck and shoulder and the knob termination of the handle; three (VII-17; XXXI-1 and XL-6) have a reminiscence of the foliate band. The first of these, the octopus and dolphin ewer from the Ares Tomb (VII-17), is stylistically earlier in shape and allies itself to a ewer with poorly preserved decoration of papyrus blossoms from Tomb XXIII (2); in fabric the dolphin ewer seems local, whereas XXIII-2 may be imported. Neither, however, could be the basis for the free-field arrangement of XXIII-1, XXXI-1, XXXVII-2 and XL-6. It is with this 232 See H. A.

Should they be regarded as "the kind of vase Athens does well"241 or as proof of strong com- mercial contact with the Argolid in the Myc. III A: 1 period? Because of the widespread distribution of similar ewers2 and because of Athens' other Argolid connections in Myc. III A: 1 (see below, p. 151) I am inclined to the latter opinion. The monochrome ewers XXIV-8, 9, and 10 are a different case. They belong to the dull glaze-wash provincial ware of the deep-bowled kylikes (Type 263), and like them attest to the strength of the Myc. II B-III A: 1 tradition in Athens through the later fourteenth century. Our latest ewer is XIX-1, a poor specimen obviously of local manufacture, of the later form (Type 145) in which the metallic features have practically disappeared. Dating to transitional Myc. III A/B, it shows the persistent popularity of this form in Athens for a period of over one hundred years. 2. Amphoroid Beaked Jug (Form 42) P1. 67 Type 150: tall piriform with narrow neck and short beak, two vertical handles. Myc. II B-III A:2. I-4; III-1; XVIII-4 and 5; XXI-7; XXIV-11; XXXV-4 (7 examples). These examples also provide an excellent series illustrating a type which was introduced early in one or more imported examples (e.g. 1-4) and which was perpetuated with increasing carelessness during the fourteenth century. Perhaps metallic in origin and probably Minoan,243 it may derive from a simple functional copper shape like that found in the Tomb of the Tripod Hearth at Knossos,244 which has a single arched ribbon handle of more purely metallic type and the characteristic neck ring. The beautiful highly lustrous glaze varying from reddish brown to black of the jug from the East Bench of Tomb I (4) furthers the illusion of a copper vase, and a similar effect is found on two jugs from the Argive Heraion.24 This treatment, along with its grander scale and proportions, suggests that I-4 was an import from the same Argolid region that produced the other vases on the East Bench. Most vases of this shape are, however, left in a yellow-buff monochrome clay ground resembling Yellow Minyan ware. This is true of our XVIII-4 and 5, as well as other vases of the same shape from the Argive Heraion,24 Thebes,247 Asine,4 and elsewhere in Attica.249 In our examples the surface is not well smoothed or polished, contrasting with the elegance of shape; yet there seems to be no trace of the tin-incrustation that was almost certainly used on III-1, which formed part of the imitation silver service of the wealthier Tomb of the Bronzes.250 241 Hesperia, XXXV, 1966, p. 75. I am not convinced that Mrs. Vermeule is correct (with the exception of the monochrome glazed examples and those that are obviously different, like VII-17 and XIX-1). Since there is such a widespread distribu- tion of similar examples, is it not preferable to regard this as the result of Mycenaean trade in the Myc. III A:1 period? Only if we could assume an Attic origin for the examples found elsewhere, which seems highly unlikely, would we be justified in claiming the ewer as an Attic type. 242 See examples cited above, notes 235-237. 243 Furumark, M.P., p. 20, who thinks the form was originally ceramic but acquired a metallic appearance.

The other two, XXI-7 and XXXV-4, are in the provincial monochrome ware. 3. Jugs with Cut-away Neck (Forms 34, 36, 37) Types 132-133: tall piriform shape. Myc. II B-III A:2. XXXV-1 (1 example). Type 135: small early globular jug. Myc. I-III A:1. VII-19; XVI-7 (2 examples). Type 136: large globular or globular biconical. Myc. III A:2-B. VII-18; VIII-5; XXVII-1; 427 (4 examples). The above seven examples, six of which certainly come from tombs, do not form as unified a series as do the ewers or beaked jugs. Several different shapes are involved, and in some we seem to be dealing with local variants. The earliest is clearly XVI-7, a small globular jug, pos- sibly with stippled decoration, from the Lily Bowl Grave; it has close parallels in Myc. II examples from the Argolid.252 The other small jug (VII-19) has been correctly diagnosed as a "crude imitation in miniature of the 'oinochoe' form," an elegant type usually decorated with vertical wavy bands.253 Of this more conventional Myc. III A:1-2 form, which is known in Attica,25 we have a fragmentary example, presumably once quite fine (XXXV-1). Two other fragmentary examples (VIII-5 and 427) have painted decoration of good quality and should belong to the earlier Myc. III A:2 period. Tantalizingly little of the lip of 427 is preserved, but it must have been a handsome specimen with a plastic ridge at junction of neck and shoulder, and plastic bosses arranged like a figure-eight shield probably near the handle.255 VII-18 and XXVII-1, both of rather micaceous clay with dull monochrome red glaze wash, seem clearly local products, the former earlier in shape,256 the latter approaching the Myc. III B form with abbreviated cutout at handle attachment and little flare to the rim. 4. Narrow-necked Jug with Straight Lip (Forms 25, 29) Type 112: small globular shape. Myc. III A:2. X-6; XI-2 (2 examples). Type 121: narrow-necked with handle from below rim. Myc. III B-C :1. XII-5 (1 example). The earlier specimens (X-6 and XI-2) are of gritty fabric covered with dull monochrome glaze relating them to other local products. In a sense they are variations of the monochrome ewers and jugs with cut-away necks. 251 Two examples from the Argive Heraion have somewhat more decoration (Prosymna, II, figs. 166, 340; 256, 645). Also Ch.T., pl. XLII, 42 and an almost identical example from Thebes (AeX-r., III, 1917, p. 161, fig. 120, 2). 252 Korakou, p. 50, fig. 67, p. 57, fig. 79; Prosymna, II, fig. 681. 253 Ares Tomb, p. 212.

III A:2e period. There is enough of the rim with the root of the handle in a non-joining fragment to suggest that it was cut away; however the location of the bosses with relation to the handle is not certain, and the decoration can be made out only with the greatest difficulty (see below, p. 250). 256 Ares Tomb, p. 212.

It has the high narrow neck with splaying lip, the articulated shoulder and handle set below the rim of the type current in latest Myc. III B to early III C,25 with which dating the pothook spiral decoration accords. 5. Small Round Jug with Straight Lip (Form 25) Types 113-115: globular to biconical. Myc. III A:2-C:1. VII-22; XXI-8; XXXIX-2 (3 examples). These are rather undistinguished small jugs, obviously related to the larger coarse wide- mouthed jugs, and like them show little stylistic development in shape. XXXIX-2, of rather coarse fabric and covered with poor red to brown glaze, is undoubtedly the earliest since it was found in a child's pit grave with a Myc. III A:2 kylix (XXXIX-1). The banded and more biconical example XXI-8 may be as late as the beginning of Myc. III B,258 although nothing else in the tomb would suggest so late a date.259 VII-22 from one of the upper burials in the Ares Tomb does not differ much from this last example, yet it must be about one hundred years later,26 an indication perhaps of the conservatism of a simple type. 6. Coarse Wide-mouthed Jugs (Forms 23, 24, 26) Type 109: plain globular. Myc. I-III B. VII-20; XV-2; XVI-10; XVII-2; XXIX-2 (5 examples). Type 105: globular biconical with splaying neck. Myc. III B. XIV-8; 443; 478 (3 examples). Type 116: globular with high neck. Myc. III B (-C). 446 (1 example). These jugs are more than twice as large as in the preceding group (ca. 20 cm. in height compared with 8 cm.) and are of coarse clay either covered with a thin glaze wash or with the surface merely smoothed (XIV-8; 443 and 478). In one case (446) we have simple banded decoration.261 In the early examples (VII-20; XV-2 and XVI-10) the neck is low and flaring, more or less continuous with the shoulder, and the body capacious and well-formed with the greatest diameter somewhat above the halfway point. XVII-2 with a taller and more sharply articulated neck and a more ovoid body approaches the Myc. III B type (Type 105). The heavily rolled rim of 443 and 478 agrees more closely with specimens found in the fill of the Fountain62 and should point to the end of III B or early III C. 257 Type found in the houses on the North Slope of the Acropolis (Hesperia, II, 1933, p. 368, fig. 40, b) but apparently not in the fill of the Fountain, although the rest of the deposit J 10:1 accords closely with the Fountain material and the pothook spiral decoration of our jug occurs there (Fountain, p. 374, fig. 56 a, p. 397, fig. 78, a, c, d, j). Cf. also a similar jug from Tomb I: 7 at Asine (Asine, p. 409, fig. 268, 8) dated to Myc. III C:le by Furumark (C.M.P., p. 76). 258 Cf. Korakou, p. 67, fig. 96, which Furumark assigns to III B. 259 See below, pp. 213-214. for the sequence of burials in this tomb and the problem posed by the alabastron XXI-9 asso: ciated with the latest burial by the doorway. 260 The cup (VII-28), the kalathos (VII-24) and the fragmentary krater (VI-25) are all clearly of early Myc. III C style. 261 This seems to me somewhat different in shape from the decorated examples of Type 110 (cf. Zygouries, p. 169, fig. 164, 361, 352) where the neck is lower and more articulated from the shoulder. It may show some influence of the Lev.-Myc. Type 116 (M.P., p. 603) where the neck is about one-third the total height and more splaying. At any rate, it seems later than the other examples. 262 Fountain, p. 396, fig. 77. 186</page><page sequence="154">MYCENAEAN POTTERY FROM THE AGORA d) SPECIALIZED SHAPES Here we have grouped a variety of rarer shapes, some of which seem to have had a primarily ritual purpose, others to have been connected principally with the burials of children, whereas a third group from domestic deposits concerns the preparation and storage of food. 1. Rhyta and Ritual Vases Type 77: small handleless jar. Myc. II B-III A: 1 (-2). XXIV-1; XXVI-2 (2 examples). Type 199: conical rhyton, or filler. Myc. I-III B. 445; 447 (2 examples). Type 201: ostrich-egg rhyton, globular with funnel and vertical handle. Myc. III A-B. XXI-6 (1 example). Type 129: small hydria; variant with pierced base. Myc. III A:2-B. XXVI-1 (1 example). While one should probably not claim a ritual usage for all the above examples, they either derive from what seems originally to have been a ritual shape, or have certain peculiarities which suggest a ritual interpretation.263 XXIV-1 is an example of an early type of handleless globular pot with stippled decoration which certainly derives ultimately from the rhyton made from a genuine ostrich-egg.24 The earliest examples are more ovoid and one is still pierced at the bottom, whereas in our example and in others of the same Myc. III A:1 period the shape is more depressed or globular and the bottom is solid.265 Probably to be associated with this same shape is the unique and unfortunately fragmentary pot from Tomb XXVI (2), where the lip flares and has been serrated to give the effect of the blossom end of a pomegranate.266 The shape (P1. 76) was apparently more ovoid than globular, showing perhaps a conflation of the pomegranate with the ostrich-egg; the bottom, which is incomplete, seems to have been flat and was probably not pierced. Although we do not know of any Mycenaean association of the pomegranate with the dead,267 the discovery of this unusual pot in the same tomb with the octopus hydria with pierced base (XXVI-1) strengthens the idea of a religious significance. XXI-6 is an example of the piriform jug-like type of rhyton, which seems to have developed from the Minoan pegtop variety.268 Here the lower part is protracted into a hollow funnel which would have facilitated filling smaller vases but could also have served for ritual drinking 263 Nilsson, M.M.R. discounts the ritual significance of the rhyton, and thinks the only shape for which we can claim a ritual usage is the narrow-necked libation jug depicted on Minoan and Mycenaean signets (pp. 144-145). I fail to see how the various vases with pierced base-rings and multiple orifices can be explained if they had no religious significance (see Attica, pp. 55-58). 264 Karo, S.G., pl. CXLI-II. For derivation of this shape from ostrich-egg, see Prosymna, I, pp. 405-406 and M.P., p. 73. 265 The pierced example (Type 76) comes from Tomb 518 at Mycenae (Ch.T., p. 82, pl. I, 32). Furumark, M.P., p. 73, note 5 points out that his Type 77 has been dated too early and belongs essentially to Myc. II B-III A :1. 266 A resemblance also noted by A. Akerstrom who agrees that the pot, despite its uniqueness, is clearly Mycenaean and probably Myc. III A. The technique is excellent, and although the motives of concentric semicircles and fine banding are unusual at this period, they can be matched in other examples (see below, pp. 228-229). Even the serrated rim is found on a small pithoid jar from a new Mycenaean chamber tomb on Karpathos, although its excavator Charitonides claims the cutting to be moder (AT-r., XVII, 1961-1962, pp. 32ff., No. 97, pl. 26 a). This tomb is Myc. III A, and there is a remarkable affinity between some of its pottery and the Agora material. 267 See the discussion under XXVI-2 with reference to the Eighteenth Dynasty examples of pomegranate pots and the revival of the shape in Late Geometric graves.

III A:2-B. Of the more common funnel-type of rhyton we have only two fragments (445 and 447), both from rubbish deposits. In 445 there is no doubt of the shape, but the surface is poorly preserved and the decoration consists merely of encircling bands; it is probably late Myc. III B. No. 447 is much finer and is painted with some form of floral decoration. One might note the relative popularity of this form in Athens272 and in Attica,273 a popularity which seems to extend to ritual vases as a whole. Stubbings has collected a number of other ritual vase shapes, some of quite elaborate and fantastic design.274 Only one of these additional types occurs in the Agora, the small hydria with octopus decoration and pierced resting surface (XXVI-1) we have discussed above (p. 125). Furumark seems to have missed the piercings in the examples he cites and to have combined them with a simpler and more serviceable type (Type 129).275 Those with intentional holes are, however, all handsome vases with high-quality decoration, in one case with a clearly ritual connotation: the Ialysos hydria with horns of consecration and double axes.276 Since all come from tombs, one should perhaps associate them with liquid offerings to the dead at the time of the funeral rites.277 2. Feeding Bottles and Askoi Types 160-161: side-spouted necked jar with basket handle. Myc. III A:2-B. XIV-6, 7; XXXIX-3; 490 (3 examples). Type 194: baseless askos. Myc. II B-III :1. XVI-8 (1 example). Type 195: based askos. Myc. II A-III C: 1. V-5; VII-21; XVI-9; XVIII-8; XXIV-21; 504 (6 examples). Both shapes apparently derive from Helladic or Cycladic ancestry, and the askos never be- came standardized to the same extent as other Mycenaean forms.278 For the side-spouted jar the strong presumption that it was used for feeding children has led to the name "feeding bottle,"279 a conclusion supported by the distribution of our examples in children's graves. Three of our examples come from unequivocal contexts: XIV-6 from the west dromos niche of the Tomb 269 M.P., p. 71, note 8 and references. 270 Attica, p. 56, fig. 25, B, pi. 18, 3. 271 Prosymna, II, figs. 261, 1056; 726. 272 Four fragments from the Acropolis: Graef, Ant.

Vasen, pl. XVII, 114). 274 Attica, pp. 55-59. In addition to the above types he cites the following: 1) Small jug or hydria with pierced base-ring like our XXVI-1. 2) Another of essentially the same form but with plastic figure-eight shields from Vourvatsi (pl. 18, 4). 3) Jug in Berlin from a cave on Hymettos with small replicas communicating with apertures to main vase which is also pierced (pl. 14, 8). 4) Rhyton from Trachones with hollow ring handles pierced to communicate with interior which is also pierced at bottom (Myk. Vasen, pl. XIX, 137). A similar fragmentary example with pictorial decoration representing a procession has now been found in the Bronze Age temple on Keos (Hesperia, XXXIII, 1964, p. 332, pl. 62, 2). 5) Bucket-like pot from Vourvatsi with pierced base (pl. 18, 6). 275 Zygouries, p. 173, fig. 170 (the hole visible in the photograph opposite the main handle is above the resting surface and seems to be accidental). 276 Ialysos, p. 130, fig. 51. 277 Mylonas, Myc.M.A., pp. 176ff. makes a distinction between funeral rites and an actual cult of the dead. 278 M.P., pp. 34, 102 for feeding bottle; p. 68 for askos. 279 Prosymna, I, p. 444.

It is likely that the fourth example (490), from a sixth-century well, came from a disturbed child's grave in the area of the Mycenaean tombs XVIII-XXI.280 Skeletal analysis points to the association of feeding bottles with somewhat older children than one might expect, namely the five to seven year range, suggesting perhaps the desire to give some infantile solace for their journey to the Underworld.281 Feeding bottles were seldom decorated, usually being glazed all over (XIV-7 and 490) or merely painted with bands (XIV-6 and XXXIX-3), and their dating is therefore difficult. Furumark282 endeavors to make some sequence from the shape and angle of the spout, whereas Mrs. Hankey283 uses the location of the spout in relation to the handle, but neither system works too well for our examples, which from their context must be dated to later Myc. III A:2 and early Myc. III B.284 The askos has an even earlier ancestry, deriving from Early Bronze askoid shapes which in turn reflect the original skin prototype.285 Our one example of the small baseless type (XVI-8), which often developed along theriomorphic lines, comes from the pit grave of a small girl, which also yielded a small black handmade askos (XVI-9) with high narrow spout that could have served for feeding. Indeed, although there is less definite evidence than for feeding bottles, the association of small askoi with children's burials seems likely.286 XVI-9 is quite unstand- ardized in shape and not Mycenaean in technique; it most likely represents a continuation of the Middle Helladic repertory into Mycenaean times.287 Our other askoi of the based type (Type 195) are somewhat more canonical, although the askos never became a really standard shape and seems to have enjoyed a greater popularity in Attica than in the Argolid.288 Our earliest and most elaborate example (VII-21) combines the vertical spout of the stirrup-vase with the basket handle of the feeding bottle and the vertical wavy striped decoration of the oinochoe.289 In XVIII-8 the high basket handle is retained, but the shape is more depressed with the spout obliquely placed; it is covered with a thin black wash, perhaps in imitation of older examples (e.g. XVI-9). The same is true for V-5, which comes closer to the more standard form (Type 195) with short oblique spout and loop handle connecting spout to top of vase. These two examples are small (ca. 9 cm. high). In the larger examples (ca. 16 cm. high) the handle is even more condensed and completely integrated with the spout; XXIV-21 is covered with a thin orange wash, whereas 504 is merely smoothed. 280 This well also yielded a Mycenaean figurine (T 1653) which should be further confirmation for associating 490 with a child's burial. 281 See Mylonas on the use of terracotta figurines in children's graves with much the same purpose in mind (Myc.M.A., pp. 115-116). 282 M.P., p. 609, Types 159-161. 283 Chalkis, p. 69, where a case is made for the type with spout at right angles to the handle being the earlier. 284 XXXIX-3 from its closed context and association with a Myc. III A:2 kylix (XXXIX-1) of fairly early type ought not to be later than the mid to third quarter of the fourteenth century, yet in shape the feeding bottle is closer to the late example (XIV-7) introduced from above in the Tomb of the Niches than to XIV-6 from the west niche, which must be the earlier in this tomb. In itself XIV-6 has the flaring spout and more angular handle of Furumark's later type, but the spout at right angles to the handle which Mrs. Hankey considers the earlier form. 285 M.P., p. 68. See now the E.H. II askos from Lera III (Hesperia, XXIII, 1954, pl. 11, a) which shows that the based form is also an early invention. 286 Korakou, p. 53, fig. 73, p. 102 (Grave I: "grave of a young girl" with bones poorly preserved); Zygouries, p. 172, fig. 169, 328 (from chamber tomb XXXV which yielded a number of terracotta figurines and a feeding bottle); B.C.H., LXXXII, 1958, p. 671, fig. 4 (child's grave at Aliki). 287 The only other parallel to XVI-9 that I have found comes from Tomb 18 at the Argive Heraion (Prosymna, I, p. 453; II, fig. 110, 225) which Blegen describes as "in an inferior kind of grey Minyan ware."

Domestic Shapes Type 320: tripod cooking pot or "cauldron." Myc. II-III C. 441 (1 example + uncatalogued fragments). Type 236: ladle or semiglobular cup with raised handle. Myc. II B-III C. 458; 484 (2 examples). Type 334: handleless lid pierced with central hole. Myc. III A-C. XII-9; XXI-6 (2 examples). Type 335: conical lid with loop handle; often perforated. Myc. II B-III C. 461 (1 example). Type 13: pithos with flat base. Myc. III. 462; 463; 464 (3 examples). Most of our examples are fragmentary, coming from rubbish deposits or stratified fill, and they thus have little to contribute to the fuller repertory found by Broneer on the North Slope. The leg of a tripod cooking pot, 441, belongs to the form represented in more complete examples from houses built over the northeast stairway and from the fill of the Fountain.290 Although most of our extant examples belong to the latest occupation levels, it is doubtful if the form had changed much from earlier Mycenaean times.291 The ladle, represented by 458 and 484, is also known from the North Slope excavations.292 Characterized by a high loop handle and a small bowl, which in the earlier examples had a flat resting surface,293 ours and the North Slope examples seem to belong to the later type with rounded bowl which could only have been hung. No. 461, of gritty clay like the cooking-pot fabric (see above, p. 119), is apparently part of a domed lid, originally with loop handle, and perforated with holes about 1 cm. in diameter, which suggest that it was used in connection with a brazier or incense burner.294 Our other two lids are of the flat-topped variety with a central hole instead of a handle. XII-9, from the domestic deposit in the dromos of Tomb XII, is large and undecorated, and would have provided a suitable lid for a large pot such as the coarse amphora XII-7.295 An earlier decorated example (XXI-5) comes from a tomb which had a fairly long history, but its association in a pit with early alabastra suggests that it ought not to be later than Myc. III A: 1.296 Of the pithos shape we have the fairly complete undecorated example, 464, which is relatively small, apparently handmade, and equipped with side handles in the manner of the belly amphora (Type 58); however, its generally lax shape connects it more closely with the standard pithos form (Type 13) than with the more organic belly amphora shape.

Both repertories are essentially of early derivation going back to the Myc. II B or III A:1 period. Whereas the deep-bowled kylix (Type 263), the pithoid jar with three vertical handles (Type 23), the beaked ewer (Type 143), and the squat alabastron (Type 82) are typical of the Agora repertory of shapes, so are the wave or rock pattern (Mot. 32), the curve-stemmed (Mot. 49) and running spiral (Mot. 46), floral patterns that have not yet become too stylized for recog- nition, such as the sacral ivy (Mot. 12), the palm (Mots. 14 and 15), the lily (Mot. 9) and the papyrus (Mot. 11), and marine motives like the argonaut (Mot. 22) and the octopus (Mot. 21) which came into being in the Late Minoan I B period and the subsequent Palace style. Just as the stirrup-vase and certain other shapes which characterize the Amarna koine are atypical of the Agora material, so is the Myc. III flower (Mot. 18) and the whorl-shell or murex (Mot. 23), both of which are represented by only a few examples.301 Indeed much of the range of patterns characteristic of developed Myc. III A: 2 and earlier III B is missing from our material, and one suddenly encounters later Myc. III B motives on our few fragments which connect with the much fuller repertory from the North Slope and Mycenaean Fountain.302 A few patterns will be discussed in more detail to illustrate their early nature and to show how, in some examples, they have been continued or altered along local lines. The stipple pattern (Mot. 77) is chronologically restricted to Myc. II A-III A:1, and does not lead to a further evolution. Significantly, our relatively small body of material yielded five examples, several of which may have been locally produced.303 These represent three teacups (X-4; XL-7 and 9), a globular pot derived from the ostrich-egg rhyton (XXIV-1) and the jug with cut-away neck (XVI-7). Although the simple scale pattern (Mot. 70) admits of little development from Myc. II A through III B, the way in which it is used on our examples (1-2, 9; VII-12; XIV-4; XVI-3; XVII-1; XXI-1; XXIV-3, 7; XL-11) points to an early date. All are pithoid jars with the exception of the last example, a strap-handled krater, and the patterned zone is deep, covering from one-third to two-thirds of the surface.304 With the exception of XVI-3, the scale is simple without the interior elaboration which sometimes characterizes Myc. III A:2 and B scales,305 and this example has the simple dotted filling which goes back to Myc. II306 and is carelessly rendered in an apparently local style. 297 Fountain, p. 399, fig. 80. Also cf. the knob decorated with incised radial lines from the North Slope (Hesperia, VI, 1937, p. 567, fig. 19, a) with our 463. 98 P 17310-17314 will be discussed by Mrs. Evelyn Smithson in the publication of the Submycenaean and Proto- geometric material. 29 Both in fabric and in shape this example seems closer to the Middle Helladic pithoi discussed above, p. 67. 300 Well over half the vases are undecorated or have simple ornamentation of encircling bands, shoulder net or cross- hatching, parallel oblique lines, etc. which of themselves contribute little to a stylistic analysis of decoration. 301 See below, p. 147. 302 E.g. the antithetic spiral (Mot. 50) on 454 and the panelled patterns (Mot. 75) on 463 and 479. 303 Hesperia, XXXV, 1966, pp. 67, 76. 304 Most come closer to a 2:3 ratio, e.g. 1-2, etc. 305 M.P., p. 403, fig. 70, Mot. 70:5. 306 Despite Furumark's dating of this type to Myc. III A:1 there seem several other clear cases of earlier usage, e.g. on the deep Myc. I-II teacup from Chalkis (Chalkis, pi. 20, 544). 141</page><page sequence="159">MYCENAEAN PERIOD: INTRODUCTION The tricurved arch (Mot. 62) fulfills much the same function as the scale when used to give an all-over reticulated surface to the deep shoulder zone of pithoid jars. We have only one example (1-13), but similar occurrences are known from Rhodes307 and the Argolid.308 The fil- ling ornaments vary, ours using the unstemmed "waz" papyrus which seems to have been the original filling.309 XII-4 illustrates a much later disintegrated version of the tricurved arch, where it is used without interior filling and as an isolated motive.310 The ogival canopy (Mot. 13) was another torsional pattern used for deep zones on early pithoid jars. Although perhaps of ultimate Minoan derivation,311 this pattern was developed especially on the mainland with a strong axial symmetry and was especially common on three- handled jars with horizontally set handles of the Myc. II A and B period (Types 20-21). Our single example (1-7) is in fabric clearly local (see above, p. 118), and its very simplified and careless rendering of the ogival canopy contrasts markedly with the best Argolid examples312 which must have been its prototype. The disintegrated version of the ogival canopy, taking the form of an S-shaped streamer above a band of evenly rounded rock pattern, is found on the two large squat alabastra (I-5 and 6) from the East Bench of Tomb I.313 Our most common single motive is the solid "wave" or rock pattern (Mot. 32) which occurs on 23 examples, all squat alabastra with the exception of 410, a spouted bowl of Type 253, where the pattern is used pendant from the rim. In the alabastra it rises from the curving wall immediately above the base and frames the shoulder ornament: ogival streamers (1-5 and 6; 489), sacral ivy (VII-4, 5, and 7), rows of dots or dot rosettes (VIII-2; XI-1; XV-3; XXI-2). In other examples the waves are larger and the shoulder is left blank (VII-6) or they are treated uncanonically as an open wave (VII-8), in one case (XXI-3) framing a spiral band. We have only two examples (413, actually one of a pair from the same context) of the elaborate type of crested wave with dot-outlined border characteristic of the best Myc. II B examples,314 and on ours the fragmentary wheel pattern on the base confirms the early date. Spirals of various types constitute the main decoration of a number of examples, with again the main concentration of specific forms derivative from Myc. IIB to III A:1. We have no examples of the early Myc. I-II A tangential spiral band with applied white dots so popular in the Argolid (Mot. 46:9-13), although a few fragments of teacups with such decoration have been found on the Acropolis and North Slope.315 Our examples of the running spiral are of the simpler Myc. III A type, the fine running band spiral with "Zwickel" of the kylix VII-16316 and the more conventional line spiral with abbreviated "Zwickel" of the pilgrim bottle III-14, both careful imported pieces of Myc. III A:1 and III A:2 respectively. Other more carelessly drawn spiral bands occur on examples which may well be of local workmanship: the strap- handled krater, 412, with casual chevron fillings,317 the alabastron XXI-3 which combines 307 Ialysos, p. 160, fig. 87, 1. 308 Prosymna, II, fig. 718, 157; Asine, p. 382, fig. 249, 1. 309 M.P., pp. 392, 261, fig. 33, b, d (Mot. 11, papyrus). 310 Single trefoil arches of earlier ancestry were often used in pictorial compositions to suggest a landscape setting, but the row of isolated arches had a particularly florid late III B and C:1 development (M.P., p. 391, fig. 68, 19, 20, 28, 30, etc.). 311 M.P., p. 274, fig. 37. Furumark is probably correct in connecting this with the rock pattern and ivy leaf spray of L.M. I B derivation: note the atrophied ivy leaves still present in some early examples (Mot. 13: 1-2) and the association of the disintegrated form with the wave pattern on alabastra (Mot. 13: 6, 7, 8). 312 Prosymna, II, fig. 145, 255; N.T.D., p. 43, fig. 46; Ch.T., pl. XLI, 16. 313 N.T.D., p. 93, fig. 104, 1, a and b (same decoration and approximately the same dimensions). This tomb, No. 10, has furnished especially close parallels to the pottery from our Tombs I (2, 8, 5, 6) and III (tin-incrusted vases 6, 7, 9, etc.). 314 Prosymna, II, figs. 207, 1167-1168; 345, 981, 985; 668, 399; Asine, p. 368, fig. 239, 9; Ch.T., pls. XXVII, 2-3, XLIII, 24, 26. It was also diffused to other parts of the Mycenaean world: lalysos, p. 128, fig. 49; Myrsinochorion, TEpyov, 1956, p. 96, fig. 97, Chalkis, pl. 15, 414 B'. 315 A.P. 392 (Hesperia, II, 1933, pp. 363f., fig. 36, c); A.P. 2960 (Fountain, p. 350, fig. 24, b). 316 This seems to be a combination of the broader band spiral of fresco and metal derivation (Mot. 46:2, 4; cf. Ares Tomb, pp. 210-211) with the line spiral with "Zwickel" of ceramic derivation (Mot. 46:40-41). 317 M.P., Mot. 46:42-43. 142</page><page sequence="160">MYCENAEAN POTTERY FROM THE AGORA spiral band with an outline wave, and the kantharos XXXI-2 which does not correctly con- nect the tangents with the outer convolution of the spiral.318 An even greater travesty of the spiral band occurs on the straight-sided alabastron XXI-9 which has ineptly drawn spirals, replaced in several cases by a circle with large central dot. The other two examples of running spirals (452 and 455) are late Myc. III B; both reverse the direction of the spiral, having it run from left to right, and 452 uses the large central eye of other late examples.319 The double and triple spiral (Mot. 47) forming an isolated motive in the manner of Ephyraean decoration320 is symptomatic of the Myc. II B/III A:1 character and influence on much of our material. We find it in triple form on the splendid ewer XXIII-1, a somewhat later version of the II B ewer from Korakou with double spiral motives,321 and in double form on the fragmentary strap-handled krater (1-14) from the dromos of Tomb I. The triple spiral could be easily pic- torialized into a nautilus (Mot. 22), which may account for the popularity of the latter on ewers of the same type as XXIII-1 (XXXVII-2 and XL-6).322 The handle streamers of XXIII-1 and XXXVII-2 also point to an Ephyraean heritage. Just as the ewer shape was perpetuated in debased monochrome examples (XXIV-8, 9, and 10), so the double spiral occurs on the shoulder zone of a late Myc. III A/B ewer of local workmanship (XIX-1) as a reminder of its original derivation. The curve-stemmed spiral (Mot. 49) is a substitute floral pattern of early range, a kind of abbreviated lily.323 We find it used either singly or doubly in the shoulder panels of pithoid jars (1-3; XIV-1; XXIV-4 and 6; 420; and XL-10) in conventional Argolid fashion,34 once on a squat alabastron (VIII-1) and again on the shallow cup with wishbone handle (432). On the ewer XXXI-1 it has been pictorialized by the addition of feathery leaves and tendrils in a bold rather careless style which may connote local manufacture. The stemmed spiral (Mot. 51) has a later range, and occurs on only one example (XII-5), the narrow-necked jug from the dromos fill of the unfinished chamber tomb. Here the hanging or "pothook" spirals confirm the generally late III B/C:1 range of this material. Likewise we have only one example (454) of the antithetic spiral (Mot. 50) which often accompanied the Panel style in its later phase. As we have indicated above, our floral patterns belong in most part to an early stage before complete hybridization and conventionalization set in. Most popular of all is the sacral ivy (Mot. 12), and in a sense its popularity is a corollary to the popularity of the squat alabastron and the rock pattern (Mot. 32), for many examples are found in such combination, notably on the alabastra from the Ares Tomb (VII-4, 5, 7). It also occurs without the wave pattern on the early squat jug (VII-1) and on the Myc. II deep stemmed cup with high-swung handle (XVI-2) where only the triple curving stems are preserved.325 On the straight-sided alabastron XXI-4, the original pattern has been replaced with mere groups of curving triple lines.326 Several pithoid jars of early type make use of the sacral ivy as shoulder decoration: on VII-11 318 The nearest parallel in Furumark is of Myc. III B date (Mot. 46:53), but both the kantharos shape and the association in a closed group with the ewer XXXI-1 show that our example cannot be later than Myc.

I wonder whether the reversed direction of many of the late III B-C spiral bands (e.g. Fountain, p. 357, fig. 32, a, p. 368, fig. 45, e, g) was not due to the fact that such shapes as the krater and the skyphos were inverted on their rims for decoration. 320 See also M.P., p. 358. 321 Korakou, pl.

The original source of the curving line motive is suggested by the Myc. III A:1 tankard from Zygouries (Zygouries, p. 138, fig. 130, 1) with vestigial ivy leaves. 148</page><page sequence="161">MYCENAEAN PERIOD: INTRODUCTION it occurs as the main ornament above an abbreviated wave, on III-1 it is combined with the palm also on curving stem, and on VI-10 it appears in one panel only, dwarfed between two voluted lilies. The lily (Mot. 9) appears twice on vases from the Agora. On the beautiful Lily Bowl which has given its name to Grave XVI, one finds it in its original Myc. II B form as used on Ephyraean goblets from Korakou,327 on a spindle whorl from Mycenae,328 and on a fragmentary cup from Argos.329 As in fresco prototypes, the volutes are thick without many convolutions, but the anthers have acquired several cross-bars which become exaggerated in the later ceramic style.3 Five lilies on this bowl are placed on triple stems curving to the right, whereas the sixth has the fleur de lys arrangement with opposed inward curving leaves or "roots." The total effect is both graceful and varied. By contrast the lilies on the diminutive III A: 1 jar from the Ares Tomb (VII-10) are fussy and crowded. Here the volutes have become a pair of opposed spirals and the anthers have many cross-bars; in two panels the lilies lean to the right on curved stems, in the third they are opposed with a dwarf ivy between. Unfortunately, in our two examples of the papyrus (Mot. 11), XXIII-2 and 427, the glaze is so nearly effaced that it is impossible to be sure of the exact form. Both vase shapes are, how- ever, stylistically early, XXIII-2 a strongly metallic ewer close to the II B example from Korakou, and 427, a jug with cut-away neck. In both examples the papyrus seems to have had the openwork tuft of the fresco prototypes, in 427 with opposed volutes, in XXIII-2 the unvoluted type with framing arcs.331 The ubiquitous Myc. III flower (Mot. 18) which seems to have been a specific III A:2 creation from several elements (lily, papyrus, etc.),33 is hardly present in our material, and the examples are late: the large tankard 429 from the bothros deposit 0 7:14,333 and the small krater or skyphos fragments 496 and 498, which have remnants of floral patterns of voluted type which seem to correspond to o o their Myc. III B date.334 By including the North Slope and Acropolis material, one can considerably enlarge the corpus of Myc. III flowers from Athens; however, these are almost all of late type, and there is little or nothing to indicate the evolution of these motives on Attic soil from the earlier floral forms represented in the Agora tombs.3 Our few stirrup-vases, all of which must be earlier than most of the Acropolis examples, are decorated with concentric arcs (II-1 and XXV-1) or with parallel chevrons (V-3 and 487), both of which Furumark derives from the multiple stem and tongue pattern (Mot. 19).336 One other floral pattern of more elaborate type remains to be discussed, namely the palm (Mots. 14 and 15) which occurs on two examples. On III-15 it is used with a large curve- stemmed ivy leaf and a Zwickel papyrus as part of the handle decoration of a big three-handled 327 Korakou, pis. VI, 4, VII, 1. 328 Ch. T., pi.

III A:l period, becoming as- similated in the III A: 2 period with the papyrus to form the Myc. III flower of voluted type (Mot. 18). See Furumark, M.P., pp. 259, 284ff. 331 Both belong to the general type of M.P., Mot. 11:23-43 (figs. 33, 34), 427 being probably something like no. 33. The unpublished drawing (by Piet de Jong) of X Xl 11-2 shows a motive more like nos. 40-43 (Myc. III A:2e) which seems some- what late for the vase shape. Could it have been more like nos. 23-29 (Myc. II A)? 332 M.P., pp. 284f. 333 Perhaps closest to Mot. 18:82-83 (M.P., p. 293, fig. 45), since it seems to have had a single V-shaped outline with a curving arc of dashes and an internal anther. This would sugest a Myc. II A: 2 late date. 334 For 498 of.

III B (Mot. 18:109, 117, 119, 123, 127, 157 were represented). The same conclusion can be drawn for most of the North Slope material (Fountain, p. 386, fig. 67, g, p. 389, fig. 70, p, q). There are a few exceptions, notably A.P. 1412 (Hesperia, VI, 1937, p. 560, fig. 14, n). 338 M.P., pp. 298f. Both the angular form (Mot. 19: 15-25) and the semicircular (Mot. 19: 26-31) seem to have shown some attraction to the Myc. III flower, especially when used in its place on the shoulder of stirrup-vases. 144</page><page sequence="162">MYCENAEAN POTTERY FROM THE AGORA 145 jar. On this vase the palm is relatively small, and is on a curved stem like the ivy; however, the lower volutes and the knotted trunk are emphasized as in other examples of the Palm I type (Mot. 14).337 The palms on our second example, the Altar Krater (426), are completely different. They have a triple component at the top, long pendant leaves and conventionalized "roots," and belong to a type (Palm II) which Furumark derives from glyptic rather than ceramic proto- types.338 Interestingly enough most examples of such palms occur on vases of the pictorial style, of which our vase is an important new example. Because of the popularity of the pictorial style in the Levant, Furumark suggests that this palm type may have originated in the Eastern Mediterranean, but it should be remembered that such "orientalizing" motives had already en- tered the Minoan glyptic repertory long before the creation of the Myc. III A:2 pictorial style and the Mycenaean commercial penetration of the Levant.339 Our vase with its central altar with horns of consecration (Mot. 36) and probable double axe (Mot. 35)340 standing in an outdoor grove is not only an important addition to the growing corpus of pictorial-style vases from the Greek mainland341 but suggests the essentially ritual nature of many of the earlier pictorial scenes, for which there may well have been prototypes on signets.342 The same combination of palms, horns of consecration and double axe occurs on a small Myc. III A hydria from Ialysos which has the pierced base-ring of a special ritual class.343 Another Myc. III A krater of the strap-handled type, from Enkomi and now in the British Museum, omits the palms, substituting boukrania with double axes between repeated re- presentations of horned altars topped by double axes.344 The Altar Krater, technically a superb example, ranks with the finest products of the pictorial workshops, and is most likely an import from the Argolid during the early III A: 2 period.345 Although the Altar Krater is the only true pictorial-style vase from the Agora, some marine motives verge closely on the pictorial, particularly in the series with octopus representations, whereas others like the nautilus or argonaut (Mot. 22) and the whorl-shell (Mot. 23) were used more or less abstractly. We have already mentioned the close connection between the self- 337 There are no exact parallels to this palm, but the lower part agrees closely with Mot. 14:12 (Myc. II B) and the upper part with Mot. 14:6, 8 (Myc. III A:2). Mot. 14:6 should probably be dated earlier than Furumark does; it comes from the Kopreza krater ('Ep. 'ApX., 1895, pi. 10, 9). I think III-15 should be dated to Myc. III A:l and believe it was re-used from one of the earlier burials as the container for the remnants of a pyre (see above, p. 102). 338 M.P., pp. 278f. 339 See also Archaeology, XIII, 1960, pp. 12-13 with reference to the Enkomi Griffin Krater (B.M. C 397). This same palm type is found on the L.M. I Vaphio cup (Marinatos-Hirmer, fig. 178) as well as on ivories from Argos (B.C.H., XXVIII, 1904, pp. 364ff., figs. 21-22), Mycenae (Marinatos-Hirmer, figs. 220-221), and Rutsi (Marinatos-Hirmer, fig. 222) and gems from Mycenae ('Ep. 'ApX., 1888, pl. 10, 43) and Ialysos (B.M.Cat., Gems, 1926, no. 71, pi. 2). 340 Mylonas (in conversation) has questioned the restoration of the central object above the altar as a double axe because he doubts the significance of the double axe for Mycenaean ritual, apart from purely Minoan borrowings (see Myc.M.A., pp. 169ff.). However, it is difficult to find something else to restore in this position; it could scarcely have been a palm of the adjacent type, which would not have had a completely bare shaft. 341 Archaeology, XIII, 1960, p. 10, figs. 6, 8, 10. To these should be added new material from Tiryns ('ApX. 'Eqp., 1956, XpoviK(, pp. 5-8, figs. 10-12, 14), Mycenae (pcpaKT1Kd, 1951, pp. 195-196, fig. 6), Argos (B.C.H., LXXX, 1956, pp. 361ff., figs. 2, 5), the Pylos region (B.C.H., LXXXV, 1961, p. 705, fig. 6); Aliki Glyphada (Epyov, 1954, p. 10, fig. 8) as well as important late material from Iolkos (B.C.H., LXXXV, 1961, pp. 768f., figs. 20-21) and Perati (B.C.H., LXXXIII, 1959, p. 598, fig. 32). 342 Cf. the Homage Krater in the Louvre (Karageorghis, A.J.A., LXII, 1958, pl. 99; Vermeule, Gr.B.A., p. 206, fig. 36) with the Mycenaean gold signet ring from Tiryns (Marinatos-Hirmer, fig. 207 above) where Ta-urt demons with jugs take the place of the file of soldiers and priest.

III B. Through the kindness of Mr. Reynold Higgins, I was able to examine this vase and can certify that it was a strap-handled krater and probably of Myc. III A :2 date. It apparently had five boukrania and four altars on each side. 345 I would compare it with the Window Krater from Kourion (Karageorghis, J.H.S., LXXVII, 1957, p. 269), the Maroni chariot krater in the Metropolitan Museum (A.J.A., XLIX, 1945, pp. 544ff., figs. 8-10), and a few others of like quality that I have handled. The krater from Kopreza with dancing women on one side and palms on the other is probably contem- porary, but is disappointingly provincial ('E. 'ApX., 1895, pi. 10, 9), see below, p. 249.</page><page sequence="163">MYCENAEAN PERIOD: INTRODUCTION contained double or triple spiral (Mot. 47) and the nautilus, and they are often used inter- changeably with much the same effect. One need only compare the ewer with spirals X XIII-1 with the nautilus ewers XXXVII-2 and XL-6, or the strap-handled krater with double spiral 1-14 with the nautilus krater X L-3. These are all rather simple "curtailed" versions in which the animal's body is minimized and the coils emphasized by many spiral convolutions (XL-3 and 6). Such nautili have good Myc. III A:1 pedigrees and were particularly popular in Attica,346 although known also in Rhodes,347 Chalkis,348 and Thebes, which has produced one of the earliest examples.349 Despite their predominantly northern distribution, sherds of such nautilus ewers found in the Atreus bothros at Mycenae350 make it likely that at least the earliest examples were imported from the Argolid. The nautili on the magnificent pithoid jar from the Tomb of the Ivory Pyxides (I-1) are of a different type with well-defined body and tentacles less tightly coiled. They are not exactly matched in Furumark nor in any example known to me, being midway between the Myc. II B nautilus on the Thebes ewer (Mot. 22:4) and the more elaborate versions on the large III A: 2 jars from Rhodes (Mot. 22:11-12). The coil type is early, but the spiral "eye" and the additional looping tentacle in front resemble the nautili on a jar from Kameiros.351 Ours are apparently the antecedent stage of a type which became popular in Rhodes. The octopus or "cuttlefish" (Mot. 21) is found on four of our examples which cover a wide chronological range and illustrate the development of this motive. Originating in the L.M. I B marine style, the octopus with its curving tentacles was well suited to the all-embracing torsional effect beloved by the Minoans.352 Our earliest example, the ewer VII-17, has become more conventionalized along Mycenaean lines with an axial placement and symmetric tentacles; none- theless the large naturalistic body, the flamboyant spread of arms and the inclusion of curlicues suggestive of seaweed preserve something of the earlier marine style, which is enhanced by the addition of two dolphins. The fabric, as well as the absence of exact parallels, suggests a local Athenian product of the late Myc. II B period. The deep-bowled kylix, 426, with a large octopus on each side belongs to a type especially common on Rhodes, where most examples are some- what later.3 Ours has the large body with four tentacles on each side commonly found on Myc. III A:1-2 rhyta and amphoroid kraters, rather than the abbreviated version of the Rhodian kylikes.35 As in many of the Myc. III A:2 (and some III B) specimens, the suckers, which had originally been suggested by the scalloped or fringed lower edge of the tentacle, are here replaced by superimposed white dots. The same scheme, but with the body also covered with white dots, is found on the small hydria XXVI-1, where each of the three creatures has been abbreviated to the two-tentacled version of the stemmed cups.35 This vase, both in shape and decoration, has close parallels in the Argolid and should be dated to advanced Myc.

Our fourth example, 603, is over a century later, belonging to the Myc. III 0:1 period. Unfortunately, it is a mere scrap; however, there seems little doubt that the dark heart-shaped form with reserved "eyes" comes from the body of an octopus of the type commonly found on Late Eastern Myc. III C:1 stirrup-vases.356 The fringed outline, as well as the end of a tentacle in the upper left, confirms this identification. The fringed tentacles in this type are quite different from the Myc. III A-B dotted type and probably reflect renewed Minoan influence in the creation of this late style.357 Although known from an unstratified find from the Dipylon cemetery358 this is the only other evidence for a late octopus stirrup-vase in Athens, compared to countless examples from Perati in eastern At- tica,359 and it thus does not preclude Desborough's theory of a basic distinction between eastern Attica and Athens at the close of the Mycenaean period.360 Our two examples of fish or dolphins (Mot. 20), although both occurring in the Ares Tomb, are at opposite chronological points. Both, however, may reflect indirect Minoan influence. The dolphins of the octopus ewer VII-17 belong to the L.M. I B-L.M. II marine tradition of the frescoes and vases361 although they have too many fins and curiously inverted forked tails. The same juxtaposition of octopus and paired dolphins had a long tradition in Mycenaean art, for they occur on alternate squares on the stucco pavements at Tiryns and Pylos.362 The rather crudely drawn outline fish with interior wavy lines on the kalathos VII-24 from one of the latest burials of the upper burial stratum of this tomb ally themselves more closely to the Late Eastern pictorial style, for which Minoan influence has rightly been assumed.363 Of the murex or "whorl-shell" (Mot. 23) which was one of the most popular motives in Myc. III A:2 and III B we have haonly two small scraps. No. 424 comes from a kylix decorated with vertical murex; although incomplete, the relatively full and curved whorl suggests a tran- sitional III A:2-B date rather than developed III B. No. 440, from a loop-handled krater, has the solid-tailed murex of advanced III B type.364 The infrequency of the murex pattern at Athens, where it also occurs only rarely in the Acropolis and North Slope material,365 seems to be of some significance in attempting a reconstruction of the history of Mycenaean Athens and her relations with the Argolid. 4. HISTORICAL CONCLUSIONS Despite the Athenian claim to being autochthonous,366 our study of the Agora material certainly suggests that changes or reinforcements of population took place within the two mil- lennia we have considered. The dominantly Anatolian Late Neolithic population may have 356 Desborough, L. Mycs., pl. 6 (Mouliana, Naxos and Perati). 357 M.P., pp. 192, 304. 358 Ath.

III B kylix rim), 2790 (III B tankard fragment, Fountain, p. 374, fig. 56, f), 2977 (III A kylix fragment with diagonal murex, Fountain, p. 350, fig. 24, g), 3208 (III B skyphos fragment with vertical murex). From the Acropolis one sherd only with murex is illustrated (Graef, Ant. Vasen, I, pl. VI, 201: Myc. III A kylix with horizontal murex), but several more are mentioned: nos. 89 and 91 (rim fragments of kylikes with vertical murex shells), 93 (fragment of conical rhyton), 138 (skyphos). In short, the stylistic range of the Agora material seems essentially earlier than the popularity of the murex, and the North Slope and Acropolis material by and large later. 366 Thucydides I, 2. 147</page><page sequence="165">MYCENAEAN PERIOD: INTRODUCTION remained during the Early Bronze Age, with some renewed influence from the Cyclades and from the neighboring areas to the south and north.367 Without stratified habitation layers, which are entirely absent, we cannot tell whether the new elements that characterize Lema IV (247-249; 252) were the result of infiltration or represent violent upheaval as they did at Lerna. A parallel with more near-by Eutresis36 would suggest that if there was a catastrophe at Athens, it came with the introduction of Middle Helladic culture. Although here too we are dealing not with a habitation stratum but with pottery found mostly in wells and rubbish deposits, the abundance of Minyan ware and the depth of road metal associated with this period in the central Agora support the conclusion that Athen was thickly settled and an important site for the Middle Helladic invaders. According to the best informed opinion, these people were Greek speakers and the basic substratum of the Attic language should have been introduced at this time.36 Minyan ware has been found on the Acropolis370 and, if one can judge from the continuity of Middle Helladic to Mycenaean at other acropolis sites, one may assume that the Athenian Acropolis was already chosen for a ruler's house.371 Of course, with the subsequent alterations and denudations of the rocky outcrop this conclusion must remain conjectural. We have far more evidence for the succeeding period when Athens became part of the Mycenaean world and the Acropolis the site of a Mycenaean palace, and yet here too a number of problems remain. Although there need not have been, and indeed there probably was not, any substantial change in population from Middle Helladic, Athens could not have developed as she did without considerable outside influence. In order to appraise the nature of this transformation from Middle Helladic "burg" to Mycenaean palace and citadel, one must briefly postulate certain basic premises about Mycenaean civilization as a whole. If we divide it chronologically into six critical phases,372 we may note: 1. The Shaft Grave period which overlaps Middle Helladic and runs into or through Late Helladic I. By no means characteristic of all sites, this period is mainly confined to the Argolid, where it occurs most lavishly at Mycenae in the tombs of both grave circles. However, a comparable phase seems represented in the western Peloponnesos in the earliest tholoi. Through contact with the brilliant Minoan civilization, whether by trade piracy, or exchange of population at a few centers, the simple Middle Helladic culture was sud- denly transformed, and remained under its spell for the next four hundred years. 2. The Early Palace period, beginning in Late Helladic I but especially characteristic of Late Helladic II, exemplified by Palace style pottery, by the foundation of a number of new palaces far distant from Mycenae yet culturally linked, and by the occurrence of tholos tombs for royalty and chamber tombs for aristocracy and ha toorddinary individuals. 3. The Mycenaean occupation of Knossos exemplified by the Linear B archives and a war- rior aristocracy. This period which terminated in the final destruction of Knossos as a palace seems to run from ca. 1450 to 1380 B.C. (i.e. Myc. II B-III A:1). 367 See above, pp. 20, 54. 368 Caskey, Hesperia, XXIX, 1960, pp. 285-303, especially, pp. 299-303. 389 The pre-Greek place-names such as Lykabettos, Hymettos, etc. have usually been associated with the Early Helladic stratum. See J. Haley and C. Blegen, "The Coming of the Greeks: The Geographical Distribution of Pre-Greek Place Names," A.J.A., XXXII, 1928, pp. 141ff. For a convenient summary of the latest evidence and bibliography, see Vermeule, Gr.B.A., pp. 60-64, 70-72. 370 Graef, Ant. Vasen, I, pp. Iff. (See above, p. 53, note 10.) It is probably accidental that not more was saved. 371 E.g., Mycenae, Tiryns, the Argive Heraion, Berbati and most sites in the Argolid, as well as Brauron, Thorikos and Athens in Attica. See Alin, Fundsqttten, passim. 72 For a recent appraisal of the historical phases of Mycenaean, see Vermeule, Gr.B.A. Chapters IV and V (pp. 82-155) deal essentially with our first three phases, Chapters VI and VII (pp. 156-231) with our fourth, and Chapter VIII (pp. 232- 279) with our fifth and sixth. Although not divided and designated in quite the same way, the historical implications are similar. 148</page><page sequence="166">HISTORICAL CONCLUSIONS 4. The overseas commercial expansion to Egypt, Cyprus and the Levant, which was primarily a phenomenon of the Argolid and involved the great potteries already active there. Be- ginning before the destruction of Knossos, but gaining momentum thereafter, this ex- pansion runs from the Amana period through most of the reign of Rameses II (i.e. from ca. 1400 or 1880 to 1240 or 1230 B.C.) and embraces the Myc. III A:2 and the III B (with the exception of its latest phase) pottery styles. 5. A period of retrenchment of overseas activities and concentration on construction of elaborate citadel defenses, including such features as underground cisterns within the walled fortresses to withstand siege. These activities fall primarily in the second half of the thirteenth century, and culminated in widespread destruction or abandonment of many Mycenaean sites about 1200 B.C. when the Myc. III B pottery style was giving way to III 0. 6. A period of break-up of Mycenaean civilization into regional styles with some new elements coming in. Along with some reoccupation of old sites, there were new foundations, the result of dispersal of population. This period should be dated to the first half or most of the twelfth century. Before attempting to evaluate the Athenian evidence in terms of these critical phases, a word of caution should be voiced. One must remember that our conclusions derive from an in- completely preserved record, owing to the Mycenaean levels being more disturbed at Athens than at purely "prehistoric" sites. As we have mentioned earlier, our information comes largely from two distinct sources, the Agora tombs and their pottery on the one hand, and the Acropolis architectural remains with associated pottery on the other, and these two do not completely dovetail. Furthermore, in evaluating the evidence from pottery, certain basic tenets, which result not merely from a study of Mycenaean pottery in Athens, but from other regional areas, should be formulated. Although subject to differences in interpretation,373 the following as- sumptions seem to me justified: 1. The consistent development of Mycenaean pottery through its manifold stylistic phases took place in the Argolid, and one cannot assume spontaneous origin in various centers. 2. Trade could diffuse these styles to distant regions, but unless trade relations were kept up, there would be a gap in development. Trade preferences could also affect the frequency of certain types, for example the pictorial kraters in the Levant. 8. Mycenaean colonial outposts, such as Rhodes and the northern centers we shall consider, originally imported pottery from the Argolid, and kept up the importation to some ex- tent, but gradually evolved their own local pottery styles, which were based primarily on pottery of the stage in which they were "founded." 4. Such a local pottery development could be really updated only by renewed contacts with the Argolid, in a more intimate way than by a few casual imports. What historical conclusions can we now draw for Mycenaean Athens? It seems self-evident that Mycenaean culture already evolved (one might almost say like a full-grown Athena from the head of Zeus) came to a site which was still in a dominantly Minyan Middle Helladic stage. There is no evidence for an evolutionary phase corresponding to the Shaft Grave period. Minoan 373 In general, opinions vary between those who consider the Argolid unique in creating the style and controlling its development down through the end of Myc. III B, mainly through the export of pottery (Archaeology, XIII, 1960, pp. 4-13, and Desborough, L.Mycs., pp. 217ff.) and those who see regional styles developing within Myc. III A and B. While some of the latter undoubtedly took place, it is my contention that such products can be recognized as provincial and that the full range of shapes and motives could have been created only in one center and could not have developed simultaneously in several independent regions. Recent technological studies are showing the identity of clay in vases found in Cyprus and in the Argolid, even though some scholars have considered their pictorial decoration a Cypriote creation (see H. W. Catling and A. Millett, "A Study in the Composition Patterns of Mycenaean Pictorial Pottery from Cyprus," B.S.A., LX, 1965, pp. 212-224). 149</page><page sequence="167">MYCENAEAN PERIOD: INTRODUCTION imports are negligible, and there is little indication of Mattpainted imitations of Minoan shapes and motives such as are known from Korakou, Aegina, and even Eleusis which seems to follow a different pattern from Athens.374 In fact, from our material one would conclude that Athens remained within a Middle Helladic horizon throughout the Shaft Grave period or most of the sixteenth century. There is nothing distinctively Late Helladic I from the Agora, and little or nothing from the Acropolis which must be assigned to this stage.375 Nonetheless, by the Early Palace period (our second phase), enough imported Mycenaean pottery of high quality has been found to indi- cate the establishment of a Mycenaean palace on the Acropolis,376 and additional fragments from the North Slope substantiate this conclusion.377 Nothing of this stage has been found in the Agora, but some of the earlier tombs have vases in a local style which presuppose the existence of Palace style prototypes, notably the jar with ogival canopy decoration from the Tomb of the Ivory Pyxides (1-7) and the marine-style ewer from the Ares Tomb (VII-17). Where were these early dynasts buried? Surely not in any tomb that has so far been located in the Agora, for none has material that goes back to this Myc. II A stage, and furthermore on the analogy of Argolid practice one would expect royalty to have been buried in a tholos tomb. Unfortunately, no trace of one has ever been found, and if there was one (as I think likely), it probably no longer exists, because of the intensive occupation of Athens. The likelihood of a now-vanished tholos tomb in Athens is strengthened by the fact that eastern Attica has produced three tholos tombs of this period (L.H. I-II), two at Thorikos378 and one at Marathon.379 If Athens was without a tholos, one would have to assume that she was backward in comparison with the east coast. This, however, may have been true for this period, since it seems quite likely that the early Mycenaean northern expansion was a coastal phenomenon, involving settlers making their way by sea from the Argolid or Corinthia across the Saronic Gulf and around Cape Sounion and thence into the straits of Euboia and on into the Gulf of Volo. One can plot along this route a string of early Mycenaean coastal settlements-Thorikos, Brauron, Marathon, Dramesi380 in Boiotia, Chalkis,381 and finally the harbor Neleia and the palace site Iolkos382 in 374 Our Mattpainted derivatives of Minoan shapes, e.g. 328 and 888, seem to have come second-hand through the Cyclades rather than through direct imitation of Minoan models, and their decoration is quite un-Minoan. Three sherds from the Acropolis (Graef, Ant. Vasen, I, pl. II, 27-29) with running spirals are closer to Blegen's Class B II and D I of Middle Helladic III (cf. Korakou, p. 26, fig. 36, p. 33, fig. 47, pl. II), but we have nothing that corresponds to the Keftiu cups and double axe motives of Korakou, pl. III, 4, 7, and the transitional class where Minoan shapes and motives were rendered in Mattpainted technique is completely lacking. This is not true at Aegina (Aigina, figs. 28-29) or Eleusis (lTpalcrK&amp;, 1953 [1956], pp. 77ff., 1955 [1960], pp. 67ff.) which seem to have been more in the mainstream in the Shaft Grave period. 375 I noted three sherds from the North Slope which could be Myc. I, namely A.P. 2958, 2959 and 2960 (Fountain, p. 350, fig. 24, a, f, b), of which only the last seems more likely Myc. I than II. Most of the earlier material from the Acropolis is Palace style (see below, note 376), but a few fragments may be transitional I-II A, notably the deep teacup with double axes (Graef, Ant. Vasen, I, no. 67) and fragments with "hatched loop" or "tennis racket" pattern (ibid., pl. II, 36, 39 [unillustrated]). 376 Published in Graef, Ant. Vasen, I, some of which were inspected by me in the National Museum in August, 1961. It is difficult to ascertain exactly where on the Acropolis given pieces were found. Important are the three-handled jars with bands of curved stripes or tortoise-shell ripple (ibid., no. 32; pls. II, 42, III, 71), sherds with ogival canopy pattern (ibid., pls. II, 40, III, 60), fragmentary Palace style jars with palm trees (ibid., pl. III, 57, 58), fragment with an ivy leaf (ibid., pl. II, 59), the shoulder of a large ewer comparable to the Marseilles ewer with marine decoration (ibid., pl. II, 45) and similar marine fragments (46, 47). Several have exact parallels at Mycenae cited by Graef. Iakovides (Myc. Acrop.) assigns a few walls of a single small building north of the Erechtheion to this period (L.H. I).

Most of these seem to belong to a slightly earlier horizon than is attested for Athens, and one might argue that Athens first became im- portant with the overland northern expansion to Boiotia and the foundation of the Kadmeion in Late Helladic II.383 Whether the east coast had priority or not, one certainly cannot claim Athenian synoecism or even domination of Attica in early Mycenaean times. The widespread "Mycenaeanizing" of Athens seems to have fallen in the second half of the fifteenth century, when pit graves and chamber tombs with full Mycenaean inventories and belonging to ordinary individuals are found in the Agora cemetery. These contain imported Myc. II B vases (e.g. XVI-1 and 2; VII-1, 4 and 14) as well as local imitations of II B types (e.g. some of the alabastra from the Ares Tomb, VII-2 and 3). Furthermore, the strength of the II B-III A :1 ceramic tradition in Athens is attested by the popularity and persistence of deep-bowled kylikes of Ephyraean shape, squat alabastra, pithoid jars of early form, ewers, strap-handled kraters, etc. This period coincides with our third phase of Mycenaean historical development, namely the period of the Warrior Graves and militarist dynasty at Knossos. Is it purely accidental that Athens is now drawn more fully into the mainstream of Mycenaean affairs ? The Tomb of the Ivory Pyxides is here instructive, for it belongs precisely to the period coinciding with the "last days of Knossos," and might suggest the tomb of an aristocratic "princess" whose family had been deeply involved in the affairs of the Mycenaeans at Knos- sos. While most of the pottery is clearly imported from the Argolid, certain features suggest more intimate connection with Crete at the end of Late Minoan II. This is particularly true of the tomb itself with its regular planning, symmetrical rockcut benches and floor cist with slate slab, features which are best paralleled in the rockcut Tomb of the Double Axes and the built tombs at Isopata.384 One might note furthermore the Minoan-Mycenaean eclecticism of the large ivory pyxis with its Minoan flying gallop, crested griffins, and wind-swept tree- either the work of a Mycenaean artist well-schooled in the Minoan tradition or less likely of a Minoan artist producing for a Mycenaean client. A further link binding Athens to the Argolid and to Knossos at this particular time is the practice of tin-incrusted pottery, which occurs in two fragmentary kylikes from Tomb I as well as in the full "imitation silver" service of a dozen vases from the slightly later Tomb of the Bronzes. As we have suggested elsewhere,385 this practice is especially characteristic of aristocratic tombs of the warrior elite at mainland palace sites as well as at Knossos in its latest palace period. Another parallel with this cultural milieu is furnished by the two wooden coffins recently discovered in Tomb XL; as Mrs. Ver- meule has noted, the use of coffins or larnakes has a longer and better attested tradition in Crete and traces of wooden coffins have been noted in several of the new Warrior Graves at Knossos.386 Suggestive too is the man apparently wearing a bull mask on the gold signet ring (VIII-6) from a disturbed tomb very little later than this period; to him we shall return when we consider the legendary tradition. In the period following the destruction of Knossos, our fourth phase, which saw Mycenaean overseas expansion to the Levant, Athens seems to have taken little part. We noted the in- frequency of developed Myc. III A :2 shapes such as the stirrup-jar, the straight-sided alabastron, the smaller pithoid jar, etc., shapes which form the mainstay of the Amarna koine, as well as the decorated stemmed kylikes so popular in the Argolid and Rhodes, and the Myc. III flowers and murex shells which form their characteristic ornament. While one gets occasional examples of these koine types, e.g. the pilgrim flask (III-14), the stirrup-jars (II-1 and V-3), the pithoid 383 'Apx. 'Eq., 1930, p. 32; TpaKtnK&amp;, 1929, p. 61.

II B-III A: 1. In the locally produced deep-bowled kylikes and ewers in an inferior "red wash" ware, it might really be termed "sub-III A: ." Even more rarely do we get an example of the earlier III B development, e.g. the flat-topped stirrup-vase (XXV-1) and a few kylix sherds with vertical murex design (424). If, however, one turns to Attica as a whole, the picture is radically and surprisingly different. Using the material collected by Stubbings,387 one notes a widespread distribution of chamber tomb cemeteries throughout Attica. While some of these contain pottery comparable to the earlier stage represented in the Agora (deep-bowled kylikes,388 teacups,389 strap-handled kra- ters,390 nautilus ewers391) these are concentrated at a few sites on the west coast392 and in the earlier tombs at Vourvatsi393 and Kopreza394 in the Mesogeia. But this is just the beginning of the series. Decorated kylikes of III A :2 types known from the Argolid and Rhodes are common at Vourvatsi and Pikermi395 whereas they hardly occur in Athens.396 Furthermore, the late III A:2 and early III B type with vertical murex shells and stylized flowers is relatively com- mon.397 Even more striking is the widespread distribution of stirrup-vases which run from early III A :2 down to III C.398 This fact, in conjunction with the almost complete absence of the squat or round alabastron,399 constitutes a radical difference between the Attic and Agora tomb series. In short, it appears likely that the Mycenaean expansion into central Attica took place largely in the period following the destruction of Knossos, and brought with it the style of the Myc. III A:2 koine. This, in turn, partially lapsed into local imitations (a kind of "sub-III A:2" style)400 but seems to have kept abreast of Argolid Myc. III B developments more fully than our material from the Agora would indicate.401 Thus, from the mid-fourteenth to the mid-thirteenth century, there is ample evidence for widespread Mycenaean settlement in Attica and little to indicate the overall domination of Athens. The occurrence of a tholos tomb at Menidi,402 with pottery that seems to run from Myc. III A-B, reveals that Athens tolerated a rival prince only fifteen kilometers to the north at the ancient site of Nemesis.403 And to the same period apparently belongs the triple chamber tomb at Spata404 in the eastern Mesogeia, a tomb which in its elaborate plan and wealth of ivories and other ornaments is surely not inferior to our Tomb of the Ivory Pyxides. 387 Attica, pp. 1-75. 388 Ibid., pl. 4, 4 and 6 (Vourvatsi); 6, 4 (Kopreza). 389 Ibid., pl. 8, 1-2 (Vourvatsi). 390 Ibid., pl. 10 ,1 (Vourvatsi) and 'Ep.

I feel that this took place essentially in our fifth phase. The Acropolis was the largest and most easily fortified habitation site in Attica and therefore in the period of Mycenaean retrenchment and fortification it became the citadel par excellence for this region, rivalling in the strength of its Pelasgian walls and in its enclosed area40 the citadels of the Argolid. Was this due merely to Athenian initiative or was Athens chosen as part of a central Mycenaean plan to defend the whole southeastern part of Greece north of the Isthmus from threatened attack? The parallel development of fortifications at Athens and Mycenae,46 with their specialized art of Cyclopean or "Pelasgian" masonry, projecting bastions by the main entrance, and underground secret water supplies at both sites,407 might rather indicate a kind of pan-Mycenaean strategy, with which the construction of a wall across the Corinthian Isthmus would accord.408 This latter con- clusion, that is, a master plan involving Athens, is suggested also by the suddenly renewed con- tact with the Mycenaean pottery of the Argolid in its developed Myc. III B phase, the Panel style, which, if we read the evidence correctly from the Agora and the Acropolis, abruptly up- dates the Athenian ceramic development. Admittedly, some of our material may be missing (such as a later part of the cemetery in the undug area to the north of the Athens-Peiraeus Railway), but it is hard to envisage the development of the pottery from the Fountain without assuming wholesale involvement with the affairs of the Argolid in its last period of fortification, an involvement such as had not existed since the early fourteenth century and the last days of Knossos.409 These defensive preparations were of little avail as far as the Argolid citadels are concerned. Both Mycenae and Tiryns show widespread destruction by fire at a time when Myc. III B was giving way to III C, i.e. at the end of the thirteenth century, and other sites without fortifi- cations were abandoned.410 Although Mycenae was reoccupied and experienced another catastro- phe some fifty years later in the burning of the Granary, the centralized Mycenaean palace era had essentially closed and there had begun a dispersal of population to Achaia, Kephallenia, of the tomb should go back to the early fourteenth century, if not earlier (see Furumark, C.M.P., p. 70 for two main peri- ods of use). The gold ornaments, ivory pyxis lid (B.C.H., II, 1878, pl. XIV, 1), and bronze arrowheads comprise the only Attic parallels to the objects from our Areopagus Tombs I and III and the Ares Tomb (VII). Furthermore, there are pieces of genuine pierced boar's tusks as well as glass paste imitations, and the former at least should point to an early date. However, the tomb undoubtedly continued in use well down into Myc. III B, and to this later period should be assigned the often reproduced ivory plaques and warrior head (Marinatos-Hirmer, figs. 215-216). 405 Mylonas, Myc.M.A., gives the perimeter and walled area of the three main citadels as follows: 1) Mycenae ca. 30,000 sq. m. and 900 m. perimeter (p. 16); 2) Athens ca. 25,000 sq. m. and 700 m. perimeter (p. 37); 3) Tiryns ca. 20,000 sq. m. and 725 m. perimeter (p. 11). Gla (p. 43) was much the largest with a walled area of 200,000 sq. m. and a circuit of ca. 3,000 m., but it seems to have served a different purpose from the others, "a common refuge in time of war or invasion" for the people of the Copaic basin (p. 44). This also, like Athens, seems to belong to one period, and could perhaps be construed as part of the same strategy that led to the fortification of the Acropolis and the construction of the Isthmian wall (see below, note 408). 408 Iakovides, Myc. Acrop., distinguishes three phases for the Mycenaean Acropolis with the fortification walls belonging to the third: Phase I (pp. 69-70, figs. 5-6) with a small building near the Erechtheion which he dates to L.H. I-II; Phase II with supporting walls for five terraces on which the palace was located and the northeast stairway (pp. 71-105, fig. 16) dating to Myc. III B; and Phase III (pp. 106-204, fig. 38) with the Cyclopean citadel walls, the blocking of the Postern Gate and the construction of the Fountain all placed in the later III B period, i.e. the second half of the thirteenth century. See also Broneer, Fountain, pp. 416-429 (and articles cited above, note 106), who, however, assumed an earlier stage of the citadel wall connected with the postern gate. Also Alin, Fundstdtten, pp. 99-103. 407 See above, p. 112, and note 105. Mylonas, Myc.M.A., pp. 11-45. 408 Broneer, Antiquity, XXXII, 1958, pp. 80ff.; Hesperia, XXVIII, 1959, p. 334. The fact that this wall was intended as a trans-Isthmian defense has been doubted by some: Mylonas, Myc.M.A., pp. 219-220; Vermeule, Gr.B.A., p. 264. Its intended purpose and dating to the late III B period have recently been reaffirmed by Broneer, "The Cyclopean Wall at the Isthmus of Corinth," Hesperia, XXXV, 1966, pp. 346-362, who stresses the "co-operative action implied in such an undertaking" and the probability that this was prompted by the beginning of the Dorian Invasion (pp. 357f.). 409 Although Broneer (Fountain, pp. 346ff.) has pointed out several specifically Athenian shapes (Shape 8: p. 378, fig. 59, and Shape 15: p. 384, figs. 65, 66, a), the dominant style depends upon the late Myc. III B development in the Argolid, and we have little reason to trace its organic development in Athens. 410 Desborough, L.Mycs., p. 9; lin, Fundsttten, pp. 148-150.</page><page sequence="171">MYCENAEAN PERIOD: INTRODUCTION the Aegean islands, etc. Much has been made of the fact that there is no evidence for a catas- trophe at Athens, a fact which accords with the Athenian tradition that they were never conquered during the Dorian Invasion or Return of the Herakleidai, and on which their historic claim to being "autochthonous" may be partly based.411 It is true that no burnt stratum has been found in connection with e Pelasgian walls or in the fill of the Fountain wora in the i rubbish deposits of late Mycenaean times in the Agora,412 and therefore Athens seems to have been bypassed by the people who destroyed the Myc. III B strongholds in the Argolid. For a period of perhaps fifty years, as indicated by the use of the Fountain, its collapse and gradual fill with rubbish and pottery, some of which is related to the Myc. III C style of the Argolid,413 a sizable body of Mycenaeans must have remained within the Acropolis fortifications, using first the Fountain and later Well S 27:7 which may have been situated within the Pelargikon414 as a water supply. There are so few burials in the Agora that can be assigned to this period- the six interments of the upper burial layer in Tomb VII and the two children buried in the pit grave on the Hill of the Nymphs (VI)-that one wonders whether burials may not have taken place within the walled area of the Acropolis. However, this would be contrary to Mycenaean practice, and of the fourteen cist graves mentioned by Iakovides all should apparently be as- signed to the Submycenaean period.415 Desborough has recently developed the theory of a general shift of population and wealth from Athens and western Attica to the eastern coast in the period following the destruction of Mycenaean palace culture at the end of Myc. III B.416 The cemetery at Perati with its wealthy chamber tombs has been cited as a prime example of this phenomenon, yet it is scarcely a con- tinuation of what we know for Athens in the preceding period, and it looks more like an extra- Attic foundation with strong Aegean and Rhodian ties, perhaps a kind of halfway station between the Argolid and Rhodes in the period of Myc. III C dispersal.417 At any rate, the east coast seems to have been further removed from the path of nvasion, or disturbance, than Athens and western Attica, and thus to have preserved a purer Mycenaean culture. Except for eastern Attica, Perati and the Porto Raphti Road cemetery,418 most of the Mycenaean cemeteries in Attica show a falling off of burials after Myc. III B, and support Desborough's conclusion of a general depopulation. If the Acropolis was not sacked and continued to be occupied during much of the Myc. III C period, what then was responsible for the gradual disappearance of Mycenaean culture in 411 Thucydides, I, 2, 6; 12, 4; Herodotos, V, 76. See also N. G. L. Hammond, A History of Greece to 322 B.C., 2nd ed., Oxford, 1967, pp. 83-85. 412 Although no Mycenaean habitation stratum has been found on the Acropolis, if there had been a conflagration, one would expect to find its effect upon the houses suddenly abandoned on the North Slope (Hesperia, II, 1933, pp. 351ff.) and in some of the refuse thrown into the Mycenaean Fountain following its collapse. 413 Fountain, p. 368, fig. 46, n (A.P. 2724: Close style, probably imported); p. 390, fig. 71, b, c (A.P. 2932 and 2930: Close style, probably imported); p. 370, fig. 49 (Granary style skyphoi); p. 376, fig. 57, f, g (Granary class kylikes). Broneer uses the designation L.H. III C for most of the pottery from the Fountain (ibid., pp. 416ff.) yet clearly implies that it belongs to the earlier stage "when the Granary class was just coming into vogue." Desborough (L.Myes., p. 9) uses this as evidence that the Fountain and even the houses on the North Slope should be dated after the Argolid disaster, "but not long after." However, I think this conclusion results from the difficulty in distinguishing between the construction and use fill of the Fountain on the one hand, and its dump fill on the other, and unless Close or Granary pieces can be proved for the former, such a dating seems unwarranted. 414 For the probable location of the Pelargikon below the northwest corner of the Acropolis, see Iakovides, Myc.Acrop., pp. 178-199; Mylonas, Myc.M.A., pp. 40-41. 415 Ath.

One Mycenaean palace could not survive in a rapidly changing world, especially since, as Desborough has recently suggested,419 the whole civilization had been based upon the inter- dependence of small kingdoms, each with its monarchical administration and requirements of imported raw materials, particularly metals. In this connection, the founders' hoards at Athens420 and Mycenae,421 which must be dated to Myc. III C, are symptomatic of conditions far different from the free and easy exchange of commodities in Myc. III A and B. Furthermore, if Desborough is correct in his theory that the cist grave form and the long bronze dress pins and arched fibulae found in Submycenaean burials in Athens and Salamis point to new elements from out- side the Mycenaean world proper,422 then Athens and western Attica were in the path of invaders who infiltrated during the course of the twelfth century.423 And according to the oral tradition, Athens at this time became the refuge for dispersed people, notably the Neleids from Pylos.4124 But with the disappearance of Mycenaean and the arrival of new elements, we have passed the limits of this volume. In conclusion, it is tempting to suggest a correlation of the archaeological record with the Attic tradition. We have already noted that despite the Athenian claim of being the autoch- thonous settlers of Athens there were several periods in which substantial population changes must have taken place, certainly in the Middle Helladic period, perhaps in the ruling caste in the early Mycenaean period, and again in the newcomers who were responsible for the Sub- mycenaean cist cemeteries. Yet there must have been enough continuity of settlement and culture to have encouraged the belief in an unbroken tradition, to which the legends of the earth-born kings Kekrops and Erichthonios are made to conform.425 The worship of Athena on the Acropolis is surely a legacy from Mycenaean times. A palace goddess, whose position in the Mycenaean pantheon is now assured from the a-ta-na po-ti-ni-ja of the Linear B tablets,426 she must go back to the days when the Acropolis was the site of a Mycenaean palace. Although the direct connection between the so-called megaron column bases and the Old Athena temple is no longer tenable, the megaron can hardly have been located elsewhere than on the large Mycenaean terrace which later supported the earliest temple of Athena.427 Thus, Homer's association of the "goodly house of Erechtheus" with the temple of Athena seems to have a basis of fact, and Erechtheus may therefore have been the name of one of the Mycenaean rulers.428 419 Desborough, L.Mycs., pp. 241-244, gives a good summary of the dependence of Mycenaean civilization on its palace economy. See also, Vermeule, Gr.B.A., pp. 232ff. 420 O. Montelius, La Grace pr6classique, 1924, p. 155, figs. 481-499. This hoard has been dated by Miss Sandars, A.J.A., LXVII, 1963, pp. 135ff. to the same time as the Mycenae hoards, i.e., not much before 1200. 421 'E,p. Apx., 1891, col. 25; B.S.A., XLVIII, 1953, pp. 6-7, pl. 2; Sandars, op.cit., pp. 135-136. 422 See especially Desborough, L.Mycs., pp. 231ff. 423 It has been suggested that there may have been a temporary Doric influence from these newcomers, an influence revealed by certain Doric features in the dialect before its separation into Attic and Ionic (Desborough, L.Mycs., p. 245; J. Chadwick, Greece and Rome, 1956, pp. 38ff.; Risch, Museum Helveticum, 1955, pp. 61ff.). 424 According to Hellanicus (F.Gr.H., 4 F 125) and Pherekydes (F.Gr.H., 3 F 155). J. M. Cook, C.A.H.2, II, Ch. XXXVIII, pp. 10ff. 425 Harrison, Myth. and Mons., pp. xxi-xxxvii. The fertility rites of the Arrephoroi and the close association with the caves and cult places on the North Slope might take this stratum of Attic myth back into a very remote period. Note the abundance of prehistoric material, especially Neolithic and Middle Helladic, from this area (see above, pp. 1ff., 51ff.). See also Broneer on the cult of Aphrodite in the Gardens (Hesperia, I, 1932, p. 52; Fountain, pp. 322, 428). Attic tradition dated Kekrops to the sixteenth century and ascribed a tomb to him on the Acropolis by the later Erechtheion. 426 Ventris-Chadwick, Documents in Mycenaean Greek, 1956, pp. 126-127, 311-312 (KN 208 = V 52); Morpurgo, Mycenaeae Graecitatis Lexicon, Rome, 1963, pp. 39-40. Even before the decipherment it had been suggested that the worship of Athena (a palace goddess) and the name of the city as "the town of Athena" went back to Mycenaean times (Blegen, Athenian Studies, p. 2; Nilsson, M.M.R., pp. 489-490). 427 Cf. above, notes 2 and 406. 428 Erechtheus is the Athenian king who leads the Athenian contingent of 50 ships in the Catalogue (Iliad, II, 546-556). As Homer Thompson has pointed out to me, the very fact that the Athenian contingent of fifty ships is exceeded only by the main centers of Mycenaean civilization (Argos and Tiryns, 80 ships; Mycenae, 100; Sparta, 60; Pylos, 90; etc.) suggests the importance of Mycenaean Athens whatever her role in the poems. 155</page><page sequence="173">MYCENAEAN PERIOD: INTRODUCTION This raises the difficult question of the relative unimportance of Athens in the Homeric poems, where she is relegated to a decidedly minor role, which, if the poet is accurately re- flecting Mycenaean conditions, would seem to be contradicted by the size and strength of the Mycenaean Acropolis and the wealth of the Agora cemetery.429 A possible explanation of this difficulty may be suggested by the fact that Athens' greatness lay in periods essentially out- side the narrative of the Trojan War. More frequently of late this war has been set back in the mid-thirteenth century at a time when the Mycenaean koine was intact and a common under- taking in Asia Minor would have been historically feasible,30 but we have noted little evidence that Athens took a major part in the Myc. III B koine. On the other hand, her closest associa- tions with the central Mycenaean kingdom lay in the late fifteenth to early fourteenth century (our phase 3) and again in the period of intensive fortification and siege conditions (phase 5). Are there any Athenian traditions that might reflect these periods? Despite the obviously late features of much of the Theseus saga,43 one exploit takes him back into the earlier My- cenaean period. His Cretan expedition and slaying of the Minotaur, if based on historical fact, must surely be set in the period before the destruction of the great Late Minoan II palace in the early fourteenth century42 instead of at the later date assigned Theseus in Athenian tradition.3 Unfortunately, there is little to indicate Minoan suzerainty over Attica or Athens in the fifteenth century, or indeed at any time, and such control seems implicit in the story with its tribute of Athenian youths and maidens. The only two certain Minoan vases of the period that have have been found, one at Varkisa on the coast, the other on the South Slope of the Acropolis in a Mycenaean context,34 seem much more tokens of trade than conquest. However, even if we deny the tribute part of the story, we must admit that Athens seems to have been closely associated with the Mycenaean warrior aristocracy that was in control of Knossos during the last days of the palace. We have noted similarities in tomb forms and burial practices, such features as the rockcut benches and slab-covered cist of Tomb I, the wooden coffins of Tomb XL, the swords and tin-incrusted pottery of Tomb III. May these features not admit the possibility of an Athenian "Theseus" at Knossos who returned to Athens with new wealth and new ideas around the turn of the century.435 Although the Theseus connections of the gold signet ring (VIII-6) have generally been denied since they were first proposed by Shear,36 it is indeed curious that the only representation of a male ministrant wearing a bull-mask37 should occur on a Mycenaean ring from Athens if it does not recall some memory of Cretan rites which in turn gave rise to the legend of the bull-headed Minotaur. 429 Blegen, Athenian Studies, p. 1; C. Whitman, Homer and the Heroic Tradition, 1958, pp. 46ff. and note 2 with reference to Homeric scholarship on the difficulties implicit in the passages referring to Athens. 430 See Desborough, L.Mycs., pp. 248-249. Also Blegen's earlier date for the fall of Troy (ca. 1250 or even as early as 1270 B.C.: C. W. Blegen, "The Mycenaean Age," Cincinnati, 1962, pp. 15, 27-28) which seems too early to some. Cf. Vermeule, Gr.B.A., pp. 277ff. and Mylonas, Myc.M.A., pp. 215ff. 431 As a kind of Attic Herakles, Theseus must have acquired many of his exploits in the period following the great invasions of the twelfth century, a period which projected Herakles as the Dorian hero par excellence. See Desborough, L.Mycs., pp. 246ff. 432 M.P. Nilsson, The Mycenaean Origin of Greek Mythology, 1932, p. 180; Blegen, Athenian Studies, p. 3; S. Dow, "The Greeks in the Bronze Age," Xle Congres internationale des sciences historiques, Stockholm, 1960, pp. 12ff. all put this exploit in the period before the destruction of the L.M. II palace and in the period of Minoan thalassocracy. For an opposing position which would make the myth post-Mycenaean, see G. E. Mylonas, "Athens and Minoan Crete," Athenian Studies, pp. 11-36, especially pp. 22ff. 433 The traditional date of Theseus is one generation before the Trojan War, he having been driven into exile by Menestheus, Agamemnon's ally, but there exists the strong probability of two Theseus's, the earlier one being coeval with the Minos dated by the Marmor Parium to 1487 (Eratosthenes 1407), see J. L. Myres, Who Were the Greeks?, Berkeley, 1930, pp. 325ff. 434 See above, pp. 113 and 119, notes 111 and 142. However, although tribute could be enacted without conquest, it seems surprising that Athens which plays the dominant role in this tale of Cretan control shows fewer signs of Minoan contact than the Argolid or Messenia. 435 This Athenian contact with Knossos cannot, however, be put back in the period of the Minoan thalassocracy (see above, note 432) but would apparently have been made during the period in which the Mycenaean Greeks were in control. 436 See above, p. 107, note 77. 43? See above, p. 107, note 79. 156</page><page sequence="174">HISTORICAL CONCLUSIONS For the other period of close involvement, that of the intensive fortification of the Acropolis in the later thirteenth century, Athenian tradition recalled that the walls were built by the Pelasgians, a foreign race of skilled artificers who were rewarded with a piece of land at the foot of Hymettos for the service they had rendered.438 For the Classical Athenians, however, the name Pelasgian seems to have been equated loosely with anything very ancient and partic- ularly with the older Aegean stock, and therefore its association with the Mycenaean fortifica- tion is not particularly helpful. But according to another tradition439 the walls were considered the work of giants, a tradition that agrees more closely with the legend of the Cyclopes building the walls at Tiryns and Mycenae.440 Clearly there is no difference in appearance between Pelasgian and Cyclopean masonry, both being made of superhumanly large boulders, but otherwise the Classical tradition is not helpful in relating the fortifications to a historic phase of Mycenaean civilization. With the Athenian tradition of Kodros,441 the last Athenian king and Neleid refugee from Pylos who sacrificed himself by the Ilissos to spare Athens from the Dorians, we are clearly at the end of the gradual break-up and dispersal of Mycenaean civilization, perhaps as late as the eleventh century. 488 Herodotos VI, 137. 439 The Athenians of the Classical period seem also to have had an alternative tradition that the so-called Pelasgian walls had been built by giants; see the red-figured skyphos in the Louvre (G 372) by the Penelope Painter (Beazley, A.R.V.2, pp. 1300-1301; Jahrb., LV, pp. 149-152) which shows Athena and a giant shouldering a large boulder (his name riya in- scribed) with the overseer Philyas. This has been interpreted as Athena commanding the building of the Pelasgian wall on the Acropolis. See also Harrison, Prim. Athens, pp. 22-23, figs. 10-11. 440 Pausanius, II, 16, 5; 25, 8. 441 Pausanius, I, 19, 6. 157</page><page sequence="175">CATALOGUE 1. DESCRIPTION OF TOMBS AND CATALOGUE OF OBJECTS THE TOMBS ON THE NORTH SLOPE OF THE AREOPAGUS (I-IV). This group consists of four large chamber tombs cut into the northeast slope of the Areopagus (see Plan, P1. 79). Although two (Tombs II and IV) had been badly disturbed and yielded relatively fragmentary and poor offerings, the parallel alignment of the dromoi of all four and the relative contemporaneity of offerings suggest that they were part of one complex to be dated soon after 1400 B.C. and comprising the burial places for aristocratic or "princely" persons. Probably the cemetery originally consisted of more tombs, all traces of which have been lost in the subsequent re-use of the area. It is here that one might suspect the location of a tholos tomb, long since destroyed.1 TOMB I: TOMB OF THE IVORY PYXIDES (N 21-22:1) Pls. 29-83, 65, 67, 75, 77; Plan, P1. 80 Hesperia, IX, 1940, pp. 274-291. By far the largest and wealthiest of the Agora chamber tombs, Tomb I was the first to be discovered more or less intact. Coming to light in May, 1939, it was excavated during the fol- lowing month by Eugene Vanderpool and received a preliminary publication by T. Leslie Shear in his Annual Report. The discovery received wide publicity, and it is thus the best known of the Agora tombs.2 Although typical in its chronological range of material, it is exceptional in size, architectural form, and quality of offerings. Furthermore, it offers well-nigh insoluble problems in the reconstruction of its history and that of the occupant whose body was not recovered. The tomb (Plan, P1. 80) was approached by a long dromos, at least 11 meters in length, run- ning from north to south, with walls tapering lightly inward, with a width ranging from 2.0 m. at the bottom to 1.50 m. at the top.3 The dromos had been cut at the north end by a late Roman wall; it contained a filling of earth undisturbed since Mycenaean times, except at the north end where a Geometric grave (N 21:6)4 had been sunk into its upper part and two pits had been dug in the Turkish period (PI. 29, a). At the south end the dromos, which sloped down- ward and widened slightly, led to a doorway 1.20 m. wide and 2.40 m. deep, which had been 1 See also p. 150, and note the location of the tholos tomb at Dendra in a necropolis of wealthy chamber tombs (N. T.D., p. 18, fig. 17), one of which has many features in common with our Tomb I (see below). 2 I.L.N., July 22, 1939; A.J.A., XLIII, 1939, pp. 578-586, figs. 3-16; J.H.S., LIX, 1939, pp. 189-190, fig. 1, pl.

This wall was 1.40 m. thick and was set in the outer face of the stomion. It was preserved to its entire height and, in the excavator's opinion, had never been opened. The large rectangular chamber (5.90 m. wide by 4.80 m. deep) was set at a slight angle to the dromos. The roof of the chamber had collapsed in the Mycenaean period, presumably because its height approached too closely the highest point of firm bedrock (see section, P1. 80). The chamber was largely filled with broken pieces of bedrock, but also on the west side with some heavy boulders of limestone placed near the top of a crude wall. This extraneous material must have been introduced after the roof had collapsed, but still fairly early in the Mycenaean period because of the fragmentary kylix (1-15; P1. 31) and sherds of several other similar ones found in the fill. The maximum preserved height of the chamber was 2.75 m., and a small portion of the northwest corner suggested that the roof was not horizontal, but rose slightly toward the center with a gently hipped effect (see Model, P1. 30).5 A rockcut bench, 0.75 m. wide and 0.60 m. high, extended along each side wall, that on the east holding the best preserved funeral offerings, the vases I-1 to 6 and the large ivory pyxis, 1-16. The vases had been crushed by the collapse of the roof, but had not been subsequently disturbed, and it was possible to fix their positions with certainty (P1. 29, d). It seems likely that the western bench was also the repository of offerings (1-9 to 12), but here they have suffered much more disturbance. Other offerings in their original position were the large pithoid jar (1-7) and the Canaanite amphora (1-8) leaning against the north wall to the east of the door- way, and the bronze "ladle" or lamp (1-22) lying on the floor near the door (P1. 29, c). Beside the West Bench in the southwest corner of the chamber was a deep cist grave cut into bedrock; it measured 1.80 m. by 0.60 m. by 1.20 m. deep (P1. 29, f). This had been originally covered by a slate slab, which was found in a diagonal position beside the grave, having been lifted and shoved to one side (P1. 29, e). The grave contained neither bones nor offerings, except for one small scrap of gold (J 79, perhaps of the type represented by 1-25). A group of offerings, probably from the cist, was found on the floor beside the cover of the grave. These consisted of the bronze mirror (1-23), a set of ivory pins (1-19), two ivory hair ornaments (1-18), a small ivory pyxis (1-17), and copper wire (from a balance?, 1-24). As Shear pointed out, these feminine articles prove that the burial was that of a woman. The other offerings consisted of 128 ornaments of thin gold sheet, of several different types (1-25 to 29) found mostly heaped together in three groups near the north end of the grave. Most of these have small holes per- forated along the edges, presumably for attachment to the shroud. They had apparently been collected for removal from the tomb, but were then abandoned near the cover. The only other evidence from the chamber consisted of fragments of carbonized wood and ash found near the center and running in part down into the grave cutting, and a few scraps of bone and canine-looking teeth found near the pile of offerings by the cist (1-17 to 19, 23-24). Since these are not human,6 they suggest either the remnants of a sacrifice or a funeral meal.7 However, the ash pile was disturbed and somewhat scattered at the time the cover slab was moved, and one fragmentary vase (1-9), of which a joining sherd came from the West Bench, was found in the ash pile but without traces of burning. There is a real enigma presented by this handsome tomb, since there is no trace of the oc- cupant who had been provided with these costly offerings. The tomb has clearly been disturbed and the cist opened, the body apparently removed but much of value left behind. The excavator 5 An attempt was made to reconstruct the roof of the chamber and doorway, but this was only partially successful and the tomb was again filled with earth in July, 1953, as the best means of preserving it. The scale model in the Agora Museum gives a good idea of its appearance. 6 See above, p. 102, note 38. 7 See above, p. 102, notes 39-40. 159</page><page sequence="177">MYCENAEAN PERIOD: CATALOGUE concluded that the tomb was used only once, for the burial of a woman, and that soon after, before another interment could take place, the roof collapsed. This occasioned re-entry from above by a trench dug exactly over the site of the cist grave for the specific purpose of removing the body and offerings from the cist to another tomb, "an act of family piety." Presumably the offerings on the East Bench were already sealed off by the fall of rock, and the pile of small objects by the cist was perhaps abandoned in haste when further collapse of the roof threatened. Then the hole was filled with earth, split bedrock and heavy chunks of limestone, which effectively sealed off the tomb from later pillagers. The date is indicated by the fragmentary kylikes (I-16 and other fragments) found in this fill. Ingenious and romantic as is the theory proposed by the excavator, it is perhaps not the only solution, for it does not seem completely consistent with what we know of Mycenaean burial practices elsewhere and with certain other evidence from the tomb, particularly the dromos. Clearly the tomb had been re-entered from above and the body removed, perhaps also with valuable jewelry and gold cups from the cist grave, not necessarily an act of piety but pos- sibly of avarice, although most cases of tomb-robbing took place in the post-Mycenaean period.8 But was this the only time the tomb had been entered since the original interment? In the excavator's opinion the dromos had never been reopened. Certainly the blocking wall of the doorway was intact and shows no clear evidence of rebuilding, but this does not prove that it could not have been rebuilt from the bottom up, as seems to have been the earlier practice.9 Apparently the dromos revealed no clear stratification, but it did contain a sizable quantity of significant sherd material which can be divided into the three classes of dromos material described by Wace and Blegen:10 earlier material in the soil through which the dromos was cut,11 fragments of broken kylikes and other pottery used by the funeral party in drinking a farewell toast,12 and fragmentary larger vases which may once have stood in the chamber and have been swept out at the time of a later interment. To this last class the two handsome vases, a large pithoid jar with reticulated shoulder zone (I-13) and a strap-handled krater with nautilus decoration (1-14), seem to belong, especially as in each case a fragment was found in the chamber in the area of the West Bench. However, these are not appreciably, if at all, earlier than the material from the East Bench. Possibly they were part of the equipment of the original and only burial and were broken either accidentally or ritually during the funeral, and were then swept out during a tidying up of the tomb before the dromos was filled in.13 Our knowledge of Mycenaean funeral rites may be defective on this point, and the assumption of more than one burial only compounds the difficulty of no skeletal remains. As to the likelihood of the body being removed to another tomb when the roof collapsed, here too our understanding of Mycenaean practice may be inadequate. Attention has been 8 It might be argued that the body had been richly bedecked with gold jewelry comparable to that from the burial cist of Tomb 10 at Dendra (N. T.D., pp. 74ff., reconstruction, fig. 105; pls. III-V) and that what was left behind seemed insignificant in comparison. Removal of valuable objects by members of the family is assumed by most scholars, e.g. Wace (Ch. T., p. 145), Blegen (Prosymna, I, p. 247), and Mylonas (Myc.M.A., p. 113), but this is somewhat different from the systematic tomb looting of post-Mycenaean times. 9 Wace concluded for the chamber tombs at Mycenae that the earlier practice was to dig out the dromos and unblock the doorway completely (Ch.T., pp. 132-133), whereas later the shorter expedient of digging out the dromos in front of the doorway to a depth of ca. 1.50 m. and removing only the upper part of the blocking wall was used. The latter practice leaves a clear stratification in both dromos and blocking wall, such as was noted by Persson at Dendra in Tombs 8, 9 and 10 (N. T.D., figs. 37-39, 54-57, 66-70). 10 Ch. T., pp. 130-131; Prosymna, I, pp. 237-238. 1 Several Gray Minyan sherds, some coarse ware, and one Red Burnished sherd uncatalogued and in storage container. 12 Several fine rim fragments from kylikes, undecorated in smooth polished yellow-buff fabric; rim fragment from shallow bowl with ribbon handle like III-11, but with no traces of tin. 13 For the Royal Tomb at Dendra Persson assumed a ritual breaking and smashing of the stirrup-vase, fragments of which were found in three pits in the chamber as well as in the dromos (R. T.D., p. 70, fig. 46). For the fragmentary vases 8, 6 and 9, with part of the last found in the dromos, all three of which were associated with the first burials in Tomb XL, see E. Vermeule, Hesperia, XXXV, 1966, p. 67. 160</page><page sequence="178">TOMBS AND OBJECTS: TOMB I focused, particularly by Mylonasl4 on the absence in Mycenaean times of a cult of the dead, or even of much respect for the bones of a relative, since a common practice in chamber tombs was to sweep aside previous interments or cram them into bone pits. However, the same author emphasizes the importance of funeral rites and the provision of the deceased with what he would need, either symbolically or actually, in the way of food and drink, for the journey to the other world which presumably lasted as long as the flesh had not decomposed. Only, I think, if the roof of our tomb collapsed almost immediately after the burial would the removal of the body as an act of family piety be consistent with what we know of Mycenaean funeral practices. Interestingly enough, there are other cases where skeletal material is lacking or inadequate to account for the apparent number of burials.15 One of these was the wealthy Chamber Tomb 10 at Dendra, a tomb which has many points of similarity with ours and belongs in part to the same chronological stage.16 Here, although the blocking wall shows clearly two periods of construction and the filling of the stomion was stratified with two layers of charcoal, only one body was discovered. Persson believed that only one burial took place, despite the range of time that seems indicated between the burial gifts in the chamber and the fragmentary Palace style jar in the dromos,l7 and he suggested that the tomb was opened either for a subsequent burial that did not take place because the roof had already begun to collapse or, on the analogy of the Agora Tomb, to remove the dead to another tomb.18 In any case, the tomb there was sur- rounded with a rectangular wall at ground level, suggesting a continuing respect for the area.19 Persson inclined to the view that Tomb 10 was a Royal Tomb,20 and Shear voiced the same opinion with regard to our tomb, even going so far as to associate it with the wife or daughter of Erechtheus.21 Both tombs are clearly more than ordinary chamber tombs, and the wealth of jewelry and cups of precious metal at Dendra are comparable to finds in tholoi, yet there was also a royal tholos tomb at Dendra as part of the same cemetery and in use concurrently with Tomb 10, and I suspect that the same conditions would be found to have prevailed at Athens if our evidence were more complete. In my opinion one should consider these tombs those of wealthy noble families, and reserve the term "royal" for the beehive or tholos type.22 Although we may never know the full history of our tomb or who its original occupant was, one should not minimize its importance as one of the finest chamber tombs ever discovered. Architecturally, with its symmetrical rockcut benches and deep burial cist with a single cover- ing slab it has no close parallels on the mainland, but is reminiscent rather of some of the tombs at Knossos in the last palatial age,23 and to this period the evidence of the pottery, ivories and other objects points. The pottery belongs almost entirely to Furumark's Myc. III A:1 stage (before the destruction of Knossos), good examples being the jars (1-2 and 3) and the alabastra (1-5 and 6) from the East Bench, all of which have almost exact duplicates in Tomb 10 at Dendra. The nautilus jar (I-1) may be slightly earlier, transitional from Myc. II to III A:l, and the local jar with 14 Mylonas, Myc. M.A., pp. 113, 178ff. 15 See Blegen on the absence of the remains of any "last" burial in eight tombs at the Argive Heraion, in which there seems to have been no later molestation (Prosymna, I, p. 249).

Likewise the large ivory pyxis (1-16) may be a work of the late fifteenth century, and the ivy leaf on the gold ornaments (1-25) is paral- leled on jewelry from tombs of the late fifteenth to early fourteenth century. The same is true of the use of tin-incrustation on the kylikes (I-11 and 12), a practice found in Tomb 10 at Dendra and in our neighboring Tomb III, as well as at Knossos, Mycenae and lalysos. Therefore a date of close to 1400 B.C. seems likely. See also pp. 97-102, 151. Myc. III A:1. POTTERY VASES ON EAST BENCH (I-1 to 6; Pls. 30, 65, 67) I-1. Three-handled Jar with Nautili. P1. 30.

Grace, "The Canaanite Jar," The Aegean and the Near East, pp. 80-109, pl. IX, 1, 4, fig. 5, 3. H. 0.58 m., D. 0.325 m., capacity, 22,575 cc. Pointed amphora mended from many pieces; fragments of mouth and body missing. Coarse clay containing numerous small pebbles; it has fired gray except at surface where it is various shades of buff; no glaze or decoration. Round mouth with torus lip; short neck flowing in- to broad sloping shoulder; body tapers downward to a blunt point at bottom. Two vertical handles, round in section, on upper part of body. On top of handle to left in photograph is an incised mark. Furumark (M.P., p. 74) correctly recognized the foreign manufacture of such jars, but illustrates only the later form (fig. 21, Type 13a), and is uncertain as to the place of manufacture, preferring Syria or southern Anatolia to Egypt (Pendlebury, Aegyptiaca, pp. 56, 76), because of the presumed Minoan signs incised on the handles of some examples. Miss Grace has shown definitively the Canaanite origin of such jars which were introduced from Canaan to Egypt in the Eighteenth Dynasty and also imported to Aegean sites. She has subdivided them into two groups: an earlier form of the late 15th to 14th century, to which our example belongs, and a later form with more angular shoulder of the 13th century. The closest parallel to our jar in the Aegean area is the one imported to Argos and found in an early Mycenaean tomb (Tomb VI, B.C.H., XXVIII, 1904, pp. 375-387 and Grace, op.cit., pp. 101-102, pl. IX, 2), and the same form is shown as an offering brought by Syrian princes in the fifteenth century Tomb of Rekhmara (Grace, op.cit., p. 85, fig. 2 b). In discussing the incised handle marks, Miss Grace remarks that they were mostly scratched before firing and that although they have a few parallels in Minoan and Cypriote scripts, they are not in Linear B. She concludes: "On the whole, the Semitic parallels seem the most important" (op.cit., p. 88). For discussion of sign on handle of our vase see op.cit., p. 101.

H. over all 0.16 m., H. of lid 0.013 m., D. lid 0.11 m. Broken and split into many pieces, but largely com- plete; one side slightly higher than other. A cylindrical box, cut from section of a tusk and tapering very slightly toward top, as tusk narrowed. Flat lid is held in place by projecting central disc which fits down inside wall of box. Bottom is made in two superimposed parts, one providing actual floor of the box, the other, fastened to first by ivory pegs, is a separate piece which provides a base for the whole. Traces of a metal lining, analyzed as tin, were found inside box. Carved decoration in fairly high relief. Lid shows a crested griffin to right, tearing two small deer who lie prone, one with legs doubled up, the other with legs extended. On wall of pyxis two similar crested griffins, one facing right, one left, attack four deer, two large and two small. Considerable indications of landscape background: windswept tree beneath griffin facing left and patches of rockwork. Close under rim, two pairs of horizontal lug-like handles, pierced ver- tically, formed by bodies of crouching animals, a lion and a fawn, the lions seen from above; one pair fairly complete, the other fragmentary. Border dec- oration at top and bottom consists of foliate band, the opposite row of leaves carved in one case on the side of the lid, in the other on the side of the false bottom. One of the finest carved Mycenaean ivories ever found on the Greek mainland, this pyxis is an excel- lent example of the style of the late fifteenth to early fourteenth century. Shear's brilliant description of the scene (Hesperia, IX, 1940, pp. 284-285) cannot be improved, for he has captured the breathless and turbulent quality of the attack: "the wind produced by the rush of great wings that has blown over a small tree or shrub seen below the animal." Mrs. Vermeule writes "No other Mycenaean ivory matches this in its controlled organization of savagery and agony, the simple power of the bodies, the subtle use of landscape like the tree overblown in the rush of the griffin's leap." Miss Kantor notes the essentially Minoan inspira- tion of the scene (winged griffin of Cretan type, flying gallop, tree and rockwork) but notes the trans- lieves signifies a mainland artist. The new pyxis from Katsaba, Crete (B.C.H., LXXXVII, 1964, p. 846, fig. 3) with the capture of a wild bull in a rocky landscape might be taken as indicative of the earlier more purely Minoan style. One feature of our pyxis seems at variance with Minoan and Mycenaean art and perhaps a direct bor- rowing from the East. This is the use of couchant lions seen from above for handles in contrast to the profile view in the fawns which thereby become much more a part of the overall relief composition. No one has called attention in print to this peculiarity, but years ago Mary H. Swindler' compared them to the ivory lions used as attachments on later Etruscan situlae and boxes (Bernardini Tomb: M.A.A.R., III, pp. 61ff., pl. 38, 5, 6; Barberini Tomb: M.A.A.R., V, p. 34, pl. 17) and a long oriental tradition seems likely, though it is not necessarily a valid argument for manufacture outside the Aegean area. Shear considered the possibility of an Attic origin because of the evidence for a local school provided by the many carved ivories found at Spata and Menidi. These, however, need not have been locally produced but seem rather to belong to the inter- national style of the thirteenth century (cf. Kantor, op.cit., p. 22, fig. 13 from Spata). The closest parallels to the Agora pyxis seem to be furnished by some poorly preserved pyxides found by Tsountas at Mycenae ('Eyp. 'Apx., 1888, pl. 8, especially no. 6 from Tomb 27 with griffin attacking contorted bull). Some of these are on display in the Mycenaean room of the National Museum and will be the subject of a special study by Mrs. Agnes Sakellariou. In our opinion this pyxis was made at some major metropolitan center, either at Knossos during the period of Mycenaean control or in the Argolid at a time probably shortly before the fall of Knossos. The ivory tusk was, of course, imported from the East, and with the commercial contacts this implies may have come not only the idea of carving ivory pyxides from a section of tusk but also of equipping them with handles in the form of couchant lions.

The plain flat bars of both barrettes are preserved, that of a, the longer, rounded at one end and squared off at the other; that of b rounded at both ends and with a shallow depression as if for a finger hold on the under side, near one end. The pins, much mended and in both cases broken at both ends, consist each of a long piece, oval in section for most of the preserved length, but flattened at one end and curving around to form a sharp hook, projecting beyond the line of the bar. The outer edge of the pin on a is serrated, and the serrations continue around the edge of the hook part. A similar serrated piece appears to belong to b. Nothing of any catch at the opposite end is pre- served, nor is it clear how bar and pin were joined together; c is a plain rounded fragment of a pin perhaps from a similar hair ornament. Bone or ivory. No exact counterparts to these have been found elsewhere, nor is the mechanism altogether clear.

A slight sinking at the center of the bowl makes a small flat, slightly offset, bottom. Analyzed as almost pure copper. Although referred to as a "ladle" in the original publication and associated with the large vases (1-7 and 8) that stood near by, it seems more likely that this was a lamp, the small channel opposite the handle being designed to support the wick. Its position near the doorway seems appropriate. Cf. similar bronze lamps from Tombs 2 and 8 at Dendra, the latter also found just inside doorway (R.T.D., pp. 94-95, pl.

Cf. the bronze scale-pans found in tombs at the Argive Heraion (Prosymna, I, pp. 351-352; II, fig. 215, 6, 7) which must have come from a larger and more complicated balance.

Cf. also discussion by Persson, N.T.D., p. 73. GOLD ORNAMENTS One hundred twenty-eight ornaments and frag- ments of thin gold leaf were found. These were con- centrated in the northwest part of the chamber, along the West Bench, on the floor near the slab (area of the small ivory pyxis), with a few scattered elsewhere. They fall into five main types: a large drop-shaped ornament decorated with an ivy leaf (1-25), a shell- shaped ornament with a small rosette in the center (I-26), a large disc with rosette (1-27), a small disc with rosette (1-28), and a plain gold disc (I-29). Furthermore there were twenty-five fragments of gold leaf which were either plain or so badly crumpled and bent that their original shape could not be deter- mined.

TOMB II: DISTURBED TOMB WITH CIST GRAVE (N 21:5) Pls. 34, 75; Plan, P1. 79 Hesperia, IX, 1940, p. 291. During the same campaign which yielded the Tomb of the Ivory Pyxides, a smaller and badly disturbed chamber tomb was discovered about 15 meters to the west. The chamber was apparently hemispherical, very roughly hewn with a diameter estimated at ca. 3.0 m.; it was also approached from the north, although nothing remained of the dromos. A cist grave (P1. 34, a) of about the same dimensions as that in Tomb I (1.90 m. by 0.75-0.90 m. by 1.30 m. deep) had been cut in the floor of the chamber, but had been used as the overflow of a modern cesspool. Furthermore a Roman tile drain had cut away a large part of the original rock. Ac- cordingly, the only remains from the original tomb were found in a small pocket close to the south wall (PI. 34, b); these consisted of some pieces of thigh and leg bones and fragments of four pots (11-1 to 4), including a nearly complete stirrup-vase (II-1, Pls. 34, 75). Although the pottery is fragmentary and a little later than that from Tomb I, it is of good Myc. III A style, and shows that the tomb was in use during the earlier fourteenth century. The fact that a packing of rough stones was found in connection with the vases and that the incomplete skeletal remains lay above them might suggest a small walled ossuary where earlier remains had been deposited at the time of a subsequent interment. The deep cist grave would indicate the burial of a person of importance. See also pp. 97, 101. 169</page><page sequence="187">MYCENAEAN PERIOD: CATALOGUE II-1. Stirrup-vase. Pls. 34, 75. P 15070.

This large chamber tomb was discovered in the spring of 1947, lying 15 meters northwest of Tomb I, and was excavated by Eugene Vanderpool. It received a careful preliminary publi- cation in the Annual Report,' and has been the basis of a special study of an unusual class of Mycenaean vases covered with tinfoil.2 1 See also A.J.A., LI, 1947, p. 270, pl.

It was approached by a dromos from the north, which was preserved for a length of only 3.80 m. (P1. 34, c). Measuring 2.0 m. wide at the bottom, the dromos walls were preserved to a maximum height of ca. 1.60 m. and showed an appreciable inward inclination. The floor sloped downward to the doorway which was 0.88 m. wide and was found closed with a rough stone blocking wall. Since the roof of the chamber had collapsed in Mycenaean times, the burials and offerings were found intact, although the area had been much used in Roman and modem times. The tomb contained three burials, which to judge from the style of the pottery must have taken place over a relatively short span of time. The heap of bones near the west wall represents the earliest burial (A);3 associated with them were three pots (III-1, 2, and 3) with another three (111-4, 5 and 6) in a compact group perhaps representing a supplementary offering. The second and third burials (P1. 35, a) were each represented by an orderly skeleton stretched out at full length on its back with hands folded across the abdomen, that designated B along the south or back wall of the chamber with head at the east apparently a woman.4 Associated with this burial were seven vases that lay near the head (III-7 to 13). The third burial (C),5 that of a man lying along the east wall of the chamber with his head toward the south (P1. 35, b), received the most costly offerings: a long bronze sword (III111-17), a dagger (II111-18), razor (III-19) and bowl (III-20), all of bronze, which had been placed on a wooden table at the side of the body. Evidence for the table consisted of the stain of decayed wood and traces of blue pig- ment;6 perhaps also the ivory inlays (III-21) came from this table. Since both these skeletons were found in perfect order, they must have been buried in rapid succession. The large three-handled pithoid jar (III-15), which contained the remains of a sacrificial pyre, and the pilgrim flask (111-14) found near the middle of the chamber, as well as the small bowl (III-16) from the west side of the entrance, cannot be assigned to a specific burial, but presumably reached the tomb, or were moved,7 at the time of one of the later burials. Near the middle of the floor, and probably to be associated with Burial B, were nine steatite but- tons (111-23). Thirty-eight thin gold rosettes (111-22), of which thirty-two lay in a compact group at the base of the wall near the feet of Burial C,8 and some gold rivet heads and a gold strip to be associated with the sword and dagger comprise the other offerings of this tomb, which of the Agora Tombs is second in wealth only to the Tomb of the Ivory Pyxides. Of the pottery only three pieces bore painted decoration (III-3, 14 and 15). The majority of vases were undecorated kylikes of four different types, shallow handleless bowls, bowls with horizontal ribbon handles, a ewer and a large undecorated pithoid jar. Although the kylikes in particular are elegant in shape, the surface is almost without exception rough and unpolished and preserves patches of black incrustation adhering to a whitish substance. Samples taken from ten of the undecorated vases and analyzed spectrographically by Marie Farnsworth9 revealed pure tin oxide and showed that they had originally been covered with tinfoil in imitation of and as a cheaper funeral substitute for silver vases. The same practice was ap- 3 AA 41 a: analyzed by J. Lawrence Angel as male (?) and about 55 (?). 4 AA 40: Angel's notes "female, about 36." 5 AA 41: "male, about 43." 6 See the discussion of blue in connection with coffins (Vermeule, Hesperia, XXXV, 1966, p. 71). For the rejection of the idea that the traces of wood in Tomb III constituted the remnants of a coffin like those recently discovered in Tomb XL, see above, p. 101. 7 Stylistically the pithoid jar with the remnants of the pyre is the earliest vase in the tomb. See below under III-15. 8 The excavator believed these might have fallen from a cloak hung from a peg in the wall (Hesperia, XVII, 1948, p. 157). For the use of such rosettes to decorate the actual funeral garment or shroud, see above p. 108. 9 Hesperia, XXXV, 1966, Appendix II, p. 396. 171</page><page sequence="189">MYCENAEAN PERIOD: CATALOGUE parently in use in wealthy chamber tombs at Mycenae, Dendra, the Argive Heraion, lalysos and Knossos at a period contemporaneous with our tomb.10 The painted vases, however, form the best chronological index, particularly the pilgrim flask (I11-14). As has been pointed out,l1 it is closely paralleled in- the sherds from Tell el Amarna in Egypt, which can be dated to the second quarter of the fourteenth century.12 Since it seems to belong to one of the later burials, it would imply a date of the first half of the fourteenth century for the whole tomb, extending down perhaps a generation later than Tomb I. The apparent Myc. III A :1 date of the jar with the remnants of the sacrificial pyre (111-16) and the close resemblance in shape of the ewer (111-1) to the glazed example (1-4) show that the interval between the two tombs cannot have been great.

B.M.Cat., I, 2, C 561, pl. III), the pilgrim flask is also found in the Argolid (Prosymna, I, p. 442, pl. VIII, 859; II, figs. 706-707) and in Attica (Attica, pl. 16, 5-6; Collignon-Couve, pl.

Neck, foot and handles glazed; in shoulder zone in each panel a curved-stemmed ivy leaf and a palmette on a curved stem with a papyrus blossom in angle (P1. 76); two broad bands framed above and below by a narrow line between shoulder zone and deep band of glaze on foot. Furumark, M.P., Type 19 (p. 22, fig. 3), Myc. III A:1; Mots. 12: 27 (p. 271, fig. 36), Myc. III A:1; 11: 66 (p. 265, fig. 34). No exact parallel for the palmette but probably closest to Mot. 14: 8 (p. 277, fig. 38), Myc. III A:2. Cf. the palm and ivy leaf on the jar Prosymna, II, fig. 246, and on the alabastron, C.V.A., Br. Mus. IIIa, pl. 10, 32, which may be from Attica (notation of A. J. B. Wace). In shape and decoration this jar is only a little later than the large jars, I-1 and 2. The neck is slightly higher, the plastic ridge gone, and the handles less metallic. The decorative zone is less deep, but the relative naturalism of its motives suggests an earlier date than the formalism of the Amarna style, represented by III-14. It therefore seems likely that III-15 should be associated with an earlier burial and that it was moved to its position by the door- way when used to gather up the remnants of a sacrificial pyre, probably in connection with Burial C. The material found within the jar consisted of char- coal, pieces of vitrified pottery, a small scrap of blackened bone or ivory, and three other fragments of bone from a small animal. This is our only instance of a vase with its contents preserved, here surely secondary. See also pp. 102, 120, 144, Myc. III A: 1. III-16. Shallow Bowl without Handles, Tinned. P1. 35. P 17762.

B 779, a small chunk of bronze with gold disc, found near left elbow of Burial C; D. 0.011 m.; probably rivet from sword. J 99, a small gold disc, found in southwest corner; D. 0.011 m.; probably rivet from sword. J 101, a strip of gold leaf, found near leg of table; L. 0.07 m., W. 0.004 m.; perhaps decoration of hilt. Rapier with heavy midrib down center of blade; horned hilt; raised rim around edge of tang to take handle plates, presumably of wood, which were fastened on with rivets, one of which was found in place. Rivets, probably originally five in number, had prominent heads overlaid with sheet gold. This is a fine example of the horned sword or rapier classified as Type C i by Miss Sandars (A.J.A., LXVII, 1963, pp. 117ff. and catalogue, pp. 144-146, 175</page><page sequence="193">MYCENAEAN PERIOD: CATALOGUE pl. 21). Although the Agora example is not included in her catalogue, it is certainly of the new fifteenth- century type with "a slender blade with a high midrib, and a horned projection for the hand ... carried out in the same casting as blade and tang ... C i has invariably two rivet-holes in the blade at shoulder level, or rather lower, and usually from one to three in the grip. There is also usually a narrow unflanged extension at the pommel-end, with a small rivet-hole for securing the pommel; always a separate unit" (p. 119). Although "splendidly ornamented hilts are found on most of these swords, with a free use of gold-plating" (Zafer Papoura 36, P.T.K., figs. 58, 110; Tholos, Dendra, R.T.D., pls. XX, no. III, XXII, 2, XXIII, 1-3), the Agora example preserves only the large rivets capped with gold and the hoop J 101. Cf. the similar bronze sword from Tomb 37 at the Argive Heraion (Prosymna, I, pp. 127ff., 329f.; II, figs. 298, 301) which is of almost the same dimensions (L. 0.75 m., G.W. 0.072 m.). As in our sword the han- dle of wood, traces of which were recovered, was fastened on with gold-plated rivets (six in number), and there were presumably ivory plates and a gold wire binding (fig. 301, 6-7). Miss Sandars dates the C i swords to the "middle or latter half of the fifteenth century, before the destruction of the L.M. II Palace at Knossos" (p. 120) with the possibility that the mainland swords are "slightly later than the Cretan, falling at the be- ginning of the fourteenth century." Tomb 37 at Prosymna is dated early in L.H. III A and has pot- tery, including a probable "imitation silver" or tin- incrusted group similar to ours from Tomb III (see Prosymnna, II, figs. 294,296-297; cf. Hesperia, XXXV, 1966, p. 395). See also p. 105. Late fifteenth to early fourteenth century. III-18. Bronze Dagger with Gold Rivets. P1. 36. B 781 and J 99. Hesperia, XVII, 1948, p. 157, fig. 4, pl. XXXIX, 3; J.H.S., LXVII, 1947, p. 110, fig. 2; Hesperia, XXXV, 1966, pl. 92, a. Lying on carbonized remains of wooden table by skeleton C, on top of sword III-17. P.L. ca. 0.46 m. Badly cor- roded; blade preserved in several pieces, but nothing of hilt except two small pieces which appear to be projecting horns. To one of these a gold-leaf rivet- head cover of a smaller size was found adhering (J 99: smaller than 3 associated with III-17, D. 0.008 m.). Very narrow blade with heavy central midrib of the same type as III-17. This is obviously of the same type as III-17, but shorter and less well preserved. It would seem to belie Miss Sandars' statement that "no complete sword [of C i type] is less than 0.60 m. (apart from an un- characteristic one from Cos)" (op.cit., p. 119). Al- though Thompson (Hesperia, XVII, 1948, p. 156, note 9) points to the usual complement of a long sword with a dagger at the Argive Heraion, these were of a different type (a leaf-shaped dagger with- out hilt or midrib from Tomb 37, Prosymna, II, fig. 299, and a dagger of E ii type with flanged pom- mel-tang extension found with a sword of D i type in Tomb 25, Prosymna, II, fig. 198 and Sandars, op.cit., pp. 148, 150). Our dagger exceeds the usual meas- urement (0.30-0.40 m.) and is perhaps better termed a short sword. Late fifteenth to fourteenth century. III-19. Razor. P1. 36. B 782. Hesperia, XVII, 1948, p. 157, fig. 4, pl. XXXIX, 3; J.H.S., LXVII, 1947, p. 110, fig. 2; Hesperia, XXXV, 1966, pl. 92, a. Found with other bronzes on carbonized remains of table in southeast part of chamber; lying nearest skeleton. P.L. 0.19 m., W. of blade 0.045 m. Corroded but apparently more or less complete and with very sharp edge. A broad curved tool with tang for insertion into wooden handle. This is a fine example of the type of object alter- natively termed "razor" or "cleaver," found fairly frequently in tombs of L.H. III date on the Greek mainland, at Ialysos in Rhodes, and in the cemetery of Zapher Papoura in Crete. The original identification as razor was proposed by Tsountas ('Ep. 'Apx., 1888, p. 171); Blegen (Pros- ymna, I, pp. 347f.) suggested that their function was slashing or chopping rather than shaving, but for arguments against "cleaver" see Townsend (Ver- meule), Ares Tomb, pp. 215-216 re VII-27. The thin cutting edge and short handle are much more suitable for a razor. Hence such objects would be the masculine equivalent of the combs, mirrors, cosmetic boxes, etc. deposited with female burials as objects of personal toilet needed for the journey to the other world. Of the six examples from the Argive Heraion ours is closest to one from Tomb 10 (Prosymrna, II, fig. 512, 4). See also p. 106 and VII-27 and XIV-9, both less well preserved. III-20.

This badly preserved chamber tomb was also found in 1947. It had a square chamber, 2.80 m. across by 1.60 m. deep, approached by a dromos from the north, most of which had been cut away by the basements of modem houses. Of the north half of the chamber only the lowest --A 177 I ii l il Ii i II il) II IIIII I) II i)!) / }l}^</page><page sequence="195">MYCENAEAN PERIOD: CATALOGUE 10 cm. were preserved, whereas in the southwest comer broken bedrock stood to a height of over a meter. Toward the center of the chamber the upper half of a skeleton was found, laid out with head to south and cut off below the waist by a modem house basement. Tomb IV was rich in bones, but contained little else. At both the southwest and southeast corners piles of bones of earlier interments were heaped up, that at the southwest containing three skulls. There were also two small pits, one in the northwest comer (0.40 m. by 0.30 m. by 0.25 m. deep) containing nothing but broken bedrock, another in the southwest corner (1.10 m. by 0.50 m. by 0.20 m. deep) full of bones and another skull. All told there were five skulls found, but Angel has indentified the remains of ten skeletons, eight males and two females.1 In funeral practices this tomb follows the customs of the Argolid chamber tombs, in sweeping aside earlier remains or gathering them up and depositing them into bone cists, which differ markedly from the more regular and deeper burial cists of Tombs I and II.2 Although much smaller than Tombs I and III, this may once have contained considerable burial equipment; however, only a handful of sherds were recovered. These consisted of a few fragments of plain bowls and kylikes, of which only the upper part of one could be mended. 1 Skeletons AA 42-45: 42 being the skeleton in the center, M. about 35; 43 the SW bone pile with 3 M. skulls; 44 the SE bone pile, fragments; 45 the SW bone pit with the remains of 4 M. and 2 F. skeletons. 2 See above p. 101.

THE TOMBS ON THE HILL OF THE NYMPHS (V AND VI) Proceeding in a westerly direction from the north slope of the Areopagus and Tombs I-IV, one comes to the Hill of the Nymphs, an area which was also explored in the spring of 1947. At the northeastern foot of the hill, in a region much disturbed by moder buildings, a small Mycenaean chamber tomb was discovered, its burials intact. Furthermore evidence of an unfin- ished chamber tomb about a dozen meters to the west was noticed.' The following spring a late pit grave, containing the skeletons of two children and a single cup, was discovered about the same distance to the southeast. Thus, apparently, there was once a Mycenaean cemetery of more ordinary individuals on the northeast slope of the Hill of the Nymphs, of which only these examples have survived the intensive utilization of the region. 1 Although counted in our enumeration of 46 Mycenaean burial places this tomb has not been assigned a Roman numeral or a grid deposit number, since it contained neither skeletal material nor pottery (see above, p. 97 and note 14). It apparently has approximately the same scheme and dimensions as Tomb V: a dromos 0.80 m. wide and 2.0 m. long, a circular chamber or working space 1.20 m. in diameter leading into a chamber 1.20 m. by 0.85 m. (Hesperia, XVII, 1948, p. 165). It may have been discontinued through some fault in the rock, for part of the ceiling had collapsed in antiquity, though how early we do not know. TOMB V: CHAMBER TOMB (A-B 18:1) Pls. 87, 76; Plan: P1. 82 Hesperia, XVII, 1948, pp. 163-165. Excavated in June, 1947, by Rodney S. Young, this tomb consisted of a small rectangular chamber, 2.80 m. wide by 1.80 m. deep, entered from the east through a dromos 1.10 m. wide 178</page><page sequence="196">TOMBS AND OBJECTS: TOMB V which contracted to a doorway 0.92 m. wide. The doorway preserved its rough stone blocking- wall to a height of 0.70 m. to 0.80 m., and the dromos the firm red earth with which it had been packed to a height of 1.30 m. Only the lower 0.50 m. of the chamber had been hewn from bedrock, the upper part being cut from very compact gravelly earth. The ceiling of the chamber had collapsed at least as early as the sixth century B.C. Two skeletons were found lying in order, their heads toward the east and their legs doubled up (P1. 37). Several earlier interments had been swept aside; some bones were found in the comers of the chamber, others in a small pit (0.55 m. by 0.30 m. by 0.23 m. deep) near the southeast corer.2 The burial offerings consisted only of pottery: six more or less complete vases and two frag- mentary ones, which are difficult to assign to particular burials. The coarse amphora (V-8), which was found standing upright at the feet of the northerr skeleton, obviously belonged to that burial; its mouth was still stopped by a stone, but it contained nothing, the original liquid offering having evaporated. The three-handled jar (V-4), the other plain amphora (V-7), and the cup (V-6) all lay tumbled in the northwest corner of the room; since in two cases a handle is missing, it looks as if they had been swept aside from an earlier burial. The stirrup vase (V-3) was found in the middle of the chamber near the southern skeleton, but it too lacked a handle and may have come from one of the earlier interments. The askos (V-5) was found in the extreme northeast corner some distance from either skeleton. The fragmentary kylikes (V-1 and 2) obviously belonged to one of the earlier burials. Although it is difficult to apportion the vases, the range of time represented cannot have been great. On the evidence of the painted vases V-3 and 4, the tomb should be dated to the fourteenth century, probably to the second half; since there is nothing distinctively Myc. III B among the pottery, the four or five interments probably took place during the span of one or two generations. V-1. Fragmentary Kylix. P1. 37. P 17909.

In the spring of 1948 the extension of this Mycenaean cemetery to the southeast was con- firmed through the discovery of a pit grave with the burial of two young children. A rough rectangular cutting in soft stereo (0.95 m. by 0.64 m. by 0.28 m. deep), lying under the western wall of a Geometric house, contained the doubled-up skeletons of two 'small children and a simple one-handled cup (VI-1; P1. 38). The children had been laid on their sides, one on top of the other; on the basis of the analysis of their teeth, they were judged to be about five and eight years.' The cup had been placed in an upright position at the bottom of the cutting, before the upper body was put in, but because of the cramped space and doubled up postures, it seems likely that both burials took place simultaneously. The grave was not lined, but had apparently been covered with small stones. From the date of the cup, this burial ap- pears to be considerably later than Tomb V, probably after the turn from the thirteenth to the twelfth century. See also pp. 103, 111, 154. Myc.

DISTURBED CHAMBER TOMBS ON THE EAST SLOPE OF THE KOLONOS AGORAIOS 409-412; PI. 38 Continuing in a northerly direction from Tomb V and Grave VI on the east slope of the Hill of the Nymphs, one comes to the Kolonos, at the foot of which in Classical times the important civic buildings of ancient Athens were constructed.' In the process of their building and especially during their Hellenistic enlargements, the east slope of the Kolonos was scarped back and this would doubtless have destroyed any Mycenaean chamber tombs that may have been cut into its eastern face. In 1935 a fragmentary bronze sword or dagger (409) and the fragment of a Mycenaean cup (410), found in a disturbed context in the Forecourt of the Bouleuterion Plateia, suggested the possibility of a destroyed chamber tomb not far away.2 In 1951 Rodney Young proposed that 1 Homer A.

Although a very different weapon from the horned sword and dagger (III-17 and 18) from the Tomb of the Bronzes, this need not be later. Cf. Prosymna, I, pp. 336f.

Con- sisting of round or angular-shoulder dirks or daggers with flanged shoulders and pommel extensions, they run concurrently with the C i and D i swords and date to the later fifteenth and first half of the four- teenth century.

The next group of tombs, consisting of five small chamber tombs and a double pit grave, lies in a line running almost due North-South about 70 to 80 meters east of the scarped back remains of the tombs along the east face of the Kolonos Agoraios. Although possibly other tombs lay in between and have been completely destroyed in later levelling operations, it seems preferable to regard them as separate groups. Tomb VII under the north side of the Temple of Ares was originally approached by a dromos leading in from the west, in the opposite direction from the tombs on the Kolonos, a fact which would suggest a natural declivity between these two areas. Furthermore, unlike the east slope of the Kolonos, the terrain in the present area was singularly ill-suited for chamber tombs. Tomb VII, although extraordinaily rich in contents and in number of interments, was very small with a chamber no more than a meter in height, and Tomb XII, about 60 meters to the south, seems to have collapsed while it was being cut and was apparently never used as a tomb but as a later refuse pit. Between these two lay VIII-XI, for which the evidence is very in- complete. Multiple burials in VIII-X seem to point to very badly disturbed chamber tombs, whereas XI seems to have consisted of two pit burials side by side. TOMB VII: CHAMBER TOMB UNDER TEMPLE OF ARES (J 7:2) Pls. 39-40, 65-67, 77; Plan: P1. 83 Hesperia, XXI, 1952, p. 107. Hesperia, XXIV, 1955, pp. 187-219. This small but extraordinarily rich chamber tomb, lying under the northern foundations of the Augustan reconstruction of the Temple of Ares, was excavated under the direction of Emily Townsend (now Mrs. Cornelius Vermeule) in the spring of 1951, and was the first of the Agora Mycenaean tombs to receive a full and meticulous publication.' The results are here sum- marized and for convenience the inventory of finds is incorporated in our catalogue.2 The tomb chamber, roughly hewn out of bedrock with an irregular plan, about 2.00 by 2.85 m., more triangular than rectangular, was considerably smaller than those of Tombs I and III, yet it contained a total of more than fifteen interments;3 stretching over a period of about two hundred and fifty years (from ca. 1450 to 1200 B.C.). The tomb as found had two dromoi, the original one entering at the west being a short narrow passage with very little slope to the 1 "A Mycenaean Chamber Tomb under the Temple of Ares," Hesperia, XXIV, 1955, pp. 187-219, pls. 71-77. 2 We have shortened the descriptions of the finds and have cited as comparanda mostly material discovered since 1955. For ease of cross reference we have kept the original catalogue number, herewith prefixed by VII. 3 The excavator counted 14 to 15 burials. Skeletal analysis by J. Lawrence Angel revealed that as many as 25 people were buried in the tomb. Numbered from AA 102 to 116, many of these proved to be multiple. The total breaks down to 8 males, 6 females, 9 children and 2 adults (uncertain). 183</page><page sequence="201">MYCENAEAN PERIOD: CATALOGUE floor, the second leading in from the northeast being even narrower and more precipitous. The excavator conjectured that perhaps some accident such as a slide of rock made the original entrance impassable and led to the cutting of a second dromos, an unusual feature in Mycenaean tombs at any site.4 Eight or more burials were made in the tomb during its first period (1450 to 1400 or slightly later),5 at least seven of them through the west doorway; the earlier ones had been shoved aside but Burials VI, VII and VIII were found in fairly good order, the first two at the south end, the third at the north end of the chamber (PI. 89, b). Following this original period of use, a layer of sandy earth approximately 0.40 m. deep was spread over these remains and six or seven additional interments were made at the end of the thirteenth or the early twelfth century, all through the new northeast doorway and apparently limited to the northern half of the chamber. The history of the tomb did not, however, end with the end of the Mycenaean age. During the Protogeometric period a cremation pit was dug above or beside the chamber and a child was buried in the old dromos.6 Twice in the Classical period workmen, apparently engaged in some new construction, came upon this tomb and seem to have been responsible for the deposit of two groups of funeral lekythoi; seven dating to ca. 470 B.C. were found in a shallow pit in bedrock below the knees of Skeleton VII, and two dating to ca. 430 B.C. were placed in the west door after the stone blocking wall had been removed.7 Some four hundred years later the foundations of the Temple of Ares were laid across part of the chamber (PI. 39, a), perhaps destroying some of the contents of its second period of use. Considering the intensive use of the area and the relative shallowness of the tomb chamber, it is truly remarkable that this tomb has yielded our richest inventory of finds. See also pp. 98-101.

Lip painted inside and out; handle painted; stem banded and edge of foot painted; reserved zone on lower bowl, bordered by three narrow bands above and below; upper zone of bowl decorated with a band of running spirals: five double interlocking spirals on each side with triangular filling ornaments. Probably an intermediate form between Furumark, M.P., Type 255 (p. 60, fig. 16) and Type 259 (p. 61, fig. 17), which is characteristic of Rhodes in Myc. III A:2 (B.M.Cat., I, 1, A 866-867, pl. XIV). The running spiral with angular fillings is also not matched closely in Furumark, but as Mrs. Vermeule has shown (Ares Tomb, pp. 210-211), it is more closely related to the early type of band spiral, M.P., Mot. 46: 1-4, 32 (p. 353, fig. 59) which occurs in frescoes and in metalwork; the "zwickel" filling (M.P., Mot. 11: 54- 55, p. 265, fig. 34) is found with the simpler running spiral in III A:1 and Amarna vases (cf. III-14). This is certainly the finest kylix with spiral band known from any site, and must be considered an im- ported piece. The excavator considered Rhodes a likely possibility, but in the light of the rich newly published material from Mycenae, the Argolid should not be ruled out. Cf. B.S.A., LIX, 1964, pl. 69, a (Myc. III A:1 goblet of earlier shape from Atreus bothros); LX, 1965, pp. 165f., figs. 2 and 3 (kylikes from the dromos of Tomb 505, unfortunately none with spiral band, and probably a little later than ours).

TOMB VIII: DISTURBED CHAMBER TOMB (J 8:4) Pls. 41, 77; Plan: P1. 84 Hesperia, IV, 1935, pp. 318-320. Discovered in the spring of 1933, the first Mycenaean burial found in the Agora, it is situated about 20 meters due south of Tomb VII, only a few meters beyond the south edge of the Augustan foundation of the Temple of Ares. Unlike Tomb VII, it had been badly disturbed, and one can say little about its original form.' The excavation was conducted by James H. Oli- ver, and the tomb and its contents were noted by Shear in his Annual Report, where he men- tions "the scant remains of three skeletons lying close together just beneath the floor level of the classical period,"2 and illustrates five fragmentary vases associated with them as well as a gold signet ring (VIII-6) which attracted much attention.3 The presence of three skeletons and the relative wealth of offerings suggest a badly destroyed chamber tomb, of which the entire upper part had been cut away, rather than a pit or cist grave. The pottery agrees fairly closely with that found in the lower burial layer of Tomb VII, particularly that associated with burials IV to VIII, and must likewise be dated early in 1 The plan which is shown on P1. 84 is designed merely to show the relationship of J 8:4 to the graves or tombs discovered in 1952; no plan was made in 1933, and I am indebted to John Travlos for rendering the sketch in the 1952 excavation notebook in publishable form, as well as for discussing the evidence with me. 2 Hesperia, IV, 1935, p. 318. 3 Ibid., figs. 6-8.

Not so common a pattern on the squat alabastron as the wave-and-ivy decoration of VII-4, 5 and 7, the stemmed spiral is found on the body of early angular alabastra (e.g. B.M.Cat., I, 1, A 815 and 816, pl.

It occurs, however, three times on squat alabastra from Chalkis (Chalkis, pls. 15, 450 B'; 17, 402 A', 553 A'), a phenomenon noted by Mrs. Hankey (Chalkis, p. 63).

Oval bezel with design in intaglio: bull- headed man (or wearing bull-mask ?) striding to right with two female figures in flounced skirts behind him; small symbols in field to left and above. Man holds a spear or scepter (?); from his waist two lines extend to the first woman. The symbols are plausibly interpreted as an abbreviated cult building at left and the epiphany of the goddess in the trifoliate quantity above (Rev. V. E. Kenna). Since the size of the hoop is too small for a man's finger, this ring was probably worn on a thong or loop of bronze wire, as has been suggested for the example from the Argive Heraion (Prosymna, I, p. 267). The ring, although less fine in workmanship than the best Mycenaean signets (cf. Prosymtna, II, fig. 576; Marinatos-Hirmer, pl. 206, etc.), has attracted considerable interest because of its unusual representa- tion which suggests a mythological interpretation. A bull-headed man apparently leading captive women on a ring from Mycenaean Athens cannot fail to re- call to us the legend of Theseus and the Minotaur, and it was interpreted by Shear in the original publi- cation (A.J.A., XXXVII, 1933, p. 540; Hesperia, IV, 1935, p. 319), as the Minotaur leading away captive Athenian maidens. This interpretation has not found much favor and has been rejected by Nilsson, Pers- son and Webster (references above). Persson and Webster both see a religious connotation, the former "a predecessor to Hermes Psychopompos ... who, staff in hand, conducts the imprisoned dead away from this world to the kingdom of the dead," where- as Webster favors "Poseidon leading forth two spring goddesses," interpreting the "scepter" as a trident. Neither of these takes cognizance of the bull-headed quality of the male head. Nilsson does not propose another interpretation, but considers the mythologi- cal one "certainly hasty." In studying the ring it became clear that the re- constructed drawing in the original publication (which was widely reproduced) was inaccurate in a number of respects (the omission of the ground line and the feet of the women for example) and that this might have influenced the interpretation, particularly if there was any inaccuracy in the male head. Ac- cordingly, a new drawing was made by Hero Athanas- siades, reproduced on P1. 41. The Reverend V. E. Kenna kindly looked at the ring with me in 1964 and wrote up his obser- vations which are here quoted in part. His basic observation was that the ring showed two periods of engraving-the pillar, the trifoliate quantity, the feet of the women, and the ground line being original, the larger part of the women's bodies, the bull-headed man with the wand later work-and that this may account for certain stylistic difficulties, but "does not alter the main content of the present rep- resentation, that of a bull man leading two captive women." He was certain of the bull-headed quality of the male head and noted comparisons with cylinder seals found in Cyprus depicting male ministrants with bull masks (Contenau, La glyptique syro-hittite, nos. 198, 199, 200, 206). While Kenna discounted any con- nection with the legend of the Minotaur, the paral- lelism of theme seems to me suggestive (see above, pp. 107, 156). He believes that the use of the trifoliate quantity in place of the epiphany of the goddess of earlier rings, as also the relatively small size of the ring, indicates mainland Greek manufacture "with subsequent repair and re-engraving toward the end of that age, of which the date of the associated pottery gives some in- dication." Was he here influenced by Shear's date of "about 1200 B.C."? Without being in a position to appraise the evidence for re-engraving, one might note that a careless linear style of seal engraving was already present from the early fourteenth century (see XL-17), and certainly the pottery found with the gold ring will not admit a date later than the first half of the four- teenth century.

During the spring campaigns of 1951 and 1952, an extension of the Mycenaean cemetery revealed by Tomb VIII was discovered slightly further to the south and west. Six additional Mycenaean "graves" as they were termed by their excavator, Rebecca Wood (now Mrs. Henry S. Robinson), were detected, lying immediately below the Classical level, which in this area rested upon bedrock, thereby almost obliterating the evidence. Two had been cleaned out altogether, and two should be taken together as a double pit grave (our Grave XI, J 8:3).1 We are thus left with two complexes, at J 8:1 and J 8:2, which are best explained as the badly destroyed remains of chamber tombs (our Tombs IX and X). Tomb IX produced only a few scraps of bone,2 one alabastron, a gold bead, and a scrap of lead wire, and the possibility presents itself that it is really a continuation of the rich but destroyed Tomb VIII which had been detected many years earlier. The presence of gold jewelry and lead wires in both complexes suggests a connection, but since they were dug quite separately and could not be properly planned,3 it seems wiser to consider them individually.

TOMB X: DISTURBED CHAMBER TOMB (?) (J 8:2) Pls. 42, 67; Plan: P1. 84 Hesperia, XXII, 1953, p. 41. Lying a little to the south of Tomb IX, this complex, which was referred to by the excavator as "Grave F," was found hopelessly disturbed and scarped away (P1. 42). Quoting the ex- cavator, "It seemed to be not so much a grave as a collection of bones and offerings, presumably swept aside to make room for later burials. The bones were hopelessly mixed and gave no indi- cation of the position of the body at time of inhumation or how many skeletons were re- presented." Skeletal analysis revealed the remains of three individuals,l and it seems likely that they had been swept aside when the adjoining double grave (XI) was set down at a slightly lower level. While the pottery from Tomb X is partially nondescript (X-6 and 6), several pieces, notably the stippled teacup (X-4) and the shallow saucer (X-3) belong to the initial stage of Myc. III A. X-1.

This was the first of the group of burials to be discovered southwest of the Temple of Ares when excavations had been resumed after the war.

A was a squarish cutting less than 1.0 m. in length with the remains of two small skeletons'; B, lying just to the south and 1 The skeletal material (AA 177) assigned to this deposit does not agree with the evidence of the plan and the excavator's description, since AA 177 consisted of bones of a M. about 40 to the north, and a F.(?) to the south, whereas the plan clearly shows three skulls, apparently all children. 195</page><page sequence="213">MYCENAEAN PERIOD: CATALOGUE separated by a thin wall of bedrock only 0.015 m. wide, was somewhat longer and narrower and contained an extended small skeleton, apparently in good order (see Plan). These were judged to be the burials of children. The following spring when the complex at J8:2 (our Tomb X) lying just to the east and at a slightly lower level was discovered, it was thought that this had been cut into and disturbed when the double grave was dug, a conclusion which seems to be substantiated by the later date of the contents of Grave XI. At any rate, the remains of this confused complex suggest a small family cemetery.2 2 Hesperia, XXII, 1953, p. 41. XI-1. Fragmentary Alabastron. P1. 42. P 21195. Grave "A." P.H. 0.062 m., est.

In the spring of 1952 a small chamber tomb was discovered about sixty meters due south of Tomb VII, but with the dromos leading in from the north rather than the west. This tomb poses 196</page><page sequence="214">TOMBS AND OBJECTS: TOMB XII several problems. The chamber as cleared was rough and irregular, (P1. 43), and collapsed bedrock filled it for about 1.20 m. in height. Beneath the collapsed bedrock there was a layer of scattered fieldstones, no orderly interments, and practically no vestige of pottery or bone.' These features suggest a tomb that had collapsed while being cut and had never been used; one is reminded of the unfinished chamber tomb on the east slope of the Hill of the Nymphs.2 However, in the present case the dromos produced a sizable quantity of broken pottery (XII- 1 to 9 plus many uncatalogued fragments). In the Annual Report this was associated with the tomb, "since no household deposit of the Mycenaean period was encountered at ground level in the general area," although it was admitted that "the history of what happened is obscure."3 One should note, however, the totally different character and date of the deposit from those found in the adjacent tombs and graves. The pottery from this deposit was altogether fragmentary, and consisted of many coarse undecorated kylikes, an amphora and hydria, jug, etc., as well as some late skyphoi which cannot be dated earlier than Myc. III C:1 and must fall at about the same time as the fill of the Mycenaean Fountain on the North Slope.4 The neighboring tombs, however, run from the transition of Myc. II to III A (Tomb VII) down to the end of Myc. III A or early III B (Grave XI). This would imply an interval of at least one hundred years between the quarrying of our tomb and its eventual use. Since the nature of the pottery is much closer to that found in three deposits toward the northeast corner of the Agora, which are almost certainly pits or bothroi,5 it seems likely that the present deposit represents a later re-use, as a refuse pit, of the dromos of a collapsed and unfinished chamber tomb (presumably dug as part of the same cemetery that included Tombs VII-XI). The deposit then is of no use in dating the tomb, and is of quite a different character from those we have previously considered. See also pp. 99, 111.

Although chronologically and stylistically the present deposit belongs with these, we have in- cluded it here since it came from a tomb. The dromos material from Tomb 505 at Mycenae may provide a parallel, since Mrs. French concludes (B.S. A., LX, 1965, p. 171) that the pottery found there should not be "associated with the tomb or burials in the tomb but is part of a fill tipped into the dromos" (after the tomb collapsed).

THE TOMBS AT THE NORTHEAST CORNER OF THE AGORA (XIII-XXI). The next group of Mycenaean tombs, which occupies the whole northeast corner of the Agora, begins some eighty meters due east of Tomb VII (J 7:2). The tombs along the east side under the Stoa of Attalos are doubtless an extension of the same cemetery, but for purposes of convenience we have divided it into two parts, those to the west of the Stoa Terrace, and those lying directly under and to the east.l Although there may once have been more tombs lying along the north side and closing the gap between Tomb VII and Tomb XIII, all vestiges have been lost in the scarping down of the area or in the construction of the Athens-Peiraeus Rail- way. From the orientation of the dromoi of this group, all of which face north, it is apparent that the ancient ground level must have risen toward the south2 (Plan, P1. 79). This group shows a concentration of four small chamber tombs (XIII to XV and XVII at 0 7:7, 0 7:5, 0 7:2 and 0 8:4) with three small graves (XVI, XVII, and XIX at N 7:2, 0 7:3, and 0 8:3) sandwiched between in an area of about 150 square meters, with another two small chamber tombs (XX and XXI at P 8:8 and P 9:4) lying somewhat apart to the south. There are also three non-sepulchral or rubbish deposits in the same area (0 7:4, 0 7:14, and P 8:9), at least one of which (that at 0 7:14) contained pottery from disturbed or destroyed chamber tombs.3 1 Since the conditions of excavating were quite different in the two areas, we have grouped together those occupying let- ters N, 0, and P on the grid, and those to the east in letters Q and R. 2 The excavator's notebook also confirms this with the notation that the ground is "rising steeply toward the south." However, the steepness of the dromoi suggests that it cannot have been a very appreciable grade. 3 See also p. 111 and below, pp. 247ff.

The dromos was at least 2.20m. long with a width of 0.80 to 0.90m. tapering upward to 0.60m., and preserved to a height of at least 1.05m. The small chamber (P1. 44, a) contained a few bones,3 a small spouted bronze bowl (XIII-1), a spouted pottery cup (XIII-2) and a steatite button (XIII-4). The other vase that has been associated with this tomb (XII-3) was found in the fifth-century well which had been dug through the tomb chamber. Although dated in the original report "well on in Late Helladic III B or even in C,"4 in our opinion the tomb need not be later than the end of Myc. III A or early III B. See also pp. 99-100, 105.

Ends of handles set through walls and well-riveted on inside. Careful miniature work. This is one of the few bronze vases of the Myce- naean period known from Athens. It is of a shape which occurs in metal in the richly decorated example from the Cenotaph at Dendra (R.T.D., pp. 92ff., pl. XXXI, 4, fig. 67; pl. XXXI, 6, fig. 68, the first with handles like ours, the second with spout), and in a bowl almost identical to ours, but larger, from Asine, Tomb 1:5 (Asine, p. 393, fig. 257). Cf. also a new example from the tholos at Tragana (B.C.H., LXXX, 1956, p. 284, fig. 12). These are approximately three times bigger than ours, ranging from ca. 0.14 to 0.16 m. in height. Similar handles are found on a fragmentary bronze basin from the Argive Heraion (Prosymna, II, fig. 610). None of these should be later than L.H. III A. Cf. Minoan antecedents (P.T.K., pp. 51 f., fig. 52 b). The metal form influenced the kalathos shape in pottery (cf. also Furumark, M.P., p. 52).

Lying a few meters south and east of Tomb XIII (Plan: PI. 79) with a parallel alignment of its dromos, Tomb XIV was also found in the spring of 1951 and received a preliminary publication in the Annual Report.1 Unlike its neighbor it was carefully cut and much better preserved. It is one of the few tombs found in the Agora that has an almost architectural regularity with squared chamber (1.75 m. wide by 2.10 m. deep) and axially centered dromos (P1. 45, a; 4.0 m. long by 1.10 m. wide tapering upward to 0.80 m.). The dromos had two lateral niches (1.0m. long by 0.50m. high) used for the burials of children, two in the right-hand or western niche (PI. 45, b), one in the eastern niche. The niches are symmetrically placed with respect to the doorway, but the eastern niche was at a considerably higher level and contained no offerings.2 The tomb had not been robbed or disturbed in post-Mycenaean times, for the doors of the main chamber and the niches were found closed with rough rubble walls. The chamber itself (PI. 45, c) had been used for multiple burials: the remains of the two earliest occupants had been swept to the back, and two later skeletons were found in order at the sides of the chamber, lying on their backs with their knees drawn up. Subsequently, the roof of the chamber collapsed and the body of a child was introduced from above. All told there were eight interments,3 yet the number of offerings is comparatively small and the time range represented by them does not appear to be great, with the possible exception of the feeding bottle (XIV-7) and the fragmentary coarse jug (XIV-8) associated with burial V.4 Burials I-IV should be about contemporary with the middle burials of Tomb VII (i.e. Myc. III A:l1 to 2 early), the niche burials probably a little later, and the burial introduced after the collapse of the tomb perhaps well on in Myc. III B. See also pp. 99-102.

Cf. also the niche in the dromos of Tomb 23 at Perati which from the furnishings-feeding bottle, sea-shells, idol-was clearly the interment of a child (Epyov, 1957, p. 19, fig. 18). 3 Only seven skeletons were assigned to this tomb in Angel's analysis: AA 117-123. 117 (burial V) Child of 7; 118 and 119 (burials I and II) M. of 46 and F. of 26; 120 (burial III) M. of 40; 121 (burial IV) M. of 37; 122 and 123 (burials VI and VII) Children of 6 and 5. Apparently the bones of the East Niche were not analyzed. 4 The numbering of the burials apparently proceeded from the chamber to the niches, but there is every reason to think that burial V was in reality the eighth. 201</page><page sequence="219">MYCENAEAN PERIOD: CATALOGUE Low concave neck with spreading flat rim; tall piriform body with false ring base; three vertical handles with slight projection at base attachment.

The scant remains of a third chamber tomb in the region were encountered in the spring of 1952, lying about five meters southeast of Tomb XIV. A preliminary publication appeared in the Annual Report. In the present tomb only the bottom 0.10 to 0.20 m. of the chamber was preserved along with the partial skeletal remains of two or three occupants (P1. 46, a).l The plan revealed a square chamber (1.80 m. by 1.80 m.), entered by a sloping dromos (0.90 m. wide and preserved to a length of 2.5 m.) from the northeast. The only grave offerings were two pots and a bronze dagger, although a third pot (XV-3) which had been found the previous season in a late pit which cut through the northern half of the chamber must be associated with this tomb. The reason for the scantiness of the remains and the incomplete condition of the skeletons is, however, to be explained by an earlier disturbance. Apparently much of the tomb had been cut away by workmen who were engaged in digging the foundations for a large monument in the fourth century B.C. and once they had struck the skeletons reverence for the dead induced them to shift the monument westward by its own width (P1. 46, b).2 This affords a paral- lel to the two sets of propitiatory white-ground lekythoi deposited in Tomb VII, when fifth- century workmen came upon the burials there. From the offerings this tomb should be dated fairly early in the fourteenth century, either Myc. III A: 1 or more likely Myc. III A: 2 early.3 See also p. 99. XV-1. Kylix. P1. 46. P 22318.

Barely two meters to the south of the chamber of Tomb XIII lay a small pit grave (0.50 m. by 5 m. by 0.75 m. deep) containing the skeleton of an infant girl.l Although a simple grave with a single interment, the pit was packed with gifts. These consisted of ten vases, among them the beautiful Lily Bowl (XVI-1), which form a fine early group, a necklace, ivory comb and pin, and a collection of seashells. Excavated in the spring of 1951, along with its neighbors (XIII-XIV), the grave received a preliminary publication in the Annual Report.2 The relative spaciousness of the cutting in respect to the small skeleton (P1. 47) and the wealth of offerings is reminiscent of the Shaft Graves and particularly of those of the Prehistoric Cemetery below the Lion Gate at Mycenae.3 It is with this period (L.H. I-II) that our vases ally themselves, and "no later than Late Helladic III A"4 does not fully emphasize their early quality. Of all the Agora burials this is the earliest closed group and must be even a little earlier than the first burials in Tomb VII, probably nol later than the mid-fifteenth century.5 See also pp. 103, 108, 109-110.

Not a standard shape and apparently more or less unique, although there is a resemblance in the flat- tened bottom and thickened lip to certain early spouted cups, Furumark, M.P., Type 253 (p. 48, fig. 13), Myc. II A-III A:2. Perhaps the origin of the shape is to be sought in metal, although here too no real parallel has been found. A small angular-sided bowl from the Argive Heraion (Prosymna, II, fig. 478, 933) has the same arrangement of handles but other- wise is completely different, and certainly later. Closer in time and spirit are certain Mattpainted basins from Phylakopi (Phylakopi, p. 110, fig. 77, pl. XV, 17-20) with two loop handles on rim and interior dec- oration. Cf. also the Myc. I-II A basin from Keos with crocuses and an interior tondo (Hesperia, XXXI, 1 AA 127: analyzed by Angel as a child of about one and a half.

It has been suggested (Agora Guide, 2nd ed., p. 145) that it was "clearly intended for bulbs," a hanging flower pot; this would account for the three suspension loops, but seems too modern an idea. I would prefer to think of it as something used in the toilet or meals of the infant girl. Decoration is standard representation of lily: Furu- mark, M.P., Mot. 9: 6, 7 (p. 258, fig. 32), Myc. II B.

Cf. early use of dotted scale on Myc. II cup from Chalkis (Chalkis, pl. 20, 544). The careless rendering of the scale pattern and the broad bands, as well as the shape, favor a dating in Myc.

Possibly some vague descendant of the "duck vases" of Middle Helladic (cf. 256 and references) which were in a black burnished ware. This vase is clearly not Mycenaean in shape or technique.

Necklace: Beads and Gold Pendant. Pls. 47, 77. J 124. Pendant: P.H. 0.011 m., W. 0.011 m. Larg- est (quartz) bead: D. 0.015 m., H. 0.008 m. Found a little below head of skeleton. Preserved are seven beads: one of quartz or light amethyst, one of light blue paste, two of green paste, one with melon ribbing, fragments of another of green paste and one of yellow. Gold pendant, broken at tip, consists of two opposed spirals, connected by a curving member decorated by grooves and a series of dots above them (formalized lily motive). Pendant very nicely made of two sheets of gold, upper with repouss6 decoration, lower plain. Anthers done with granulation, some of which are missing. In cleaning pendant some purplish powder was collected, sug- gesting that grooves may have been filled with sil- ver (?). For lily pendant compare the fine gold necklace from Tomb 2 at the Argive Heraion (Prosymna, II, fig. 577, a) dating to L.H. II. Ours is much closer to the lily pendants of this necklace than to those of the L.H. III necklace from Tomb 41 (Prosymna, I, p. 269; II, fig. 859, 2). Spherical beads of glass paste begin in L.H. I and continue into L.H. III, with some of the finest and largest specimens belonging to the earlier period (Prosymna, I, pp. 297ff., II, figs. 142, 1; 143, 12). The colors range from greenish blue and purplish blue, to yellow and white. For bead with melon fluting cf. Prosymna, II, fig. 143, 9 (from dromos of Tomb 1, L.H. I-III).

Sixty-one shells were found in tombs at the Argive Heraion (Prosymnac, I, pp. 464-465; II, fig. 463, 11-13). It seems likely that shells were considered an ap- propriate gift for a child's burial (we have them in three tombs with children) and they may have served as playthings in actual life.

In the spring of 1951 there was also discovered a small cist grave lying between Tombs XIV and XV. This received a preliminary publication in the Annual Report.1 The cutting was roughly rectangular (1.60 by 0.50 m.) and was once covered with rough stone slabs, two of which were found over the body. The skeleton, presumably that of a man,2 lay in a somewhat contracted position with the head at the southeast and with the offerings, two pots and a bronze knife, at this end of the grave. See also Archaeology, IV, 1951, pp. 223-225. 2 AA 124: analyzed by Angel as F. about 14. Here there seems to be some mistake. One wonders whether it was an adolescent boy or whether the skeletons somehow got mixed, for the knife points clearly to the burial of a male. 208</page><page sequence="226">TOMBS AND OBJECTS: TOMB XVIII In the light of the current discussions concerning the origin of the Submycenaean cist grave form,3 this burial is important in showing the occurrence of many features of the later cist burials in a genuine Mycenaean context. The long rectangular cutting, the covering slabs, and the burial of an adult in a relatively extended position are all present. The burial cannot be dated later than the end of Myc. III A or the beginning of III B. 3 See also pp. 103-104 and note 49. Add now Carl Gustaf Styrenius, Submycenaean Studies, pp. 161-162, who has also voiced criticism of Desborough's theory of the derivation of Attic Submycenaean cist graves from non-Mycenaean examples. He has cited the occurrence of ten single burials in the Mycenaean cemetery in the Agora (these can now be extended to from 12 to 15), but as we have suggested above (p. 103) not all these should be considered cist graves or connected with the later form. The present grave is, however, one that might well be significant. Although the body is not fully extended, the cutting was apparently long enough and it was the placing of the offerings at the head that led to the slight contraction of the legs. XVII-1.

TOMB XVIII: CHAMBER TOMB (0 8:4) Pls. 48-49, 65, 67; Plan: P1. 86 This small chamber tomb was discovered in January, 1954, during engineering work con- nected with the reconstruction of the Stoa of Attalos, and it has not received a preliminary publication. Lying about four meters to the southeast of the chamber of Tomb XIV, it had been badly disturbed by a fourth-century B.C. pit which cut into the northeast part of the chamber (rectangular, ca. 1.80 m. by 1.30 m.). The dromos, which probably led in from the northeast as in the neighboring Tombs XIII-XV, could not be traced. Two skeletons and traces of a third were found.' Only the one lying along the west edge of the chamber was well-preserved, with its head to the south, knees up, and with the pots (XVIII-1 1 AA 134-136: analyzed by Angel as follows: 134, E skeleton, M. of 18; 135, center, F. of 40; 136, W skeleton, F. of 25. 209</page><page sequence="227">MYCENAEAN PERIOD: CATALOGUE through 7) at its feet (P1. 49). Two more pots (XVIII-8 and 9) were found lying between this skeleton and the chamber wall. Thus, all offerings were associated with this better preserved skeleton. Although the offerings at the foot may have been moved from the eastern skeleton (or skeletons) at the time of the later interment, the range in time cannot have been great. The pottery is entirely of Myc. III A: 2 type, with the exception of the beaked jugs (XVIII-1 and 5) which seem to perpetuate a III A :1 form in a kind of debased technique.

Of the other askoi from the Agora tombs, this is closest to V-5: although that is less squat, has a shorter spout and a lower handle which connects spout and top of body. For the basket handle cf. VII-21, which otherwise differs with a low straight spout and a more pronounced base. The little black askos, XVI-9, is altogether different in shape, although the length of spout is comparable. This shape is one of the least standardized of Mycenaean. The number of black askoi is suggestive of a Middle or Early Hel- ladic ancestry, when black burnished and Minyan wares were in vogue.

Measuring 1.40 m. by 0.55 m., it is similar in form to Grave XVII, and like it was covered with a few rough stone covering slabs (PI. 49), under which lay the skeleton of an adult with the head to the north and the knees up,2 the grave being rather short. A single offering, the ewer XIX-1, was placed above the knees. The style of this solitary offering suggests an ad- vanced date in Myc. III A:2, or even III B, for the burial. See also pp. 103-104. 1 Tomb XVIII was actually not discovered until two months later. It has been suggested by John Travlos that the cist grave was perhaps set down in the dromos of the chamber tomb, but this is uncertain since the actual dromos was not detected. 2Skeleton not listed by Angel.

This appears to be a rather decadent version of an early type, derived from the fine Myc. II to early Myc. III A ewers on which such isolated spiraliform designs were common (cf. Korakou, pl. V). In com- parison with our beautiful ewers VII-17, XXIII-1 and 2, XXXI-1, XL-6, this is clearly a late and provincial work. See also p. 134. Myc. III A: 2 late (or early III B). TOMB XX: CHILD'S CHAMBER TOMB (P 8:8) P1. 49; Plan: P1. 87 In December, 1953, there was found a miniature chamber tomb complete with a dromos and door closed with stones, but with a chamber measuring only 0.50 m. by 0.70 m. and just large enough to contain the curled up skeleton of a child' and a few simple offerings (P1. 49).2 Lying about 15 meters southeast of Tomb XVIII, it is only a few meters to the west of the foundation for the terrace in front of the Stoa of Attalos. The pottery is fairly nondescript, although the coarse amphora (XX-1) is certainly later than XVIII-7, and the Psi-type figurine (XX-3) gives the best clue for dating the tomb to an advanced stage of Myc. III B. It is one of the latest Mycenaean burials in the Agora, and only Grave VI and the upper burial stratum of Tomb VII are later.

TOMB XXI: CHAMBER TOMB (P 9:4) Pls. 50, 65, 67, 76-77; Plan: P1. 86 In January, 1954, a chamber tomb was discovered lying about 20 meters to the west of Pier 15 of the Stoa of Attalos and almost in a line and a few meters south of Tomb XX.1 Although the entire upper part had been cut away in Classical times, leaving only the lowest 0.50 to 0.80 m., and a Classical pit had cut away the northwest corer of the chamber, the burials were remarkably undisturbed and the chamber could be planned and measured (2.00 m. wide by 2.40 m. deep). The dromos, opening to the northeast, was short and steep and ir- regularly cut. It was 0.70 m. wide and was preserved to a length of 1.50 m.; a few stones of the blocking wall of the doorway remained. The tomb had been used for five or more burials.2 Three skeletons were found in their original position (P1. 50). One lay along the east side with head to south and legs doubled up; another in the center with feet toward the door; and a third at the back of the chamber. In the southwest corer were the remains of a swept-up skeleton, and beneath this a shallow pit with swept-up bones and pots from still earlier burials. The sequence of burials should run as follows: 1) the remains in the pit; 2) the swept-up skeleton at southwest comer; 3) and 4) the skeletons at the back and the east side; 5) the skeleton at the door. With each burial were found This tomb has not received a preliminary publication in the Annual Report. 2 The remains of seven skeletons were analyzed by Angel: AA 137-140. 137 (E. side) F. child of 10; 138 (in front of door) M. child of 6; 139 (back of chamber) M. child of 6; 140 (SW corer) F. child of 5; 140 a, b and c (bone pit) child of 10, F. of 45, M. middle-aged. 218</page><page sequence="231">MYCENAEAN PERIOD: CATALOGUE some offerings, but most of the pottery came from the pit and the swept-aside skeleton in the southwest corner.3 The offerings seem to run from the transitional Myc. II-III A: 1 period (about contemporary or very little later than the earlier burials in Tomb VII) through the fourteenth century, and into the Myc. III B period, if the jug XXI-8 is correctly dated to that period. This was associated with the skeleton at the back of the chamber, which was presumably earlier than the one at the door, yet with the latter was found the angular alabastron XXI-9 which stylistically belongs with the earliest material. Curiously, all four last interments were children; perhaps these all took place in the Myc. III B period and some offerings from the earlier burials were reused. The local character of most of the pottery (the jar XXI-1, the alabastron XXI-2, and the rhyton XXI-6 are exceptions) makes absolute dating difficult. See also pp. 99, 101, 110.

An uncanonical decoration of the squat alabastron, the running spiral has perhaps been borrowed from the squat jug type (Prosymna, II, fig. 683, 562) or the angular alabastron (B.M.Cat., I, 1, A 816) and here combined with the open wave to fill the angles. Almost certainly a provincial variant: cf. also the three alabastra with stemmed spirals, Chalkis, p. 63, pl. 15, 450B'. Cf. also the better spiral band on a squat alabastron in Fogg Museum said to have come from Attica (C.V.A., Fogg, IlIa, pl. II, 11). But note the alabastron from Argos with 2 rows of spirals (B.C.H., LXXXIII, 1959, p. 773, fig. 7). The whole composition is rather careless and has some of the inventive abandon that characterizes several pots from the Ares Tomb (cf. VII-2, 8, 9, 19, 21). See also pp. 123, 142-143. Myc.

II examples with two zones of decoration (Ch. T., pls. XXXIX, 19, XL, 17, 18; Prosymna, II, fig. 689), this uses patterns in a degenerate and casual way. For the wavy lines which should have terminated in ivy leaves cf. the Myc. III A: 1 tankard (Zygouries, p. 138, fig. 30, 1), and for the shoulder squiggles cf. the neat wavy line (Mot. 53: 4, 5, p. 373, fig. 65) of more conventional angular alabastra (Prosymna, II, fig. 109, 212).

Furumark does not list any very early lids, but from the context our example cannot be later than early Myc. III A. No exact parallel for the rather careless and casual arrangement of the radiating wavy lines; however, the flat surface has been treated in the same manner as the bases of Myc.

The ineptly drawn spiral band seems to be a variation of Mot. 46: 55-57 (p. 357, fig. 60), but there are no exact parallels. Clearly an imitation of the early Myc. III A:1 type of straight-sided alabastron with spiral band (cf. C.V.A., Br. Mus. III a, pi. 1, 23, 24). A careless but more faithful imitation is found at Chalkis (Chalkis, pl. 18, 451 A'). In shape and in the unusual ornamentation, this alabastron seems close to XXI-4, yet the context in the tomb would suggest that it was considerably later, belonging to the last interment. This can be explained either by assuming that it is a very late and decadent continuation of an early type into Myc.

THE TOMBS ALONG THE EAST SIDE BENEATH THE STOA OF ATTALOS (XXII-XXXVI) Although undoubtedly a continuation of the cemetery at the northeast corner of the Agora, the present series is considered separately because of the nature of the terrain and the diffi- culties imposed upon the excavators. This group of fifteen, consisting of nine small chamber tombs and six pit or cist graves, or burials too uncertain to be classified according to type, lies entirely beneath the Stoa of Attalos or in the area immediately to the east (ranging from squares P to R and 7 to 10 on the grid). Not only were they badly disturbed by the ancient builders of the Stoa who sunk their foundation trenches deep into stereo, but lying as they do between the ancient piers of the Stoa, they were almost impossible to excavate with the same thoroughness that characterized excavations elsewhere. Seldom could the complete plan of the tomb be plot- ted, and in some cases the nature of the burial remains unknown. All but three, which were discovered in 1949 or 1950, were found in the summer and fall of 1953 and in the spring of 1954, when the rebuilding of the Stoa was initiated. Most of them were thus first detected by the engineers engaged in this project, but as soon as there was any indication of an ancient burial, it was excavated in as scientific a manner as possible, under the supervision of Eugene Vanderpool. Undoubtedly there were more tombs that have not been located, perhaps ir- retrievably obliterated by the ancient Stoa builders, and from these a certain number of frag- mentary vases found in the Stoa construction fill (413-424) probably came. Although the tombs themselves are badly preserved and less well documented than those lying to the west, the pottery from these burials consisting of some seventy vases, some in remarkably good preservation, is a significant addition to the Agora collection of Mycenaean. The material runs from the Myc. II B period to early Myc. III B, with the greatest concentra- tion in Myc. III A. Only two of these tomb groups have been illustrated in the Annual Re- ports.' In publishing these tombs, we begin with those at the north end, the chamber tombs first and then the cist graves or uncertain burials, and end with the group further to the south near Stoa Pier 12. 1 Hesperia, XIX, 1950, pp. 825-326, pl. 100, d; XXIII, 1954, pp. 57-58, pl. 16, b. 217</page><page sequence="235">MYCENAEAN PERIOD: CATALOGUE TOMB XXII: DROMOS OF CHAMBER TOMB (Q 7:2) Pls. 51, 75 This tomb, or more properly its dromos, was discovered in August, 1953, when workmen were clearing the bottom stratum of the foundations of the Stoa colonnade at its northern end. A soft spot in the earth revealed a cutting about 0.95 m. wide running from west to east and sloping downward toward the east, apparently the dromos of a chamber tomb, with its chamber under the stylobate foundations of the Stoa. The cutting was filled with greenish earth and contained only two sherds, one the base of a kylix (XXII-1). The chamber and its burials1 could not be excavated, if indeed they had been spared by the Stoa builders. 1 Although there is no mention of skeletal material in the notebook, AA 150 (analyzed by Angel as F. of 24) has been assigned to this deposit.

TOMB XXIII: CHAMBER TOMB NORTHWEST OF PIER 19 (Q 8:8) Pls. 51, 67, 77; Plan: P1. 88 In September, 1953, when engineers were opening an East-West drain between Piers 19 and 20, workmen came upon a Mycenaean chamber tomb lying about the level of the nineteenth foundation course' of the Stoa (P1. 51). The chamber was roughly square in shape, (2.70 m. wide by 2.10m. deep), oriented northeast to southwest across its transverse axis. The entrance was at the northwest side where a row of sizable fieldstones rested on the floor of the tomb and indicated the lowest course of the original blocking wall of the doorway (0.80 m. wide). At the inner northeast corner of the chamber the side wall began to arch over at a height of about 0.60 m. above the floor. Despite the disturbance of the area, the burial layer was remarkably well preserved, with the remains of four interments and their offerings.2 The latest burial was made about 0.25 m. above floor level with the skeleton oriented in the axis of the chamber but closer to the west wall, its head toward the southeast. A single offering, the cup XXIII-6, found on the opposite side of the chamber but at this level, can be assigned to this burial. Two earlier burials at floor level revealed skeletons to the right and left of the entrance axis. The left, or northern one, had associated with it a large beaked jug or ewer (XXIII-2) as well as four steatite buttons (XXIII-10 to 13). The southern skeleton had three pots, the ewer (XXIII-1) which stood in the southwest corer, a three-handled jar (XXIII-3) near its waist, and a kylix (XXIII-4) at its feet. In the center of the chamber was a fragmentary kylix (XXIII-5) and the remnants of a bronze knife.3 The earliest remains came from a small round pit in the northeast comer (0.40 m. 1 Counted down from the preserved original north end of the Stoa. 2 AA 154 to 156 analyzed as follows (but without indication as to which belonged to which position in chamber): 154, F. of 53; 155, M. of 35; 155a, M. of 40; 156, F. of 13. 3 It apparently disintegrated completely and could not be catalogued. 218</page><page sequence="236">TOMBS AND OBJECTS: TOMB XXIII in diameter and 0.80 m. deep), in which was found a skull and various bones, an ivory comb (XXIII-7), three beads of glass paste (XXIII-8), and a terracotta button (XXIII-9).

Rim, handle and base glazed; three bands at end of spout, two on neck, another at junction with shoulder, and another above base. Body decorated with three groups of triple spirals with central trian- gular filling; four wavy streamers from handle at- tachment. Furumark, M.P., Type 144 (p. 30, fig. 5), Myc. III A:1; Mot. 47: 1 and 4 (p. 357, fig. 60), Myc. II B. While the shape is the slightly later more ovoid form of ewer with shorter spout and straighter handle, the decoration is a direct descendant of Ephyraean ware, with its absence of banding, isolation of motives and characteristic streamers below handle. For the triple spiral with "zwickel" filling, cf. the double spiral on the Myc. II B ewer from Korakou (pl. V) and the single spiral on the ewer from Ialysos (Ialysos, p. 185, fig. 108). The metallic tongue pattern and foliate band of these earlier examples are gone, and ours should be dated to Myc. III A:I. Triple spiral clearly related to simplified nautilus popular on these ewers (cf. XXXVII-2 and XL-6). Cf. especially Schefold, Meisterwerke, p. 118, fig. 21, with "zwickel" fillings.

It was, however, at a some- what higher level,' and the northern part, including most of the doorway and the dromos, had been cut away by the ancient Stoa builders (P1. 53).2 The dimensions of the chamber were 2.90 m. wide by 1.60 m. deep. Unusual features of the tomb were a small recess in the back or south wall, in which stood the askos (XXIV-21), and a rough stone slab (XXIV-24), which was found on the floor near the center of the east side, but which may once have been a grave marker at ground level. The tomb had been used for repeated burials. Two skeletons, both to the west of the entrance, extended with feet toward the door, seem to represent the latest interments, although the eastern one had been somewhat pushed to the side. Unfortunately, no offerings were definitely assigned to these burials, but the askos in the niche (XXIV-21) and an angular alabastron (XXIV-20) found about 0.30 m. above floor level should probably be assigned to this burial stratum. In the southeast corner and along the west wall there were swept-up piles of bones and offerings from earlier burials, and in the northwest corner there was a small round pit (0.50 m. in diameter by 0.20 m. deep) full of bones. Skeletal analysis revealed the remains of twelve interments.4 Despite the number of interments, this tomb was not a particularly wealthy one except in the quantity of pots, many of which are in a provincial fabric with dull glaze and seem to per- petuate Myc. II shapes in a debased technique, for example the deep-bowled kylikes (XXIV-12 to 14) and the ewers (XXIV-8 to 10). These are difficult to date. The decorated vases com- prise some early (Myc. III A:1) pieces, which appear to have been imported (XXIV-1 and 3 to 7). Some beads (XXIV-22) and a steatite button (XXIV-23) were the only other offerings found, but it is possible that some objects of greater value had been removed at the time of the later interments.5 See also pp. 99, 101-102, 105. 1 Parallel with the bottom of the sixteenth foundation course of the Stoa compared with the nineteenth of XXIII. 2 The eastern part of the north wall is preserved for a length of about 0.90 m. where it seems to turn northwards for the door. 3 This recess is not indicated on the plan but is visible on the photograph (P1. 53). 4 AA 142-147 analyzed by Angel as follows: southeast corer, 142, M. of 48; 142a, C. of 7; 143, M. of 44; 143 a, C. of 4; west side, 144, M. of 39; 144a, M. of 28; 145, F. of 42; 145a, F. of 18; west center, 146, M. of 42; 146a, F. of 41; east center, 147, M. of 50; 147 a, F. of 25. The double entries under "west center" and "east center" would seem to indicate that there was an earlier interment under the two latest burials. 5 The mixed character of XXIV-22 might point in this direction. For this practice, cf. Wace, Ch.T., p. 145. Not all the pots were drawn at the time of excavation and hence only those of certain location are indicated on the plan. In the Catalogue the pottery is presented according to types and in the probable chronological sequence rather than according to specific areas of the tomb. 221</page><page sequence="239">MYCENAEAN PERIOD: CATALOGUE POTTERY XXIV-1.

TOMB XXV: CHAMBER TOMB UNDER LATE ROMAN FORTIFICATION WALL (R 7:1) P1. 53 In October, 1953, the Stoa engineers, who were digging a deep trench which passed under the Late Roman Fortification Wall four or five meters east of Stoa Shop XX, came upon the remains of a Mycenaean chamber tomb, from which several vases and sherds, as well as the remnants of two skeletons,' were brought up. It was impossible to fix the limits of the tomb in any direction, since at the north and south it was cut by the wall, and operations could not be extended to the east and west, owing to the rapid flow of water from the surface of bedrock. However, the multiple burials establish it as a chamber tomb, part of the same group as XXII, XXIII, and XXIV, but somewhat later in time. On the evidence of its pottery, this is one of the latest Mycenaean tombs from the Agora, falling in the thirteenth century, for it is among the very few that have yielded clear examples of the Myc. III B pottery style,2 namely the depressed stirrup vase XXV-1. XXV-1. Stirrup-Vase. PI. 53. P 23616. H. 0.08 m., D. 0.114 m. Intact. Fine hard reddish buff clay; light red paint, mostly faded.

Although not a com- mon shape in the Argolid chamber tombs, examples are found in Attica (of. Attica, p. 35, pl. 8, 9-10, 12-13).

Prosymnna, II, figs. 254, 731; 557, 966. At first sight this has the appearance of Gray Minyan (cf. the Gray Minyan alabastron, Prosymna, I, p. 445; II, fig. 226, 437). However, the presence of a true glaze and perhaps some decoration suggest rather a misfired example in which the fabric and paint were unintentionally reduced in the kiln. If so, it would be an important confirmation of the local production of Mycenaean pottery in Athens. Alter- natively, the pot may have been badly burnt sub- sequent to its manufacture; the extreme brittleness of the clay is reminiscent of the vitrified sherds found in the pithoid jar III-15 (see above).

TOMB XXVI: CHAMBER TOMB EAST OF SHOP XIX (R 7:2) Pls. 53-54, 75-76; Plan: P1. 88 In July 1953, when Stoa engineers were digging beside the foundations just east of Stoa Shop XIX, they came upon some bones, Mycenaean sherds,l and a pot (XXVI-1). As the excavation was enlarged the legs of two skeletons were exposed in a trench about one meter wide, with the whole pot and the coil of lead wire (XXVI-6) found between the two sets of legs. The floor of the tomb was level with the seventh foundation course of the Stoa, and there was no great depth of bedrock fill above the bones, barely 0.20 to 0.30 m. before the Classical level. No sure limit to the tomb could be fixed in any direction,2 although tunnelling to the east the following year was done to a maximum penetration of 1.80 m. east of the Stoa Foundations. In this subsequent operation a broken skull, the bones of a doubled-up skeleton, two ter- racotta figurines (XXVI-4 and 5), other coils of lead wire (XXVI-7), and two more skulls were found. No end of the tomb was in sight when operations had to be stopped. Although the excavation of this tomb was incomplete, it was clearly a chamber tomb with multiple burials,3 and contained some very fine and unusual pottery. The ritual character of 1 Presumably these were the sherds of XXVI-2 and 3 which were found in storage and catalogued in the summer of 1961. 2 The plan seems to establish an eastern limit, but this is perhaps an arbitrary one, as the notebook expressly states that "no end of the tomb was in sight" when operations ceased. I also fail to see that there is any indication that this tomb or XXV were entered by dromoi leading to the south, as indicated on the master plan. A northern orientation on the analogy of XXIV would seem more likely. 3 AA 148-149 analyzed by Angel as follows: 148, M. of 47; 148 a, F. of 27; 149, C. of 2 and a half; 149 a, C. of 3 and a half. (These last should be the two found in 1954 and thus associated with the terracotta figurines; see also p. 109). 227</page><page sequence="245">MYCENAEAN PERIOD: CATALOGUE the pierced hydria (XXVI-1), and the unusual and perhaps ritual form of X XVI-2, suggest that we may be dealing with the burial of a person of some religious stature, although the evidence for this theory is less than in Tomb 44 at the Argive Heraion, where Blegen found a table of offerings and six pierced vases, which he suggests may have been the paraphernalia of a priest.4 From the pottery that was recovered this tomb should be dated in the Myc.

The shape is fairly rare and has been recognized as a ritual one by Stubbings (Attica, pp. 56-57) because of the small pierced hole in the center of the front through the resting surface. Forsdyke (B.M.Cat., I, 1, pp. 157-158) had recognized this feature earlier in connection with two somewhat later hydriai from Ialysos (A880-881, pl. XIII). Stubbings added a Myc. III A example from Kopreza (Attica, p. 57, fig. 26, pl. 18, 2) which is closer in shape to ours, and noted the existence of similar piercings on a small III B hydria from the Argive Heraion (Prosymna, II, fig. 290, 702) and on an example from Nauplia (Athens, N.M. 8566). To these can be added the III A hydria from Ialysos (lalysos, pp. 180-131, fig. 51, see description under no. 7) and possibly the example in the Nauplia Museum (B.C.H., LXXIX, 1955, p. 238, fig. 11). A new example in Hobart, Tasmania (A.J.A., LXXI, 1967, pp. 87-89, p. 82, fig. 1) of some- what later date seems to lack the piercing, and the Myc. III A:2 example from the Argive Heraion (Prosymna, II, figs. 501, 51; 698) is apparently restored at the crucial point. Close to the latter is the more conventional of the two recently published hydriae from Berbati, Tomb XII (Berbati, pp. 74ff., figs. 53, 24; 59-60). The other with its curious hatched leaf and tendril decoration (pp. 74ff., figs. 53, 14; 55-58) is in an earlier tradition. Neither shows a hole in the photographs (but these are often not visible) nor is any described. Furumark seems to have missed this feature in the published examples. The ritual nature of the decoration on the hydria from lalysos with double axe and horns of consecra- tion is self-evident, less so the decoration of the other examples, although Forsdyke (op.cit., p. 158) attempt- ed to see a ritual significance in the murex shells of A 880-881, and both the Agora example and the Nauplia vase (B.C.H., LXXIX, 1955, p. 238, fig. 11) are decorated with octopuses, the latter done with a rather careless abandon and without superimposed white. Ours are neat and relatively naturalistic with the prolonged body of the earlier examples (cf. Mot. 21: 14), but with the number of tentacles (2 pairs) curtailed from the original four.

Eight non-joining fragments preserve part of rim, shoulder decoration, and encircling bands above base. Fine hard pink-buff clay; lustrous orange-red glaze paint; highest quality fabric. Apparently from a small closed pot of globular shape with a low flaring rim cut in points (see re- constructed drawing, P1. 76). Rim glazed inside and out; on shoulder a frieze of pendant concentric semicircles framed above and below by a broad band bordered by a row of dots; on lower body fine encircling lines of equal width cover com- plete surface. Not a standard shape but probably a variant of Furumark, M.P., Type 77 or 78 (p. 30, fig. 5), Myc. III A: 1-2, under the influence of the pomegranate 4 Prosymna, I, pp. 213-214.

III A:2. Both shape and decoration are unusual. The fine banding on the lower part of the vase differs from the usual Mycenaean alternation of groups of narrow lines framed by broader bands and foreshadows Protocorinthian. (But cf. the similar fine banding on some later Mycenaean vases from Achaia, A.J.A., LXIV, 1960, pls. 1, figs. 2-3; 3, fig. 24). The rows of dots bordering the shoulder ornament may be a survival from Myc. II (cf. the early alabastra, Pros- ymna, II, figs. 687, 689; Ch.T., pl.V, 7). The ser- rated rim is paralleled only on a pithoid jar (one of a linked pair) from a chamber tomb on Karpathos (AE-r., XVII A, 1961-1962, pl. 26a, f, 8, 1, p. 68, no. 97) which the excavator considers was cut after discovery, clearly not the case with our example. Curiously, the Karpathos tomb belongs to the same chronological range as many of our Agora tombs, immediately after the destruction of Knossos, but it has a more strongly Minoan flavor (cf. Warrior Graves at Knossos, B.S.A., XLVII, 1952, pp. 243- 277, pls. 50-56). Furthermore the jar no. 97 was cer- tainly ritual, being one of a pair with a connecting tube (cf. Evans, T.D.A., pp. 32-33, fig. 46, 6a), and it is likely that ours also had a ritual significance because of its association in the same tomb with the pierced hydria. Although the pomegranate is known in Mycenaean art in metalwork,2 this is the first recorded instance of its occurrence as a shape in Mycenaean pottery. Interestingly enough, the shape is known in the Late Geometric period,3 when according to Jacobsthal it was introduced from Cyprus.4 More pertinent to the period of our vase are the faience examples found in Eighteenth Dynasty Egyptian tombs5 and the im- ported polychrome glass examples found in Late Cypriote II tombs at Enkomi in Cyprus along with imported Mycenaean pottery.6 The question of sur- vival, or revival, of the pomegranate pot from 1 Ake Akerstrom who examined this vase with me in 1961 agreed on this point and had no doubt concerning the Myc.

GRAVE AT NORTHWEST CORNER OF STOA (Q 7:5) P1. 54 This simple pit or cist grave (P1. 54)1 set deeply down, ca. 1.50 meters below the surface, into bedrock at the extreme north end of the Stoa within the colonnade and only a few meters to the east of XXII was discovered by Stoa workmen in July, 1954. Excavation revealed a single skeleton,2 extended, with head to east, and legs bent up at the knees, the arms folded over the abdomen. Two pots placed beside the left thigh were the only offerings. From the style of the better preserved pot (XXVII-1), a simple monochrome jug with cut-away neck, this burial should probably be placed in the Myc. III B period, and certainly not before the end of Myc. III A. It is thus one of our later burials, and a poor one. 1 For the distinction between pit and cist graves, see above, pp. 103-104.

GRAVE XXVIII: CIST GRAVE OPPOSITE PIER 21 (Q 7:4) Pis. 54, 65, 77; Plan: P1. 87 A cist grave with a northeast to southwest orientation, lying about 0.75 m. below the bot- tom of the Stoa conglomerate foundations (P1. 54) and about five meters southwest of Grave XXVII, was discovered in April, 1954. Although only the south side and the west end could be certainly fixed, the dimensions as exposed (1.30 m. by 0.60 m.) agree with those of our other cist graves;1 furthermore, tumbled in the grave were three rough stone slabs, presumably from a covering.2 A single skeleton lay in order, with feet to west and legs bent at the knees to fit into the space.3 A conical stone button at the waist and an angular alabastron were the only offerings. From the evidence of the latter, this grave should be dated not much before the end of Myc.

GRAVE XXIX: ARTISAN'S GRAVE (P-Q 7-8:1) Pls. 55, 77; Plan: P1. 89 Discovered in March, 1954, this grave lies deep beneath the foundations of the Stoa terrace about opposite Pier 20 and to the west of the Room with the Ballot-Box.l It was of an unusual type, conforming neither to our pit nor to our cist graves,2 and consisted of two parts. The outer part was a rectangular pit (2.10 by 1.30 m.) cut down in the soft bedrock to a depth of ca. 0.90 m., with both long sides walled with feldstones, leavng ela passage only 0.45 m. wide in the middle. This narrow space was full of gray earth and clay with no trace of bones or any offerings, although the base of a goblet (XXIX-1) was embedded in the stones of the north side. The in- ner part of the grave was revealed when the stone packing along the north side had been removed. The cutting in bedrock was seen to extend well beyond the stones, forming a rec- tangular cist (1.50 by 2.0 by 0.90 m. deep). Along the north side lay a skeleton3 with head to the northeast, legs slightly flexed at the knees, and hands crossed over the chest (PI. 55). Beyond the head was the plain pitcher (XXIX-2), two bone objects, a steatite celt, and a steatite mould for making jewelry (XXIX-3). The pot is too nondescript in style to give a definitive date, but it does not appear to be early, either the end of Myc. III A, or more probably Myc. III B. Aside from the uncanonical form of grave, the greatest interest attaches to the unusual group of offerings (XXIX-3 to 6) which suggest the burial of an artisan with his tools of trade.

GRAVE XXX: CIST GRAVE IN NORT'HWEST CORNER OF STOA TERRACE (Q 8:13) P1. 55; Plan: P1. 87 This burial, which was found in December, 1953, is situated in the Stoa Terrace a few meters to the south of Grave XXIX. It consisted merely of an adult skeleton lying in an ex- tended position with head to east and the left leg slightly flexed at the knee (P1. 55).1 No offerings were found in the grave, nor was its exact form determined, although it seemed to be a cist about 1.60 m. long by 0.70 m. wide. Since Protogeometric sherds were found on the stones which overlay the burial (covering slabs ?), and since some Mycenaean sherds2 were found in the immediate vicinity, the burial is most probably to be assigned to this period, and is thus part of the thick concentration of Mycenaean tombs and graves in the area. 1 AA 168 analyzed by Angel as F. of 30. 2 Fragments of two Mycenaean kylikes with pale red glaze wash inside and out (probably Furumark, M.P., Type 263; cf.

Tomb XXXI, the northernmost of four small chamber tombs clustered densely around Pier 12 within the Stoa colonnade, was discovered in September, 1953, and was briefly reported in the Annual Report.' The northern part of the tomb had been cut away by the foundation 1 See also J.H.S., LXXIV, 1954, p. 146, fig. 3, a. 232</page><page sequence="250">TOMBS AND OBJECTS: TOMB XXXI trench for the south stylobate of the Square Building that preceded the Stoa, and the dromos, if one existed, must have been lost in this operation. The chamber was small with an original east- west dimension of 1.60 m. and a preserved north-south dimension of 1.20 m., the walls preserved to a maximum height of 0.90 m. A single skeleton2 lay in some disorder in the eastern part with its head to the south. Beneath the skull were slight traces of black, either from burning or from the decay of organic matter.3 The offerings consisted only of two vases, both datable to the end of Myc. II B or earliest Myc. III A:1.4 Although it might be argued from the single interment and the absence of any preserved dromos that this was a pit grave,5 the location of the body along the edge of the cutting would seem rather to indicate a small chamber tomb that has been cut away at the north.6 XXXI-1.

Rim and outside of handle glazed; groups of bands on spout, neck, and at foot; running quirk below plastic band at top of shoulder; four large stemmed spirals with feathery leaf pattern on upper body. Furumark, M.P., Type 144 (p. 30, fig. 5), Myc. III A:1; Mot. 49: 1 (p. 363, fig. 62), Myc. III A:1. The shape is close to the earlier more elegant form (of. VII-17 and XXIII-2) with pronounced plastic band and a reminiscence of the foliate band in the run- ning quirk (Mot. 48: 5, p. 360, fig. 61). About con- temporary, or a little earlier, than the new nautilus ewer (XL-6). The simpler curve-stemmed spiral is found on a ewer from Ialysos (C.V.A., Br. Mus., IIIa, pl. 4, 3) but here it has taken on a living quality with some details borrowed from floral patterns (cf. "lily," Mot. 9: 16, p. 258, fig. 32). In this respect it allies itself with a whole group of ewers which combine spiral, floral and sometimes marine elements like the nautilus in bold free-field arrangements (cf. Salamis ewer, A.J.A., LIV, 1950, pls. I, V; Schefold, Meisterwerke, p. 118, figs. 21-23). In its rather careless rendering it is particularly close to the Chalkis ewer with lily (Chal- kis, pl. 24, 412) and to the ewer with lily in private possession (Schefold, op.cit., fig. 22). A northern provincial origin for these ewers is a distinct possi- bility. See also pp. 133-134, 143. Myc. II B-III A:1. XXXI-2. Kantharos with Spiral Band. P1. 55. P 23588.

The shape, which is rare in the Mycenaean re- pertory, seems an evolution from the Minyan kan- tharos which became less angular in Yellow Minyan ware. By the Late Helladic period there was a further softening of profile, perhaps under the influence of the teacup shape which sometimes had one high- swung or ring handle (M.P., Types 237 or 241, p. 48, fig. 13). The disconnected or poorly connected tangent spirals also have early parallels (cf. Prosymna, II, fig. 674, an L.H. II goblet) although carelessly drawn ones could produce this effect at any period; these, however, look quite neat. See also pp. 130, 143. Myc.

The dimensions of the chamber are 1.60 m. east-west by a preserved length of 1.40 m. north-south. The walls were preserved to a height of 0.065 m., and the grave was full of broken bedrock with a little soft brown silt around the bones. The broken bedrock plus the presence of more than one burial is certain in- dication of a chamber tomb rather than a pit grave. The two skeletons1 lay along the east side, more or less in order, with the bones resting directly on the bedrock floor.

TOMB XXXIII: CHAMBER TOMB SOUTHEAST OF PIER 12 (Q 10:5) P1. 56; Plan: P1. 89 Lying immediately to the east of Tomb XXXII, this small chamber tomb was likewise dis- covered in September, 1953. As finally cleared the chamber was roughly rectanglar, measuring 1.70 m. by 1.40 m., and was cut down to within 0.65 m. by the construction of the Square Building. A rectangular cutting at the northwest comer may have been the entrance, although this cutting may be later; the southwest corer of the chamber appeared to have been unfinished. 234</page><page sequence="252">TOMBS AND OBJECTS: TOMB XXXV Across the north end lay the single skeleton of a child with head to east, lying on its back with knees doubled up.1 The body was laid on a thin layer of brown clay. No offerings and no trace of bones were found in the rest of the chamber, which had been somewhat disturbed in Classical times. Although no offerings were found, its proximity to XXXI and XXXII might suggest an early date in Myc. III A. 1 AA 158, analyzed by Angel as C. of 9. TOMB XXXIV: CHAMBER TOMB AT SOUTHWEST CORNER, PIER 12 (Q 10:6) P1. 56; Plan: P1. 88 Lying to the west of XXXII, this tomb was discovered at the same time as the others in this group. The entire north side of the chamber had been cut away by Stoa Pier 12 (P1. 56), and most of the depth by leveling operations in connection with the Square Building, so that the greatest preserved depth was only 0.25 m. What remained of the chamber measured 1.30 m. east-west by 0.90 m. north-south. Despite the disturbance two skeletons were found in order as far as their thighs, lying in a north-south position with their heads to the south; the east skeleton lay on its right side with the right hand under the head, the left over the chest;' the west skeleton had the left arm raised to its chin, the right arm at its side.2 There was no trace of offerings of any kind, but these may have been in the north part which was demol- ished by the Stoa pier. This tomb is probably contemporary with the others in this group (XXXI-XXXIV), early in Myc. III A. I AA 161 analyzed by Angel as F. of 40. 2 AA 162, M. of 51. TOMB (?) XXXV: DISTURBED BURIAL NEAR PIER 12 (Q 9:1) P1. 56 In May, 1950, during an earlier campaign of excavation of the Stoa, a disturbed burial was found in the trench for the east stylobate of the Square Building. Lying just north of Tomb XXXIII, it seems to have been a part of the group of small chamber tombs clustered around Pier 12. It was so badly disturbed by the Classical builders that it is impossible to tell anything about the plan, whether it was a small chamber tomb or a pit grave. Five fragmentary pots and a few human bones were found.1 1 The bones were discarded. Although it might be argued that the pottery of this deposit came from one of the near-by tombs without offerings (XXXIII or XXXIV), this does not seem likely. In the case of XXXIII the north wall of the chamber was preserved, so that the pottery could only have come from the dromos. XXXV-1. Fragmentary Jug with Cut-away Neck. P1. 56. P 20686.

In July, 1949, three Mycenaean pots were found in a small rectangular cutting to the east of the Stoa, a little to the south of the group of tombs clustered around Pier 12. The cutting measured only 0.50 by 0.40 m. Although there was no sign of bones, it was almost certainly a grave, perhaps that of a child whose bones had completely disintegrated.1 This small grave group has been briefly noted in the Annual Report.

POTTERY FROM DESTROYED TOMBS UNDER THE STOA OF ATTALOS (P-R 6-12) Pls. 57, 76 It is unlikely that the area between Pier 20, with Tombs XXIII and XXIV, and Pier 12, with the four chamber tombs XXXI-XXXIV and the disturbed burial XXXV, did not contain more Mycenaean graves or tombs, which have been completely destroyed in the construction of the Square Building and the Stoa of Attalos. A number of Mycenaean sherds and frag- mentary vases were discovered in 1949 in the construction fill of the Stoa, particularly in the region of Piers 17 and 18, but also somewhat further to the south in the area of Pier 15.1 Although no longer in their closed contexts, these fragments have more significance than the casual miscellaneous find, and are here included using the running serial numbers of our Catalogue. 413.

THE BURIALS IN THE SOUTH-CENTRAL AREA (XXXVll-XLI) Three cist or pit graves, which were found in the area between the Middle Stoa and the Odeion during the campaigns of 1935 and 1952, did not connect closely with any of the other groups of tombs. In 1965 during further investigation of the South Square a fine early chamber tomb with the remains of two wooden coffins (XL) and a late and poor well burial (XLI) were discovered, and it now appears that these are the remnants of a much vaster cemetery which covered the whole region, others having been destroyed with the cutting down and levelling of the central part of the Agora. 2839</page><page sequence="257">MYCENAEAN PERIOD: CATALOGUE GRAVE XXXVII: CIST GRAVE (M 12:1) Pis. 58, 76; Plan: P1. 82 Hesperia, V, 1936, pp. 21-23. Discovered in February, 1935, this was one of the first Mycenaean burials found in the Agora, and was briefly published in the Annual Report. It consisted of a rectangular cist, care- fully cut with vertical sides and a flat bottom, measuring 1.90 m. by 0.55 m. by 0.48-50 m. deep. There were apparently originally covering slabs, but these were missing. The grave had been disturbed in Roman times and again by a Turkish bothros which cut into it and sliced away about one-half of the three-handled jar (XXXVII-1).1 The skeleton was well preserved from the head to the pelvis, but the feet and lower legs were disarranged and the thigh bones apparently removed by the Romans.2 The skeleton lay on its back with the head turned to the left and the right arm flexed across the chest, the fingers clutching the left upper arm. The left arm was raised vertically toward the surface, and the hand had been cut off above the wrist and was found lying close to the right hand.3 From the evidence of the two vases, particularly the fine but fragmentary ewer with nautilus decoration (XXXVII-2), the grave should be dated to the Myc. III A:l period at the beginning of the fourteenth century.4 XXXVII-1. Three-handled Jar. P1. 58. P 4646. Hesperia, V, 1936, p. 22, fig. 20; I.L.N., Oct. 19, 1935, p. 647, fig. 1.

GRAVE (M 12:2) P1. 58 Hesperia, V, 1936, p. 23. In March, 1935, during clearing operations of the slope leading up to the terrace wall in front of the Middle Stoa, a skeleton was discovered lying with head to the northwest and legs drawn up.' The grave seems to have been simply a hole dug either in bedrock or in hard green fill, and the excavators were unable to fix its limits. Not a single object of any sort was found in the grave, but if the offerings were at the feet they would have been disturbed by a late Turkish pit, and if at the head by the builders of the so-called "Burnt Building."2 The only clue to the date of the burial is its similarity to the nearby cist grave XXXVII. 1 AA 35, analyzed by Angel as F. of 38. 2 485-487, which are presented below under "Mycenaean Pottery without Significant Context" might possibly be associated with this burial. GRAVE XXXIX: CHILD'S PIT GRAVE (N 12:1) Pls. 58, 66; Plan: P1. 87 A third small grave about ten meters to the northeast of XXXVII was discovered in May, 1952. It consisted of a shallow rectangular cutting in bedrock about 1.40m. by 0.70m., but it was probably somewhat bigger, since the east side and a large part of the north side had been cut away by later builders.' It contained a single burial, that of a small child,2 laid lengthwise in the grave along the south side. Only the skull was preserved in position. A kylix (XXXIX-1) and a small jug (XXXIX-2) were found along the west side of the grave, and a feeding bottle (XXXIX-3) was to the right of the skull. Many minute glass beads were found under the skull and around the feeding bottle, and doubtless came from a necklace worn by the child. From the early form of the kylix the grave ought not to be later than the Myc. III A:1 or early III A:2 period. See also pp. 103-104. 1 For the burial of a small child this was fairly large and it thus conforms more with the Lily Bowl Grave (XVI), a generous cist or shaft, than with the true cist form with adult burial of XVII, XIX, and XXXVII. 2 AA 171, analyzed by Angel as C of 5 and a half, male (?). The necklace, however, ought to indicate a female: cf. the child buried in the Lily Bowl Grave. XXXIX-1. Kylix with High-swung Handles. Pls. 58, 66. P 22313.

TOMB XL: TOMB WITH COFFINS (N 12:4) Pls. 59, 75; Plan: P1. 90 Hesperia, XXXV, 1966, pp. 55-78. In the summer of 1965 a new chamber tomb under the terrace of the Middle Stoa was dis- covered during final probing of the area,l and was excavated by Homer Thompson and lEmily Vermeule. With John Travlos Mrs. Vermeule has published a full account of the tomb and its contents.2 Not only was it remarkably well preserved because of the early collapse of the roof and the absence of subsequent disturbance, thus allowing us to draw our fullest evidence for the sequence of burials, but it also had the unusual feature that two burials had been made in wooden coffins. The tomb was entered from the west by a stepped dromos,3 at least 4.20 m. long by 1.10 to 1.50 m. wide, splaying slightly toward the doorway, which was 1.26 m. high by 0.60m. wide at the base with a lightly arched top. The doorway was found blocked with a stone packing, which included near its top a broken conglomerate grave marker (XL-15), and which proved to have been erected at least three times; during one of the occasions of reopening, the door- way was widened 0.20 m. to the north.4 The chamber, while described as a "small irregular trapezoid," is of about average size and actually quite rectangular by Agora standards.5 As in most cases, it is broader than deep (2.72 m. by 1.75 m.). Although the roof had collapsed, the walls were preserved to an average height of 1.35 m. Four burials were found undisturbed laid out parallel with an east-west direction, in all but one case facing the door. They were numbered A to D in the order of excavation,6 but fallen 1 Homer A.

Since the article stands as a definitive publication, the results will be merely summarized here and the Catalogue presented in abbreviated form but with fuller reference to our other material. The same numerical sequence is adhered to but with the prefix XL. 3 Cf. ibid., p. 56, for evidence of a gully which ran south-north in Late Helladio times, and which would apparently have separated our group XXXVII-XLI from the group near the Temple of Ares (VII-XII). In that group, too, the dromos of the Ares Tomb (VII) led in from the west, indicating the existence of another gully between the Kolonos Agoraios and the more central part of the Agora. Only the diminutive Tomb XIII is described as having two steps at the north end of its steep dromos. 4 Ibid., p. 59, for careful description of evidence from stomion and dromos. 5 The size, as Mrs. Vermeule indicates (p. 59), is about average for the Agora (see above, p. 99); in rectangulaty itis exceeded only by Tombs I and III. Even in the Argolid neat rectangular chambers were not the general rule (cf. Prosymna, II, plans 2-6, 9-13, 17, 20-23, 27-34, 37-38). 6 Burial A (AA 297) analyzed by Angel as adult female "with four to seven births to her credit;" Burial B (AA 298) boy of 13 to 15; Burial C (AA 299) man of 53 "slightly above average height for a Mycenaean;" Burial D (AA 300) young man of about 20. Cf. Hesperia, XXXV, 1966, pp. 61-66. 242</page><page sequence="260">TOMBS AND OBJECTS: TOMB XL bedrock and differences of level indicate that Burial B was the latest, A next, and C and D the earliest, and presumably contemporary. The greatest interest attaches to the remains of rot- ted white wood which surrounded both these skeletons, and was especially well preserved in Burial D. These fibrous remains seem certainly to represent coffins rather than biers,7 perhaps rough unsmoothed boxes of cypress or pine measuring 1.65 m. long by 0.45 m. broad and about 0.40-0.43 m. high.8 Mrs. Vermeule has given a full account of the evidence for coffin burials in Mycenaean times9 and has stressed the close analogy with the wooden coffin from Katsabae0 and the less well-preserved remains of coffins in the Warrior Graves near Knossos.11 These belong to a period approximately contemporary with or very little earlier than our tomb, which from its pottery must be dated to Myc. III A:1.12 Although there were four burials, these must have taken place within a generation of a single family. With the help of the skeletal analyses of J. Lawrence Angel, Mrs. Vermeule reconstructs the history as follows. The father (C) and son (D) were buried at the same time, having died in battle or the hunt and "brought home from the field in hastily constructed boxes" or possibly the victims of a disease "which made it desirable that they be kept in coffins until a tomb could be excavated for them,"l3 then, after a slight fall of the roof, the mother (A) at the opposite side of the doorway, and finally, after a more serious slide, the adolescent boy (B) in front of the doorway. The funeral offerings consisted of eleven vases, all datable to Myc. III A:l, a long bronze spearhead (XL-5) which together with the fine nautilus krater (XL-3) rested on the lid of D's coffin, two steatite buttons (XL-4 and 14, the latter from the dromos), an amygdaloid amber bead (XL-16) and an engraved carnelian sealstone (XL-17), both from the left wrist of D, and an anomalous scrap of ivory (XL-18). Is it not curious that Burial D, the son, had the richest offerings ? The pottery from this tomb which belongs to the same period as the wealthier or "princely" Tomb of the Ivory Pyxides is a welcome addition to that beautiful phase of Mycenaean termed "Agorastil" by Schachermeyr.l4 In contrast to the large and mostly imported pots of Tomb I, the vases here may be the work of local Attic potters. For the strap-handled kraters (XL-3 and 11) as well as the little amphoras (XL-1 and 8) this seems likely; perhaps less so for the fine ewer (XL-6), the stippled teacups (XL-7 and 9), and the stemmed kylikes (XL-12 and 13), although as Mrs. Vermeule notes, there is a certain imperfection in all of these.15 Through its series of characteristic III A:1 shapes, this tomb with its short history helps to define a given period in certain other Agora tombs with less strictly closed contexts: through the ewer the early to middle burials of the Ares Tomb (cf. VII-17) and the earlier burials in Tomb XXIII (cf. XXIII-1 and 2); through the stippled teacups the disturbed Tomb X (X-4); through the kraters the destroyed tombs along the Kolonos Agoraios (cf. 411 and 412). See also pp. 98-102. 7 See especially ibid., pp. 62-64, for the location of the wood in relation to the bones. Significant also was the high position of the krater (XL-3) which apparently toppled over from the lid of coffin D and was held above Burial C by the lid of his coffin (see N-S section; Hesperia, XXXV, 1966, p. 58, fig. 2; also photograph, our P1. 59, with vases returned after mending). 8 For the analysis of the wood and the probable dimensions see ibid., pp. 65-66. Perhaps significantly, the dimensions of several of our cist graves (XVII, XIX, XXXVII) correspond very closely to the measurements of the coffins, that is no larger than was necessary for an adult burial. 9 Ibid., pp. 69-72. 10 Kpiyr.

Both conical and conical piriform examples (Furumark, M.P., Type 7) were found in the Atreus bothros (B.S.A., LIX, 1964, pp. 248-249); on these the loop design at the base of the handle is "almost standard." The absence of this canonical feature and the fabric, which resembles that of 412, suggest a local origin. See further re- marks on this shape in discussion of the Altar Krater (425).

This is perhaps the finest of the Agora ewers, and I rather doubt that it was a local product, as Mrs. Vermeule is inclined to believe. The rendering of the nautilus, particularly the drawing of the spirals with their fine inner convolutions in dilute glaze, contrasts markedly with those on the krater XL-3.

THE NON-SEPULCHRAL MYCENAEAN DEPOSITS About three-quarters of the Mycenaean pottery from the Agora comes from tombs and graves; the remainder, which is much more fragmentary, comes from deposits which are chronologically less exact and more mixed in character. There are, in general, two types of non- 1 According to Homer Thompson, this well burial does not necessarily represent a primary interment, since the remains seem to have been deposited as bones rather than as a body. Quoting from a letter of August 8, 1967: "The shaft was cut through the soft rock to a depth of 2.75 m., ending in a stratum of harder rock. Diameter at mouth 1.00 m. contracting slightly below. To a depth of ca. 0.60 m. the mouth of the well had been filled with large fieldstones. From among these stones came the fragments of the kylix (P 27430) and a handful of other L.H. III sherds. Below the stones, at a depth of ca. 1.50 m., lay many of the bones of a human skeleton; the remains had apparently been deposited as bones rather than as a body. Ac- cording to J. L. Angel they derived from a middle-aged male. The fill below the bones was brown clay, which yielded only a very few small sherds and no complete vase." (I have not been able to examine the sherd evidence, and therefore any conclusions concerning this burial must be regarded as tentative. S.A.I.) 247</page><page sequence="265">MYCENAEAN PERIOD: CATALOGUE sepulchral deposits: three pits and bothroi at the northeast corner (0 7:14, 0 7:4, and P 8:9), which contain a mixture of material, some early and fine in quality and ranking with the best examples from the chamber tombs in the area, the rest coarse household ware, in general later in date and resembling rather the dromos fill of Tomb XII (above pp. 196-199). In addition, there are four wells, two in the central Agora (K 6:1 and H 11:2) and two near the Klepsydra (V 24:1 and S 27:7), which are almost entirely later in character than the pottery from the tombs, and two stratified deposits, one (0-Q 16-17) in connection with an ancient road across the south side of the Agora, the other (T 26-27:2) beneath the paved court of the Klepsydra at the northwest corner of the Acropolis. The most important material from these deposits will be published according to deposit, but using our running serial numbers. In conclusion, we add twenty additional items without significant context which help to round out our picture of the pottery of Mycenaean Athens. PITS AND BOTHROI MYCENAEAN GULLY AND DEPOSIT IN FRONT OF NORTHEAST STOA (0 7:14) 425-431; Pls. 60, 66-67, 79 This rather enigmatic complex discovered in June, 1951, produced several fragmentary Mycenaean vases which are among the finest from the Agora, along with much coarse ware and many animal bones which give it the character of a refuse deposit. It consisted of a series of irregular pits, some gradually linked up with one another to form what semed a natural glly. The largest pit measuring 1.70m. east-west by about 1.20m. north-south and having a maximum depth of 0.90 m. was situated from five to ten meters northeast of the gully proper and was cut at the north by the back wall of the Northeast Stoa, which was set down a little into it. It was here that the Altar Krater (425), the kylix with octopus (42), and the fragmentary ewer (427) as well as some considerably later material, for example the tankard (429), were found. The gully itself ran in a southwesterly direction and yielded about twenty small painted sherds, fragmentary cooking pots (cf. 441 from 0 7:4), unglazed kylix stems, fragments from pithoi and other coarse pots, as well as part of a stone grinder and many animal bones. Apparently in both pit and gully we are dealing with a mixed fill, not of one homogeneous phase, and consisting partly of household refuse. Because of its proximity to the chamber tombs (especially Tombs XIII-XV) and because of the exceptional quality of several of the vases, it seems likely that some of the material came from disturbed tombs.

In shape the Altar Krater belongs with a whole group of early strap-handled kraters, some with ab- stract decoration and others with pictorial scenes. Its early date has not always been recognized, partly because of its fragmentary character and incomplete restoration, which even in the latest attempt is not altogether successful.' The total effect can be ap- preciated better in the complete example with ar- gonauts or nautili from Tomb XL where the height and diameter are about equal, as seems to have been generally true for this shape.2 Mrs. Vermeule in publishing the argonaut krater (XL-3) has, I think, unduly stressed the rarity of this shape, both in Greece and in Cyprus, for there are a number of early examples with abstract decoration from Cyprus,3 and the Window Krater from Kourion (J.H.S., LXXVII, 1957, pp. 269-271) has fellows in the new kraters from Pyla (Fasti Archaeologici, VII, 1952, p. 132, fig. 4) and Enkomi (A.J.A., LXII, 1958, pl. 98, 1); the Homage Krater from Aradippo (ibid., pl. 99, 3-4) should not be much later. I do not believe she is right in doubting the early date of the Markopoulo krater with palms and dancing women ('Ep. 'Apx., 1895, pl. 10, 9)4 or the krater from Vourvatsi (Attica, pl. 10, 1), although these have a certain provincial quality, which she has recognized in XL-3, and which ally them more with the Koukounara group with birds (Epyov, 1963, p. 87, figs. 89-91). 1 Dated L.H. III C in Hesperia, XXIV, 1955, p. 203; cor- rectly to the fourteenth century in Archaeology, III, 1951, p. 223. The photographs on P1. 60 show three stages in its restoration: as it was first mended, with the break filled in with plaster and the base flattened off (giving the erroneous impression of the Myc. III B loop-handled krater in propor- tions), and finally after an attempt to restore the lower part correctly, which should however have been protracted further to a smaller base, resulting in a conical to conical piriform profile (cf. XL- and XL-11). 2 The average size of these kraters is from 0.30 m. to 0.35 m. in height and diameter, but the Window Krater was 0.428 m. in height. 3 C.V.A., Br. Mus., II Cb, pls. 8, 7; 9, 7; 10, 12; 11, 19, etc. 4 I examined the Markopoulo krater in the summer of 1964 through the courtesy of Mrs. Sakellariou at the National Museum. It is in very bad preservation, and the painting is disappointing, but not therefore necessarily late. It seems to me to belong to a provincial group of more careless pic- torial vases. In technique the Altar Krater ranks with the finest Mycenaean examples of the pictorial style, making use of three methods of rendering details (cf. the detailed photograph P1. 60, which was taken soon after discovery): fine outline drawing in the palms, reserved detail in the legs of the altar, superimposed white in the horns of consecration, the altar table and the trilobate tops of the palms. The second technique is rare, but may be a carry-over from the sponge-print pattern of Myc. II (M.P., Mot. 31, p. 323, fig. 54), whereas the superimposed white, while being a mark of quality at all periods, was especially characteristic of certain early pictorial vases, e.g., the so-called "Zeus Krater" from Enkomi (A.J.A., LXII, 1958, pl. 98, 2) and the Maroni chariot krater in the Metropolitan Museum (A.J.A., XLIX, 1945, pp. 544 f., figs. 8-10). The scene represents a Minoan-Mycenaean altar with horns of consecration and an upright shaft which must have supported a double axe,6 the whole flanked by elaborate floral patterns which belong to Furumark's Palm II type (Mot. 15, p. 279, fig. 39). Derived from glyptic prototypes (goldwork, ivory, and seals), these are found on several other early Myc. III A: 2 vases: under the handles of a fine early chariot krater from Enkomi (Sjoqvist, Problems, p. 70, fig. 19, 1) and on a conical rhyton from My- cenae (B.M.Cat., I, 1, A 1067, 1), both of which have the asymmetrical tops of our palms. A less exact parallel is found on the pierced hydria from Ialysos (cited in note 5) which combines the palm with horns of consecration and double axe as on our krater, the whole conveying the idea of an altar in a sacred grove, in the case of the pierced vase with a definite ritual significance (see above, pp. 227-228). A much later survival of the same theme has been suggested by Blegen for a Myc. III B loop-handled krater from the Argive Heraion (Prosymna, I, p. 451, pl. VIII, 231). Another vase related to ours is the fragmentary krater from Enkomi (B.M.Cat., I, 1, C 401; C.V.A., Br. Mus., II Cb, pl. 11, 16) with boukrania, horns of consecration and double axes, a vase which has been incorrectly analyzed as a loop-handled krater and accordingly dated to Myc. III B.6 While less fine and presumably a little later than the Altar Krater, it is still good Myc. III A work. Despite the number of parallels cited to early pictorial vases found in Cyprus, I feel no hesitation in claiming an Argolid workshop both for our vase and for them, an opinion which is now shared by a number 5 Mylonas (see above, note 340) would like to restore a palm, but this seems unlikely, although the hydria from Ialysos alternates double axe with palms in the horns of consecration (lalysos, p. 130, fig. 51). 6 See above note 344. I have examined this vase through the kindness of the British Museum authorities, and there is absolutely no question that it was a krater of the strap- handled type. 249</page><page sequence="267">MYCENAEAN PERIOD: CATALOGUE of scholars and is supported by technological examina- tion of the clay.7 As an example of the more canonical standards of the Altar Krater in comparison with XL3, one might note the differences in handle treatment (cf. Pls. 59, 60). The broader handle with ladder pattern, the characteristic loop formed by a continuation of the exterior banded edge, and the clear separation of the handle area from the pictorial scene are all to be found both on the Altar and the Window Krater, but not on XL-3.

Each side of bowl decorated with a large octopus having four pairs of tentacles forming undulating loops by handles; superimposed white dots on ten- tacles. Furumark, M.P., Type 256 (p. 60, fig. 16), Myc. III A:2e; Mot. 21: 3-4, 14 (pp. 308, 305, figs. 48-49), Myc. III A: 1-2 e. In shape this is the early deep-bowled kylix which is represented in only a few sherds from the Atreus deposit (B.S.A., LIX, 1964, p. 250 and fig. 2, 7-8) but occurs in several examples from Vourvatsi (Attica, pl. 4, 9, 11). With octopus decoration it was very popular in Rhodes (C.V.A., Copenhagen, IIIa, pl. 50, 1-7; Br. Mus., IIIa, pl. 5, 24, 26, 29-30), where, however, the four pairs of tentacles were usually abridged to two. Particularly close to ours is the kylix in Brussels (C.V.A., Brussels, IIIa, pl. 3, 2), unfortunately without provenance. The octopus with four pairs of tentacles and superimposed white is also found on kraters of the pictorial style (cf. S.C.E., I, pl. CXX, 3-4 and C.V.A., Br. Mus., II C b, pl. 9, 2). The association of this kylix in the same deposit with the Altar Krater suggests that they may both have come from the same workshop. See also pp. 127, 146. Myc.

MYCENAEAN BOTHROS OPPOSITE STOA PIER 17 (P 8:9) 432; PIs. 61, 75 Lying only a few meters to the north and in a line with Tomb XX was a small irregular pit about 1.30 m. in diameter and 1.50 m. deep, presumably a bothros. The fill was entirely Mycenaean, but represented an odd assortment of material: fragments of roof tiles and a large chunk of stone, fragmentary cooking pots on tripod legs, large coarse pots including the frag- ment of a pithos, twenty to thirty kylix fragments ranging from a fine yellow fabric to very coarse reddish ware, and a few small fragments of painted ware. Among the last was the frag- mentary Myc. III A cup with wishbone handle (432), two small fragments of Myc. III B kylikes with vertical murex decoration, a fragmentary three-handled jar with scale pattern, and some rim fragments from open bowls with horizontal handles. It would thus seem to contain domestic refuse ranging from the fourteenth into the thirteenth century, with the possibility that some of the finer fragments might have infiltrated from the adjacent chamber tombs when they were opened for subsequent burials. Although there is less fine ware, the contents of this bothros agree in the main with those from the Mycenaean Gully and Deposit in front of the Northeast Stoa (0 7:14) and would suggest domestic habitation somewhere in the area.

It was full of Mycenaean sherds and fragmentary pots, mostly kylikes, but also contained occasional scraps of bone and several small stone slabs lying in no order. Originally termed a grave, there is nothing in favor of this identification and much that argues against it. The size would be very cramped even for the burial of a child, no skeleton or certain human bones were found, the pottery was found in complete disorder and included single fragments of some vases, including the leg of a tripod cooking pot (441) like those found in the Mycenaean Bothros (P 8:9) and the Pit in front of the Northeast Stoa (O 7:14). Although a number of more or less complete kylikes were found, these were all extremely coarse and of careless workmanship, and there is no reason to believe they were not chipped or minus a handle when they were discarded. Therefore the identification as a refuse pit seems more likely, and one might note the similarity of material to that found in the dromos of the unfinished chamber tomb XII, which seems to be somewhat later in date.

JLLS WELL NORTH OF TEMPLE OF ARES (K 6:1) 443-445; P1. 61 This small well which lies about 20 meters northeast of Tomb VII was discovered in the spring of 1952. Circular in shape with an upper diameter of about 0.80 m., it was only 2.20 m. deep; however, water was struck between 1.40 and 1.80 m. below the surface of bedrock. The 253</page><page sequence="271">MYCENAEAN PERIOD: CATALOGUE coarse jug (443), which was intact except for a small chip, was found at a depth of 1.60 m. The rest of the fill was fragmentary and consisted of much coarse ware and very little decorated. Nothing was later than the Mycenaean period, and there were a few earlier pieces, including one Gray Minyan fragment. The existence of a Mycenaean well in this area, when taken with the evidence of domestic refuse in the three deposits further to the east (O 7:4, 0 7:14, and P 8:9) would suggest a Mycenaean settlement along the north side of the Agora.

Cf. fragments from the Fountain (Fountain, p. 386, fig. 67,1, m) which are probably earlier (Myc. III A ?) than the bulk of the fill.

This small well was discovered in the spring of 1938 in the middle of the easternmost room of the North Archaic House adjacent to the Tholos. It was circular with a diameter at the mouth of ca. 2.30 m. narrowing down at 3.00 m. to 0.85 m., giving a hopper-shaped effect to the upper part. The pottery which was scanty (a handful of plain sherds and the pitcher 446) began at 3.65 m., and at 4.75 m. the well came to an abrupt end. The location of a Mycenaean well in this area is somewhat surprising, since we have no other evidence for the existence of domestic occupation in Mycenaean times along the west side of the Agora, with the exception of the filling of the dromos of the unfinished chamber tomb XII, other possible indications of domestic habitation being clustered at the northeast corner of the Agora.

Many fragments missing; re- stored in plaster. Pale gray buff clay containing much grit; surface smoothed; decoration in dull blackish paint, much worn. Cylindrical neck with flaring slightly thickened rim; squat biconical shape on lightly defined base; round handle lip to shoulder. Two encircling bands around greatest circumference. Furumark, M.P., Type 116 (p. 603), considered Lev.-Myc. III B. The neck is taller and more con- cave than in the usual Myc. III B jug (cf. Zygouries, pp. 168-169, figs. 163-164). Possibly this represents a late Eastern influence comparable to that seen in the kalathos with fish and bird from the Ares Tomb (VII-24) or the Perati influence on the small hydria 482. Probably Myc.

MYCENAEAN WELL (V 24:1) 447-471; Pls. 62-63, 77 Of the twenty-seven prehistoric wells discovered in 1937, 1938 and 1939 on the northwest slopes of the Acropolis, two belonged to the Mycenaean period. The earlier of these is situated about 35 meters down the slope northwest of the exit of the Mycenaean Fountain (see Pls. 91, 92). The well was circular or roughly oval in section (about 1.40 m. east-west by 1.10 m. north- south) decreasing to a diameter of about 0.90 m. in the lower part. It had a depth of 6.20 meters, with water beginning at about 2.50 meters and being copious at 5.00 meters. The bottom of the shaft was rough, blocked by a ledge of rock too hard to cut, which still bears in two places the marks of a pointed tool with which it was tested. About 0.30 m. below a late Roman pit which cut into the north side sherds occurred in fair quantity and the fill seemed to be pure. The fill was unstratified and seems to constitute dump fill from neighboring houses of the Myc. III B period, and is somewhat earlier than the major part of the dump fill of the Fountain. With the possible exception of a large pithos, 464, and the crumpled lead sheathing, 471, there does not seem to be evidence for a use fill. The pottery is presented in the Catalogue in roughly chronological order. See also p. 112. 447. Fragment of Conical Rhyton. P1. 62. P 15527. P.H. 0.041 m., P.W. 0.033 m. Fragment with no finished edge from wall of small fairly straight- sided pot. Fine hard pinkish buff clay, gray at core, polished surface outside, smoothed inside; lustrous red glaze. Fairly straight wall, small diameter, and finished surface inside suggest a conical rhyton. On outside, two horizontal bands, and a pattern of elongated hatched triangles and curving lines, prob- ably part of a floral pattern. Furumark, M.P., Type 199 (p. 67, fig. 20), Myc. I-III B; pattern probably a form of Mot. 11 (p. 265, fig. 34) or 18 (p. 287, fig. 42). From the technique and the shape an early date seems likely. Cf. the less fine example 445 and ref- erences.

From a closed pot with quite broad shoulder and narrow neck. Decoration consists of an encircling 255</page><page sequence="273">MYCENAEAN PERIOD: CATALOGUE band at junction of neck and shoulder, a diagonal guilloche-like pattern consisting of two wavy lines enclosing a row of dots, and a triangular object with a reserved wavy line in the center. Shape: too small to determine what type of jug. Decoration: Furumark, M.P., Mot. 48: 23 (p. 360, fig. 61), Myc. III B. It is impossible to decide about the other pattern, but it has a certain pictorial quality (perhaps the wing of a bird?): cf. M.P., Mot. 7: 22, 26, 28, 29 (p. 253, fig. 30), Myc. III A:2-B. The general effect of neatness and fussiness reminds one of certain Myc. III B pictorial kraters, particular- ly those found in Cyprus but known also on the Greek mainland (see A.J.A., LX, 1956, pp. 187-141, pls. 52-54). Myc.

Probably Furumark, M.P., Type 281 (p. 48, fig. 13), Myc. III B; less likely Types 8-9 (p. 23, fig. 4), Myc. III A:2-B; decoration a variant of Mot. 19: 82, 38, 37 (p. 299, fig. 47), Myc. III A:2. Not definitely a krater with loop handles and pos- sibly a late version of the strap-handled krater: cf. Fountain, p. 862, fig. 39.

Large wall fragment made up of a number of joining pieces which preserves one horizontal loop handle; another small non-joining fragment from handle zone. Fine greenish buff clay with hard polished surface; brownish black glaze, badly worn. Shape either a small piriform jar with three han- dles, or more likely, an amphoriskos. Decoration extremely fine and miniature work, in dilute brown glaze, with thicker black for horizontal bands. Handle glazed, narrow zone of fine net pat- tern in handle zone, framed above and below by broad bands and six fine lines; similar scheme of banding repeated farther down. Although at first suggestive of a three-handled jar of Furumark's Types 44-45 (p. 23, fig. 4), there is too great an area above handle before contraction for neck (cf. with Prosymna, II, fig. 714), and there is no suggestion of tapering toward a piriform base. Furthermore, the miniature net pattern and fine banding suggest the Close style or its antecedents in Myc. III B (e.g. the unusual new amphora from Mycenae, AENT., XVII, 1961-1962, pt. 2, pl. 61). The more likely alternative would seem to be a more globular shape with two loop handles. Cf. the unusual tripod-jar from Pylos (Pylos, I, pp. 412-413, Shape 68, figs. 395-396) which has fine painted decoration "approaching, if not actually of the Close style." on shoulder, and is perhaps related to the small amphoriskos type (M.P.

MYCENAEAN WELL (S 27:7) 472-478; Pls. 63, 67 Discovered in the spring of 1939, this well was situated almost one hundred meters to the southwest of Well V 24:1, only a few meters to the west of the Klepsydra and in the region where the prehistoric wells are most numerous. The shaft was originally almost rectangular, about 1.10 to 1.15 m. on the side, but the sides had collapsed rather badly in the upper 4.00 meters, so that the general impression was that of a circular well with a diameter of about 1.50 m. The well was 6.25 meters deep with a little black hardpan in the bottom and a number of large fragments of small vases, possibly representing a use fill; among these was 472, a frag- mentary late Granary style skyphos. The upper fill to about 1.25 m. was mixed with Byzantine, and contained a Neolithic Red Burnished sherd included in our Neolithic Catalogue (22). Below this there was clean dry bedrock and a purely Mycenaean fill. On the basis of the pottery, particularly that at the bottom which may represent the period of use, this well is later than V 24:1, and belongs with the latest material in the fill of the Fountain, the mature Granary style of Myc. III C. When combined with the evidence from the pits and cuttings under the paved court of the Klepsydra (T 26-27:2), one might conclude that after the serious threat to Athens toward the end of the thirteenth century, which led to the construction of the Fountain, there was a period of relative calm. At this time when the Fountain had fallen into disrepair and was filled up, the inhabitants of the Acropolis were free to draw their water outside, making use of the natural springs at the Klepsydra and of Well S 27:7, which was dug in the area where the water table was high. If these were within the walled area of the Pelargikon (cf. Iakovides, Myc. Acrop., p. 204, fig. 38), the historical picture may be somewhat different.

The examples from Pylos (Pylos, I, pp. 397- 399, Shape 60, figs. 385-386) seem to me earlier than the advent of the true Granary style, those with fine painted decoration (e.g. Nos. 862, 576, 808, 813, 593, and 1150) being more properly latest III B, and those covered with monochrome glaze (Nos. 594 and 1172), usually reddish rather than black, a local phenomenon (the foot and lip being quite different from the true Granary style skyphos).

There is nothing really comparable from the My- cenaean Fountain, although projecting rims of kraters and kalathoi are often decorated with arcs, usually concentric (Fountain, pp. 352, 378, figs. 26, k, n, 54, o, t). The only pithoid jar from the Fountain (p. 387, fig. 68) has five handles and a much higher neck. However, the small pithoid jar with low neck and three handles continued on into Myc. III C (M.P., Type 49, p. 23, fig. 4) and it seems likely that our fragment belonged to such a jar. The fabric is un- usual and certainly late. Myc. III C (?). 476. Neck of Small Jug or Hydria (?).

STRATIFIED FILLS PITS AND CUTTINGS BENEATH PAVED COURT OF KLEPSYDRA (T 26-27:2) 479-482; P1. 64 Hesperia, X, 1941, pp. 7-8; XII, 1943, pp. 205ff., 223. During the investigations of the Classical Klepsydra by the late Arthur W. Parsons in the spring of 1938, two cuttings, an eastern and a western, were discovered beneath the paved court or cistern in front of the Fountain House. These cuttings, one of which measured 2.75 m. by 2.00 m. by 1.60 m. deep, were about 0.80 to 0.85 m. below the floor level of the building. They contained a fill ranging from black loose earth to grayish green sand with early pottery, most of which is latest Mycenaean. Apparently these pits collected the overflow from the Klepsydra. From the evidence of the pottery there was undoubtedly some exploitation of the Klepsydra at the very end of the Mycenaean period, at a time when the Mycenaean Fountain on the Acrop- olis had already fallen into disrepair, and when the near-by Well S 27:7 was in use or had just been abandoned. With the exception of 479 the pottery is in general later than the fill of S 27:7 and makes a transition to that of the Submycenaean Well U 26:4.1 See also p. 112. 479. Fragment of Krater. P1. 64.

Fountain, pp. 377- 379, Shape 8, figs. 59, a, 60. Broneer (p. 379) points out the specifically Attic quality of this shape which seems to combine elements of the kylix and the skyphos. It is apparently a late development, as no examples were found in the houses on the northeast slope of the Acropolis. In decoration our fragment agrees almost exactly with fragments from the Fountain (Fountain, p. 378, 1 This is the opinion of Evelyn Smithson who is publishing the Submycenaean and Protogeometric material. 261</page><page sequence="279">MYCENAEAN PERIOD: CATALOGUE fig. 60, j, k) with the exception of the addition of the cross and dots within the reserved circle. These last two features connect with Submycenaean; cf. the kylix P 17328 from Submycenaean Well U 24:2 which has a central cross within a reserved circle in interior of bowl, and bowl P 24246 with a Submycenaean conical foot which uses a central dot within a reserved circle.

These important excavations beneath the South Road in the area of the Mint and Southeast Fountain House took place in the spring of 1955 and the summer of 1956 and have been referred to in the Annual Report. Two deep exploratory trenches revealed above bedrock a stratified deposit of the Middle and Late Helladic periods with a thickness of about 1.50 meters. Although there were no associated structural remains, the volume of pottery was sufficient to attest habitation within the area later occupied by the Agora or its immediate environs. The traffic-beaten gravelled surfaces imply the existence of a thoroughfare at the south side of the Agora leading toward the Acropolis. The fact that the fill is stratified with the Middle Helladic underlying the Mycenaean shows that it was not a later dump fill and implies the existence of a road from Middle Helladic times onwards. The pottery was very fragmentary, and only a few pieces were individually worth cataloguing, although collectively the evidence is very important. From the lower levels came many fragments of Gray Minyan, a few sherds of Yellow Minyan, much Mattpainted, including a few fine sherds which have been included in the Catalogue (311, 335, 337) as well as many fragments of heavy pithoi and other coarse ware, including cooking pots. There were also some stone quems. From the upper strata, although some Minyan was still present, considerable quantities of Mycenaean were found. Kylix stems were parti- cularly plentiful, many unglazed, some completely covered with glaze, and a few with traces of 262</page><page sequence="280">MYCENAEAN POTTERY WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT CONTEXT banding or painted decoration. There were also a number of fragments of fairly large closed pots, some with painted decoration, but nothing distinctive as to shape or dating. Good lustrous red glaze, however, was present on certain fragments, suggesting a Myc. III A or early III B dating for some of the material. Only a few fragments of skyphoi or material recognizably analogous to the fill of the Mycenaean Fountain were observed. There was also a quantity of coarse pithos and cooking-pot ware, including one tripod leg. In general the material seems to have an earlier range than the fill of the Mycenaean Fountain and is closer to that found in the rubbish deposits at the northeast corner of the Agora (O 7:14 and P 8:9); however te material is much more fragmentary and less easily analyzed, and we have included only two items in the Catalogue.

MYCENAEAN POTTERY WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT CONTEXT 485-504; Pls. 64, 75-76 Here are presented the more important Mycenaean pots and fragments without significant context, namely, those that cannot be associated with any group of tombs or any deposit closed in the Mycenaean Age. We have already included a few miscellaneous finds where it seemed likely that they came from destroyed tombs in the area (410-412, perhaps to be associated with destroyed tombs on the Kolonos Agoraios, and 413-424, pottery almost certainly from destroyed tombs under the Stoa of Attalos). In the present group, however, the fragments are arranged according to period, since their original provenience is more obscure. 485. Lower Part of Three-handled Jar. P1. 64. P 5432.

This was presented as an informal typewritten report with four photo- graphic plates, the pertinent information being recorded on the pottery inventory cards, where this author had access to the findings and made use of the conclusions, particularly important for the Neolithic period. (Our references in the Catalogue are to this unpublished Botanical Report.) However, it has belatedly seemed appropriate to include a revised version of this report as an appendix to Athenian Agora, XIII, although the last six entries dealing with actual seed and plant material fall outside the chronological limits of this volume. Unfortunately, it is not possible at this late date to include the photographic plates. Dr. Hopf has translated her original report and brought it up to date to make reference to her more recent studies of plant material from Lerna and Thessaly. The material is arranged chronologically in two series: A) inclusions in pottery and B) charred seeds and fruits. Numbers in parentheses refer to our Catalogue Numbers. Athens, October 7, 1970 S.A.I. A. INCLUSIONS IN POTTERY 1. P 14563. Neolithic Red Burnished Jar (6). A naked barley grain, measuring 5.8 x 3.3 x 2.8 mm.; the ventral side is incomplete at the right lower end, and at the base, whereas the whole back is preserved; it seems to be symmetrically built, but as there is neither glume nor rachilla, it cannot be decided whether the grain came from a two- or many-rowed ear. Hordeum vulgare L. var. nudum-naked barley. 2. P 10851. Neolithic Red Burnished Jar (3). A flat triangular, somewhat wrinkled pulse seed, 5.0 x 4.5 mm.; position and shape of hilum, which would help to identify the seed, is not to be seen; judging from its size and shape, it may belong to Vicia ervilia (L.) Willd. (Bitter Vetch) or a species of the genus Lathyrus. 3. P 13879 a. Base of Neolithic Red Burnished Jar (8). A round leguminous seed with slightly flattened sides, ca. 5.8 mm. in diameter, with no criteria for a more precise identification, probably a pea, cf. Pisum. 4. P 13964. Middle Helladic Pithos Fragment (366). The ventral side of a big barley corn, its left lower part is missing, the furrow is very narrow in its lower half; in the upper half bits of the vascular string and at the top the fluff of apical hair are preserved; the total length (with hair) is 8.0 mm., the width 3.5 mm. Hordeum vulgare L. var. nudum-naked barley. 5. P 9744. Middle Helladic Coarse Bowl (342). The ventral side of a flat, slender grain, the base is incomplete, the furrow widens in the middle of the grain. (6.0)x 2.7 mm.' Hordeum vulgare L. cf. nudum-barley, perhaps naked. 6. P 9744. Same vessel as above. A big grape pip, without stalklet, measuring (6.0) X 5.0 mm. Vitis vinifera L.-vine. 7. P 10534. Stem of Gray Minyan Goblet (282). Grape pip as above, but left side is incomplete, and the stalklet is preserved; 6.7 X (4.8) mm. Vitis vinifera L.-vine. 8. P 9502. Middle Helladic Jug (353). A flat round shell of a snail, most probably a sea- snail. The slightly ribbed shell measures 3.0 mm. in diameter. 1 Measurements in parentheses are taken from incomplete seeds.</page><page sequence="285">APPENDIX 9. P 21245. Mycenaean Jug (VII-20). Back of a barley corn, the longitudinal nerves of which show; the awn is broken off. (8.0) x 4.0 mm. Hordeum vulgare L.-hulled barley. 10. P 21276 b. Mycenaean Alabastron Fragment (VII-26). The ventral side of a barley corn, the lower part covered by the interior glume. (6.0) x 2.7 mm. Hordeum vulgare L. var. nudum-barley (naked ?). 11. P 21247. Mycenaean Jug (VII-18). The reverse of a small oblong leaf with curled rim. 5.0 x 2.3 mm. 12. P 23567. Mycenaean Coarse Amphora (XXIV-18). Reverse sides of two small leaves, as above, measuring 5.6x 2.8 mm. and 4.5x 2.7 mm. B. CHARRED SEEDS AND FRUITS 1. Early Geometric Grave, D 16:4. Carbonized grapes, more or less damaged or broken, some of them showing 1 or 2 pips in the interior, from which it can be concluded that there must have been 3 or 4, as is common with wild and not highly cultivated species. The measurements are (8.0-15.0) 10.65X (6.5-15.0) 9.95 mm. Vitis vinifera L.-vine. 2. Early Geometric Grave, D 16:2. Carbonized figs, considerably shrunk, but still showing their original shape and measuring (28.0- 35.0)31.7 x (15.0-20.0)17.3 mm. (see Hesperia, XVIII, 1949, p. 282, pl. 66, 4). 3. Byzantine Granary, Area T-U 22. a). 12 barley grains, some of them twisted as is usual with lateral grains in many-rowed ears. (5.8-7.1) 6.25 X (2.3-3.2) 2.8 mm. Hordeum vulgare L. polystichum-many- rowed, hulled barley. b). 4 grains belonging to a wheat species; but since they differ very much in shape and size and are broken or puffed, it cannot be determined with certainty, although it is likely, that it is bread wheat. Triticum cf. aestivum L.-(bread?) wheat. c). Among the grain there are cotyledons of a leguminous seed, which could not be identified, as the seed shell with the hilum is gone. 4. Byzantine Apotheke or Granary, Area T 22. A larger sample which consists of barley only; the grains are well-preserved and not puffed, showing their original shape. Some are twisted; quite a number of smaller and bigger fragments of glumes, which have fallen off, are also preserved. The average measurements are almost the same as in the above sample, though the range of variation is much wider. (4.0-8.0) 6.23 x (2.1-3.6) 2.94 mm. Hordeum vulgare L. polystichum-many- rowed, hulled barley. The remains of food plants found in the Athenian Agora can be summarized as follows: Neolithic Middle Helladic Mycenaean Early Geometric Byzantine Barley naked hulled Wheat Pulses Vine Fig x x x x x x Up to now very little plant material from Greek sites is known, even from Classical times. Only the mound of Lerna in the Argolid produced a large number of seeds and fruits from Neolithic to Classical strata (M. Hopf, Zilchter, XXXI, 1961, pp. 239ff.; Jahrb. RBm.-Germ. Zentralmus., IX, 1962, pp. 1ff.). In Thessaly plant remains were found on several sites (see Miloj6i6, Boessneck, Hopf, "Die deutschen Ausgrabungen auf der Argissa-Magula," Thessalien, I, 1962, pp. 101ff., and J. Renfrew, Thessalika, , 1966, pp. 21ff.). The Agora plants here described are also represented at one or the other of the above-mentioned places. However, it is quite remarkable that naked barley existed already in Neolithic central Greece, whereas from contemporary northern finds only hulled barley is described. 268</page><page sequence="286">APPENDIX 269 Furthermore it may be of interest that grapes and figs occurred in graves at the same place and period, and apparently were used in the same way during funerals. In Lerna these two fruit species superseded each other; up to E.H. II quite a lot of charred figs, and only figs, were found; beginning with E.H. III there were grape pips and berries, but no more figs. Only in E.H. II pottery, perhaps belonging to and coming with in- vaders, some impressions of grape pips could be identified. According to B. Logothetis ('H 'EAtlIts rij 'AlTrraXou Kal T'S 'AiirrEXoupyicas ElS T' 'EXXc a ca Kcra T&amp; 'ApXatoXoytKa ECpfrlcrrat rS rTEptoxiis, 'Apoaro-ri- EIov TTlavETrio'riltov GEaacTXoviKnS, 1970), who gives a survey of all prehistoric grapes from Greece, the oldest, i.e. Neolithic, grapes are known from Macedonia (Photoleivous); all the grapes found more southward are younger. And the pips included in the Agora pottery (342 and 282) are not older than Middle Helladic. So, perhaps, the vine came to Greece from the north. Mainz, September 10, 1970.
