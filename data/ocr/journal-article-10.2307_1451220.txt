WHEN we speak of Aquila's knowledge of the Hebrew Grammar and Lexicon, it should be understood that we cannot possibly have in mind a systematic treatise of Hebrew grammar or a Hebrew-Greek lexicon ready-made, but rather that empiric and practical acquaintance with grammatical rules and the meanings of words without which no translator could operate at all. At best it may be said of the period antedating the rise of a scientific study of the Hebrew language in the tenth century that gram- matical reflexion manifested itself then in a rudimentary way. Thus we find empiric observations in the talmudic literature which, however, do not go very far.70 70 On the history of grammar, see Steinthal, Geschichte der Spraclhissen- schiaft bei den Griechen und R6mern mit besonderer Riicksiclt auf die Logik, I, 1895, 25 ff.; v. d.

Sariik have quite primitive ideas concerning the nature of Hebrew roots71 and to what sad consequences of a practical kind these erroneous notions led in Kalir's paitanic productions,72 it were idle to expect any sounder views from Aquila. Just because Aquila is given to etymologizing,73 the foregone conclusion that he will have exposed himself to the pitfalls of a primitive root theory is verified all too well. The following examples, which are by no means ex- haustive, may serve as an illustration: DuD is combined with )D, 3 Kings 21. 27 where t = KEKAyLE'MO '; '_ is con- fused with 'tn Deut. 26. 17 where 'tMsM is rendered avrr7XXAdo, a word used by a' for 'ln Ps. 45 (46). 3; inT with bw Ps. 90 (9 1). 1 where ETaXijoiera?Ta =n comp. rETaY6e = 1 ?; 32 (33). io; ei with rt Ps. 68 (69). 2I where Ka daE7yvPjo-8v renders n7M2N, but anoywlv(TKelv otherwise renders e_i)i, comp. i Kings 27.

Conscious of the various functions belonging to the various conjugations in Hebrew, Aquila endeavoured to differentiate as much as possible between them by using certain types of Greek verbs for certain types of Hebrew verbs. Thus, the pi'el and hiph'il are expressed to a large degree by verbs ending in -oiv and -diw, -iCew: 't,in = Kara3tlt,dlew, )j? and ti'?!P = ayd1elzt, ( l. = a0wovv, ns,.n = PvvaiovOv, nl = et-roov^, nv and ,n,n = Cooviv, 1i? and Koyon o = K-oAo3ov, nn = TorirT tEn arKovTiCtw, nan- = ayvorflaTelv,C' 5P'1 = ?rKav&amp;aXo?u, n or mi = cfTori(tv, 'n1 and '.n = 'oppigew, T3 and rp.; = *tKoPir(CEw, V., .li^n and n&amp;,n = yvzpi(Clw, &amp;c. Verbs with -oov and -(CELv are less frequently used for the kal, e.g. tn? = BoKtdaev) t, ':? = KVKAOVU, .:._ = MKrV?ovV; while the pi'el and hiph'il are sometimes rendered also by ordinary verbs, e.g. n.ni and nlntI~ = tlaA0Oeipel, :t'0J = e7r&amp;rtrpecEl, nIt = Evf)paivewv, K?:n = KJlaTTUrev. The hiph'il is sometimes rendered also by a combination with TOltev, as e.g. P.^n- = trXVpO7roLe?v, P?.'N = alvowoteli, n' il yTorv ro&amp;ev nYn.,. = l~cwvov 7Trotey. Moreover, verbs with -^vetv are sometimes employed to render the hiph. and more rarely the pi. as, for instance, t. and 5y:n, = treyaXkvewt , :?n = ayaOvvetv and /3eXrvve&amp;V, P'n'l = iaKpvveIv. 7* As to the confusion of roots in the Septuagint comp. Frankel, Vorstudien, p. 200. 58o</page><page sequence="5">PROLEGOMENA TO AN INDEX TO AQUILA-REIDER 58I 20. Where a Hebrew intransitive verb = a Greek passive verb, the pi'el and hiphlil of the intrans. are rendered by the active of the Greek verb. Thus xi? = KoXofo,ovrOa, n.i? and '1.1-. = KoXo/3ov ; n= ,.iELmrX&amp;o-r0a, .V' and YI?r'n /c1Lnr&amp;X; ' 1a . = gvvalovooat, '1?1. 1= wvva,yov ; | =' V i,erWopi- CecrOat, 1:3n = plereTOpilEv ; w = rlT(Eoat, 'nI = oTrilv ; 3 = fKavoaXrov'Yat,, 5'1? = -Kav8aXo v; '3 = f3ap6vcoOat, 'TShn = /tapvetv ; p = GbacrKop7rcreo'Oa, 1n. = bltacKOpT'LtEv ; Q^- = Vf1ooat, tl -1; =4 ooiv; Mnj wrXavar-Oal, MnY; = 7rXavaiv ; b_n = reAelovcrOat, bn0 = reAetor; = A--laivEcra&amp;, =t3 = lativev; 'l i = kitFovor-Oat, ^rI = 6to-oI ; nn' = E?fpa(vEeo-al, n* = ev4paivEtv. 2I. The passive conjugations are invariably rendered by the Greek passive, the stem remaining the same as in the active, if the active exists. Thus 3Y1 = yIyvoSo-KEtV, 3li = ytyv(oTKEOeOa ; lr 3 = ypACePtv, 3n1: = yp6decrOat; in? = olio- BoIe[Lv, n323 = oLKoo/boleLOa&amp;; pto = /oXvr^ev, 3 = OhVwxe-Oa ; nTan = TTrXTOE1rL, nnl = 7TArTceorOat. Where the pass. is found translated by the active it is mostly due to a different vocalization on the part of our translator, as, for instance, Job 28. 15 t- = bwa-et presupposes the pointing Vi1 (sbj. .n', so also 0'). On the other hand, there are a few passives construed as actives, but in these instances the whole rendering is paraphrastic. Thus Gen. 30. 8 }m3. 'TIT -,5q = avvavrE'cTpe e 6 Oe 0eS avvavacrrpornv; Isa. 26. 3 _t 3 " S = orTt ar' avrw reroi0acrt, unless a' read In:ot; Jer.

There are likewise some actives rendered passively, thus Lev. 15. 3 1m.nn ('inwardly transitive', GK., ? 53d-g) = ierfpaytir0rl; Job 5. 5 alni. = ap0?rorat; Ps. 92 (93). 3 . = rnpOrln; Jer.

Aquila's knowledge of Hebrew syntax could only be gauged fully if we had more continuous texts of his version than we possess now. But even with the limited means at our disposal, considering even the fact that in the fragments preserved, outside the large recently discovered remains, complete sentences and phrases are rather scarce, it is easy to see at a glance that his knowledge of the rules governing the construction of the Hebrew sentence was sound. Of course, we must bear in mind the fact that in individual cases Aquila's exegesis may be at variance with our own, This is proved by the following illustrations: (a) The Hebrew perfect is largely rendered by the Greek aorist, as, e.g. Me'= - KdOLOTEV, I11, = ?'/YY&amp;oV, I 3 rapiiA0ov, 4-1 = bteT)pqoa. In a few characteristic passages the Greek perfect takes the place of the aorist: Gen. i. 29; Ezek. 3. 9 - =AoKa; Exod. 7. I -bE6 0-c; I Kings 9. 24 = K1,KX?1Ka; Ps. 30 (3I). 23 '~- - aE'eeppLtjaL ; Jer. i 8. i 2 al = d4rr mto-raL. Sometimes the pluperfect is found, as, for instance, Ps. 24 (25). 2 and 30 (31). 15 where 111-M: = TEh7rotOEtv. Or the imperfect is used, as Deut. 32. 17 7 C'r = &amp;PLXLO)V CtvaOZ 7 7; Ps. II 8 (119). 174 ~11211 = '6rEdXO5Mv Jer. 2. 24 flK v = E cXKVEv; Ezek. 22. 29 UiM = ,I3L'8aovro.

(Tnli) = cEXA(ETraL; Ps. 76 (77). IO n_n = ,zU71 7ril7reTal. Similarly the future is used to indicate an action the accomplishment of which lies in the future: Job i8. 20 a: = a'qrovrj'oovcv ; 4I. t?3 = btlaEvaEraL; Prov. 8. 35 xt~ = Evpr?e)t. Abnormal is eio-- KOVO(OVU ov for .?n.% Ps. 21 (22). 22 for which there is a variant elfrjKovo-aa based on the Syrohex.76 In a con- ditional clause the pf. is aptly translated by the aor. subj.: Ezek. 3. 18 inn,!n = &amp;ao-reXj (supply IKa' 7i, in dependence on : cum infin.). Examples of the present: Job 24. 5 x"Y = &amp;spXovZTa; 36. 30 tnB = KTrerdTa; Prov. 6. 8 mN = ao-VTpEq)E (gnomic tense); and with reference to God Jer. Io. 7 n' = 7rpeT,ce (or r7rxp7re,). The pf. with w prefixed is rendered by article cum pt., comp. Eccles. 2. 17 where n't- = TO IroLoV1e'vOV. Similarly, the pf. with .'T pre- ceding: Jer. 7. I n -? o' = 6 yevodvos; o1. 25 JW't!_' 'tnW = ... yLvo-crKovTa ...; 34 (4I). 5 '. = TOv yEvopvwv ; 52. 15 i - 'IW = Trovg tLArETTrrKOTag. The pf. with bs preceding is translated by the aor. subj. preceded by Edv, as, e.g. Ps. 40 (4I). 7 -'t. = (Kal) ayv \0,r; with '. 5 preceding Ps. 18 (9I). 4 TyV. 5 - ov ,U71 aKtov ol. Two asyndetic perfects are brought into subordination: pt. aor. cum pf. aor., as Ps. 9. 24 (lo. 3) Y: '1n. = EAoy7roraY bGavpe; a similar treatment is given a pf. followed by an impf., comp.

AQUILA'S translation, while eulogized by the Fathers of the Synagogue on account of its adherence to Jewish tradition,77 was condemned, and severely criticized by the Church Fathers for its tendency to obviate christological interpretations of certain passages through a literal and oftentimes etymologizing rendering.

That the popularity of a' among the Jews was still in the ascendant in the fourth and fifth centuries is attested by Jerome on Ezek. 3.5, and Augustine, de civit.

I4 by veavt&amp; as against 7rapObvos of the Septuagint.8 25. The fact is, however, that when we deal with such a literal translator as Aquila it is quite difficult to arrive at a definite conclusion concerning his exegesis. Any criterion might fail in view of his etymologizing process which leaves us in doubt whether, in deviating in a certain point from the generally accepted meaning, he intended to voice his own views or those of the Synagogue to which he belonged, or else he simply adhered to the letter for its own sake. It is this circumstance no doubt that accounts for the rather mild verdicts of Origen (ov Ketra&amp; 7rapa roLs 'E,pa(ots, 8todep ovte rap' rTO 'AKAha),85 and Jerome (iamduduum cum volumi- nibus Hebraeorum editionem Aquilae confero, ne quidforsitan propter odium Christi synagoga mutaverit, et, ut amicae mentifatear, quae ad nostranmfidem pertineant roborandam plura reperio).8 Nevertheless, just because it is more or less free from subjectivity, Aquila's version 'certainly marks the beginning of thorough exegesis of the Old Testament' 87 if by exegesis we really mean an attempt to get at the true meaning of the Hebrew Scriptures. We must not overlook the conditions that brought forth Aquila's 88 Comp. Schiirer, Geschichte des jiidische Volkes im ZeitalterJesu Christi, IIP, 613, n. 12.

Aquila stemmed the tide of philosophical exposition through his method of translating verbatim, with absolute adherence to the original text, thus paving the way for the modern historical and philological methods of interpretation. It is in this sense therefore that Aquila becomes important in the history of Biblical exegesis. 26. In the following pages an attempt is made to record all the important phases of Aquila's interpretation as exemplified in the extant fragments of his version. 27. In the first place mention must be made of differences arising out of the reading of i (or o) for e and vice versa.

In the preceding I have tried to illustrate Aquila's departure from the accepted vocalization, punctuation, and interpretation of single words of the masoretic text. In the following I intend to discuss his method of exegesis as exemplified in phrases and sentences which sometimes receive a singular treatment and yield a sense different than that transmitted to us by tradition. Gen. 3. i6 :n.l.n. = rvvdqeta (Jer. societas) is a free rendering and is probably due to some midrashic interpre- tation with reference to conjugal union and marital relation. A midrashic meaning perhaps underlies likewise ('s a7ro- orpoqri, comp. Ber. r. ad loc., ed. Theodor, p. 191 (s:-n7 'l' npwn5 miwn Inpvni), and also Midrash Lekah Tob, ed.
