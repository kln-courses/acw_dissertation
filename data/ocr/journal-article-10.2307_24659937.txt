Introduction In his monumental commentary on the Song of Songs which appeared in the Anchor Bible in 19771), Professor Marvin Pope rightfully devoted much attention to the allegorical interpretation of this Book of the Bible. Biblical scholars generally tend to confine themselves to a type of exegesis geared solely to the elucidation of the text in its original historical setting. It is the burden of the era of historism we are all carrying that makes us reluctant to take the history of interpretation into serious consideration. And to be honest, it requires a man of Professor Pope's vast learning to survey the exegetical process from the very origin of a biblical text to our present-day times. Few people possess the philological train ing to embark upon such a demanding enterprise. Of course nowadays people are raving about the exquisite quality of the secular poetry contained in this collection of love songs. Yet it is not the literal sense of the Song of Songs that has had the most profound impact on the history of theological reflection. In the Mishnah the rabbis are still debating whether or not the Song should be regarded as a canonical book to be regarded as holy2). It was only accepted as part of the Jewish canon on the condition that it was not taken literally, but allegorically3).

DE MOOR of interpretation the groom in the Song usually represents God, whereas the bride is the Congregation of Israel. All other elements in the text are interpreted on the basis of this supposition. The allegorical interpretation of the Song probably originated in pre-christian times, although it is difficult to prove this with absolute certainty4). In any case it would seem that the author of the pseudepigraphical 4th Book of Ezra who lived towards the end of the first century5) knew the allegorical exegesis of Song of Songs 2:1 f15). One of the best examples of Jewish allegorical exegesis of the Song is found in the targum which offers a wordy paraphrasis of the biblical text connecting it with the history of salvation, especially the Exodus and the journey through the desert. Pope has included an English translation of the targum in his commentary on every verse of the Song. Dutch readers have convenient access to the targum through Professor Martin Mulder's translation7). The quality of the targum's allegorical exegesis is aptly characterized by Philip Alexander, "At first sight the targum appears untrammelled. Closer analysis suggests that behind it lies a disciplined and exact exegesis of the biblical text. Each element in the original is taken as a symbol or cypher to be decoded and arranged in a coherent story, within the broad hermeneutical perspective that the text is an allegorical state ment about God's relationship to Israel through Tora. [...] The ingenuity and learning of the metrugeman in Targum Canticles should not be underestimated. To sustain this sort of paraphrase over the whole book is a tour de force. Targum Canticles is not 'folk' literature: it is a highly learned book, displaying a degree of coherence which suggests that the basic scheme must have been worked out by a single author. Who he was, or where and when he lived it is impossible to say"8). 4) Pope, Song, 90-91. 5) L. Rost, Einleitung in die alttestamentlicher.

Perhaps it is true that one scholar wrote the first version of the targum, but it would seem likely that, as in so many other cases, the final product was the result of many centuries of intensive editing, a process that was concluded only in the 7th century9). It is generally recognized that the allegorical interpretation of the Song of Songs was inspired by a number of passages in the pro phetic books, notably Hosea 1-3, Ezekiel 16 and 23. In view of this circumstance it would seem worthwhile to investigate how the con cept of the love of God is dealt with in the targum to the Prophets. 2. Literal Translations To speak about the love of God is a human, anthropomorphic way of description. Now it is often stated that the targums studiously avoid anthropomorphic descriptions of God. Actually this is only partly true. The targums deal inconsistently with anthropomorphisms in the Hebrew text10). This is also the case with regard to the love of God. Very often the Hebrew verb ■'hb and the noun 3hbh, when applied to God, are rendered literally by the Aramaic rhm and the noun rhmP in the targum to the Prophets11). Since the same Aramaic words are used in the targum to describe carnal love12), this surely is remarkable. 3. Non-literal Translations In other cases, however, the targumists were not satisfied with such a literal interpretation. In one case a second, explanatory 9) R.

") E.g. 2 Sam. 13:1,15; 1 Kings 11:1.</page><page sequence="4">260 JOHANNES C. DE MOOR rendering was added to the first, literal translation. In Hosea 11:1 the words "When Israel was a lad, I loved him" are translated "When Israel was a lad, I loved him (rhymtyh) and I brought him to the worship of me (wqrybtyh Iplhny).'' The phrase mh lydydy bbyty "What about my beloved in my house?" in Jeremiah 11:15 clearly refers to Israel. The targum makes this explicit and at the same time circumvents the anthropomorphism, "What about the people that was beloved before me (hbyb qdmy)?" A similar case is Jeremiah 12:7, where Israel is called "the beloved of my soul" (yddwt npsy) in the Hebrew text. The targum renders "beloved before me (hbyb qdmy)." It is interesting to observe that this translation appears to have been known to the translators of Isa. 43:4 where the Hebrewyqrt bcyny "you are precious in my eyes" corresponds to hbyb qdmy "you are beloved before me." All this is in accordance with standard procedures in the targumim and does not deviate much from the original. However, sometimes more drastic measures were deemed necessary. Accord ing to the Masoretic text of Malachi 2:11 Judah has profaned the Lord's sanctuary in Jerusalem which He loves (3hb). This was a bit too much for the targumists and they translated "because some of the house of Judah profaned their soul which was holy (qdyp) before the Lord." 4. Allegorical Interpretations 4.1 Isaiah 5:1 As is well-known, the first verse of the Song of the Vineyard, Isaiah 5:1, compares God to a beloved friend (ydydy | | dwdy). The targum in its present form seeks to avoid this metaphor. '' The prophet said: I want to praise now Israel which resembles a vineyard, the seed of Abraham my loving friend (rhmy), (with) the praise of my loving friend {rhmy) about his vineyard. My people, my beloved friend (hbyby), Israel—I have given them an inheritance on a lofty mountain in a fertile land.'' Possibly the introduction of the direct oration was added later on in an attempt to mitigate the anthropomorphic nature of the passage which even this allegorical interpretation did not eliminate completely. However, because nobody but God can have been the</page><page sequence="5">THE LOVE OF GOD IN THE TARGUM TO THE PROPHETS 261 giver of the inheritance, the original targumists must have assumed that it was He who is speaking here. ~2&gt;othydyd and dwd are interpreted as designations not of God, but of Israel. Apparently the targumists derived this exegesis from Isaiah 41:8 and 2 Chronicles 20:7 where Abraham is called a "lov ing friend" (3hb) of God. But not only Abraham, also Israel is called a rhmy. In addition to that, Israel is called hbyby, even though the Hebrew text has the same word ydydy. This is so unlike the usual translation techniques of the targumists that it may point to a com posite text which was the result of later editing. 4.2 Hosea 1-3 The allegorical meaning of the first three chapters of the Book of Hosea did not escape the targumists. Not even the wife of Hosea is taken literally, because to take an adulterous woman would be a violation of the Law13). The "wife of harlotry (Jst znwnym)'' in 1:2 becomes "the inhabitants of the idolatrous city (ytby qrP fyt7)Her pregnancy and childbirth are paraphrased as doing evil deeds (1:3, 6,8). In 2:4,7 "your mother" is interpreted as "the congregation of Israel (knysP dysr^l) and her harlotry as idolatry in its cities. The Israelites were led astray by false prophets (2:7). The "lovers (m^hby)" of 2:7 become the nations who loved Israel (cmmy5 r/imy)1*). The correct identification of Israel's harlotry with idolatry necessitated a fairly literal translation of 2:9. ^ysy hr^swn "my former husband" is rendered rbwny qdm?h "my former Lord," apparently a designation of God. In the targum of 2:15 it is said explicitly that the woman "resembles a wife who has left her husband (b^lh) and adorned herself with her rings and with her ankle-clasps and went astray after her lovers—so the congregation of Israel loved (rhymt) to serve the idols and left the service of me." Nevertheless her husband, God, does not divorce her, as is apparent from the rendering of Hosea 2:4. The Masoretic text has 13) Smolar-Aberbach, Studies, 43 f.; Levine, The Aramaic Version, 150. 14) See also 2:9,12,14,15, and for other examples Smolar-Aberbach, Studies, 198. Furthermore Ezek. 23:5,7.</page><page sequence="6">262 JOHANNES C. DE MOOR "I am not her husband" here. The targumists found the idea that God would ever reject his people totally unacceptable and therefore they render "My Memra does not accept her prayer"15). This also appears from their treatment of Hosea 3:1. The congregation of Israel16) resembled "a wife who is the beloved of her husband drhym? Η bHh), but who fornicated against him (wmzny3 Hwhy). But nevertheless he con tinued to love her (rhym Ih) and did not want to divorce her. So (strong) was the Lord's love (rhmt) for the Israelites." Interestingly enough this interpretation of Hosea 3:1 was known to the targumists responsible for Isaiah 57:8 where the adulterous woman is described as follows, "You resembled a wife who was the beloved of her husband {^tP drhymO Η bclh)." In view of the frequent references to the Exodus in the targum to the Song of Songs, it is noteworthy that the targum to Hosea 2:5,16,17 too makes the references to the Exodus and the journey in the desert explicit. 4.3 Ezekiel 16 Most interesting is the allegorical interpretation of Ezekiel 16. Patterned after the parable of Hosea's marriage, this chapter too was intended as a parable about God's love for the unfaithful maiden Jerusalem. The targumists obviously recognized the allegorical nature of the chapter, but because they wanted to eliminate much of its realistic imagery which was much too daring to their taste, they had to add a lot of explanation. With amazing skill they succeeded in weaving these explanations of individual metaphors into a more or less coherent whole. The verses 5-14 which describe how God found the maiden Jerusalem and lovingly tended to her are interpreted as the Exodus from Egypt and the subsequent journey through the desert. As in Hosea, the unfaithfulness of the verses 15-58 is consistently inter 15) Cf. Levine, The Aramaic Version, 102,132. The betrothal of 2:19 is inter preted as the renewal of the covenant with the Israelites. 16) byt ysPl is nothing but a variant of knysP dysPl which is used in 3:3.</page><page sequence="7">THE LOVE OF GOD IN THE TARGUM TO THE PROPHETS 263 preted as idolatry. The Hebrew text of 16:32 may be rendered "You adulterous wife who takes on strangers instead of her hus band Cysh)." The targum translates, '' The congregation of Israel resembles a wife who is the beloved of her hus band (ftp drhym? Η bclh) but who fornicates against him (wmzny3 Hwhy). She leaves her husband (bclh) and goes after strangers." It is clear that this interpretation cannot be separated from the iden tical renderings we found for Hosea 3:1 and Isaiah 57:8. All sexual expressions in the original text are purged by the targumists17). Thus, when 16:7 states "your breasts became firm and your hair grew, but you were still quite naked and exposed," the targum renders, "And through the good deeds of your fathers the time of the deliverance of your congregations has come because you were enslaved and humbled." The breasts of the maiden were also a source of boundless imagina tion to the Targumists of the Song18). But this particular interpreta tion is definitely related to that of Targum Song of Songs 7:9 "Because of their good deeds I will deliver the people, the house of Israel." As usual, it is difficult to assign priority. The insatiable lust of the maiden Jerusalem in Ezek. 16 is inter preted as failure to study the Torah19). 4.4 Ezekiel 23 In Ezekiel 23 the harlotry of Oholah and Oholibah is again explained as the worship of idols20) or friendship with the Assyrians21). Whereas the Hebrew text declares unabashedly "They became mine (wthyynh ly)" (23:4), the targum circumvents such imagery in rendering "they were serving before me (whw^h msmsn qdmy)." To the targumists it was also unthinkable to depict God as a jealous husband and therefore they render Ezekiel 23:25 17) Cf. Smolar-Aberbach, Studies, 52-54. 1S) Targum Song of Songs 1:13; 4:5; 7:4,8 f. 19) Ezek. 16:28 f., cf. Smolar-Aberbach, Studies, 197, n. 440. 20) So 23:3, 8, 11, 14, 17, 19, 27, 29, 35, 37, 43. 21) So 23:5,7.</page><page sequence="8">264 johannes C. DE MOOR "And I will put my punishment on you" instead of "And I will put my jealousy on you"22). Of course it would be blasphemy to state that Oholibah Jerusalem would have forgotten God and would have cast Him behind her back (23:35). So the targumists offer this solution, "Because you have abandoned my worship and have removed the reverence for me from between your eyes..." Again we observe that true love of human beings for God is expressed in terms of proper worship and obedience to the Law. 5. A Messianic Lover One further text demands our attention. It is Zephaniah 3:17 where the difficult Hebrew yhrys Phbtw, whatever its exact mean ing, is definitely related to God. The targum has a most interesting rendering here, "A saviour-hero (gbyr pryq) will rejoice over you with joy, he will tread on your sins in his love (brhmtyh), he will exult over you with exultation." It is certain that pryq "saviour, deliver" was a messianic epithet which was sometimes used to avoid the dangerous title "Messiah"23). So the lover is not God here, but a messianic figure. This may be compared with the targum to Song of Songs 1:8 according to which one of the shepherds mentioned in that text is the Messiah who will lead back the congregation of Israel to the Solomonic temple. According to Levey no specific messianic inter pretation should be sought in this passage24). But this conclusion would seem to be premature, because in the targum to Song of Songs 1:17 the king Messiah is the builder of the bride's house which is subsequently identified with the new Solomonic temple that will be built in the messianic future from cedars growing in the garden of Eden. 22) Cf. Smolar-Aberbach, Studies, 147. 23) See the present writer's '"Van wie zegt de profeet dit?': Messiaanse apologetiek in de Targumim," in: De knechtsgestalte van Christus: Studies aangeboden aan prof. dr. H.N. Ridderbos, Kampen: Kok, 1978, 103. 24) S.H. Levey, The Messiah: An Aramaic Interpretation: The Messianic Exegesis of the Targum. Cincinnati: Hebrew Union College, 1974, 125.</page><page sequence="9">THE LOVE OF GOD IN THE TARGUM TO THE PROPHETS 265 Moreover, the identification of the Davidic Messiah with a shepherd is not only known from the New Testament25), but also from targum-texts like Micah 5:1-3, Ezekiel 34:23 and 37:24. With regard to the latter two, Levey suspects a hidden Messianic message26). The Hebrew expression rch 3hd is translated as hd prns "one master" in the targum to these passages. It is likely that this targumic rendering is reflected in Matthew 23:10 "Neither be called masters, for you have one master, the Christ"27). So there is every reason to suppose that both in the targum to Song of Songs 1:8 and in the targum to Song of Songs 1:17 the lover is not God, but the Messiah. The targum of Zephaniah 3:17 now adds a precious third text to this particular exegetical tradition. Of course it is this tradition which also formed the background of the traditions in the New Testament according to which Christ is the groom and the church is his bride28). The targum sees it as the task of the messianic pryq to abolish the sins of Israel. The connec tion between the root prq and sins is found in the Aramaic text of Dan. 4:24 and in the Targum to Ps. 130:8. Also the targum to Lamentations 4:22 sees the deliverance from sins as an event of the messianic era29). Therefore it may be significant that in Revelation 1:5 Christ is called "he who loves us and has set us free from our sins." Here we encounter the same connection between love and the abolishment of sins which we found in the targum to Zephaniah 3:17. ") E.g.
