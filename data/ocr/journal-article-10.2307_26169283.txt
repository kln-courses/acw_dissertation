ABSTRACT The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) have  both developed crash test methodologies to address frontal collisions in which the vehicle's primary front structure is  either partially engaged or not engaged at all. IIHS addresses Small Overlap crashes, cases in which the vehicle's  primary front energy absorbing structure is not engaged, using a rigid static barrier with an overlap of 25% of the vehicle's  width at an impact angle of 0°. The Institute's Moderate Overlap partially engages the vehicle's primary front energy  absorbing structure using a deformable static barrier with 40% overlap at a 0° impact angle. The NHTSA has developed  two research test methods which use a common moving deformable barrier impacting the vehicle with 20% overlap at a  7° impact angle and 35% overlap at a 15° impact angle respectively. In this paper, the authors present a case study in  which an exemplar mid-size sedan was subjected to all four impact conditions. Following the NHTSA research  procedures and IIHS protocols, the anthropomorphic test devices used in this study were THOR-NT (with LX  instrumented lower legs) for the NHTSA research tests, and the Hybrid III AM50 for the IIHS tests. Differences with  regards to resulting vehicle deformation, vehicle kinematics, and occupant kinematics were noted between the IIHS and  NHTSA test methods and are discussed in this paper.

Overall, the  occupant compartment nears the barrier. delta-V in the NHTSA RMDB Small Overlap tests had an  earlier onset as well as a steeper slope than the IIHS Small  Overlap test, except for the first approximately 30 ms of the  event. The more severe crash pulse of the IIHS Small Overlap  test in this first 30 ms can be attributed to the fact that the  barrier is rigid (i.e., stiffer than the NHTSA RMDB) and has 5%  more overlap with the vehicle's front-end structures. However,  with increasing time, the crash pulse of the NHTSA RMDB  Small Overlap tests becomes more severe overall. The rigid  barrier in the IIHS Small Overlap test provides a smooth  surface that can allow for the vehicle to deflect laterally away  from the barrier. However, because of the deformable surface  of the NHTSA RMDB, as well as the impact angle in this test  configuration, there is less lateral translation of the vehicle  relative to the loading surface. The difference in crash pulse severity with increasing time is  evident in the longitudinal acceleration of the vehicles (shown  in Figure 8(a)), which shows larger spikes in acceleration in the  NHTSA RMDB Small Overlap tests except within the first 30  Figure 5.

This is shown in  Figure 8(b); the acceleration vs. displacement trend between  the IIHS Small Overlap and NHTSA RMDB Small Overlap test  modes is similar to that of the Moderate Overlap and Offset  Oblique as described previously. Aside from the more severe crash pulse in the NHTSA RMDB  tests, the increased deformation seen in the NHTSA RMDB  test modes could also be attributed to the increased interaction  between the vehicle and the RMDB as compared to that which  occurs in the IIHS test modes.

Figures 9 and 10 show the overhead views of the vehicles at  the time of initial contact and at 100 ms after initial contact. In  the IIHS Moderate Overlap test (Figure 9), the vehicle bottoms- out on the barrier around 100 ms, at which point it begins to  move rearward and laterally to the right, away from the barrier.  However, in the NHTSA RMDB Offset Oblique tests, the barrier  continues loading the vehicle and becomes coupled with it,  driving it rearward while the rear end of the barrier begins to  rotate about the vehicle/barrier interface; separation between  the vehicle and barrier does not occur until well after 250 ms. A similar difference was noted between the IIHS Small Overlap  test and NHTSA RMDB Small Overlap tests. In the IIHS Small  Overlap test (Figure 10), the vehicle travels forward until the  front door hinge pillar (lower A-pillar) reaches the barrier at  approximately 100 ms, and which point the vehicle pushes off  the barrier and moves laterally to the right, away from the  barrier. Conversely, the vehicle/barrier interaction in the  NHTSA RMDB Small Overlap is similar to that of the RMDB  Offset Oblique test, with the barrier and vehicle coupling  together while the rear end of the barrier begins to rotate, and  separation of the vehicle and barrier does not occur until after Figure 10.

In the IIHS Small Overlap, however, the  lateral velocity continues increasing until the base of the  vehicle's A-pillar reaches the barrier (at approximately 100 ms),  at which point the vehicle ‘bounces’ off the fixed rigid barrier  and interaction between the vehicle and barrier ceases. It is  during this later phase (through to the end of the crash event)  when the vehicle experiences more lateral movement than in  the NHTSA RMDB Small Overlap test. Figure 11.

The differences in occupant kinematics observed between the  NHTSA RMDB and IIHS test modes are thought to be  attributed to two factors. One factor is the difference in ATDs  used in the tests. As mentioned, THOR was seated in the  driver position in the NHTSA RMDB tests, while Hybrid III was  used in the IIHS tests. THOR is considered to have improved  biofidelity over Hybrid III [17]; this has previously been shown  in frontal sled tests comparing the dynamic responses of  THOR, Hybrid III and post-mortem human surrogates [18].  Differences in the construction of the spine and neck between  THOR and Hybrid III could contribute to different occupant  kinematics when subjected to similar crash events. One key  difference between the ATDs is the greater compliance of the  lumbar spine in THOR (as compared to a relatively stiff lumbar  spine of Hybrid III), which would allow for more movement of  Figure 16.

In the NHTSA RMDB tests conducted in this study, a Hybrid III  was positioned in the front passenger seat.
