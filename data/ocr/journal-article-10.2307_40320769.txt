<plain_text><page sequence="1">John Dewey: Rethinking Our Time Raymond D. Boisvert Albany: State University of New York Press, 1997 xii + 189 pp. The author's prior book, a very Aristotelian look at Dewey's Metaphysics (1988), starts from criticism of the idea of freedom as autonomy. That theme persists, along with an Aristotelian flavoring in the present account of Dewey. "Autonomy as a model of freedom," Boisvert says, "leads in practice to sepa- ration from others, not toward democratic community" (p. 64). While it is true that emphasis on autonomy may put community under strain, we must ask if this is not sometimes needed to ensure its democratic character. Boisvert's new volume "seeks to play a special role" in the current revival of Dewey and American philosophy. He says in the Introduction, "I would de- scribe the text as a 'primer'," and "its aim is to serve as a brief and generally accessible introduction to Dewey's philosophy" (p. 4). The text is "expository rather than critical," though it is not lacking for critical suggestions; and the topics were selected as "central to an inclusive overview" of Dewey's positions (p. 4). Boisvert's Introduction puts his book in the immediate context of the eclipse and revival of classical American philosophy, one of its most well argued and appealing elements. A chief question is how the autonomy of the pragma- tist tradition can be served lacking emphasis on its independence. Boisvert attempts a "sympathetic" interpretation of Dewey but basically</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 410 accepts critical perspectives from Reinhold Niebuhr, Ernest Gellner, and John Patrick Diggins (cf. p. 168 n4.). There are appreciative quotations from Hei- degger, casting doubt on visual metaphors in philosophy, but no mention of Habermas (a friend of a Kant-derived conception of autonomy). Related points put the present work in some tension with other recent efforts such as James Campbell's Understanding John Dewey (1995) and Larry Hickman's John Dewey's Pragmatic Technology (1990). The contrasts in the account of Dewey and early Niebuhr are especially interesting. The post- WWII era was a period of "recolonization," according to Bois- vert, and "the classical American philosophers were quickly marginalized as universities sought to embrace the latest European ideas" (p. 3). "Positivism and existentialism were imported from the continent, and language analysis from the British Isles," and "the academics who embraced" the imports "too often took on the role of imperialists seeking a thorough recolonization of the American territory" (p. 3). The situation changed, with the availability of Dewey's writings in the 37 volumes of Jo Ann Boydston's edition, the founding of the Society for the Ad- vancement of American Philosophy (1973), and Richard Rorty's work in draw- ing attention to Dewey. The revival of interest in Dewey is not to be doubted, and the book rightly distances these efforts from the postmodernist "herme- neutics of suspicion," in favor of the "hermeneutics of recovery" (p. 157), of the pragmatist tradition. Central questions posed concern the degree to which current American conditions are a continuation of those which eclipsed Dewey and classical American philosophy, Rorty's writings and the influence of early Niebuhr and existentialism included. If we were "recolonized," this was not by invasions of foreign intellectual "imperialists." To follow out Boisvert's anal- ogy, should we not take a look at our domestic intellectual 'neo-colonialists," those who benefitted by uncritical facilitation of imports? Beyond the Introduction, there are eight numbered chapters, a listing of chief events in Dewey's life, an Appendix on "Dewey in Cyberspace," three photographs of Dewey, a bibliography, notes, and an index. A natural progres- sion in the topics of the numbered chapters starts from "The Life World" and the primacy of interaction in Chapter 1, through "Thinking," and inquiry in Chapter 2, "Democracy," in Chapter 3, "The Public" and its problems in Chapter 4, "Education," in Chapter 5, "Making" and art, in Chapter 6, and "Devotion," concerning Dewey's philosophy of religion, in Chapter 7. Chapter 8, in conclusion, discusses Dewey's contemporary relevancy, and it is the philo- sophical key to Boisvert's reading and perspective. Here we find summary mention of "the weaknesses in Dewey's philoso- phy," based on his critics: "he is too dependent on science, too optimistic, too anthropocentric," and in addition "the 'personal' dimension" as in existentialist writers, "is lacking from his thought" (p. 160). In spite of this, Boisvert at- tempts "to highlight those Deweyan plant stocks that can continue to be help-</page><page sequence="3">411 Book Reviews fill in the hybridization necessary for our own time" (p. 161). Generally, the emphasis is on Deweyan primary or immediate experience, and the Logic and methodological works are deemphasized. Dewey "specifically rejected the atti- tude that epistemological concerns are the main issues dealt with by philo- sophers" (p. 161). Bothersome, for Boisvert no doubt, is that Dewey says that "logic" and inquiry "are autonomous" (LW12, p. 28). We are not to import questionable or problematic conclusions from an imagined outside. Moreover, Dewey's "theory of inquiry" is his replacement for traditional epistemology. Boisvert makes use of Dewey, selectively in "rethinking our time," and does so in a "polytemporal" way, employing a "filter of organic metaphors" which can also be found in "Aristotle, Leibniz, and Whitehead" (p. 161). The book is generally well written, though we must wonder if Boisvert's particular filters chiefly focus the reader's overall view of Dewey. Boisvert's Dewey, partly to avoid the purported Deweyan "anthropomorphic," is cast in language and assumptions which work in the service of critical perspectives established in their essentials well before the current revival. Thus, in view of Boisvert's con- victions in crafting the book, it may be argued that it cannot easily function to bring the full range of Dewey's writings into an evaluation of the social and intellectual forces responsible for the 50-year eclipse of the pragmatist tradi- tion. In degree, the author risks a continuation of the eclipse. Often disdaining use of Dewey's own vocabulary, in view of "futile contro- versies" (p. 11), Boisvert casts Dewey's work in a triad of negations. The Intro- duction portrays Dewey as not captured by the "Plotinian Temptation" of mo- nism, »0* engaged in a scientistic "Galilean Purification" of experience, and not engaged by "The Asomatic Attitude" of disembodied minds and mind-body dualism. But sometimes what is required to get Dewey right is simply to settle some of the old "futile controversies," though the opposition can certainly be stiff. This would require critical attention to Dewe's domestic detractors, and perhaps a less smoothly readable book. Boisvert's concessions to Dewey's crit- ics, on the other hand, make for a compact and smoothly reading volume. Reiterating these negative characterizations through the book, the author avoids many of the controversies of interpretation involved in explaining Dewey's positive doctrines. No doubt we can agree that Dewey rejected any "Plotinian" monism in favor of pluralism, rejected absolute unification in favor of harmonization of values. But harmonization of diversity sometimes requires Deweyan reconstruction, to diminish conflicting commitments grown too broad. Do we not sometimes need a collective bonfire of the vanities? Does Boisvert over-emphasize a plurality of uncritical commitments, in contrast with Dewey's critical role for philosophy? What in particular does it mean, in under- standing Deweyan pluralism, to say that philosophy "needs to embrace its own point of departure" (p. 9). Surprisingly, avoiding the reductionism of a "Galilean Purification" we learn not only that philosophy must begin in médias re$\ but, what seems much</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 412 stronger, that "the here and now is not something to be overcome" (p. 9). To be sure, the Deweyan can agree that philosophy might be "at home in the con- crete, complex, indeed messy, condition of human life" (p. 9), but only if it retains vision and ideals for reconstructive purposes and motivations. Our ideals are part of the "mix." Approaching Boisvert's continuing and important contributions to Dewey scholarship requires exploring what seems a central tension of the volume. First we need to take a look at his account of Dewey on equality, afterward moving back from there to his critical treatment of autonomy. According to Boisvert, Dewey's "interpretation of democratic equality em- phasizes 'individuality'" (p. 65), rejecting a simple "quantitative reading" of equality, and a similar distribution of, say, talent, wealth, or powers among all members of society. Quoting Dewey, Boisvert maintains that we understand moral equality best by linking it to individuality, and not to the notion of a "universal atemporal context of judgment" of others: "Moral equality means incommensurability," hold Boisvert and Dewey (not a bad word, so long as we avoid absolutizing the notion), "the inapplicability of common and quantita- tive standards" (MW13, p. 299; quoted p. 68). This is a way of recognizing the uniqueness of human beings, but beyond that Dewey regards equality "not as a natural possession," but instead as "a fruit of the community when its action is directed by its character as a community" (MW12, p. 330). In consequence Boisvert emphasizes a rejection of individualism, as connected with Locke and the empiricist tradition. There are some kind words for the old New England Puritan monoculture. Democratic equality requires that we "seek out, identify, and appreciate" the unique and distinctive contributions of each person rather than measuring everyone against a single standard, and Boisvert's Deweyan conception of equality involves a plurality of evaluative standards; equality means that "no single end, activity or approach can be judged as superior in a universal way;" equality as an ideal "celebrates plurality and diversity" (p. 70). This focus on individuality and plurality in the account of equality, might be expected to lead up to a treatment of equal rights or equality before the law, but Boisvert draws no connection to human rights or the rule of law. He is chiefly concerned to warn, correctly, against a single, universal standard of evaluation, leading to rigid class divisions. Though the lack of a discussion of Dewey on human rights is to be regretted, and we are left to wonder how problematic conflicts of val- ues might be non-arbitrarily mediated on occasion (cf. Dewey 's Theory of Valuation), still, the idea of equality as incommensurate individuality and value is well worth pursuing. In fact, we might fairly use it in the evaluation of Boisvert's negative view of autonomy. Moral equality as individuality, is essentially a plea for the indi- vidualization of our conception of growth, and insofar as we can plausibly think of individualized growth and development as a Deweyan conception of</page><page sequence="5">413 Book Reviews human freedom, then this invites a critical look at Boisvert on autonomy. Our growth in individuality is fairly viewed as a product of interaction in communi- ties, but the character of communities suited to facilitate growth, as I will ar- gue, requires significant freedom and autonomy within the larger society. It is not that the word "autonomy" plays an especially large role in Dewey's writings. But neither do we find a complete rejection. Dewey and Tufts in the 1908 Ethics contrast "autonomy" with traditional forms of social dependency: Individual initiative and responsibility have steadily increased, and the economic development has undoubtedly strengthened the development of religious, political, and moral freedom. It is the combination of these which gives the person of to-day the worth and dignity belonging to autonomy, self-government, and democracy. (MW5, p. 472) There is room to question Boisvert's rejection of autonomy on grounds of concern for human worth and dignity, though this certainly contrasts with Boisvert on Deweyan equality. "If we were all the antecedently completed selves suggested by Locke, the ideal of freedom as autonomy might be feasible and comprehensive," Boisvert writes (p. 58). He argues that the Lockean con- ception of "completed selves" is a "fable," and "There is no completed self re- quiring only elimination of extraneous conditions to reveal itself (p. 58). But while we can all agree that human beings are in fact, "open ended," shaped and influenced by their cultures, languages, and by their human relations, what is to prevent us from thinking of autonomy in these processes as requiring individu- alized growth and unique contributions based in our "incommensurate" differ- ences? It is not, of course, that particular individuals can be thought of as com- pletely determining all developments in interaction with others, but there is room to doubt that this is a reasonable meaning to attribute to any conception of autonomy. Even Locke can more plausibly be thought of as positing or sug- gesting not "completed selves," but instead a distinctively human potentiality for self-development; not a pre-social or anti-social self, but instead moral con- ditions of human beings in community, taken as appropriately shaping political forms. The distinction between the social and the political is crucial to the Lockean notion of the "state of nature," as it is to the classic republican dis- tinction between "natural" (or moral) rights and "civil rights" arising out of political arrangements. Related discussions are pretty much lacking in Bois- vert's contrast of individualism with individuality. Needed criticism of Locke on natural rights might still see it as a precursor of contemporary positions. None of this is intended to question Dewey on the need to provide posi- tive social conditions of growth, in contrast with the classical liberal idea of merely removing restrictions, in order that human beings should develop and</page><page sequence="6">Book Reviews 414 flourish. The idea is that human rights and the rule of law, political guarantees of minimal autonomy independent of the vagaries of our relations to communi- ties, should count among the needed social conditions of human growth and expression. We rightly emphasize more "positive" elements of freedom where legally guaranteed rights prove insufficient, but this is far from slighting basic human rights when they are genuinely placed in question by oppressive forces in particular political societies. There is a balance to be sought here, and Bois- vert on equality as individuality could help us see more clearly that our concep- tion of human rights is a needed minimal guarantee of autonomy and of op- portunity for growth. No doubt, we sometimes do better to emphasize how freedom and equality are to be achieved through interaction in community, but this cannot plausibly substitute for basic legal guarantees of human rights and equality before the law. Boisvert correctly sees a need for greater contemporary emphasis on the value of community, and this stance is the root of his doubts about autonomy. We will likely sympathize with the idea that nominalistic conceptions of indi- vidual freedom have contributed significantly to the eclipse of the pragmatist tradition and prevalent contemporary loss of intellectual and moral orientation. Yet we must avoid any suggestion of traditional and viciously exclusionary or predatory forms of community - that would be coummunitarianism with a vengeance. Boisvert perhaps best approaches needed points of balance in his discussion of devotion and Dewey on the religious. What Dewey had in mind, retaining the category of the religious, is a devotion to "the sense of connection of man, in the way of both dependence and support, with the enveloping world that the imagination feels is a universe" (LW9, p. 36; Boisvert, p. 141). The refusal to reduce the religious to the moral or aesthetic signifies the crucial role which this sense of connection plays in the conviction that our own acts can and do make a difference. Because of such conviction, we can continue to seek to real- ize ideals out of the actual, even in the face of defeats, and recognizing our own limitations. According to the author's account, Dewey follows Emerson in being "neither an adherent of a religion nor a secularist" (p. 144); and part of the idea is to avoid dogmas of theology while emphasizing that though we start with social practices, "when certain of them are infused with a conviction" and "their meaning is linked to wider natural and social forces," then "we come as close as is possible to what traditional religions had as best about them" (p. 144). We need to avoid exclusive focus on the human world and overly Prome- thean conceptions of humanity, since even humanistic religion, where it ex- cludes our relation and dependence on nature is "pale and thin" (p. 151), threatening to end with worship of the all-too-human, and neglecting the ways in which our real and imaginative, or possible, relations to nature facilitate im- provements to the human world. Dewey's "natural piety," and our dependence</page><page sequence="7">415 Book Reviews and support by forces beyond our control, is central in Boisvert's account of Dewey on the religious, and in consequence resources are provided to resist any egoism, individual or collective, which would aim to destroy what it cannot control. Though the topic of religion, the religious, and secularism will doubt- lessly continue to be hotly debated in contemporary pragmatist circles, even those most inclined to secularism stand to benefit from Boisvert's thoughtful discussion. Given this perspective, and Boisvert's obviously pluralistic and communi- tarian sympathies, readers may wonder if an argument could not be made from the Deweyan conception of the religious toward substantial philosophical con- ceptions of "religion" and "religions." Equality as individuality of faith or con- fession suggests, beyond the freedom of religion, the need of positive support from distinct religious communities. Certainly the diversity of American religious communities provides some substantial support to our felt need for community and re-emphasis on plural- ism, while also engaging deeply felt traditions. Part of the argument turns on the idea that a purely secular approach to the religious tends to homogenize, that special institutions devoted to ethnic-religious traditions, social orienta- tion, and community inspired piety deserve our tolerance and cooperation, that arguments for religious freedom become somewhat doubtful given only anti- religious or non-religious grounds, and that religious groups have traditionally played crucial roles in social reforms, starting with abolitionism, through the movement for women's suffrage, and continuing in the civil rights movement. There is room to suppose that the prominence of secularism in American soci- ety has interfered with the growth and development of religious liberalism, re- inforced fundamentalist tendencies, and has thus tended to undercut social and political liberalism in general. While the present volume is not designed to deal with these issues folly, Boisvert's detailed account of the Deweyan conception of the religious will prove a useful addition to the growing focus on related questions in contempo- rary pragmatist discussions. In this way, and in many others, the book will doubtlessly assist the current revival of the pragmatist tradition, both as a primer for students, especially those maintaining connections to religious tradi- tions, and as one among other contemporary approaches to Dewey's work.
