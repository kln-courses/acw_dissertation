Hertz Philosophical Lecture, 29th November, 1922. By JAMES WARD. Published for the British Academy. London: Humphrey Milford. Pp. 22. DR. WARD'S Hertz lecture serves as an admirable introduction to his Study of Kant. It is devoted to a statement of the general thesis which the volume expounds in detail. Briefly stated, that thesis is as follows: Kant was " the first effectively to enounce as the supreme principle in the development of all knowledge, the activity of the experient subject itself" (p. 12). Such activity is present both at the lower level of mere perception, and also at the higher, self-conscious level. This distinction appears in the Critique as the distinction between empirical and transcendental ap- perception, the former referring to subjective or individual ex- perience which varies from one experient to another, and the latter to the objective or universal experience which is the same for all. The former type of experience can exist without the latter, but not the latter without the former. Owing to the want of historical sense, characteristic of his time, Kant never raised the question how the higher level of experience has been attained: otherwise Kant " might have seen that transcendental apperception is bound up with transsubjective intercourse, and again that in this discourse of mind with mind, 'winged words' were the medium, so that at length Xo'yos came metonymically to mean that pure reason which Kant was essaying to criticise as the basis of experience " (p. 14). With this limitation, Kant's answer is in its main character clear and unambiguous, namely, that we have universal, a priori, knowledge only of what we have ourselves put into what is known. The answer, that is to say, is propounded in terms of "transcend- ental idealism," and justifies only what Kant entitles "immanent metaphysics ". Upon this we have Dr. Ward's comment: " It will be thought, I fear, somewhat rash to say so, but I must confess that to me an im - manent metaphysics limited to the projection on the Object of at- tributes pertaining to the Subject-more exactly, the interpretation of the World in terms of the Self-is just anthropomorphism. Yet what other construction can we put on Kant's Copernica-n hy- pothesis ? Moreover, Kant himself, more or less unconsciously, furnishes ample justification [in contradiction of his professed deri- vation of them from the table of judgments] for deriving the real categories from what the Subject knows of itself at the social or self-conscious level " (pp. 14-15). Kant's treatment of the Ideas of Reason in the first Critique, of freedom and of the moral postulates in the second Critique, and of subjective purposiveness (beauty) and objective purposiveniess (the organic) in the third Critique, are cited by Dr. Ward as further illustrating the essentially anthro- pomorphic character of Critical teaching.</page><page sequence="2">480 CRITICAL NOTICES: This thesis accounts for the somewhat unusual order of topics in the Study of Kant. The contents fall into two main -divisions. After a quite brief account of Kant's personality and nurture (pp. 1-6), and a more lengthy treatment of his main writings during the pre-Critical period (pp. 6-41), the central teaching of the Critique, especially as given in Kant's deduction of the categories, is ex- pounded and discussed in preliminary fashion (pp. 41-94). Then follow statement and criticism of Kant's positions in the Critique of JTudgment (pp. 94-131). (The Critique of Practical Reason is treated only incidentally, in connexion with the problems raised in the other Critiques.) This division of the volume closes with a summary of the results so far reached (pp. 132-139). In what I may call the second part, Dr. Ward returns upon his steps, and proceeds to examine in greater detail Kant's views in regard to the nature of the self, especially as shown, first in his doctrine of inner sense in the -,Esthetic, in the Analytic, and in the Paralogisms respectively, and secondly, in his doctrine of -freedom and in the dualism, implied therein, between theoretical and practical Reason (pp. 139-189). The volume concludes with a brief account of Kant's Religion within the Limits of Pure Reason (pp. 189-202). Dr. Ward's reasons for the above arrangement connect, as I have said, with his interpretation of the Critical philosophy as being es- sentially anthropomorphic. The first part of the volume gives the evidence in support of this interpretation of Kant's teaching; while the second part treats of the foundation upon which such teaching can alone be made to rest, namely, the self as disclosed in experience. Since Dr. Ward, in this small volume, covers so extensive a field, his argument, I need hatdly say, is very close-packed, and touches upon so many different problems, that it is by no means easy, without entering into undue detail, either to make comment, or to pass criticisms that are not merely external. I shall endeavour to strike a middle course by confining my attention to Dr. Ward's main thesis. But first I must state it in somewhat greater detail, and shall do so as far as possible in Dr. Ward's own words. " Sum- ming up what we find underlying Kant's three Critiquttes and brought to a conclusion in the last: It is our own native spontaneity which leads us to regard the world as made up of living persons- in the widest sense-and of inanimate things. Again it is our own moral character which prompts us to believe in a realm of ends, to which we ourselves-as persons in the stricter sense-belong, and of which the Supreme Head (Oberha,pt) is God. Surely all this is anthropomorphic " (p. 132). This, Dr. Ward contends, is no less true of Kant's teaching in regard to the constitutive categories. "In the end [Kant] came to see directly in the 'transcendental unity of apperception' the common source of them all. . . . As Kant himself has said: ' I am is the original of all objects': on these the permanence and activity of the subject are analogically projected. Here then too, though it is not avowed, the</page><page sequence="3">JAMES WARD, A Study of Kant. Imnmanuel Kant. 481 .anthropomorphic character of Kant's standpoint is, as I have already urged, unmistakeable" (pp. 133-134). The reader will, however, seriously misunderstand Dr. Ward, if he takes these statements as amounting to a condemnation of Kant's procedure. On the contrary, properly interpreted, they represent, in Dr. Ward's view, sound and tenable positions. " Anthropomorphism is Kant's own term; but unfortunately it is a term apt to suggest myths and graven images, fictions which at the best only travesty ,or mask the real truth. To condemn any and every use of it on this ground has seemed to many to be sound criticism: yet it is utterly shallow" (p. 136). Even Locke succumbs to this error, when he avers that "in using [the] term [substance] we still talk like children and remind him of the poor Indian philosopher whom he has immortalised. Kant did far better: he clearly formulated the ' supreme principle of all use of the understanding' which English empiricists with the exception of Berkeley failed to see" (p. 137). Anthropomorphism is not, however, Dr. Ward states, the best term to bring out the significance of this central principle. A pre- ferable term would haye been ' reflexion '-not in the psychological sense in which abstraction is made from the objective factor in ex- perience, but in the sense in which Kant has used the phrase 'transcendental refiexion'. "Here, with all the knowledge we have of both sides, we ponder and review the evolution of the whole. And such is very much what the reflective judgment in the end has turned out to be. . . . Intelligendo se intelligit omnia ilica has been said of God. It is the same truth relatively valid for us, which underlies all the anthropomorphisms to be found in Kant's Critiqutes, whether avowed or not" (p. 138). Thus Dr. Ward's disagreements with Kant are not on' the ground of his anthropomorphism, but because of Kant's failure to recognise the other main positions to which, in consistency, it ought to have committed him. "Like Moses [Kant] guided others to the promised land in which he believed, but which he never reached himself " (p. 139). For it is no promised land, but " the merest mirage," if the distinction between appearance and reality be ap- plied, as Kant does profess to apply it, also to the self, and if, in consequence, any such teaching as that which is embodied in his doctrine of inner sense, be put forward. For the self, from which the analogies derive all their force, is then interpreted in a manner entirely incompatible with their alleged meaning. " His exposure of the rational psychology of the Wolffians may be sound enough as regards the conclusions reached; but it was not sound in the contention from which it started, viz., that the Idea of the Self is simply afocus imaginartius, which reason, unchecked by transcend- ental idealism, mistakes for a thing per se. And he only escaped from the conclusions of a sensationalist psychology like Hume's by unconsciously abandoning the doctrine of inner sense. . . . What he did not see was that ' inner sense ' is a misnomer for something</page><page sequence="4">482 CRITICAL NOTICES: radically different" (p. 171)-namely for the self as experienced in feeling and conation. In Dr. Ward's view this precisely was Kant's most difficult problem, and that in regard to which his failure is most obvious.. " The problem was to hold fast to the reality of the self without at the same time repudiating the doctrine of transcendental idealism, i.e., that the self is only ' given ' by an inner sense and so as phenomenal. Kant had quite rightly started by regarding the real existence of self as the fundamental fact; but then his doctrine of an inner sense cut the ground from under this ultimate position.. No refutation of fallacies supposed to be inherent in 'the very nature of reason' could restore that. Formal errors of reasoning can in- volve no illusions, for illusions are never formal and in questions of fact where there is nothing, there can be no illusion. I cannot say I am nothing, whatever may be meant when I say that I am. The problem, in short, is not as to what this I.may be, the existence of' which every self-conscious being affirms for itself in saying: JI am" (pp. 163-164). Dr. Ward gives a very searching analysis of Kant's teaching on this central issue. Though by universal admission Kant's doctrine of inner sense is one of the least satisfactory parts of his philosophy, such careful following out of its many implications and conse- quences casts much light upon the tacit, underlying assumptions which determine so much of Kant's thinking. The very success of Dr. Ward's criticisms suggest, however, the query, whether Kant can really have intended to give an anthropo- morphic explanation of the origin of the constitutive categories, and so have seriously meant to maintain that such categories as substance and causality are formed in view pf the abiding and active character of the self And are then ascribed by analogy to other existences. That would mean that they do not condition either consciousness or self-consciousness. It would commit Kant to admission of two levels of experience, a merely empirical level, and a higher and subsequent level on which alone the categories are brought into play. Both of these positions are, of course, posi- tions from which Kant started. They represent assumptions which at the opening of the Critical period, as demonstrated by the Reflexionen and other evidence, entirely dominated his thinking. Thus in the Introduction to the Critique of Pure Reason he speaks of empirical judgments as not involving any universal or a priori element. And even subsequent to the completion of the Critique he still in the Prolegomena draws a distinction between judgments of perception and judgments of experience-the latter alone in- volving the use of categories. As Dr. Ward successfully shows, scattered throughout the Critique there are many passages to the same effect, and yet others in, which the anthropomorphic character of the categories would seem to be inculcated. Must we then agree with Dr. Ward's conclusions? Is the interpretation which he pro- pounds the only interpretation possible, or does it not itself create,</page><page sequence="5">JAMES WARD, A Study of Kant. Immanuel Kant. 483 for students of Kant, much more serious difficulties than those with which it enables us to deal ? Why, if Kant started from the ordinary view that experience exists on two distinct levels, did he come to advocate, as on certain occasions he undoubtedly does, the direct counterview ? Why if, from the start, he held the Leibnizian view that knowledge of the categories can be acquired by reflexion upon the nature of the self, did he so completely fail to show how in particular this comes about, or to consider Hume's objections to such. a ' deduction ' of them ? Why, on the other hand, did he so labour and swelt over his ' objective' deduction of the categories, and over his many attempts (as in the second Analogy) to connect them directly with our consciousness of time ? And last, but not least, how came he so misguidedly to undermine his entire position by adopting the doctrine of inner sense ? It is owing to such con- siderations, supported by those parts of the Critique whiCh, in propor- tion as they are late in date of writing, tend to reinforce them, that so many students of Kant, such as Green and Caird, have arrived at an interpretation of Kant's teaching which is almost diametrically opposed to that here presented by Dr. Ward. And that being so, it seems unfortunate that Dr. Ward has not considered this other view, and has not indicated more explicitly his reasons for rejecting it. Instead he has chosen to limit his exposition to what, as regards its main features, may be described as a very fresh and vigorous restatement and further development of that type of interpretation which has been advocated in Germany by Schopenhauer and in this country by iHutchison Stirling. The alternative interpretation represents Kant as advocating a point of view which can hardly be said to have occurred, even as a possibility, to any of his predecessors. It stands in direct conflict with the many assumptions which he inherited from them and which to the last continued to influence his thinking and modes of expression. This point of view can be stated in several different ways, as involving the assertion either (1) that 'the immediate and the mediate are not two kinds of knowledge but two elements in- volved in all knowledge; or (2) that the primary function of the conceptual categories is not to clarify experience but to make it possible, i.e., that universals are necessary for experience, and not merely for its interpretation; or (3) that the categories condition all consciousness, and cannot therefore be initially obtained by any kind of reflective consciousness; or (4) that the categories are what enable cognition always to take the form of recognition, i.e., that the categories are required to make self-consciousness possible, and cannot therefore be subsequently constructed, by means of it. These, obviously, are extremely difficult theses to maintain; and if true, are bound to be of a very revolutionary character. If, -further, they are the theses which Kant was endeavouring to establish, the labours to which he entirely gave bimself up during so many of his best years (1772-1780), and the difficulties which, by his own ac- count, he had to overcome in so doing, at once become intelligible.</page><page sequence="6">484 CRITICAL NOTICES: We shall also be in a position to understand why Kant should not only have been the Father of objective or Hegelian idealism, but also how, precisely in regard to the nature and origin of the categories, he should have exercised a profound influence upon so unqualified an opponent of all anthropomorphism as Mr. S. Alexander (cf., Space, Time and Deity, vol. i., pp. 190-192). Indeed may we not say that just because Kant was bent upon upholding the categories on other than anthropomorphic or subjectivist lines, he was not merely willing to recognise, but himself insistent, that the distinction be- tween appearance and reality applies no less rigorously to the experient than to the experienced, and that the self, from the point of view of knowledge, though not of moral action-is not this anti- thesis (or contradiction) of the very essence of his philosophy ?- should be treated as in no more privileged a position than any other known type of existence? We may agree with much in Dr. Ward's very enlightening criticisms of Kant, as when he dwells upon the unfortunate consequences of Kant's individualism, and points out that when Kant talks of epigenesis he thought only of preformation; we may also deplore Kant's untenable method of distinguishing between appearance and reality and the doctrine of inner sense that goes therewith; and we may therefore readily admit that Kant's treatment of the self is one of the least satisfactory parts of his theoretical philosophy. But to ascribe to Kant so Leibnizian a view of the origin of the categories must seem to many of Dr. Warc's readers, unless he succeeds in converting them from all their previous views in regard to the essentials of Critical teaching, a very questionable procedure, and indeed as amount- ing to a direct attack upon what they have hitherto regarded as perhaps the most far-reaching and fruitful of all Kant's positive contributions. I do not here presume to argue that Dr. Ward is in error, and that it is the other School of interpretation which can alone be approved. Students of Kant are likely to continue to be divided, according as their own philosophical convictions, as to what can possibly be true, determine their outlook; but it is, I think, a legitimate criticism of a work devoted to the exposition of Kant's philosophy, to point out that it fails to deal, in any explicit manner, with one of the two main interpretations which have hitherto prevailed in regard to it. All students of Kant, however, without exception, must be grateful that so great a Master of Philosophy should have turned aside from his own constructive work, to expound, in this most thorough and helpful manner, what he regards as,living, and what he regards as but of antiquarian interest, in Kant's writings. I have not attempted to give an account of Dr. Ward's valuable -to myself the most helpful part of the volume-discussions of Kant's positions in the Critique of Judgment, or of the many other incidental discussions. And in conclusion I may point out that, with the sole exception of Caird's massive volumes, this is the only English work which gives a general account of Kant's philo-</page><page sequence="7">C.
