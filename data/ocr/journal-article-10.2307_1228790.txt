THE PROBLEM The past five decades have seen tremendous growth in both the dimensions and the objects of spending by the federal government. Whether our nation should be characterized as a "welfare state" or as one with a "mixed economy," and regardless of shifts in ideology, fed- eral spending continued to increase at a fairly rapid rate until the last two years.' Moreover, such spending, at least as much as direct federal * Maurice T. Moore Professor of Law, Columbia University.

Some constitutional restrictions on federal spending do exist,2 but they are outside the focus of this article. The more intriguing problems, addressed below, spring from the temptation of Congress3 to attach strings to its expenditures, to coerce recipients into conduct which it might not be able constitutionally to compel if it sought to do so by direct regulation. There may once have been an easy answer: If you don't like the conditions, don't take the money.4 But this answer has become increasingly unsatisfactory in light of the growing depen- dence of recipients, public5 and private,6 upon federal money. Instances regarded as abuses, together with awareness of the poten- tial for more of the same, have given rise to widespread expressions of concern not only for recipients' rights but also for the public interest.7 Fiscal Year Amount (to nearest billion dollars) 1927 3 1937 8 1947 34 1957 77 1967 157 1977 409 1987 1015 (est.)

This article generally refers to the spending power, and to conditions attached to the receipt of benefits from it, in terms of congressional action-both for simplicity and also in recognition of the power of Congress over the federal purse. In many instances, however, Congress does not specifically legislate conditions on federal spending; instead, the executive branch or administrative agencies will impose them, pursuant to delegated or occasionally inherent authority. Thus, with the exception of the discussion of conditional grants in the context of separation of powers, see note 253 infra, the observations herein apply equally whether the strings happen to be imposed by Congress or by some other arm of the federal government. 4.

A large fraction of the money distributed by the federal government to state and local governments is used to meet essential needs of individuals (e.g., for health and education); other portions of it serve business (e.g., for highways and public transportation). Even larger amounts flow directly to individuals, businesses, and private universities in the form of gov- ernment contracts. 7.

Apart from considerations of policy-under what circumstances it is fair, proper, or wise for Congress to impose seemingly onerous condi- tions on recipients of federal funds-large areas of constitutional un- certainty persist concerning the power of Congress to place conditions upon expenditures as a means of regulating conduct that otherwise would lie beyond its control.

Complaints often emanated largely from business sources, for example, with respect to conditions designed to deal with labor relations, employment discrimination, and environ- mental pollution. Different grievances, affecting different constituencies, have emerged more recently. In the medical and related fields, requirements have been imposed that Medicaid funds not be used to pay for abortions, see Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297 (1980) (upholding requirement); that planned parenthood organizations receiving federal money report to the parents of minor girls that they have received requests for contraceptive assistance, see Planned Parenthood Fed'n v.

Yet to hold that Congress may never use conditional spending to coerce conduct that it could not regulate directly may im- pose intolerable limits upon necessary and legitimate governmental action. The answers lie somewhere between, but the boundary lines are hazy and do not stay put.9 The Supreme Court has seldom dealt di- rectly with the validity of conditional federal spending, and its opinions in this area have not been especially helpful. Although what is decided with respect to such spending could render irrelevant many generally accepted doctrines concerning the powers of and limitations upon the federal government, remarkably little scholarly attention has been paid to the problem as an aspect of constitutional law. Constitutional law treatises and casebooks tend to ignore the sub- ject or discuss it only briefly and lightly. Some excellent law review articles bear upon the subject, but with few exceptions they have not treated the problem as raising pervasive issues of the extent of federal governmental power; rather, they have sliced into it from a number of other angles. Some have analyzed the right-privilege distinction and the broader aspects of the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions.10 Others have concentrated on separate portions of the problem, such as conditions imposed on government employment." Intrusions on edu- cational institutions receiving federal funds, and their administrators, teachers, and students, have been a frequent focus,l2 as have a number of aspects of welfare.'3 A substantial amount of scholarship has also been devoted to the effect of conditioned federal spending on the au- 9. The same can, of course, also be said about lines drawn in many other areas of consti- tutional law. 10. See, e.g., French, Unconstitutional Conditions. An Analysis, 50 GEO.

This article is an attempt at a fresh attack on the problem from that vantage point. What constitutional limits, if any, restrain the use of conditional fed- eral spending to coerce conduct that Congress could not regulate di- rectly? Consider three pairs of hypothetical cases to illustrate the difficulty of drawing lines in three areas: (1) the enumerated powers of Congress; (2) immunity of state and local government from oppressive federal interference; and (3) limitations on federal power arising out of constitutional protection of individual rights.15 First, Congress undoubtedly may (as it has since 1862)16 require the teaching of agricultural science in certain colleges it subsidizes, although in the absence of the federal spending such a requirement would probably be beyond any of the powers granted to Congress.17 But may Congress demand, as a condition of a grant of money for an agricultural program, that the university have or not have a football team, or agree that its president was to be selected by a vote of the student body or of Congress? Second, Congress may require, as a condition of a grant to a state of 14. In the wake of National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U.S. 833 (1976), a flurry of articles discussed the possibility that was specifically left open by the majority, id. at 852 n.17, and emphasized by a dissenting opinion, id. at 880, of using conditional spending to control activities of state and local government that the Court in that decision had forbidden Con- gress to handle directly through its regulatory powers. See, e.g., Kaden, Politics, Money, and State Sovereignty: The Judicial Role, 79 COLUM. L.

REV. 577, 591-96, 601 &amp; n.125 (1985). 15. I am indebted to my colleague, Professor Louis Henkin, for the observation that there is another area in which conditional spending by Congress may raise constitutional problems-in connection with the separation of powers between the legislative and executive branches of the federal government. See note 253 infra. 16. 7 U.S.C. ?? 301-305, 307, 308, 322, 326 (1982). 17. Given a sufficient factual showing, the program could probably be sustained today (but certainly not when instituted) under a broad reading of the commerce power. To the extent that, in the early years of the program, subsidies to universities were princi- pally in the form of land grants, congressional authority arguably flowed not from the spend- ing power but from the Constitutional provision that "Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the ... Property belonging to the United States ...." U.S. CONST. art. IV, ? 3. There is no reason to believe, however, that the power of Congress is any less now that subsidies generally take the form of grants of money. See, e.g., 7 U.S.C. ?? 321-326 (1982). 1107 May 1987]</page><page sequence="6">STANFORD LAW REVIEW federal funds for highway construction, that the state officials handling these funds refrain from participating in certain forms of partisan poli- tics.18 But may a grant of these funds be conditioned on adherence to a similar restraint upon the governor or legislators of the recipient state?19 Third, in return for giving financial aid to medical students, we may assume that Congress could require the beneficiaries, after they became qualified, to practice for a specified time in medically or otherwise dis- advantaged areas or to specialize in a type of practice such as family medicine that Congress regarded as underserved.20 But may Congress condition such support upon a commitment to perform or to refrain from performing abortions? The importance of these questions as well as the difficulty of an- swering them spring at least in part from a unique aspect of the condi- tional spending power, one which it does not share with the other principal powers of Congress-the possibility of avoiding fundamental limitations on government power. For example, the validity of an exer- cise of the commerce power21 (traditionally the most important vehicle for federal regulation) requires not only that there be the necessary re- lationship between the legislation and interstate or foreign commerce but also that such constitutional limitations as those protecting civil lib- erties and the autonomy of state and local government not be breached. (Congress may regulate railroads but may not control what their riders read or forbid state officials from traveling.) Similarly, in the case of the taxing power, even though a tax satisfies the compara- tively few express constitutional requirements,22 it still will fall if it im- pinges too greatly upon first or fifth amendment rights,23 or perhaps if it encroaches too far into the autonomy of the states.24 What is differ- ent about the spending power, as opposed to the commerce and taxing powers, is that it is much less clear that conditional spending is invalid 18. See Oklahoma v. United States Civil Serv. Comm'n, 330 U.S. 127 (1947). 19. In addition to the intrusion on state autonomy, the requirement might be attacked as infringing the first amendment rights of voters and candidates for office. See Gordon, The Constitutional Right to Candidacy, 25 U. KAN. L. REV. 545 (1977). 20.

Other questions also remain open, such as the extent to which conditional spending should be upheld because the re- cipient, by accepting the money, may be barred from challenging the condition.25 Thus, the uncertainties as to the scope of constitutional limitations on other powers of Congress are compounded where conditional spending is involved. Part II of this article is intended to fit the subject into a broader perspective. I begin with a short discussion of the initial uncertainties concerning the interpretation of the spending power, leading to the emergence of apparently settled doctrine that the spending power (apart from conditions) is an independent grant of power to Congress, available for, but not restricted to, the implementation of its other pow- ers.26 I then attempt to define the scope of this inquiry: to concentrate on conditional spending; to differentiate conditions that coerce from those that merely classify recipients or set forth the purpose of the spending, and to deal only with the former;27 to consider not only spending specifically authorized for the general welfare, pursuant to ar- ticle I, section 8, clause 1, but also spending to effectuate other powers of the national government;28 to look into the broad and amorphous subject of "unconstitutional conditions" (of which conditional spend- ing is a small part) in search of enlightenment that might be helpful in analyzing coercive conditional federal spending;29 to decide whether conditional tax benefits are so nearly indistinguishable from condi- tional spending as to be a necessary part of the inquiry or whether those principles applying to them are of value only as analogies;30 and to explore whether there are sufficient differences between the use of coercive conditions in connection with grants and with government contracts to justify limiting consideration to the former.31 Part III32 seeks to produce some answers to the principal question that emerges-the extent to which Congress may attach conditions to federal spending that have the effect of regulating conduct that Con- gress would be barred from regulating directly. I first discuss the enu- merated, or "presumptive," powers33 of the federal government, then shift to problems arising out of those limitations designed to preserve 25. See also Ashwander v.

I attempt to develop some separate principles appropriate for each of these areas, to seek out some common denomi- nators, and to justify, or at least explain, the differences among them.34 The conclusions tentatively arrived at may be summarized as follows: First, the requirement that a condition be supported by the pre- sumptive powers of Congress will almost always be met; if the condi- tion cannot be shown to be relevant to the spending to which it is attached or to some other spending program of the federal govern- ment, it can usually be upheld as necessary and proper to the carrying out of some regulatory power of the federal government, especially in the light of the expanded construction of those powers by the Supreme Court since 1937.35 Second, although the Court has never held an exercise of condi- tional spending to constitute an invalid intrusion into state government autonomy, closer scrutiny seems appropriate. The Supreme Court and lower courts have repeatedly assumed that conditional grants that are asserted to interfere with the states are easier to uphold than similar intrusions through direct regulatory action. The Court has also de- clared that political safeguards protect the states sufficiently well from interference through direct federal regulation that judicial intervention is generally not needed. Yet, little or no attention has been given to the possibility that the political safeguards may be least effective when con- ditional funding is under consideration.36 Finally, spending that coerces relinquishment of civil liberties may give rise to a threat to those liberties as serious as that which would result from direct prohibition of their exercise. This suggests that there should be a presumption that conditions that coerce conduct in- truding on individual rights are invalid where direct regulation giving rise to a similar intrusion would be held unconstitutional. Such a pre- sumption should be rebuttable in certain circumstances-if, for exam- ple, the offer of a total package of money plus restriction constitutes a clear enhancement rather than curtailment of the offeree's rights and options, if the offeree has a genuine choice rather than being obliged by financial or other necessity to accept, and if there are no important rights of the public or of third parties that are indirectly sacrificed as a consequence.37 * * * The Constitution cannot be static, any more than can the nation it serves.

[Vol. 39:1103 1110</page><page sequence="9">CONDITIONAL SPENDING Among the more pertinent developments in the present century, these seem to stand out: (i) the adoption of the sixteenth amendment in 1913, followed by tremendous growth of the tax base of the federal government, thus providing the means with which to finance a welfare state and contrib- uting to a political consensus that it is the responsibility of the federal government to do so; (ii) the apparent weakening of the "political safeguards" protec- tion against an expanding federal establishment, especially with respect to spending; (iii) the collapse of the "enumerated power" limitations on the federal government, starting in 1937; and (iv) the expanded protection of individual rights against govern- mental interference, over a longer period of time but again especially since 1937. As a result of these developments, there has been much more fed- eral spending and for many more purposes; a growing temptation of Congress to use its power over funds as leverage to control matters previously almost untouched by any federal presence; a shift in this re- gard from matters relating to the boundaries of the enumerated powers (where direct regulation became increasingly easy to defend) to matters of individual rights and liberties; and a seeming diminution of the abil- ity of the states to muster the political strength to defeat conditional federal spending threatening their autonomy. Cumulatively, these fac- tors have contributed to the increase in importance of conditional fed- eral spending overall, as well as to changes in the areas in which such spending should be cause for greatest constitutional concern and thus for greatest need of judicial oversight. The tentative conclusions sum- marized above are intended to reflect these considerations. II. BACKGROUND AND SCOPE A. The Reach of the Spending Power (Apart from Conditions) Before attempting to examine in depth the power of Congress to use conditional spending as a regulatory device, we should turn briefly to the spending power as such. The specific authorization to spend is in the first paragraph of arti- cle I, section 8, of the Constitution: "The Congress shall have Power to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States; .. ."38 As a textual matter, the key language, "to . . . provide for the . .. general Welfare of the United States," might have been interpreted in at least four different ways: (1) merely as part of a limitation upon the 38. U.S. CONST. art. I, ? 8, cl. 1. 1111 May 1987]</page><page sequence="10">STANFORD LA W REVIEW [Vol. 39:1103 purposes for which Congress may tax; (2) as authorization to Congress to spend money, but only in order to carry out powers specifically con- ferred elsewhere in the Constitution; (3) as a grant of power to spend, without that limitation, but only for general, as distinguished from local or particularistic, purposes; or (4) as empowering Congress to legislate in all respects-to regulate as well as to spend-for the general welfare. The Framers were themselves divided as to the proper construction. Most of the ensuing debate centered upon the second and third of these possible interpretations,39 the second espoused by Madison and the third by Hamilton. Strong arguments, both historical and textual, were made on both sides,40 but the merits of the debate need not greatly concern us now, because the Supreme Court in 1936 accorded its unanimous approval to Hamilton's interpretation (even in the course of rendering a decision that seemed logically consistent only with Madison's approach).41 The paucity of case law as to the scope of the spending power may have been a result of rulings that neither a taxpayer nor a state govern- ment had standing as such to challenge the validity of a federal spend- 39. The first of the four possible conclusions requires that we read in the words "in order" before "to pay the Debts," thus treating the power to spend as effectuating the power to tax, rather than standing separately. One flaw in this analysis is that it ignores the fact that taxes are not the only source of funds for federal spending: Among others, there are also the proceeds of borrowing and the sale of federal property. From a textual standpoint, however, this interpretation would not necessarily be unreasonable, since the one other clause in article I, section 8, with a similar verbal structure-clause 15 ("To provide for calling forth the Mili- tia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions")-has to be construed in just that fashion. This interpretation has not generally been taken seriously, however, and as recently as 1983, Justice Powell, dissenting on other grounds in EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U.S. 226, 268 (1983), stated: "The enumeration of powers in article I, ? 8, begins with the 'Power to lay and collect taxes.' This is followed by the power 'to pay the Debts' of the United States. Then, consistent with the Preamble, comes the power to 'provide for the common Defence and gen- eral Welfare.' " See also Selective Serv. Sys. v. Minnesota Pub. Interest Research Group, 468 U.S. 841, 861 n.4 (1984) (Powell, J., concurring). But cf. United States v. Butler, 297 U.S. 1, 65 (1935) ("The Congress is expressly empowered to lay taxes to provide for the general welfare."); see also id. at 64 ("The true construction undoubtedly is that the only thing granted is the power to tax for the purpose of providing funds for payment of the nation's debts and making provision for the general welfare."); Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 103, 105 (1968) (referring to the "taxing and spending power" in the singular). The fourth possible interpretation had been rejected in 3 J. STORY, COMMENTARIES ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES ch. 14 (1st ed. 1833); the Supreme Court endorsed this analysis in Butler, 297 U.S. at 64, which pointed out that this construction could not be reconciled with the concept of a government of enumerated powers. 40. Story supported Hamilton's interpretation that the power of Congress to spend was not limited to purposes set forth in its other enumerated powers. SeeJ. STORY, supra note 39. Charles Warren disagreed sharply, C. WARREN, THE MAKING OF THE CONSTITUTION 476-79 (1928), finding support for his analysis in Madison's correspondence and in the Convention proceedings, although he conceded that Story's Commentaries had been published prior to the publication of Madison's Notes of Debates. Id. at 479. Madison's Notes were, of course, also unavailable to those who ratified the Constitution and the Justices who interpreted it in its early years; hence the discussion in the Convention can be given only limited weight in inter- preting the language of the document it produced. 41.

United States v. Butler43 (of which more later)44 was an exception. A tax on processors of agri- cultural products, and grants to farmers on the condition that they cur- tailed production, were linked as parts of a comprehensive agricultural assistance program; the Court allowed a processor, which under tradi- tional doctrines had standing to challenge the validity of the tax im- posed on itself, to attack the entire program, which the Court proceeded to declare unconstitutional. Although in Butler the proceeds of the tax were earmarked for the spending program, this seems not to have been decisive, because in the following year, the Court allowed taxpayers under the unemployment insurance and old age pension pro- visions of the Social Security Act to challenge the entire programs even though the tax proceeds went into, and benefit payments were to come out of, general funds.45 Since the flurry of the 1930s, few cases touching upon the constitu- tional dimensions of the federal spending power have reached the Court,46 and in no instance has the Court held that an exercise of that power failed to meet the "general welfare" criterion.47 42. See Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447 (1923). 43. 297 U.S. 1 (1936). 44. See notes 104-105 infra and accompanying text. 45. Steward Mach. Co. v. Davis, 301 U.S. 548 (1937); Helvering v.

Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 90-91 (1976); Ivanhoe Irrigation Dist. v. McCracken, 357 U.S. 275, 294-95 (1958); United States v. Gerlach Live Stock Co., 339 U.S. 725, 738 (1950). There probably have been a few additional cases in which the question arose and was disposed of summarily or without comment. 47. Even in Butler, the Court was careful not to hold that the spending program it invali- dated fell outside the "general welfare." 297 U.S. at 68. The federal test of "general welfare" is probably more permissive than the correspond- ing requirements of some state constitutions. In particular, the Massachusetts doctrine of "public purpose" seems to have been applied much more restrictively than the federal stan- dard. Compare Opinion of theJustices, 347 Mass. 797, 197 N.E.2d 691 (1964) (advisory opin- ion stating that expenditure to help finance election campaigns would be invalid) with Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976) (upholding federal expenditures for similar purposes). Does the phrase "to . . . provide for the . . . general Welfare" expand or contract the power of Congress? Compare Butler, 297 U.S. at 65 ("These words cannot be meaningless, else they would not have been used. The conclusion must be that they were intended to limit and define the granted power to raise and expend money."), with Buckley, 424 U.S. at 90-91 ("Ap- pellants' 'general welfare' contention erroneously treats the General Welfare Clause as a limi- tation upon congressional power. It is rather a grant of power, the scope of which is quite expansive, particularly in view of the enlargement of power by the Necessary and Proper Clause."). The inconsistency is more verbal than real, and the question that should be asked is "compared to what?" Buckley cites Butler in support of its position and does not purport to distinguish or limit it.</page><page sequence="12">STANFORD LA W REVIEW B. The Focus of This Inquiry Few constitutional limitations restrict federal spending as such,48 and they are not the immediate concern of this article. Rather, this arti- cle addresses the conjunction of conditions with spending that may threaten our constitutional balances.49 1. Conditions and conditions. We first need to distinguish two different types of provisos to fed- eral spending, both of which can properly be called "conditions" and have often been dealt with interchangeably by courts and commenta- tors, but which are significantly different. Take, for example, a hypothetical statute that provides for financial aid to students. Among other conditions are the following: (1) The assets and income of the students may not be in excess of certain max- ima set forth by Congress; and (2) the students may not belong to any organization that advocates nuclear disarmament. Both provisions are likely to be expressed by such phrases as "if," "unless," "provided that," "those who," "as long as," or the like. What distinguishes the two categories, however, is that the first type generally defines the eligi- ble recipients of the federal grant in terms at least partly beyond their control; the second has the likely effect (and usually the purpose as well) of influencing their conduct, with the promised carrot of federal funds for those who avoid the type of activity that Congress seeks to discourage or the threatened stick of denial of funds to those who re- fuse. Inattention to this distinction probably accounts for the lack of an appropriate lexicon; for want of better terminology, I shall refer to them respectively as "classifying conditions" and "coercive conditions." This article is concerned with coercive conditions only, because only they relate to the principal question: To what extent may Congress at- tach conditions to federal spending to restrain conduct that the Consti- tution would not permit Congress to control through direct regulation? Conditions that only classify but do not coerce may give rise to a differ- 48. Federal spending in aid of religion may violate the establishment clause of the first amendment. In the unlikely event that Congress sought to pay a debt incurred in aid of the Confederacy (or any other insurrection against the United States) or a claim for loss or eman- cipation of a slave, section 4 of the fourteenth amendment would be a constitutional bar. Increases in the salary of the president during his term would be invalid, see U.S. CONST. art. II, ? 1, cl. 7. Some limitations relate, strictly speaking, to the appropriation power rather than the spending power. Appropriations for the Army for more than two years, see id. art. I, ? 9, cl. 7, and a few others would also be invalid, although it might be difficult to find a plaintiff with standing to challenge at least some of them. Cf. United States v. Richardson, 418 U.S. 166 (1974). 49. Hamilton and Story, as well as Madison, were referring only to spending as such, not to conditions; and to the presumptive powers of Congress and not to limitations on those powers for the protection of state autonomy or individual rights. See note 100 infra. 1114 [Vol. 39:1103</page><page sequence="13">CONDITIONAL SPENDING ent set of constitutional issues, principally related to equal protection, which has generated its own substantial body of case law and scholarly commentary. Coercive conditions, however, have received compara- tively little attention. I stress this distinction to place the subject of this article into sharper focus-not to offer a touchstone for separating valid from inva- lid conditions. Either type of condition might or might not be constitu- tional, depending on the circumstances. Lest the hypothetical case of financial aid to students be thought to imply that classifying conditions are generally valid but coercive conditions are not, another pair of hy- potheticals involving student aid will suggest the opposite: A classify- ing condition that financial aid be given only to male students would presumably be unconstitutional although no conduct was coerced thereby; a condition that financial aid was to be continued only for those students who maintained passing grades would be permissible even though the condition would be likely to influence the behavior of the recipients. By stressing the difference between the two types of conditions, I do not imply that watertight compartments exist. Even unconditional spending may influence conduct; for example, the availability of welfare funds can affect recipients' living habits. A pure classifying condition might be one that defined eligibility in terms that were outside of the control of the potential recipients-funds for men only or for people over sixty-five. But many types of classifying conditions may have some influence on conduct. Federal research grants for physics students may shape the choice of careers; indeed, inducement of such decisions may be one of the purposes of the legislation. Although some conditions seem to straddle the dividing line,50 and others have both coercive and classifying elements,51 distinguishing be- tween such conditions is important, especially for testing whether the condition seeks to control conduct which Congress could not regulate directly. An additional, related, caveat is appropriate. In referring to coer- cive conditions, I do not mean to include expressions of the purpose of the expenditure itself-the agreed quid pro quo of a contract for gov- ernment employment, for the purchase of property, or for the scholarly or other performance expected from the recipient of a grant. My con- cern is rather with provisions that would regulate extraneous conduct. As Justice Holmes noted, anyone accepting employment (government or private) impliedly waives his or her constitutional right to remain idle.52 Analytically, such a condition might be deemed "coercive," but 50. See note 63 infra. 51. See note 64 infra. 52. McAuliffe v. New Bedford, 155 Mass. 216, 220, 29 N.E. 517, 517-18 (1892); see also Hale, supra note 10, at 357-58. And in a contractual exchange of services or property for May 1987] 1115</page><page sequence="14">STANFORD LA W REVIEW both the purpose and effect are to offer a benefit or desired exchange rather than to impose controls. The same can be said about contracts for the purchase of goods or other property.53 These are not the sort of indirect regulation of conduct that is predominantly coercive and to which this article is largely addressed.54 In sum, classifying conditions may always be with us; except perhaps for "revenue sharing" without strings and certain other types of block grants, the objects or recipients of spending always need to be speci- fied. Any constitutional difficulties that arise with this type of condition will generally relate to questions of equal protection or occasionally to a challenge as a bill of attainder.55 On the other hand, coercive condi- tions may raise questions concerning the validity and effect of the con- sent of a recipient-questions that would be irrelevant to the analysis of classifying conditions. Thus, the coercive condition tends to implicate the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions,56 whereas the classifying condition does not. If there has been insufficient recognition of the fundamental differ- ence between the two types of conditions, there is a likely explanation. For a long time, the constitutionality of attempts by Congress to deter- mine both who should receive government funds, and also on what terms, was generally treated as a single question; courts tended to up- hold both almost automatically on the same premise-that Congress' power in this area was unrestricted. For example, assertions of immu- nity from scrutiny of decisions as to who should receive a government procurement contract or who should be employed by the government or its contractors,57 and restrictions to be imposed on the conduct of such contractors or employees,58 were often based on the same pur- ported analogy to a private business. A private business is normally free from constitutional restraint both as to the choice of its contracting money, there is no constitutional right to receive the money without tendering the services or property. 53. The test is not how the transaction would be characterized under the law of con- tracts, whether a condition would be deemed "express," "implied," or "constructive," see E. FARNSWORTH, CONTRACTS ?? 8.2, 8.9 (1982), or even whether the transaction should be char- acterized as a contract or a gift. 54. Some borderline cases will undoubtedly exist, but there is a common-sense dividing line, which in most instances can be easily discerned, between such loss of freedom as is usually an inherent accompaniment of entering into a contract and the attempt of government to regulate conduct that is not central to the transaction or relationship being created.

Thus what often passed for conceptual underpinning was the premise that government employment or contracts were "privi- leges," which could be granted or withheld by the government for any reason or no reason at all.59 In attacking either type of condition, therefore, opponents challenged the same assumption of constitution- ally unlimited congressional power to impose it.60 Whether or not they prevailed,61 judicial and academic attention has seldom been focused on the distinction between the two types.62 One final note: From time to time, we may encounter hybrid condi- tions containing some of the characteristics of both the classifying and coercive types,63 as well as instances of federal funds that were subject 59. See note 78 infra. 60. See, e.g., United Pub. Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75 (1947) (upholding ? 9 of the Hatch Act, which forbade most federal civil servants, on penalty of dismissal, from engaging in certain forms of partisan political activity). Although the issue in Mitchell was the validity of coercive conditions to employment, the petitioners sought to analogize the case to a variety of hypothetical coercive and classifying conditions that would have been clearly invalid: "Con- gress may not 'enact a regulation providing that no Republican, Jew or Negro shall be ap- pointed to federal office, or that no federal employee shall attend Mass or take any active part in missionary work.'" Id. at 100. 61. In response, the Court in Mitchell agreed that the hypothetical conditions put for- ward by the petitioners would have been invalid, but contrasted them with the comparatively modest limitations on political activity imposed by the Hatch Act. It did not allude to the distinction between classifying and coercive conditions. Id. 62. For a noteworthy exception, however, see American Communications Association v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 417 (1950) (Frankfurter, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The case involved not the spending power but the constitutionality of a provision of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 that denied the benefits of certain protections of the Na- tional Labor Relations Act to labor unions whose officers had not filed "non-Communist" affidavits. Id. at 385-86. In the course of his opinion denying that Congress had unlimited power to subject privileges it conferred to either kind of condition, Justice Frankfurter clearly treated them as two separate types: Congress in affording a facility [cannot] subject it to any condition it pleases.... Congress may withhold all sorts of facilities for a better life but if it affords them it cannot make them available in an obviously arbitrary way or exact surrender of free- doms unrelated to the purpose of the facilities. Id. at 417 (emphasis added); see also Willcox, supra note 10, at 13-15 (pointing out that the courts had come further toward accepting the first part than the second part ofJustice Frank- furter's dichotomy). Willcox was especially critical of the failure of the courts to strike down interference with free expression by means of loyalty and security tests.

REV. 143, 155 (1958); Van Alstyne, supra note 10, at 1454-57 (suggesting that unreasonable coercive conditions attached to privi- leges awarded by government may be treated as violations of equal protection). 63. For example, the Court in Califano v. Aznavorian, 439 U.S. 170 (1978), upheld an amendment to the Social Security Act denying certain benefits to persons out of the country for more than a month. The Court held the classification to be reasonable; as to coercion, it balanced the economic considerations that had presumably influenced Congress against what it regarded as the less-than-basic importance of the right to international travel and the com- paratively small deterrent effect of the statute on such travel. The Court in Selective Service System v. Minnesota Public Interest Research Group, 468 U.S. 841 (1984), upheld the denial of federal financial aid to certain male students who failed to register for the draft. Since students could qualify by late registration, the condition did more than classify. The availability of that option was invoked by the Supreme Court's major- ity as one of its reasons for rejecting the claim that the statute constituted a bill of attainder. Id. at 849-50. As will be discussed more fully, see notes 209-211 infra and accompanying text,</page><page sequence="16">STANFORD LA W REVIEW [Vol. 39:1103 to both types of conditions.64 But the fact that conditions occasionally seem to straddle the dividing line, and that a single spending authoriza- tion or appropriation may include both types of condition, does not, I believe, vitiate the validity of the point that classifying and coercive conditions are separate species,65 each with its own characteristics and its distinctive potential constitutional infirmities. 2. The power to spend and the spending power. Article I, section 8, clause 1 empowers Congress "to pay the Debts this seems to be a clear example of a coercive condition, although neither the majority nor dissenting opinions puts the case in those terms. In Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297 (1980), the Court upheld the Hyde Amendment, which excepted from federal Medicaid assistance funding of even medically needed abortions (while continuing to finance childbirth). The case also involved both classifying and coercive as- pects-the former in the sense of a decision as to what to fund and what not to fund, the latter in the pressure that it may have placed on pregnant but poor women to carry rather than abort. See text accompanying notes 242-247 infra. Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398 (1963), involved state rather than federal law, but could as readily have arisen under the federal spending power. South Carolina sought to bar from its unemployment benefits a Seventh Day Adventist who refused, for religious reasons, to work on Saturdays. The Supreme Court held this an unconstitutional coercive condition that applied economic pressure to persuade adherents of a religion to violate its tenets and thus forbidden under the free exercise clause. Id. at 403-06. It could also have been regarded as a classifying condition that excluded Sabbatarians from unemployment benefits, with resulting equal protection infirmities. 64. A statute containing separate classifying and coercive conditions, if challenged on appropriate grounds, would presumably have to satisfy the constitutional requirements for both types of conditions in order to be upheld. For example, the Court in Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U.S. 448 (1980), upheld a federal statute requiring that at least 10% of federal funds granted for certain public works projects of state or local governments be used by the grantee to procure products or services from minority-owned businesses. To that extent, a coercive condition was attached to the grant. And if the grantee's prime contractors did not meet the 10% target, they in turn had to let sufficient subcontracts to minority-owned business to satisfy the standard- again, seemingly coercive. But the real purpose of the requirement, to shunt a certain amount of business to minority members, more closely resembled a condition drawing a benign racial line to classify those ultimately expected to perform the work. There was no opinion of the Court, but neither the three opinions of the 6-Justice major- ity nor the two opinions of the dissenting Justices suggested that the government was free to make contracts or offer grants on any terms it chose. There seemed to be little disagreement that the spending power was at least as broad as the commerce power and the power to imple- ment the fourteenth amendment, see id. at 474-75 (Burger, CJ., plurality opinion), and that the main difficulty was in deciding whether the use of racial criteria for singling out benefi- ciaries violated equal protection. Thus, the issue was joined almost entirely on the propriety of the classification under which 10% of the work had to be done by minority-owned busi- nesses; the coercive aspects of the requirement never really emerged. 65. For breakdowns of conditions along different lines, see Kreimer, supra note 10, at 1293; O'Neil, supra note 13, at 448-52. Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U.S. 603 (1960), may be thought of as an example of Congres- sional use or abuse of coercive conditions, but on analysis appears to be something else. The Flemming Court upheld the constitutionality of an amendment to the Social Security Act that denied benefits to persons deported for certain specific reasons. The appellee, an alien, had been deported because of membership, some years earlier, in the Communist Party, one of the designated grounds for deportation. The condition could not have been coercive in his case, but might have had some deterrent effect on aliens contemplating Communist Party membership after enactment of the amendment. 1118</page><page sequence="17">CONDITIONAL SPENDING and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States; . . ." Specific authorizations to pay federal debts and to fund national defense appear to have been unnecessary: The power to borrow money (clause 2) would be hollow indeed if the government could not repay its debts; the power to declare war (clause 11), to raise and support armies (clause 12), and to provide and maintain a navy (clause 13), among others involving national defense, clearly imply the power to pay for their costs. Even a narrow reading of the necessary and proper clause (clause 18) would leave no doubt that Congress could spend for these purposes even if there were no specific spending power. The remaining purpose, to provide for the general welfare, thus stands alone; under the prevailing Hamiltonian interpretation it is broad enough to authorize spending that cannot be justified as imple- menting other enumerated powers.66 In addition to debt and defense payment, however, there are a host of other federal powers whose exercise costs money. Congress seldom, if ever, refers, in the text of a statute or in the debates or committee reports leading to its enactment, to the specific constitutional provision that justifies an expenditure. Nor have the courts in those few cases in which they have ruled upon the validity of coercive conditions paid much attention to the constitutional grant of power on which the spending had been predicated.67 The Supreme Court's analysis of the constitutionality of the Hatch Act's limitations on the partisan political activity of a roller in the United States Mint68 did not touch upon whether the salary of the affected employee had been provided pursu- ant to the power to spend for the general welfare or the power to coin money. Nor did it matter, in considering similar restraints on state offi- cials handling federal highway money69 whether the funds were spent under the commerce power or for the general welfare. There is no rea- son why it would, or should, affect the analysis of constitutionality of coercive conditions attached to federal funds if the expenditure hap- pened to be sustainable only under the power to provide for the gen- eral welfare. This article is therefore concerned with coercive conditions attached to federal spending generally, and not limited to those narrow situa- tions (if, indeed, they could be identified) in which the spending was stated to be, or necessarily had to be, predicated solely on that spend- ing power specifically set forth in article I, section 8, clause 1, or even more narrowly, in the general welfare portion of that clause. 66. See notes 39-40 supra and accompanying text. 67. The reference to the "spending power, art. I, ? 8, cl. 1" in the caveat to National League of Cities v.

As mentioned above, questions concerning the validity of coercive federal spending are part of a broader subject, usually referred to as that of "unconstitutional conditions." That topic has had a long and convoluted history, and the general principles that have evolved from that history are seldom useful in solving specific cases. Not surpris- ingly, although pronouncements concerning unconstitutional condi- tions do cast some light on our problem, they offer little help in resolving it. The general question is whether the power of government-federal, state, or local-to deny a privilege includes the power to grant it on any terms, including the surrender of an otherwise applicable constitutional right. The prevailing approach for some years had been to uphold such a power. For example, since a state could exclude a foreign corpora- tion from doing local business within its borders, the state was permit- ted to condition the corporation's authorization to do such business upon its surrender of the right to remove cases from the state to the federal courts.70 And, upholding the right of a city government to con- dition continued employment on abstention from political activity, Oli- ver Wendell Holmes, then Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, made the oft-quoted statement: "The petitioner may have a constitutional right to talk politics, but he has no constitutional right to be a policeman."71 As might have been expected, this approach did not escape criti- cism, on both practical72 and theoretical73 grounds. But a seeming 180-degree turn by the Supreme Court was just as vigorously at- tacked.74 Frost &amp; Frost Trucking Co. v. Railroad Commission75 invalidated a state regulation that required a private carrier, as a condition for the privilege of using the public streets (which it was assumed could be completely denied), to become a common carrier. The Court stated that "[i]f the state may compel the surrender of one constitutional right as a condition of its favor, it may, in like manner, compel a surrender of 70. E.g., Doyle v. Continental Ins. Co., 94 U.S. 535 (1876), overruled, Terral v. Burke Constr. Co., 257 U.S. 529 (1922). 71. McAuliffe v. New Bedford, 155 Mass. 216, 220, 29 N.E. 517, 517 (1892). Following his appointment to the Supreme Court, Justice Holmes at first adhered to the same views concerning conditions. See, e.g., Pullman Co. v. Adam, 189 U.S. 420 (1903); Western Union Co. v. Kansas, 216 U.S. 1, 53 (1910) (Holmes,J., dissenting). But his views apparently shifted in subsequent years. See United States ex rel. Milwaukee Social Democratic Publishing Co. v. Burleson, 255 U.S. 407, 421-23, 430-32 (1921) (Brandeis, J., dissenting) (opinion in which Holmes, J., noted his agreement "in substance"); id. at 436-38 (Holmes, J., dissenting); Will- cox, supra note 10, at 29-30 (citing cases). 72.

It is inconceivable that guaranties embedded in the Constitution of the United States may thus be manipulated out of existence."76 Courts and commentators have gradually accepted the conclusion that neither extreme can be justified.77 Whether the conferring of a privilege78 may or may not be conditioned on conduct which could not otherwise be compelled admits of no categorical answer. Deductive logic fails to provide solutions,79 and, as in so many other areas of law, decisions must be predicated upon some form of balancing of interests. Not surprisingly, therefore, when we return to the narrower ques- tion of conditional offers of federal funds, we find comparatively little guidance in unconstitutional condition doctrine. Where the validity of coercive conditions on spending has been under consideration, the growing tendency of the Supreme Court has been to weigh them case by case rather than to try to resolve them by reference to some broad formulation relating to unconstitutional conditions. Thus, in United Public Workers v. Mitchell,80 upholding some restraints imposed by the Hatch Act8l on partisan political activities of federal employees, both the majority and the dissenters proceeded by balancing the interests Congress intended to foster against the deprivations imposed.82 And 76. 271 U.S. at 594 (Sutherland, J.).

Some of the decisions upholding the imposition of conditions drew distinctions be- tween "rights" and "privileges"-the notion being that the government could not impose conditions upon the exercise of a right but could do so in connection with the granting of a privilege. The granting of governmental funds was regarded as falling within the latter cate- gory; so, presumably, was the awarding of a government procurement contract or a govern- ment job. The right-privilege dichotomy is not helpful. If a right is something government may not withhold and a privilege something which it may, we have an invitation to circular reasoning: If it is only a privilege, it may be withheld, and because it may be withheld it is only a privilege.

Valeo,83 that Congress (a) could not constitution- ally impose ceilings upon expenditures by candidates for public office, but (b) could impose such ceilings upon candidates who accepted gov- ernment money for their campaigns, the Court not only said nothing about unconstitutional conditions but gave no indication that it thought that the co-existence of both holdings even gave rise to a problem.84 Again, in a single week in July 1984, the Court decided two cases involving conditions linked to federal funds, with little reference to broader doctrines concerning unconstitutional conditions (and no cross reference in either case to the other). In Federal Communications Commission v. League of Women Voters,85 the Court invalidated a prohibi- tion of editorializing by broadcasters who received federal grants from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The majority opinion seemed to treat the case as though it involved direct regulation challenged on first amendment grounds and apparently gave no weight to the fact that the prohibition was predicated upon the provision of federal funds. In his dissenting opinion, Justice Rehnquist (joined by Chief Justice Bur- ger and Justice White) relied in part on the federal funding factor in seeking to uphold the prohibition and found it necessary to distinguish the "so-called 'unconstitutional condition' cases."86 A separate dissent byJustice Stevens87 argued for upholding the ban on the ground that it was a proper device for insulating broadcasters from the pressures that might accompany government funding.88 And in Selective Service System v. Minnesota Public Interest Group,89 the Court upheld, without reference to unconstitutional conditions by either the majority or the dissent, a denial of federal financial aid to students who had failed to register for the draft.90 Constitutional law, like all law, may be a seamless web, but the gen- eral discussions of unconstitutional conditions as such do not eliminate the further need for an analysis focused specifically upon coercive con- ditions on federal spending.

They are occasionally in- voked in this article, where they seem useful. But the problems of conditional spending by the federal government appear to warrant sep- arate treatment.91 Distinct concerns that relate to the powers of the federal government spring from deeply seated traditions of federalism and special attention to the protection of civil liberties from threats at the national level. Limitations on government that reflect these factors have their own significance and their ownjustifications. General princi- ples as to unconstitutional conditions, if there are any, would be far too blunt to serve as tools to separate valid from invalid conditional spending. 4. Tax benefits and federal spending. Should tax benefits-exemptions, deductions, and credits-be re- garded as equivalent to spending, and conditional tax benefits be part of the main focus of this article rather than a peripheral area helpful only by way of analogy? Some conditional tax benefits are essentially indistinguishable eco- nomically from conditional grants, and the leading Supreme Court case that led to much of the judicial tolerance of conditional spending in subsequent years involved conditional tax credits as well as grants.92 The Court has also occasionally appeared to treat tax benefits as consti- tutionally equivalent to spending.93 Nevertheless, the two have generally been treated as different, both politically and constitutionally. Tax policy has intruded, and still does, into subjects that Congress could not regulate either directly or proba- bly through spending. A prime example is in connection with the es- tablishment clause: Tax exemption of church property and tax deductions for contributions in aid of religion have seldom been chal- lenged and never invalidated; yet direct government spending for simi- lar purposes would generally be unconstitutional.94 We have also come to accept without question the power of Con- gress to predicate significant tax consequences upon such matters be- yond its regulatory powers as marriage and divorce, the number of children in a family, and the like. In most instances, however, the coer- cive effect of such conditional tax benefits is minimal. An extra thou- sand dollars or so in an income tax exemption is neither intended to 91.

A few people might decide whether to marry or not on the basis of the differ- ential tax treatment, which is in some circumstances favorable, in others unfavorable, but the same would appear to be true where we apply similar criteria to government grants in comparable amounts, separately or as part of a welfare package.95 This article will deal with conditional tax benefits that may be char- acterized as coercive and that involve the same considerations as analo- gous types of spending. But comparatively few examples will fit well. 5. Grants versus contracts. Should our inquiry be addressed only to grants, or are the issues raised in connection with government payments for the performance of contracts-especially employment and procurement contracts-suffi- ciently similar to require their inclusion? Both areas were once dealt with by the now discredited doctrine that the government was offering a privilege that could be withheld ar- bitrarily or conditioned on any terms the grantor chose. The more modern approach recognizes that there may be factual differences be- tween the two categories that suggest different results. For example, a stronger case exists for allowing the government to condition federal employment on abstention from partisan politics96 than for applying the same condition to welfare recipients; on the other hand, there may be more justification to uphold warrantless entry into the homes of those receiving benefits under the Aid to Families with Dependent Chil- dren (AFDC) program97 than into the homes of government workers. But the differences in the weight of constitutional arguments spring from factual differences and resulting shifts in the balance of reasona- bleness-not from anything inherent in grants or contracts.98 Any attempt to draw a distinction between grants and contracts would also encounter difficult questions of characterization. Is a loan a "grant" or a "contract"? If with interest? What if the interest is below prevailing rates? Should provision of money to a university for theoret- ical scientific research be deemed a grant or a contract? Or does the answer depend on what government forms are used? Note that United States v. Butler,99 which included the Supreme Court's earliest substan- tive treatment of the federal power to spend for the general welfare, involved explicit contracts between farmers and the government.

Grants tend to be more characteristic of spending for the general welfare, but there can be contracts for the provision of welfare services and there can be grants for highway improvement or transit subsidies under the commerce power. * * * I have chosen this focus and these emphases because they appear to be what most need to be explored-not unconstitutional conditions generally; not grants only, to the exclusion of contracts; not classifying conditions; but the degree to which constitutional limitations may be ruptured by the expanded use and misuse of coercive conditional spending. III. COERCIVE CONDITIONS TO FEDERAL SPENDING A. The Presumptive Powers100 of the Federal Government The Framers conceived of the Constitution as establishing a federal system that, among other things, delegated only certain powers to the national government.101 Although the scope of the powers so delegated has expanded enor- mously over time, some limits still exist. Because of these limits, the threshold inquiry in analyzing an attempted exercise of federal power is whether the action is warranted under the presumptive powers of Con- gress. Even if easily answered in the affirmative, this question is at least theoretically antecedent to questions of possible collisions with limita- tions on governmental power, such as, for example, those set forth in the Bill of Rights. The Constitution empowers Congress to spend in order to provide for the general welfare of the United States and also in order to carry out its other enumerated powers. Congress may presumptively impose regulations reasonably germane to the purpose of a spending program as conditions to the award of funds, even though they coerce conduct 100. A reference to "the powers" of Congress or of the federal government tends to be ambiguous. Although it would clearly include the powers enumerated in article I, section 8, as well as those conferred elsewhere, it might or might not be understood to take into account limitations placed upon those powers by the Bill of Rights, the need to preserve the autonomy of the states, and such other restraints as may be derived from text or history. I have used the phrase "presumptive powers" to refer to the powers granted prima facie, but without regard to any of those limitations. Here and elsewhere in this article, I have found it helpful to treat questions relating to presumptive powers separately from those relating to limitations. For many purposes, however, we have a single integrated Constitution, and there is, of course, a danger that over- analysis may give rise to a tendency to treat as two or more issues what in reality is a single one. Cf Reid v. Covert, 354 U.S. 1, 44 (1957) (Frankfurter, J., concurring in result). 101. This understanding of the original Constitution was reinforced by the tenth amend- ment. For a brief summary of the dispute as to whether that amendment imposed any addi- tional restraint upon the federal government, see note 105 infra. 1125 May 1987]</page><page sequence="24">STANFORD LA W REVIEW [Vol. 39:1103 that Congress, even presumptively, could not command.'02 Even con- ditions that cannot meet this test of relevance may nevertheless be up- held either if they are relevant to some other federal spending program or if they could have been enacted directly as regulations pursuant to some other constitutional power. These conclusions are equally valid regardless of whether the condi- tions challenged were part of the same legislation providing for the spending, part of some other unrelated enactment, or an across-the- board limitation on broad categories for which federal funds are spent, such as government contracts, grants, or employment.'03 Such differ- ences in form may be important in ascertaining the intent of Congress, but not its power. Only one Supreme Court case has invalidated conditional spending as going beyond the presumptive powers of Congress: In United States v. Butler,104 the Court held that payments to farmers who agreed to cur- tail acreage or production were unconstitutional. Although the major- ity opinion referred to the coercion of farmers, its main thrust was that Congress, by tying conditions concerning crop reductions to its grants, was trying to regulate a subject over which it had been accorded no power.'05 But the next year, following (whether or not influenced by) President Roosevelt's Court-packing plan, a new majority of the same 102. See United States v. Butler, 297 U.S. 1, 83 (1936) (Stone, J., dissenting): Expenditures would fail of their purpose and thus lose their constitutional sanction if the terms of payment were not such that by their influence on the action of the recip- ients the permitted end would be attained. The power of Congress to spend is insep- arable from persuasion to action over which Congress has no legislative control. This should scarcely surprise us. We take for granted, for example, that conduct is often shaped to minimize taxes, and much tax legislation is enacted with the conscious purpose of taking advantage of that motivation in order to achieve Congressional purposes. Cf J.W. Hampton, Jr., &amp; Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 394, 412 (1928); THE FEDERALIST No. 12 (A. Hamilton); Cushman, Social and Economic Control Through Federal Taxation, 18 MINN. L.

The government disclaimed any argument that the program could be upheld under the commerce power. Butler, 297 U.S. at 64. With the dramatic expansion in the Court's interpretation of that power within the next few years, an opposite result could easily have been achieved. See, e.g., Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111 (1942); Mulford v. Smith, 307 U.S. 38 (1939). But even without regard to the change in scope of the commerce power, the Butler major- ity opinion can be questioned. Because it conceded that the power to spend for the general welfare was not limited to spending for purposes set forth in the enumerated powers, 297 U.S. at 66, and because the conditions challenged were reasonable devices for effectuating the purposes of the spending, how could the Court have held that Congress had gone wrong? A possible explanation is that the Court was still moved by the theory of"dual federalism"-i.e., that an exercise of the legislative powers of Congress was required not only to fall within those powers enumerated or otherwise conferred by the Constitution, but that in addition it might not cross the line into realms reserved for the states: We are not now required to ascertain the scope of the phrase "general welfare of the United States" or to determine whether an appropriation in aid of agriculture falls within it. Wholly apart from that question, another principle embedded in our Con- 1126</page><page sequence="25">May 1987] CONDITIONAL SPENDING 1127 nine Justices effectively demolished some of the premises of the Butler case even while purporting to distinguish it. In Steward Machine Co. v. Davis,'06 the Court upheld the unemployment insurance program pro- vided in the Social Security Act; a keystone of this program was a fed- eral tax on employers, coupled with a ninety percent credit against the tax granted only to employers in states that adopted their own unem- ployment compensation plans meeting federal standards. The Court demonstrated that unemployment was general and national in scope rather than local, but the same could have been said about the collapse of farm prices that had led to the legislation invalidated in Butler.107 Moreover, in contrast to the Court's references in Butler to coercion of farmers, the Court in Steward Machine stressed that the states had wel- comed the establishment of the federal program. Realistically, how- ever, they had no choice but to go along with it, since the alternative would have made their citizens pay the entire federal tax but with no assurance that they would receive an unemployment insurance pro- gram in return. 08 stitution prohibits the enforcement of the Agricultural Adjustment Act. The act in- vades the reserved rights of the states. Id. at 68; cf. Hammer v. Dagenhart, 247 U.S. 251, 276 (1918) ("[T]he act in a twofold sense is repugnant to the Constitution. It not only transcends the authority delegated to Congress over commerce but also exerts a power as to a purely local matter to which the federal author- ity does not extend."). This theory, and its textual corollary that the tenth amendment reduced the powers of the federal government, were both rejected by a unanimous Court in United States v. Darby, 312 U.S. 100, 116-17, 123-24 (1941). The amendment states but a truism that all is retained which has not been surren- dered. There is nothing in the history of its adoption to suggest that it was more than declaratory of the relationship between the national and state governments as it had been established by the Constitution before the amendment or that its purpose was other than to allay fears that the new national government might seek to exercise powers not granted, and that the states might not be able to exercise fully their re- served powers. From the beginning and for many years the amendment has been construed as not depriving the national government of authority to resort to all means for exercise of a granted power which are appropriate and plainly adapted to the permitted end. Id. at 124 (citations omitted). Dual federalism, along with textual reliance on the tenth amendment rather than on the implied intention of the Framers to continue the viability of state government, had a limited and perhaps brief revival in National League of Cities v.

The recipients of grants for curtailing crop production in Butler did surrender some freedoms for money. The beneficiaries of unemployment insurance, however, were to receive it free and clear, and it was the state governments that suf- fered whatever pressure was imposed. As will be seen, judicial solici- tude for state autonomy has generally been less vigorous than that for private rights. Moreover, in Steward Machine, the Court could rely on a history of attempts by many states to establish effective unemployment insurance programs, consistently frustrated by the competitive disad- vantage encountered by states that tried to do it alone.'09 State-by- state efforts to cope with the depression in agriculture would probably also have been futile, but there was no comparable record in Butler of attempts, and failures, by the states to cope without federal help. Dis- tinguishable or not, and even though technically involving a conditional tax credit 10 rather than a conditional grant, Steward Machine has set the tone for almost a half-century since."' sufficiently general to satisfy the constitutional language. Perhaps if the statutory scheme in- validated in Butler had not involved production limitations but merely the tax on processors and unconditional grants to farmers, the Court would have upheld it. 109. 301 U.S. at 587-89. 110. The Court in Steward Machine relied in part on Florida v. Mellon, 273 U.S. 12 (1927). Florida's constitution had forbidden estate and inheritance taxes, presumably with the hope of inducing wealthy elderly persons to reside there. Congress provided for an 80% credit against the federal estate tax for state death duties paid. Florida's argument that the federal credit was invalid because designed to coerce states into adopting estate or inheri- tance taxes was rejected by a unanimous Court (in an opinion in which considerations of standing and substance were intertwined). The example of Florida v. Mellon probably influ- enced the drafters of the unemployment insurance parts of the Social Security Act. The sug- gestion that this approach be considered may in fact have been privately advanced by two Justices of the Supreme Court. See Nathanson, The Extra-Judicial Activities of Supreme Court Jus- tices: Where Should the Line Be Drawn? (Book Review), 78 Nw. U.L. REV. 494, 509-10 (1983). Interestingly, the Court in Steward Machine failed to refer to a decision of the Court only a year earlier, which had invalidated a partially analogous statute that imposed an excise tax on coal mining companies but offered a 90% credit to mining companies that adhered to a feder- ally prescribed labor code. See Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U.S. 238, 288-89 (1936). The fact that seven principal coal-mining states appeared as amici curiae in support of the consti- tutionality of the statute, stressing the incapacity of the several states to cope with the national problem of depressed conditions in the coal mining industry, apparently cut no ice. In Carter, the government had relied unsuccessfully on the commerce power. Another possible distinc- tion was the greater tolerance of coercion of the states as compared to coercion of private persons or entities. Cf. text accompanying notes 260-270 infra. 111. Challenges to the validity of conditions to federal spending have at times been ex- pressed in terms of substantive due process rather than lack of presumptive authority. See G. GUNTHER, CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 215 (11th ed. 1985); Unconstitutional Conditions, 73 HARV. L. REV. 1595, 1599-600 (1960) (student author); cf. Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111, 131 (1942) ("It is hardly lack of due process for the Government to regulate that which it subsidizes."). Somewhat similar references to due process have appeared in other contexts from time to time. See, e.g., Frothingham v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 480 (1923) (unsuccessful attempt of a taxpayer to obtain standing to challenge an allegedly invalid federal expenditure on the ground that that portion of her taxes constituted a taking of her property without due process of law); Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U.S. 603, 611 (1960) (deprivation of Social Security benefits for arbitrary reasons would be a denial of due process, but forfeiture in that case (because the pensioner had been deported by reason of earlier membership in the Communist Party) served a rational government purpose). It was contended at one time before the Court that taxing and spending by state govern- 1128</page><page sequence="27">CONDITIONAL SPENDING Where conditions are designed to prevent a spending program from having harmful side effects, that in itself will usually be sufficient for the conditions to be deemed necessary and proper to the spending pro- gram and sustainable on that basis alone. For example, because Con- gress has the power to fund urban renewal projects, it should also be held authorized to take measures to ensure that substitute housing is provided for those dispossessed by such projects. We can analogize to another power of Congress: The power to conduct a war implies the power to regulate some of the consequent distortions of the economy, such as shortages of housing and food."2 Cushman pointed out, in criticism of Hammer v. Dagenhart, 13 that the power of Congress to regu- late commerce implies the power to prevent use of the instrumentalities of commerce to do harm: "When a man is given charge of a gun or an axe he is expected not merely to keep it in repair and protect it from damage; he is expected also to see to it that it is not placed at the dispo- sal of those who desire to use it in committing murder or in destroying other people's property."'14 One unresolved question as to presumptive power remains: Can we take a further step and uphold coercive conditions if they are intended merely to carry out a "policy" of Congress or of the federal govern- ment at large, but not sustainable as an implementation either of the spending or of any of the other powers of Congress? Some commenta- tors have suggested that the carrying out of such a policy would itself be sufficient,1"5 but most of their illustrations would fall without too ments for other than public purposes was a taking of property in violation of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. See Green v. Frazier, 253 U.S. 233, 238-40 (1920). No other basis for constitutional attack was readily available, since the presumptive power of the states (as distinguished from that of the federal government) was plenary. Introducing a second constitutional yardstick for federal spending does not seem helpful. If the challenged action is not within the powers granted to the federal government, then there is no need to ask whether, if it were within those powers, it would nevertheless violate the due process clause of the fifth amendment. Moreover, the due process analysis seems to fit only certain categories of cases-a denial of Social Security benefits, for example, because something that was almost a property right was taken away. The link to life, liberty, or prop- erty in most other cases appears to be fairly remote. Finally, in view of the widespread hostil- ity to substantive due process for the past half century and the hesitation with which a few recent revivals have been marked, to reactivate the doctrine in the absence of a more compel- ling need seems unwise. 112. Woods v. Cloyd W. Miller Co., 333 U.S. 138 (1948); Hamilton v. Kentucky Distil- leries &amp; Warehouse Co., 251 U.S. 146 (1919). Because these cases involved asserted viola- tions of substantive due process as well as lack of presumptive federal power, they suggest that the amelioration doctrine may serve not only to augment presumptive power but also to strengthen the argument that the action was not forbidden by limitations upon such power.

It was enacted when, under then-prevailing Supreme Court doctrine, Congress apparently could not have invoked the commerce power to regulate minimum wages in manufacturing."18 Here, however, Congress adopted more than a mere definition of who was or was not eligible to bid on a government contract: It made a conscious effort to coerce government contractors to pay prevailing wages, and thus to achieve through the spending power at least some degree of minimum-wage regulation, which was then thought to be be- yond the control of Congress under its regulatory authority.19 The constitutionality of the statute was not tested, but the question soon became moot in view of the dramatic change starting in 1937 with the Supreme Court's approach to the commerce power, culminating in 1941 with the specific upholding of federal minimum wage legislation in United States v.

See Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U.S. 448, 473-78 (1980) (Burger, CJ., White, Powell, JJ., plurality opinion). The antidiscrimination policy underlying Lau v.

Once we get past the outmoded theory that government contractors have no right to object to conditions imposed on them, Walsh-Healey seems harder to sustain than the Agricultural Adjustment Act, which the Court invalidated in Butler. In the latter, the condi- tions were germane and seemingly essential to the success of the program for which the grants were being offered, whereas minimum wages had only tenuous relevance to govern- ment procurement programs. Perhaps Walsh-Healey could have been sustained, however, on the ground that the gov- ernment has authority to prevent its own activities from doing harm. See Perkins v. Lukens Steel Co., 310 U.S. 113, 128 (1940). Government spending pursuant to competitive bidding, at prices necessitating payment at below prevailing wage rates, would have been harmful to employees, damaging to the economy, and productive ultimately of increased welfare costs. 120. 312 U.S. 100 (1941). Due process concerns as to state regulation were removed by West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U.S. 379 (March 29, 1937), and as to federal regulation by United States v.

In general, then, subject to a few such problems at the edges, the issue of presumptive power is comparatively unimportant to this arti- cle's inquiry. Since 1937, questions relating to coercive conditions have focused not on the presumptive powers of Congress, but rather on the external constraints imposed upon them, such as those arising from the Bill of Rights and other constitutional provisions and princi- ples that protect civil rights and civil liberties, as well as those safe- guarding state and local government from excessive federal intrusion. Although the Framers may not have planned it that way, we have found authority for almost every kind of federal action, under the commerce clause as well as under some of the other enumerated powers, that not much is left that is so local that Congress cannot regulate it in some fashion. If the front door of the commerce power is open, it may not be worth worrying whether to keep the back door of the spending power tightly closed. We turn, therefore, from the presumptive powers of Congress to the constitutional limitations upon them. B. Constitutional Limitations 1. The relevance of relevance. The relevance of the condition to a presumptive power of Con- gress-either the spending power as used to provide the funds to which the condition is attached, the spending power as applied in a different program, or some other independent power of Congress such as the 122. Id. at 127, 129-30. 123. There have been criticisms from time to time of executive orders imposing restric- tions upon government contractors in the interest of such policies as elimination of racial or other invidious discrimination, or wage-price stabilization. See, e.g., Exec. Order No. 11,246, 3 C.F.R. 339 (1964-1965) (nondiscrimination); Exec. Order No. 12,092, 3 C.F.R. 249 (1979), revoked by Exec. Order No. 12,288, 3 C.F.R. 125 (1982), reprinted in 12 U.S.C. ? 1904 (1982) (wage-price stabilization). With respect to the latter, see AFL-CIO v. Kahn, 618 F.2d 784 (D.C. Cir.) (en banc), cert. denied, 443 U.S. 915 (1979); Brewster, Does the Constitution Care About Coercive Federal Funding?, 34 CASE W. RES. L. REV. 1 passim (1983). Presumptive federal power seems clear enough; the commerce power would seemingly suffice and the power to enforce the fourteenth amendment might also be applicable. The principal constitutional questions would appear to concern only matters of separation of pow- ers-whether such action by the executive branch was expressly or implicitly authorized by Congress or fell within some area of inherent executive authority. May 1987] 1131</page><page sequence="30">STANFORD LA W REVIEW commerce power-appears to satisfy the initial inquiry, namely, whether the condition is authorized under the powers delegated to Congress. When we deal with constitutional limitations on the exercise of those powers, however, relevance is still necessary, but it is not nec- essarily sufficient.124 If we assume that to satisfy considerations of state autonomy or the protection of individual rights, a more stringent stan- dard, beyond that required of the presumptive power of Congress, must be met, then it follows that relevance alone is not enough. The proposition is quite clear with respect to individual rights and liberties. Thus, a requirement that beneficiaries of a federally funded welfare program use contraceptives, become sterilized, or submit to abortions, would be relevant in the sense of keeping down costs or making more funds available for each recipient; yet such conditions would clearly be held unconstitutional. Further illustrations, if any be needed, can be found by drawing upon cases involving certain condi- tions- imposed by states on their own spending-that the Supreme Court invalidated. For example, a requirement that unemployment in- surance beneficiaries be willing to accept work on any day of the week would have served the relevant purpose of limiting benefits to those genuinely seeking work, but such a requirement by a state was held unconstitutional as applied to those whose religion forbade work on Saturday.125 The Court has held unconstitutional certain residence re- quirements for welfare eligibility:'26 Although such requirements can clearly be germane to a welfare program, both as a means of keeping down expenses and of protecting the more generous states from being swamped by an influx of welfare recipients from states offering less aid, the Court found these needs insufficient to outweigh the personal inter- est in freedom of interstate movement. Although those holdings in- volved state spending, they undoubtedly would apply to analogous actions by the federal government as well. As to state autonomy, there is little case law to work with, but we can assume that the conditioning of federal funds on the total elimination of political parties in gubernatorial or legislative elections, to reduce the likelihood that federal money would be used to serve partisan pur- poses, might be relevant to the spending program but nevertheless in- 124. In early attempts to formulate standards, relevance emerged as a major determi- nant, without attention to whether the issue was one of prima facie power, loss of individual rights, or interference with state autonomy. See American Communications Ass'n v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 417 (1950) (Frankfurter,J., concurring in part); Butler, 297 U.S. at 83 (Stone,J., dissenting); Steward Machine, 301 U.S. at 590-91; Hale, supra note 10, at 357.

Similarly, the provision of federal money on the condition that the state capital be moved to a location more conveniently served by interstate highways or carriers might be relevant to the power of Con- gress over interstate commerce but nevertheless unconstitutional be- cause it is too intrusive on state autonomy.127 2. Autonomy of state and local government. Assuming that a conditional spending program is within the pre- sumptive powers of Congress, it must also satisfy another federalism- related concern-the preservation of some essential attributes of state and local governmental autonomy128 from federal encroachment. The Supreme Court has never invalidated conditional federal spending on this account. Moreover, both the Supreme Court and the lower federal courts have apparently been routinely upholding such spending in situations in which direct federal regulation would have faced serious constitutional challenge. And in the course of invalidat- ing direct regulation as interfering excessively with the governmental authority of the states, courts have gone out of their way to suggest the possibility that similar goals could be achieved constitutionally if condi- tional spending were employed instead.129 As an illustration of the Supreme Court's response to claims that conditional spending intrudes on state autonomy, we might observe the Court's treatment of the provision of the Hatch Act intended to insu- late from partisan political involvement certain federal funds distrib- uted to the states.130 In Oklahoma v. United States Civil Service Commission, 31 the federal government made loans and grants to Oklahoma for highway improvements. A member of the State Highway Commission, with the remarkable name of France Paris, was chairman of the Democratic State Central Committee.'32 Pursuant to appropri- ate provisions of the Hatch Act, the Civil Service Commission gave Oklahoma the choice of removing Paris from office or having sub- tracted from its federal grants an amount equal to two years of his sal- ary. Oklahoma left Paris in office, challenged the grant reduction, and lost. The Court stated: Oklahoma adopted the "simple expedient" of not yielding to what she 127. Cf Coyle v. Smith, 221 U.S. 559 (1911) (invalidating an attempt by Congress to order relocation of Oklahoma's capital from Guthrie to Oklahoma City). 128.

The offer of benefits to a state by the United States dependent upon cooperation by the state with federal plans, as- sumedly for the general welfare, is not unusual.133 The Court's holding was less troublesome than its reasoning, which seemed to hark back to the days before the emergence of the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions, when there was thought to be no limit on the power to condition a privilege upon surrender of an otherwise applicable constitutional right.134 The Court in this case did not suggest that it would have sustained a comparable interference, by means of direct federal regulation, with the state's selection of its officials; indeed, it seems unlikely that such an intrusion would have been upheld.'35 But because Congress has never tried such direct action, there are no cases involving challenges to it. In fact, one of the difficulties in probing how far Congress can intrude into state autonomy via conditional spending where it could not do so di- rectly is the lack of cases that could have served as a baseline, in which direct federal regulation of state government has been attempted or challenged.136 Note also that the penalty imposed upon Oklahoma was quite mod- est when compared with some of the Draconian sanctions that more recent Congresses have contrived to inflict on states that refuse to abide by the conditions imposed.'37 Oklahoma had to give up only a small fraction of its highway grant; it could have avoided even this by replacing Paris; and no other federal spending programs in Oklahoma were threatened because of the state's recalcitrance.

Nevertheless, a federal statute limiting use by states of party membership as a crite- rion for hiring or firing might be upheld as an implementation of the fourteenth amendment, since even without such a statute some patronage dismissals of public employees have been invalidated.

The search for baselines for purposes of comparison takes us quite far afield, to such esoteric cases as those involving a congressional attempt to prescribe the location of a state capital. Coyle v. Smith, 221 U.S. 559 (1911). Precedents as to intergovernmental immu- nity have tended largely to be in the tax field, where doctrines calling for protection of one level of government from interference by the taxes of the other have been cut back sharply since the mid-1930s. E.g., Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., 303 U.S. 376 (1938) (overruling Burnet v. Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co., 285 U.S. 393 (1932) (federal income tax on profits of private lessee of state lands)); Helvering v. Gerhardt, 304 U.S. 405 (1938) (in effect overruling Collector v.

And here, as in other areas, the rejoinder may be made that what appears to be consent may in fact be coercion. Consent and duress are not precise opposites, but it may be helpful in examining the genuineness of apparent consent to explore the possibility that it was the product of duress. Although the notion of duress, as imposed upon a governmental unit, is arguably an inappropriate one because it is an "anthropomorphism" that is not conducive to logical analysis,138 this objection, with due respect, is not well taken. The common law defense of duress has not been limited to natural persons. Courts have not hesitated in contracts cases to find that corporations have been subjected to duress and have given appro- priate remedies.'39 The Supreme Court has had occasion to rule on whether a state was being subjected to coercion by the federal govern- ment.'40 The United States itself claimed that in the exigencies of World War I, it was forced to pay exorbitant prices to a supplier be- cause of duress, a claim rejected by a divided Court, not on the ground that the federal government could not be subject to duress, but because of the majority's conclusion that duress was not proved in the particular case.'41 Thus, statements such as "Oklahoma adopted the 'simple ex- pedient' of not yielding to what she urges is federal coercion"'42 might not be appropriate with respect to some of the more recent examples of Congressional interference; the dependence of the state or local gov- ernment upon federal funds may have become so great as to destroy the possibility of an effective choice.143 Issues surrounding conditional grants to states involve more than questions of consent, however, and there are legitimate reasons for the receptive attitude of some courts towards conditional spending as a de- vice to achieve state compliance with federal purposes where direct reg- ulation might be invalidated. Even where the constitutionality of direct federal regulation and en- forcement might be clear-as, for example, in the imposition of a 55 mile per hour speed limit for motor vehicles-the presence of federal police on the highways might be offensive to local sensibilities and damaging to federalism-related assumptions and values. Attempts at direct compulsion of the states to do their own enforcing may give rise to even more serious objections.144 Making state adherence to and 138. Cf. Stewart, supra note 14, at 1254. 139.

"Cooperative federalism" may take various forms. If it means that Congress may co-opt state institutions and personnel to achieve en- forcement of federally mandated rules, then resentment by both state officials and the public would be likely. And, as in the case of federal efforts to require state enforcement of certain parts of the clean air leg- islation,l46 serious constitutional issues might arise. Inducing coopera- tion of the states through conditional funds may avoid political and perhaps even constitutional difficulties, provided that the consent is in- deed voluntary and not coerced by threats to withhold large sums of badly needed money. Congress' use of both sticks and carrots to persuade the states to raise the minimum drinking age to twenty-one to reduce automobile- related injuries and deaths147 probably reflects similar considerations, at least in part. The relationship between interstate commerce and ac- cident avoidance, even on local roads, would undoubtedly be suffi- ciently clear to sustain direct federal regulation of the drinking age, as far as the commerce power is concerned. But whether the "local op- tion" emanations of the twenty-first amendment, even though not its actual language, might militate against federal regulatory power is still 145.

Attempts by the federal Environmental Protection Agency to require state governments either to adopt their own transportation controls, sufficient to achieve the goals of the Clean Air Act, or to enforce EPA-drafted Transportation Control Plans, were challenged in court. Of four cases testing the EPA's regulatory authority in this regard, two construed the statute to deny the EPA that power, in order to avoid what they regarded as a difficult constitutional question, see Maryland v. EPA, 530 F.2d 215, 226-27 (4th Cir. 1975); Brown v. EPA, 521 F.2d 827, 831 (9th Cir. 1975); one held the statute applicable but partly unconstitutional, see District of Co- lumbia v. Train, 521 F.2d 971 (D.C. Cir. 1975); and one upheld the EPA's authority against both statutory and constitutional challenges, see Pennsylvania v. EPA, 500 F.2d 246 (3d Cir. 1974). The Court granted certiorari in all four cases, but the Court later vacated the grants of certiorari and remanded the cases on the basis of a suggestion of mootness, because of an apparent concession and projected change of policy by the federal government. EPA v. Brown, 431 U.S. 99 (1977) (per curiam). Interestingly, two of the three courts of appeals that ruled against the EPA specifically suggested that its objectives could be obtained through conditioning further grants of funds to state and local governments upon their acceptance of the enforcement responsibility. See Maryland v. EPA, 530 F.2d at 228; District of Columbia v. Train, 421 F.2d at 993 n.26. Of course, a threat to cut off federal funds for air quality improvement would scarcely have been credible as a device to put pressure upon the states to comply with federal air quality stan- dards. The problems of federal demands upon state governments arose because the federal government was unable or reluctant to take over the entire problem of implementation and enforcement of the Clean Air programs. Compare Steward Mach. Co. v. Davis, 301 U.S. 548 (1937) (upholding, with great difficulty, a federal-state system of unemployment compensa- tion) with Helvering v.

Thus, although conditional funding of the states may in some cir- cumstances constitute a serious threat to their autonomy, there are situ- ations in which it can offer a technique for enlisting state cooperation in the execution of a legitimate federal program with a minimum amount of abrasiveness and a minumum number of complaints that Congress is subverting our federal system. Nevertheless, conditional federal grants can still put seemingly ob- jectionable pressures on state and local governments. Some especially striking examples were collected in a 1979 article by Professor Lewis Kaden.'49 Thus, Congress conditioned Federal Urban Mass Transpor- tation Act grants on the protection of the rights of transportation labor. A federal district court upheld an administrative decision that inter- preted this to require Georgia, which had a state law that forbade pub- lic-sector collective bargaining, nevertheless to bargain with a transportation workers' union over the employment conditions of union members.'50 Similarly, the Secretary of Transportation con- strued the Highway Beautification Act to oblige states that received fed- 148. Section 2 of the twenty-first amendment reads: "The transportation or importation into any State, Territory, or possession in the United States for delivery or use thereof of intoxicating liquors, in violation of the laws thereof, is hereby prohibited." Although this appeared to relate only to the movement of liquor, the history of consideration of the amend- ment by Congress and the ratifying states was sketchy, and the first cases arising under it appeared to treat it as authorizing the states to exercise broad "home rule" powers to regu- late almost everything pertaining to alcoholic beverages. See, e.g., Ziffrin, Inc. v. Reeves, 308 U.S. 132, 139 (1939) (upholding a Kentucky statute that forbade transportation of liquor by unauthorized carriers, but also declaring by way of dictum that the state may "permit manu- facture of whiskey only on condition that it be sold to an indicated class of customers ... ."). Recent cases have sharply limited the reach of the amendment, and the principal battleground has been over the extent to which it dilutes, as to alcoholic beverages, the protection that the commerce clause accords to competition with respect to other commodities. See, e.g., Brown- Forman Distillers Corp. v. New York State Liquor Auth., 106 S. Ct. 2080, 2087 (1986); 324 Liquor Corp. v. Duffy, 107 S. Ct. 720 (1987). State power to control drinking age is not absolute under the twenty-first amendment; the equal protection clause forbids gender discrimination in that respect. Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190 (1976). But whether a federal statute may also supersede state authority has not been decided. If the Court, in South Dakota v. Dole, 791 F.2d 628 (8th Cir.), cert. granted, 107 S. Ct. 567 (1986), were to follow the Ziffrin dictum, or to hold on any other basis that the twenty-first amendment forbade direct federal regulation of the drinking age, it might have to decide some interesting questions concerning the power of Congress to threaten states with loss of federal funds if they failed to enact statutes setting 21 as the minimum drinking age. It is to be hoped that in a case with so narrow a focus, the Court will avoid expressing any sweeping generalizations as to the power, or lack of it, to regulate by spending what could not be regulated directly. 149.

Congress conditioned vocational aid to the handicapped on the states' establish- ment of new types of government agencies, even if the state constitu- tions assigned the functions elsewhere and forbade the creation of new agencies.152 Similar insistence on major changes in the organization of state government occurred with respect to conditions of eligibility for federal funding of health planning services.153 And these are just a sample. Some of these requirements can be justified as measures designed to ensure that federally sponsored programs will be handled respon- sibly and that funds provided will be properly accounted for and used as intended; many, however, have the hallmarks of Congressional or bureaucratic heavy-handedness. But those that have been tested in the federal courts have consistently survived constitutional challenge.'54 Courts have even upheld such seemingly fundamental intrusions as the conditioning of federal money upon shifts of authority between a state's governor and legislaturel55 or between the state government and those of its localities.156 One federal law that might have been expected to encounter heavy weather in the courts was a provision that a state had to extend its un- employment insurance program to state and local government employ- 151.

Not only would the refusal by a state to extend the unemploy- ment insurance program to public employees subject it to dispropor- tionately serious harm, but the intrusion into state autonomy through this extension of the unemployment insurance program imposed fiscal burdens comparable to those created by the extension of the Fair Labor Standards Act to essentially the same group of employees-held un- constitutional in National League of Cities v. Usery. 59 Yet this provision was consistently upheld when challenged in court even while National League of Cities was still good law.'60 Although National League of Cities involved direct federal regulation of state and local government (the extension of the applicability of Fair Labor Standards Act to cover their employees), as did the case that sub- sequently overruled it, Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Author- ity,161 they are pertinent to our problem in several ways. First, National League of Cities had offered at least one criterion for invalidating direct regulation that might have been useful for compari- son with similar types of conditional spending-the likelihood of sub- stantial interference with "integral," "essential," or "traditional" governmental functions.162 Since its overruling, finding appropriate situations for matching judicial attitudes to direct regulation against those relating to conditional spending has become even more difficult. 163 157.

Prognostication, even with respect to the degree to which direct federal regulatory instrusion into state and local government will be permitted by the Court in the future, must necessarily be cautious. While National League of Cities was being overruled in Garcia, four dissenters expressed both hope and prediction that it would rise again from its ashes (in opin- ions written, appropriately, by two justices from Phoenix).

Conditional spending is a step still fur- ther removed, and even when the supporters of National League of Cities were riding high, cave- ats and suggestions by the judiciary and brave leaps by academics strongly suggested that what Congress was barred from doing via regulation it could validly accomplish through con- ditional spending. See, e.g., L. TRIBE, AMERICAN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 18 (Supp. 1979). But cf. Stewart, supra note 14. If so, why the brouhaha about National League of Cities or about its overruling? Was very much really at stake? 1139 May 1987]</page><page sequence="38">STANFORD LA W REVIEW Second, National League of Cities also contained a caveat that the Court was not passing on whether minimum wage and maximum hour controls could be imposed on state or local government through exer- cise of several other powers of Congress, including specifically the spending powerl64-reinforcing the belief that the Court was likely to be more permissive as to conditional spending.'65 Moreover, while Na- tional League of Cities was still good law, a flurry of cases in the lower federal courts nevertheless upheld various types of interference with state autonomy through the spending power.'66 Many of these inter- ferences appeared to be at least as disruptive as the application of the Fair Labor Standards Act to the states, which had been declared uncon- stitutional when imposed directly in National League of Cities. Not only did the Supreme Court decline to review several such cases, but it also affirmed one such holding, per curiam,167 thus affording additional support for the conclusion that, at least where the constraint was that of state autonomy, conditional federal spending was almost immune from judicial scrutiny. Finally, the Court in Garcia concluded that the states had sufficient political influence over the workings of the national government to be able to safeguard their own interests from federal intrusion without needing to call upon the judiciary to provide them with protection.168 The majority relied in particular upon the analysis contained in a semi- nal article by Professor Herbert Wechsler.169 Professor Wechsler had made an overwhelmingly persuasive case in 1954 to show how our constitutional and political structures gave the states so many cards with which to trump any attempts by the federal government to intrude into their domains that judicial intervention for that purpose would seldom be necessary. More recently, however, questions have been raised as to the extent to which the political struc- ture has changed, in the years since he wrote, to reduce the influence of state and local governments, office holders, parties, and political ma- 164.

Tribe finds further evidence for the view that neither individuals nor governments can generally complain about restrictions tied to money they accept, in the Court's approval in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 57 n.65 (1976), of a statutory provision that granted public financing to candidates for public office on condition that they abide by otherwise unconstitu- tional limits on their spending.

Certainly, the actions of the courts and the comments of some scholars have consistently assumed that where direct regulation is valid, the constitutionality of similar interference with the states through con- ditional funding will be upheld afortiori. A strong argument may be made, however, that the distinction should run in the opposite direc- tion. Whether or not there is enough political influence at the state and local government level to prevent the more intrusive direct threats to the autonomy of those governments, the same process may not work effectively to forestall similar interference through coercive conditions. A continued high level of federal financial assistance will often be of great importance to state and local governments and a focus of sub- stantial lobbying activities on their part; these governments may not find it politically expedient to dilute their efforts to obtain such funds by simultaneously campaigning against the conditions, however objec- tionable they may appear to be.171 The Court has never asserted that there are no state-autonomy re- strictions on the power of Congress to regulate through conditional spending. To the contrary, the Court has repeatedly stated that such congressional power is not unlimited,'72 but in every case in which it has passed on the question, it has held that the limits had not been exceeded. Recognition that there are such limits may also be reflected in a cau- tious approach to the construction of statutes that allegedly impose 170. Cf. Kaden, supra note 14, at 860-68.

Garcia, 469 U.S. at 565 n.9 (Powell, J., dissenting). 171. The late Professor Robert Cover made a somewhat similar point, but with refer- ence to the narrower subject of federal-state cooperative programs. See text accompanying note 146 supra. In an interesting and thought-provoking analysis, he asserted that, as to these programs, federal spending was much more suspect constitutionally than was federal regula- tion, because federal spending co-opts local politicians by increasing the patronage available to them, thus debilitating the alternative sources of power in our federal structure. See Cover, Federalism and Administrative Structure, 92 YALE LJ. 1342 (1983). Cover's conclusion was chal- lenged as a matter of political and economic theory. See Rose-Ackerman, Cooperative Federalism and Co-optation, 92 YALE LJ. 1344 (1983). Cover also postulated that, at least for a year, starting with Butler, the Supreme Court had evinced an intention to impose "more stringent constraints on the exercise of the spending power than upon other national powers." Cover, supra, at 1343. But note that the Court decided Butler at the height of an era of broadside invalidation of attempts by Congress to exercise its other powers, especially the commerce power, for economic regulation and social reform. See, e.g., Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U.S. 238 (1936); United States v. Schechter Poultry Co., 295 U.S. 495 (1935); Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Alton R.R., 295 U.S. 30 (1935). The Court's retreat as to the spending power (in Steward Machine and Helvering) followed on the heels of a similar dramatic shift in doctrine under the commerce power. See, e.g, NLRB v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U.S. 1 (1937). 172. See, e.g., Pennhurst State School &amp; Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 n. 13 (1981); Lau v.

In acknowledging the potentially abrasive effect of such conditions, the Court has suggested that the arrangement be regarded as "much in the nature of a contract: in return for federal funds, the States agree to comply with federally- imposed conditions."173 The Court has stated that, as a matter of in- terpretation, such a contract will not be found unless Congress has spo- ken unambiguously, and with an especially strong presumption against such a finding when the requirement assertedly imposed on the states obliges them to expend some of their own money.174 Nevertheless, it is in the area of state autonomy that we encounter the strongest judicial expressions of the view that Congress may regu- late by means of spending what it may not control directly. Yet we also have a recent explicit assertion by the Court of the strength of the "political safeguards" analysis as justification for upholding direct fed- eral regulation. But nowhere has there been adequate recognition of the tension between these propositions, arising from the possibility that the political safeguards may be less, rather than more, effective in the case of conditional grants than where direct regulation is proposed. More empirical data on the political influence and lobbying capabili- ties of state and local governments at the national level would be wel- come. The possibility of differences in their influence, depending on whether the subject is conditional spending or direct regulation, should especially be explored. Such studies would probably be helpful to the courts if they are willing to reexamine the approaches they have been taking in this area. 3. Individual rights and liberties. As has been noted,175 the power to spend, like other powers of the federal government, is subject to limitations found elsewhere in the Constitution, such as in the Bill of Rights. We know that in certain circumstances it would be invalid for Congress, by means of direct reg- ulation, to infringe freedom of speech under the first amendment or the privilege against self-incrimination under the fifth. But where the effect on constitutionally protected rights is only indirect, flowing from acceptance of government funds conditioned upon some relinquish- ment of those rights, what tests are appropriate to determine validity? 173. Pennhurst State School &amp; Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17-18 (1981). 174. When such a contract is found, the Court seems to have no difficulty in enforcing it rigorously. See NewJersey v. Bell, 461 U.S. 773 (1982). Note, however, the great reluctance of the majority of the Court to construe a federal statute granting funds to state governments as intended to abrogate the eleventh amendment protection of the state against being sued by private parties in federal court for violations of the federal statutory or administrative regula- tions relating to the spending program, or to construe the state's acceptance of the federal funds as a waiver of its eleventh amendment immunity. See Atascadero State Hosp. v. Scan- lon, 105 S. Ct. 3142, 3147-50 (1985). 175. See text following note 123 supra. 1142 [Vol. 39:1103</page><page sequence="41">CONDITIONAL SPENDING As pointed out above,176 something more than mere relevance to a power of Congress is required. After all, barring the New York Times from interstate transport would be just as relevant to the commerce power as barring lottery tickets. But whether the standard for condi- tional spending is necessarily the same as would be applied in the case of comparable exercise of direct regulatory power is unclear. Must the balance be the same, in determining when a compelling governmental interest has to be shown, whether the restriction is directly regulatory or whether it is a condition on spending?177 To what extent should the same tests that measure in varying degrees the validity of direct federal regulation be applied to indirect regulation through conditional spend- ing? How much weight should be given to whether there is a "compel- ling governmental interest," or the unavailability of less drastic means, or the insufficiency of the political process as a remedy, or any of the other formulations often employed by the Court as standards for the validity of certain types of governmental regulation deemed to require "strict scrutiny" or otherwise regarded as curtailing rights that merit special protection? Some additional questions seem even more pertinent to our prob- lem. What effect, if any, should be accorded the consent of the recipi- ent? Even where a waiver of some rights of the recipient of federal funds might be upheld, would it follow that the rights of third persons could be traded away?178 Should the confusion over the significance of legislative motive, which has bedeviled the Court in a variety of other contexts, be carried over to conditional spending as well?179 If so, is the decisive motive that for the basic spending program or for the con- dition? Should it matter whether they are embodied in the same piece of legislation or enacted independently of each other? Before dealing directly with the power of Congress to restrict indi- vidual liberties by means of conditional grants where it would be for- bidden to do so through direct regulation, consider other possible criteria. As mentioned above,180 the prevailing approach for a long time was that there were no limits on the conditions that could be im- posed in exchange for the award of a privilege (including, inter alia, grants of money and contracts for goverment employment or procure- ment). The doctrine of unconstitutional conditions sometimes pre- vailed over this analysis, but only sometimes. How much of it survives with respect to conditional federal funding? Does the old notion that if 176. See text accompanying notes 124-127 supra. 177. In Federal Communications Commission v. League of Women Voters, 468 U.S. 364 (1984), the majority appeared to treat the challenged condition on federal grants pre- cisely as though it had been a direct regulation; Justice Rehnquist's dissent placed substantial weight, in contending that the restriction was valid, on the fact that conditional spending was used.

Should it? As will be seen, with respect to individual rights, over the past half century the Court has generally employed in conditional spending cases techniques similar to those it uses when weighing the constitu- tionality of direct regulation-an attempt to balance competing inter- ests. This is not tantamount to saying that the results arrived at would be the same as if a similar direct regulation were being challenged- indeed, in many cases there can be no appropriate baseline of direct regulation against which to measure the condition-but the avoidance of all-or-nothing formulas is itself a large step forward. Recall that in Oklahoma v. United States Civil Service Commission,'81 the Supreme Court upheld a provision of the Hatch Act that forbade states from entrusting administration of programs supported by federal grants (e.g., for highway improvement) to partisan political workers.182 On the same day, in United Public Workers v. Mitchell,'83 the Court also upheld another section of the Hatch Act, similarly aimed at the reality or appearance of intrusion of party politics into the performance of governmental functions. This provision forbade certain types of polit- ical activities by federal government employees, including the taking of "any active part in political management or in political campaigns."184 The sanction was dismissal from employment. Mitchell did not involve a federalism issue, but it directly implicated the question of the first amendment rights of civil servants. Although refusing, because of in- sufficient "ripeness," to pass upon the allegations of a number of fed- eral employees who were merely planning political activity and were apprehensive about losing their jobs, the Court reached the merits in the case of one Poole, who was a "roller" in the United States Mint and had been a politically active Election Day worker. On the merits of Poole's case, the Court conceded that the first amendment's protection of those political rights that Poole would otherwise have enjoyed had been curtailed because of his federal employment, but upheld the re- striction on the basis of the congressional judgment that it would con- tribute to orderly management and the efficiency of the civil service. The Court later reaffirmed this decision in United States Civil Service Com- mission v. National Association of Letter Carriers. 85 Significantly, the Court in Mitchell did not employ the same rhetoric as it did in Oklahoma; it did not suggest the "simple expedient of not 181. 330 U.S. 127 (1947). 182. Although the provision might have been questioned on the ground of interference with constitutionally protected political rights of state officials, the attack and the Court's re- sponse were limited to the question of undue intrusion into state autonomy. 183. 330 U.S. 75 (1947). 184.

The issue in Mitchell could undoubtedly have been posed in terms of whether, in accepting or remaining in their government jobs and receiving their salaries, the federal employees had consented to the imposition of the Hatch Act restrictions upon their political activities, and whether such consent should be given effect. Alternatively, the "right-privilege" di- chotomy could have been dusted off,187 or the case analyzed on the basis of whether employment on such terms properly invoked the doc- trine of unconstitutional conditions. The Mitchell majority said none of these things. Whether or not one agrees with the Court that Congress could reasonably conclude that the contribution of such regulations to an effective public service outweighed the political rights of the affected employees, balancing of this kind offers a more helpful approach to the problem than the older types of analysis. 88 The Court may be carrying the balancing approach into other areas that involve individual rights and liberties. We take for granted, for example, that it is proper to withhold some, but not all, of the constitu- tional rights of civilians from members of the armed services. This re- sult could be explained on the ground that the history of such restrictions both in England and in pre- and post-independence America necessarily should be read into the Constitution.'89 In any event, no one has seriously suggested that, perhaps because of their voluntary acceptance of "the Queen's shilling," military personnel have consented to the imposition of such restrictions. Basically, in this area, as in that of civilian government employment, the most appropriate analysis would seem to be based on a weighing of public needs against 186. See note 82 supra. 187. Cf. Heim v. McCall, 239 U.S. 175 (1915) (power of a state to discriminate against aliens and out-of-staters in employment both by the state and by its contractors). But cf. Pow- ell, supra note 10 (criticizing Heim v. McCall, supra). 188. In Federal Communications Commission v. League of Women Voters, 468 U.S. 364 (1984), there was an interesting disagreement between Justice Brennan, in his majority opinion , id. at 401 n.27, andJustice Rehnquist, in his dissent, id. at 406, on the interpretation of United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75 (1947), and Oklahoma v. United States Civil Service Commission, 330 U.S. 127 (1947). Although not stated in precisely those terms, the issue between them might well be expressed as whether the cases were authority for the prop- osition that Congress could control through conditional grants matters as to which direct regulation would be invalid. Recently, the Supreme Court has seemingly come down strongly against the notion that because public employment can be denied altogether, it can be conditioned upon relinquish- ment of a constitutional right. See Pickering v. Board of Educ., 391 U.S. 563 (1968). Compare Adler v. Board of Educ., 342 U.S. 485 (1952) (Court upheld constitutionality of Feinberg Law, which made members of organizations advocating the overthrow of the government by force ineligible for public school employment) with Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589 (1967) (Court found Feinberg Law unconstitutionally vague). The Court has also made clear, however, that it does not regard this as necessarily implying complete invalidity of restrictions upon the speech of public employees as such, imposed for the efficiency of the public service. See Pickering, 391 U.S. at 569-70; Connick v. Meyers, 461 U.S. 138 (1983). 189.

In Snepp v. United States,'19 the Court upheld, and rigorously enforced, restrictions that a CIA employee had accepted as part of his contract of employment, for- bidding him to publish, without prior permission, information learned in the course of his duties even though it included no classified mate- rial.'92 His book made grave charges concerning the conduct of the CIA in Vietnam and the manner in which the United States withdrew from that country'93-allegations of substantial public importance and interest, as to which first amendment protections would seem to be par- ticularly pertinent.194 Although the Court's per curiam opinion relied in part on the government's contention that the effective functioning of an intelligence agency required the imposition of such restraints,195 it leaned more heavily upon the employment contract, especially in the fashioning of a remedy (a constructive trust in favor of the government upon all royalties derived by the author from his book).196 To the extent that the Court's opinion can be read as holding that the contract was to be enforced without independent consideration of the reasonableness of the restraints it imposed, the government was allowed to create, through an employment contract, a limitation upon 190. Although the Court generally seems to accept the military's appraisal of its need to restrict the rights of service personnel to freedom of speech, it has been deciding such cases through balancing of interests rather than on the premise of consent to curtailment of rights based on entry into the armed services. See, e.g., Brown v. Clines, 444 U.S. 348 (1980). In the recent case of Goldman v. Weinberger, 106 S. Ct. 1310 (1986), the Court upheld a military regulation forbidding an OrthodoxJew from wearing a yarmulke while on duty. FourJustices dissented, some on the basis of the military's failure to justify the need for the rule and others on the basis of the majority's failure to weigh military convenience against the free exercise of religion. See id. at 1316, 1322, 1324. 191. 444 U.S. 507 (1980) (per curiam). 192. This is not to say that the mere fact of classification by the government is necessar- ily dispositive, much less that it is sufficient to justify a prior restraint on publication. See New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713 (1971); Orentlicher, supra note 11, at 700-06; cf. United States v. Marchetti, 466 F.2d 1309, 1317-18 (4th Cir.)

Although the Supreme Court's opinions barely discussed the contents of the book, the court of appeals had characterized it as "a highly critical account of the United States' withdrawal from Vietnam at the close of the war" and stated that: it also contains allegations that the CIA's intelligence reporting from Vietnam was fabricated and distorted, that the CIA manipulated press reporting from Vietnam by providing false information to reporters, that CIA officials in Vietnam engaged in corrupt practices, and that the CIA mishandled the evacuation from Vietnam by fail- ing to evacuate its indigenous agents and employees. 595 F.2d 926, 931 (4th Cir. 1979), rev'd in part, 444 U.S. 507 (1980) (per curiam). 194.

Although the Court has not recently asserted that government employment implies a surrender of first amendment rights, or that acceptance of or continuation in a govern- ment job could be regarded as implied consent to the imposition of such restriction, Snepp may prove to be authority for the proposition that substantial dilution of constitutional rights can be obtained through the device of securing express consent, either through a writ- ten employment contract or perhaps through adoption of a regulation declaring that new or even continuing employees would be deemed to have entered into such a contract.197 Nevertheless, we are probably not about to see a revival of the dis- credited view that there are no limits to the restriction of constitutional rights that may be imposed in return for the privilege of government employment. But even though the shift to a balancing approach is a distinct advance, we can still question whether the balances reached in recent cases have not given too much weight to alleged governmental needs, and whether the ghost of the old ideas still does not continue to haunt us through the government's imposition of, and the Court's heavy reliance upon, employment contracts that withdraw significant constitutional rights.'98 Thus, there is still some life to the view that government as an em- ployer is more like a private employer, with power to impose arbitrary rules on its employees, than like a government, which is subject to con- stitutional restraints and is supposed to adhere to standards of reasona- bleness.199 Indeed, since private employers are subject to a substantial 197. More recently, the Executive Branch proposed National Security Decision Directive 84, which would have required a large number of employees with possible access to sensitive material to sign prepublication clearance agreements.

Opposition arose in both Congress and the press, and the Directive has not been put into effect. 198. It may be hoped that any future cases of this sort will not be disposed of in per curiam opinions, without briefs on the merits or oral argument, and that the Court will give careful consideration to the reasonableness of any contractual or other constraints on federal employees that would diminish their otherwise available constitutional rights. The restric- tions in Snepp, for example, seemingly constituted a kind of prior restraint on publication of information of substantial public importance. There is a strong argument to be made for careful control of dissemination of information learned by intelligence officers in the course of their duties, just as there are legitimate arguments for prohibiting civil servants from en- gaging in party politics or for restricting certain conduct by military personnel in the interest of discipline. But these problems ought to be faced directly and decided on the merits, after a careful balancing of considerations on all sides-not disposed of summarily on the basis of a contract. 199. See Developments in the Law-Public Employment, supra note 11, at 1783-88. The relevant measure of the constitutionality of government action is not the anal- ogy of public management and private management. It is the comparison of govern- mental decisions in a public operation with governmental regulation of the analagous operation in private hands. The relevant question is not whether the com- plainant-be he an employee, a contractor, a student, an insurance beneficiary- 1147 May 1987]</page><page sequence="46">STANFORD LA W REVIEW [Vol. 39:1103 amount of regulation by all levels of government, much of it in the in- terest of protecting their employees, a corollary would be that the gov- ernment as employer would have all of the freedom to be arbitrary that is accorded to private employers, plus the power to exempt itself from the statutory regulations it imposes upon them. This approach has apparently been discarded as applied to classify- ing conditions. Government may not engage in racial or other kinds of invidious discrimination in employment, for example, although private employers are constrained in that respect only by statute, not by the Constitution. But as to coercive conditions, Snepp indicates that much is still in doubt.200 Similarly, with respect to government procurement contracts, we used to find ready acceptance of the premise that nobody had a right to contract with or sell to the government-thus supporting the conclu- sion that procurement contracts could be on any terms prescribed by the government. Perkins v. Lukens Steel Co.,201 referred to above, is a good example. Although there has not been as clear-cut a shift in the Supreme Court's approach to procurement contracts as there has been in its treatment of government employment, the old syllogism probably could make his claim against the action of the public managers if they were in private. It is whether he could object if that action had been imposed upon comparable pri- vate managers by governmental decision. Linde, supra note 143, at 76. Professor (now Judge) Easterbrook took an entirely different approach in his discussion of Snepp in Insider Trading, Secret Agents, Evidentiary Privileges, and the Production of Information, 1981 SUP. CT. REV. 309, 339-53. He appeared to give no weight to the differences between the responsibilities of government and those of private employers, and treated the CIA agent simply as one who, in return for his silence, had bargained in the marketplace for a higher- paying job than he could have found in the private sector. This is followed by a broadside endorsement of the right to buy and sell constitutional rights and even of the notion that supporters of such rights should welcome their alienability because that increases their value: If people can obtain benefits from selling their rights, why should they be prevented from doing so? One aspect of the value of a right-whether a constitutional right or title to land-is that it can be sold and both parties to the bargain made better off. A right that cannot be sold is worth less than an otherwise-identical right that may be sold. Those who believe in the value of constitutional rights should endorse their exercise by sale as well as their exercise by other action. Id. at 347 (footnotes omitted). Does this mean that we all should have the right to sell our- selves into slavery, since that would tend to raise the market price of freedom?

The distinction between secrets of government and those of the private sector may pull in both directions. On the one hand, there is greater danger of serious harm to the nation from the revelation of some government secrets. Yet there is greater public need to know what the government is doing, and a strong interest in protecting "whistle blowers" like Snepp. See Blasi, supra note 194. 201. 310 U.S. 113 (1940); see text accompanying notes 121-123 supra. 1148</page><page sequence="47">CONDITIONAL SPENDING no longer commands support. None of the opinions in Fullilove v. Klutznick 202 hint that either the recipients or the terms of government contracts or grants may be determined arbitrarily. This implicit rejec- tion of the Lukens Steel premise strongly suggests that in the area of government contracts as well, the Court has moved to consideration of conditions on the merits rather than through application of the discred- ited view that the government has the right to be arbitrary. Turning to education, we find a history of a wide range of restric- tions, tied to federal funding, on academic institutions-some seem- ingly infringing on rights of the institutions themselves and some affecting their students or faculty members derivatively. Most of these were short-lived, however, and while they generated expressions of outrage from academic leaders,203 they seem not to have induced much litigation, especially in the higher courts. Congress has denied capitation grants to medical schools and aid to their students if the schools refused to transfer in, with advanced stand- ing, certain American students who had taken their first two years of medical training abroad.204 Equal employment opportunity has been policed by what have been regarded as onerous record-keeping re- quirements and intrusions into the confidentiality of academic decision- making.205 Campus wrongdoers have been barred from federal financial aid.206 These are just a sampling of a large number of similar restrictions. Some were tied to specific appropriation acts and lapsed after a year or so,207 and in some other instances the academic commu- nity persuaded Congress to change the laws.

Punishment for past violation of the duty to register is not coercive; students had no constitutional right to disobey the registration law. But pressure upon nonregistrants to register late in order to qualify for government money gives rise to another problem-financial coercion on a student to waive his fifth amendment right not to incriminate himself by re- vealing his earlier failure to register.211 But Congress could arguably have enacted, constitutionally, a second criminal statute that imposed additional punishment upon those whose failure to register continued beyond a certain date, thereby making the disqualification for student financial aid a counterpart of the additional criminal liability. 208.

This provision was one of several relied upon by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in finding that there was a congressional policy favoring unimpeded military recruitment that preempted a municipal ordinance forbidding universities from making their placement services available to employ- ers who discriminated on the basis of sexual preference. See United States v. City of Philadel- phia, 798 F.2d 81 (3d Cir. 1986). Although the legislation may originally have been prompted, at least in part, by campus hostility to military recruitment generally, its most serious present effects seem to result from the clash between military policy against recruiting homosexuals and university rules forbid- ding use of their placement services by employers who discriminate against homosexuals. The issue seems to have arisen most frequently in connection with recruiting at law schools by the Army Judge Advocate General's Department. The Philadelphia case, however, did not directly involve an actual or proposed cutoff of government contracts, and the one university (Temple) that was a party in the case joined the military authorities in attacking the validity of the ordinance. The issue of the validity of the termination of university eligibility for defense contracts did not arise squarely and was not discussed by the court. If we assume, however, that the government has the right to require that if an institution elects to provide placement services it may not discriminate against the military in permitting their use, then it follows that the government may employ direct sanc- tions against those which so discriminate or remove their eligibility for government contracts or grants.

In Wyman v. James,212 the Court upheld the state's right to discontinue AFDC assistance to a recipient who had refused to allow home visits by a caseworker. This ruling could be regarded as allowing a category of welfare recipients to forfeit the right to be free from un- reasonable searches and seizures. The Court's opinion, however, avoids any assertion that acceptance of financial support gave rise to a waiver of the right to object to a warrantless entry. Rather, the Court's holding is based on the premise that home visitation in this context is not a search in the traditional criminal law context of the fourth amendment.213 Although criminalization of abortion in most circumstances is inva- lid, the Court's upholding of both state and federal restrictions on pub- lic funding for abortions is not necessarily a clear-cut example of sustaining coercive conditions where direct prohibition would be inva- lid. In both Maher v. Roe214 and Harris v. McRae,215 majorities upheld such legislation in part on the premise that the challenged conditions merely selected the classes of medical care that governmental authori- ties could permissibly choose to fund, and rejected equal protection arguments based on either poverty or preference for childbirth over abortion.216 The dissenters in each case advanced both equal protec- tion arguments but also stressed the coercive nature of the refusals to fund abortions, suggesting that both the purpose and the effect of the limitation would be to put pressure on many pregnant women to carry their fetuses to term rather than to have abortions.217 The majorities' rejoinder was that the government's refusal to fund the exercise even of constitutionally protected rights does not necessarily violate the Con- stitution-they analogized it to the lack of obligation to give financial support to private schools even though their existence is constitution- ally protected.218 The extent to which the funding of medical expenses for childbirth but not for abortion should be analyzed as a coercive 212. 400 U.S. 309 (1971). 213.

In those areas, the courts appear to have accepted Congress' power to regulate activities through conditional spending where Congress could not have done so directly. Should the same descriptive or normative conclusion be reached if the conditions infringe on civil liberties? Despite the case law, or lack of it,221 I propose an almost diametri- cally opposite conclusion-a presumption that conditions on federal spending may not be used to coerce conduct that would otherwise be protected by constitutional guarantees of civil liberties.222 If the exercise of certain rights is protected by the constitution from interference by direct regulation, a comparable interference by coercive conditional spending should be afforded similar protection. An excep- tion should be allowed where there is something sufficiently different about the relationship of the restriction to government spending to jus- tify drawing a distinction. Spending can be different from regulation, and different results may follow.223 But where the regulation and the condition intrude equally into constitutionally protected conduct, one who contends that the two cases should be treated differently should have the burden of showing why.224 birth-an "affirmative duty [of Congress] to minimize the conflict between the rights of women and fetuses ...."

Although there has apparently been only one Supreme Court case invalidating fed- eral conditional spending, there are many decisions as to state laws that are closely on point, some of which have been referred to elsewhere in this article, not to mention analogous precedents involving other aspects of unconstitutional conditions. It is not, therefore, as though we were writing upon an almost clean slate. 222. This presumption assumes the limitation on my definition of coercive conditions, see text accompanying notes 52-54 supra. The performance contemplated as part of an em- ployment agreement, the undertaking of an educational program or a research project, or the supplying of products purchased by the government, may all involve some curtailment of the freedom to remain idle or to use one's time or resources for other purposes; these limitations are not coercive, however, in the ordinary sense of the term, and they do not give rise to the problems of the use of the spending power for regulatory purposes to which this article is addressed. 223.

[Vol. 39:1103 1152</page><page sequence="51">CONDITIONAL SPENDING If there is or should be such a presumption, to what situations does it apply, and when it does apply, how may it be overcome? One limitation is inherent in the very question we are addressing. In many of the cases discussed above in which we analyzed the Court's treatment of conditional spending, there was no baseline of direct gov- ernment regulation with which to compare the results. United Public Workers v. Mitchell,225 for example, involved the question of whether the government could condition continued eligibility for certain categories of civil service employment on the employees' refraining from specified types of partisan political activity.226 The Court accepted the congres- sional judgment that balanced the loss of some aspects of political free- dom against the importance of creating a nonpartisan civil service. But the key element was the individual's employment relationship with the government; in its absence the question of the validity of comparable restrictions on government employees by direct regulation could not arise. By the same token, we have no parallel to the condition to wel- fare eligibility for AFDC benefits that recipients permit warrantless home visits by case-workers, because the hypothetical case of direct regulations requiring visits to AFDC families could not exist if there were no AFDC program. Let us assume, however, a genuine match-up between a restraint on conduct under threat of loss of government funds and reasonable cer- tainty that such a restraint could not be imposed directly: What circum- stances might appropriately rebut the presumption that the conditional grant is also invalid? We have mentioned consent by the recipient as a possible basis for upholding conditional spending. But a broad spectrum of situations might be regarded as "consent," yet differ greatly one from another. One variable is the amount of genuine choice afforded to the recipient. A homeless or underfed family has little choice but to accept welfare. A student unable to begin or continue education at the institution of his or her choice is not in a life-threatening situation, but if no comparable alternative educational opportunity is available without the federal funding, the consent can scarcely be regarded as unpressured. The principal or sole source of opportunities for employment, advance- ment, and fulfillment for some careers is in the federal government or in projects funded by federal grants; other careers may lead more read- ily to the private sector. Consent to conditions attached to the govern- ment jobs or funds in the former case is far less meaningful than in the latter. On the one hand, abstract doctrines ought not deny willing and ea- ger candidates the opportunity to receive valuable federal benefits.227 225. 330 U.S. 75 (1947). 226. Id. at 98-101. 227. See Kreimer, supra note 10, at 1352. Kreimer stresses that whatever guidelines 1153 May 1987]</page><page sequence="52">STANFORD LA W REVIEW On the other, some Faustian bargains ought not be upheld. But this is not the place to attempt to catalogue those rights regarded as "unalien- able" in the Declaration of Independence (beyond the general enumer- ation of "Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness").228 Some additional elements, nonetheless, should go into any attempt at balanc- ing, beyond those that have already been discussed. When we consider asserted deprivations of basic liberties, our atten- tion is generally concentrated on those whose liberties are claimed to be curtailed, not on the collateral effects on society as a whole. May there be more involved, however, than merely the rights of the recipi- ents of the government money, which in some circumstances they should be allowed to waive? Assuming a genuine desire to waive basic liberties, with little or no pressure to do so, are there nevertheless cir- cumstances in which it would run contrary to the public interest to per- mit them to be given up? Perhaps the political process is strengthened rather than impoverished by denying civil servants the right to partici- pate actively in party politics. But would the same be true if Congress prohibited every federal employee from expressing his or her opinions publicly on any issue whatever that related to government policy? Was there not a public interest in learning what Snepp observed in the events surrounding the evacuation of Saigon, in addition to whatever right Snepp might have had to communicate it? Moreover, in some situations, one party's consent may threaten the rights of another. May a school accept public funds offered on condi- tion that its students attend or not attend church services? By ac- cepting conditioned money from the federal government, could a state yield some of the rights of its citizens, or a family planning center the privacy of young people whom it assists, or a hospital the right of pa- tients or their families to make their own decisions as to whether to prolong life?229 In short, apart from the question of the genuineness of the consent of the recipient, in some situations important reasons may preclude the honoring of consent no matter how freely given. Also seemingly relevant are the procedures employed in determin- ing whether a condition has been complied with or whether the govern- ment money should be terminated. As long as the prevailing approach was that the power of government to grant or deny a privilege was un- restrained, a plausible corollary was that recipients had no right to due emerge should not forbid "liberty-expanding offers," as distinguished from "liberty-reducing threats." To resolve the difficulty of separating these two categories, Kreimer suggests three baselines with which to compare a challenged program: history, equality, and prediction. Id. at 1359-74.

Subjecting government funds to the condition that they may be arbitrarily refused, curtailed, or termi- nated raises a serious problem.230 Finally, the appropriateness of the deprivation, weighed against the spending program itself and against the severity of other sanctions for illegal conduct, is important. A cutoff of government funding would generally seem far less severe than criminal prosecution. Yet, loss of welfare benefits or educational support may be more devastating than the imposition of a small fine. The type of sanction employed may also be decisive. A state may impose a poll tax, but the penalty for not pay- ing may not be loss of the right to vote.231 My concern over abuses in the tying of coercive strings to federal money should not be misunderstood; in most instances, such condi- tions are sensible, indeed often essential, and clearly merit being up- held if challenged. Threatened withdrawal of federal funds to coerce adherence to federal regulations may in many circumstances be the most effective means for enforcement.232 Wholesale invalidation would destroy much that should be preserved. It should be remembered that a major item in President Franklin Roosevelt's bill of particulars against the Supreme Court, set forth in a radio speech at- tempting to justify his Court-packing plan, was the decision in United States v. Butler.233 I believe that the limitation of the presumption to coercive condi- tions and only to those comparable to direct regulation that would be invalid, along with the suggestion of circumstances in which the pre- sumption would be rebutted, afford adequate basis for upholding those conditions that expand, or at least do not seriously threaten, individual liberties while invalidating those that are as destructive as direct regula- 230.

This process may shed some light on whether the standard can help decide when coercive conditions involving civil liberties should or should not be upheld; it may also serve to allay concern that the presumption would invalidate some worthwhile conditions that common sense, precedent, or both, suggest should be permitted. Medical school financial aid. We may start with one of the leading characters in the paired scenarios near the beginning of this article- the medical student who receives government financial aid in exchange for the promise to practice medicine for a specified period in an under- served geographical area or type of practice.235 Recall that in defining coercive conditions, I excluded instances in which the so-called condi- tions were merely the quid pro quo for the government money236-the prototype being the acceptance of government employment, which in theory might be regarded as renunciation of a constitutional right to remain idle but is not in any real sense coercive. The government's subsidization of our medical student might similarly be regarded as supplemental pay for subsequent professional practice in areas chosen by the government. In a slightly different arrangement (one followed more frequently in federal legislation),237 federal financial assistance is in the form of a forgivable (or assumed, if from a different creditor) loan if the former student practices where the government designates; this can still readily be characterized as an exchange of money for serv- ices. The program should be upheld; the test suggested herein would sustain it.

O'Neil proposes an extremely helpful "sug- gested framework for testing conditional benefits": A. Could the object of the condition be achieved directly? B. How relevant is the condition to the benefit? C. What alternative means, if any, would achieve the same end? D. How important is the benefit to the individual recipient? E. Are equivalent benefits available in the private sector? F. How does the condition influence the beneficiary's judgment? G. In what form is the condition imposed? H. What procedures are provided for determining a breach of the condition? O'Neil's analysis is not necessarily inconsistent with the approach suggested herein; his first item corresponds with the proposed presumption and the others would invoke factors that would tend to reinforce or overcome the presumption.

From time to time, federal and state officials propose that welfare funds be denied to able-bodied recipients for whom appro- priate work is found but who refuse to perform it (sometimes referred to as "workfare"). To describe such a regulation as the conditioning of government money upon the performance of compulsory labor would be grossly unfair; other characterizations are fairer and more realistic. One such characterization would be to regard welfare as support for those unable to find or to perform work; thus a recipient's refusal to perform available and appropriate work would be a simple failure to meet the test of welfare eligibility-a classifying rather than a coercive condition. An analogy would be to the refusal of an unemployment insurance beneficiary to seek or accept an available and appropriate job. One could also regard the welfare benefits as payment for the work performed; that others may receive the same benefits without hav- ing to work, if nothing that they can do is available for them, would merely be a reflection of a government decision to provide a "safety net" for those unable to support themselves or their families. Finally, "workfare" can be justified as a means by which the unemployed may gain experience and skills that may facilitate their entry or re-entry into the mainstream of the employment market. Suppose, however, that Congress imposed, as a condition to contin- ued eligibility for welfare, that a Seventh Day Adventist recipient not reject an offer of employment that included Saturday work. A direct regulation by Congress requiring Saturday work of such a person would violate the free exercise clause. The Court has held that the im- position by a state of such a condition for unemployment benefits would be unconstitutional239 and a federal welfare program would not be distinguishable. The Court would invalidate the condition as would my proposed presumption. Retirement pensions. The converse of a requirement that a welfare re- cipient work where possible, as a condition of continued eligibility for payment, is the provision in the social security laws that certain old-age benefits be denied in whole or in part to those who do paid work past the retirement age.240 Here, if a constitutional right is threatened, it is the right to work rather than the right not to work. But here again, a different characterization yields an opposite conclusion. Old-age pen- 238. See text accompanying note 20 supra. 239. Sherbert v.

To this extent, no coercion exists, merely a ra- tional qualification for retirement pensions. Marital status. Decisions relating to marriage and child rearing, im- mune in most respects from government regulation, nevertheless may alter the flow of money to or from the government. Marital status and the number of dependent children, for example, may affect the level of welfare payments. Social security retirement pensions are tied to whether the beneficiaries are married or not-depending on the spouses' earning histories, marriage sometimes has a positive effect, sometimes a negative one. Based largely on the comparative earnings of both spouses, marriage will sometimes result in higher, sometimes lower, federal income taxes, and personal exemptions based on the number of dependent children will usually reduce taxes.241 Marital sta- tus and the number of children also control the level of military pay. We have grown accustomed to most of these disparities, with con- cern about the fairness of some of them, but not about their constitu- tionality. Most of them are probably intended to adjust in part for differences in financial need, but some have been inaptly drawn. A common denominator is that they are not thought of as coercive, and the amounts of money at stake are not generally large enough to be decisive with respect to fundamental choices concerning personal and family life. For purposes of the taxonomy suggested in this article, these are all classifying, rather than coercive, conditions. Abortion funding. The debate over medicaid funding of abortion fits less easily into this formulation. To the extent that Maher242 and Mc- Rae243 involve merely legislative choices as to the kinds of medical assistance to fund and not to fund, the Court upheld classifying condi- tions against equal protection challenges. But more was involved-to begin with, a bitter division over abortion, which had been inflamed rather than quenched by the Court's decision in Roe v. Wade.244 Legis- lative motive is often not readily ascertainable, or is multifaceted, and even when it is relatively clear its constitutional significance is uncer- tain. One-but not the only- reason for the state and federal deci- sions not to fund the medical costs of abortion was the disapproval by some legislators of abortion and of the judicial decisions decriminaliz- ing it. Another may have been the desire to placate right-to-life sup- porters, who, even if fewer than a majority, have apparently been more vocal than their opponents. Still another might have been the view that it was undesirable, on several levels, to use government funds, derived from taxes of all, to pay for actions that even a minority thought inher- 241.

With such a mix of reasons for the funding refusal, it is not clear that the dominant legislative purpose was to put financial pressure on pregnant women to forego their right to have abortions. But the question is not necessarily one of "either/or." Conditions may be both coercive and classifying, and if so should have to pass mus- ter, constitutionally, under the standards applicable to both kinds of conditions.245 If, as some of the dissenting opinions suggested,246 a significant part of the legislative motive was to place obstacles in the way of exercise of the constitutional right to have an abortion, the pre- sumption would invalidate the condition. If the Court majorities are regarded as not having found coercion, the presumption would not ap- ply; but if they were holding that the conditions were valid in spite of substantial coercive aspects, I believe that the decisions were ill-advised and am reassured rather than troubled by the fact that the opposite result would have been reached under the standards I have suggested.247 Restraints on publication of intelligence material. The Court seemed to base its decision in Snepp248 primarily on the fact that Snepp had vio- lated his employment contract, which required him to obtain prior per- mission before publishing information learned in the course of his duties with the CIA. There were hints in the per curiam opinion, how- ever, that the same restrictions could have been imposed on intelli- gence employees even in the absence of a contract.249 If the Court had been willing to declare that such restraints would have been proper even if imposed by direct regulation, there would be no problem of the validity of a similar restraint embodied in a condition to the employ- ment relationship. Perhaps the test would be whether such a restriction could be imposed on an unpaid volunteer or an independent contrac- tor who had entered into no agreement relating to the right to publish; 245. See note 64 supra. 246. 432 U.S. at 483 (Brennan,J.); 448 U.S. at 330-33 (Brennan,J.); id. at 347 (Marshall, J.). 247. If we look at effect rather than motive, more empirical evidence may be required in order to determine the extent to which the funding cut-off was coercive. How many poor pregnant women would have had abortions if abortions had been covered by Medicaid but bore the children instead because they were not? How much financial support was offered by private family-planning and similar organizations, and how widely was the knowledge of its availability disseminated? Once a child is born to a mother qualifying for welfare, additional funds are available in most circumstances for the child's support. As noted above, this is not generally objected to, or thought of as coercive. We can postulate a law, however, providing financial support both before and after childbirth, in which the level of payments is so high as to have a major impact on the decision whether or not to abort. If the choice is really one between comparative affluence for those who give birth, versus continued poverty for those who abort, there might be clearer evidence of coercion with respect to both legislative motive and actual effect. But until such time as funding on this scale is seriously proposed, it may be premature to worry about the point at which the amount of money offered might be so great as to be properly characterized as coercive. 248. 444 U.S. 507 (1980). 249.

If the interest in preventing publication of such information is of insufficient importance to sustain its application to the conduct of persons not linked to the CIA by a contractual or other employment relationship, Snepp seems to have been wrongly decided. Campaignfunding. We might next turn to a case where the result seems reasonable enough but the analysis raises problems for my for- mulation. Buckley v. Valeo 250 held that the imposition of monetary limits on the expenditures of a candidate for public office was an unconstitu- tional deprivation of first amendment rights, but that such limits could be imposed on a candidate who accepted government funding of his campaign. Should this be regarded as an offer of money in exchange for relinquishment of a constitutional right? If government money were offered in exchange for the candidate's agreement not to criticize the party in power or the president's policy on Nicaragua, a serious constitutional threat would be created. What distinguishes Buckley v. Valeo, however, is that the restriction upon the candidate in that case, as well as the offer from the government, both involved only money. Congress gave the candidate the choice of which of two modes of campaign financing to adopt-appeal to the market or rely on a government subsidy. The receipt of government funds for campaigning is incompatible with the spending of unlimited amounts from other sources; if the purpose of the government subsidy is to af- ford some degree of equality among candidates in the campaign re- sources available to them, that purpose would be defeated if a candidate could use government money on top of all the funds avail- able from private sources.251 The choice imposed on candidates seems no more oppressive than a rule that a lawyer who wishes to work for the government must relin- quish private practice, or at least not receive payment for outside work.252 The provisions upheld in Buckley v. Valeo seem to fall well within the category of offers that expand the options and augment, rather than curtail, the rights of the recipient. Therefore, if the sug- gested presumption were applied in this situation, it would seem clearly to be rebutted. 250. 424 U.S. 1 (1976). 251. But cf. Federal Election Comm'n v.

CONCLUSION The principal question raised at the beginning of this article was whether the federal government could constitutionally regulate matters otherwise beyond its power, through the device of attaching conditions to expenditures of money. As might have been expected, a single cate- gorical answer did not emerge. As with most difficult, and therefore interesting, legal questions, the answer is not "always" or "never," but "sometimes" or "it depends." In addition, different answers have emerged for the three253 princi- pal areas into which I have separated my analysis: presumptive power, state autonomy, and civil liberties. Each seems to have its own distinc- tive problems, history, and criteria. When the question is whether imposition of the condition is war- ranted under the presumptive powers of Congress, it has been settled since 1937 that: (a) Congress may spend for the general welfare, which includes purposes not comprehended within any of its other powers; and (b) whether spending is in support of the general welfare or to implement another federal power, Congress may attach relevant condi- tions to the funds being offered even if the consequence is to regulate 253. As has been mentioned, see note 15 supra, a fourth important area of difficulty in connection with federal conditional spending is the potential for interference by Congress with presidential power through attaching strings that may threaten the constitutional author- ity of the executive branch. Since the main concern of this article is with the potential use of conditional spending to effect fundamental changes in the power of the federal government as a whole, its relationship to the separation of powers among the branches of the federal gov- ernment is mentioned only in passing. For a more complete discussion, see L. HENKIN, supra note 54, at 113-17, 135-36 (1972). Few inherent powers of the presidency are immune from express congressional curtail- ment. See Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 637-55 (1952) (ackson,J., concurring). Hence, questions of the power of Congress to intrude on presidential authority through conditional spending are not likely to arise often. Nevertheless, congressional inter- ference with the executive branch might come in the form of an appropriation for the ex- penses of the Department of State only if A is appointed Secretary of State (or only if B is not), or only if the President recognizes the government in Taiwan rather than that in Beijing. The appointive and foreign affairs powers of the President would be threatened in such instances, but except for the possibility of a bill of attainder challenge it might not be possible to vindi- cate these presidential powers in court. Cf United States v. Lovett, 328 U.S. 303, 315-18 (1946). Salaries of both the President and members of the federal judiciary are specifically pro- tected against diminution, see U.S. CONST. art. II, ? 1, para. 7; id. at art. III, ? 1, and violations would bejusticiable. See United States v. Will, 449 U.S. 200 (1980); O'Malley v. Woodrough, 307 U.S. 277 (1939); Evans v. Gore, 253 U.S. 245 (1920). Reductions in salary contingent on the refusal of the president, or the courts, to carry out congressional policy that they would otherwise not be obliged to follow, would probably be ineffective, since they could similarly be challenged. Other devices, however, such as threats by Congress to curtail presidential or judicial staffs or pensions if the other branches refused to do its bidding, might violate the spirit of the Constitution without giving rise to any obvious judicial remedy. Too much weight ought not to be attached to the fact that these issues tend not to get litigated. Presidents and members of Congress are alert to the constitutional implications of their actions and do not hesitate to use constitutional arguments in support of their positions in the political arena.

With the expansion in the reach of the enumerated powers of Congress, presumptive power is no longer a se- rious problem. The other aspect of federalism-whether the conditions imposed along with the funds intrude too deeply into the independence of state and local governments-gives rise to a different set of issues. Early in the history of federal government assistance, when such programs were few and funding small, the Supreme Court found nothing wrong with the attachment of strings to grants, since the state generally had the easy alternative of declining the money and avoiding the condition. The Court still almost routinely upholds intrusions that would almost certainly be invalidated if imposed by direct regulation, when couched as conditions to eligibility for federal funds. But with the budgets of state and local governments now so greatly dependent on federal money, the premise that the funds can readily be rejected if the condi- tion is deemed oppressive seems no longer realistic. Thus far, how- ever, the doctrine has not changed in response to changed circumstances. Because Congress has not tried to interfere directly with state func- tions in ways similar to those in which it so frequently intrudes indi- rectly, we cannot match up specific cases to demonstrate that the Court will uphold, under the spending power, regulations that it would reject if imposed directly. But it is unlikely that direct regulatory legislation that compelled the states to extend unemployment insurance programs to public employess,254 to exclude party officials from certain positions in state government,255 to restructure governmental departments or create new ones,256 or to alter the division of authority between the governor and legislature or between the state and its subdivisions257 would all be upheld by the Court; yet when imposed as conditions to grants of federal funds, all have survived challenge. The Supreme Court has never held a conditional grant to state or local governments to be unconstitutional. We can hypothesize some imaginary cases, however, that would seem to constitute so great a threat to the quasi-sovereignty of the states as to be clearly invalid. Pre- scription by Congress, in exchange for federal money, of the length of a governor's or legislature's term of office, the boundaries of counties, election rather than appointment of state judges (and other state offi- cials), or a requirement that the state ratify a proposed amendment to the Constitution of the United States, for example, would all probably be held unconstitutional. No parade of imaginary horrors is necessary if it is accepted that there are at least some situations where the intru- sion would be too great to pass muster. Nothing quite this bad has 254.

At least for now, the Supreme Court seems to have accepted the proposition that political safeguards generally provide adequate pro- tection to state autonomy even in the case of direct regulation.258 The traditional view is that it is even easier to uphold conditional spending, but, as suggested above,259 conditional spending may not be an aforti- orn case. Perhaps at least some of the more egregious recent intrusions cut too deeply into state autonomy and should have been invalidated. But assertions about the demise of the states seem premature. Judicial in- tervention may yet come, but whether it does may depend less on ab- stract doctrine than on the practicalities at the time, the relative importance of the federal funds to state and local budgets, general per- ceptions as to the extent to which political devices still offer protection against federal overreaching, and the degree of interference threatened by the challenged conditions. Turning to the problem of possible threats to individual rights aris- ing out of conditional spending, I have suggested a rebuttable pre- sumption that Congress may not attach conditions to federal funds that coerce conduct which it would be forbidden to control directly. It is striking that in recent years the majority of the Court has almost never expressed in the civil liberties area what it has said with respect to inter- ference with state autonomy: If you object to the condition, you have the simple alternative of not taking the money. The apparently felt ne- cessity to justify the conditions on principled rather than consensual grounds suggests that in this area at least, in most even though in not all cases, the Court is asking the right questions. That doesn't guaran- tee that it will always reach the right answers, but it helps. Recall how differently the Supreme Court approached two cases de- cided the same day, both upholding Hatch Act prohibitions on partisan political activity.260 The Court carefully analyzed restraints on activi- ties of federal employees in terms of the balance between the desirabil- ity of a civil service insulated from party politics against the reduction in the employees' rights of expression; yet, the prohibition of the in- volvment of party officials in the administration of federal grants to the 258. Garcia v. San Antonio Metro. Transit Auth., 469 U.S. 528, 551-55 (1985). Some evidence supporting that conclusion may be found in the fact that following Garcia, Congress enacted and the President signed legislation intended to remove the greatest interference that the Fair Labor Standards Act was regarded as imposing on state and local government; in- stead of being obliged to spend what was estimated as up to $3 billion per year on overtime pay, they were permitted to offer time off in lieu thereof.

This difference in approach may reflect a belief, perhaps less valid now than it once may have been, that the states are sufficiently strong to resist the blandishments of federal money, while private individuals and institutions tend not to be. A recurring theme, in different con- texts and in different formulations throughout American constitutional history, is that judicial intervention is most appropriate when the demo- cratic system cannot be counted upon to provide a political remedy for abuse. These propositions, taken together, suggest that political self- help by victims is less feasible when majorities seek to curtail civil liber- ties than when Congress goes beyond its enumerated powers or inter- feres with the autonomy of state or local government. The sharp difference that has emerged between the answers in the federalism-re- lated areas and those related to civil liberties should therefore not be surprising. Reflections of either or both of these propositions can be found as early as the Federalist Papers;261 again in McCulloch v. Maryland,262 whereJohn Marshall contrasted the political safeguards that would pre- vent federal abuse of state instrumentalities with their ineffectiveness when a state sought to move against a federal agency;263 again in the Carolene Products footnote264 and other Supreme Court writings of that period, especially other opinions byJustice Stone in the same October 1937 Term of the Supreme Court;265 in Herbert Wechsler's Political Safeguards of Federalism;266 in recent writings by Lusky,267 Ely,268 and Choper;269 and most recently in Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority. 270 A multiple rather than a single answer to the ques- tion posed at the start of this article is thus in keeping with recurring themes in American constitutional thought. 261.
