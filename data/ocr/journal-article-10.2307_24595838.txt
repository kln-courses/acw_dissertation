<plain_text><page sequence="1">ASTYAGES, CYRUS AND ZOROASTER: SOLVING A HISTORICAL DILEMMA By Abolala Soudavar Houston, lexas In memoriam Xavier Tremblay (1971-2011), a most erudite and generous philologist who shall be missed. Abstract Casting Darius as a descendant of the Achaemenid main line of kings, and Cyrus as one belonging to a sec ondary branch, François Vallat has argued that Darius's contempt for his paternal cousin stemmed from the perception that Cyrus usurped his forefather's title and position. As it happens, it parallels my own theory by which I had explained that Darius' kingly ideology reflected his antagonism toward the Median ideology. Whereas Vallat sees Cyrus as the one who banished Zoroaster from his land, I propose instead that the real cul prit was Astyages, and that in revenge, Zoroastrian priests eventually turned him into a Dahhâk portrayed with two serpents on his shoulders. They also modified Iran's ancient history to include "friends" and to banish "enemies". The antagonism between the followers of Zoroaster and their enemies, however, was exacerbated by an ongoing feud between the caste of the Median magi and that of the Persian fire priests, the pärsäs, to which belonged Darius and his ancestors. Keywords Astyages; Cyrus; Zoroaster; parser, Ardashir-khwarrah I. INTRODUCTION Persian history has always suffered from a lack of documentation. When documents are available, they are often difficult to read, and when readable they are not readily understandable. One must then speculate on its meaning and its implications. In this climate of uncertainty, irrational speculations can blossom, like the idea that Darius (r. 521^186 BC) was a liar and forged a fake lineage. It is irrational because it defies both common practice and common sense. As one can see from the tribal structures of modern Iran (e.g. the Bakhtiârîs), whenever there appears a strong leader (e.g. Husayn-qulT Khän), within a few generations his descendants fill the leadership posi tions of their clan.1 Every little valley is then ruled by a kinglet or khän, all cousins to one another. The same was probably true for the Persians. Thus if Dar ius wanted to find a common ancestor for himself and 1 From 1862 to 1956, all Bakhtiärl chieftains were either descendents of Husayn-qulT Khän or his brother Imäm- qulï Khän, of the Haft Lang BakhtiärTs; Digard 1989. Cyrus (r. 559-29 BC), all he had to do was to go back a few generations to find one (presumably Achae menes), without lying. More importantly, when Darius had the Bisutün inscriptions written, he had already crushed all his enemies and was in full control of the empire. Where was the need to lie for a king who took so much pride in combating the "Lie"? The following anecdote may be revealing. After the conquest of Delhi (AD 1739), when the Afshärid Nadir Shäh (r. 1736-47) was about to marry his son to the niece of the Mughal Emperor, protocol demanded that each side establish its ancestry seven generations back. Lacking aristocratic pedigree, Nadir Shäh instructed his secretary to recite that the groom was "the son of Nädir Shäh, the son of the Sword, the grandson of the Sword; and so on until they have a descent of seventy instead of seven generations".2 He was bluntly stating that naked force was his legitimacy and that an elaborate ancestry was of no use to him. From a position of force, Nädir did not need to fake his ancestry, nor did Darius. 2 Axworthy 2006: 11.</page><page sequence="2">46 ABOLALA SOUDAVAR Fortunately, François Vallat's recent articles have combatted this senseless theory by casting Darius as the descendant of the Achaemenid main line of kings, and Cyrus as one belonging to a secondary branch. Darius' contempt for his cousin therefore stemmed from the perception of Cyrus usurping his forefather's title and position.3 As it happens, it parallels my own theory in which I had explained that Darius' kingly ideology could only be understood against the foil of a Median one that saw Mithra and Apam Napät as purveyors of khvarenah—and therefore authority—in the two realms of night and day.4 But where Vallat sees Cyrus as the one who banished Zoroaster from his land, I shall propose instead that the real culprit was Astyages (r. 585-50 BC), and that Zoroastrian priests rewrote history by eliminating those perceived as the enemies of their Prophet. In support, I shall present three types of argument. First, by analysing the Pasar gadae and Persepolis bas-reliefs, 1 shall demonstrate Cyrus's reverence for Mithra and Apam Napät, and bring an added vista into Darius' animosity towards the "Median" magi. Second, I shall present this theory as a logical construct that explains two extraordinary and otherwise unexplainable aspects of Iranian history: (1) the "Dahhäk dilemma", or the fact that the Iranian mighty king Bivarasp was portrayed with two serpents on his shoulders; and (2) the "Cyrus dilemma", or the fact that the memory of such an important figure was erased from Iranian history. Third, based on an expla nation offered by Pierre Lecoq for the term pärsava, I shall explain that, rather than deriving a mean ing attached to the far side ("those from the frontier lands"), one should understand it as one pertaining to the near side, i.e. those who stood next to something, that something being the fire altar. This will finally allow me to present a sensible interpretation for Dar ius' claim that he was Pärsä son of Pärsä, Arya Arya ciça, a claim that was at the root of his quest for legiti macy and that deeply affected Persian kingly ideology. For lack of documentation, my aim is to derive a meaning through correlating evidence from disparate sources whose content may not be entirely coherent. In this quest, mythical stories and tales following a recurrent structure cannot be discarded. If past his 3 Darius completely ignores Cyrus. When he mentions Cyrus's name, it is in passing and only to inform which per son was a son of Cyrus, or who claimed to be one; Vallat 2011:278. 4 Soudavar 2010a: 125-31. torians reverted to topoi, it is generally because they were confused about a piece of information and felt the need to wrap it into a familiar tale to make it more understandable to their audience. A topos may there fore contain elements of truth. Truth was of course often altered by political propaganda or for the sake of religious conformity. But aspects of it still found their way into myths and topoi, and manifest them selves in bits and pieces. If these can be correlated into a cohesive conjecture, an overarching theory can then be built upon it. As for detectives on a crime scene, any information may be of value to formulate a sensi ble theory. The more coherent this theory looks in its different facets, the more valid it is. II. BACKGROUND Since what I am about to suggest goes against the grain of yet another misconception, that Zoroaster lived c. 1000 BC rather than in the seventh-sixth century BC, a little background is necessary. I shall not try to point out the inherent flaws of this misconception, for I have done it in my 2010 publication5 and see no need to repeat it here, because the present paper is in fact a sequel to the said article. But if I persist against this misconception, it is because I constantly discover new evidence in support of a conclusion that I only reached by accident. Indeed, in search of the origins of farr symbolism, I had stumbled, in 2003, upon two stanzas of the Avesta that I perceived to situate the birth date of Zoroaster in the late seventh century BC.6 The array of new discoveries since then has not only consolidated my initial hypothesis but has shed light on a multitude of obscure phenomena in Iranian history. The fortuitous and revelatory stanzas are from the Farvardïn Yasht: 13:94 "Let us rejoice, for a priestly man is born, the Spitamid Zarathushtra. From now on (iSa ap^m)... From now on (iôa apam)... 13:95 "From now on (iôa apam), Mithra ... will promote all supreme authorities of the nations and will pacify those in revolt. From now on (iôa ap^m), strong Apam Napät will promote all the supreme authorities of j the nations and will subjugate all those in revolt. birth of Zoroaster I political event 5 Soudavar 2010a: 112-19. 6 Soudavar 2003: 85-88, 122.</page><page sequence="3">ASTYAGES, CYRUS AND ZOROASTER 47 Fig. 1.

AD 309-79) (Fig. 1), and the dual role of the sunflower and the lotus, as symbols of the khvarenah associated with each of these two deities. Consequently, I inter preted brick panels from Persepolis as representing the full cycle of the khvarenah, from its encapsulated underwater state to its burst in the sky (Figs. 2, 3, 4).7 But Yt 13:94-95 clearly pegged Zoroaster's birth date to a political event: the time when Mithra and Apam Napät were paired up to uphold authority and to vanquish rebellion in a plurality of nations. The two underlined words pointed to the formation of an empire, which could only be that of the Median Empire 7 Soudavar 2003: 93—97; Soudavar 2010a: 121—25.</page><page sequence="4">48 ABOLALA SOUDAVAR toward the end of the seventh century BC. Such a conclusion was in perfect harmony with the axiom that "258 years had elapsed between the coming of Zoroaster and that of Alexander", since, by the latter axiom, Zoroaster had to be born c. 618 BC. The valid ity of this didactic process, I had argued, was further strengthened by two independent observations.8 The first was purely iconographie: the pairing of the lotus and the sunflower, as emblems of Mithra and Apam Napät, occurred c. seventh-sixth century BC, confirm ing once more that these two deities were integrated into the Median kingly ideology in conjunction with the vast empire that the Medes established at that time by sacking Assyria and subjugating Urartu. The sec ond was explanatory: it provided a context for Darius' insistence on having his orders carried out by "day and by night" (.DB §7-8). Indeed, it is rather odd for a king to emphasise such a point, as kingly orders are absolute and must not be constrained by time. This oddity can only be explained against the foil of a Median concept that considered night and day as two separate realms, one governed by Mithra and the other by Apam Napät. Darius' monotheistic vision of a world presided over by Ahura Mazdâ alone required an amalgamation of the two. He thus expressed it in writing at Bisutün, and through images in his Persepolitan iconography. The study here below will add yet another array of evidence to a theory that already finds much support in a variety of corollary arguments. III. CHASING ZOROASTER FROM HIS LAND In conjunction with establishing Cyrus as the one who dethroned Darius' grandfather Arsames, Vallat also speculated that, where Zoroaster laments: Y.46.1 "To what land shall I go to flee, whither to flee? From nobles and from my peers they sever me, nor are the people pleased with me [ ], nor the Liar rulers of the land. How am I to please thee, Mazda Ahura?"; Y.46.14. O Zarathushtra, what righteous man is thy friend for the great covenant? Who wills to have good fame? It is the Kava Vishtäspa at the consummation. he is referring to an ill-treatment perpetrated by Cyrus that led to his departure, while Vishtäspa and his fam ily offered him protection and support.9 8 Soudavar 2010a: 126-28. 9 Vallat 2010: 66. If one accepts a late date for Zoroaster based on the "258 axiom", as I do, then one is almost com pelled to see the Vishtäspa of the Avesta and Darius' father as one. Therefore, Vallat's suggestion of the same was a step in the right direction, except for the fact that he perhaps carried it too far by suggesting that Zoroaster accompanied Vishtäspa in his east ern campaign of 521 BC, because, in the late date scenario, Zoroaster had died c. 541 BC.10 It was in the middle of a conversation with Vallat, and trying to reconcile his view with the "258 axiom" that it dawned on me that, if we took Astyages, rather than Cyrus, as the one who chased Zoroaster, we would have a solution to many dilemmas. The first dilemma concerns Dahhäk, the famous tyrant of the Shäh-näma and Arabic histories of ancient Iran, who has two serpents springing out of his shoulders. A close look at these sources, however, reveals that there is nevertheless a hidden element of praise about him. He is portrayed as having been more "powerful than pharaohs", and having had achieve ments "unequalled by any of the prophets"; and was more powerful than any known human being and was a king whose his lineage reached back to the primor dial man/king Gayumarth, and while Arabic texts called him Dahhäk, his Iranian name was Azhi-dahäg ("snake-man") or Bivarasb.11 The latter is more likely to be an epithet than a name, and by its very mean ing (bivarasp = 10,000 horses) designates a man of immense fortitude and fortune. More important, his descent from Gayumarth, who gave the Aryan people its ciOra (i.e. its khvarenah),12 qualified him as a legiti mate Iranian ruler. As early as the 1900s, scholars have noticed a great similarity between Herodotus' story of Astyages and that of Azhi-dahäg, not only phonetically but also in the narrative details, such as the facts that they were both defeated by the defection or mutiny of their own people, or that both Astyages and Azhi-dahäg were left alive after defeat.13 Among the ancient chroni clers, Movsës Xorenac'i mentions that the King of the 10 Zoroaster had lived seventy-seven years (Zadspram 23:9); Soudavar 2010a: 136, n.10. 11 al-Tabarï 1996,1:136;Ibnal-Athîrl996,1:264; al-MaqdisT 1995: 502; Dâdagï 1990: 128. Martin Schwartz renders Ài Dahäka as "the hominoid serpent, the Snake-man" (Skja ervo 1989). 12 See Yt 13:87, and its interpretation in Soudavar 2006b: 169-70. 13 See for instance Oldham 1905: 37-40.</page><page sequence="5">ASTYAGES, CYRUS AND ZOROASTER 49 Medes was named Adahak.14 And, whereas Berossus attributes the construction of certain gardens in Baby lon to Nebuchadnezzar II (r. 605-562 BC), trying to recreate in lower Mesopotamia a Median climate for his wife Amytis, daughter of Astyages,15 the Bun dahishn and other Zoroastrian texts relate that Azhi dahäg made a dwelling in Babylon and had many wonderful things there.16 There are simply too many correlating facts to ignore the possibility of a common identity for the two. The Dahhäk dilemma is therefore about a mighty Iranian king or emperor, vilified by subsequent chroni clers who not only made him a snake-man but wiped out his ancestors and/or predecessors by amalgamating them into one long reign of 1000 years. The question is first, by whom and for what reason? And second, where did the snakes come from? The scenario by which Astyages is the one who drove out Zoroaster from his land provides a ready answer to the first set of questions. Perceiving Asty ages as the arch-enemy, the Zoroastrian priests who transmitted history to their own liking turned him into a monster and obliterated his family. His grand son Cyrus probably shared the same fate, especially if he too upheld the Median kingly ideology. In my 2010a study, I have already produced much evidence in support of Cyrus' Median ideology, but a new look at Pasargadae will deliver to us a decisive proof and the answer to both the Cyrus and Dahhäk dilemmas. IV. GODS OF CYRUS On a door jamb of Pasargadae there is a relief that has been erroneously called "Winged Genius" even though it has two characteristics that qualify it as a most powerful deity (Fig. 8a). First, there is the fact that, in ancient iconography, anthropomorphic winged 14 Schmidt 1987b; Skjaervo 1989. 15 Kuhrt 2007, 2: 44. Briant notes that Berossus' account of Amytis cannot be reconciled with facts (Briant 1996: 35), even though the name of Amytis accords with Ctesias' account (see n. 108 below) and despite the fact that Amelie Kuhrt believes Berossus had access to "original documents" (Kuhrt 2007,2:45). What is of interest to us, though, is that the Babylonian Berossus saw a tie between Astyages and Babylon, which concords with the Bundahishn (see next note). 16 Skajaervo 1989; Bundahishn (XXXII: 15): "Dahäg's man sion in Babylon was just like a crane". creatures invariably represent the supernatural coun terpart to humans, i.e. deities. Second, he wears a royal Elamite attire17 that must represent the supreme deity of Cyrus, King of Anshan,18 in the same way as that in Naqsh-i Rustam, Ahurâ Mazdâ is clad with the same attire as Ardashir I (r. AD 224-41), and Jesus is often represented in the attire of Charlemagne (r. AD 768-814). If Cyrus followed his grandfather's kingly ideology, then this supreme deity must have been Mithra, to whom sacrifices continued to be made at his tomb site long after his death.19 And indeed it can be perceived as such, provided we first put aside the common misconception that Mithra's head must necessarily be adorned with shining rays. Mithra was first and foremost a god of covenants, but was also associated with light and sun. His role as purveyor of the khvarenah, however, is empha sised in the Avesta,20 and the qualities that Yt 13:95 recognises in him, namely, to support authority and to vanquish rebellion, are predicated on his control over the khvarenah. As such, the primary symbol of Mithra within the context of a Median ideology should be in reference to khvarenah and not solar luminescence. In fact, the regal crown of the winged figure projects just that (Fig. 6). Granted that the origin of this complex crown was the Egyptian 'atef crown (single cone, Fig. 5b) or the hem-hem crown (triple cone, Fig. 5a), which may have entered Iranian iconography via Syria or Mesopotamia, but so were the origins of the lotus, sunflower, and the winged-disk. Although the latter are of foreign origin, they were adopted because they could represent the Iranian concept of khvarenah. A borrowing without adaptation was simply of no value. And the process continued in Sasanian times; hence the symbol of Eros, as a winged child, was adopted then to represent Apam Napät. The wings naturally emphasised the supernatural qualities of the deity and the child figure alluded to Apam Napät's name, the Grandson of Waters.21 The choice of the Egyptian crown for the figure of Mithra was no different. It was adopted because it could admirably project the full cycle of the khvar enah as in the Persepolis brick panel (Fig. 2). Indeed, 17 See for instance Sekunda 2010: 268-71. 18 For Cyrus' dynastic hold on the Elamite capital city of Anshän see Potts 2005. I? Briant 1996: 106,108. 20 See e.g. Yt 10:16, 27. 21 Soudavar 2009: 426-27; Soudavar 2012: 3-5.</page><page sequence="6">50 ABOLALA SOUDAVAR Fig. 5a. Egyptian hemhem type crown of Horus. Ptolemaic.

Metropolitan Museum of Art. at the bottom of the crown we have pearl roundels with concentric circles on a slightly spherical surface. Instead of stacked lotuses, we have a cluster of reeds tied together to indicate the rise of the khvarenah from the waters. And finally, at the top we have solar discs that radiate the khvarenah (Fig. 8a). It is perhaps no mere coincidence that the Bundahishn states that the "khvarenah of Firaydun sat at the bottom of the 22 Pierre Bergé, auction catalogue of 17-6-2010, lot 188, Paris. reed".23 Since Firaydün is the one who defeats and captures Dahhäk in the Shâh-nâma, Cyrus' lore must have been partially transplanted to this mythical fig ure of the Indo-Iranian past. In addition, because the serpent was associated with the waters, especially in the Elamite tradition, the symbol of a solar disk on the head of a rising snake projected the rise of the khvar enah from the waters.24 The adoption of the Egyptian crown was accom panied by an adaptation process which made the symbol more relevant in the Iranian context. A Syrian intermediary (Fig. 7) may or may not have facilitated this adaptation process, since we can see similar additions and modifications on it. The Syrian model, as well as the Egyptian one, seems to incorporate a sun discus at the bottom level whereas the Pasargadae one has a pearl roundel.25 Therefore, at the bottom 23 Dâdaghï 1990: 151. 24 It is interesting to note that, according to Kellens, the Vedic Apam Napät was a serpent at the bottom of the sea; Kellens 2010-11: Cours 6. 25 Since the origin of the hemhem crown is generally traced back to the reign of Akhenaten (r. 1380—1362 BC) and to the worship of the sun disk, Aton, it is tempting to imagine that the adoption of this precise crown was in full knowl edge of its solar connotations. One must note, however, that the said crown had two more pairs of uraei hanging from it (see e.g. Freed 1999: 180, fig. 139). But, since most extant representations of the hemhem crown are from the Ptole maic period, it is not beyond the realm of possibility that the re-appearance of a symbol associated with the Atonian heresy was due to the Persian conquest of Egypt by a Cam byses who most probably adhered to the kingly ideology of</page><page sequence="7">ASTYAGES, CYRUS AND ZOROASTER 51 !&lt;!«•-VWw." .j: *r: &lt;-o Fig. 8a.

Private collection. level, the former two have celestial elements and the latter has aquatic ones. Also, the herringbone design at the centre of the Syrian crown (perhaps represent ing the bark of a palm tree) has been replaced with reeds. It is not clear whether the Syrian model pro jected a similar concept within its own context or not; but the Pasargadae characteristics were all chosen to enhance the projection of khvarenah. In choosing the triple-coned hemhem crown, rather than the more familiar 'atef crown, the Medes opted for the bundle of reeds instead of the more common smooth-sur faced cone that imitated the crown of Upper Egypt. And the tripling of the motifs responded to a concept that I have termed elsewhere farreh-afzun or ever increasing khvarenah,26 It now seems that, contrary to my 2003 assessment,27 the composition of the Persepolis brick panel (Fig. 2) was not a novel idea but was entirely inspired by the Pasargadae crown. In particular, the ingenious idea of projecting a sphere on a flat brick surface through concentric circles was derived from the encapsulated khvarenah at the bottom of the reeds.28 his father, and may have worn it there. 26 Soudavar 2003: 16; Soudavar 2010b. 27 Soudavar 2003: 102. 28 An earlier version of the concentric circles appears on the Bukân bricks. But Darius wanted to sever the concept of khvar enah from Mithra,29 and thus modified the reeds into—once again Egyptian—stacked lotuses, and the solar disks into sunflowers, and more importantly, he presented the khvarenah as an independent source of regal power, created by Ahura Mazda and shining through its own light rather than through Mithra's. To emphasise the latter point he surrounded the khvarenah composition with triangles in lieu of light rays (Figs. 2, 24) in conjunction with the use of the word cidra, as manifestation of the khvarenah (see below, sec tion VIII). The string of outwardly pointing triangles subsequently gained widespread recognition as light rays, and appears, for instance, on the contour of the sun disk of the Buddha in Gandhara statues (Fig. 9). Finally, size is important. In conjunction with its regal Elamite robe and khvarenah-projecting crown, the large size of this symbol of Mithra certainly vouches for its eminent position in the pantheon of Cyrus' gods. Although Yt 13:95 mentions Mithra first, it gives equal status to Apam Napät. It therefore behoves our theory to have an equally important and sizeable sym bol for the second member of this deity pair. I believe that the remnants of a pair of broken door jambs indicate the existence in Pasargadae of a similar rep resentation for Apam Napät (Fig. 10). They depict a 29 Soudavar 2010a: 121-25.</page><page sequence="8">52 ABOLALA SOUDAVAR Fig. 10. Lower part of door jamb depicting Apam Napat. Pasargadae. fish-clad anthropomorphic figure, perhaps derived from Assyrian or Neo-Babylonian prototypes (Fig. 11). Whereas Mithra's figure has wings to qualify it as a supernatural being, a bull chimera stands guard behind him, possibly holding a long vertical spear. Through association with its supernatural guard, the fish-clad figure must be supernatural as well, and its fish cloak indicates aquatic affinity. The figure is thus well suited to represent Apam Napät. Once again, we have a symbol that was borrowed from foreign lands but rendered meaningful in the Iranian context. While the door jamb of Mithra stood tall until recent centuries, that of Apam Napät seems to have suffered deliberate destruction. As Mary Boyce has explained, one aspect of Apam Napät which has miraculously survived in Yt 19:52, is that he seems to have been a creator-god "who created men, who shaped men". It obviously clashed with the creation prerogatives of Ahura Mazdä, similarly phrased in Yasna 1.1: "who created us, who shaped [us]".30 Apam Napät was therefore bound to disappear in the Mazdean pantheon and was gradually replaced with another aquatic deity, Anähitä. On the other hand, the extremely popular solar deity Mithra was not easily replaceable, and in lieu of being pushed out, he was sanitised and reinte grated into the Mazdean pantheon. The fate of the Pasargadae door jambs may actually reflect the same 30 Boyce 1987; see also Kellen 2010—11: Cours 5, which ech oes the same. Fig. 11. Neo-Baby Ionian seal imprint. On loan to the Metropolitan Museum from the Morgan Library. phenomenon. As the surviving deity, Mithra's symbol was kept, while that of Apam Napät was discarded. In both cases, however, enough survives to ascertain that Apam Napât once stood as tall as Mithra. As the symbols of the most venerated deities by Cyrus, they can only confirm what Yt 13:94-95 had implic itly suggested, that the primary gods of the Medians were these two, and Cyrus, as inheritor of the Median Empire, naturally followed the same kingly ideology. V. ZOROASTER'S REVENGE Legends are never created out of thin air, and Dahhäk's transformation into a snake-man must have been inspired from a powerful symbol. Our Pasar gadae crown of Mithra, with its two uraei, is where the denigrators of Astyages got the bizarre idea of planting two snakes on his shoulders (Fig. 8b). It is not clear whether the crown of Mithra was the actual crown that Cyrus wore, but in the same way that the robe of the winged figure reflected the royal Elamite robe of Cyrus, it is a definite possibility. And, it may be that it was actually the crown of his grandfather and that he donned it to emphasise continuity on the Median throne. Be that as it may, the serpents on the crown of Mithra must have been so representative of the Median kingly ideology that they became the instrument of the vilification of Astyages. So much so</page><page sequence="9">ASTYAGES, CYRUS AND ZOROASTER 53 that Darius, when adopting the Egyptian winged disk for the ultimate Symbol of the khvarenah, scratched out its two uraei to avoid association with a Median Symbol and replaced them with floating ribbons (Fig. 4). Astyages was thus equated with Azhidahag, i.e. the mythical Indo-Iranian snake-man and labelled as such.31 It proved to be a lasting label, and by the same token, the serpent was qualified as a xrafstar, or nox ious creature, by later Zoroastrians. VI. THE IDEABEHIND YTS 13:94-95 In Pasargadae, we have found solid proof for our interprétation of y13:95 ؛ as to how it reflected Median kingly ideology. What remains to be explained is why Yt 13:95 came in the wake of 13:94, pegging it to the birth of Zoroaster. It is a common trait of religious texts and hagio graphie accounts that they situate the birth of prophets or saintly figures at a fortunate time in order to convey the preordained nature of their mission or to advertise the auspiciousness that it entailed. Iranian theologians, for instance, fabricated a haàïth by which the Prophet Muhammad proudly proclaimed that "I was bora dur ing the time of the most just king", alluding to the reign of the Sasanian Khosrow I (r. AD 531-79) renowned for his justice.32 In so doing, they were associating the Prophet's birth with an era of justice and at the same time moving the centre of gravity of the Islamic empire closer to the Iranian lands. For the author of Yt 19, the defeat of the mighty Assyrians (c. 614 BC) and the création of the Median Empire were due to the auspicious birth of Zoroaster; but since he could not praise the glory of the Medeswho had chased Zoro aster from his land he reinterpreted that period as the time when two Iranian deities became allpowerful and cast their hegemony over the newly-conquered territories. In the meantime, Mithra, of Median name and fame, had been sanitised and fully reintegrated 31 The Switch from Astyages' name to the snake-man Azhi dahäg also followed the rules of a game followed by the man on the Street as opposed to philologists (see n. 97 below, especially the last example). Thus Astyages, whose name Ishtevegu (Babyl. Is-îu-me-gu), reflected the Old Ira nian form *Rsti-vaiga- "swinging the spear, lance-hurler" (Schmidt 1987b), was easily switched to the similarly-end ing name of Azhi-dahaga, the snake-man. 32 (ولدت فى زس الملك المائل انوثيروان), Majlisi 1983, 5: 250, 254,275. into the Zoroastrian panthéon, and Apam Napat was lingering on but not totally banished.33 Better to evoke them than the arch-enemy Medes. Cyrus being the grandson of the hated Astyages, and a king who did not recognise the supremacy of Ahura Mazda, was not vilified as his grandfather was. His persona was partially transplanted on to the dragonslayer Thraetaona, who became Firaydun in Iranian lore, the one who caused Dahhak's downfall but did not kill him (in the same way that Cyrus put an end to the Median dynasty but did not kill his grandfa ther Astyages). In the process, Cyrus' name was wiped out from Iranian history—as related by Zoroastrian priests—along with that of his ancestors and pred ecessors, ail perceived as Zoroaster's foes (see below, section VIII). The Dahhak and Cyrus dilemmas are in fact nothing but the reflection of Zoroaster's revenge on the Medes as concocted by the Zoroastrian clergy. VII. DARIUS'ANIMOSITY TOWARD THE MAGI Whereas Vallat has stressed the animosity of Darius toward Cyrus and what he perceived as the usurpa tion of his ancestral lineage, Daniel Potts has provided further proof of this animosity through his study of the area surrounding Cyrus' initial capital of Anshan and the neglect which befell it after the ascent of Darius to power.34 In parallel, I have evoked Darius' antagonism toward the Median kingly ideology, which is nowhere more evident than under the foundation stones of the Apadana, where he had buried along with gold and silver plaques, Lydian coins that displayed on their obverse the opposing heads of a bull and a lion (similar to Fig. 12). Since these coins were introduced in Lydia after Cyrus' conquest (see Appendix), and seals from Sardis (Fig. 13) unequivocally show the équivalence of the lion-bull pair to the Sun and moon (or day and night), Darius' act of burying Lydian coins was to signal the end of the day and night division of the world which his predecessors had promoted. A host of other symbols and symbolic acts were conceived in Persepolis to project the same idea.35 By their very size, the reliefs that depict Darius' kill ing a lion and a bull on door jambs of Persepolis (Figs. 33 Mithra's name is philologically Median; Lecoq 1997: 4748. 34 Potts2011. 35 Soudavar 2010a: 127 28.</page><page sequence="10">54 ABOLALA SOUDAVAR Fig. 12.

Tahmuras defeats the divs. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1970.301.3. 15, 16) should be perhaps viewed as the most important expression of this antagonism. One can of course trace back the killing of a lion by the hero king to Assyria, where it was supposed to convey the power of the mon arch in battle with the king of the animals;36 we also have Assyrian scenes of royal hunts depicting the lion or a wild bull as preys.37 But the killing of a normal bull by the hero king seems unprecedented or at best rare, and it symbolises perhaps an indirect attack on Apam Napät through the bull as symbol of night time, and/or the bovine chimera that stood guard behind him (Fig. 10).38 Thus the pairing of the two scenes on opposite doorways by Darius must be seen as one more expres sion of animosity towards the Median division of the world into day and night realms. Furthermore, the widespread attack on the Median magi must have had some bearing on the decoration pro gramme of Persepolis. For Herodotus recounts (III.79): Such was their fury, that, unless night had closed in, not a single Magus would have been left alive. The Persians observe this day with one accord, and keep it more strictly than any other in the whole year. It is then that they hold the great festival, which they call the Magophonia. No Magus may show himself abroad during the whole time that the feast lasts; but all must remain at home the entire day. 36 See for instance Collon 2005: 129. 37 See Curtis and Reade 2005: 52—53, 88. 38 Deities and supernatural entities, however, grappled with both lion and bulls without stabbing them, in early Meso potamia; see the Akkadian seals in Lambert 2001, nos. 434, 435. This day of Magophonia is also alluded to by Ctesias and Agathias.39 Moreover, in later chronicles we have the additional information that Firaydün cap tured Bivarasb (alias Astyages) on the Mihr day of the month of Mihr, called Mihrigân, a day that was cel ebrated every year thereafter.40 Once again, the infor mation from Greek and later Iranian sources seems to be complementary rather than in opposition, as both seem to celebrate the demise of the Median magi. And in tandem, they allude to an intense propaganda aimed against the magi. If so, one must be able to see its repercussions in Persepolis. I suggest that the image of a winged monster with a lion's face, bull's horns, bird feathers, ostrich feet and a scorpion tail, with whom Darius is grappling, alluded to a certain group of Mithraic magi (Fig. 17). Its justification lies beyond the scope of this study and will be part of a book that I am writing about Mithraic societies.41 Suffice it to say for the moment that one of the main symbols of these magi is the scorpion, traces of which we can detect in the ava tars of both Roman and Iranian Mithraic societies. In any case, the many features—including the scor pion tail—that this chimera shares with the demonic Assyrian monster Pazuzu clearly qualify it as a malevolent creature, whom Darius is trying to exter minate, rather than a powerful animal, the grappling 39 De Jong 1997: 377. 40 See e.g. Ibn al-FaqTh 1970: 115; al-Tabarl 1996, 1: 138. 41 Soudavar forthcoming. A seal from Sardis (Cahill 2010: 183, fig. 5) depicts the same monster chimera accompa nied by a moon sign, which perhaps links the creature with Apam Napät as Lord of the Night.</page><page sequence="11">ASTYAGES, CYRUS AND ZOROASTER 55 Fig. 15.

Hundred columns Hall, Persepolis. with whom was supposed to project the strength of the ruler (Fig. 18). On a fourth door jamb, Darius is killing another chimera in the form of a griffin, the symbolism of which I cannot fully explain. However, the four pairs of animals and chimeras, which first appear in Darius' Palace (Fig. 15), and are thereafter repeated in the colossal door jambs of the Hundred Columns Hall (Fig. 16) as well as those in the "Harem" of Xerxes (Fig. 17), always maintain the same east-west orientation. As a recurring theme, they surely sym bolise a major politico-religious expression aimed against Median ideology. While the struggle with the bull and lion may reflect Darius' quest to abolish the day-night division embraced by the Medes, the symbolism of the battle with chimera monsters may be more in tune with the combat against the magi and daiva worshippers as expressed by Xerxes in his XPh inscriptions: And among these nations there was a place where pre viously demons {daiva) were worshipped. Afterwards, by the grace of Ahura Mazda I destroyed that sanctuary of demons, and I proclaimed: "The demons shall not be worshipped!" Fig. 17. Darius killing a Fig. 18. The monster Pazuzu. monster as symbol of the Surena Collection, magi. Museum, Persepolis. Perhaps that is why divs, as opponents of Zoroas trianism, were thereafter portrayed as creatures similar to these monster chimeras (compare Figs. 14, 17). Be that as it may, the relevant question here is, if Darius killed the magi, who was then left to officiate at the ceremonies? The answer is the pärsäs, who were in fact the adversaries of the magi. VIII. PÄRSÄ SON OF PÄRSÄ In Naqsh-i Rustam (DNa §2) Darius declares himself to be adam Därayavaus ... Vistäspahyäpuça, Haxämanisiya, Pärsa, Pärsahyäpuça, Ariva. Ariva ciça a sentence that is generally translated as: "I Darius ... son of Vishtäspa the Achaemenid, a Persian (pärsa) son of Persian, an Aryan, having the Aryan lineage". The primary purpose of such inscriptions was politi cal propaganda, and in that respect, this translation has zero value, for half of the enemies that Darius depicted in Bisutün were Aryans and most of his own servants were Persians; and as I have explained else where, such a translation would only draw ridicule Fig. 15.

Its meaning hinges on the correct understanding of the word ciça, long afflicted by erro neous translations such as "seed", "lineage", "nature" or "family". Ciça meant radiance, and as such, was a manifestation of the khvarenah and a gauge for meas uring its intensity. Darius used this word to circumvent the linkage that the khvarenah had developed under the Medes with Mithra.42 As we shall see, Darius' choice of this word stigmatised his aura, and continu ously remained in use until Sasanian times. In addition, I had noticed a structural difference in the use of the words "Achaemenid" and "pârsâ" in Darius' above-mentioned declaration: one was repeated and the other not.43 It is a distinction that does not seem to affect modern philologists, but if Darius' father was an Achaemenid, so was he; there was no need to repeat it. On the other hand, if the pärsä quali fication is repeated for father and son, like "Sultan b. Sultan", it must point to a title that was not automati cally transferable to sons; to one perhaps, but not all. The modern use of the word pârsâ ("pious man"), and a fourteenth-century reference by Hamdallâh Mustawfî to nocturnal ceremonies held by non-Muslim priests qualified as pârsâ, vouches for a religious function.44 Despite several attempts, I had no further insight into the word until I revisited Lecoq's seminal work on Achaemenid inscriptions. As Lecoq explains it, pärsava and parthava were the Median and Persian dialectical pronunciations of the same ethnic desig nation and were words that eventually produced MP 42 Soudavar 2010a: 128—33. « Soudavar 2010a: 133-34. 44 Soudavar 2009: 434. Fig. 20. Qizqapan (V. Curtis 2010). pahlav and the NP pahlu ("side").45 From the latter, he extrapolated a meaning attached to the far side ("those from the frontier lands"). I believe that he went slightly too far, as pahlu implies the near side rather than a far one.46 With that in mind, the pointer to its true meaning comes from the imagery. On their tomb façades, Darius and Xerxes who both claim to be "pärsä son of pärsä", depict them selves bow in hand and facing a fire altar (Fig. 19). It is obviously not the representation of a pre-death ritual but an explanation before Ahurä Mazdâ of the most important function that they held during their lifetime. Since they are facing a fire altar, the close ness implied by the word pärsä must be in relation to the fire altar. And whereas Mustawfi emphasised the nocturnal aspect of the ceremonies, the moon symbol above the fire altar may indeed indicate that the fire ceremonies presided over by the pärsä were also held at night time.47 In Qizqapan, we have a rendering of "pärsä son of pärsä" as two princes, one young and the other older, who stand bow in hand by a fire altar (Fig. 20). A simi lar composition appears on a number of seals.48 Con 45 Lecoq 1997: 146. 46 Tremblay (1998: 191) expresses doubt whether *parsu- (as the root of parthava) could be extended to "frontier peo ple". Also, there are a number of terms in the Iranian lan guages that provide a meaning of "frontier person" such as marzbän or karän-pä; another term was really unnecessary. 47 Since the emblem above the fire altar combines a globe with a crescent, it is possible that it alludes to bi-monthly ceremonies held at the beginning of the lunar month (cres cent) and the middle of the month (globe = full moon). 48 For instance, on seals from Anatolia (Facella 2009: 406),</page><page sequence="13">Fig. 21. Artaxerxes II's tomb: detail of lotus and sunflower as symbols of Mithra and Anahita. sequently, Herodotus' remark (1.125) about the Persian tribes "and of these the Pasargadai are the most noble, of whom also the Achaimenidai are a clan", is quite rev elatory. As Lecoq observed, Pasargadai is the "Greek rendering of Pärsä-gird" (or rather Pärsä-kadag), the city or dwelling of the Pärsäs.49 Herodotus therefore seems to confound the name of the dwelling with the name of the cast of pärsäs. This minor mistake not withstanding, his statement, about the Achaemenids belonging to the same cast, tallies well with Darius' boast that he was pärsä son of pärsä. The eponymous founder of the dynasty, Achaemenes, must have been a pärsä, whose function was eventually transmitted to Darius through a lineage that he claimed to represent the paramount branch of the Achaemenids (see below, section XV).50 To this paramount branch Cyrus did not belong. Therefore, Darius' hereditary function of pärsä is what differentiated him from Cyrus. His right to rule and legitimacy were based on this inheritance. In bringing back kingship to his own lineage, he was rehabilitating the Pärsä line of the Achaemenids.51 Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris (Kuhrt2010, 2: 561), or from Persepolis (Garrison 2010: 384, fig. 32a). 49 Lecoq 1997: 146. Anaximenes of Lampsakos (fourth cen tury BC) also relates that the name of Cyrus's capital meant "encampment of the Persians", Stronach and Gopnick 2009. 50 Certain offices seem to have been transmitted from father to son, like the guardianship of Cyrus's tomb as reported by Arrian; see Panaino 2010: 111. 51 Vallat astutely notes that when Darius claims that eight kings of his "family" ruled, he uses the word numun. But when talking about his lineage to whom belong Achae menes, Teispes, Ariaramnes and Arsames, he uses the word eippi ("lineage"); Vallat 2011: 274—75. The image of the pärsä on the reliefs seems to be that of a presiding officer and/or keeper of the fire. As such, the fire in his custody must have been the main fire to which were affiliated a group of Iranians known as Persians. Significantly, the kings of Persis who sought to continue the Achaemenid traditions represent themselves bow in hand and next to an edi fice that supposedly harboured the same fire (Figs. 22, 23).52 As Vesta Curtis has noted, some coin inscrip tions from Persis even incorporate the letters br prs ("son of pärsä").53 But if the Persis kings tried to emulate their Achaemenid predecessors, they would probably have used Darius' motto in its entirety, for it is a constant feature of Iranian history that lofty titles, claims and slogans get debased with time and are then used by lesser rulers who do not merit them. I therefore suggest that, while the scene to the left of the fire building establishes the pärsä claim of the Persis ruler, the standard to the right projects Arya ciça or the claim to be empowered by the Aryan khvarenah. The said standard, which is similar in shape to the one that the army of Darius III (r. 336-330 BC) carries in the famous mosaic battle scene of the Naples Museum,54 and to the Persepolis tile of Figure 24, was probably a replica of the main Achaemenid standard and one that embodied the Aryan khvarenah. This contention is justified by the presence of a bird, the vareyna, on top of the standard in some Persis coins (Fig. 23).55 52 For a detailed analysis of these fire edifices, see Haerinck and Overlaet 2008. 53 Curtis 2010: 392-95. 54 See e.g. Briant 1996: 241. 55 It is not beyond the realm of imagination to think that the</page><page sequence="14">58 ABOLALA SOUDAVAR Fig. 22. Autophradates I by fire-temple with Ahura Mazdä above. Fig. 23. Vadfradad II, Ahura Mazdä and symbol of Arya ciça. Fig. 24. Reconstructed square tile (courtesy of S. Razmjou). Fig. 25. Shapur I and Ahura Mazda flanking a fire altar. The presence of the bird vareyna signalled that the khvarenah still resided with the standard. The question then is, if the Sasanians also placed a fire altar on the reverse of their coinage and appeared themselves on its left side (Fig. 25),56 why did they not continue the practice of the Persis kings of claiming the Aryan ciça or khvarenah? This is because, in the meantime, orthodox Zoroastrian priests had allocated the Aryan khvarenah to Zoroaster (Yts 19:57, 5:42), and it was therefore no more available to kings. As I have argued elsewhere, this must have necessarily occurred after the demise of the Achaemenids, as no priest would have dared to do so while the King of Kings still ruled the Achaemenid Empire.57 The disap pearance of the standard on coinage may be in fact an indicator for when this shift in khvarenah allocation occurred. Like the Shi'ite clergy who in Islamic terms ben efited from the demise of the Safavids and the chaotic situation of eighteenth-century Iran to establish their ascendancy, the Zoroastrian magi must have profited from the upheavals that afflicted the Iranian lands in the wake of Alexander's conquest to strengthen their religion and to empower their Prophet at the expense of kingship. The Sasanians, who tried to conform to the newly-strengthened Zoroastrianism, had to use a differ ent slogan. Hence the famous cihr as yazatân that still square tile of Persepolis (Fig. 24), with a vareyna bird that holds two pearls in its talons, whose wings mimic the winged-disk design of the khvarenah and is surrounded by light rays, reflected the Achaemenid standard. The bird on top of the standard on Persis coins was thus a reminder of the former insignia. 56 Soudavar 2009: 419-23. 57 Soudavar 2010a: 130—31. made use of the word ciça/cihr but, instead of claiming the khvarenah of the Aryan people, proclaimed empow erment through the support of the gods. IX. ARDASHIR-KHWARRAH The Nâma-yi Tansar, which extols the virtues of Ardashir I (r. AD 226-42) relates that: "after Därä, the Parthians each made a fire temple for themselves, without consideration for [the rites established by] previous kings; the Shähanshäh (i.e. Ardashir) elimi nated them, captured their fires and returned them to their original site".58 It acknowledges that, in placing a fire altar on the reverse of his coins, Ardashir was following a tradition established by the Achaemenids and was re-igniting the fire that the Parthians had dis persed. The History of al-Ya'qübT further confirms that Ardashir built a "fire temple" in Ardashir-khwarrah.59 Moreover, in the same way that Pasargadae was used for the enthronement of Achaemenid kings, the fire temple of Ardashir-khwarrah was where Sasanians were supposed to be consecrated as kings. Al-TabarT recounts that, when the Sasanian generals wanted to put the young Yazdagird III (r. 632-51) on the throne, they took him to the fire temple of Ardashir and crowned him there.60 In his detailed study of FTrüzäbäd (formerly Ardashir-khwarrah), Dietrich Huff suggests that the fire temple mentioned by the sources must be the off centre building, with four ayväns and a central brick 58 Minovi 1966: 68. 59 al-Ya'qübl 1992, 1: 192. m al-Tabarl 1996,2: 785.</page><page sequence="15">Fig. 26. Circular layout of Aradashir-khwarrah with irrigational canals (Huff 1993, with his kind permission) dome, known as the Takht-nishTn.61 I beg to differ and suggest that said fire edifice referred instead to the tower structure placed at the very centre of the circular city of Ardashir-khwarrah that he built (Fig. 26), the reason being that the purpose of the fire edi fice was not to worship fire therein but to proclaim, in a most blazing way, the acquired khvarenah of Arda shir. If the city was called Ardashir-khwarrah, the imposing tower at its very centre must have been the very embodiment of that khvarenah. In three succes sive passages, the Kärnämag provides some insight about Ardashir's preoccupation with this notion: (a) he hopes that the khwarrah of Iränshahr will help him; (b) he then obtains the Kiyänian khwarrah, and (c) his Kiyänian khwarrah rises from the waters.62 Based on information provided by Ibn al-Balkhï and al-Istakhrl, and as Huff explains, Ardashir-khwarrah was actually built on marshlands partially covered by water.63 As a result, water had to be constantly drained through canals.64 On the other hand, the structure that Huff proposes for this tower shows a staircase on the inner contour leading to the top (Fig. 27). In other words, the tower was built to have fire, as symbol of the king's khvarenah, shining from its top, and accessed by the inner staircase. It symbol ised the emergence of the khvarenah from the waters 61 Huff 1999. 62 Grenet2003: 66, 77, 87. «3 Ibn al-BalkhT 1968: 137; al-Istakhrl 1994: 110. 64 Huff 2008a: 50-51. Fig. 27. Suggested structure of the Fire Tower at the centre ofArdashir-khwarrah (Fluff1993, with his kind permission). (the very image that George Dumézil once quali fied as "fire rising from waters"), which alluded to the release of the khvarenah that Apam Napät had guarded under water.65 Whereas the pärsäs of old were the keepers of the fire that they perhaps thought to represent the khvar enah of the Aryan nation, the Sasanians seem to have had an ambivalent attitude toward their own dynas tic fire. The switch of terminology in the Kärnämag is quite revelatory. Ardashir aims for the ultimate khvarenah, the khwarrah of Iränshahr (i.e. the Aryan khvarenah), but settles for the Kiyänian one, although in effect they are one and the same because, if it must rise from the waters, it must be precisely the one that JamshTd had lost and was then guarded by Apam Napät under water. The subsequent pivotal role that Apam Napät plays in the rock reliefs of Shäpür I and his progeny only confirms the Sasanians' implicit and systematic reference to the possession of the Aryan khvarenah, especially for those who had vanquished a foreign enemy.66 The allocation of the Aryan khvare nah to Zoroaster necessitated the invention of a similar one for kings, hence the Kiyänian one. In order not to offend Zoroastrian orthodoxy, the Sasanians may have referred to their khvarenah as Kiyänian although it had all the attributes of the Aryan one. 65 Kellens 2010-11: Cours 5. For Apam Napat's link to fire see also Gnoli 1987: 4535. 66 Soudavar 2006b: 174-75; Soudavar 2012: 5—8; see also Fig. 1 here.</page><page sequence="16">60 ABOLALA SOUDAVA] If Ardashir was consciously re-establishing the pärsä tradition of a centrai dynastie fire, the use of the Word cihr in his slogan was also deliberate and followed the same tradition. The équivalence of light and khvarenah was never lost in the Persian tradi tion, and that is why the celebrated thirteenth-century geographer Yäqöt alHamawi explains that Ardashir khwarrah meant "light of Ardashir".67 Ardashir had in fact asserted his possession of the khvarenah through the radiance (cihr) of his fire in Ardashirkhwanah. Furthermore, the series of odd terms that have corne down to us through copies of geographical manu scripts in reference to this fire tower clearly show con fusion about the association of its fire with a particular khvarenah. Indeed, Ibn al-Balkln and allstakhrl State that the Arabs called it tirbal (i.e. "tall structure"), but the Persians called it Iran khwarrah according to the former, and Iran or Kiyd khwarrah according to the latter.68 Clearly, while the Arabs referred to it by its appearance, the Persians were referring to it by what it stood for, i.e. a tower that projected the ultimate khvar enah, characterised as either Iranian or Kiyanian.69 By simultaneously referring to it as Iranian and Kiyanian khwarrah, allstakhrl shows how the two notions were équivalent in the Persian mind. Moreover, the numer ous fire temples that an early Persian translation of Istakhn qualifies as bihkhwarrah ("of good khwar 7ة Yaqut 1995: 146; اردشبرخوره، هو اسم،ركب معناه بهاء أردقير ؛؛&lt;؛ Ibn alBalkhi 1968: 138 (ايران كريم); allstakhn 1961: 76, (و هو بناء بناة اردشير و يعرف بنان الفرس بايوان و كياحره). It is clear that in one of the extant texts the scribe miswrote the Word khwarrah as gardeh, and in the other the Word Iran as ayvärt. What the Arabs called a tirbal or tower-like struc ture, Persians could not call ayvan as it would have implied a vaulted structure. Also, another text, the Shiräz-nämü, refers to it as the "Iran Column"; Ibn alBalkhi 1995: 335. 69 There is an enigmatic sentence following Ibn-i Balkhfs description of the tower structure, and the water that was brought from afar to emerge as a fountain on its top (Ibn-i Balkhi 1968: 138): "and there are two ghadlrs (water recipients), one named Young Barm, and the other Old Barm, and on each ghadlr, a fire altar". It describes two water recipients that capture the water of the fountain and emit light through their fires; and the Young and Old des ignations therein, may relate to a Qizpaqanlike image as well as the "pärsä son 0Ï pärsä" legend, by which father and son, each stood by their own fire. More importantly, it would emphasise once again the idea of fire springing from water (note: the published text has Bäm in lieu of Barm; I am indebted to F. Päkzäd for explaining that, like ghadir, barm meant water recipient and the text had to be corrected accordingly). raÄ"), confirms the direct association that Persians envisaged between fire, light and khvarenah.10 In stark opposition to the amnesia theory advanced by P.O. Skjaervo that the Sasanians had no clue as to what ciça meant for Darius and therefore created a meaning of their own for cihr,71 we can now see that Ardashir was fully aware ofthe implications of Darius' slogan and had to alter it because of newlydeveloped concepts within Zoroastrianism. His own version of kingly Propaganda, however, incorporated the basic tenets ofthe Achaemenid kingly ideology. Darius had asserted (DSf 8-22) that Ahura Mazda chose him as "a man" to be his deputy on earth, and so did the kings of Persis who styled themselves as frataraka (i.e. depu ties) of gods.72 In proclaiming that they obtained their cihr/khvarenah from gods, the Sasanian were still mortals who claimed to reign by the power that gods conferred to them. X. PERSONAL FIRE vs. FIRE TEMPLE The différence between the motifs used in Cyrus's tomb and those for Darius and his progeny is quite telling. Whereas the latter, in keeping with their pärsä title, portray themselves next to the fire altar, Cyrus' tomb only displays a lotus and sunflower emblem as symbols of Mithra and Apam Napat.73 On the other hand, on the tomb of Artaxerxes II (r. 405-359 BC) above Persepolis, we can see that, in addition to the traditional design of Naqsh-i Rustam tombs, we have a frieze of lions converging toward a Symbol combining again the lotus and sunflower (Fig. 21).74 As the ruler who, despite his belief in Ahura Mazda, sought the protection of Mithra and the aquatic deity Anahita (in lieu of Apam Napat), it was only natural 70 allstakhrl 1994: 105. 71 Skjaervo 2007: 34-37.1 have criticised this amnesia theory in Soudavar 2009: 442-50. 72 Soudavar 2006b: 163-64; Soudavar 2009: 422. 73 Soudavar 2003: 88; Stronach 1971: 156-57. 74 The assignment ofthe two tombs above Persepolis has been done arbitrarily. Rather than accepting the traditional view that the closest tomb belongs to Artaxerxes III, I believe the opposite to be true. It not only makes sense for the elder (Artaxerxes II) to be closest and right above Persepolis, but its joint Symbol of lotus and sunflower also relates to a king who invokes the solar and aquatic deities, Mithra and Anahita; a similar frieze on the tomb of Artatxerxes III, who invokes only Mithra, contains only a row of lions sym bolising the sun, daylight and Mithra.</page><page sequence="17">ASTYAGES, CYRUS AND ZOROASTER 61 for him to reintroduce design elements that evoked these deities. More importantly, the fire altars depicted on the tombs of Darius and his successors rest on a platform throne that has recently been convincingly argued to represent the transportable version of the Achaemenid throne, lifted by men and guided by "pilots" on its four corners.75 As such, the fact that the fire altar stands on it, along with the king, indicates perhaps that this fire was to accompany the king in his movements. Con versely, the fire in the Ka'ba, a building referred to as bun-khanak (lit. "fundamental house") by Kirdir,76 was the fundamental one from which all other fires were derived. The fire altars depicted on the verso of Sasanian coins, which are similar in design to the ones before the king on the Naqsh-i Rustam tombs, must have had a similar function. And since their fire was named after the king (e.g. "Fire of Ardashir" for those on the reverse of Ardashir I coins),77 we can assume that the Achaeme nid ones too represented the king's personal fire, were named after him and were extinguished after his death as reported by Diodorus of Sicily.78 XI. PASARGADAE REHABILITATED Proponents of the "Liar Darius" theory have found much support in the flawed art-historical analysis of Pasargadae. Conjecturing that the Old Persian cunei form script was invented by Darius—a view now rebuked by Vallat79—they were ready to accept any convoluted argument that would suggest that both the reliefs and the inscriptions, which tied Cyrus to Achae menes, were planted by Darius as misinformation. And so, one flawed argument bounced on another to describe Pasargadae as a monument of deceit. The theory now finds its consecration with the "Pasargadae" entry by Stronach and Gopnik in Encyclopaedia Iranica?0 75 Saidi 2010: 79-86. 76 Von Gall 2009. 77 Gyselen 2003: 132. 78 Shahbazi 1993. 79 Vallat demonstrates that the combination of the Elamite verb hutta- ("to do") and the directional ikki ("towards") should be understood as "to translate". Therefore in DBa, Darius was stating that what he first wrote in Elamite was translated differently in OP, and carved in an adjacent empty location, rather than that he wrote it in "a new script" that did not exist before; Vallat 2010: 59. 80 Stronach and Gropnik 2009. At the root of the problem is art historians' ten dency to rely on the "famous and familiar" as authen tic and the "unfamiliar but resembling items" as cop ies or forgeries. In a recent study of mediaeval paint ing, I have noticed the same: a readiness to discard the magnificent altar piece of the Prado Museum, The Fountain of Grace, as a copy of the famous and more familiar Ghent Altarpiece by Jan Van Eyck, despite all evidence to the contrary.81 Nobody bothered to investigate the reverse possibility: that if we have similarities, the familiar can be a copy of the unfa miliar. The same is true for Pasargadae. Stronach and Gopnick posit: (a) "that the stacked folds of the Persian robe depended on certain formal refinements in the rendering of drapery in Greece that only came into existence 'about 540 and later'"; and (b) "that the Palace P reliefs could logically post-date only the pioneer representations of Persian dress in the Bisutun relief of c. 520". Because Darius' monuments are more abundant and thus more familiar, Darius is seen as the originator of the Achaemenid style, a belief reinforced in turn by the wrong assumption that he was the originator of the Old Persian script. At the very least, my comparison of Mithra's crown in Pasargadae with the Persepolis panel (Figs. 2,7) now proves that Darius did not invent these all by himself but copied Cyrus in certain instances. Similarly, the familiarity with Greek sources has cre ated a Greco-centric vision of art history that cannot conceive the possibility of Greeks being inspired from Iranian traditions, even though one of the Seven Won ders of the World, the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, is basically conceived after an Iranian tomb model. As Dietrich Huff has demonstrated, the palace tradition in Iran follows a continuous style, the principles of which are evident in the pre-Achaemenid era as well as in the Safavid and Qäjär eras.82 These arguments also show a fundamental una wareness about the richness of the Median artistic tradition, as items from the Kalmäkara grotto tend to show. By disregarding "illegally" excavated mate rial, archaeologists are shooting themselves in the foot, since these grotto objects show an aesthetic sensitivity and technical ability, far surpassing the standardised format of Achaemenid art works.83 With si Soudavar 2008: 95-109. 82 Huff 2008b; Huff 2010. 83 Those that I have published (Soudavar 2003: figs. 79, 81, 83), together with items from the Miho Museum, auction</page><page sequence="18">62 ABOLALA SOUDAVAR Fig. 28.

Naqsh-i Rustam. such a strong Median tradition at hand, why would Cyrus need to emulate the Greeks?84 And why would not Cyrus' conquest of Asia Minor be the reason for changes in the Greek style at "about 540 and later"? On the other hand, as noted by Margaret Root, "not a shred of Attic pottery has been discovered at the entire site" of Persepolis to suggest a Persian infatu ation with Greeks in that period.85 If Persians wanted to emulate a certain monumental style, Babylon and Assyria were the empires that counted, not the Greek city states. Whereas Stronach and Gopnick assert that the Pasargadae style is "reminiscent of the Greek ten dency to treat stone forms as organic, as well as the naturalistic rendering of human feet", the feet in Fig ures 10, 28, 29 are clearly not "naturalistic", but as houses and art dealers, show incredible creativity and work manship. 84 Similar to Akhenaten's monuments that were dismantled and re-used in later Egyptian works, material from the Median palaces was possibly re-used in Achaemenid monu ments. See e.g. the slabs (Curtis and Tallis 2005: 96, cat. no. 79), for which Herzfeld had proposed that they were perhaps positioned under the pivot-stones of doors, an idea rejected by Curtis and Tallis. These "square" slabs found in Persepolis, for which neither use nor location can be deter mined, may be of Median origin. For the petals of their sunflower are—unlike all others in Persepolis—of convex shape, and they have been re-sized and are no more square. 85 Root 1979: 41 —42. stylised as any other Iranian sculpture and certainly less "naturalistic" than those of the neo-Babylonian seal of Figure 11. A fundamental point to establish "forgery" is to find who the interlocutor was. How could have Darius carved his presumed forgery on such an inconspicuous place (Fig. 28) as on the border of the stacked folds of a robe, and for whom? Also, as the comparison of the two sides of the door jamb may quickly show (Figs. 28, 29), the one with the inscription is finely carved but has numerous repairs, and the one opposite is cruder in execution and has no inscription. Traditionally, the two sides are mirror reflections of each other, and since they are not thus here, one is original and the other a replacement. But it is very dif ficult to decide which one of the two is the older. Nor mally, the one with inscriptions should be the original, because of its numerous repairs, and the cruder one, a replacement; especially since the other door jambs (on the opposite end) also display the refined style. Either way, the existence of the two styles side-by-side shows how tenuous stylistic arguments can be. More important, since the building surfaces were supposed to be all carved and/or painted, why would Cyrus leave so many empty places for Darius to fill with inscriptions? At first sight, a CMa inscription that reads: I, Cyrus, Achaemenid King, over the now iso lated symbol of Mithra (Fig. 8a), may seem to claim</page><page sequence="19">/ $pj Fig. 31. Repeated inscriptions of Shilhak-Inshushinak on baked bricks. Twelfth century BC. Louvre Museum. godly status for the king. But such a claim does not make sense in the Iranian context. Darius, for instance, insisted that he was a man here on earth {DSf 8-22). With the intention to prove the CMa inscriptions as later additions, one can always produce imaginary scenarios, but in the absence of a technical proof to the contrary one must consider them as authentic. As a matter of fact, two arguments support such an out look. First, if Cyrus gathered the pärsäs in Pasargadae/ Pärsä-kadag, it made sense to remind them that he was a great-grandson of the Achaemenes who initiated this institution. Building this site did not mean that he adhered to the practices of the pârsâs but that he showed his respect for the beliefs of his kinsmen, sim ilar to the respect that he showed for the practitioners of other religions. Second, the formula that Cyrus uses recalls the one in Elamite inscriptions of the twelfth century BC, carved on an elaborate baked brick edifice now in the Louvre (Fig. 31): I, Shilhak-Inshushinak, son of Shutruk-Nahhunte, king of Anshän and Susa. Kutir Nahhunte had had made figures in baked brick and had decided "I shall erect them in the temple of Inshushinak" but could not do it since he died before [achieving it]. I, placed [on the throne], I completed the exterior chapel by having supplemental brick figures made. I dedicated it to my god, Inshushinak. May the work that I have done be agreeable as an offering! 86 Clearly, because the inscription is repeated on every chimera and palm tree, its main purpose is to advertise the name of the founder of the edifice. If Shilhak-Inshushinak had built the entire chapel him self, there would have been no other lines after the first one. Therefore, the CMa inscription is more akin to Shilhak-Inshushinak's first line with no other infor mation to follow, for it was Cyrus' own building. The repeat pattern of the CMa inscription, on a number of columns (totalling perhaps thirty)87 as well as on the border of a robe, imitates the repeat pattern used by Shilhak-Inshushinak. It was the Elamite way to desig 86 Malbran-Labat 1996: no. 4. I am most indebted to Gian Pietro Basello, who pointed out to me the existence of these inscriptions and provided their full text and reference. 87 Lecoq 1997: 80.</page><page sequence="20">64 ABOLALA SOUDAVAR nate the founder of the edifice, without any intention of identifying nearby figures. They inscribed it on as many places as they could. Obviously, the name of Shilhak-Inshushinak appearing on the bull chimera, as well as palm trees, was not meant to represent either of them! By the same token, the CMa above Mithra was just one of many inscriptions designed to tell the visi tors who the founder was. It bore no direct relationship to the figure of Mithra. The repeat pattern of the CMa inscriptions there fore vouches for an Elamite tradition, unfamiliar to Darius, or at least not to his liking. If the assumption is that he forged these inscriptions to advertise a fake common ancestry with Cyrus, he would have done the same in Persepolis and elsewhere by writing the name of Achaemenes on every column and door jamb. He did not. In any case, it is the word pärsä that explains the raison d'être of Pasargadae. Since it was the home of the parsâs, the Zindän monument, which is in the shape of the fire temples of the Persis kings as well as that of Ardashir-kwarrah' must have been the focal point of Pasargadae. It also gives added credence to Xenophon's assertion (Cyr. 8.1.23) that "for the first time the college of magi was instituted" under Cyrus. By its very name, Pasargadae was created to harbour this college of the magi (who were actually pärsä s). But given Darius' animosity toward its predecessor and what he perceived as usurpation of a privilege that belonged to his own lineage, he must have decided to move the sacred fire of the Persians elsewhere, most probably to the Ka'ba of Zardusht in Naqsh-i Rustam. Indeed, the fact that the tomb façades of Darius and his successors depict them as fire officers vouchsafes the fact that the Ka'ba, down below, was where they exercised their function. And the last of these tombs, the one usually ascribed to Darius II (r. 423-405 BC), is strictly aligned with the axis of the Ka'ba in order to emphasise this relationship (Fig. 30). Thereafter, the Zindän must have fallen in desuetude, and perhaps that is why Cyrus' tomb became the focal point of cer emonial activities in Pasargadae. XII. PÄRSÄ IN ROMAN MITHRAIC SOCIETIES Among the many misconceptions that have afflicted Iranian studies in the past quarter of a century is the idea that Roman Mithraic societies were home-grown and bore no relationship to Iranian beliefs or practices. The separation of the two is to the detriment of both, because it obstructs the possibility of each benefiting from the other. For instance, the names of two grade holders, Heliodromos (sixth grade) and Perses (fifth grade), have remained a mystery because they can not be explained within the Roman context. As I shall argue in my forthcoming book, Heliodromos is the Greek translation, or counterpart, of the Iranian rank of Mihr-astät—the one who stood by Mithra's chariot, and who was responsible to relay his messages.88 The latter part of this name has given us NP ustäd ("mas ter"), and the word astandes in Greek,89 which by no mere coincidence, is translated as "courier", "runner" or "messenger", the same words used to describe Heli odromos. Be that as it may, our interpretation of the word pârsà as "fire keeper" can now explain Perses in the Roman context: he was the officer in charge of the fire and one below Heliodromos who was closest to the Pater/Papa.90 For the Greeks, as for us today, pârsà naturally meant Persian: hence the appellation Perses. XIII. REWRITING HISTORY A logical construct is a powerful argument. Taqizadeh, Henning, Gershevitch and Gnoli, had all perceived the value of the logical construct based on the "258 axiom", which explained the otherwise unexplainable aspect of the Zoroastrian historical record that reduced the Parthian period by 266 years (see Table 2).91 To counter this argument, Jean Kellens questioned the reliability of a number derived from texts that pro duced unrealistic reign periods of a hundred years and beyond.92 I believe that a more pertinent question is: how could learned priests produce these numbers, when it was evident to all that life cannot be stretched that far? The answer is that the priests who wrote it were not pursuing historical veracity but were trying to produce religious propaganda, by aggrandising friends 88 Soudavar forthcoming. 89 According to Plutarch, Alexander berated Darius III as one who had been the slave (probably a translation of bandaka) and courier (astandes) of Artaxerxes III, Lenfant 2009: 326. 90 The three highest Roman grades have counterparts in the Iranian avatars of Mithraic societies: bâbâ/pïr (pater) as head of Sufi sects, ustâd (heliodromos) as head of guilds and pahlavän (perses) as head of wrestling societies. 91 Soudavar 2010a: 116. 92 Kellens 2001: 177.</page><page sequence="21">ASTYAGES, CYRUS AND ZOROASTER 65 and seeking damnatio memoriae for their enemies.93 In so doing, they also had to contend with two types of time brackets already engrained in the Zoroastrian mythology. The first was the millenary division of Creation into four three-thousand years periods, and the second was the "258 axiom" that fixed the elapsed time between Zoroaster and Alexander. Our analysis of their texts given below will open a vista into their modus operandi, and will provide much support for the theories that we have proposed. XIII. 1. The Bimdahishn regnal list For the 258 years' time bracket, the Bundahishn (XXXVI, 8) gives the following regnal years: Kay Gushtäsp, 120 years (thirty years of which were prior to Zoroaster); Bahman son of Isfandyär, 112 years; Humäy-i Bahman-dukht, thirty years; Därä-yi chihr äzädän ("who is Bahman"), twelve years; Därä-yi Däräyän, fourteen years.94 As expected, neither Cyrus nor Astyages appear in there. Perceived as enemies of the Religion, they were deleted, along with all their ancestors. Also to be expected is the disappearance of the Artaxerxeses because they reintroduced Mithra into the Achaemenid pantheon. The presence of Darius III (r. 336-330 BC) as Därä-yi Däräyän, irrespective of his religious beliefs, was necessary, since Alexan der needed to have an adversary from whom he would wrest the Persian throne. Also well known was the fact that, besides Darius III, there were other Dariuses. Thus another Darius therein is Därä-yi chihr-äzädan, who is immediately re-identified as Bahman, i.e. the one who reigned after Gushtäsp (Vishtäspa). Presum ably, they both refer to Darius I, who is split in two because there were two other Dariuses before the last one. Bahman (Vohuman), however, is not a name but a qualifying adjective meaning "of good thought". It fits the facts as we know them; Darius worshipped Ahura Mazdä but did not profess to be a Zoroastrian, nor did he ever mention the Prophet's name. He is thus a man "of good thought" and not an enemy of the Religion. Interestingly, Darius' name is followed by "chihr äzäd-än" the last two letters of which could be inter preted in two ways. First, as an affiliation suffix giving "Darius son of chihr-äzäd", a translation accepted by 93 A similar view, but milder in scope, is expressed in Yar shater 1983: 395. 94 Dàdâgî 1990: 156. many.95 Second, as an adjective indicator, making "chihr-äzäd" an epithet of Darius. The latter must be the correct one, for we know no such a person, and this is what al-Tabarl and other early Islamic historians of Iranian descent understood.96 We can then immedi ately guess that it must have some connection with the Arya ciça that Darius had introduced and was subse quently adopted by his successors. As the originator of this slogan, he was marked by it to the extent that it became his epithet: chihr-Äryä. The question then is, why did it get transformed into chihr-äzäd? In a recent article, H.P. Frankfort and X. Tremblay explain a recurring pattern of name changes that are phonetically similar and have a common link. In Paris, for instance, "rue aux Oues" (an archaic pronuncia tion of Oies, i.e. geese) was transformed into the more comprehensible "rue aux Ours" (bears). A similar pat tern can be seen in the name changes affecting Tehran in the wake of the 1979 Islamic Revolution.97 I sug gest that the change from chihr-Äryä to chihr-äzäd followed the same model. Hampered by the assign ment of the Aryan khvarenah to Zoroaster, the epithet that marked Darius had to be changed: chihr-äzäd ("of noble khvarenah and brilliance") was invented as the phonetically closest and yet meaningful substitute. Of all the Achaemenid clan members, the only one who paid any attention to Zoroaster must have been Darius' father, Vishtäspa. But he was not a king, and to aggrandise Zoroaster he had to be turned into a great king. Thus the reign of Vishtäspa in these texts is an amalgam of many persons, including Cyrus and Cam byses on the lower side and some of Darius' forefa thers on the upper side. Nonetheless, some additional information that trickled down into chronicles, cor roborates the fact that Vishtäspa and Zoroaster were contemporaries. Al-Mas'üdT, for instance, states that 95 See for instance J.H. Peterson's translation in http://www. avesta. org/mp/grb. htm. 96 al-Tabarl 1996,2: 488 (&lt;ü!j Jlj'jfr? &lt;£). A similar epi thet, shahr-âzâd, is given for KhumânT (al-Tabarï 1996, 2: 483), which may be the Arabicised version of Darius's epi thet, and may indicate a relationship between Darius and KhumânT. 97 Frankfort and Tremblay 2010: 89. In post-Revolution Tehran, Valï-yi 'ahd ("Crown prince") square was changed into the Valï-yi 'asr ("the Mahdi") square. Soraya (Thoraya) street was changed to Somayya (both women, with a name starting with an S sound), but Takht-i Jamshid avenue was changed to Taliqanï, only on account of the T sound at the beginning.</page><page sequence="22">66 ABOLALA SOUDAVAR the father of Vishtäspa, i.e. Luhräsp, was a contem porary of Nebuchadnezzar II.98 It lacks precision but situates more or less Vishtäspa in c. 550 BC. As for al-BTrünl, he tabulates the kings of Iran from Gayu marth up to Vishtäspa, in the middle of whose reign he specifies that Zoroaster appeared, and thereafter counts 258 years until the year in which Alexander killed Darius III." The most problematic aspect of the tabulated names is the fact that Bahman (alias Darius) is presented as the grandson, and not the son, of Vishtäspa. But as the change in Darius' epithet may suggest, the compilers of these tables were not without humour. In the Shäh näma, the presumed father of Bahman, Isfandyär, is the hero who longed to become king but was sent eastward to fight the presumed rebellion of Rustam; he died in battle and therefore never reigned. In a way, it parallels the fate of the historical Vishtäspa, father of Darius, who was never king, but was sent eastward to quell a rebellion. It may be that in making a mighty king out of Vishtäspa, the compilers saw the neces sity to recreate a father, who never reigned, for Darius. Hence Isfandyär, who is presented as Bahman's father but has no regnal years allocated to him. The question then is: where did the name Isfandyär come from? A similar name is set forth by Ctesias in relation to the story of the usurpation of the throne by the Magus Gaumäta prior to Darius' ascent to power.100 Cambyses (r. 559-530 BC) had killed his brother Bardiya, before or while campaigning in Egypt, and a magus declaring himself to be the latter seized the throne and ruled for a while.101 Ctesias mentions that Sphendadates was the name of the usurper magus, whose Avestan counter part is SpantöSäta ("created by the holy"), itself a fore runner of Isfandyär. Whether it was his regnal name when ruling in lieu of Bardiya or the latter's epithet does not matter. This is the name by which the usurper who should not have ruled is remembered. The name of the one "who should not have ruled" was ironically transposed on the one "who never ruled". In full circle, we are back to Darius' account, which in essence concords with Ctesias' account, as he talks about one usurper only, whereas Herodotus introduces 98 al-Mas'üdi 1962,1:202 99 al-Birünl 1998: 148. 100 Ctesias (Books 12, 13,14 as per Photius). 101 Aeschylus (Persians 770—75fï) names the usurper as Mar dus, who "came to power, a disgrace to his native land and to the ancient throne". a second persona by the name of Patizeites as brother of the magus. As has been suggested, patizeites is the Greek rendering of OP pati-xshäyaOiya, i.e. viceroy or regent, and is most probably a title that the magus held but that Herodotus mistook as representing a sec ond person.102 To usurp the throne, the magus must have held the highest rank in the absence of Cam byses, a rank akin to regency; otherwise the actual regent would have prevented the magus from taking power. Ctesias alludes to an ongoing feud between the magus and Bardiya, whom he names Tanyoxarces (OP *tanu-wazraka "large bodied"). His name ties in with Herodotus' account of Bardiya who displayed much strength when pulling an exceptionally heavy Ethio pian bow.103 It then stands to reason to cast the magus' usurpation within the broader context of the compet ing interests of the Median magi and the pärsäs, with Cambyses siding with the former and Bardiya sym pathising with the latter. To judge by the Magophonia reaction, the competition between the two groups must have been highly antagonistic. If we then consider Sphendadates to be a title or epithet of the real Bardiya that the magus usurped as well, we may have a good reason to see Isfandyär's name within the Zoroastrian chronology tables; he was a supporter of the pärsä clan who believed in the supremacy of Ahura Mazdâ, and therefore, as the Pahlavi books confirm, a supporter of the Religion.104 XIII.2. The enigmatic queen Humäy An enigmatic name within the Bundahishn chrono logical tables, Humäy-i Bahman-dukht, i.e. Humäy daughter of Bahman (alias Darius), needs elaboration. For the name Humäy, which is rendered as Amytis in Greek (from OP *Umati, equivalent to Avestan humaiti, "having good thought") is a major source of confusion as it can refer to four different women (Table 1). 102 Shayegan 2010, favours the "two usurpers" account and contends that "it is doubtful that regency could be entrusted to a magus, for one of its purposes was to assure the suc cession to the throne". Unfortunately, this is an assertion without basis. The Seljuqs, for instance, nominated as viceroys and regents atâbaks who were usually not related to the royal family; the Safavids used ghuläms; and the Il-Khänids appointed warlords. 103 Herodotus (III. 10); Dandamayev 1989. i°4 Yarshater 1983: 469.</page><page sequence="23">ASTYAGES, CYRUS AND ZOROASTER 67 TABLE 1.

This commander Otanes (2) is obviously not the elderly statesman Otanes (1), who led the conspiracy against Gaumata, was a contender for the throne and obtained Privileges that no other Persian had (Her. 111.83). If Herodotus' sentence is not clear, it is because this Otanes (2) was the son of one Amestris and the father of another one. The latter information is provided by Ctesias (fr. 13 §24) who says that "Xerxes married Amestris", the daughter of Otanes (or Onophas as Ctesias spells it), from whom he had a daughter called Amytis (4) named "after her grandmother". This last informa tion, in conjunction with Herodotus' Statement (V. 116) that a daughter of Darius was married to an Otanes, indicates that the wife of Otanes (2) was also named Amytis (3). As for the father of Otanes (2), Diodorus mentions that Otanes (speit Anaphas) who was one of the Seven Conspirators, had a successor by the same name.105 We clearly have a confusing pattern of repeated names from one génération to the other. The identification of Humay with Humaiti, however, unifies the Bundahishn list with that of al-Mas'ûdî and alTabarï who name her as KhumanT, because the latter spelling is a scribal mistake and the resuit of the transposition of one diacritical dot in the Arabie 105 Briant 1996: 145. Briant qualifies Diodorus' account of the ancestry of the kings of Pontus as based on a later lore, objecting to the fact, among others, that the Atossa therein is not Cyrus' aunt but his daughter. But considering the rep etition of names in Table 1 and the existence of two later Atossas, it is by no mean sure that such an aunt did not exist. rendering of Humaiti, حماتي vs.106. خمانى While much of the early post-Islamic historiés seem to be bewil dered by the introduction of a fictitious woman king with multiple Personalities, they nonetheless provide crucial information lacking in Ctesias: that Khumam, alias Amytis, was the daughter of Vishtaspa.107 Again, it stands to reason that if Vishtaspa was sympathetic to Zoroaster, one of his children, namely Amytis (2), would have developed a special relationship with the Prophet. This would thus explain the odd presence of a fictitious queen among the Achaemenid list of rulers. For, the priests who unabashedly portrayed Vishtaspa as king carried their scheme one notch further by squeezing Amtis (2) into the same list. Since Darius' father and grandfather were alive in 519 BC, Vishtaspa's age in that year is estimated at sixty, his father at seventy-eight. Such a supposition finds support in Ctesias' account about Amytis (1), whom he introduces as daughter of Astyages and the wife of a certain Spita mas subsequently killed by Cyrus. She is then taken by Cyrus, and said to be the mother of Tanyoxarces/ Bardiya and an opponent of the magus Sphendadates; she drinks poison out of despair for the loss of her son and Cambyses' refusai to punish his murderer.108 It is as garbled an account as the later Arabie texts, but one may still conjure that Amytis (2)/Khumânï was close to a Spitamas, whose name alludes to Zoroaster Spitama, supposedly eliminated by Cyrus.

Berossus too names Astyages's daughter as Amytis (see n. 15 above).</page><page sequence="24">68 ABOLALA SOUDAVAR riage to Cyrus should not come as a surprise because the latter must have engaged in matrimonial alliances with the main line of the Achaemenids. This would then explain not only Darius' privileged position with Cyrus and Cambyses but also his closeness to Otanes, as they would both be brothers-in-law to Cyrus. The closeness of Amytis (2) to Zoroaster, however, is cor roborated by the Avesta itself (Yt 13.139), where it names Humaiti as the person to be worshipped right after her own mother Atossa (1) (Hutaosä), and fol lowing Zoroaster's original wife, Hvovi. It is hard to believe that Ctesias would have invented for Cyrus a wife by the name of Amytis, and would concurrently emphasise, that she favoured Bardiya. Given that the latter's real mother, Cassandane, died c. 538 BC,109 one can very well imagine that another wife of Cyrus took the young boy under her wings and became a second mother to him. She who had been under the spell of Zoroaster, in turn influenced the young Bardiya.The scenario is even more appeal ing since it ties in well with the fact that the names of both Amytis (2) and Bardiya/Isfandyär appear in the Bundahishn list as supporters of Zoroaster. It also adds more credibility to our contention that the antagonism between Gaumata and Bardiya was perhaps reflective of the rift between the Median magi and the pärsäs. In addition, Ctesias' remark that Bardiya was "put to death by being forced to drink bull's blood" refers to a practice dear to the Mithraic magi and one that Zoro aster abhorred. It was a forerunner to the violent rift that led to Magophonia. Indeed, the animosity between the magi and the pârsâs did not develop overnight; it must have been simmering for some time. Therefore, one must assume that, toward the end of Astyages' reign, the conflict between the Median magi and the Ahura-Mazdä worshipping pärsä s became so intense that the Median king evicted their chief proponent, i.e. Zoroaster. Cyrus may have ridden this wave of unrest to victory over Astyages and later on married Amytis (2) in order to reconcile the two antagonistic factions. He probably married her immediately after Zoroaster's death in 541 BC, at the age of seventy-seven. For Ctesias, though, Cyrus must have murdered Zoroaster in order to marry his wife. This comes on top of another confusion caused by the fact that Astyages and Vishtäspa both had a daughter named Amytis. Ctesias emphasises (fr. 13 §8), however, that Amytis (2) had two sons from 109 Dandamayev and Medvedskaya 1990. Zoroaster whom Cyrus appointed as satraps at a very young age, "bidding them to obey their mother in eve rything". She thus exercised much authority, which probably aroused the animosity of Cambyses. Rather than committing suicide, she may have been poisoned by him. The Magophonia killings, therefore, seem to have been in reaction to the murders of Amtytis (2), Bardiya and perhaps the two sons of Zoroaster. XIII. 3. Forging a tale out of confusion When history writers are confused by a piece of infor mation, they usually seek supplemental information or try to imbed it in a familiar tale. In the case of Amytis/ Humaiti, for instance, al-Tabarï first introduces her as a daughter of Vishtäspa, with no additional com ment. It is a piece of information that he must have received through the Zoroastrian tradition built around Vishtäspa. But later on, he situates her thirty-year reign right after Artaxerxes I (r. 465^24 BC), because of the name of his sister, Amytis (4), that was trans mitted through the Jewish tradition.110 On the other hand, the author of the Bundahishn, who seems to have known that Darius had a daughter by the name of Amytis, presents this queen as the daughter of Bahman (alias Darius) and therefore places her right after him. Al-BTrunT names her as daughter of "Ardashir son of Bahman".111 Since the name Xerxes had no equivalent in Sasanian times, while Artaxerxes became Ardashir, it seems that later historians amalgamated the two and used the name Ardashir (alias Artaxerxes) also for Xerxes. Hence, al-BTrünl's Humäy refers to Amytis (4), whose reign is situated after the son of Bahman/ Darius, i.e. Xerxes. As for Ibn al-Athlr, who states that KhumänT was both the mother and sister of Därä (Darius), he was obviously in possession of a list very much like our Table l.112 More generally, the reign of a woman seemed so odd that later historians felt compelled to explain it with an elaborate tale. The model they had was that of the Sasanian Bürän (r. AD 630-31), a queen who truly reigned. Thus many particularities of her reign 110 Artaxerxes is referred to therein by his real name Kurash (Cyrus), a name revered by the Jews; and al-Tabarl's tale leads to the story of Jerusalem and its resurrection seventy years after Nebuchadnezzar II; al-Tabarl 1996, 2: 486. m al-Birünl 1998: 148.

In this game of rewrit ing history, however, what is certain is that the only reason for allocating regnal years to a certain Amytis was that Zoroastrian priests perceived her as a dedi cated supporter of Zoroaster. Whereas each of the preceding explanations may seem tenuous on its own, as a group they show a pat tern that clearly rules out fantasy or an haphazard alteration of facts. They were all performed long after the demise of Darius by Zoroastrian priests trying to enhance the prestige of their Prophet vis-à-vis kings. XIV. THE "258 AXIOM" REVISITED In the light of the above, we may go back and revisit Taqizadeh's explanation of the 258 axiom, subse quently expanded by Gershevitch, because it rested on the assumption that the Sasanian magi "imagined the Seleucid era" as the "era of Zoroaster".114 For Zoroastrian priests, who so blatantly elimi nated their enemies from the face of history and replaced them with fictitious kings, and who allocated the Aryan khvarenah to Zoroaster, the epoch year of the Seleucid era (i.e. the year 312 BC), against which the most important events of the previous five centu ries were measured, constituted yet another trophy to be brought into the Zoroastrian realm. With the Seleu cids long gone, and the Arsacids no longer around, the beginning of known history was simply equated with the day Zoroaster proclaimed his religion. It was a deliberate decision in order to uplift Zoroaster's glory rather than a decision stemming from confusion or oblivion. And whereas the elimination of certain kings within the 258-years' time bracket had elongated the "3 Soudavar 2006b: 180. U4 Taqizadeh 1947: 34-38; Gershevitch 1995: 6-7; Soudavar 2010a: 116. reign of others, the adoption of the Seleucid era as Zoroaster's, in combination with the dogmatic 258 years' time bracket, necessitated the shortening or elimination of reigns in the post-Alexander era. Hence the reduced Arsacid rule of 266 years. XV. LEGITIMACY VS. FORGERY Like historians of past times, modern historians have also sought to explain confusing information by wrapping it into a familiar tale. Thus forgery is often claimed to explain ill-understood situations. But with a claim of forgery must come the burden of proof, and the bar must be set very high when it pertains to an ancient document, for one has no right to eliminate scarce information by a frivolous claim. The forgery claim about the Pasargadae inscriptions rose out of incomprehension of its very function as the dwelling of the pârsâs, and of the Elamite practice of inscribing the founder's name in multitudes. It was compounded by the mistaken belief in Darius as having invented the Old Persian cuneiform script, a confusion about texts and a wrong methodology in the art-historical analysis. The forgery tale became so attractive that technical analysis was avoided, and historical analysis was even eschewed to fit the tale: if Herodotus actually states (111.75) that Cyrus descended from Achaemenes, he cannot be trusted; neither can be Cyrus' own inscrip tions. Instead, Achaemenes is labelled by Pierre Briant as a "wholly invented" ancestor and fictitious dynasty founder.115 But whoever forged his lineage among the kings of Iran, if not elsewhere, did it by claiming descent from a known and famous figure and not a fictitious one. It also seems odd that in a tribal society where clans are generally identified by the name of a powerful ancestor, Darius and his progeny would cling to a fictitious ancestor. Darius had gained such fame that for his progeny, claiming descent from him 115 Briant 1996: 123, 150: "un héro fondateur, Achéménès, inventé de toutes pièces".</page><page sequence="26">70 ABOLALA SOUDAVAR alone would have surely sufficed; they did not need to repeat a false claim. With a strong belief in the "Liar Darius" theory, documents proving the contrary, such as the two gold plaques in the name of Darius' forefathers, were simply labelled as suspect and unworthy of consideration.116 These plaques bear the name of Darius' grandfather and great-grandfather, Arsames and Ariaramnes, declared to be ... a great king, King of Kings, Pärsä King (Amh and AsH). They were found in the 1920s, at a time when forgers did not have access to knowl edge permitting the creation of such an inscription. No technical or epigraphic analysis has ever been con ducted to prove them fakes. Doubts were raised about the inscriptions because, unlike other Achaemenid inscriptions, they do not say xsayaOiya pärsaiy ("King in Persia") but xsayaOiyapärsä/pärsa, literally, "Pärsä King". These qualifications are translated as "Persian King" by Pierre Lecoq and "King [in] Persia" by the Reverend Sharp.117 But the pärsä therein cannot be translated as Persian, for it does not make sense to simply have, after the lofty title of King of Kings, a lesser qualifying term such as "Persian King" or "King in Persia". What we have instead is an allusion to a second role of the King, his responsibility as pärsä or keeper of the sacred fire. It was a title as prestigious, if not more so, than his title of King of Kings. It also argues for the genuineness of the plates rather the other way around.118 Furthermore, Kellens suggests that the name Achaemenes meant "the one who thought [the fire] was his friend".119 If true, we have solid support for an almost complete line of pärsä s from Achae menes to Darius. Far from being a fictitious character, Achaemenes must have been the one who established the prominence of his clan, to the extent that, at Pasar gadae, Cyrus saw it necessary to remind his pärsä constituency that he was one of Achaemenes' descend ents. One should also note that there is no incompat ibility in claiming the "King of Kings" title at a time when the Medes had constituted an empire. One king who remained under the suzerainty of the Pärsä Kings was certainly Cyrus I, King of Anshan. By virtue of 116 Briant 1996: 27. "7 Lecoq 1997: 179-80, Sharp 1975: 21. Sharp provides addi tional proof of authenticity (Sharp 1975: 19). Our previous contention that in early OP inscriptions the word-separator mark appeared even before the first word (Soudavar 2010a: 128) may no longer be true, for these plates have none. Ii« Kellens 2009: 809. being the keepers of the sacred fire that harboured the Aryan khvarenah, the status of the Pärsä Kings was high among Iranian tribes and only eclipsed by the Medes when they conquered Assyria. The above gold plaques, as well as items from the Kalmakareh grotto that bear the name of several kings, urge us in fact to review the imperial landscape of the seventh-sixth century BC. Despite the ascendency of the Medes, the Pärsä Kings probably continued to use the "King of Kings" title, as do waning dynasts who cling to past glories. Then came Darius who revived the lost glories when he took the reins of the Achaemenid empire. However, Darius' supposedly forged genealogy could have never fooled his co-Conspirators. If he was unaffiliated to Cyrus, they would have certainly elected Otanes, who had initiated the move against the Magi, who was brother-in-law to Cyrus, and father-in law to Cambyses. If Darius had lied about Bardiya or his ancestry, no lesser persons than his wives Atossa and Parmys, who were Bardiya's sister and daughter, would have known that and would have exposed him at one point or another. What is more, Darius' mar riage to them is often presented as his sole succession right to Cyrus' throne. But if that was a sufficient con dition, then Gaumata who had married Atossa, would have enjoyed the necessary legitimacy to carry on. He obviously did not. More importantly, the early rebellions against Darius are considered as proof of his illegitimacy.120 And yet, what is astounding in the historical nar ratives is the fact that so many army commanders deemed him legitimate enough to fight the rebels, on his behalf and far away from him. His legitimacy, as perceived by the Conspirators, is one thing, and for the army commanders, is another. For the former, his descent from the main line of the Achaemenids, i.e., the pärsä line, was perhaps sufficient. For the latter, however, he must have been recognised as a worthy commander as well as part of the inner circle of Cyrus' family. Cyrus' marriage to Darius' sister had opened the doors to the inner circle (see Table 1), and Darius' past positions as quiver-bearer of Cyrus and lance-bearer of Cambyses had given him impeccable credentials.121 This explains why, among the Con spirators, it was the young Darius who was elected king. Indeed, he had a legitimacy that no other person had: he belonged to the paramount Achaemenid line, 120 Briant 1996: 126-39. 121 Briant 1996: 124-25.</page><page sequence="27">ASTYAGES, CYRUS AND ZOROASTER 71 was pärsa son of pärsa, a warrior, and a close mem ber of Cyrus' family. XVI. OF KINGS AND PRIESTS Xavier Tremblay had pointed out to me two odd aspects of the Avesta: (1) unlike all other priests of the Iranian world, who are called magu, the Avestan priest is called aOravan; and (2) despite the fact that the word "king" is derived, in all Iranian languages, from either the root xsä (NP Shäh) or raz (Old Ind. 1Raja), no such word exists in the Avesta; we have instead the odd title of daitjhu.paiti or "nation chief'.122 Since the magi were so reviled by Magophonia, Zoroastrian priests could not be called magu. Nor could they be called pärsä, which had become a kingly epithet. They therefore settled for an equivalent term, adravan ("fire keeper"), in lieu of the pärsä who stood by the fire and shared the same belief in Ahura Mazda. The choice of this word, rather than magu, indicates that it was a compromise and adopted after the advent of the Achaemenids. Because artificial solutions never last, magu came back when Magophonia vanished after the demise of the Achaemenids. As for the term daitjhu.paiti, it was deliberately used to downgrade kings by following an existing tradition. In the new world order of Zoroastrianism, it was preferable not to use lofty titles such as King {xsä) or "King of Kings" lest they would overshadow their Prophet. Dairjhu.paiti was derived from a tradi tion that went back in time, probably to the name of the supposed founder of the Median dynasty, Deioces. For, in the same period, we also had a Mannean leader named Daiaukku, who was imprisoned by the Assyri ans.123 And since Deioces' name is spelled dahiyu ukka in Elamite, the first part of which is the same as OP dahyu ("nation"),124 we must be dealing with 122 Personal communication. 123 Dandamayev and Medvedskaya 2006. 124 Schmidt 1994. Schmidt believes that Deioces' name reflects "Iranian *Dahyu-ka-, a hypocoristic based on dahyu 'land'". But dahyu refers to land only by virtue of a group of people living on it. As Darius' inscriptions show, dahyu meant "nation" in the sense of a group of people because in DNa and DSe he is also qualified as "King of many races/ all races": nation and races must be homogeneous, and both about people. That is why dahyu-kadag (NP dih-kada) means a settlement and not "home of land"! The mindset of the Achaemenids was tribal and kingship for them applied a word that was synonymous with daiijhu.paiti and was applied to Median and Mannean kings alike. It is important to note that Media was not a homogeneous clan of Iranians but a confederacy with an Iranian élite at the top steeped, however, in Elamite culture, and with names of mixed origins.125 Thus daiijhu.paiti is the Avestan version of dahiyu-ukka, the latter part of which is derived from the Elamite uk-ku ("head").126 They all mean "nation chief' or "group leader". Interestingly, Vishtäspa is qualified as dahibed in Denkard VIII,127 and as kavi in Zoroaster's Gäthäs. The dahibed appellation followed Vishtäspa's false promotion to kingship by Zoroastrian priests, while kavi reflected his true function as pârsâ. As a word, kavi derives from an Indo-Iranian root that also gave the Vedic kavi ("seer, sacrificer, hymn composer"), and must have been used as a generic term to designate priests and shamans but not kings. The priestly con notation of kavi is corroborated by Ys. 46.11, in which the kavis gang up as enemies of Zoroaster. Clearly, there was no multitude of kings in Zoroaster's com munity to attack him. Zoroaster appropriately applied it to Vishtäspa, who was pârsâ but not king. He used an archaic term in the archaistic language of the Gathas. Later on, it was extended to the pârsâ line of the Achaemenids, and eventually came to encompass all members of the House of Achaemenes. The Kavis/ Kiyäns are therefore no other than the Achaemenids, and the Kiyänid khvarenah was meant to designate their khvarenah, supposedly distinct from the Aryan khvarenah. The Avesta is thus permeated with Median and Elamite terminology, and its Gathic core reflects Ach aemenid history. They all loudly negate the 1000 BC dating of its text. XVII. THE BUGBEARS In his passionate 1995 defence of the "258 axiom", Ilya Gershevitch qualified as "bugbears" the ideas whose "growls" impeded the understanding of Zoro to people. For sedentary dynasties such as Elamites or Babylonians, however, kingship was exercised over land. 125 Alief 2009: 119-30. He quotes Justi for a parallel between daiyhu.paiti and dahiyu-ukka. 126 Starostin 2002: 22. In Safavid times, the Turkish bâsh (head) has a similarly function. 127 MacKenzie 1991.

Courtesy of Christie's London. astrianism and its development.128 It seems that, since then, many more have joined the chorus to obstruct our understanding of Iranian history. The most harmful is the renewed vigour for the idea that Zoroaster lived c. 1000 years BC. A close second is the wrong transla tion of ciOra/ciça/cihr. As I have tried to explain, both matters have their roots in the sixth century BC and are interrelated. The words ciOra/ciça/cihr not only play a pivotal role in Iranian kingly ideology but also act as the pri mary gauge for the good and bad in Zoroastrian reli gious texts. As long as scholars insist on the wrong meanings of old, their translations will inevitably be flawed. Almut Hintze's recent translation of Yt 13:89 is yet another example. She translates ciOrem as "off spring" to obtain the rendering "[Zarathustra,] who [was] the first to put to flight the [offspring] coming from the evil breed of both daevas and mortals".129 To me, there are two major problems in such a transla tion: (a) one of common sense. If Zoroaster wanted to eradicate evil why did he attack the offspring and not the root itself, for as long as the daevas/daivas and evil men are alive, they can procreate indefinitely?; and (b) one of logic. Even if one believes that cidra 128 Gershevitch 1995: 5. 129 Hintze 2009: 58 meant "lineage, origin or seed" as she posits in her preamble, it baffles me to see that this said meaning is turned on its head. How can "origin" suddenly become "offspring", and how can the generator become the generated? The determination to extract some kind of meaning based on "nature, origin, or seed" can only lead to incongruent translations. Similarly, the dogmatic belief in a Zoroaster who lived in very ancient times and within pastoral sur roundings can lead to wrong translations. I had pre viously criticised P.O. Skjaervo's translation of the very Yt 13:95 (that was my launching pad into these studies): "Here, henceforth, Mi0ra ... shall further all that is foremost of the lands, and he pacifies those that are in commotion. (iSa ap^m * napâ sürö fraôât ...) Here the strong Scion of the Waters shall further all that is foremost of the lands, and he shall restrain those that are in commotion."130 He not only opted for "lands" and "commotion" in lieu of "nations" and "rebellion" but he also broke the symmetry of the two parts by accepting the manuscript text as is and not filling in the missing apqm that I have marked with an asterisk. I had contended that the rhythmic punctuation of this narrative text—with iôa 130 Skjaervo 2005: 67.</page><page sequence="29">ASTYAGES, CYRUS AND ZOROASTER 73 apqm at the beginning of each sentence—required the reintroduction of the missing apqm, because scribes who are confronted with a repeat Word, or grouping of letters, tend to suppress one of them.131 No sooner had I written this that I stumbled on a sixteenth Century AD document which vividly illustrated my conten tion. In a manuscript penned by one of the greatest calligraphers of the Islamic lands, 'Alâ' al-Dîn Tabrîzl, the text talks about the predicament of man in a series of sentences each punctuated at the beginning with the Word "if' (agar). They all follow the formula: "ifman does ..it will be Said that.. (Fig. 32).132 Four of the sentences therein Start with agar (marked by circles), but in a fifth one (highlighted by a rectan gle), two letters are missing. Because agar (spelled ag ٢) was to be followed by a Word beginning with the two lettersgr, the scribe inadvertently dropped the second one.133 This example demonstrates three points. First, that the dropping of a repeat Word or group of letters was a common error, one that even a renowned callig rapher such as 'Alâ' al-Dïn could not avoid. Second, that context is as important as words for translation. Thus scribal mistakes need to be corrected, as we have done it in respect to the transmitted texts of al-Tabarï, al-Mas'ôdî, Ibn al-Balkhl and allstakhri. Third, that the continuity in expression modalities (as the repeat pat tera to punctuate the beginning of a sentence) is a staple of the Persian culture. Therefore one cannot remain compartmentalised in time but must be able to check the viability of one's arguments over extended periods of time. If one remains in the hermetically closed world of philology, then one can build error upon error with no possibility of vérification. XVIII. TABULATING THE EVOLUTION OF ZOROASTRIANISM As the staunchest proponent of an early date for Zoro astrianism, Jean Kellens' latest insight on the devel opment of the Avesta is now available through the proceedings of his 2010-11 courses at the Collège de France. His views are summarised in Table 3. The predicament of a philological approach is that such tabulation only creates a relative order that floats 131 Soudavar 2010a: 117. For objections to the translation of dahyu as land, see n. 124 above. 132 Christie's, South Kensington sale of 15 April 2010, lot 203. 133 The sentence should have اقر رد سرقت ةردد:س in time and must be anchored to some historically meaningful event in Order to assess its starting point. There is simply no philological method to measure the time elapsed between the catégories produced in Table 3. But even if we accept the evolutionary process as presented in the first two columns, we can See that Kellens' only historical anchoring to a pre-Achaeme nid point of reference lies in a correspondence that he tries to establish between what he terms as "Recent Avestic" and Median onomastics. In fact, his sole concrete argument for the latter is to suggest that the name of the Median king Phraortes was derived from fravashi, a concept that he believes to have emanated from the Avesta.134 To me, it is a futile effort, for even if the linguistic dérivation proves to be correct, the idea that the Avesta generated the concept offravashi is like saying that it also generated the tribal concept of the khvarenah.135 As the wandering soul of ancient warriors, thefravashi is certainly not a religious con cept but most probably a tribal one.136 In Farvardin Yasht, Ahura Mazda is in need of the khvarenah of theyrav_s of the Righteous to achieve various func tions such as supporting Anahita (Yt 13:4) or the Earth (Yt 13:9).137 These stanzas not only link the khvarenah and thefravashis together, but clearly present them as long-existing entities that brought assistance to Ahura Mazda for the création and protection of the waters and the earth. But no matter how the concept of fravashi is twisted to make it Zoroastrian,138 the fact is that reliance on this sole tenuous argument to establish a pre-seventh Century BC date for Zoroaster and the Avesta, is symptomatic of desperation and a paucity of arguments. In considération of our conclusion about Zoro aster being a contemporary of Darius' father, and the Kiyanian khvarenah as being introduced at some point in between the demise of the kings of Persis and the rise of the Sasanians, the first two columns must slide down to cover a time scale starting in the early sixth Century BC and ending in third Century AD, as presented in the fourth column. As a resuit, Mary Boyce's remark that the Zoroastrian calendar was 34ل Kellens 201011: Cours 10. 135 For a khvarenahtype concept in Turco-Mongol socleties, see Soudavar2006a: 412-14. 136 See for instance Gnoli 1987 (p. 4537) where he qualifies the fravashi as an "immortality concept, typical of aristocratie and warrior societies". 137 Soudavar 2010a: 123. 138 See Boyce 2000 for flirther discussion on the subject.</page><page sequence="30">74 ABOLALA SOUDAVAR TABLE 3. Anchoring Avestan relative chronology (first two columns) to historical events. conceived in the late Achaemenid period falls into its right place.139 By contrast, what the proponents of a c. 1000 BC conceived Zoroastrianism cannot explain is, why Darius was still using a non-Zoroastrian cal endar five centuries later, and why its seventh month was named bayayadish (i.e. "god-worship") in which baya implicitly referred to Mithra and thus made him, and not Ahura Mazda, the god par excellence of that calendar?140 To treat this calendar as inconsequential and as merely reflecting an agricultural timetable, is like treating coins as mere commercial instruments. Beside their utilitarian aspect, they were also political instru ments that reflected kingly ideology. And that is why, upon ascending the throne, the Sasanian Ardashir I modified both the pattern of his coinage as well as the basis of his calendar. XIX. CONCLUSION As Gershevitch emphasised, there is no precision in evaluating the age of a language through philology.141 Linguistics can only establish a relativity that floats in time and must be anchored down at some point to a historical event. To understand the evolution of the Avesta, one must be cognisant of the existing tensions 139 Approvingly quoted in de Jong 2010: 89. wo Razmjou 2003: 22—24, 31—32; Soudavar 2010a: 114. 141 Gershevitch 1995: 4. between the Median magi and the desires of Zoroas trian priests trying to establish the supremacy of their religion. To think of Zoroastrianism as a monolithic religion emanating from the teachings of a single prophet is like forgetting the role of active apostles such as St Paul, and the political nature of successive ecumenical councils, in shaping Christianity as we know it today. Politics played a major role in shaping the Avesta, which in turn affected subsequent Iranian politics. Thus Zoroastrian priests, seeking to honour their Prophet in the highest terms, made him the pos sessor of the Aryan khvarenah after the demise of the Achaemenids. In the same vein, the fall of the mighty Assyrians was projected as an event caused by the auspicious birth of Zoroaster and the epoch year of the well-established Seleucid era was reinterpreted as the year of Zoroaster's birth. The fact that later Zoroastrian priests were des ignated by magu and mubad, instead of aOravan of the holy Avesta, can only be explained in terms of an artificial appellation that Zoroaster himself did not use, but that the authors of the Yashts adopted in reaction to Magophonia on the one hand, and in imitation of the pärsä designation of Achaemenid kings on the other. If later priests were not called aOravan, it was because it was an artifice that served its purpose during the Ach aemenid period and was no longer useful afterwards. One cannot read the Avesta and not be shocked by the unnecessary redundancy of the "Mazdâ-created"</page><page sequence="31">ASTYAGES, CYRUS AND ZOROASTER 75 label for so many entities. As I have tried to dem onstrate elsewhere, this repetition was symptomatic of the re-allocation to Ahura Mazda of attributes previously characterising other deities.142 In particu lar, the oft-repeated "Mazdä-created" label for the khvarenah and the waters came in reaction to their prior attachment to Mithra and Apam Napät. The shift of power from these two deities to Ahura Mazdâ was essentially a political necessity for the transition from a Median kingly ideology to an Achaemenid one. Therefore, Yts 13:94-95 as the reflection of Median ideology, the animosity that Darius expressed towards its predecessors, Darius' reformulation of the khvarenah concept with its emphasis on ciça, the appearance of the Kiyänian khvarenah in com petition with the Aryan khvarenah and the use of the epithet kavi for the Achaemenids, are all necessary elements that help situate in time the mutations of the Avesta. Whereas Kellens suggests that Darius forged his genealogy by modelling his ancestry according to names found in the Avesta,143 it now seems that the opposite is true. What Kellens perceives as the mythical kings of Iran is in fact the garbled product of Zoroastrian priests' manipulation of ancient Ira nian history. And therein lies the problem; for as long as philologists think of the Avesta as an immutable text that regulated every aspect of Iranian thought, they will never be able to understand its true nature. Rather than the Achaemenids trying to conform to its precepts, it was the Avestan priests who opportun istically modified its content to shift the balance of power from kingship to priesthood. A sound theory must be able to stand the test of time in confronting new evidence. Since I first realised the crucial importance of Yts 13:94-95 for determin ing the birth date of Zoroaster, as well as Median kingly ideology, I have been able to accumulate much corroborating evidence and to build layer upon layer in order to allow further progress. An unsound theory would have unravelled by now or at best stagnated. It has not. What is more, each new layer has not only revealed hidden facets of Iranian history and religion but has also added coherence to the whole structure. Coherence is in fact what differentiates our views from adverse theories. 1« Soudavar 2010: 122. 143 Kellens 2009; 2002. I fail to understand how names from the Avesta would have assured Darius' clan and subjects of the veracity of his "forged" lineage. I now dare to say that dissociating Zoroaster's birth date from Yts 13:94-95 and pushing him into the stratosphere of the second millennium BC is an act of obstructionism, akin to what Zoroastrian priests did to the memory of Cyrus. More important, it shrouds Zoroaster's monotheistic vision of Ahura Mazda, and his "spiritual esoterism",144 in all the encumbrances that political-minded priests added to the Avesta. Appendix Among the misconceptions that are about to become accepted fact through repetition is the attribution of certain types of Lydian coins (known as "Croeseids") to Croesus' reign (595-546 BC), even though there was a long tradition to consider them as Achaemenid issues. It was first proposed by Nicholas Cahill and John Kroll in 2005 and is now reiterated as fact in a new publication on Lydia. Their original analysis was prompted by the discovery of such coins on a body buried under the rubble of a burned and collapsed structure on the outskirts of Sardis. The aim of the study was to choose between two possibilities: (a) Cyrus' occupation of Sardis in 546 BC; and (b) the burning of Sardis in 499 BC by Greek rebels. Some how they preferred the latter, based on a number of "facts" that warrant no such a conclusion: 1. Their basic technical analysis is the carbon-dating of wood pieces found in the rubble. The imprecision inherent in carbon-dating notwithstanding, the very table that Cahill and Kroll rely on unequivocally puts the two possibilities on an equal footing (90.2% probability each).145 2. Their main argument, that no item datable to post 550 BC was found in the débris, rests on a dating of Greek vases that, as they avow themselves, is contested by some scholars. 3. The body with coins was found within a recess in the fortified wall of the city, facing outside. Cyrus had defeated the Lydian army on the Plain of Thymbra and then marched toward Sardis, which he took after a short siege. If it was during Cyrus' assault on the city, the defenders would have been inside and not outside of the wall. On the other hand, since during the 499 BC rebellion the fire and burning of the city spread from inside, it would I« Humbach 2000.

Cyrus' army may have looted the city but it would have been uncharacteristic of him to let his army burn a surrendered city. 4. Against these uncertainties, we undeniably have a major iconographical shift in Lydian coins from a single lion head (Type 1, Fig. 33) to a double head design (Type 2, Fig. 34). The latter is the more ancient, and was abundantly found in Lydian soil, as the new catalogue of Cahill and Kroll bears witness; some forty-three coins dated to 630-560 BC are illustrated therein.146 Its lion head has a hairy bulbous protrusion that is characteristic of the Lydian style. The lion on Type 2 is devoid of such an important characteristic; it often lacks the comb-like mane and has instead the jaw of Iranian lions. The stylistic shift is even more evident for the bull's head. In a survey that I have conducted on Greek bull horns, from Magna Graecia to Lydia, not one has displayed the up and forward leaning horn that is emblematic of the Iranian bull, of perhaps Babylonian inspiration (see e.g. Fig. 35). 5. More important, coins were propaganda tools that were supposed to convey, majesty, power and authority. A single lion head, representing the king of the animals, did that. On the other hand, two confronting animals, a bull and a lion, neither subjugating the other, has at best an ambivalent or confusing message. Unless one can find a Lydian or Greek justification—which I doubt—the only valid one is the Median kingly ideology, in which 146 Cahill 2010: 427-28. these two animals projected day and night, and through them, Mithra and Apam Napät. 6. Finally, such a double shift, in style as well as philosophy, can only happen after a cataclysmic event such as an invasion or change in dynasty. It could only be prompted by Cyrus' conquest of Anatolia followed by the satrapal rule of his Median generals. Photographic credit: Unless otherwise mentioned, all photos are by the author.
