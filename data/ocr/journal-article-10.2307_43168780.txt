Mayer IS the teaching mental an define USING effective purposes a construct, CHILDREN'S science science of strategy concepts? this concept or LITERATURE a article, group when as (For of a I an effective strategy when teaching science concepts? (For the purposes of this article, I define a science concept as a mental construct, or a group of ideas, that explains a specific natural phenomenon). Combining literature with science is an approach that has gained popular acclaim recently, re- ceiving recognition and consideration from both science and science-educa- tion organizations. In fact, several groups, including NSTA, publish lists of recommended titles to assist edu- cators in selecting appropriate re- sources for teaching science. Because of the ease with which fiction and trade books can be integrated into whole language and thematic cur- ricula, these books are readily ac- cepted by educators and heavily pro- moted by major book publishers. Proponents contend that children's fiction and picture books can enhance elementary science concept instruc- tion. Others insist that the fictional components of children's literature actually interfere with the learning of science concepts. Could the presenta- tion of science concepts in a fictional context confuse children and actually engender misconceptions? To answer that question, I de- signed and completed a research project that examined the effective- ness of fiction in helping children learn science concepts. I want to share the results of that project and to de- scribe one method of determining whether a particular piece of litera- ture would provide an effective tool for the learning of a specific science concept. The Research Begins The results of a preliminary study a partner and I had conducted as part of our graduate work prompted me to conduct a broader formal study of my own. In the first study, my partner and I evaluated 15 science trade books according to the elements measured by a checklist we devised (see Figure 1, page 18) and interviewed 16 chil- dren on their response to a carefully chosen science trade book (Dear Mr. Blueberry, by Simon James). This study revealed interesting data re- garding the effectiveness of using children's literature to teach science concepts, and I wanted to see if the results would be similar when evalu- ating a greater number of books. Al- though the second study also repre- sents a small number of students, the results merit further investigation. To begin my research, I again se- lected 16 children, two boys and two girls at each level from kindergarten through grade three. These students came from two ethnically and socio- economically diverse midwestern el- ementary schools, and they were at ease and willing to participate in the study. After much careful consider- ation and having evaluated 84 books, I also chose to use the same book, Dear Mr. Blueberry, as we had in the earlier study, because I felt that it de- scribes the nature of whales (the book's science concept) fairly and ad- equately. In this book, a teacher cor- rects a young girl's misconceptions about whales; because the misconcep- tions are corrected in the text, the reader should be able to acquire an accurate understanding of the rel- evant science concepts. I also chose this book because it is intended for students in preschool through sec- ond grade, an age group that is a com- mon target for teaching science con- 16 SCIENCE AND CHILDREN MARCH 1995</page><page sequence="2">Samples of children's drawings after reading a book about whales. Children's Science Concepts? cepts with children's literature. In private sessions, I read Dear Mr. Blueberry to each student. Afterward, each child retold the story in his or her own words, answered 10 ques- tions pertaining to the science con- cepts presented in the book (see Fig- ure 2, page 18), and drew a picture of a whale (see samples below). Intriguing Results The results of these interviews and an examination of their drawings indi- cated that the children acquired only an insignificant amount of new infor- mation from reading the story. In fact, their responses to my questions sup- ported the ideas that some children's literature may actually interfere with ► science learning; that misrepresenta- tions in the text and illustrations can confuse children; and that the k children's own gender bias and un- derstanding of animal behavior were influenced in a negative manner by * the author's treatment of the girl and the animal in the story. &gt; The children's responses to my fi- nal question, "Did you learn anything about whales that you did not already » know?", were particularly interesting, since the purpose of reading the book was to enhance the students' scien- tific knowledge of whales. Nine of the 16 children replied that they had learned nothing new; some said that they had recently studied whales in class, while others said that they al- ready knew a great deal about whales. Of the seven remaining children, one shrugged his shoulders and re- sponded, "I'm not sure"; one said that he did learn something new about whales (that they live in salt water); and five stated newly acquired mis- conceptions about whales. The follow- ing are pseudofacts that these chil- dren gleaned from the story: • Whales can jump from ponds to oceans. • Whales eat shrimp and fish. • Whales have either white or yellow bottoms. • Whales can have names.

Children answered these questions after listening to the author read Dear Mr. Blueberry. The Interview Questions 1 . How big are whales? 2. Where do whales live? 3. What do whales eat? 4. How do whales get from place to place? 5. Who are the people in the story? 6. Can whales and people meet each other on the beach? 7. How much time passes from the beginning to the end of the story? 8. Do you think the girl is silly or smart? 9. Are some parts of the story not true? Which parts? 10. Did you learn anything about whales that you did not already know? • Blue whales do not let people pet them. The results of my research support the idea that, in some cases, children's literature may not be an effective sci- ence resource. Moreover, certain books may unintentionally foster mis- conceptions and influence attitudes about other issues in a negative way. The checklist we developed for use in the preliminary study can be used as a guideline for choosing children's lit- erature to be incorporated into the science curriculum. The Checklist The checklist poses important ques- tions to ask when evaluating a poten- tial resource for classroom use. Good science books are identified by re- sponses circled in the left column; the more positive marks, the better suited the book is to the learning of science. Conversely, a majority of re- sponses in the right-hand column in- dicates that the book is not desirable for learning science concepts; a "no" mark in response to the first question (Is the science concept recognizable?) practically negates the book as a good science resource. After evaluating a book according to the prescribed criteria, it is up to the educator to decide whether or not a particular book is an appropriate resource for instruction. The evalua- tion of Dear Mr. Blueberry that fol- lows should clarify the criteria and facilitate using the checklist. Please note that my comments about the book reflect what I learned during the course of my research, rather than my preliminary assessment. Remem- ber, too, that a book might be an ex- cellent example of children's litera- ture, but at the same time, a poor resource for learning science. That dif- ference is what the checklist should help you to recognize. The following questions comprise the list. 1. Is the science concept recog- nizable? A book's science concept should be apparent through its pre- sentation of factual information about a particular subject in nature or the physical world. In Dear Mr. Blueberry, the science concept is easily recog- nizable - whales. 2. Is the story factual? Some sto- ries are fabricated anecdotes that could not happen in the real world, while others are fictional accounts of events that could actually occur. Both types of stories can impart some fac- 18 SCIENCE AND CHILDREN MARCH 1995</page><page sequence="4">A book might be an excellent example of children 's literature but a poor resource for learning science. The checklist serves to point out that difference. tual information. The story told in Dear Mr. Blueberry could not happen in real life, but it does contain some factual information about whales. Ac- cording to the checklist, this book would rate as "moderately" factual. 3. Is fact discernible from fic- tion? By definition, fiction describes an invented story that has been cre- ated by an author. However, some fic- tion is based on fact and represents what is real. Children's interviews re- garding Z)eörA/r. Blueberry indicated that students could not distinguish between some of the real and fictional elements in the story. 4. How many misrepresentations does the book contain? Misrepresen- tations lead to misconceptions. Dear Mr. Blueberry contained more than a few misrepresentations, but not nearly as many as other science trade books that were reviewed in the study. This book received a "some" rating in this category on the checklist. 5. Are the illustrations accurate? Young readers assimilate a great deal of information from the illustrations in books. In some cases, artistic inter- pretation can lead to falsification and exaggeration of what is real. The car- toon-like illustrations in Dear Mr. Blueberry give little information about what a real whale looks like, thus contributing to misconceptions about the animals. For this reason, the book's illustrations were identi- fied as "inaccurate" on the checklist. 6. Are characters portrayed with gender equity? To evaluate a book's gender bias, ask yourself the follow- ing questions: "Does the book present characters in stereotypical, gender-ex- clusive roles (such as men as profes- sionals or skilled workers and women as mothers or secretaries)?" "Does the story reinforce stereotypical behaviors or attitudes usually attributed to one gender (such as girls being presented as naive and boys as knowledgeable)?" "Does the book have an appropriate ratio of boys to girls?" and "Are both girls and boys actively participating in the story?" According to their in- terviews regarding Dear Mr. Blue- berry, children perceived the girl in the book to be silly. 7. Are the animals/objects por- trayed naturally? Anthropomorphic animals/objects may prove confusing to children, especially if the purpose of the story is to learn more about the animal or object in its natural sur- roundings. In Dear Mr. Blueberry, human characteristics were attributed to the whale, which led several chil- dren to believe that the whale was a person in the story. 8. Is the passage of time refer- enced adequately? Without an ad- equate reference to the passing of time, children may conclude that an event that happened over a period of seasons, years, decades, or centuries happened in a matter of minutes, hours, or days. Without exception, this was the most difficult element for children to assess. As an adult re- viewer, I thought Dear Mr. Blueberry was adequately time-referenced be- cause of the letter-writing process de- scribed in the story. However, chil- dren indicated in the interviews that they thought the story happened in as little as 10 minutes to two weeks. 9. Does the story promote a posi- tive attitude toward science and tech- nology? A child's attitude toward a specific concept can be altered by the tenor of the information provided. Some science trade books present gloomy or hopeless accounts of the plight of our planet. Dear Mr. Blue- berry presented children with infor- mation about whales in a positive and upbeat manner. 10. Will children read or listen to this book? Whether a child can read and understand a book's science con- cept without adult assistance affects the amount of interaction the child may have with the concepts explored in the book. A book is categorized as a "readable" or a "listen-to" based on whether it meets the vocabulary, lan- guage development, and the concep- tual level of the majority of the chil- dren for whom the book is intended. Dear Mr. Blueberry is considered a "listen-to" book because it is recom- mended for children preschool through second grade, the majority of whom cannot read or understand some of the concepts presented with- out adult assistance. In Conclusion The checklist we devised does not at- tempt to quantify the value of a book as a good science resource. It attempts only to consider various characteris- tics of the book in order to make an informed decision about integrating it into the science curriculum. The final decision depends on the indi- vidual teacher, who should recognize the itemized weaknesses in the book and be prepared to deal with them. Is there a place for fiction within the science curriculum? The results of this study indicate that some fic- tion may impede content acquisition. That is not to say, however, that sci- ence and literature should not be in- tegrated. The emphasis on using children's literature to teach science concepts should be placed on choos- ing fiction presented without bias, with fine, realistic illustration, and (continued on page 43) MARCH 1995 SCIENCE AND CHILDREN 19</page><page sequence="5">(Using Children's Literature, continued from page 19) most important of all, with the accu- rate presentation of science concepts. If we teach with books that do not meet these criteria, science learning with children's literature could be- come not the learning of science con- cepts, but the learning of science mis- conceptions.
