<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reviews of Books midrashic study: the use of anthropomorphism and its function in this literature. Chapter four focuses upon the thematics of the midrashic mashal, and there Stern claims that the mashal's message is essentially a functional category. The categories he isolates for special attention and illustration are: apologetics, polem- ics, eulogy and consolation, complaint, regret, and warning. Under each category, he brings representative passages which he carefully analyzes to illustrate the message he derives and how it fits into the larger categories. This chapter is of particu- lar value in providing a framework for understanding to those who are relatively new to midrashic literature. One of the most perplexing questions to the student of Mid- rash is the precise nature of this material, its place of origin, and the details of the compositional process. As mentioned above, the compilers/editors/authors did not provide critical in- troductions to their works; thus, many scholarly points of view are to be found regarding the nature of the larger documents in which the rabbinic meshalim are located. In chapter five, Stern places the rabbinic mashal in its larger context as he under- stands that context. He asserts that the various midrashic col- lections "remain to all appearances more like anthologies of traditional Rabbinic interpretations that an anonymous editor selected and recorded than like self-contained, logically struc- tured books in their own right" (p. 152). In this discussion, I would have appreciated more attention to the distinctions between the two genres of Midrash: the exegetical/halakhic midrashim, such as the Mekhilta D'Rabbi Ishmael, and the homiletical midrashim, such as Leviticus Rabbah or Pesikta D'Rav Kahana. Whereas the exegetical midrashim clearly are "verso-centric," to quote Stern (p. 154) quoting James Kugel, I find that "text" in the homiletical midrashim is often merely "pretext." Further, I side with those who see logic and structure in what are termed "literary homilies." Stern sees the homilet- ical midrashim more as pieces of lessons once delivered ser- monically as well as "editorial constructs, intended perhaps to serve as aids for preachers in need of material for their own sermons" (p. 154). These questions of the larger structure are not crucial to Stern's central concern, which is the smaller literary rhetorical units of the Midrash, especially the mashal. In chapter five, he discusses the role of the mashal in the homily, its relationship to the technical structure the petihta, or proem, its place in aggadic narrative, its use in relationship to the exegetical enumeration, and instances of meshalim used in a series. Ex- amples are well selected and analyzed with clarity. In the final chapter, Stern traces the history of the mashal in Hebrew literature from its supposed origins in the ancient Near East up to its use by modern Hebrew writers such as Ag- non. He examines the use of the parable in the synoptic Gos- pels to compare it with rabbinic meshalim. He analyzes the parable of The Wicked Husbandmen in depth, since it uses and interprets a scriptural prooftext in a rabbinic way, and he briefly analyzes the eleven other parables attributed to Jesus in the three synoptic Gospels. He concludes that "Jesus used the parable (insofar as the Gospel narratives tell us) in essentially the same way as the Rabbis employed the mashal-in public contexts (sermons or preaching), and as an instrument for praise and blame, often directed at the persons present in the audience" (p. 200). The book contains two valuable appendices: the first de- scribes the various nonparabolic narrative genres in rabbinic literature; the second provides Hebrew critical texts for the twenty-four meshalim from Lamentations Rabbah which Stern used as his principal illustrative material. Of enormous worth are the forty-six pages of notes, which provide extensive ref- erences to articles and books which deal with virtually every subject mentioned. This is a book to be studied carefully, not merely read. The author's extensive knowledge of classics and comparative lit- erature as well as rabbinics gives breadth and perspective to his treatment. For the student of rabbinic literature or for the generalist whose interest is in religion and its various narra- tive forms, David Stern has provided a valuable resource. EDWARD A. GOLDMAN HEBREW UNION COLLEGE Towards a Grammar of Biblical Poetics: Tales of the Proph- ets. By HERBERT CHANAN BRICHTO. New York: OXFORD UNI- VERSITY PRESS, 1992. Pp. xv + 298. $35. H. C. Brichto is a product of mid-twentieth-century biblical scholarship, having studied under E. A. Speiser and his col- leagues at the University of Pennsylvania. He was thus trained in a philological-historical-comparative approach, with plenty of ancient Near Eastern languages and texts against which to read the Bible. Add to this the literary approaches to the Bible of the 1970s and '80s. It is all these which largely inform the book under review. Brichto's analyses are not the avant garde post-structuralist readings which are accessible only to the initiated. They are, rather, more like the close readings of earlier literary scholars, especially New Critics, but with an appreciation of historical context that the New Critics eschewed. There is still a strong hint that Brichto is in pursuit of the "original" meaning, yet he acknowledges a certain indeterminacy of meaning-or at least the possibility that others will see things that he has not dis- cerned. Like most literary critics, he assumes the unity of the piece that he examines. But he goes farther than many in stat- ing that a poetical grammar is a "set of rules that will show 501</page><page sequence="2">Journal of the American Oriental Society 113.3 (1993) that the Hebrew Scriptures... constitute a unitary design and a single 'authorial voice' even though the several or many au- thors who contribute to that voice and design may have lived centuries apart" (p. viii). There is a bit of a polemic against practitioners of historical criticism here, or as he calls them, "antiquarian philologists," and a bit of a shift in the role of a poetical grammar. Brichto not only wants to assume the unity of the Bible, but to prove it through his poetical analyses. Yet his poetical grammar is a hypothesis, which in the end he is not able to demonstrate. Also like most literary critics, Brichto tends to view the Bible as "primarily creative, imaginative, and fictive" (p. viii) rather than as historical, with a didactic purpose. This raises the question of genre, which also arises in other parts of the book. It is a troublesome question, for biblical scholars either borrow generic designations from the Greeks or the folklor- ists, or invent ad hoc genres. Brichto does some of both in calling the episode of the Golden Calf a "philosophic fable" (p. 118). He knows that this is a unique genre and feels the need to develop a unique classification system. But he does not pursue the issue of genre systematically. The texts chosen are all narratives about prophets: Jonah, Moses (the Golden Calf episode), and the prophets in the book of Kings. The "exegetical essays" on these texts are preceded by an introduction (to my mind the most interesting part of the book) and followed by a discussion of "signs" (tefillin, me- zuzah) and a brief summary of some poetic matters. Each exe- getical essay ends with a review of its kerygma and poetic aspects. These reviews, however, are weak, and one must con- clude that despite the title and the introduction, the bulk of the book is exegetical rather than a grammar of biblical poetics. (In all fairness, the title is Towards a Grammar of Biblical Poetics. Brichto is setting out on a journey with no claim to having ar- rived at his destination.) Brichto's exegesis is far-reaching and often enlightening; here he brings to bear his erudition and control of the material and enters areas beyond the strictly lit- erary-such as ethics, religion, and human nature. There is an idiosyncratic flavor to the book, a combination of the old-fashioned and the radical reworking. This is best il- lustrated in the translations (exegetes have a passion for re- translating!). In Exodus 33:3 we find "a land oozing with milk and honey" and in 33:4 "no one donned any finery." The counterpart, "doff all finery," occurs in v. 5. Brichto feels strongly about translation and about linguistic knowledge of Hebrew-an important point for many literary critics who lack these skills. But I fear that translations like these, despite their accuracy, will alienate many of today's readers. This is not, as the author readily acknowledges, a "guide, manual, or handbook of either literary criticism in general or biblical poetics in particular" (p. viii). The theoretical discus- sion is unsophisticated and the bibliography sparse. But the exegesis is sound and clearly written. This is a volume which will find its place in the ever-growing library of literary exe- gesis of the Bible. ADELE BERLIN UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND 502</page></plain_text>
