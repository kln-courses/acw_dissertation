<plain_text><page sequence="1">46 A FORUM FOR RESEARCHERS A Systems Approach to Mathematics Education HANS-GEORG STEINER, University of Bielefeld At the Fifth International Congress on Mathematical Education in Ade- laide, I presented the case for a theory of mathematics education (TME) as a developmental program with three interrelated components (Steiner, 1985): 1. The identification and elaboration of basic problems in the orientation, foundation, methodology, and organization of mathematics education as a discipline 2. The development of a comprehensive approach to mathematics edu- cation in its totality when viewed as an interactive system comprising re- search, development, and practice 3. Self-referent research and meta-research related to mathematics edu- cation that provides information about the state of the art-the situation, problems, and needs of the discipline-while respecting national and re- gional differences. Issues and questions relating to these components were raised and dis- cussed at a postcongress conference on TME (Steiner, Balacheff, Mason, Steinbring, Steffe, Brousseau, Cooney, &amp; Christiansen, 1984). In this paper, I shall consider the second component in more detail. I shall assume that one basis for a comprehensive view of mathematics education-that is, a kind of meta-paradigm to help elaborate and coordinate its characteristic interdependencies-might be found in a systems approach that would be built on the concepts of human activity and social interaction. THE MANAGEMENT PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE In Churchman's (1968) management philosophy of science, knowledge is viewed "as a way of doing, 'a certain way of management of affairs' " (p. 99). A systems-theoretical analysis shows that the conceptual structures of a scientific discipline can be understood and used productively only if they are conceived of in connection with activities that are characteristic of that This article is based on a paper presented at the research presentation of the 63rd Annual Meeting of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, San Antonio, TX, 17 April 1985. I am grateful to the reviewers of the original version of the manuscript for their indirect and direct contribution to the present form of the article.</page><page sequence="2">Hans-Georg Steiner 47 science as a system. According to Churchman, the foundations of the struc- tures cannot be found in any isolated elements but rather lie in the totality of the scientific processes and developments themselves. This philosophy has two important aspects. On the one hand, it points in the direction taken by recent developments in the foundations and epistemology of the sciences (and mathematics in particular), namely an avoidance of various kinds of reductionism in favor of a more empirical and factual understanding. On the other hand, it makes the affairs of a science integrable into larger systems of activities and decision making, including problems of values and ethics. Values and Ethics Churchman (1968) speaks of the "ethics of large systems," which, for him, is based on the elaboration of these systems and on public information and participation. These ideas have been picked up by Jantsch (1972), who outlined an integrated systems view of science, education, and innovation that takes as the value base and purpose for that dynamic system the notion of "creating an anthropomorphic world." Jantsch (1975, 1979) also refers to the pioneering discovery and theoretical analysis of self-organizing and self-reproducing (i.e., autopoietic) systems that are associated with such people as Ilya Prigogine, Humberto Maturana, Francisco Varela, and Her- man Haken (Benseler, Hejl, &amp; K6ck, 1980; Haken, 1977; Maturana &amp; Varela, 1979; Nicolis &amp; Prigogine, 1977). Autopoietic systems have been identified not only in the domains of physics, chemistry, and biology but also in the human and social world (Luhmann, 1982, 1984; Maass, 1985; Schifer, 1983). They seem to be pervasive factors in the developing universe. Jantsch envisages a new "ethics of evolution," part of which would be meta- evolutionary-to support the evolution of evolutionary mechanisms and principles. We in mathematics and mathematics education have not yet realized that these considerations also apply to our domains. Mathematics is not value free. Mathematical constructs carry with them potential world views and represent specific interests and types of rationality. The ethical and social dimensions of mathematics play an especially fundamental role in mathe- matical modeling. These dimensions should become a component of the basic orientation and goals of mathematics teaching not by talking about them in general but by putting them into practice through concrete mathe- matical activities in the dynamic system of a classroom of active learners (Steiner, 1982, 1984). Epistemology The other aspect of Churchman's (1968) philosophy, his emphasis on a more empirical and pragmatic epistemology of the sciences, has found sup- port in mathematics from various sources, among them (a) Lakatos's (1978) quasi-empiricistic view, (b) Jahnke's (1978) transfer to mathematics from</page><page sequence="3">48 A Systems Approach physics of Sneed's view that theories consist not of statements only but rather of a theory kernel plus a set of intended applications, (c) Thom's (1973) empirical-sociological understanding of mathematics, (d) Putnam's (1967) "mathematics without foundations," (e) Goodman's (1984) know- ing mathematician, and (f) Wang's (1974) "substantial factualism" within his new mathematical philosophy of knowledge. An empirical epistemology for mathematics would assume that mathe- matical activity is object related and cooperative. Such an epistemology would also have to give central consideration to the role played in mathe- matics by the means of representing and operating on mathematical con- structs. This role has become an important issue in connection with the increased use of graphical methods and visualization in mathematics and computer science. A start has been made on the elaboration of this kind of epistemology, together with related historical studies, at the Institute for the Didactics of Mathematics (IDM) at the University of Bielefeld. Topics on which studies of epistemology and didactics have been made include number concepts (Bekemeier, 1982), proof (Jahnke, 1978; Mormann, 1981), the textbook (Keitel, Otte, &amp; Seeger, 1980), graphic methods (Biehler, 1984), probability concepts (Steinbring, 1980), exploratory data analysis (Biehler, 1982), and the concepts of variable and function (von Harten, Jahnke, Mormann, Otte, Seeger, Steinbring, &amp; Stellmacher, 1985). COMPLEMENTARITY I should point out that a crucial phenomenon appears in the IDM studies cited above that needs clarification: the phenomenon of complementarity. Complementarity is well known, even if not well understood, in both math- ematics and mathematics education as the cause of many short-lived reform movements and "waves of fashion" that ebb and flow between the extremes of polarized positions. Most of the so-called false dichotomies (Hilton, 1977) in mathematics education-such as skill versus understanding, struc- ture versus problem solving, axiomatics versus construction, pure versus applied-represent pairs of seemingly opposite positions that can be traced back through history. Attempts have often been made to straighten out these paradoxes in a reductionist fashion either by giving absolute domi- nance to one position or by advancing a multiaspect approach that just says "do both." Neither approach understands and operationalizes the under- lying antagonistic relationships and mutual interactions of the two posi- tions. A great variety of complementarities can be found in concepts, knowl- edge, and human cognitive activities in general. For example, for a concept that is part of a theory there is a complementarity between the concept as an object and the concept as a tool-between the representational or de- scriptive momentum of the concept and its instrumental or operational</page><page sequence="4">Hans-Georg Steiner 49 momentum. Although the principle of complementarity was first discovered by Niels Bohr in quantum theory, it turns out to hold in a much broader sense: Every relevant piece of theoretical knowledge, being part of some idea or model of the real world, will in some way or another have to take into account that the person having that knowledge is part of the system represented by the knowledge. All knowledge presupposes a subject, an object and relations between them (which are established by means of the subject's activity). Therefore all knowledge has an incoherent structure with metaphorical and strictly operative connections (Otte, 1984, pp. 45-46). One of the deficiencies of the "new math" reform was an overemphasis on the descriptive and relational components of concepts like set, variable, or group, neglecting their operative and exploratory components. At present there seems to be another violation of the complementarity principle in Papert's (1980) epistemology of modularity: an overemphasis on the algo- rithmic aspects of geometric concepts, with implied limitations on devel- oping the ideas of analytic geometry, and a one-sidedness in stressing the syntactic aspects of the concept of variable while neglecting its semantic aspects. This epistemology has negative effects on the teaching and learning of the function concept (Richenhagen, 1985). OTHER DOMAINS Activity and interaction play an important role in several other domains. The first is activity theory in Soviet psychology and epistemology, as rep- resented in the work of Rubinstein, Vygotsky, Leont'ev, and Yudin (Wertsch, 1981). Ideas from activity theory are increasingly being used as fundamental conceptual tools in research in science and mathematics edu- cation (D6rfler, 1984; Hedegaard, Hakkarainen, &amp; Engestr6m, 1984; Otte, 1984; Otte &amp; Bromme, 1978). The second domain is the study of the social constitution of meaning in the mathematics classroom. This study analyzes human interactions in social institutions using techniques such as social frame theory or symbolic inter- actionism (Bauersfeld, 1980; Bauersfeld, Bussmann, Krummheuer, Lorenz, &amp; Voigt, 1983). The third domain is the study of the so-called didactical contract in the mathematics classroom. This study, initiated by Brousseau (1984) and used by other mathematics educators in France, has a related phenomenology of typical didactical effects such as the Topaze effect, the Jourdain effect, the Papy effect, the Dienes effect, and the metacognitive shift-all of which illustrate how the didactical contract constrains classroom interactions. CONCLUSION Part of the new knowledge and insight that should emerge from the TME program will be meta-knowledge about current knowledge and research practice. That meta-knowledge will have to be related to the existing implicit</page><page sequence="5">50 A Systems Approach meta-knowledge that accompanies all our knowledge and practice. The complementarity principle applies as well to the relation between knowledge and meta-knowledge. On the one hand, meta-knowledge is a product of development and evolution; on the other hand, it is their indispensable precondition. This interrelationship cannot be described and understood as a closed and coherent system. Only the dynamic development of these in- terdependencies can produce simultaneous progress in both knowledge and meta-knowledge in mathematics education. REFERENCES Bauersfeld, H. (1980).
