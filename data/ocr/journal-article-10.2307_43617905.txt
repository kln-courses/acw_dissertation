<plain_text><page sequence="1">Inter- and transdisciplinary university: a systems approach to education and innovation Erich Jantsch A heritage of "autonomous" science and higher education Current discussions about university reform usually start at the wrong level, focusing either on problems of operating existing types of universities or on innova- tion in the didactic approaches and curriculum re- form. In other words, tactical and strategic questions are debated before policy - namely the role of edu- cation as an institution of society - has been made explicit. With the focus on higher education, there is also an intimate link between science and education and their institutional roles in society to be explored beforehand. Generally speaking, the obsolete state of theoretical thinking about the roles of science and education is to a large extent, due to a fixation on the search for assumed inherent organizing principles and criteria, valid a priori and independent of social activity - essentially a static view, which may have been con- sonant with past cultural patterns and states of society, but certainly is "out of tune" with the world of today. This fixation may be regarded as one of the principal factors enhancing the resistance to change of the cur- rent institutional and instrumental patterns of the uni- versity. On the other hand, the dissatisfaction of stu- dents and parts of the faculty with the "autonomous' elite approach of science and higher education forces a reconsideration of their institutional roles. We are baffled by the sudden appearance of pres- sures for change in the educational system by student unrest and by the notion that the current type of edu- cation may no longer be relevant. We are confused by the degrading side effects of technology on the sys- tems of human living, in the cities as well as within the natural environment. And we are ridden with doubts about the effectiveness of decision-making processes dominated by short-range and linear thinking and about the piecemeal and passive way in which sci- entists and engineers respond to them. Through its three functions - education, research, and service - the university is deeply affected by all of these pres- sures for change. To live with them, to absorb them and even make use of them, requires a new purpose and a new structure for the university. Looking at changes, and pressures for change, in all three of the primary functions of the university, we may, inter alia , discern the following important trends: - Education: From training for well-defined, single- track careers and professions (by duplicatinģ existing skills) toward an education which enables judgment of complex and dynamically changing situations - in other words, geared to the continuous self-renewal of human capabilities, with emphasis shifting from "know-how" to "know-what." - Research : From discipline-oriented research over pluri- and interdisciplinary research toward re- search on complex dynamic systems - or, from re- search on the fundamental level and the perfection of specific technologies to the organization of society and technology in a systems context. Dr Jantsch is currently Richard Merton Professor at the Tech- nical University, Hanover, Germany. While developing some of the concepts reported in this paper, he held a visiting ap- pointment as Research Associate at the Massachusetts In- stitute of Technology.

A synopsis of the pressures for change, as recogniz- ed above for the individual functions of the university, and those for change in society at large, yields a picture of powerful forces which act disruptively with- in the existing structures, but seem to converge rea- sonably well in their ultimate meanings and implica- tions. The new purpose of the university may readily be found in this area of convergence of reason. It may be expressed as the new purpose of the institution itself, not of its members. The new purpose implies that the university has to become a political institution in the broadest sense, interacting with government (at all jurisdictional levels) and industry in the planning and design of society's systems, and in particular in controlling the outcomes of the introduction of technology into these systems. The university must engage itself in this task as an institution, not through the individual members of its community. The university ought to become society's strategic center for investigating the boundaries and elements of the recognized as well as of the emerging "joint systems" of society and technology, and for working out alternative propositions for planning aimed at the healthy and dynamically stable design of such sys- tems. The major changes which this new purpose will bring to the university, include the following ones: - Principal orientation toward sociotechnological systems design and engineering at a high level, lead- ing to emphasis on general organizing principles and methods rather than specialized knowledge, both in education and research. - Emphasis on purposeful work by the students rather than on training. - Organization by outcome-oriented categories rather than by inputs of science and technology, and emphasis on long-range outcomes. With the new purpose, the education, research, and service functions of the university, which have increas- ingly become more widely separated, will again merge and, in fact, become one. This emerging unity cor- responds to an integral view of the education/innova- tion system which will be elaborated in the following section. The education innovation system The traditional dissection of knowledge and knowl- edge transfer into a variety of disciplines has been developed from the angle of view that it should be possible to arrive at a mechanistic explanation of the world as it is by putting empirical observation into a logical context. Disciplinarity in science is essentially a static principle which becomes meaningless if con- sidered in the framework of a purposive system. It is no wonder that in a time when science is increasingly understood as a basis for or even an integral aspect of creative human action, the emphasis shifts to more or less interdisciplinary approaches. However, it has not yet become fully clear what interdisciplinarity and the intermediate steps toward it really mean. Above all, interdisciplinarity has to be understood as a teleological and normative concept. We must ask: Interdisciplinarity to what end? It involves the organ- ization of science toward an end, in other words the linking of adjacent hierarchical levels in the educa- tion/innovation system, as sketched in Fig. 1. The various steps of cooperation and coordination among disciplines, as they are currently discussed with a view to educational needs, may now be defined in the following way (see Fig. 2): - Multidisciplinarity: A variety of disciplines, offer- ed simultaneously, but without making explicit pos- sible relationships between them. - Pluridisciplinarity: The juxtaposition of various disciplines, usually at the same hierarchical level (i.e., empirical or pragmatic), grouped in such a way as to enhance the relationships between them. - Crossdisciplinarity : The axiomatics of one disci- pline are imposed upon other disciplines at the same hierarchical level, thereby creating a rigid polarization across disciplines toward a disciplinary axiomatics. - Interdisciplinarity: A common axiomatics for a group of related disciplines is defined at the next higher hierarchical level, thereby introducing a sense of purpose; more specifically, we may distinguish be- tween teleological interdisciplinarity at and between the empirical and pragmatic levels and subleveis, nor- mative interdisciplinarity, signifying the important step from the pragmatic to the normative level (where the question of "good" and "bad" is raised), and pur- posive interdisciplinarity, bridging from the normative to the purposive level. - Transdisciplinarity: The coordination of all discip- lines and interdisciplines in the education/innovation system on the basis of a generalized axiomatics (intro- duced from the purposive level) and an emerging epistemologica! pattern. The education/innovation system, as sketched in Fig. 1, is built from the bottom level upwards. This is inevitable since, in a multilevel multigoal system the upper organizational levels cannot achieve anything without an orchestra. On the other hand, this means that two major obstacles in the way to inter- and trans- disciplinarity have to be overcome: one is the rigidity of disciplines and disciplinary concepts and axiomatics developed at the lower levels; the other one is the ap- plication of lower-level concepts and axiomatics to higher levels. Both obstacles, indeed, prove very severe in the development of a meaningful social sci- ence and in current approaches toward an interdisci- liki sties 193, Dec. /97/ 431</page><page sequence="3">Horizontal Organizing Languages: Pirr «- Anthropology - / Values N.

Branching lines between levels and subleveis indicate possible forms of interdisciplinary coordination. plinary social technology, as will be briefly discussed below. The empirical level in Fig. 1, with logic as its "or- ganizing language," may be subdivided into three bodies of science which all developed on the basis of empirical observation and logical interpretation: (a) physical sciences, with the traditional disciplines; (b) life sciences, which occupy a special position and overlap both empirical and pragmatic levels, also ex- tend from basic knowledge up to complex biological systems and thus extend over both organizational levels; and (c) psycho-sciences, which include psycho- logy and the behavioral sciences as well as aspects of human perception and creative expression, such as the arts and religions. These sciences aim at describ- ing the world as it is and at being "objective," a con- cept which is at least doubtful in the domain of the psychosciences. Interdisciplinary types of teleological coordination have become fruitful particularly between hierarchical levels within the physical sciences as well as between physical and life sciences (e.g., bio- chemistry on the one hand, molecular biology on the other). The pragmatic level with cybernetics as common "organizing language," represents a higher level or organization and may be subdivided into: (a) physical technology, embracing many hierarchical subleveis from basic technology over simple products to com- plex technological systems together with their func- tional interactions with societal systems; (b) the more systematic part of the life sciences, and natural eco- logy, which has been successfully used to develop agriculture; and (c) social ecology, or simply culture, based on psychosocial sciences, comprising, inter alia , history, sociology, linguistics, and communica- tion in general, communicative aspects of the arts, microeconomics, political science (in its narrow prag- matic meaning), cultural aspects of anthropology, and the traditional ethics of the individual. Or, rather, there ought to be such a science of social ecology, applicable in a pragmatic way. The normative level, with planning as its "organiz- ing language," deals with social systems design, bring- ing into focus social systems or ecological technology. It has as its core Churchman's1 "ethics of whole sys- tems" and branches out into aspects of social systems technology such as law, macroeconomics, and institu- tional innovation. Typically, it focuses on large social and man/environment systems, ekistics, and a variety of "joint systems" of society and technology.2 Few of the domains at this level have yet found valid frame- works - ekistics may be farthest advanced in this respect - and the current concepts of law and macro- economics hardly meet the interdisciplinary challenge posed to them in the technological era. It is at this level that the broad conceptualization of man's active role in shaping his own and the planet's future unfolds. The purposive level, finally, brings values and value dynamics into play through interactive fields such as philosophy, arts, and religions, structuring in an inter- disciplinary way some of the domains at the normative level. The "organizing language" at this level ought to be anthropology in its most profound sense, the science of how to create an anthropomorphic world and how mankind may become capable of surviving dynamically changing environments. That most of 432 Ekistics 193 , Dec . 1971</page><page sequence="4">anthropology today is not much more than an empirical behavioral science, illuminates drastically the con- fusion created in modern science by the traditional cultural postulate of "knowledge per se" and the cor- responding emphasis on empiricism. It appears futile to discuss what, in the education/ innovation system, should be called science and what not. In a narrow, positivistic sense, the notion of sci- ence applies only to the lowest systems level. Whether this science is organized and coordinated again by science or by categories of thought, which are given other names, is a matter of arbitrary definition. Essen- tial is only that inter- and transdisciplinary organiza- tion and coordination of science are necessary for education and innovation to follow the purpose of so- ciety's self-renewal. The horizontal "organizing languages" of logic, cy- bernetics, planning, and anthropology, in order of in- creasing systemicity, intermesh with the vertical "or- ganizing languages" of general systems theory (de- ductive) and organization theory (inductive). If the education/innovation system is viewed as a purposive system for the self-renewal of society, as outlined above, we should, in Ozbekhan's words,3 "be able to investigate in a more orderly way than has hitherto been possible, whether methodologies arising from anthropology and general systems theory - both of which deal with phenomena that pertain to whole groups - might not be forged into a methodological structure for planning." With such a structure for plan- ning it will then be possible to link the normative, prag- matic, and empirical levels in an interdisciplinary way and ultimately aim at a genuine transdisciplinary co- ordination, i.e., at managing the education/innovation system in an integral way. Current approaches toward normative interdisciplinarity in the university Most of the current university experiments emerging from the social side of the system and expressing themselves in Schools of Public Affairs, Public Policy Programs, or Programs in Policy Sciences, constitute essentially crossdisciplinary approaches. Instead of one traditional discipline, a group of "soft" disciplines may dominate and provide concepts, principles, and methods which are applied to the entire pragmatic level of the education/innovation system. A good ex- ample is Harvard's Program of Graduate Education for Public Service which started in the fall of 1969. It is structured into the four main areas of analytical meth- ods, economic theory, statistical methods, and politi- cal analysis, whereby existing "modules" of concepts and methods, mainly pertaining to economics, are employed; not the contents, only the combination is supposed to be new. The implicit assumption here is that a rationale can be found, to which the "hard" sciences and technology may be subjected without being part of it. In other words, science and techno- logy are seen as "neutral" tools which may be put to any use, implying also an unbroken faith in sequential problem-solving, i.e., a nonsystemic approach. The "seamless web"4 into which human society has been transformed by technology cannot be grasped in this way. The first steps toward a normative interdisciplinary approach in the university, i.e., a link between the prag- matic and normative levels in Fig. 1, are taken where basic themes of society or need areas are recognized and accepted for a fundamental reorganization^ the educational and research disciplines involved. The scientific-technical and the psychosocial sides of the education/innovation system become integrated in this approach. It is quite obvious that only universities with well-developed structures on both sides can take this approach. The discussion whether universities should deal with technology, or Institutes of Techno- logy should adopt social science - a discussion ^which, in Europe, is still dominated by a belief in a fundamental polarization between scientific-technical and humanistic cultures (C.P. Snow's "two cultures") - finds its resolution in the normative systems ap- proach. On the other hand, it still presents a hard-to- overcome obstacle on the university's way to inter- disciplinarity reaching up to the normative level.

Signi- ficant large-scale examples are: - The College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences at the Davis campus of the University of California, organized in five broad areas of systemic nature, including a systems approach to environmental problems. - The Theme Colleges of Environmental Sciences. Human Biology, Community Sciences, and Creative Communication at the Green Bay campus of the Uni- versity of Wisconsin, currently geared to undergradu- ate education, with graduate programs in preparation. - The Program in Environmental Science and En- gineering at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences of Columbia University. - The planned graduate College on the Human Environment at the Madison campus of the University of Wisconsin. - A University of Planning (or Environmental De- sign) at Solothurn (Switzerland), currently in a pre- paratory stage. Other structures focus mainly on research and fre- quently assume the form of interdisciplinary centers in which faculty members and graduate students, pur- suing their "formal" careers in traditional depart- ments, may find a "second home." Examples are vari- ous urban centers, the Harvard Program on Techno- logy and Science, the Center for Research on Utiliza- tion of Scientific Knowledge at the University of Michi- gan at Ann Arbor, the Center for the Study of Science in Human Affairs at Columbia University, the Center for Integrative Studies at the State University of New York at Binghamton, and the Program of Policy Studies in Science and Technology at George Washington University. A special research domain ( Sonderfor - ' schungsbereich) "Planning and Organization of Socio- technological Systems" has been proposed in the Federal Republic of Germany to be established at one or two universities selected for a "focal" approach (most likely at the Technical University, Hanover). The weakness of many of these centers lies in their passive attitudes, which result in their failure to attempt to organize and stimulate research on systematic prob- lems to the degree necessary in view of the complex and interdisciplinary character of such research. To some extent, a certain dominance or even crossdisci- plinary claim from the social side may be observed to sneak in, somewhat distorting the original aim. Of the greatest significance among the steps taken toward normative interdisciplinarity are experimen- tal university programs attempting an integrated edu- cation/research/service approach. Engineering de- partments of a conventional type may engage in "tech- nology assessment" (i.e., technological forecasting in a social systems context), as has been done at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). To some extent, Schools or Departments of Architecture. Urban and Regional Planning, or Environmental De- sign, have always been explicitly or implicitly systems- minded, and have developed halfway toward norma- tive interdisciplinarity dealing with important areas of social technology. The Athens Center of Ekistics (Greece), with its international mixture of students, may serve here as a small, but stimulating model of a truly interdisciplinary education/research approach involving the normative level. A transdisciplinary structure for the university The essential characteristic of a transdisciplinary ap- proach is the coordination of activities at all levels of the education/innovation system. Even the more imag- inative proposals for new structures and curricular patterns in the university usually stop short of con- ceiving a coordinated system. Harold Linstone5 pro- poses educational strata of pluridisciplinary internal structure and increasing systemicity to be crossed by students as they advance in their studies; it is then presumably up to the student himself to form his own personal interdisciplinary links. This section outlines a possible transdisciplinary structure for the university which the author has tried to develop with a view to- ward the future of the Massachusetts Institute of Tech- nology.6 The basic structure of the transdisciplinary univer- sity may be conceived as being built essentially on the feedback interaction between three types of units, all three of which incorporate their appropriate version of the unified education/research/service function: - Systems design laboratories (in particular, socio- technological systems design laboratories), bringing together elements of the physical and the social sci- ences, engineering and management, the life sciences and the humanities, law and policy sciences. Their tasks will not be sharply defined, but rather broad areas will be assigned to them such as "Ecological Systems in Natural Environments," "Ecological Sys- tems in Man-Made Environments," "Information and Communication Systems," "T ransportation/Com- munication Systems," "Public Health Systems," "Sys- tems of Urban Living," "Educational Systems," and the like. These broad areas will, and should, overlap. Apart from designing and engineering specific sys- tems, these laboratories will also have the task of long- range forecasting, identifying aspects and boundaries of systems emerging from the simulation of complex dynamic situations. They will be responsible for ex- ploratory and experimental systems building at smaller scale, and they will provide opportunities for a through- flow of professionals for their self-renewal. - Function-oriented departments, taking an out- come-oriented look at the functions technology per- forms in societal systems, and dealing flexibly with a variety of specific technologies which all might con- tribute to the same function. Examples of such func- tions are "Housing," "Urban Transportation," "Power Generation and Transmission," "Automation and Pro- 434 Ekistics 193, Dec. 197 1</page><page sequence="6">cess Control," "Educational Technology," "Tele- communication," "Information Technology," "Food Production and Distribution," etc. These functions are more clearly defined and constitute more stable "modules" than the sociotechnological systems of which they are facets. They constitute need categories which elicit the response of different technological options. Thinking in these categories implies break- ing out of the linearity of specific technological devel- opment lines, and keeping the view open into a longer- range future. Education in the framework of these systemic functions in society will become ever more relevant, with industry increasingly adopting a cor- responding organizational framework.7 Apart from developing technological options, which come under the heading of these functions, these departments will also emphasize systems analysis of the effects and side effects of selecting specific technologies for satisfying needs in these areas, forecasting which will be more properly technological forecasting in its broad connotation, and assessment of the "systems effectiveness" of technologies in the context of so- cietal systems. - Discipline-oriented departments of a more fami- liar type, but with a somewhat different scope, com- paratively smaller and more sharply focused on the interdisciplinary potential (or "valency") of the disci- plines. These departments will be mainly set up in the basic scientific disciplines at the empirical level of the education/innovation system and in the structural sciences, including such new fields as computer sci- ence. The three layers of organizational structure focus on the interdisciplinary coordination of the purposive/ normative, normative/pragmatic, and pragmatic/em- pirical levels of the education/innovation system. The accent is here on the links between pairs of systems levels - in other words on interdisciplinary organiz- ing principles and methods - rather than on the sub- stance, the accumulated knowledge at the systems levels. Figure 3 shows schematically how the struc- tures of the transdisciplinary university relate to the levels of the education/innovation system. The feedback interaction between the three types of structural units in the transdisciplinary university is sketched in Table 1. It is evident that policy sciences in the "full meaning" outlined in the preceding sec- tions, will be an important aspect for the work in the systems design laboratories. We may then envisage a university in which some students go through discipline- and function-oriented departments only, and others go through all three types of structural units. As the latter proceed from undergraduate to graduate and doctoral work they will shift the emphasis of their studies from discipline- and function-oriented departments more and more to the systems design laboratories, at the same time getting increasingly involved with purposeful work in technology and actual sociotechnological systems design and engineering, which will become a full-time (and paid) engagement during the doctoral work. Work phases and "absorptive" phases may alternate, with the need for theoretical learning being enhanced and guided by work. In essence, students will not go through these structural types in sequence, but inter- act with them simultaneously during their studies. Such a university will turn out people with a widely varying education, ranging from specialist scientists through mission- and function-oriented scientists and Education/ Innovation System University Structure /' Purposive Level / / Systems Design Laboratories Normative Level ' ^ ■ A / t A ' Function-Oriented / Departments Pragmatic Level y ^ ^ ] ļ_ ] j~ ¿ ņ ' - Tjc - I I "1 Discipline-Oriented / // Tjc v' I '' N.

The systems design laboratories will also play an important role in the continuous education of professionals, who probably will come back to the university in much greater numbers than today. One may believe that the outlined three-level struc- ture will give the education function greatly increased flexibility in many respects - for specialized as well as broad (but not superficial) education, for changing tracks, for participation in various actual projects and in various qualities, for combining student and adult education, for stimulating leadership and profession- alism, for education geared to various types of careers in the public and private sectors. An important aspect concerns new dimensions in learning which may be opened up by the change from receiving training to doing useful work. With the uni- versity structure outlined here, education will take on more and more the form of self-education, and only part of it with the help of "teachers." A student work- ing in a systems design laboratory will be able to judge for himself what working and learning experience he needs from the function- and discipline-oriented de- partments, to which he will go back part of his time. He will be able, to a relatively large extent, to work out his curriculum himself, and to set his own educational goals and priorities. Education will move away from the stereotypes of today and become increasingly self-education in an environment which provides an infinite variety of possibilities. This will be possible, because the student's work can be judged directly from contribution to useful work. He may, therefore, graduate and obtain higher degrees without being examined by the rigors charac- teristic of the university today. No grading system will be necessary to measure the development of his capa- bilities. He may .not even write a thesis by himself, but make corresponding contributions to team work. Providing academic careers for all three types of structural units will give immense freedom to the entre- preneurs, and may also change the traditional status system of the university. As a matter of fact, the uni- versity professor, as we know him today, may almost vanish, or become almost indistinguishable from the students and professionals, at least in the systems design laboratories and, to some extent, in the func- tion-oriented departments. What we call faculty to- day, may be the entrepreneurial leaders of the systems design laboratories tomorrow, and the through-flow of younger and older people would be identified today as students moving on in their studies, and profes- sionals moving in and out of the university in their al- most continuous education. The enhanced "know-what" will not strangle the freedom of research, but, on the contrary, will give it deeper meaning. The interaction between the three structural levels of the new university may, for the first time, lead to the investigation and active shaping of science policy in a rational and systematic (because systemic) way, and to its planning and implementation 436 Ekistics 193 , Dec. 1971</page><page sequence="8">in a decentralized way through the university. This is what is called in this paper the role of the university as a political institution. It will not be easy for the university to maintain its vitality and continuously renew itself in the erosive political process. For the first time, the university will expose itself to full public criticism, and initially suffer considerable shock from the sudden loss of its protection behind the faceless mask of "objective" science. Already the fundamen- tal switch toward broad, horizontal thinking across established disciplines will inevitably lead to a tran- sitory crisis period for the university which has de- veloped its excellence by penetrating deeply into sharply defined, more or less independently pursued disciplines.8 However, there does not seem to be any alternative if a rational, one may even say an eco- logical, approach to science and technology is con- sidered mandatory, as indeed it has to be in the pre- sent situation. The university will have to maintain close connec- tion with many organizational elements of society, with government at all jurisdictional levels, with re- search institutes, and with industry. It will stimulate and maintain the information flow in the triangle go- vernment-industry-university, and interact actively within this triangle in the planning for society at large. Such interactions may include consortia, joint ven- tures, prime and subcontracting, consultancies, etc., with government, industry, other universities, and research institutes. The systems design laboratories in the transdisciplinary university will, in many in- stances, lead this process by developing innovative design proposals. The task of turning the university from a passive servant of various elements of society and of individual and even egoistic ambitions of the members of its community into an active institution in the process of planning for society implies profound change in pur- pose, thought, institutional and individual behavior. It will give the university freedom, dignity, and signi- ficance - qualities which have become grossly dis- torted in a process in which the university is used, but is not expected and not permitted to participate ac- tively.
