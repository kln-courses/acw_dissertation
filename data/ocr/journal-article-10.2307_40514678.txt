He had been born a prince in faraway Kapilavastu, at the foot of the Himalayas, but as a young man renounced his birthright to follow the path toward enlightenment that had been set for him by karmic destiny over the course of multiple past lives. Eventually, after years of fruitless ascetic tribulation, he sat beneath a pipal tree, having bathed in the nearby Nairafijanã River, and sank into deep medi- tation followed by realization. He emerged a Buddha- an "awakened" being that has been "nirvanized" and thus liberated from the chain of rebirth and suffering. But he postponed entry into nirvana and instead became a mendicant preacher, teaching the path of liberation and perfect knowledge that he had realized beneath the pipal tree.

As death approached he lay quiet while a throng of disciples and followers gathered around him, watching as his body turned the golden hue of a Buddha and was then reabsorbed whence it had come, to the sound of the river and wails of grief. Death of Sãkyamuni in the collection of the Yale University Art Gallery captures this moment and brings us into the circle of grief beneath the sala trees (frontispiece). It was painted in Japan in the early fourteenth century, in ink and colors on four widths of silk mounted in the hanging-scroll format, to be hung against the wall of a Buddhist chapel as the object of focus during services recalling the life and teachings of Sãkyamuni. Nearly fifteen hundred years and thousands of miles sepa- rate the painting from the event it depicts, yet it speaks across the millennia to a universal theme. The extinction of the Buddha from the world - his parinirvãria, or "final nirvana" - was catastrophic, leaving an absence where once there had been a beloved teacher. Various ways to call back memories of the Buddha helped fill the void. These included relic worship, biographical narrative, and a multifaceted complex of visual and spatial 45</page><page sequence="3">arts that accompanied and gave shape to the spread of Buddhist teachings and practices out of India. Over time, the pipal tree at what is now Bodhgaya, the riverbank at Kusina- gara, the face of Sakyamuni - all found themselves utterly transformed in the con- ventions of a widespread visual language that sought to recall Buddha. The process was that of "a swift main current of transmis- sion," as Alexander Coburn Soper once put it, "fed by lively tributaries whose waters were not fully blended."1 In the process of transmission, the pic- torial imagination of Buddhism - its virtual space in the endeavor to reimagine Buddha in the world - met the real spaces of its execution in concrete and material human terms. Understood in this context, Death ofSãkyamuni offers insights into the nature and practices of Buddhist art. It pictures a literally earth-shattering event - the moment that Buddha disappeared - of such centrality that it is among the first events described in the earliest canonical literature of Buddhism. And it does so through skillful means shaped in the real time and real space of medieval Japan, about which the painting has much to reveal, even as it evokes a universal desire to see the Buddha again. SOME SPECIFICS Death ofSãkyamuni presents us with a rivet- ing scene done with style and panache by a confident master painter. We see Buddha on the handsome couch that is his deathbed, tilted toward us in axonometric perspective beneath a canopy of leaves formed by four pairs of trees, two of the pairs a ghostly white in color (fig. i). His face is a study in repose in keeping with the auspicious signs that identify him as a Buddha: blue- tinged black curly hair over a cranial protuberance, the spot between the brows, elongated earlobes. He lies on his right side with his knees slightly bent and his head pillowed on his right arm, his skin golden against the lush red of his robe with the blues and greens of the undergarments glimpsed along the hem and at the chest. The cloth bundle behind his head, with a design of rampant lions in gold against a blue and red ground, holds his belongings; his staff leans against a tree trunk nearby. In the distance, beyond the trees and the green earth, rivulets of the swiftly flowing water are seen. A colorful crowd of figures encircles the Buddha, as if drawn by centripetal force to the colossus that is his body on the couch. Included are sixty-seven anthropomorphic and zooanthropomorphic figures taking form as bodhisattvas, gods, celestials, demons, men, and women; and thirty-two animals representing thirty genera, including a myth- ical water rhinoceros. In the sky above the canopy of trees, on a steep diagonal descent on a cloud, an additional group of seven women, one man, and a child makes its way toward the crowd below. The figures clus- tered around the couch take their place in descending order of size from the center - around the numinous form of the giant Buddha- to the periphery at the bottom of the picture plane, where animals gather with their backs to us. Few in the crowd stand upright, and most are shown kneeling or prostrate. A paroxysm of emotion engulfs the scene. But for the seven bodhisattvas, who have gained Buddhist wisdom and are serene in their knowledge, there is anguish and despair. A white elephant writhes on its back, grasping in its trunk a lotus flower for the Buddha. The tumultuous scene with stillness at its center is executed with persuasive force by a painter of sound formal and technical judgment. Motion and agitation characterize the visual field. We see a daring sweep of saturated primary hues bound to their forms by sinuous lines of ink. A sea of gesture envelops the figure on the couch; the painter deploys his deft brush to show us the many faces of grief- eyes reddened by tears, but also eyes alert to their surroundings. Like the Fig. i.

Captured in the light, the gold glitters against the fields of decorative color. The effect is one of finely worked brocade or a tapestry. This gorgeous planar surface, kin to the embroidered wall hangings that were a staple of Buddhist visual culture from earliest times, is also a marvelous space. The painter has us looking down into the scene around the couch, through the upward thrust of the trees toward their canopy, as the couch is rotated toward us in our purchase among the animals. We enter a three-dimensional zone that takes form against the soft green of earth. The tree trunks and branches are modeled in darks and lights; the same is true of the drapery folds, which wrap around bodies in convincingly volumetric ways. The twists and turns of fluttering scarves accentuate the illusion of depth. The figures themselves turn and bend in space, whether squeezed around the couch or convulsed upon the ground. Death ofSãkyamuni, in its three- dimensional virtuosity and theatricality, is appropriate to its subject and to the religious text from which it derives. The painting is based on two Chinese translations of the Mahäparinirvana-sütra, or Great Discourse on Extinction, a Sanskrit text that recorded the last sermon of the Buddha.2 Popularly known as the Nirvana Sütra (Nehangyõ in Japanese), it opens with an excited descrip- tion of the parinirvãna scene. The Buddha has announced his impending extinction at dawn on the fifteenth day of the second month, on the bank of the river Ajitavatï (Hiranyavatï), in Kusinagara, "where the twin sal trees stood."3 His closest disciples have gathered round, among them his beloved cousin Änanda, as the trees turn white. A huge crowd descends on Kusinagara from all corners of the universe, leaving not even a rabbits hair of space. Bodhisattvas and gods come, kings of men and gods and animals, disciples and ascetics, royal patrons, would-be competitors, even the demons who had tormented Sãkyamuni while he sat in meditation. The sun and moon fade from the sky in the brilliant light emitted by the Buddha and the gods around him. He is silent before their cries and questions. Offer- ings of flowers, food, and fragrant wood for the cremation bier pile up around his couch. The iconography of Death ofSãkyamuni, drawn primarily from the first chapter of the Nirvana Sütra, belongs to a venerable tradi- tion of imagery believed to have first been given form in the second century ce. in Gandhãra (northwestern India, encompass- ing present-day Pakistan). This iconography traveled eastward along the trade routes of the Eurasian land mass in the wake of the diffusion of a diverse body of Buddhist teachings and practices known as the Mahãyãna, or "Great Vehicle," that would become the dominant form of Buddhism in China, Tibet, Bhutan, Korea, and Japan. The oldest example of a parinirvãna scene in Japan is the small clay tableau dated 711 in the pagoda at the temple Höryüji in Nara. Analysis and interpretation of Death of Sãkyamuni provides a glimpse into the mul- tifaceted nature of Buddhist cultural pro- duction in medieval Japan. As an act of the imagination in ink and colors on the surface of four widths of silk - a pictorialization - the painting beckons us into the special time and place of the parinirvãna, a virtual realm that is at once visionary and infinite. But this extraordinary realm takes form on the sur- face of the silk as the production of a painter utterly rooted in the real world of four- teenth-century Japan. In either case, the painting exemplifies the persuasive force of enjoyment, entertainment, and rhetoric in the process of Buddhist edification. PICTORIALIZING THE PARINIRVÃNA The bundle next to the Buddhas head, and his staff propped against the tree, are poignant reminders that his journey has 48</page><page sequence="6">corne to an end. They do not merely point to the life that the Buddha has led in the physi- cal body of a human being, now seized by devastating illness in its final moments, but also evoke a long journey over an immense expanse of time through many previous exis- tences. In other words, Death of Sãkyamuni presents us with an uncanny moment in time and space. We see a dying man, who is also the Buddha reaching extinction after many eons of karmic evolution, and an icon in the process of its becoming. In the crowd around Buddha's couch are many people from the life he lived as the son of the nobleman Suddhodana of the Sãkya clan. His half-brother Nanda slumps behind him near the center of the couch with his head buried in his arms. Across from Nanda, hunched forward with his back to us, is the wandering ascetic Subhadra, who heard the Buddha's dying sermon and was awakened. Below the couch we see Änanda in a dead faint, while the elderly Aniruddha - the dis- ciple who fell asleep in front of the Buddha and vowed never to sleep again - attempts to revive him. An old woman, a widow from Vaisãll with nothing to offer but tears, weeps over Buddha's feet; Änanda has allowed her to come forward through the crowd of mourners. She is surrounded by figures prob- ably representing the aristocratic patrons of the Buddha - the Licchavis of Vaisãlí, the Mallas of Kusinagara - who in a few days will vie heatedly for his relics. At the far outer edge of this group is the blacksmith Cunda with food piled high on a platter (fig. 2). His cooking at Pãvã brought on the dysentery that has now resulted in the Buddha's death, and he holds in his hands the last offering that the Buddha will receive. Absent from the scene is the Buddha's closest disciple, Mahãkãsyapa, who is yet to learn that his master has died. Both Donohashi Akio and Izumi Takeo have commented on the spatiotemporal weirdness of the parinirvãna scene.4 Out of the sky comes aakyamuni's mother, Queen Mãyã, who has been dead since his early Fig. 2.

She is escorted by Anirud- dha - the same Aniruddha who is attempt- ing to revive Ãnanda below.5 Just behind Aniruddha is a childlike figure holding a bundle similar to the one behind the Buddha's head: is this child the Buddha? Into this strange realm, drawn like particles to an imploding star into a space that the Nirvana Sütra describes as the size of a mote,6 comes the vivid cast of characters whose lives have intersected with that of áãkyamuni. Many have been present in the lives of other Buddhas past or future. Six bejeweled bodhisattvas in crowns and flow- ing garments cluster near the head of the Buddha, as appropriate to the state of advanced attainment that is evident in their peaceful expressions and restrained grief. Among them we expect to find Kãsyapa, the Buddha's principal interlocutor in the Nirvana Sütra; perhaps he is the one holding the bowl of lotus buds. The seventh bod- hisattva, Ksitigarbha, kneels unobtrusively at the far end of the couch near the Buddha's feet (fig. 4). We see him, dressed as a monk, in profile in his soft green surplice; he is holding a magical jewel - the wish-granting cintãmani- and a priest's staff. Among the mourners at the back of the couch, just behind Nanda, is a gruff-looking figure in armor with hands clenched in prayer, his red-rimmed eyes fixed upon the Buddha. This is the Zeus-like Indra - Sakra Devãndrãnam, "Chief of the Gods and Celestials" - whose formidable devotion to the Buddha is backed by military might and brash character (and in whose heaven Queen Maya has been living). The tenth-century wooden statue of Taishakuten - as Sakra Devãndrãnam is known to Japanese Bud- dhism - now in the Yale University Art Gallery shows Indra in his tutelary role as protector of Buddhism (fig. 5). The blue- faced figure next to Indra on the right is his loyal retainer Vaisravana, who has come to Kusinagara at the head of a huge division of celestial gods and demons; in his blue hand he holds the stupa reliquary with which he is identified. Vaisravana's men can be glimpsed here and there around the couch in their handsome armor, among them the guardian god-kings of the cardinal directions. The mortal enemies of Indra and Vaisravana have also come to Kusinagara. Not paces away by the corner of the couch, framed by the whitening trees, is the vivid red form of Vemacitra, king of the Asuras. With three heads and six arms (two of them holding the sun and moon), this wild- looking red king epitomizes the negative energy of the Asuras - a kind of demonic anti-matter. He is the archenemy of Indra; their forces have seen battle since time began. But here, before the dying Buddha, they share a kind of détente. Behind Vemaci- tra one of his minions glares suspiciously at the crowd anyway. Perhaps his apprehen- sion is heightened by the presence nearby of the leaders of the snake-humans and half- reptiles, who protect the Buddha. We see the king of the Nãgas, whose magnificent dragon body coils over him, holding a giant pearl in its claws; he and the dragon, as one, 50</page><page sequence="8">Fig. 5.

A member of another zooanthropomorphic species, celestial entertainers known as the Kimnara, mingles with the birds although it is part human (fig. 6). Here it presents a single lotus blossom; in a thirteenth-century lacquer painting at the Yale University Art Gallery, a Kimnara holds in its hands an offering of lotus buds in a bowl (fig. 7). The creature belongs to the ranks of the Gandharvas, and other heavenly musicians come to serenade the Buddha with celebratory songs. These hybrid forms - mixtures of body parts and genera - point to the contingencies and contradictions in the scene around the Buddha's couch. We know that Indra and Vemacitra are bound to fight again; the mag- nificent dragon with its giant pearl changes shape before our eyes into a man with a bowl of marvelous foods; we see - perhaps - the Buddha coming down from some supra-ter- restrial palace to mourn his own extinction. In an imaginative maneuver worthy of Jorge Luis Borges, everything is slightly out of syn- chrony but perfectly calibrated. The trees have flowered out of season, to cover the Buddha's dying form with petals, themselves dying in the process - all condensed into one moment of time. On the one hand there is proper Buddhist decorum: stillness, detach- ment, silence, order, everyone (almost) in the right place. On the other there is pandemo- nium and noise, convulsive emotion, a sense of something out of control. It is as if the boundless and the limited combine in one instant: the endless time of the awakened Buddha surrounded by the raw crush of sentient existence around him. In Death ofSãkyamuni, the work of pic- torialization has given shape to a Buddhist audacity. The Buddha on his couch, in whom the eternal and the finite coexist, marks the interstitial moment - a funda- mental contradiction in terms - around which the painting unfolds as an act of pic- torial imagination. We see the body on the couch against the green ground of the insen- tient earth, on which has been inscribed, as on the silk itself, a virtual realm that has materialized exquisitely out of nowhere. In one glance we see the Buddha, a painting of the Buddha, and an icon, golden and placid, whose referent recedes into nothingness. PAINTING THE PARINIRVÃNA Death ofSãkyamuni is an imposing, large- format painting with exciting images and a great story to tell. It was intended to take center stage at a Buddhist rite known as the Nirvana Service, or Nehan-e, traditionally performed on the fifteenth day of the second month of the lunar calendar. The rite is still held today and typically takes place in the main hall of a temple, with monastic and lay participants seated or kneeling before a painting of the death of the Buddha as if they have come to join the mourners in the picture. Throughout the day there are learned debates and homilies interposed with hymns and chanting. For many participants, the high point of the service is the narration of the painting. A monk stands in front of it and, using a pointer, explains the scene and its figures in terms that bring the painting to life for his listeners. The Nirvana Service had been observed in Japan for some six hundred years by the time that this Death ofSãkyamuni was painted. The rite was held at Nara's temple Kõfukuji as early as the late eighth century, where it was also called the Permanence and 52</page><page sequence="10">Fig. 8.

In the late tenth cen- tury the monk Genshin (942-1017), a pro- ponent of the Pure Land teachings that expounded salvation through devotion to the Buddha Amitãbha, wrote a popular liturgical manual for the Nirvana Service. Genshin used the manual to coordinate the service with his Assembly of the Twenty-Five Con- centrations (Nijûgo zanmai-e), 2. monthly retreat intended to prepare participants for death and deliverance through the benefi- cence of Amitãbha. In 121 5 the reform- minded monk Myõe (1172-1232), critical of the practices popularized earlier by Genshin, wrote a liturgical manual that focused on the life of áãkyamuni, with emphasis on the teachings of the Nirvana Sütra.7 Although a painted representation of the parinirvâna scene is known to have been used in the Nirvana Service at Kõfukuji, there is evidence that statuary- at least for the reclining Buddha - was the preferred medium until the late tenth century. By the eleventh century, paintings properly called Pictures of the Parinirvâna of the Buddha (Butsu nehan-e) had displaced statues; these followed a set of formal and iconographical standards that had been in place at least since the eighth century in Japan but had even deeper roots on the continent. For example, the prostrate Änanda tended by Aniruddha is seen in third-century Gandhãran narrative reliefs, as is Subhadra with his back to the viewer.8 In a sense, the same spatio temporal oddness that marks the pictorialization car- ries over into the conventions of the painting proper as a local iteration of a universal story that had been told across Eurasia for more than a millennium. Had an ancient Gandharan viewer found himself standing in front of Yale's Death ofSãkyamuni, it is likely that he would have recognized what he was looking at. Two conventions, which we may call Type I and Type II, are known for two- dimensional representations of the death of the Buddha after the eleventh century in Japan. Type I is exemplified by the famous Death of Sãkyamuni of io$6 at the temple Kongõbuji (Mount Kõya). Spare and static, its picture plane dominated by the Buddha flat on his back on the couch, the painting typifies the compositional approach that was popular in the eleventh and twelfth cen- turies. Type II became prevalent in the thir- teenth century, eclipsing Type I as the norm. Its identifying features include a smaller figure of the Buddha relative to the picture plane; a large number of mourners, includ- ing animals; heightened emotional content; and the appearance of Queen Mãyã in the sky. The Yale Death ofSãkyamuni is a repre- sentative example of Type II. The Type II convention emerged in tandem with a spirit of reform that swept the Buddhist establishment at the turn of the thirteenth century. Monks like Myõe sought to rid the monastic and lay commu- nities of the excesses and lack of discipline that they believed had taken hold during the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Myõe focused in particular on Sãkyamuni and the 53</page><page sequence="11">Fig. 9. Death of Sãkyamuni, Kamakura-Nanbokuchõ periods (1185-1392), 14th century.

In so doing, he challenged the influ- ential movements of his day, popular and monastic, that derived from and focused on the Lotus Sutra (Saddharmapundarika-sütra) and the Pure Land teachings as preached by Genshin and his followers. The fourteenth- century stamped print with forty-eight ink impressions of Amitäbha in the Yale Univer- sity Art Gallery (fig. 8) epitomizes the devo- tional behavior - repetitive chanting without discipline, reliance on a personal savior instead of ones own efforts - that Myõe found wanting. Each image represents one intonation of the phrase Namu Amida Butsu, "Homage to Amitäbha Buddha," and the forty-eight repetitions symbolize the forty- eight vows made by Amitäbha to save the faithful. The two inscriptions on the print also pay homage to Amitäbha and seek deliverance in his name. Nakano Genzõ has noted that Myõe, by comparison with Genshin, adhered closely to the letter of the Nirvana Sütra in composing his liturgical manual for the Nirvana Service and other rituals associated with Sãkyamuni. He sees the Type II convention as similarly embracing a new literal-mindedness toward the Nirvana Sütra and a greater sensitivity to its teachings.9 There is certainly no doubt that, as distinct from Type I, Type II closely follows the first chapter of the sutra in iconography and mood. The conspicuous increase in Type II paintings after the thir- teenth century links their production directly to the reform movement that Myõe supported. These paintings clearly had an important role to play in the revival of inter- est in áãkyamuni and the Nirvana Sütra. This is not to say that Type II paintings are all identical. A number of variants existed by the fourteenth century (as evidenced by the more than twenty major Type II paint- ings discussed by Nakano), and most can be traced to a specific temple or workshop.10 Yale's Death ofSãkyamuni belongs to a Type II variant that includes fourteenth-century paintings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York (fig. 9) and in the collection of the temple Myõhõji (Hyõgo Prefecture; fig. 10). Another painting belonging to this variant was published in the journal Kokka in 1929 as a recent acquisition by Baron Fujita Heitarõ, but has since been lost (fig. 11)." All of these works share distinctive details, including the bundle of belongings on the couch behind the Buddha's head, the group of bodhisattva figures at the head of the couch, Nanda slumping forward over the couch, Subhadra with his back turned, the Naga king with his splendid dragon head, and Cunda offering food piled on a plate. The Yale and Metropolitan paintings have in common the figure of Ksitigarbha kneeling at the edge of the couch near Subhadra, and the rendering of leaves on the trees. In composition, style, and execution, these four paintings are nearly indistinguish- able. The brushwork is consistent in all four works, especially in the articulation of drap- ery folds. A distinctive facial type, bordering on the grotesque, is seen in the mourning women; it is a physiognomy marked by drooping brows and contorted mouths. Malachite green dominates the composition, inflected by splashes of saturated red and blue flecked with gold. Although there are formal differences as well - for example, the rendering of eyes and brows for the bodhisattva figures - stylistic and technical similarities set these four paintings apart from the majority of other works of the same period. This level of correspondence is too systematic to be a matter of chance. The paintings must have come from the same source. Fortunately there is enough primary evidence to make an educated guess as to what that source was. An inscription on the reverse of the Myõhõji Death ofSãkyamuni states that it was painted in 1325 by the Buddhist painter Myõson at the request of Genbon, a nun belonging to the temple Hokkeji in Nara.12 According to Kokka, the Fujita Death of Sãkyamuni had a similar inscription stating that Myõson painted 55</page><page sequence="13">^H</page><page sequence="14">Fig. ίο.

The workshop traced its genesis to the celebrated Buddhist painter Sonchi (act. ca. 1206 -1223). Myõson was a direct descendant of Sonchi through his grandfather Kaichi.14 An inscription on the back of a portable shrine belonging to Kõfukuji and dedicated in 1340 indicates that Myõson rose to great prominence in the Buddhist painting world. The shrine houses a colorful wooden statue of Kichijöten (Sri) and paintings of Bonten (Brahma) and Taishakuten on its doors, done in a style highly reminiscent of the Yale, Metropolitan, Myõhõji, and Fujita works. The inscription states that the shrine was painted by Myõson, "Master Artist of the Painting Guild" (Edokoro daibussht).15 This means that, in 1340, Myõson was one of the most important painters of his day, and stood at the top of the hierarchy of workshops and artists that had dominated Buddhist painting for centuries from their base at Kõfukuji in the ancient Nara capital. On stylistic, technical, and iconographical grounds, it is highly likely that the Yale Death ofSãkyamuni was painted by this master artist (or at his studio) sometime between 1320 and 1340; the same case can be made for the Metropolitan work. As such, the Yale painting joins its sister works at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Myõhõji in preserving the legacy of the celebrated Nara Buddhist painters of medieval Japan - a priceless contribution to our understand- ing of what are known to history as the "Painting Workshops of the Southern Capital" (Nanto edokoró). Sometime in the early fourteenth cen- tury, a monk stood before Yale's Death of Sãkyamuni and, through skillful narration, began to weave its universal message into the world of the audience seated before it at a Nirvana Service. His task was facilitated by the skill and wit of the Nara painter who had given form to the story to be told. On the one hand, the painting drew its viewers into the virtual space of a Buddhist epiphany. They joined the circle of mourners around the Buddha's deathbed and listened to the teaching that had been given voice for hun- dreds of years. On the other, the painting delivered a preposterous and colorful spec- tacle-epitomized by the hideous green demon plunging its dagger into the ground in front of the Buddha's couch - seasoned with psychological drama and the sly humor of a self-possessed painter attentive to the human foibles of competitive grieving. The carnival atmosphere of the Buddha's death scene as described in the Nirvana Sütra has been well noted by John Strong.1 But if Death ofSãkyamuni adheres to its textual and iconographical ancestry in this regard, it is equally a product of fourteenth- century Japan. Here the carnivalesque takes on another meaning with a more localized resonance. Medieval Japanese popular cul- ture has been much studied for its lively street life and raucous temple festivals, where entertainment - from virtuoso oratory to farce - was the lubricant that more likely than not made possible the aims of Buddhist instruction. That Death ofSãkyamuni has the flavor of a Kyoto street fair speaks to what David Summers would call the real conditions of its production.17 It beckons us into the social and cultural space of a four- teenth-century audience in Japan, where we share with that audience the painter's incisive gaze into human behavior- at once comical and profound - read against the grain of Buddhist piety. The figure of Ksitigarbha in his green surplice at the far end of the couch similarly points to a local declension in the narrative process of the painting (fig. 4). Only occa- sionally given so prominent a spot, the figure of Ksitigarbha here seems off-message. His head is raised and he appears to be detached from the convulsive grief around him; per- haps he has just arrived from some other realm of suffering far worse than anything he 58</page><page sequence="16">sees here. It is Ksitigarbha's lot to ply the six realms of rebirth - hell, hungry ghosts, ani- mals, Asuras, humans, gods - in a search- and-rescue mission to save those who lan- guish there by force of karma. Armed with a wish-granting jewel and a priest's staff with six rings, the gentle Ksitigarbha lingers among the lowly and the lost. He is a bod- hisattva, but does not abide by the hierarchy of grief around the Buddha's couch, nor does he wear the royal costume to which he is entitled. This itinerant do-gooder enjoyed a popu- lar following in medieval Japan, where he was known as Jizõ and typically envisioned as a pleasant-looking androgynous figure in the guise of a monk. His innate mildness of character and charm is well demonstrated by the sixteenth-century painting of Ksitigarbha in the Yale University Art Gallery (fig. 12). For the most part, the medieval cult of Ksitigarbha was informed by devotional practices focused on the Lotus Sutra and the Pure Land teachings, with particular atten- tion to salvation from the six realms. Myõe had attempted to temper these practices by emphasizing the life and teachings of Säkya- muni in the reform movement that had prompted development of the Type II con- vention. Thus the figure of Ksitigarbha, who does not appear in the Nirvana Sutra, intro- duces an element of contingency. It is not simply that Ksitigarbha has been inserted into the crowd of mourners; by the eleventh century, he already had a prominent spot at the head of the couch. Nor is it that his pres- ence necessarily marks a counterpoint to doctrinal focus on áãkyamuni, although the subversive potential of a populist bodhisattva is certainly there. Rather, it is where Ksitigarbha is placed in the picture - near the aristocratic women Fig. 12. Ksitigarbha, Muromachi-Momoyama periods (1392- 161 5), 16th century.

Ksitigarbha is known to have been central to women's religious practices in Japan, as Hank Glassman has shown.1 Thus his placement in Death ofSãkyamuni hints at the identity of the patron for whom it was painted. It is noteworthy that Myõson executed at least two paintings of the scene for nuns at Hokkeji. Although neither of the works contains a figure of Ksitigarbha, the role of a female patron in their production is significant. Taking into consideration the close associa- tion of Ksitigarbha with women in the fourteenth century, and noting that Myõson worked on commission for nuns, we can cer- tainly imagine a similar provenance for the Yale painting. The large number of women gathered at the foot of the couch likewise hints at a female patron (fig. i). The child- like figure behind Aniruddha (fig. 3), seen only infrequently in other versions of the Death ofSãkyamuni, may offer yet another glimpse into the private world of a woman who once contemplated the scene before us.19 The quiet presence of Ksitigarbha intro- duces yet another dimension of local mean- ing with important implications for analysis of the painting. The bodhisattva is situated in such a way that it seems implicit that the figures crowding around the Buddha repre- sent the six realms of rebirth - something that the Nirvana Sütra does not mention in so many words. The sutra does indeed speak of the six realms: when the Buddha begins to die, he emits a multicolored light from his mouth that eliminates the sins of those in the six realms.20 But the Nirvana Sütra does not dally on so fine a point. Its greater goal is to explain the Buddha nature and the con- ditions of enlightenment, as taught by the Buddha in the moment of his passing. To link the two by implication - salvation from the six realms and the unfolding of the Buddha nature - appears to be a particularly Japanese intervention, as seen initially in Genshin's liturgical manual.21 And it offers insight into one of the most striking features of parinirvãna iconography as it developed in medieval Japan: the attention given to animals as mourners at the Buddha's death. The large number of animals in Japanese paintings of the death of the Buddha has been well noted, especially for the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. As Nakano has shown, there are very few extant Chinese or Central Asian works of any period with so many animals among the mourners; nor do the earliest Japanese works - such as the clay tableau at Hõryuji or the Kongõbuji Death ofSãkyamuni- depict more than one or two animals.22 It is only with the development of the two conventions favored in Japan for representations of the death of the Buddha, in the eleventh and thirteenth centuries, respectively, that animals begin to figure prominently in the paintings, becoming especially numerous in Type II works, of which the Yale Death ofSãkyamuni is an important example (fig. 6). There is certainly a scriptural basis for the presence of the animals. The opening chapter of the Nirvana Sütra describes the many animal kings who have come to pay homage to the Buddha on his deathbed: lions, elephants, birds, buffalo, cattle, sheep, and honeybees.23 But it is not until the thir- teenth and fourteenth centuries, and mostly in Japan, that the animals of the sutra are first pictured systematically as mourners in paintings of the Buddha's death. They are joined there by other animals not mentioned at all in the sutra, such as tigers, leopards, boars, deer, monkeys, dogs, horses, hawks, falcons, cranes, domestic geese, turtles, and frogs. This development parallels what Myõe does in the preface to his liturgical manual for the Nirvana Service. Myõe adheres closely to the Nirvana Sütra in describing the death of the Buddha and even includes a detailed list of the animals present- but he adds some new animals to the list, among them dogs, boars, deer, monkeys, and tigers.24 This is also true for the Yale Death ofSãkya- 60</page><page sequence="18">muni: of the thirty genera represented, only some are mentioned specifically in the sutra. It is as if the animals of medieval Japan, the denizens of its fields and streams, have come to take their place, prominently, at the death of the Buddha. Ultimately this makes sense. As the first chapter of the Nirvana Sütra states, beings from all worlds and all times, of all ranks and all genera, are condensed into one tiny space and one infinite moment to mourn the Buddha's passing. Why animals came to be given so much prominence in Japanese depictions of the death of the Buddha- indeed, they alone populate the immediate foreground of the paintings - is not entirely clear. It is possible that they are intended to remind us that we, too, may one day find ourselves among them. Animals were once humans, and are destined to be humans at some later point in the deep karmic grammar of the universe. It is perfectly reasonable that our approach to the dying Buddha is through the animals; there could be no more eloquent a statement of the antiquity of the human-animal bond than this. The animals seem to mirror the scene that unfolds at the center of the paint- ing: the elephant lies prone just like the Buddha, predator and prey grieve together like Indra and Vemacitra. For once animals are neither demographic rivals nor food. Instead they partake of a critical impulse linking them to humans and gods: they also seek the Buddha. The doctrinal rationale for the presence of the animals may relate tangentially to mention of the six realms in the Nirvana Sütra and in Genshins popular manual for the Nirvana Service. And this may well reveal a local intervention keyed to the presence of Ksitigarbha. But a more direct source lies in the basic message delivered by the Buddha, responding to questions from the bodhisattva Kasyapa and others, on his deathbed, as recorded in the Nirvana Sütra. The message is twofold: the Buddha is eternal and unchanging; and all sentient beings, even the most incorrigibly evil, possess Buddha essence. By virtue of this essence - their Buddha nature - all sentient beings are des- tined to attain enlightenment. Thus a paint- ing like Yale's Death ofSãkyamuni, with its colorful crowd of every sort of sentient being imaginable (including a Buddha), is as much a meditation on the universality of Buddha nature as it is a depiction of the death of the Buddha at the moment that the great teach- ing has been realized. This primordial scene unfolds against a backdrop of insentience - earth, sky, water, earth - that nonetheless responds dramati- cally to the Buddha's death: the great earth shakes, the trees flower out of season. And yet to these things the Nirvana Sütra would deny Buddha nature.25 Paintings such as Yale's Death ofSãkyamuni, however, appear to claim otherwise. The lush green earth and the many-leaved deciduous trees, along with the animals of field and stream, point to the ecosystem of the Japanese archipelago even as they provide the ground on which the vir- tual realm of the Buddha on his deathbed at Kusinagara in distant India is pictured. This means that the landscape in the painting is alive and sentient, for the Japanese earth and its flora and fauna have always been home to the native gods known as kami. The numi- nous presence of the kami breathes life into all places and things - like the jinn of Arabic mythology, or the Roman numena-ζηά in medieval Japan, these gods were frequently envisioned in the form of a landscape. To this degree the green earth in Death ofSãkya- muni belies the insentience assigned it by the Nirvana Sütra. Indeed, it captures some- thing of the nature (literally) of the Buddha essence or principle - the ground on which everything else, including the message of deliverance, is inscribed and given form. The idea of figure to ground raises a seemingly absurd but inevitable question that underlies Buddhist imagery in general, and the Yale Death ofSãkyamuni in particu- lar: Can a painting have the Buddha nature? That Death ofSãkyamuni pictures the Buddha becoming an icon - an image literally "after" 61</page><page sequence="19">the Buddha - is communicated in several ways. The Nirvana Sütra describes how the dying Buddha comforts his distraught fol- lowers by displaying his body in the form that will live on in his wake as an object of remembrance.26 That body- golden, with thirty-two major bodily signs, such as the cranial protuberance and elongated ear- lobes - is the one on the couch. The Buddha shows the same body to Queen Maya when she arrives too late to witness his death and begins to wail in front of his coffin until he appears before her.27 We see her hurrying down from the heavens as the process of iconic realization unfolds on the couch below. Mahãkãsyapa is not in the picture at all, even though he is the Buddha's foremost disciple and has been entrusted with the dharma. He will arrive only after the crema- tion ground has claimed the physical body of the Buddha, and the Buddha image is all that is left. In picturing the moment at which the Buddha image comes to stand in for the Buddha, Death ofSãkyamuni itself takes on something of the nature of that placeholder. As such, it becomes the iconic focus of the Nirvana Service and effectively takes the place of the Buddha who is absent. This could not happen but for the aggregate of physical substances - pigments made of powdered minerals and glue, silk threads woven into a planar surface - that, in the moment of facture, find themselves trans- formed into the imaginative space of the parinirvãna. They are its ground, just as, in the painting that exists because of them, the insentient green earth under the gathering sky marks the physical purchase of the Buddha nature given human form on a couch beneath the trees. Does this mean, then, that the painting contains the Buddha nature ? An elderly abbot certainly once thought so, on dedicating a painting of the death of the Buddha in 1563. "The Void ground the ink," he wrote. Gandharva refined the glue. Blue clouds, yellow clouds, red clouds; gold paint, silver paint, purple paint: in the morning they combine within the blossom of Buddhas true law, in the evening they turn over the leaves of the wondrous mind of Nirvana.28 In Death ofSãkyamuni, with its fleeting configuration of the Buddha nature, all the parts of the puzzle find their way into one realization. It is just as the Nirvana Sütra says: All things are like phantoms, and the Buddha lives in between.29 For Dick, Leighton, and Koichi 1.
