University of Utah Press, Salt Lake City, 2003, 350 pp., $50.00, cloth. Reviewed by Philip J. Wilke, Lithic Technology Laboratory, University of California, Riverside. Mesoamerican Lithic Technology grew out of a major research program in lithic studies, emphasizing obsidian pressure-blade technology, headed by Kenneth Hirth of Pennsylvania State University. A significant event in that program was the Penn State Conference on Ancient Mesoamerican Obsidian Blade Production held in May, 2000. A small group of scholars involved in research on pressure-blade technology was invited to attend the gathering and they authored the various chapters. Participants included nine from the United States (Jeffrey Flenniken, Kenneth Hirth, Bradford Andrews, Payson Sheets, John Clark, James Woods, Gene Titmus, Dan Healan, Rissa Trachman), two from France (Jacques Tixier, Jacques Pelegrin), and one each from Mexico (Alejandro Pastrana) and Switzerland (Peter Kelterborn). Hirth is to be thanked for making the results of the Penn State conference available in a timely manner. The information developed and reported is handsomely presented in a large- format, two-column, well-bound and durable volume that is reasonably priced. On the down side, the type is a bit small for aging eyes, and some of the photographs are too dark to convey necessaiy detail. Appropriately, the volume is dedicated to Don Crabtree, who initiated much of the replicative work reported here. The work stands as a milestone, not only in the study of pressure-blade technology, but in several other areas of the lithic technology and industries of ancient Mesoamerica. It will have considerable importance for replicative experimenters and analysts elsewhere in the world. In the following pages I review and discuss the volume by chapter. At the end of the review I discuss the book as a whole and some of the issues it raises, and offer suggestions for future research directions. In preparing this review I had to take a decision either to treat the work in a cursory overview (which Hirth essentially does in the introductory chapter), or, for those who have not read it, to dig into it and try to present my assessment of its content, strengths, and weaknesses, as well as its likely impact for future studies. I had to choose the latter course; hence the length of this review. Hirth's introduction (chapter 1) provides a brief overview of the current state of research in Mesoamerican pressure-blade technology and industries. He reviews basic concepts and sets out the goals of the volume: to summarize the current state of knowledge of how pressure blades were produced; to demonstrate the utility of experimental flintworking for solving problems relating to blade production; and to demonstrate how experimental research designs can be incorporated into analysis and interpretation of archaeological blade assemblages. He then highlights briefly the main points of the chapters that follow. Chapter 2, by Sheets, is a brief but timely review of changing research paradigms in Maya lithic studies. He discusses the unquestioned subscription to these paradigms and the allowing of them to become orthodoxies. The first of these grew out of Kidder's pioneering analysis of the lithic artifacts from Uaxactun, Guatemala, where the chipped stone assemblage was divided initially into utilitarian and ceremonial realms, and then into progressively finer divisions along the way to description and interpretation. The initial split was not the best way to begin, but the presentation was multifaceted, creative, and comprehensive, and it set a standard that was emulated for more than two decades. Following Crabtree's initial experiments in blade making, Sheets, his student, forged largely on his own what became the behavioral/ technological paradigm of prismatic blade production. The modeling emphasized under-</page><page sequence="2">220 Uthic Technology, voi.32-2 standing the interplay of decisions within the bounds of technological processes, as revealed by an analytically derived and experimentally verifiable sequence of actions, products, and by- products. The paradigm, somewhat reformulated by more recent work, rightly guides Mesoamerican pressure-blade studies today, even as variability across space and time becomes ever more apparent. Sheets's concern is that overenthusiastic and uncritical acceptance of his approach may already have allowed it to become a second orthodoxy, allowing unanticipated research findings to slip into expected patterns and categories, thus preventing the discovery and appreciation of new forms of variation. The basic technology of blade making probably is fairly similar throughout Mesoamerica, but the reasons for significant variability in local industries across space and time is what is important, meaningful, and demanding of serious attention, not to mention exciting. Sheets's cautionary appeal is appropriate and timely, and it carries through in several of the succeeding chapters in the volume. Clark's opus, "A Review of Twentieth-Century Mesoamerican Obsidian Studies," appears as Chapter 3. With five accompanying bibliographic appendices, the contribution requires 62 pages of small type. Appendices are: "Bibliography of Quarry Studies," "Publication History of Major Journals," Bibliography of Dissertations and Theses," "Combined Bibliography of Journal Samples, Dissertations, and Theses," and "Bibliography of Replication and Ethnographic Studies." The master bibliography of the volume, which includes both Clark's personal literature compilation and works cited in the various chapters, doubles the page count. The historical critique and literary compilation represents an awesome effort. Almost everything ever published on Mesoamerican obsidian or that draws on that material for inference is referenced here, so this is the place to find the literature. On first glance, those seeking obsidian studies might wonder at references to subjects such as handaxe manufacture (picked up in a survey of articles on lithic technology in a selection of 10 refereed journals). References to any effort involving obsidian are set off by italics. Thus the presentation allows one to better sort the literature and to see trends in publication of obsidian studies within the larger realm of lithic research in general. Of course, how and where the net is cast largely determines what fish will be caught, so a few relevant works on experiments and replicative assemblage analysis do not appear here. Given that, in some Mesoamerican industries, pressure-blade cores were worked down to very small size; some of the bullet-core or microblade industries of the Old World are relevant for comparison. But Clark's effort in compiling the literature was enormous and justifiable, and one does have to draw the line somewhere. The value of the effort for scholars is phenomenal. Clark's narrative explores a century of obsidian studies beginning with William Holmes's (1900) description of the Pachuca mines in Hidalgo, Mexico, and ending with Kazuo Aoyama's (2001) use of obsidian data to infer the Classic Maya state, urbanism, and exchange in and around Copán, Honduras. The review addresses a number of topical areas: quarry studies; obsidian studies at consumer sites; articles in refereed journals; debates and issues in lithic studies; influential books and citation patterns; overviews of progress in Mesoamerican lithic studies; and obsidian in the pursuit of power. Clark does the standard analyses of the history of citations and their trends in journals, themes in dissertations and theses, the succession of major issues that have dominated research involving obsidian data as Mesoamerican archaeology has grown in sophistication and popularity, and the like. Noteworthy is the slowed pace of replicative experiments since the initial rush of the 1970s and early 1980s. The present volume marks a significant revival of interest in this area, and it is hoped that this trend will continue. The discussion of the history of practical and theoretical research is extremely detailed and well balanced, with credit where credit is due. The benchmark contributions of Payson Sheets are appropriately recognized and their lasting value acknowledged. But Clark really comes down on the consumers of obsidian research data who, by leaps of inference, have wrongly used meager research findings to arrive at grand interpretations of political economy and related complex entities. (Of course they would do that: such writing receives our discipline's highest accolades.) Clark's focus on studies with procedural and inferential flaws is intentional for highlighting areas where improvement can be hoped for in the future. This chapter is essential reading for students in any area</page><page sequence="3">Book Review - Hirth - Mesoamerican Lithic Technology: ... 221 of Mesoamerican archaeology, an overcrowded arena in which Darwinian principles are certain to prevail. Much experimental work on blade making by direct percussion, indirect percussion, direct pressure, and lever-assisted pressure has been carried out in Europe at a high level of skill for several decades. Most of this work has been in flint, but some of it has been in obsidian. Relating the findings to analysis of archaeological assemblages has greatly helped to elucidate the production side of blade industries in Europe, the circum- Mediterranean, the Near East, and South Asia. In chapter 4 Pelegrin provides an informative discussion of the experimental work, most of which he carried out or was directly involved in. His discussion focuses on the potential of those experiments and approaches for elucidating certain aspects of Mesoamerican obsidian blade production. He identifies four areas of potential research in which the European experiments might contribute: shaping and regularizing large blade cores prior to debitage by pressure; detaching pressure blades from slender and nearly exhausted cores; detaching pressure blades from very small ("microblade") cores; and use of indirect percussion. The chapter discusses various core- immobilization devices and the strategies for their use; body position and orientation with respect to the core being reduced; rigid vs. flexible pressure tools, or crutches; and materials used for pressure bits and punches. There is much informative discussion in each of these areas. The last half of the paper discusses application of experiments in flint blade production to Mesoamerican obsidian pressure-blade industries. The jury is still out on the possible use of indirect percussion or lever-assisted pressure to detach veiy broad and long blades from robust cores such as those at Kaminaljuyu, but levers seem to be implicated. From the discussion provided on the varied approaches to blade making by European experimenters, there is a wealth of information to guide future replicative analyses in several areas of Mesoamerican blade technology. Almost 500 years have passed since a Spanish chronicler of uncertain identity gazed in awe as indigenous blade makers of highland Mexico practiced their craft. Sadly, it was to be the only place on earth where indigenous pressure-blade production was ever seen and described in writing. The written account (or accounts-there may have been two chroniclers) of those first observations is lost to history. To understand the workings of that specific blade-making process today we have to rely on critical analysis of redactions or copyings of the original description(s) and a limited number of drawings of obsidian blade cores, blades, blade makers, and blade making tools that appear in the codices. Chapter 5, "Mexico Blade Making with Wooden Tools . . .", by Titmus and Clark, is a progress report on a combined 60 years of ethnohistory and experimentation by these two researchers. To date, it is the most thorough and critical ethnohistorical analysis of all the available ancient documents and their more recent interpretation, together with observations on blade production in the codices. It sorts out who apparently saw what when, and who apparently recast what from whom. It is a minutely detailed analysis and reconstruction of the itzcolotli, the hooked staff now believed to have been used to detach pressure blades from obsidian cores in the sixteenth century. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, it is a detailed summation of a decade of replicative experiments by Titmus detaching pressure blades in a seated position with itzcolotli reconstructed entirely of hardwood, the bit being of granadillo (species?) , while stabilizing the cores between his feet, as described in the historical records. The results are impressive and convincing. Titmus was able to detach blades up to 23 centimeters long from a sawn core of Pachuca obsidian at the Penn State conference. Producing large and well-proportioned cores is , without doubt, the most challenging part of the blade making process. This difficulty has, until now, limited production of longer blades. All aspects of the experimental work are described: layout, characteristics, and dimensions of the work station; measurements and construction of the itzcolotli; core and blade attributes; bodily movements involved in core immobilization and blade detachment; and much more. This chapter provides all of the information needed for any skilled blade maker to replicate the experiments and perhaps take them a step further.</page><page sequence="4">222 Lithic Technology, vol.32-2 Noteworthy in the research is comparison of the hardwood pressure bit of the itzcolotli with others of copper and antler, as seen in the different bulb attributes they produce on the detached blades. Comparison of these attributes with those in archaeological assemblages will help to clarify how closely the research replicates pressure-blade production in the indigenous industries. Concerning their results thus far, the authors are cautious, leaving room for alternate interpretations that might come from future replicative research, which they encourage, and which is the ultimate purpose of their contribution. Chapter 6, by Flenniken and Hirth, reports experiments to identify the technique apparently used at Xochicalco, Morelos, during the Epiclassic period to detach pressure blades from cores that were too small to be worked effectively by techniques that involved core immobilization between the feet. The exhausted, small-diameter cores at Xochicalco have pecked-and-ground platforms and are largely of obsidian from the Ucareo source in Michoacán. They were recycled from yet-unidentified workshops at which they initially were considered exhausted. Upon arrival at Xochicalco they were broken into shorter segments for further reduction. The authors argue for simple core immobilization in the hand and report detachment of blades up to about 7 cm long using hand-held pressure tools. They also report experiments aimed at replicating pecked-and-ground platforms on such small cores. They conclude that this platform treatment enables detachment of blades with less force and therefore better control. An argument is made that production of larger blades from foot- held cores and smaller ones from hand-held cores, perhaps in entirely separate regions, are com- plementary in an overall regional lithic economy. An efficient strategy for reduction of small- diameter cores would have enabled the ultimate exploitation of raw material across a landscape on which obsidian sources were unevenly distributed, often at very remote locations. But holding the cores in the hand with no distal support, as advocated here, becomes more difficult as core diameter diminishes. Moreover, experience indicates the technique cannot encourage the consistent production of straight blades. I believe straightness was a desired attribute of pressure blades of whatever size in Mesoamerica, and wherever they were made. To my mind, distal core support is essential for detaching straight blades, which in turn maintain the straightness, and the length, of the core face. Distal support causes the detaching force to compress the part of the core where the blade is to be detached, thus directing the fracture to the point of support. Short, straight blades can be produced more consistently using simple but effective hand-held appliances of wood or bone that provide necessary lateral and distal core support, as well as complete core immobilization (e.g., Pelegrin 1988, this volume; Wilke 1996). Chapter 7, by Trachman and Titmus, addresses the sectioning of both percussion- and pressure-blade cores by fractures emanating from initiation lines that were either pecked or scored around all or part of the core peripheries. The method is reminiscent of the controlled breakage of glass rods by bending them after initiating lines are scratched or ground around them at the place where a break is desired. The cores in question come from a sample of the Early Classic assemblage from Dos Hombres, Belize, and related sites in Belize and Guatemala, suggesting a regional pattern of core management. The nearest sources of obsidian to these sites are hundreds of kilometers away. The chapter is essentially an enlarged version of an earlier report by Trachman (1999), with the addition of data sets and preliminary results of experimental core sectioning by Titmus. The sectioning fracture was duplicated by laying the pecked or scored core down on a slightly concave surface, such as that of a shallow-basin metate, so that the part of the core with the pecked or scratched line was not supported. A percussion blow applied to the upper surface of the core induced a bending break, sectioning the core. The fracture duplicated that in the archaeological material. Illustrated cores from Dos Hombres show pressure-blade production after sectioning, with blades detached from the platform created by the induced fracture, and removed from only part of the core periphery. Other cores similarly sectioned apparently show only percussion scars and no subsequent pressure-blade detachment. An argument is made that the cores were so sectioned to rejuvenate their platforms. Perhaps</page><page sequence="5">Book Review - Hirth - Mesoamerican Lithic Technology: ... 223 so, and several rather thick platform tablets are in the collection. But most of the illustrated specimens, especially those from nearby Lamanai, Belize, look like the pointed distal ends of cores that were detached and discarded with little or no further reduction. Based on the figures, it appears that their conical configurations would have made them difficult to immobilize, and they would have yielded mostly very short, curved blades. No information is provided on the size and configuration of fully reduced pressure-blade cores at these sites, nor on possible remnant pecking on unreduced faces of such cores. Nor is there information on the possible presence of peck marks at the distal ends of some of the pressure blades in the assemblages, which would be helpful. The illustrated specimens cannot be related to entries in the tables that summarize descriptive attributes, and the photographs lack detail. It is therefore difficult to conclude from the presentation exactly what is indicated by these very small cores with pecked or scored fracture-initiation lines at their proximal ends. Some of the examples shown seem, without question, to have been the distal ends of once-longer cores. The situation recalls that at a small Middle Preclassic-to-Terminal Classic site on the Belize River near El Pilar (Hintzman 2000). It is thought that obsidian was imported there as exhausted blade cores gleaned from the debris of workshops nearer the El Chayal source. The pointed, distal ends of these cores were detached on site. The resulting cores, then more parallel-side and with squared-off distal ends, were again reduced to exhaustion, yielding small but acceptable pressure blades that were straighter and more parallel-sided. So in this case, core rejuvenation was not limited to reworking the platforms. Instead, it also emphasized detaching the pointed distal end of the core to permit distal core support while at the same time allowing space for blades to detach freely. Some of the detached distal ends of the imported cores were themselves further reduced for what can be termed microblades. The fracture that sectioned the core was always propagated from a notch pecked into the narrowest part of the face of the core, where crack initiation would be easier. Experiments showed that similar fractures could be initiated in such a pecked notch by indirect percussion using a strongly angled chert flake as a chisel. Chert was a commonly used raw material at the site. A comparative study of these several site assemblages, all in a relatively small area, would be useful. Chapter 8, by Kelterborn, is a contribution from the mind and workshop of a structural engineer. Titled "Measurable Flintknapping," it focuses on experimental stoneworking using mechanical lever devices to apply force to workpieces firmly held in pinch vices. These appliances control all aspects of the immobilization of the workpiece and the angles and degrees of force instilled into it to detach flakes, blades, or spalls. The forms of these detachments are highly predictable, repeatable, and measurable. Readers may find the chapter fitting least comfortably in the volume. Some might be put off simply by the use of mechanical apparatus, but Kelterborn makes a strong case for the engineering approach. He rightly points out that the purpose is not merely to detach a flake of a given dimension and configuration, but to use the approach to solve archaeological problems, and the problems to be solved have to be recognized and brought forth by lithic analysts. There are important problems to consider: identifying whether pressure or indirect percussion was used to make blades in a given assemblage; identifying the material used in the tips of the pressure tools of antiquity; comparing the force needed to detach blades from cores with flake-scar platforms vs. those with pecked-and- ground platforms, to list but three. Examples of work discussed and illustrated in the chapter make it clear that Kelterborn's mechanical devices not only duplicate what can be done by hand, but actually do it better and more consistently. His approach allows attention to focus on a single variable while all others are held constant. Clear relationships are presented between vectors of force and the size of the flakes generated. A brief study is reported on measuring the improvement in flakeability of certain flints following heat treatment when the detaching force and angle are held constant. The measure of improvement is reported to have been 24 96. But because most materials susceptible to heat treatment are not homogeneous, and it is my belief that the process occurs progressively through a range of temperatures, I foresee this figure of 24 % being misused in discussions of heat treatment for</page><page sequence="6">224 Lithic Technology, vol. ^2-2 the next 40 years. Be that as it may, only such a problem-driven approach as advocated in this chapter can clarify many mechanical issues and make conclusions convincing through quantitative results. When used in such a manner, the potential of measurable flintknapping is obvious and compelling. Until now the major emphasis in understanding the methods of lithic reduction employed in ancient Mesoamerica has been on the use of pressure to detach obsidian blades. The range of flaking methods is further broadened in chapter 9 by a couple of eccentric flintknappers in Idaho. Through collections analysis and initial experimental work, Titmus and Woods argue for the use of indirect percussion in the production of Late Classic Maya eccentrics. The largest and most elaborate of these artifacts are the complex anthropomorphic figures found with burials and in dedicatory contexts. The symbolic messages they convey are portrayed entirely in silhouette in coarse and fine detail at their margins. It is a wonder that these figures were brought into the world without breaking them in the process. The researchers show that production of at least the larger eccentrics involved rigid adherence to a staged reduction sequence. That sequence involved, first, the production of a thin, biconvex, percussion-flaked bifacial blank. The blank was then deeply notched by indirect percussion to isolate the main design elements of the intended eccentric. Notching and finishing to create the detail of the final eccentric was accomplished by conventional pressure flaking. Indirect percussion is necessary for working in confined spaces where use of a hand-held percussor is not possible and where sufficient mass cannot be removed in the proper manner by hand-held pressure tools. Perhaps the most critical part of the entire production is mapping out the sequence of tasks to be accomplished by indirect-percussion notching, in order to preserve mass where needed to prevent breakage of the workpiece during successive operations. While most of the larger Maya anthropomorphic eccentrics were executed in chert, the experiments mainly involved far-less- forgiving obsidian. Importantly, the sequence of requisite flaking methods employed in production of anthropomorphic eccentrics is revealed in flake- scar patterns on archaeological specimens. These patterns guided the replicative research. In order to help identify the archaeological debris that would document production of eccentrics, the authors provide clear descriptions and pictures of the very diagnostic indirect-percussion notching flakes. While they used copper rods for punches and pressure flakers, the materials used by the ancient Maya, who assuredly lacked that metal, remain to be identified. Some of the possibilities are discussed. A characteristic feature of small Classic and Epiclassic Central Mexican bifaces finished by transverse (oblique) parallel pressure flaking is the slant of the flake scars across the face of the workpiece from the lower left to the upper right. This scar slant parallels that common in some parts of the Old World (as in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic of the Near East). As a cultural marker, it is rare in North America, where the so-called Ishi flaking technique resulted in scar patterns with the opposite slant. It seems likely that, worldwide, most aboriginal flintknappers were right-handed. So it follows that broad patterns of difference in the slant of flake scars should not have been caused by to handedness, but rather by the culturally dictated manner in which the workpiece was held and the flakes were detached. In chapter 10, Hirth, Titmus, Flenniken, and Tixier describe two techniques of pressure flaking by right-handed persons that might account for the characteristic slant of the flake scars on finished Mesoamerican bifaces. Nothing is more difficult to describe in print than the minute but critical details of the techniques of pressure-flaking. Parts of this description will challenge many readers. The authors favor a technique perfected independently decades ago by Titmus, working alone with no one to teach him otherwise. Maybe there is a lesson here for all of us: teaching, as we know it, efficiently clones existing ideas, but it is a poor way to generate new ones. In the hands of a skilled artisan, the scar pattern described here documents a flaking technique that is, at once, technologically superior and aesthetically of a high order. It would be interesting to see a thorough study across space and time of the kinds of bifaces usually finished by the flaking pattern described here, correlated with their behavioral contexts and inferred or determined functions.</page><page sequence="7">Book Review - Hirth - Mesoamerican Lithic Technology: ... 225 In Chapter 11 Healan summarizes two decades of careful and well-reasoned research at the blade workshops at Tula, Hidalgo, and at the Ucareo source and environs. Ucareo obsidian dominated the Tula industry from the Epiclassic into the early Postclassic, when Pachuca, a much closer source, largely replaced it. The excavated workshop debris (less microdebitage) at Tula included an analyzed 435,000 artifacts. Blade cores arrived at Tula with multi-faceted platforms which were regularized, pecked and ground, usually fully reduced in the round, and then, for unknown reasons, most often smashed. A third of the cores arrived in cylindrical form with evidence of bidirectional preparation. The details of the pressure-blade production industry are clearly reported. Healan is to be commended for his complete analysis of such an enormous assemblage. Described in equal clarity is research at the Ucareo quarries and their associated core- production workshops. Work at this end of the production continuum revealed the strategies used to prepare the percussion-blade cores exported to Tula and elsewhere for reduction by pressure. Ironically, the local lithic industry at small habitation sites around the quarries relied primarily not on blades but on flakes, and the core producers exercised a wide range of choices in configuring pressure-blade cores for their own use. Other substantial sites in the Ucareo region excelled in pressure-blade technology using cores with single-facet platforms, some of which apparently found their way to Xochicalco (Chapter 13, below). This excellent chapter reveals the entire range of actions and strategies involved in handling obsidian (except transport) from its geological source at Ucareo, through production of embryonic cores at the quarry workshops, to pressure-blade production at Tula, and ultimately to discard of the debris at the Tula workshops. Kaminaljuyu in southern Guatemala is the largest and most impressive obsidian blade- production site yet identified in the Maya region. Workshop debris occurs densely there over an area of up to five hectares and documents the structure and importance of the local industry in the Late Formative and Early Classic periods. In chapter 12 Hirth provides a preliminary analysis of the pressure-blade industry. A notable feature of it is the very large size of many of the blades produced there. Almost all of the obsidian originated at the nearby El Chayal source. Much blocky and thick, tabular material was partially worked at the quarries and finished into pressure-blade cores at the Kaminaljuyu workshops. It is argued that core production often followed a somewhat different trajectory from that usually postulated for much of Mesoamerica (Sheets 1975; Clark 1985, 1997; Clark and Bryant 1997). Apparently, the configuration of the raw material and its thin cortex encouraged an embedded strategy of late-stage core preparation that emphasized the detachment of large, partially cortical, percussion blades and a subsequent round of "robust prismatic blades" prior to production of conventional, but very large, pressure blades. The final blades detached to regularize the cores were suited for various tasks and were distributed from the blade workshops to the places they were needed. Two dilemmas emerged from this research, and they are discussed at length. The method of detachment of the "robust prismatic blades" remains unclear. Bulbar attributes suggest indirect percussion, but experiments at the conference failed to duplicate them. Moreover, the pressure blades produced at Kaminaljuyu remain some of the largest in any industry yet found in Mesoamerica. Judging from the cores and blade fragments recovered, they typically were between 15 and 22 cm long and 2 cm or more wide. Proximal fragments show thicknesses averaging more than 4 mm. Blades of this size could not be duplicated at the Penn State conference with the Mexica technique. It seems likely that lever-assisted pressure is indicated. Some novel techniques might be worth trying in replicative research and may provide the answer (Pelegrin, this volume; Volkov and Guiria 1991). The production sequence employed in the pressure-blade industry at Epiclassic Xochicalco, Morelos, is described in Chapter 13 by Hirth, Andrews, and Flenniken. Particulars of the site location and assemblage were noted above (Chapter 6). Obsidian arrived at Xochicalco in the form of fairly long (perhaps 15-20 cm), but substantially reduced, pressure-blade cores, probably resembling the large but exhausted pressure-blade cores illustrated by Hester (1978) from Villa Morelos, Michoacán. These cores apparently were recycled from workshops where</page><page sequence="8">226 Ltthic Technology, vnl.^2-2 long and wide pressure-blades were made nearer the obsidian sources, and where the cores initially were declared exhausted. Two-thirds of the assemblage is from the Ucareo source in Michoacán (200 km away), with the bulk of the remainder from Zacualtipan (210 km) and Pachuca (155 km) in Hidalgo. Because of the catastrophic destruction and burning of Xochicalco by conquest and its generally continued abandonment afterwards, the depositional context of the excavated workshops is excellent. The analyzed assemblage numbers over 350,000 pieces. The Xochicalco blade industry documents the transition in core design from single-facet platforms to pecked-and-ground platforms. By great fortune for analysts, the cores made of the grey Ucareo obsidian arrived at Xochicalco with single-facet platforms. These cores, like those from other sources, were first broken into two or more segments by bipolar percussion. The shorter core segments were then given pecked-and-ground platforms prior to farther reduction. As expected in this reduction sequence, all blade products are late-stage, short, and progressively narrower as reduction continues. There are only 17 early-stage pressure blades (first- and second-series), compared to about 160,000 late-stage blades and fragments (third-series) in the analyzed assemblage. The authors think the Mexico technique of reducing foot-held cores (Chapter 5) was already in use in central highland Mexico, and that the cores imported to Xochicalco had been reduced originally by this technique. But they think that, on arrival at the site, the cores were too small in diameter for further reduction in the same manner. They favor reduction of the shorter core segments in the hand, using the technique described in Chapter 6. Core sectioning and rejuvenation came with a price, and apparently it resulted in the loss of several centimeters of length from each incoming core. In the end, it is argued that the cores were sectioned to permit hand-held reduction. Perhaps so, but it seems an unexpected and impractical strategy. Core sectioning, platform rejuvenation, and pecking and grinding all expend available core length for blade production, which must have been especially important at a location so far from stone sources. Perhaps what drove the production of short blades was the size of the usable blade segments that were desired products, but they could have been produced more efficiently from longer blades. This situation leaves room for further deliberation. In Chapter 14 Pastrana and Hirth address the specialized production of fairly small utilitarian bifaces in the context of craft specialization. The preforms of these bifaces (I would call them blanks) were turned out in astounding numbers in the final centuries before the Conquest at workshops at the obsidian mines of Sierra de las Navajas (Pachuca). Tools pressure-flaked to final form from these bifaces served a variety of functions, but probably the main one was as weapon points for the armies of the Triple Alliance. The bifacial preforms, most of the illustrated ones of sizes suitable for making typical atlatl dart points, were prepared by direct percussion following two strategies. One used flake blanks that often appear to have been detached from bidirectional cores. The other used thin, tabular pieces of obsidian that also occur at the source. The reduction sequences employed in preform production are described based on large numbers of these artifacts found at excavated workers' camps. Transforming the preforms into finished tools would have occurred in specialized workshops nearer consumer areas. An argument is made that specialization was driven by the need for mass production and standardization of the finished products. Measuring the skill levels of prehistoric craftspersons in the context of pressure-blade production is Andrews's task in Chapter 15. The essay reaches no profound conclusions. A distinction is made between artisanal skill and efficiency skill. The output of the former is fancy, special-order things (e.g., anthropomorphic eccentrics); that for the latter is mass-produced commodities (here, pressure blades). Output of commodities and errors in their production have dominated the literature on craftsmanship for more than a decade. This essay focuses on efficiency, and tries to assess skill as measured by errors on either blades or cores. The author tries to develop a proportion of errors-to-successful-efforts as a measure of craftsperson skill. This is a difficult task that</page><page sequence="9">Book Review - Hirth - Mesoamerican Lithic Technology: ... 227 requires a lot of assumptions. Estimates can be made of what and how many products left the workshop based on the sampling of the debris left behind. But what errors characterized the blades that left the workshop are unknown. If some large, but unknown, percentage of the better blades was taken from each production locus, there is no compelling reason to believe that counting proximal blade sections in workshop debris would provide a measure of workshop output. Good blades could have been sectioned elsewhere. In some contexts, exhausted cores were gleaned for recycling to distant, obsidian-poor settings (e.g., Hintzman 2000), and whatever errors they displayed went with them. This paper tries to use hinge terminations and overshot terminations on blades and their resultant scars on cores as units for counting production errors. The problems with this approach are many and, in my view, they are insurmountable. Not all cores were pointed, and not all primary overshot blades removed the pointed, distal ends of cores. An overshot blade that removed such a core segment might be tabulated as a core error, but it usually is a logical outcome of poor core management, of having allowed the core to become pointed in the first place, which was the real error. At a given locus on a core, detaching an overshot blade can improve the angle between the platform and the working face. So sometimes it is difficult to distinguish between a blade- making error and a skillful core-management action. Successive detachment of blades that are thicker proximally than they are distally leads to torpedo- shaped cores that have diameters smaller at their platform ends, and that thus have obtuse working angles. Successive detachment of blades that are thinner proximally than they are distally leads to more conical cores. Do these cases represent errors? Is each such blade detachment the error, or is the cumulative result of successive detachments the error? Are they blade errors or core errors? A blade that is too thin distally may be too weak for its intended task. It is a blade error, but it may also have compromised the core form just a bit, and a succession of such detachments compounds the problem. Assessing levels of skill from what are incom- plete assemblages sorted in uncertain ways in prehistory and sampled by excavation practices requires a lot of unverifiable assumptions. A preponderance of parallel-sided, exhausted cores (such as those illustrated by Healan on p. 160) is the indelible mark of skilled blade makers. But alongside these findings should be the leavings of novice apprentices, if apprenticeship at workshops was the means by which they learned their craft. Their errors must therefore detract from the overall excellence of workmanship that would otherwise be seen in the workshop refuse. That a final detachment attempt may have terminated short on the core face is an expected outcome of the death of a core when immobilization was lost, not an error chargeable to the blade maker. It just happens. Everyone trying to assess efficiency, skill, and craftsmanship focuses on errors because successes are less visible but, to my mind, no one has arrived at a satisfactory definition of what constitutes an error and how errors should be counted. A lot of the difficulty is in just identifying the errors. Clark revisits these issues in chapter 16 (originally written in 1986), focusing on production of commodities. Building on earlier proposals by Sheets and Torrence, he asks: "Is it possible to measure reliably different levels of skill from individual flaked stone artifacts, or small groups of them, and by so doing infer their corresponding levels of craft specialization?" To answer this question, he develops a "Practice Makes Perfect" model and attempts to track knapping errors, skill, and annual output based on a range of archaeo- logical studies and on the works of modern flintknappers. The results are presented as a series of tables and regression plots that indicate that stoneworkers who practice a lot tend to get pretty good at their craft. I am perplexed at projecting annual output of today's flintknappers, who may have made a single experiment with 50 or 100 individual replicative attempts. I remain unenthusiastic about studies such as this and the previous one; they don't do much for me. My reservations and criticisms aside, Clark's study is a sincere attempt to track the relationship between skill of craftspersons and levels of production and specialization, an area in which he has published reasoned papers for years. The topic remains significant in current literature. The final chapter by Hirth, Kelterborn, Pelegrin, and Andrews takes stock of the current state of affairs and the outlook for the future of Meso-</page><page sequence="10">228 Uttilc Technology, vol.32-2 american lithic studies. The authors stress the value of replicative experiments for providing an emic view of ancient technology, and thus for deriving convincing and duplicatable interpreta- tions and inferences. Among the new directions for future experimenters, that came out of the conference, they especially recognize the use of indirect percussion for producing large eccentrics and note its possible application to core production and refinement. They also recognize the possibility that levers may have been used to detach large pressure blades, such as those at Kaminaljuyu. They stress the importance of having good refer- ence collections to guide replicative studies and the urgency of using fine screens for recovery of the most representative lithic assemblages. And finally, they express their concern that not enough young persons are becoming involved in replicative analysis in lithic studies, especially when the demonstrated value of such studies is so great. It is clear that Mesoamerican Lithic StudiesvňW have a profound role in shaping future research and in encouraging a resurgence in replicative experiments. Comments on the Volume and Future Research The above discussion makes it clear that a broad treatment of replicative experiments and analyses in the lithic technology of ancient Mesoamerica, as suggested by the title of the volume, is actually a much narrower presentation focused heavily on pressure-blade technology and industries. Aside from passing reference, there is no discussion of the chert industries, work in jadeite, lapidaries, the basalt millstone industries, and a range of other topics. Nevertheless, the volume willbe pored over for decades by experimenters and analysts around the world. It is a substantial and weighty volume the likes of which will not be repeated any time soon. Critical to continued progress in experimental research and in unambiguous presentation of analytical results will be effective communication. Given the ages of the current cadre of experimenters, the next generation will have to rely heavily on what is communicated in writing, not on clarifying discussions with those writing today. Perhaps as a carryover from my undergraduate education, I hold taxonomy to be critically impor- tant for scientific discourse. By convention, specific names and terms distinguish things that are different in important ways. When terms are used consistently, everyone understands exactly what is specified and intended. In lithic studies, we are still in the process of reaching agreement on what to call things and there is still much room for improvement. Working in lithic technology in both the Old and New worlds as I do, I see a major problem of communication in an unstandardized terminology in many of the works reported here. Mesoamerican lithic technologists have developed sophisticated analyses that are well grounded in replicative experiments, but much of their dialogue is insular, directed mostly to themselves. This fact was noticed by Clark in his history of research and, for what it is worth, the same criticism can be leveled at some Old World practices. The authors of this volume should be taking a lead in developing a more precise discourse that scholars in other parts of the world will find more understandable. It is worth noting in this regard that pressure-blade industries in obsidian flourished in Anatolia at least 6000 years before they began in Mesoamerica. There is a great need for comparative studies and effective dialogue. Because we are trying to describe technological processes, wherever possible I think we should use technological terms and not mix them with imprecise morphological terms. The use of polyhedral for a blade core prepared and regularized by detaching percussion blades, and prismatici^ one reduced to yield pressure blades, has become nearly standard practice, but it is not the best practice when describing technology. Polyhedral merely implies many-sided, and prismatic means the surface of an object is characterized by regular intersecting planes. So these terms, used to describe reduction stages in technological processes, actually only specify forms, not how those forms came into existence. Because one is writing about percussion-blade cores, and pressure-blade cores, the respective cores should be called that because these terms are technologically specific and indicate the stage and type of lithic reduction that is represented. But what about macrocores ? They are polyhedral too, just bigger and less refined. They are very large, early-stage percussion-blade cores.</page><page sequence="11">Book Review - Hirth - Mesoamerican Lithie Technology: ... 229 What most Mesoamericanists call polyhedral cores could better be termed late-stage percussion-blade cores, ox regularized percussion-blade cores. The fact that the detached percussion blades were not generally the desired end products, but often were discarded as waste where cores were produced, is irrelevant. The issue is that percussion was the technological action that produced cores for ultimate pressure reduction. In some of the works reviewed here, prismatic blade , a morphological term, refers strictly to the technological category of pressure blades, but only those with trapezoidal cross-sections; those with triangular cross-sections are not consistently considered prismatic. Pressure blades of whatever cross-section should be called pressure blades, because technologically that is what they are. If a cross-sectional distinction is needed, a morpho- logical qualifier is in order. (In fairness, it is worth noting here the common usage among Old World analysts of the term prismatic to characterize percussion-blade cores of several configurations, which is just as imprecise.) Describing bifacial work with reference to faces and marginsis better than referring to the sides of the workpiece. In one instance in the volume, side refers to the margins of a bifacial workpiece; in another, it refers to the working face of a blade core. Hinges and steps are terminations of fractures, not fractures themselves. We (including many Old World analysts, who started the practice) are still stuck with blades (a technological category) being defined metrically, more than twice as long as wide. But not all linear flakes are blades. It is time to commit to the fact that blades are linear products detached in series from blade cores, a technological designation. Microblades should not be distinguished by their widths just because they are narrow. Blade width generally diminishes as core diameter decreases during reduction. Microblades are small bladelets detached by pressure from microblade cores. Archaeologists have always been an informal lot when it comes to terminology. As lithic technologists, it is time we speak and write in a clear and consistent language of technology. The suggestions made here are offered solely as encouragement for more effective communication. How they are received depends on how much one wants to be understood clearly, and on how much one wants to understand clearly. The Mexico technique of pressure-blade detachment seems fully confirmed for the Sixteenth Century central Mexican highlands. It could be accepted as /Ae technique used there, and thus become one of the orthodoxies abhorred by Sheets, were it not for the technological variability suggested in several chapters of this volume. As noted, the technique may have been only one of several that must have existed across space and time in the area. Pressure-blade technology evolved in Mesoamerica over a period of nearly 2,500 years. The history of techniques used to detach blades must have been varied and complicated, reflecting both the growth of technical knowledge and regional or local accommodations to specific conditions. Some of this spatial and temporal variation has now become clear. Other cases, such as the reduction of cores fully in the round at Tula vs. only partially around the perimeter at Otumba, illustrate regional variation, the reasons for which can and should be determined. Discovering the historical geography of the techniques used to reduce pressure-blade cores is possible through careful, problem-driven assemblage analysis combined with well-reasoned replicative experiments. It should become a major goal of technological analysis of Mesoamerican pressure-blade industries. I expect that future work will reveal interesting new techniques of core management and blade production that were largely material-driven, involving the use of small- cobble sources and of cores already substantially reduced in workshops near major stone sources. The future here is bright. The reasons for the transition to pecked-and- ground core platforms have not been explained adequately. That they allow blade detachment with less force and better control seems clear. But the need to produce ever greater quantities of pressure blades could not have been the ultimate cause if a single blade maker could satisfy the needs of 6000 - 10,000 persons, as is now claimed. Perhaps this platform treatment was an accommodation to new materials used in pressure bits for detaching blades (ç/CTitmus and Clark, p. 92). If so, these materials</page><page sequence="12">23û Uthic Technology, vQl.32-2 had to have been organic. If inorganic, they should have been found more frequently by now. It is time these materials were identified and routinely employed in replicative experiments. One or more very dense and tough hardwoods may be implicated. Titmus has shown the utility of granadillo for the bit of the itzcolotli he uses so successfully. This generic name is widely used in Latin America for several tropical hardwood taxa, but it probably includes three distinct species of the genus Dalbergia (rosewood), native to Honduras and Guatemala. Perhaps it is D. cubilquitzensis, an important timber of these countries. This wood is characterized as "basically orange with more or less violet striping . . . moderately hard, heavy, tough, and strong" (Record and Hess 1943:258). Because of their utility in the lumber trade, there is a substantial literature on tropical hardwoods (e.g., Record and Meli 1924; Record and Hess 1943; Chudnoff 1984). Ross's (1989) supplement to Chudnoff is a useful listing of the known common names of tropical hardwoods, together with scientific names and the countries in which the vernacular names are used. Talking to locals and to timbermen in southern Mesoamerica should elicit suggestions of identifiable woods suitable for experimental trial as pressure bits. Perhaps a rod made of the heartwood of a particular tropical hardwood, very dense and tough, without visible rings from rapid seasonal growth periods, and rounded to a blunt tip, would work successfully for blade detachment using a variety of pressing tools. Such a material might work also for punches for indirect percussion experiments in obsidian blade-core production. Possible candidates include Dalbergia and Guaiacum spp. (Lignum-vitae; tested for its possibilities by Clark [1985]). Lignum-vitae is also resinous and oily. Its use should be explored again, especially in conjunction with core platforms weakened by pecking and left rough by grinding. Hardwood bits might be implicated through analysis of bulb attributes on blades. Attention was drawn in the volume to distinctive attributes of bulbs that result when different materials are used for pressure bits. Several authors discussed the use of antler for tools used in working obsidian, and favorable results were shown in detaching pressure blades from obsidian cores using that material. Heretofore, the antlers of the native deer species of Mesoamerica have generally been the topic of discussion but have been disdained because of their small size, although several small punches have been reported. But there may have been another possibility. Citing Gilmore (1947), Baker (1956), and Hall and Kelson (1959), Bryant and Maser (1982:30) wrote: "it is known that Merriam elk [Cervus elaphus merriami' were present in the limi- ted mountain ranges of Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and the Mexican states of Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila, and south- ward to western Hidalgo and Durango. . . . Merriam elk probably were not abundant in Mexico, and the process of their becoming extinct appears to have been rapid following the sixteenth century." So the availability of large and heavy antler material in the central highlands of ancient Mesoamerica seems a certainty. The American Elk is conspecific with the European Red Deer, and antlers of the latter were used extensively for stoneworking in European prehistory. The Merriam subspecies has been extinct for a century now, but structurally the antlers probably differed little from those of the Rocky Mountain Elk, which is abundant and widespread. Its antler is readily available. It should be possible to carry out realistic experiments with elk antler as raw material for pressure bits, and to compare the bulb attributes of blades thus produced with those recovered archaeologically. Tools made from the wall of the beam of an elk antler may also have been used for punches for the production of complex eccentrics. Antler and hardwood should become the focus of concerted experimental research in Mesoamerican lithic technology. Differential use of these materials for pressure bits may help explain why, in the Ucareo region, single-facet platforms pre- dominated in pressure-blade core reduction through all but the latest Postclassic, while other regions that used the same source material had long switched over to the use of pecked-and-ground platforms. It is, at least, a working hypothesis. It is astonishing that a generation has passed since the publication of John Clark's article, "Platforms, Bits, Punches, and Vices . . .," in Lithic</page><page sequence="13">Book Review - Hirth - Mesoamerican Lithie Technology: ... 231 Technology in 1985. During that time we have all gotten a generation older, and most accomplished experimental analysts working today do not have another generation of time remaining. We are not training the next generation fast enough. Too few students are sufficiently motivated to put in the years necessary to learn flintworking at a very high level of skill, which is the minimum foundation for effective experimental replicative analysis. Aside from Titmus's work with the Mexico technique, no one has stepped up to the plate to take the work significantly further. It is now time to train more qualified experimenters, and to return to the chipping floor for another round of replicative experiments in pressure-blade technology. Mesoamerican Lithic Technology has identified a host of problems that beg for solution. That may be its most lasting contribution. A trabajar!
