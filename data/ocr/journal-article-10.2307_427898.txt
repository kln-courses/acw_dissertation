<plain_text><page sequence="1">HERBERT M. SCHUELLER Romanticism Reconsidered ON JUNE 5, 1960, there appeared in the New York Times three passages which every student of romanticism must have noticed. The one was a review by John Canaday of two books on the art and life of Michel- angelo, and it reads thus: ... Michelangelo's Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel was seen by his younger contemporaries, in an age of mannerism, as merely a virtuoso manifestation of perfect mastery in representing the naked human body-although the "merely" is our word, not theirs. The huge fresco has also been seen as an expression of the Counter Refor- mation on one hand, and as a Protestant sermon on the other. In the Age of Enlightenment, The Last Judgment was not much admired. But the romantics-first Stendhal and then Delacroix- discovered in it the spiritual passion that made Delacroix call Michelangelo "the father of mod- ern art." Romantic attitudes dominate people's vision of art today; thus for twentieth-century tourists who visit the Sistine Chapel and respond romantically to an art that has affected other men in other ways, Delacroix, even if they have never heard of the romantic intellectual, becomes the father of Michelangelo. The second passage-in an article by Har- old C. Schonberg about Robert Schumann -carries an essential contradiction of Mr. Canaday's assertion that our attitudes today are romantic: Ours is an anti-romantic age, a scientifico-psy- chiatrico-nonobjectivo-atomico age, one that al- ternates between tearing the seventh veil from the subconscious and working out satellite orbits HERBERT M. SCHUELLER is chairman of the depart- ment of English at Wayne State University, De- troit. His article "Friedrich Kainz as Aesthetician" appeared in the Fall 1961 issue of this Journal. on electronic computers. Its coat of arms would depict a beaker of heavy water, mixed with a swizzle stick, on a background of gray flannel. Much of its art is a carefully assembled parallelo- gram of lines and colors derived from the propo- sitions of Euclid. Some of its music not only re- sembles the severe mathematics produced by the electronic computers; it actually is being com- posed by electronic computers. Thus it is no great surprise that the most ro- mantic of all the romantics should find his anni- versary virtually ignored. It is no surprise, but it is ironical. For Robert Schumann, born 150 years ago on June 8, 1810, was one of the great origi- nals of music, perhaps the greatest. But his message runs counter to today's esthetic tastes. The third passage is again a review of Mi- chelangelo's work, but this-by Robert J. Clements and about the poetry-avoids any statement about romantics or romanticism at all: ... However, his poetry, composed for his per- sonal gratification or private communication, re- quired no one's approval. Thought mattered more than finished form. The purging of emotion, the relief of confession, the sublimation of passion, the sounding the depths of his own conscience- these were what mattered. Why the description of what romanticism possibly is but the avoidance of the term? One might of course ask this question of Mr. Clements himself, but instead one may safely conjecture that anyone who at this late date uses the word "romanticism" for literature or who even attempts to struggle with a definition of it can be accused of temerity indeed. What explanations have we not heard? Romanticism is the resurgence of medieval- ism, we are told, or the medievalizing tend-</page><page sequence="2">360 HERBERT M. SCHUELLER ency; in contrast to health and classicism, it is sickness; it is emotion in full display, though primarily emotion not about form, but about a content; it can reveal the infi- nite, in the direction of which it tends; it is the reconciliation of opposites and the man- ifestation of free will as compared with ne- cessity; it is the rediscovery of nature, and at the same time a kind of religious panthe- ism; it is the renascence of wonder, and while it involves freedom, it also results in gloom and disaffection. It stresses subjectiv- ity, but at the same time is allied with the spurious objectivity of science. Escaping into what the individual desires, it cele- brates suicide, which is the apparent denial of life, though it also celebrates life in its richness and multiplicity. A kind of neo- platonism, a mysticism, a transcendental- ism, it yet attempts to grapple with the phe- nomenon of perception and to discover the truths hiding behind it. It is indeed hard to see how some of these conceptions, even those most tenaciously held, can cover romanticism. Can imagina- tion in theory or in practice indeed be thought to be its essence? One cannot see how. Without imagination there is no art at all-classical, baroque, or romantic. Also, the originality and creativity often associ- ated with romanticism as its hallmarks are unextolled aspects of classicism too. The question here must then concern the types of imagination, originality, or creativity in- volved, and their scope. How can romanti- cism be diseased, despite Goethe and Faust? How can one agree with Brunetibre that romanticism is the order of the art of the day (classicism being that of the day before)? How can it be emotion taking the place of reason, or how can it be the liberation of the unconscious (classicism being under the governance of the conscious mind)? Why is its uniqueness the renascence of wonder or strangeness added to beauty? How can it be the subject or spirit counting more than form, or how can it be mostly suggestion and symbol? Surely it is an error to endow it with expression as its peculiar character- istic. All art is expression, and inexpressive art is a contradiction in terms. It is a common cry that each of the usual characterizations of romanticism fails to hit the mark, that it is too specific in its par- ticularity, and that, as describing the part, it fails to encounter the whole. All of these characterizations-one hesitates to call them definitions-have one thing in common, however: At their core they give evidence that romanticism is the tendency to break the confines, the rules, the limits, to go be- yond that which has been crystallized. All seem part of one group and all as a group seem to be symbols of the will, first to de- stroy, or disintegrate, and then to rebuild or create. None of them is inclusive enough, and because the idea of romanticism persists despite the unsatisfactory quality of the limitations given it, all of them must be in- cluded in something broader. There is pas- sion, for instance, in both classicism and ro- manticism, but that of romanticism is more varied, more intense, less "normal." Pope was a passionate poet, but romantic poets cover a wider range of passions. The broader, more widely encompassing thing is the psychological fact that at times the hu- man will demands expansion; it desires by expansion to destroy the old and create the new; at certain times it expands further than at others; sometimes the desire is for perfectibility, for example, in whatever terms it is to be realized. It does not want to renew or renovate; it does not want to repeat or codify; classifications are inimical to it in its extremest phases. The impulse is dynamic, and the possibilities for success seem to it infinite. Romanticism is the higher degree of everything achieved by whatever means, and in realizing itself it destroys what frustrates it, and especially if these are conventions. In this paper roman- ticism is described as deriving from the urge of the human psyche to go beyond the hu- man confines in which it finds itself. It wants to go beyond the present in time, the present place in space, the forms of expres- sion and speech in which it is bound, the orders, organizations, and arrangements existing in economic, religious, and politi- cal life, the forms already set and declared in art, the confines of outward public life, the restrictions placed upon the individual. "My sole desire...," wrote Benjamin Con- stant, "was to give myself up to those primi- tive and passionate feelings which throw the</page><page sequence="3">Romanticism Reconsidered 361 mind out of harmony with the ordinary world and inspire contempt for all about one." Romanticism is the revolutionary urge towards the novel; even the apparent repetition of something old must bring about something new. One may call it an escape, as others have done, but in its more admirable aspects, it is richly creative of the new and original. Kathleen Nott sees the essential impulse of romanticism as a hu- maneness based on the belief that men and women may and must ask what questions they please about society and the emotions, about the heavens and the moral law. But it also insists that nothing must stand in the way of truthful answers, and here it may be thought to put up a common front with science. Romanticism, then, can be expected to try to go beyond the powers of human per- ception and knowledge themselves-that is, beyond these powers as they are commonly interpreted. For it would not confine knowl- edge to discursive and pragmatic varieties. Intuition, while it is still the starting-point of scientific endeavor, is here on the verge of being Kant's with a difference and as something more. Kant, on whose philosophy Coleridge's thought is often credited for be- ing based, because their terminologies often seem to be identical, asserted that human knowledge is based on sense-perception, but that the knowledge of God is closed to the mind. Like Cassirer and Susanne Langer in our day, however, Coleridge dearly desired to break apart the limits of knowledge it- self: God, he thought, was knowable in the absolute sense. Thus a romanticism like Coleridge's derives, not from Kant's idea of the limitations of human understanding, but on the idea, platonic or neoplatonic, that the illimitable can be known, that eter- nal truths can be perceived. Kant's negative limitation succumbs to Coleridge's more generous if more mistaken notion of the powers of the human mind. The Infinite Power of the universe transcends the me- chanical, the physical, the sensuous; man is in mystical harmony with the universe, and through this harmony he in security derives a knowledge of the universe which is its truth. This is direct, immanent truth, not discursive knowledge, and even the dream, the most irrational of human activities, can contribute to it. Scientific knowledge, then, valid in its own way reveals that it has limitations despite its source in intuition, and Valery's assertion that the problem of aesthetics is that of poetic truth is a deduc- tion, in a more restricted realm of endeavor, from Coleridge's position. Throughout romanticism, therefore, there is an idealism which is sometimes overt, sometimes latent, but always present. Romantic literature often carries the unex- pressed latent form which philosophy has made explicit. To destroy wilfully is to deny that circumstances correspond to the ideal; to create or renew is to attempt to reach the ideal or bring it back. The will to change is a will to transform actuality into the ideal and the ideal into actuality, and while all revolution can be thus described it is in ro- mantic literature that it is graphically por- trayed through concrete image and exam- ple. In one sense, then-the ideal one-ro- manticism is an attempt to transcend the mundane and the human, even though the human mind is the agency by which this transcendence must be achieved; the diffi- culty is that the only agency which the hu- man mind has for transcending itself is it- self, and that in terms of this function it must be an agent between the sensuous, the experiential, and the existential in man on the one hand, and the eternal possibilities beyond the veil of human common-sense and scientific understanding on the other. It aims at destroying conventional schemata and discovering what these schemata are hiding. It denies the general and universal "truths" of classicism-to set up its own. In a sense, Goethe as both classicist and, at times, romanticist, combined both views when he wrote Faust. As Santayana says, there is a certain transcendental idealism in it according to which the world is made the expression of a spiritual endeavor. Though we hear much about the philosophical as- pects of Faust, it is human experience which it celebrates. Its philosophy is that of strife, is the notion that whoever strives may stray and that in such straying he will find his own salvation. Faust is more romantic poem than drama, a carnival of images, Santayana</page><page sequence="4">362 HERBERT M. SCHUELLER calls it, "to amuse," "to thrill," and "to hu- manize." Just as some romantic works have lauded Catholicism, or at least a new Mid- dle Ages, so Faust celebrates a new pagan- ism coming from Greece by way of Italy. This paganism becomes a philosophical ad- venture; it spells rebellion against conven- tion, a flight to nature and beauty. It celebrates the pursuit itself, the eternal rest- lessness of the ego. This is the philosophical journey which Goethe describes, and it is the divine itself which he has in view. Per- haps the most typical of romantic heroes, Faust gains his experience without regard for the ruin he calls down upon others. Though romanticism may be a style culti- vated by civilized people, it is often a ruth- less primitivism and their own egotism which romanticists celebrate. Thus roman- ticism is a paradox: the man becomes the child, or at least imitates him in his irre- sponsibility. At the same time, the romanti- cist like Faust is never a hypocrite. Since codes of conduct exist for him only to be destroyed, his behavior is above suspicion in his eyes and beyond criticism, no matter how childish and destructive it may be. The rational man may transcend the material one, but his reason must work with and go beyond matter to find what even bright- eyed barbarians might achieve. Individual- ism works to show that everything is new, self-determined, unpredictable because non- codifiable, unforseeable, but that every- thing is also human and universal. It is odd therefore that the rise of science and especially of empiricism should by some people be equated with romanticism. It is true that both science and art begin with the intuitive moment, but the fact is that thorough-going romanticists, among whom we can count Shelley, when they play at science treat it as merely another path to the world beyond, to the world which everyday perception seems not to disclose. In these terms poetic apperception seems to be like scientific intuition, an attempt to see the universal in the concrete. Faust scoffs at sci- ence, but at the same time tries to go be- yond it: Thus the "comic" aspect of magic. It is primarily the magic of science which the romanticist prefers, not science as it categorizes and exposes. The magic of science is in a sense at one with the magic-the hiddenness-of the past. That classical figure Helen of Troy, lover of Faust and mother of Euphorion, prototype of Byron, serves in a romantic way to give magic to the ideal of persons. It is of course a difficult question why roman- ticism should return to classicism or why any romanticism should return to the past. But the point is not merely that these pe- riods and their attendant philosophies and works of art are returned to and "de- stroyed," as it were, but that they are used for the purposes of the romantic writer: Old ceremonials and mysteries as a matter of course embrace the myth which absorbs the individual into a possible new univer- sality. Thus it might almost seem bad form to praise the world and life openly, except as they carry the individual out of himself, "transport" him, so to speak. If Faust glori- fies the return from Christianity to pagan- ism, other works glorify the change from paganism to Christianity. In both instances the soul supposedly is liberated and breaks apart the bonds of traditional faith and tra- ditional morals; the erotic, for instance, that focal point for the moral theory of the com- mon man, is the source of a new morality now to be realized; seduction, which ac- cording to Geoffrey Clive, is the aim of the most romantic of heroes which they accom- plish both literally and metaphorically, is a self-conscious thwarting of convention and responsibility and a deliberate succumbing to mood; the seducer is responsible only to his own non-hypocritical inwardness, and to nothing else. But this is in keeping with notions of the "natural" man, who is the French Revolution of personal relations. But humanitarianism has its way too, and nothing is more sincere than romanticism in its humanitarian sentiment. Society, either undefined or in conso- nance with any institution one dislikes, is to be opposed in terms of liberalism and of that "natural" man whom it supposedly had put in chains. In giving high place to the ignorant, the savage, the child and the child-like, romanticism is anti-intellectual, but this is because the learned, the civilized, and the sophisticated as well as the intel- lectual have been found wanting. Again</page><page sequence="5">Romanticism Reconsidered 363 there is a phenomenon directed by the urge to break apart the bonds of existence here and now, to extend existence for the indi- vidual beyond the confines of the twenty or twenty-five persons each of us is fated to pass our lives with. The romanticist wants his life to expand beyond these confines: The poor, the innocent, the unfortunate are idealized, and one may, in the midst of a situation whose outlines are unclear and in- determinate, not see a great deal of differ- ence between Christian and pagan mysti- cism on the one hand and the delving into the social depths outside the boundaries of one's social class on another. Thus romanticism has some of the quali- ties of religion: It wants to forsake the world as it is and create a new one; it de- sires the amelioration of the world's ills, social, political, moral; the concrete recom- mendations for change may differ and even contradict one another, or, as in Shelley's Prometheus Unbound, be so indeterminate as to be useless, but the ideal remains the same; therefore it often recognizes its own employment of the dream with its corollary in art: The democratic ideal, for instance, is dreamed of and then in art realized. There is even a religion beyond religion: Faust never questions selling or risking his own soul, for instance; he has no faith and no fear; he is beyond all of this. He is hop- ing to escape into universal nature, into something infinite, peaceful, nonsensuous. He wants to go beyond Christian doctrine and Christian law, and he expects to find this haven in the grandiose effects of nature, caves and mountains and clouds, and so forth. At the same time Faust illustrates the point that the romanticist must always be dissatisfied; he is the perfect example of Schopenhauerian philosophy concretized; no matter what he attains, he cannot achieve the illimitable so long as he himself is on earth. His pessimism embraces at first only the present; his optimism embraces the fu- ture which must be different from the past no matter how much it is based on the past and how much it is seen to be original in its own way. But then the pessimism returns because the idealized future is too slow in coming. The Golden Age, the "peaceable kingdom," is not yet. Thus his dissatisfac- tion is an eternal thing. The vision of the universe before him, he is like Satan in Paradise Regained, someone constantly frustrated in his attempt to subdue his op- ponent. He does not want the reality of everyday forms, and so he must find it in himself. Brunetiere saw romanticism as the display of the writer's ego, or as a "system- atic reduction of the spectacle of the vast world to the range of the poet's or novelist's personal view." He wants all reality and all experience to be his own. He is not abstrac- tive, but absorbed by anthropomorphic life- forms. Wanting to realize what the pleni- tude of life is and to experience it in the fulness of its possibilities, he is painfully aware that life is a state of flux, that it is ruthless in its temporal direction, infinite in its variety, and absolutely inconstant. And so a character like Faust tries to render him- self universal. This of course he cannot do, though, like Tennyson's Ulysses, he ac- cepts even death as an adventure like any other, life being ideal in its pursuit, if not in its attainment, and even death, which too is a disintegration of a convention-that of living-being a romantic possibility of ex- perience. One may be bewildered but one is free. "To be miscellaneous, to be indefinite, to be unfinished, is essential to the romantic life," writes Santayana. Time and space in their imperfect ways flow into eternity. Destructive to begin with, as has been said, romanticism also builds. It is a process much dependent on the very times it tries to deny. Fond of the relative constancy of the myth, it is antimechanical, antiempiri- cal. Enthusiastic about deductive philoso- phies like platonism and Indian philosophy, it is acting according to its nature to espouse metaphysics; it rejects science because in its antimetaphysical way science does not go far enough, and accepts it only as it makes its peace with the "realities" of transcend- ent speculation. Even truth, then, is transcendant. But be- cause the demonstration and proof of such truth comes with difficulty, the romanticist makes a distinction between inner and outer kinds of truth and at the same time blends and confuses them. Ideas are behind matter and yet also in the minds of human beings. The outer kind of truth can be</page><page sequence="6">364HERBERT M. SCHUELLER tested by way of correspondence; the inner only by way of the organistic and coherence. While its source may be less thought than the dream, inner truth carries a conviction which the more inferior and outer truth lacks. In a fashion characteristic of the lit- erary man, who distrusts distinctions and seldom makes them well-Coleridge even distrusted definition. Hugo said that the artist's aim is the complete truth of life. Yet the romanticist is not content with gen- eral truth, but strives for the truth of in- dividuality, and this is best tested in terms of the organic and of coherence. The ro- manticist in a sense asks for an inner cir- cularity. When he says that he has truth, he means an almost undemonstrable inner truth. Probably he means only his own con- viction of its presence, but he insists that it has been achieved in deed and in fact. Look- ing for individual truths, he is really search- ing for new permanent, universal, and in- tellectual truths supported by inner human conviction and supplanting the old truths which have proved to be spurious. He looks for laws and orders not yet recognized. There is a correspondence between the romanticist's acceptance of truth as coher- ence and his devotion to art as kinds of or- ganisms as to form. As someone who ac- cepts truth as coherence, the romantic is usually an organicist. He assumes that the world is a whole, that the universe is a whole, and, furthermore, that his insight penetrates both. His whole is different from that of the scientist, of course, and the epis- temological difference between his and the scientist's is marked. As the scientist as- sumes that the world is a whole he is an idealist as is the romantic; but what the scientist is aiming for is a complete under- standing of the whole; the romanticist as- sumes he is living in and already under- stands that whole; the scientist knows that he is making an assumption and that the road to complete understanding is a long one. The romanticist, however, has a tend- ency to avoid realizing the hypothetical na- ture of his assumptions; he is more content to ask of us a faith that he is in contact with the organic completeness around him, and in his seeming arrogance he claims to use other faculties than understanding-to use intuition and imagination-to support his assertion that he has indeed grasped and penetrated the whole. He assumes that his own powers are beyond the ordinary per- ceptive and rational ones of men. He asks us to accept what we cannot see and what we cannot usually experience or sense. This is why he makes a great to-do about feeling and emotion. These are not transferable; their expression is only second-hand. But the romanticist wants us to give great sig- nificance to them as they are expressed and therefore as they symbolize the presence of his cognitive insights. In turn and in his own terms he has seen and expressed his in- sights about Greek art, the Italian Renais- sance, the Middle Ages, indigenous poetry, the folk-song, the thought and art of the Orient. He has represented his way of ap- proaching life and art as essentially right and unique and consonant with the insights of the past. Thus some Romantics like Herder, for instance, ask us to accept their new methodology, and others like Blake and Yeats with less reason ask us to accept systems which they themselves created. In a sense they ask for the dissolution of the artistic in its present form, and of us they ask a religious devotion for and trust in new forms which it is frequently hard to give. It is an interesting fact that the romantic in asking for this dissolution of old artistic processes also asks us to accept an opposi- tion within activity which it is hard to bring to a resolution. He asks us to abandon harmonic simplicity and sharp outlines. Thus his interest in synaesthesia and in modes of action and kinds of material in which separate arts like literature and mu- sic cross over one into another and are co- operative and even identical at certain points. As breaker apart of the conven- tional and the current, the romantic artist thinks of himself as an original genius un- bound by the prescriptions of the past; it is not only that he threatens the very boundaries of the arts; it is not only that he is under the illusion that his own creativity is spontaneous; it is not only that he is un- der the illusion that his personality has unique rights in its extremest phases (he of course ignores the rights of others and for- gets that in asserting the rights of one</page><page sequence="7">Romanticism Reconsidered 365 group like the poor he is denying the rights of others like the rich); it is not only that he tries to unify sensibility by bringing the naturalistic and the idealistic into a coher- ence; but it is also that in striving for the eternal and the infinite he elevates reason to a position of eminence, as did Friedrich Schlegel, Schiller, and Kant. But with him, reason, which becomes a kind of free-float- ing abstraction, is both conscious and unconscious; the conscious reason is the old- fashioned type of classicism; the uncon- scious is the new, the vital, the kind whose depths have not beei plumbed and whose powers, not being defined or definable, are probably beyond the bounds of the physi- cal human brain. The romantic, in other words, wants to develop and liberate the subconscious in man, not to destroy or deny it; he wants to plumb the depths of his own individuality to find what is hidden there, to express what up to his time has not been expressed and is expressible, but which has actually been suppressed. What he calls reason is only his own internal logic. Thus the predominance in his thinking of the ex- pressive theory which justifies the catharsis through creativity of the individual ex- pressor. Thus the romanticist justifies his own visions, fancies, and emotions. He tac- itly likens himself to God. The emotions he subjects to analyses; he does not limit them to "proper" emotions for proper actions, as Aristotle does; he studies his own instincts; though in the end he cannot destroy the mystery they represent. The solution of the problem which is left after old forms have been dissolved is or- ganic unity. But it is not the harmony of the classicist; measure and harmony are less important to the romanticist than wilful ex- travagance if it gets to the point. Again, the romanticist uses an old idea for his own purposes. The classicist was concerned with a harmony simple as to issue and clear as to outline, whereas the romanticist is desirous of the organic form in which the incoherent coheres. The difference is in the method of production, not in the fact of form itself. When the current forms are being broken and the limits of the human imagination exceeded, then there is romanticism. For- malism per se is often mistakenly thought to be classical; but instead it is the essence of classicism to use form as the vehicle for the transfer of ideas commonly accepted as general and universal. Romanticism, on the other hand, which is also an attempt to transcend the local in time and place, does not, like classicism, compress, contrast, con- strict, "formalize"; it relaxes, expands, breaks the formulae. Classicism imitates "reality" to idealize it and refer back to it; romanticism employs pieces and aspects of reality to create another possibly entirely different world. It is the violation of old laws and rules; it tries to exceed the re- strictions even of human thought. It is an attempt in its paradoxical realistic-idealistic way to allow for all of the manifold differ- ences within life itself, and in so doing to combine the contradictory and the polar and the multiple. The inner world and the outer world, the world and the mind, both, like truth, must seem as if organically one. Their harmony comes from within, not as an addition or superimposition, but as a withinness of the many-sidednesses of ex- perience. The romanticist is not plainly a constructivist; to him forms per se are in- sufficient; thus the Kantian notion of beauty as form is classical. Antithesis and paradox are of the essence of the romanticist's or- ganic form, and romantic irony, so called, the reconciliation of opposites, the unity of the multiplicities of which we are aware si- multaneously. Embracing all of life, the romanticist tries to encompass the world through artistic form and bring together the polarities of experience by vibrating back and forth between them while he makes them one. The romanticist, rather than es- pousing the sickness of Goethe's formula, pursues both sickness and health. He is no art-for-art's saker, but an admirer of all forms of life fully pulsating and realized. For him the forms of art are not abstract, but correspondences with the forms of life in their depth and intensity. Yet as he strives for organic unity the ro- manticist seems to be misled by a mirage, by a muddying of outlines-though of course somewhat as life in its vitality mud- dies them. As it supposedly reconciles op- posites, as Coleridge, Schelling, and Hegel said it does, as it seems to be a kind of rhet-</page><page sequence="8">366 HERBERT M. SCHUELLER oric of opposite or discordant factors, it combines sameness with difference, novelty with the familiar, idea with realistic mirage; but since here too he must be in large part frustrated, the romanticist declares his in- capacities by way of incompleteness and fragmentation in his works. Thus it is one of the characteristics of a romantic to attempt an identification with two organic unities, that of nature and that of art. Romanticism has allied man with na- ture to recognize, not man's lordliness over nature (as classicism did), but his member- ship in it. Realizing his physiological in- significance, man as romanticist identifies himself with that which is far greater and far more enigmatic than he, and he there- fore adopts the attitude described by Kant's "sublimity," according to which man's moral quality transcends everything and becomes a universe (of which even nature is only a part). Unfortunately, man's tran- scendence over the universe in romanticism proper frequently becomes the transcend- ence of the individual subjectivity over the universe. Man identifies himself with na- ture to rise above and include that which physically and conceptually is beyond him. Paul Elmer More calls it an illusion of ro- manticism that one can behold the infinite within the frame of nature itself. The result is that he need only identify God with na- ture to become a pantheist. Smaller than nature, man struggles constantly to under- stand her; and romanticism holds that man's moral and imaginative powers, not being limited in any sense, can go way be- yond what they seemingly can encompass. Thus the human ego transcends everything and becomes everything; it becomes one with Spirit. Hume and Berkeley gave philo- sophical support for Christopher North's notion that we create at least nine-tenths of what appears externally: The one side of the coin is that the individual mind encom- passes as it is encompassed by the world; the other is that it is the world. In the end, then, the romanticist vibrates between the poles of the universal ego or spirit and the individual one. Thus when it is said that the human, not being merged in the divine, finds the divine merged in it, it is the human ego in its pride and arrogance which is speaking. There is nothing which better illustrates this pride than the high place in the scheme of things which the literary man has given himself. As artist, he supersedes the philoso- pher. According to Balzac in The Hidden Masterpiece, the vision of art is not to copy nature, but to give it expression. Thus it is the artist who expresses and knows the uni- versal. And Baudelaire saw Balzac as a vi- sionary and passionate romantic who cre- ated a private world. Brunetiere saw romanticism as a display of the writer's ego and a systematic reduction of the spectacle of the vast world to the range of the poet's or the novelist's personal vision. For "na- ture" one can read "universe," all of which the artist has at his expressive disposal. But to go beyond his physical and psychological confines the artist, always working with the image, must become a myth-maker. Thus in attempting to go beyond time and space and the necessity which we call cause and effect, and even reason itself, romanticism did indeed follow some of the practices with which it is credited. It did concentrate on inner experience because outer experience with the outer world was inadequate. It did make for liberalism of all kinds, in art particularly in a devotion to the grotesque which classicism had for- bidden and to the subliminity which, as with Paradise Lost, it sometimes rejected. Romanticism did go back to the Middle Ages; it did try to transcend realistic re- production in art. Trying to avoid the mere giving of information, because reportage could not be its aim, it directed itself to- wards expression, which extended from that of sentimental melancholy and vague aspiration to that of wonder at the rational and coherent order of the universe of things as reflected in the human mind. It did stress emotion rather than reason. It was in large part anti-intellectual because emotions ex- press the desire of the ego, and romanti- cism-let me say again-is the emanation of the will and a tremendous push towards a realization of that ideal. To be sure, in terms of epistemology it tends towards sol- ipsism and in terms of ethics towards ir-</page><page sequence="9">Romanticism Reconsidered 367 responsibility; but it does liberate the un- conscious mind and it grapples with the real world in terms of what it should be. In many ways it did concentrate more on "spirit," as Grierson said, than on form, and yet it grappled with form less to fill out a prescribed formula than to create new, more flexible molds. With its devotion to vagueness it admired suggestiveness and the symbol, and with its enthusiasm for imagi- nation it had a rage for a new correctness. By way of pantheism and enthusiasm it did return to nature to bring the ego in a mysterious coordination and cooperation with the universe. Neglecting the past ex- cept as it could transform it and looking to the future, romanticism in its extreme form asked for the impossible: that is, the ab- solutely independent realization of the ideal in an absolutely original way which is inno- cent of formulas and of eclecticism. Literary and aesthetic theory is not of course independent of artistic practice and works. Definition must be grounded on ob- jects. Thus it is apropos to quote again from Geoffrey Clive, who in The Romantic En- lightenment says that romanticism arose because traditional forms of feeling and ex- planation (many of them still rooted in the Middle Ages) proved inadequate to cope with the increasing complexities of modern life. Thus what has been called its rage for incorrectness merely means its rage to de- stroy what is mistakenly supposed to be correct. Anti-didactic in theory, it yet wants to discover and disseminate its own laws. One cannot but emphasize that romanticism is both destructive and creative in the broadest senses of these words. Carlyle venerated a kind of pragmatic greatness, Flaubert the artist who was divinely ap- pointed, Nietzsche the autonomous aristo- crat of impulse-all as being superior to conventional drudging morality. This does not mean that they denied the existence of a true morality, though the hero and the femme fatale seem to do so, but they sup- posed that the natural genius could dis- cover the true morality by destroying what obstructed his path: Relying on his own ego, the romantic universalizes himself. To a limited view of humanity and its capaci- ties the romanticist opposes a richly broad view embracing aspiration and the contents of the unconscious; to conventional beauty he may add strangeness, peculiarity, or the picturesque; the plodding factual study of history he replaces with reinterpretations of people, events, and epochs in terms of the picturesque; to conventional prosaic thought he opposes symbol and myth; to set patterns of thought and form and to the correspondence theory of truth he op- poses the evolving, the organic, and the coherent; in terms of judgment, which is not opposed to emotion, as many histories of literature would suggest, but on a level with it as a concomitant of all of our con- scious states, the romanticist rejects pub- licly accepted norms, standards, and uni- versals, and considers for adoption new, privately accepted ones. He thinks himself free to participate in an evolving universe composed of evolving principles; thus his work is never complete; like the God of Schelling, he is realizing himself in time, and the very fragmentation and incomplete- ness of his work testifies, he thinks, to its ultimate organic coherence within itself and with the outside world. Language and art must, then, be free to express an outer world whose "truth" is not grasped by sci- ence and whose inner nature can be grasped only through humanistic identity with its essence, all of which art expresses. In this sense literary art as it denies the uniformity of the world of truth is both escape and wish-fulfillment. To talk about romanticism in literature is to talk in the broadest of terms, not only about "form," but also-and primarily- about world-views, attitudes, and assump- tions. In philosophy as in overt action ro- manticism seems to run from errant foolish- ness to sublimity, from a shade of sanity to psychopathic insanity. And yet no liter- ary phenomenon is romantic one hundred per cent; for no writer or literary or artistic work is worth its salt unless it resists classi- fication: Each is ultimately a class by itself for which there may even be no name. And no historical period is one hundred per cent romantic either. Each person, each work, and each age is a complex of elements. Thus it might seem that we need more terms for</page><page sequence="10">368 HERBERT M. SCHUELLER the characterizing of works of literature and their writers. If we are to combine and classify and relate, the uniquenesses which are works of art must fall under categories which are clearly defined. To call a work romantic is to ally it with so large a class of objects that the designation is applicable only in the broadest of general senses. The greater the number of evidences of ro- manticism in a work, the better the term will apply. The fewer the evidences, the less it does so. But the usual more particular descriptions of what romanticism is are in- effective, and this is indeed because they take the part for the whole. And in the ab- sence of terms which stand for smaller sub- classes, all definitions of literary types and movements have the same inadequacy: In symbolizing the whole they do injustice to the parts of which the whole is composed.</page></plain_text>
