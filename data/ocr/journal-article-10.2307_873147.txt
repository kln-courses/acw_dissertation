<plain_text><page sequence="1">New York The Museum of Modern Art's new acqui- sitions, the subject of a special, lavish exhibition, made an astonishing display, comprising as they do the most valuable additions to the collection in any year since 1931. The bulk of these were paint- ings, drawings and pieces of sculpture, al- though other departments such as the Film 76</page><page sequence="2">CURRENT AND FORTHCOMING EXHIBITIONS Library, the Department of Architecture and Design, and the Print Collection were also handsomely enriched. Without question the most important single group in this exhibition was that of five paintings bequeathed by Mrs David Levy. These, of a fame and quality that needs little comment, were a large Degas pastel, At the Milliner's; Cezanne's solemn, late landscape Le Chdteau ]Noir, a picture that once belonged to Monet; Lautrec's La Goulue at the Moulin Rouge; Evening, Honfleur, by Seurat, first shown at the Independants in 1887 and there described by Huysmans as 'a vision of nature . . . nonchalantly at ease under wrathless skies', and, lastly, Violin and Grapes, a cubist still life by Picasso of 1912. Other contemporary paintings and sculpture surrounded these corner-stones of the School of Paris. Among them were a panoramic twenty-foot Monet mural of water-lilies never before shown anywhere; Vuillard's Family of the Artist of 1892; Sickert's La Gaietd Montparnasse, and a sur- prisingly bucolic Futurist painting, Balla's Spring, painted in 1916. Sculpture included work by Bourdelle, Matisse (Fig.37), Duchamp-Villon, Medardo Rosso (Fig.4o) and C~sar (Fig.39). Twelve drawings presented by John S. Newberry further strengthened the Mu- seum's holdings in this field. Noteworthy in this group were five Picassos including a water-colour study for Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, and a large composition, La Source, drawn in Fontainebleau in the sum- mer of i921. Finally a key surrealist item was added in the acquisition of Mir6's large drawing The Family, reproduced in Andr6 Breton's Le Surrdalisme et la Peinture (1928). Other acquisitions defy, for sheer number, individual listing. But mention might be made of a whole irridescent treasury of Tiffany glass, and the model for a large, unexecuted Convention Hall de- signed for Chicago by Mies van der Rohe. Work by two well-known, utterly con- trasted contemporary European painters has been on view recently. The Kootz Gallery showed a selection of Mathieu's paintings. These are appreciated here but it seems a pity that the artist is not per- suaded to come to this country to give one of his Paganini-like performances. It might not harm his reputation if he were asked to demonstrate that non-objective painting need not necessarily be glum in the process of coming into being. The World House Gallery's large exhi- bition of Morandi's landscapes and still lifes offered accustomed pleasure and gave one the increasing feeling that this rarified artist was not so much looking for formulas for picture-making as he was determined to wrest from subject matter some secret that it jealously guarded. Turning the clock back (or ahead?) the Isaacson Gallery showed a small group of 'Poetic Painters of the Nineteenth Century', oils, drawings, and water-colours by artists such as Alma-Tadema, Bouguereau, Ger6me, Albert Moore, Burne-Jones, Leighton, Poynter, and Max Klinger. This represented a perfectly understandable reaction to contemporary extremes in the opposite direction and taught one a num- ber of things about artists on whose work dust and neglect have gathered. For one thing, who might have suspected, as is made clear in G&amp;r6me's Shooting Party at Baron de Rothschild's, that this great pompier, early in the I88o's, took not a few hints about light and atmospheric colouring from the Impressionists? Many aspects of Dubuffet's eccentric, often endearing talent were represented in the large retrospective of his drawings at the Cordier-Warren Gallery. This ex- tremely clever artist makes few attempts to disguise his debt to Klee, or to primitive and child art. And certainly much of his popularity depends on his gifts as a paro- dist, parodying familiar subjects such as Arabs, landscape and his eternal cows so that conservative taste finds its way home by a route of which it never suspected the existence. In any event Dubuffet's capriciousness is no greater than that of pre-Columbian artists, some of whose pottery was shown at the Emmerich Gallery. The vases and other vessels here proved that this old American art could be even more anthro- pomorphic than Greek art. Hardly a piece was not fashioned in some way after human forms (see Fig.38). And in one case, where the sculptor had to represent a parrot, he was evidently unable to finish the piece without giving the bird human feet. Whether or not Franz Kupka painted the first non-objective painting, he cer- tainly, in the light of his work at the Royal Marks Gallery, carried experiments with swirling form and luminous colour to lyrical and flamboyant lengths. But for all the novelty of his art Kupka, in retrospect, looks very much an artist of his times. We can go further than merely disentangling cubist, orphist, and perhaps futurist ele- ments in his work and find it paralleling, despite obvious dissimilarities of person- ality and medium, Bakst's d6cors, Apol- linaire's poems, and even Paul Poiret clothes - all celebrating together in Paris the rites of spring on the eve of I914. A good show of Guillaumin's landscape and figure oils at the Hammer Galleries demonstrated the 'case' of the talented artist who submerges his personality in that of his more creative contemporaries. Monet was an early inspirer. But Guillau- min did not stop there. Later in life, al- though somewhat gingerly, he manages to insinuate bright, unexpected flashes of fauve colour in otherwise innocuous pic- tures. Finally, an exhibition of paintings by two contemporary German artists at the Lefebre Gallery. Both Willi Baumeister and Hans Hartung (the latter actually being of the present-day School of Paris), seek to make contact with creative forces at various subconscious levels, an effort more densely, if less 'brilliantly', carried out by Baumeister. Messrs M. R. Schweitzer have an ex- hibition throughout February of works by less well-known Impressionists and Neo- Impressionists. The following painters are represented: Guillaumin, Hippolyte Petit- jean (who is represented by a most interesting painting of a female nude beneath trees, in the style of Seurat's Poseuses), Lebourg, Maufra, Lebasque, Luce, Loiseau and Henri Le Sidaner. Prospective visitors to this country will doubtless be pleased by the welcome news that the Barnes Foundation in Philadel- phia, after operating for years as a tax-free institution while keeping its doors shut to the public, has at last been ordered to open them by the Attorney General of the State of Pennsylvania.</page><page sequence="3">37.
