<plain_text><page sequence="1">LYNN D. CHILDRESS "LES PH?NICIENS ET L'ODYSS?E": A SOURCE FOR "LESTRYGONIANS" Victor B?rard's Les Ph?niciens et VOd yss?e is one of the major sources James Joyce used during the early formative stage of Ulysses. Nevertheless, it is one of the most neglected resources for criticism, perhaps because it has not been translated into English, or perhaps because it is too obvious.1 Although most academ ics are aware of B?rard's influence on Joyce, and several critics have written about it, at least two significant points in the "Lestrygonians" episode have been overlooked. One is that the hunger motif in "Lestrygonians" quite possibly originated in B?rard's anthropomorphic translation of Homer; and the other is that the thematic connections between "Lestrygonians" and "Oxen of the Sun" can be traced to B?rard's treatment of the two episodes. The evidence for these points comes from Ulysses Notebook VIII. A.5 (JJA 12). In this notebook Joyce entered a series of notes from the various sources that he was studying in preparation for his writing of Ulysses.2 With regard to B?rard's influence on Joyce, Stuart Gilbert fills a position best described as "spiritual" father. Gilbert, in his 1930 book James Joyces "Ulysses" acknowledges his own "indebtedness to Mr. James Joyce himself, to whose assistance and encouragement this work owes whatever merit it may possess; also to M. Victor B?rard, whose Les Ph?niciens et VOdyss?e proved invaluable for the interpretation of the Homeric correspondences."3 In formulating his analysis, Gilbert made liberal, often unattributed use of B?rard's ideas, which he supported with material from the text of Ulysses.4 Although the direction of his study appears to be a correct one (and carries the authority of authorial consent), the inherent nature of the undertaking?to discuss four major themes and all the episodes in Ulysses?meant that Gilbert at best could provide only clues about the influence of B?rard on Joyce. Furthermore, 259</page><page sequence="2">what Stuart Gilbert gained by his ability to discuss Ulysses with Joyce himself must be balanced against the possibility that he lacked access to Joyce's notebooks and compositional materials. Some of the most sig nificant material with regard to B?rard's influence upon Joyce can be found in Ulysses Notebook VIII. A.5. Phillip Herring, in his 1977 book Joyces Notes and Early Drafts for "Ulysses^: Selections from the Buffalo Collec tion, provides a key to the various sourcebooks (including Les Ph?niciens et VOdyss?e) from which Joyce made his cryptic notes. The combination of Gilbert's clues and Herring's scholarly apparatus allows us to obtain an insight into B?rard's influence upon Joyce. Most of the notes for "Lestrygonians" appear on page thirteen of Ulysses Notebook VIII.A.5. (JJA 12:143), and one-third of them are compiled from the extract on the opening page of Victor B?rard's chapter on "Les Lestrygons." This extract is B?rard's translation of the beginning of the Homeric episode in which Ulysses describes his en counter with the Lestrygonians, and as such, illustrates the anthropo morphic qualities that B?rard believed were intrinsic to the Odyssey. Stuart Gilbert explains that in B?rard's theory the Ulysseid appeared, " 'to be a Phoenician periplous (logbook) transposed into Greek verse and a poetic legend according to certain very simple and typically hellenic principles: anthropomorphic personification of objects, humanization of natural forces, hellenization of the raw material.'"5 In his own words, B?rard says, "On peut dire, je crois, que toute l'invention se r?sume en un seul proc?d?: de la statique du p?riple, le po?me tira la dynamique du Nostos; il mit en actions humaines ce que le p?riple donnait en descrip tions g?ographiques." [One could say, I believe, that all the invention is summed up by a single process: from the static of the log-book, the poem took the dynamic of the Nostos; it put into human actions what the log-book gave in geographic descriptions.]6 Some, though not all, of these anthropomorphic qualities are lost in the following English translation of B?rard's opening extract from "Les Lestrygons" chapter: From there we sailed as soon as possible, the heart grieved: the morale of my men was broken by the hard work of the oar; thanks to our folly, we no longer retained the certainty of return. Six days and six nights, without stop, we sailed. The seventh day, we arrived at the high village of Lamos, T?l?pylos of Laistrygonie, where the returning shepherd yells out, and the shepherd going out responds to him. There a man who doesn't need sleep would earn two wages, by practicing the profession of cowherd and by keeping white sheep, because the paths of the night and of the day are close. We came to a famous port, encircled by a wall of abrupt stones: to the right and to the left, the projecting cliffs face one another and advance in order to form a mouth: the entrance is very narrow. All my fleet entered this hollow port and moored in a line: 260</page><page sequence="3">not the slightest swell, large or small; but all about the vessels, white calm. Myself, alone, I stayed outside and, right beside the narrows, I attached my ship to a rock. Then I climbed up on a craggy lookout where I took my bearings. Nothing was in sight: no trace of humans nor of grazing animals; only, we noticed a smoke that rose from the land. I sent several of my men to find out about it, in order to learn who were the eaters of wheat in that land. Two men, detached with a herald who preceded them, disembarked and, on a flat route, by which, from the summit of the mountains, the chariots brought wood down to the city, they encountered a girl, the large daughter of Laistrygon Antiphat?s, who came to look for water at the gates of the city, and who descended toward the spring of l'Ours [Bears] with a fast current. (II, 209) The image that B?rard creates in his translation of Homer is one where Ulysses' men enter a mouth and pass through du goulet "a narrow straight" into an empty hollow that resembles the pit of a stomach. Two men, preceded by a herald, set off sur une route plate which to native English-speakers readily suggests "on a route to the plate." If such a thought did cross Joyce's mind, we can imagine the glee he must have felt at Stuart Gilbert's perhaps unwitting use of the expression plat du jour in his discussion of the "Lestrygonians" episode. The significance of all this wordplay is that it suggests an origin for the hunger motif that Joyce uses in "Lestrygonians." In his translation, B?rard turns the geographical description into a metaphor for the human body with men as food. Retaining the idea of "men as food," Joyce perverts the concept of anthropomorphism into "trophomor phism," where non-food things acquire foodlike qualities, as a result of Bloom's excessive hunger. As Joyce explained to Frank Budgen: "Walk ing towards his lunch my hero, Leopold Bloom, thinks of his wife, and says to himself, *Molly's legs are out of plumb.' At another time of day he might have expressed the same thought without any under-thought of food."7 Examples of food people, food places, food names, food verbs, food expressions from the text of Ulysses are superabundant and have been cited in many books and articles. Bloom is obviously famished, yet starvation is not a theme that appears in the original Homeric version of the Lestrygonian encounter. It does appear, however, as the force that motivates Ulysses' crew to kill the oxen of the sun. Ulysses' experience on the Island of the Sun, in sopie sense, recipro cates his experience with the Lestrygonians. In both cjases, Ulysses finds himself in opposition to his crew. In the Lestrygonians episode, he remains outside, while the rest enter the hollow port. In the Island of the Sun episode, Ulysses orders his crew to sail past the isle, but Eurylochus rallies an opposition. In both episodes there is a period of six days followed by a seventh day when disaster occurs. In the Lestrygonians episode, the crew is at sea for six days; on the seventh day they arrive at 261</page><page sequence="4">Lamos and are subsequently beset by the huge Lestrygonians, Cyclo pian cousins, who pelt the ships with rocks and harpoon the men like fish out of the sea. On the Island of the Sun, the situation is reversed. Ulysses' men carry out the massacre; they become the eaters, rather than the eaten. For six days they feast; on the seventh day they put out to sea. As soon as they are beyond sight of land, Zeus sends a storm to destroy the crew in retribution for killing the sacred cattle. It is impossible to determine whether or not Joyce observed this reciprocal relationship between the two episodes, but some type of connection must have been suggested to him, since the notes for the two episodes appear side by side in Ulysses Notebook VIII.A.5. The "Oxen of the Sun" notes appear primarily on pages eleven and twelve (JJA 12:141-42) and are followed immediately by the "Lestrygonians" notes on page thirteen (JJA 12:143). It is likely that something in B?rard's dis cussion of "l'Ile du Soleil" suggested a return to the earlier part of the book where he had discussed the Lestrygonians. B?rard does, in fact, make several direct references to the Lestrygo nians in the "Ile du Soleil" chapter. The first one occurs toward the end of his etymological discussion of Sour-ha-koussim, "rock of gulls." He says, "La Sicile n'a pas le monopole des Syrakoussai: sur notre d?troit des Lestrygons, la c?te corse eut aussi sa Roche aux Mouettes, Syrakoussion ou Syrakossion, en face de Lais-Trugonie, la Pierre Colombi?re" (II, 381-82). [Sicily does not have a monopoly on Syrakoussai: on our strait of the Lestrygons, the Corsican coast had also its Rock of Gulls.] This tangential reference to gulls, plus the fuller discussion of Sardinia as a land of birds that appears on pages 223-24 of B?rard's chapter "Les Lestrygons," may account for Bloom's encounter with the gulls along the Liffey and the pigeons in front of parliament in the "Lestrygonians" episode of Ulysses. An examination of Ulysses Notebook VIII.A.5. re veals the dual points of origin. On page eleven, under Isle of the Sun, Joyce notes: "Sira/cusa ? Soura-ha-Kousim (2 girls) rock of gulls" (JJA 12:141), and on page thirteen, under Lestrygonia, he notes: "Ais try gonie (Cape of Pigeons)" (JJA 12:143). For B?rard, geographical and etymological similarities supply the basic methodology that allows him to connect the mythic realm of Homer to the actual islands of the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas. For Joyce, B?rard's connections open up routes that permit thematic and symbolic materials to flow from one episode to another. In a second direct reference to the Lestrygonians episode, B?rard moves as boldly into the domain of poetry as he has heretofore sailed upon the sea. This time, rather than focusing on similarities, he delin eates the different situations that Ulysses faces on the various islands, "Si la terre des Lestrygons, des Fuyards, des Sardes, voit la Fuite d'Ulysse, si 262</page><page sequence="5">?h***, 14/44***" ^ ir? /***K fiM U/yss?

[If the land of the Lestrygonians, of the Runaways, of the Sardinians, sees the Flight of Ulysses, if the land of the Sirens, of the Enchantresses, of the Binders, sees his Enchainment, here the land of the Sun, the Sicilian shore, sees his Isolation, his Abandonment.] In his analy sis, B?rard shifts the emphasis away from the specific events that occur in the original Homeric episodes and concentrates instead upon the consequences of those events. As a result, there is no mention of starva tion in B?rard's chapter on "File du Soleil"; the theme of excessive hunger, which is an essential aspect of the Homeric Island of the Sun episode, disappears from B?rard's treatment. Instead, he focuses on the fact that there is a shrine for Aphrodite on the island, where phallic worship was practiced. Thus for Joyce the killing of the oxen of the sun becomes a crime against fertility. His development of the thematic materials in "Oxen of the Sun" follows B?rard's lead, with one important exception; instead of dropping the theme of starvation he reassigns it to "Lestrygonians." One of the oddest notes that Joyce made in the Lestrygonia section of Ulysses Notebook VIII.A.5. is "sheep &amp; oxen" (JJA 12:143). Its oddness comes from the fact that B?rard does not use the word "oxen" in his opening extract (quoted earlier). B?rard speaks of the profession of cowherd and of keeping sheep. In the opening extract of the chapter "l'Ile du Soleil," however, the motif of sheep and oxen can be easily identified: When we had avoided the rocks, the terrible Charybde and Skylla, we arrived right away at the admirable island of the god, where the beautiful oxen with broad foreheads and numerous fat sheep of the Sun were. From the black vessel, being still in the offing, I heard the bellow of penned-up cattle and the bleating of sheep. (II, 365) It is quite possible that the connection between the two episodes had begun to form in Joyce's mind, and the "sheep &amp; oxen" note represents his recognition of still another idea which tied the two episodes to gether. The sheep and oxen show up together in the unforgettable slaughter-scene of the "Lestrygonians" episode of Ulysses: \ Wretched brutes there at the cattlemarket waiting for the poleaxe to split their skulls open. Moo. Poor trembling calves. Meh. Staggering bob. Bubble and squeak. Butchers* buckets wobbly lights. Give us that brisket off the hook. PIup. Rawhead and bloody bones. Flayed glasseyed sheep hung from their haunches, sheepsnouts bloodypapered snivelling nose jam on sawdust. (US.723-27) 267</page><page sequence="10">This passage resembles more closely the Homeric version of the Island of the Sun, where Ulysses' men slit the cows' throats and flay them, than anything that occurs in the "Oxen of the Sun" episode ofUlysses. While the men in the Burton restaurant eat roast beef and stew (just as the crew devours the sacred cattle), Bloom, like Ulysses, does not eat meat; he has a cheese sandwich. Yet to push the comparison beyond the literal level is not possible. The design of Ulysses is such that "Lestrygonians" portrays only the starvation and the graphic details of the slaughter; the symbolic content remains within "Oxen of the Sun." The connections between these two episodes, however, remind us once again not to view the various episodes of Ulysses in narrowly categorized ways; the assigned episodic names are simply that ?assigned. A better title for the "Lestrygonians" episode might be "Eat or be eaten. Kill! Kill!" (178.703). The second group of notes that Joyce made on page thirteen ofUlysses Notebook VIII. A.5. was drawn from B?rard's discussion of the Sardin ian tuna-slaughter on pages 226-27 of Les Ph?niciens et l'Odyss?e, volume two. AU of these notes relate to the idea of massacre or slaughter: massacre of ? enemies (Eschylus ? slaughter of Persians at Salamine) Sp ?bullfights King cries DMP whistle harpoon ? mattanza camera di morte? bridewell (JJA 12:143) B?rard explains that during the tuna slaughter the traps are set up in advance and lookouts are posted. When the fish are sighted, the look outs send out a signal, and the whole village rushes down to the "chambers of death." He equates this with Antiphates' cry which "brought the Laestrygonians running up from every side in their thou sands."8 Interestingly, two of these notes ? "whistle" and "bridewell" ? appear in "Lestrygonians" in connection with police brutality (178.421, 431). The role of Antiphates himself was reserved for Blazes Boy Ian. This connection can be directly traced to B?rard's etymological explana tion of the name Antiphates, meaning accuser, backbiter, slanderer. On page fourteen of Ulysses Notebook VIII.A.5., Joyce records the associa tion between Antiphates and Boylan: Antiphates?blasphemer accuser -curser (Blazes).9 (JJA 12:144) Stuart Gilbert, on the other hand, equated Antiphates with the abstract concept of hunger, thus giving rise to the standard symbolic interpreta 268</page><page sequence="11">tion of the Homeric parallel. In the context of the "Lestrygonians" episode, however, the Antiphates-Boylan interpretation provides a clearer, more direct Homeric parallel than Gilbert's symbolic explana tion and offers an additional explanation for Bloom's fear and avoidance ofBoylan. The final group of notes under the Lestrygonia section of Ulysses Notebook VIII.A.5. apparently does not contribute to "Lestrygonians," although it would not be surprising to find them elsewhere. As I have demonstrated by the connections between "Lestrygonians" and "Oxen of the Sun," the boundaries between episodes in Ulysses are not always well defined. Victor B?rard's Les Ph?niciens et l'Odyss?e is certainly one of the sources that contributed to Joyce's unique handling of the Homeric myth.

(New York: E.P. Dutton, 1931). 2 Joyce compiled this notebook in the first few months of 1918 after he had returned to Zurich from a brief stay in Locarno. His work on the "Lestrygo nians" episode most likely occurred six months later between August 1918 and October 25, 1918. See Phillip F.
