<plain_text><page sequence="1">Religion in the Classroom?Another Look An ingenious study suggests that students learn religious or non religious attitudes in school in many ways more influential than Bible reading. By VINCENT R. ROGERS and BRUCE BURNES MOST of us are well aware of the current controversy raging about the recent Su preme Court decision having to do with prayer and Bible-reading in the public schools. Briefly stated, our highest court ruled that the formalized recitation of school prayers or the reading of the Bible as a religious exercise con stitutes a serious breach of the principle of separa tion of church and state. Justice Brennan, in his concurring opinion in Abington School District v. Schempp (1963), argued that: The public schools are supported entirely, in most communities, by public funds?funds exacted not only from parents, nor alone from those who hold particular religious views, nor indeed from those who subscribe to any creed at all. It is implicit in the history and character of American public education that the public schools serve a uniquely public function: the training of American citizens in an atmosphere free of parochial, divisive, or separatist in fluences of any sort?an atmosphere in which children may assimilate a heritage common to all American groups and religions. This is a heritage neither theistic nor atheistic, but simply civic and patriotic. The average citizen, whether he is for or against the Bible-reading decision, assumes that this is largely the extent of religious "instruction" in the public schools. Even granting a pro-Christian emphasis in many textbooks and considerable re ligious activity during Christmas and Easter, sec tarian instruction is assumed to be quite clearly inappropriate for the American public school. Our personal observations, however, have led us to suspect that sectarian religious concepts are often taught to American children at times other than MR.

This occurs in the day by day, informal situations that so often come up in our classrooms, initiated perhaps by news events and happenings in the everyday lives of children. Our interest in this aspect of the religion in the schools problem led us to investigate the lit erature on the subject. Much to our surprise, we found very little indeed dealing with the teaching of religion in informal classroom situations. Apart from textbook analyses and some studies of re ligious practices during the holiday season, in formation simply does not exist. In order to probe this virtually unexplored area then, we decided to create a "Classroom Problems Test." The test consisted of fifteen hypothetical situations, each built around a child's question. The teacher was asked to describe how she would handle each situation // the question were to be raised in her classroom. Ten of the items were decoys, dealing with classroom cheating, teaching about the United Nations, etc. Interspersed among the decoys were five questions concerning death, the origins of life, and the concept of a supreme being. The test was administered to 133 of the 164 elementary school teachers in a suburban school district adjoining a large midwestern city. Appar ently, it fulfilled its basic purpose, i.e., it tested teachers' approaches to questions with religious overtones in a setting which was clouded enough by decoy questions so that the teacher did not know she was being tested on the teaching of religion. (It seemed to us that if it were made clear to teachers that the test concerned the teaching of religion in public schools, they would respond as they felt they ought to respond rather than the way they might respond in a typical situation. Interviews with a number of teachers following the administration of the test indicated that they were not aware that the test was con 84</page><page sequence="2">October, 1964 RELIGION IN THE CLASSROOM?ANOTHER LOOK 85 cerned primarily with religion and that they felt they would, in fact, respond in a classroom situa tion as they did on the test. Test responses were categorized as either wholly religious, wholly nonreligious, or indeterminate. For the purposes of this study, an answer was categorized as religious if it supported the exist ence of an anthropomorphic being with the use of such words as Divine Being, Creator, He, His, Supreme Being, or God, without any qualifica tions. In a sense, "religious" answers might well be defined in this study as supportive of the con cept of theism. If there was no reference to a supreme being, or if reference was made in a negative, denying sense, or if an explanation was given that appeared to be entirely science- or nature-oriented, the answer was categorized as nonreligious. If, on the other hand, a response contained more than one idea, perhaps one of a religious nature and one of a nonreligious na ture or no answer was given, the response was categorized as "indeterminate." The following are sample answers from each of the three categories for all five questions: During a lesson on the study of early man, the children are asked to answer the question of where man originated. The science book from which the lesson was taken stresses the evolution of man from lower forms of life. One child wants to know where the simplest creatures (from which the others evolved) came from. Your response might be . . . Unqualified Religious God created all things. It is not how things were created that is important but who created them. Unqualified Nonreligious We are not sure. This is one thing that scientists also wonder about and are even now trying to solve. They have found out much about the be ginnings of life and may soon have more complete answers. Indeterminate We are not quite sure where first life came from. There are many different trains of thought dealing with this subject. Some say a chemical reaction occurred. Some say that a supreme creator began the cycle of life. * * * One morning the children come to school with the knowledge that a classmate, who had been hos pitalized, has died. You and the children are grieved by the loss of this child and, during a discussion of what the class might do to help, a child wants to know why we have to die. Your response might be Unqualified Religious We are put on this earth for a purpose and when God decides to do His will in this way that is the way He does it. Unqualified Nonreligious This is part of the life cycle. Every living organ ism is confronted with this part of the cycle. Indeterminate The body we have can't live forever. The parts of the body wear out. For some people, religion helps us understand death. * * * In a discussion of Russia in social studies, one child says that Communists are no good because they don't believe in God. "They will never beat us," she says, "because God is on our side." Your re sponse might be . . . Unqualified Religious We cannot become too complacent about this be cause if God sees that we are too self-satisfied it may be His will that the Communists beat us. Unqualified Nonreligious If people are good and try to help others there will never be a war, regardless of people's beliefs. Indeterminate Every one of us believes differently. You don't believe all the things I do, and I don't believe all the things you do. If you believe in God, you may believe He will help us. But that isn't the only way to get things done. * * * During a discussion of recent successful space launchings one child wonders if God will get angry if we "keep pushing closer to heaven." Your re sponse might be . . . Unqualified Religious God gave us the power to do these things and as long as we believe in Him and love Him He will stand by us and protect us. Unqualified Nonreligious Our age is a "move ahead" age in science. We are studying about space and doing space launchings because we want to find out what we can about the environment and our surroundings. Indeterminate We do not know where heaven is, and some don't believe there is a heaven. Space is endless. * * * After realizing many of your children do not really know the Pledge of Allegiance, you decide to go go through each phrase and discuss it. During the discussion one child asks why the phrase "one na tion under God" was added to the Pledge. Your re sponse might be . . . Unqualified Religious In this country we all believe in God. This is very important, as some countries do not believe in God. Unqualified Nonreligious Congress passed a law saying it should be added. We elected the men in Congress and they usually vote the way the people who elected them want them to vote. Indeterminate We are one nation, united together. We are not entirely agreed on the "one God" idea, but we are united under a feeling of brotherhood. AT the conclusion of the test the teachers were -** asked to indicate their religious affiliation. They were also asked whether or not they favored the Supreme Court's Bible-reading decision.</page><page sequence="3">86 PHI DELTA KAPPAN October, 1964 The results of the study indicate that over 52 per cent of the responses to our test questions can properly be categorized as unqualified religious answers. Further, religious answers were stated overwhelmingly in terms of an orthodox, Christian theology. The Court's Bible-reading decision was opposed by 32 per cent of the teachers. Fifty-three per cent favored the decision and 14 per cent were un decided. Our data indicate, however, that there is no relationship between religious affiliation and opposition to the Supreme Court verdict. There was divided opinion among members of all of the major religious groups represented in our sample. Neither could we find any significant relation ship between religious affiliation and the degree of "religiousness" of answers on the "Classroom Problems Test." Apparently, some members of a given denomination were quite willing to present a more balanced or qualified view in the class room while other members of the same church did not hesitate to answer children's questions in terms of their own religious beliefs without any qualification. There was a significant relationship, however, between opposition to the Supreme Court's de cision and religious answers on the "Classroom Problems Test." Apparently, those who did an swer test questions in unqualified religious terms tended to oppose the court's decision regardless of their formal religious affiliation. While it would undoubtedly be dangerous to generalize beyond the population included in this investigation, it seems apparent that religion is "taught" in many ways to some public school children. Bible readings at the start of the school day, baccalaureate services, grace before lunch, and seeking the blessings of God at ceremonies and athletic events represent only one aspect of of the problem. Representative Frank Becker of New York, who proposed the Constitutional amendment that would, in effect, override the Bible-reading de cision, has expressed great concern over the re ligious beliefs of our children. Testifying before the House Judiciary Committee, Representative Becker warned his colleagues that "millions of families do not subscribe to any religion." "The children of such families," said Becker, "are not aware of the existence of God. As part of their education for life, the schools must make them aware." Our data would indicate that many teachers are doing just that in a variety of teaching situa tions that have nothing whatever to do with formal religious exercises. Many of the responses recorded in this study seem to us to be clearly inappropriate in public schools. On the other hand, one wonders precisely at what point (if at all) discussions such as these constitute an "establishment of religion." Is the answering of a child's question in religious terms by a single teacher a threat to Constitutional guarantees? By ten teachers? By half of the teachers in a given school district? One wonders further whether or not either the nonreligious or indeterminate answers were any more appropriate. Do teachers who answer in purely nonreligious terms destroy or undermine the religious beliefs of some of their children? Are there "balanced" answers that would be more acceptable in public schools? If we accept Justice Brennan's reasoning in Abington School District v. Schempp, i.e., the public schools should help children assimilate a heritage "neither theistic nor atheistic but simply civic and patriotic," there is obviously much work to be done. Teachers, administrators, and those engaged in teacher education will need to give considerable time, energy, and thought to the educational implications of the separation prin ciple as interpreted above. On the other hand, the Supreme Court as a whole could serve a most useful purpose by further clarifying its position as soon as an opportunity arises to do so. A strong endorsement of the U.S. Supreme Court rulings banning prayer and Bible readings from school classrooms and opposing Congressional attempts to overthrow the court decisions has been issued by the American Association of School Ad ministrators, titled Religion in the Public Schools. In effect, the AASA says the nation's schools should be committed to teaching the Bill of Rights, not fostering religious practices. Some AASA recommendations: Christmas?"The policy that encourages reasonable recognition of Christmas in the schools in the spirit of exposition of the differing rites and customs of families, cul ture, and creeds." School Calendar and Religious Holidays?"The policies under which school cal endars are established be such as to guarantee to the maximum the possibility of appropriate religious observances by all children and staff members, while providing at least the legal requirement for number of full days." Baccalaureate?"For religious groups represented by students in the graduating class to conduct baccalaureate services in their own churches and synagogues." Staff Composition?"An effective staff is one which is at least as diverse in its religious background as are the children in the schools. It could be argued that the diversity should be greater, in order to open the eyes and extend the horizons of the children."</page></plain_text>
