<plain_text><page sequence="1">FOLKLORE - VOLUME 71- SEPTEMBER 1960 Snake and Dragon Lore of Japan by F. J. DANIELS THE viper is the only poisonous snake native to Japan proper, ex- cluding, that is to say, the RytkyU islands to the south. In the northern island of Hokkaid6 this is of the same species as the European adder, but Hokkaid6 hardly concerns us, because it was colonized too recently to have much traditional lore of its own. The Japanese viper elsewhere, though of a different species, is about equally noxious to man, its bite being painful though seldom fatal. The commonest snake in most places is the grass-snake, and there are two others of the same family, called, if we translate the Japanese, striped snakes and crow-snakes - crow-snakes because they are black. There are also two other varieties of natrix snake. The RyfkyU islands belong with Japan linguistically, and they largely share in a common tradition of snake and dragon lore. Here are found the highly poisonous, triangular-headed snakes called habu. There are also vipers of the same species as in the main Japanese islands. Of non-poisonous snakes, there are grass-snakes, speckled snakes, and crow-snakes, though what are called crow- snakes here are of a different species from those bearing the same name in Japan proper. There is nowhere in the area - outside of zoos - any python type of snake. I say this because it is fairly widely known that in Japanese myth an eight-headed and eight-tailed serpent devoured a maiden every year until the god Susanoo slew it and married the last of its destined victims, and it may sometimes, I think, have been assumed from this that Japan has, or had, some very large snakes. Actually, except for the Ryakyo habu, the general picture as regards types and sizes of snakes is not very different from that in England, Scotland, and Wales, though I imagine that there are many more snakes in Japan than here, both absolutely and in pro- portion to the land area. L 145</page><page sequence="2">SNAKE AND DRAGON LORE OF JAPAN Here I had better say briefly what I have been doing and what sort of material is available for the study of Japanese snake and dragon lore. I began collecting and analysing this lore about five years ago, and in I957-58 I spent just over a year on study leave in Japan, giving most of the time to this work. My information comes chiefly from published sources, though I have been able to add a few items gathered from informants or by personal observation. Japanese literature goes back to the eighth century, and the earliest work in the language contains myths which are relevant to our subject. From then on and in ever increasing volume relevant material appears in such things as collections of tales, topographical works, lives of saints, histories of shrines and temples, travel diaries - in fact in literature of almost every kind. Then, in recent times there has been a flourishing folklore movement in Japan, the central figure in which has for long been Mr Yanagita-Kunio. Although Mr Yanagita, chiefly on account of his age, closed down his Folk- lore Institute in 1956 or 1957, much material continues to be pub- lished, and there is at present quite a boom in the publication of folktales. There are a number of scholars engaged in studying folk- tales, and also a number studying popular religious cults. New work is constantly appearing on the ancient myths and similar subjects. In short, there is so much relevant material that if I had known as much about its bulk and complexity as I do now I should probably have been frightened off the subject altogether. I must briefly mention two scholars who have made a compre- hensive study of Japanese snake and dragon lore. The earliest was a Dutchman, M. W. de Visser, author of a standard work on early Japanese Buddhism. He wrote two long articles in English, 'The snake in Japanese superstition' (in volume xiv (1911) of the Mitteilungen des Seminars fiir Orientalische Sprachen an der Kdnig- lichen Friedrich-Wilhelms Universitdit zu Berlin) and 'The dragon in China and Japan' (in volume 13 II (1913) of the Verhandelingen der Koninklijke Akademie van Wetenschappen te Amsterdam, Afdeeling Letterkunde, Nieuwe Reeks). The other was a Japanese, Minakata- Kumagusu, a man of encyclopedic learning whose speciality was mycology. He, too, wrote two long articles, one in 1916 on dragons, and one in 1929 on snakes; these are in Japanese, and he does not seem to have known of de Visser's work. Neither writer knew much about local religious cults, and, writing when they did, they had 146</page><page sequence="3">SNAKE AND DRAGON LORE OF JAPAN comparatively few collections of local legends and folktales to draw on - Minakata was not very interested in these anyway. However, they both supply very useful references, and Minakata gives some information not to be found elsewhere. De Visser gives much from Buddhist sources. Having worked over most of de Visser's material, I can vouch for the generally high standard of accuracy of his translations and summaries. I am inclined to disagree with him only regarding the assumption which he appears to make that when anything similar is found in both China and Japan it must have been borrowed by Japan from China in historical times. This has often happened, but sometimes it may be that both countries have drawn from a common source. There have been more recently many articles in Japanese on certain aspects of our subject. Of other work in English, I may perhaps mention that last year there was published in the Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan (third series, vol. VII) a talk which I had given under the title 'Straw snakes'. There are also relevant articles in the Hastings Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics. That, I think, exhausts the work in English dealing specifically with Japanese snake or dragon lore. But relevant material is to be found in various translations from Japanese literature and notably in the two great sources of myths, 'Ko-ji-ki' or 'Records of ancient matters' translated by B. H. Chamberlain and Nihongi translated by W. G. Aston. Especially as de Visser's articles deal to a large extent with ideas and beliefs, I will try to approach the subject from a behavioural point of view and describe what the Japanese, or some of them, have done or said to snakes or dragons, rather than what they have said about them. This is no more than a rough and ready device for selecting and ordering some of the data. Ideas and beliefs will not be entirely left out, and we shall find ourselves considering be- haviour, by word and deed, towards fictional and fabricated snakes as well as towards factual ones. First a word or two about the economic exploitation of actual zoological snakes, though I must confess that I have made no real study of this aspect, and my information about it is scrappy. Snake flesh has probably always been eaten to a limited extent by a few people in limited areas, but when such cases are reported they always seem to be regarded as something unusual. Taboos would no doubt have prevented the killing of some snakes in some places. '47</page><page sequence="4">SNAKE AND DRAGON LORE OF JAPAN On the other hand, famines would almost certainly have led to some sporadic eating of snake flesh. There was a restaurant in Tokya when I was last there specializing in this food and enjoying the vogue of a bizarre novelty. It was suggested to me that this grew out of experiments made during the food shortage of the war and post-war years. I think it is true to say that nowhere in Japan has snake flesh been an important article of diet in normal times, and certainly not among the educated or ruling classes. This may not apply to sea-snakes; I believe that a variety of sea-snake, the so-called Erabu eel, often goes into the popular fish sausage, or kamaboko, but this fact, if it is a fact, is unknown to most of those who eat it. This variety of sea-snake is eaten in the Ryikyts, where habu flesh is also cooked and eaten, though to what extent I do not know. Viper flesh is however eaten for medical purposes. It is reported from CHIBA' that viper flesh is good for you, and at Futami in MIE I saw a snake butcher's. The shop had a notice outside offering to buy vipers, and the proprietor was good enough to show me his stock-in-trade, strips of the dried flesh and a cage full of very small and miserable-looking vipers waiting their turn. He sold the flesh as a remedy for tuberculosis. He would also take orders for viper eyeballs, which were good for weak eyesight, but the demand was small. The most widespread medical use of viper is pickling it in rice-wine or crude spirit. The snake itself is not eaten, but the liquor is drunk. Just what this is good for varies. Most often it seems to be a general tonic. An advertisement for it which I saw in a Ky6to shop window reads, literally translated: SINO-JAPANESE DISTINGUISHED MEDICINE PRESCRIPTION ESSENTIAL CONSTITUENT OF VIPER Pulmonary consumption The pleura The heart Nervous debility Diseases of the stomach and intestines Sterility Impotence Defective capacity 1 This and other names all in capitals are those of ken, or prefectures, or of fu, or urban districts. 148</page><page sequence="5">SNAKE AND DRAGON LORE OF JAPAN Bodily weakness Before and after childbirth. It is reported from CHIBA that it is there held, more modestly, to be good for cuts and for pains in the belly. According to the Honz6- k6moku-keimnz, an eighteenth-century medical work, it should be made by placing a live viper in approximately 4 gallons of good rice-wine, closing the lid of the vessel, and burying it where a horse has made water; when opened after a year the liquid will have shrunk to about 3 pints, its flavour will have improved, and the viper will have disappeared. This liquor cured leprosy. The present- day shop stuff with a very visible viper in a glass container may have substituted 'good packaging' for thoroughness in the manufactur- ing process. Trade, it seems, is not what it was, and I was told that only one shop selling this and comparable remedies remains in T5ky6. Some use was evidently once made of viper fat or oil; this ap- pears from a story in the twelfth century Konjaku-monogatari, but I do not know what the use was. In various local legends one reads of professional snake-catchers. I suppose these to have been men who made a living by catching snakes for sale, probably for medical use, rather than pest-control experts, but I am not sure. In general I think it is true to say that land snakes at least have never been more than a very minor economic asset. It is natural to wish to avoid being bitten by a poisonous snake, and some of the precautions recommended may have a factual basis. It seems to be widely believed that to have one's canvas foot- wear or short gaiters dyed with indigo keeps vipers away. We may doubt whether, as is sometimes said, it is the colour which they dislike, but I was told by someone who works for a forestry com- pany that it is really the smell, which at least sounds more plausible. It is reported from KANAGAWA that snakes dislike the smell of hinoki, the Japanese cypress, and that for this reason, when going to sleep in a hill forest, one should cover one's face with a coolie- hat made of this wood and should also use it for building a privy. This second use may have reference not only to the danger of snake-bite but to a widespread belief that snakes seek to enter the orifices of the human body, especially the private parts of women. In a legend about a swamp or mere in YAMAGATA, chestnut wood is said to be obnoxious to snakes, but the context hardly guarantees 149</page><page sequence="6">SNAKE AND DRAGON LORE OF JAPAN the factual accuracy of the statement. The story is that a basket- maker's wife, while washing rice in this piece of water, was 'in- looked', or magically attracted, into it by its snake Warden, or master. Her husband was so enraged that he drove in chestnut stakes at the water's edge, causing the snake to change into an ox's head, rise into the air, and disappear, while the water dried up suddenly, just as it is given to doing today. There are various spells for keeping oneself safe from snakes, usually from vipers in Japan itself and from habu in the Ryfikyiis. The most widely distributed motif in those which I have gathered so far is a threat to report any snake which gets in one's way to some being of the mountains, perhaps a mountain deity. This is Yama- nashi-hime or Yamatachi-hime (Taky6 neighbourhood, collected in nineteenth or possibly eighteenth century), mi-yama no oku no hime (KY6TO, twentieth century), or yamabe no aruji (Rytikya, twoentieth century). Yamanashi can either be a place-name or mean 'mountain pear', and hime is 'damsel' or 'princess'; Yamatachi is not clear, though 'yama' means 'mountain'; the KY6TO phrase means 'damsel of the mountain depths' and the Ryiikyi one, 'master of the mountainous regions'. It looks as though these may all have a common origin. A spell from IWATE runs, in translation: If there's a snake there, Rustle-rustle; The carpenter's metal fire-rods - Having heated them red, I'll strike, I'll strike. One from KANAGAWA is: Snakes and centipedes, begone, away! The blacksmith's Mr Son-in-law am I; Spear and sword, I warn you, I have both. And from a place in the Ryakyas comes: Ho! bright streaks, speckle-speckle! Are you the child of a father and mother ? I am the child of a centipede. If in the way I'm going You are creeping, With green moss I'll beat you to death. Out of my way! Out of my way! 150</page><page sequence="7">SNAKE AND DRAGON LORE OF JAPAN I have a slight doubt whether 'green moss' is the right rendering in the last spell, but I have followed the collector's translation into standard Japanese of the dialect original. Two other spells, one from NIIGATA and one from IWATE, remind the snake of its obliga- tion to the bracken. A story from IWATE explains how the obliga- tion was incurred. A snake took a nap in a field planted with a kind of rush such as is used for thatching; a spike of this shot up through the snake's body so that it could move neither forward nor back, but then a frond of bracken grew up and lifted the snake off the spike. Presumably reminding the snake of this kindness puts it into a gentle frame of mind. The NIIGATA spell, by the way, is for use when chased by a snake on a road, so there is some doubt whether in this case the snake belongs to fact or to fiction. Amulets effective against snakes are issued at a number of shrines, but providing oneself with an amulet is only in a round- about way behaviour towards snakes and so hardly relevant to our present theme. A shrine in the Ky6to district once a year distri- butes small rice-cakes, eating one of which will keep you safe from snake-bite through the coming twelve months; and these rice- cakes have the further virtue that if you take one to a viper it becomes unable to move. The same immobilizing effect on vipers is claimed for amulets issued from a place in WAKAYAMA. Under behaviour towards snakes we may perhaps include acts which one may not do to them. A widespread tabooed action is to point at one with a finger; if you do, the finger will go bad. It is likely that fingers seldom do go bad from this cause because, if you have thoughtlessly pointed with a finger, there are usually simple ways of evading the penalty. The commonest is to spit on the finger. Other methods are: to bite the finger (KY6TO and YAMA- GUCHI), get somebody else to pretend to cut the finger off (KANA- GAWA and KY6TO), tread on it with your heel (KY6TO), and stamp on the ground as many times as the number of calendar years in which you have lived (CHIBA). There are similar prohibitions against showing the length or girth of a snake (sometimes only of a dead snake) by using hands or fingers, with generally the same penalty of hands or fingers going bad unless evasive action is taken. The ban on pointing applies in KY6TO to pointing at a grave- stone and in YAMAGUCHI to pointing at a funeral, as well as at a snake. '51</page><page sequence="8">SNAKE AND DRAGON LORE OF JAPAN There seems to be a fairly general belief that killing a snake may bring a curse on the killer, though this may not apply to vipers except under special conditions. In some parts of Japan vipers are usually excluded from the category of snakes, and this makes some of the evidence difficult to interpret. In CHIBA to kill a snake with an edged instrument entails a curse. In the Ryfkyis one should not cut off a snake's head with an edged instrument, or the severed head will jump at you; this could be a vivid phrasing of a common- sense warning, since a snake's head can still bite after severance from the body. On the evening after killing a habu one must do no work of any kind. To wound a snake without killing it may be more dangerous than killing it outright, and not only for the obvious reason. So in CHIBA to half kill a snake entails a curse, and in AICHI if you hit one which has its head reared up you must seek and kill it, otherwise it will turn into one of the malignant things known as mallet snakes, to which I will return later. In IWATE the head of a snake accidentally severed while cropping herbage will take mallet-snake form. There are snakes which are protected by an absolute taboo from any molestation. These are normally grass- snakes, but it is, usually at any rate, not the species as such, but a particular snake or group of snakes in a particular habitat which has this protection. In the Rynkyis there seems to be a ban on killing grass-snakes as such, but the terms in which this is reported do not suggest that it is based on any strong emotional or magico- religious sanction, as is often the case with the ban, where it occurs, in Japan itself. To kill a pair of Ihabu which are copulating, however, is to invite instant death; even to watch this act brings bad luck, and people who come across a pair in this predicament take off an article of clothing and cover them with it. Dead snakes may still be dangerous. In OITA, if you tread on the bones of a dead snake, your own bones will go bad. In the Ryikyis, if you poke about at, or tread on, a dead speckled snake, its teeth will stick in your foot. After killing a habu, you must not bury it where there is any vegetation, or a plant will grow up of an evil nature which causes inflammation of the foot; so you choose a bare path through an arable field for the burial. Where the killing of a snake entails a curse, this may sometimes be averted or diverted. In CHIBA the curse may be avoided either by putting incense in the dead snake's mouth or by burning the carcass. To avoid the 152</page><page sequence="9">SNAKE AND DRAGON LORE OF JAPAN vengeance of the mallet snake formed when a snake's head is cut off, one may say in IWATE, 'It wasn't due to me; it was due to the sickle'; then after three years when it seeks revenge it will bite not you but your sickle, with fatal result to itself. Snakes after death may, however, do good to man, and not only pharmaceutically. Mina- kata says that in his boyhood toothache could be cured in MIE and WAKAYAMA by carefully burying a dead snake, offering incense, and visiting the grave daily; he believes, but is not quite certain, that the dead snake was first rubbed on the bad tooth. Somewhat similarly, in OITA if you bury a dead snake it will cure toothache or belly-ache for you. Should you wish to restore a recently dead snake to life, you can do this in MIYAZAKI by scattering the dung and urine of a horse on it. Horse dung can apparently infuriate some living snakes. A story from SHIZUOKA tells of an acolyte at a temple who was warned by the priest never to throw horse dung at a crow-snake; when he did this in a spirit of mischief, the snake chased him back to the temple, where the priest hid him, but though the snake crashed into the stone steps leading up into the temple with such force that it died, it somehow managed to reach the hidden boy and strangle him. From a place in CHIBA comes a very specific prohibition: not to throw the dung of a white horse onto a striped snake, or it will come flying after you. I have no idea why snakes should be thought to react in these ways to horse dung or urine. At a place in AICHI it is said that a crow-snake will chase you if you throw a horse's hoof-cover at it, especially that of a grey horse, and at a place in WAKAYAMA that a snake (species not stated) will do so if you throw footgear at it. There is a possible link in the similarity of sound between kuso 'dung' and kutsu 'footgear' or 'hoof-cover'. With the taboo on the molestation of certain snakes we approach the field of religion, but before dealing with snake-form deities let me say something more about mallet snakes. It is all but certain that these creatures, variously described as having their heads at right angles to their bodies, or as being like the head of a mallet without the handle, owe their peculiarities of form to verbal mis- understanding. There is mention in the eighth-century myth redactions of a deity, apparently a goddess, one of whose names was Nozuchi. This was a deity of moors or lower mountain slopes. No means 'moor', and zuchi or its variant tsuchi, of uncertain sig- '53</page><page sequence="10">SNAKE AND DRAGON LORE OF JAPAN nificance, is found in a number of other deity names. Tsuchi, is, however, a homonym of the word for mallet, which would become zuchi as the second element in a compound, and Nozuchi ap- parently came to be interpreted as 'moor mallet' when the deity was no longer worshipped in the old way. The creation of mon- strosities on a similar verbal basis seems to have continued. Grouped with mallet snakes, nozuchi or tsuchi-hebi (hebi= 'snake'), there are also tsuto or tsutokko. Now, it seems likely that tsuto was originally a corruption or perhaps a dialect variant of tsuchi, but there is a word tsuto designating the straw container used for wrapping up small gifts, somewhat resembling in shape a flattened Christmas cracker; and accordingly we hear of snakes with the same grim qualities as nozuchi or tsuchi-hebi but having this flat- tened-Christmas-cracker form. Tsutokko is no doubt tsuto plus ko, an almost meaningless suffix to nouns, common in the north- eastern dialects. Now, when I was last in Japan, a T6kya man told my wife that during the Pacific war, while he was in the army and stationed outside Nagoya in AICHI, a comrade who had gone to drink at a spring had seen there an extraordinarily short and fat snake, and had immediately afterwards been taken ill. The local people said it must have been a tokkuri-hebi. A tokkuri is the bulbous flask in which rice-wine is warmed. I suspect that tokkuri was suggested by tsutokko, giving rise to yet another abnormal form. The frequency with which seeing a monstrosity is said to have brought on a fever makes one suspect that the viewer may already have been in the heightened emotional state which often accom- panies the onset of influenza. While the actual form which these monstrosities take is no doubt determined by preconception, their common emotional basis is fear. Mallet snakes and similar things are sometimes said to have a bite which is always fatal, and sometimes to have poisonous breath; sometimes, as we have seen, the mere sight of them brings on illness. In the same category are the uwabami, whose monstrosity consists not in a deformity but in their huge size, for they can swallow men. These various monsters, though uncanny, are scarcely deities, for they are not worshipped, but it seems likely that they are the descendants of deities, or the residuary legatees of fears formerly focussed on deities. Behaviour towards them, apart 154</page><page sequence="11">SNAKE AND DRAGON LORE OF JAPAN from that prompted by encountering them, is mainly negative - keeping out of their way. When that is impossible, there may still be some way of minimizing the danger. Thus in a work of round about 1800oo it is said of some ponds in the foothills of Mount Kiri- shima in KAGOSHIMA that, because each was inhabited by an uwabami, they were as far as possible avoided by woodcutters, who, if they had to pass near, kept silence, because 'It is said that if it hears the sound of human voices the great serpent always appears and swallows the people'. We must turn now to snakes as deities or the representatives of deities. Being a deity implies that there are acts of worship. Most often a deity has a shrine at which the acts of worship are per- formed. Shrines are of very various sizes and degrees of importance. They range from great establishments with a staff of resident priests, musicians, and dancers, often controlling a number of branch shrines, down through others such as village shrines with perhaps one part-time priest, to tiny erections in fields or clumps of trees, or at lonely spots by pieces of water or away in the mountains. It is clear from the eighth-century redactions of the myths that many of the ancient deities had a snake form. These deities often had associations with water, with mountains, with trees, with thunder, and with rice-wine. Most at least seem to have been the deities of the agricultural people who had settled most of the country before the last wave or waves of immigrants came in round about the beginning of the Christian era. These last-comers, of north-Asian origin, included the clan which by the third or fourth century had brought under its domain all but the north-east where the Ainu lived and perhaps some other smaller areas. The agricul- tural people had probably come from what is now the south of China before that was Chinese. In the eighth-century Kojiki and Nihongi, myths belonging to both these peoples, and possibly others, are woven together to make a pseudo-history. Perhaps the most striking example of the uninterrupted worship of a snake-form deity is to be seen at the shrine of Omononushi at Mount Miwa in NARA. From what is said in the myths there is little doubt that the normal form of this deity was that of a snake. Although he took human form to beget children on women, he is not otherwise anthropomorphic. He was the god of the hill, Mount 155</page><page sequence="12">SNAKE AND DRAGON LORE OF JAPAN Miwa, which was no doubt sacred inasmuch as he dwelt there, but the present-day theory which makes the hill itself the object of worship is almost certainly a later development. The shrine of this deity, now at the foot of Mount Miwa, is large and flourishing. It includes a Hall of Worship but not, as at most Shint6 shrines, a separate building to house the 'deity form', or object of worship. This is officially the hill itself. But, now, a little way off to the right as one faces the Hall of Worship is a large cryptomeria tree, marked as sacred or taboo by the special rope hung round it. The tree is railed round and provided with a stand for food offerings, normally of cooked rice or of raw eggs. And these offerings are said to be accepted and eaten - mostly at night - by a grass-snake which lives in a hole in the trunk of the tree. When I was there in Novem- ber 1957 a group of four women and three youths were on their knees bowing in worship to the occupant of the tree. While we - that is, the Chief Priest of the shrine, a Japanese professor of archaeology, and myself - were at the place, they changed position and offered worship towards the hill itself. Whether they would have changed position if the Chief Priest had not appeared, I have no means of knowing. Although the Chief Priest spoke slightingly of this cult of the local people, he acknowledged that to them it was the snake which was the 'deity form'. A word of caution is neces- sary, however, before concluding that this has always been so. Although there can be no reasonable doubt that from ancient times the deity of this hill has been thought of as having snake form, it is not certain that the worship was originally directed towards a living snake. The shrine is in an area where large snake forms are made out of straw, and something of that sort rather than a living animal may have been the older object of worship. Most of the worship of snake deities takes place at small and inconspicuous shrines which, even if locally important, are not nationally famous like that at Mount Miwa. Ancient shrines with a nation-wide reputation, even when the deity worshipped there can be shown by the myths or from other evidence to have had a snake form, have usually got rid of overt snake-worship or pushed it into the background. Snake-deity shrines which are locally im- portant are often so because the deity is a weather-controller, and rites are performed there to obtain rain in times of drought. Most commonly these rain-givers are thought of as great serpents living 156</page><page sequence="13">SNAKE AND DRAGON LORE OF JAPAN in pieces of water. Frequently they are referred to as Wardens of their ponds or meres or deep river-pools.2 The worship of living snakes may be more common in towns than in the country. In towns they are likely to be prayed to for pros- perity and good luck. I was told of three small shrines in the city of Ky~to, all at the foot of willow-trees in which a snake is supposed to be living. When I lived at Zushi in KANAGAWA just before the last war, the man next door, a carpenter, had a small private shrine in his garden. Its history, related by his wife to my wife, was that he had found a small white snake and, thinking it would bring him luck, had put it in a bottle and buried it, building the little shrine over the place of burial. Whether the snake was alive or dead when put in the bottle, and whether it was able to get out if it was alive, I never discovered. This, I think, was an exceptional case. Some of the deities living in water or on hills are called dragons. Usually this appears to be a fairly recent development.3 Two names in particular are used, Ryujin and Hachidai-ryfi5. Ryzijin, 'dragon god', is primarily the ruler of the sea, Chinese in origin, a majestic figure living in his splendid under-water Rygia of 'Dragon Palace', together with his beautiful daughter, the Younger Princess. But, partly because of the normal lack of distinction between singular and plural in both Chinese and Japanese, Ry-jin, or a ryfjin, may be found inhabiting not only various particular spots in the ocean, but also inland pieces of water. Often when Ryujin is said to inhabit an inland piece of water another tradition speaks only of a great serpent. Usually nothing much has been altered by the change of name. Hachidai-ryi17, however, is more complicated. The name, literally interpreted, means 'Eight great dragon kings'. 2 Not quite all Wardens of pieces of water are great serpents. Sometimes they are 'monsters', with or without a description of what they have looked like to people who have seen them at different times. They are sometimes fish, including giant eels. There are traces of an ox form, though I do not think I have found a definite statement that a Warden is an ox. Occasionally smaller animals or even insects are said to be Wardens, but, this probably occurs only in folktales which do not pretend to be serious legends. 3 Whether there were dragons in Japan before the contact with China in more or less historical times is a meaningless question unless 'dragon' is defined and probably unanswerable on any definition. The fact that the native word 'tatsu' has been equated with the Chinese word for dragon by writing it with the same Chinese character can hardly be held to prove that the form of a tats was originally identical with that of a Chinese dragon, when we see that this same character was used to render 'ndga', a form based on the cobra. So with the old words 'okami' and 'mizuchi': it is unsafe to deduce their forms from the Chinese characters allotted to them. '57</page><page sequence="14">SNAKE AND DRAGON LORE OF JAPAN They are in origin eight ndga kings or rajahs who in Mahayana Buddhism are said to have become followers of the Buddha. The form of a niga was that of a cobra, but the Chinese translated the word by their word for 'dragon', and to the Japanese, who use the Chinese translations of the Buddhist scriptures, the form of these Buddhist 'dragons' is like that of other Chinese dragons and quite unrelated to the hooded cobra. Although anyone learned in Buddhism would know that there are eight of these dragons, popularly the name 'Hachidai-ryuld' seems usually to be thought of as that of a single divinity, the 'Eight-great dragon-king'. Now, where Hachidai-ryz'i has taken the place, under Buddhist influence, of a native great serpent, there has usually, I think, been a change in attitude. He is looked on as being not only more powerful than the older deity but also more benevolent. In some places worship is offered to great-serpent deities of water directly and not at a shrine, which may not even exist. Offer- ings of food, or of rice-wine, or of women's toilet articles, may be floated on the water or thrown into it. It seems to be only in two considerable areas (SHIGA-NARA- WAKAYAMA-OSAKA and SHIMANE) and at scattered places elsewhere that large snakes are made out of straw. If you read my article on straw snakes, you will see that only a minority of these are clearly worshipped. In other places they are regarded rather as offerings to a deity, though it is extremely probable that this deity once had snake form. In some places they are finally thrown away; it may be that the deity, regarded as harmful, is thus shown to have been coerced into submission. The religious significance of ceremonies in which straw snakes are used has in some places almost lapsed. Some ceremonies of this sort may have been influenced by the purely Chinese dragon pagaentry at Nagasaki, where a huge paper dragon is paraded through the streets. For example, for the Serpent Festival at the city of Mamada in TOCHIGI five or six 'serpents' are made, one by each ward, but these have a very 'dragony' appear- ance, with branching wooden horns. They are made basically of bamboo, then wrapped round with straw, etc., and finally covered with leaves and small branches of wistaria. The heads are elabor- ately made with coloured paper over a framework, shells being added for the eyes. The teeth are the colour of gold. I owe these particulars and the photograph to my colleague, Dr P. G. O'Neill, 158</page><page sequence="15">SNAKE AND DRAGON LORE OF JAPAN who witnessed the ceremony on 15 May 1959. There is a religious element here, since the serpents are taken to the Hachiman shrine, where a priest performs a purification ceremony over them. The boys then take them from house to house, receiving small gifts of money. Finally the serpents are thrown into a river just outside the town. An unusual annual ceremony is reported from a small village in HYOGO. Here a conger-eel is made to enact the part of a great serpent. The order of events more or less corresponds to that in the slaying of the serpent by the god Susanoo, except that there is no maiden and a small boy is spoken of as a human sacrifice. The mummery takes place inside the house of a family whose eldest son has in the year in question reached puberty. As the ceremony was enacted in 1954, a large conger was obtained and kept in the fish- monger's refrigerator till the morning of the day. Then at the house it was gutted and stuffed with straw. It was laid out with a red-pepper in its mouth to represent a tongue and, when the ceremony began in the afternoon, it was given rice-wine to drink. This was supposed to be poisoned. When it was considered that the poison had taken effect, it was seized by one of the participants and taken into the guest-room where all the people were assembled. It was made to writhe about as if in agony. At one stage it was brought face to face with a small boy, the human sacrifice. At last it was handed over to the 'conger-cutter' (perhaps the eldest son of the house), standing kitchen chopper in hand before a huge chopping-board. First the head was cut off; then the body was cut into sections which were distributed to those present, each section on an amulet. (These are not described.) Then the company went in a body to worship at the local shrine. Afterwards there was a feast, at which all the dishes were flavoured with smartweed. Here I must end this very inadequate account of Japanese be- haviour towards snakes and forms based on them. But I should like to add a plea. I wish very much that some member or potential member of this Society would undertake a survey of the snake and dragon lore of the British Isles. Apart from its own interest and value, I suggest that comparison with the Japanese material might be revealing. Much of this lore surely came from the Ancient East and spread with a knowledge of the technique of agriculture. It may not be too daring to suggest that at the two extremities of the '59</page><page sequence="16">SNAKE AND DRAGON LORE OF JAPAN Eurasian continent there may have been preserved elements of very ancient cult practices, perhaps more primitive than those which are known from literary sources to have obtained in 'the cradle of civilization'. Suggestive differences as well as similarities might be brought out. In Japan, for instance, snakes or dragons in some places lend household utensils, usually of a superior quality, suitable to set before important guests when they arrive unexpectedly - or, to tell the sad truth, this most convenient arrangement has every- where lapsed, because some borrower failed to return the utensils at the right time perhaps, or broke one. The similar service which used to be offered at some places in England was, I believe, run by the fairies. Did they, by any chance, take over the business from earlier serpent operators? The antipathy of Japanese snakes and dragons to iron is another characteristic they share with our fairies. I will add two possible parallels as examples of the sort of thing which a thorough comparison might discover, though they are only, as it were, on the fringe of snake and dragon lore. The first seems striking. The second will probably be thought very far-fetched. The first concerns the fish in a lake in Wales. I rely on the authors, H. R. C. Carr and G. A. Lester, of The Mountains of Snow- donia for the statement that Giraldus Cambrensis reported that this lake contained 'three sorts of fish, eels, trout, and perch, all of which have only one eye, the left being wanting'. Now, at a place in YAMAGATA there are many meres. One, which has a goddess for its Warden, is so beautiful that the Warden of another mere kept trying to seize it. The goddess, feeling herself unequal to con- tinuing the fight, went in woman's form to a redoutable hunter and asked him to fight for her. He agreed and lay in wait in the shade of a pine-tree among the reeds; when the monster approached - at night, as was its custom - he shot a humming arrow, which struck one of its eyes, so that it fled to a third mere where it washed its wounded eye. Therefore the water of that mere turned red, and the carp in it, presumably affected by the poison, became one-eyed, as they still are. Again, at a place in SHIZUOKA there is a large pond in which many of the carp have their left eye smaller than the right - as if it had been squashed. The people of the neighbouring village tell of a fearsome thing living in the pond, variously described as a monster with gaping jaws or a huge catfish, and on one day a year I6o</page><page sequence="17">PLATE III Air 7,ji ix ::;K .-.'.: ? .'-:. . . . . . . ..:: ::::::. .. . . .....

It is another place, some miles away, which supplies what is presumably the 'reason' for the squashed-eye carp. In a pond at this place there used to live a brindled ox, and one day this swallowed a horse which had been left at the pond-side. This horse belonged to the lord of the land, who was so angry that he procured a bellows and caused stones to be heated with its aid and thrown into the pond. These heated stones destroyed one eye of the brindled ox, which fled and took up residence in the pond first mentioned and became its Warden.4 Another of these reports is from Ika-gun in SHIGA. Here in dry weather a ritual water-fight takes place between six villages on one side and twelve on the other. Once while the fight was in progress the water disappeared down a hole which had suddenly opened in the river-bed. The influential man of the district had a daughter who was blind in one eye, and, out of pity for the peasants, whose rice-plants would of course die unless water could be got to them, she jumped into the hole; whereupon a rock fell in after her and blocked up the hole, so that the water flowed again. Now, when the girl jumped in, she turned, some say, into a snake, but others, into a carp; and, either way, it is known that among the carp in the river there is always one at least which is blind in one eye. Whether there is any factual basis for these reports of one-eyed or monocularly deformed fish I am not ichthyologist enough to say, but I am inclined to doubt it. The second conceivable parallel concerns Mordiford in Here- fordshire. Here there was a dragon which claimed human victims. A criminal was reprieved on condition of slaying it, and he hid in a cider-barrel and killed the dragon with an arrow which he shot through the bung-hole. Unhappily for him, he died because of the dragon's poisonous breath. There used to be a representation of the dragon on the wall of Mordiford church. I have already mentioned that Japanese snake-monsters sometimes harm people with their poisonous breath, but that is not the point I wish to draw attention to. According to H. J. Massingham, author of The Southern Marches, on whom I am relying, one day in 1875 two old women were found in the church putting two newts to death in the font. 4 Here we may seem to have an ox Warden, but it is not actually stated that the ox was the Warden of the pond it lived in at first, and the people living nearest the pond it fled to do not seem to think of the Warden there as being an ox. M 161</page><page sequence="19">SNAKE AND DRAGON LORE OF JAPAN 'They believed', he says, 'that if the newts were not put to death in this ceremonious way they would grow up to become dangerous dragons.' Now, in the topographical work, the Hitachi no fudoki, probably of the eighth century, there is a myth or legend whose purpose appears to be to certify the divine ancestry of the heredi- tary priests of a shrine. The shrine was situated in what is now IBARAKI. According to the story, a woman, living with an elder brother, is visited nightly by an unknown man and becomes preg- nant. Here I translate a part of what is written. 'The month of birth arrived, and she gave birth to a small snake. When it was light it seemed to be without words, but in the dark it talked with its mother. The mother and uncle were alarmed, thinking this strange, and wondered if it could be the child of a deity. They therefore put it in a pure cup and provided a stand on which they installed it. In the course of one night it completely filled this cup. They then changed this for a jar in which they placed it, but again it filled the jar. They went on like this three or four times, till they no longer dared to use a vessel. The mother told the child "Measuring you by vessels, we see clearly that you are the child of a deity." ' In the sequel the child kills its uncle and is injured by its mother. No commentator seems to have explained this strange story satis- factorily, but it seems that some ceremony must lie behind it. I may add that in local legends about the great-serpent Wardens of pieces of water it is not uncommon to hear that the Warden started in a smaller pond but grew too big for it and so shifted to its present abode. It certainly seems fantastic to suppose that two old women in Herefordshire less than a hundred years ago knew something about a pre-Christian ceremony in which a small reptile was placed in a sacred vessel and might be expected to increase greatly in size. But is it any less fantastic to suppose that they performed their extraordinary action - assuming, that is, that the story about them is not itself traditional - without having some traditional ground for it? As a matter of fact I had another reason for bringing in this second, rather unconvincing suggestion of a parallel. It will serve as an excuse for giving one folktale from a modern collection. This contains the motif of the transfer from smaller to larger vessels. The story comes from a collection made in IWATE by Sasaki-Kizen: 162</page><page sequence="20">SNAKE AND DRAGON LORE OF JAPAN A father and mother [we shall presently hear that they were child- less, but let that pass]-A father and mother had gone to the fields after the rains were over, and towards evening when they were about to go home they went to fetch their coolie-hats from the side of the field; and coiled up in one of them there was a small snake. Drive it away as they would, it came straight back in every time, and so, since the couple were child- less, they took it home and put it in a bowl to rear it. The snake got bigger and bigger till it could no longer be kept in the bowl, and then they put it in a wash-tub to rear it. However, it got still bigger, and so they put it in a horse's feed-tub to rear it. There came a time when the snake said to its father and mother, 'Now I'm off to the rich man's to get one of his daughters.' The rich man was having supper when there was the sound of some- one at the entrance gateway saying, 'Open up, please'; so the eldest daughter went out to see who it was, but there was nobody there. 'Well! And nobody there!' she said, and she came back and was eating her supper when again there was the sound of a voice from the road in front. This time the second daughter went out to look, but as before there was nobody there. 'Well! Isn't that funny? And nobody there!' she said, and she came back and was eating her supper when once more a voice said, 'Open up, please.' This time the third daughter went to look, and as before there was nobody there. After she had come back, the voice again said, 'Open up, please,' and so the master went to look, and there was a large snake there, which said: 'Let me have one of your daughters as a bride. If not, I will coil round this mansion and smash it.' The master said, 'It'd not be possible to give a daughter to a thing like you'; then the snake said, 'In that case, I'll smash the house,' and it wound itself tightly round the house and was about to smash it. The master was so amazed and terrified that to get rid of the snake he promised to give it one of his daughters. That evening the master became ill through worrying too much, and even when morning came he did not get up and eat. The eldest daughter went and said, 'Father, I would be obliged if you'd take breakfast,' to which the master answered: 'Mm, I'd be pleased to get up and eat, but the fact is, there was a big snake at the front entrance last night, and it told me to give it one of my daughters.' After he had explained why he had promised it one, he went on, 'If you'll oblige me by going, I'll bestir myself and make my meal.' When the girl heard this, she was terribly angry. 'Who'd ever go to be the bride of a snake of all things?' she fumed, and she took herself off. The second daughter, too, came to rouse her father, but when he told her about the snake she too retired in a rage. The third daughter came to rouse him, and when he told her the 163</page><page sequence="21">SNAKE AND DRAGON LORE OF JAPAN story she said, 'In that case, I'll go bride at the snake's; so I'd be obliged if you'd make your meal.' Then the father went to the town and bought for his youngest daughter a beautiful kimono and sash, and he did not come back till he had made all the arrangements for the bride-going. And then he went with her to see her off, and just outside the gateway was the snake, which put the girl up on its body and took her off gleefully to its home, where it said: 'Look, Father; look, Mother! I've been and got the rich man's daughter.' The father and mother were pleased, and they went off to work in the fields, leaving their snake son and the beautiful girl to look after the house. After they had gone, the snake climbed onto the straw-beating stone and told the girl, 'I'm going to keep lying here, and I want you to hit me round the liver with the straw-beating mallet.' With the big mallet the girl hit the snake just as she had been told to, and its liver jumped smartly away into the opposite corner and turned into a right and proper handsome man. The girl was pleased and came and embraced him, and, while they were talking together by the fire, the father and mother came back from the fields, and they said, 'Where does that young master there come from?' When the couple told them that this was what their snake son had turned into, they were terribly pleased, and they told the rich man, who made himself responsible for a delightful wedding ceremony. The rich man's other two daughters were so ashamed of themselves that they went away. I64</page></plain_text>
