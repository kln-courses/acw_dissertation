<plain_text><page sequence="1">Market Association Leaders' Strategic Use of Language and Narrative in Market Disputes and Negotiations in Kumasi, Ghana Gracia Clark Contemporary market traders in Kumasi, Ghana, rely on the leaders of their market groups, which unite those who trade in a specific commodity, to settle daily disputes within the market and to negotiate with outside authorities during times of crisis. Skill in handling disputes by using the appropriate rhetorical strategies marks rising elders as potential candidates for future leadership positions. Conventional procedures have evolved to incorporate the indigeneous principles of dispute settlement accepted by group members (usually ethnically homogenous, whether Asante or not), along with aspects borrowed from Christian and Islamic practices, national common-law courts, trade unions, and cooperatives. This paper looks at the norms invoked and transgressed in several characteristic disputes involving Asante commodity group leaders in Kumasi Cen- tral Market. In one case, the leader of the orange traders settled a quarrel between two wholesale traders who had been steady partners. Repeated narratives of the events in question turned out to be the primary procedure for identify- ing and negotiating conflicting claims. In the second case, market leaders met to negotiate with soldiers, local govern- ment representatives, and farm leaders about price controls. Rhetorical devices that traders considered patronizing and inappropriate became the focus of their resentment. In a third case, traders' leaders negotiated over freight rates with drivers and porters who carried their goods. The two sides jockeyed over procedural issues until the actual negotiations stalled. In a fourth case, the original issue of unpaid credit was soon overwhelmed by outrage at procedural abuses that undermined the reputation of the market leader. The need to keep trade running smoothly mandates compliance with these institutions despite their lack of explicit legal status.</page><page sequence="2">Introduction The labyrinthine stalls of Kumasi Central Market, surrounded by bustling lorry parks and wholesale yards, occupy the contemporary heart of this historic capital of the Asante Empire. Daily hosting more than fifteen thousand traders and countless buyers, this market remains one of the most powerful and emblematic economic institutions of Ghana's second largest city, which is also a regional capital and a primary road and rail center. Clearing an immense daily volume of goods headed for interregional exchange, as well as most of the consumer needs for a city of 800,000, chal- lenges traders to draw strongly on both their traditional regulatory models and their capacity for social innovation. Their leaders, within a variegated pattern of commodity group formation, provide important services needed to keep transactions flowing at this fast pace. Leaders' duties feature set- tling disputes between traders and their commercial partners and negotiat- ing the relative prestige and prerogatives of traders with groups outside the market. Verbal skills and strategies, especially in narrative format, consti- tute major tools for leaders working to achieve these goals and for ordinary traders keeping their businesses afloat. Charles Briggs and other analysts of disputing discourse have been productively exploring the systematic and creative role language plays in constituting social relations (Brenneis 1988). If conflict is central to social life in general, as Briggs suggests, then conflict language emerges as a very active participant in social dynamics (Briggs 1996a:5, Mertz 1994:436). The structure and content of conflict discourse reveal and shape the character of social organization, whether this is egalitarian or hierarchical. Discur- sive competence or virtuosity in manipulating the privileged and inclusive aspects of dispute language can express and create either solidarity or difference. Dominant individuals and groups can use norms of conflict discourse to underline and legitimate their authority, while others strive likewise to contest it (Briggs 1996a:6). Depending on whether confirming such social relations or affecting a material outcome is more significant at a given point, the emphasis shifts between the quality of language perfor- mance itself and confirming a given point of fact or rule (Briggs 1996a:24). In Asante culture, narrative competence is central to the exercise of citizenship at many levels. Children are judged on their growing intel- ligence and reliability by their observed performance in narrating the ammanee ("mission statement") routinely produced by adults also when arriving on an errand or from a trip of any kind (Yankah 1995:58). Training in moral and philosophical thought comes through hearing and perform- ing the well-known genre of folktales featuring Ananse the spider and other anthropomorphic animal characters. Moral and philosophical discus- sion between adults commonly takes the form of recounting a narrative example, from which the listener is left to draw his or her own conclusions. Whether in private conversation or public debate, effective narrative skills are widely displayed and appraised in the evaluation of future and current community leaders. p LA 0 0 z -r m c m C) m 0 n z C m uz m LA c m Ln</page><page sequence="3">Asante women predominate among Kumasi Central Market traders, who are about seventy percent Asante and about seventy percent women, so it is not surprising that the dominant leadership institutions follow models available in Asante culture for female leadership roles. The most influential market leaders, the ahemmafuo (pl.) of the local foodstuffs groups most dominated demographically by Asante women, have directly appropriated the terminology of female chiefship. Interestingly enough, leaders who are not Asante women most often defer to the senior ahem- mafuo in negotiations affecting the market as a whole. This is consistent with the common stereotype of the market as a "women's place," despite the substantial minority of men who work there as traders, craftsmen, and porters. The few market groups dominated by Asante men use the ohene title, although more gingerly, while those in which Northern men predomi- nate deploy terminology and ideals drawn from Muslim, Hausa, or other savannah cultural systems. In the Asante chiefly hierarchy, at each level from the lineage to the nation, each community is represented by a pair of male and female chiefs, the ohene and ohemma (both singular) respectively, who must consult a council of elders. The courtly speech in which cases and policies are argued relies heavily on proverbs, many of which allude to familiar narratives such as the Anansesem fables or prominent historical events. Success in disputes and influence as an elder or subchief largely depends on subtle mastery of this ohenfie kasa or palace language (Yankah 1995). The higher-level chiefs are assisted, especially in court proceedings and negotiations, by one or more highly skilled akyeame. These renowned "linguists" of Asante acted as orators, emissaries, and recorders, more than translators. Asante women do have some access to displaying such mastery, although less than men on the whole. As Stoeltje and Obeng show in this issue, women do speak on their own behalf in chiefly courts, where their speaking properly is expected and rewarded. But the market is associ- ated with women, and market language, the rough and direct speech that makes rapid exchange efficient, is often cited as the antithesis of elaborate courtly speech. Even in the courts of the community ahemma (pl.), the vast majority of participating subchiefs, elders and akyeame are normally men, although the off-stage expertise of the old woman (aberewa) is also acknowledged. Individual women, however, can still display virtuosity in courtly language as disputants, as designated elders, and occasionally even as named holders of the normally male offices of ohene and okyeame (Yankah 1995, Stoeltje 2000). Stoeltje and Obeng remark in this issue that in practice women often find it easier than men to abide by the strict courtly language norms of deference, apology, and indirection. Although they have no official place in the carefully ranked chiefly hierarchy that culminates with the Asantehene and Asantehemma, the market ahemmafuo do successfully invoke its continuing prestige and legitimacy for their own members' needs. They formally acknowledge alle- giance to these royals on ceremonial occasions and participate in palace festivities as loyal citizens. Market leaders also deploy strategically many C) -I 0 0 Ln G'</page><page sequence="4">procedural norms of dispute settlement drawn from chiefly practice. While they usually employ a much simplified version of these norms, some of the more elaborate aspects, such as the use of okyeame spokeswomen, the third person, and other indirect speech forms, tend to appear in particularly tense cases. The examples examined here, however, show an ambiguous relation- ship between contemporary market disputing and negotiating procedures and their chiefly antecedents. Market ahemma most obviously depart from Asante community leadership models by serving alone, without corre- sponding male chiefs, and by being selected from an occupational group rather than a chiefly matrilineage. The current market commodity-group structure evolved from a few pioneering groups founded in the first decades of colonial rule, in response to the challenges of a marketplace system then rapidly expanding in volume and complexity in response to improved road and rail transport, freer access to Kumasi by non-Asantes, and urbaniza- tion. Most groups were first established in the 1930s or the 1950s, but they continued to adapt sensitively to changes in the economic and social envi- ronment throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. As presently structured, Kumasi market groups also incorporate elements of procedure, titles, and norms from Western civic and Christian models (including cooperatives and unions), alongside the various indigenous models just mentioned. Market Needs Market traders developed organizational, conceptual, and procedural inno- vations to meet their own very specific and acute needs for dispute settle- ment. Typical cases concern overdue credit, or contest who bargained for which pile of yams, calling in confirming witnesses from among market neighbors. Some commodity groups, including the orange traders in Ku- masi Central Market, reduce such disputes by employing literate "check- ers" in their wholesale areas, who record the amount purchased by each retailer in the morning and go around to collect payments in the afternoon. While these oral contracts could theoretically be enforced in court, other breaches of market etiquette, such as stealing customers, have no statutory or customary standing but are important to the smooth flow of business. The need to defend one's trading reputation in front of one's professional peer group also favors handling disputes within the market itself. Traders need to settle their cases rapidly, without the procedural tangles of the chiefly courts or the national courts (both different but sub- stantial and requiring knowledgeable assistance). Disputes in this market frequently involve a traveling trader, who needs to get back on the road immediately to continue bringing in goods. Time lost from work costs any trader dearly, from her lost income and disrupted contact with her steady customers. In disputes over perishable goods, a day or two in court is enough to destroy the value of the contested goods. As one trader put it, -I 0 P C' H 0 ;D m 0 On LA z m m m c m Tl) z C) z z ;D H :&gt; m r- z H c m</page><page sequence="5">"losing a case in the market is cheaper than winning the case in court." Potential customers will hesitate to make important deals with traders with a reputation for disputatiousness, even when they have usually been judged in the right. The direct and indirect costs of disputes would threaten already narrow profit margins. Market dispute settlement procedures in Asante are not only a twentieth-century innovation, but displaced quite different institutions of market dispute settlement that were in place before colonial conquest. In the nineteenth century, the Asantehene appointed male elders or sub- chiefs to supervise the various major markets throughout Asante, includ- ing Kumasi Central Market, as part of a palace, bureaucracy that regulated many aspects of trade. These market officials heard disputes between market traders and collected taxes and contributions due from traders. Today, palace market officials function primarily to collect traders' contribu- tions of foodstuffs for palace ceremonial occasions, but briefly reclaimed a more active role in moderating particularly violent periods of price-control enforcement, during 1979 and 1983. The current comprehensive system of commodity-based traders' groups, headed by individual leaders selected by the mature traders in each group, dates only from the 1930s and 1950s. The first publicly recognized leaders were those of the smoked fish and yam groups, who appear as peti- tioners to city and palace authorities in archival records from the 1910s and 1920s. The commodity-group format steadily expanded before and after independence in 1957, to cover almost all commodities traded by the 1970s. These clusters of group foundations coincided with decades of particularly acute political transition: the organization of colonial rule in the 1910s, the restoration of the Asante confederacy in the 1930s, and the agitation for independence in the 1950s, confirming that negotiations with outside political authorities were one of the major triggers for group formation (Clark 1994). During the same decades, new political and transport condi- tions brought rapid reorganizations of trade patterns that added new layers of intermediaries and shifted old boundaries between ethnic networks, intensifying the demand for internal dispute settlement services. Skill demonstrated in informal dispute settlement is one of the most important ways a junior elder can display his or her leadership potential. A case settled well is one that stays settled and does not reopen later or spawn further disputes. To satisfy both sides, the procedures and principles used must conform to generally accepted standards of fairness and correctness, a consensus that varies according to the predominant ethnicity of the trad- ers in that commodity. The leading commodity groups in Kumasi Central Market, those for local foodstuffs, have Asante women as leaders and as the vast majority of members. Asante cultural norms emphasize impartiality and evenhandedness in handling disputes as desirable leadership qualities. A skilled leader can identify or define an outcome that both parties can live with, through careful listening for a middle ground of consensus. Gifted Asante judges can perceive swiftly and accurately what terms a party will -I 0 G) r')</page><page sequence="6">eventually accept. Another substantial minority of Kumasi Central Market groups draw their leaders and members from Muslim cultures farther to the north. These traders reported following norms reminiscent of Islamic courts, with their more individualistic judges. The ideal leader male kola traders described was one who "speaks the truth," and was spiritually gifted to see when a witness is lying. The Asante and other Akan leaders follow a dispute-settlement model very widely accepted within the Akan cultural group, which extends beyond Asante to encompass about two-thirds of the Ghanaian population (Yankah 1995; Stoeltje 2000). Each party to the dispute states her or his case in full, ideally without interruption, before a council of elders. Questions, cross-examination, and witnesses then follow. Lesser elders each sum- marize the case in turn before the presiding chief announces the terms of settlement, to which both parties must formally agree. Effective speaking in court is not only elegant, but expresses the consensus persuasively and tactfully. Without directly contradicting previous narratives, the senior elder's formulation competes with them and pushes them aside, showing itself more convincing and acceptable. Any fines are paid to the injured party, not the chief, except for those required to repair ritual offenses. In market cases, transfers of goods or money take place immediately, before either party can change her mind. Between Two Orange Traders These procedural issues emerged very clearly in a case from the orange wholesale yard I witnessed in 1979. The orange wholesalers operating in Kumasi Central Market were mainly Asante women, along with most of the retailers and travelers also in their commodity group. This dispute was an unusually bitter one, but witnesses considered that it had been settled very successfully, despite its difficulty. This was the dry season, hot and dusty, and oranges were scarce. Two of the wholesalers were each claim- ing a truckload of oranges as hers. The traveling trader who had brought them in from the farming area had been a steady customer of the first wholesaler for some time. This first wholesaler claimed that the traveler, before leaving Kumasi, had promised as usual to bring her some. After the traveler succeeded in finding some oranges, she returned to the Kumasi wholesale yard with them, but handed them over to a different wholesaler to sell on commission. The first wholesaler caught her doing this, but the traveler denied ever promising them to her, claiming she had only said she might bring them to her. The wronged woman began to complain loudly to bystanders, not involving any group elders yet. At this point it was the traveler who went to the market leader, protesting that the first wholesaler was slandering her to their neighbors. The case then proceeded through a series of narratives of the alleged events. When the offended wholesaler arrived, she told the whole story to 0 0 p 4 0 G)P cI 00 m z m -i C) LA, m 0 z :) I z z :- m c m LA, C) -4</page><page sequence="7">justify her critical remarks. Then the traveler gave her account of what had really happened. These two narratives were each directed at the ohemma, who said very little. Her most emphasized point was that each of the dis- putants should not be interrupted until she had finished. Mertz notes how often U.S. disputants allowed to tell their own stories in full are more ready to compromise than those not given this procedural autonomy (Mertz 1996: 138). Friends of each party to the dispute gathered behind them, and when both had finished, each retired to retell her story to her own supporters. Other commodity group elders trading nearby arrived very quickly, but the ohemma did not repeat the lengthy, detailed accounts she had just heard, to bring them up to date. Instead, she greeted them with terse remarks such as "she brought some oranges," which referred to none of the issues under dispute. At that time, I wondered whether the ohemma was still concerned not to speak for the disputants, who were each still talking loudly for themselves only a few steps away. I thought that perhaps she was preoccupied with planning her response, or could not be bothered to repeat what she had already heard once. These speculations were soon contra- dicted by the many repetitions of the entire story spoken later by the dis- putants, their supporters, and various mediators. It became clear that these narratives themselves were an important part of the process of settling the dispute, not only revealing but reconstituting or contesting the social rela- tions between disputants and also those involving other participants and observers (Briggs 1996a:5-6). The pattern of successive narratives alerted me to this because it was the opposite of what I had expected. Elders who arrived even later, those from the far side of the market, were given fuller recapitulations of the story by the ohemma. I had expected her to give them ever shorter, con- densed versions, as she perhaps tired of repeating it and as more of those present had heard the disputants' long stories for themselves. Instead, the ohemma retold longer and longer versions as those participating in the dispute focused more tightly on reaching a settlement. Her first few versions included hardly anything of the facts of the case. Their stunted form instead served to notify those arriving that the dispute was still in its early stages. I also noticed that the ohemma added first the least impor- tant and least controversial issues. Successive versions included more and more aspects of the situation, described more elaborately as time passed. I realized that as the ohemma was adding more and more points to her own narratives, she was taking them out of contention by stating them herself. All of these were points we had already heard plenty about from both dis- putants and their supporters, but once she had officially incorporated some- thing as an event in her own story, they could not directly contradict that version of events. At the same time, the successive narratives by the dispu- tants were getting gradually shorter and shorter and including fewer points as they dropped those issues which the ohemma had tacitly decided. Briggs remarks more generally on this process of conarrators sharing responsibil- ity for points they include in their own versions (1996a:19). pd 0 0 a</page><page sequence="8">The process of negotiating the settlement included many elements that are familiar in most dispute settlement situations requiring mutual agreement. Each party stepped aside repeatedly to caucus with her own group of supporters. They would agree with her and sympathize with her, but at the same time mollify her and encourage her to tone down her more extreme statements. She would try out more radical arguments with them first, testing their more sympathetic reaction before repeating these argu- ments in front of the ohemma and the other side. The elders would also propose sections of narration to her that they were willing to support. As Briggs explains, these were not just statements of what took place, but cognitive reframings of the situation that would position themselves and their disputant tolerably well (Briggs 1996a:23). Once the full complement of orange-group elders had arrived, a leading elder emerged on each side. These two were identified as leading the side discussions and counseling that disputant on what arguments to present or stress. These two also even- tually began to propose possible settlement terms, at first to their own dis- putants. Each admonished the disputant to be reasonable, but this also gave the disputant and her friends a chance to react to proposals frankly while these were still private suggestions, not the formulation of the ohemma. The ohemma could overhear most of these discussions and judge which terms might finally be accepted by both sides. Periodically, one or the other leading elder would bring her disputant back in front of the ohemma to present another narrative of the events with the proposed outcome as the final chapter. The other disputant would also turn back to hear this new proposal, without comment or interruption. If she broke out in loud outrage, her own supporters would bundle her away for further discussions in relative privacy. If she managed to keep her com- posure, she could right then present to the ohemma a rebuttal narrative that responded to the new proposals. When a point at issue finally appeared in similar forms in the narratives from both sides, it tended to drop out of their rival narratives. These got shorter and more tightly focused on the remaining issues still in dispute. Around the same time, that very point would begin to appear in the ohemma's narrative. This marked that it was becoming part of the agreement. The ohemma's narratives therefore got more comprehensive and longer as the two sides got closer to a settle- ment. This back-and-forth process took what seemed like hours, while I sat quietly and tried to make myself invisible. The orange traders all crowded around, shocked by the intensity of the quarrel. It was one of the bitterest disputes I witnessed, and triggered insults that underlined important trad- ing principles and ideals. At different times I heard each party shouting "I don't like to argue!" at the top of her voice. Each accused the other of trying to drive her out of business, invoking a central pillar of commodity group solidarity, something for everyone. "Maybe you want to be the only one selling oranges?" the traveler declaimed dramatically, looking around to attract wider support. This is a standard form of Asante denunciation for 4I 0 n m 0 V) 0 z m L: H ;n m C 0 c m 0 z C) H z 0 C) H LA</page><page sequence="9">arrogant selfishness or greed. Yankah presents an eloquent example from a chiefly debate that opens with, "Are you the only chief at this assembly?" (1995:66). The aggrieved orange wholesaler struck back with a fine piece of economic sarcasm, "Perhaps you have just recently started trading, and don't know how we do things." This would always be an insult here, because of the intense respect due to eldership of any kind, but the remark bit even harder when aimed at a woman who had in fact started coming to market on her mother's back, as most of the onlookers already knew. Finally, the ohemma declared her decision: the oranges in question should be divided in half, and half sold to each of the rival wholesalers. To underline her authority, she prefaced her announcement with a third- party formula, "the ohemma says." This phrase invoked the respected and respectful mediating role of the okyeame, who repeats and elaborates the chief's pronouncements in chiefly courts (Yankah 1995). Although here the ohemma was virtually acting as her own okyeame, the formal diction served to move the proceedings to a higher register, invoking other proce- dural norms that require deference and consensus (Briggs 1996a:26) This particular case then took a very deviant turn because the ohem- ma's settlement was not accepted by the traveler, who refused to give up her oranges. Elders and onlookers were aghast at this open defiance of the ohemma's authority, considered a much more serious offence than the original complaint. Despite frantic persuasion by her own supporters, the traveler was adamant. By this time, the oranges themselves were beginning to suffer from the effects of several hours uncovered in the hot sun. They needed to be sold, or at least moved into the shade of a stall, both of which required a legitimate owner. Abruptly, the ohemma said that she would take the whole shipment herself, sell it, and divide the profit between the two rival wholesalers. This quick solution was possible because she was herself an active wholesaler Traders were ecstatic at this unusual solution, and their enthusiasm confirmed its uniqueness. They hailed it as a stroke of genius, dancing and waving congratulatory white handkerchiefs in front of the ohemma, as for a chief or famous dancer. Many began to sing impromptu chants praising the ohemma, "This is the ohemma. We have a real ohemma." The retail- ers were satisfied that they would have some oranges to sell in a time of great scarcity, and could buy them directly from the ohemma without taking sides between the two wholesalers. The wholesalers each got some profit, but the traveler lost all of hers. Bystanders commented that she had actually gotten off easy because the ohemma would have been justified in fining her or confiscating the oranges outright as compensation for the insult to her authority, analogous to a fine for contempt of court. The ohemma showed even more virtue by declining to profit personally from the sale. The next day, no one would talk about the case. Their only response to questions was "it was settled, it was finished." Women who had observed the whole drama the day before and commented freely, including major p; 1-1% C) -I 0 a GO</page><page sequence="10">participants, now had nothing to say about it or even disavowed real knowl- edge. The very intensity of the dispute seemed to make them more reluc- tant to discuss it, since talking about it might reopen old wounds. My Akan research assistant was also reluctant to push on the issue, either by helping me formulate more tactful questions or even by discussing what she had also witnessed the day before. Just continuing to "talk" about it would imply that the ohemma had not succeeded in firmly settling it, indicating lack of respect for the office as well as the incumbent and what she had "spoken." Such incidents also remind researchers that participant-observa- tion remains a key method because there may be reasons some events are inaccessible even by careful interviewing. Traders and Soldiers In addition to negotiating settlement of internal disputes, the commodity group leaders in Kumasi Central Market also accept responsibility for nego- tiating on behalf of traders as a whole with local and central government representatives and other nontraders. During periods of intensive govern- ment intervention in the markets, such as in 1979 and 1984, they responded to frequent summonses to city and regional offices. They also held many public meetings in the market, and monitored events carefully. The com- bination of duties was physically exhausting for the many ahemma who were middle-aged or older. Those with arthritis complained that their knee problems and limited strength made attendance painful. A few moments after complaining about their knees, however, older market leaders would complain about inadequate consultation by the military authorities. "They don't talk," or "how can you talk with a gun?" were repeated by several market ahemma. The meetings were obviously frequent enough, but somehow did not qualify as proper talk. Privileged discursive spheres are generally created by speech, especially by conforming to the forms of discourse and speech style allowed (Briggs 1996b:205). I witnessed one such occasion that suggested that these events were primarily distinguished from legitimate, if unwelcome, negotiations by their departure from important procedural and verbal norms commonly accepted in Akan communities for such public negotiations. The most fundamental issue was the very purpose of the meeting itself. Asante dispute settlement norms take for granted that both dispu- tants do intend to find a mutually agreeable settlement by negotiation. Soldiers who called this meeting first described it as a consultation about price-control regulations with commodity leaders and elders. They ostenta- tiously set up a tape recorder, saying they were there to record the traders' views and report them back to Flight Lieutenant Rawlings, the head of state. This procedure situated the soldiers as emissaries collecting infor- mation, without authority themselves to reach a binding agreement. How- ever, their authoritarian actions and speeches before and at the meeting 0 :&gt; m V1 0 n z m Q m Li, Ln m 0 z C) c CL z 0 rn z Q z :D H C) 0 m z -v C m Li</page><page sequence="11">suggested the reverse problem, that the decisions had already been made long before they appeared at the meeting, and they were simply making the announcement, not negotiating. They had dictated the time and place of the meeting without any consultation of other participants on those pre- liminary points. It took place within the senior ohemma's meeting room in the wholesale yard, which they requisitioned during peak trading hours. They also ignored the ohemma's attempts to formalize procedures around herself as the presiding leader, by naming an elder to start the meeting as her okyeame. The speeches made at this meeting showed clearly that the two sides had very different ideas about appropriate ways of conducting a dispute. The first speakers included military officials and civilian leaders, includ- ing the national leaders of the farmers' association and the farm laborers' association. These men harangued the seated traders about what they were doing wrong, what the government required of them in the future, and what would happen to them if they didn't comply. This left no pretense of considering the traders' views before arriving at a recommendation or judgment on the issues. Traders' agreement to their terms was assumed, or rather demanded. Conversely, market and chiefly cases punctiliously allow disputants and supporting elders time for commentary before the presiding elder even declares her opinion. Accepting the rhetorical struc- tures of participation in a discursive sphere usually incorporates accepting a specific form of expected outcome, whether consensual or authoritative (Briggs 1996a:28). Traders responded to these belligerent presentations with narratives about how they brought food from the farms, how they bargained with farmers over prices, and what risks they encountered. These accounts from the traders' point of view addressed some points made by earlier speakers directly and others indirectly, but also sought to shift debate to different issues, like the high cost of transport. This cognitive reframing became their primary objective once they realized that the outcome was a foregone conclusion. The male speakers did not even bother to respond to points raised by the traders, further distancing themselves from chiefly models of dispute settlement or consultation with elders. Following Asante court procedures, the ordinary elders spoke first and the yam ohemma, first among equals, spoke last. She referred repeatedly to her ongoing nego- tiations with truck drivers' leaders over rising freight charges, raising an implied contrast to this meeting's lack of authority to decide anything. In discussions of this meeting after the visitors had left, traders expressed particular outrage at procedural and rhetorical features they thought were insulting. One ohemma retorted that "They spoke to us like children, when we are old enough to be their mothers!" Several explained that one military speaker had been especially disrespectful by repeatedly using the word Wati? (Have you heard?) which is most often used when scolding or instructing children. One of the bolder elders had responded in her own speech with the word "Yati" (Yes, we have heard, you have spoken) p C.) I 0 w r) 1,</page><page sequence="12">in an elaborately sarcastic groveling. Their opposition to the price-control policies themselves was drowned for the moment in a wave of anger at their treatment. Negotiations over Transport Rates Negotiations with truck drivers and porters showed that the same market leaders could contest economic issues fiercely with nontraders while abiding by Asante procedural norms and even while manipulating them deftly, as the nontraders also did. These meetings were also full of tension, since freight rates were a key factor in traders' profit margins. There was considerable jockeying over the day of the meeting, since Thursday was more convenient for traders and Sunday was more convenient for drivers. When the drivers called a Sunday meeting, the traders refused and named a Thursday. On that Thursday, the head of the drivers' union appeared but walked out. The yam ohemma then appealed to the market manager, who instructed the drivers to attend the meeting called by the traders. No fur- ther meeting did take place, and the drivers later successfully raised their rates unilaterally. Market ahemma consistently deployed more formal and elaborate procedures, some borrowed from the chiefly ahemma, when they wanted to show or receive extra respect. In her meeting with truck drivers, for example, one of the yam elders repeated everything the ohemma said in the third person, as an okyeame does in the chiefly courts. This elder, her classificatory sister, also appeared on the group's cooperative registration papers as its vice president. The yam ohemma also took pains to show respect through observing careful procedure to individuals who were clearly less powerful than her- self or her constituents. These efforts confirmed the legitimacy and impar- tiality of her dispute settlement and encouraged such people to continue bringing their disputes to her. The porters, men who pushed carts loaded with yams, had a wildcat strike to raise their carting fees shortly after the truck drivers raised theirs. The elderly head of the yam porters' group came to the yam traders' meeting shed to arrange negotiations wearing a spot- less white embroidered gown, in contrast to his usual torn, dirty working clothes. Traders treated him with respectful formality that day, although he was sometimes a figure of fun, and remarked upon his unexpected abil- ity to present a dignified appearance. He had brought along the drivers' union president to support him, more powerful and therefore his "elder," although actually much younger. The traders promised gravely to consider a raise, although in the end they delayed negotiations with the low status porters indefinitely, as the drivers had with them. p 0 Ln 4-4 m m -i~ LA~ 0 -4 0 z m G) c m rIn -4i C) z G) c C) m z m r- z -4 0 :t m C m --I -i,</page><page sequence="13">A Distant Farmer Collects a Debt Another dispute received even more formal treatment and shows clearly how procedural and rhetorical formality invokes norms of mutual respect. Since this case involved a farmer from a rural yam-producing region, the Kumasi traders were very concerned to defend the jurisdiction of their yam ohemma in settling disputes between traders and farmers. The farmer arrived unexpectedly in the yam ohemma's office in the wholesale yard, accompanied by his elder brother and a few neighboring farmers. They stated their case to the ohemma and those present when they arrived. She hastily summoned a full meeting that afternoon of all the elders, and sent off for the trader with whom he had a dispute. Before the trader arrived, she was already in trouble. As a traveler, she regularly brought yams to Kumasi and was reasonably well known there, but the ohemma remarked ominously "I don't know her." It turned out that she had never bothered to formally join the commodity group in Kumasi; her name was not on the membership list. From what followed, it became evident that her lack of proper respect for the commodity group and its leader went far beyond simply avoiding paying her dues. The courtesy with which these farmers were received, seated, brought water to drink, and eventually seen off to the lorry park was striking, far exceeding the treatment of fellow traders in an ordinary internal dispute. The market elders listened with positive reverence to their full narrative, which opened the formal proceedings. They questioned the men gently, asking for clarification rather than challenging any points they made. It turned out to be a credit case. The traveler had convinced this farmer to give her a load of yams on credit, with the promise of payment when she next returned to that area. Many Kumasi-based travelers made such arrangements with farmers when they could, in growing areas where they were known well and visited regularly. During the peak harvest season, such credit keeps the yams moving when money runs short. Dis- putes over delayed payment are not unusual. This trader not only failed to pay when she next returned, but had convinced the same farmer to advance her another load of yams. She seemed to have been unnaturally persuasive, and had even collected a third load on credit, despite his protests. Elders in the back row of the meeting room began to murmur speculations that he was mentally retarded, although he clearly had enough sense to grow a bountiful crop. His elder brother did all the talking in the dispute, and they thought he should have handled the selling as well. More murmuring erupted when the farmer narrated how he had told the trader he would come to Kumasi Central Market and report her to the yam ohemma. To frighten him away from doing this, she told him the ohemma would refuse to hear his case, and finally said the ohemma would have him beaten if he dared to come there. This was clearly an affront to the authority and dignity of the ohemma's office, and a slander to her impartiality as a judge. Quite apart from the merits of the original debt p; O-tI 0 Ln U1 U, C,</page><page sequence="14">complaint, this was a serious offense in itself. Like the orange trader who refused to abide by her own ohemma's decision, she had contradicted her legitimacy as a leader. When the traveler had her turn to speak, she only made matters worse by appealing to their sense of solidarity as traders on illegitimate grounds. She said, "We all do this, don't we?" implying general dishonesty in credit when they could get away with it. This not only insulted the individuals present but threatened the reputation of Kumasi traders as a whole. One of the elders, actually the same hothead who had been sarcastic to the sol- diers, rose and delivered a scathing denunciation. "Who do you mean by this 'we'? We certainly don't all do this. If we did, the farmers would stop giving us credit! " This would exacerbate serious capital problems for many reliable traders at the peak harvest season. Traders were also well aware that it was to their advantage to encour- age farmers to continue bringing their disputes with traders to the Kumasi market leaders. The farmers had several alternative venues where they could have taken such a debt case. District courts in the statutory system would have enforced collection, and so would the local chief's court. The chief of this particular yam-growing area had issued edicts recently sup- porting the commercial prerogatives of local traders over those coming from Kumasi. During a later period of civil unrest, a chief farther north "recommended" that Kumasi traders stay away for their own safety and rely on local traders to bring yams to Kumasi. Traders might expect a less sympathetic hearing of disputes with farmers by either type of local court, besides the expense and delay of travel to the supply area to attend court. All yam travelers thus benefited from maintaining their leader's good repu- tation for effective and fair dispute settlement among the yam farmers in specialized supply areas. The market elders had no hesitation in putting such collective interests over those of this one member, rather marginal and now rather disreputa- ble. She was ordered to find the money that very day and pay it over in their presence, and she went off to borrow it from a relative in the retail stall area. Apologies continued to the farmer delegation. They were assured that they could bring any problems to the Kumasi yam ohemma at any time. They would always be welcomed and heard fairly, and the trader found and brought to them. The elders even advised the young farmer privately to let his brother sell his yams for him in the future. A harsh attitude toward the slander of market institutions was also essential for maintaining internal discipline within the traders' group. Shocked elders remarked that the ohemma would have been well within her rights to fine her for the insult to her reputation, on top of the payment of the debt to the farmer. She could also have expelled her from the group (if she had been a member), revoking her right to sell in the Kumasi whole- sale yard. They said they expected that she would in fact stay away from Kumasi out of shame. - 0 Un -4 m LA LA 0 0 z m m n m m LA m z C z C1 rL/ c C m z z 9 ;c --i m LA</page><page sequence="15">The procedural and rhetorical norms of dispute settlement, which they shared with these Akan farmers, enabled them to show respect while underlining their own respectability. By following these mutually accepted conventions with a flourish, they demonstrated the legitimacy and efficacy of their dispute settlement institutions in a way that was meaningful to themselves and their interlocutors. This was the more necessary because these leadership institutions had in fact largely been invented within living memory, since the 1930s, and had been under direct attack that year (1979) by the national authorities and public media. Conclusion The strategic use of a range of procedural and performative alternatives by traders themselves (both leaders and ordinary group members) and by nontraders from either higher or lower status categories demonstrates a high degree of sophistication about the implications of various choices. Narrative conventions appeared among the most important of the norms that could be invoked or transgressed by traders and their counterparts to make points about social relations, including relative status, that they could count on being widely understood. In dispute and negotiation con- texts, accomplishing the performative goals of the incident seemed to be as central a goal as arriving at favorable outcomes in terms of factual findings or an agreed settlement. Briggs's advice to consider narratives not just as "sources of information about conflicts" but as "central facets of conflict processes" (1996:3) not only yields a rich lode of interpretation of these cases, but seems congruent with these participants' own weighting of the significance of various aspects of a dispute. Prominent market leaders are well aware of the central role of such performances in polishing and defending the solid public image that enables them to exercise effective leadership and community influence. Their elders and followers consistently mention maintaining this kind of personal reputation through dignified public appearances as a central duty or function of market leaders. It not only brings personal prestige to the individual herself, but benefits traders as a whole by providing them with an effective advocate in time of personal or public crisis. Skill in manipu- lation of narrative forms and other aspects of leadership performance, often invisibly appearing as "force of personality," complements personal connections to powerful political factions or families that also provide significant influence. These all become group assets for market traders in the continual, historical social process of jockeying for relative position in the long or medium term with other occupational, economic or political groupings also deploying the same kinds of resources.
