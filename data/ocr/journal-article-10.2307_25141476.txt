<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE BULLETIN OF THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART IN TWO PARTS THIRTY-FIFTH YEAR JUNE, 1948 NUMBER SIX: PART TWO REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1947 WILLIAM M. MILLIKEN, Director The year 1947 broke all records for attendance, with a total of 429,033. This exceeds the figure of 418,505 made in I936, the year of The Great Lakes Exposition. It is also some 23,000 over last year's total, which was the second best. What is so gratify ing is that the attendance was the result, not of a special exhibi tion of great popularity, but of a steady increase which was well distributed over nearly every month of the year. That is a proof, and a most welcome one, of the fact that the Museum is increasingly a center in the community for recreation and education. Furthermore, there is evidence that the Museum is tapping more and more the large area which Cleveland serves in both Ohio and adjoining states. The year has been saddened by the death of Mrs. Windsor T. White, a member of the Holden family whose interest in the Museum has been so paramount from its founding. Mrs. White had been a part of the Advisory Council since I929. It was characteristic of her concern about the Museum and the Fine Arts Garden that she should have remembered the Museum handsomely in her will. Woods King, Council member, died January 15. A collection planned by him, given in memory of Ralph King, went on exhibition the day he died. Another mem ber of the Council, Cornelia Blakemore Warner, left $5,000 for the use of the Oriental Department, in which she and her hus band were so much interested. Three individual Membership Endowments, the George C. Lucas Memorial, the Elizabeth Brainard Thomson Denison Memorial, and the Harold A. and Claribel D. Hallstein Fund were established, as well as two Contributing Membership Endowments, the Clara Mayer Memorial, and the Mr. and Mrs. Walter L. Flory Fund. Mr. Mather in his Letter of Transmission has stressed the impor tance of these smaller funds, whose principal is added to by yearly gifts. There are now 52 Membership Endowments and 119</page><page sequence="2">THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART 14 Contributing Endowments, totaling 66. Museum member ship continues its steady gain and totals now 3,827. The policy of publishing catalogues of important exhibitions has now been firmly established, and the Degas catalogue issued during the year is an important addition to the literature on that artist. The Publication Fund, a revolving fund established by a grant from the Elisabeth Severance Prentiss Fund and added to handsomely by Hanna Fund, has enabled the Museum to do this, as well as to extend its color reproductions by new plates and to augment the color post cards which find such a ready sale. It is hoped, as the years pass by, that Picture Books of various distinguished sections of the collection can be issued from time to time. Publications such as these are exceptionally important in making known the Museum's treasures to an increasing public. Another means which has been very important in widening the circle to which the Museum appeals is the Junior Council. Through its vital interest it has been instrumental in bringing many younger people in touch with the Museum. The Council's knowledge of the Museum's problems and its familiarity with the Museum's collections have been important in interpreting to the public the ideals and the ideas which guide the Museum's development. The members have individually been valuable as volunteers. With the Cleveland News, the Council has continued to sponsor the Christmas Community Candlelight Program, the original idea for which was suggested by one if its members. This service on the Sunday before Christmas has become one of the memorable events on the Museum's calendar. Miss Helen Cole, the Council's Chairman, has been helpful in every way in furthering its cooperation with Museum officials. The acquisitions of the Department of Paintings are truly distinguished. They are highlighted by the addition of two remarkable canvases in widely different fields, each of them a masterpiece. In the realm of the Old Master, the "Portrait of Isabella Brant," the first wife of the painter, gives the Museum a Rubens which is the quintessence of all the qualities which make him a painter's painter. It is the famous picture which was purchased for the Marcus Kappel Collection in Berlin by Wilhelm von Bode, Director of the Kaiser Friedrich Museum in Berlin, and which he always fondly hoped would eventually 120</page><page sequence="3">REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR form part of his Museum's collections. It is a painting in Rubens's happiest vein, with his unequaled vivacity and fresh spontaneity. It was acquired from the Mr. and Mrs. William H. Marlatt Fund. The second canvas is a masterpiece of the end of the nineteenth century, one of the finest pictures of the last period of Vincent Van Gogh, entitled "Les Paveurs," or "The Road Menders." This is a canvas painted in I889, when Van Gogh was in the asylum at St. Remy. It depicts a street in Arles, with great plane trees lining each side. The trees palpitate in movement of quite extraordinary intensity, their branches arching in a tunnel-like vista which produces a remarkable sense of three-dimensional form. This purchase was made possible by a most generous gift from Hanna Fund, and so is an addition to the remarkable series of pictures, most of them of this period, which have already come from that source. The gift of Mrs. Henry White Cannon of two early Monets, painted in 1881 and in 1882, respectively, supplements admirably the group of Impressionist pictures in the Museum collection. One is a seascape near Trouville, the other a wheatfield near the artist's home at Giverny. These canvases are a delightful foil to the Wade Monet, painted in Antibes, which is slightly later and shows the atmospheric qualities of the south of France. Another purchase for the Marlatt Fund was the small and dramatic "Head of a Woman," by Francesco Guardi, one of his less known figure pieces that are increasingly attracting approba tion. Leonard C. Hanna, Jr., also added to the Coralie Walker Hanna Memorial Collection the fine"General Duncan Camp bell," by Sir Henry Raeburn. In the realm of American painting, a good "Portrait of a Man," by Samuel L. Waldo and William Jewett, added another excellent example by artists hitherto unrepresented in the early American series; it was a Bequest of Kate Buckingham Sheadle. A mid-nineteenth-century canvas by the negro painter, Robert S. Duncanson, "Valley of Lake Pepin, Minnesota," represents the work of a man painting in the tradition which stems from the Hudson River School; it was a gift of William Macbeth, Inc., through Robert G. McIntyre. The remaining acquisitions in this department fall into cer tain general groups. From Mrs. Malcolm L. McBride came water colors by the Americans, Charles Campbell, Yasuo 121</page><page sequence="4">THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART Kuniyoshi, and Walt Kuhn, as well as "The Grampians," by the Scotchman, James McBey, and two works by the Frenchmen, Henri Verge Sarrat and Edy Legrand. A Maine water color by Carl Sprinchorn was given by E. R. Brumley through William Macbeth, Inc. The art of contemporary Mexico is excellently shown in a canvas by Rufino Tamayo, a Mexican working in the United States. It is his "Woman Reaching for the Moon," purchased with funds given by Hanna Fund. There were added, also, an excellent group of Cleveland water colors and oils, some purchased from the Cleveland Traveling Exhibitions Fund and from the Silver Jubilee Purchase Fund; these include works by Grace V. Kelly, Dean Ellis, Eileen B. Ingalls, Clayton J. Bachtel, Roger W. Anliker, Peter Paul Dubaniewicz and Viktor Schreckengost. The Rorimer-Brooks Anniversary Award, a special purchase prize, was given to Jack Burton's "Aftermath." Finally, a group of the friends of the artist, Sandor Vago, gave in his memory his fine "Self Portrait." A group of friends also represented "The Bay of Douarnenez, Treboul, Brittany," by the late Alexander Warshawsky. "The Shining Rocks of the Ancients," by May Ames came from her estate. The Department of Prints and Drawings during the past year acquired four prints and seven drawings by purchase and 230 prints and eleven drawings as gifts. To the resources of the department were added 1,181 photographic reproductions of Old Master drawings, supplementing the large number already available as basic study material. The print purchases were all for the Dudley P. Allen Collection, the income of that fund being set aside for particularly important acquisitions. A rare Italian, late fifteenth-century engraving, "The Fate of the Evil Tongue," by Nicoletto Rosex (da Modena) heads the list. In German engraving, a brilliant impression of Martin Schon gauer's "God the Father and the Blessed Virgin Enthroned" added one of the artist's greatest prints to the notable group already in the Museum. "The Vision of St. Bernard," by Dirick Jacobsz Vellert, is a Flemish print of unusually fine quality, and the last purchase, a great rarity, was the "Portrait of Jacques Marguet de Norvins," by Ingres. From the Allen Fund came, also, two drawings, by Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo, which increase to eight the number of the Pulcinella series in the Cleveland collection. The other Old Master drawing was I22</page><page sequence="5">REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR acquired through the John L. Severance Fund. It is "The Funeral of St. Stephen," and is attributed to Domenico Ghirlandaio. The four other drawings are modern and they were added to the Hinman B. Hurlbut Collection. They range from Camille Pissarro's "Gardeuse de vache" and the English sculptor Henry Spencer Moore's drawing for his famous "Madonna and Child," to Salvador Dali's drawing for the Steuben glass bowl, also owned by the Museum, and William Sommer's "Seated Man." An exceptional gift was the group of 138 prints by various artists and a handsome wash drawing by Muirhead Bone, all given by Leonard C. Hanna, Jr. It is impossible to enumerate all, but outstanding among them are two beautiful engravings by Schongauer, seven by Aldegrever, H. S. Beham, and J. T. de Bry; three etchings by Rembrandt, five by Buhot; a rare lithographic proof by Daumier; and thirty-three etchings, dry points, and mezzotints by Seymour Haden. Six prints in various processes were presented by Mrs. Malcolm L. McBride, among them two Leperes, a Bonington, a Grant Wood. Very welcome were the four drawings by Guy Pene du Bois, Emil Ganso, Boardman Robinson, and Willem Van de Velde I, respectively, from that same generous source. Additions were made to three memorials, the Mary Spedding Milliken Collection, the Mr. and Mrs. Charles G. Prasse Col lection, and Harry and Birdie Price Chamberlin Collection; and Miss Clara S. Kraus gave two prints in memory of her mother, Mrs. Rosa Kraus. Other donors included Mr. and Mrs. Theodore Spector, Grover Higgins, Harold M. Hahn, Professor and Mrs. Sam L. Greenwood, Mr. and Mrs. William S. Kinney, Mr. and Mrs. I. T. Frary, Mr. and Mrs. William G. Mather, Edward Weisgerber, and the Estate of Hasseltine Bourland. The Print Club, with its usual generosity, presented an effective group: "Portrait of Erasmus of Rotterdam" by Van Dyck; a Diirer proof woodcut; an etching of Erasmus by Hopfer; the "Head of the Executioner," by Prince Rupert von der Pfalz; and a large and striking aquatint by Georges Rouault. As usual, the Club gave the preparatory sketches, plates, etc., for The Print Club publication by Salvador Dali. This gift was supplemented by an additional etching, an illustration for "Les Chants de&amp;Maldoror," also by Dali. To these must be added the 123</page><page sequence="6">THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART group of twelve Cleveland prints purchased from the May Show. It is significant that of the 234 prints acquired by the department during the year, 215 were gifts of The Print Club or of its individual members. The Department of Decorative Arts enjoyed a year rich in acquisitions. In fact, the acquisitions rank in importance only after those made from the Guelph Treasure. Of primary importance were the two great jewels bought from the Exhibi tion of Gold. First, there is the tiny triptych in gold and trans lucent enamel, a purchase from the J. H. Wade Fund, which came from the treasures of the Kremlin and was sold by the Russian Government at the same time that Andrew W. Mellon acquired the great pictures now in the National Gallery in Washington. The triptych is close in its style to the enamels on the cup of the kings of France in the British Museum, and is either from a Parisian workshop or a Burgundian one. The tiny figures relate themselves in their drapery to the work of the great Burgundian sculptor, Claus Sluter. The triptych dates to the beginning of the fifteenth century. Of the same general date, and also acquired through the J. H. Wade Fund, is the Burgun dian necklace, with decoration of enamel "en ronde bosse," the central medallion enclosing a tiny three-dimensional figure of a woman. The necklace came from the great private collection of Joseph Brummer, the New York antiquary, and was disposed of only after his death. It, again, is an object of the utmost rarity and distinction and helps to make the Wade Collection rank only with the Morgan Collection in the Metropolitan and the Walters Collection in Baltimore in medieval objects of rare quality. The Walters Art Gallery held this year one of the two greatest exhibitions of Byzantine art ever held. All the Byzantine objects from the Cleveland collection were lent to them for that occasion. Among them were the series of Byzantine jewelry bought for the Wade Fund during the year, nearly all of which are sixth century A. D., the period of Justinian and Theodora and the first Byzantine Renaissance. There were three beautiful necklaces with pendants, a gold hairpin, a gold pendant with intaglio, a gold tab and buckle for a belt, and two lovely earrings with pearls. Finally, this rare Byzantine accession included an eleventh-century steatite medallion. 124</page><page sequence="7">REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR The next large group of accessions was in the realm of sculpture. The Museum has been weak in small bronzes and in one year four exceptional ones have been acquired by gift and purchase. All came from the small and choice private collection of Dr. Erno Wittmann, formerly of Budapest. The earliest is a distinguished nude by a Sienese master, which was acquired from the John L. Severance Fund. Associated with it is a sensi tive Sienese figure of St. John and a unique plaque of a satyress by the famous Paduan, Riccio. These two latter pieces were presented by Mr. and Mrs. Severance A. Millikin. The fourth piece is a Wade Fund purchase, an earlier Paduan figure by a follower of Bellano. A small stone plaque in Kellheim stone is by the rare German master, Adolf Daucher, an addition to the Wade group of German sculptures, in which the Museum is rich. Modern sculpture is not unrepresented, and a Degas dancing figure was acquired from the Degas exhibition from the Hinman B. Hurlbut Fund. "Reunion," by Hugo Robus, a former Clevelander, was presented by the Shilling Fund and "The Driller," by Max Kalish, was given by a group of friends of the artist. A magnificent early eighteenth-century suite of sofa and four armchairs of the French Regency Period, upholstered in Savonnerie tapestry, was purchased for the John L. Severance Collection. These pieces join a tapestry in the same collection, the whole ensemble having been made for the marriage of a Countess de Merode and a Count Czernin, the tapestry bearing their coats of arms. From the same fund came a pair of ormolu candelabra, about 1740, by Jean-Joseph de Saint Germain.The majority of the accessions in the collections of pottery and porcelain date in the same century. This section is gradually developing, and important steps forward were made during the year. The purchases were headed by four remarkable pieces of French soft paste from the Karrick Riggs Collection. Two, a porcelain dredger, St. Cloud, and a Rouen blue and white vase, were Wade acquisitions, the pair of Mennecy cachepots were John L. Severance Fund, and the Chantilly pagod group, the Grace Rainey Rogers Fund. A group of early and rare pieces of Meissen, presented by A. and R. Ball, was headed by a stoneware vase by the great experimental potter, Boettger, who discovered true porcelain; this group also included two I25</page><page sequence="8">THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART pieces painted by two noted hausmaler and, among others, figurines of Frankenthal, Strassburg, and Nymphenburg, the latter a figure modeled by Bustelli. R. Thornton Wilson added another fine piece to the memorial to his wife, Florence Ells worth Wilson: a bagpiper, English, Astbury-Whieldon. In the realm of glass, an outstanding example of nineteenth-century glass of Bohemian origin was the gift of Mrs. S. Prentiss Baldwin on her ninety-fifth birthday. The other accessions were modern: two characteristic Italian, Venetian, pieces of recent date, added to the Mary Spedding Milliken Memorial Collection, and the "Nautilus Bowl," Steuben glass, acquired through the Hinman B. Hurlbut Fund. Cleveland ceramics and enamels were chosen from the May Show and other sources, and included a pottery bowl by Alice A. Ayars, given by Edris Eckhardt, and one added to the Mary Spedding Milliken Memorial Collection. To the latter collection were added, also, ceramic pieces by Andrews, Schulke, and Moodey, and enamels by Watkins, Hall, and Atchley. A fine enamel wall plaque, "Cycle of Life," by Edward Winter was the gift of Mrs. B. P. Bole. In ceramic sculpture, two pieces by Edris Eckhardt were acquired, one a gift of Mrs. Paul Moore, the other a purchase from the George J. Huth Purchase Fund. A fine Schreckengost came from the Cleveland Art Association. The year I947 was extraordinarily rich in gifts for the Pre Columbian Collections. Miss Helen Humphreys, an ever generous donor, presented fourteen pieces, one of them an exquisite small Mayan pottery figurine, and the rest golden amulets from Colombia and the Isthmus of Panama, all of them quite exceptional pieces. In addition to these should be men tioned a gold-plated anthropomorphic figure and a Peruvian stirrup jar, Mochica Culture, from John Wise; a beautiful figural Quimbayan pin from Colombia, and a pair of Peruvian earstuds, all added to the J. H. Wade Collection. Related, but in silver, is a tiny silver eagle representing the falling sun, bought for the James Albert Ford Memorial Collection. The remaining pieces were in sculpture: an obsidian bird's head, gift of John Wise; and two truly superlative objects, the won derful imperial jade, Mayan, Copan, presented by the ever generous friend, Mrs. R. Henry Norweb, in memory of her aunt, Delia Holden White, and the extraordinary pottery head i26</page><page sequence="9">REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR from Vera Cruz, which came as a gift from Mrs. A. S. Ingalls. Mrs. Norweb also added some very fine pieces to her valued loans in this department. American Indian jewelry was accepted from Mrs. Malcolm L. McBride and John Harris McBride. A fan was given by the Landesman family, in memory of their sister, Dorothy Landes man Felheim. Two silver spoons came from Miss Gertrude Underhill and two Sicilian silver rattles were added to the Milliken Memorial. The Curator of Far Eastern Art returned in the autumn from his tour of service as Chief of the Office of Arts and Monuments Division in Tokyo. The activities of his department were there fore necessarily somewhat curtailed during his absence. To wards the end of the year a stone head from the Lung Men caves was purchased for the J. H. Wade Collection, as were two charming bronze figures, one, Javanese, tenth century, the other, Nepalese, and dating two centuries later. The Near Eastern Department administered by Mr. Hollis as Curator also marked time, but at the end of the year a group of eight very fine Persian and Indian miniatures was bought from the J. H. Wade Fund and the Edward L. Whittemore Fund. These are supplemental pages which help to round out the excellent group the Museum owns, the illuminated miniature being one of the most characteristic expressions of the arts of the Near East. Further purchases for the Wade and Whittemore Funds, respectively, were an exceedingly rare Phoenician silver dish, twelfth century B.C., and a Persian pottery jar of the twelfth century. Miss Gertrude Underhill went on pension as Curator of Textiles Emeritus on April I, after thirty years in the Museum, the greater part of it in the Textile Department. She left a broadly developed department to her successor, Miss Dorothy Shepherd, who assumed the position as Associate Curator on July I. Miss Underhill will be greatly missed, but she was happy in the fact that Miss Shepherd could take over her responsibil ities. The purchases were notable, in particular two Coptic fabrics of silk, sixth century, of a type hitherto unrepresented and tying in splendidly with material from Byzantium in the Decorative Arts Department. These were Wade purchases, as was the unusually large piece, generally attributed to Regens I27</page><page sequence="10">THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART burg, and a beautiful blue silk brocade from Lucca or Venice, of the fifteenth century. A few Bolivian peasant weaves and a group of modern American silks rounded out the purchases. In the gifts there was one of quite exceptional importance, the four-pointed hat, Peruvian, Tiahuanaco, given by John Wise. A chasuble was presented by Walter G. and Alwin W. Littwitz in memory of their father, Max Littwitz, always a generous friend of the Textile Department. Mrs. Antonio DiNardo gave a pair of Venetian slippers. The Classical Department had an exceptional year, with five purchases, each an outstanding one in its field. The first object, a bronze patera handle representing Lasa, Etruscan, third to second century B.C., found in that northern outpost of Greek culture, Kertch, in the Crimea, was acquired for the J. H. Wade Collection, all the rest from the John L. Severance Fund. The first of these is a head of a boy, probably first century, found in the Nile, and coming from an Egyptian collection. The other three pieces were purchases from the Exhibition of Gold and represented the most important classical pieces on the market. One was a Greek chain and pendant in filigree, third century B.C.; the second, a splendid necklace with three pendants, set with a carved aventurine and two rubies, typical of the type of jewelry made in Alexandria when that great city was one of the brilliant centers for Greek jewelry craft; the third piece is fourth to third century B.C., South Italian, an exquisite fibula, with the finest of filigree and granulation technique. The year was marked by two exhibitions of quite extra ordinary importance: the great "Works of Edgar Degas" in February; and the "Exhibition of Gold," which opened at the end of October and carried over into 1948. The remaining exhibitions were of the most varied character. They included "British Contemporary Paintings," circulated by the British Council; "Memorial Gifts from Mrs. Ralph King and Family"; "Designs for Fabrics from Contemporary American Artists," put on with the help of Halle Bros. Co.; the "Third Exhibition of Prints Lent by Members of The Print Club"; "Photographs by Edward Weston"; "Original Drawings for New Yorker Covers"; "Cleveland Builds, Work by Cleveland Architects"; and a memorial exhibition, "Work of Louis Sullivan." A memorial exhibition was held for three Cleveland artists, Alice I28</page><page sequence="11">REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR A. Ayars, Ora Coltman, and Sandor Vago, and as usual in May there was the ever-popular "Exhibition of Work by Cleveland Artists and Craftsmen." An unusual exhibition of Chinese textiles and associated materials from the Museum collections created much interest. Finally, there was the comprehensive exhibition of American paintings, the "La Tausca Art Competi tion," sponsored so generously by the Heller-Deltah Co., Inc. The Department of Musical Arts finished a successful and satisfactory year. The rebuilt McMyler organ functioned all through the year, and the chief feature of the season was the series of concerts played by the great French organist, Andre Marchal. Eight programs of his series of ten were played in 1947. They attracted large audiences of Cleveland music lovers, as well as many musicians from out-of-town. Earlier in the year a chamber music cycle was performed by Henri Temianka, violinist, and Leonard Shure, pianist. They played all the Beethoven sonatas for violin and piano, in three per formances, with great popular and artistic success. There were sonata recitals by Alexander Schneider, violinist, and Ralph Kirkpatrick, harpsichordist; by Emmanuel Vardi, violinist, of New York; by Joseph Knitzer, violinist, of Cleveland. Phillip MacGregor gave a song recital. Chamber music programs were performed by the Walden String Quartet and the Oberlin Woodwind Ensemble. Particularly enjoyable was the perform ance by Putnam Aldrich, harpsichordist, and Alfred Zighera, who played the viola da gamba, the expenses of the concert being graciously met by Mrs. J. D. Cox. Other programs were the impressive Christmas Carol Service, with the Wa-Li-Ro Boy Choir Association under Paul Allen Beymer and the St. Joseph's Greek Catholic Church Choir, directed by Michael Stinich, and the moving performance of Bach's St. Matthew Passion in Severance Hall on Palm Sunday. The result of this rich musical fare was an increase in attendance of nearly o1,000, the total being 26,oo9. The loyal and devoted support of the Musart Society was all important. By their contributions they made possible a program of great variety and extent. Music of such a standard takes its place by right in the quality service given by a great museum. An example of special services which the department performs 129</page><page sequence="12">THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART was the courses by the Curator, as special lecturer at Case Institute of Technology, for classes in musical appreciation. The Educational Department had a busy and useful year. The record of service, as shown by statistics, reveals increased use of Museum facilities in every section of the department. The steady development and increased sense of responsibility of new members of the department supplement the devoted efforts of those under whose hands the work has been wisely guided and developed. It is always sad when someone whose service has been long retires, but it is a tribute to efficiency in that individual that the work which she pioneered goes on and develops. This was Mrs. Ruth Ruggles's last year as head of the Circulating Exhibits Section. Miss Doris Dunlavy and Mr. Joseph Alvarez take up where she left off. But the museum is fortunate in that Mrs. Ruggles will still undertake a part-time job of different character in the same department. The same extremely friendly relations with the Public School System of Cleveland have continued. Coordination between the two organizations stems from the new Superintendent, Mark C. Schinnerer, and is reflected downward. Alfred Howell, Directing Supervisor, Mrs. Grace Z. Langebrake and Bertha K. Budde, Assistant Supervisors, as well as the three teachers assigned to the Museum, Ann V. Horton, Ronald Day, and Dana E. Church, helped in creating a working arrangement which is unique and which has been widely studied and adapted in many other places. The Cleveland Heights Schools and the Shaker Heights System have also worked closely with the Museum. The intelligent and creative way in which they use the facilities the Museum can offer and the generous correlation of their programs with the Museum's mean much. The Museum is thought of as an essential part of their program. Many suburban schools use the Museum, the classes from Orange Township School using the Museum most often. Intelligent use of a school bus has made that possible. Garfield Heights could and would use the Museum more if a bus were regularly avail able. Work with the Catholic School System reflects the enthusiasms of individual teachers rather than any over-all planned program. The Museum would welcome a larger use by them of its service facilities. The Saturday morning classes in the Museum continue with I30</page><page sequence="13">REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR success; the teaching staff, being largely the same, has con tributed much to the smoothness of operation. Their contact with the child is the basis for the happy relation between Museum and pupil and is the true reason for success. The children are at home; they are not inhibited, and in this freedom of attitude the best results are achieved. The classes for specially talented children, chosen through a careful selective system, have long been one of the most important features of the Saturday program. Through the years outstanding talent has been found, has been trained, has been channeled towards the Art School, with scholarship aid from the Museum. The careers of many of the most prominent artists in Cleveland began in the Art Museum, and these special classes have had a major part in that success. A grant from the S. D. and May Wise Charitable Trust of the Jewish Welfare Federation again helped to finance them. The Summer Outdoor Classes have now become one of the features of the teaching year. The position of the Museum in Wade Park, with the beautiful Fine Arts Garden, gives an out door setting for these classes, which they use to the utmost. So popular have they been that it has been necessary to restrict enrollment. This particular service was made possible by the L. E. Holden Fund, with its emphasis on development of the appreciation of nature. Experimental films and film classics have formed the pro grams of the Moving Picture Section. It is regrettable that the sources of supply for films of exceptional character seem to be slow in development. There is a public for the film of quality, but it is still so small that not sufficient films are produced or can be produced economically. Cooperation with institutions of higher learning has been increasing. The Museum has been used more and more defin itively by The Cleveland School of Art. Special lectures bearing on particular subjects have been repeated for the students. The Garden Center has correlated its services with the Museum, and many of the lectures of the Holden series have been suggested by them and jointly sponsored. Western Reserve University, through its new program of appreciation, has used the Museum increasingly. The Curator of Education, as Professor of Art in the University, has taught on the graduate 3'I</page><page sequence="14">THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART level. Mrs. Margaret Marcus has also taught graduate courses as well as courses in Flora Stone Mather College. Thomas Elsner and the Curator of Music have respectively given courses in appreciation of art and music at Case Institute of Technology. Dr. Munro, as Editor of The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, has brought distinction to the Museum by associating it with this important publication, which, in encouraging re search and writing in this field, has provided a forum for scholars throughout the world interested in this subject. The Circulating Exhibits Division carried out an active and thoughtful program. The fact that the long-waited-for station wagon was finally delivered was cause for great thankfulness. It enabled the distribution of exhibitions to be handled with new efficiency and it opened up new possibilities of service over larger fields. This section's service to schools, libraries, and other organizations has been integrated in a most competent way with teaching demands. The Exhibition of the Month, an educational exhibition on different themes, has been most intelligently developed by George Culler. Throughout the year a variety of these small exhibitions was shown: "The Artist, the River, and the Sea," "The Floral Motif in Art," "Textures in Art," and others. Other special activities included adult classes of varied types, all non-vocational in aim; work with club groups, which has steadily developed, several clubs planning yearly programs on a carefully thought-out and developed theme. Special promo tion work has been carried on to interest special groups in particular activities. Among these have been Our Famous Treasures Quiz, sponsored by the Cleveland News, and Dance Experiment, a group of individuals interested in the dance who have worked with Museum material and Museum facilities and who finally produced a most effective program at the opening of the Degas exhibition. A by-product of this was a course in ballet, experimental in character and financed outside of the educational budget. This class was very popular, but conditions outside of the Museum control made it necessary to curtail it. The Library has carried on with skill and ability. It was a year of change, however, because on April I Miss Nell G. Sill, the Librarian, retired on pension after twenty-eight years of 132</page><page sequence="15">REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR invaluable service. She built up the Library on a sound founda tion and left it so that it could be carried on with a minimum of difficulty. That is the greatest tribute possible to efficient administration. Her assistants, Miss Ella Tallman and Miss Charlotte Van der Veer, stepped into the position of Acting Librarian and that of Assistant Librarian, respectively. The Library now has 22,975 books and is being most intelligently developed as a reference library, with particular attention to the fields which are strongly represented in the Museum's collec tions. The Library is being increasingly used, the attendance during the past year having more than doubled. The Library is divided into two sections, the book collection, which is for reference, and the lending collections which are divided into three categories: lantern slides, photographs in black and white, and color reproductions. The lantern slides number 51,845, and 226,889 were circulated. The increasing demand for slides in color is being met, and a large number of the slides added were of this type. It is hoped that the photo graph collection, used extensively now, may be developed more. All of the demands on the department need space and that is becoming increasingly a major problem. There is just not floor space or shelf space sufficient to use efficiently the library material or even to store it properly. The Department of Publicity brings the Museum to the public by means of the Press and a bewildering number of magazines and house organs of varied types. Certainly a reason for the increased attendance can be found in the intelligent and forceful manner in which the special exhibitions, special features, and the new accessions have been presented to the public. The radio programs have been varied and full of interest. The first television program was made, and that field bids fair to develop increasingly. The Photograph Department is a service department re cording the Museum collections, providing the photographs and post cards on sale at the Sales Desk, and making the large number of lantern slides necessary. The Printing Department prints labels, forms of every kind, and programs, and services the material sold at the Sales Desk. These two departments are a part of the Museum that is too little recognized. The Tea Room is an essential, because of the position of the I33</page><page sequence="16">THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART Museum in a public park, far from restaurants. It is invaluable to the staff and to the large numbers of visitors, both adult and children, which really tax its capacity. This steady use is a tribute to its deserved reputation for setting such an excellent table. The Department of Buildings and Grounds has carried on its able handling of the multitudinous demands which it is called upon to handle. Tried and experienced employees have made that possible. Obsolescent installations in lighting have been replaced in various sections. The boilers, long unused, have been removed, and the preliminary work has been started in the Service Building, which will permit the installing of a greatly needed air-conditioning system in the Museum during the coming year. A part of that work has already been started. Recognition must be given to the individuals who as part of the Museum fabric have given their devoted and loyal service to the organization. Several members of the staff have retired this year and others have taken up their tasks. No one's contribu tion should be forgotten, nor is forgotten, in the gradual evolu tion of a great institution. That institution is only as good as its parts, and the willing and cooperative service of the many has made the Museum a warm, friendly, and cheerful place, an active power in the community. 134</page><page sequence="17">REPORT OF THE TREASURER WITH CERTIFICATE OF AUDITORS</page><page sequence="18">THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART REPORT OF THE TREASURER LETTER OF TRANSMISSION OF FINANCIAL REPORT April 23, 1948 The President and Board of Trustees, The Cleveland Museum of Art.
