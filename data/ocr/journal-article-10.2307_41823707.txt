<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Use of Prints in the Hours of Charles ď Angoulême Anne Matthews The Hours of Charles ď Angoulême is a volume of con- siderable importance in the history of fifteenth- century French illustrated manuscript, both for the quality of its illumination and the unusual range of print-connected imagery that its pages incorporate.1 The manuscript - probably executed in the early 1480s and attributed to the Master of Charles d'Angoulême - cannot be specifically connected with surviving commission or payment records, but the presence of Charles d'Angouleme's arms ( d'azur , à trois fleurs de lis d'or au lambei d'argent chargé d'un crois- sant de gueules) on fols gv and 10, as well as the inclu- I would like to thank Professors Robert A.

The manuscript entered the French royal collections with the accession of Charles's son François I in 15 15. The daunting codicological problems posed by the manuscript's damaged condition have made the Angoulême Hours a much-reproduced but little- analysed volume, since erratic foliation and textual omissions and disjunctions permit only the most cautious of reconstructions concerning its original appearance.2 Yet despite the problems inherent in i.

The manuscript's Calendar bas-de-page for May is briefly cited by Hutchison äs evidence of the diffusion of the Housebook Master's work, and W. Bühler mentions the manuscript because of its apparent connections with the engraved alphabet of c. 1460-65 by the Master E.S.4 Blum's article of 191 1 on relationships between early printmakers and French illuminators provides the most extensive discussion to date of the print-related problems presented by this manu- script, although subsequent discoveries suggest the need for considerable revisions of, and additions to, Blum's initial observations.5 The Angoulême Hours contains forty-three ident- ifiable examples of print-derived or print-inspired illuminations. Sixteen are actual engravings by Israel van Meckenem that have been incorporated into the manuscript's illustrative programme by being glued directly onto the vellum pages, then extensively overpainted. The remaining twenty- seven examples of the use of prints in the manuscript involve illuminations which rely in whole or in part on compositional sources drawn from woodcuts and engravings of the period.6 Seventeen illuminations in the manuscript can be related to printed alphabets of the 1460s, and ten others display a clear dependence on, or knowledge of, contemporary Netherlandish and German engravings. The ways in which the Angoulême Hours makes use of prints vary considerably. It contains a number of illuminations which betray exceedingly close dependence on particular fifteenth-century prints, as when one compares the drypoint from the circle of the Master bxg, the Combat of Wild Men on Horseback , with the Angoulême Hours' Calendar page for May (figs. 2 and 3). In some other cases the Angoulême Hours illuminator has chosen to depart in one or more ways from his visual source - usually by means of a reinterpretation or embellishment of content - as in the case of the III- Assorted Lovers for the month of September , inspired by a print of van Meckenem (figs. 4 and 5). The illuminator's methods of employing woodcut and engraved alphabets display a number of minor but arresting discrepancies between the printed models and their reinterpretation in Angoulême Hours miniatures. Three types of Calendar initials are found in the manuscript : those for June , October and December are prismatic KLs , painted in two shades of pink on a black ground and decorated with five- petalled blue flowers. The K initials for May, July , September and November are six- and seven-line 3. The incorporation of woodcuts and engravings in illuminated manuscripts of the later fifteenth century (a phenomenon apparently more common, and certainly more thoroughly documented in Germany and the Netherlands than in France) has been the subject of increased attention in the liter- ature in recent years, although the topic has by no means been exhausted, or even comprehensively analysed. Multiple examples are cited in one of the most useful monographs to touch on this problem, Sandra Hindman and James Douglas Farquhar, Pen to Press: Illustrated Manuscripts and Printed Books in the First Century of Printing , College Park, Maryland 1977.

Apart from visual evidence such as that contained in PBN lat. 873 and PBN lat. 11 73, no firm documentation appears to exist concerning dissemination of German and Netherlandish prints, particularly in France, nor has evidence on the subject been discovered to date concerning the Poitou- Angoumois region in particular, though the presence of at least three German printers in Lyons (M. Huss, J. Schnabeller and J. Trechsel) after c. 1475-80 should be noted (S. C. Cock- erell, Some German Woodcuts of the Fifteenth Century , London &gt;897. P- 34)- 5. A .

Precisely how the artist of PBN lat. 1 1 73 copied any of the prints discussed here is not known. It is a question of particu- lar interest in the case of those apparently print-dependent compositions, such as PBN lat. 1173's Judgment of Solomon (figs. 10 and 11) in which the Testardian interpretation of the printed image is both slightly altered in detail, and redu- ced in size, from the presumed print original. James D. Farqu- har's Pen to Press chapter, 'The manuscript as book,' provides a useful reconstruction of fifteenth-century techniques for image-transference in illumination, as well as discussing workshop practices of the period for reduction or enlargement of pictorial models (Hindman and Farquhar, Pen to Press , pp. 83-85).

The initial for May presents a standing woman, left arm outstretched, whose mid-section is gnawed by a two-footed, bat-winged dragon. July's K is composed of two soberly-dressed women. The younger one kneels, while the other stands directly behind, placing one hand on her com- panion's forehead and the other on her breast. The lower stroke of July's ' K is formed by a pruned branch. For September , a woman sternly faces a large serpent (see fig. 4). On the November Calendar page, a standing woman and a lion form the upright of the K , while pruned branches again complete the let- ter form. No print sources have been discovered for either type of initial described. The K initials for January and February , however, suggest that the illuminator of the Angoulême Hours was familiar with a particular woodcut Alphabet series which is generally agreed to be of Netherlandish origin and is known as the Grotesque Alphabet of 1464. Two sets are in the British Library : the first (formerly in the collection of Dyson Perrins) is complete, the second - reproduced and discussed by Dodgson7 - is lacking the S and contains only fragmentary impressions of A, B , T and V. A slightly later engraved copy of the 1464 Alphabet by the Master of the Banderoles is also known, as is a third woodcut Alphabet in Basel (Sehr. 1999) that may, as Hind suggests, be another set of impressions from the blocks that produced the two London series.8 Minor omissions or substitutions of detail, as well as an evident willingness to combine or conflate printed sources, characterize the illuminator's adap- tations of elements from all three Alphabets in the Angoulême Hours. For instance, the upright of the anthropomorphic K for January is formed by a stand- ing woman with one hand on the head of a kneeling man. Both figures closely correspond to the London, Basel and Banderole As, except for the omission of the garland held by the woman in the printed proto- types. As is true of print-related work throughout PBN lat. 1 1 73, a number of details, particularly those involving clothing and facial expressions, have been considerably refined in order to produce, in the pain- ted Ks, more fluent and sophisticated interpretations of the comparatively rudimentary printed originals. The manuscript's February K is composed of two acrobatic peasants and a standing woman who examines the open mouth of her kneeling male com- panion. While the paired man and woman appear closest to the K of the Banderoles Alphabet, particu- larly in the positioning of the scroll held by the man, the peasants' details of expression and dress are not closely akin to the peasants in the Banderoles exam- ple. They do, however, strongly recall the peasant figures in the Grotesque Alphabet of 1464, thus suggest- ing that the illuminator had access to a number of early printed Alphabets. This possibility is reinforced by the manuscript's foL 52, a full-page illumination devoted to the open- ing words of Gabriel's greeting to the Virgin : AVE MARIA GRACIA PLE[NA]. The anthropo- morphic letter-forms employed to spell out the angelic salutation are drawn from several sources: the Master E.S. engraved Alphabet, the woodcut Grotesque Alphabet of 1464, the Basel woodcut Alphabet, and the engraved Banderoles series. In addition, certain letters of the AVE MARIA page, although seemingly based on, or related to the four major alphabets cited above, have been sufficiently modified so as to comprise letter-forms that are in part dependent on print sources, in part products of the illuminator's imagination.9 Four of the twelve Calendar bas-de-pages in the 7.

A few Calendar scenes, for instance, suggest direct or indirect knowledge of the Housebook Master and/or his putative follower, the Master bxg, through whose engravings a number of lost Housebook Master designs may have been transmitted. Because the two lovers seated in a bower in the April bas- de-page (figs. 6 and 7) are positioned in reverse to the figures in the Housebook Master's drypoint of this subject (L.80), the Angoulême Hours scene is more probably based on one or both of the two known reverse copies of this Housebook Master print which were executed c. 1480-90 by Master bxg (L.32) and Israel van Meckenem (L. 493). 10 Certain differences exist between the manuscript's scenes and all known print versions. Not only is the dress of both 5. Israel van Meckenem, III- Assorted Lovers , engraving, 147 X 115 mm (Washington, National Gallery of Art). September figures slightly simplified in the Angoulême Hours , but in order to transfer successfully the lovers' bower from a vertical print to a horizontal bas-de-page illumination, the artist has extended and elaborated the setting for April through the addition of a rose- covered wicker fence, a table and a hedge-like bench. The manuscript's May bas-de-page depicts the Com- bat of Two Wild Men on Horseback (see figs. 2 and 3) and, as previously mentioned, is based on the House- book Master's drypoint of that subject (L.,1,53; L.,11,56). The manuscript version differs from both the original and the reversed copy in its elimination of the frolicking dog and in the addition of a well- defined background of rocks, trees and sky. August in the Angoulême Hours (fig. 8) introduces a peasant pushing a wheelbarrow in which sits an elderly woman holding a pitchfork, flail and flask. The source of this vignette appears to be an engrav- ing by Master bxg (L.106, fig. 9), which is thought to reflect a lost work by the Housebook Master. While the illuminator of the Angoulême Hours follows the print source in all details of composition, the summarily-indicated outdoor setting of the print is altered in the manuscript to include a threshing floor furnished with red crazy-paving. The manuscript's substitution of ordinary harvest implements for the forked branch carried by the woman in the Master bxg print is underlined by the inclusion of three sheaves of wheat at right, emphasizing the scene's function as a harvest vignette in the Calendar's Labours of the Month sequence. The strong element of farce in the printed source is considerably muted in the manuscript version, and the degree of facial caricature reduced. The artist of the Hours of Charles ď Angoulême also seems to have been aware of the work of the Master FVB. The precise identity and origins of this Netherlandish printmaker (possibly Frans van Brugge) are still uncertain, but his period of activity appears to have included the last quarter of the fifteenth century. The Master FVB's Judgment of Solomon (L.VII,i 16.2, fig. 1 1) provides the composi- tional basis for the full-page illumination of that subject which introduces the Angoulême Hours' 'Penitential Psalms' (fig. 10). The manuscript's Judgment is a somewhat reduced version of the FVB print, measuring 211 by 156 mm, as opposed to the 261 by 220 mm of the original engraving. Although 10.

Calendar page for April from the Hours of Charles ďAngouléme showing Lovers in a Bower (Paris, Bibliothèque Nation- ale, PBN lat 1 173,/oZ. $r.). a slight lowering of the viewpoint is noticeable in the manuscript's image, it retains the overall layout of the Master FVB's throne-room. A number of minor modifications can be seen when comparing indi- vidual faces, costume motifs and details of architec- ture and drapery in the two works : for instance, the number of steps to the seat of judgment has been reduced in the manuscript, just as the windows on Solomon's right have been elongated, and the pat- tern of the floor tiles changed. The Book of Hours also slightly reduces the number of bystanders at the left of the throne, and incorporates a figure of the aged King David in the window. The work of another Netherlandish printmaker, Master IAM of Zwolle, is also reflected in the Angoulême Hours (figs. 12 and 13). Master IAM's Battle of Two Men with a Centaur (L.230) has clearly inspired the Centaur Battle scene that introduces the manuscript's 'Office of the Dead'.11 The figures in the Centaur miniature do not seem to have been copied or traced from an actual impression of the IAM print, since the Paris illumination is smaller than the IAM image (measuring 200 by 148 mm as compared with the print's 157 by 222 mm). The two warriors and the centaur in the miniature, while bor- rowed with care from the IAM engraving, have also been provided by the illuminator with an elaborate 7.

The independently-devised setting, and the inclusion of new figures in and around the central group, further camouflage the fact that three of the scene's six occupants are based on a printed model. Finally, the Angoulême Hours contains sixteen engravings by Israel van Meckenem, all of which are glued directly onto the manuscript's vellum leaves and significantly altered by overpainting and other additions.12 Only the September Calendar scene (see fig. 4) of an old man and young girl appears to be an example of an illumination whose compositional source is a Meckenem print, in this case the House- book Master-inspired engraving of III- Assorted Lovers (L.489, see fig. 5). The Angoulême Hours' interpreta- tion of the van Meckenem engraving introduces a more detailed setting for the two waist-length figures and adds a number of elements not present in the van Meckenem or Housebook Master sources. The implications of these additions are not entirely clear. The woman in the Angoulême Hours is given a vine il.

His right arm embraces a bag that contains coins in the print but round golden fruits in the manuscript scene. The Angoulême Hours contains a number of over- painted prints by van Meckenem. The full-page Nativity of fol. 1 appears to be an overpainted copy of van Meckenem's reversed version (L.23, 1 54 x 1 56 mm) of Schongauer's Nativity , which is usually dated c. 1480-81 (L.4). PBN lat.ii73's impression of the van Meckenem Nativity has been pasted to the central portion of the page, and the ground and sky areas have been extended above and below the edges of the engraving by means of paper additions, which are also overpainted. The IM signature in the plate is faintly visible directly below the figure of the Virgin. Her halo has been elimin- ated through overpainting, and her draperies simpli- fied, just as the supports of the stable roof have been altered, and the structure's rear wall lightened. A tree is added to the background as well, and the figure of the shepherd, absent in the FVB version and only briefly indicated by van Meckenem, is more strongly emphasized in the Angoulême Hours scene. The tondo on fol. jv offers one of this prayerbook's most elaborate adaptations from a print (figs. 14, 15). The circular central portion of fol. yv's decora- tion is* an impression of Israel van Meckenem's slightly altered reversed copy (L.361 ) of the so-called Communion Tondo by the Master E.S. of c. 1460 (L. 149). The van Meckenem engraving, which in its original form has a diameter of 1 78 mm, has been considerably trimmed on the left and right in order to conform to the dimensions of the page in PBN lat. 1 1 73 (211 by 156 mm). Moreover, the artist of the Angoulême Hours has extensively modified the con- tent of the Meckenem print through overpainting. A scene of the Blessing Christ in Majesty, seated on a tapestry-draped throne and surrounded by seven angels, has been substituted in the central roundel for the St John the Baptist in the Wilderness employed by E.S. and van Meckenem, yet the eight surrounding medallions of the Church Doctors and Evangelist symbols remain common to all three ver- sions. The outer, spandrel-like portions of fol. 7 z;, to which the pasted-in print does not extend, have nevertheless been carefully painted by the Angoulême Hours illuminator in order to match, as closely as possible, the style and character of the printed tondo. Four further roundels are introduced as well, each housing a waist-length male figure holding a scroll ; these may have been intended as prophets, but the scroll inscriptions are too rubbed to ensure an accu- rate identification. Finally, the painted page corners are integrated with the overpainted engraving through the illuminator's imaginative elaboration of the vine, floral and acanthus motifs which, in the original print, stop abruptly at the single engraved line marking the tondo's circumference. In PBN lat. 1 1 73, these plant motifs are considerably extended to unify further the composition and to disguise the point of transition between print and illumination. The circular engraving of St George (fol. 530), which introduces the prayerbook's 'Suffrages' sec- tion, represents a less complex method of incorporat- ing a print into an illuminated manuscript. Like the tondo just discussed, van Meckenem's St George engraving (L.344), measuring 170 mm in diameter, has been substantially trimmed at left and right in order to suit the smaller page of the Book of Hours. The overpainting of the St George is noticeably lighter than the richly-coloured matt surface of fol. yv and more resembles the wash-like technique employed in the manuscript's twelve Passion scenes, which repre- sent the final use of van Meckenem's engravings in the Angoulême Hours. The haphazard assembly and irregular gatherings of the manuscript make it diffi- cult to determine whether these engravings were originally intended to be integrated into the lengthy Passion text that concludes the volume, or whether they were substituted at some later point for a series of illuminations that may have been planned but not executed. The engravings by van Meckenem presently included, with the exception of the Bearing of the Cross (fol. 940), do not appear to have been significantly trimmed, since the platemarks are visible in most cases. One print in the series, the Lamentation (fol. 105z/), is almost completely detached from its vellum support. On the reverse is visible, in ink, the number viii in what appears to be a fifteenth-century hand, although the Lamentation is ninth in the Passion series as it now exists in PBN lat. 1 173. What conclusions can be reached concerning the uses of printed materials in the Angoulême Hours ? Cer- tainly, the previously unsuspected range of print sources in the manuscript is in itself noteworthy. Identification of eight distinct print sources under- lines the ready, even eager, acceptance of such out- side material by the Angoulême Hours illuminator. In addition, distinct patterns of print-interest by the artist of PBN lat. 1 1 73 can begin to be discerned once his sources have been identified.

Alphabet series. A step beyond this literal approach occurs when figure groups talcen from prints ( Death and the Centaur , May's Lovers) are placed in new and complex settings independently developed by the Angoulême Hours illuminator. However, the most revealing interpolations of prints may be the actual overpain- ted engravings found throughout the volume, since PBN lat. 1 1 73 appears to present conscious and con- sistent choices by the artist concerning which ele- ments of actual impressions are to be retained and which will be disguised or modified by overpainting.</page><page sequence="14">THE 'HOURS OF CHARLES D'ANGOULÊME' 17 15. Reversed copy by Israel van Meckenem after the Master E.S., Communion Tondo , engraving, 178 mm diameter (Vienna, Graphische Sammlung Albertina). The engravings pasted into the manuscript seem to have been chiefly valued as a means of freeing the illuminator from tedious groundwork, giving him a useful starting-point for elaboration and invention. The artist shows as few compunctions about cut- ting into or physically extending his prints to suit the manuscript's needs as he does toward the often rad- ical overpainting to which such prints are subjected. The Tondo (fig. 14) is a good example of this approach. It is not only cut away from its surround- ing field and pasted onto the vellum page but heavily overpainted as well. Its content and organization (already modified in this van Meckenem reverse copy of the E.S. original) inspire such extensive addi-</page><page sequence="15">1 8 THE 'HOURS OF CHARLES D'ANGOULÊME' tions by the artist of PBN lat. 1 1 73 that only the inter- locking circles and foliage designs of the original are recognizably retained. In the Tondo , as with other Angoulême Hours engravings such as the Nativity , the final product not only becomes a freely-rendered variation by the illuminator on a theme supplied by some contemporary printmaker, but becomes so by the mingling of three art forms : printmaking, illumi- nation and collage. The sixteen van Meckenem Pas- sion engravings, on the other hand, like the decorative rinceaux of fols. 160 and 260, are not treated as independent fantasias but are employed in a more sober and literal vein. One suspects the illuminator may have been drawn to them on grounds of utility, since as a ready-made series for Passion illustration they are ideal, requiring, and receiving little modification prior to their inclusion in the Angoulême Hours. The overpainting is paler and thinner here than in other prints elsewhere in the volume, such as the Tondo or the FVB Nativity , and the van Meckenem monograms, camouflaged on other van Meckenem prints elsewhere in the Hours , are allowed to show through, while few if any por- tions of the Passion compositions are eliminated or altered. These observations on the use of printed materials in the Angoulême Hours raise more questions than they answer, particularly in relation to the need for a greater understanding of interactions between prints and illumination in the later fifteenth century. The willingness to incorporate prints, and material drawn from prints, that makes this prayerbook so noteworthy, not only encourages speculation about the dispersal of German and Netherlandish engrav- ings and woodcuts in France, but also underlines the somewhat anomalous standing of the Angoulême Hours among manuscripts of its day. No other exam- ple from the period is known in which original illumi- nation, overpainted prints and illuminated images based on printed sources intermingle with such freedom. This degree of artistic innovation is par- ticularly interesting given the manuscript's presumed patron, Charles d'Angoulême, son and great-grandson of royal bibliophiles. As Count of Angoulême, he is recorded as both a collector of manuscripts13 and as an enthusiastic purchaser of the luxury editions produced by the early Parisian printer Antoine Vérard who, by 1490, was making twice-yearly journeys to the Angoulême court at Cognac in Angoumois in order to supply his royal client with books printed on vellum and supplied with hand-coloured and gilded decoration.14 If Vérard, as Hindman notes,15 is the only luxury hybrid printer of the period who managed to nego- tiate successfully the changing world of the illumin- ated book, then the artist of the Angoulême Hours is the sole known instance of a parallel attempt by an illuminator to bridge the technical and aesthetic gap between the old and new worlds of book production in fifteenth-century France - an attempt of particu- lar interest given that the illuminator and printer in question were working for the same patron at approximately the same time. The unparalleled breadth and eclecticism of the print sources which can be reconstructed for the Angoulême Hours , moreover, suggest that either the volume's patron, or the illuminator, or both, may have entertained a considerably more active and comprehensive interest in the acquisition of con- temporary prints that has been previously thought the norm for this period.16 So little is, of course, known about the fifteenth-century dissemination and acquisition of woodcuts and engravings that the issue must remain speculative. But so clear a body of evidence of one illuminator's unusually high level of print-awareness, as manifested in the decoration of PBN lat. 1 1 73, lends questions about the role of illuminator as independent and discerning print- collector considerable new urgency. 13.

Another example of an illumination with a clear composi- tional print source is the Samson marginal vignette in a manu- script attributed to the artist of the Angoulême Hours, fol. 1090. of a Missal for the use of Poitiers in the Bibliothèque Nationale (PBN lat.873). For a description of the Missal, see V. Leroquais, Les Sacramentales et les missels manuscrits des biblio- thèques de France , Paris 1924, III, pp. 186-88.
