<plain_text><page sequence="1">Arturo Romano Pacheco (1921 - 2015) Riverside (Vera Tiesler): Mexican Inah Emeritus Professor Arturo Romano Pacheco passed away on March 16 of 2015 at the age of 93. His prolific work and teaching has advanced and shaped the field of physical anthropology for over half a century in Mexico and beyond. During the 1 940s, Romano received training in physical anthropologist at the Mexican Enah and Unam, as well as 33 mexicon • Vol. XXXVII • April 2015</page><page sequence="2">at the Carnegie Institution, US. Right from the beginning of his long academic career, Romano specialized in paleoan- thropology and osteology and showed a profound academic interest in joint, interdisciplinary research of archaeologi- cally retrieved human remains from different eras and parts of Mesoamerica. He participated actively in archaeological field projects at Tlatilco, Tamuín, El Peñón, Azcapotzalco, and the Temple of San Jerónimo, among many others. An- other milestones in Romano's research track was his study of the remains of Maya ruler Janaab' Pakal, conducted as part of a project led by Alberto Ruz Llhullier at the site of Palenque during the 1950s. Four decades later, he returned to Palenque to participate in a revision of the original study on Janaab 'Pakal and to examine the physical remains of the the socalled "Red Queen", a female royal discovered next to the Temple of the Inscriptions and who is believed to have been Pakal 's wife and mother of his followers to the thrown during life. Specialized in craniometry, Romano showed an acute in- terest in cultural cranial modifications since the 1960s and his trailblazing work and teachings have since dominated the an- thropological study on prehispanic head shaping practices in Mesoamerica and specifically in Mexico. In this field, he laid most of the methodological groundwork for classifying arti- ficially shaped skulls and established sustained associations between the anthropomorphic rendering of Mesoamerican deities and the head looks among Mesoamerican peoples. Romano's engagement in Mexian criminalistics pro- moted and formalized forensic anthropology in the country and laid down groundwork for using photography as a means to personal identification. This line of his research was also instrumental in his own physical identifications of several pivotal figures in Mexican history, such as Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, Father Eusebio Francisco Kino, and Francisco Xavier Clavijero. During his long reknown career, Romano also played an active role in Mexican institutional development. Over the years, he directed the Inah Prehistory Department, Inah's Department of Physical Anthropology and the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City. Romano was also a founding member of the Mexican National Academy of Criminalistics and the National System of Researchers (Co- nacyt). In 201 1 , he was the recipient of the Medal "Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz", honoring his outstanding contributions to academics and teaching. 34 Photo: Andrea Cucina, 2011</page></plain_text>
