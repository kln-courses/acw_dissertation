For his understanding of the Hawaiian religion, Sahlins relied heavily on Valerio Valeri's Kingship and Sacrifice (I985). John Charlot, a religion professor at the University of Hawaii, authored a lengthy critique of that work, but his piece and Valeri's even longer and more detailed rebuttal only made it onto the pages of Pacific Studies. If I encountered some of Obeyesekere's generic critical characterizations of "scholars" in a student essay, I would demand substantiation and closer attention to the sources.

(Albuquerque: Uni- versity of New Mexico Press, I99z. 299 pp., introduction, illustrations, epilogue, index. $32.50 cloth.) Anthony F. Aveni, Colgate University What truth resides in the universe around us? A modern cosmologist would tell you that what happens in the physical world has no real bearing on the human condition. Fifteen billion years ago all was created in an instant in an accidental cataclysmic flash. Mathematical laws have gov- erned the evolutionary outcome ever since. Protectors and transmitters of the esoteric knowledge that deals with this purposeless creation and its aftermath, modern cosmologists appeal to the sky visions of empirical astronomy to back up their story. Magnifying the Great Nebula in Orion through a telescope, astronomers tell us we can witness the very act of stars in the making. The Pleiades represent an earlier stage on the evolutionary ladder of the stars, while the constellations of Corona Borealis or Ursa Major typify a still-older stage of cosmic existence. While astronomers probe the sky, geologists, employing their own specialized tools and tech- niques, dig into the earth. What they find further embellishes progressive themes of the scientific creation story. Just as sky created earth, our planet gave rise to animate beings. At the top of life's pyramid, the result of a series of chance occurrences in a great cosmic crapshoot, rational homo sapiens has emerged. Today's sky and earth specialists offer us a creation story that is senseless in human terms, with a precisely timed big-bang beginning and an uneasy, unpredictable finish. Suppose, instead, you asked a Cahuilla elder, a Tsimshian-trained sky- watcher, and a Lakota storyteller, all keepers of esoteric cosmic knowledge in their respective cultures, the same question. What would their answers 3z7</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews be? Earth and Sky collects the perceptions of these people and their equiva- lents from a dozen more Native American cultures in seventeen essays, some more descriptive and less analytical than others. Written by astrono- mers, historians, anthropologists, archaeologists, and historians of reli- gion, the book describes how these ethnoastronomers, who have worked with native North American people from Seneca and Alabama in the east, to Pawnee and Algonkian in the midwest, to Zuni and Simloki in the west, discover cosmic thought systems that still function almost in defiance of Western precepts. Their texts are verbal narrative, star-patterned mnemon- ics, sand paintings, and the structure of the tipi. Their truths lie not in the events portrayed but in the human-centered meaning behind them. The editors, one an astronomer and the other an anthropologist, begin this tightly integrated reader (excellent for undergraduate classroom use) with an illustrated, obligatory sky primer and conclude with an insightful syn- thesis that expands on the relationship between ethnoastronomy and its ancient multidisciplinary sister, archaeoastronomy. Native American universes join sky and earth together. For the Navajo earth-sky is an anthropomorphic creative couple, not inanimate matter segmented among unrelated specialties. For the Seneca it consists of tiers of being, not layers of sediment or domains of inert elements on crystalline spheres. Unlike our own, all their creation stories have a human-centered purpose. The Mescalero Apache's sun is created so that people can see, and for the Seneca the sounds of birds are there for people to hear. When they appear, the constellations evoke stories about lifeways. For example, the Pleiades (the Seven Stars) and Corona Borealis (the Council of Chiefs) are central to the Skidi Pawnee cosmovision because of their placement oppo- site one another in the sky, the closely gathered nature of their component stars, and the fact that they are visible through the smokehole of the lodge, the instrument through which to view the heavens. All these reasons are symbolic of tribal unity. Also embryonic in its origin, the Orion Nebula becomes Clot-of-Blood for the Blackfeet. Created out of an aborted fetus, like so many heroes in other native North American creation myths en- countered in the text, he is the embodiment of life's force when he wages a great cosmic battle against death. In Lakota stellar theology this same area of the winter sky becomes a selfish chief's hand, torn out of its socket by the gods as punishment for having tried to interfere with the cosmic cycle. Like the timed appearance of sky phenomena that call basic questions to mind about life processes, it is no accident that Orion disappears from the sky just when fertility is about to become lost from the landscape. Other timing mechanisms that link skyscape and landscape are seen in the way Ajumani runners, in order to acquire power, race the shadows of the holy mountains in the directions of sacred springs at solstice and 3z8</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews equinox; and in lineal markings drawn on the ground (they look just like the lines of Nazca, Peru) that point to solstitial events. These are connected to the timing of Pima saguaro wine ceremonies and may be of ancient origin. Some native earth-sky creation stories turn out to be as progressive as our own. Zuni Morning and Evening Star hero twins, close parallels to the twins in the Mayan Popol Vuh, make people human by bringing them out of darkness into light, from ignorance to knowledge. Likewise, things were wrong with the earth before Nanabush, the Ojibway creator- trickster, improved upon them. And, there is a failed creation twin among the Cahuilla. This craft of human-centered creation seems to improve with repeated trials in the Native American world view, a stark contrast with the more pessimistic downhill slide of history told in ancient Greek mythology. Yet the "earthandsky" realm is a fragile place, and we are in it for the purpose of mediating, of helping to create balance and harmony. Unlike the dome over our indifferent contemporary heads, blotted from view by technology and the urban condition, the sky is known and loved. It is present in prac- tically every facet of daily life, even in the home, where creation begins. The Navajo hooghan is more than a mere dwelling place. It is a built struc- ture that personifies sky deities, and is mapped out on sand paintings that show its doorway opening to the east and its central fire pivoting about Polaris. For the neighboring Zuni the looked-for culmination of the Pleia- des over the opening in the roof of a kiva signals the commencement of sacred ceremonies. We can understand why ethnoastronomy is still practiced by the sur- viving Maya of Central America and the Quechua-speaking people of the high Andes; however, it is surprising that wonderful traditional stories such as the ones told in this rich collection still survive among the de- teriorating native cultures to the north. Earth and Sky demonstrates the necessity to encourage these people to tell their own stories about the great template in the heavens that serves as the basis for social, political, and moral order. Perhaps by understanding the reasons behind their almost forgotten creation stories, we may one day come to articulate a human purpose for our own.
