In his analysis, Comparini identifies three types of prayer - prayer of petition, prayer without petition, and anti-prayer - used by Caproni in order to establish a new dialogue with the Transcendence; this form is the Theomachy, the poetic fight of the Self against God. Finally, by comment- ing on II muro della terra, the author defines the influence of Jaspers' Exis- tentialism on Caproni, his religious thought, and the renewed relation between poetry and religion as a means to describe human beings' exist- ence and suffering. Keywords: Giorgio Caproni, Karl Jaspers, poetry, existentialism, secular religion, religiosity. Die Botschaft hör ich wohl, allein, mir fehlt der Glaube, wenn man das interpretiert. Goethe, Faust Adorno's barbaric" famous (34), sentence, can be used "to write to introduce poetry after the Auschwitz concept of is barbaric" (34), can be used to introduce the concept of Theomachy: even when silence seems to be the only means that remains for human beings to express their own suffering, poetry resists, and finds a new form - Theomachy - to describe human existence. The Theomachy does not have the typical structure of a religious poem. It does not conserve elements like testamentary versification or the use of symbols, metaphors, and allegories; rather, it preserves the dialectic function, shared by both poetry and prayer, that has as interlocutor a personal Thou, claimed through invoca- tions, apostrophes, imperatives, and questions addressed to Him. Therefore, prayer encounters in poetry a new connection with the metaphysical sphere in a time of secularization, by using the lan- ITALICA • Volume 92 • No. 1 • Spring 2015 83</page><page sequence="2">Alberto Comparir» guage of a Thou-seeker who has failed to find God. However, de- spite this negative dialectic, poets cannot stop calling Him, waiting for an answer bearer of safeness. As we can clearly understand, this encounter is a fight between the lyrical-Self, a new Prometheus, who seeks answers for his point- less pain, and God. But the fight, at any rate, is necessary for the rebirth of both poetry and prayer in a secular world, and "la sola vera alleanza valida che la preghiera possa stipulare è quella con la poesia" (Piovani 279). In this sense, the complex process of secu- larization in Western society in the last century has provoked a metamorphosis of religion.2 The Age in which we live is not a-reli- gious, but differently religious; its art, inspired by a secular and Promethean motive, has acquired a new ontological dimension. Nowadays, in fact, it is "part of the ontological order itself" and "poetry passes for prayer" (Lévinas 17). The Lithuanian philoso- pher implies that poetry preserves an implicit religious meaning, in which is to be found the relation between poetry and prayer. The bond with 7toír|aiç allows prayer to exist even in a secular time, when the existence of Thou is made possible by the lay faith of the Self, whose ontological realization is achieved in the encoun- ter with Him. In the second half of the twentieth century, poetry posed again the radical question: why does the right man suffer? After the Sec- ond World War, several poets, such as André Frénaud, Paul Celan, and Giorgio Caproni tried to answer this question through an en- counter between Self and Thou that stands at the center of their thought. By doing that, all of them underscored the secular change of religious epistemology, registering a recovery, conflicted and not harmonic, of the weaving between poetry and prayer. Moreover, these authors share the idea of poetic language as essentially dia- logical (or self-dialogical), as a meaningful form of contact between Self and Thou. Although a comparative reading of the stylistic, rhetorical, and thematic elements that bind and unbind the literary and existen- tial experiences of these important poets would be interesting, in this essay I want to stress the way in which Caproni alone changed the Italian poetic tradition in the pursuit of God. Unlike the Italian poets of the first half of the twentieth century, such as Eugenio Montale,3 who tried to meet the divine in an immanent-transcen- dent figure (the myth, and the metaphysical transfiguration, of Clizia-Iride), Caproni tried to turn directly to an invisible God, ac- 84</page><page sequence="3">Giorgio Caproni, Il muro della terra cording to the postulates and dynamics of the Old Testament. Al- though his poetry is full of intermediaries, characters, and perso- nae, his voice is the one that has re-proposed the radical question- ing of Job. In order to analyze this critical point, that is at the same time theological and philosophical, it is necessary to define Caproni's religion and the different types of prayer present in the poem pub- lished in 1975; we will then comment on a few paradigmatic texts that demonstrate this crucial connection between poetry and prayer. Through the long critical history of Caproni's religious thought,4 we can easily identify three categories that Caproni's best inter- preters have applied to his thought: negative theology (Squarotti 113, Testa 82), negative religiosity (Surdich 96), and poetic a-theol- ogy (Agamben 92, Gioanola 287). s Although the range of these el- ements is quite relatively broad, within this crucible of philosophy and hermeneutics it is possible to identify two ways of reading Caproni's religion. On the one hand, the idea of knowledge and experience of God per via negationis is evidently a suggestion of how to read and to interpret the absence and the death of the Di- vine in Caproni's poetry. By the means of negatio, poetry, religios- ity, and theology unify themselves in the sign of nothingness; and the death of God seems to be universal and necessary condition. On the other hand, poetic a-theology offers a hermeneutical tool to understand the function of both philosophical and theological elements in the genesis of Caproni's poetry. Behind the disappear- ance of God, there is the loss of the ontology of Transcendence, which becomes an empty transcendentality where the Self is alone in a deontological space without object.6 Caproni's letters and interviews, however, state a position that is quite different from both negative religiosity-theology and po- etic atheism. In a letter to Luigi Surdich (7 March 1984), the poet affirms that "decisamente, non credo in nessuna religione o chiesa istituzionalizzata e in nessun Dio bon père nourricier" (Caproni 1998: 1672). 7 Then, in the famous radio interview "Antologia" (17 Janu- ary 1988), published in the volume Era così bello parlare, he reas- serts that the "assenza di Dio... non vuol dire ateismo" and that He is not the "dio istituzionalizzato dalle varie religioni" (113). Simi- larly, in II muro dello stoicismo, he gives a stronger definition of his idea of religion: Ciò che è certo è che non credo a nessuna religione istituzionalizzata e a nessun Dio che se fino a un certo punto può esser valido in un sistema 85</page><page sequence="4">Alberto Comparirli tolemaico, già non lo è più in un sistema copernicano. E non si continui a chiedermi se sono un ateo o un credente, definizioni che mi ripugnano anche perché l'una vale l'altra, in quanto i due atteggiamenti si identificano nell'eguale mancanza di prova che hanno entrambi, giacché se l'ateo "crede" alla non esistenza di Dio, è, in questo suo stesso piano, identico a chi non crede. (Caproni 1990: 94) The religious demand posed by the poet expresses an idea that is completely different from the definition of atheism and negative theology proposed by literary criticism, and it allows a new herme- neutical perspective, linked to German Existentialism.8 Daniela Baroncini, in Caproni e la poesia del nulla (2002), under- lines the influence of German (Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Heidegger) and French (Sartre, Camus) Existentialism in Caproni's poems. She observes how anxiety, the dialectic between being and nothingness, and the death of God constitute the philosophical subtext of Caproni's poetry (147-181). Nevertheless, the poet's state- ments shift our attention to the metaphysical aspect of Existential- ism and in particular to the figure of Karl Jaspers,9 whose theory is based on the rejection of both Sartre and Heidegger's ontological system of metaphysics. Jaspers considered it a cage that restricts the dimension of Being to objectivity by ignoring the subjective transcendent dimension of Being. By refusing the previous model, he proposed a new form of Transcendence and a new dialogue with the Divine, inasmuch as human subjectivity opens itself to the Other without intellectualism, dogmatism, and objective categories that would risk reducing human freedom in front of Transcendence. In other words, Jaspers' task was to convert the religious elements of religion into an account of human possibilities and freedom, in order to allow a life by faith according to their personal interpreta- tion. If considering Jaspers' positions (the necessity of a religious ele- ment, the rejection both of religious structures and an ontological system of metaphysics), we notice an interesting similarity to Caproni's views: neither he nor the Italian poet believed in an in- stitutionalized God or in structured religions, and both refused the idea that the absence of God meant atheism. Moreover, in Vernunft und Existenz (1935), Jaspers argued that Vernunft and Existenz are the poles of our being, whose phenomenology is determined by reciprocal interaction; and Vernunft exists as Existenz in front of Transzendenz. As we will see, this Jaspersian triad constitutes a pos- sible philosophical subtext of Caproni's metaphysical investigation. 86</page><page sequence="5">Giorgio Caproni, Il muro della terra But there is another factor that we need to take into account before defining Jaspers' being in order to specify Caproni's religios- ity - the function of Transzendenz in human Existenz : Reason is potential Existenz which in its thinking is continually directed upon an other, upon the Being which we are not, upon the world, and upon Transcendence. What these are then becomes communicable and, therewith, being-for-us, but in the formality through which they authen- tically touch Existenz (Jaspers 92). According to Jaspers, Vernunft moves towards Transzendenz, mak- ing our Existenz true and real; and by doing that, the pursuit of the Sense becomes the factor that gives us the perception of ourselves in an ontological dimension deeply bound to the sphere of Transzendenz. Jaspers' theoretical structure and definition of being find exten- sion in Caproni's Self in II muro della terra, where the triad of Vernunft, Existenz, and Transzendenz is translated into a poetic and an obsti- nate search of the eternal absent, the Divine, the unknown God, contemplated from a subjective and an ontological dimension. The Capronian Self, by existing, seeks dialogue with the Divine sine nomine because it is the only means through which he can exist; Existenz affirms itself in approaching and reaching Transzendenz according to a secular and subjective perspective. But whereas in Jaspers' theory the meeting between the Self and the Other results in a discovery and in an authentic revelation within human con- science, in interiore homine, Caproni's one remains alone in waiting for God's answer. Given the similarity and connection of Caproni and Jaspers' state- ments - freedom, rejection of religious structures and objective meta- physical systems, belief in perception of the Divine in our con- science - we are allowed to mint a new term for Caproni's religious thought: secular and liberal religiosity, stemming from both the development of German Existentialism in Italy and the secular revo- lution of religion that has characterized, and modified, the percep- tion of religious thought in the twentieth century.10 As a matter of fact, Caproni's aims to dispel the distinction between religio and fides Christiana, provoking an exodus of religion from the meta- physical system in order to explore that religious dimension which is inherent in human beings. The theme of conscientia hominis ut locus revelationis, where the individual agent becomes the center of every possible theophany, moves our attention to the means of communication, its task, and 87</page><page sequence="6">Alberto Comparirli its poetic aftermath in II muro della terra. If in Jaspers' philosophical model the function of dialogue resolves in the religious experience of Liberalität - and in the resulting discovery of the Divine - the Italian poet experiments with the terrible absence of God. More- over, His invisible nature will cause a further dissolution of the Self - and of God, being related to the self by the rhyme "Io-Dio" - and a new desperation that will translate itself both in the hunting of God (II franco cacciatore, 11 II conte di Kevenhüller 12) and in the poet's refuge in search for what is missing (Res amissa).13 In the book published in 1975, the Jaspersian triad of Vernunft, Existenz, and Transzendenz is expressed by Caproni by means of prayer, although developed according to the idea of Theomachy, whose roots belong both to Judeo-Christian and to pagan tradi- tions. Moreover, while the Christian element is in Caproni's poetry either as a motif or as the theme of hermeneutical search, the pa- gan one is set as epigraphy to the poem "Il fischio". Indeed, the Promethean apostrophe, " é|iàç 5è cppévaç épéGiasôiáxopoç &lt;pó|3oç " introduces the theme of rebellion in a religious key - namely, a poetic invective, full of vengeful feelings towards God. In this context, one might consider prayer as an invocation that arises from within the individual, as an inner structure of human conscience, where the Self is close either to religious abandon or to the ontological revolt. Man thinks and prays in a way that cannot let the two spheres, ethical-religious and ontological, move away from each other. Rather, the irrepressible character of finitude and fallibility holds together this polarity, giving it the force of Vernunft to tackle the ultimate danger of futility of being: the absence of God. On the one hand, man, because of his mortal finitude, seeks Him; on the other hand, he is inspired by the law of the infinitely large in the revelation of ontological dectatum within our conscience, that bonds man's destiny, world, and God. The bond that ties the historical and polymorphous Existenz of man to the immanent Transzendenz that exists within human be- ings' conscience, and hence within the Jaspersian triad, is deter- mined by the act and the form of prayer. Indeed, God must be summoned up not just to demonstrate His own existence, but also to understand the reason for the persistence of Evil. Nevertheless, the function of prayer as a poetic way of dialogue to and with God has been neglected so far in criticism of Caproni's poems, espe- cially by Luigi Surdich, who argued that "non c'è in Caproni preghiera" (1990, 95). Conversely, Gioanola stated that prayer ex- 88</page><page sequence="7">Giorgio Caproni, Il muro della terra ists in Caproni "perché Dio esista, in quanto soltanto una supposizione di esistenza di Dio potrebbe fornire qualche garanzia sull'esistenza dell'io" (297). Despite the fact that in Caproni's philosophical system there is a clear rejection of faith as a structure, as a visible church, there is as well an inner need to explore and consider Transzendenz from an individual point of view (Vernunft), as an invisible church within human Existenz. Therefore, prayer "eleva il soggetto religioso fino alle massime altezze" (Graneris 3:137), insomuch as it can be iden- tified with religiosity, as an empirical and subjective manifestation of religion, by being the means through which man can aspire to a dialogue with Transzendenz. In addition, Caproni's prayer exalts the anthropomorphic component of God, who has been humanized by the Italian poet through the colloquial language and places in his poetry ("i luoghi non giurisdizionali"), giving to the act of pray- ing a formal aspect completely personal and subjective, as an at- tempt to " SiáteÇiç 7ipòç xòv 0eóv ." In II muro della terra we might tackle this issue by identifying a tripartite structure of prayer in order to outline the mutual dyna- mism and interchangeability between poetry and prayer in address- ing the Thou. This work displays human ground in the time of Nihilism, and shows clearly the double dialectic of religious thought - obscure and bright, absent and present - as the human voice of a creature that cannot release itself from eternal questioning (allocu- tion and invocation). Moreover, the poem itself is the structure of existence, an expression of its demand for justification and sense in front of the absurdity of history. The lyrical-Self tries to convert his isolated monologue into a dialogue, a meeting between the Self and the Thou. Yet, by doing that, the two vectors, horizontal (peti - tio ) and vertical (elevatio), that constitute the original form of prayer, instead of meeting God in the sky, collide into the prism of His- tory, producing an uneven beam of prayers - prayer of petition, prayer without petition, and anti-prayer - through which men ex- press their own sorrow. The first model of prayer that we might consider is the prayer of petition (petitio decentium a Deo). It is an invocation that expresses the old Job's question in a state of existential precariousness. This form is in complete opposition to the prayer of thanksgiving ( elevatio mentis in Deum), through which the Self rises to God in order to thank and praise Him. Rather, the invocation of sense in front of the Transcendence and the request for justification of Evil repre- 89</page><page sequence="8">Alberto Comparirli sent the poles of this petition, in which the religious theme per- sists, although it is developed according to a radicalization of this harmonic process. The result is the metamorphosis of request from a glorification of God's being and acting to a form of attention that translates in verses the dialectic tension between Good and Evil. This tension, that increases with the increase of claims, implies that the role of God as a being is devoted to fulfill human beings' de- sires. "Bibbia," the poem that closes the section "Il murato," offers us a first insight into what a prayer of petition consists of: Ah mia famiglia, mia famiglia dispersa come quella dell'Ebreo... Nel nome del padre, del figlio (nel mio nome) ah mia casata infranta - mia lacerata tenda volata via col suo fuoco e il suo dio. (OV, 343) From a formal point of view, the poem presents itself as an anti- prayer, by being the reversal, in ironic key, of the Trinitarian form of "Our Father" - "in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit." God, having disappeared with the domestic fire, has been invoked as a guardian of human beings. Caproni, by com- paring his immanent condition of suffering with that of a Jew, in- dicates the necessity of God's deed to heal the "casata infranta." But the wind of Evil has swept away both home and God, and Caproni's question remains without answer. The triptych that opens the section "Tema con variazioni" main- tains the petition introduced by "Bibbia". "Lasciando loco", in the space of nothingness, questions whereabouts God is and why He let Evil destroy His home ("chiesa"): E io, io allora, qui, io cosa rimango a fare, qui dove perfino Dio se n'è andato di chiesa, . . . (OV, 347) The poet is alone, incapable of existing without the Other (God left His home) and human beings ("Sono partiti tutti. / Hanno spento la luce, / chiuso la porta, e tutti / (tutti) se ne sono andati / uno dopo l'altro"). In his atrocious solitude he wonders about the sense of both his and His existence. Furthermore, he cannot 90</page><page sequence="9">Giorgio Caproni, Il muro della terra "amorosamente ... altercare" with anyone because of his loneliness. The use of the verb "altercare" (to fight verbally) is a first clue of the last attempt of the poet to reach a true dialogue with God - the anti-prayer. In "Dopo la notizia" it is the wind that carries on the Self's prayer. Marked by an epigrammatic progress, the prosopopeia of wind, in a constant game of anaphoras and epiphoras, tries to evoke God in a setting defined by "sconforto" and "nulla:" ... Il grigio del vento sull'asfalto. E il vuoto. Il vuoto di quel foglio nel vento analfabeta. (OV, 348) Despite the fact that the strength of poetry resists in the space of nothingness, the wind itself is "analfabeta," unable to speak to any- one. The action of the wind ("Quel vento"), as we have already seen in "Bibbia," has a negative value. As a casual natural phenomenon, it ruins either the immanent sphere ("mia casata / infranta," "mia lacerata / tenda") or the transcendent one, by leaving empty the "chiesa" "al vespro." As soon as its slow vortex embraces the quo- tidian environment ("foglio di giornale," "asfalto," "chiesa," "ghiareto," "saracinesche"), the wind "lasco e svogliato" renders the poet incapable of uttering the name of God; and afterward, it dies ("un soffio / senz'anima, morto") just as time does in Augustine's Confessiones, by being the non-being, a lack of being. Conversely, the poet's prayer disappears alongside God's missing words and those of the "vento e nienťaltro." "Parole (dopo l'esodo)" closes this cycle of texts by asserting the solitude of the Self in front of Transcendence: La sera siedo su questo sasso, e aspetto. Aspetto non so che cosa, ma aspetto. (OV, 349) Although the poet seems to be indecisive whether to go or to stay, he decides to wait for someone that is no longer God, but the Self itself. ... Io son già cieco. Ma qui vedo. Parlo. Qui dialogo. Io qui mi rispondo e ho il mio interlocutore. (OV, 350) Goďs missing answer compels the Self to find Him in a different 91</page><page sequence="10">Alberto Comparirli way, by searching Him within his own consciousness. Consequently, as he also changes the place of the epiphany, the Self changes the modality of communication with Him. From now on, he will be listened to and will express his feelings of suffering. Speaker and interlocutor, the Self tries to overlap, on a poetic level, himself and God. He cannot accept rejection by His Father; and by considering this new condition, the Self chooses to change his communicative perspective and his task. In the hereafter, he will stop asking any- thing of Him, emphasizing his ontological and historical suffering provoked by the lack of answers. This repenting change of perspective of the Self leads us to the second pattern of prayer that we find in II muro della terra : the prayer without petition. This new form is an absolute allocution dissolv- ing into a heartfelt plea, in which the lyrical-Self declares the need to be listened to. The Self is completely alone, alone in the crepus- cular silence of the night, where he seeks the absolute Listener, the one who can disclose the ways of truth. Instead, the Thou under- goes a change in his metaphysical status, passing from being a term ad quem of dialogue to be identified with the Self. Notwithstand- ing the poet's attempt to find God consists in superimposing him- self on Him ("Io-Dio"), he discovers that the Other nature of God is totally unrelated to that of human. The result is the acknowledg- ment of God as undefined Alterity, an otherness that turns the re- lation between him and Him into him and Other, in an ontologi- cal dimension overlooked by an incommensurable distance that renders the prayer without petition a useless intentional act. Caproni's new religious poetic question is played on the am- bivalent homophony of the couple "Io-Dio," whose phonetic na- ture allows a complete superimposition of both Self and Thou; it represents the coincidence of Being and Nothingness. The distance that persists between the two figures does not allow the Self to meet the Other, in accordance with his ontological exigency: the need to exist. Caproni creates a hermeneutic circle in which the parts ceaselessly come near to and go away from each other. The result is the death of God and the crisis of the Self. In "Tristissima copia ovvero Quarantottesca" we can sense the distressing fracture of the Self: Partivan tutti e addio e addio e addio e a Dio. Soltanto chi non partiva (io) partiva in quel rimescolio. (OV, 282) 92</page><page sequence="11">Giorgio Caproni, Il muro della terra As everyone seems to abandon faith in God, by leaving and say- ing "addio" the Self tries to resist, persisting in his own belief. The prayer, in this case, corresponds to the attempt at evoking God with the word "addio," that is a way to call God (ad Deum &gt; to God). On the one hand, the Self seems to declare his distance from the metaphysical sphere; on the other hand, he claims the figure of God, by addressing Him his prayer without petition. In "Finita l'opera" Caproni develops the overlap of both Self and God according to the hellish climate that dominates II muro della terra : ...Io che non ho abitazione (che, qui fra voi, vedete, e per voi, son Dio che esiste, si dice, soltanto nell'atto di chi lo prega: un atto, in fondo, di disperazione e negazione), io . . . (OV, 292) "Disperazione" and "negazione" are the two deeds that consti- tute the prayer of the Self. By comparing them with the ones that belong to Congedo del viaggiatore cerimonioso, we can easily see the evolution of Caproni's religious thought: in 1965, the poet's be- havior towards God, death, and Evil is accompanied by that irony that characterizes his personae. The Congedo is a clear example of this position, because beyond apotropaic voices of personae, the "disperazione / calma, senza sgomento," we find both the noth- ingness and the non-sense of life - the two elements that dominate the space of the Self. In "Lamento (o boria) del preticello deriso", Self's "disperazione" is due to the fact that not even the priest be- lieves in God, and that "la vera autrice / della mia conversione ... fu una meretrice." The "miseria senza teologia," background of the entire poetry, finds its ideal conclusion in the final statement of the poem: ... io (vi giuro: le mani mi tremano) non so più agire e prego; prego non so ben dire chi e per che cosa; ma prego: prego (e in ciò consiste - unica! - la mia conquista) non, come accomoda dire al mondo, perché Dio esiste: ma, come uso soffrire io, perché Dio esista. (OV, 258) 93</page><page sequence="12">Alberto Comparirli Being a "semplice prete" entails the sacrifice of faith in order for hope to exist in a world contaminated by Evil. The two polyptotons that close the stanza, "perché-perché" (causal-final) and the verbal couple "esiste-esista" (indicative-subjunctive), attest with terrible irony to the function of prayer as a means to believe in the exist- ence of God. Rather, in II muro della terra, and specifically in "Finita l'opera", Caproni recovers these elements to pursue, with a different atti- tude, his lost God. The metaphysical tension of the Self is now developed according to the perception that God has abandoned men, and that prayer is the last tool left to human beings in order for them to believe in His existence. Therefore, the "disperazione" is posed again without any kind of irony. The wall of the earth has surrounded the Self, who can only pray to be listened to, by seek- ing God in his own consciousness ("un atto, / in fondo, di disperazione / e negazione"). "Andantino," set in the everyday life of nothingness ("uno dei più bui / cantoni d'un bar, al porto"), repeats the last attempt to recognize God ("Così di rado l'ho visto / e, sempre, così di sfuggita"). Yet the missing epiphany causes a further existential estrangement: "Ma ero io, era lui?". Starting from this question, Caproni outlines the phenomenology of God: ... A stento, potei scorgerne il volto fisso sulla sua birra svogliata. Teneva la mano posata sul tavolo, e piano piano batteva le dita sul marmo - quelle sue dita più lunghe, pareva, e più magre di tutta la sua intera vita. (OV, 369) The sudden crepuscular epiphany of the Divine induces the Self to call God ("Provai a chiamarlo. Alzai / anche un braccio"). As soon as he tries to invoke Him, God disappears, as though He has never existed ("ma lui / (od ero io?) lui / già s'era alzato: sparito, / senza che io lo avessi incrociato"). The only sign that He has left on the table where He (or he?) was sitting is the nothingness. The di- chotomy between Self and Thou forces the first to accept the per- sistent absence of God, which entails the eclipse of both ("anch'io mi eclissai," the Self, "sparito," God). But the recognition of noth- ingness, the alien nature of God as it appears to humans as well as to Others and not as a part of the Self itself, provokes the rage of the Self.18 94</page><page sequence="13">Giorgio Caproni, Il muro della terra The third type of prayer stems directly from the anger caused by God's silent behavior. Leaving human beings in a desperate situa- tion, He compels them to abandon both dialogical invocation and allocution to an affected and concerned prayer - the anti-prayer. Understanding that the poetic-religious word is not sufficient any longer for tackling Evil or for talking with God, the Self acknowl- edges the failure of God's will and His neutral and disinterested status. Therefore, this form represents the anti-metaphysical rebel- lion of the Self towards God - and the failure of prayer - a terrible indictment of God, a form chosen by the Self in order to question His Absence and Silence. He is at the same time Father and Creator of both humankind and of suffering; and although man cannot see Him in the moment of both invocation and allocution, he keeps seeking Him, by yelling about his own pain that nobody can heal, with recourse to imprecation or to swearwords. The poem that introduces the theme of blasphemy is "I coltelli," which closes the section "Acciaio": "Be'?" mi fece. Aveva paura. Rideva. D'un tratto, il vento si alzò. L'albero, tutto intero, tremò. Schiacciai il grilletto. Crollò. Lo vidi, la faccia spaccata sui coltelli: gli scisti. Ah, mio dio. Mio Dio. Perché non esisti? (OV, 313) Marked by a highly epigrammatic pattern, the poem expresses the coveted meeting between Self and God. The apostrophe that ends the poem underlines the metaphysical tension that occurs on a semantic level, with the vivid repetition of "dio" (lower-case) and "Dio" (italics and upper-case). The final question represents Self's suffering because of the abandonment of God. There is no peti- tion, no necessity to be listened to, but just the rage of a Son aban- doned by his Father, humanized and killed by the Self. The section "Bisogno di una guida," foreseen by "I coltelli," is the paradigm of the anti-prayer. The title states human beings' de- sire to be led by someone. The indefiniteness of the guide also re- veals the abandonment of any prospect of dialogue and communi- cation with Transcendence. Consequently, humankind curses God because of His nonexistence. The diptych that opens the seventh section of II muro della terra echoes the elements found in "I coltelli." In "Cantabile (ma 95</page><page sequence="14">Alberto Comparirli stonato)" Caproni exploits the innocence and the ingenuousness of a child in order to tackle the theme of the Evil God, the one that leads children to think that He can exist. Yet children's prayers are unaware of God's real nature: . . . come potrà, mio Dio come potrà poi senza odio perdonarti il furto della tua inesistenza? (OV, 321) The rhetorical question than ends the poem exemplifies the vexata quaestio that racks the Self: the cruelty of God. In order to explain God's internal absurdity (existence-nonexistence, Father- Enemy), the poet accuses God of having persuaded humans that He has always existed and of having deceived them, including chil- dren. "Bisogno di una guida" is the answer to the question posed by Caproni at the end of the previous poem: M'ero sperso. Annaspavo. Cercavo uno sfogo. Chiesi a uno. "Non sono/' mi rispose, "del luogo." (OV, 322) Already reduced to the grade of human being, God is also re- duced in terms of language. The further reduction of His phenom- enology transforms Him into "uno," someone, a being halfway be- tween nonexistence and indefiniteness. Yet, the act of blasphemy of the anti-prayer of the Self exacts a very high price. Lost in the middle of nowhere, while seeking a true guide for his existence, he meets the undefined God. Although the Self has not been trying to see Him, God appears in his life once more, by proving his useless- ness ("Non sono [....] del luogo"). From "Lo stravolto" to "Postilla" the development of the anti- prayer is formulated on a double level. On the one hand the Self seeks God to kill him, in order to affirm his superiority, consider- ing Him prey; on the other hand, he keeps reflecting on the conse- quences of God's disappearance for human beings and for God Himself. "Lo stravolto" recovers the theme of the death of God, already seen in "I coltelli": "Piaccia o non piaccia!" Disse. "Ma se Dio fa tanto," disse, "di non esistere, io, quant'è vero Iddio, a Dio io Gli spacco la Faccia." (OV, 326) 96</page><page sequence="15">Giorgio Caproni, li muro della terra The illusory ontological status of God conflicts with the exi- gency of the Self to find a reason for the nonexistence of his Father. The frantic multiplication of the Self hangs over the ephemeral dimension of God. As He tries not to exist, He dies. But God's de- ceptive aspect does not let the Self judge His conviction, and He hides in His nonexistence. "Testo della confessione" retrieves the theme of "lo-Dio," that of the prayer without petition, through the use of invective. The Self, driven by God's will not to exist, aims to kill Him at His home. But the poet knew that he would not have found God there. As soon as he calls Him by His name, he receives an answer in the echo of nothingness, whose meaning is familiar to us: in fact, we know that "il vuoto" has an existential dimension in Caproni's poetry, as the empirical projection of God's absence. That nothing- ness is the only sign that God has left in His nonexistence: Non c'era. Avevo ragione. Così, venne lui in persona ad aprirmi. Il viso gli tremava. Un viso, mio Dio. E forse (forse) è solo per quel viso (forse) che l'ho ucciso. (OV, 327) Given these elements, the Self can do nothing but to kill God (and himself) in order to reveal the drama of reality, namely the ontological dimension of nothingness and the murder of both God and the Self. An effective answer to this double killing is offered by "Coda alla confessione", where the author gives us the instruments for understanding the epilogue: Pace. Quel ch'è stato, è stato. Ora, il conto è saldato. Ma - certo - se non fosse morto (se io non fossi morto) - certo - lo avrei perdonato. Io non son tipo, io (fosse o non fossi Dio) da sopportare un torto." (OV, 329) The rage of the Self, provoked by the voluntary decision of God to disappear, prompts him to kill Him, although he knows that this deed also entails his death. Nevertheless, the weight of injus- tice is too heavy for the poet. He cannot leave God alive; and the 97</page><page sequence="16">Alberto Comparirli final apostrophe, bitter and tough, stresses the Self's acceptance of his gloomy fate. "Il pastore," whose biblical echo gives us a glimpse of the change in the author's task, demonstrates the necessity to protect God. The Self knows that God can die, and he disguises himself as a shepherd in order to try to save both God and himself: "Proteggete il nostro protettore. Salvate il Salvatore morente." Così predicava il Pastore nel gelo della chiesa vuota... (OV, 330) The ironie and tragic anti-prayer now is addressed to human beings to persuade them to believe in God once more. They have to protect God by His nonexistence, by praying to Him they allow Him to exist. Yet churches are empty, full of the chill of death and without hope; and God, forgotten, dead, and cursed, regains His real nature - nothingness. "Deus absconditus" and "Postilla," the last poems of the section "Bisogno di una guida," represent the final attempt of the Self-shep- herd to justify God's existence, by explaining what has really hap- pened to Him: Un semplice dato: Dio non s'è nascosto. Dio s'è suicidato. (OV, 331) (Non ha saputo resistere al suo non esistere?) (OV, 332) The two texts, which complement each other, deplete the re- sources of the Self by asserting the absurdity of God's act. Suicide does not correspond to nonexistence. God needs to exist in order to commit suicide, because death presupposes life. So how do we suppose the nonexistence of God without His existence? The last question, asked implicitly by the poet in "Deus absconditus" and "Postilla," corroborates human beings' suffering according to the form of anti-prayer. Both the absurdity and the non-sense of life reflect God's conflicting condition, and they force the Self to keep swearing against Him. In conclusion, the purpose of prayer in poetry, as it appears in II muro della terra, is to define the role of God within human beings' lives, according to Caproni's liberal and secular religious thought. 98</page><page sequence="17">Giorgio Caproni, Il muro della terra The three models we have identified prove the ambivalent and con- tradictory nature of God, and His incapability to answer the poet's requests. Firstly, the Self tried to establish a relation with God, a dialogue with Him, but His silence and indifference developed a feeling of hatred and anger in the poet's soul. Secondly, Caproni changed the form of prayer, by ceasing to ask for something; consequently, he finds out that God, as soon as He has been superimposed on Self's ontological status, is the Other, the absolute Alterity - namely, the Otherness that one has to tackle. Finally, given the aforementioned elements (silence, indifference, alterity), the Self becomes a mod- ern Prometheus, who debates God and accuses Him of not having tried to exist. Finally, the result of this process in II muro della terra underlines the aftermath (positive and negative) of the secularization that re- ligion underwent from the end of nineteenth century onwards (the metamorphosis and humanization of God, and development of secular-religious thought) and the absolute necessity of God as an element responsible for human beings' existence and suffering.
