<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Extended Phenotype. The Gene as the Unit of Selection. By Richard Dawkins, viii + 307 pp. W. H. Freeman and Company, San Francis- co, 1982. $19.95. As stated by the author, the main purpose of this book is to present a particular viewpoint, and not a set of testable hypotheses. The viewpoint presented is that of the "extended phenotype", which advocates looking at the totality of a gene s effects when considering natural selection, par- ticularly as relates to behavioral evolution. Dawkins first presents cases of animal artifacts as having a genetic component (due to building behaviors which are assumed to have a genetic base), proceeds to discuss host- parasite interactions, and concludes with a general approach to the ex- tended phenotype concept. The basic message that genes may have ef- fects outside of the individual organism is useful, but it is not presented in a useful manner. The reader is not introduced to the idea of the extended phenotype until quite late in the book. Much earlier material contributes to Dawkins' thesis, but it would have been better to have outlined the major points at the beginning, and then proceed to a discussion of specific issues, rather than the other way around. As written, there is no sense of a unifying idea until almost the end of the book. Another major idea of Dawkins is looking at the individual gene as the unit of natural selection, a viewpoint carried over from his earlier book, The Selfish Gene. The point made here is that it is the genes themselves that actually are selected for or against, and thus are the ultimate units of selection. This does not mean, however, that each gene is selected for or against on an individual basis. Dawkins fails to give a convincing argu- ment against the criticism that selection does not work on genes in an individual manner, but must act on the total organism.</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 535 A major problem with this book, and also noted in reviews of his earlier work, is the use of emotional conditions in discussion of genes. The reader continually runs across phrases such as "selfish DNA" and genes "uniting," "cooperating," "ganging up," and so forth. Dawkins likes to use this style of writing, referring to it as "harmless anthropomorphism" (p. 221), but he does not actually suggest genes have emotions. Such phrases are used solely for instruction. Nonetheless, such anthropomor- phism is not harmless, particularly when such phrases filter to the public without appropriate qualifications, thus doing more harm than good. Another problem, also relating to writing style, is the labelling of gene effects. In an early chapter, Dawkins counters claims of genetic determin- ism by stating that when one claims a gene "for" a particular behavior or trait, all that is meant is that there is a genetic component of some degree in the phenotype. I find the constant use of the phrase "a gene for" still implies total genetic control. Of course, Dawkins does not mean this, but I wonder why such confusing phrases are used. The problem is com- pounded when genes are linked to external effects using the extended phenotype concept, such that the reader finds absurd statements such as "alleles for larger lakes replaced alleles for smaller lakes" (p. 233). On a positive note, there are a number of sections in the book which are quite informative. Chapter 3 is a thorough discussion of the problems involved in assigning adaptive explanations to traits. Chapter 10 provides a detailed examination of the different definitions of the term "fitness." The entire book is up-to-date in terms of evolutionary thought, including topics such as jumping genes, punctuated equilibria, and Steele s model of somatic inheritance. A particularly nice touch is the detailed glossary. Almost no attention is given the human species throughout the book; the exception being a brief discussion of the "meme" concept. The meme is defined as a unit of cultural inheritance analogous to the gene, and subject to natural selection. While analogies are often useful, the meme concept is a clear example of an inappropriate use. The problem is in the assignment of behaviors to discrete entities, totally ignoring the multifac- torial nature of human culture. Writing style again compounds the prob- lem as "Marxist" and "Nazi" memes are discussed in an example (p. 111). While this book may be useful for those interested in sociobiological theory and animal behavior, it has little to offer human biologists and anthropologists. John H.
