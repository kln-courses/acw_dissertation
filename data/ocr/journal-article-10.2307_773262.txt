<plain_text><page sequence="1">GEORGE WINGFIELD DIGBY, Meaning and Symbol in Three Modern Artists: Ed- vard Munch, Henry Moore, Paul Nash, 204 pp., 25 ill., London: Faber and Faber, 1955. 30s. Mr. Digby's book is a serious, although polemic attempt to interpret contemporary works of art by way of applying Jungian psychology. His position is, as he states CAJ XV 3 284</page><page sequence="2">himself, that "a work of art, in the fullest sense, is an intuitive aesthetic statement of an experience. In the case of much modern and contemporary art it may give us little or no terms of reference to help us towards its understanding. In these and other ways a work of art is unlike so much about which we are accustomed to making judgments." Munch because of his roots in the Symbolic movement of art lends himself easily to interpretation. The non- anthropomorphic imagery of Paul Nash or the deformation, the dismembering, the piercing of bodies in Moore's art confront the inquiring mind with more difficulties. Both have taken inspiration from Breton's Surrealist theory and the Freudian element contained in it. What strikes one in the Jungian concept of archetypal images is, that in their ap- plication at least, they seem to live a life quite separate from the individual whose soul and creative power is s6pposed to have produced them. In other words in the interpretation what happens is that a few Jungian notions of the sub-conscious are applied as absolute independent entities adapted to a general Jungian scheme. This is "the anima," this is "the terrible mother," "the shadow," "the super-ego," etc., instead of Munch's fantasy, nourished on Goethe's Das ewig Weibliche (Gretchen) in Faust, and Dante's Beatrice, and Ibsen's Solveig and finally on the Madonna image, the virgo mater, which is at the source of them all, brought into con- nection with the experience of the inno- cence of girlhood, the purity of young womanhood, with his own sister Sophie's early death which produced Munch's own soul image (anima). The consequence seems to be an impoverishment rather than an improvement of the existing speculative or metaphysical interpretation. Man's inner life is reduced to a uniformity which might be right so far as its basic "mecha- nism" is concerned, but certainly not in the working out of experiences into con- cepts and images, which vary enormously in different eras, cultures, races and single individuals. What takes place here is the substitution of metaphysical terms by Jungian terms which also have a specula- tive, i.e., a non-scientific, although often a poetic qualitY. J. P.
