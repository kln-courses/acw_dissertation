Maceda Contents : Introduction 1. Archaeological Data 2. Analysis and Interpretations 3. Interpretations and Comparison Concluding Remarks Introduction The need for more studies concerning stone structures has frequently been pointed out by outstanding archaeologists x. They say that this culture trait may show many connections between Philippine culture and other cultures found in southeast Asian countries and Oceania. It may be mentioned that the Philippine conditions in this connection are not well known, if not vague. Today, little has been done or written about stone structures and their distribu- tion in the country mainly, perhaps, due to the fact that as a discipline, anthro- pology, especially archaeology, is rather new in the Philippines. At the moment much of the basic field work has still to be done in order to present a realistic * This paper was read during the 11th Pacific Science Congress held in Tokyo in 1966. - I am grateful to the National Science Development Board of the Philippines, the German Research Association, the Asia Foundation, and the University of San Carlos, Cebu City, for their financial support of the project; to Hon.

The work started by the pioneers in this science in the Philippines has barely scratched the surface 2. It is in this connection that this short paper is offered. Even if the findings or interpretations are questioned, at least the writer will have succeeded in presenting new data on Philippine archaeology to the scientific world. In 1962 the writer, together with a companion 3, led an exploration party into the interior of the southwestern coast of Cotabato in the island of Minda- nao. His companion had informed him that somewhere in "Kulaman Valley" 4 were several caves in which he had seen jars. The preliminary description given fitted the Chinese jars which were in the possession of the University of San Carlos. However, upon reaching Kulaman Valley, they were unable to locate the caves. The help of some Christian settlers and Manobo in the area was solicited 5. With their aid, the first cave (called Fenefe), two days' hike from Kulaman barrio, was visited. Due to the lack of time, equipment, and supplies, only a few pieces were taken from the site and transported to the University. Realizing the significance of the specimens, the Head of the Dept. of Anthro- pology of the same university sent out a second expedition in summer 1963. Unluckily, the team leader had an accident and after a stay of about a week in the area, the party had to return. In the process another cave (Kan-Nitong) was shown to the group by a friendly Manobo local chieftain 6. Specimens from the second cave were also taken along. Again the types of the specimens brought along were considered impor- tant; and, hence, a third and larger expedition was planned. This arrived at the site in February 1964. The party stayed and worked in the area until December of the same year. During this period, the two caves, Kan-Nitong and Fenefe, were methodically excavated. These two caves are located about fifteen minutes' walk from the expedition base camp. All the specimens taken from the two caves were stored in a specially con- structed hut. The broken ones, as far as it was possible, were restored, sketched, described, and recorded. The specimens recovered consisted of burial-jars (soft stone and clay) and covers, human bones, stone flakes and semi-polished stone tools, ornaments (made of ivory, clay, shell, and iron), animal bones and pottery (pots and shards). Charcoal, wherever found, was collected for purposes of carbon dating later on. Only the best and whole specimens were transported to the seacoast, and thence to the university. 2 Among these pioneers was H. Otley Beyer whose work in the Philippines is well known, especially in archaeology. 3 Diomedes Flores, who is a soil engineer stationed in Dadiangas, General Santos, Cotabato in the island of Mindanao. 4 Actually this is a dissected plateau with an elevation of more than 2 000 feet. Hence, in the title and in the paper itself this is simply referred to as Kulaman Plateau. 5 Mayor Gabriel Resurrección of Kulaman, Cotabato, helped us much during the entire period of work. 6 Amay Gas (Datu Ungka) who helped us in the early exploration and who also guarded the store-house during the absence of the team from the area.</page><page sequence="3">Selected Jar Covers from Mindanao, Philippines 511 1. Archaeological Data The caves As was already mentioned, there were two caves in the excavation site. Cave Kan-Nit ong (KN) is found in the northeasterly direction, about fifteen minutes' walk from the base camp. The second cave, the Fenefe, is located to the west of the base camp (about fifteen minutes' walk away). After the second exploration (cf. supra), it was decided that the digging be started in the larger one - cave Kan-Nitong. This decision was based upon the size of the cave, the amount of specimens, and the better condition of the soil deposits. It was further assumed that giving this cave priority in excavation would allow us to recover a larger number of specimens and provide the team with more experience. Kan-Nitong cave is located in a mountain northeast of the camp. From the bottom of the valley formed by the bases of two mountains, Kan-Nitong cave is located ca. 50 m . high half-way up the slope. The elevation is gradual for about 20 m., then abruptly rises for the last 30 m. or so. The cave's longest measurement from north to south is, more or less, 12 m. Its deepest portion, west to east, is ca. 4 m., and the shallowest part about 2 m. It has three en- trances. Starting from the left, when facing it, the first opening is ca. 1 m. high and about 2 m. wide. This barely allows a person to crawl inside the chamber. Ordinarily this part of the cave is dry and so were the specimens found in it, except those that were found too close to the entrance. The second opening, using the same orientation as in the first, is about 2,5 m. wide. The height of the cave roof at the opening is ca. 2 m., allowing a man to get inside in a stand- ing position. It gradually slopes downward to the deeper part of the cave, so that as one nears the opposite wall, one has to squat on the haunches in order to do some work. The third entrance in the same direction is located at the southern tip of the cave and its width is ca. 2 m. Before the soil was excavated, the roof of the opening was only 0,5 m. from the ground. Hence, to gain access to the chamber, one had to crawl. It was also here that the thickest soil deposit was encountered. A platform was built right in front of the second entrance of the cave where the excavation was to be started. This was necessary because room was needed for the temporary storage of the specimens removed during the process of excavation. Later the relics were to be transported to the base camp for preliminary studies and recording. The constructed platform was about four meters long and more than a meter wide, supported by tree stumps near the opening. Not only the trees near the entrance were cut but also other over- hanging vegetations so that more natural light for working and photographing could filter in. On one of the remaining bifork stumps, standing about 2 m. high from the platform, a crude pulley for lowering heavy specimens was set up. A skyline made of a 20 m . long strand of rattan was also put up. It served as a cable to guide the specimen, wrapped in bamboo slats and sacks to protect it, down to a waiting team member at the base of the mountain slope.</page><page sequence="4">512 Marcelino N. Maceda Anthropos 62. 1967 A datum point was established near the southern edge of the second entrance. From here the whole cave was subdivided into 1 m. excavation squares. All in all there were 63 of them. The first excavation was started at the mouth of the entrance (at square no. 1), the direction being towards the east from the datum point. Later, when the last square in the second entrance's region was thoroughly excavated, the direction was shifted towards the south- ern region of the cave. A few meters from the third entrance, the excavation was halted. Here the soil was sticky due to the presence of termite nests. It was noted that the moisture and pressure of the incoming soil caused plenty of breakage of the specimens buried under it. Due to this condition, it was decided that the excavation be continued from the outside. The outer portion of the third entrance was cleared of all vegetation and dirt removed and digging was done methodically. Here, the soil was also wet and sticky. However, the work was not difficult, because there were no termites' nests, as was the case inside. The work progressed at a moderate speed. The Kan-Nitong excavation was started during the last week of February 1964, and terminated by the end of March. However, due to the tasks of recording the specimens and attending to other small details, the work was finished only during the first week of April 1964. After a short period of rest, the team went back to the site and began excavating the second cave, Fenefe, in June 1964. This cave is located south- west from the base camp. Its entrance is about 20 m. from the bottom of the valley formed by the ridge on which tip the cave is located and mountain ridges in front of it. This small valley, probably, used to be a stream bed. Du- ring heavy downpour water collects here and rushes down to the subterranean passages scattered all over. In a few hours the water disappears. The cave entrance is blocked by a projecting rock on the right side when facing it. Thus the opening is not easily seen from below. The top of the cave roof is covered with overhanging vegetation. Hence, unless a person really knows the exact location of the cave it is difficult to see it even when one stands on the top of the ridge. Before any work could be started, the vegetation had to be cut down in order to allow more light to come in. A portion of the mouth of the cave has collapsed, probably due to soil erosion or exposure of rocks to the elements or earthquakes. Some of the soft- stone burial-jars fell out of the cave and have since been exposed to the elements. The cave roof is filled with cracks due to the above mentioned causes and ingrowing tree roots. Water percolation from the roof is rapid, thus explaining the formation of numerous stalactites and stalagmites. Due to this condition the earth deposit in the cave is moist most of the time. During the excavation work, when the rain was heavy, the working space became so muddy as to slow down the work. In spite of the fact that Fenefe cave was smaller, the team worked almost the same number of days as it did in Kan-Nitong. A datum point A was established in the northern side of the cave. Later another point B was located at the other end of the reference line. From this, squares were outlined. Digging started from outside the cave entrance where the excavation squares were drawn. This was made in order to establish the</page><page sequence="5">Marcelino N. M aceda Selected Jar Covers from Mindanao, Philippines | Anthropos 62. 1967</page><page sequence="6">Marcelino N.

All in all 22 excavation squares were available for work. More than 300 specimens (burial-jars and covers and pottery) were recorded. The bone dust inside each intact jar as well as the soil deposit in the uncovered jars were spread out and a search for objects contained in them which could be of scien- tific value was carefully made. The sifting of dirt through two kinds of wire screens partially possible in the Kan-Nitong excavation was impracticable in Fenefe. Sharpened bamboo sticks, for instance, were more useful and better tools than the ice-pick or trowel that were found useful in the Kan-Nitong excavation. Due to the muddy conditions of the cave all specimens were brought to the base camp where they were washed and recorded. Specimens were stored in a specially constructed hut in the base camp. Here the specimens were neatly arranged after having been cleaned. The collected artifacts A total of more than 600 specimens of the soft stone and clay burial-jars and covers in various states of preservation were recovered and recorded. Those that were worthwhile restoring were restored in the base camp ; those that could not be restored were recorded, sketched, and photographed when possible. Other specimens collected were: pottery shards, human and animal bones, ornaments, (clay, pottery, shell, iron and ivory), and probably charm pieces, i. e., fossilized shells. The materials used for making the burial jars are of two kinds, namely soft stone (limestone and young gypsum) and clay. However, there are only a few artifacts of the latter kind of material. Soft stone is found in the area especially in the places where streams have dried up. The solid beds of these streams crack and blocks of soft stone can easily be secured. All the jar covers are hand-carved; hence, there are plenty of irregularities (infra). The same may be said of the jars. However, if the artifacts were viewed from a distance, they would look as if they had been taken from a mould. The pottery jars are also hand-made. It is suspected that the soft stone artifacts were made with stone tools. The excavators recorded among the finds semi-polished stone tools (semi-lunar and flat in shape) and a quantity of stone flakes. Upon close ex- amination of the handiwork, one will be led to conclude that stone, more than iron, has been used for this type of work. Working with stone tools is not easy, but because the artists who executed the figures and decorations were patient, the results are to be admired. In this connection it may be noted that the ma- terial used for the jars is soft when wet ; thus, the worker may have worked on it while the stone was still moist. In the process the material was continually subjected to a wetting process until the termination of the work. Description of selected artifacts The descriptions presented are based on individually selected jar covers. Commentaries will be found at the end of each description. The objects will bear their original field number or museum number, as the case may be. Anthropos 62. 1967 33</page><page sequence="11">514 Marcelino N. Maceda Anthropos 62. 1967 1. KN-45-0329 (PL 4, middle fig. of a and c) The shape of the base of the cover is oblong and may be likened to an inverted bowl, its wider diameter being 27.5 cm., and the shorter one is 24 cm. Its vertical height is 13 cm. The decorations consist of 9 vertical flirtings on one side, and 7 flirtings on the other. The thickness of the irregular edge of the base is ca. 2 to 4 cm. The top portion of the cover has horizontal flutings extending from edge to edge at a right angle with the vertical ones on the ridge. Probably this type of stone cover is a copy of the clay jar cover shaped like a bowl. The lower edge of the cover has provisions to fit a shouldered brim. 2. KN-17-0164 (PI. 4, left fig. of d) This is a gable type cover with an irregular circular base, 31 cm. in its long diameter and 28-5 cm. in its shorter diameter. The vertical height of the gable is 31 cm. A human figure decorates one side of the cover. The right hand of the figure has four fingers and the left has five. While the figure is in bas relief, the fingers are incised. The feet (left and right) show two incised toes. On the other side, vertical flutings are used as decorations. On the four corners of the gable are found angular cuts. At the portions where no angular cuts occur are found rounded projections (ca. 2 m. long). The emphasis on widespread legs may indicate that the bones in the jar are those of a woman. 3. KN-12-0157 (PL 4, right fig. of c) This is a gable form of cover with a circular base that will fit a shouldered mouth jar. The longest diameter is 32 cm. and shortest is 31.5 cm. The rim which fits the shoul- dered brim of a jar is excavated to about 2 cm. deep. The vertical height of the gable type figure is 14 cm. The decoration is a spiral fluting starting from the base of the cover to the flat top of the gable. Probably this house-type cover indicates female bones inside the jar. Three-fourths of the cover is missing and the designs are almost worn out. 4. KN-8-0015 This is a gable type of jar cover with a circular base. It is provided with an excavated rim to fit the shouldered mouth of a jar. Its longer diameter is 32 cm. and the shorter is 30 cm. The vertical height is 15 cm. The base of the cover extending to about 4 cm., there is no decoration; from this level the honey-comb figures begin. They become larger at the middle of the vertical height of the cover, and gradually grow smaller as they go higher. One-third of the base rim is missing (lost by shipping) ; the upper part of the ridge is also missing. Probably this indicates that a female bone had been deposited in the jar. 5. KN-9-0069 This gable type cover has an almost circular base that will fit into a plain-mouthed jar. The lower part of the cover has a long diameter of 15 cm. and short diameter of 14 cm. Its upper portion has a long diameter of 21.5 cm. and short diameter of 20 cm. The vertical height from the upper part of the base to the broken tip is 11 cm. The decorations consist mostly of flutings (both horizontal and vertical) starting from the base of the cover. 6. KN-5-009 (PL 4, right fig. of b) This is a gable type cover with a round base made to fit into a jar's mouth. The longest diameter of the base is 22 cm. and its shortest diameter is 20 cm. The upper part of the base has a longer diameter of 33 cm. and a shorter diameter of 29 cm. The four sides of the house gable have vertical flutings going towards the top. At the base there are horizontal flutings. The decorations are wide at the bottom and become narrow in the upper part. The ridge of the gable is high.</page><page sequence="12">Selected Jar Covers from Mindanao, Philippines 515 7. KN-15-0294 The cover is of the gable type with an almost rectangular base. The inner part is ex- cavated, wide at the beginning and almost circular at the top. The length of the cover is 28 cm. and the width 24 cm. The vertical height is 20 cm. The upper part from the middle up to its ridge, is 13 cm. long. On one side of the gable, at its middle part, is a human figure with upraised hands and widespread legs. The right hand has four incised fingers and the left hand, three. The lower part of the legs from the knee downward are missing. Near the bottom part of the cover are parallel flutings. The corners of the gable have angular cuts that are set close to each other, appearing almost as a series of serrations. The fluting and fish bone designs are found on the side opposite to that one containing the human figures. The cover probably indicates that the bones contained in the jar were those of a male individual. No emphasis on the buttocks is noticed. Furthermore, about two-thirds of the lower part of the cover's base is missing. 8. KN-17-A This gable type of cover has a base a portion of which fits into a plain rimmed jar. This part has a long diameter of 17 cm. and a shorter one of 15 cm. The upper part has a long diameter of 21 cm. and a short diameter of 19 cm. The vertical height is 12 cm. The gable figure has a rounded ridge with the upper part decorated with concentric flutings. On one side is an incised diamond figure. The diamonds may be an effort to indicate a yoni and that the specimen contained in the jar is female. The cover being small, the buried individual may have been still young. The flutings (6 of them) on one side may indicate the age (?) of the specimen in the jar. 9. M-C0007 (KN) (Fig. 5, 2 right figs, of lower line) This is a 20 cm. tall gable type cover with a base diameter of 30 cm. Scalloped corners form the base of the gable. The upper part of the house gable is missing, and hence the top parts of the two bas relief anthropomorphic figures are also incomplete. The first figure is a human being resembling a flying lizard. It has an open mouth, with rounded eyes and no nose. Its right hand is missing and the left hand has four incised fingers. The right foot has five and the left has six toes. The tail is about 7 cm. and is almost 3 cm. wide. The second figure in bas relief has no tail. The right hand has three incised fingers, while the left hand is missing. The right foot has five incised toes and the left has six. The neck is long and the head is rounded. The mouth is wide open but there is no nose. Probably this is the cover of a jar containing the bones of a shaman, a magician or a medicine man. 10. KN-50-103 (PL 3, a) The circular base of this cover has a longer diameter of 23 cm. and shorter diameter of 22.5 cm. From this arises a fluted cone being a 25 cm. tall human figure with a body ca. 9 cm. thick. On its head are clearly indicated two ears, two closely set eyes, stubby nose, a 2.4 cm. long mouth, and a receding chin. The other decorations are: the ver- tical flutings at the base cone and a figure at its lower part which is a line drawing of a woman with buttocks emphasized. It has two feet (the right with three toes and left with two toes). A stick figure with an excavated female genitalia is found a little lower than where the two feet almost meet. Probably the jar had contained a specimen of an intersexed individual. 11. KN-20-0128 (PL 5, d and PL 3, b) Part of the circular base of the jar fits into a plain brim jar. This portion has a long diameter of 19.5 cm. and a short one of 19 cm. The upper portion of the cover which</page><page sequence="13">516 Marcelino N. Maceda Anthropos 62. 1967 will rest on the shoulder of the jar has 26 cm. for its longer diameter and 25 cm. for its shorter side. The cover has a vertical height of 39 cm. On the top of the larger cone with fluted surface is the figure of a standing human figure. The left arm is missing; the right arm measures 14 cm. long and about 1 cm. in diameter. The arm shows no fingers, while the legs are only 9 cm. long. Between the thighs is the lingam, being a projection barely visible. The face of the figure is 8 cm. long, the neck 5 cm. There are two closely set eyes (bored holes), a stubby nose (with bored nostrils), an excavated mouth 3 cm. long, prominent chin, ears set close to the eyes, prominent jaws,' crown of the head excavated in the form of an inverted cone, and flutings at the back of the figure. Other decorations used are the flutings at the base of the cover. Probably the figure is that of a male human being. The excavation on the crown may indicate an effort to show that trepanation had been practiced on the individual. 12. KN-18-B (Fig. 4, lower line) The cover is circular in shape and is provided with a bottom part to fit into a plain brim jar. This portion has a long diameter of 22.5 cm. and short diameter of 21 cm. The upper part that will cover the mouth of the jar has a long diameter of 29 cm. and short diameter of 26 cm. The vertical height of the cover is ca. 26 cm. The larger part of the base going up is surmounted by a probable human figure which is broken. The thickness at the cut portion is 8 cm. There are two pairs of feet, placed one above the other. The right lower foot is not clearly marked, while the upper superimposed right foot is clearly drawn and shows five toes. The lower foot clearly has five toes and the upper left foot has five toes too. Between the four legs is a lingam projecting about 1 cm. The double male figure may indicate two male burials, or the bone of husband and wife, or even twins. It may be pointed out that there is a difficulty here because the upper portion of the figure could not be located. 13. KN-34-0265 (PL 2, c) This is an almost circular cover with the lower portion of the base made to fit into a plain brim jar. This has a long diameter of 17 cm. and a shorter diameter of 16 cm. The upper portion of the base serving as a pedestal for the bust is 21 cm. in its long diameter and 20 cm. in its shorter diameter. The vertical height of the cover is 31 cm. The figure on the cover is that of a human bust. Both the right and left hands have four fingers. The right ear is larger than the left ear. It has a low forehead, stubby nose, thin open mouth, short chin and rather prominent jaws. It seems to be leaning on something. Probably this bust is that of a male child. The figure is realistic enough, except for the fact that some fingers are missing. 14. KN-ll-A The cover is of the gable type with an almost oblong-shaped base. Its lower part has a long diameter of 24 cm. and a shorter one of 22 cm. It has a rim with a ca. 7-8 cm. excavation so that the cover will fit the jar mouth. The lower part of the base is about 2 to 3 cm. before the real base of the figure. The total height of the cover is 18 cm. On one side of the gable is an abstraction of a human figure with a vulva. At the corner of the gable are angular cuts and some fishbone designs. The line drawing is that of a woman. The other figure found at the lower part shows the buttocks of another woman with the yoni extending forward. The number of angular cuts on the gable corners may indicate the age (?) of the individual (s). 15. KN-12-0142 (PL 1, c, left fig.) This is an oblong cover with one end flattened and is provided with a lower portion that will fit into a plain-mouthed jar. This part has a long diameter of 23.5 cm. and the short diameter of 23 cm. Two parallel measurements up to the flat side give a long diameter of 28 cm. and a shorter one of 27 cm. The upper part of the cover is a 34 cm. tall figure of a human being. The height of the neck from the base is 12 cm.; the base has a diameter of ca. 10 cm. The face has a</page><page sequence="14">Selected Jar Covers from Mindanao, Philippines 517 snub nose, indistinct ears, receding small chin, and a small wide open mouth. The figure seems to lean backward. The surface of the base is covered by 25 parallel flutings terminating at the lower part of the neck. The construction and size of the figure seem to indicate that the contents of the jar are the remains of an important man. The flutings may be a representation of age (?). 16. KN-16-0188 (Fig. 5, upper line) The base of this cover is circular and has provision at its lower end for being inserted into a plain-mouthed jar. The diameter of this part is 25 cm. on the longer side and 24 cm. on the shorter portion. The upper part of the lid base has a diameter of 34 cm. The 18 cm. anthropomorphic figure assumes a snake-like or lizard-shaped human head. The eyes are close set and in between them is á high-ridged nose. The face is triangular in shape ; the ears extend from the top of the head down to the level of the lower part of the jar and are similar to the hood of a cobra. Three excavations arranged in a triangular order are found on the crown of the head. The other decora- tions are the six flutings found at the back of the neck and honey-comb designs on the surface of the base. This figure may represent a shaman who could change his face at will or a medicine man whose forte is curing snake bites. The excavations may represent trepanation and at the same time serve as containers for sacrificial offerings. 17. M-00018 (KN) ÍP1. 4, right fig. of d) This almost circular cover has its lower portion made with an excavation deep enough to make it fit over the rim of a jar. The longer diameter is 27 cm. and the shorter diam- eter is 25 cm. The 28.75 cm. human figure surmounts the top of the cover. The figure has a pointed head arising from two triangular ears. Its neck is indistinguishable. The two round eyes are set on both sides of the base of an indistinguishable nose with indistinct nostrils. The mouth is wide open; the lower lip is bordered by seven pecked holes extending up to the upper lip on both sides. The two hands in bas relief with four incised fingers are clasped just over the breast region. The figure seems to be leaning backward. The other decorations of the cover are flutings found at the base of the figure. This anthropomorphic figure is probably that of a shaman who could change from one form to another, i. e., to a lizard or snake. 18. FE-11-8 (PI. 1, right fig. of c and PI. 2, b, d) This cover is provided with a circular base the lower part of which is made so as to fit into a plain-mouthed jar. This has a long diameter of 27 cm. and a shorter one of 26 cm. The 3 cm. thick upper part has a long diameter of 33 cm. and a shorter diam- eter of 32. The 28 cm. figure is that of a standing man. It has a long face with project- ing sides and a hanging chin (probably a beard and whiskers). The mouth is large and open, the chin is prominent, the jaw pugnacious, and the nose long. The eyes are round and widely-set; the ears are small. The right and left hands held over the stomach have four incised fingers each. The base has 17 flutings on the surface of the base in front of the figure. At the back part are 14 flutings on the surface of the back of the figure and an additional line drawing of a human figure. This large figure may represent a sage. Features like the emphasized size of the head and the whiskers and beard may indicate this. The clasped hands and the leaning forward position may show the characteristic pose of a thinker. 19. KN-17-0166 (Fig. 4, 2 right figs, of middle line) This is a gable-type cover with an almost circular base so made that a part will fit into a plain-mouthed jar. The projecting portion has a long diameter of 21 cm. and a short diameter of 20.5 cm. The thickness of the rim serving as base for the 24 cm. gable-type figure is from 1.5 to 2 cm. Both of the wider surfaces of the gables have</page><page sequence="15">518 Marcelino N. Maceda Anthropos 62. 1967 " sexual abstraction" line drawings. The legs and arms are indicated in one of the figures. At the base of the first figure are two round eyes. The sides of this figure are incised while the breast and the buttocks are excavated. On each corner of the gable, at the base, are angular cuts. This cover probably indicates that the bones contained in the jar are those of a female specimen. In both figures there is emphasis on the breast of the female body and on the buttocks. To further emphasize the feminity of the figure, a yoni is clearly indic- ated. Legs and arms are also shown in the first figure, but not in the second one. 20. KN-45-0330 This gable-type of cover has an almost circular base with a lower part that will fit into a plain-mouthed jar. The lower part of the base has a short diameter of 21 cm. and a long diameter of 23 cm., and a side about 3-4 cm. thick. The upper part of the lid has a longer diameter of 30 cm. and a shorter diameter of 28 cm. The vertical height of the figure is 28 cm. On one side it has abstractions which may indicate a female specimen. In other decorations are the honey-comb designs starting from the base of the gable to the ridge. At the top are serrations: 15 large and 21 small ones. The abstract figure was probably intended to represent a female specimen. The serrations may indicate the age (?). 21. M-C003 (FE) This 22.5 cm. long upper part of a cover is in the shape of a human head. Viewed from the top it is dolichocephalic. The back part of the head slopes towards the face and the ears are small. In the middle portion of the external ear a hole has been bored. The face has a stubby nose and the small eyes are excavated. The mouth and the chin of the statue are covered by stalactite droppings. The lower part of the face seen from the front is wider than the upper portion. This is the head of a man and probably realistic enough to portray a racial trait i. e., the head type. 22. KN-34-0166 The base of this cover, which is almost round, is provided with a lower part projecting ca. 5 cm. and fitting into the mouth of a jar. The longer diameter of the cover is 22 cm. and the shorter is 20 cm. The 32 cm. tall figure is a human bust. Both the left and right hands are intact, with the former having four fingers and the latter only three. It has a small open mouth, almost deep-set eyes, fine nose, stubby face, and well- formed eyes. The shape of the head is almost round and the neck is about 6 cm. in length. The back seems to indicate that the bust is leaning backward. The shoulders are well indicated but the neck is short. This specimen probably represents a young male specimen. 23. KN-49-A (PL 3, d) This 15 cm. tsmall clay figure is the upper part of a clay jar cover which broke off at the level of the waist of the figure. The left arm is missing; the right arm is intact and has one finger left. At the base of the figure is the remnant of a compressed leg which has three toes. The head is long, the ears are poorly made, the mouth and the eyes are wide, and the nose is indicated by two nostrils. These openings, viz., mouth, eyes, nostrils, etc. may have been made with a pointed instrument while the clay was still wet. With a raised face, this figure appears to be leaning backward. This may represent a leader watching over proceedings or a child (due to its smallness) watching an event. 24. M-001 (FE) (PL 1, middle fig. of a) This 29 cm. high cover in the form of a human figure has a circular base the lower part (5 cm. long) of which will fit into the jar. The longer diameter at the base is 29 cm. and the shorter is 28 cm. The head looks to one side, as if it were shrugging. The round</page><page sequence="16">Selected Jar Covers from Mindanao, Philippines 519 face has a stubby nose, slit eyes, and an open mouth. The ears are clearly represented by the excavations near the base. This is probably the figure of a male leader. So far it is the largest cover in the collec- tion and has the most haughty expression. 25. KN-9 (PL 5, 3rd fig. of a and c; Fig. 4, left fig.) The shape of the base of this cover is almost circular and made in order to fit a plain- mouthed jar. Its longer diameter at one point is 20 cm., and the shorter one is 19.5 cm. From the cone extending about 15-16 cm. in height is the figure of a lingam without a prepuce. The glans penis is emphasized by an allround incision about 1 cm. deep. On the other side of the lingam are distinguishable features of a human face. Clearly seen are eyes, nose and mouth. At the base of the lingam are vertical flutings. The exposition of a lingam without prepuce may indicate a method of circumcision. The face of the human being carved on the cover may show that the contents of the jar it covered were probably that of a male individual. 26. KN-49-0134 This pyramidal type cover has a base that is almost rectangular; its lower surface is flat so as to fit over the brim of a jar. The height of the cover is 21 cm. The dec- orations on one side consist of lines representing an abstraction of two human figures. One of the figures has a double yoni; the other has one. The second drawing shows a mouth, eyes and body. There are ca. 10-11 angular cuts on the corners of the gable. Probably the contents of the jar covered by this lid were those of two young females for the figures are childlike in appearance and the cover is small enough to fit a small container. Angular cuts may indicate the age of the bones of the buried individuals ( ?). 27. M-C005 (PL 5, 2nd fig. of a and c) This is a 20 cm. long broken upper portion of a cover consisting of a human head and neck. It is broken at the base of the neck. Its frontal view is that of a human face; viewed from another side the figure is that of a glans penis. The ears are missing, the eyes are deeply excavated, the nose broken and somewhat stubby, and the small mouth is wide open. Seen from the top, the head is almost round in its cross section but tapers to a point on one side. This is probably again one of the lingam figures with a human face on one side. Prob- ably this was intended to indicate that the bones in the jar are those of a man. 28. KN-6-004 (PL 5, 1st fig. of a and c) This 17.5 cm. long piece is a human figure and is a broken off upper part of a cover. The mouth and the lower part of the nose is missing. The excavated eyes are almost only slits. Seen from one side the head tapers to a point towards its back. The chin is short, the ears are round and have excavations at their center. Again this is one of the phallic heads (male). The glans penis is clearly outlined on one side, but the face of a man appears on the other side. 29. KN-5-0102 (PL 4, left fig. of b) This is a circular cover with a provision at its base to fit into a plain-brimmed jar. The vertical height is ca. 9 cm. and the diameter is 24 cm. From the base to almost the top part of the cover there are three parallel horizontal but irregular flutings which form a spiral design at the top. This spiral fluting on the top sinks at the center of the cover; thus, a 3 cm. deep cavity is created. This top portion provided with a cavity may have been used for certain rites or as a container for offerings; it may even represent a sun cult (?). 30. KN-17-0162 This is a circular cover with a plain base big enough to cover a plain-mouthed jar. Its vertical height is 6 cm., the longest diameter is 25 cm. and the shortest is 24.5 cm.</page><page sequence="17">520 Marcelino N. M aceda Anthropos 62. 1967 From the lower part of the base two parallel horizontal flutings arise. These later lend themselves into concentric patterns with the last circle becoming an excavation of 1 cm. in diameter (?) at its center. The excavation may have been used as a receptacle for offerings or represents the sun cult (?). 31. KN-17-0030 This cover is oblong in shape and has a provision at the base to fit into a plain-mouthed jar. This part has a long diameter of 25 cm. and a shorter one of 22 cm. The upper portion of the cover that will rest on the rim of the jar is 6-7 cm. thick and has a long diameter of 32 cm. and a short diameter of 28 cm. The side has two parallel horizontal flutings and the top, which is concave, has 7 flutings. This excavation may have been used as a container for offerings or an indica- tion of the sun cult (?). 32. KN-21-0213 This is a circular cover with a lower part that will fit into a plain-mouthed jar. The longer diameter of the base is 23 cm. and the shorter one 22 cm. The upper part has a long diameter of 32 cm. and a shorter one of 30 cm. The thickness of this flat cover is about 11.5 cm. The flat top part has four concentric flutings. This circular cover may represent the sun cult (?) or may have been a receptacle for a sacrificial object. 33. KN-34-0221 (PL 5, b) This round cover has a lower portion that will fit into a plain-brimmed jar. The longer diameter of this lower portion is 21.5 cm. and the shorter one is 20.5 cm. The upper part of the base has a long diameter of 29 cm. and a short diameter of 28 cm. The total vertical height of this pagoda type or stepped mountain figure is 30 cm. The upper portion of the base has two parallel horizontal flutings and joining these are flutings at almost right angles to them. The upper portion of the figure has no decoration. The 20 flutings at the base of the pagoda may indicate the age of the specimen contain- ed in the jar (?). 34. FE-X-24 (PI. 3, c) This pyramidal type cover has a circular base with a long diameter of 15 cm. and a short one of 14.5 cm. It has a lower part ca. 3 cm. long that will fit inside the mouth of a plain-mouthed jar. The upper diameter is 2 cm. more than the two measurements forming the base of an elongated gable-typed figure with a vertical height of 25 cm. Its broken tip is almost 5 cm. in width. On one side, at the tip, there is a chevron decoration extending down to 5 cm. One side has a line drawing of a woman with mammary glands; the womb and the yoni are clearly indicated. The bones in the jar may be those of a young woman. 35. M-C00029 (KN) (PI. 4, 1st fig. of a and c) This is a small bowl-shaped hand-moulded clay jar cover. It has a diameter of ca. 12 cm. and is 8 cm. deep, with a 5 mm. thick rim. About 3 cm. from the rim are two holes 3 cm. apart. The decoration is of the impressed (comb pottery) type. The im- pressions are straight on the sides and cross each other on the top. The clay is reddish and the firing effects are irregular. The cover is designed to fit the rim of a jar. Considering its size, this cover was probably intended to be the container of the bones of a young specimen.</page><page sequence="18">Selected Jar Covers from Mindanao, Philippines 2. Analysis and Interpretations Having described the various specimens, we may now distinguish sc features. These elements will be compared later with available data on a pui typological basis. The comparison may help to establish the relation, posit] and origin of this culture. The tools used by our sculptors in making the jars and their covers semi-polished stone tools and flakes (cf. supra). Technologically speaking, method of manufacture is practically the same, except in the case of the cover and statuette (with a broken base) which are made of clay. The fact t during the process of excavation no iron tools were found is to be considere negative evidence which does not prove anything. It is best for the mom to assume that no iron tools were used by our artist(s). The degree of finer of the work and the easy workability of the medium tend to point to the us* stone implements. Close ocular examination will show that the workmanshi rough. On the other hand, viewed from a distance, the work is to be admii The pottery specimens are hand-moulded. The decoration is the pac impressed type 7.

The soft-stone jar covers may be divided into various groups accord to certain specific details. Shape of the base (Fig. 2) Various shapes of the base may be distinguished. The base is conside circular when it is roughly round. Being handcarved, the circle is imper: and thus, two diameters are always taken in making the measurements: longer and the shorter ones. The bases of this kind are of four types: a) t' provided with a part that will fit into the mouth of the jar, b) the plain t which can be placed directly over the brim of the jar, c) a projecting t portion separated from the rim by an excavation deep enough to fit the &lt; of the mouth of the jar and hold it tight, and d) a projecting base portion t will fit the mouth of a jar. The rectangular-shaped base and the square c are made for four-sided jar mouths. Other variations are hexagonal and o&lt; gonal types. These other base shapes, although found in the collection, have been included in our description. They will be described in a separate pa] Figures on the covers (Pis. 1-5; Figs. 1-4) Various figures can be distinguished from our descriptions. The hur figure or part of it is very much in evidence.

Some of these human figures seem to lean backward and a few lean forward. Some of them assume a haughty mien (a shrug at something) ; others seem serious, and a few are just plain in appearance. The anthropomorphic figures assume several forms. One is a bust of a human being with the face of a hooded snake (a cobra?); the other has the</page><page sequence="21">524 Marcelino N.

There are also busts that are realistic (PL 1, a and b). Phallic symbols disguised as human heads are presented in several in- stances. From one side, these specimens show a human face, but viewed from</page><page sequence="22">Selected Jar Covers from Mindanao, Philippines 525 another point, they are unmistakably figures of glans penis. These symbols are also expressed in line drawings, especially of the female genitalia, a yoni. The pagoda or stepped mountain motif (PL 5, b) is also present in the specimens described. The steps range from a single one to any number. Usually these are carved on the cylindrical top part of the cover. The other cover types are the house gable form which may either be of the low or the high ridge type. If the ridge continues to a point, it is termed the pyramidal type. Then there is the flat type with either plain or concave upper surface. The last kind is the inverted bowl type with an almost rounded (or sometimes hemispheric) decorated upper portion. Ornamentation and other decorations There are various means of ornamenting or decorating these covers. The most common is fluting, a technique of decoration wherein several straight excavations are laid parallel to each other or at an angle with one another or in concentric circles and they are either horizontal or vertical in orientation. In some instances the decor is limited to the base section and in other cases they are the only ornamentation of the object. Honey-comb decorations are also found. Angular cuts are commonly used to decorate corners of the gable and the stepped mountain forms. If these cuts are made small and close to each other, a serrated decoration results. Incised patterns of human beings and other forms are made mostly on the sides of the house gable forms and occasionally on the back or front of a bust. Pecking is used to decorate some of the specimens in relation to the other methods mentioned above. Bas reliefs are used to depict human beings or anthropomorphic figures. 3. Interpretations and Comparison The different types of jar covers and their decorations give us insights into the culture of their makers. Technologically, the carvings have been executed with semi-polished stone tools and stone flakes. Closer examination of the jar covers tells us interesting facets of the artists' culture. Socially speaking and considering the size and type of figure, it may be said that a kind of social stratification existed in this culture 8. The large heads express the idea that their owners probably occupied special positions in their society. Several types of these heads may be distinguished. For instance, the large head with an arrogant expression could be that of a community leader. The other one with a serious mien may be that of a sage of the community. Others are just ordinary and show adult and juvenile individuals rather realis- 8 Suggs, 1960, pp. 9-85; cf. Sahlins, pp. 1-12, 13-92: Te Rangi, pp. 5-39; LiLiuKOLANi, pp. 414 f.; Riesenfeld, p. 549; Barton, pp. 145 f.; Suggs, 1961, p. 167.</page><page sequence="23">526 Marcelino N. Maceda Anthropos 62. 1967 tically. The faces of the anthropomorphic figures indicate those of magicians or spirit mediums or a community medicine man 9. Furthermore, they show us the likelihood of the practice of magic among the makers of these jars. On the neck of a single specimen of a human bust a female genitalia has been incised. Probably this is a representation of a leader's wife or an outstanding woman in the community or an intersexed person. This social stratification reminds us of the early ancestors of the Polynesians who, according to authori- ties, passed by the Philippines. This culture may have been a part of those migrating peoples' culture. The house gable type 10 covers are interesting not only because of their forms but also because there are human figures either in bas relief or incised drawing found on them which indicate that these covers with the gable form, barring probably a few exceptions, are covers of the jars containing female bones. Furthermore, they may represent an effort to show that women and the home belong together. Phallic symbols are also found on some of the jar covers n. The most common are those of the male organ. For instance, in several specimens, the lingam is not clear when viewed from one side as it is seen to be the face of a man complete with eyes, face, an open mouth and a nose. Viewed, however, from another side they are recognizable as the glans penis. This may imply that the other pole-like figures on the cover and even perhaps the pagoda or stepped mountain types may belong to jars containing male bones. The yoni is also drawn on some of the covers. The figure may be a complete line drawing of a woman or an abstract presentation of the female genitalia. Some female have their buttocks and breast regions emphasized, even including genitalia figures. The practice reminds us also of a similar one in some parts of Oceania, and particularly in Easter Island. Ifugao art makes use of the same figures. The anthropomorphic figures 12 remind us of culture heroes who can assume the form of snakes, a phenomenon reported among Melanesians of Polynesian origin. Besides being culture heroes, they are attributed with magic powers. Such, for example, are the shamans, spirit mediums, etc. The human head with an open mouth is common to many of the drawings and stone figures. The same mien is found among stone figures discovered in the French Polynesian and Easter Islands 13. 9 Riesenfeld, pp. 230, 331, 451, 508, 519, 586, 590; cf.

This also has been shown in some of the specimens (so-called stone skulls) from Easter Island 15. Trepanation is indicated not only on the stone heads but also on at least three skulls which have been recovered by this writer from Kan-Nitong cave. The practice has been reported both in North and South America, in some places in Melanesia, Hawaii, some parts of Europe and today, it goes on in some parts of Africa. In the Philippines this phenomenon was reported for the first time by this worker. This is not an isolated case for recently this writer also recovered human skulls that bore signs of trepanation from a cave in Guihulngan, Negros Oriental. It must be pointed out that the literature on Philippine anthropology (specifically, archaeology) is silent on this subject. The fluting decorations are similar to those in early pictures of Ifugao carvings, viz., house posts, head rests and mortar 16. The honey-comb design is also indicated on house posts. To be added is the fact that many of the north- ern groups in the Philippines, viz., the Igorots of Sagada 17, still have court- yards where meetings and ceremonies are carried out just as in some parts of Polynesia 18. The house gable type of figure on the cover finds parallels, even today, among the Ralinga, Ilongot, Igorot, Ifugao and some Polynesian groups 19. The practice of building the house over a stone pile is found among the Ifugao, Ralinga and Igorot, and some Polynesian groups in Oceania. Concluding Remarks In spite of the meager data we have thus presented, we are able to make some tentative conclusions. The people responsible for this culture are perhaps a part of the Malayo- Polynesian group that passed the Philippines on their way to the other islands of the Pacific. They arrived on Philippine territory, according to Suggs, ca. the first half of the second millennium bringing with them the so-called Beyer's "middle and late neolithic" cultural division 20. This particular group we are 14 v.

Maceda Anthropos 62. 1967 speaking of settled first, probably, on the coastal region of southwestern Cota- bato in the island of Mindanao which faces the Celebes Sea. Later they may have been driven away or they may have gone into the interior where they remained isolated long enough to be able to produce this type of culture. They had little contact with the outside world once they had settled in the area and began to cultivate clearings 21. On the other hand, in spite of their state of isolation, some facets (as read from the artifacts) of their original culture, viz., their social stratification, their stone-based technology, their practice of trepanation, belief in mythical personages (anthropomorphic figures and drawings), the use of phallic symbols (the Ungarn and yoni), their house gable forms, their impressed (comb?) pot- tery, etc. show their cultural affinities with some Filipino, Indonesian, main- land Asian, and Oceanian groups. In contrast, the Manobo, who are found in the area where the excavation was conducted, show very little, if at all, relationships with the culture de- scribed 22. At present, for instance, the Manobo method of burying the dead is to place the corpse in a hallowed-out log and after sealing the coffin keep it inside the house until the time when a good harvest allows them to bury the dead. The house is then abandoned after the burial has taken place. No ex- humation of the bones is reported among the Manobo. Probably a more de- tailed study of the Manobo may show some relations (i. e. borrowing) but this remains to be a problem for future consideration. Materially speaking, the people responsible for the burial jars and jar covers were poor. In fact, as stated already, very few ornaments were found during the excavation. Their way of life may have been a combination of hunting and marginal agriculture. A few bones of wild pigs and some other animals were recovered in the process of excavation. Furthermore, the area where the burial caves were found is practically second growth forests. The Manobo in the region know little, if at all, how these forests became so; they themselves have occupied their farmsteads only in recent times. The clay jar cover and statuette may be considered the forerunner of the other jars and covers. In the area clay is scarce and one has to go down to the lowlands to be able to obtain good clay. On the other hand soft-stone {either limestone or young gypsum) are plentiful in dried up river beds. Added to this is the fact that the material is easy to work on when moist. Forced to look for another medium to be made into bone containers, our pioneers turned to this soft-stone. This was a good change for it gave them a better material to work on even if this was limited by their stone tools. In this manner they gave up the use of clay in favor of the stone. Hence, they obtained a good material that was more lasting and through which they could express their way of thinking and life in general. 21 Only a few ornaments (made of iron, shell, ivory and clay) and one fourth of a camelia bead were recovered. 22 Maceda, pp. 77-89.</page><page sequence="26">Selected Jar Covers from Mindanao, Philippines 529 In closing it may be remarked that this culture belongs to the neolithic period. At present the accurate dating of this culture is a problem. This will have to wait until more complete and detailed studies of the artifacts have been completed 23. In this line there is a standing need to have the charcoal collection submitted to carbon 14 dating 24. References Barton R. F. 1938 Philippine Pagans. London.
