<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Foundations of Social Biology By LANCELOT HoGBEN (Research Professor of Social Biology in the University of London). REFERRING to Milton's brief experience as a schoolmaster in Aldersgate, Dr. Johnson, in his Lives of the Poets, remarks: "The purpose of Milton was to teach something more -solid than the common literature of the schools by reading those authors that treat of physical subjects, such; as the Georgick and astronomical treatises of the ancients.... But the truth is that the knowledge of external nature and the sciences which that knowledge requires or includes are not the great or frequent business of the human mind. Whether we pro- vide for action or conversation, whether we wish to be useful or pleasing, the first requisite is the religious and moral knowledge of right and wrong. . . Prudence and justice are virtues for all times and all places; we are perpetually moralists, but we are geometricians only by chance. Our</page><page sequence="2">193I] THU FOUNDATIONS OF SOCIAL BIOLOGY 5 intercourse with intellectual nature is necessary: our specula- tions upon matter are voluntary and at leisure. Physiological learning is of such rare emergence that one man may know another half his life without being able to estimate his skill in hydrostatics or astronomy; but his moral and prudential character immediately appears. Such was the view of Johnson. Such was the view of his radical contemporaries with their formul-e of natural rights. With rare exceptions it was the prevailing view of his time. It is true that the impact of the new physics of Galileo is already seen in the tradition which begins with Hobbes and ends with Hume. In the speculations of Hobbes and Locke, philosophy is coming to terms with man's increasing confidence in the guid- ance of his own sense data, toying with the possibility that the method of science might in the end succeed in satisfying man's curiosity concerning his own nature, but still less interested in how human beings do behave than in how human beings ought to behave. The determination to make the characteristics of -human behaviour the subject of ethically neutral inquiry is essentially modern. It is perhaps the most singular feature of contemporary culture. Political economy has severed its moor- ings to moral philosophy. Social anthropology, with more hesi- tation, exhibits a growing inclination to adopt the same course. In every branch of the humanities investigation is turning from the discussion of why things should happen to how things do happen. Doubtless the mechanisation of industry and innumerable minor influences have contributed to this change of outlook. In the actual progress of human knowledge no single incident has more powerfully reinforced the determination to subject the structure of human society to the discipline of scientific method than the publication of the Descent of Man. Till then mankind had been, as Dr. Perry might say, the sky-born children of the animal kingdom. The loss of their celestial status undermined the complacent dualism which had permitted humanistic philo- sophy and utilitarian science to pursue an independent course from the Renaissance to the middle of the nineteenth century. To-day the endeavour to promote the study of social custom, the distribution and production of wealth, the organisation of states and the growth of human populations as problems of behaviour is philosophically guaranteed by the generally accepted conclu- sion that millionaires and metaphysicians, statesmen and</page><page sequence="3">6 ECONOMICA [FEBRUARY seventh-day adventists are alike by-products of the same secular agencies which have fashioned the rest of the brute creation. It is becoming evident that the social sciences can no longer progress within the framework of a philosophical tradition called into being by the conditions of the city state, equipped with a logic devised to regulate legal disputes between fig merchants, and nurtured from Abelard to Kant in servile intimacy with the requirements of apologetics. The alternative outlook which evolutionary biology brings to the study of human society is neither a philosophy of social reform nor a philosophy of social reaction, but a philosophy of social discovery. Since the publication of the Descent of Man any theory of social conduct has had to reckon with the fact that man is an animal just as the ant is an animal. Man has a natural his- tory of his own, just as the ant has a natural history of its own, though there is not, as far as I am aware, an official science of myrmecology in contradistinction to sociology, nor any body of learning labelled the formicities in contradistinction to the humanities. The biologist, as a biologist, is primarily concerned with those general characteristics which ants and antiquarians have in common. The sociologist confines his inquiries to cer- tain characteristics which distinguish men and women from ants and all other animals. Their respective fields of investiga- tion overlap in the attempt to define what characteristics of human society are determined by those characteristics which men share with all other animals and what characteristics of human society are referable to characteristics which distinguish man as one species of animal from all other species of animals. So might Huxley, Galton and Spencer have agreed with us to define the scope and problems of social biology in broad general terms. Since their time experimental biology has made spec- tacular advances in the study of animal behaviour with disas- trous consequences to the anthropomorphic equipment of instincts which social psychology still cherishes as a legacy from Dar- win's generation. Those who now undertake the task of contri- buting to a closer unification of biological and social science are encouraged by the recognition that the implications of evolution for social philosophy are pregnant with far more drastic conse- quences than Huxley, Galton or Spencer were in a position to realise. This does not make the undertaking less formidable. The progress of animal biology as an experimental science indi- cates that the difficulties of devising suitable methods for the study of social biology are much greater than our predecessors</page><page sequence="4">193I] THE FOUNDATIONS OF SOCIAL BIOLOGY 7 imagined. To build upon a secure foundation those difficulties should be faced at the outset. It is my intention in this inau- gural address to examine what they are rather than to hold out the prospect of an immediate and abundant harvest. To-day the hypothesis of organic evolution rests on a founda- tion of securely established experimental data which were not accessible to the generation for which Darwin wrote. From a purely technical standpoint, Darwin's most specific contribu- tion to the evolutionary doctrine was the Theory of Natural Selection. As stated by Darwin, the Theory of Natural Selection has been profoundly modified to accommodate the result of later inquiries into the nature of heredity and variation. Such in- quiries did not receive their impetus from the Origin of Species. They followed the course prescribed by Mendel's experiments upon the kitchen pea. The epochal magnitude of Darwin's con- tribution to natural philosophy has tended to overshadow the profound modifications which have ensued in the subsequent history of the evolutionary doctrine, and as I shall indicate, in the sociological implications of the Descent of Man. The De- scent of Man encountered fierce contemporary criticism. When the storm subsided, the fear that the Church somnolent would again become the Church militant remained. There are still some biologists who regard any public discussion of the selection hypothesis as a betrayal of the policy of a united front. So in speaking to you as an experimental biologist I have no inten- tion of concealing the fact that there are other biologists still living who would disagree with much which I am about to say. The evolution of Thomas Henry Huxley, of Francis Galton and of Herbert Spencer was a precocious baby. Its parents and relatives entertained high and perfectly legitimate hopes for its future career on the government benches. With that end in view they encouraged it to argue about politics with its elders before it had learned to stand securely upon its own legs. Anti- cipation of immediate progress in the biological treatment of the humanities was inevitably coloured by the issues which made the first claim on their attention, and those issues are no longer topical. The selectionists undertook the task of emphasising the similarities of man to other animals in a generation when man's affinities with the beasts was a novel and revolutionary idea. To a generation which approaches the problems of animal conduct and inheritance by the experimental method it be- queathed the task of defining the dissimilarities in biologically significant terms. Social biology was brought into being by the</page><page sequence="5">8 ECONOMICA [FEBRUARY work which the selectionists did before us just as truly as the anatomy of the Renaissance had to build on the legacy of Galen's teaching. It is no less true that we have received from the selectionists certain assumptions, a certain bias and a cer- tain optimism which must be abandoned, as Vesalius abandoned the Galenic tradition. Concerning Vesalius, one of his biographers has remarked that " Little by little he became convinced that the many dis- crepancies between the Galenic teaching and his own observations on the human body were due to the circumstance that Galen had derived most of his knowledge from dissecting monkeys, but had not thought it necessary to mention the fact." Perhaps the biographer of a future Vesalius who succeeds in laying the foundations of a new social anatomy will record that " In study- ing the writings of many eugenists he became strengthened in the conclusion that they were often discussing the habits of fruit flies rather than human beings, but had not esteemed it neces- sary to mention the fact." Whatever limitations the pre-existing cosmogony had im- posed on the study of human society, it was fully compatible with the view that the proper study of mankind is man. The immediate effect of the evolutionary controversy was a tempta- tion to revert to the Galenic practice in social anatomy. There is nothing surprising in this reaction. To Huxley and Spencer the all-important fact was that man is a brute. It was necessary to reiterate man's genetic similarity to other animals in opposi- tion to the magical view which placed man in a category apart from all other natural objects. How strongly the need to em- phasise man's new status was felt is well illustrated by a fami- liar dictum in Man's Place in Nat'ure. "Whatever system of organs be studied," wrote Huxley, " the comparison of their modification in the ape series leads to one and the same result -that the structural differences which separate man from the gorilla and chimpanzee are not so great as those which separate the gorilla from the lower apes." This, in Huxley's own exemplary metaphor, was plastering the fair face of truth with the cosmetic of rhetoric. In his dispute with Owen, Huxley went much further than a modern anatomist would be prepared to follow him, though he gained the assent of his contemporaries. Owen himself might have made a more devastating case against man's affinities with the apes, if like Cuvier he had paid more attention to the structure of the human foot and less to the hippocampus major. His opponents were too busy disposing</page><page sequence="6">1931] THE FOUNDATIONS OF SOCIAL BIOLOGY 9 of man's Cartesian spirit to pay much regard to his Cuvierian soul. We can now see that theological opposition often goaded the pioneers of evolution to extremities which are easy to condone but unnecessary to emulate. It is unfortunate that many eugenists have tended to perpetuate the same attitude in their propaganda. The eugenic movement has performed a necessary service in emphasising the close relation between biological and social science. It is now time to recognise that the modest pro- gramme propounded by Galton, the Galen of social biology, cannot be executed by limiting inquiry within the boundaries customarily prescribed by eugenic writers. , The genetic mechanism underlying social behaviour is only one aspect, and perhaps a very small part, of the common field of interest which theoretical biology shares with sociological investigation. Man shares with other animals a certain method of procreation. He differs from other animals pre-eminently in the enormous range of his realisable reactions to external stimuli. This complexity of human behaviour has its physical basis in the peculiarities of the central nervous system. To ascertain the significance of these peculiarities belongs to a department of experimental physiology which lies beyond the scope of genetics. An ade- quate conception of the common field of biological and social science necessarily includes both types of inquiry. Exclusive insistence on the characteristics which human beings share with other species to the neglect of those characteristics which dis- tinguish mankind from other animals can only defeat its own end, and has again and again led biologists to extravagances only too apparent to those who make the study of human society their special concern. The controversies of the last generation have left their impress on the biological discussion of social questions in a variety of ways. I have alluded to the bias towards overlooking the bio- logical significance of those characteristics which especially dis- tinguish man from other living beings. Closely allied to this tendency is a disposition to pre-judge the basic issue of social biology by equating the concepts of organic and social evolution. Perhaps the temptation to do so had been facilitated by the cir- cumstance that the word evolution was taken from common speech. Some of the most profound misconceptions in the his- tory of philosophy have arisen from the habit of making puns. Apart from this the state of anatomical science in Huxley's generation and the original form of the selection hypothesis both</page><page sequence="7">IO ECONOMICA [FEBRUARY oontributed to prejudice biologists in favour of racial rather than economic interpretations of social development. I am not now concerned with stating whether that prejudice is compatible with the data at our disposal to-day. What I wish to urge is that there are good reasons why a contemporary biologist, more especially an experimentalist, must regard it with suspicion. Fifty years ago modern men were known to be associated with the later palaeolithic cultures. Mousterian artefacts had been referred to the Neanderthal species. There was much to en- courage the hope that further research would reveal a closer parallelism between successive stages in cultural development and the emergence of new specific and racial types. To-day the available information points to the conclusion that our own species served a long apprenticeship in earlier cultures. than those attributed at one time to Neanderthal man alone. The data marshalled in Sir Arthur Keith's masterly survey make it less and less easy to press blood relationships out of stone imple- ments. Professor Elliot Smith's emphasis on the physical characteristics of man's environment as the significant factor in originating Niltoic civilisation is indicative of a growing reaction against the prevalent fashion of biologists to insist exclusively on the genetic factor in social change. Among the few writers who have drawn a clear distinction between the concepts of organic and social evolution, Carr Saunders in particular deserves to be mentioned. The experi- mental biologist will find no difficulty in discerning the historical reason for confusing one with the other. The failure to make clear the distinction is inherent in the history of the selection hypothesis. Darwin's followers had no experimental data to equip them with an understanding of what happens in artificial selection. Hence they regarded natural selection as ubiquitous, ever present and essentially constructive, the creator and pre- server of the benefits of variation. Under the influence of Weissmann the selection doctrine assumed a particularly rigid form. Heredity and variation were necessarily coextensive. Environment as an aspect of the problem of development faded out of the picture. For a generation biologists were hypnotised by the discredit into which the Lamarckian teaching had fallen, till the progress of experimental embryology and the new cell anatomy relegated Weissmann's hypothesis of germinal selec- tion to the same limbo as the Lamarckian doctrine. While its influence persisted, all differences between parents and offspring were regarded as genetic. It followed-that a continuous evolu-</page><page sequence="8">193I] THE FOUNDATIONS OF SOCIAL BIOLOGY II tionary process had accompanied the development of social -insti- tutions. It was a natural step to equate the two. The conviction that legislation is a more urgent necessity than investigation was a mischievous and direct outcome of that step. That eugenic propaganda has not yet completely extricated itself from this confusion of ideas is well illustrated by a statement made by a prominent English eugenist in his paper at the World Population Conference in I927. " It is a platitude," said one speaker, " in these days to speak of natural selection as the essential agent in human progress." It may be a platitude. It is not a truism. It is simply a misuse of words. Social development is the communication of social tradition from one generation to another, biologically determined by the extraor- dinary range of man's conditioned behaviour. Organic evolution is brought about by the transmission of new hereditable proper- ties through the gametes. The mechanism of one is education. The mechanism of the other is sexual reproduction. The extent to which they react upon one another cannot be ascertained by a priori reasoning. Experimental study of genetic variation has made it abundantly clear that evolution is not a continuous process and that selection in nature must be regarded as a destructive rather than a constructive agency. At present we do not know the precise conditions which determine the produc- tion of mutant types. The only way of estimating the extent of genetic variation underlying the racial and occupational stra- tification of human societies is to devise appropriate methods for elucidating the irreducible and stubborn facts. This is one of the tasks which social biology is committed to undertake. I wish to urge that its successful accomplishment will not be faci- litated by an undue preoccupation with legislative proposals or a disposition to under-estimate the inherent difficulties of the problem. Let me first refer to the difficulties. The study of human inheritance is beset by innumerable obstacles. Man is a slow-breeding animal of low fertility. His chromo- somes are numerous. Happily, the geneticist cannot control his matings. In spite of these drawbacks, some insight into the nature of hereditary transmission in the human species can be gained by formulating the consequences of random mat- ing on certain comparatively simple hypothetical assumptions. Familial studies of colour blindness, brachydactyly and the blood groups provide clear indications of Mendelian principles. So long as family pedigrees are employed to demonstrate the</page><page sequence="9">I2 ECONOMICA [FEBRUARY inheritance of physical characteristics, it is not difficult to recog- nise the nature of the significant environmental agencies with which the hereditary materials react, and to make allowance for them. The geneticist is on familiar ground. The constituents of man's physical environment have been classified by the physicist, the chemist and the bacteriologist. Their effects upon the physical characteristics.of the organism form the sub- ject matter of physiology. It is possible to speak with some measure of confidence concerning the action of sunlight and humidity, of oxygen pressure and diet, of iodine and calcium salts, of infectious and contagious germs. There is no danger of confusing a family history of syphilis or endemic goitre with heredity in the biological sense. The features of man's physical environment are those of the physical environment of any ani- mal. The methods for investigating their influence are well tried. The concept of a uniform physical environment is a definite and tangible one. It can be made clear to a pragmatist or a presbyterian, a behaviourist or a bimetallist. It is quite another matter to speak about a uniform social environment. The factors which determine man's social be- haviour are so obscure and elusive that neither historical experience nor the study of other living creatures at present enable us with assurance to disentangle the genetic and environ- mental agencies which are significant. We encounter nothing essentially similar in complexity among other animals. In consequence analogies from the habits of the armadillo or the pelican are embraced with equal satisfaction by those who wish to canonise their personal preferences as universal laws of nature. Kropotkin was neither more nor less scientific than the political prophets of nature red in tooth and claw. Both were supremely irrelevant. The same irrelevance has been shown again and again, when biologists have yielded to the temptation of rationalising their political sentiments. Heape constructs a sexual ethic for the fighting and protective male familiarised by the biographies of eminent explorers. His feminist critic can derive inspiration from the worm Bonellia, of which the male lives as a parasite in the generative passages of the female. Some eugenists are ilnclined to picture the human poultry farm nicely mapped out in pens, each surrounded by its own partition of wire netting, with a few holes here and there. Maybe the Rhode Island Reds have scratched their way into the proper preserve of the Partridge Cochins. Sooner or later the cosmic poultryman, aided by wise statesmen, will put</page><page sequence="10">193I] THE FOUNDATIONS OF SOCIAL BIOLOGY I3 them back where they belong. His opponents can plausibly reply that-class differences exist in insect communities; that the difference between an ant queen and a neutral worker is more striking than the difference between royalty and factory girls; and it is a difference determined by diet alone. Such encourag- ing illustrations may be pressed into the service of any social doctrine by those who prefer analogy to analysis. In attempting to evaluate the role of racial and economic fac- tors in social development the record of history is no less am- biguous. A striking instance of this ambiguity is to be found in Professor Carr Saunders' book on the population problem. In the course of a temperate, and, on the whole, well-balanced discussion of the racial factor in history, Carr Saunders re- marks that the " Nordic peoples are mostly protestant and the Mediterranean peoples mostly Catholic and Greek. The fact," he continues, ' that during the Reformation a choice was set before- most European nations as to what religion should be adopted-the issue hanging in the balance for some time in many places-seems to indicate that the conditions were more or less equalised and the adoption of the Protestant religion by the Nordic type was influenced by certain innate characteris- tics attaching to that type." Making a very generous allow- ance for the genetic homogeneity of the Nordic and Mediter- ranean populations,:^ an entirely different interpretation of the facts is equally plausible. At the time when Christianity first received official recognition in Rome, the countries to which Carr Saunders refers as predominantly Nordic were either on the fringe of Roman Imperial domination or quite outside it, and Christian communities had long been established in South France, Italy and Spain. The Christianisation of the Nordic geographical region was hardly complete, when controversy within the western Church was beginning to assume sinister dimensions. With the exception of the Saxons, the conversion of the German tribes, including the Frisians, took place in the early part of the eighth century. The official conversion of Saxony occurred about A.D. 8oo. Christianity was accepted by the ruling powers of Denmark towards the end of the tenth cen- tury, and by those of Norway and Sweden at the beginning of the elevenci century. The conversion of East Prussia, Latvia and Pomerania occurred during the twelfth century. Lithuania followed in the middle of the fourteenth century. Where Christianity penetrated last of all, the conflict between the rul- ing classes and the temporal claims of the Papacy was generally</page><page sequence="11">I4 ECONOMICA [FEBRUARY most acute. Where reformers could seek protection in the clemency of rulers at loggerheads with the Pope, they spread their doctrines successfully. Where there existed a religious movement pure and simple, it was generally extinguished. The reformed doctrines spread in those countries where Christianity had been most recently introduced, and where the political sovereignty of the Pope and the economic power of the Church as a landowner were least securely entrenched and least agreeable to the secular authorities. Catholicism had taken its roots in the ancient civilisation of the Mediterranean region, when the Nordic peoples were outside the pale. It is true that the Nordic peoples gravitated towards Protestantism. It is also true that they happened to inhabit the geographical region most remote from Rome. There is no reason to think that their initial mis- take in choosing to live in the north of Europe was determined by characters peculiar to their type, still less to suppose that their choice was an intelligent anticipation of later progress in theological discovery. In seeking to make allowance for the significant factors in man's social environment there is no body of accredited science to which the geneticist can turn for guidance. There are as many schools of psyclhology as there are schools of philosophy. The introspective psychologist approaches social behaviour from a purely teleological standpoint, interpreting the means in rela- tion to the end it fulfils. The behaviourist adopts a mechanis- tic attitude, seeking to interpret the end as predestined by the means. One speaks of directing intelligence and instinctive action. The other speaks of intelligent behaviour and uncondi- tioned response. Between the two extremes there is a great gulf fixed, as old as that which separates the philosophy of Plato from that of Democritus. It is not merely a difference of per- spective and minor issues. Such differences exist to be sure in an exact science. Contemporary psychologists are unable to reach agreement about the very nature of their inquiries into the basis of social behaviour, Thus the social geneticist finds himself impaled on the horns of a dilemma. The methods of animal genetics are mechanistic. The introspective psychologist fails to define the characteristics of social behaviour in a form suit- able for genetical analysis. The behaviourist is suspicious of the genetical standpoint. When Binet and Terman published their psychological tests, it seemed that there was at last a brighter prospect for the study of what is often vaguely called mental inheritance. Whatever</page><page sequence="12">1931] THE FOUNDATIONS -OF SOCIAL BIOLOGY 15 significance introspective psychologists attribute to these de- vices, they are noises emitted by one organism in response to noises emitted by another organism, and as such familiar and intelligible material to the experimental biologist. The early workers tended to assume that the I.Q. necessarily measured the inborn capacity of an individual. The grounds for this belief were not such as would satisfy an experimental biologist. It is unnecessary to criticise them, because of late the psycholo- gists themselves have begun to adopt a less confident attitude. The Stanford school have conceded a conservative allowance of twenty per cent. for the influence-of home environment; and we have no adequate reason for believing that the ingenious system of home ratings employed by Miss Burks (I927) in this investi- gation includes all the significant ingredients of the situation. The Chicago school have investigated the intelligence quotients of foster children, and adopt an even more sceptical attitude towards the intelligence quotient as a measure of genetical en- dowment. Tallman (I927), who has recently studied the intelli- gence quotients of identical twins, found that the mean difference between pairs of brothers and sisters of different ages on the one hand and of pairs of non-identical twins on the other was larger than the mean differences between pairs of identical twins and pairs of non-identical twins. Accepting the most conserva- tive estimate, it may be stated with some confidence that the contribution of environment to the determination of the I.Q. is at least as great as the recorded differences between racial and occupational groups subject to different environmental influences. For two generations biologists interested in social problems have been writing about mental inheritance. As far as I am aware, Professor MacDougall alone has pointed out that the attempt to formulate a clear concept of mental inheritance raises a formidable issue which challenges the foundations of current biological theory. He himself faces the difficulty by returning to the Lamarckian fold. Lamarck's position was consis- tent. His theory was teleological throughout. Galton was not consistent, and his disciples have been less so. Since Weis- mann's time the study of heredity has become more and more explicitly materialistic. The modern geneticist regards here- dity as an aspect of the physical process involved in the produc- tion of a new unit of living matter. His hypotheses are con- ceived in physical units. The gene has space time dimensions. Mental inheritance is a meaningless collocation of words, unless B</page><page sequence="13">I6 ECONOMICA [FEBRUARY it is possible to bring the concept of mentality within the mechanistic framework. That is what the behaviourist school have undertaken to do. The future of social biology depends on the success which attends their efforts. Fifty years ago Francis Galton published his work on Heredity Genius and the Enquiry into Human Faculty. Since then there have been noteworthy changes in the attitude which the biologist adopts not only to heredity but to human faculty. The work- of Mendel, Bateson and Morgan has enormously en- riched our- knowledge of hereditary transmission in animals. The work of Loeb, Sherrington and Pavlov has unfolded new horizons in the study of animal behaviour. The biological analysis of social behaviour presupposes that both methods can be brought to bear upon it. It may be premature to adopt a confident attitude to the prospects of further progress; but it is becoming clear that the problems which Galton propounded will not be solved so long as they are regarded as the exclusive prerogative of- the geneticist. The enthusiasms engendered first by the reception of Darwin's hypothesis and later by the spectacular advances which have resulted from Mendel's dis- covery, encouraged some eugenists to adopt an extremist atti- tude. New and no less noteworthy developments in the physio- logy of the nervous system have encouraged the behaviourists to go as far as possible in the opposite direction. It is not difficult to understand how this has come to pass. In Galton's time the analysis of animal conduct had not pro- gressed beyond the recognition of those simple units of be- haviour which Pavlov calls " unconditioned reflexes." The scratch reflex evoked on stimulating the lumbosacral region of the spinal dog is an example of this type. Given the same external- situation, it can be elicited in any member of the canine species. There are, therefore, two principal factors involved in the scratch reflex. One is the immediate stimulus. The other is the inherited structure of the nervous system. Simple reflexes of this kind play practically no significant part in man's distinctively social behaviour. The elucidation of a more complex type called by Pavlov the " conditioned reflex" is a very recent addition to biological knowledge. The condi- tioned reflex is not characteristic of all members of a species subjected to the same external situation. It depends upon the time relations of other stimuli which have previously operated upon the organism. Within certain limits it is possible to predict the outcome, when the time relations of antecedent</page><page sequence="14">193I] THE FOUNDATIONS OF SOCIAL BIOLOGY I7 stimuli are controlled, and to account for a totally different pat- tern of behaviour in two individuals who inherit the same type of neuro-muscular organisation. It was natural -that Galton's generation should harp on the hereditary basis of social conduct. They were beginning to understand a type of behaviour in which the genetic factor is the significant variable, and to apply their knowledge to the study of what they called instinct in animals. It is not surprising that the behaviourists should adopt the opposite course. They are beginning to understand a type of behaviour in which the genetic factor is less important, and to apply the new methods to the study of man himself. On the evidence at present available social biology is committed neither to the dogmatism of some eugenists nor the buoyant optimism of some behaviourists. I would rather suggest that the methods of the behaviourists must be developed, if the prob- lems which interest eugenists are to be solved. Let me explicitly state that the simpler manifestations of conditioned phenomena hitherto elucidated by physiological re- search do not as yet provide an adequate basis for the analysis of social communication. In their more optimistic moments the behaviourists are apt to overlook certain peculiarities of the mimetic type of social behaviour. Here we have to deal with the emergence of new types of effector activity as well as the association of new stimuli with pre-existing responses. Never- theless, the behaviourist school alone have attempted the analysis of human conduct by methods which are comprehensible to the geneticist. I suggest that the attempt to do so is of far-reaching significance for sociology. Political economy, no less than genetics, is adopting quantitative methods and assuming the ethical neutrality of an exact scienc6. Few of its votaries would wish to see it return to the fold of moral philosophy. In consequence contemporary sociology is a house divided against itself. It is likely to remain so, until social psychology aban- dons its Aristotelian loyalty to an immeasurable, imponderable, irreducible concept of consciousness with its esoteric trinity of thought, will, and feeling, or the verbal apparatus of instincts which it borrowed- from the selectionists b'efore biology had purged itself of the last relics of scholasticism. I would venture to go further and suggest that the predictions of no branch of social science can attain a high measure of precision until the various departments of social investigation are integrated with a genuinely scientific analysis of human conduct. Human beings are not unique in forming societies. They</page><page sequence="15">I8 ECONOMICA [FEBRUARY are unique in forming societies which grow in complexity, in virtue of an uniquely exaggerated capacity for communicating the fruits of experience. The societies of ants are essentially static societies which owe their special peculiarities pre-emin- ently, as far as we know, to unconditioned behaviour. Civilisa- tion, on the other hand, is a dynamic association of organisms. Its dynamic character depends on an unparalleled development of the conditioned mechanism of social communication. Even if the behaviourists err in the direction of under- estimating the genetic factors in social relations, they will have performed a considerable service to social biology in promoting a new perspective. The geneticist is only concerned with those principles which determine characteristics which man shares with other animals. In other branches of physiology we are brought into contact with characteristics which pre-eminently distinguish man from other organisms. Man inherits an im- mensely developed forebrain. This circumstance frees him from many of the restrictions which heredity imposes upon the brute creation. The forebrain is the structural basis of condi- tioned behaviour, and what pre-eminently separates man from other species is the extent to which his. behaviour is conditioned by previous experience. The peculiar problems which justify the encouragement of research in social biology arise from the fact that man is the most teachable of all animals. A genuinely scientific analysis of the genetic basis of occupational and social stratification must build on the recognition that human society is an unique biological phenomenon inasmuch as the family is a unit for the cumulative communication of conditioned stimuli as well as a group delimited by genetic affinity. The selection- ists succeeded in presenting evolution in a form acceptable to their contemporaries. Man was dragged down from his celestial eminence. His place among the brutes became an accepted commonplace of the naturalistic outlook. Sentence had been passed upon him. Henceforth he must live within the prison of his own genetic limitations. Before the portals of his primeval dungeon Heredity stood with a flaming sword. In these new surroundings man could still demand a retrial, be- cause selectionism was a product of his own forebrain. That trial is still in process. Science has not yet promulgated. its final verdict. Galton conducts for the prosecution. Watson cross-examines for the defence. Man is released on bail, pend- ing the result of his appeal. In English law there is an estimable provision which forbids</page><page sequence="16">193I] TH] FOUNDATIONS OF SOCIAL BIOLOGY I9 the public discussion of evidence until the case is closed. In science unhappily there is none. I have presented for your re- flection some of the difficulties of biological inquiry into social problems. One of the greatest dangers is an undue haste prompted by enthusiasm for legislative applications of half- assimilated knowledge. The discussion of the genetical founda- tions of racial and occupational stratification in human society calls for discipline, for restraint and for detachment. Nothing could make the exercise of these wholesome virtues more diffi- cult than to force the issues into the political-arena in the pre- sent stage of inquiry. The dispositi,on to do so has already encumbered social biology with a vocabulary of terms which have no status in an ethically neutral science. A growing literature of research repeats all the shortcomings which animal genetics has happily outgrown. Of these shortcomings anec- dotalism is the most prevalent. Every experimental biologist recognises the disastrous consequences of constructing evolu- tionary hypotheses on the testimony of the pigeon fancier and the stock breeder. Only an undue haste to establish conclusions which can be made the basis of legislation has arrested the development of social biology in its anecdotage. Two quotations will exempt me from the charge of over- stating the danger to which I allude, when I speak of the anec- dotal method. One problem which engages the attention of the social biologist is the contribution of heredity to feebleminded- ness. Goddard's familial studies on this subject will be known to many of my audience. In Goddard's investigations -several hundred children in the Vineland training school for mental defectives were classified as morons by the Binet test. The family histories of these cases are recorded in his book. Mendel initiated a-new epoch in genetics by clearly defining the nature of the characters which he studied. That practice is the key- stone of the science which has been founded on his pioneer labours. Since the Binet test is a recent innovation the reader is naturally curious to discover how it was. applied to the ances- tors of Goddard's charges. The method which Goddard adopted to identify feeblemindedness in the ancestors of his cases is thus stated in his own words: " The ease with which it is sometimes possible to get satisfac- tory evidence on the fifth generation is illustrated in the Kallikak family. The field worker accosts an old farmer-' Do you remember an old man Martin Kallikak (Jr.)- who lived on the mountain edge yonder? ' 'Do I? Well I guess. Nobody'd</page><page sequence="17">20 ECONOMICA [MEBRUARY forget him. Simple, not quite right here (tapping his head), but inoffensive and kind. All the family was that. Old Moll, simple as she was, would do anything for a neighbour. She finally died, burned to death in a chimney corner. She had come in drunk and sat down there. Whether she fell over in a fit or her clothes caught fire nobody knows. She was burned to a crisp when they found her. That was the worst of them, they would drink. Poverty was their best friend in this respect, or they would have been drunk all the time. -Old Martin could never stop as long as he had a drop. Many's the time he'd rolled off of Billy Parson's porch. Billy's always had a barrel of cider handy. He'd just chuckle to see Martin drink and drink until finally he'd lose his balance and over he'd go.' " At the conclusion of this recital Goddard asks, " Is there any doubt that Martin was feebleminded? " I am tempted to imagine what the same old farmer would say to his crony. " Seemed a decent sort of fellow. Asked a lot of fool questions and wrote down the answers in a book. Simple, I'd say. Not quite right here." Of Goddard's work it may be said that it contains presumptive indications that genetic factors play some significant part in determining certain kinds of feeblemindedness. I am less con- vinced that any plausible conclusions can be extracted from the dreary history of the Jukes. In his monograph The Jukes in i9i5, Estabrook ventures to proffer only one definite statement concerning hereditary transmission in the Jukes family. It is that " there is an hereditary factor in licentiousness." I have searched through his memoir for a single indication of the way in which he defines licentiousness and its allelomorphic opposite chastity. Out of a large number of monotonously similar case histories I select the only one which contains any possible sug- gestion of the meaning he attaches to the latter. This one (Case G.) is as follows: " A cousin mating of chaste individuals was followed in the first generation by no licentiousness. In the second generation from the cousin mating no licentiousness appears, although the father of one of the children of this generation had cohabited previous to marriage. Their one daughter was chaste, but she has one daughter brought up in a good home free from bad in- fluences, who was very erotic but is at present chaste. The third child of this cousin mating of chaste people, Addie, married a man who had acquired syphilis and had one son,, an inefficient syphilitic, who died of tuberculosis. Addie died of syphilis at</page><page sequence="18">193I] THE FOUNDATIONS OF SOCIAL BIOLOGY 2I twenty. The fourth child, Alta V 78, who was always chaste, married but had no children. Horace, the only other child of Alfred who reached maturity, was reputed chaste, but was in- temperate: he married a chaste woman and had nine children, all of whom are chaste." The attitude of the experimental biologist to those who accept as scientific evidence data which would not even be regarded as legally admissible is well expressed by Thomas Hunt Morgan, the leading geneticist of our time. "The numerous pedigrees," he writes in a recent publication, "that have been published showing a long history of social misconduct; crime, alcoholism, debauchery and venereal diseases are open to the same criticism from a genetic point of view, for it is obvious that these groups of individuals have lived under demoralising social conditions that might swamp a family of average persons. It is not sur- prising that, once begun from whatever cause, the effects may be to a large extent communicated rather than inherited... Before we take the risk of wrecking the machinery of social biology by exceeding the speed limit of rational inquiry, it is desirable to ascertain the reasons for such haste. Dr. Estabrook has recorded his own reasons in quantitative terms. "Dug- dale," he states, in his monograph on the Jukes, " estimated a loss to society of $i,250,000 by the Jukes family from I800 to I875. The loss to society caused by mental deficiency, crime, prostitution, syphilis and pauperism of these 2,800 people is now estimated at $2,093,685. If the drink bill is added, this total becomes $2,5i6,685." The reason for this addition will be more apparent to a prohibitionist than to a brewer. I confess I am sceptical about the cogency of Dr. Estabrook's arithmetic. How damaging a case against higher education could be made, if we included all the port consumed in the fellows' common rooms during the last century and a half. Other curious items are included in the two million dollar bill. Inter alia we note the following: "Aggregate of children who died prematurely, cash cost $5o each child ... ... ... $I8,900 Number of lives sacrificed by murder (ten) valued $I,200 ... ... ... ... ..s $I2,000 Capital in brothels $6o,ooo, compounid interest twenty-six years at 6 per cent. .. ... $i8,ooo" One is left to wonder why this felicitous blend of biological and economic science is not rounded off by adding to the finan-</page><page sequence="19">22 ECONOMICA [FEBRUARY cial loss incurred by the State on account of the Jukes family, the cost of printing Carnegie Institute Publication No. 240, together with Dr. Estabrook's salary and that of his staff. In our own generation the population problem embraces a variety of issues in which the biologist and the sociologist have a common interest. A clear appreciation of the biological in- tricacies of the problem will not be promoted by an unduly alarmist attitude. The sceptical inquirer may approach the study of the differential fertility of the social classes which has accompanied the recent decline in the European birth-rate as a conundrum rather than a catastrophe. To make any satisfac- tory predictions concerning the outcome of the present decline it is necessary to ascertain what factors have contributed to the reduction of the birthrate, what genetic differences, if any, dis- tinguish different social groups, and how such differences are transmitted. The impressive array of evidence which Stevenson and Beveridge have presented strongly supports the view that the spread of contraceptive practice has been the main factor in the decline of the European birth-rate since I870. The German and Swedish data of Grotjahn and Edin point to the conclusion that contraceptive practice is rapidly spreading to all sections of the community. If that is so, the problem of differential fertility is solving itself without legislative interference. Of genetic differences which distinguish different occupational groups we lack any conclusive evidence. Even if we possessed it, it would be necessary to know how such differences are trans- mitted before prophesying-disaster. Haldane's analysis of the effects of selection shows that a selective process must be con- tinued for a very long period in order to produce an appreciable effect on the distribution of a character determined by the co- operation of several recessive genes. The population problem raises a host of issues for research. Not least of these I would point out that the social biologist has a very direct interest in the rapid progress which has been made of late years in the physio- logy of reproduction. The declining birth-rate has brought us face to face with the fact that we are entering upon the era of biological invention. If I have criticised the impetuosity with which some biologists have advocated legislation to control the reproductive process, I would add in conclusion that they seem to me to err on the side of timidity in entertaining the drastic possibilities for such control which the future, and perhaps the not very distant future, is likely to unfold. The considerations which suggest that the problem of differential fertility is solving</page><page sequence="20">193I] THE rOUNDATIONS OF SOCIAL BIOLOGY 23 itself likewise suggest that before this generation has passed we shall be compelled to face the problem of deciding how the populations of Northern Europe may save themselves from a continuous decline which once begun may be difficult to arrest. Professor Bowley's estimates of the I94.I census reinforce the likelihood of this possibility. To-day it is my main concern to emphasise that the first task of the social biologist is not to advocate the sterilisation of the unfit, but to undertake the steri- lisation of the instruments of research before operating upon the body politic. With that end in view I would insist that social biology cannot isolate the problem of genetic variation in human communities from the biological interpretation of the most diagnostic peculiarities of the human species. In many direc- tions the social biologist must co-operate with the sociologist, the economist and the statistician, if we are to ascertain the signifi- cant factors which determine the growth of human populations. On the other hand social biology will not develop fruitfully if it isolates itself from the methods of experimental inquiry. By the very complexity of the genetic problem social biology is com- mitted to create a framework of biological research and teaching in which a new type of social psychology can develop. For the same reason it is entrusted with the experimental analysis of aspects of the physiology of reproduction too long neglected by medical science. Throughout the greater part of this address I have adopted an attitude of sceptical inquiry to bring into prominence the need for devising new methods of investigation. I would remind you in conclusion of Nietzsche's aphorism. " The most valuable knowledge is the knowledge of methods, and the knowledge of methods comes last." Astronomy, the most exact of the sciences, is also the oldest. It began in Babylon and Egypt at least six thousand years ago. 'We take an unduly cheerful view of the progress of human knowledge, if we expect to out- grow the phlogiston hypotheses of social science in a few genera- tions. Yet I cannot on that account take a dismal view of the future of social biology. If the new genesis of Darwin wounds our human vanity, the new apocalypse of Jeans unfolds a spacious prospect for the continued progress of scientific method. Human life has existed on this planet perhaps for a matter of five hundred thousalnd years. Civilisation has existed about five thousand years. The era of modern science extends back for about five hundred years. According to Jeans the physical condi- tion of this planet will support the existence of social scientists</page><page sequence="21">24 BRCONOMICA [BEsBRUARY for about five million million years ahead. In my introductory re- marks I asked you to take a generous view of the part which bio- logical science may play in bringing into being a new humanism which draws its inspiration from the adventure of scientific, dis- covery. If I have encouraged you to hope that the seed you have planted to-day will eventually grow into a great tree in which all the fowls of the air will make their nests, let me beg you in conclu- sion to take an astronomical view of the time which that seed may take to germinate. Let me ask you to cherish it tenderly while it is sending forth its first green shoots. If, on the other hand, you are inclined to regard this new departure with sus- picion, I have the assurance that I shall encounter in a school with an unique tradition of free inquiry the same cheerful toler- ance for my misguided optimism as I hope I shall extend to your legitimate distrust.</page></plain_text>
