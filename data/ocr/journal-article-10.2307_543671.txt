<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE APOCRYPHON OF JOHN* ANDREW K. HELMBOLD, Frederick College, Portsmouth, Virginia STUDENTS of Gnosticism will welcome this volume because it gives them access, for the first time in English, to the so-called "longer" version of the important Gnostic text which had been used, in part, as a source by Irenaeus in his great work against heresies. While the shorter version has been known in part since 1896 when Carl Schmidt announced its discovery, it was not edited until 1954.1 The "longer" version appears in two codices from Nag Hammadi, with the text in Codex II being better preserved than the text in Codex IV. Pahor Labib made the Coptic text of the Apocryphon available to a limited circle of scholars in his photographic reproduction of part of Codex II,2 but the text needed editing, which Giversen has done. The volume is divided into two parts. In Part I Giversen presents a brief introduction to Gnosticism and the manuscript find, a section dealing with the manuscript and the mechanical make-up of the Codex (which contains a number of other important works, including the Gospels of Thomas and Philip), and the paleography and language of the text, followed by the text edition and translation itself and indexes of Greek and Coptic words and proper names in the text. PART I A. INTRODUCTORY MATTERS Omitting the introductory and mechanical matters, we turn to the discussion of paleography. Basing his arguments primarily but not exclusively on paleography, Giversen argues for a much earlier date for the manuscript than what had been previously suggested. He places the Apocryphon between British Museum Ms. Oriental 7594 (Sahidic version of Deuteronomy, Jonah, and Acts), which Budge and Kenyon dated A.D. 340-350, and the Sahidic manuscript of Ecclesiasticus in Louvain, which Lefort dated at the end of the third or the beginning of the fourth century. Therefore, Giversen says the Apocryphon in Codex II dates somewhere around 330-340. Previously this reviewer had come to a similar conclusion based on linguistic evidence, for the text contains a number of archaic and Old Coptic forms.3 In discussing the dialectical influences at work in the manuscript, Giversen gives a * A review article devoted to Apocryphon Johan- nis: The Coptic Text of the Apocryphon Johannis in the Nag Hammadi Codex II with Translation, Introduction and Commentary.

Most of these are either Achmimic or Sub-Achmimic, with the latter predominating. He points out that in some cases well attested Sahidic forms are not used while the lesser known Achmimic or Sub- Achmimic form is employed. These dialectical peculiarities of the text are also found in the shorter version, BG 8502, published by Till. Perhaps more important than variant spellings are the variant morphological elements. Giversen lists some of these, but this list can be extended to include the following Achmimic forms: ntare, temporal prefix instead of the Sahidic ntere; tft, causative infinitive, 3rd plural instead of Sahidic treu; jnnft, neg. future instead of Sahidic je nnit; te, causative for Sahidic ti; are-na, II Future instead of Sahidic ere-na. The form nnft for neg. II Future is probably a conflate of Achmimic and Sub-Achmimic forms with the Sahidic negation. Four peculiarly Sub- Achmimic morphological forms are to be found in the text: trii, causative infinitive, 3rd plural instead of Sahidic treu; jesna, II Future; e8pe, conditional particle instead of Sahidic esje; ei for i when it follows another vowel. Giversen lists eleven new forms, although some of them are open to question. The qualitative form &amp;vs in 74, 27 and other passages may not be derived from 8'5 as Giversen suggests but from s858/1Ss, "be despised." The noun gibe, which Giversen lists as a doubtful variant of kipe, can perhaps be explained as a variant of Achmimic ekibe, "breast," at 64, 12 and other passages. He suggests that tome is a variant reading for Eoome at 76, 18, which I would accept. However, it is doubtful wheth6r &amp;5ce of 69, 2 is a variant of t5ce, "to join," as he suggests. BG 8502 does support this reading, but I prefer to translate "they buffeted" from ?556e, "to strike, beat." Rare or new forms which Giversen does not list include mouei, "a lion," 58, 9, cf. Manichaean Ps. Book, moui; sae, "beauty," 69, 20; 8ooue, "parching," 66, 5, previously unattested as a noun. B. TEXT EDITION The major portion of Part I is occupied with the text edition and the translation of the Apocryphon. Here Giversen makes a great contribution to the study of Gnosticism since his text is the result of careful comparison with the original manuscript which he examined in Cairo, and the judicious use of BG 8502 and the other copy of the shorter version found in Codex III, which follows BG more often than it does the longer version. Unfortunately, Giversen did not have access to Codex IV, which was now been pub- lished.4 At several points this text would have cleared up difficulties and assisted in reconstructions, as we shall point out at the appropriate points. The translation is in readable form despite the fact that English is not the author's native tongue. More important, it is quite reliable, especially when one recalls that it is a pioneer effort. The reviewer will have some suggestions to make regarding translation at various points. Turning to a consideration of the text edition, the reviewer would like to discuss it under four headings: (1) Reconstructions of lacunae, (2) Giversen's readings which are to be rejected, (3) Giversen's emendations which are to be adopted, (4) points at which Codex IV gives us the original reading. 4 Martin Krause and Pahor Labib, Die drei Ver- sionen des Apokryphon Johannes im koptischen Museum zu Alt-Kairo; Abhandlungen DAIK, Koptische Reihe, Band 1 (Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden, 1962). This includes the Apocryphon as found in Codices II, III, and IV.</page><page sequence="3">THE APOCRYPHON OF JOHN 261 1. RECONSTRUCTIONS OF LACUNAE Because of the fragmentary nature of the first seven pages of Codex II, of which two pages are in an exceedingly poor condition, the task of reconstruction of the text is most difficult at the crucial beginning. Unfortunately Codex IV is not of much assistance here because it has only fragmentary letters and words for the first two pages. How- ever, beyond that point it is of considerable help in reconstructing Codex II. The reviewer hopes to return at a later date to a publication of a full reconstruction of Plates 47 through 51, so will offer here only a few suggestions regarding these opening passages. (a) 48, 11 Giversen reads ekr] hote mprr i~s'mmo atieide; Krause, who also had access to the original manuscript, reads ko] nhote mi n[tk] flimmo atieidea. C IV reads ko n]hote mi ntk [~s'mmo (3, 3 f,). In a footnote to this passage I suggest reading eko] nhote mi n[g 55pe] ausmmo.... I prefer to follow C IV for the sense of the passage, although my copy of the photographic edition seems to read au'mmo. The lacunae in the preceding and following lines have more space than Krause's suggested n[tk] would take, although it is partly corroborated by C IV. Giversen says his readings on this page are conjectures. (b) 48.26, 27 Giversen makes no attempt to restore this long lacuna. In C IV Krause reads (3.25-27): [ntof ethoo]p n[niite au5 nei5t] m [pt]jrf pe [pna nahoratos eti]oop. . . . BG 8502 reads: pni[te mmie sic. 1. au3] pei5t mpt rf pe [pna etou]aab piatnau erof [pets'oop.... Where the lacuna in C IV is so extensive, it would seem safe to use the help that BG can offer. Hence the passage can conceivably be reconstructed as follows: [efo gar mpnite mmrie] au5 neiSt mp [tirf pepna pahorat]os etioop.... Then one would translate: ["For he was the God of Truth] and the Father of the [All, the invisible Spirit] existing over the All." Krause's edition of C II is almost the same, reading [ntof pe pniite mme]e au5 neiSt mp [tirf pepna nahorat]os etioop.... (c) 48.31 Giversen makes no attempt at restoration here. However, C IV reads (4.4, 5) after nsaf (C II, line 30) as follows: nt[of gar pepna] nahoraton ns-[fe an emeeue]. On that basis he reconstructs C II to read in the lacuna: [tof pe pepna] na [horato]n nsse an . . ., "He is the invisible spirit." (d) 51.3, 4 Giversen admits that his reading here is a conjecture. ouaat[f ftta 5nh an iaian p]e ebol je frXre[ia nlaau an ntof ga]r ijdk tirf. Krause, C II, reconstructs it as follows: ouaatf [ifta eneh p]e ebol je frXre [nanh an ntof g]ar Uidjk tirf. I had adopted this reconstruction of line 4. C IV, which has an added clause, substantiates this reading (4.9-11): n [ouaaf ?Tia eneh pe] [nto]f ouaaf f[rXria mmoi an] ebol [je frXre nanh an ntof] gar iuj*k. Here C IV seems to be closer to BG than it is to C II, although the fragmentary nature of C IV at this point forbids an absolute conclusion. Yet the two texts appear to be very close in this passage. BG does contain C IV's frXria nlaau an just before the clause ntof gar fatjokf (sic!), which is probably the reason why Giversen adopts it. However, I think it would be better to follow the lead of C IV here, omitting its conflate clause. Giversen's restoration has the added disadvantage of being too long for the lacuna. (e) 51.9 Here Giversen would have been helped if C IV had been available. Instead of reading iathep [pe ebol je, C IV (4.18) makes it clear that the correct reading is a longer one: tathet] hotf [pe ebol je. The key first word in the lacuna of C II is quite clear in C IV. Then one would translate, "An unfathomable One is He because..."</page><page sequence="4">262 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES 2. RECONSTRUCTIONS AND READINGS REJECTED (a) 54.1 I do not think there is room here for his reading of mpna etgaumftte tbarbVlS. Krause reads mpna etsEp mn tei b[a]rbi~l, then suggests it should read etses, "the equal spirit." C IV (8.29) has a lacuna here, but Krause supplies the word etsis. The word is part of the context here (cf. 54.14). I would leave it as an unresolved difficulty. (b) 54.22 Giversen's restoration here of ntif [ete tefpronoia] is open to question. C IV reads ntefpronoia ete then breaks off. Perhaps the lacuna reads exactly as C IV, although it seems a bit long. C II's ntif is a mistake for ntef. (c) 52.24 This passage clearly reads ntif, not nhetf. Then one would translate "with the goodness of sealing." (d) 58.9 Giversen's reading of nefballe as plural, "his eyes," is probably to be rejected. Both Krause and I read nefbal de, which Giversen suggests as a possibility in a footnote. (e) 60.18 f. The marginal gloss at this point is very difficult to read. Giversen brings it into the text and reads it as follows: tmehsomt nite tmentn'tte hatn. This reading seems too long: the n'fte is probably not in it. Perhaps it would be better to read the text here as C IV (19.19) does: [tme]hvomet de [te tmntnitte]. (f) 62.29 Giversen's attempted restoration of pou [oein ntp]e is not supported by C IV (23.8) which reads peh[e]b[s] nte[f. I think the photo reads peu, not pou, and that the lacuna is longer than the three letters Krause allots it (although C IV favors that length), but shorter than the seven letters Giversen gives it. (g) 71.17-20 is regarded as a dittography by Giversen, but Krause and I regard the whole passage beginning with line 16 as a dittography of lines 12-14. (h) 71.22 should read mpesita, "her defect," instead of mpevta, "the defect." (i) 76.23 Here the question is one of word division. Is it to be read, as Giversen does, au5 poua mn tmrre, "and blasphemy and the chain .. .," or to be read au&amp; poua mntmrre, "and every thralldom of forgetfulness," as Krause and I suggest ? (j) 79.12 should be emended to read et(t)bbju, not as Giversen etbbeu. The qualitative form indicates the root is causative, tbbo, "to purify," not from ouaab, "to be pure." C IV has the correct reading here. 3. EMENDATIONS ACCEPTED Evidently the text of C II has been faithfully transmitted as compared with many ancient manuscripts, but there are points where the scribe or copyist made errors. Giversen has recognized a number of these and made the following necessary corrections: 55.7 where the addition (au5 afaheratf), ("and he stood up"), is needed; 55.32 where (afou5nh&gt;, ("he revealed"&gt;, is necessary; 58.24 where Giversen suggests &lt;nhnke topos), ("in some other places"&gt;, is supported by BG and C III. The lines are missing in C IV. At 58.26, with some hesitation, I agree with his emendation of tbmt to tame, although tdmt from t5mnt, "to be stupefied, amazed," does make sense; 59.5 needs to be emended to nrro(ii) oua kata with the (two Coptic) letters in brackets lost by haplography. Again C IV has the line missing. Only once do I find Giversen's emendation to be in error. This is at 74,10 if. where he conjectures that the copyist omitted some words after ejSii. His restoration of (senaiijaei haS pejaf naei je nai entafei ehrai ej"a) is now to be replaced with the reading of C IV (40.24-26): senalo[op tOn a]fouS[ib p]ejaf nai [je ef~]anei ehrai</page><page sequence="5">THE APOCRYPHON OF JOHN 263 e[j]53i n6i. Then one would translate, beginning with line 9 and including the missing lines, as follows: "'Those over whom the spirit of life has come down, where shall they be?' He answered, he said to me, 'those upon whom he is wont to come, namely, the spirit...' " Krause does not include the missing words in his edition of C II but notes that they are missing due to homoiteleuton. Working without C IV Giversen and this reviewer saw that something must be supplied, but C IV shows that our guesses were in error. Before leaving the matter of textual readings, one should point out that Giversen very cautiously consigns all emendations and questionable restorations to his footnotes. Perhaps he is overly cautious in this respect. Now a full text-critical edition of the longer version is needed. 4. HELP FROM CODEX IV In addition to the passages mentioned under previous headings, C IV would verify some readings where Giversen has doubts. At 59.18 he reads ap[ono]ia, but all the missing letters of C II are in C IV. Giversen's restoration of 62.28 as afr [ouoein] is substantiated by C IV's 23.7: [r ou]oein. At 65.35 Giversen restores pj[n]f and remarks on p. 249 that at this point "a conjecture must be made with extreme caution." However, C IV's reading [pj&amp;]nf combined with C II gives us four of the five letters of the word. C. TRANSLATION On the whole, the English translation given in this volume is a commendable work. When one pioneers in publishing an untranslated work (especially in a language which is not his native tongue), minor defects are likely to appear. However, these are insig- nificant in comparison with the contribution that the work makes to the study of Gnosticism and the Apocryphon. The translations of Krause and the reviewer (which is unpublished) suffer just as much, or more, in this respect than does Giversen's work. Having said this, one can turn to details of his translation. First, attention can be called to three passages where his translation is to be commended. At 59.5 his rendering of ehrai ejn as "up to" instead of "over" seems worthwhile. On the same page, 59.27 if. he translates ho as equal to Greek. 7rpoaow7rov = 1opi , "shape." I had translated this word in this context as meaning "aspect." Both translations give the substance of the author's meaning. At 61.22 f. he translates the phrase pji entafjitf n'i pess're, "the robbery which her son had committed." This seems preferable to Krause's "the defection (or apostasy) which he had brought." 1. DOUBTFUL TRANSLATIONS Points at which Giversen's translation is doubtful or in error seem to be the following: (a) 54.12 pefprre, which he translates "his spark," should be "his brightness." (b) 54.14 The word which Giversen translates "blessed" is an abstract noun, so should read "blessedness." (c) 56.1 It is questionable whether or not de serves as a copula between erof and Jomt. Krause and I understand it as a mild adversative introducing the next sentence, in which the verb to be is to be supplied. (d) 56.34 The continuous overscoring would indicate a proper name. Since, in this</page><page sequence="6">264 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES text all other uses of the verb "to name" followed byje have the name given immediately, it seems more likely that pigera is a proper name, even though its significance or source is unknown at this time. (e) 57.10 The words mn nai5n pijoInt, which are translated by Giversen "and the eternal three;" I think should be translated "and the aeon; the Three. .. ." The context indicates this is the way the passage is to be understood. The Gnostic Trinity is the Father, the Mother, the Son. (f) 58.7, 8 Giverson takes apesous' as an adverbial clause, "with her will." However, a is better understood as introducing the direct object and translated: "When she saw her desire (i. e. Yaldaba~th), he was in an altered, dragon type." Krause here translates as Giversen. (g) 60.27,31 Giversen seems to understand nnatpe as preposition, plus possessive article, plus definite article, plus noun. Krause and I translate as preposition, plus plural article, plus privative, plus noun. Our rendering would be "the glory of the non- heavenly." (h) 62.2-4 The lines "praised for her sake the invisible, virginal spirit," do not reflect the text, which reads aueine mnismit ehrai haros, "they brought a blessing upon her." The usual word in this text for "praise" is tieou, not eine smfi; haros means "upon her," not "for her sake." (i) In the long passage dealing with the creation of the body, 63.29 through 65.6, Giversen takes the proper names as preceding the verbs, which one would expect in normal syntax. Following Giversen's translation there is left over a "creator," labernioum, with no object of his creation. However, the enumerations at 65.10 ff., where the powers follow the names of the part of the body, e.g. tape men diolimodraza, and also the enumerations at 65.32 ff. and 66.6 f. would indicate that normal syntax is to be dis- regarded and the names taken as being in apposition to the parts created. (j) 65.31, 32 The seven proper names here are divided by Giversen into Michael, Uriel, Asmenedes, Sapha, Satoel, Aarmuriam, and Richramamiorps. Krause and this reviewer combine the fourth and fifth of these and divide the last name into two: Richram, Amiorps. I suggest the latter possibility in a footnote. Further light and attestation of these names from other sources may clear up the problem. Evidently Giversen thinks the continuous overscoring indicates one name. However, overscoring in this passage is carelessly done. (k) 71.20 f. Giversen translates the adversative de as "namely." This avoids a dif- ficulty in the understanding of the passage, since "sister" then refers back to "fellow" of line 15, i.e. the consort of Adam. Krause and I think a copula fell out of this passage and would restore a translation as follows: "But our Sister is the Sophia. . . ." Unfor- tunately, there is a lacuna at this point in Codex IV, while the "shorter" version of C III and BG omits the passage entirely. (1) 73.32 f. Giversen translates au&amp; tmntatsi nte ptirf ense, "or insatiability; all this will not. . . ." However, it seems clear that the construction is not nte plus ense (for normal nse), i.e. the conjunctive tense, but rather a negative circumstantial of the Ist present.5 Therefore translation of the passage reads: "and insatiability of the All. They - This construction has been confirmed by H. J. Polotsky.</page><page sequence="7">THE APOCRYPHON OF JOHN 265 are not. . . ." A similar construction occurs in lines 28 and 29 where Giversen allows ense to be conjunctive (indicated by his "and") but treats the preceding nte as genitival. (m) 79.20 Here Giversen's translation of the passage as "and then you shall come into existence awakening from the heavy sleep" is not justified. This verb is not future tense, but a conjunctive connected (as also the three verbs preceding it) with taounk of line 14. Therefore translate as an imperative, "And be awake from the deep slumber." Krause also has difficulties here, translating it "und sie, indem du dich vor dem Schlaf, der tief ist, hiitest.. .. " (n) 79.21 The word cales has caused considerable difficulty. Giversen says it equals calej and translates "entanglement." Krause translates "Miihle" (part of a mill). How- ever, it should be pointed out that the noun from the root volj, "to be entwined," is masculine, while the feminine article is used in the passage under consideration. Also, a shift of j to s seems highly questionable. I think this word is a dialectical variant of the fem. noun derived from 551le, "to swathe or clothe." The noun is attested in Sahidic as co(o)les and is used to translate the LXX of Isa. 47:2 Ka-raKaAv/IWa. The motif of the body's being a garment, which parallels the soma/sema theme, is quite common in Gnostic terminology. The following work in Codex II, the Gospel of Thomas, mentions divesting one's self, obviously referring to freeing of the soul of its bodily hindrances.6 2. TRANSLATIONS REJECTED At several places Giversen's translation is definitely misleading. Some of these are the following: (a) 48.33 The phrase ntof gar, which Giversen translates "because," should be trans- lated as disjunctive, "rather." Another example of this is 50.4. (b) 54.24 The translation "from himself" is based on a misreading of the text as nhitf, probably on the basis of C III's &lt;m)min mmof. The noun may come from the root t55be, "to seal," and mean "of sealing," or from the noun tif, "spittle." (c) 65.9 Giversen translates "But (U') those which partially (Kar piE'pos) are working in the limbs (pjdAoS):. . . ." Why the word "partially" when in 67.9 he translates Kacra ?dAos "limb for limb ?" Here the translation should be "part by part." Krause renders it "im einzelnen." An interesting parallel is Heb. 9:5, which RSV renders "in detail." (d) 66.13 Giversen translates "and she will enjoy the substance, for (ydp) they are nourished of this." Krause and I translate, "And this one, truly, is the Matter, for by her are nourished the four chief daemons." We read tai name te thule where Giversen reads tai namete thule. Then he takes the pro. suffix on the following hitoots to refer to thule instead of to tai (i.e. the Mother). (e) 69.36 f. Giversen renders this passage: "And it gives fruit of the darkness which they taste; their dwelling place is Amente. . . ." Perhaps my translation, agreeing with Krause, would be better: "It bears fruit in the darkness. Those who taste of it, their dwelling place is in the underworld." (f) 72.13 f. The passage ntares mme de nii tpronoia mpterf, which Giversen translates "when the Pronoia knew everything," should, perhaps, be read, as Krause also suggests, "when the Forethought of the All knew .. ." 6 Logion # 37, The Gospel According to Thomas, edited by A. Guillaumont, H.-Ch. Puech, G. Quispel, W. Till, and Yassah cAbd al Masih (Leiden, 1959), p. 23.</page><page sequence="8">266 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES (g) 76.28 f. The translation "they should not know God who is in the heaven of all these," should probably be read, as Krause does, "they should not know God who is above them all." (h) 78.3 Giversen translates mmee as "knowledge," but it seems better to take this, as Krause does, as "truth." (i) 79.1 Giversen's footnote here suggests "I filled up the treasure" (aho) as an alternate to his translation, "I filled my face (paho). On the basis of Manichaean parallels I prefer the former, admitting, of course, that this is fraught with danger. (j) 79.5 Giversen translates the words pets6tm tooun "He who hears, let him rise up." I prefer to translate the first word as a vocative (cf. line 8) and the imperative as direct address. Then the translation would read, "0 Hearkener, arise!" Logion # 24 of the Gospel of Thomas and Rev. 2:7 are instructive parallels. 3. IMPROVED TRANSLATIONS In a number of passages the exact nuance of certain words could be improved. Giver- sen's translation is not in error but does not convey the fine shades of distinction which can, possibly, be made at the following points: (a) 66.4 Instead of "heat, cold, moisture, dryness," I would translate, in keeping with the context, "a fever, a cold, a chill, a parching." Krause's translation is similar. (b) 66.30 f. The word iik5r' literally means "flattery," but in this context I would like to suggest, with some trepidation, the closely related idea of "cajolery." (c) 69.23 Giversen's translation of nattalUo as "lethal poison" would be improved by the more literal "irremedial poison." (d) 76.25 f. The translation of hor8 literally as "heavy" gives an adjective which is not normally used in English with "commands" and "sins." Better usage would be "grave" or perhaps "weighty." 4. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS Several other features of Giversen's work of translation demand attention. First, there is a general tendency to string sentences together into long, rambling units rather than separating them into short statements. This may be due, in part, to the use of the paratactic kai (Kalt), and, in part, to the document's extensive use of second tenses which frequently demand some sort of connection with the dominant clause. Second, in trans- lating these second tenses Giversen does not always give them the relationship to the main clause which they should have. Random examples of treating the II Present as co-ordinate, even supplying the copula "and," are to be found at 55.2, 57.7, 78.26. Third, Giversen's translation of 72.15 omits the phrase "from Eve" which should follow the words: "They wrested ZS6 (Life) .. ." Lest the above listing of doubtful translations, translations rejected, and suggestions for improved translations be misconstrued as a wholesale criticism of the work being reviewed, let it be said that these are no more than what one would expect in a pioneer work. One need only compare variant translations for the Gilgamesh Epic or the Ugaritic texts to see Giversen's work in true perspective. The reviewer has improved his own translation at many points through the help which Giversen affords.</page><page sequence="9">THE APOCRYPHON OF JOHN 267 Part I closes with copious indexes of Coptic words, Greek words, and proper names found in the text. PART II In this section of the work, the author gives a resume of the contents of the Apocry- phon, a running commentary on the treatise, and a study of the relationship of the different versions of the Apocryphon. The resume is noteworthy because of the excellent skeletal outline of the treatise which it presents. Unfortunately the typography of the volume does not make this outline stand out. A. THE COMMENTARY Before turning to specific details of the commentary, which occupies 125 pages, a few general remarks are in order. First, Giversen makes good use of the Coptic biblical texts in illuminating the meaning of various Coptic words and compares the original Greek behind those texts. Second, he utilizes the older Coptic Gnostic materials from Codex Bruce, Pistis Sophia, etc. to elucidate the Apocryphon. Third, his splendid outline is carried through the commentary and helps one to find one's way through the maze of Gnostic thought. On the negative side one would note that Giversen neglects the com- parative material from the closely related "gnostic" (note small g)7 groups such as Mandaeans and Manichaeans (especially the Psalm-book) which would help one under- stand the Apocryphon. Granted that this material is later than the Apocryphon, and that there is danger in "parallelomania," it is still valuable because both groups evidently are heavily dependent upon second century "orthodox" Gnosticism. It is to be regretted that Giversen's commentary "tails off" after 70.28. Now, from a wealth of fruitful suggestions which he makes, a few can be presented for further discussion: (1) Arimanios (47.8) is discussed on pp. 152 f. Giversen points out that Plutarch (Moralia, iv.1) discussed Zoroaster's contrast of god and daemon: Oromasdes and Airmanios. Since in the Apocryphon, Arimanios' insinuations are countered by the Savior who soon appears to John, the contrast of God and demon is continued. Further confirmation, Giversen says, is found in the mention of the Book of Zoroaster later in the Apocryphon (67.7-9). (2) Barbil1 (52.36. and passim) has been the object of much conjecture as to its etymology and meaning. Giversen discusses this name extensively on pp. 165 ff. In ruling out Burkitt's suggestion that it came from Egyptian belbile,8 Giversen says this is impossible because Coptic did not exist when the Apocryphon was written. The argument is negated by the fact that Late Egyptian did exist, and Coptic did not, like Minerva, spring full armed from the head of Zeus. I would rule out Burkitt's suggestion on other grounds, namely sound shifts. Coptic belbile from Late Egyptian blbil.t follows a pattern seen also in such words as maa8e, pas', s3t. This does not account for the long vowels e 7 For recent discussions of the importance of dis- tinguishing Gnosticism proper from more or less closely related movements, cf.

The only other etymology Giversen proposes is that suggested by Harvey9 and adopted by Hilgenfeld1o and Leisegang11 that Barb?l5 means "in four is God." He inclines toward the proposal of J. Matter (recorded in Harvey) that the name means "daughter of the Lord." He ignores the suggestion of Dr. Hort 12 that the name may come from L3~_, and Bousset's idea 13 that it is related to rapO'vos. I would also rule these out. However, more serious is his neglect of Gressmann's suggestion14 that Barb~l5 is derived from the Semitic preposition = plus the place name, Arbela, and refers to Ishtar of Arbela. The name Arbela could derive from original Akk. 'arba 'ilu, hence Harvey's suggestion does have some basis. The fact that there are so many Semitic names in the Apocryphon would lead one to think that Barbla1 also is Semitic. (3) Deserving of further study is his treatment of the words eiorm/eiarme found first at 51.36. He discusses this under 62.30 where the latter form is found, with C III and BG reading at the same place kataneue. This rare Coptic form is also found at 68.32 where it must mean "stare, look." Krause, I believe, is correct in seeing it also in the lacuna of 54.35. The more common form at 51.36 must also mean to "stare, look." However, all further usages in C II of the word seem to convey the meaning it must have in 62.30, i. e. "to nod assent." He cites an isolated case of Prov. 4:25 where eiarm means "to assent" and translates the LXX VEVEL. Open to question is his statement: "This word VEV'Et could have been the basis for both C II's ei6rme (C II 62, 30) and BG's and C III's aTdattly (BG 48, 6; C III 22, 1) since it could have the meaning of stare as well as approve." Liddell and Scott's Intermediate Greek Lexicon gives one meaning for the Greek which might lend itself to this interpretation, namely, "to bow the head, bend forward." However, it seems a long way from that to "stare." The use of by-forms has several parallels in this text, cf. 73.18, i5tUbe for i?24b. (4) Elalath (56.18), the name for the fourth great light, is discussed at length by Giversen (p. 185). He cites other and variant forms of the word in Charlotte Baynes' A Coptic Gnostic Treatise, (LXI, 3) and W. E. Crum's Catalogue of the Coptic Manuscripts in the British Museum (# 1003). Among the etymologies of the word which he presents are those proposed by Harvey (Adv. Haer.) as = KaIprros, "fruit," or possibly the variant eleO = EOrT7Sg, "Deity." He notes Baynes' query (p. 190) whether or not it might be a variant of Lilith. However, I think Giversen is pursuing the right source of the name when he suggests that it may come from 9 '0, "to be light." There is some difficulty with such a seghollate noun's having long vowels in Coptic, but this area of sound shifts from Semitic to Coptic, or Semitic to Greek then to Coptic, is still an unexplored area. Since the other three lights bear Semitic names one would expect the name of the fourth light also to be derived from a Semitic source. Going a step farther than Giversen, one might suggest that there is some connection with Hl1el of Isa. 14:12. (5) Yaldaba6th (58.19 and passim), the central character of the Apocryphon has been well known from other documents. Many varied opinions have been advanced concerning the derivation of this name. Giversen (pp. 199 ff.) takes his cue from the variant spellings in C II and suggests that the form used in the latter part of the treatise altaba56 (67.29) 9 W.

He suggests that this older form comes from 1ilRUP ?, "God of the desires," citing the passage 57.28 where it is said of his mother, "She wished to reveal. . . ." The newer form, ialdaba56, he associates with inNr ?N r , "ruler of the God of desires." In support of this he quotes a passage from BG 51.3 where Yaldabaath is called piarXan nte pepriinikos, "the Archon of the desires." However, BG may simply be referring to the fact that Sophia's offspring was produced as the result of her desire. Before turning to alternate explanations, one might note that the latter half of C II contains a number of divergent spellings, indicating the possibility that it came from a different copy than the former half, so perhaps too much importance can be attached to the variant forms of Yaldabaith. Giversen says J. Matter15 was the first to propose the etymology nlinl rT?, "child of Chaos." This is certainly to be preferred to Burkitt's attempt to relate Yaldabaith to ia5 saba56.16 Not to be ruled out is the proposal that it may come from yeled plus some form of the verb xi., "to go," i.e. "the child who traverses."17 However, the bulk of opinion seems to lean toward Matter's view, which has been adopted by J. Gieseler,18 Hilgenfeld,19 W. F. Albright,20 and Leisegang,21 among others. In personal correspond- ence, Professor Albright says: "During the past year (1960) I have discovered new data which confirm this etymology in the most decisive way." If this be the case then Giver- sen's assent to F. M. M. Sagnard's comment,22 "En realite on ignore l'origine de ce nom," is to be reconsidered. Giversen rejects Matter's proposal on the basis of context not suiting the name, "son of Chaos." Perhaps he is being too literal here, for "son of Belial" does not mean "descendent of Belial" but one characterized and dominated by Belial. He also rejects Harvey's suggestion that Yaldaba6th stems from Chaldee (Aramaic) nlltbT l ~ on the same grounds, i.e. that in the text Yaldaba6th does not play a decisive role as "the Lord God of the Fathers." One note of caution ought to be spoken at this point. In view of the rather common ending of the form a5O in Coptic Gnostic and magical texts of this era23 perhaps one should be careful about accepting any etymology which will not apply to them all. For the present Matter's suggestion seems the most satisfactory. (6) Melcheirad5nein (59.2) does not have the first i in my photocopy of the text, although there may be space for it. Both Giversen and Krause do read it. This spelling may affect the interpretation of this name. In BG and C III the name is simply adanin, Adonis. Giversen discusses the name (p. 211), assuming that the first part of the name is the Semitic melek. He cites a first century work24 dealing with the Zodiac in which a constellation is mentioned as Ev o0pav65 KEaAl 8acw' , ol AEyd0OLEVOL BauLA' 1TE KCai "ASwwvS. Giversen says that under this (11th) constellation Adonis is often associated with Aphrodite in other texts. Aphrodite is a netherworld god.

Perhaps one can go a step farther and see in the first part of this name a late reproduction of the Phoenician milcart, the God of the underworld.25 (7) The 365 (360) angels (59.22-25). Lest one gain the impression that Giversen is concerned' only with linguistic and etymological matters, it should be noted that he offers many suggestions on interpreting the text. This is true of his explanation of the differences between the number of angels who create Adam's body in C II (365 angels) and the number in BG and C III (360 angels). His conclusion (pp. 216-18) is not convinc- ing to this reviewer. He says the larger number is based on the astronomical year of 365 days, while the smaller number is based upon the civil year of 360 plus five epagomens. He thinks the shorter number is also to be connected with the 360 degrees of the zodiac with 36 decans each ruling 10 degrees. Commendable is Giversen's reproduction of Till's explanation of how the total of 365 was reached.26 (8) Sophia's irresistible power (58.1). Giversen offers (p. 195) a worthwhile explana- tion of why C II's tcom de natjro eros is at variance with BG's pritnikon, "lustful, pas- sionate," or C III's pebrfirikon. He believes C III's reading to be either a mistake for prifnikon or a deliberate alteration of that word to Greek bpopLKd'S, "of, for a guard." Irenaeus (Harvey, Adversus Haereses i. 29, 4) supports BG. Giversen explains the dif- ference between C II and the other two texts as follows: "This feature distinguishes the entire portrayal of C II's AJ: it presents an exalted and much less anthropomorphic portrayal of the world of light in comparison with BG's and C III's AJ." This idea he repeats several times and regards as a clue to the age of the two different recensions. Unfortunately, the entire passage is missing in C IV because the manuscript is damaged. Many other fascinating points of his commentary could be discussed, but it is better to leave some discoveries to the reader, hoping that enough has been said to interest other scholars in reading Giversen's work. B. THE VARIOUS VERSIONS OF AJ One of Giversen's most important contributions to the study of the Apocryphon is his discussion of the relationship of the various manuscripts of the text to each other. Unfortunately, since C IV was not accessible, he could not include it in his discussion. Since C IV and C II are almost identical, this omission is not serious. Giversen's conclusions are interesting. He feels that the common tradition of the three texts is more important than the "specific material" of C II (and C IV). It is his opinion that all three texts of AJ are copied from earlier Coptic texts (Till expressed the same view about BG 27). He believes the errors in copying indicate a written prototype rather than one scribe reading to another. Giversen advances some interesting ideas concerning which of the three texts is earliest. He does not believe any one of the three is a copy, in a relatively pure line of tradition, of the Ur-text. He does think that C II is closer to the original form, with BG and its related C III being abridgements. In this judgment I would concur. Professor Puech has come to the same conclusion.28 Jean Doresse thinks the long passages peculiar to 25 Cf. W. F. Albright, Archaeology and the Religion of Israel (Baltimore, 1942), p. 81 and note 29, p. 196. 26 Till, op. cit., pp. 42-43. 27 Op. cit., note, p. 12. 28 Henri Charles Puech, "Les nouveaux ecrits gnostiques decouverts en Haute-Egypte," Coptic Studies in Honor of Walter Ewing Crum, ed. by Michael Malinine (Boston, 1950), p. 104.</page><page sequence="13">THE APOCRYPHON OF JOHN 271 C II are "Glosses Personnelle." 29 Giversen's thesis is supported by a hitherto un-noted fact: the names of the angels over the various parts of the body and the passions in the long passage found in C II do not contain any Coptic letters borrowed from Demotic. Most of these names are distinctly Greek, pointing to the fact that the longer version existed already in a Greek original. A possible debateable point is Giversen's contention (p. 278, cf. p. 280) that C II's "distinct tendency toward emphasizing the sublime and playing down the anthropo- morphic elements" shows that BG and C III "must at times be regarded as somewhat more reliable in terms of content." One needs only to remember the long arguments over anti-anthropomorphisms in the LXX to be cautious at this point. Giversen cites a number of passages where the divergences from BG and C III lead him to think C II is the original and the other two are shortened versions of the Apocry- phon rather than C II's being an expanded version as Doresse implies.30 He says the shortening is of an editorial rather than a didactic nature. The extended passage in C II (63.29-67.10) he considers to be a wholesale importation from the Book of Zoroaster, as the context almost implies. This importation, Giversen says, occurred about the same time as the tendency to play down the anthropomor- phisms began to be felt. His thought is that all "earthly and human qualities are diminished, and the point of gravity is referred to the world of superhuman beings" (p. 281). On the matter of Greek originals, Giversen believes that BG and C III, despite their similarity, each had a separate Greek source, and that C II had a third Greek source a few links farther back on the stemma. Not all will agree with his literary criticism; in fact others have already argued for contrary viewpoints.31 Rudolph Kasser, in two articles which the reviewer has not seen,32 argues that the longer version (C II) was once the shorter and the earliest. He believes the central part of the work consisted of a com- mentary on Genesis with the prologue and other parts added later. It will be interesting to await reactions to these variant theses. Perhaps the day will soon be at hand when a critical edition, utilizing the other Sethian texts from Nag Hammadi, and Irenaeus, as well as the four texts of AJ, can be attempted. Any volunteers ? C. OTHER ITEMS Giversen concludes his volume with an appendix giving the Latin text of Irenaeus, Adversus Haereses i. 29 (Mausset) as established by Harvey. Another appendix gives a brief resume, in Danish, of Giversen's work. The volume concludes with what he calls a select bibliography. In reality, it is quite extensive, listing all the basic works on Coptic language, Gnosticism, the Nag Hammadi texts, and many works on related subjects. 29 Les livres secrets des Gnostiques d'Egypte (Paris, 1958), p. 219. 30 Secret Books of the Egyptian Gnostics (London, 1960), pp. 270 ff. 31 Cf.

It abounds in misprints, misspellings and mistakes in English usage. Most of these are easily unscrambled by the reader. It might be well to note a few of the more important ones. On p. 179, final paragraph, it should read CG II 55.30 (not 33, 30). On p. 194, line 3, the word is "called." On p. 201, next to the last line should read "BG and C III" (not C II). On p. 207 the word is "identification," (not indification). Read, on p. 212, "trance" (not "trace."). An important correction must be made on p. 235 where fiShe should read bihe. The reference on p. 240 to C II 62, 38 should read 62, 28. On p. 257, line 3, the word "beings" should read "begins." An important misunderstanding is the translation of the text, 49.11 (p. 53), which reads "quite" when it should be "quiet." One other technical matter deserves note: it was jarring to the reviewer to find the typescript constantly using Greek SQ where the manuscript uses the more normal Coptic 5. By way of summation, here is a work which is a "must" for serious students of the Nag Hammadi texts. It is a pioneer effort and bears the marks. It, along with Krause's editions of the three Nag Hammadi manuscripts of AJ and Till's edition of BG is an indispensable tool for the understanding of what was evidently a basic document of Sethian Gnosis. We pay tribute to Giversen for his labors.</page></plain_text>
