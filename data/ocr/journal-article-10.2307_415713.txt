<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK NOTICES will reduce their usefulness over time. Still, they will never be obsolete, because so many of the works referenced are part of the permanent literature. The text appears in a readable format that makes ample use of white space. Boldface, ital- ics, and capitals are used sensibly in a pleasant typeface; the quality of the paper and the bind- ing are quite good. Despite the price, the vol- umes are soft-bound. Our Vol. II arrived with pp. 541-56 missing. Linguistics is becoming an increasingly im- portant subfield within AI. The bibliographic summaries and cross-references are useful for pinpointing where the two fields come together. These summaries should also prove to be a val- uable reference aid to AI researchers in general, both in academia and in the commercial en- vironment. This well-organized, well-written work represents a prodigious and worthwhile effort. [ROBERT D. RODMAN &amp; DAVID KIRKS, North Carolina State University, Raleigh.] The meaning of primate signals. Edited by ROM HARRE &amp; VERNON REY- NOLDS. Cambridge: University Press; Paris: Editions de la Maison des Sciences de 1'Homme, 1984. Pp. xi, 257. Discussion of the communicative abilities of non-human primates runs from the nadir of R. L. Garner's The speech of monkeys (New York, 1892) to the zenith of D. L. Cheney's work on vervet monkeys (e.g. in Animal behavior, 1980 and 1982) and T. T. Struhsaker's (also on ver- vets in Social communication among primates, ed. by S. A. Altmann, 1967). On a contemporary level, I place the work of F. G. Patterson nearer the bottom, and this volume near the top. Growing out of a conference held in Bad Homburg in 1981, this volume contains 12 pa- pers-all interesting, though of varying quality. For linguists, the papers (and comments) in the section called 'Language and the description of communicating systems' (111-76) may well be the most interesting. I found particular value in E. ARDENER'S 'Ethology and language', and in the exchange between P. J. ASQUITH and R. HARRIS on anthropomorphism and use of the term metaphor. R. M. SEYFARTH'S paper on the meaning of primate signals to other primates and their meaning to humans is also of importance. The volume is well-printed and laid-out, with no obvious misprints. [PETER H.
