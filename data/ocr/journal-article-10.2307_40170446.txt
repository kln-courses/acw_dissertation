<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ancient Cultural Interplay of the American Southwest in the Mexican Northwest David R. Wilcox, Phil C. Wiegand, J. Scott Wood and Jerry B. Howard A basic question in Southwestern archaeology concerns the cultural con- nectivity of its prehispanic populations with their neighbors in Mexico. Were Southwestern populations culturally "autochthonous" after the introduction of cultigens and pottery, as A. V. Kidder (1924) famously argued, or were there far more complex and continuing relationships (Bandelier 1892; Haury 1945)? To what extent were their historical trajectories interlinked or interdependent? What were the parameters of their cultural connectivity? What is the status of these questions today? In an analysis of the history of debate about these questions, Wilcox (1986a) found that the strongest empirical support for cultural connectivity lies in the relationship of the southern Southwest and West Mexico.1 He also proposed a model, the "Tepiman connection," that postulated a continuous dialect chain of Tepiman speakers linking the Hohokam area in southern Arizona with the Chalchihuites and Teuchitlan regions in the south (Wilcox 1986b, 2000a, 2000b; figure 1; see also Weigand 1985, 2004; and Riley and Winters 1965). Subsequently, Don Fowler and David Wilcox (1999; Fowler 2000; Wilcox and Fowler 2002) added more time depth to the historical analysis, pointing to the fundamental importance of contribu- tions by Francesco Clavigero (1787), Alexander von Humboldt (1811), and Albert Gallatin (1845, 1848a, 1848b). Clavigero, later supported by von Humboldt, interpreted Aztec oral traditions to mean they had migrated to central Mexico from north of the Colorado River via the David R.

Gallatin, on the eve of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (in 1848), by which the northern half of Mexico was ceded to the United States and the "American Southwest" was born, argued that there was no hard evidence for linguistic connections to support this theory. The discov- ery of the Uto-Aztecan language family by the German linguist Johann Karl Buschmann (1853) - a discovery that one of the three fathers of American anthropology, Daniel Brinton (1891),2 soon accepted - was cited by von Humboldt (1858) as support for his theory. Later schol- arship held, however, that the Aztecs originated much closer to the Valley of Mexico (see, for example, M. Weaver 1981:418-21), though popular belief keeps Clavigero's hypothesis alive even today (Fields and Zamudio-Taylor 2001). Carroll Eiley (2005) has even rather whimsi- cally picked up on this to suggest the label "Aztlan" for the area of the North American Southwest that he argues was "Mesoamericanized" in the period 1200-1450 ce.3 In a stunning reversal of the Clavigero-von Humboldt model, Jane Hill (2001, 2002, 2006) argues on linguistic grounds for the sudden migra- tion northward of Uto-Aztecan speakers ca. 4,000 years ago. Against both views, Gregory and Wilcox (2007) argue that Uto-Aztecan differ- entiated largely in place, as a remnant of the hemisphere-wide Amerind language (Greenberg 1987, 1996; Ruhlen 1991), during Paleo-Indian times when what are today linguistic isolates like Zuni (Hill 2007) and small compact languages like Keresan and Tanoan first became distinct languages.4 According to this perspective, for ecological and historical reasons yet to be fully elucidated, communication links were maintained from north to south in the Uto-Aztecan dialect chain (see Miller 1984; Cortina-Borja and Valinas C. 1989 ).5 This would have facilitated the northward diffusion of cultigen seeds and knowledge of their use, inte- grating them into what are postulated to be already existing adaptations involving the use of the digging stick and the cultivation of small-seed plants (see Haury 1962; Bohrer 1991; Roney and Hard 2006). Adapta- tions brought about by the increasing importance of maize cultivation led to linguistic differentiation within Uto-Aztecan before ceramic technologies became generally adopted in the American Southwest ca. 1,800 years ago (Hill 2001). On a later time horizon, the movement of copper bells and scarlet macaws northward, and the reverse movement of</page><page sequence="3">Ancient Cultural Interplay &lt;■ 105 Figure 1. The Tepiman Connection (adaptation to a map from Sauer 1934). millions of pieces of turquoise southward, are material manifestations of the continuing importance of the Uto-Aztecan language chain both to Mesoamerica and to the American Southwest (Harbottle and Weigand 1992; Weigand and Weigand 2001; Wilcox 2002; see figure 2). Argu- ably, the Tepiman dialect chain survived these many millennia of cultural transformations (Wilcox 1986b; but see Berrojalbiz 2006). Testing such a hypothesis and its alternatives, however, remains a daunting task. Twenty years ago, Wilcox found that the huge area between the American Southwest and Central Mexico was, in large part, "archaeo-</page><page sequence="4">Figure 2. Generalized Routes for the Movement of Turquoise from the American Southwest to West Mexico (prepared by Phil C. Weijjand).</page><page sequence="5">Ancient Cultural Interplay * 107 logically unknown" and was an area "where much of the work that has been done addresses problems of pan-regional scale, involving connec- tions with the adjacent areas rather than indigenous local or regional processes" (Wilcox 1986a:9). The ways this differential knowledge skews our anthropological understanding is a methodological concern of great importance. It means, frankly, that we cannot yet test what could be legitimate alternative hypotheses, and thus any acceptance of local explanations centered either in the American Southwest or Northwest Mexico is logically premature. Secondly, our ignorance in this regard heightens the contrast in the nature of political organizations between the American Southwest and Mesoamerica. If political organizations formed a polythetic set,6 with complex state-level societies evolving in the far south in Mesoamerica, including West Mexico (Weigand 2007), and there were less complex states or statelike organizations between West Mexico and the American Southwest, were the societies in the latter area always so simple and egalitarian as many Southwestern archaeologists appear to believe (Cordell 1984; Reid and Whittlesey 1997)? Perhaps not. Carroll Riley's (1982, 1987) provocative model of "statelets" in central Sonora during the middle 1500s ce challenges us to reexamine the organiza- tion of societies in the southern Southwest during the preceding several centuries. By doing so, as we review in the second part of this essay, we can show that warring clusters of medium-to-large villages separated by buffer zones (such as he describes in central Sonora) also characterized the macro-regional settlement patterns of southern Arizona (Wilcox, Robertson, and Wood 2001a; Wilcox 2005b). In what sense any of these village-dusters may have been "states" or "statelets" should also be reevaluated. The cultural distance between the American Southwest and West Mexico was not as great as is often assumed. Much has been accomplished in the last twenty years toward filling the gap in anthropological knowledge about Northwest Mexico. In the first part of this essay, a brief review of the recent history of inquiry into the archaeology of this vast region helps to define the scholarly context of what is now known and what still remains to be discovered. We then turn, in the second part, to the question of political organization in southern Arizona. In the third, we reexamine the issue of "Whence the Hohokam" and a Tepiman hypothesis about their fate, thus arguing for a much closer connection between the culture history of the Hohokam and the "statelets" in central Sonora than has been previously recognized. Such a review of the current status of these important anthropological</page><page sequence="6">108 * Journal of the Southwest issues is timely, and is designed to sharpen general understanding about the state of play in scientific debates about them and the place of the American Southwest in the Mexican Northwest. Recent History of Archaeological Inquiry in Northwest Mexico7 In the 1930s, the Mexican government established three parks, at La Quemada, Alta Vista, and Casas Grandes, but the Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia (INAH) paid only sporadic attention to them before the 1970s. Serious anthropological attention to this area, however, began shortly after World War II when J. Charles Kelley organized an anthropology department at Southern Illinois University. Kelley's vision was to focus on the study of Mesoamerican-Southwestern connections. Led by Kelley, with Walter Taylor and Pedro Armillas as archaeologists; Charles Lange and Carroll Riley as ethnographers; two ethnohistorians; and support from Campbell Pennington in geography, Roger Hegler in physical anthropology, and George Fraunfelter in geology, a generation of students was trained and major advances in knowledge of this terra incognita were achieved (J. C. Kelley 1971). Those students include Phil Weigand, Joseph Mountjoy, James Schoenwetter, Richard Pailes (1980), Ellen Abbott (Kelley), Thomas Holien (1977), and Jonathan Reyman (1995). Some of them now have students who are also contributing to the archaeology of this area (Doolittle 1984, 1988; Reff 1981, 1991). By the early 1950s George Brainard at UCLA began a program in West Mexico soon taken over by Clement Meighan. Their students include Betty Bell, Stanley Long, Margaret Bond, Leonard Foote, and Peter Furst. Ecological studies were begun in the late 1960s by Stuart Scott in the Marismas Nacionales; his students include Michael Foster, George Gill, and Alex Schenkel. Fruitful collaborations between these students have long since begun (see Riley and Hedrick 1978; Foster and Weigand 1985; Foster and Gorenstein 2000). Today, most of the states in northwestern Mexico have an INAH office. Ongoing work along the northern edge of Mesoamerica is being accomplished by the various archaeology programs of local universities. The Universidad Autonoma de Zacatecas and the Universidad Autonoma of Aguascalientes, for example, both have active field programs in numer- ous localities in that region, although almost all of this work remains</page><page sequence="7">Ancient Cultural Interplay * 109 unpublished at this writing. Exciting new work is also being undertaken at the site of La Quemada by the American archaeologist Ben Nelson and his students (Nelson 1993; Nelson, Darling and Kice 1992), and Nelson has published an interesting comparison of complexity, hierarchy, and scale between La Quemada and Chaco Canyon (Nelson 1995). The new INAH regional centers in Durango, Chihuahua, Sonora, and other states farther south have created organizational frameworks that often include cooperative arrangements with several institutions in Europe and the United States. Taking advantage of these new opportunities, both Mexican and American doctoral students have begun to work in West and Northwest Mexico in increasing numbers. One of the first was Beatriz Braniff, who headed the INAH office in Hermosillo for a while in the 1970s (Braniff Conejo 1985). Braniff later was instrumental in the development of the Museo de Culturas del Norte, located at Casas Grandes, Chihuahua. Regional universities, such as the Universidad Autonoma de Zacatecas, the Universidad de San Luis Potosi, and the Centro Universitario Norte (Colotlan) of the Universidad de Guadalajara, recently have sponsored symposia featuring field reports by archaeologists researching the general area. These symposia are just now reaching publication. Thus, a whole new generation of archaeological monographs and reports will soon be available for various sections of the northern Mesoamerican frontier. For example, work by Geraldo Fernandez Martinez (2006), and Abigail Vasquez de Santiago and Enrique Perez Cortez (2006) at Ojocaliente, Aguascalientes, has been ongoing for several excavation seasons. They are documenting a small-scale Mesoamerican ceremonial center's transition to a more simplified (teochicbimeca) lifestyle that dates to ca. 1300 ce. Juan Ignacio Macias Quintero and Luis Felipe Martinez (2006) and Brenda Gonzalez Leos (2006) are also engaged in archaeological fieldwork in nearby areas of Aguascalientes. In Durango, after a hiatus of more than a half century, research has resumed. The new INAH project at La Ferreria (former known as the Schroeder Site, near Durango City) has re-excavated (and restored) many of the structures first explored by J. Charles Kelley (1971) during the 1950s. New areas have also been opened up. Kelley had suspected that the site was large and fairly complex, and these new studies affirm that inference. The large platform on the highest elevation of the site is now known to be a "patio hundido" of the variety seen at La Quemada and farther south in the Bajio. It is the Bajio that is the clear point of</page><page sequence="8">110 * Journal of the Southwest origin for most of the overall Chalchihuites Tradition (compare Cardenas 1997), with elements coming also from West Mexico. Central Mexico appears to have had extremely little input into the development of these cultural traditions. Unfortunately, very little of the new data from La Ferreria has yet been published. In northern Durango and southern Chihuahua, a team from the Universidad Autonoma Nacional de Mexico (UNAM), headed by Marie- Areti Hers, in collaboration with other archaeologists and institutions, has been active during recent years. She seeks to understand the nature of population dynamics and east- west exchange across the Sierra Madre via the Topia gateway. Some of this material is published: Hers (2007a, 2007b), Tsukada (2007), Punzo Diaz (2007), and Berrojalbiz (2007) are examples. Several highly dedicated avocationalists have also published the results of their investigations in Durango (Lazalde 1987, Ganot and Peschard 1997). These individuals have examined the greater Tepehuan and Xixime regions in great detail, re-examining many of the sites first mentioned by J. Alden Mason (1937) and Robert Zingg, plus finding, mapping, and excavating many more. The complexity of some of these sites is quite evident; most date to the Epi-Classic and Post-Classic periods. Viewing these areas along with La Ferreria and the rest of the Chal- chihuites Tradition (including the Chalchihuites region per se, La Quemada, and the Malpaso and Juchipila-Tlaltenango valleys), it is clear that there is no "empty space" between the extremely complex social systems of Jalisco, Michoacan, and the Bajio in the south, and the Casas Grandes region in the north. The new work in Durango and southern Chihuahua has the utmost importance for contextualizing the greater Mogollon zone within the cultural landscape of the eastern edge of the Sierra Madre Occidental. While many of Hers' conclusions and interpretations are questionable, the well-reported data sets from the UNAM team and its associates are invaluable. Thus, it is clear that there is no lack of complicated sites between Mesoamerica and the U.S. Southwest along this corridor. Most probably, there is no lack of an equivalent phenomenon along the Pacific coast corridor as well, though the archaeological resources of this zone have been vastly modified by mechanized agriculture and urbanization. While the monumental architecture of the types seen in southern Zacatecas and farther south are not present in Durango and southern Chihuahua, sub-monumental structures, evidence for specialization, and relatively dense demographic concentrations are all quite evident.</page><page sequence="9">Ancient Cultural Interplay * 111 Foreign missions are also working in West and Northwest Mexico. The Belgians (for example, Deltour-Levine et al. 1993) have worked extensively in the northern sector of the Sierra de Nayar, which is the southern end of the Sierra Madre Occidental. Marie-Areti Hers (1989), a former member of that team, has published her work on the Hue- juquilla and Tezompan sites in the same region. The French, under the OSTROM program, have excavated a series of sites in the Sayula-Atoyac basin during the 1990s (Liot 2000). An American, Elizabeth Mozzillo, a member of a Tulane expedition to Las Ventanas (aka Juchipila), has done important PhD research there. Some of her former students and associates are now active with projects of their own in the Caxcan region, including Nochistlan. No research program in northwestern Mexico has stimulated more interest, controversy, and scientific action than that led by the late Charles C. Di Peso (1974; Di Peso, Rinaldo, and Fenner 1974) for the Amerind Foundation, between 1958 and 1962, at Casas Grandes, which was magnificently published in 1974. Criticism, especially of his chronology, soon followed (Wilcox and Shenk 1977; McGuire 1980; LeBlanc 1980; Carlson 1981; Wilcox 1986a), and this set the stage for a new genera- tion of research in the region that has challenged many other aspects of Di Peso's model (Phillips 1989; Douglas 1992; Woolsey and Ravesloot 1993; Reyman 1995; C. Schaafsma and Riley 1999b; Whalen and Min- nis 2001; Hendrickson 2003; VanPool 2003; Riley 2005; VanPool and VanPool 2006). During the last twenty years an interesting series of collaborative expeditions has been organized in northern Mexico between INAH and U.S. scholars. In many cases an implicit strategy of working from the known to the unknown is apparent in these efforts. Thus American archaeologists who have worked in areas near the international border are now engaged in collaborative research immediately south of the border. Consider, for example, Randall McGuire, who began in the Papagueria (McGuire and Schiffer 1982) and is now working with Elisa Villalpando Canchola at Las Trincheras (see O'Donovan 2002); Jeffrey Altschul, whose surveys in the middle San Pedro Valley are now being extended into the upper reaches of that drainage through cooperation with Cesar Quijada Lopez (Altschul and Quijada Lopez 1996); and Michael Whalen and Paul Minnis, whose work in the south Texas and Mimbres areas, respectively, have led them to explore the region around Casas Grandes (Minnis and Whalen 1993; Whalen and Minnis 2001). Jane Kelley</page><page sequence="10">112 * Journal of the Southwest and Joe Stewart, who have worked extensively in southeastern New Mexico (Kelley 1984), have now investigated three neighboring districts south of Babicora (Kelley et al. 1999); Polly and Curtis Schaafsma have teamed up with Francisco Mendiola Galvan to record rock art sites in northern Chihuahua (P. Schaafsma 1998); and Timothy Maxwell and Robert Leonard have joined Rafael Cruz in studies of sites in the Villa Ahumada area. Robert Hard and John Roney (1998; Hard et al. 2006; Roney and Hard 2006) have explored the early agricultural site of Cerro Juanaquefia in Chihuahua and have been widening their comparisons of such "trinchera" sites in both Chihuahua and Durango. What is happening here (we may hope) is the creation of a "critical mass" of researchers interested in an area both for its own sake and for what light its study can shed on macro-regional processes. Because this area was so little known, a "gap" was said to exist. Gordon Ekholm ( 1942) was among the first to suggest that this putative desploblado, or "sea of chichimecs" (Mathien and McGuire 1986), between West Mexico and the American Southwest was crossed at great peril by traders in search of rare resources. Many versions of this idea have been and continue to be suggested (e.g., Ferdon 1955; Di Peso 1974; J. C. Kelley 1995; Braniff 2001). Today's crop of researchers are challenging the concept of a Gran Chichimeca, or are redefining it. Marie -Areti Hers and Oscar Polaco, at the 1991 International Congress of Americanists (Andrews and Mozzillo 1994:68), suggested that "the term chichirnechas outlived its usefulness as a referent to a specific stage of cultural development as well as to the geographic area of northern Mexico." At the 1996 Society for American Archaeology meetings a session on northwestern Mexico organized by John Carpenter and Elisa Villalpando was entitled "The Myth of the Chichimec Sea." Much more insight on the exciting new developments in the archaeology of West and Northwest Mexico (we trust) was on display at the 1996 Mesa Redonda meetings held in Tepic, Nayarit: the theme was Antropologia e Historia del Occidente de Mexico. The three recent international "Pathways to the Northwest" colloquia organized variously by the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Northern Arizona University, Mexico North Research Network, and the Hopi Tribe in 2001, 2004, and 2006 have also created a new basis for dialogue about anthropological research in this critical culture area (Bonfiglioli, Gutierrez, and Olavarria 2006). We find, however, that it would repay modern students to read the primary Spanish sources on northwestern Mexico with greater care. In</page><page sequence="11">Ancient Cultural Interplay * 113 Sahagun (Anderson and Dibble 1982), Zorita ([1565-71] 1999), and Duran ([1561] 1995), for example, they will find that "Chichimeca" is very clearly defined as those people, including the Tolteca, Choluteca, Tlaxcalteca, and Colhua Mexica themselves, who came originally from the "lineage of the dog," that is, the central-northern and northern areas of what today constitutes Mexico (Zacatecas, San Luis Potosi, Durango, etc.). The hunter-gatherers who inhabited part of the same general area were clearly called "teochichimeca." The Chichimec label thus included those inhabitants of the north engaged in various degrees of social complexity, including agriculture and sedentary lifestyles. As the Spanish wars of conquest proceeded in the north, along with the decimation by warfare, slave raids, and, mostly, diseases, the two terms (chichimeca and teochichimeca) became conflated to a degree. (See Car- rillo 1999 on the expansion through the Bajio of the Spanish conquest efforts, in collaboration with the Otomi.) The term "Chichimeca" is thus a perfectly good term if used as originally defined and intended. The highest standards of scholarship would demand that we read all the sources relevant to the anthropological problems we study, daunt- ing though that certainly can be, particularly when several languages are involved. Nevertheless, compared to twenty years ago, there is now a great increase in archaeological knowledge about Northwest Mexico ( Woolsey and Ravesloot 1993; Fish and Fish 1994; Fish, Fish, and Villalpando 2007; Reyman 1995; Nelson 1995; Foster and Gorenstein 2000; Braniff 2001; Weigand and Weigand 2001; Weigand and Garcia de Weigand 2001; Newell and Gallaga 2006; Webster and McBrinn 2008). Yet much more still remains to be done. Enormous areas have not yet received any but cursory archaeological attention. A case in point is Sinaloa where the Ortellius map of 1579 (figure 3), which Kelly (1945, pl. 12) published in her Culiacan report, continues to cry out for fresh archaeological evalu- ation. A very preliminary survey south of San Miguel Culiacan, Weigand believes, has confirmed the presence of prehispanic canal systems, some of which may have interconnected separate river valleys. Linear alignments of settlements on the Ortellius map appear to lie along major canals. If so - and much more archaeological research is needed here - the much- remarked "gap" between the irrigation systems of West Mexico and the Hohokam in southern Arizona may be more perception than reality. One wonders, too, how ancient irrigation technology might have been in the Yaqui-Mayo area.</page><page sequence="12">114 * Journal of the Southwest Figure 3. Ortellius Map ofSinaloa, 1579, Showing Possible Canal Routes (after Kelly 1945, pl. 12). Areas critical to the question of long-distance exchange between West Mexico and the American Southwest also remain terra incognita. The Chinipas area and much of central Sonora, for example, which are critical to the testing of Wilcox's (1986b) Tepiman hypothesis, are as mysterious today as they were twenty years ago. Yet theoretical interest in central Sonora and the Rio Yaqui drainage system remains high. Since the studies by Brand (1938) and Tower (1945) of shell exchange, the portrayal by Di Peso, Rinaldo, and Fenner (1974) of a route for bringing three mil- lion Nassarius shells to Paquime, and especially since the seminal study by Jett and Moyle (1986) of marine fish designs on Mimbres pots, the critical macro -regional importance of the archaeology of the Rio Yaqui has been clear (see also Bradley 1996). The assemblage of marine fish seen on Mimbres pots is found in the middle Gulf of California, that</page><page sequence="13">Ancient Cultural Interplay * 115 is, in the Guaymas area (Jett and Moyle 1986).8 To have portrayed the fish so exactly, the artists must have seen the fish. Trade in fish is one possibility, but no fish bones yet confirm this hypothesis (Minnis 1985). An alternative is that Mimbrefios traveled on pilgrimage to the gulf and back. If so, there should be some kind of physical evidence of such pas- sage. Are there, for example, any Mimbres potsherds in shell middens along the coast of the Gulf of California? If so, they would go far to confirm this hypothesis.9 The hypothesis that the Mimbrefios went on pilgrimages to the Guaymas area goes far to explain the distribution of copper bells in the American Southwest on the 1050-1150 ce time horizon, and also of scarlet macaws (Wilcox 1999a, 2003a; Wilcox, Keller, and Ortiz 2000; Vokes and Gregory 2007). 10 The fact that scarlet macaws are often shown sitting on carrying baskets in Mimbres designs (Creel and McKusick 1994) suggests that the Mimbrefios were transporters of the sacred birds. If they were trekking to the Guaymas area, copper bells and birds coming up through Sinaloa may have been readily available there, particularly in exchange for turquoise. Scarlet macaws are often thought to be confined to southeastern Mexico (Riley 2005:137), but Weigand reports that they are even today still found in West Mexico, though now extremely rarely. The Barranca del Rio Grande de Santiago below Lake Chapala has become one of their last refuges, though with all the new hydroelectric dams, he doubts if they'll survive there much longer, either. Caimans are already gone, and so are the great white storks, huge turtles (whose shells were used, prehispanically, as shields and drums), and monkeys.11 Both the Azure and Old Hachita turquoise mines are in or near the Mimbres area (Weigand and Garcia de Weigand 2001). The regular transport of turquoise southward also goes far to explain its frequent appearance in Mesoamerica, especially post- 1000 ce, when it was a marker of very high status. Weigand (2008) recently estimated that "between one and two million individual pieces of turquoise have been found in the southwestern United States and Mexico." If we modestly assume that on average one hundred Mimbrefios went to the Guaymas coast on pilgrim- age each year for two hundred years, and each carried a pouch containing two hundred pieces of turquoise, this process alone could account for two million pieces. If the people of Paquime kept up this process for another two hundred years, that process would be sufficient to explain what has been found (and may yet be found) in the archaeological record.</page><page sequence="14">116 * Journal of the Southwest We thus propose that this turquoise exchange system (as with that for jade) represents what Braudel (1980) called an element of a "trade structure." Trade structures are perdurable, outlasting any particular trade or exchange configuration because of the high value of the item being exchanged. Let there be no doubt about the value of turquoise in Mesoamerica: it was valued in both West and Central Mexico as in no other world area (Weigand and Garcia de Weigand 2001). The symbolic penetration of this commodity was almost universal: it stood for the words of priests and kings, as a special-purpose currency avail- able in the great markets and tianguis; for rain; for fertility in both nature and humanity; and for maize. It was used in elite exchanges as prestige gifts, in elegant costumes, and in general decoration. It perme- ated the iconography of the Mesoamerican world as no other mineral compound or natural substance did, outdoing even jade. Once a flow of it was established as part of the Mesoamerican trade structure, we may suppose that great efforts would have been made to maintain that flow, and even to increase it. During the Mimbres period, the magnet at the northern end of this long-distance exchange system in the American Southwest was clearly Chaco Canyon, and the Chacoan world, which apparently con- trolled the Cerrillos turquoise mines five days' travel to the east from Chaco Canyon (Harbottle and Weigand 1992; Weigand and Garcia de Weigand 2001; Wilcox 1999a, 2005c). Chacoan great houses may have extended as far south as the Aragon site in the northern Tularosa Valley (Lekson 1999) on a pedestrian route to the Mimbres region (Wilcox, Keller, and Ortiz 2000; Vokes and Gregory 2007). West of the Chacoan world in the period of 1150-1250 ce lies the Wupatki site, where forty-one scarlet macaws and many copper bells were found; arguably, this site was a gateway between the Chacoan and Hohokam worlds (Wilcox 2002; Wilcox, Keller, and Ortiz 2000).i2 Thus, it seems this long-distance exchange model, which postulates processes of the kind that Braudel (1980) called "the structures of everyday life," creates a coherent framework for explaining a great many diverse facts - but we suggest that it still requires much more testing before it should be regarded as demonstrated. It also should become a basis for examining how such connectivity may have become a means for ideological ideas to flow back and forth between the American South- west and West Mexico.13</page><page sequence="15">Ancient Cultural Interplay * 117 Archival Approaches As in all other areas of archaeology, archival research into the experi- ences and observations of earlier explorers can be a highly cost-effective way of garnering new knowledge (Poeschel 1984; Calvo 1990; Gerhard 1996; Weigand and Weigand 1996, 2000). Adolph Bandelier (1892), for example, conducted a reconnaissance of northern Sonora and Chihua- hua in 1884. Publication of his diaries by Lange and Riley (1970) sheds more light on where he went and what he saw. Less well known is his A History of the Southwest, which was presented to the Vatican in 1887 and has now been published in French (Burrus and Rodack 1987). The 502 figures that accompanied that work have not been published, but a catalogue has been (Burrus 1969), and slides of them are available in the Special Collections Library at the University of Arizona.14 They are remarkable. Many of them are site maps done in watercolors, to scale, with the different colors showing different layers of information. Forty- six of the sites he saw in northern Mexico are included. The most detailed and intriguing of these maps is that of Casas Grandes (Paquime; no. 499). A black-and-white version was published by Bandelier (1892 :pl. VI; see figure 4). What is most striking about this portrayal of the site, which is based on observations made more than one hundred years ago, is that it does not indicate the room block inferred by Di Peso, Rinaldo, and Fenner (1974:fig. 215-5) to encircle a large, Southwestern-like plaza. Bandelier's map does not indicate a plaza in the area proposed by Di Peso (to the east of the main mound). Di Peso, Rinaldo, and Fenner (1974:fig. 128-4) are clear that their eastern room block (not shown at all on Bandelier's map) is only "postulated." Dur- ing the 1991 Pecos Conference held at Casas Grandes, Wilcox walked over the area of this presumed room block, but could see nothing to support the hypothesis. Bandelier's map raises further doubts. Bandelier (1892:547) also says explicitly that "there is nowhere, so far as I was able to detect, any square or public yard of considerable extent" at Casas Grandes. Archaeological testing is needed to finally resolve this issue. Why is this matter so critical? It is important for two reasons: (1) if Paquime did not have a large central plaza like other contemporaneous Pueblo IV (fourteenth-century) sites in the American Southwest, it sug- gests that alleged organizational similarities (see Lekson 1999) may not have existed (see also Wilcox 1999b; Phillips 2000; Whalen and Minnis 2003; Riley 2005); and (2) Di Peso's (1974) estimate of Paquime's</page><page sequence="16">118 * Journal of the Southwest Figure 4. Map ofCasas Grandes by Adolph Bandelier, 1884 (from Bandelier 1892: pl. VI). population (4,700 people) must be questioned because it is based on a measure of total floor area that included this large but hypothetical room block. Thus, the assertion that Paquime was larger than any other Southwestern site may have to be revised. However, Bartlett (1854:2: facing p. 364; figure 5) shows two- to three-story wall remnants stand- ing on top 0/what Di Peso (1974) showed as three-story room blocks. In that light, Wilcox, Gregory, and Hill (2007) infer that Paquime may have had as many as four thousand rooms (or people). It is interesting</page><page sequence="17">Ancient Cultural Interplay ■&gt; 119 Figure 5. John Russell Bartlett Sketch ofCasas Grandes (from Bartlett 1854). to note that Bandelier (1892:570) also estimated three to four thousand people at Casas Grandes. Obregon's description (Hammond and Rey 1928:206) of what he saw at Paquime in 1565 is also instructive, confirming the wall heights of which Bartlett could still see remnants nearly three hundred years later: There are many houses of great size, strength, and height. They are of six and seven stories, with towers and walls like fortresses for protection and defense against the enemies who undoubtedly used to make war on its inhabitants. The houses contain large and magnificent patios . . . [and] [t]here were . . . wonderful and big pillars of heavy timbers brought from far away. The walls of the houses were whitewashed and painted in many colors and shades with pictures of the building. The structure had a kind of adobe walls. However it was mixed and interspersed with stone and wood, this combination being stronger and more durable than boards. Whether the roofs were still intact is unclear, but it seems unlikely that the building had been depopulated for long. In Weigand's opinion, this</page><page sequence="18">L20 * Journal of the Southwest is evidence that the site could have continued in use well into the first half of the 1500s, several generations later than the extant tree-ring dates now support (Dean and Ravesloot 1993). The timing of the depopulation of Paquime thus remains an open issue for which additional data are needed before any firm conclusions should be reached. Until then, just when we should expect to find evidence of a migration into central Sonora from Paquime, as Riley (1982, 1987) postulates, remains uncertain, although a general time frame of 1450-1550 ce seems the most likely. Was the North American Southwest "Mesoamericanized" in the L,ate Prehistoric Period? Many archaeologists, going back to the nineteenth century, have thought that Pueblo culture is in some respects a reflection of the high cultures of Mesoamerica. In a new synthesis, Carroll Riley (2005) carefully and with due caution weighs the evidence now assembled in support of this view, arguing for what he calls a "Mesoamericanization" of the North American Southwest (which he proposes to call "Aztlan") in the period 1200-1500 ce. The two main dimensions of such influence are iconog- raphy or religion, and political organization. The principal focus of the religion hypotheses is that ideas about one or another of the deities in the Mesoamerican pantheon directly or indirectly influenced the new cos- movisions that emerged in the North American Southwest following the disintegration of the Chacoan and Mimbres worlds and the coalescence of populations into relatively dense site clusters in northwestern Chihuahua and the American Southwest. Tlaloc (Brew 1943; P. Schaafsma 1999), Tezcatlipoca (Di Peso 1974; McKusick 2001), Quetzalcoatl (Di Peso 1974; Riley 2005), or other deities such as Chalchihuitlicue, Cihuaoatl, Xipe Totec, or Xiuhcoatl (P. Schaafsma 2000; Whittlesey 2004; Riley 2005) have all been invoked to label religious practices at Paquime or other Southwestern sites, although Riley (2005:15, 141) often qualifies such claims by suggesting these deities were "vastly distorted," "somehow changed," or "redefined." While we are sympathetic to some version of these ideas, we are most struck by the general lack of any kind of scientific consensus revealed in Riley's (2005) excellent review. The logic of using trait-list analysis to reach such conclusions is also less than satisfactory - or persuasive (see P. Schaafsma 1999:165). More sophisticated comparisons</page><page sequence="19">Ancient Cultural Interplay &lt;■ 121 have recently been made by Polly Schaafsma (1999), P. Schaafsma and Taube (2006), and Hays-Gilpin and Hill (1999). After briefly examin- ing their findings, we propose that a new methodological approach is needed to pursue their important hypotheses. P. Schaafsma (1999) and P. Schaafsma and Taube (2006) disavow any attempt to answer how and why questions. Their approach is to juxta- pose what they argue are "parallels" between structural "metaphors" found in both the North American Southwest and Mesoamerica. They leap easily from Olmec (see also Taube 2001), Teotihuacan, or Tajin examples to ones from Guerrero, the Tepehuan, and Amapa, Nayarit, in a method that could be criticized as "cherry picking," except that they insist that they "are not addressing isolated ideas here, but unraveling the integrated symbolic language pertaining to rainfall that pervades a greater Mesoamerican cosmology" that societies in the North American Southwest share (P. Schaafsma and Taube 2006:274). Admitting that they have not explained "the manner in which these ideas spread into the Southwest," they conclude that "it is clear that a migration of elites is not needed to explain the dispersion of the Mesoamerican rain cult to the north." Ideas about "rainmaking were ancient and fundamental to farming success everywhere" (275). Hays-Gilpin and Hill (1999), based on linguistic studies by Hill (1992), argue that a proto-Uto-Aztecan conception that the spirit land where the dead go was a "flowery world" filled with colorful flowers, birds, butterflies, and rainbows is apparent in the late prehistoric and historic material culture of the Puebloan Southwest beginning as early as 1000 ce in Mimbres and Chacoan contexts. Rather than being a religion or cult, they suggest the flower world complex "constituted one of sev- eral 'part ideologies' or a set of symbolic tools that remained available, either separately or in combination, to the ritual practice and thought of Southwestern people over a long period of time" (Hays-Gilpin and Hill 1999:16). They suggest that many of these ideas could have spread to the North American Southwest "at the same time as maize agricul- ture," some four thousand years ago. The manifestation of flower-world imagery on pottery, presumably the province of women, or in the male world of kiva murals, they suggest, has more to do with the ideological needs and struggles of specific times and places than with the immedi- ate source of the ideas being mobilized - which have been present for a long time, so long, indeed, that they are also found in Zuni, Keresan, or Tanoan societies (32). 15 We see, then, that Riley's (2005) inference</page><page sequence="20">122 * Journal of the Southwest of a late period of Mesoamericanization may be a serious misreading of the evidence. To postulate a new methodological approach to explaining why there are significant parallels in the worldviews of Southwestern and Meso- american societies, let us begin with the proposition that the first people to enter the New World some 13,500 years ago (Fiedel 2002; Waters and Stafford 2007) probably had ideas about the sun and the moon, and star clusters we call constellations, and that they brought with them creation stories. Eskimo-Aleut and Na-Dene aside, if the Amerind speakers postu- lated by the late Joseph Greenberg (1987) were the ancestors of all other American Indian groups, then an incredible amount of cultural diversity has emerged in a relatively short time. Yet we should never forget that Homo sapiens with fully developed language had already evolved at least 50,000 years ago. Is there any basis for doubting the enormous creativity of American Indians as they faced greatly diverse ecological situations, domesticated plants and animals, and developed cities and state-level societies in some parts of the Americas? Innovation in religious ideas certainly occurred, probably everywhere, and those who heard about those ideas would have had a shared basis for conversation about them, accepting some ideas and rejecting others, or perhaps changing their views in unique ways as a reaction to them. Already during the Paleo-Indian period, it seems likely that the idea of the upperworld and the underworld, and the movement of the heavenly bodies through them, was known. Shamanism, and probably the use of hallucinogenic substances to induce shamanic trances and "travel," quite likely also date back to the cultural progenitors of the Paleo-Indians in East Asia (Schultes 1969). Should we doubt that they liked flowers, had ideas about what happens at death, and may even have thought then that the afterlife involved a "flowery world?" Understanding the "cultural conversation" that took place among American Indians over the last 13,000 years is clearly one of the great challenges of American anthropology. The experience and knowledge of all American Indians are included in that universe of discourse, as are the traces of it still extant in the archaeological record of the Americas. Comparison across all of that universe affords us the greatest opportunity to comprehend and translate that discourse into terms meaningful to us all. Such comparisons need to be specific as to time and place, for the specificity of these religious ideas surely changed and evolved - or were transformed (Levi-Strauss 1982) - in many different ways.</page><page sequence="21">Ancient Cultural Interplay &lt;■ 123 Consider, as just one small example of what it is now possible to do, the iconography of the Sinaloan pottery traditions Kelly (1945) called the Aztatlan Complex and associated polychromes, and pseudo-cloisonne in West Mexico (Holien 1977). The detailed analyses now available for Gila Polychrome (Crown 1994) and Chihuahuan polychromes (Hendrickson 2003; VanPool 2003; VanPool and VanPool 2006) have led to valuable comparisons between them (VanPool, VanPool, and Phillips 2007). Similar analyses of and then comparisons with the Sinaloan and Jalisco ceramic traditions are now needed. We also suggest that La Relation ofMichoacan (Jeronimo de Alcala [1541] 2000) would be well worth incorporating into future comparisons. Thereby considerable new light may be shed on the question of Mesoamericanization of Southwestern societies - and whether it largely happened before Mesoamerica became the Mesoamerica of the high civilizations.16 Finally, let us again focus on issues of political organization in the North American Southwest. While we suggest that all human societies have power relationships of some kind, new configurations of power evolved in the North American Southwest that integrated groups into what have been called "regional systems" and "macro-regional systems" (Wilcox 1979, 1995, 1999a, 2005c; Crown and Judge 1991) of which there were also more or less independent "hinterlands" (Sullivan and Bay- man 2007). Each was arguably unique (Wilcox 1996a). As noted earlier, beginning in the 1200s, a process of coalescence of hamlets and small villages into medium and large villages began that culminated in the 1400s Puebloan world where more than half the extant rooms were in sites of one thousand rooms or more, and the villages were arrayed into distinct clusters (Wilcox, Gregory, and Hill 2007; see also Kowalewski 2006). Wilcox (1981, 1984) a generation ago argued that these site clusters were politically integrated in some (unspecified) way into polities. Steadman Upham (1982) extended that argument into the late prehistoric period, postulating a specific "managerial elite" model for how they were inter- nally organized. That model has now been thoroughly tested and rejected (Rice 2004). Consensus has been achieved that there were coalescent site clusters, although there is still vigorous debate about how they were organized internally and what they mean (Spielmann 1994, 1998; Adler 1996; Adams and Duff 2004; Wilcox, Gregory, and Hill 2007). C. Schaafsma and Riley (1999a; Riley 2005; see also Furst 1986) have proposed their own "cacique model" for these polities. Their assumption is that the way leaders (caciques) legitimized their power was something</page><page sequence="22">124 ^ Journal of the Southwest they learned from Mesoamerica (Riley 2005:102). Calling the Pueblo polities "nascent Pueblo federations" (106), they suggest that in each "there was an elite leadership, anchored in the moieties and in the pow- erful societies, hunt, clown, and especially war and kachina societies." Riley continues, It seems likely that it was through this leadership that the kachina and other sodalities channeled religious ceremonies. It was a congeries of individuals, and probably related families, that also directed relationships with other groups, including trade and war- fare, and to one degree or another controlled the instruments of economic land, irrigation and other water resources, and hunting and gathering territories. Just how this was done is not known today. (Riley 2005:106)17 As a general statement we see little to object to in this position, especially the last part about not knowing just how such power was exercised (but see Brandt 1994). But with the admission that we do not know how power was legitimized, hence we cannot be sure that such mechanisms were informed by knowledge emanating from Mesoamerica. A closer look at political organization in the late prehistoric period of southern Arizona provides us with an opportunity to explore these issues in greater depth. A Reevaluation of Ancient Political Organization in Southern Arizona Before discussing the evolution of ancient political organization in south- ern Arizona, arguing that it was complex and "statelet-like" - to borrow Riley's (1982) term - it is well to consider what political organization is in general. Going back to the beginnings of Western thought, we find that Aristotle (Barker 1978) defined the political group as an associa- tion of people with common interests in a conception of the good life, economic self-sufficiency, and justice. The "polity," or constitution, is established in order to regulate the distribution of power among the citizens; that is, those qualified to hold office. Following more recent archaeological usage (e.g., Hally 1991), we use the term "polity" more generally to refer to a bounded social group that had a distinct political identity. It does not necessarily imply state-level organization.</page><page sequence="23">Ancient Cultural Interplay &lt;■ 125 Aristotle believed that all human groups have some form of political organization, and early anthropologists (e.g., Morgan 1877; Service 1975) argued that there has been an evolutionary progression from bands to tribes, then chiefdoms, and finally, states. Such formulations have been criticized as being too categorical and as failing to reckon with the incredible diversity of political arrangements in human societ- ies (Yoffee 1993). While analogies with ethnographic cases may still be helpful, independent archaeological theory grounded in relationships observable in the archaeological record is needed to move the debate forward (Wilcox 2005a). Another basic question about political organization concerns the geo- graphic scale of the groups so associated. One can approach this problem from the outside in or from the inside out. In Hohokam research over the last twenty-five years, for example, the latter perspective has led to behavioral concepts on multiple social scales: the identification of courtyard groups as households (Wilcox, McGuire, and Sternberg 1981; Howard 1985); aggregates of these which share a common cemetery, or compound, as supra-household groups (Wilcox 1991a); public architecture (ballcourts, platform mounds) as the focus of primary villages or "communities" (Doyel 1981; Wilcox and Sternberg 1983); the settlements cooperating along canal systems as "irrigation communities" (Doyel 1981; Abbott 1994a; Howard 1987, 2006); and the macro-canal systems that formed larger "communities" (Gregory and Nials 1985; Doyel 1987; Fish, Fish, and Madsen 1992; Doelle, Gregory and Wallace 1995). Most of these analyses fail to evaluate carefully what among all of these groupings con- stituted a "political association," or polity (but see Howard 2006). This brings us again to Carroll Riley's concept of Sonoran "statelets" (figure 6). Based on Spanish accounts from the sixteenth century, Riley (1982, 1987) finds that there was a contiguous series of irrigation-based and named settlement clusters made up of medium to large villages (250-1,000+ houses), some of which clusters were at war with one another. He infers that these settlement clusters were polities, which he provocatively labels "statelets." We next show that settlement clusters analogous to those described by the Spaniards in sixteenth-century cen- tral Sonora also existed in the American Southwest two centuries earlier (Wilcox 1981, 1991c; Upham 1982; Wilcox and Haas 1994; LeBlanc 1999; Adams and Duff 2004). We focus the present discussion on the relational patterns discovered within the last decade in central and south- ern Arizona, beginning with work on a place called Perry Mesa.</page><page sequence="24">Figure 6. The Sonoran "Statelets" in the Middle 1500s ce (reprinted from Riley 1982: fy. 8 with color added) .</page><page sequence="25">Ancient Cultural Interplay * 127 The View from Perry Mesa (From the Outside Looking In) Our recent experience (Wilcox, Robertson, and Wood 1999, 2001a; Wilcox 2005a, 2006a; Wilcox and Holmlund 2007) studying the four- teenth-century settlement system on Perry Mesa (figure 7), which lies about fifty miles north of the Phoenix basin, in collaboration with the late Jerry Robertson, a former Vietnam military officer, has produced an "outside-in" analysis with significant implications for Hohokam archaeol- ogy (Wilcox 2005b). The surface-masonry pueblos on Perry Mesa are deployed around the edges of a seventy-five-square-mile area bounded on three sides by high, vertical cliffs. Our explanation of these data is that three thousand people (from room counts) aggregated there, all within eighteen kilometers of one another, in a "castle-defense" designed so that the occupants of each pueblo could protect the backs of all the others. Looking into the questions of antecedents to this system, and who their allies and enemies may have been, we found the following patterns (Wilcox, Robertson, and Wood 2001b; Wilcox et al. 2006; Wilcox 2005a, 2006a): FirsP. Ca. 1100 ce, a twenty- to thirty-mile-wide "buffer zone" opened up around three sides of the Salt River valley, and a line of hilltop "retreat" or lookout sites was built at the edge of the foothills north of Phoenix. This was part of a continuous defensive system that extended from New River northward along the Agua Fria to the whole Prescott area. Buffer zones are thought to be a commonly used means of dampening down conflict between par- ties by raising the transportation costs of warfare (see Mera 1935; Hickerson 1962, 1965; DeBoer 1981; Jewett 1989; Hally 1991; LeBlanc 1999). Second: This hilltop system was depopulated in favor of small nucleated pueblos on Perry Mesa and in the Bloody Basin and the Verde Valley ca. 1250-1275 ce, at just the same time as, in the Phoenix basin, massive compound walls began to be built around platform mounds and large pit structures were built on top.18 We suggest that this is no coincidence. Not only could the Salt River valley villages now marshal sufficient forces to "take out" the hilltop systems, they became much more defensively integrated. The sets of compounds in each Hohokam village</page><page sequence="26">Figure 7. The Ferry Mesa Settlement System, 1250-1425 ce (after Wilcox, Rob- ertson, and Wood 2001a: Fig. 7.11).</page><page sequence="27">Ancient Cultural Interplay &lt;■ 129 formed a new system of redoubts defensively integrated by the mounds via signals exchanged between Hohokam villages via the moundtops or towers.19 Third: By putting together maps of the distribution of all currently known Pueblo IV sites with thirteen or more rooms throughout west-central Arizona (Wilcox, Robertson, and Wood 2001a; fig- ure 8), we found that Perry Mesa was embedded in a continuous network that had defensible sites on its perimeter and undefended sites on the interior. We proposed that this large settlement system (105 kilometers long) of about twelve thousand people (from room counts) was politically integrated into a "Verde Confederacy." We assume a confederacy is a formalized alliance between otherwise independent polities for specific purposes. A confederacy may be unbalanced in terms of relative power of the constituents, reflecting as well a difference in degree of participation.20 Fourth: Buffer zones (figure 9) came about between the Verde Confederacy and neighboring site clusters, and among the latter, thus defining boundaries that, we propose, segregated separate Pueblo IV polities, most with about 2500 to 3000 people each (from room counts; see table I).21 Fifth and finally: From this perspective, from the outside look- ing in, the Salt River valley as a whole appears to be one political entity, the two exceptionally large platform mounds of Pueblo Grande and Mesa Grande - only eight miles apart - being the twin symbols of its political integration (figure 10; see also Howard 2006). Furthermore, the two clusters of platform-mound sites along the Gila, which have no unoccupied buffer zone between them (Gregory and Huckleberry 1994), are spatially closely linked to the Salt River mounds, with Los Muertos and the Queen Creek delta sites as intermediaries, indicating that the whole Phoenix basin was probably also politically integrated as (we would suppose) a confederacy. The burning and depopula- tion of the Marana and Robles sites ca. 1300 ce (Fish, Fish, and Madsen 1992; Downum 1993) completed the circumscription by a wide buffer zone of the Phoenix basin and a closely related southern periphery (figure 11).</page><page sequence="28">Figure 8.

The Hohokam in the Phoenix Basin in Relation to Their Immediate Neighbors, ca. 1300 ce (reprinted from Wilcox 199%: fig. 10.20). Hohokam Political Integration To test these ideas, we can begin by looking at the Colonial-Sedentary period (750-1 100 ce) settlement system along the lower Verde as pictured by Doyel and Crary (1996; figure 12). Given that comparative analyses (Drennan 1984; Hally 1991; Wilcox, Robertson, and Wood 2001b) have shown that eighteen kilometers ( eleven miles) - which is the dis- tance a person with a pack can walk to and come back in a day - often defines settlement clusters, we have added a circle with this radius to their map. The McDowell Mountains thus are indicated as a boundary, and the settlements above Bartlett Dam that Shereen Lerner (1984; see also Whittlesey, Ciolek-Torrello, and Altschul 1998) showed in her dissertation to be a separate group, are also set apart by this analysis. As Doyel and Crary (1996) emphasize, the lower Verde settlement cluster has a definite large central village that Scott Wood calls "Azatlan," which included at least four ballcourts associated with three plazas (figure 13). Around the northern plaza one court is oriented north-south and the other east-west, while the other two courts have their own plazas with, again, one north-south and one east-west court. Between this lower Verde site cluster and the rest of the ballcourt network (figure 14) there is a pronounced gap to the southeast (toward Apache Junction) and the southwest (down the Salt) (see Wilcox and Sternberg 1983). We thus agree with Doyel and Crary (1996) that this lower Verde population</page><page sequence="33">Figure 12. The Lower Verde Polity, 1000s ce (after Doyel and Crary 1996: fig. 35).</page><page sequence="34">136 41 Journal of the Southwest Figure 13. The Azatlan Site (after Doyel and Crary 1996). was organized as a separate polity, whose population can be estimated at about 2,500 people.22 These data show that by the eleventh century ce, the Hohokam core area had become politically differentiated. Before that, in the early Colonial period (ca. 750 ce), there emerged the ballcourt network and</page><page sequence="35">Ancient Cultural Interplay * 137 Figure 14. Hohokam Ballcourt Distribution in the Greater Phoenix Basin (reprinted from Wilcox and Sternberg 1983: fig. 10.4). a distinctive ideology, the Hohokam religion (Wilcox 1987a, 1991b; Wallace, Heidke, and Doelle 1995)- which Doyel (1992) has dubbed the "Rainbow Way." In this earlier period the distribution of ballcourts was much more continuous and widespread than it would become. This religion served to differentiate a Hohokam cultural identity; neighboring peoples outside of southern Arizona probably maintained earlier belief systems. By about 1000 ce, however, smaller-scale regional religious traditions appeared in the Mimbres area, the Tucson basin, and other</page><page sequence="36">138 * Journal of the Southwest areas, and the ballcourt network shrank by more than half (Wilcox 1999b; Gregory and Wilcox 2007). Arguably, village self-sufficiency during the Colonial and early Seden- tary periods (750-1000 ce) depended on intimate ties to the pan-regional ballcourt network, but we see no good reason to think that political deci- sion-making was integrated above the level of the irrigation community at that time. There probably were mechanisms, however, for coordinating the ritual interactions among nearby villages and between neighboring irrigation communities (see Wilcox 1987a, 1991a; Howard 2006).23 By the middle 1000s, however, sites like Azatlan and the clustering of sites around it point to the existence of such integration on a higher, regional level (Doyel and Crary 1996). Once such entities formed, and could act together in their own self- interest, older forms of organization likely would have given way to new ones. As noted earlier, significant changes of organization in fact occurred by the end of the 1000s. The whole Azatlan system, for example, was abruptly depopulated (Canouts 1975; Doyel and Crary 1996).24 Sna- ketown, a similarly large site on the Gila River, was probably burned and certainly depopulated (Wilcox, McGuire, and Sternberg 1981 ).25 Other Gila River sites, including the large center at Grewe, were totally reorganized (Wilcox and Sternberg 1983; Gregory and Huckleberry 1994), as were other Phoenix basin sites. As Doyel (1980, 1988) long ago pointed out, profound changes in the cremation death ritual also occurred ca. 1 100 ce, and platform mounds soon became primary public facilities.26 Ballcourts endured, however, at least for another seventy-five years or so (Wilcox and Sternberg 1983; Wilcox 1991d, 2002). Along the Salt River, the Lehi and Scottsdale irrigation systems were "pumped up" (Howard 1987, 2006; Henderson 1995), and they began to rival in size the canal systems below the hydrographic boundary at Tempe Butte (see Lee 1905). Migration into the Mesa-Scottsdale systems is likely, quite possibly from the lower Verde or from depopulated ballcourt villages along the base of the Superstition Mountains or from the Gila (compare Abbott 1995; Howard 2006). Given that the platform mounds became most elaborated along the Salt, we propose that the conjunction of changes ca. 1100 ce partly involved a shift from a Gila-centered ideol- ogy (the Rainbow Way) to a new ideology dominated by communities along the Salt River (for current discussions of Hohokam ideology see Bostwick and Downum 1994; Bostwick and Krocek 2002; Bostwick and Plum 2005; Whittlesey 2004; Masse and Espenak 2006).</page><page sequence="37">Ancient Cultural Interplay -fr 139 Did the irrigation communities along the Salt unite in a single political association shortly after 1100 ce at the beginning of what archaeologists call the "Classic period" (1100-1450 ce)? Did this association then evolve over the next three centuries, becoming more complex? We are inclined to think so, but current data are too fragmentary to make a definitive argument. Excavation data are showing that the Salt's settlement systems were highly dynamic during the three hundred-year-long Classic period (Gregory et al. 1988; Hackbarth 1995; Downum and Bostwick 2003), but we are still a long way from being able to discuss the "organizational dynamics" of this social system or understand how local groups probably competed for power within it (see Stein 1994). For now, we must rephrase the question in structural terms: were the Salt's irrigation communities ever integrated into a single political association, or polity? There are at least three interesting perspectives on this question. The first is presented by Suzanne Fish and Paul Fish (2000) who point out that in addition to kinship organization, Hohokam society probably also had groupings based on "civic-territorial organization." This is a fundamental point that should be of great value to all archaeologists worldwide who are interested in questions of social complexity and its evolution. Fish and Fish emphasize the community, at the levels of both individual villages and multiple "irrigation community" settlements as examples of likely civic-territorial entities whose organizations cross-cut kinship groupings. Our proposal that the entire Hohokam site cluster of platform-mound settlements in the Salt River valley was a single entity can also be seen from this perspective. Already during the ballcourt era, it is likely that neighboring villages interacted with one another in terms of village identities.27 With the increasing importance of the platform mounds, and the shift of demographic dominance to the Salt, new forms of civic-territorial organization quite likely emerged. Looking again at the differences among the platform mounds in terms of the overall energy investment in them, and of what was eventually built on top of them and in association with them, provides a way to give more definition to the kind of civic-territorial organization that the Hohokam adopted. To address this question, which establishes our second perspective, Wilcox conducted a graph-theoretic study (see Hage and Harary 1983; Wilcox 1988) of centrality among twenty-seven platform-mound vil- lages along the Salt (figure 15). Taking the mounds as nodes, lines are drawn to represent neighbor-to-neighbor relationships, with three-mile distances treated as a unit of one. To emphasize the unity of macro-canal</page><page sequence="38">140 ^ Journal of the Southwest systems, which ceramic analyses have shown were economic units (Abbott 1994a, 1994b, 1995, 2000), he assigned an extra unit of distance for crossing the Salt River. The results show that Pueblo Grande^with a millennium-long time depth as a large village and being the locus of one of the two largest platform mounds - is the most central.28 This finding follows from working out the least-path distances between every pair of villages and summing the rows in the resulting matrix to identify the site with the smallest sum (table 2). Other ranks assigned in table 2 assumed equivalence of rank if the row sums were within one unit of each other. Noticing that all but three sites were between one and four steps from Pueblo Grande, Wilcox took four steps as a criterion and noted with an asterisk (*) those sites that are the least connected to all others in the Salt River valley platform-mound settlement system. Only one other platform-mound site is comparable to Pueblo Grande in significant organizational features: its size and number of associated platform mounds (three); and its position near the head of a macro-canal system (Turney's [1929] System 1) where it could control water distribu- tion. That site is Mesa Grande. Looking at a simplified version of Jerry Howard's map (Howard 1992; figure 10) we also notice that Pueblo Grande is actually opposite Mesa Grande, and only eight miles away. One could, therefore, easily go to and come back from one or the other in a single day. The area between them is bounded on the north and south by two other large, important sites: Pueblo Ultimo and Plaza Tempe, respectively. Plaza Tempe, the only other site (of three) with at least three platform mounds, ranks second in connectivity behind Pueblo Grande. Pueblo Ultimo is not as well connected, ranking ninth, but it is in the top ten of overall best-connected sites, using the four-step criterion. Although the destruction of most of the platform mounds in the Salt River valley by modern development limits what can now be said (but see Turney 1929), one can still readily identify three and perhaps four levels of a settlement hierarchy (see also Wilcox 1988; Howard 2006). Pueblo Grande and Mesa Grande, as we have seen, are at the top. Villages with two or three platform mounds are candidates for secondary centers: Plaza Tempe, La Ciudad, Las Acequias, Las Colinas, and Kalfus.29 We would include Pueblo Ultimo in this class as well, mainly because of its relative closeness to Pueblo Grande on the Scottsdale side of the river. All of these sites are in key positions in the canal systems. Three are in the middle of Turney's (1929) macro-canal Systems 1 and 2, where they could assist in controlling water allocation. Plaza Tempe is at the head</page><page sequence="39">Figure 15. A Graph-Theoretic Study of Platform Mound Villages in the Salt River Valley ca. 1300 ce.</page><page sequence="40">142 * Journal of the Southwest of canals that come off the Salt River just west of Tempe Butte and, as noted earlier, it is also the second most central site in the whole system (table 2). La Ciudad and Las Acequias rank fourth in connectivity (table 2).30 Las Colinas and Kalfus are at the end of Canal System 2, but are also well placed to oversee smaller systems farther west. Pueblo Ultimo is apparently the largest site in the Scottsdale system, though only one platform mound is known to be present on it. A fourth level is formed by Classic-period sites without any platform mounds that lie toward the ends of the canal systems (figure 10). One wonders what Aristotle would have said about the Hohokam if he could have added this case to his comparisons. All the Hohokam would have needed to establish a civic-territorial "constitution" (in Aristotle's sense) to integrate the Salt's irrigation communities was a dualistic ideology similar to the one reported eth- nographically for the Creeks (Haas 1941), in the Eastern Woodlands. There the Whites and the Reds, which stood for umy friend" and "my enemy," formed a political whole, using the symbolism of a ball game to adjudicate their rivalries.31 Along the Salt River, we have seen that there were two hydrographic divisions, each with a macro-canal system and smaller canal systems opposite them. The upstream systems, which took water off first, had grown large early in the Classic period, appar- ently the result of the immigration of outsiders. How could they have achieved a foothold if the locals had not allowed them in? If there was serious conflict between them, why did no buffer zone develop? A third way to approach the question of civic- territorial organization is to examine the Hohokam in the Salt River valley in the context of changing water use and water management, and rising sociopolitical complexity. In his examination of the interaction between irrigation and sociopolitical organization, Howard (2006) focused on the irriga- tion community as the major unit of analysis. The basic operational requirements of irrigation, including water scheduling, water allocation, and system maintenance, occurs within the irrigation community. The questions examined here concerning the formation of a valleywide polity involve political interactions between the large irrigation communities. A pattern of expanding land and water use provides some insights into the development of the social changes that define the Classic period and the relationship between Pueblo Grande and Mesa Grande. Several patterns have been noted earlier. They include the opening of "buffer zones," downstream areas of the river once containing irrigation</page><page sequence="41">= t&gt; -* % si si si % % -5 i i i js i £ -S ^ -5 -5 "5 3 £ -5 -5 £ * _ in in in in in in inin mmin O 00inc0i-H(NrHTtiOOOOOOi- irH&lt;s&lt;NCOCO(Ncoco»- icorosOvO H™ 00 00 00 ^N ^N ^N GK ^H rH pH rH »^ rH ^H ^H rH ^H ^H f^ fH rH ^H ^H rH ^H ^H rH ^ o in in in o in vo^intNoo^lNininvoooosOooov&lt;Nin(- ((NoooNOvm^HpHroo ^ in in o o in in in in in ^ CM T^com^&lt;NininvOinvOTtH&lt;N"-HCO&lt;NOOOsThOOCO&lt;NCO&gt;OOOvOsON jM^inininininininin in in in in ininin inin in in in in "55 in ^«iH^^HwidH^iflifiin^ifiNifl\dfoiflifiino&lt;i^Ni/i 1 m *&gt; o g in inrt^Thiincoinininint^inrsfSr- icokoonOooi- ipHomcoooi-HOs E *- ^ O £ f^ lfl^^inwiflifiU5lflNlfifO(SH«WflO^OMHOHiflMMHO\ OQinininininininininLntn in in inininin inininin ^t IN ^WW^fO^W^^&lt;ii/SWw6^&lt;lNifiNOHHi/)^NONo6 ~ -^ in in in in in in in in = 00 ^ ^ § ^ rococo&lt;s&lt;NincoNOvOThi»- icoroincoooinoooinmvovOintxtN»as .&gt; ^ W^^«ifi^(Sini/)H^\0\ON\OfOOi/5W5NWWiflN(SH^ * « 2 «« « "i5 ^ inincoinvOrqincocoroNOKt'vvotv. ocoooi\OKt"Nrooo&gt;- iin&lt;N c «- rorq^corHinrfiinininrorHOcoi- it"N.NOfOtv.cocN&lt;sini- iooooov | m ^ ^ U ^ M(S^WHifl^inU5l/5fOOHCOHN\OW»fCWfOlflMWMO\ «S «- ^ ^ »^ ^- fS&lt;S^H(N^fSifliflWO«f0ifiW10^HNifi\0ifiifi^\0^» 2 O _h ^ ^ ^ .- ^ r^fOror^T^&lt;^^Tt&lt;'«t1oroininNOinfoT^l'^(vOKt&lt;v'^sorofOin _h ^ in in g o&gt; fricorHT^T^^cooo^inininTfincoiniNco^inini- isoin^in .Q in in gj^r*. ^H&lt;NfSpHCOcoocoropH&lt;N^^H^i^in&lt;NroinT^\ovOroin^t^\0 iq in in Jo ^ ^ *o ^ ^ X m &lt;srqocofOi^f^^rHfo^T^^fo^WTt&lt;inrocf)T^T^rHinT^\oin v in rHO&lt;SrH^for^cococo&lt;N&lt;NrsfC&lt;NinT^coincoT^cOicovOvOK «- OH(SH(S(SHWfO^(SfOf0^f0^fCWl/5^\OlfiW5^lfiU5N "S .ti o^rMm^inior^ooo^Ov-iNm^-mior^ |2 ^ *-iNm«tfmvor^eoo&gt;«-*-T--*-*-«-*-*-*-«-rMrMiNf&gt;irM&lt;NrMiN</page><page sequence="42">144 ■&gt; Journal of the Southwest systems that are depopulated in the Predassic-to-Classic-period transi- tion. At this time we also see an end to the expansion of the irrigation systems upstream in the lower Salt River valley. The Lehi System, which enters the territory of Mesa Grande, is the last irrigation community to be built, with construction beginning ca. 1000 to 1100 ce. Could the depopulation of downstream areas and the end of upstream construction show that the limits of water availability for irrigation had been reached? Could the construction of the Lehi System have appropriated too much water upstream and created downstream water shortages? A computer simulation of water use (Howard 1993, 2006) clearly suggests this pos- sibility. The construction of the Lehi System appears to have crossed a critical threshold of water use, creating periodic water shortages. These water management issues have implications for sociopolitical organization in the valley, particularly in regard to the relationships between irrigation communities. Prior to crossing this threshold, one irrigation community had little reason for regular coordination with other irriga- tion communities; there was plenty of water to go around. After crossing this threshold, a situation of critical resource management existed. Once relatively independent irrigation communities had to cooperate to share their common and most vital resource, the water on the Salt River. The introduction of a new ideology, the construction of platform mounds, and the many cultural changes of the Classic Period may reflect this new reality. The platform mounds were clearly symbols of the power of their communities. The largest mounds, Pueblo Grande and Mesa Grande, are located adjacent to the headgates of the largest irrigation systems. Pueblo Grande had an established irrigation network covering approximately 29,000 acres. Mesa Grande, at the headgates of Canal System 1 and lying within the terminal area of the Lehi Canal System, controlled 27,000 acres. Its rapid expansion in site size and population may well reflect the incorporation of people migrating from the lower Verde, as noted earlier. Together, Pueblo Grande and Mesa Grande controlled approximately half of the irrigated acreage in the Salt River valley. They appear to have formed a dualistic system, representing the north side-south side of the river and the upstream-downstream rela- tionships. The two great sites and their great mounds may represent administrative nodes involved in negotiations for water allocations dur- ing times of water shortage. This system of negotiation would integrate the irrigation communities valleywide at a higher level of sociopolitical interaction (Howard 2006). For other recent discussions of Hohokam</page><page sequence="43">Ancient Cultural Interplay &lt;■ 145 Figure 16. Turquoise-encrusted Toad and Raptorial Bird, Casa Grande Ruins. irrigation, see Huckleberry 1999; Waters and Ravesloot 2001; Ensor, Ensor and De Vries 2003). Additional support for a dualistic system in the middle Classic period (ca. 1300 ce) may be provided by the turquoise-mosaic emblems of a nocturnal water symbol, the toad, and a sky symbol, the raptorial bird (figure 16; see Wilcox 2003b for an inventory of known examples). Rein- terpreting earlier dualistic concepts that are evidenced by the north-south versus east-west ballcourts at Azatlan and other pre-Classic Hohokam sites (see Wilcox and Sternberg 1983; Wilcox 199 Id), the toad/bird dichotomy was apparently adopted from a northern neighbor of the Hohokam, the Sinagua, where they occur earliest in the archaeologi- cal record.32 During the Elden phase, 1150-1250 ce, when ballcourts were still in use in both areas, the Sinagua began making these tur- quoise-mosaic emblems.33 At Ridge Ruin, near Flagstaff, several of the raptorial-bird emblems are associated with the burial of a war leader known as the Magician (McGregor 1943). He was placed in a specially constructed crypt with much other wealth and symbols of office. These emblems later occur in late thirteenth-century sites like Pollack, where a bird emblem was placed in the mouth of the corpse (MNA catalogue). By the fourteenth century, they are widely distributed from the middle Verde, Chavez Pass, and Grasshopper to the Phoenix basin, southeast- ern Arizona, and Casas Grandes (Billideau 1986; Wilcox 2003b). Both emblems occur together in one known context, a cache from Compound A at Casa Grande Ruins (Huffman 1925; figure 17), where two birds</page><page sequence="44">Figure 17. Cache of Turquoise-Encrusted Toad and Bird Figures and other Turquoise and Shell beads, Casa Grande Ruins National Monument (after Huffman 1925).</page><page sequence="45">Ancient Cultural Interplay * 147 and a toad were found with considerable other turquoise and shell. We regard them as emblems of political office. Based on current evidence, the adoption of these symbols in the Salt River valley happened just as the Pueblo Grande and Mesa Grande mounds became really large, probably incorporating dual earlier mounds into a common platform at each site (David Gregory, personal com- munication, 1992). On top of them, initially, were built extra-large pit structures (Hayden 1957; Wilcox 1987b; Downum and Bostwick 2003), probably council rooms.34 We suggest that they were symbols of what Aristotle called the politeuma^ the civic body established in power by the polity. It was at that point, about 1250-1275 ce, when the Salt River valley most clearly became a unified polity (Howard 2006), and a period of escalating regional warfare began (LeBlanc 1999; Wilcox, Robertson, and Wood 2001a, 2001b; Wilcox and Holmlund 2007). On the Pueblo Grande and Mesa Grande mounds, the putative council rooms gave way to much more elaborate architectural complexes (Dow- num and Bostwick 2003; Jerry Howard, field observations). At Pueblo Grande there is evidence for numerous ritual artifacts on top, and for both storage and food production on a large scale in the accompany- ing compound (Downum 1998; Downum and Bostwick 2003). These data indicate that the politeuma became more complex, and instead of merely council rooms, we see special social units also in residence on these mounds, which had others who cooked for them (compare Dow- num and Bostwick 2003). We thus think two additional hypotheses are in order: (1) before the Salt became tightly integrated, during the early Classic period, there was a more confederated version of the whole pol- ity, and quite possibly that entity included the Gila as well; and (2) after the Salt became tightly integrated ca. 1250-1275 ce, its dominance in its confederation with the Gila was increased. This may be shown by the fact that Casa Grande, the largest compound/platform-mound site along the Gila, was located not in the middle of its cluster of villages, but at the western end where it was closest to the Salt River polity (Wilcox 1988). Similar locational skewing of secondary centers is found in chiefdom systems in the Eastern Woodlands (Steponaitis 1978 ).35 Let us next consider the implications of this model from another perspective. In our Perry Mesa comparative study (Wilcox, Robertson, and Wood 2001a), we found that most Pueblo IV polities in central Arizona had populations of about 2,500-3,500 people (table 1). This is just on the cusp, or threshold, when worldwide comparisons</page><page sequence="46">148 * Journal of the Southwest suggest that new kinds of social complexity develop (Lekson 1985; Kosse 1996) - no wonder there has been endless debate about just how complex these societies were (Cordell 1984)! Even the Verde Confederacy of twelve thousand people is made up of settlement systems which, like Perry Mesa's, had about three thousand people, no great leaps are necessary to understand how such a political sys- tem could have been organized through cooperative understandings reinforced by an outside threat. The Hohokam case, however, is different. If twelve to fifteen thou- sand people (based on pithouse estimates)36 were politically integrated into a single polity, whose officers could exercise a monopoly of force, as Wilcox (2005b) has argued, then we are into a comparative demo- graphic quartile where we should be talking about incipient state-level organization (Murdock 1957). If the population of the Phoenix basin was even larger - as some would argue based on irrigated acreage (Fish, Fish, and Madsen 1992; Howard 1993, 2006)- that would be even more the case. The Calusa polity, in southwest Florida, for example, is estimated to have had about ten to fifteen thousand people (McGoun 1993:23; compare Goggin and Sturtevant 1964). They also built plat- form mounds and large canal systems, but in this case we also have the advantage of historic accounts that add many details not available for the Hohokam. Future Hohokam research should include comparison with other polities like the Calusa, which apparently was much more politi- cally complex than most Southwestern archaeologists have thought the Hohokam were. Comparison with small-scale polities in Mesoamerica would also be of great interest. In the end, however, we will again have to rely on the potentials of independent archaeological theory (Wilcox 2005a). The "transactionaT' analyses of ceramic exchange made possible by sophisticated ceramic sourcing studies are beginning to produce valuable data on exchanges within and across irrigation communities (Abbott 1994a, 2000). Cau- tion is needed, however, before making too much of such findings until a more compete matrix of relationships has been built up. Economic division of labor within the Phoenix basin and with its near southern neighbors also became more complex and differentiated during the Classic period, with greater emphasis on the large-scale production of cotton, agave, and cholla (Wilcox 1987b, 1988; Crown 1987; Bayman 1996). Their equitable distribution may have required new kinds of decision-making arrangements.</page><page sequence="47">Ancient Cultural Interplay * 149 Putting Southern Arizona into a Macro-Regional Context To test ideas like these, and to understand the larger macro-regional context in which Southwestern political, social, and economic processes operated, what we call the "Coalescent Community Database" has been constructed of all known sites with thirteen rooms or more found throughout the entire North American Southwest for the period from 1200 to 1700 ce (J. B. Hill et al. 2004; Wilcox 2005a; Hill, Lyons, and Clark 2006; Wilcox, Gregory, and Hill 2007; Wilcox et al. 2006).37 A histogram (figure 18) shows that these data divide nicely into hamlets of 13-100 rooms; small villages of 101-250 rooms; medium villages of 251-999 rooms; and large villages of 1,000 or more rooms. A friction cost-surface analysis by Brett Hill provides a way to visualize a series of interaction measures among these settlements. Sites within 300 meters of one another were first grouped together as communities. Catchments of 7 kilometers, the distance one can walk in a day and come back (18 kilometers), and the distance one can walk in a day (36 kilometers) in which the energy costs of crossing slopes with different values produces images of nested sets that can be mapped in successive fifty-year intervals (figure 19). Noticing that the communities clustered by catchment area formed a dispersed series of "islands," we called them "population aggre- gates" and constructed a histogram of their room-count values (figure 20) and a second series of maps every fifty years that shows the collection of all known places of habitation on the landscape of the North American Southwest from 1200 to 1600 ce (see, for example, figure 21). Four basic trends that we accept as facts are documented by these data: (1) in the early 1200s the whole North American Southwest was very nearly a single interacting settlement system (see figure 19); (2) already by that time, however, a basic division between the northern and south- ern Southwest is apparent that becomes dramatically clear by ca. 1400 ce (figure 21) when the entire Mogollon Rim region (east- west) was depopulated; (3) the general demographic trend from the early 1300s is downward (as previous studies had already found (figure 22; see Dean, Doelle, and Orcutt 1994; Doelle 2000); and (4) the Salt River valley- and the Phoenix basin more generally- was by far the largest population cluster in the entire North American Southwest,38 and it endured at relatively high demographic levels for far longer than any other place in the Southwest measured for this five hundred-year period (tables 3 and 4).</page><page sequence="48">150 &lt;■ Journal of the Southwest Figure 18.

Brett Hill and his colleagues Patrick Lyons and Jeffrey Clark (2006) at the Center for Desert Archaeology have recently "fine-tuned" the demographic analysis and chronological data for the Salt River valley (see table 3) and produced a new series of maps. Of special interest here is what happened in the late 1300s and early 1400s (figures 23 and 24). Stream flow studies based on tree-ring retrodictions by the late Donald Graybill in collaboration with David Gregory, Gary Funkhouser, and Fred Nials (Graybill et al. 1989; Graybill et al. 2006) have shown that in the Salt River valley during the last half of the 1300s there were several major flows that probably caused severe flooding. While Graybill and his colleagues proposed a model in which these particularly severe flood events caused arroyo cutting such that it became impossible to reestablish</page><page sequence="49">Figure 19.

The computer simulation of agricultural success on the Salt River suggested that several periods contained both floods and low flows, creating periods of hardship when subsistence requirements for the population could not be met for extended periods. The combined problems of overpopulation, the crossing of the threshold of water availability and the large, destructive floods may well have led to the brink of disaster. The fact remains that only dispersed remnant populations endured along the Salt into the early 1400s (Hill, Lyons, and Clark 2006; Howard 2006; figure 24). The middle Gila was not subject to the same flooding (Graybill et al. 2006), and the implied famine conditions in the lower Salt may not have obtained there. Furthermore, the Gila was experiencing a good period for irrigation from 1143 to 1419 ce, and Gregory (Graybill et al.</page><page sequence="51">Figure 21.

Population Trends in the North American Southwest, 1200-1599 ce (reprinted from Wilcox, Gregory, and Hill 2007: fig. 12.25). 2006) suggests that during the late Civano phase (ca. 1350-1425 ce) population was more robust on the Gila than on the Salt (figure 21 ). In other words, the political relationships between the two areas may have become reversed during the late Classic-period interval often called the Polvoron phase - but see Hackbarth (1995) for an apt critique of the Polvoron concept. Nevertheless, we think Chenault (2000) has made a strong case for the superposition of Polvoron features on Civano-phase ones. During that time, the net population was reduced, however, and in this weakened state, the outlying neighbors of the Phoenix basin Hohokam soon found they had the power to destroy all of the Hohokam villages. By ca. 1450 ce, all archaeologically visible hamlets or villages in the Phoenix basin were depopulated, and what had been the largest and longest enduring population cluster in the North American South- west was no more. Having flowered brilliantly, Hohokam culture had withered and was gone.</page><page sequence="53">Table 3.

Population in the Salt River Valley, 1350-1399 ce (reprinted from Hill, Lyons, and Clark 2006: fig 6). Whence the Hohokam: A Tepiman Hypothesis By the time of Kino's visit in the 1690s (Burrus 1971), Piman speakers were living along the Gila, but not (so far as we know) along the Salt (Wilcox 1982). Some Pima oral history treats the Phoenix basin Hohokam as enemies whom they vanquished before they co-opted part of the old Hohokam domain as their own (see Hayden 1970; Bahr 1971; Bahr et al. 1994; Teague 1993). The burning of the Polvoron component on both the Pueblo Grande and Mesa Grande platform mounds may be evidence of such conflict (Downum and Bostwick 2003). Even so, as "Desert Hohokam" (Haury 1950), the attackers may have been lin- guistic cousins of the more precocious "Riverine Hohokam." Was there continuity of occupation in southern Arizona from Hohokam times to the present, even if initially such occupation was largely invisible archaeo- logically? Brett Hill and his colleagues (Hill et al. 2004; Hill, Lyons,</page><page sequence="56">158 * Journal of the Southwest Figure 24. Population in the Salt River Valley, 1400-1449 ce (reprinted from Hill, Lyons and Clark 2006: fig. 7). and Clark 2006; see also Wilcox 1988) advocate this position (but see Doelle 1981). Is there any alternative hypothesis that may better fit the facts - if only there were such facts? The Hohokam were not the only populations to drop below the archaeological "radar screen" in the southern Southwest by ca. 1450 ce. The extensive Casas Grandes regional and macro-regional settlement systems (figure 25; Wilcox 1991d, 1995; C. Schaafsma and Riley 1999b) also drop from sight. Before that happened, this cultural system was prob- ably a primary source of intellectual stimulation to populations in the Southwest well into the late 1300s (Riley 2005; Wilcox 2007). To the north it influenced a broad ecumene that stretched from the Hopi mesas on the west to the Zuni, Acoma, Pottery Mound, middle Rio Grande Valley, and Gran Quivira, and on to the Roswell area on the east (P. Schaafsma 2000, 2007; Riley 2005:105; Wilcox 2007; but see VanPool,</page><page sequence="57">Ancient Cultural Interplay ■&gt; 159 Figure 25. The Casas Gmndes Macro-regional Settlement System (after Wilcox 1991c: fig. 8.1) . VanPool, and Phillips 2007). Valuables produced at Paquime, or present there in large quantities, were distributed outward on a northwestern axis coincident with the distribution of Salado polychrome ceramics, and on a northeastward axis coincident with the distribution of El Paso Polychrome (figure 25; see Vokes and Gregory 2007; Wilcox 1991d, 2007; cf. Speth 2003). The collapse of this economic and intellectual system in the 1400s ce had profound effects on the relationship between the northern and southern Southwest (figure 21). Picking up on a suggestion made by Adolph Bandelier (1892:571 ),39 Carroll Riley (1982, 1987) has proposed that the Casas Grandes folk in the middle fifteenth century migrated westward into central Sonora to become the Opata villagers reported by Spanish observers during the middle 1500s ce. As noted earlier, the Opata then reportedly lived in clusters of medium-to-large irrigation- based villages that often were</page><page sequence="58">160 * Journal of the Southwest at war with one another and with similarly organized village clusters of Pima Bajo speakers (figure 6). Together, these populations are estimated to have numbered about sixty to eighty thousand people (Sauer 1935; Riley 1982, 1987; Reff 1991)- if the Spanish accounts are to be believed (but see McGuire and Villalpando 1989). European diseases and related factors soon decimated them, however, and by the time Jesuit observers described their descendents in the 1600s, profound changes in settlement organization and adaptation had occurred - and more were to follow (Mason and Brugge 1958; Reff 1991). No archaeological signatures for the putative 1500s settlement systems have yet been found (J. C. Kelley 1980:65). The survey led by Richard Pailes (1980) did find a post-1100 ce sequence of settlements in the Sonora Valley and several medium- sized villages dating to the 1300s, but none clearly date into the 1500s (compare Doolittle 1988). But have we yet looked in the most likely places? We think not. During the late 1200s in the northern Southwest there was a massive redeployment of Puebloan populations from the greater Mesa Verde region to the northern Rio Grande (Lipe 1995; Wilcox, Gregory, and Hill 2007). In the Salt River valley, facing famine, the leaders of a politi- cally unified population may well have been capable of a similarly bold emigration. They arguably were Tepiman speakers (Hayden 1970; Wilcox 1986b; Shaul and Hill 1998), as were the Pima Bajo in Sonora (Mason and Brugge 1958). If the "Tepiman connection" model (Wilcox 1986b) is correct, these linguistic ties may go back millennia, and the Hohokam would have known they had "cultural cousins" in irrigable Sonoran valleys to which they could appeal for help. If a large proportion of the Phoenix basin Hohokam did emigrate to central Sonora, just as their Casas Grandes neighbors were allegedly doing at that same time,40 the southern Southwest did not simply disappear by 1450 ce but was dra- matically reorganized. Spanish accounts show that there were continuing exchange connections during the middle 1500s between the northern Southwest and central Sonora (Riley 1987; Reff 1991). But how large were the latter settlements, and where were they located? Agreeing with a suggestion made by Pailes (1997) and Riley (2005:153, 170), we pro- pose that archaeologists need to look for their traces underneath many of the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century settlements. A model for such research can be found in the work Phil and Acelia Weigand (1996; figure 26) have done in the town of Etzatlan, Jalisco, where they live. By systematically observing each new exposure of</page><page sequence="59">Figure 26. Map of Aboriginal Settlement Features below Etzatldn, Jalisco, Mexico (reprinted from Weigand and Garcia de Weigand 1996).</page><page sequence="60">162 * Journal of the Southwest subsurface deposits revealed in sewer, water, electrical, cable, or other trenches, they have documented the structure of aboriginal settlement in this place. Visits they have made to towns in Sonora, including Cucurpe and San Ignacio, where they were able to observe similar exposures, led to the identification of prehispanic materials both in the trench profiles and in the back-dirt from them. Another approach in such settlements would be to contact the local cronistas fnunicipales, who often hear about prehispanic material found while digging in yards or the streets. Clearly, this kind of archaeology may require nontraditional approaches to problems of logistics and planning, but we are confident that it would yield many significant results. Conclusions In this essay we have reviewed the recent work done in Northwest Mexico with special attention to issues concerning the cultural connections between Mesoamerica and the American Southwest; presented a new theory in several versions about the nature of Hohokam political com- plexity during the Classic period; and considered a bold hypothesis about whither the Hohokam went after the Phoenix basin was depopulated by 1450 ce. We now turn in conclusion to the deeper methodological implications of these arguments. Consensus has much to do with the intellectual trajectory of scien- tific disciplines. It affects judgments about what ideas should be sup- ported and fostered, and which should be disparaged or rejected. The allocation of resources to conduct research, and even the possibility for some ideas to be heard, is thus affected. Consensus is not static, however, and ideas judged outlandish in one decade may seem much more plausible in another. Wilcox once asked Edward Spicer if anthro- pology had a mission. "No," he replied; but then, ducking his head and looking at him intently, he added, "It is a struggle." Consensus may reflect a belief in what Thomas Kuhn (1970) called "normal sci- ence." To those of us who believe instead that science cannot advance knowledge without also rethinking our most treasured assumptions in light of what is currently known - and known to be unknown (Wilcox 2005a; Wilcox et al. 2006) - consensus is what we often must struggle against. It is normal for humans to crave certainty. Sadly, however, the moral message of science since Einstein overthrew Newton is that we</page><page sequence="61">Ancient Cultural Interplay * 163 must learn to live with uncertainty (Wilcox 2005a). Fallibility is what the invocation of multiple working hypotheses is all about (Chamberlin 1965; Rescher 1985). Prior to the 1970s, West Mexico was repeatedly characterized by North American and Mesoamerican archaeologists alike as a zone of marginal development that was lightly populated, without monumental architec- ture or complex social organization, and occupied only by rancho- or village-style lifeways. According to this view, when the area was finally civilized, at the beginning of the Post- Classic period, complex traits of civilization arrived from Central Mexico. This view still dominates much of the literature concerning Mesoamerica, even though intensive field- work and publication, based on the cultural-landscape concepts of Pedro Armillas, has completely disproved that characterization (Weigand 1991, 1993, 2004; Stuart 2005). We now have shown that civilized lifeways began in West Mexico as early as anywhere else in Mesoamerica, and that complex social systems, irrigation, monumental architecture, and great demographic concentrations were all part of its landscape. That West Mexico did not accept Olmec or major Teotihuacan influences simply means that neither one of these complexes was as penetrating as formerly thought, and that West Mexico faced the Pacific rather than the Gulf of Mexico. Dogmas die hard, and West Mexico is an example of how major paradigm shifts can occur when there is intensive and comprehensive fieldwork in relatively poorly understood regions. We suspect that similar work in northern Mexico, especially along the Pacific coast, may also result in major shifts of present interpretations (see figure 3). The rhetoric of the 1960s "new archaeology" a generation ago called on us to formulate hypotheses, derive test implications from them, and then to test those hypotheses by collecting new data (Fritz and Plog 1970). Often forgotten in this call to action was what the English archaeologist R. G. Collingwood (1939) called the "logic of question and answer." Questions create the intellectual context for hypotheses, which are tentative answers. Both questions and answers have histories, and each can help to frame fruitful research. Science is a much more dynamic and complex process than the "new archaeologists" imagined. Their insistence on hypotheses alone often obscured or unwisely ignored the larger intellectual context of their claims to knowledge. Polariza- tion of debate was often the result. It seems a different epistemology is required if we are to move on to more fruitful discussions (see Wilcox 2005a; Wilcox et al. 2006).</page><page sequence="62">164 * Journal of the Southwest Let us agree that science is about debate and what the American philosopher Nicholas Rescher (1985) called the "strife of systems." Denying or dismissing unwelcome hypotheses is not the same thing as testing them. Only when a hypothesis is put to the test, and found to be wrong or not supported by empirical evidence that has been sought and found lacking, should consensus be accepted that it can be put aside - at least until new evidence again can be found to support it. And so the debate goes on. Until Carroll Riley's (1982, 1987, 2005) model of the "Sonoran statelets" - as he provocatively called them - can be scientifically tested, significant alternative hypotheses for explaining the trajectory of history in the southern Southwest will remain viable, mak- ing all alternative local explanations suspect. A new era of widespread and intensive archaeological survey and excavations in northwestern Mexico is not only long overdue: We submit that further progress on fundamental questions in Southwestern archaeology cannot proceed until such work is accomplished. + Acknowledgments This paper results from a reworking and integration of essays prepared for three different venues: Wilcox's (1996b) paper "Organizational Parameters of Southwest/Mesoamerican Connectivity," presented at the 1996 Southwest Symposium held in Tempe, Arizona; Wood and Wilcox's (2000) paper, "Where Did All the Flowers Go? Warfare and Religion in the Evolution of Hohokam Political Organization," presented at the Hohokam Political Organization symposium organized by David R. Abbott and David R. Wilcox, sixty-fifth annual meeting of the Society for American Archaeology, Philadelphia, April 7, 2000; and Wilcox's paper "Whence the Hohokam: A Tepiman Hypothesis" (Wilcox 2006b) presented at the Third International Colloquium of the Pathways of the Northwest seminar held at Northern Arizona University, May 22-25, 2006.

Pyrite-encrusted mirrors with pseudo-cloisonne designs manufactured in west Mexico and found in Hohokam sites are the most dramatic physical evidence for such contacts (Woodward 1941). Haury's (1937a) inference that oval earthen "bowls" found in Arizona were a local form of the Mesoamerican ballcourt (see Scarborough and Wilcox 1991) was the capstone of his argument for continuing Mesoamerican contacts, which the presence of a small rubber (guayule) ball further supported (Haury 1937b). However, there are grounds for questioning the ballcourt hypothesis (Ferdon 1967), which Wilcox (Wilcox and Sternberg 1983; Wilcox 1991d, 1992) attempted to address. The basic truth is that we cannot now observe what activities took place in the Hohokam courts, but a basic fact is that they were excavated into the ground and the dirt was piled up in an oval, vulva-like shape (Grenard and Grenard 1992): they are thus portals, like sipapus in Hopi kivas, places of communication with the underworld where fertility rites probably did take place, possibly involving the playing of a kicking game or stick game (Wilcox 1992). Many Mesoamerican analogies can be found for the emergence idea, and fertility is also one of the principal themes associated with Mesoamerican ballcourts (Gillespie 1991). That minimally they were a form of public architecture still remains the hypothesis with the greatest support (see Wilcox and Sternberg 1983). 2. Franz Boas (Tozzer 1909:286) identihed J^redencK Ward 1'utnam (isay- 1915), John Wesley Powell (1834-1902), and Daniel Brinton (1837-1899) as the "three fathers" of American anthropology. 3. Although Riley is a valued colleague and was one of Weigand s professors at Southern Illinois University, we doubt that the Aztlan label he suggests should be accepted. By his own discussion (Riley 2005:5), the mythical Aztlan of the Aztecs was said to be a place where tomatoes and chilies were grown: neither were present in the aboriginal Southwest. Nevertheless his book is a valuable</page><page sequence="64">166 * Journal of the Southwest and wide-ranging synthesis aimed at both a popular and professional audience. His argument for a "Mesoamericanization" process is interesting and important, raising many issues that we discuss further in this article. 4. Jane Hill (2007) argues that Zunian is indeed a linguistic isolate, and that this fact means it must have differentiated from some other language some 7,000 to 8,000 years ago; Gregory and Wilcox (2007) point out that the same would be true for small, compact language families like Keresan and Tanoan. The search for a Uto-Aztecan "homeland" thus may be ended by recognizing the polythetic character of Uto-Aztecan, or what linguists call its "meshiness" (Jane Hill, personal communication, 2006; see Miller 1984), and accepting the corridor-as-a-whole as the homeland. 5. Why would north-south communication have been preferentially maintained along the Uto-Aztecan corridor while being severed latterly, creating differences of language? While serious study of this question is needed, it is worth noting that what Sauer (1932) called the "Road to Cibola" demonstrates the connectivity and relative ease of movement along this corridor. Weigand views this corridor as the major route via which turquoise was imported into Mesoamerica on what is called the "Aztatlan horizon" (Kelly 1945; Harbottle and Weigand 1992). 6. In a monothetic set, all the criteria for the inclusion of an element in the set must be satisfied. Not so in polythetic sets. Consider, for example, an ordered set of neighboring animal populations like frogs or birds: between contiguous sets A and B there may be only slight variation, and so, too, between B and C, C and D, and so on. But if one were to bring sets N and A together, they could not interbreed, the measure in biology of what is called a "species" (Mayr 1942). Similar polythetic sets exist among languages (Golla 2000). The Uto-Aztecan language family, for example, is a polythetic set. 7. Phil Weigand in 1995 consented to be interviewed about the history of institutional efforts in this area, thus directly informing our text, which has been updated for the present analysis. 8. At the Third International Colloquium of the "Pathways of the North- west" Seminar, Northern Arizona University, May 22-25, 2006, Gary Nabhan reported that he had shown pictures of the fish designs on Mimbres pottery to Sen Indians, who told him they do resemble marine fish, but drawn in the way they see them after eating mullet containing a hallucinogenic substance! 9. Modern development near Puerto Pefiasco (Rocky Point) and other points along the Sonoran coast is exposing archaeological remains in concheros (shell mounds). A recent research project led by Martha Garcia and Luis Alberto Mar- tinez (2006) for the Centro Regional Sonora of INAH has discovered what they believe are Southwestern potsherds, possibly from the Mogollon region, and Antelope Wells obsidian. These are preliminary assessments that it will be inter- esting to learn more about as more of this work is conducted and published. 10. Important support for this hypothesis is found in the presence of Nas- sarius shells in Mimbres sites dating from ca. 1100 ce; at Chaco Canyon; and westward in the Flagstaff area, which was linked to the Chaco world ca. 1130-1250 ce. Nassarius are rare in Hohokam sites at this time (see Wilcox, Keller, and Ortiz 2000; Wilcox 2002). In the J. R Babbitt Collection at the</page><page sequence="65">Ancient Cultural Interplay * 167 Museum of Northern Arizona of funerary lots from more than 250 sites in an area east of Flagstaff, Arizona, Fran Biehl (1996), a student in the MNA/NAU Archaeological Field School, found that 3,978 of 29,676 shells (13.4 percent) were Nassarius, a small sea whelk used to make shell beads. The three million Nassarius shells found at Paquime date to a later time (see also Bradley 1996; Yokes and Gregory 2007). 11. Alternatively, if the macaws were transported up from southeastern Mexico, crossing the Chihuahuan Desert or skirting it on the west side, the Mimbres may have obtained them at its northern edge. One thinks of the sites reported by Brand (1943:154) near Laguna Patos in the Rio Carmen drainage: "The strong representation of Mimbres ware at the spring sites around Laguna Patos is of interest. The presence of smoothed corrugated ware, normally associated with Mimbres Black-on-white in New Mexico, lends strength to the idea that Mimbres culture may have had a far southern colony here." Or perhaps they there to rendezvous with hunter- gatherers coming in from the Chihuahuan Desert bearing gifts, including scarlet macaws, in exchange for maize. 12. McKusick (2001) argues that the young age of macaws in the Southwest, including those at Wupatki, indicates that they were sacrificed on the vernal equinox as part of ceremonies influenced by Mexican Tezcatlipoca beliefs, but Riley (2005:42) expresses serious doubt about this hypothesis, due to lack of evidence. However, at Paquime a few generations later, where scarlet macaws were being raised, many of them, too, were apparently sacrificed, together with military macaws, on or around the vernal equinox (Riley 2005:137). 13. On an earlier time horizon, iron-pynte mirrors with pseudo-cloisonne designs came into the Hohokam area (Woodward 1941; Haury 1976). They were made in West Mexico (Holien 1977). They are rare in Hohokam sites, and little else points to a steady trade relationship over the one thousand-plus miles that separate Jalisco from southern Arizona. One model that might explain such a distribution was suggested by Mary Helms (1979) for ancient Panama, whereby people from one area traveled to a distant place to apprentice themselves to shamans, returning home bearing a physical token of the fact that they had done so. If Tepiman was spoken continuously from southern Arizona south into Durango, that could have facilitated such a relationship (Wilcox 1986b). 14. Burrus and Rodack (1987) also published a supplement to this catalogue in which thirty of the Bandelier images are reproduced in color, including the one of Casas Grandes. 15. It would be interesting to know if Algonquin or Iroquoian speakers, for example, also have flower- world concepts of a spiritual afterlife. If not, then the like- lihood that such ideas emerged after the breakup of Amerind would be greater. 16. As another example, consider the discussion by T. J. Ferguson (2007) of what anthropologists know about Zuni creation stories. At the advanced seminar held at the Colton House in October 2001, Stephen Kowalewski, one of the general discussants, criticized Ferguson for failing to situate his essay in the broader comparative framework of American studies or world ethnology. Wilcox agreed but pointed out that Ferguson's excellent paper was a good first step. One of Ferguson's findings is that after their emergence in the Grand</page><page sequence="66">168 * Journal of the Southwest Canyon, the Zuni began to migrate up the Little Colorado River valley: "At one of the first springs they came to, slime was washed off their bodies, their webbed hands and feet were cut, and their genitals, originally placed on their forehead, were rearranged so that people came to appear as they do today." In The Way of the Masks, Levi-Strauss (1982:78-79) recounts a Kwakiutl myth in which a culture hero undertakes "a long peregrination in the course of which he triumphed over adversaries, transforming them into various animals, and gave a normal anatomy to a couple of humans who were incapable of procreating because they had their sexual organs on their foreheads." Clearly there is some kind of cultural relationship between this Kwakiutl tale from the northwest coast and the Zuni story. Significantly, Levi-Strauss (1982:79) continues: "For the student of comparative mythology, the interest of these strong versions is all the greater for being found, in barely modified form, in South America. Thus they seem to belong to a very archaic layer of the mythology of the New World" (emphasis added). Until an adequate comparative framework can be established, we suggest that local interpretations of oral traditions or archaeological iconography must remain inadequate and unconvincing. 17. In their original formulation, C. Schaafsma and Riley (1999a:248) go further, proposing that "it would be concordant with what we are beginning to understand about Mesoamerica, as well as the ethnographic pueblo world to the north, if a "cacique" (Marcus and Zeitlin 1994), with the essential religious objects that declared his right to rule and his accompanying priests and other retainers, moved into the Casas Grandes valley and precipitated the development of Paquime. Such a leader and his entourage may well have come from the Durango area . . . , or from the sophisticated cultures of the Pacific Coast." Why, then, we must ask, are there none of the specific "religious objects" or iconography at Paquime that are known in Durango or the Pacific Coast sites at this time? Polly Schaafsma (1999:192) was on much firmer ground when she stated that "the lack of strong and detailed iconographic parallels as such indicates a lack of actual Mesoamerican presence in the North" (see also P. Schaafsma and Taube 2006:275). 18. The dating of when this happened at Pueblo Grande is uncertain. The capping of this stage of construction has Gila Polychrome above it, while below it is a radiocarbon date of 1240 ce (Christian Downum and Todd Bostwick, personal communication, 2000). We here follow Gregory's (1991) assessment of 1250 ce as the date when compounds were put around the platform mounds and structures began to be built on top. 19. Frank Hamilton Cushing was the first archaeologist to grasp the essen- tials of this system. He reports in his "itinerary," for example, on February 17, 1887, that from Hole-in-the-Rock "we could see ... the great yellow mounds of Los Pueblitos [Pueblo Grande], even the mound beyond, near Tempe [Plaza Tempe], and Los Hornos, which seemed, thus beheld, to be all of them parts of a system of towns as the scattered mounds of Los Pueblitos themselves had seemed to be parts of a single town" (Hinsley and Wilcox 2002:155). 20. On the concept of a confederacy, see "Confederation" in Hodge 1907:337-38; see also Spielmann 1994 for a more recent discussion focused on the Puebloan Southwest.</page><page sequence="67">Ancient Cultural Interplay &lt;• 169 21. In table 1, the 24,000 estimate for the population of the Phoenix basin is taken from Wilcox (1991a:263). This breaks down to about 15,000 people in the lower Salt Valley and 9,000 in the middle Gila Valley. For a more recent (and smaller) estimate based on enumeration of estimates of rooms in each Phoenix basin settlement, see table 3 in this article. 22. J. Scott Wood arrived at this figure by multiplying the number of trash mounds by four households of five persons each. 23. Fresh thought and new comparisons on this model would be welcome. In Zacatecas and adjacent regions, Weigand (1991) argued that the primary social function of ballcourts in sites of the Teuchitlan tradition was to adjudi- cate disputes. In this region, monumental and sub-monumental ballcourts first appear at the same time as political differentiation within the tradition's core area (Weigand 1993; Williams and Weigand 1999). They are part of the process marking the formation of what Chi (1936) called a "key economic area," which set the core off from all surrounding regions - a differential social evolution of remarkable proportions (Weigand 2007.). The peak building period is now estimated to be between 150 bce and 150 ce, and just after that, ca. 150 ce, a chinampa irrigation system "pumped up" (so to speak) from more modest beginnings. Overall, the Teuchitlan tradition dates are based on thirty-five new carbon- 14 dates from recent excavations at the Guachimontones, and another thirty-five or so from the Llano Grande and Navajas, from 350 bce to 450-500 ce, although there is an earlier phase that may take the sequence back to ca. 800 bce. This dating is based on nearly 100 carbon- 14 dates from Guachimontones, Huitzilapa, Llano Grande, and Navajas. 24. By color coding the maps in Canouts 1975 using their tables for sites with Casa Grande Red-on-buff, we find that there were three small sites - AZ U:6:18, 97, and 110, the last with a ballcourt - that probably persisted into the early Classic period. They are situated in a cluster southeast of Azatlan on the east side of the Verde and north of Sycamore Creek. Along the Salt, between Blue Point Ranger Station and Stewart Mountain Dam there were five early Classic sites. The depression at the Blue Point site (AZ U:6:40 [ASU]) has no embankments and Wilcox no longer regards it as a ballcourt (Wood still holds out hope for it). A Classic-period site was built near Fort McDowell late in 1300s ce, apparently an expansion from the Phoenix basin (Bandelier 1892). 25. True, there is a Soho-phase component or anaketown that is immediately contiguous to the earlier village site (Haury 1976), but we think it is significant that this is not directly on top of the earlier ceremonial precincts. 26. Platform mounds had already begun to have an important ritual role in the 1000s, as demonstrated at Snaketown where Haury (1976) excavated Mound 16, the northernmost mound surrounding the large central plaza (Wilcox, McGuire, and Sternberg 1981). It was ten meters in diameter and was surrounded by a wooden palisade, but had no features on top. For the architectural evolution of Hohokam platform mounds see Gregory (1988). 27. Their statement, however, that "ball court events would have been only secondarily amenable to kin-group agendas involving social and economic interchange" (S. Fish and P. Fish 2000:380) neglects the apparent fact that the</page><page sequence="68">170 * Journal of the Southwest multi-courtyard groupings who buried their dead in their own cemeteries (so- called "suprahousehold" groups), which probably were kin- based, first appear at the same moment as ballcourts do, during the early Colonial Gila Butte phase (Wilcox and Sternberg 1983). Wilcox (1987a) contends that the ballcourts would have been excellent ritual arenas in which these emergent (and probably landholding) kin groups could mark their identities vis-a-vis one another and engage in ceremonial exchanges. The shell exchange system was also profoundly reorganized at that time, suggesting that a new approach to marriage making was also correlated with the appearance of ballcourts (Wilcox and Sternberg 1983; Wilcox 1991a, 1991d). 28. The same finding was made using somewhat different assumptions in a previous study (see Wilcox 1988). 29. Turney's (1929) map treated Las Colinas as a huge village at the end of Canal System 2. More likely, however, it represents at least two separate villages (see also Howard 2006), one with mounds 3 and 4 within a huge compound (the largest Hohokam compound known), which we propose calling "Kalfus" using an older name for the site; and the other centered on mounds 7 and 8, which should retain the name Las Colinas (Abbott et al. 1988). 30. Pueblo del Monte (Weaver 1977) ranks third and perhaps should also be regarded as a secondary center. And Los Hornos (Wilcox, Howard, and Nelson 1990), too, ranks fourth; perhaps it should also be regarded as a secondary center. These sites are known to have only one platform mound and no tower, however; whereas La Ciudad had both a platform mound and a tower (Wilcox 1987b) and Las Acequias had two platform mounds. 31. Dualistic political systems are also known elsewhere in the Americas, sometimes involving complex urban, state-level societies (see, for example, Zantwijk 1985; Gillespie 1989). 32. Plain shell toads/frogs go back to the Colonial period in the Hohokam sequence, becoming very frequent in the Classic period (Jernigan 1978; David Gregory, personal communication 2000). Toads are also shown hanging from the necks of anthropomorphic Hohokam figurines (Haury 1976:fig. 11.10). Quite possibly they were the symbol of a deity. 33. They may have modified concepts taken from the Chacoan system, where a frog symbol (Judd 1954:297) and raptorial bird symbols are known. Two of the latter were found at the Houck Great House (NA8440) in unpublished excava- tions by the Museum of Northern Arizona in connection with the construction of Interstate 40. They are made of a fine, polished limestone with black paint outlining the raptorial-bird shape (MNA collections). 34. Similarly large Sacaton-phase-style pit structures were found at Snaketown facing one another (see Haury 1976) and may also have been council houses (Wilcox, McGuire, and Sternberg 1981). The presence of such a structure on the Mesa Grande mound is moot. 35. Howard, however, believes that there was a canal head north of Casa Grande, coming south off the Gila River, which would have served compound sites to its west, where a recent survey found no platform mounds (Gregory and</page><page sequence="69">Ancient Cultural Interplay * 171 Huckleberry 1994). Their absence creates the appearance of a gap of platform mounds between Casa Grande and the Sweetwater site (Wilcox 1988). 36. Using our experience at Los Hornos as a standard (Wilcox, Howard, and Nelson 1990), Jerry Howard and David Wilcox systematically compared all known villages in the Salt River valley dating to the period 1200-1450 ce to arrive at population estimates based on estimated pithouses in each village, assuming five persons per pithouse. 37. Creation of this database was a collaboration among the Museum of Northern Arizona, the Center for Desert Archaeology (CDA), and Western Mapping Co. Initially, Wilcox assembled the data from Arizona site repositories, the ARMS repository in New Mexico, and many professional contacts. Since then, more data have been assembled by CDA and integrated into the database, a process that is ongoing. 38. Some qualification of this conclusion should be noted, given the relative lack of intensive archaeological survey in northwestern Chihuahua. Bandelier (1892:569-70), who was a superb observer, notes that "it is not improbable that the Casas Grandes region ... at one time contained a population more dense than that of any other part of the Southwest inhabited by sedentary aborigines." Comparative density is an interesting issue that merits more work, and the length of time there were dense populations in the Casas Grandes region relative to that in the Phoenix basin also merits more attention. 39. Bandelier (1892:571) reports that "while I was in Eastern Sonora several Opata Indians assured me that Casas Grandes was built by the Opatas in former times." From what he goes on to say, it is clear he was skeptical of this claim. Riley (2005:177) himself now says he is "at present somewhat two minded about the matter." 40. Doolittle (1988) plausibly argues that the data discovered in the Sonora Valley during the Richard Pailes (1980) survey could be explained in terms of local processes of growth. However, if the 1500s settlements have not yet been found, the hypothesis of migration from Casas Grandes remains moot.</page><page sequence="70">172 -fr Journal of the Southwest References Cited Abbott, David R 1994a Hohokam Social Structure and Irrigation Management: The Ceramic Evidence from the Central Phoenix Basin.
