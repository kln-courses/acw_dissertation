The object is to reach non-members in the most effective way possible: by face-to-face communication from our members. Take this journal with you to lunch and tell your colleagues about NCTE. Who knows, you may find yourself going to the San Diego convention on us! Here's How the Campaign Works For each new member you bring into the Council, you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you are strengthening the association. But in addition to that, you will be eligible for some more tangible-and very useful-bonuses. Here's how the campaign will work: • FOR EACH NEW MEMBER APPLICATION which you send us, you'll receive a coupon worth $2.00 toward any NCTE book purchase or membership renewal before December 31, 1975. The more memberships you sponsor, the more coupons you will get. • FOR TWO OR MORE NEW MEMBER APPLICATIONS sponsored by you, your name will be entered into our Each-One-Reach-One prize drawing! You only need to sponsor two new members to be elibigle for the drawing-but your name will be entered again for each and every membership you send us after your initial qualifying two. The more members you sponsor, the better your chances at winning! The Prizes • 1st PRIZE: an expense-paid trip to the 1975 NCTE Annual Convention in San Diego, California, November 27-29. The prize includes travel expenses, lodging for four nights, convention registration fees, and a ticket to the NCTE annual banquet. • 2nd PRIZE: a life membership in NCTE. Your membership dues will be paid for life in the section of your choice (college, elementary, secondary). • 3rd PRIZE: a comprehensive membership for one year in NCTE. Comprehensive membership entitles you to subscriptions to all NCTE journals for the year, plus copies of all NCTE books and publications which are published during that time. A compre- hensive membership normally costs $60 per year. • 4th, 5th, and 6th PRIZES: one year's membership in NCTE. The Rules 1. Any NCTE member who sponsors two new $15 memberships between March 15 and October 1, 1975, is eligible for the prize drawing. 2. For each additional new member you sponsor, your name is entered again for the drawing. 3. A person may win only one prize from the drawing. 4. A new member is defined as one who has not been a member of NCTE for 12 months prior to application. 5. The NCTE Executive Committee, headquarters staff and families are not eligible for prizes.</page><page sequence="3">6. The drawing will be conducted by Peer, Hunt, and Curzon, auditors for NCTE. 7. Campaign ends October 1, 1975. Drawing will be held October 10, 1975. Winners will be notified immediately. 8. Void where prohibited by law. Here's What You Do By now, you should have already received the "Each-One-Reach-One" campaign packet. The letter within it outlines a good procedure to follow in recruiting new members. If you don't have it or simply left it at home, try this: Lend one of your colleagues a copy of this journal to examine. Encourage the individual to join NCTE and offer to sponsor the membership application. Ask your colleague to complete the membership form at the bottom of this page and return it to you. Then, mail the form-along with your name, address, and phone number- to NCTE headquarters. You will receive your bonus coupon for each membership you sponsor immediately upon receipt at NCTE. As soon as we receive two memberships from you, your name will be entered in the drawing. Feel free to make copies of the application form if you need more. Please do your part to help! A strong professional association of English teachers helps you, your students, and the entire educational community. Good luck! Hope to see you in San Diego!

But are we on guard against a kind of potato language which has been gaining ascendancy over the years, tempting us to abandon plain speech for doughy, flaccid, tedious babble which turns up in the oratory of politicians, in advertisements for automobiles and airlines, in periodicals, in the mouths of mass murderers and, alias, in many cur- rent books? Many of its key words are familiar to all of us: meaningful, related, creative, viable, and especially love. Love, the biggest fix of all, the great solver, a word that perches on the vol- cano of its own meaning like a paper bird- a word which, it is claimed, will make everything work out. -Paula Fox Inherent in any reading program one decides to adopt should be the provision of opportunities for children to make choices, for them to have options. The teacher must provide young people with chances both to succeed and to err, since both possess value for learning. When it comes to read- ing, or any other area of the curriculum, the most capable teachers are those who encourage individ- ualized activities, have well-organized classes, and possess the ability to pinpoint accurately the in- structional needs of their children. They possess, too, a philosophy of education which is most con- cerned with learning that is relevant to students' own lives. There is no doubt in my mind of the efficacy of an individualized reading program to support this concern. -Arlene M. Pillar Over thirty-five years ago, a researcher defined the average reader as feminine, twenty-three and a half years old, possessing three years of high school education, reading three books every two weeks, generally light fiction except for a non- fiction book and a "good" novel once a month, and taking most of her reading from the public library. That study has not been replicated, and one wonders whether it could be. -Alan C.

Just as we encourage children to experience the best in literature, art or music, so should we help them experience the finest that the film form has to offer, for all these art forms will facilitate their emotional and intellectual growth, give them plea- sure, and may stimulate their own creative works. -Carole Cox In general, today's child is more visual, better informed, and intellectually more aware of his or her environment than the child of twenty years ago. The principal reason for these differences appears to be that children today have been ex- posed from birth to a continuing bombardment of visual stimulation. The primary medium has been television, of course, but don't discount the impact of other forms of visual and audiovisual communication to which children are subjected- pictures in publications, billboards, cartoons, movies, slides, catalogs, and so forth. Perhaps 90% of the stimuli to which we respond each day are visual or auditory, not written. Yet, schools con- tinue to operate in the reading-writing mode. With apologies to Flip Wilson, what kids see is not what they get, at least not in school. -Ralph Nelsen Using methods of affective education, young children can learn about propaganda strategies by having discussions about how they feel in certain situations, by roleplaying, and by socio- drama. They can analyze interactions between people and examine tactics which manipulate peo- pie into doing what someone else wants. Analogies can be made between examples from children's literature and advertising ploys. LL 511</page><page sequence="13">A Celebration of the Bicentennial!

Credit cards, installment plans, catalogues, advertisements, and distant purchasing have prompted people to use the mail system much more frequently now than in the past. As one watches the greeting card counters, one is also reminded that notes and cards are fast becoming one of the necessities of life. Adults, too busy to pen their own thoughts, or perhaps too illiterate in the art of letter writing, often choose sentimental or catchy greeting cards rather than send their own thoughts in a hand- written note. Because letter writing is important in the lives of individuals, and because it ranks second only to the spoken word, it should have a major place in the language arts curriculum in the elementary school program. -Hazel Sylvester Much has been made of the brainstorming tech- niques used by advertising agencies to develop new slogans and products. What teachers some- times forget is that the same techniques can be used within a school to develop new teaching ideas and approaches. In a brainstorming session anything goes; the ideas, no matter how far-out, must flow as rapidly as possible and only after the session is over should the evaluation of ideas be made. Too much emphasis on shifting good ideas from bad during the exciting atmosphere of a brainstorming session will only dry up the potential for new perspectives. -Charles R. Duke And now I say that I really cannot define crea- tivity because it is intangible. Creativity is thoughts locked away in my subconscious and in the minds of thousands of other people, just waiting for the proper stimulus. Creativity is a mood and an in- dividual s expression of that mood, whether it be with the pen or paint or clay. Creativity is an apt description of a day yet to come. Creativity is the world freshly seen. It is the conception, the process and the product. Creativity is releasing an unknown part of one's own being, and this has yet to be defined. -Dorothy C.
