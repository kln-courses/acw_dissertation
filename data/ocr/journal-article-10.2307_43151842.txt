<plain_text><page sequence="1">Unseen Warhol/Seeing Barthes Nicholas de Villiers Another opposition destroyed is that of inner /outer. Consider the Western theater of the last few centuries. Its function is essentially to reveal what is reputed to be secret (. . .) while concealing the very artifice of the process of revelation (. . .) With Bunraku, the sources of theater are exposed in their void. What is expelled from the stage is hysteria, that is theater itself, and what is put in its place is the action necessary for the production of the spectacle - work is substituted for inferiority. - Roland Barthes, 'Lesson in Writing'1 Roland Barthes's Camera Lucida: Reflections on Photography advances a theory of photography with a now famous theoretical distinction between the Studium , what a photo is 'about', its social and historical meaning, and the Punctum , that aspect or detail of a photo which 'pricks' the viewer individually and uncannily.2 In this manner, Barthes considers a series of photographs, including a portrait by Duane Michals of Andy Warhol (see Figure 1, Andy Warhol , 1958) which is not reproduced in the text. Barthes expands his theory of the punctum by way of this picture: There is another (. . .) expansion of the punctum : when, paradoxically, while remaining a 'detail,' it fills the whole picture. Duane Michals has photographed Andy Warhol: a provocative portrait, since Warhol hides his face behind both hands. I have no desire to comment intellectually on this game of hide-and-seek (which belongs to the Studium); since for me, Warhol hides nothing; he offers his hands to be read, quite openly; and the punctum is not the gesture but the slightly repellent substance of those spatulate nails, at once soft and hard-edged. (45) This 'game of hide-and-seek' links up with Michel Foucault's theory of 'games of truth', in particular where the 'truth' of the subject is sought in his sexuality, the secret truth of his identity.3 In the inter- view 'The End of the Monarchy of Sex' Foucault diagnoses 'this great "sexography" which makes us decipher sex as the universal secret.'4 Hidden/revealed is the paradigmatic opposition within confessional discourse, and this also constitutes the mechanism of 'the closet'. Eve Sedgwick has pointed to the Proustian logic whereby 'the spectacle of the closeť is effectively presented as 'the truth of the homosexual '. Critics have</page><page sequence="2">22 Paragraph debated whether Warhol and Barthes were 'open' about being gay. Barthes has been read as 'closeted' by D. A. Miller in his Bringing Out Roland Barthes ,5 but it is perhaps more accurate to say that both Barthes and Warhol have been closeted, rather than that they were closeted. Both Warhol and Barthes propose an alternative to the notion of an identity 'hidden behind' the surface. Both question the role that the fece plays in these games of identity, as true marker of identity and as mask. Barthes explains the epigraph to Roland Barthes by Roland Barthes: 'All of this must be considered as if spoken by a character in a novel - or rather by several characters (...) the image-repertoire is taken over by several masks (personae), distributed according to the depth of the stage (and yet no one - personne , as we say in French - is behind them). This figure of the masked subject on stage ('I advance pointing to my mask') is a favorite one throughout Barthes's writing, which considers language itself as theater. But it is in reference to another form of theater, Japanese Bunraku puppet theater (which Barthes reads as the antithesis of anthropomorphic and metaphysical Western theater), that we find a figure which seems to resonate best with Barthes's critique of concealed meaning. In 'Lesson in Writing', Barthes discusses the master who controls the Bunraku puppet: As for the master, it has already been said that his head is left uncovered, smooth and bare, without make-up, this conferring on him a ciuic (and not</page><page sequence="3">Unseen Warhol /Seeing Barthes 23 theatrical) appearance; his face is offered to the spectator for reading, but what is so carefully and so preciously given to be read is that there is nothing to be read - here we find that exemption from meaning which does indeed illumine so many works of the East and which we are scarcely able to comprehend, since for us to attack meaning is to conceal or oppose it, never to absent it. (Image - Music - Text, 173) This figure is crucial as an alternative to a figure like that of 'the closet' which is so important to D. A. Miller's Bringing Out Roland Barthes, in which Miller imagines only the possibility of an opposed or concealed meaning, never an exempted or absented one. Barthes's most explicitly homoerotic texts, namely the posthumously published Incidents (in particular 'Soirées de Paris' which seems to be the source of much of Miller's rather condescending pity),7 his discussion of the young writer 'F.B.',8 and his 1979 preface to Renaud Camus's novel of gay cruising Tricks ,9 all treat homosexuality in a way which refuses to militate, assure responsibility, or moralize ( Rustle , 291). Rather, Barthes's preface to Tricks should be taken as an example of what he has called 'affectionate criticism',10 and his treatment of Camus's narratives as 'neutral (. . .) surfaces without shadows, without ulterior motives' ( Rustle , 292) proposes an approach to writing and sexuality which does not participate in 'the game of interpretation' (292) but figures a certain type of opacity. Barthes's assertion that there is nothing behind his mask, 'personne' behind his 'personae', is echoed by Warhol in his famous aphorism from an interview with Gretchen Berg: 'If you want to know all about Andy Warhol, just look at the surface of my paintings and films and me, and there I am. There's nothing behind it.'11 Truman Capote also famously quipped that Warhol was like a 'sphinx without a riddle'. The Duane Michals portrait of Warhol plays off this persona of Warhol's, and Barthes's reading of the portrait echoes his reading of the Bunraku puppet-master whose face is 'given to be read' in the way that Warhol offers his hands 'openly' to be read. Thus, the alternative to 'concealed' identity which both Barthes and Warhol seem to be proposing is rather an 'absenting' (Barthes somewhat ironically reflects: 'Evidently he dreams of a world which would be exempt from meaning (as one is from military service)' ( Roland , 87)). This is indeed 'provocative' as Barthes notes because such an absenting of the subject (and of meaning) is open to the critiques of such gay theorists as D. A. Miller and Leo Bersani who find in this practice a collusion with homophobia, what Bersani calls 'The Gay Absence'.12 But 'gay absence' is not necessarily the goal of Warhol's</page><page sequence="4">24 Paragraph project (difficult as it may be to ascertain what Warhol's 'project' was). Steven Shaviro has insisted that Warhol hides nothing behind his surfaces, there is no 'depth, denial, or struggle' to decipher or uncover.13 On a similar note, in an essay on Warhol entided 'That Old Thing, Art. . .', Barthes explains that 'the Pop artist does not stand behind his work, and he himself has no depth: he is merely the surface of his pictures: no signified, no intention, anywhere.'14 Rather, as in Barthes's reading of Bunraku, Warhol substitutes work for interiority. The editors of Pop Out: Queer Warhol explain that they wish to recover Pop's 'queer context and content' against the 'de-gaying' of Warhol in much criticism of Pop Art.15 This also adequately describes the work performed by Simon Watney's piece 'Queer Andy'. Watney begins with an anecdote about getting busted during a screening of Lonesome Cowboys in order to specify the seductive, and illicit, queer context and content of the film and of Warhol's work. This strategy of recovery and specification works against what Watney calls a 'virtual cliff-face of denial and displacement' in critical work on Warhol, which tends to stress technical matters and the 'banality' or 'arbitrariness' (thus inconsequentiality) of his subject matter. Against the 'obliterative homophobia' of contemporary Pop Art criticism, Watney wishes to argue that Warhol 'represented a public face of queerness. He was transparently queer.'16 I share Watney's desire to locate Warhol's life within a history of homophobia and its resistances, and his wish to examine Warhol's 'curious, quintessentially queer combination of intense shyness and dandyism' (23). Certainly, the re-politicization of dandyism and camp is a crucial task in an arena of criticism which uses these two words 'dandyism' and 'camp' in Susan Sontag's sense as de-politicized and de-politicizing.17 The downside of a gay response to Sontag and others' de-gaying and depoliticization of camp and dandyism is the recourse to essential notions of gayness or queerness. What does it mean to say that Warhol exhibited behaviors or attitudes that are 'quintessentially queer' or 'transparently queer'? Watney's discussion of childhood and shame, as well as what he calls precocious genius and precocious queerness, runs the risk of privileging the biographical in a specific explanatory way (as does almost every Warhol documentary and biography). Though it goes against chronological order, I would like to argue that Watney is far more careful and critical regarding the issue of biography in his earlier piece entitled 'The Warhol Effect'.18 Watney discusses the 'afterlife' of Andy Warhol in the form of an auction of his</page><page sequence="5">Unseen Warhol /Seeing Barthes 25 seemingly indiscriminate collections. He indicates that 'Biographies have already been announced, to satisfy that curiosity which seeks to "know" the artist, in the mainstream tradition of art critical and art historical humanism, and invariably finds the artist as the unique and irreducible source of his or her work' (120). This art historical humanism and curiosity is perhaps best exemplified by the book from which I have lifted my title: John O'Connor and Benjamin Liu's Unseen Warhol ,19 but almost every Warhol biography exploits the idea of a hidden or secret Warhol behind the public persona (for instance: Victor Bockris and Bob Colacello20). In contrast, Watney argues that 'Warhol constantly aspired to detach himself from a traditional authorial role, to dissolve himself into an inviolable persona' (117). He goes on to explain that there is no necessary connection between the star's persona and person (120). Watney argues that Warhol's portraits exemplify his 'disinterest in any appeals to psychological or biographical notions of "depth" or "insight"' but rather reveal the sitter's position within a larger system of public representations or personas (119). He claims that 'no artist has ever undermined notions of Self more thoroughly and insistently than Warhol' (120). In a Foucauldian gesture, Watney proposes that Warhol established a 'poetics of the provisional' which makes one's life into a work of art, and that this is more productive than measuring Warhol against 'the criteria of predetermined models of artistic value which his own work quiedy invalidates' (122). He argues that 'Warhol is now safely indistinguishable from what survives as the ongoing critical intelligence and sensibility of the Warhol effect' (122). Despite his dismissiveness and homophobia, I believe there is some merit in Robert Hughes's observation that Warhol is not a likable popular artist: 'Warhol's public character (. . .) has been the opposite: an abnormal figure (silent, withdrawn, eminently visible but opaque, and a bit malevolent).'21 The merit lies in this peculiar phrase 'eminently visible but opaque' in the sense that Warhol's opacity refuses the search for depth in the form of intentionality, authenticity, psychology, etc. This seems to me to have specific advantages over a desire to represent Warhol as being recognizably, transparently queer, insofar as such a desire seeks a clear form of identification. Rather than letting Watney 's phrasing 'Queer Andy' become simply substitu table for 'Gay Andy', we might want to follow a provisional poetics of 'queer' in which the word's meaning is not decided in advance. This is why I take Warhol as exemplifying a 'queer' strategy, taking queer not as an a priori but as a process itself, following Eve Sedgwick's</page><page sequence="6">26 Paragraph definition: 'That's one of the things that "queer" can refer to: the open mesh of possibilities, gaps, overlaps, dissonances, and resonances, lapses and excesses of meaning when the constituent elements of anyone's gender, of anyone's sexuality aren't made (or can't be made) to signify monolithically.'22 This experimental and open process is one which Sedgwick explicidy links to epistemology and representation, to meaning, but I would also like to allow for the possibility of non-meaning and non-knowledge as 'queer' strategies (as she alludes to when she speaks of gaps and lapses of meaning). This is what I am calling queer opacity. This refusal of the quintessentiality of queerness is how I propose that we might read such Warhol aphorisms as 'I never fall apart because I never fall together.'23 This model of subjectivity, with an emphasis on fragmentary or provisional identity, is also very dear to Roland Barthes, in particular in Roland Barthes by Roland Barthes where he asserts 'I am not contradictory, I am dispersed' (143). Echoing this notion of dispersed identity, Camera Lucida also features reflections on Barthes's 'own' image in the form of the photographic portrait: What I want, in short, is that my (mobile) image, buffeted among a thousand shifting photographs, altering with situation and age, should always coincide with my (profound) 'self; but it is the contrary that must be said: 'myself never coincides with my image; for it is the image which is heavy, motionless, stubborn (which is why society sustains it), and 'myself which is light, divided, dispersed (. . .) if only Photography could give me a neutral, anatomic body, a body which signifies nothing! Alas, I am doomed by (well-meaning) Photography always to have an expression: my body never finds its zero degree, no one can give it to me (perhaps only my mother? For it is not indifference which erases the weight of the image - the Photomat always turns you into a criminal type, wanted by the police - but love, extreme love). (12) Warhol on the other hand sought out this Photomatic indifference, as illustrated by his early experiments with Photomat portraits ( Ethel Scull Thirty-Six Times, 1963) and self-portraits ( Self-portrait , 1964), and in his use of criminal mugshots (The Thirteen Most Wanted Men, 1964-5). Warhol was deeply aware of how much society sustains the image, the stubborn image: the portrait. The identity photo is central to the functioning of society; your face is who you are. Barthes is right to argue that the Photomat always turns you into a criminal type, Warhol's mugshots simply confirm it. Barthes and Warhol each deal differendy with the problem of the portrait. A 'failed' publicity photo seems to have been chosen for</page><page sequence="7">Unseen Warhol /Seeing Barthes 27 the dustjacket of the U.S. English translation of Camera Lucida. In it, Barthes is looking down with an awkward indeterminable expression. Within the text, he explains the portrait situation in terms which aptly fit this photo: 'I decide to "let drift" over my lips and in my eyes a faint smile which I mean to be "indefinable", in which I might suggest, along with the qualities of my nature, my amused consciousness of the whole photographic ritual' (11). Warhol was deeply aware of the social rituals of photography: the society portrait, the artist's self-portrait, the screen test. Warhol's late camouflage self-portrait silkscreens highlight a strategic game of 'hide-and-seek' with the public. He seems to be both concealing and revealing himself. By comparison, it is well-known that Warhol was quite unkind in his desire to 'reveal' the secret masculinity of his transsexual and drag queen superstars (Jackie Curtis, Candy Darling, Mario Montez) but perhaps this was to draw attention to a social fascination with the revelation of queer secrets, what Eve Sedgwick has called 'knowingness'. Douglas Crimp has discussed Warhol's Screen Test #2 (1965), where Mario, in drag, is asked by Ronald Tavel to show his penis, and Crimp comes to a remarkable conclusion: So I'll return, in closing, to the shaming of Mario Montez in Screen Test #2. As I mentioned before, I wanted, in my earlier essay on Blow Job to contest the cliché of Warhol's filmic vision as voyeuristic. I argued there that formal features in Warhol's films - different formal features in different films, of course - worked to foreclose a knowingness about the people represented in them. Warhol found the means to make the people of his world visible to us without making them objects of our knowledge.24 This precarious mode of vision-without-knowingness is part of a queer ethical project, one that I believe Duane Michals's portrait of Warhol accomplishes in its foreclosure of the function of the face-as- identity in favor of the opaque visibility of Warhol's hands. Unlike the camouflage self-portraits, the game of hide-and-seek will be rejected by those who read the portrait.25 Duane Michals, the photographer, forms a common reference point within an intergenerational network of admirers in what might prob- lematically be called post-war gay writing in France: Michel Foucault, Roland Barthes, Renaud Camus, and Hervé Guibert. Apart from the 'delirium of praise' (to borrow from Eleanor Kaufman's work26) these writers have expressed for each other in various prefaces, inter- textual references, and published love letters - a brief list would include Barthes's untranslated 'Fragments pour H.' which Guibert</page><page sequence="8">28 Paragraph published without permission in his L'Autre Journal,27 Guibert's novelesque treatment of Barthes's Fragments d'un discours amoureux in his also untranslated Fou de Vincent,28 Barthes's preface for Renaud Camus's Tricks (which itself alludes to Barthes and photography), and Foucault and Barthes's expressed affection and solidarity at the Collège de France29 - each has either prefaced or discussed Michals's pho- tography. Each of them uses Michals in advancing his own theory of photography and its relation to death and reality. Taken together, they form a symposium on photography and queer desire which can help us evaluate the larger problem of the 'hidden/revealed' paradigm of sexual meaning. The conversation 'begins' with the publication in 1980 (shortly before his death) of Barthes's reflections on photography, La Chambre claire ( Camera Lucida ), followed in 1981 by Guibert's book on phantom photography L'Image fantôme ( Ghost Image, in which Guibert transfers into narrative photos which are unreproducible or failed or which haunt him),30 followed by Foucault's preface to a Paris exposition on Duane Michals in 1982, entitled 'La Pensée, l'émotion',31 followed by Renaud Camus's preface to a book on Duane Michals, which he entitles 'L'ombre d'un double' published in 1997.32 Each critic sees photography as essentially connected to death, but only Barthes and Camus see the photograph as a sort of 'proof of reality, proof that something actually once existed before a camera even though the photograph only speaks of its death. Guibert and Foucault use the notion of 'trick' photography - of which Duane Michals is a shining example - to argue that photographs need not represent reality, and in fact offer no clear proof of reality (Guibert especially deals with the fact of retouched photographs (Ghost, 153-5)) other than offering the viewer an 'experience' (and Foucault mentions the work of a certain 'H.G.' as doing the same thing for him ('La Pensée, l'émotion', iii)). The role that homosexuality plays in each is also quite varied. Barthes is his most lyrical when discussing the body of a 'boy with his arm outstretched' in a Mapplethorpe photograph: 'the photographer has caught the boy's hand (the boy is Mapplethorpe himself, I believe) at just the right degree of openness, the right density of abandonment: a few millimeters more or less and the divined body would no longer have been offered with benevolence (the pornographic body shows itself, it does not give itself, there is no generosity in it)' ( Camera , 59). Guibert is also frustrated with the pornographic image, its stereotype of desire (a very Barthesian objection; Ghost, 113-15). Ralph Sarkonak</page><page sequence="9">Unseen Warhol /Seeing Barthes 29 has revealed the ways in which Hervé Guibert's Ghost Image can be read as an attempt to outdo Barthes: For example, Guibert does not hide his homosexuality: (. . .) 'It's not that I want to dissimulate it, or that I want to boast about it arrogantly. But it's the least I can do in the way of sincerity. How can you speak about photography without speaking of desire? If I mask my desire, if I deprive it of its gender, if I leave it undefined, as others have done more or less cleverly, I would feel as if I were weakening my stories, making them flabby'. It would be hard to be more direct without naming Barthes outright. We remember the coquettish way he played with the topic of homosexuality in Roland Barthes by Roland Barthes as well as the kind of genderless love he describes in A Lover's Discourse where the third-person masculine pronoun used to refer to the beloved could be interpreted as a neutral 'one'-type pronoun in French.33 Ironically, Guibert goes on to uncannily echo Barthes: 'It's not even a matter of courage (I'm not a militant), it has to do with the truth of writing. I don't know how to put it more simply'.34 All of the vocabulary of the supposedly coquettish Roland Barthes by Roland Barthes is here: the refusal of courage, militancy, in favor of the truth of writing as it is praised in Barthes's preface to Camus's Tricks, in terms of 'putting it simply'. As Sarkonak demonstrates, the rivalry expressed by Guibert towards his older sometime-mentor is nonetheless voiced in Barthesian terms.35 I am uneasy with the Oedipal logic of Guibert's desire to outdo Barthes in terms of gay specificity, which finds its echo in D. A. Miller's own occasionally condescending tone in his Bringing Out Roland Barthes. It is important that these texts were written after Barthes's death. Thus what Miller calls the inflection of generation is not something which can be dissolved in the harmony of gay 'community'. (Let us recall Barthes's definition: 'inflection is the voice insofar as it is always past, silenced' ( Roland , 68).) Likewise, it is disappointing to see the way in which Guibert, Miller and Leo Bersani have recourse to the metaphor of 'flabbiness' to typify Barthes. Bersani praises Miller on the dustjacket of Bringing Out Roland Barthes : 'Like a good trainer in one of those gyms surely never frequented by the Proustian Barthes, Miller "develops" Barthes's gay muscle.' At one point, Miller claims that Barthes's late style and last writing is 'Like a body that necessity has compelled to abandon the gym (. . .) uncaring on the question of how it looks' (55). Pierre Saint- Amand is right to criticize this opposition between the 'Hard and Soft': 'In his presentation of Miller's text, Bersani allows himself to be seduced by the same athletic prejudice, forgetting, moreover, the critique he</page><page sequence="10">30 Paragraph himself had formulated concerning "psychic tumescence". He too falls into the trap of supervirilization.'36 Saint- Amand demonstrates how far removed this is from Barthes's own 'Gay Erotics', which he brings out in a reading of the earlier mentioned Mapplethorpe photograph. Camus's preface is remarkable for its biographical tone, in which he compares the similar Eastern European immigrant backgrounds (and name changes) of Duane Michals and Andy Warhol. Camus does a thematic reading of Duane Michals's photography in terms of doubling : mirrors, reflections, taste for binary oppositions (spirit/matter, appear- ance/reality, youth/ old age, artist/model, life/death), superimposi- tion, transparent presences, phantom silhouettes, double exposures, effacement, and dissimulated faces. He cites Michals's portrait Andy Warhol, 1958 as an example of this last theme (1-2). He claims that the occurrence of homosexuality in the work, namely in Michals's 'l'Hommage à Cavafy', is 'serene' and 'triumphally assumed' (3). Foucault is the most embarrassed about the indiscretion of writing on photography, of narrating it (iii). However, his recounting of a Duane Michals photo in 'l'Hommage à Cavafy' - of two nearly iden- tical men, one lighting the other's cigarette - is the most remarkable for the way in which it empties homosexuality of meaning. Foucault explains (and here I'm translating) that between these two men's bodily gestures it is difficult to imagine a greater proximity, a communication more affirmed, and more readable by the habitual 'décrypteurs' of desire. But he points out that the text written below the photograph (common to much of Duane Michals's work) reads: 'the sole fact of lighting his cigarette was a great pleasure'. Foucault claims that this text makes all the reciprocity and complementarity of the photo disappear, dislocated into a singular pleasure of which the other is necessarily ignorant (vi). This effectively short-circuits the 'decryption' of desire which Foucault has argued has so marked our understanding of sexu- ality, and homosexuality. Rather than being 'serene' or 'triumphally assumed', desire is replaced by the pleasure of one in the ignorance of the other, which Foucault suggests is perhaps similar to the thought of this photo which expresses a pleasure which we cannot know, of which we are 'lightly ignorant' (a clumsy translation of 'légère'). So, schematically: for Barthes photography signifies both death and proof of reality; for Guibert photography is haunted by death and doubt, i.e. falsifiable reality, but also speaks the truth of desire; for Camus photography is obsessed with death and doubling; and for Foucault photography is closer to thought or experience than to any necessity of objectivity, proof, or reality, and it in fact says less about</page><page sequence="11">Unseen Warhol /Seeing Barthes 31 homosexual desire than we think. In between these accounts, Duane Michals (himself a desired object for each critic) allows them each to grapple with the role of queer desire in photography. Guibert writes a chapter of Ghost Image entitled 'Diffraction' in which he and 'T.' reflect on a remarkably queer form of desire in admiring another's reflection in the glass of the windows of the métro (97-8). This desire is diffracted (we also find here the reflective and doubling theme brought out by Camus), deniable (it is easy to claim you weren't looking at anything but simply staring into space), and secret, which for Guibert makes it valuable. The gaze filtered through its reflection loses some of its brutality and gains in impunity, complicity, and perversity: 'We alone can intercept the gaze that we exchange indirecdy (. . .) the consent in our gaze is our secret alone, a mirage suspended in air that will soon disappear' (97). Regarding secrecy, Guibert concludes Ghost Image with a fictional dialogue that echoes the end of Roland Barthes by Roland Barthes (188): 'I feel completely empty now that I've told you this story. It's my secret. Do you understand?' 'And now?' 'I don't want to have to ask you not to repeat it.' 4 Yes, but now your secret has also become my secret. It's part of me, and I'll treat it as I do all my secrets - I'll get rid of it when the time comes. Then it will become someone else's secret.' 'You're right. Secrets have to circulate. . .' (Ghost, 193) While Guibert exploits the secret, in a quite Foucauldian way and vis-à-vis Foucault himself in his book To the Friend Who Did Not Save My Life,37 Foucault is remarkable for his rejection of this convoluted reading of desire in favor of a discussion of pleasure, especially in the case of photography. I would like to argue that the same is true for Barthes. For Barthes, the body in photography is 'given' rather than secredy stolen (and that is what makes the Mapplethorpe photo desirable). Despite Guibert's oblique attack on Barthes for masking his desire, Barthes explains in his preface to Camus's Tricks that he is much more interested in texts which 'speak homosexuality but never speak about it (. . .) Renaud Camus's narratives are neutral, they do not participate in the game of interpretation. They are surfaces without shadows, without ulterior motives ' ( Rustle , 292). In Barthes and in Warhol, there is nothing behind the mask, what is 'given to be read' is the surface, and we may in fact be confronted with an absence of meaning (though not</page><page sequence="12">32 Paragraph necessarily pleasure). In Duane Michals s portrait, Warhol offers his hands to be read, quite openly. Following Barthes, the studium of the photo could be read as Warhol's secrecy, his hiding, his masking of his face and perhaps his desire, but the punctum is not this gesture but the surface of Warhol's nails. This overwhelming quality of the detail Barthes calls the punctum also overwhelms the entirety of his reading: 'This brings the Photograph (certain photographs) close to the Haiku. For the notation of a haiku, too, is undevelopable: everything is given, without provoking the desire for or even the possibility of a rhetor- ical expansion' ( Camera , 49). Barthes also likens Camus's Tricks to a series of haikus: 'If it weren't for their extent and their subject, these Tricks might be haikus; for the haiku combines an asceticism of form (which cuts short the desire to interpret) and a hedonism so serene that all we can say about pleasure is that it is there (which is also the contrary of Interpretation)' ( Rustle , 292). This rejection of Interpre- tation is what marks Barthes's reading of the Duane Michals portrait of Warhol, and what frustrates most attempts to interpret Warhol. But as in Foucault's short-circuiting of the habitual decryption of desire in Michals's photography, we find here a short-circuiting of that most vexed and habitual notion that queer desire is something to be decrypted and unmasked, revealed from being concealed, to find ulterior motives and hidden truths. This important strategy of opacity is queer not because of the identity of its subjects, but because of the way it blurs the paradigm of sexual meaning (hidden/ revealed) and challenges the metaphor of the closet. Following Barthes's definition, instead of being an interpretation of the photograph, my own account is rather an intertextual reading. What is given to be read 'quite openly' in the photograph is not the face, that marker of true identity, but the hands, the surface: 'and there I am. There's nothing behind it.' Both Barthes and Warhol experiment with the surface, and with 'face value', but I would suggest that taking Warhol at face value may mean not privileging the value of his face.

It is almost as if desirable masculinity has itself displaced Warhol from the visual field, demanding that he remain off-frame, wanting but not wanted ' ('Warhol's Clones', Yale Journal of Criticism 7:1 (1994), 79-109; 105). This understanding of Warhol's psychology (closely linked to the earlier question of shame) has also been applied biographically to Barthes's 'self-image'. But I differ in my reading of the framing and the visual field of Michals's portrait, since the both luminous and tactile quality of the image need not foreclose desire for - or pleasure in - this image. The image is clearly worthy of the camera's attention, and ours (Silver George impersonating Warhol: 'I have very nice hands (. . .) very expressive (...)! keep them in repose or touching each other' (Andy Warhol and Pat Hackett, POPism: The Warhol ' 60s (New York, Harcourt, 1980), 199)). Duane Michals's photography is simply too aestheticizing to be read as an allegory of ugliness, even if Barthes reads its substance as 'slightly repellent (. . .) at once soft and hard-edged' ( Camera , 45). 26 Eleanor Kaufman, The Delirium of Praise : Bataille, Blanchot , Deleuze , Foucault , Klossowski (Baltimore, Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001). 27 Barthes, 'Fragments pour H.', Œuvres complètes Tome V: 1977-1980 (Pans, Seuil, 1995), 1005-06.

This grief over the loss of his mother of course</page><page sequence="15">Unseen Warhol /Seeing Barthes 35 becomes the subject of the second part of Barthes's Camera Lucida. Guiberťs fascination with photography's proximity to death also explains his interest in Duane Michals's photography. Guibert in fact collaborated with him on the publication in 1981 ofMichals's Changements , a project of photographs and texts about aging and death, including a series in which Duane Michals stages his own death. The text for the book was created by Hervé Guibert after an interview in Paris in November of 1978, and several letters. But Michals's photograph 'The Captive Chilď is also cited as one of Guiberťs personal favorites in Ghost Image , in a list of photos with a common thread of death and the love of boys (137). 36 Pierre Saint-Amand, 'The Secretive Body: Roland Barthes's Gay Erotics' in Yale French Studies #90: Same Sex , Different Text (New Haven, Yale University Press, 1996), 153-71; 167. 37 Guibert, To the Friend Who Did Not Save My Life , translated by Linda Coverdale (New York, High Risk, 1991).</page></plain_text>
