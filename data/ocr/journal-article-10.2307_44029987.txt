<plain_text><page sequence="1">Within this analysis of Kate Braid's poetic discourse as a response to Emily Carr s paintings in the text To This Cedar Fountain, this essay demonstrates how painter and poet subvert the matter/spirit binary to articulate a fundamental connection among spirituality, creativity , and the material conditions of women's lives. Image, Text, and Spirit: Kate Braid and the Paintings of Emily Carr CY-THEA SAND ... the soul of painting [is] poetry . . . Samuel Richardson, Clarissa 1.Jike that of Georgia O'Keeffe and Frida Kahlo, Emily Carr's personal mythology was deeply rooted in the spiritual (Udall 235). Carr's biographers, art historians, and scholars, such as Paula Blanchard, Doris Shadbolt, Sharon Rohlfsen Udall, and Stephanie Kirkwood Walker, agree that Carr's friendship with Lawren Harris, who was a practising theosophist as well as an artist, signalled a major transformation in her artistic practice. Harris believed that artistic work was a sacramental act, one that made the spirit in the universe visible (Blanchard 178). Carr's friendship with Harris was characterized by dis- cussions about the sacred in art; indeed it was Harris who encouraged Carr to immerse herself in the natural world of British Columbia, believing as he did that "the whole visible universe was the living body of an inexpressibly beautiful and benevolent spiritual force" (172). In 1930, Carr was deeply moved when she saw the paintings of Wassily Kandinsky (1866-1944), the abstract art pioneer who had published a text in 1928 that was widely read in avant-garde circles (218-19). Concerning the Spiritual Mosaic 35/2 0027- 1 276-00/ 1 45022$02.00©Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">146 Mosaic 35/2 (June 2002) in Art argues that abstract art should be understood as "an attempt to discover a reality behind surface appearance" (or matter) and that the arts are leading the way to a spiritual revolution in the twentieth cen- tury (Macleod 205). Linking notions of the self to "wonders in a hidden realm" was the aim of many modernists who turned away from the con- straints of Christian thought to embrace primitivism, the unconscious and the occult (Walker 113). The avant-garde placed spirit at the heart of creativity, a positioning that is central to understanding Carr's writing and painting. The purpose of her practice was to "rise above the external and temporary to the real of the eternal reality, to express the 'I am,' or God, in all life, in all growth, for there is nothing but God" (Carr 32). In To This Cedar Fountain, published in 1995, Kate Braid, a Vancou- ver poet, feminist, academic, and carpenter, engages unflinchingly with the spiritual dimension in Carr's paintings. Her collection of thirty-six poems responds to Carr's modernist achievement with earthy, concrete images that offer readers a visceral, experiential connection to Carr's spiritually rich œuvre. Braid joins a long (predominantly male) tradi- tion of poets whose encounters with paintings inspire and inform their work. The tradition, begun in modern times with Baudelaire, includes the contemporary Irish poet Paul Durcan, whose presence in the gallery, like Braid's, animates the paintings they love and admire. Braid moves her readers around art galleries and the vast forests of British Columbia where an intangible power awaits, such as a "patch on heaven" ("Totem By The Ghost Rock," Cedar 1 1) or "a hallelujah chorus of greens" ("Rush- ing Undergrowth" 51). In her poems, Braid subverts the dualistic cat- egories of matter and spirit to embrace Simone de Beauvoir's definition of women's metaphysical wisdom as a double allegiance to both the car- nal and poetic, and a combination of the immanent and transcendent (Thomas). Braid's poetic approach complements existing Carr scholar- ship that analyzes the artist's desire to paint a God that she experienced as "a great breathing among the trees" (Blanchard 105), an image that invokes the origin of spirit in the Latin word spiritus 'breath' (Ayto 494). Braid responds to Carr's instinctive animism with a poet's (in)sight into what Doris Shadbolt calls Carr's "primal spirit affinity with all the forms of creation" (142). Braid engages with Carr's "ability to arrange the chaos of nature, [and] reveal its dimensions and contingent sacrality" (Walker 137). In addition, although Braid's familiarity with Carr's prose predates most of her poems, excerpts from Carr's Hundreds and Thousands: The Journals of an Artist accompany Braid's poems and the reproductions of several of Carr's paintings. This inclusion draws our attention to a text</page><page sequence="3">Cy-TheaSand 147 that is indispensable for understanding how Carr's creative and spiritual struggles were inextricably linked. Thus, To This Cedar Fountain con- stitutes a double conversation between image and text - between Braid's poems and Carr's paintings and between Carr's text and images. Braid effectively dramatizes notions about spirit, the natural world and the material realities of everyday life, such as Carrs poverty and isolation in the first half of the twentieth century, and her own struggles in the male- dominated field of carpentry in the second half. In this essay, I argue that Braid's poetic encounter with Carr's images highlights how verbal and visual discourse can work together to conflate the binary opposites of matter and spirit. I argue from a materialist- feminist perspective that is informed by a respect for and (relatively recent) interest in the experience of transcendence. Before I began reading Braid's poems, I wondered what she would make of Carr's metaphysical beliefs that her paintings embody. Braid does not wrestle with the source of Carr's power as an artist; with her own images, Braid testifies to its potency and lets Carr's vision nourish her own. Braid's postmodern-era response to Carr's modernist moment illustrates "the stubborn endurance of the spiritual imagination" (McClure 160). In this essay, then, I describe five Carr paintings to demonstrate how Braid's corresponding poems link the poet, the painter, and the spectator/reader while negotiating between the material and spiritual realms of existence, what Carr refers to as "nature clothed in God's beauty of holiness" (42). I begin with a short dis- cussion of Braid's work because she is not as well known as Carr. I include definitions of spirit and matter that are most relevant to my assertion that To This Cedar Fountain is a richly imagined contribution to the ongoing, dynamic conversation between image and text. The relationship between the poet and the painter in To This Cedar Fountain also suggests a rich, feminist connection between creativity and spirituality. For several years, Kate Braid was the director of the Labour Studies Pro- gram at Simon Fraser University. She also taught creative writing at the University of British Columbia. Braid was born in Calgary, Alberta, and has worked in many occupations, from childcare to carpentry. Braid's carpentry poems, Covering Rough Groundy won the Pat Lowther Memo- rial Award in 1991 for the best book of poetry written by a woman in Canada. In her review of the book, Cathy Stonehouse describes Braid as "a woman entering a world of men, [who] breaks down traditional boundaries between body and tool, craft and art, the mundane and the spiritual [in a site where] work becomes sacred, sensuous, the wood</page><page sequence="4">148 Mosaic 35/2 (June 2002) itself forgiving." To This Cedar Fountain extends the metaphor; Braid addresses Carr as a foremother and co-con spiritor, "another woman who knows wood" ("Wood Interior," Cedar 37). Significantly, in another book of Braid's poems, Inward to the Bones, which was published in 1998, she imagines a friendship between Georgia O'Keeffe and Emily Carr; the two met only once (briefly) in 1930 in New York. O'Keeffe thinks through Braid that Carr "has none of my privilege, nor wealth / nor Stieglitz, who fosters my fame, / who made my painting possible - / and yet / 1 am brittle and thin, starving / for what feeds her" (81). Braid speculates that O'Keeffe was hungry for Carr's faith in God; Inward to the Bones explores creativity, spirituality and a Actional friendship between two great abstract painters of the twentieth century, which Braid configures as a gossamer thread: "She calls me Albatrosse. I call her Mouse. / We run a close race / tying together heaven and earth" (42). In Inward to the Bones , O'Keeffe decides, as she compares her own paintings to Carr's, "I am bolder, hold no inhibitions, / but she makes a frank statement / without timidity or evasion, speaks directly" (77). These lines aptly describe Braid's own voice in To This Cedar Fountain. Braid's language is frugal, simple, and straightforward. In the words of George Elliott Clarke, Braid "goes toe-to-toe with Carr, so to speak, and remains standing" (7). Anne Fleming notes that in To This Cedar Foun- tain, "Braid speaks to Emily as an equal, a peer and [their] relationship rings true - [both women] did what she wanted despite opposition or lack of recognition. Another woman who worked under the open sky" (36). Braid does not illustrate Carr's visual zeal with her own verbal accoutrements, however. Nor does Braid try to explain Carr's achieve- ment - indeed, Anne F. Nothof cautions against such an attempt (96). Instead, Braid evokes the sacral beauty in the painter's vision and embod- ies in her poems Carr's belief in a primordial essence at the heart of mat- ter. For example, Braid writes: This cedar is home to itself. The woods around it waver in and out of colour reflect in its light, worship it. She would not say Mystery. She would say God. ("Lone Cedar," Cedar 39, emph. Braid's)</page><page sequence="5">Cy-TheaSand 149 Braid reinscribes Carr's understanding that the material without the spiritual is hollow, as vacuous as a decaying log, "like some cedars I meet / all outward bark / no heart ("Hollow Log: Emily," Cedar 13). In response to another painting, Braid exclaims: This is Emily's heart, Emily's soul carved to look like forest. This is life at delirium levels. It is all or nothing with Emily, nothing pallid or faint. Be you lost in Forest as she was or don't go there at all. ("i. Forest, British Columbia," Cedar 7 5) Positioned between early expressionists like the Fauves and later abstract expressionists, Carr s art dramatizes her need to connect with both natural forces and the larger universe. What distinguishes the power in Carr's art is her belief in the immanence of spirit, what Clive Bell called significant form, essential reality, the universal in the particu- lar, and '"God in everything"' (qtd. in Walker 113). Carr strove to paint the spirit of British Columbia's rain forest "until the God quality in [her] is in tune with the God in it"(Carr 29). Carr's god was personal and pan- theistic - divinity in the world for her included and went beyond Christ (Blanchard 228). It is this concept of spirit with which Braid engages in her text, telling us: These trees live without me. After they are gone, house will take their place but spirits will linger here. Ghosts will wander up the stairwell of some child's dreams. ("Untitled," Cedar 33) Carr's ultimate purpose was to successfully paint the soul of British Columbia that she felt she had discovered in native art. In "Untitled," Braid beautifully weaves Carr's totemie vision into tangible emblems representing past, present, and future. Time is made wood, as it were - brought down to earth in trees, houses, and stairwells. The child (or artist/writer) gets to climb, live in, and transcend it. Significantly, Braid intuits and respects the spiritual raison ďétre in Carr's vision while transmuting the material circumstance of Carr's life</page><page sequence="6">150 Mosaic 35/2 (June 2002) into poetic discourse. Acknowledging the consequences of Carr's gender, poverty, and critical neglect grounds Braid's understanding in everyday matters. She writes: "You know what they say / to us women. Never / raise your eyes." ("Top of Small Trees, Lower Branches of Large One," Cedar 23); "This is a picture by a woman / who was poor but would paint, / who fashioned her own pincushions / out of cloth and clay." ("Totem By The Ghost Rock," Cedar 11); "there was no money for canvas / so I painted on paper." ("Afterword: Self- Portrait," Cedar 91); "No one wants to see / my pictures. / When they do / they hate them, me." ("Hollow Log: Emily," Cedar 13); and "It was hard to believe in myself / and the critics didn't help me, either" ("Afterword: Self- Portrait," Cedar 91). In this way, Braid resists what Anthony de Mello calls a popular tendency to think of tran- scendence as an escape from the realities of self and the world. Braid uses the medium of poetry to suggest that Carr's understanding of transcen- dence was a "breathing of Spirit of love into the heart of our existence" (Burgess 44). Braid links human matter (s) to the lightness of spirit and to herself as a worker, a carpenter and poet who, like the artist she admires, conjoins the rational and the intuitive: But even this early your spirit stares and sees what is between the trees joining them. A space any carpenter would understand. It is the reason we build things. Looks like air to some, fresh breeze, a touch of chill or fog. It is the spirit of the tree. ("Wood Interior," Cedar 37) Braid connects humanity to material and spiritual nature as well; whether we are readers, spectators, artists, or poets, at times we all long to feel part of a larger reality: I can't shake off those trees this grass the lush growing swamp that tickles my throat this sunlight that sneaks behind my eyes. ("Spring," Cedar 15)</page><page sequence="7">Cy-TheaSand 151 Carr's image increases the poet's bodily sensations and, by extension, the reader's as well. Nature becomes both an aspect of life and larger than life. Braid's text and Carr's image embrace the immanence of spirit in a dynamic, mystical communion with nature that provided Carr with a "comprehen- sive metaphor for life" (Shadbolt 140) and Braid with the desire to "meet" the artist by articulating the poetry that she found in her paintings. The power of spiritual vision to overcome disappointment, loneliness, and poverty infuses both the paintings and the poems, and human strug- gles as matter are acknowledged. Carr wonders if we must "rise above the material" and concludes that "no - I think you've got to climb through these things to the other" (22). Braid agrees that "the half dark path [. . .] leads to such life" ("Deep Woods," Cedar 43). Like the trees that Carr inscribes with wondrous vigour, women who resist despair "work [. . .] hard to get up here / one ring at a time. The prize is sky / and the freedom of birds" ("Untitled," Cedar 41). Like Carr, Braid demonstrates what Susan McCaslin calls the poet's ability to deal in paradox and "to hold polarities in active balance" (16). Braid and Carr are anchored in material reality even as they reach beyond its grip, suggesting a female subjectivity grounded in strength, agency, and faith. Such agency is manifested in Carr's major self- representation, painted between 1938 and 1939 when she was at the height of her powers as an artist. Carr's Self- Portrait performs visual rhetoric in its account of a potent, female self. Braid's poem, "Afterword: Self- Portrait," is an apostrophe in which the poet addresses the dead painter who is "present" to both the poet and the reader/viewer. Braid conflates Carr's painting with aspects of her own material experience as a woman working in a non- traditional job. In italics under the poem's title, Braid situates her poem within a specific time frame: "After a demonstration for Women in Trades on Par- liament Hill, Ottawa ." We can imagine the poet entering the National Gallery to relax and are astonished with her when Carr comes to life like (a postmodern) Galatea. In the first stanza, Braid sets the scene: It is a quiet day in the National Gallery. Nothing noisy ever happens here so when the brown painted figure in the portrait stirs, she does so discreetly. I am the only one in the room at the time busy staring at her eyes. ( Cedar 91) The portrait's authority is established by the subject's face, which is full- on and direct, facing the viewer. Her eyes dominate, framed by glasses</page><page sequence="8">Emily Carr. Self- Portrait , 1938-39, oil on wove paper, mounted on plywood, 85.5 x 57.7 cm. National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa.

The painter and sitter are one; a triad is formed when the spectator is held in place by the subject's gaze. The spec- tator is drawn in and addressed directly by the subject's intensity, which is reflected in Braid's response. Braid's "self-portrait" consists of ten stanzas in free verse in lines of irregular length, and the dialogue between the poet and painter is italicized. Braid's language is factual rather than emotive or descriptive. The first two lines establish the poem's matter-of-fact tone that matches the pragmatic ambience that Carr's portrait demonstrates. Like Carr's direct gaze, Braid's use of time and place is immediate and engrossing. Carr's image and Braid's text are down-to-earth in both form and matter: Carr speaks of poverty and critics, Braid of hammers and paint. The trajectory of modern women's economic history is noted: Carr worried about money for food and art supplies, and several decades later, Braid fights for women's access to non-traditional, high-paying jobs. Carr's rapid brushstrokes conflate her persona as artist with the pic- torial background, a representation that can be read semiotically - the artist's subjectivity is indivisible from her work - as well as spiritually. Carr's body is as dense as a tree trunk. The colour and mood here is very similar to Forest (painted in 1937). It appears that Carr gathered together the young, thin tree trunks of Forest to create a single, broad one that is so firmly rooted that it appears to be her own body. The circular lines of paint on the artist's arm appear like a branch, an extension of the mass of energy from which the artist gains her powerful presence on the canvas. Her notion of self inscribed here is indivisible from the natural world and her goal as a painter is to face its power calmly, "claiming relationship, stand- ing honestly before the trees, recognizing one Creator of you and them, one life pulsing through all, one mystery engulfing all" (208). In the last stanza of her poem, Braid connects Carr directly to the trees she loved: Another gallery patron enters finds me whispering to a plain brown frame lifted with white. The air rustles as if with leaves. There is a smell in the air of pines. (92) Braid's poem defies the logic of materiality: the artist speaks to the wordsmith from the wall of an art gallery. Not only does Braid's device of giving Carr's self-portrait a voice work to connect the reader/viewer with both painter and poet, but, as well, the trope creates a matrix or border space wherein two subjectivities can co -exist symbolically without dominating each other (de Zegher 22). Carr's gaze is imposing.</page><page sequence="10">154 Mosaic 35/2 (June 2002) As viewers, we are curious about what Carr would say to the protesters outside the gallery. Braid does our work for us; she imagines Carr as an empathetic teacher and pioneer who reminds the poet to be resilient and resourceful, even when tossed about by self-doubt and the constraints of circumstance. Braid whispers back to "a plain brown frame lifted with white," which conjoins the material with the spiritual. Her text limns the actual frame of the painting, which is fixed in time and place by a white art gallery wall. Most significantly, however, the image refers back to the "brown painted figure" in the opening stanza, which links the embodi- ment of the artist (Carr's self-portrait) with the power of artistry, sig- nalled by the white on Carr's face. This, in turn, connects us to the artist's spiritual mission to paint the "cold, mysterious wonder amid the trees [with their] God-filled spaces totally untrod" (Carr 3). The poem ends with the trees' scent encircling painter, poet, reader, and spectator like gossamer's thread that has the mythic power to draw us back to Eden. In her introduction to To This Cedar Fountain, Braid confesses that she did not fully appreciate Carr's vision until after she had lived for two years in a cabin in a British Columbia forest. Only then could she under- stand that Carr had "caught the spirit of a tree" (6). While sketching cedar trees, Carr wrote that her job was to "to keep them up, up, up, to keep the praise in them bursting, rising, passing through the material and going beyond and carrying you with it." This text from Hundreds and Thou- sands appears above a reproduction of her painting Cedar, which, along with Braid's poem by the same name, sculpts a revelry, a hand- clapping testament to the spirit in the woods that both artist and poet venerate. In Cedar, great sweeping waves of green begin at the bottom of Carr's impres- sionistic painting of a West Coast rain forest cedar tree. Verdant waves of green drape over a red-brown trunk and over long, thin branches like sea foam drowning sand indentations. The leaves are dense; they are so heavy with green that they appear to form a carpet or sea on the forest floor. In contrast, thin brush strokes along the tree trunk suggest skeletal bones; long, thin, reddish-brown branches are turned up at their ends to connote curled-up, viscid, arthritic fingers. Matter here is dense and dank, but not burdensome. There is too much energy in the green for the painting to get bogged down by its own materiality. The hint of light offers relief from the centrifugal force of the painting. Its kinetic centre, ironically, is the tree trunk that is surrounded by curvaceous leaves. Braid's free-verse poem shares the painting's title. In it, Braid dis- patches language with alacrity: hurry words such as "bursting" and "busy," as well as alliteration like "bully boy brash," jitterbug with the</page><page sequence="11">Emily Carr.

The painting leads, the poem follows, a two- step verbal/visual interface with no time to waste. In Braid's poem, words slither down the clean, white page like hyperactive children throwing themselves down water slides. The poem must be read quickly to keep up with its sense of urgency, as if the reader/viewer herself will be bowled over if she gets in the way. With short, staccato metre suggesting swift- ness and hair-raising motion, the poem delivers a riposte to the elements of time and movement in the painting: This tree is too busy rushing upward to put on any bulk. It's down-to-the-core-and-bursting, boys with a ¡eťs-get-on-with-it-quick kind of energy. ("Cedar," Cedar 27 , emph. Braid's) The poet is awed by how the painting so powerfully configures move- ment onto a still, flat surface, so Braid personifies the cedar's life force as a diva who can harness energy at will: "It's growing so fast it has / set up a wind in the forest" (27). We watch the spirited tree hurl itself around Carr's painting and Braid's poem like a whirling dervish. The tree has its thin trunk; the poem its short, bouncy words. No time for fat or extra layers. Matter cannot consolidate into bulk with the spirit in the woods "bursting out all over," and in the end, matter and spirit merge in the poem's last two lines into "green motion, green heat" (27). The next painting/poem dyad slows the pace. A Young Tree unfolds a red, green, beige, and dark world. At the bottom of the frame, a fallen tree trunk sprouts its roots upward as if to defy death. The green, layered impression of a cedar tree dominates our view and draws us into the light at its peak. The leaves look like a cloak wrapped around a human figure that has transmogrified into another species. The earth beneath her feet is shaded sandstone orange, which contrasts with the gray trees in the background; they appear to be standing on guard to protect the light. It is spring in the canvas, and the light seems to have survived the dark of winter, suggested by the background trees that are as still and shadowy as a West Coast winter night. The canvas is Tintoretto -like; light and movement abound, and inner life manifests in outer form, to borrow Marianna Torgovnick's phrase for what drew Henry James to Tintoretto's canvases (38). What would light up the woods at such a time, except a power much greater than the nocturnal darkness that shades in the can- vas on all sides? Like other religious artists who sought transcendence, Carr conveys infinite space and spirit in this painting. The solidity of the</page><page sequence="13">Emily Carr.

In her unrhymed, twenty-seven-line poem with the same title, Braid uses images that mimic Carr's emphasis on light and shadow: "like a lamp / glowing / as it grows late," "a beacon in a dark place," "silhouetted by the light" ("A Young Tree," Cedar 47). Like the painting, the poem's tone is reverential, suggesting caution as the poet approaches the pos- sibility that the light at the centre of things survives despite the shadows enclosing the canvas like a shroud. The second person "you" is employed, a technique that distances the poet, perhaps from her own fear: This tree is luminous, bursts with the secrets of light This tree is merciful, uncovers itself slowly, lest you be startled or afraid. (47) The adjective "merciful" suggests that shining a light on and through the material is not a usual gesture for the poet. Carr's art encourages her to explore this possibility, though, and the process seems to work for the poet because her thirst is quenched; she chooses a Biblical reference to indicate how blessed she feels with the "fruit in its season" (Psalms 1.3): "The folds of its branches lie heavy / with promise, a nectar you can drink / like dew" (47). Braid's mood is subjunctive. The poet is willing to enter the garden and contemplate nature's light; the painter reassures her that the material and spiritual are one. Carr seems to have expanded Braid's vision, convincing her that it is good to walk into the centre of nature and dare to touch its vitality. One critic suggests that A Young Tree is more material and less metaphysical than Grey, a painting that Carr produced between 1931 and 1932 (Shadbolt 77-78). And yet, traces of what Shad- bolt refers to as the tree's "silent watching rather than released energy" remains. They hint at the sacral beauty that Braid suggests in her portrait of the tree in an act of prayer: In the shadow of the crown, a head bends forward slightly, silhouetted by the light. She is praying, perhaps a word to herself alone. (47)</page><page sequence="15">Cy-TheaSand 159 Here, Braid aligns the young tree with an image that connotes a writer or a mother in a solitary act of creation. Creativity, the natural world, matter, and spirit are all enveloped by Braid's anthropomorphic sugges- tion. Above the painting in To This Cedar Fountainy Braid has chosen to include an excerpt from Hundreds and Thousands , which leaves no doubt about what Carr, her spiritual mentor, perceived as the ultimate value or meaning in her creative practice. It contains a prescription that Braid honours in her poetic dialogue with the artist: "We are still among material things. The material is holding the spiritual, wrapping it up till such time as we can bear its unfolding. Then we shall find what was closed up in material is the same as is closed up in our flesh, imperishable - life, God. Meantime bless the material; reverence the container as you rever- ence a church" (46). In Moments of Being , Virginia Woolf describes art as an entity "where [in] one thing follows another and all are swept into a whole" (75), an observation that aptly describes the next painting. Forest, Brit- ish Columbia is an abstract work of swirling, joyous colour. A red cedar trunk grows down into the right bottom edge of the canvas. Behind it are several ochre -shaded tree trunks in a diagonal line. They shift one's point of view toward a sliver of blue - a hint of sea, perhaps - at the back of the canvas. Leaves are presented as waves of green, brown, and blue that dance around the canvas with thunderous energy, as if they are playing tag with the wind. Two leaves/waves appear to be draped over the oxide - shaded tree trunk, while the one underneath swims across the canvas, dividing it into top and bottom, in and out, matter and spirit. The centre of the canvas is lit up from outside by what could be an early morning sun that is not yet strong enough to penetrate the forest's solidity, its mass, its persistence. It is the focal point of the painting and secures its centrifugal force. This thin strip of light softens the heavy, thick, audacious lines that Carr inscribes. The light is barely discernible, which reminds me of what Carr describes in her journals as "the something that has burst through its mortal wrappings and is pouring back to its source - God - in praise, a concentrated essence, very strong and very subtle in its strength" (Carr 116). Shadbolt claims that the role of Carr's symbolic use of light in this work is one of "dispelling dark and creating life"; in it the awe-inspiring, somewhat terrifying presence that Carr found in totems is made mani- fest (Shadbolt 76). In her two-part poem about this painting, "i. Forest, British Colum- bia" and "ii. Forest, British Columbia," Braid, calmed by the painter's dexterity in making blatant what is subtle in nature, surrenders. "Take</page><page sequence="16">Emily Carr.

I walk right into it Alice through a West Coast looking glass alone in Emily's forest and the only way out, a rough road leading perhaps to treasure, green and powerful. ( Cedar 75) Braid is mesmerized with the painting's texture and scale. Her skin, legs, and arms are all drawn into the painting. At one point, Braid steps back from it to the more manageable ambience of the art gallery with its "cold squares* and "dumb glass* (75). But she is quickly drawn back into Forest, British Columbia and learns to fly around its three-dimensional world. She dwells in it perhaps to sharpen her own visionary acumen, which D.H. Lawrence suggests can happen when we really get to know paintings (Torgovnick 60). Braid bonds the viewer to herself and the viewer to Carr with a poem that unites spirit and matter by acknowledg- ing the mystery that Carr evokes with her art. In the second part of the poem, Braid reassures us: Don't worry if you don't know the words. It all goes on over our heads anyway. Even she, insider that she is, will not reveal what happens here. Perhaps we could not stand it. We are not ready. (77) The poet reminds us that language is limited when we try to grapple with what the painter is revealing about the life force in nature, what James Joyce called "its soul, its whatness* (Abrams 57). Braid's syntax and vocabulary are ordinary, like everyday speech, and they neutralize the impact of Carr's images. Braid grounds the poem in a common language "like roots into this dark earth," perhaps to help us glimpse a world that could otherwise overwhelm us with its intensity. Sacramental language would be redundant. Besides, Carr believed that "God's wonderful infi- nite face is beyond all human picturing or even imagining" (111).

Carrs raven presides over the natural world like a deity. In native mythology, the raven represents "the spirit that just wants everything to move and shift and change" (Kelly 87). Here, Carr frames it within a cubist composition of opposites: curves and squares, black and white, vertical and horizontal, spirit engulfed by the solidity of matter. Her ver- dant hills are curvaceous and smooth one moment, then swirl around the next into undulating lines that fall in front of dark, vertical trees. Behind them, solid, rectangular panels of skylight form a wall of contrast to the darkness in the rest of the painting. Considered by Shadbolt to be an example of Carrs formal period of highly conceptualized work, Big Raven interweaves planes and tonal contrasts (70) and highlights "the native's sense of the tangibility and permanence of spirit" (Blanchard 133). Carr liked the way native carvers "worked outward to the surfaces [with] his spiritual conception buried deep in the wood he was about to carve" (Shadbolt 30). In "Big Raven," Braid calls the bird "fruit of the forest/frozen into another form": Before, men tried to capture light honed it, held it down to this condensed darkness that turns around now and tries to fly. ( Cedar 79) In a speech that Carr gave in 1935 about what distinguishes a great work of art, she argued that the secret lies in the spiritual connection between the artist and [her] subject that modern art was bringing back after the mawkishness and commercialism of the nineteenth century (Blanchard 251). Braid echoes this sentiment in her poem; Braid's poem is made up of nouns like "crystal," "totem," and "spirit," which all suggest mysticism or a longing for transcendence. Verbs such as "transforms" and "echoes" are threaded through her first stanza, which help to cre- ate the poem's slow tempo. A meditative mood is established with an economy of language and images. The poet's invocation of the cedar bird resonates with creative plurality: a native carver used wood for his image of God or Great Spirit, then Carr imagined its life, which Braid inscribes in poetic discourse. Braid's last stanza is hermeneutic: the poet inter- prets the painting as a doxology, a hymn to nature sung with "haunt- ing broodiness, quiet and powerful" (Carr 27). In the last stanza, Braid</page><page sequence="20">164 Mosaic 35/2 (June 2002) invokes our shared attempts to sculpt meaning out of temporality. Our common materiality is honoured; Braid connects carver to artist, artist to poet, poet to readers and viewers in a revelatory cycle of community and meaning - the highest value, perhaps, that art and literature share: We all want this some days, to see through light and with the help of trees, experience our own clumsy dark flight. (Cedar 79) Carr's spiritual quest was both unique and representative, revealing ua deep longing for meaning that modernism addressed through art" (Walker 3). Carr eventually rejected theosophy's abstraction for what she called her less complicated beliefs (42). She didn't like its attitude toward the Bible for one thing, believing that "it is awful to have your holy of holiest dusted with a floor rag and a stable broom" (87). Carr remained a Romantic and a Christian whose direct experience of God in the natural world was the raison d'être of her creative expression. Carr would like Braid's response to her work. In To This Cedar Fountain, Braid interweaves the spiritual and material dimensions in Carr's work into haiku-like treasures: If you look, you see A canvas patch. She sets her own patch on heaven. It shines like a shadow on the sun. ("Totem by The Ghost Rock," Cedar 11) What has caught Braid's attention in Carr's visual discourse is what the artist describes as "different paths lead[ing] to the great 'it,' the thing to try to get at by hook and by crook" (22). Braid's poetic response to Carr's paintings, with its symbolic vitality and genuine courtesy, locate mat- ter and spirit in the art of creation and in a landscape from which both painter and poet negotiate meaning: "Whenever she gives us sky / It is a blue gift of grace / making all the rest possible" ("Pines in May," Cedar 29). Thus, Braid's dialogue with Carr enhances Walker's theoretical/ historical perspective while aligning itself with Carr's visual genius: "If it's her God, it's got to be good" ("Fir Tree and Sky," Cedar 85). Carr's creativity was inseparable from her search for identity and her construction of a personal mythology (Udall viii). At its heart, her artistic impulse included faith in a transcendent being. I am aware</page><page sequence="21">Cy-TheaSand 165 that postmodernism dismisses transcendence as a cultural and social construct, an attitude that informs much cultural criticism. However, for several scholars, postmodernism and spirituality are not mutually exclusive (see: McClure; McCaslin; Griffin). What maybe productive to explore further is Braid and Carr's dialectic in terms of a feminist, post- modern discussion of spirituality, especially as it relates to artists and writers who actively seek meaning and purpose through their own words and images.
