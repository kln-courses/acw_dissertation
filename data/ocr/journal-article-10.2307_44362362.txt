The reason we have translated and republished this article in our spe- cial issue on Kiyozawa Manshi is that it aptly illustrates the personality and thought of Kiyozawa Manshi, a man little known among foreign scholars in contrast to the highly renowned Suzuki Daisetz. Hashimoto Mineo ( 1 924- 1 984) studied Western philosophy at Kyoto Uni- versity, taught the same at Kobe University and also became the head priest of Hõnen-in ižČšĚt, a famous Buddhist temple in Kyoto. Hashimoto's path from a philosopher to a Buddhist was the same as Kiyozawa' s and the shift from a layman to a priest was also common to both. Hashimoto was very proud of their common background and admired Kiyozawa Manshi as his forerunner. Since Hashimoto's original Introduction is long, we have omitted some parts of it for this publication. Moreover, so that it can be read more easily, we have added chapters and sections in order to reorganize the original text. 6</page><page sequence="2">HASHIMOTO: KIYOZAWA MANSHI &amp; D. T.

Two Unsurpassable Giants Kiyozawa Manshi and Suzuki Daisetz are two lofty peaks, rising high in the century-old history of the modernization of Japanese Buddhism. While this is a term with a variety of meanings, here it means to reform, strengthen and promote traditional or conventional Buddhism, by responding to and resist- ing the introduction of Western thought and civilization after the Meiji peri- od. For that purpose, Buddhism first had to be equipped with logic and turned into an academic discipline, i.e., reconstructed into a coherent philosophical system. To put it simply, Buddhism had to be accepted by modern intellec- tuals first in order to have the possibility of shaking the foundation of their modernist consciousness. Although all religions consist of ideas (doctrines), actions (rituals), and community (religious organization), the modernization of Buddhism had to be started in the area of doctrine; in other words, the ini- tial modernization of Buddhism was the active reconsideration of traditional Buddhist teachings. In this respect, Kiyozawa and Suzuki are the representa- tives and reformers of Pure Land (Shinshū Im) and Zen Buddhism, respec- tively. Moreover, they both went well beyond the boundaries of the Buddhist schools mentioned above. During the history of modern Buddhism in Japan, there have been a num- ber of great scholars, ascetics, preachers and activists. Among these, Kiyozawa and Suzuki are, at least for me, unsurpassable, in the sense that they were attractive enough for others to want to imitate yet, at the same time, pow- erful enough to make these people think that such imitation was impossible. 7</page><page sequence="3">THE EASTERN BUDDHIST XXXV, 1 &amp; 2 2. Notability of Kiyozawa and Suzuki How well known is Kiyozawa Manshi today? When you see his name and Suzuki Daisetz's listed as representatives of modern Japanese Buddhism, many of you may be puzzled. The name and achievements of Suzuki Daisetz, as an exponent of modern Zen, are quite well recognized throughout the world. Kiyozawa Manshi's name and achievements, on the other hand, are only known among a limited number of intellectuals and within specific reli- gious orders, and are probably half-obscured from public awareness. Even in Nagoya, where he was born, and in Kyoto and Tokyo, where he made his career, his name has almost disappeared from people's memories. The prin- cipal of Tsutsui Elementary School where the monument com- memorating Kiyozawa's birthplace stands, hardly knew of his achievements. More amazingly, his grandchild, who is now the head priest of Kiyozawa's home temple, Saihö-ji ¡SÄ#, in Õhama ÄIS (Aichi prefecture), turned to me and asked with all honesty: "Was my grandfather such a great person?" While this was a rather refreshing experience for me, and Kiyozawa would have been happy to hear it, it shows that since even his nearest relatives feel this way, no wonder the public do not know his name. When the plan for Nihon no Meicho was first announced, I was told that the most common questions and complaints from readers to the publishing company (Chūēkoron-sha) were about why Kiyozawa's name was included among some fifty or more great figures representing Japan. They kept on asking who this Kiyozawa Manshi was. This reaction seems only natural. In terms of notability, there is a world of difference between Suzuki Daisetz and Kiyozawa Manshi. Suzuki, who has closed his life of ninety-plus years recently and whose name was first known abroad, left 30 volumes of writings and received the Order of Culture (XJbÜ #). Kiyozawa, on the other hand, ended his short life of forty-one years in the Meiji period, published only a few books, and was active only within a specific religious organization. His thoughts and actions, however, are easi- ly on par with those of Suzuki. In my mind, the main goal of this volume is to introduce Kiyozawa to the world again and, for that purpose, asking the world-renowned Suzuki to play a supporting role. Therefore, I am intent on proceeding with this Introduction in such a light. 3. Suzuki Daisetz's View on Kiyozawa Manshi Kiyozawa was born in 1 863 and was seven years older than Suzuki, who was born in 1 870. In the mid-Meij i period, when the former was making his career, 8</page><page sequence="4">HASHIMOTO: KIYOZAWA MANSHI &amp; D. T. SUZUKI Suzuki was in the United States. Thus, there was no direct contact between the two. In 1963, he expressed his own views on Kiyozawa when writing for the one-hundred-year commemoration of his birth. Though it is rather long, I would like to quote this passage as our introduction to Kiyozawa: Although I've never met Kiyozawa in person, the first time I heard his name was at the time of the World's Parliament of Religions held in Chicago in 1893. 1 was partially involved in this convention and at that time, I came across his book, Skeleton of a Philosophy of Religion. The exact content of that book I do not recall, but he seemed to have quite unprecedented ideas for that time. The Meiji period was the time when remarkable progress was made in every area of Japanese cultural history. Effervescent, up- and-coming young people were everywhere, and among those, Kiyozawa was prominent not only due to his intellect, but also because his strong will and passion were penetrated by the depth of his faith. Today, such prominence is still maintained among his pupils. You may say that Kiyozawa was indeed a type of genius in this realm. Kiyozawa' s emphasis on Absolute Other Power (zettai tariki $Ê Mi&amp;tí) was certainly passed down from the founder of Shin Buddhism, Shinran ÍSH. At the basis of this emphasis, we can also detect Kiyozawa's own living faith. For mere words about Other Power usually have no power in themselves. Any adherent of Shin Buddhism can speak such words, but their truth can only be achieved in someone like the myõkõnin such as Asahara Saiichi Kiyozawa added intellectual acuity to this faith and there is something in his thought that is readily accepted by today's younger generation. The influence of his vibrant, living faith must have resonated through the hearts of those who had close contact with him in his time. Though living to be 100 may be difficult for anyone, I believe he would have lived to my age (94 years old), if modern advanced medicine had been available at that time. If that were the case, I believe his thought would have been even more brilliant than what it had been in the short span of thirty or forty years. However, since all this ultimately depends on the working of the Tathāgata, there is little more I can say. 9</page><page sequence="5">THE EASTERN BUDDHIST XXXV, 1 &amp; 2 The idea of jinen hõni fi ff íí ftì (natural becoming through the working of the Dharma) is deeply embedded throughout Buddhism. This teaching is where we can find the deepest meanings of Eastern thought, as well as where we can most easily fall into shallow iner- tia. I insist that within "jinen hõni," we must acknowledge a sense of constant endeavor. Things need to be renewed each day. Now progress is expected of Buddhism in all areas. We await a second Kiyozawa or the second coming of Kiyozawa.1 4. The Nature of Buddhism in the Thought of Kiyozawa and Suzuki Kiyozawa and Suzuki each represented a different, but equally complete, model for the reconceptualization of Buddhism in the modern age. In his experiment to modernize Buddhism, Kiyozawa approached Buddhism (reli- gion) through the medium of the dialectic logic of Western philosophy. In other words, he moved from philosophy to religion. Suzuki, on the other hand, tried to modernize Buddhism by moving from religion to philosophy. Through his Zen experience, he uncovered the logic of non-duality ( sokuhi no ronri IP#(DfmS). While Kiyozawa attempted to realize Buddhism through the exclusive choice of the Pure Land tradition, Suzuki aimed at a universal Buddhism by demonstrating the ultimate oneness of Zen and Pure Land teach- ings. It can be said that, in their respective approaches, Kiyozawa provided the model for an ethical take on Buddhism, while Suzuki represented an aes- thetic one. Although this is a rather bold outline of their vast work, to summarize it even more roughly, the central concept in Kiyozawa's modernization of Buddhist thought was " seishin ffitt (Spirit)," while that of Suzuki's was " rei- sei litt (Spirituality)." The former is a concept mediated by Western philos- ophy, presupposing dualism in the reality and logic of religious experience. The latter is a genuine Japanese or Eastern concept based on monism. If religion is considered to be the relationship between a "subject" and the "Absolute" (sacred), for Kiyozawa, " seishin " means the attempt of the sub- ject to realize its mutual relationship with the Absolute, while for Suzuki, "rei- sei" means the work of the Absolute to subsume the subject. In other words, Kiyozawa tries to leap from " seishin " (i.e., the West) to " reisei " (i.e., the East) and Suzuki tries to encompass " seishin " (i.e., the West) inside of "rei- sei" (i.e., the East). Since religion is a self-realized fact concerning "the 1 "Foreword" in Fukuda 1963. 10</page><page sequence="6">HASHIMOTO: KIYOZAWA MANSHI &amp; D. T. SUZUKI Absolute," it is meaningless to ask who, Kiyozawa or Suzuki, is right. However, I must confess that I personally respect Kiyozawa more than Suzuki. While Kiyozawa remains unsurpassable for me, Suzuki feels like a famous, distant relative. Further, Kiyozawa was also a reformer of Buddhism as an institution. I mentioned earlier that the modernization of Buddhism needed to cover all three aspects of doctrine, ritual, and organization. As a minister of a Shin Buddhist denomination, Kiyozawa promoted reform not only in the area of doctrine, but also in the other two areas. Although Buddhism has been pro- fessed by many of the greatest intellectuals of each historical period and has occasionally been through restoration and transformation, in reality, the cus- tom of so-called Funeral Buddhism ( sõshiki bukkyõ has sustained institutional Buddhism throughout Japanese history. It can also be said that the biggest problem of Buddhism today may still lie in this gap between intel- lectual and popular Buddhism. Someone has to reform the religious organi- zation so that the gap between the two threads of Buddhism can be bridged. Kiyozawa Manshi tried very hard to do this, though finally, he seemed to end in failure. Here again, I cannot help but feel that Kiyozawa is simply beyond compare. 5. My Relation to Kiyozawa and Suzuki I think I should put down a few words about my own religious inclination. In terms of religious experience and ideas, I am following about the same path as Kiyozawa Manshi, in the sense that I too have moved from Western phi- losophy to Pure Land Buddhism. I was bom into a lay family, and in my youth, having neither interest in nor need for religion, I pursued Western philoso- phy. After passing the age of thirty, and led by various conditions, I became a Buddhist priest. Now, I am teaching Western philosophy at a university and have become the head minister of a small Pure Land temple. Below is a brief outline of my understanding of the Pure Land teaching. Its core is in the "faith ( shinjin fif'h)" of Amida Buddha's "Original Vow (hongan łJP)." This Original Vow of the Tathāgata for the salvation of all sentient beings is explained in the form of a myth in the Larger Sukhävaüvyüha Sūtra ( Daimuryõjukyõ ÁÍSMÍfft). For me, a major problem lay in the way this myth is set out. When Amida Buddha was still the Bõdhisattva Dharmākara (Hõzõ Bosatsu he made 48 Vows, all of which are expressed in the Chinese Buddhist scripture as "If, when I attain Buddhahood, [this condition is not fulfilled], may I not attain perfect 11</page><page sequence="7">THE EASTERN BUDDHIST XXXV, 1 &amp; 2 Enlightenment (WfiMiU . . . ^FfXIEÄ)." In the Japanese translation of the Sanskrit scripture, it reads: "If, after I have attained Enlightenment, [as long as this condition exists], may I not attain true supreme Enlightenment." Dharmākara had accomplished these Vows and became Amida Buddha. His Pure Land of Ultimate Bliss has surely been completed. However, is the Pure Land entirely the Other Shore ( higan ÍŘÍ#)? Could it be that the light of the Tathāgata of Immeasurable Light, unhindered throughout the ten directions, will never reach this defiled world ( shaba 3&amp;H)? If not, then how could peo- ple in this defiled world attain "faith" through the working of Absolute Other Power? Amida is the Buddha of Immeasurable Light. And yet, Dharmākara could not have attained perfect Enlightenment until this defiled world became a Pure Land. If he became the Buddha and remained transcendent in the Other World like the God of Christianity, then wouldn't we in this defiled world be left in the lurch? Don't Dharmākara's Vows take this form ("If, when I attain Buddhahood, . . . , may I not attain perfect Enlightenment") because these were made specfically with us, of this defiled world, in mind? (These are my own ideas, and not to be contused with the official doctrine of the Pure Land denominations.) It is troubling if Amida Buddha has not become a Buddha; if he has, however, that also becomes troublesome. This was my problem. Then, I came across the following poem by a myõkõnin Tochihira Fuji W U, a farmer's wife from Oku-Noto fttĚS. With this, my "faith" became steadfast: Where does Hõzõ [Dharmākara] have his place of practice? All of it is in the pith of my bosom, Namu Amida Butsu. It was Suzuki's Myõkõnin fcWÀ (published in 1948) that told me about her for the first time. In this sense, Suzuki was my guide to Pure Land Buddhism. The first book I read of his was Shükyö keiken no jijitsu (Truth of Religious Experience), also a study of the myõkõnin, published in 1943. 1 came across it by chance while I was in high school during World War II. My next book by Suzuki was Zen no shisõ (Zen Thought), which I pur- chased second-hand at around the same time. In the back of this book, the previous owner had scribbled: "I don't understand what it means. I have no idea what it is about. I sort of understand, but don't understand," which also reflected my own feelings after reading this book. My understanding of Zen still remains the same today due to my lack of intelligence. However, now I do have the task of explaining Suzuki Daisetz and there is no other way for me to approach him but as my Pure Land teacher. I think Buddhism, in spite 12</page><page sequence="8">HASHIMOTO: KIYOZAWA MANSHI &amp; D. T. SUZUKI of its diversity, must ultimately be one. Suzuki, who claims the oneness of Zen and Pure Land Buddhism, is an irreplaceable teacher for me. It was much later that I found out about Kiyozawa Manshi. I first knew about him as a pioneer of importing Western philosophy to Japan. More importantly, however, he was the first to search for the "logic" of a religious peace of mind ( anjin SU), which was deeply concerned with my own prob- lem: How is it logically possible to say that Amida has already attained Buddhahood and, at the same time, has not? By following the thoughts and actions of Kiyozawa and Suzuki, let us now explore the possibility of Japanese Pure Land Buddhism today. II. Kiyozawa Manshi - Man of Seishin 1 . His Birth The significance of Kiyozawa Manshi as a modem Buddhist was aptly char- acterized by Soga Ryõjin It fr Ji if (1875-1971), one of his spiritual succes- sors, as follows: "Until Kiyozawa appeared, no one seriously considered Other Power faith. Without him, Shinran would never have been regarded as one of the pinnacles in Japanese intellectual history. The faith, which Kiyozawa devoted his entire life to achieving, will long remain in the annals of Japanese Buddhism and may be the greatest accomplishment since Hõnen and Shinran." Before Kiyozawa came into the picture, from the time of its formation Japanese Pure Land and Shinran' s schools had been ignored by most intel- lectuals as a religion for the ignorant masses. What kind of path did he have to tread to achieve it? Let us now trace his journey from its beginning. On June 26, 1863, Kiyozawa Manshi (Mannosuke fiSföli) was bom in Nagoya as the eldest son of Tokunaga Naganori the chief of a foot soldiers' regiment of the Owari Tokugawa house. The fact that he was bom into a low-ranking samurai family on the Tokugawa side during the Meiji Restoration, meant that he had no hope of advancement in the Satsuma/Choshū-dominated government. Many intellectuals of that time, especially in the field of religion, such as Inoue Enryö fr i: PI 7 and Murakami Senshõ of Buddhism, Uchimura Kanzö fWÜÜE of Christianity, Uemura Masahisa and Niijima J5 fiftU, were all in the same situa- tion. After the Meiji Restoration, the family was reduced to poverty and his father had to peddle tea from a bamboo basket. According to his own "Outline of my Academic Record ( shūgaku rireki gairyaku Kiyozawa 13</page><page sequence="9">THE EASTERN BUDDHIST XXXV, 1 &amp; 2 entered a newly-established foreign language school (English) in Nagoya at the age of 12 in 1875, but this was closed down in 1878. Then, he studied German at Aichi Prefectural Medical School but stopped soon after, proba- bly due to financial difficulties. The record then states: "In 1879 (16 years old), moved to Kyoto in January, was ordained a Shin Buddhist priest in February, and entered Ikuei School in March." Later, Kiyozawa confessed that, "I became a priest because Honganji told me if I did so they would sup- port my studies, and not with the noble intentions that Hõnen or Shinran had had." Such a sentiment seems understandable considering that the young Kiyozawa had already learned English and German, and was excellent in his schoolwork. Incidentally, Hõnen and Shinran were also ordained when young, but did not experience their true calling until much later when they became true Buddhists. At any rate, the main reason for Kiyozawa's ordina- tion was poverty. 2. His Studies With respect to his ordination, Kiyozawa's family background should also be noted. The Tõkai region where they lived was a stronghold of the Higashi Honganji (Shinshū Õtani-ha) organization. His parents, especially his moth- er, were ardent followers. Together with them, he had been reading Shinran' s Shõshinge IE if il, Wasan fPSt and Rennyo's Ofumi WÄ every day from the age of five or six. This background qualified him for support under the denom- ination' s educational policy, which stated that "exceptional students are to be recruited from among the children of our followers and to be educated using scholarship funds." Higashi Honganji founded the Ikuei School in July 1876 and the abbot stated that it was created "to build a firm foundation from which we can compete with Shinto, other Buddhist denominations, and foreign reli- gions," and also to better the situation where "some followers' children seemed to go astray and even violate laws, because they neither receive prop- er education nor understand the truth of Shin Buddhism." In other words, the scholarship system was established to restore and maintain the religious insti- tution, which was facing an external threat from the Meiji government's anti- Buddhist, pro-Shintõ policies and Christian advancement as well as internal concern over the degeneration within the denomination. After studying in Kyoto for four years, Kiyozawa was sent to Tokyo to further his learning. He entered the Preparatory School of Tokyo Imperial University in January 1883 and was enrolled in its Philosophy Department in September, 1 884. Throughout his study at university, he was always first in 14</page><page sequence="10">HASHIMOTO: KIYOZAWA MANSHI &amp; D. T. SUZUKI his class and received a scholarship. How he felt about his studies may be found in the following passage of his diary: Almost 20 years have already passed since I was born. If I convert this into the number of days, with 360 days a year, that would be 7200 days. If I convert that into minutes, that would be 10,368,000 minutes and, in seconds, 622,080,000. This is an enormous amount of time indeed, but what I have accomplished so far has been growth in the length of my body and (an ever so slight) change in my brain.2 As Shiba Ryõtarõ B1J§j§;k)!|5 acutely pointed out, Kiyozawa was a cerebral type who had to calculate 20 years in such a manner to feel the actual length of time. According to him, Kiyozawa "was not the type who can grasp the heart of the matter with artistic intuition, but who reaches a certain conclu- sion after rigorous rational investigation."3 Kiyozawa also made the following remark: "During the cherry blossom season, people carry their bottles of sake and picnic baskets and go under the floriferous cherry trees and pleasantly drink and eat. I don't know why they do this. It does not make sense to me." Kiyozawa was truly a man of the Meiji period; he was indeed already a man of " seishin ," especially in terms of his strong work ethic and stoicism. 3. Encountering Hegel through Fenollosa Kiyozawa studied Western philosophy under Ernest Fenollosa, the first for- eign professor in the Philosophy Department at Tokyo Imperial University, who gave lectures on German Idealists such as Kant, Fichte, Schelling and Hegel as well as British philosophers such as Mill and Spencer. Fenollosa taught that the harmony between Hegel and Spencer, the pinnacles of German and British philosophy, should be the goal for the development of philosophy in the future. However, for Kiyozawa' s "philosophy," his encounter with Hegelian philosophy came to have a great significance. Along with Miyake Setsurei his senior in the Philosophy Depart- ment, Kiyozawa was the first to critically deal with Hegelian philosophy in Japan. Hegel's organic system with universal "Reason" and the dialectic syl- logism of the finite, the Infinite, and "Spirit" was later reinterpreted from a Buddhist perspective in Kiyozawa' s philosophy (Philosophy of Religion). 2 KMZ, vol. 8, p. 3. 3 Shiba 1969. 15</page><page sequence="11">THE EASTERN BUDDHIST XXXV, 1 &amp; 2 Kiyozawa's original intention in studying in Tokyo was to become a philosopher. While there, he joined the Philosophy Society, founded by Inoue Enryö, also a recipient of the Higashi Honganji scholarship, and became the editor of Tetsugakkai zasshi (Journal of the Philosophy Association) along with Okada Ryöhei RIE9ä¥. After graduating in July 1888, Kiyozawa continued his studies in the philosophy of religion at the graduate level and became a board member of the newly-established Tetsugakukan (Academy of Philosophy), where he taught classes in psychology, logic, and philosophy. Virtually all Japanese philosophers at that time were members of the Philosophy Society, including Katõ Hiroyuki in M'jUŽ., Nishi Amane Sd, Nishimura Shigeki Eft/^łsł, Toyama Shūichi 54 lil IE-, Inoue Tetsujirõ Ariga Nagao ÍTffflÈt, Tanahashi Ichirõ ffl IS- ĚI5, and Miyake Setsurei. According to the prospectus written by Inoue Enryö, this group, through a comparative study of Eastern and Western phi- losophy, looked towards "the incorporation of the merits of both traditions to formulate a new philosophy." Kiyozawa, himself, must have been eager to become such a philosopher. Inoue Tetsujirõ, the founder of academic philos- ophy in the Meiji period, thought that "in our country, we have had the tra- dition of the philosophy of Shintõ, Confucianism and Buddhism since ancient times" and, therefore, considered Western philosophy as little more than "another system of philosophical thought." Kiyozawa, on the other hand, was keenly aware of the logical and academic nature of Western philosophy. 4. Metaphysics in the Meiji Period Metaphysics (or "Pure Philosophy") in the Meiji period before Kiyozawa held an organic, pantheistic world- view. Inoue Enryö's "non-dualism of body and mind in true suchness (XiD^uWffliPII)," Inoue Tetsujirö's "phenome- non as real existence (ïSÂiPUÎEln)," and Miyake Setsurei's "monism of the universe (^tìì®- Ü)" were all examples of such world- views. However, we can see little substantial philosophical reflection on their logic when Inoue Enryö and Inoue Tetsujirõ attempted to unify the binaries of body and mind, phenomenon and reality, relative and absolute. This was set forth in their ideas of "the reason of dualistic consubstantiation (n jt^iķcDM)" and "the view of complete harmony of all binaries (RBtffllP)," respectively. Miyake Setsurei was the first Meiji philosopher to study Hegelian philos- ophy and its dialectics. His metaphysics owes a great deal to Hegel, yet his methodology was not that of dialectics but of analogical inference from the known to the unknown, based on an outmoded anthropomorphism. Yet 16</page><page sequence="12">HASHIMOTO: KIYOZAWA MANSHI &amp; D. T. SUZUKI Miyake made the first attempt for a metaphysics using a logical method based on "Eastern philosophy," in that he tried to "correct the problem of losing track of priorities and being caught up in wording." In other words, he real- ized that a method of metaphysics had to go beyond "rhetoric" and attain "logic." 5. Kiyozawa Manshi as a Philosopher Kiyozawa's "philosophy" was not fully formed until after his return to Kyoto in 1 889, when he gave up an academic career as a philosopher in Tokyo and started on his path as a man of the Shinshū Õtani denomination. Let us now analyze his "philosophy" and clarify its significance. In the Meiji period, prior to Nishida Kitarö's Zen no kenkyü (An Inquiry into the Good), Kiyozawa was the leading intellectual who "carefully and rationally" investigated metaphysics with a strict sense of logic. Kiyozawa's metaphysics was essentially very similar to that of both Inoues and Miyake in the sense that it was a philosophy based on an organic understanding of the world. However, his critique of Hegelian dialectics and his restructuring of a Buddhist dialectics clearly indicate his acute sense of logic and his demand for academic rigor in his method. Furthermore, his logic served as a clear basis for Nishida Kitarö's logic of "self-identity of absolute contradictories ($63f ?-JíWĚE|o]- )." Also as a historian of philosophy, Kiyozawa's Seiyõ tet- sugakushi kõgi ¡'MíffUřiérf at (Lectures on the History of Western Philosophy) was the first in Japan, preceding Seiyõ tetsugakushi ftTfM'r'r'ii (The History of Western Philosophy) by Õnishi Haj ime W řV and Seiyõ tet- sugakushiyou (A Historical Outline of Western Philosophy) by Hatano Seiichi . Kiyozawa's metaphysics and philosophy of religion can be understood by looking at his Junsei tetsugaku M il: rì'Tr (Pure Philosophy), Shisõ kaihatsu kan (The Developmental Circle of Thought), and Shúkyõ tetsug- aku gaikotsu (Skeleton of a Philosophy of Religion). Let us, for instance, trace his logical elucidation of the idea of "religion." First of all, Junsei tetsugaku "was based upon the theory of German philosopher Rudolf Lotze {Metaphysics)" and, just like Lotze, tried to construct a metaphysics in the manner of Leibniz. According to Kiyozawa, "pure philosophy" examines "varying entities" (things, events, and relationships) and "seeks a universal organic connection among all things." "Pure philosophy," furthermore, "places emphasis on order (logic) as primary and does not emphasize style (rhetoric)." In his analysis of "actual existence," Kiyozawa advocated the the- 17</page><page sequence="13">THE EASTERN BUDDHIST XXXV, 1 &amp; 2 ory of the "oneness of all things (75^- #0" and stressed that "both the 'one that includes all things' and its respective manifestations" are "spiritual enti- ties (ÄttWÜ#:)." Here, his approach was entirely analytical. On the "becom- ing" of entities, he stated: "Existence is not non-existence and non-existence is not existence. No matter how we ponder this, it is impossible for us to con- sider that both existence and non-existence are included in the same entity. However, 'becoming' is impossible without the unity of existence and non- existence. We are then compelled to accept the unity of existence and non- existence as an inconceivable mystery." Moreover, referring to the theory of the "oneness of all things," he stated: "It is obvious that if we posit that the many and the one are the same, the rule of logic would collapse." He then continued, stating that for now this can be settled by "explaining the 'one' in terms of the Unlimited (Infinite), and the 'many' in terms of the limited (finite). The combination of these is called the 'oneness of all things.'" This problem, i.e., how to discover a logic of this "inconceivable" unity of being and non-being, the many and the one, became a serious issue, not only for Kiyozawa, but also for all Japanese metaphysicians to follow. 6. Seiyõ tetsugakushi kõgi [Lectures on the History of Western Philosophy] - Critique of Hegelian Dialectics I Kiyozawa's Seiyõ tetsugakushi kõgi was the first historical survey of Western philosophy in Japan. He covered "From Thaïes to Spencer" and even pro- vided criticism on modern philosophers to express his insights. In this piece, we can see his implicit "critique" on the dialectic logic of Hegel for the first time. Kiyozawa asked: "Should the first pure being [the Idea] and the syllogism [dialectic] be considered as one or two, and if they are two, which comes first? Also, when one influences the other, what rules should it follow? If they are one, how do the many develop from the one? If we critique [Hegel's logic] in this way, we find there are still some inadequacies." We must say this is acute criticism which revealed Hegel's surprisingly poor methodological awareness, since "if pure being and the syllogism exist side by side, that would be relative, and not absolute philosophy." At the same time, Kiyozawa also stated that "what I like about Hegel's argument" is that he claims "opposites are equal" and clarifies that "everything has two aspects: that of being equal and that of being different. Seen from one position, all things in the universe, being this and that, oppose each other. However, from another viewpoint, they are positively related, namely being equal to each other." Kiyozawa then con- 18</page><page sequence="14">HASHIMOTO: KIYOZAWA MANSHI &amp; D. T. SUZUKI eludes here that "therefore, it is appropriate to say that there have been two or more things since the beginning," and continues "there are more than two from the beginning and that is said to be one. One is, from the beginning, not one. The many exist as the one and the one exists where the many exist. They are neither completely the same nor entirely different (T^- The one as many and the many as one, only this is immutable. Call it Nature, it is all of nature. Think of it as True Suchness (X#D), and it is True Suchness. Call it myriad things, and it is myriad things." In this way, by critically incorporat- ing Hegelian dialectics, Kiyozawa was building a foundation for new Buddhist thought. 7. Shisõ kaihatsu kan [The Developmental Circle of Thought] - Philosophy and Religion Kiyozawa' s Shisõ kaihatsu kan links Hegel's logical and systematic thought with the Lotus Sutra's "ten suchnesses (+$□*!)." He argues that the progress of "thought" needs to form a continuously revolving "circle," always shift- ing from one category to another. This was a confirmation that the "truthful- ness" of metaphysics remains within its systematic "consistency." General philosophy does not form such a "circle" because "it cannot be easily attained." "However, one like the Buddha, with his all-seeing wisdom clear- ly perceives the actual form of all phenomena and can freely explain this truth. Hegel, on the other hand, understood that philosophy, in its entirety, consti- tutes a circle, but in his explanation, as most students of philosophy know, he could not avoid confusion and error." Speaking about the relationship between philosophy and religion, Kiyozawa stated that, through philosophy, "when one completes the developmental circle of thought, returning to the original, fundamental category, where reason is satisfied, one then flips into religion." At this stage of Kiyozawa' s thought, the path is leading from phi- losophy to religion; and religion is what should be reached at the end of philo- sophical enterprise. 8. Shükyö tetsugaku gaikotsu - Critique of Hegelian Dialectics II The results of his intellectual quest are compiled in Shükyö tetsugaku gai- kotsu. As previously mentioned in the quote from D. T. Suzuki, this book was translated by Noguchi Zenshirõ lfPf§ElÊ[5 and brought to the World's Parliament of Religions at the World Exposition in Chicago in 1893, where it received recognition from foreign readers. The central categories here are "Infinite" and "finite." While the reason- 19</page><page sequence="15">THE EASTERN BUDDHIST XXXV, 1 &amp; 2 ing mind relates to the "Infinite" through "investigation," the religious mind relates to it in "acceptance." Kiyozawa insists "when reason and faith are in contradiction, we should take the former and throw away the latter." This was his extreme position as a philosopher. Although he created a philosophy of religion, he still hadn't had "the experience" of faith "which accepts the Infinite." His philosophy of religion can be summarized as follows: the finite (depen- dent, relative, part, imperfect), and the Infinite (Independent, Absolute, Whole, Perfect) are of the same substance ("identity of the two terms" nikõ dotai -TĪMff ). The universe is "an organic constitution, in which innumer- able finite entities make up one body, the Infinite." Moreover, Kiyozawa stresses "the principle of persistent identity" in the "becoming" of these finite entities, which is "an action of the entire universe or of the Infinite itself." Then, he goes on to criticize Hegel's syllogism [dialectic] of thesis-antithe- sis-synthesis: Thesis (A) necessarily and inevitably leads to its antithesis (not- A), and the two (A and not- A) again necessarily and inevitably lead to synthesis (B). So again, thesis (B) leads to its antithesis (not-B) and the two (B and not-B) again lead to the synthesis (C), and so on. Here are the two steps or processes: First, (A) leads to (not- A), one antecedent leading to a consequent. Second, (A) and (non-A) lead to (B), two antecedents leading to a consequent. The second process is quite a new view of the law. However, we must ask why, in one case, only one antecedent leads to a consequent, while in the other, two antecedents lead to a consequent. If a single antecedent could lead to a consequent, why not always so? Where is the necessity of introducing a new process? However, we can never understand how a single antecedent could lead to a consequent.4 According to Kiyozawa, "whenever a thing changes, there must be an out- standing something, a guest 3§r so to speak, to stimulate the master ì for the meeting Ś." Thus, Hegelian dialectics should not be thesis-antithesis-syn- thesis, but rather Master-Guest-Meeting. This is "the Law of Cause and Condition" in Buddhism; Master-Guest-Meeting is the Buddhist dialectics of Cause-Condition-Effect. Why does Hegel's thought have such a methodological inconsistency? According to Kiyozawa, "since Hegel tries to develop a 'pluraristic relative' 4 KMZ, vol. 1, pp. 21-22. 20</page><page sequence="16">HASHIMOTO: KIYOZAWA MANSHI &amp; D. T. SUZUKI out of a Christian, 'monistic Absolute,'" he "confuses these two modes as though they are governed by the same principle." However, "there is no cause-and-effect relationship between the relative and the Absolute." Kiyozawa continues: "The Infinite, True Suchness, and the finite, myriad things, are two aspects of the same entity, neither separate entities nor the suc- cessive states of the same entity. That the One itself develops into two or the Absolute becomes relative, is inconceivable to us." In this way, Kiyozawa rejected the Christian theory of a transcendental God but accepted that of immanent pantheism. For Kiyozawa, "the Absolute developing itself to the relative" meant that "True Suchness (cause) and Ignorance (condition) give birth to myriad things (effect)." Ignorance is "nothing but the incapacity of our intelligence, the inconceivability personified." The development of the Infinite spirit in that of the finite should be a finite being turning its ideal or boundary from the finite to the Infinite. Kiyozawa's Buddhism was that of "peace of mind, culture of virtue," that is, self-disciplined Buddhism. Moreover, he continuously had to face the alogical paradox of religious expe- rience - "the relation of the finite many within the Infinite One is truly incon- ceivable."5 For Kiyozawa, the choice between the two mysteries - "the Absolute One becoming the relative many" (Christianity) and "the finite many within the Infinite One" (Buddhism) - was beyond logic or "faith" that transcends logic. In order to modernize Buddhism, Kiyozawa chose the latter and tried to sys- tematize it as a philosopher. As he states "the work of religion begins at the point at which philosophy ends," Kiyozawa first engaged in a "philosophi- cal" enterprise of "pursuing" the Infinite, after which he devoted himself to the "religious" task of "accepting" the Infinite. Moving from Tokyo to Kyoto, Kiyozawa decisively abandoned "philoso- phy" and attempted to live "religion." He put aside worldly benefits and chose to seek the path of faith. In such straightforwardness too, Kiyozawa was a man of seishin. 9. Obligation to the Religious Order Why did Kiyozawa decide to return to Kyoto? He mentions his indebtedness to the religious order (Higashi Honganji): "I was bom into a secular house- hold, but by fate, entered the priesthood of Shinshū and received an educa- tion from the head temple; for this, I feel greatly indebted and am determined 5 KMZ, vol. 1, pp. 21-24. 21</page><page sequence="17">THE EASTERN BUDDHIST XXXV, 1 &amp; 2 to pay back such kindness." While he demonstrated such a Confucian ethic, his decision to go back to Kyoto could have been based on his religious desire to experience "the inconceivalibity" of "the finite many within the Infinite One," which could not be theorized, and thus, could not be reached through his academic/philosophical enterprise. He tried to approach religion through "experiments" to develop "peace of mind, and to foster virtue." In a letter, he writes: "There is nothing in this world as interesting as these experiments." In July 1889 at the age of 26, Tokunaga Manshi (whose family name was changed to Kiyozawa after 1896) became the principal of Kyoto Public Middle School (later to become Kyoto First Middle School), whose manage- ment was entrusted to Higashi Honganji by the city of Kyoto. In August of the same year, he entered Saihõ-ji, a large temple in Õhama, (present-day Hekinan city, Aichi prefecture), and married Kiyozawa Yasuko. As a princi- pal with a good salary, he established a residence, grew a mustache, wore a frock coat, walked with a cane, and used a rickshaw when going out. It was a short, colorful moment in his personal life, and quite a drastic contrast to the coming "experiments" of a stoic lifestyle. In 1891, Kiyozawa completely changed his situation. He shaved off his hair, switched from Western-style clothes to priestly vestments, and began to walk to work in wooden clogs and a black robe. He stopped smoking and eat- ing meat, kept away from his wife and children, strictly structured his daily life and chanted the Three Pure Land Sutras morning and evening. Ultimately, he reached an ascetic lifestyle, cutting out salt and cooked food from his diet, eating only buckwheat flour mixed with water at each meal. Such a lifestyle indeed reflected his nom de plume at the time, Skeleton. His asceticism seems to intensify after his mother's death in 1892. Through these "experiments," Kiyozawa attempted with his own body to prove what he wrote in his Skeleton of a Philosophy of Religion , seeking to realize "the inconceivable" within himself. While struggling in these self-power practices, which attempt to reach the Infinite from the finite, he did, in fact, find the teaching of the Other Power, where the Infinite embraces the finite. Later, in "Shükyö teki shinnen no hissu jõken fetD&amp;MŠkft (Requirements for a Religious Conviction)," he wrote: "If you decide to go after religious conviction, you must first stop depending on anything except religion. Unless you go through the gateway of pessimism once, where you leave your house behind, throw away your possessions, and turn away from your wife and children, it is difficult to attain true religious conviction."6 Surely, without "the cultivation of virtue" through self-power practice, one 22</page><page sequence="18">HASHIMOTO: KIYOZAWA MANSHI &amp; D. T. SUZUKI may never gain anjin from the Other Power. Here, Kiyozawa had already practiced and experimented with the abstinence promoted in the four Āgama sutras of Southern Buddhism, which he would later discover. In the midst of such rigorous practice, working together with Inaba Masamaru ýl and Sawayanagi Masatarõ žRWBcácÉR, Kiyozawa engaged himself in lecturing, management, and reform at Kyoto Jinjõ Junior High School, Õtani Middle School, Shinshū University Dormitory, and Okazaki Gakkan (an educational institute for the Abbot of Higashi Honganji). His goal was the independence of Shin Buddhist studies from sectarian pol- itics, but his reform policy was too radical to be accepted by the head temple. Furthermore, in his religious education policy, he established very strict rules of conduct in which students had to wear hemp garments and black robes. Consequently, he was confronted with a school strike by the junior high dor- mitory students. Finally, in April 1895, as he was pushing his "own-power" practice to the limit, his innate frail constitution, exhausted from hard work and malnutrition from a strict diet, succumbed to tuberculosis and he was sent to a sanatorium in Nishi Tarumi in Kobe, Hyõgo prefecture. He said to his friends who had recommended a change of air: "Old Tokunaga died here. Now I leave this corpse at your disposal." This marked the beginning of his quest for Other Power faith. 10. Awakening In May 1903, the year before his death, Kiyozawa recollected the process of his attainment of faith: I remember that during my medical retreat in 1895 and 1896, my view on life altered completely and I almost changed my feelings about self-power, but the ebb and flow of human affairs still kept bothering my mind and heart. For example, the administrative issues concerning Higashi Honganji in 1 896 and 1 897 prompted the reform movement with the publication of the journal, Kyõkai jigen If (Timely Words for the Religious World) in 1 897 and 1 898. From the end of 1898 to the beginning of 1899, I read the four Agama sutras and, with the discontinuance of the journal, disband- ed the above-mentioned movement in April of that year. I then had the opportunity to rest in my own temple and reflect upon my own 6 KMZ, vol. 6, p. 76. 23</page><page sequence="19">THE EASTERN BUDDHIST XXXV, 1 &amp; 2 thoughts, but was not able to maintain my calm against the troubles in human affairs due to the lack of my own spiritual discipline. In autumn and winter of 1899, 1 came across the writings of Epictetus and was deeply impressed. After accepting the invitation to go to Tokyo in 1900, 1 had more opportunities for spiritual discipline and felt like moving forward on that path. Now the Buddha has given me more difficult tasks and led me fur- ther on the spiritual path, for which I shall always be grateful. May 31, 1903.7 From this passage, we can clearly see Kiyozawa's "awakening ( eshin I'd 'U)" and "attainment of faith {gyakushin Sift)." For the external circum- stances of such awakening, we see the onset of his illness, the failure in the religious reform and troubles at home (temple). For its internal circumstances, we see his committed contemplation on the Āgama sutras, Epictetus and Shinran. With these circumstances, Kiyozawa established " Seishin-shugi if If iň (Spiritual Activism)" that defined his position on "religion." For the first time, on his sickbed in Nishi Tarumi, Kiyozawa began to pay close attention to the teachings of Shinran, who had also trodden the long path of philosophical inquiry and then come under Hõnen, who had already real- ized Other Power faith after traveling along the same spiritual path. Kiyozawa did not simply accept Shinran, as presented by Higashi Honganji, but had dis- covered him on his own. Without relying on existing dogmas, he studied anew the Teaching ( kyõ Wl), Practice (gyõ ff), Faith (shin ff ) and Realization (shõ BE) of Shinran's Kyõgyõshinshõ Sfritti and tried to develop his own phi- losophy in the Skeleton of a Philosophy of Religion that would be more rele- vant, historically, existentially and experientially. The result was amassed in "Zaishõ sangeroku ffilT tìtoli (The Record of Repentance in Bed)," which he had written in Nishi Tarumi. Here, we need to pay special attention to the ele- ment of Faith, which stresses both the active nature of the Infinite Other Power and the passive nature of finite living creatures. For Kiyozawa, who had experimented with self-power practices, the awareness of "being extremely evil, and the worst practicer" as well as the "inevitability of karmie retribution" and the subsequent sense of "repentance (, sänge ÜHÍ5)" became real for the first time, which was what awoke his faith in the Other Power. "Zaishõ sangeroku" was Kiyozawa's self-acquired Shin 7 KMZ, vol. 8, pp. 441-2. 24</page><page sequence="20">HASHIMOTO: KIYOZAWA MANSHI &amp; D. T. SUZUKI Buddhist studies. Subsequently, how did he view Higashi Honganji with this new realization? 1 1 . The Religious Reform Movement The main concerns of this denomination in the mid-Meiji period were the reconstruction of Honganji's burnt down main hall and a large debt. These two important tasks were handled through bank loans and donations from branch temples under the rigid administration of Atsumi Kaien who was put in charge of the head temple's internal affairs, accounting and doc- trinal studies in 1889. This naturally furthered the predominance of secular power over religious power, the denomination's degeneration, and the stag- nation of Shin Buddhist studies. This situation was unbearable for Kiyozawa who had set the advancement of these studies as the main goal of the mod- ernization of Buddhism. When the fundamental educational reform to which Kiyozawa and his comrades had devoted themselves was rejected by such conservatives as Atsumi in 1 895 , they were prompted to appeal for the denom- ination's general reform. In October 1896, Kiyozawa established the Kyõkai jigen-sha tt in Shirakawa Village in the north-east of Kyoto with Inoue Hochū Kiyokawa Enjõ if JURiá, Tsukimi Kakuryõ ñ M, #7 and others, and published seventeen issues of Kyõkai jigen from October 1 897 to April 1 899, engaging in a spectacular fight with the head temple. These four together with Inaba Masamaru and Imagawa Kakushin who raised money by working as local teachers, founded the so-called "Shirakawa- tõ ÙlW-yt (Shirakawa Party)." They were also the original drafters of the impeachment letter to Higashi Honganji in the first issue of Kyõkai jigen. The main purpose of Kiyozawa' s movement was clearly expressed in this journal, which discussed the ideas applicable not only to the denomination, but also to the general reform of all Buddhist schools in Japan. Kiyozawa's ideas were quite radical. The readers may well have felt as though they were reading the manifesto of the recent left-wing student move- ment. In fact, Kiyozawa was facing the same problem, for he was dealing with the democratization of Higashi Honganji with emphasis on the liberalization of Shin Buddhist studies. Kiyozawa received nationwide support and a national reform alliance was also established. The issues he raised did not simply concern Atsumi or any other single administration. In fact, it implied the overthrow of Honganji's feudalistic system. If Kiyozawa's ideal had been realized, Higashi Honganji could have done nothing but collapse (although Kiyozawa was still blind to the issue of the abbot's hereditary succession, 25</page><page sequence="21">THE EASTERN BUDDHIST XXXV, 1 &amp; 2 which made him a typical Meiji person). However, though 20,000 people signed the reform petition supporting Kiyozawa, it was still only 2 percent of the one million followers belonging to the denomination. Most of the priests and followers were not particularly pleased with the reform or were simply indifferent. The progress of Kiyozawa' s battle also resembled that of the left- wing student movement. Although superficially his demands appeared to have been accepted, in reality Kiyozawa and his allies were outsmarted by the Atsumi administration, as well as the following one headed by Ishikawa Shuntai tīJUSo" . Kiyozawa must have known how the situation was at the branch temple level, as he, himself, was not welcomed by his parishioners. He looked unkempt, had lung disease, rejected the ideas of hell and the Pure Land, and only discussed complex issues. He was often not allowed to perform services and was about to be banished from his own temple. Once, he gave a talk at the Hõ-on-kõ $8®Üí service with his spittoon. Reportedly, when the service began, the hall was overflowing with people, but by the afternoon, only a few still remained. What sort of reform could he possibly carry out in such a des- perate condition? He fought a hopeless battle from the start, and the issues he struggled with are still unresolved today. In the end, the six reformers were excommunicated and the movement ended in failure. Kiyozawa had no choice but to admit that he had underesti- mated the difficulty of reforming Higashi Honganji with 7,000 branch tem- ples and "now will abandon the reform movement entirely and devote myself to gaining religious conviction." Through this movement, Kiyozawa recog- nized that, before the reform of the structure and system, the spiritual growth of each priest and follower need to come first. Hence he decided to advance the Seishin-shugi Movement as a teacher. 12. The Four Āgamas and Epictetus According to his "Byõshõ zassi (Journal from the Sickbed)," Kiyozawa had started reading the four Āgamas on New Year's Day in 1899 and finished them by February 15th. He was the first Meiji scholar to appre- ciate the Āgamas, which had formerly been neglected as being Theravāda scriptures. With the spirit of a Buddhist practitioner, he was trying to discover the everyday practice of Śakyamuni from these ancient texts. After being pardoned by Higashi Honganji in April 1899, Kiyozawa first returned to Saihõ-ji from Kyoto with his family. Then moved to Tokyo in September to become the President of Shinshū University which had 26</page><page sequence="22">HASHIMOTO: KIYOZAWA MANSHI &amp; D. T. SUZUKI just been moved there. While staying at his friend Sawayanagi Masatarö's residence, he came across and read The Discourses of Epictetus, which he called "the best book in the West." Why did this Stoic philosopher from Rome impress Kiyozawa so much? In Rõsenki HUMS (December Fan), Kiyozawa divided Epictetus' lessons into ten items. Among these, the first and the most important one was to distinguish between the voluntary $0Ä and involuntary U£ūJt and to dwell in anjin, which does not pursue involuntariness. Kiyozawa states: There exist voluntary and involuntary things. The voluntary things are opinions, actions, and likes/dislikes; the involuntary things are physical bodies, properties, honors and status. The former belong to one's own doing while the latter do not. In dealing with volun- tary things, one is free, unlimited and not interfered with. With respect to involuntary things, one is feeble, enslaved and in the palm of another's hand. When perceiving this distinction incorrectly, one encounters interference, lapses into sorrow, cries out, and comes to curse and slander gods and people. Those who correctly recognize what 'voluntary' is experience no oppression, encounter no inter- ference, slander no one, do not curse heaven, hurt no one, are hurt by no one, nor have any enemies in the world.8 What Kiyozawa wanted to stress was to "accept what's given by Heaven and to do one's best." 13. Kõkõdõ In his administration at Shinshū University, Kiyozawa aimed at educating stu- dents as Buddhists. His policy was, however, compromised by the secular demands of the students, who wanted the school to be accredited by the Ministry of Education in order for them to obtain teaching cetificates. In October 1903, Kiyozawa submitted his resignation. Though he was not suc- cessful as a reformer, those three years in Tokyo were his most productive as a religious person, for Kiyozawa' s Seishin-shugi was consummated and his related movement expanded. Pupils such as Akegarasu Haya B&amp;ÄÄ, Sasaki Gesshõ Tada Kanae and Tokiwa Daijõ had gathered around Kiyozawa in Tokyo in September 1 901 , marking the beginning of Kõkõdõ p. "Kõkõ" 8 KMZ, vol. 8, p. 356. 27</page><page sequence="23">THE EASTERN BUDDHIST XXXV, 1 &amp; 2 implies "one's direct experience of a thing itself" and the state of being ful- filled, while fully relying on the Absolute Infinite. This gathering moved from Hongö to Sugamo and continued even after Kiyozawa' s death until 1919. The journal, Seishinkai ###!?• (Spiritual World), also continued to be published, and in addition to the above-mentioned four, other bright minds contributed to modern Pure Land Buddhism. Those who joined the group were: Kusunoki Ryûzô Kondõ Jungo Ando Shūichi ; Soga Ryõjin if Kaneko Daiei Akanuma Chizen and Yamabe Shūgaku This free and egalitarian society, resembling "the original sañgha ," was opened to anyone who was interested in Buddhism. In those days, what Kiyozawa loved to read most was the Tannishõ (®Y4 łi1), which was written by Yuien BiR twenty or thirty years after Shinran's death. Although Rennyo H#n, the 8th Abbot of Honganji, first acknowledged its importance, he later stipulated that it should not be circulated indiscrimi- nately, due to its possible dangers for the denomination. It was Kiyozawa Manshi, along with Nanjö Bun'yü S^:£ctt and Chikazumi Jõkan ifiÂfèû, who reintroduced it as the most important text for Pure Land Buddhism in the Meiji period. Although Kiyozawa had already read the Tannishõ when he was a student, it did not become part of his own experience until years later , when he admitted that "my 'Three Great Sutras' are the Tannishõ, Āgamas and The Discourses of Epictetus" and his three great people were Shinran, Śakyamu- ni and Socrates. Nishimura Kengyõ ¡SHMtt, one of the editors of Kiyozawa Manshi Zenshū observes that: What Kiyozawa learned from reading the Āgamas was "Śakyamu- ni's spirit of renunciation" and from Epictetus was the "awareness of one's limited self." If we are to say that Kiyozawa understood the Nembutsu .Í5ÍÁ of the Tannishõ through the Āgamas and The Discourses of Epictetus, it means that he saw renunciation in " namu S&amp;t" and our limited self in " amidabutsu HWÈÍA." One leaves one's family and the world in a single-minded entrusting of namu, and at that same moment, both the family and the world reemerge as the merit-giving activity of Amida Buddha. This conversion is Seishin-shugi, and hence its true meaning is none other than Nembutsu-shugi (Nembutsu-ism).9 According to Kiyozawa, the Āgamas and The Discourses of Epictetus had 9 KMZ (Hozokan edition), vol. 8, p. 620. 28</page><page sequence="24">HASHIMOTO: KIYOZAWA MANSHI &amp; D. T. SUZUKI to be read first, and then the anjin of the Tannishõ could be experienced, and consequently, the Āgamas and The Discourses of Epictetus could also be embraced in the world of the Tannishõ. If this world existed first, the Āgamas and The Discourses of Epictetus would be outside of it, and hence the anjin of the Tannishõ would not be experienced. For Kiyozawa, the path from philosophy to religion, as well as that from thought to experience, was the same as the one from the Skeleton of a Phi- losophy of Religion to "Zaishõ sangeroku," and further still, to Seishin-shugi , which was the shift from "choosing reason over faith when these two con- tradict" as found in the Skeleton of a Philosophy of Religion to "abandoning reason and choosing faith." Kiyozawa' s "Three Great Sutras" were indeed significant in such a conversion. 14. Seishin-shugi The " seishin " that Kiyozawa ultimately reached was the religious attitude "that accepts the Infinite," and such Seishin-shugi was "religious conviction." Kiyozawa produced three works entitled "Seishin-shugi." The first one was an article (no. 1) and the other two were lectures (no. 2 &amp; no. 3). They were all rough drafts, but surely present Seishin-shugi from the standpoint of the Āgama sutras, The Discourses of Epictetus , and the Tannishõ. The first emphasizes "the establishment of self;" the second, "subjectivism;" and the third, "faith in Other Power." If I were to put its essence into just a few words, I should quote Kiyozawa, himself, "the way Seishin sits," i.e., to maintain anjin , is what religion is all about. The fact that Seishin-shugi is "religious conviction," means that it is not concerned with "academic theories," i.e., "scientific and philosophical stud- ies," and is distinguished from "common morality." Namely, "religion pro- vides a different world besides that of social benefits and ethical behavior." Such clear duality existed in Kiyozawa' s mind. It also means that Seishin-shugi needs to include having an unshakable stoic mind that does not waver at anything. Kiyozawa stated: "We simply are to depend on the Absolute Infinity. The matter of life and death is not worth wor- rying about, let alone the following matters: excommunication is acceptable, imprisonment bearable, and slander, exclusion and all kinds of insults are not minded at all. Rather, we shall entirely enjoy what is given by the Absolute Infinity."10 What is required here is the opportunity for "spiritual discipline," as we see in Kiyozawa' s recollection of his "attainment of faith," [II, 10] 10 KMZ, vol. 6, p. 110. 29</page><page sequence="25">THE EASTERN BUDDHIST XXXV, 1 &amp; 2 which has to be "something to be resolved through actual experiment." The essence of the "conviction" of Seishin-shugi is " banbutsu ittai." Kiyozawa states: "Since Seishin-shugi focuses on actions, there is no partic- ular need for academic theory. In order to promote actions, however, it speaks of a single ideal. Such an ideal may be called the idea of banbutsu ittai or the principle of banbutsu dotai (single-body-of-all),"11 which is not however a philosophical theory or principle, but rather, "in Seishin-shugi, we can reach the perspective of banbutsu ittai by "the way Seishin sits." In the Shükyö tetsugaku gaikotsu, the banbutsu ittai theory is seen as a "logical mys- tery," but is now recognized as "conviction" in a subjective "action." Kiyozawa went beyond the Kantian philosophy of dualism in theory and prac- tice with his "Faith in Other Power." What needs to be emphasized here is that "with much introspection and reflection on one's standpoint, the first thing we detect is our ignorance and inability and the fact that we are mediocre people TL^, who commit evil and are born and die." To obtain anjin means to "totally depend on the Great Compassion (dai h i K;!ll) of the Infinite Other Power." There is banbutsu ittai, but the duality of the finite and the Infinite still remains - this mystery is the Great Compassion of the Infinite. At this important juncture, we find repen- tance and faith. " Seishin-shugi ," according to Kiyozawa, "is none other than pragmatism, which develops at the place where the relative enters into the Absolute and the finite meets the Infinite." "At such a place," however, "we speak of the Absolute outside of the relative and the Infinite outside of the finite and above all, what we call satisfaction in our hearts is given by the Absolute Infinity."12 Using Hegelian terminology, Kiyozawa called the ini- tiator of this Great Compassion "the Absolute Infinite" in "Seishin-shugi, no. 1 (January 1901)." In nos. 2 and 3 (July 1901 and June 1902) he called it " tenchi banbutsu or banbutsu ittai (all-things-in-the-universe)" and "Other Power" or "Tathāgata" respectively. In his last piece of writing right before his death, entitled "Waga shinnen (My Faith)," he mostly called it "Tathāgata." As Soga Ryõjin suggests, this shifting of the terms may be understood as the deepening of Kiyozawa's "faith." This Tathāgata was "the Tathāgata for oneself" and "Tathāgata for one's convictions." In Kiyozawa's own words, it was "the Tathāgata that I cannot help but trust." His "faith" was built on the logic of duality; his notion of " seishin " was 11 KMZ, vol. 6, p. 298. 12 Ibid., p. 73. 30</page><page sequence="26">HASHIMOTO: KIYOZAWA MANSHI &amp; D. T. SUZUKI mediated by Western philosophy, but never equated with either "the objec- tive Spirit" or "the Absolute Spirit" of the Hegelian kind- it was "subjective Spirit" through and through. Nishitani Keiji called it the "humanis- tic Spirit."13 It was "seis hin" of a "religious human being." While Kiyozawa spoke of Seishin-shugi, he never said that the Tathāgata was Seishin, and pre- cisely because of this duality that "Tathāgata" [is not Seishin but] exists in Seishin , his Other Power faith can be, as dictated by "Tathāgata," the driving force in social critique and structural reform. Yoshida Kyüichi (to whom this paper is greatly indebted), who has written the only detailed biog- raphy of Kiyozawa to date, calls our attention to the article, "Seishin shugi undo no genkai fiWiHiSÄjCDßgf?- (The Limits of the Seishin-shugi Movement)," and comments that "Kiyozawa' s spiritual awakening was at odds with the ordinary mass of people, whose wishes were not necessarily part of his faith." The task of bridging this gap, however, should belong to the Pure Land followers in today's modernized society rather than to Kiyozawa. The last line of his diary reads: "Be a slave to the Tathāgata and not to any other." 15. Death On November 5th, 1903, Kiyozawa made a prediction to one of his students, Chikazumi Jõkan, as follows: "Everything has collapsed this year - the school, my wife and children, and now I will collapse." After returning to Saihõ-ji, and while coughing up blood, Kiyozawa finished writing "Shôkyõteki dõtoku (zokutai) to futsū dõtoku to no kõshõ (ÍSWÜ ¿ÍHiüféii (Negotiating Religious Morality and Ordinary Morality)," and "Waga shinnen." The latter was his final written piece completed a week before his death. After coughing up a large amount of blood on the 3rd and 4th of June, another student, Harako Hironobu iL, asked him: "Teacher, you won't make it this time. Do you have anything you want to say?" "There is nothing to say," Kiyozawa replied, and at 1 :00 a.m. on the 6th, "finally took his last breath while smiling wryly." His last nom de plume was " Himpū žř fi (Shore Breeze)." He wrote to Akegarasu Haya in Tokyo on June 1 st as fol- lows: "The nom de plume, Himpū, is my recent acquisition and came from the idea that Õhama is a windy place, which now seems so appropriate for a half-dead ghost like myself. I also find it amusing that this name has synthe- 13 Nishitani 1990. 31</page><page sequence="27">THE EASTERN BUDDHIST XXXV, 1 &amp; 2 sized all of my previous nom de plumes, namely Kenpõ (while residing in Nagoya), Gaikotsu (in Kyoto), Sekisui 5 A (in Maiko Hť), and Rõsen li M (in Tokyo). With my new name, I will vanish into thin air." This was the first and last humorous comment from Kiyozawa. III. Suzuki Daisetz - Man of Reisei 1 . Nom de plume, "Daisetz" It is easy to understand how Kiyozawa Manshi changed his nom de plume from Kenpõ, Gaikotsu, Sekisui, Rõsen and eventually to Himpū, in order to express different periods of his state of mind or how he defined himself. However, when it comes to the "Daisetz Ałffi" of Suzuki Teitarõ fí5Aíl AĒ[i, "the Buddhist scholar who dominated an entire intellectual period" and rep- resented modern Zen, people may feel lost as to how to make sense of his state of mind or self-definition. "Daisetz" is said to come from a passage in the Hekiganroku Hüö: "Great skillfulness ( daigyõ A 15) is similar to unskill- fulness (setsu lítí)," a name which Suzuki kept for his entire life. This passage is quite different from "the wisest resembles the unwise," which means to define and evaluate others. First, it has to be an expression of self-confidence when one evaluates oneself as "the most skillful." At the same time, it also has to be an expression of frustration when one sees oneself as "the unskill- ful." What of this frustration? Suzuki, who had had his kenshõ experience at the age of 25 while practicing zazen at Engaku-ji H tt • r in Kamakura, becom- ing "the most skillful," must have experienced the frustration of being "unskillful" while trying to describe his kenshõ - the realization of the "true nature" of human existence - in "language." It was the frustration of a per- son who had decided to devote his lifetime to trying to explain, through rel- ative language, "special transmission outside the scriptures ( kyõge betsuden "not relying on words and letters (futyü monji TÄATA" "direct- ly pointing to a person's mind (jikishi ninshin ūtffA'LO," and "attaining Buddhahood by perceiving one's nature {kenshõ jõbutsu ÄttfiSc IA)," all of which belong to the absolute world beyond "words." The life of Suzuki was that of a tireless writer who had tried to make Zen and Buddhist thought under- standable to modern readers. 2. Suzuki Daisetz, the Writer However, no one dares call Suzuki, the world-renowned torch-bearer of Zen, "unskillful." All the credit for introducing Zen abroad and creating today's Zen popularity in the West - be it substantial or not - goes to Suzuki alone. 32</page><page sequence="28">HASHIMOTO: KIYOZAWA MANSHI &amp; D. T. SUZUKI The enjoyable nature and skillfulness of his writings in Japanese are obvious just by reading Nihonteki reisei BłWStt (Japanese Spirituality) published in 1944. Many of his English works have also been praised, for instance by Masutani Fumio tttířXtt describing them as, "with invigorating tension and refreshing feeling." One day, Suzuki supposedly told Masutani the following: In Awakening of Faith ÉÊÍHiíra by Memyõ Sil (Ašvaghosa), there is a story about taking out a wedge by another wedge. By driving a wedge, you formed a crack, but that wedge is in, right? When you want to take out that wedge, you need to drive in another, then another and again another one. In this way, wedges are needed infinitely. Language is replaced by language. That is the human lim- itation, always using and destroying language repeatedly. In rigor- ous Zen practice, you just thunder out or say something incomprehensible. That is where one must reach at the very end. Can we now understand Suzuki's frustration? His nom de plume, "Daisetz," must have been the expression of such frustration. Although we should not be caught up too much in the matter of nom de plumes, I still find it significant that he chose "great unskillfulness" rather than "great fool," "great fake" or "great evil." Kiyozawa's Buddhism sought either truth or fal- sity, as well as good or evil, while Suzuki's, on the other hand, seems to rep- resent a religiousness that valued skillfulness and aesthetic values. How skillfully can one express the state of Zen, which is grasped by aesthetic intu- ition, beyond language? 3. The Magnitude of Daisetz As mentioned earlier, for myself, Suzuki is like a distant relative of promi- nent standing. His work includes more than eighty books in Japanese and close to thirty volumes in English, several of which have also been translat- ed into German and French. He played a magnificent role as an illuminator of Buddhist thought, especially Zen, inside and outside Japan. His role, in fact, was not limited to just being that, but also an elucidator and excavator of Buddhism itself. His most popular masterpiece may be Zen Buddhism and its Influence on Japanese Culture published in 1938. Also significant are his studies of the Lankāvatāra Sūtra and the Gandavyüha Sūtra in Indian Bud- dhism, the history of Chinese Buddhism (especially Bodhidharma ÜH), and the history of Japanese Buddhism (especially Zen and Pure Land Buddhist 33</page><page sequence="29">THE EASTERN BUDDHIST XXXV, 1 &amp; 2 thought), with which Suzuki brought modern intellectuals close to their under- standing. Especially, in the area of Zen, he unearthed "Unborn Zen (fushõ - zen of the Zen monk Bankei MS, who had been completely buried in the history of Japanese Zen Buddhism. Along with those of Dēgen Mī n, Hakuin ÖB8, Suzuki counted Bankei 's Zen as one of three types of Zen thought in Japan. At the same time, Suzuki also studied Pure Land doctrine, unraveling the ultimate form of popular Japanese religious experience for modern intellectuals and stunning them with a series of provocative studies on the " myõkõnin ." These two specific accomplishments are most remark- able for the history of Japanese ideas. Furthermore, in Mushin to iukoto ¿ U "3 " ¿ (On 'No-minď ) published in 1940 and Jõdo-kei shisõ-ron S S Ira (Studies in Pure Land Thought), published in 1942, Suzuki clarified the ultimate common ground between Zen and Pure Land Buddhist thought and advanced what he would later call the concept of "Japanese Spirituality." That concept, from this editor's standpoint, is Suzuki's greatest achievement and that is why we have included Nihonteki reisei as his representative work in this volume [of Nihon no meicho ]. The breadth of Suzuki as a man, however, seems to have derived not from such external accomplishments but rather from the depth of his own "real- ization." Although it sounds very strange to say that breadth comes from depth, it seems appropriate for Suzuki. Furuta Shõkin ïffl&amp;SD;, one of his stu- dents, states that what is most remarkable about Suzuki was "the depth of his Zen experience." 14 While Kiyozawa went through changes and developments in his ideas during his short life of forty-one years, Suzuki underwent none in his fundamental thinking during his long life of ninety-six years. Moreover, the latter' s monistic view of Nihonteki reisei seems to overwhelm Kiyozawa' s dualistic Seishin-shugi at times. 4. Nihonteki reisei The Zen experience that Suzuki had maintained since his earlier age was ulti- mately termed " Nihonteki reisei ." Its origin, history and details were sys- tematically articulated in his essay Nihonteki reisei. In the introduction to its new postwar edition published in 1948, he commented that he "had well before established the opinion" that there was such a thing [as Nihonteki rei- sei ]. During World War II, Suzuki strongly felt that nationalism, totalitarian- ism and State Shinto were not "what our country should stand on in the future" 14 Furuta 1961. 34</page><page sequence="30">HASHIMOTO: KIYOZAWA MANSHI &amp; D. T. SUZUKI and decided to dig further into the inner life of the Japanese "to unearth what was buried until now." According to him " Nihonteki reisei" was supposed- ly a universal reality in its origin, but it had surfaced through consciousness "in its purest form" in the Pure Land and Zen Buddhism of the Kamakura period. "The Pure Land experience is manifested on the affective or emo- tional side of Japanese spirituality, while its intellectual part appears in the transformation into Zen of Japanese life." The Pure Land Buddhist myõkõnin "Saichi always employed Namu Amidabutsu with absolute independence" and this "is his Person and one per- son 'for the sake of this one individual person, Shinran;' at the same time, he is also Rinzai Zen's true man of no title MiioMA and 'the only one in all the universe.'" While reisei means religious (Buddhist) consciousness, Suzuki stressed its specific characteristics such as earthwardness, non-literality, straightforwardness, concrete truthfulness and immediate life facticity. Especially important was its two-in-oneness where, according to Mutai Risaku "the Mother of Life, Great Compassion's embrace, burning desire, and the certainty of hell all exist together." According to Suzuki, "the logic of the Earth," where such Nihonteki reisei manifests itself, is the same as "the logic of the non-duality in the wisdom" in Zen and "the faith of the Earth" becomes the Namu Amidabutsu of the Shin Buddhist denomination. Whether or not "the logic of the Earth" and "the faith of the Earth" are the same, still remains an important question for Japanese religion, but Suzuki was certainly the great pioneer, who tried to ultimately unify various types of Japanese religious experience and overcome "sectarianism" within the his- tory of Japanese Buddhism. Suzuki was such a "man of Spirituality." 5. Reisei and Seishin Suzuki distinguishes his idea of "reisei" from that of "seishin" which can be considered a Western concept. " Seishin always contains dualism within itself," but reisei "sees that the two are, after all, not two but one and the one is, as it is, two." It is said that "spirituality is the operation latent in the depths of seishin', when it awakens, the duality within seishin dissolves. It can sense, think, will and act in this true form." Kiyozawa's dualistic seishin seems to be encompassed by Suzuki's monistic reisei. As articulated by Suzuki in Nihonteki reisei, "the heart of Pure Land thought lies in the Nembutsu ikiU and not in attaining birth in the Pure Land." "I am rather inclined to think of õjõ ÍT/ti as a kind of symbol... What is impor- tant is Nembutsu itself; single-minded Nembutsu alone is important. 35</page><page sequence="31">THE EASTERN BUDDHIST XXXV, 1 &amp; 2 Tentatively, we think that õjõ lies beyond the denial of the present world, but in Namu Amidabutsu , õjõ and the denial are really unified." If it were other- wise, it would not be true that "the relation between this world and the Pure Land is mutually reflective, mirror-imaged, continuous of discontinuity, and thus "õcho (side-wise leap)."15 However, in this Pure Land logic of sokuhi presented by Suzuki, does the Pure Land really exist or not? If it does, its reality will not be monistic. In Kiyozawa's Pure Land Buddhism, "we believe in Shintõ and Buddhist deities not because these exist, but rather, that they exist for us. Moreover, we believe in hell and the Pure Land not because hell and the Pure Land exist. When we believe in them, both exist for us" ("religion is subjective reality"). Thus, "there is no point in arguing whether hell and the Pure Land exist or the spirit perishes or not." Furthermore, for Kiyozawa, we see an intellectual restraint making him say that "if religion is subjective reality, it is not fair to ask whether the facts of religion and faith are objectively accurate or not." Such restraint represents what Kiyozawa meant by seishin. For Suzuki's reisei, does the Pure Land exist? When he states shaba (this suffering world) is the Pure Land {shaba soku jõdo SsüiP #±), what kind of logic is he implying? Will "the logic of the Earth" and "the faith of the Earth" necessarily be one or not? Which path shall we take - choosing "the logic of the Earth" through constructing the logic of Nihonteki reisei like Suzuki (i.e., drawing Pure Land Buddhism toward Zen and unify- ing them) or choosing "the faith of the Earth," by giving up the logic and depending on the "mystery" like Kiyozawa? As long as religion is based on the absolute reality of each individual, the choice must be up to one's reli- gious experience. In any case, it seems that we are witnessing two types of modern Japanese Buddhism in Kiyozawa's " seishin " and Suzuki's " reisei ." IV. Remaining Issues 1 . Kiyozawa, Suzuki and Nishida Kitarõ Although we have been looking at Kiyozawa Manshi and Suzuki Daisetz as representatives of modern Japanese Buddhist thinkers, it is generally accept- ed that Nishida Kitarõ was the first person in modern Japan to formulate a "philosophy" based on the Buddhist world- view. It is often said that if Japan were to export an original philosophy overseas, it would be called "Nishida Philosophy," though both Kiyozawa and Suzuki had a great influence upon him. 15 Suzuki 1968. 36</page><page sequence="32">HASHIMOTO: KIYOZAWA MANSHI &amp; D. T. SUZUKI Nishitani Keiji, Nishida's student, was the first to pay attention to Kiyozawa's influence on Nishida's thought. When Nishitani was about to teach at Otani University, Nishida reminded him that it was the university where Kiyozawa had once taught. In Nishida's diary, there are four references to Kiyozawa. On January 14, 1903, it says "I read and was impressed by Kiyozawa's piece in Seishinkai." On July 17, 1904, immediately after Kiyozawa's death, it reads, "I visited Inaba at Jõkõ-in StĚK around 6:00 p.m. and talked about Kiyozawa." On May 9, 1906, it states, "I read Kiyozawa's Shinkõ zadan if AMIS (Talk about Faith)," and finally on August 3, 1908, it reads, "I wrote an article called 'Chi to ai Ä (Knowledge and Love)' for Seishinkai.'''' Could it be Kiyozawa's "Meimonsha no an'i (Consolation of the Lost and Agonized)" or "Hotoke niyoru yûki ii, t' =t -SU (Encouraged by the Buddha)" that Nishida read in Seishinkai in 1903? After Kiyozawa's death, Nishida visited Kõkõdõ in Tokyo, where he used to attend the reading group of Kiyozawa's last written piece, "Waga shinnen," while teaching at the Fourth Imperial School. His article, "Chi to ai" men- tioned in his diary entry from 1 908, became the last chapter of Zen no kenkyü. There we read, "Although science and morality receive the Light of this Other Power of each individual phenomenon, religion directly touches the Absolute, the Infinite Buddha on the whole universe. And knowing this Absolute, Infinite Buddha or God becomes possible by merely loving it." As Shiba Ryõtarõ pointed out, the close resemblance to Kiyozawa's writing, not only in terms of content but also in expression, is noticeable in this sentence. When regarding Kiyozawa as a philosopher, what are the similarities and differences between Kiyozawa's and Nishida's metaphysics? Earlier I men- tioned that Kiyozawa's Buddhist reconstruction through Hegelian dialectics had served as a bridge for Nishida's "self-identity of absolute contradicto- ries," which was the basis for "the logic of place" and "the dialectic of noth- ingness," as both philosophers formulated their metaphysics (philosophy of religion) through the critical adoption of such dialectics. Concerning Hegel's thesis, antithesis and synthesis, Kiyozawa commented as follows: "Between thesis and antithesis, there must a bridge which connects both sides. Without both the opposite and common features, there won't be any philosophy nor any change in things. When we seek the development in philosophy or change in things, the common element, standing between thesis and antithesis, becomes most important." Here, Kiyozawa was suggesting that the antithe- sis is not "contradiction" of the thesis, but its "opposite" and, as Hegel, him- self, stated, its "limited negation," thus stressing that these must be 37</page><page sequence="33">THE EASTERN BUDDHIST XXXV, 1 &amp; 2 "self-limitation" of "the Universal" as Nishida later articulated. Therefore, ultimately, while Kiyozawa's dialectic of Master, Guest and Meeting tries to remain as the Universal at the bottom of the "opposite," Nishida' s "dialectic of absolute nothingness" sought the Universal at the bottom of the "contra- diction." Here, their difference may be understood as that between Pure Land Buddhism and Zen. Ironically, by regarding "being" as the basis of both, the dualism of this world and the other stands, and denying it with "nothing," monism prevails. After all, however, the religious logic is still paradoxical. Suzuki's influence on Nishida, his best lifetime friend, was undeniable. We can even reconsider whether the latter' s idea of the "self-identity of absolute contradictories" was his own or a collaboration between both of them. Suzuki claimed that the logic of the illiterate myõkõnins ' faith was none other than "the self-identity of absolute contradictories" and playfully teased Nishida by saying that "a common, old woman can readily speak of what a philoso- pher has obtained after a lifetime of extracting all his ideas."16 In his final years, he frequently quoted Suzuki and even appeared to have Suzuki as the basis of his arguments. The fundamental experience embedded in their think- ing was the same; "the dialectic of nothingness" is no different from "the logic of sokuhi." If we regard Nishida as a philosopher and Suzuki as a reli- gious person, the former's life's work was to "philosophically" articulate the same milieu that Suzuki described "rhetorically." Ueyama Shunpei _hiijłpp, the editor of Nishida Kitarõ in Nihon no meicho, made the final evaluation of his philosophy as follows: "The originality of Nishida's thought lies at the level of germination and not that of the finished product; it merely opened the door for a new type of philosophy." Similarly, we should also say that Suzuki's work merely opened the door for a new type of religion, and the issues raised for the former should also be raised for the latter as well. 2. Some Issues for Modem Japanese Buddhism Japanese Buddhism in the past 100 years since the Meiji period has made var- ious efforts in so-called modernization through philological studies and mod- em translations of the Buddhist scriptures, theorization and systematization of its thought, the reform of religious organizations, and confrontation with modem ideas. In this "Introduction," we have neglected to place Kiyozawa and Suzuki in such a historical context within modem Japanese Buddhism. For example, Kiyozawa's Seishin-shugi Movement should be contrasted with 16 Suzuki 1976. 38</page><page sequence="34">HASHIMOTO: KIYOZAWA MANSHI &amp; D. T. SUZUKI the New Buddhist Movement of Sakaino Kõyõ iÉSřH#, the No-self Love Movement of Itõ Shõshin , Kyüdö Gakusha of Chikazumi Jõkan Ittõ-en - ofNishida Tenkõ and the Nichirenism S jÜH of Takayama Chogyü SS liiłfT. As Kiyozawa, himself, mentioned in his article, "Bukkyõ no kõki (The Rise of Buddhism)," that there were three periods even within the Buddhist history of the Meiji period. The first was when Buddhists became just like secular people ( haibutsu kishaku fâiUWiM, in the first decade of that period), the second was when, over- whelmed by Christian advancement, Buddhism resisted it with science and philosophy (i.e., the second decade, when Inoue Enryõ and others took ini- tiatives), and the last period was when the Original Vow of Faith was real- ized (the third decade of Meiji and afterwards). If we were to analyze the historical background of Kiyozawa's Seishin-shugi Movement or why "ian- jin (heretics)" like Kiyozawa, Ito and Chikazumi emerged from Higashi Honganji rather than Nishi Honganji, we should have returned to "the heretical incident" of the so-called Sangõ wakuran HHÍŠSL in the Edo peri- od. Furthermore, we should have continued to trace from the Seishin-shugi Movement after Kiyozawa's death to the troubles in the Õtani denomination today. For Suzuki's place in the history of Buddhism, we could have also dis- cussed what Furuta Shõkin meant by "[Suzuki as] a back road walker." While my lack of ability and preparation could certainly be blamed for all these shortcomings, it is also true that I am most interested in the thoughts of Kiyozawa and Suzuki. Now, while realizing that these two are unsurpassable, I wish to present them with questions concerning today's Buddhism, namely, the problem of Buddhism and the state. In its teachings, the state has originally been part of the "human" and not of "nature." Primitive Buddhism held the "theory of state contract" and often regarded the king and thief in the same light, telling people to stay away from both.17 For Indian Buddhists, Buddhism meant "to construct an ideal society ( sańgha ) with its own spiritual connections, sepa- rating itself from the sovereignty of kings." However, for most Japanese Buddhists who had already accepted Buddhism as a state religion in the Nara period, they rejected such an idea as "Theravādin." They conceived of the realization of the Buddhist ideal with state power as "Mahãyãnist" in nature and supported its scriptures, which advocated such a view. However, the lead- ers of new Buddhism in the Kamakura period, such as Hõnen, Dõgen and 17 Nakamura 1989. 39</page><page sequence="35">THE EASTERN BUDDHIST XXXV, 1 &amp; 2 Shinran, did not positively uphold the view that affirms the state. Rather, their Buddhism criticized or denied the state itself (Nichiren's nationalistic Buddhism was their shadow image). We can detect that both Kiyozawa and Suzuki saw that Buddhism should not depend on state power. If that's the case though, be it dualism or monism, shouldn't their philosophies have clearly included ways to criticize the state and challenge the status quo? I believe that it would be a difficult though pos- sible "philosophical" endeavor, but with this, we can say that Buddhism stood at a new "starting line" in Kiyozawa and Suzuki.
