Whoever dares to laugh is punished by the terrible goddess Coatlicue, whom I have accidentally kicked in the ribs. Sergei Eisenstein1 I. Introduction In "Latin America, Native America, and the Politics of Culture" Clem- ency Coggins notes that it was surprisingly not until the nineteenth century that Pre-Colombian Art was essentially re-discovered and re- articulated in order to construct visual and textual discourses of the incipient Mexican Nation (97-1 13) . The idea of recovering knowledge from reading the text inscribed in bodies of stone drove explorations and expeditions to uncover ruins in the Mexican territory. The discov- ery of Mexican pre- and post-Conquest Codices (such as the Florentine Codex), material objects (such as the massive Aztec stone sculpture of Coatlicue) and the creation of an Aztec archive, thus coincided with projects of Latin American Nation formation and the creation of discrete academic disciplines such as literature, archeology, and medicine. In fashioning an idea of Mexico, many Mexican and Euro- pean intellectuals set about to recover and re-write the Aztec past as unique and representative of the Nation. 1 This playful quote was taken from the Russian Filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein while making his film Viva Mexico in the 1930s.

Revi- llagigedo had Coatlicue transferred to the University to be studied, where the professors (of the Orden de Santo Domingo) buried her under the patio of the university, as they did not want Mexican youth to be exposed to such a horrible sight. The sculpture of Coatlicue was indeed read, however through European aesthetics. Her mutilated body was read as an object of curiosity and horror instead of as an abstract sculpture that narrated through its body the foundation of the Aztec empire. Interest in preserving Mexico's archeological past had reached its climax under the government of Porfirio Diaz, in his desire to celebrate Mexico's 1910 Independence centennial. By 1867 president Benito Juarez had established a social order to enable future projects of Nation formation. Disciple of a positivistic philosophy, Benito Juarez engaged in educational reform and helped establish various disciplines in the social and natural sciences. One strategy was to create educational centers to form a sense of Mexican National identity. Important to our interest in Coatlicue, the Gallery of Monoliths was opened on September 16, 1887 (to commemorate Mexican Independence day). This gallery was created to foment an interest in the pre-Hispanic past and was located in the front of the National museum patio to welcome all visitors. The majority of pieces exhibited were Aztec. The colossal statue of Coatlicue (circa 1454-1506) along with the Sun Calendar was situated at the entrance of the hall. Today, these two impressive Aztec sculptural pieces are located in prominent places in the Aztec {Mexico) gallery of the Museo Nacional de Antropología as visual narra- tives representative of the Mexican Nation. Standing today in the Museo Nacional de Antropología, the monumental statue of Coatlicue astonishes observers by her sheer size (see fig. 1). One observer might be amazed at the statue's sculptural craftsman- ship, while another might be repulsed at the violent nature of the dismembered hands, hearts, snakes, and skull that configure her body. Through her body, its fractures, mutilations, earthly and cosmic con- nections, Coatlicue symbolizes and narrates the violent birth of the Aztecs. It is surprising that the larger than life sculpture of Coatlicue, previously reburied three times (the sculpture was viewed as estheti- cally unpleasing and dangerous), began to occupy a prominent place in Mexico's national and visual discourse.</page><page sequence="3">MLN 261 Figure 1.

Beauty in the Eye of the Beholder: Reading Ruins The first work to perform a detailed interpretation of the sculpture of the goddess Coatlicue can perhaps be attributed to the Mexican Creole, Antonio de León y Gama's Descripción histórica y cronológica de las dos Piedras (1792), that studied this Aztec sculpture as a system of ideas, i.e. that it could be read as a text: Con las pinturas que tengo en mi poder . . . me fue fácil comprender luego lo que significaban ... las figuras gravadas . . . que se hallan tan confusas, dispersas y truncadas en los escritos de los propios Indios . . . restan aun algunas de sus figuras, cuyos jeroglíficos envolvían en si muchas alegóricas significaciones, por interpretar enteramente. (3) De León y Gama's idea that other materials beyond the alphabetic word could be "read" was revolutionary.2 Without access to the "pintu- ras" found in the "escritos de los propios Indios" (i.e. Aztec Códices), he could not have deciphered the meaning behind the iconography of Coatlicue. Gama believed that Aztec "writing" understood as hiero- glyphs, "envolvían en si muchas alegóricas significaciones" (3). Perhaps de León y Gama was inspired by the work of the Mexican Jesuit, Fran- cisco Antonio Clavijero (who Gama cited in his bibliography). In Historia Antigua de México (1780)3 Clavijero devoted a section on the question of indigenous "writing." Clavijero wrote in response to attacks by Buffon and de Paw who believed (like the initial missionaries who set foot in Mexico) that the native Mexicans had no civilization or history because of their lack of alphabetic writing. Clavijero was one of the first scholars to explain that whether the native Mexicans had writing or not depended on the definition used. If writing was defined as "cualquiera suerte de palabras con la diferente combinación de algunos caracteres" then "Ninguna nación de América conocía el arte de escribir" (390). If on the other hand, writing was defined as "representar y dar a entender cualquiera cosa a los ausentes y a la posteridad con figuras jeroglíficas y caracteres," then "es cierto que el tal arte era conocido y tenia grande uso entre los mexicanos" (390). While Clavijero viewed Aztec material culture as an expression of writing, and hence civilization, he still had to account for the "bar- baric" sacrificial practices of the Aztecs. Viewing his Historia Antigua 2 See Hill-Boone and Mignolo. 3Jesuit Francisco Javier Clavijero first published his book in Bolonia (1780) while in exile in Italy. It was first translated from Italian to Spanish in Mexico (1853).

Unlike pre-Conquest Aztec Códices, the bodies in this image are three-dimensional, contain Figure 2.

The male Aztecs performing the heart extraction are feminized and appear to have white European bodies. While the image depicts the violent act of sacrifice, it nonetheless appears to represent an idyllic scene. The bodies of the "barbaric" Aztecs have artistically been translated into effeminate "noble savages." III. Humboldt and Bullock: The "Beauty" of Horror in Coatlicue In 1803, Alexander Von Humboldt, the Prussian scientist arrived at the port of Acapulco from his travels in South America. Humboldt resided in Mexico for about a year, during which time he carried out scientific studies including geology, fauna and flora, mineralogy, and astronomy. Remnants of the pre-Hispanic past were not overlooked. His observations on the pre-Hispanic past were recorded primarily in his Vues de cordillèrs et monuments des peoples indigenes de Vamérique (1810), where he wrote about the monuments, Codices, and cities of ancient Mexico. As a man of the Enlightment and pioneer of modern scientific methods, his vision of Mesoamerican artifacts would become entrenched in his scientific gaze and be valued for their historical importance.5 Humboldt's eye, however, was not trained to deal with the aesthetics of a people whose sculptural and pictorial manifestations of consciousness he classified sometimes as barbaric. Nonetheless, Humboldt was one of the first to pay attention to Mexican Codices. He commissioned copies to be made from de León y Gama's drawings and included them in his Vues de cordillèrs (see fig. 3 and fig 4) .6 Let us recall that during the eighteenth century Spain became the target of attack from its European enemies who tried to propagate the "black legend" in representations of Spain's conquest of America. French thinkers espoused certain ideas to express how "Americans" could not produce art. Art in Eurocentric terms was viewed as the expression of civilized people. Basing themselves on the work of Buffon, de Paw, Kant, and Hegel, Spain's enemies tried to prove that Spaniards and criollos living in America were under the corrupting and 'See Deborah Poole, Vision, Race and Modernity, and Mary Louise Pratt, Imperial Eyes, for descriptions of the scientific visual appara tus/ gaze. 6 Antonio de León y Gama (1735-1802) was the Mexican Humanist Creole as- tronomer who first documented Aztec archaeology. His description of the discovery of Coatlicue and the Sun Calendar in his Descripción Histórica (1790) aimed to highlight the scientific and artistic achievements of the Aztecs as part of the project of Mexican Nation formation.</page><page sequence="7">MLN 265 Figure 3.

Mexican intellectuals, Clavijero with his Historia Antigua de México (1780), and de León y Gama with Descripción histórica (1792) also sought to defend the American man.8 In these works Clavijero and de León y Gama defended the American man and his singularity by resorting to the pre-Hispanic past. For these scholars, the material remnants of the pre-Hispanic past were evidence of their intellectual achievements and artistic production. Humboldt's opinion of the pre-Hispanic people or the material objects that survived the Conquest can be summed up in his apprecia- tion of the sculpture of Coatlicue (briefly disinterred for him in 1803) .9 In Vues de cordillèrs Humboldt expressed his disgust for the "incorrect and repugnant" aesthetic forms that the Aztecs engaged "sancionadas por un culto sanguinario . . . parecen haber contribuido singularmente a perpetuar la barbarie en las artes y el gusto de las formas incorrectas y horrorosas . . ." ( Vues de cordillèrs 224) . What Humboldt appears to tell us is that the degree of "civility" of a society translates into its artistic and cultural manifestations. Thus, the sculptural body of Coatlicue becomes the material evidence that the Aztecs were a barbaric nation. What is at stake is not the craftsmanship of this impressive sculpture as each of its human and non-human parts is skillfully and painstak- ingly carved in stone. The Aztecs become barbaric because of their "incorrect" esthetics. For Humboldt, Coatlicue 's body performs an "incorrect" esthetics because it does not present a mimetic or natu- ralist representation of the female human body. By incorporating human and non-human parts what is created is a monstrous body. 7 See Jorge Cañizares-Esguerra for an overview of European and Creole debates concerning the decadence/corruption of the New World man. 8 Nahuatlato (speaker of Náhuatl) and avid reader of Descartes and Newton, Francisco Javier Clavijero (1731-1787) was a Jesuit priest and scholar who was born in Mexico. With the expulsion of the Jesuits by Charles III in 1767, he ended up in Italy. While abroad he wrote the ten volume La Historia Antigua de Mexico ( 1 780-81 ) where he aimed to contradict anti-Spanish scholars who perpetuated the "black legend" and who rep- resented native Mexicans as a barbaric and ignorant people. Like the Jesuit polymath Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora (1645-1700), before him, Clavijero had an interest in studying the pre-Hispanic past though material culture such as Códices. 9 "Yo no habría sido lo suficientemente afortunado como para poderlo examinar, si el Obispo de Monterrey, don Feliciano Marín, que pasaba por México para retornar a su diócesis, no hubiera inducido al rector de la universidad, a mis súplicas, a hacerlo desenterrar" (Humboldt, Vues de Cordillèrs 227).</page><page sequence="9">MLN 267 For Humboldt, a non-naturalistic monstrous body can only translate into "formas incorrectas y horrorosas." While Humboldt expressed his dislike for pre-Conquest "incorrect" esthetic form, he nonetheless appreciated its craftsmanship. Humboldt thought critically about the intellectual place of pre-Hispanic material objects he had access to. For our purposes it is interesting to note how he, like others before and after him, have misunderstood Aztec esthetics when he wrote that they possessed "una completa ignorancia de las proporciones del cuerpo humano" (223). 1() This reveals that Humboldt, using his Eurocentric esthetic lens, could not understand Aztec ideology and representation of the human body through material culture. While European esthetics of the time favored mimetic representation of the human body in art with correct proportions and so forth (by associat- ing a geometrically accurate representation as "beautiful") , the Aztecs conceived of and represented the human body abstractly. That is, the body, like a poem, was encrypted in an abstract fashion: jam-packed with strategically and spatially organized symbolic components, col- ors, and forms to convey a particular story. In fact, despite appearing disproportioned and two-dimensional, the human bodies deployed in Aztec Codices and material culture are anatomically proportioned. What perhaps might have created the illusion of disproportion, as noted before, was the fusion of human and non-human forms or the lack of three-dimensional perspective performed in Aztec Codices. The Aztecs instead represented important human and non-human figures in their Codices as larger in size relative to other human or non-human figures on the page. For example, important gods or figures could be twice the size of other human bodies or architectural structures depicted on the page. Humboldt, though, was perceptive to note that the Aztec representa- tion of the human body was "una búsqueda de verdad minuciosa en los detalles accesorios" and that, although it was composed of "partes monstruosas," these were "conforme a ideas sistemáticas" (223-24). This indicates Humboldt appeared to appreciate a method to Aztec "madness." In fact, Humboldt goes on to say that these forms are "lo contrario del vicio de la imitación" (225). Humboldt's text exhibits a tension: while on the one hand Coatlicue is "monstrous" because she is not mimetic to human form, on the other hand Humboldt says she represents the opposite to the vice of imitation. What this might reveal is that Humboldt on some level might have acknowledged her 10 All translations provided from Spanish to English are mine.</page><page sequence="10">268 ANN DELEON singularity beyond his esthetic tastes. By openly recognizing an alterna- tive esthetic system of representation the Eurocentric lens would be challenged as sole interpreter for esthetic norms. Humboldt recog- nizes that there is an intricate and organized system at play, but one that he cannot penetrate. As Humboldt cannot decipher her codified system Coatlicue becomes "forms" and not a unified whole (form). This reading of Coatlicue in parts (as a dismembered body) becomes readily apparent through Humboldt's deployment of her body in the two-dimensional space of the page (see fig. 4). Like anatomical draw- ings of animal specimens, the full dimensionality of Coatlicue can only be captured on the two-dimensional page through dismemberment to reveal her front, back, side, top, and bottom all at once. While a human being could not visually capture all the parts of a three-dimensional sculpture through plain sight, the dismemberment of the (already dismembered) body allows the viewer to mentally reconfigure the pieces and view Coatlicue as a "whole" by piecing together multiple perspectives. In doing this, Humboldt acknowledges Coatlicue as a "body" and is even willing to entertain (or reconstruct) the positions where the head, arms, feet, and back should be, if Coatlicue were indeed a human being. Like the multiple human figures deployed in the Aztec Codices, the human form in Aztec sculpture (as in the case of Coatlicue) revealed its codified meaning through the symbolic relationship of its different parts (human or non-human). Were it not for Coatlicue's hanging breasts, it would have been hard for Humboldt to see a woman and goddess in Coatlicue as "El carácter de la figura humana desaparece bajo el peso de las vestimentas" (224) . While Humboldt saw the human figure disappear in the clothes, for the Aztecs, clothes represented an extension of the body which documented sex, age, profession, and socio-economic status (much as it does today and also has in Europe at all times). This type of representation is common among many past and present cultures. Humboldt appears to explain the incoherent components that constitute Coatlicue as being a costume or mask, as these would hide the human form underneath. Although Coatlicue was not wearing a costume, we cannot condemn Humboldt for trying to get under Coatlicue's skin, i.e. at the mimetic human body (the recognized form). How could Humboldt have known that for the Aztecs, clothes (and even the wearing of a human skin) represented an extension of the body and self? In fact, linguistically both body parts and clothes (as well as bloodline) are inherently possessed (i.e. considered an intrinsic part of one's being) in Náhuatl. To make the</page><page sequence="11">MLN 269 system even more complicated, the Aztecs mapped spatial relations through body parts.11 Thus for the Aztecs the body (human and non- human) acted as the axis mundi and mapped the cosmos. Further analysis of Humboldt's text on Coatlicue and accompanying image (both influenced by and copied from de León y Gama's original drawing of the sculpture) in Gama's Descripción Histórica (1792) reveal the legacy that nineteenth-century scholarship has had on interpret- ing Aztec art and culture as "barbaric," "bloody" and "monstrous."12 Humboldt writes: La muerte se representa por todas partes bajo los símbolos más horrorosos: está grabada en cada piedra, se la encuentra en cada página de sus libros; sus monumentos religiosos no tienen otro objeto que reproducir el terror y el espanto . . . Posiblemente estas figuras monstruosas no representan otra cosa que máscaras, pues entre los mexicanos se acostumbraba enmascarar a los ído- los ... El señor Gama ... ha establecido como una cosa bastante probable, que este ídolo [fig. 3] representa al dios de la guerra, Huitzilopochtli ... y a su mujer [fig. 1], llamada Teoyamiqui (de miqui, morir y teoyao, guerra divina). (225-26) In Humboldt's analysis of the impressive three-dimensional sculp- ture, as de León y Gama before him, Humboldt read Coatlicue's body as a manifestation of death in order to instill in the viewer "terror y espanto." De León y Gama's interpretation of Coatlicue's body as pos- sessing elements of the war god Huitzilopochtli were not completely incorrect (as Coatlicue gave birth to this male war God). As recorded verbally and pictorially in Sahagun's Florentine Codex in Book 1 on the Aztec Gods, Huitzilopochtli 's paraphernalia included the fire-serpent as his weapon (Coatlicue possessed fire-serpents in lieu of arms and hands). While Coatlicue's body contained representations of the "male" god Huitzilopochtli, as she possessed female breasts she could not have been read only as male. Perhaps this is why these scholars decided incorrectly to read her as the death goddess Teoyamiqui, whom they referred to as the wife of Huitzilopochtli. As Humboldt notes, 11 In my linguistic fieldwork (facilitated by John Sullivan) on body parts and spatial concepts in the village of Tepecxitla in Veracruz (Mexico), I found striking similarities between those documented in Sahagun's sixteenth-century Florentine Codex. 12A case in point is the October 24, 2004 review on the Guggenheim Aztec Exhibit by Rochelle Gurstein, "Out of Time: On the Autonomy Of Aesthetic Experience" in The New Republic. Gurstein 's review highlights the act of reading and the anxiety of influence (and aesthetics) that the spectator faces when attending an art exhibit, and is asked to respond to very culturally and aesthetically "alien" objects.</page><page sequence="12">270 ANN DELEON "la muerte se representa por todas partes bajo los símbolos más hor- rorosos: está grabada en cada piedra, se la encuentra en cada página de sus libros." Thus, not only was Coatlicue read as a death goddess because of the skull between her breasts, but also because her body did not constitute a realistic and anatomically faithful representation of a woman. That is, Humboldt saw a dismembered body of hands, hearts, and a skull. The skull is a symbol par excellence for death, and the visible mutilated body parts and organs can only mean a dead body. It is therefore no wonder that when Humboldt looked at the colorful pages of the Aztec "books" or Códices, images that appeared as "monsters" or "skulls" stood out the most. As also noted in the work of Fernando Cervantes, this abstract deployment of the human body by the Aztecs in both sculpture and Códices, and abundant depiction of human skulls, was read by the first wave of missionaries who set foot in Tenochtitlán (present day Mexico City), as the work of the devil. For this reason the religious missionaries destroyed a vast production of native material objects. For the religious men, these demonic objects posed a real threat to the native's spiritual salvation, and were evidence of the devil's sway in the New World. While these sixteenth-century iconoclastic responses to Aztec art changed by the nineteenth century, it is evident that these initial negative interpretations persisted. While no longer seen as "demonic" by Humboldt, Aztec art still remained "monstrous" as it could not faithfully reproduce a mimetic human body. Thus, Aztec art was interpreted as a failed attempt by a "barbaric" people who had not yet achieved full "civilized" status. Humboldt ventures to offer an explanation for the missing body: "Posiblemente estas figuras monstruosas no representan otra cosa que máscaras, pues entre los mexicanos se acostumbraba enmascarar a los ídolos." Instead of viewing the body of Coatlicue as a composite of both human and non-human parts that constituted a whole figura- tive "body," Humboldt offers the explanation that perhaps the body is underneath a costume or mask. He also makes a point that the Mexicans are fond of putting masks on their idols (i.e. gods). Thus, Humboldt viewed the Aztec gods and their bodies deployed in Codices and stone sculptures at best as hidden human figures, and at worst as "monstrous." The ideal and esthetically pleasing body was one that was visually organized through the mimetic gaze, and aimed at realism (as could be found in classical Greek and Roman sculptures) . The Aztec gods, on the other hand, are identified not by their naked body, but through the symbolically charged human and non-human body parts, body paint, and rich ornamentation. The question remains though,</page><page sequence="13">MLN 271 why did Humboldt fail to identify in Aztec art a shared iconic tradi- tion of anthropomorphism and zoomorphism also present in classical Greek and Roman sculptures? In de León y Gama's and Humboldt's detailed drawings of Coatlicue we can appreciate their aim to capture and decipher her "hieroglyphic" body through detailed documentation as if she were a scientific specimen. Her three-dimensional body is deployed through every essential angle to capture her on the two-dimensional page. The scientific gaze reads the mutilated body of Coatlicue through further dismemberment. Humboldt was certainly not the first or last individual to be affected by the problem of interpreting Coatlicue using European aesthetics. In 1823, the English traveler William Bullock had visited Mexico and had noted in his Six Months' Residence (1824) travel narrative that Coatlicue was "the largest and most celebrated of the Mexican deities" (337) and how he had witnessed her re-discovery. As an antiquarian, Bullock was fascinated with studying the "his- torical sculpture" (336) of Mexico, just as the ancient ruins of Rome and Egypt had been unearthed, drawn, and studied.13 With Bullock's renewed interest in the Aztec goddess Coatlicue, and with the aid of Señor Del Rio, Professor of Mineralogy, she was disinterred at the expense of the clergy at the University. This act highlighted how an interest in the Pre-Hispanic past literally re-emerged from the ruins, when the gaze of a foreigner took interest in them. As noted by Robert D. Aguirre in Informal Empire, William Bullock's interests in Coatlicue were not innocent, (for esthetic reasons or the pleasures of knowledge), but formed part of the British Empire's goal of capturing foreign material culture to aggrandize its empire and to capture and display the subjugated "other." Bullock notes, "I had the pleasure of seeing the resurrection of this horrible deity, before whom tens of thousand of human victims had been sacrificed, in the religious and sanguinary fervor of its infatuated worshippers" (338). Bullock highlights the pleasures of discovery and the mixed pleasures of seeing, whether the object at hand is "beautiful" or "horrible." He viewed Coatlicue as horrible both in her original function (bloody sacrifice), and in form (the Aztec earth goddess as a composite of snakes, dismembered hands, and hearts). For Bullock, Coatlicue embodied the raw pleasures of seeing and re-imagining the 13 See Anthony Grafton, Bring Out Your Dead. This book provides a good example of how ancient and classical ruins were read when rediscovered.</page><page sequence="14">272 ANN DELEON limits and permissibility of the body. Coatlicue provoked desire and disgust through her hanging breasts and mutilations, and physically embodied the horror and bloodshed of "the religious and sanguinary fervor of its infatuated worshippers" (338) described in the Conquest narratives that Bullock had read (such as Bernal Diaz's [1492-1581] Historia Verdadera). The horror for Bullock then, besides personal aesthetics, was incited from reading Coatlicue's body as a textuality of horror come to life. Bullock himself perpetuated the drama of Conquest writings in his travel narrative to evoke the passion and the horror with cinematic-like effect. Through the dismembered Aztec body (embodied in the massive sculpture of Coatlicue), his European readers could delight in a theatre of horrors and freak-show cabinet of curiosities that would soon await them in London (Egyptian Hall in Picadilly) , where Bullock would open the first exhibition of Mexican antiquities. He was loaned an important collection of pre-Hispanic archeological objects and Códices from the Mexican government, "pic- tures of Indian antiquities formerly in the collection of the celebrated and ill-used Chevalier Boturini" (329). H Among these were the Códice Boturini (or Tira de Peregrinación) and the Códice Tlaxcala. His stellar exhibition pieces included life-size reproductions of the Aztec Calendar and sculpture of Coatlicue (both now located in Mexico City in the Museo Nacional de Antropología) . The 1824 catalogue of the exhibition included fifty-two objects, among them seventeen Códices which were exhibited on the walls. For full effect, I include below an excerpt from Bullock's travel narrative regarding his impressions of Coatlicue: Those who have read (and who have not) the relation of Cortez of the transactions of the siege of Mexico must have shuddered at the horrid recital of the enormities committed on those who were unfortunately made captives by the natives. The heart, still panting with life, was taken by the priest from the breast, and deemed the more acceptable to the deity if it smoked with life: and the mangled limbs of the victim were then divided amongst the crowd as a feast worthy of the goddess. In the night of desolation, called by the Spaniards Noche Triste, in which many were made prisoners by the Mexicans, the adventurous Cortez, and his few remaining companions in arms, were horror-stricken by witnessing the cruel manner in which their captive fellow-adventurers were dragged 14 The Italian Lorenzo Boturini Benaducci (1698-1756) traveled to Mexico City in efforts to canonize the Virgin of Guadalupe. In 1773 Boturini amassed an impressive collection of Códices and manuscripts written in the indigenous languages of Mexico which he would eventually call his Museo Histórico Indiano.</page><page sequence="15">MLN 273 to the Sacrificial stone, and their hearts, yet warm with vitality, presented by the priests to the gods; and the more the separated seat of life teemed with animation, the more welcome was the offering to the goddess, - the more heart-rending the cries of the victims, the more grateful the sacrifice to this monster representative of deformity and carnage. Some writers have accused the Spanish authors of exaggeration in their accounts of the religious ceremonies of this, in other respects, enlightened people; but a view of the idol [Coatlicue] under consideration will itself be sufficient to dispel any doubt on the subject. (340) If we analyze the passage carefully, Bullock brings the new unearthed object of inquiry (sculpture of Coatlicue) to life. Later Bullock would present her plaster cast in his Piccadilly based venue to a British audi- ence attracted to the sensational, novel, and bizarre. Coatlicue literally and figuratively embodied the horrors of a bloodthirsty Nation and made Cortez's text come to life. Through her body, Coalticue evoked an unwelcoming radical and "violent" femininity as the Aztec mother. Bullock did not read Coatlicue as an earth-mother-goddess, but only as a "monster." To Bullock, she did not demonstrate any mimetic passage to European representations of Earth mothers or classical Roman and Greek statues, i.e. she did not fit the Western European categories of "beauty." Thus, the texts of the Conquest written by the victors and aesthetic tastes of the time became the repertoire for Bullock's read- ing of Coatlicue as "deformity and carnage." Bullock's fascination with Mexican antiquities extended to his description of other objects and Códices housed in the Mineralogy building. Bullock was interested in presenting Mexico as an abundant natural resource ready to be exploited for British commercial interests. An analysis of Bullock's 1824 catalog of his Ancient and Modern exhibition is revealing: Mexico has thus become an object of great European consideration . . . one vast field for the exercise of British capital, machinery, and industry. Already do we see mining and mercantile speculations largely at work .... Under these circumstances it has been felt, that a more intimate knowledge of Mexico, might very appropriately be sought at this time by the medium of an Exhibition of the kind now offered. (4)15 Bullock aimed to display to the London public a "lively impression" (6) of Mexico through a life-like model to the London public. To encourage interest in Mexico and potential investors in its market, it was not enough to hear or read about this distant land. Bullock 15 This excerpt was taken from William Bullock's Catalogue of The Exhibition called Modern Mexico . . . at the Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly, London (1824).</page><page sequence="16">274 ANN DELEON wanted to bring Mexico (the object of inquiry) to London (familiar terrain) for inspection: "The eye is a fine instructor; and a view of Mexico, as it can be represented by such means as those which are here employed, will fix many things upon the mind which cannot be acquired from mere descriptions" (6). Thus, Bullock's strategy was to offer a fixed visual interpretation of Mexico where the audience experienced his version of Mexico through their senses. Bullock's exhibition hall of "Ancient and Modern Mexico" contained a panoramic view of the valley of Mexico depicting rich natural scenery (Aloe, Cactus, and Palm trees), the saltwater lake of Tezcoco, and the Palace of the Viceroys. This panoramic view presented Mexico as an organized (hence, civilized) city with abundant natural resources and a pleasant climate. In front of this view, Bullock placed "a native garden modeled in bulk from actual existence, and flanked by a Mexican Cottage, such as is found in the country, and inhabited by one of the aboriginal Indians. These leave nothing for the imagination" (7). The three-dimensional model of a "Mexican Cottage" and "native garden" literally popped out into view to engage the audience (see fig. 5). More importantly, it was not enough for Bullock to stage a life-like and intimate model of Mexico through panoramic view and hut. Bullock exhibited a living human being to "show things with perfect accuracy" (6) ! Just as the Spanish conquistador Cortez transported Aztec objects and bodies (Aztec acrobats as drawn by Christopher Weiditz [1529]) to the court of Charles the V in the sixteenth century, Bullock trans- ported specimens and "one aboriginal Indian" to England. Bullock's description of the "Indian" in the exhibit is revealing: The Indian himself is an object of merited attention. He is docile and extremely intelligent; apt at learning whatever is proposed to him, and ingenious in mechanics, we might almost say in the fine arts. (7)16 Jose Cayetana Ponce de Leon, is an Indian of the village of Chyula, one league from Tezcuco; besides his native language, he speaks and writes Spanish, as well as a little Italian, and is well informed on the history and affairs of his country; he was the only one of his countrymen that could be induced to leave his home for Europe, to whom the idea of living on the "blue waters" for several weeks was as dreadful as a voyage to the Moon. A glance at the simple furniture of his cot will display the few wants of this gentle and happy race of men. (12) 16 Bullock's description of the natives echoes earlier descriptions offered by early Franciscan missionaries in Mexico such as Sahagún. Sahagún, like Bullock described the natives as docile in nature, ingenious in their crafts (feather-working), and their abilities to learn new skills quickly (Latin).</page><page sequence="17">MLN 275 Figure 5. Bullock's exhibition of Ancient and Modern Mexico (1824) (Public domain). Before I discuss Bullock's description of Cayetano, it is important to first place him in the context of the exhibit. As noted previously, one of Bullock's primary aims in creating such an exhibit was to present a montage of Mexico to encourage British investment and tourism. Bullock achieved this by enabling his viewers to experience Mexico in a virtual-reality-like exhibit. This exhibit of Mexico was divided into two sections: Ancient Mexico and Modern Mexico. Bullock used a Eurocentric conception of linear time and history to construct his exhibit to visually present the development of Mexico as he perceived it: from a barbaric past (Ancient Mexico) to new and improved "civilized" present (Modern Mexico). This contrast between the old "barbaric" and the new "civilized" Mexico is apparent in the layout of the exhibit. The 'Ancient Mexico' side displays the massive plaster- cast sculpture of Coatlicue (accompanying Aztec Códices hanging on the walls) as the barbaric and monstrous bodies par excellence. On the 'Modern Mexico' side, the live and interactive body of Cayetano (both as object and subject) is displayed. While Coatlicue represents the silent ruins and impenetrable (unreadable) barbaric past of the</page><page sequence="18">276 ANN DELEON Mexicans, Cayetano in contrast represents the penetrable (readable) and docile body: "The Indian himself is an object of merited atten- tion. He is docile and extremely intelligent; apt at learning whatever is proposed to him . . ." (7). Thus, Cayetano forms part of the exhibit on modern Mexico as material proof of the future work force that awaits potential European investors. Cast as a noble-savage, Cayetano is ideal, because he is a willing and quick learner who has the capacity, under proper instruction to perform skilled tasks. Nonetheless, a tension is exhibited in the rest of Bullock's description which raises many ques- tions: "besides his [Cayetano's] native language, he speaks and writes Spanish, as well as a little Italian, and is well informed on the history and affairs of his country; he was the only one of his countrymen that could be induced to leave his home for Europe." It is important to note that Bullock's statement highlights the difficulty of procuring an "Indian" to travel overseas with him; Cayetano was the only one whom Bullock could "induce to leave." Thus, to the European audience, Bullock presented an ideal Mexican workforce made up of primitive "Indians" (individuals of non-European descent) with few needs. None- theless, besides speaking a native language which connects him to the pre-Conquest Mexican past, Cayetano is described as a Spanish and Italian speaker who is informed on his country. While Cayetano is cast as the "other" with respect to the European viewing public (through dress, language, and phenotype), he nonetheless can communicate in European languages, i.e. he can talk back. Thus, Cayetano is not only acting as an object of inquiry or "inspection" for the viewer of the exhibit, but in turn can view, talk back, and interact as performer, spectator, subject, and object. One can only wonder what Cayetano may have thought his role in the exhibit was. Was he simply asked to be "himself or was he asked to perform "himself as an "Indian"? Given that Cayetano had to live in the exhibit hut as well, one can only imagine what he thought about his fabricated surroundings: painted backdrop, stuffed animal specimens and plants that surrounded him, and the plaster casts of ancient Aztec "monstrous" sculptures. It would be interesting to know what Cayetano thought about the European public he interacted with. Examining the image more closely (see fig. 5), on the far left we see an Englishman inspecting one of the many Códices exhibiting unreadable (for a European public) abstract two-dimensional bodies. Next to him are a woman and child, perhaps the Englishman's wife and child. The woman is facing the massive plaster cast sculpture of Coatlicue. To the right of Coatlicue are a man and a woman. The man</page><page sequence="19">MLN 277 is pointing a stick at and perhaps explaining some aspect of Coatlicue. At the center of the image stands a family looking into the painted scenery: exotic flora and fauna, and a massive "monstrous" snake. The audience is barred from entering the scenery by a fence which only Cayetano is allowed to cross. The idea of the border/barrier is interesting to explore. The barrier acts as a way to secure the illusion of reality, i.e. observing the montage at a distance allows the viewer to 'experience' Mexico without being exposed to the "exotic" land. The barrier can also signify a comfort zone where the public can be a voyeur and see, without being touched or subjected to the "orgy of unimaginable forms."17 This barrier may also remind one of visiting a zoo. In fact, the little girl at the center of the image is pointing to the snake (on the far right) of monstrous proportions with shark-like teeth. While an abundance of exotic cacti, palm trees, animals, and monsters is close to the barrier zone for the viewer to better appreci- ate, at the far distance there is a view of the "civilized," and hence "Modern," city of Mexico. The modern city is pristine and organized. It is set apart from the exotic, threatening, and yet enticing jungle. How might spectators have read this part of the exhibit? Perhaps one reading is the transformation of an "ancient" and savage Mexico of the past by the civilizing powers of Europe. Mexico is full of natural resources which can be mined, extracted, enjoyed, and controlled. To the far right of the family is Cayetano, dressed in "Indian-like" attire, speaking to a European man. Cayetano, unlike the viewing public, can cross the fence in either direction and interact with the spectators. Cayetano can watch and be watched; his role can thus be likened to a re-enactment of "reality." To summarize, the viewing public, based on the aesthetics of the time, was exposed to and commented upon the multiple "monstrous/exotic" bodies that surrounded them. The monumental and terrifying bodies of Coatlicue and the giant snake would remain petrified ruins representative of ancient barbaric Mexico. On the other hand, Cayetano, representative of present Modern day Mexico, became re-cast (through a complex performance of himself as "Indian") as the gentle "other" (noble savage) through his costume, skin, language, food, and habitat. 17 This quote was taken from Nancy Stepan, Picturing Tropical Nature. While her quote originally describes the flora and fauna of Brazil, it seems appropriate to use it here out of context where the British public was exposed to flora and fauna of unimaginable proportions.</page><page sequence="20">278 ANN DELEON IV. Justino Fernández: Decoding Coatlicue One of the first important scholarly works on this Goddess is the the- sis Coatlicue. Estética del arte indígena antiguo (1954) written by Justino Fernández. Fernández performed a detailed art historical analysis of Coatlicue, and attempted to decode the meaning of her dismembered body. Such an enterprise was well timed with the massive archeological findings in Mexico City and the invention of an Aztec "literature" by Father Angel Maria Garibay and the renowned scholar León-Portilla. Scholars such as Justino Fernández were faced with the difficult task of deciphering the meaning behind stones (that continually emerged from the depths of the metropolis), and "paintings" (in the Códices rediscovered in European and Mexican archives) . In fact, the meaning of Coatlicue could not have been fully deciphered without reading the recently discovered Códices. One of these Códices was Sahagun's Florentine Codex. The desire to categorize Aztec documents (preserved in written alphabetic Náhuatl and translated into Spanish) into European liter- ary categories was driven by a need for Mexican intellectuals not only to justify the importance of studying pre- and post-Conquest "Aztec" culture, but also to "elevate" it to the respected level that the disci- pline of Literature enjoyed. In a similar fashion, art historian Justino Fernández felt compelled to interpret the symbolism of Coatlicue 's stone body using the apparatus of art history.18 Fernández had at his disposal the "Aztec" literary archive to aid his interpretation of the complex symbolism of Coatlicue. In the Florentine Codex, Fernández could find the description in Spanish of the goddess Coatlicue and the epic birth of the God Huitzilopochtli, founder of the Aztec empire. More importantly Fernández could decipher the possible symbolism of the iconography of Coatlicue as the Spanish text in the Florentine Codex contained an encyclopedic-like wealth of information of the meaning of Aztec costumes. I will now proceed to describe the physical composition of the stone sculpture of Coatlicue before delving into the symbolic interpretation. The frontal view of the decapitated goddess possesses two precious turquoise serpents (xihuitl). The profiles of these two snakes face each other and share one bifid tongue which juts out of one shared 18Justino Fernández was not alone in using the tools of his discipline (Art History) to categorize and study Aztec material culture. At approximately the same time, the Art Historian Donald Robertson (1959) was busy categorizing Aztec Códices into schools of "painting" using a Eurocentric aesthetic apparatus.</page><page sequence="21">MLN 279 mouth lined with large fangs. Around her neck, Coatlicue wears a necklace of severed hands and hearts from which a skull hangs to partially cover her hanging breasts. Instead of arms, Coatlicue possesses forward projecting serpent heads. In place of elbows and shoulders (located at the height of her waist), are figures of the Aztec female earth monster (Tlaltecuhtli). Instead of human legs and feet, she has huge bird claws. She wears a belt made of a serpent with two heads whose body is patterned by turquoises. Coatlicue (whose name literally means, her skirt of snakes) wears a skirt composed of woven bodies of rattlesnakes which cover bundles of feathers. Coatlicue 's snake "head" faces both front and back just as the skull between her breasts is mirrored on the back of the sculpture. A relief of Tlaloc- Tlaltecuhtli (God of water and earth, both elements associated in the Aztec religion with the feminine and the reproductive) consists of the most intricate work. However, Tlaloc-Tlaltecuhtli resides at the base and out of view of the casual spectator! It would not be hard to imagine how previous scholars and travelers who beheld her presence were left in awe and "shock." Coatlicue is not only massive in size (3 tons), but most likely defies our preconceived notions of what is "feminine." Does Coatlicue possess the body of an earth mother or goddess in Western canon's loci of enunciation? Were it not for Coatlicue 's hanging breasts and skirt (an article of clothes only worn by women), she would most likely be simply interpreted as a monster or as male in gender. As Cecilia Klein notes, witches, wild women, and whores in the European imaginaire were represented as 'grotesque' by depicting them with naked sagging breasts, long unruly hair, or as cannibals.19 This grotesque view of the female body, or its misreading as male, was extended when describing Aztec goddesses as well. As Klein notes, in 1596 Fray Gerónimo Mendietta reported "Cihuacoatl (the Aztec goddess, Serpent woman) could change her- self into a serpent or a lovely young woman who enticed men into intercourse so that she could kill them" (247). Such reports may clarify how patriarchal fears and desires regarding the female body were projected onto the New World, i.e. that women were painted as seductive yet dangerous, and ultimately monstrous (witches, etc). Thus, the case of interpreting Coatlicue's body as monstrous falls into a similar pattern. Furthermore, in Christian imagery the snake represented the devil, or the temptation of Eve and fall of man, so it was an unfortunate coincidence that many Aztec gods and goddesses 19 See Cecilia Klein's "Wild Woman in Colonial Mexico."</page><page sequence="22">280 ANN DELEON were composed of snakes and read through the Christian religion. For the Aztecs, snakes were considered sacred animals that represented (through the shedding of snake skin) their vision of cyclical time, rebirth, and renewal. Besides the rediscovery of the Florentine Codex, Fernández was indebted to the Avant-garde movements of the 20s and 30s and the work of artists such as Diego Rivera (among many others) , who had developed a new "Western" aesthetics where the "primitive" was viewed and evaluated in a different way than in Humboldt's time. In any case, why would some of the most delicate and intricate sculptural work be located at the "hidden" (out of view) bottom of the sculpture? Who was the intended audience of this impressive sculptural piece? What might Coatlicue's violent composite of dismembered hands, hearts, and snakes tell us about Aztec conceptions of the body? Justino Fernández explored some of these questions in his thesis. This enterprise was certainly challenging because it involved an understanding of the relationship between the symbolic elements that composed her body to the pantheon of Aztec gods and their Solar Ages (view of the repeti- tive and cyclical nature of creation and destruction of time). Coatlicue's decapitated head, represented by two snakes joining profiles (also mirrored in the back of the sculpture), was interpreted to represent the dual nature of creation embodied by Ometeotl (the dual masculine and feminine Gods, Ometecuhtli and Omecihuatl, respectively) . This primordial couple gave birth to the Aztec Gods who in turn sacrificed their bodies to create and maintain the movement of the cosmos. These Aztec Gods sacrificed themselves in order to ensure the continual journey and movement of the Sun (its birth and death). The Aztecs believed that the Sun (also represented by the God Quetzalcoatl and the planet Venus) traveled through four different spatial quadrants (East to West). At night, the Sun (or God Xolotl) was believed to travel to the underworld to battle death (symbolized by the skull on Coatlicue's chest) and re-emerge from the wet and reproductive feminine earth (represented by the hidden relief of the water-earth God Tlaloc-Tlaltecuhtli) as a sun warrior. The sun warrior Huitzilopochtil (Hummingbird to the Left), as recorded by Sahagun, was conceived from a feather (underneath Coatlicue's skirt are bundles of feathers). Coatlicue's rattlesnake skirt represented a petition for rain (an essential element for the reproduc- tion and sustenance of the earth) through the sound of rattlesnakes that mimicked the sound of rain. The turquoises on the snakes (concentric circles) were described in Sahagún 's codex to symbol-</page><page sequence="23">MLN 281 ize something precious and also signified "year" and "herb," thus as interpreted by Fernández, associating Coatlicue's body with time and fertility. These precious serpents (xiuhcoatl or fire serpents) depicted on her body are also the weapon depicted on Huitzilopochtli (in the codex) with which he defeated and mutilated his sister Coyolxauhqui (who became the moon), his 400 unruly siblings the Centzonuitzna- hua (who became the stars) , to displace the Sun while it traveled in the celestial vault from east to west (left to right). The two snakes facing the front and the back also represented the Aztecs concept of cyclical time, i.e. that the future represented a mirror of the past. Just as the Aztec Gods had sacrificed their bodies to continue the Sun's cycle, around Coatlicue's neck the dismembered hands and hearts were seen to represent the necessity of human sacrifice to maintain the cosmos. The representation of Coatlicue's body in the Florentine Codex (see fig. 6) is fascinating as it visually demonstrates how the post-Conquest tlacuilos negotiated to include their pre-Hispanic Cosmovision within a Renaissance repertoire. Despite the fact that the tlacuilos learned (at the College of Tlatelolco) new Renaissance techniques of representa- tion (i.e. of painting bodies as three-dimensional, with shading, and aiming at a mimetic representation of the human body) , the tlacuilos felt that this type of mimetic representation of the human body (or portraiture) could not convey the historical symbolism encoded in their pre-Conquest pictographic painting-writing tradition. Thus, despite already having encoded (into multiple referents) the history of Coatlicue and her miraculous (virgin) birth of Huitzilopochtli in Náhuatl alphabetic text, and translated and paraphrased by Sahagún into Spanish text, the tlacuilos felt that the story could still only be best conveyed by "painting-writing" their history through symbolic iconography (as also deployed in their architecture). The cliché of "a picture speaks a thousand words" certainly applies here. The tlacuilos negotiated and selected between two different pictorial systems (pre- Hispanic and Renaissance) to represent Coatlicue's body. Compar- ing the post-Conquest pictorial representation of Coatlicue in the Florentine Codex with her pre-Conquest sculpture may reveal some of the strategies used by the tlacuilos assisting Sahagún to translate her body into their Colonial reality. In the Florentine Codex, Coatlicue's body is three-dimensional and rendered mimetic to the human body (in nature), thus employing the Renaissance tradition of represen- tation (as opposed to the pre-Hispanic tradition of deploying the body in two-dimensions with a sideways-facing profile and solid color</page><page sequence="24">282 ANN DELEON Figure 6. Coatlicue giving birth to Huitzilopochtli in the Florentine Codex (From Sahagún, Historia general, ed. Paso y Troncoso, 1905. Public domain.) wash). Coatlicue's body in the Florentine Codex is also a "whole" human body (i.e. it has human arms, legs, and a head), as opposed to the sculpture where her body is in parts (mutilated) and reconfigured through symbolic animals: her decapitated head is replaced by two facing snake profiles (to represent the cyclical nature of Aztec time); her arms are composed of two fire-serpents (the weapons used by her son Huitzilopochtli to defeat his siblings and move the Sun); her legs are two large bird claws (thus associating her with air (bird) and land (snake) animals). The combination of her snake-head and bird-feet are also a metaphor for the Aztec God Quetzalcoatl (meaning plumed serpent) . Having inscribed a pictorial metaphor of Quetzalcoatl on</page><page sequence="25">MLN 283 Coatlicue's body was important as Quetzalcoatl formed an important part in the Aztec cycle of the destruction and creation of new beings. Quetzalcoatl had carried out a mythical voyage to the underworld to create humans. He achieved this by mixing his own blood (through a piercing), semen, and mashing these up with bones. The underworld that represented a dark, feminine, wet, and womb-like place enabled the creation of humans and thus helped to preserve the movement of the Sun. The underworld is represented on Coatlicue's base through the female cosmic Earth Monster with open jaws. Thus, the cosmic Earth monster consumed humans (through blood sacrifice) and produced humans by providing sustenance (e.g. corn). Since the tlacuilos did not represent Coatlicue's body as mutilated (as occurred with the statue, i.e. to narrate how Coatlicue's children killed her) , in the Florentine Codex, instead, the tlacuilos symbolically marked her imminent death by painting white "death" balls on her head. Another difference between the sculpture and the painting is that the tlacuilos in the Florentine Codex decided to cover Coatlicue's breasts (shown in the statue) with a huipil (woman's blouse). In pre- Conquest Códices and sculpture, the depictions of breasts (and skirts) were key markers for identifying female gender. Given that no female figure in the Florentine Codex was depicted with breasts (i.e. all female bodies are covered), it is most likely that Sahagun (as well as other missionaries) censored what they saw as the "immoral" representation of women's bodies. Thus, the only marker that was left for the tlacuilos to visually identify Coatlicue as both a woman and herself was her sym- bolically rendered snake-skirt. To preserve the symbolically encoded story of Huitzilopochtli's birth (as was done in the sculpture), in the Florentine Codex the tlacuilos painted Huitzilopochtli underneath the larger figure of his mother (Coatlicue ) born as a full-fledged adult, in his symbolic costume and weapons (to identify him). It was in this manner that the free-floating bodies of Coatlicue and Huitzilopochtli on the blank European page (pre-Hispanic tradition of representation, as opposed to the European representation of bodies anchored to the ground, and represented within the context of a landscape to provide a three-dimensional perspective) were able to narrate the foundation of the Aztec empire (through the principle of duality, or Ometeotl) and the cyclical nature of Aztec time. The birth of Huitzilopochtli (male, with a fire weapon - a masculine element) was linked to the death of Coatlicue (female, and in giving birth, was associated with water [placenta] - a female element).</page><page sequence="26">284 ANN DELEON V. Conclusions: Coatlìcue, Looking to the Future Which is Behind Us? Now that we have established that the massive sculpture of the goddess Coatlicue narrated the birth of the Aztec Empire through iconographie language, it might be worthwhile to think about her relation to time. The iconography on the front of the statue mirrors the iconography on the back. At the top of the sculpture, the profiles of two serpent-heads meet each other both in the front and in the back. As serpents were observed in nature to shed their skin and re-emerge as new snakes, the snakeheads in the sculpture were viewed as embodying the cyclical nature of Aztec time (also called solar cycles or ages). For the Aztecs, the front of Coatlicue represented the past, and her back the future. Therefore, does Coatlicue's position/direction relative to 'physical' time mean she is traveling back in time to tell a story - that she faces and walks into the past and represents through the iconography of her body history itself? Similarly, people observing the statue are facing Coatlicue, and thus the observers are facing the future (behind her), which seems logical. This suggests that this spatial representation of time (i.e. the past as in front of us, and the future as behind us) is because (to paraphrase Constance Classen), the future is not some- thing that one can walk ahead into, but rather, something that one has to turn oneself around to reach. In Aztec Cosmovision a similar system operated. The Aztecs organized time through a series of cycles. Each new age resulted from the destruction of a previous cataclysmic age (or Sun). The Aztecs believed that they had already passed through four solar ages, and at the time of their recorded Empire inhabited the fifth age. Thus, Coatlicue's body, through its mirroring snakes and its composition of female and male parts (Ometeotl), narrated the cycle of the destruction of the previous (fourth age) and the creation of the new Aztec age (fifth sun). One could therefore understand how the post-Conquest tlacuilos (painter-scribes) survivors of the traumatic Conquest of Mexico decided to represent (in post-Conquest Códices) this event within their cyclical Cosmovision instead of seeing it as the demise of their world (or vision of the vanquished). The tlacuilos re- wrote colonial society as a new solar age, and as the birth of a new Aztec-Christian people. University of Alberta</page><page sequence="27">MLN 285 WORKS CITED Aguirre, Robert D.
