<plain_text><page sequence="1">984 Book Reviews JACQUES LOEB: HIS SCIENCE AND SOCIAL ACTIVISM AND THEIR PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATIONS. By Charles Rasmussen andRick Tilman. Phila- delphia, PA: American Philosophical Society, 1998. Ontology deals with the ultimate nature of being; it is metaphysics. Ontological posi- tions transcend and pervade Kuhnian paradigms. One axis along which ontological positions are located is determinism versus free will. In contemporary thought, deter- minism can take the form of Darwinian natural selection, genetics (DNA), brain and/or organic chemistry, and so on, including some form of psychology; free will, the operation of individual choice and the role of environment. In some formulations environmental determinism opposes human nature and in others, divine determin- ism-the argument from design-challenges all other positions. Jacques Loeb's emphasis on physical and chemical processes underlying instinct and his theory of tropisms the growth or movement of an organism in response to a stimulus, con- trolled by underlying physical and chemical mechanisms-constituted a form of mechanistic determinism. His mechanism provided a materialist alternative to teleo- logical and theological explanations, thus challenging the argument from design, simultaneously challenging notions of unlimited free will. But Loeb nonetheless contemplated science as engaged in social engineering to make the world better and thus people happier. Such natural-science mechanistic determinism constrains but precludes neither individual choice nor social policy; in part at least, the latter are matters of controlling the mechanisms. From a non-theologi- cal position, the contemporary equivalent has interdependent roles for natural selec- tion, DNA, brain and body chemistry, psychology, environment, and individual choice as well as social-reform policy. Critical rationalism may emphasize the limits of human reason but such is exercised in both doing so and working out our under- standing of the other role players and of their entanglements. Jacques Loeb (1859-1924) was an eminent physiologist and public intellectual who worked on physiology and psychology. He is known for his theory of tropes, the physicochemical control mechanisms that govern responses to stimuli, and artificial parthenogenesis, the development of an egg without fertilization. He worked at the Universities of Chicago and California and the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research. As the authors write, Loeb's "metatheoretical, epistemological, and onto- logical positions were ... loosely integrated with his political, social and moral philos- ophy" to produce "a secular humanism that provided the underpinnings for an independent radical political outlet" (p. 1). Loeb's ideas are important, complex, and sometimes judiciously developed and expressed. They could also be unsubtle, myopic, confused, ambivalent, and a combi- nation of general principles and selective subjective beliefs. Rick Tilman has written extensively on Thorstein Veblen, and Charles Rasmus- sen is chair of the Department of Psychology; both are at the University of Nevada at</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 985 Las Vegas. It is the Loeb-Veblen connection that prompts their attention to Loeb, rely- ing heavily on Loeb's correspondence. Chapter 1 sketches Loeb's career; chapter 2, his philosophy and research agenda; chapter 3, his work during World War I (relating to pacifism, militarism, patriotism and imperialism); chapter 4, his efforts at political and social activism (temperance, religion and scientific humanism, the politics of science, and academic freedom); chapter 5, his influence on Veblen; chapter 6, his views on racism, Zionism, and ethnocentrism; and chapter 7, his disillusionment after the war. Chapter 8 is an epi- logue treating the topics of epistemology, social control, and political activism. For the purposes of review in this journal, I concentrate on what the authors say about Loeb's influence on Veblen. They were colleagues at Chicago, read and cited each other's work, and corresponded. Tilman and Rasmussen's general argument is that the relationship between Loeb and Veblen was one of "both intellectual influence and doctrinal convergence" (p. 93). They argue, incontrovertibly, that the two men "shared a common radical political outlook and convergent research objectives," that "both attempted to undermine theories that rested on unscientific or, more often, prescientific, that is, pre-Darwinian grounds," and that both "aimed at discrediting vitalistic, teleological, introspective, animistic, anthropomorphic metaphysical and spiritualist explanations of both the natural and social order" (p. 94). They also shared what for Veblen was a "predisposition" toward social control and for Loeb the "engi- neering ideal" (p. 100). Additionally, both "turned to deterministic explanations based on instincts, tropisms and reflexes" (p. 100). But what beyond that and what of "influence"? We read, "Did Veblen share Loeb's belief that the truth of mechanistic materialism could be demonstrated by uncovering the physical and chemical bases of biological phenomena? It is impossible to say with any degree of certainty.... Loeb believed that perception and behavior were largely biological functions, while Veblen was more open to the view that the social and cultural environ- ment induces a wide variety of reactions on the part of humankind" (P. 95). Again: "The extent to which Veblen agreed with Loeb's reductionist epistemology and mechanistic materialist ontology is an open question .. . " (p. 101). Indeed, neither Loeb nor Veblen seems to have worked out either the conflicts between the two determinisms and between determinism and wilt/policy or the meanings of fundamental terms. The authors contend that "Loeb's impact on Veblen was greater than is com- monly supposed and, perhaps more important, that the convergence in their thinking reveals much about Veblen's own use of concepts drawn from psychology and biol- ogy" (p. 96). The evidence for this impact is less convincing (e.g., p. 102; I find con- flict, not confluence) than for another of their conclusions, namely, that their "epistemological and metatheoretical convergence made them easily recognizable as products of the same cultural and intellectual milieu and ... as sharing the same politi- cal and moral values"-a view they also call "doctrinal proximity" (p. 99). They also write of "considerable mutual influence" (p. 119).</page><page sequence="3">986 Book Reviews I think partial reinforcement of common ideas is more likely than causal influence per se; surely the influences on Veblen's original thinking were many and varied. Tilman and Rasmussen have undertaken an important and difficult task, the rela- tion between two thinkers in different fields. They may not settle the question of influ- ence, but they help us know both the two subjects and a certain intellectual milieu somewhat better. I recommended publication of the manuscript to the publisher, and I recommend the book to readers of this journal. WARREN J. SAMUELS Michigan State University</page></plain_text>
