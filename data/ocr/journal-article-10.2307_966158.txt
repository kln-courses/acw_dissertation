<plain_text><page sequence="1">CONTEMPORARY BRITISH COMPOSERS 3 James Dillon: currents of development Keith Potter I should say first of all that I'm surprised that people are still writing at all in the late 20th century .. .For example, mass communication, media, the domination of the media: the fact that the media actually controls our lives more than politicians now. All these things, actually, are completely undermining the principles of what we are doing... I see what I'm doing, personally, as defending something that should not be lost. But having said that, I'm still surprised that there are still so many people around willing to defend what lies at the heart ... of European culture. It's struggling with this notion of cohesion all the time, you know. I always remember being rather frightened by the first time that I read Fundamentals of Musical Composition by Schoenberg; the sen- tence that always stuck in my mind was this notion that the one thing the composer is always struggling with is the notion of cohesion. And of course it's absolutely true. Because at one particular moment in the construction of any work, you can go off in infinite directions. You can easily start off in the same position and end up with a piece of Phil Glass, if you manipulated it in a particular way. And so the important thing for me when I'm composing is, how far can I close this space down? Ultimately the most important thing is the question of boundaries itself, and how one can limit the movement. If you flatten anything out, there's not a great deal you can do with it afterwards. I like all the kinks and the bumps and the grit and the dirt and the mess and the beauty and everything that lies within an untouched landscape. If one is still struggling with the idea of formp... to create something in search of itself... it involves such complex questions that the idea of simplifying is a betrayal. Who are you writing for?' These quotations tell us a good deal. Perhaps most of all, they convey the urgency with which James Dillon addresses the relationship between the shape his music takes - in particular the literal, formal shape - and a range of considerations, some of which others would say went well beyond the province, the purview, of music itself. Dillon has always been an 'anti-specialist', while still managing to acquire an enviable range of specialist skills to do what he feels needs to be done in his own compositions. There is more than a hint that the pushing against boundaries which is the necessary 'other side of the coin' to the concerns for limiting the field in certain ways, and most of all for 'cohesion', in achieved against the grain in some way; certainly music such as Dillon's is not exactly easy to write. But some readers may be surprised at the extent to which a composer usually considered a member of the school of 'The New Complexity' is dealing with a range of concerns we may perhaps call 'humanist'. There is a recognition, for instance, of the need for coherent structure, though the need to address the 'infinitude of possibilities' is also acknowledged. There must be 'direction' in the music, but also what the composer frequently calls 'disruption'. Since there should be no danger that he will be mistaken for a purveyor either of familiarly fractured modernism or of the kind of post- modernisation which also has an image of 'bits and scraps' existing in a cultural void, it just might be possible to examine a few of the complexities and, yes, the contradictions which lie behind Dillon's ideas and music by reference to postmodernist issues. Despite the composer's perfectly natural protestations. It will probably be seen, to those who know his music, not merely surprising but totally wrong-headed to connect James Dillon with the postmodernist debate. It certainly does to the composer himself. As a prime mover in the area of contemporary music which generally goes under the label 'The New Complexity' - no better, but perhaps also no worse a 'tool' than postmodernism - this Scottish composer has frequently been seen as heir to the tradition, if such it can already be called, of Brian Ferneyhough: as firmly committed, that is to say, as is his English colleague to a music of dense surface, close to if not beyond the limits of performability, justified by reference to the fearsome intellectual discourse which is said to lie behind those torrents of notes. It would seem more natural - perhaps, indeed, potentially very fruitful - to link any attempt to define postmodernism via real pieces of music with the outputs of either James MacMillan or Malcolm Singer, Dillon's two predecessors in this series. Even in these two cases, however, it should quickly become clear that to deal with postmodernism is to be dealing with something rather more than a simple, comforting rejection of avant-garde ways. It is true that one of the many useful things the postmodernist debate has thrown up is a re-examination of what, to some, was the formerly simple division of composers into 'conser- vative' or 'radical'; and one of the spin-offs of this is an increased suspicion of the validity of such terms at all. One might still, though, hazard the observation that the recent traces of 'I told you so' to be found in the conversation of some fairly hard-line - to the extent of being self-professed - conservative composers misses the point fairly comprehensively. For one thing, both MacMillan and Singer, for instance, combine what may be seen as a non-avant-garde intention with at least occasional, if not more fundamental, use of what are usually seen as avant-garde techniques, as has been demonstrated. But the problems of defining the post- modern do not, of course, stop there. Let us temporarily abort this discussion, in order to pick it up again in more direct confrontation with the attempt to describe the music written by the subject of this article. James Dillon was born in Glasgow on 29 October 1950. At the age of nine, the settled family life in which he was initially brought up was disrupted, and he was eventually brought to London where he has largely lived ever since. Before he left Scotland, though, the elements - musical and otherwise - of a typical Glasgow Catholic background had played an important part in his life: church music (he served as an altar boy until the age of 12), playing Scottish pipe music, football chants at Celtic. The explosion of rock music in the 1960s led to rock being his chief musical concern as a teenager: he was in a rhythm-and-blues band called Influx; Geno Washington was one of his heroes; and Billy Currie numbered among his friends. (It would be interesting to 253 1These and all quotations not otherwise acknowledged come from recent interview or correspondence with the composer.</page><page sequence="2">James Dillon Photo: Susan Homewood discover just how many British composers of Dillon's generation essentially came to music via the rock boom of the period, and whether its effect on them was more than passing.) For him, though, '[i]t all died out in '69 or so, when rock believed it could change the world.'2 Anyone knowing anything of Dillon's reputation as a fairly fearsome musical intelligence would assume that it was at this point that he went to university. In fact he spent two years at Keele University (reading music and physics) only some time later, in 1976-8, by which time he had his own family but had hardly begun to find himself as a composer. It was not, it would seem, a question of indecision about becoming a composer, 2The composer, quoted in Dick Witts, 'The New Dillon', Time Out, no. 743 (15-21 November 1984), p.6. 254</page><page sequence="3">something Dillon appears to have fixed on quite early; rather, it was chronic uncertainty as to how to proceed. The late 1960s and early 1970s were spent trying to sort all this out, and these years were filled with a discon- certing mixture of experiences: lactivities at the Drury Lane Arts Laboratory, deep involvement with the Kabbala, via Robert Lenkewicz and a period spent in Devon; taking a course in linguistics at the Polytechnic of Central London; and generally soaking up a whole library's worth of books on philosophy, aesthetics, acoustics etc. to which the walls of his house still testify. Most importantly, perhaps, all this was part of what Roger Wright has called Dillon's 'own personal compo- sition course',3 with topics both musical and 'extra- musical' explored by a rigorous and scientific mind which has always seemingly been concerned not only to abandon at least some of those distinctions between 'musical' and 'extra-musical' in what one might call the various stages of pre-compositional research, but also to forge a vigorous dialectic between them which will impinge on the substance and nature of the resulting compositions themselves. Accusations - which, in their politer expressions emerge in such forms as the criticism that contem- porary music is too formalist, or too concerned to examine its own innards - are widely levelled at music such as Dillon's; its 'complexity' and its 'intellectualism' are often seen as deliberate barriers erected to protect an intellectual and privileged elite from the hue and cry of those who demand that music shall 'communicate', and do so instantly. What more natural, then - especially in these hard times for education generally, and when the BBC has already become markedly less 'elitist' than it was in the 1960s - than that The New Complexity should be seen as finding its natural home among dessicated intellectuals more concerned with the structure of musical works than with their ability to inspire whatever it is that music is widely felt should be inspiring? In fact, few of the leading British figures in the field of New Complexity have had much better than a tangen- tial, and in some cases abortive, relationship with universities in this country. Dillon left Keele, dis- illusioned, after only two years; his only involvement with a British university since then has been two years of part-time teaching at Goldsmiths' College, London (1986-7 and 1988-9). Thus, for example, none of the four composers discussed in Richard Toop's large-scale survey, 'Four Facets of the New Complexity',4 has even completed a B.Mus. or its equivalent, let alone pursued postgraduate composition studies or taught full-time in a university. Dillon is, indeed, frequently celebrated in Continental Europe (where he still, like Ferneyhough and the other three subjects of Toop's article - Richard Barrett, Chris Dench and Michael Finnissy - receives more attention than at home) as 'an autodidact'. The composer, too, clearly feels that his 'personal composi- tion course' allowed a different relationship to, for instance, the whole business of serialism, which he encountered for himself in the early 1970s, or, as he himself puts it, tripped on... too late to really affect my thinking. What it did do... it does actually force you to think about what the hell you're doing in terms of the implications and the richness and complexity of the whole thing. But I'm not a product of the conservatoires and the universities. For Dillon, indeed, compositional validity seemed more achievable in the isolation to which he could be said to have returned after his Keele experience: 'I wanted,' he has said, 'to claw my way back to where music still has meaning, and not present some kind of second-hand experience.'5 At least that isolation had now started to produce some tangible results: he began to be able to finish more pieces and, at the end of the 1970s, to gain some performances of work which, because of the difficulties it has always involved, can only rarely be played by anyone other than ex- perienced new-music professionals. With Dillug- Kefitsah, (1976) for piano, Dillon finally abandoned his previous experiments with such things as proportional notation in favour of the characteristically 'complex' approach he has adopted ever since. With... Once upon a Time (1979-80) for eight players, he achieved, in a more consistent and extended way, what Toop has called the 'sheer aggression'6 which has been seen as a major characteristic of his mature music: the characteristic which, coupled to his concern for timbre (which has gone through various stages, some already well- documented),7 has brought about the frequent sugges- tions of some association with Varese and Xenakis. Dillon appeared finally to have found himself in a style that seems to thrive on constraints - of notation, of instrumental possibility - for which he has not merely settled, but which themselves imply - perhaps even manifest or embody - a very uneasy relationship between form and expression. Or, as Toop graphically puts it, the stereotypical Dillon work 'would grapple relentlessly with some post-Varesian "harmonic block" '.8 There are at least three ways of questioning this issue of 'aggression', and they all suggest fruitful paths into an investigation of Dillon's output in more detail. The easiest one to deal with is the 'historical' point raised by Toop: that the particular sort of vitality best, if crudely, summed up in this way in fact 'seemed to retreat briefly in the works of the mid-eighties', even though it 're-emerges untamed in Uberschreiten'9 and can be observed too in recent works. While it is perfectly possible for a perceptive commentator such as Toop to describe Dillon as 'probably the most metaphysically turbulent' of the four composers discussed in his already-mentioned article,10 and for the composer him- self to discuss his work using what Toop aptly sum- marises as a 'typically Varesian "cosmic and sexual" formulation'," it is also valid to assert, as Wright has done, that 'Dillon's music has become more and more refined since... Once Upon Time. His aim has been to move away from bold, empty, noisy, gestural music to a music in which formal elegance plays a large part.'12 It is tempting to link this increase in, or rather arrival of, 'formal elegance' in his output with the other chief technical and stylistic change in Dillon's work to date: the influence of the so-called 'spectral composition' developed via new research into properties and appli- cations of the harmonic series undertaken by the group 3Roger Wright, 'James Dillon', Contact, no. 24 (Spring 1982), p.20. 4Richard Toop, 'Four Facets of "The New Complexity" ', Contact, no. 32 (Spring 1988), pp.4-50. 5Quoted in Wright, op. cit., p.20. 6Toop, op. cit., p.38. 7See especially Dillon's own article 'Speculative Instruments', unpub- lished in its original English, but available in French in ed.

But while it is surely true to say that Dillon has developed a new, or at least different, interest in harmony - and to date this from Windows and Canopies (1985) for chamber orchestra, in particular: the work in which he applied some of the 'spectral' notions of composing with the harmonic series to his music for the first time - there is hardly any simple relationship between 'formal elegance' and use of the harmonic series, still less (though I know it scarcely needs saying) between Dillon's present prac- tice and any simple 'return to tonality'. The second line of questioning starts with the simple - though these days, in particular, crucial - aspect of 'marketing', but would quickly find itself embedded in a heavy discussion about meaning and values, were this article to have the space for it. For Dillon himself, the business of 'aggression' is straightforwardly dealt with: Ten years ago as you know (to my dismay), I found myself lumbered with a spurious 'angry' image with all its complicit 'anti's'; cultivated less by implication, than by the surface charac- teristic associated with gestural polemics, it may be a useful marketing ploy but I prefer to leave the 'bovver boy' image to others[.] God only knows there are enough successors willing to be neutralised by demands of the market. We may perhaps best engage at least one or two of the implications of this by passing on to the third line of questioning, with which we finally reach the point at which it might be possible usefully to reintroduce the postmodernist debate begun earlier. The reason for this is partly that to describe this music as 'aggressive' suggests too direct or at least too simple a link between Dillon's conceptions and intentions on the one hand, and the resulting musical 'product' and the way it is perceived by individual listeners on the other: or, as Dillon himself puts it, such notions are surely too anthropomorphic. And while this may be essentially true of all music, and all composers, it has, it seems to me, particular significance for many things about this composer's work, not least the ways in which discus- sion about its structure may be undertaken. Recent repeated listening to Dillon's String Quartet, (1983) - initially without the score (which is often more of a hindrance than a help, I find, to getting to grips with music of such 'Complexity') - suggested a degree of motivic structuring in the piece surprising in the work of a composer so apparently 'modernist', so 'angry', in his rejection of the paraphernalia of the past. Or rather (since I have arguably already confused conception and perception), the work's opening (see ex. 1) suggested a few fairly immediately audibly identifiable fragments (chiefly concerned with pitch, secondarily with rhythm), the memory of which helped to make sense of what followed, especially of how it unfolded (even developed) in time. Readers will have to believe me that this exercise was under way before encounter (though I must confess it was a re-encounter, after more than 18 months) with Toop's analysis of this work, which posits a firm, if in certain respects 'unorthodox', motivic basis for approaching it. While giving due acknowledgement to Wright's description of the work as a 'complex network of braids which overlap and interact'13 (arguably a rather modernist-sound metaphor), Toop goes on to analyse the work as 'not only a "discursive" quartet, but also - however eliptically - a thematic one, to a degree one would scarcely have expected from any of the other composers [Finnissy, etc.] discussed here."'4 One might even interpret the Quartet's final 'coda' as a kind of 'summing up', using concepts which rely so strongly on notions of recapitulation, thematic struc- turing and cohesion that even the work's more frag- mented moments (and there are several of these) seem somehow in the end no more than the expected 'fall-out' of a work involving a classically familiar process of tension and resolution. Perhaps, though, this is going a little too far. Cer- tainly, Dillon's own conception of the String Quartet turns out to be rather different: sufficiently different to make him uneasy about any 'motivic' approach, especially his own acknowledged feelings about the final sense of resolution, about which it is clear he is uneasy. On the one hand, he responds positively to the idea of 'narrative' in his music, or at least in this particular piece: comparing his idea of this to what he identifies as the 'modernist' one as both more traditional and less traditional. It's more traditional insofar as one associates narrative with, for example, the structure of myth or the structure of story telling, with a beginning, a middle and an end. ... But it was less traditional insofar as I wanted to create a kind of notion of directionality in terms of discontinuities, in terms of... the surface detail of what existed within that narrative - as not necessarily continuous. In fact, a kind of disrupted surface inside a narrative flow... In other words, I was maintaining the notion of a traditional narrative, but . .. through disruption rather than through continuity. This - arguably contradictory but also arguably quite deliberately contradictory - structure was apparently conceived not motivically but in terms of a formidable- sounding complex of technical procedures involving, it is true, a four-note chord which is seemingly, in its simpler and more linear appearances, responsible for the 'motivic' surface (as at the beginning: the G/A 'motif', for instance, started conceptual life - and is revealed elsewhere in the work - as the bottom and top notes, respectively, of that chord), but also a 'taxonomy' of relationships between the four instruments, 'the permutation of four morphogenetic fields... defined as a conflation of vectorial and scalar information', and much more besides. It seems, too, that the idea of the 'braiding' metaphor is Dillon's own: interestingly, this, again 'modernist'-sounding, notion came from plaiting his young daughter's hair, and the composer actually thinks it a good metaphor for all music. The idea that a certain kind of tension could be created - and indeed manipulated in all sorts of ways which are probably as 'difficult ... to unravel' as the composer says would be true of the 'rich mixture of systematic deduction (maintaining variety) and in- tuitive selection (maintaining disruption)' involved in writing the Quartet - by such means is surely a fruitful way of looking at this music theoretically. At the same time this music's 'cohesion' denies 'anger' no more than its composer's questioning of art as simple self- expression denies the possibility of something worth- while resulting when what would usually be thought of as 'modernist' techniqes are confronted with such things as Romantic notions of 'Grand Form' which the modernists had long since pronounced unrecover- able. Any idea that even such ill-defined notions of conti- nuity can confidently be applied to Dillon's output as a whole is, though, quickly thrown into doubt by the 13Ibid. 14Toop, op. cit., p.42. 256</page><page sequence="5">Ex. 1 String Quartet, bars 1-6.

This could, of course, be accounted yet more evidence for the espousal of a 'modernist' aesthetic. And more generally, as Arnold Whittall has pointed out, we at present lack any adequate theoretical base from which to discuss the structural procedures of contemporary music, even that which appears to trade in modernist ideas in return for a 'new' purchase on 'tonality'.15 Whittall uses theories involving 'contrast and connection', 'confron- tation and complementation' and 'synthesis and sym- biosis' to challenge the absence, in Toop's article, of 'a proper, i.e. theoretical, consideration of the aesthetics of structure, such as would help to create a clearer picture of where these four composers actually stand in terms of the development of the art in our time'.16 (Interest- ingly, too, he makes the attempt to connect his argu- ments to notions of postmodernism.) Since Dillon's music seems to resist any straightforward application even of such relatively basic notions as 'contrast and connection', it might seem foolhardy to raise the spectre of postmodernism as well. Yet it is tempting to specu- late on the extent to which possible contradictions - especially structural contradictions, or at least the theoretical possibility of contradictory structural 'read- ings' - can be accounted for by, say, Hal Foster's 'poststructuralist postmodernism', which, in the fine arts, 'launches a critique in which representation is shown to be more constitutive of reality than trans- parent to it',"17 as well as of an acceptance of what, for want of a better word, we may call structuralist (or perhaps it should be 'poststructuralist') thinking more generally. Especially on the level of form, Dillon's own argu- ments rely to some extent on accepting, and trying to take account of, the role of memory and recall, both local and what we may call 'cultural', in the listening process itself. Lberschreiten (1986) for 16 players, for instance, 15See Jonathan Dunsby and Arnold Whittall, Music Analysis in Theory and Practice (London: Faber, 1988), especially Whittall's chapter 'The Struc- ture of Atonal Music: Synthesis or Symbiosis?', pp.173-85; and Arnold Whittall's two articles, 'The Theorist's Sense of History: Concepts of Contemporaneity in Composition and Analysis', Journal of the Royal Musical Association, vol. 112, no. 1 (1986-7), pp.1-20 and "Complexity, Capitulationism, and the Language of Criticism', Contact, no. 33 (Autumn 1988), pp.20-23. 16Whittall, 'Complexity, Capitulationism, and the Language of Criticism', op. cit., p.20. 17Hal Foster, Recodings: Art, Spectacle, Cultural Politics (Port Townsend Washington: Bay Press, 1985), p.121. 257</page><page sequence="6">hardly conforms to any stereotypical notion of 'elegant form'. As the first in what at present remains an incomplete trilogy of works based on what the com- poser describes as 'Heideggerian notions of construc- tion', this London Sinfonietta commission seems to set out to blow apart all one category of memories: those accruing to the image, right or wrong, of this ensemble as the epitome of Establishment Modernism gone soft. Uberschreiten's title means, literally, 'overstepping', crossing over or transgression, so this particular interpretation of the work (not, I hasten to say, direct from the composer's mouth) seems somehow relevant. Yet it also does what Foster might describe as 'disclose a historical identity'.'1 Uberschreiten conforms more to the 'big bang' model of form than to any conventionally developmental notion of unfolding. Its basic material is the harmonic series based on the note E natural, which explodes from the full ensemble at the outset, constituting what the composer calls 'an initial state' which also in a sense remains 'steady', since some semblance of it is present throughout the work's 22 minutes, even though it surfaces clearly at only a few points. It is symptomatic that this Ur-material does not in any meaningful way separate harmony and timbre: among other things, this provides a valid basis for viewing, and hearing, Uberschreiten as 'texture music' underpinned by a much more secure foundation - both musically and intellec- tually, for want of better words - than music given that label tends to have. Dillon describes the early stages of what happens after the 'big bang' in terms of its decay, in the course of which inharmonic tones are gradually introduced (that is, notes which are not integer mul- tiples of the fundamental E natural). Any notion of conflict in this increasing dissonance is, though, under- mined by the low dynamic level, thus offering another way in which parameters can combine to create an effect quite different, if not opposite, to that which the direction currently being pursued by one of them would suggest: that is, 'dissonance', even given a clear context, is here not perceived as really being dissonant at all. The basic technique of Uberschreiten, that of 'con- tinually dividing and subdividing the chord and the proportions of that chord', as the composer puts it, is conceived by him as a sort of deconstruction of the chord or 'state'. This is where the attempt to harness, or at least take account of, the role of memory becomes most meaningful: while still accepting the harmonic series as what he calls a 'found object' - and thus in some way 'natural', as has so often been argued - Dillon also treats it as something which brings its own history. UIberschreiten represents an attempt, the composer says, to examine the relationship between these two inter- pretations of his Ur-material, which includes the accep- tance of the resulting harmony's tendencies to imply tension and release. There is, however, none of the focusing on small areas of the harmonic series which characterises some French 'spectral' compositions, and which can too easily lead to kitsch, as Toop observes.19 Ultimately, Dillon's use of the harmonic series formally in Uberschreiten seems actually bent on its destruction. But it is the way in which this 'deconstruction' is carried out - the extent to which the music allows one simultaneously to follow a 'cohesive form' and remain suspicious of both of the 'contemporary validity' of such cohesion and of its very existence in the work's unfold- ing - that at least starts the listener and the theorist on the path towards making sense, first of the moments 'where things are between order and disorder', as Dillon calls them, and then of the wider implications of this quotation which so interested Whittall. It is per- haps here that 'deconstruction' in a more rigorous critical sense can begin to mean something too, and to find its place musically in the postmodernist debate. helle Nacht (1986-7) for orchestra - the second work in a trilogy of pieces of which LUberschreiten is the first, and in several respects the composer's strongest work so far: not least in its revelation that Dillon can now compose stunningly well for large orchestral forces, which his ideas not only justify but arguably turn out to require - benefits considerably from the 'research' of Windows and Canopies as well as Uberschreiten. The final piece of the three, Blitzschlag (Thunderclap) - a flute concerto for Pierre-Yves Artaud - has suffered from the uncertainties to which commissioning is sometimes subject these days, and has yet to be written. Like Ferneyhough and others, Dillon has recently started to conceive his works in cycles. In part this is in order to achieve a closer match between what he wants to write and the vagaries of our commissioning systems. But it also seems to tie up with deeper notions of form, the most important of which is probably the one indicated by the title of the grand cycle Nine Rivers, on which he is at present working. Conceived in 1983 on the realisation that the percussion piece of the previous year, East 11th St NY 10003, could best be considered as part of a larger project taking the spatial concerns of that work into the logical 'next stage' of using elec- tronics, the eventual nine pieces of Nine Rivers (of which four are now complete) are all involved in some way with the idea of a river: with, to quote the Shorter Oxford Dictionary quoted in the composer's 1983 'Synopsis' for the cycle, a 'copious stream or flow of (something)' used 'euphemistically for the boundary between life and death 1790'. Dillon also links his application of this in Introitus, the most recent contribution to the cycle, to chaos theory. Scored for a variety of forces, the works in the cycle draw on a variety of imagery from poetry and philosophy; the 'Synopsis' also provides a complex 'colour scheme'. Introitus (1989-90) for twelve strings, tape and live electronics, the work Dillon has just completed for performance at IRCAM this month, is the composer's first piece to use electronics, breaking his previous apparent resolve to avoid the electronic studio on account of his concern for 'a peculiar and granular energy that emerges from the large number of variables contained within, and emanating out from, the media- tion of performance'.20 The tape part, which I have heard, was made at IRCAM and is largely based on string sampling; it promises to provide a suitably torrential complement to the live ensemble. A close integration of taped and live elements is promised via the live use of the same algorithms employed to generate the tape part to make a 'new live mix, so that every time you hear it, the work will be different'. Foster's 'poststructuralist postmodernism' - to return to our debate - is, like the 'postmodernism' of other theorists such as Ihab Hassan, posited as radical, and open to the charge that it is better to regard it as an extension of modernism rather than something diffe- rent; its 'profoundly anti-humanist' stance would pres- 18lbid. 198Toop, op. cit., p.47. 20Dillon, 'Speculative Instruments', op. cit. 258</page><page sequence="7">Ex. 2 Del Cuarto Elemento, bars 1-9. ;=84 scintillante ( e1p ) k/con energico e brillante ? &lt;:A,,,V.------- 1AA4'K Music examples reproduced by kind permission of Peters Edition, London, Ltd. London, Ltd. umably stand in the way of any straightforward reacceptance of such notions as 'Grand Form' anyway. It is, on the other hand, probably simply foolish to suggest that Foster's much simpler 'neoconservative postmodernism', with its 'return to narrative, ornament and the figure'21 and its humanist sympathies has anything to do with Dillon. (Further, I would question whether Whittall's application of the term 'post- modern' to the music of Nicholas Maw and Robert Simpson is to identify even a 'neoconservative' post- modernism; I regard Simpson's work, at least, as simply conservative.)22 But even if calling Dillon a post- modernist is considered pointless not only by those for whom any attempt at categorisation is pointless, but also plain wrong by some of those who, like me, accept that such categorisations are probably necessary to any kind of coherent reflection of our current musical situation (surely, they'd say, Dillon is a modernist!), there still perhaps remain ways in which it can be useful. Charles Jencks's idea of a postmodernism involving 'double coding: the combination of Modern techniques with something else ... in order ... to communicate with the public and a concerned minority'23 does seem relevant to a work such as Del Cuarto Elemento (1988) for solo violin. The work begins 'texturally', as it were (see ex. 2): and so high in pitch and sufficiently free rhythmically that its 'modernist credentials', in the crudest sense, are immediately asserted - they are virtually a 'given', anyway, if, as seems inevitable, the piece is played in an 'avant-garde context'. But, far more quickly than the above sentence takes to read, we are, surely deliberately, thrown into doubt by the com- poser. The music suddenly takes on a dancing quality: the fleeting regular rhythm and the (modal?) pitch sequence suggest some sort of folk dance, and the high register now says 'folk fiddle traditions' rather than 'avant-garde acrobatics'. In retrospect - and again I emphasise that all this has taken only a few moments to play - the previous little glissandi have become ambiguous: we thought they'd said 'Xenakis', but now it seems they might have meant '19th-century virtuoso violin concerto'. And so on throughout the work, which might formally be read as a very devious exercise in 'cohesion'. The feeling I have is that 'Modern tech- niques' in an ostensibly 'modern' context are being subverted. Irony plays a familiar part in this sort of postmodernism, to the extent that suspicions of kitch- ness are often aroused, and though Dillon himself disclaims the idea, I sense some ironic dimension to the exercise here. The music gives the impression of con- fronting the whole 'violin tradition' too, both 'classical' and 'popular'; and here one could argue that composer and commentator are in greater agreement, since Dillon - impatient with the 'modernist' premise of 'extended instrumental techniques' because of what he regards as their basis in 'secondary phenomena' extrinsic to the instrument in question's real concerns - admits to trying quite deliberately to engage the violin, in this case, on its own terms in some quite vital sense. However one goes about 'reading' Del Cuarto Elemento, it must be clear that the listener's experience of the past is crucial to the listener's experience of the present; and I 259 21Foster, op.cit., p.121. 22Whittall, 'Complexity, Capitulationism and the Language of Criticism', op. cit., p.22. 23Charles Jencks, What is Post-Modernism?

And if all this is considered as having your cake and eating it, theoretically, then the naughty (post- modernist?) thought occurs to me that it might only be by such strategies that musical theory finally catches up with musical practice in the 1990s. And with the contradictions which have started to emerge from the debate.
