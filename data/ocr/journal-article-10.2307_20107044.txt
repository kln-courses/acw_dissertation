<plain_text><page sequence="1">DIALOGUE On Narratology: Criteria, Corpus, Context GERALD PRINCE Over a dozen years ago, in a fine book called The Narrative Act devoted to the study of narration and point of view, Susan Sniader Lanser noted that narra tology (by which she meant "formalist-structuralist poetics of narrative"), in its exploration of narrative, paid no attention to sex or gender (she tended to use the terms interchangeably): "[N]owhere in modern narrative theory is there mention of the author's or narrator's gender [this vacillation too may be telling] as a sig nificant variable . . . [yet] surely the sex of a narrator is at least as significant a factor in literary communication as the narrator's grammatical person, the pres ence or absence of direct address to a reader, or narrative temporality" (46-47). A few years later, in a 1986 article entitled "Toward a Feminist Narratology," Lanser examined some of the reasons why the feminist and the formalist investi gation of narrative had ignored each other. For, just as narratologists paid little attention to questions explored by feminist theory and criticism, the latter hardly showed enthusiasm for narratology: feminist thinkers may have produced a lot of suggestive work on narrative (or linear narrative, or "bad" linear narrative) and?say?its "inherent" Oedipal configuration, but without much recourse to narratological claims, methods, and arguments. I will condense Lanser's account while recasting it and underlining its implications: (a) "everyday" terminology versus technical language, the attempt of (some) feminists to speak and write in ways understandable to everyone and thus implicitly to criticize the elitism, au thoritarianism, and protectionism of "science" including the attempt of narratol ogist to develop a special (scientific) vocabulary; (b) distrust of binary logic and of universals (as tools of the patriarchy, it hierarchies, exclusions, and repres sions) versus confidence in and reliance of them (as necessary to argumentation and basic to the enterprise of specifying the rules that govern all and only narra tives); (c) mimetic orientation versus semiotic approach, the view that narrative says something about and influences the world versus an interest in narrative as a meaning-producing instrument, with no consideration of how related or ade Gerald Prince is Lois and Jerry Magnin Term Professor of Romance Languages and Co Director of the Center for Cultural Studies at the University of Pennsylvania. He is the author of Narrative as Theme (1992) and is now working on a guide to the twentieth-century novel in French (to appear in 2001).</page><page sequence="2">74 Gerald Prince quate to the world this meaning is; and (d) sensitivity to context and emphasis on the role of sex or gender in the production and processing of (narrative) meaning versus bracketing of context (since narratologists aspire to grasp and analyze narrative qua narrative). Lanser's discussion of these incompatibilities was preliminary to a call for a feminist narratology whereby, she hoped, "feminist criticism, and particularly the study of narratives by women, might benefit from the methods and insights of narratology and . . . narratology, in turn, might be altered by the understand ings of feminist criticism and the experience of women's texts" (342). To start the movement toward such a revised narratology, to pose some of the questions and focus on some of the (textual) aspects that a sex- or gender-conscious study of narrative would have to confront and discuss, Lanser analyzed a short letter, al legedly written by an unhappy young bride to an intimate friend. Lanser's choice may have been perplexing (though willfully so). As she herself noted, the letter? which hardly made up a narrative in the usual sense of the term (it did not re port events; it did not tell about changes in states of affairs)?was probably apocryphal and no definite conclusions could be reached about its real author's sex; in other words, no definite conclusions could be reached about the possible influence of that sex on the nature of the text. But Lanser's analysis was interest ing, nonetheless, especially when bearing on questions of narrative situation, voice, and tone (because of the constraints on her gender, the unhappy letter writer had to resort systematically to indirection). Besides, more obviously perti nent examples could, no doubt, have been provided. In her 1986 PMLA article on the engaging narrator and then in her Gendered Interventions (an excellent study of narrative discourse and gender in the Victorian novel), Robyn Warhol showed that, contrary to what often obtains in male-authored or with male narrated fiction, an engaging rather than distancing attitude toward the reader or the narratee tends to prevail in female-authored novels or with female narrators. Lanser's call for what she depicted as an "expansive narratology" ("Toward A Feminist Narratology" 358) was criticized by Nilli Diengott, who argued in "Narratology and Feminism" that gender is not a differentia specifica of narra tive and that "there is no need, indeed, no possibility of reconciling feminism with narratology" (49), given that the former constitutes an interpretive, critical enterprise while the latter is a theoretical activity. In her response ("Shifting the Paradigm: Feminism and Narratology"), Lanser renewed her call for dialogue among "feminists, narratologists, and feminist narratologists" (59) and maintained that gender-inspired questions about the nature, scope, methodology, and goals of narrative poetics could lead to its positive transformation. In what follows, I do not consider?any more than Lanser did?what narra tology might bring to feminist- and gender-oriented narrative theory or criticism, though I will mention that, according to her, the "comprehensiveness and care with which narratology makes distinctions can prove valuable methods for tex tual analysis" ("Toward A Feminist Narratology" 346). Nor do I intend to ex plore the reasons for feminist "resistance" to narratology?advanced by Lanser and others, like Josephine Donovan who, in "Toward a Women's Poetics," in veighs against the formalist "dissection of literature as if it were an aesthetic ma</page><page sequence="3">Narratology and Context 75 chine made up of ... so many nuts and bolts easily disintegrated from the whole" (108; quoted in "Toward a Feminist Narratology" 342)?though I will say that at least some of those reasons strike me as nostalgic (the longing for a transparent language, the stance against "deathly science"), not particularly com pelling (the preference for strategies of "'both . . . and' but nevertheless 'nei ther . . . nor'"), and even misguided. Thus, arguments for the existence of universals need not be regressive (in fact, they sometimes have been and can be progressive) and beliefs in certain universals need not entail beliefs in others (I believe that all human beings die; I do not believe that all human beings enjoy Mozart); similarly, though they often constitute a symptom of or basis for preju dice, distortion, and repression, binary distinctions?on which I think we all de pend?do not necessarily lead to the creation of hegemonies and exclusions; besides, it may be relevant to point out that narratology does not always proceed in terms of simple binary differentiations?think of its account of narrative speed (and the/?ve canonical tempos which it isolates), or of narrative frequency (and its three basic modes), or of the tripartite investigation of links between narra tive, narrating, and narrated?and it may be relevant to point out also that nar ratology does not always exclude the middle (think of free indirect discourse). What I want to discuss, rather (not for the first time and mindful of the argu ments advanced by Lanser, Diengott, and others), is why some of the challenges posed to narratology by a category like "gender" should be addressed by narra tologists and how they might be assessed.1 It is important to note at the outset, I think, that the very domain of narra tology is (and has been) in flux and that the discipline keeps on changing as its boundaries are (re)drawn. Though narratology may already be old, it is still quite immature. As Michael Mathieu-Colas has argued, given that narratology is a theory of narrative, its scope depends, first of all, on the definition of narrative. When the latter is viewed primarily as a verbal mode of event representation (the linguistic telling of events by a narrator as opposed to, say, the enacting of them on stage), the narratologist pays little or no attention to the story as such, the narrated, the what that is represented, and concentrates instead on the discourse, the narrating, the way in which the "what" is represented. This view is certainly favored by some important dictionaries (e.g., the Grand Larousse de la langue fran?aise) and it may well have custom on its side: the latin term narrare desig nated a linguistic act and?in the Western tradition?the opposition between diegesis and mimesis, recounting and representing, epic and drama, narrative and theater goes back to Plato and is still very common. Furthermore, this view may well capture the specificity of a purely verbal rendition of events by a narra tor and, in particular, account for the many ways in which the same set of re lated events can be told?compare "Mary ate before she slept." and "Mary slept after she ate." or consider "John mounted his horse before riding off into the sunset." as against "John rode off into the sunset after mounting his horse." But this view neglects the fact that nonverbal or mixed modes of event depiction (e.g., movies or comic strips) are frequently taken to tell stories, to recount them, or are frequently referred to as narratives; besides, it tends to forget that the story too makes narrative whatever it is (after all, without story, without events,</page><page sequence="4">76 Gerald Prince without changes in states of affairs, no narrative). When, on the contrary, narra tive is defined not so much in terms of mode (a narrator narrating) or substance (linguistic as opposed to nonlinguistic) but rather by its object (events), the nar ratologist focuses on the structure of represented events and their possible com binations. But he or she might then neglect to account for the various forms a given story can take. There is?as usual?a third direction. If both story and dis course, narrated and narrating make up narrative, narratologists who define the latter as the representation (verbal or nonverbal, with or without a narrator) of one or more events can try to integrate and give equal importance to the study of the "what" and the "way." Of course, even if all narratologists agreed on a definition of narrative, they would still have to determine what in narrative is specific or relevant to narra tive. There is a lot more than narrative in narrative (comic power, psychological insight, tragic force) and narratology aspires to be a theory of narrative qua nar rative: it attempts to characterize all and only possible narrative tests to the ex tent that they are narrative (that they exhibit features distinctive of or particularly associated with narrative). Now, if narrative is the representation of events or changes in states of affairs, some temporal relations, say, are narrative-specific whereas comic power or psychological insight are not (since there are many? perhaps too many?narratives that exhibit neither and many non-narratives that exhibit both). But if comic power or psychological insight does not constitute a differentia specifica of narrative, the same can be said of character, of descrip tion, or even of focalization. Yet these three categories?especially the last one? have attracted a great deal of attention from narratologists. In other words, the argument against making room for an ingredient such as gender in narratological models on the grounds that this ingredient is not specific to?distinctive of? narrative hardly seems compelling. If the distinctiveness criterion is not determinative, what about the integral ity criterion? Narratologists pay (infinitely) more attention to a narrator's diegetic situation or degree of covertness than, for instance, to a narrator's sex or gender presumably because every narrator can be described as extra- or intra-, homo- or heterodiegietic and every narrator can be described as more or less overt or co vert but not every narrator can be characterized in sexual or gender terms (what is the narrator's sex in "Mary ate before she slept" or in "John rode off into the sunset after mounting his horse"? more generally, if narrative features and narra tological accounts constitute and designate a narrating agency, must this agency be gendered?) However, narratologists pay considerable attention to narrative space, say, though it is quite possible to narrate without referring to the space of the story, the space of the narrating instance, or the relations between them? consider "Jane spoke to Irma before she spoke to Sally." They pay even more at tention to characters though it is not difficult to find (minimal) narratives without characters, whether or not the latter are taken to be anthropomorphic con structs?consider "First it rained and then it snowed." In other words, the argu ment against making room for a feature like "gender" because it is not integral to narrative also proves unpersuasive. Besides, it could be argued that narrators and narratees must, like actors or characters, be gendered or not gendered and that this aspect of their nature can remain unspecified.</page><page sequence="5">Narratology and Context 11 Other criteria prove just as problematic. Simplicity, for example, is not only a function of the measures selected (number of elements used in the model, number of rules for combining these elements, diversity of the elements or the rules) but also a function of the results yielded (what if these are inconclusive or uninteresting?); and elegance?another frequently invoked criterion?should be left to the tailor. In the end, perhaps the most consistently applied and applicable criterion is that of productivity. The inclusion (after some reluctance) of such categories as character or description in narratological models was motivated and vindicated by their traditional and continued importance in "adequate" accounts of narra tive possibilities as well as by their capacity to be linked with or to raise narra tively pertinent problems (about plot structure, say, about narrative domains and energetics, about narrative speed and frequency). Now, sex or gender (and race, class, religion, age, ethnicity, sexual preference, or?and here I am resorting on purpose to seemingly trivializing features?height or weight) may prove to be just as productive (even if they do not have "tradition" behind them). In any case, it would be easy (or, at least, not difficult) to start incorporating them ex plicitly in a narratological model, for instance by subsuming them under the ru bric "distance" (the space obtaining between narrators, characters, events narrated, and narratees, a space that can be temporal, intellectual, emotional, etc.) or even?more radically?by subsuming that rubric under them (given the element gender, for example, such and such a set of distances may obtain). Just as arguments inspired by the wish to include elements like gender in narratological accounts can challenge the criterial basis of certain narratological decisions, they can put into question the actual nature of the narratological cor pus. Narratology tries to formulate rules pertinent to all and only possible narra tives. Ideally, its methods and reasonings do not depend on a particular set of narratives (great ones, literary ones, fictional ones, or even extant ones) and nar ratologists have been known to invent narratives in order to bolster their demon strations and prove their points. Still, there is a narratological canon, a set of texts repeatedly used as illustrations (La Modification for second-person narra tive, "Hills like White Elephants" for external focalization, "A Rose for Emily" for the homodiegetic narrator-observer, Ulysses for stream of consciousness). And this canon is undeniably androcentric: Robyn Warhol points out, for instance, that in my "Introduction to the Study of the Narratee," there are as many as eighty examples "and only two of them [I could have sworn it was three!] are from female-authored works" (Gendered Interventions 7). Now, narratology is indeed a theoretical activity but?since it constitutes an instance of "theory transitive" rather than "intratransitive"?it is far from indif ferent to critical enterprises (just as feminist critical practice is not detached from theories in general and feminist theories in particular). On the one hand, narra tology provides tools and ideas for investigations of specific texts and leads to so called narratological criticism, of which I think there are two main variants. First, narratological description can not only help to characterize the specificity of any given narrative, to compare any two (sets of) narratives, and to institute narrative classes according to narratively pertinent features, but it can also help to illuminate certain reactions to texts and it can hein to found or suDDort certain</page><page sequence="6">78 Gerald Prince interpretive conclusions. Indeed, as G?rard Genette's outstanding Narrative Dis course and a long tradition of (para-narratological) Anglo-American and Ger manic criticism centered on narrative technique demonstrate, any narratologically descriptive statement can become a springboard for a reading, any technical fea ture can lead to the construction of meaning, any how can give rise to a why. Second, by insisting that there is, in any narrative text, an autonomous layer constituting that which in the text is "properly" narrative, a configuration insti tuting events as such, fixing their beginning and their end, and presiding over the itinerary linking them, narratology facilitates the choice of narrative as defining pattern or as thematic frame. It provides many entrance points and reference points to the study of texts in terms of that pattern or that frame; and its influ ence explains in part the great popularity enjoyed by the theme of narrative in the past twenty years (the large number of critical essays arguing that such and such a novel or short story is, among other things or above all, a reflection on narrative) just as it explains in part the so-called narrativist turn (the reliance on the notion "narrative" to discuss a multitude of activities, fields, and texts, from political speeches legal briefs, and philosophical arguments to scientific proofs, psychoanalytic sessions, and L.L. Bean catalogues). On the other hand, these investigations of specific texts and domains, these enterprises in narratological criticism, in turn, test the validity and rigor of narra tological categories, distinctions, and reasonings, they identify (more or less sig nificant) elements that narratologists (may) have overlooked, underestimated, or misunderstood; and they (can) lead to basic reformulations of models of narra tive. Genette himself admitted that, in his synthetic exploration of narrative dis course, he paid little attention to certain possibilities because Proust had not (very much) exploited them in A la recherche du temps perdu (Narrative Dis course Revisited 12, 51). Thus, it can be argued that a modification of the narra tological corpus in favor of female-authored narratives, for example, may significantly affect the very models produced by narratology; and, should it turn out that such a change does not lead to an alteration of the models, the latter would be all the more credible, all the less open to negative criticism. If narrative poetics ought to be more alert to the implications of the corpus it privileges, it also ought to be more sensitive to the role of context?and, more specifically, say, to the possible role of sex or gender?in the production (or pro cessing) of narrative. This is probably the crux of Lanser's argument, the critical point made by any "expansive" study of narrative. The allegiance of classical narratology (the narratology of the sixties and seventies) to strategies inspired by structural linguistics or generative-transformational grammar (both of which are notoriously indifferent to context), the concern for capturing the differentiae spe cificae of narrative, and the "scientific" ambitions of the discipline (its desire, in particular, to isolate narrative universals, which transcend context) resulted in the narratologists' reluctance to make pragmatics part of their domain of inquiry and in their neglect of the contextual dimensions of narrative generation. But, by the end of the seventies, perhaps because of repeated (sociolinguistic) reminders about the importance of communicative contexts in semiotic production (or be cause of awareness that narrative can be viewed not only as an object or product</page><page sequence="7">Narratology and Context 79 but also as an act or process) and certainly because of the very logic and devel opment of narrative poetics, a number of narratologists (apart from Lanser) be gan to interrogate certain aspects of context more explicitly, if only to shed more light on narrative qua narrative. In Story and Discourse, Seymour Chatman de voted several pages to the number of parties one had to posit in order to account for the transmission of narrative messages; much more recently, in Narrative as Communication, Didier Coste developed a view of narratology as "concerned with the production, transmission, and exchange of information on change and simulacra of change" (5); and, on several occasions (e.g., "Narrative Pragmatics, Message, and Point"), I have stressed that narratological models ultimately should include?along with a syntactic, a semantic, and a discursive component?a pragmatic one. At least three context-related areas of investigation seem to me worthy of some discussion here. The first pertains to different media of manifestation and their expressive possibilities (as recently explored by Chatman, for example, in his Coming to Terms and, more specifically, in his discussion of the means by which verbal texts and filmic ones actualize various narrative features or favor certain ways of presenting them). Neither film strictly conceived ("moving pic tures" without linguistic or other semiotic accompaniments) nor written language finds it particularly hard to use diverse narrative speeds, frequencies, or points of view. But they differ significantly in their ability to utilize other features that nar ratologists have studied at length. Thus, it may be difficult for film to provide certain signs of extradiegetic narratees (what is the filmic equivalent of a sentence like "He bought one of those shirts that you, dear reader, would never even look at"?), or to take full advantage of the category "person" (how are differences be tween first-, second-, and third-person narration conveyed filmically?), or to ex ploit something akin to free indirect discourse. In other words, perhaps certain features can be actualized (more or less easily) by all the semiotic media whereas other can be actualized only by some or, even, by one. Indeed, there might be strong correlations between the mediatic exploitability of features and their "properly narrative" relevance (as experimental studies by Hans-Werner Ludwig and Werner Faulstich suggest, the use of first- as opposed to third-person narra tion in verbal narratives hardly affects the receiver's response) and narratologists should investigate the possibility. The second area pertains to tellability, to the qualities that make events worthy of being told. On the one hand, tellability must be tied to context. "Great topics" and "sure-fire themes" have, of course, long been thought or claimed to awaken narrative desire and have long drawn the attention of best-seller seekers. A sexist French formula for successful narratives valorizes the elements of mys tery, religion, sex, and aristocracy: "My God, said the Duchess, I am pregnant. Who done it?" (Ryan 154);2 and an old Readers' Digest recipe is supposed to stress?along with sex and religion?personal experience, foreign travel, money, and the animal kingdom: "How I Made Love to a Rich Bear in the Alps and Found God." But money, sex, or even religion do not always play equally well in Peoria and Landernau; and the pointedness or pointlessness of any narrative varies with the circumstances of its reception. On the other hand, some narratolo</page><page sequence="8">80 Gerald Prince gists, in exploring what in a semiotic object foregrounds its narrative nature, have attempted to show that tellability (or narrativity as distinct from mere nar rativehood) results in part from certain aspects of the object qua object. In my own work, for instance, I have argued that the narrativity of a text depends on the extent to which that text constitutes a doubly-oriented autonomous whole which involves some kind of conflict (consider "The cat sat on the mat" versus "The cat sat on the dog's mat.") This autonomous whole, furthermore, is made up of discrete, particular, positive, and temporally distinct actions having logi cally unpredictable antecedents or consequences, and which avoids inordinate amounts of commentary about them, their representation, or the latter's context (Prince, Narratology: The Form and Functioning of Narrative). Similarly, in her splendid Possible Worlds, Artificial Intelligence, and Narrative Theory, Marie Laure Ryan not only shows that an adequate model of plot must represent the relational changes obtaining among the constituents of the actual narrative world (what is true in the story) and the constituents of the characters' private worlds (the virtual embedded narratives fashioned in terms of their knowledge, wishes, obligations, simulations, intentions, or fantasies); she also argues that "not all plots are created equal" (148) and that narrativity is rooted in the configuration of these changes and specifically, in "the richness and variety of the domain of the virtual" (156). In fact, Ryan even distinguishes between a "theory of tellabil ity," accounting for potential narrative interest, and a "theory of performance," accounting for actual narrative appeal (148-49). But, given the difficulty of the question of such interest or appeal, much more testing and investigation are no doubt needed to determine the input of text or context in the production of tell able narratives. The third area?and perhaps the most relevant?is that of narrative seman tics. As Ryan's work emphasizes, narrative intelligibility is based upon the links, in the narrative universe, between a world designated as real and a set of virtual worlds (more or less adequate representations, perceptions, and notions of the "real" world). To explain what governs narrative meaning, the narratologist must therefore establish a map of the worlds making up the narrative universe and de scribe the conventions or devices allowing for the specification of their alethic value, their truth coefficient. Now, the propositions composing a narrative and its worlds can be distinguished on the basis of their origin (as signified by the text). There are, on the one hand, those which the narrator expresses: they pre sent or report certain states of affairs and certain series of events in a certain world (the diegesis); they comment on them; or they comment on the presenta tion itself and its context. On the other hand, there are the propositions which a character in the diegesis formulates and which also can refer to that diegesis: clarify it, comment on it, or remark on its presentation. In terms of the narrative, and barring any textual indication to the contrary, the world described by the narrator constitutes the world as it is, whatever its correspondence to our own world (or the way we imagine it). If, for example, the narrator declares that Van couver in the capital of France, that Napoleon won the battle of Waterloo, or that Ulysses was very naive, each one of these declarations represents a fact in the narrative universe, if not in our own. Note that their truth does not necessar</page><page sequence="9">Narratology and Context 81 ily depend on the homo- or heterodiegetic status of the narrator. What Philip Marlowe and Mike Hammer say of the environment in which they move about and of their adventures in that environment is no less true (in terms of the rele vant world) than the statements of the heterodiegetic narrator of Middlemarch or those of a CNN announcer on the finals at Wimbledon. Similarly, incoherent commentaries by the narrating voice, as well as deceptive or erroneous explana tions and illogical conclusions (according to the text itself), do not always call into question the veracity of the propositions which present the diegesis. They cast doubt on the interpretive powers of the narrator; they do not necessarily de prive him or her of other powers. In Jim Thompson's Killer Inside Me, for in stance, Lou Ford is a psychopath, but the geographical information he gives us about Central City is no less correct. On the contrary, a narrator's (repeated) hes itations concerning what is, avowals of ignorance regarding ontic matters, presen tations of existents or events according to a point of view designated as (suspi ciously) subjective, all weaken his or her authority, his or her ability at authenti cation (to use Lubomir Dolezel's term), and call into question the truth of the propositions composing the diegesis (and of the comments pertaining to them). As for the propositions formulated by the characters, their truth coefficient de pends above all on their conformity to what this voice says explicitly about them, or on the reliability of the characters themselves. In other words, however accu rate these propositions may be in our world ("Paris is the capital of France," "Na poleon lost the battle of Waterloo," "Ulysses was very cunning"), they are true, textually speaking, only if they do not involve any contradiction to the state ments of the reliable narrator, if they are not designated by him or her as sus pect, untrue, or fictitious, and if their source proves generally trustworthy. Obviously, the situation can often be quite complex. One frequently finds in a narrative several narrators and many characters. Besides, it is not just a matter of setting up distinctions between them in terms of their authority or reliability. It is necessary to classify all the propositions (and their relations) according to their degree of veracity and the latter depends of the number and importance of the textually true propositions or relationships which are contradicted or con firmed. Let/? and q be two propositions?formulated by a character?the first of which does not contradict any true proposition whereas the second contradicts a single one. All other things being equal, it can be said that p but not q is in con formity with the textual truth. The same would obtain even if/? did not confirm any other propositions and q confirmed a dozen. Suppose now that p contradicts only one true proposition, but one entailing numerous consequences in the narra tive universe, and that q contradicts two or three propositions having no conse quences at all. One could then maintain, perhaps, that p is less close to an over all textual truth than q. But there are thornier cases. Suppose, for example, that p and q contradict only each other and that one of them confirms more proposi tions that the other. Should we consider (on the ground that the narrative would thereby gain richness and coherence) the former true and the latter false? In the same way, suppose we find two or three unimportant contradictions in the narra tor's discourse. Should we then conclude that he or she is not trustworthy or should we simply speak of absentmindedness or trivial miscalculations? What</page><page sequence="10">82 Gerald Prince ever decisions are made, they will no doubt affect what the narrative means and, though narratologists do not have to choose (since their goal is not to determine the meaning of particular texts), they must be able nevertheless to indicate in their models that narrative meaning sometimes depends on such decisions (just as they must be able to indicate that certain narrative passages can function as iterative or singulative narration, as free indirect or narratized discourse, as chro nologically or causally governed). In other words, they must be able to make room for (the voice of) a variable and extratextual determiner.3 As my quick discussion suggests, narratology can and must be cognizant of context. But there remains a significant distance between the exploration of con textual features to understand what is "properly narrative" or to construct a model in which the pragmatic dimension is not forgotten and the kind of "expansive" narrative poetics that Lanser, for instance, calls for. In "Toward a Feminist Nar ratology" Lanser states that narratology ought to "study narrative in relation to a referential context that is simultaneously linguistic, literary, historical, biographi cal, social, and political" (345). Similarly, in her 1992 book entitled Fictions of Authority, where she explores how women writers strive, with the help of narra tive structures, to create fictions of authority while exposing them, Lanser states that these structures should be analyzed in terms of the power relations "that implicate writer, reader, and text" (5). Both statements are, I think, more relevant to (narratological) criticism than to narratology. The latter attempts to character ize the ways in which all and only narratives are configured and make sense rather than the forms or meanings of specific narratives in specific circumstances. It can indicate that narrative configuration or signification is a function of con text. It cannot specify how a certain form or meaning results from a certain context; it cannot list the infinity of possible contexts or exhaustively describe most of them; it cannot, in particular, state how the sex, gender, height, or weight of a producer or consumer, a writer or reader, affects the production or processing of narrative from and content. Still, statements and enterprises like Lanser's help to remind us that, with out yielding to the interpretive temptation (without conflating criticism and po etics) and without renouncing the ideal of a description of narrative and its pos sibilities that would be explicit, systematic, and universal, narratology should strive for more self-awareness, flexibility, and attention to the concrete. It is on this condition that it will perfect the fit between its models and the texts they en deavor to characterize and that it will find a place in a generalized semiotics.4 ENDNOTES 1.

A more developed argument is presented in Gerald Prince, "Narratology, Narrative, and Meaning." 4. This paper was presented at the 1994 International Conference on Narrative Literature in Van couver, B.C. At the same conference, a good panel discussion moderated by Kathy Mezei and Melba Cuddy-Keane raised the question "Why a Feminist Narratology" anew, through short presentations by the panelists, Janet Giltrow, Susan Stanford Friedman, and Robyn Warhol. The discussion tended to characterize the pair "formalist narratology/feminist narratology" as a mem ber of a series including: sentence/discourse, text/context, totalizing/specifying, formalizing/politi cizing, similarity/ difference, construction/deconstruction, sedentariness/nomadism (one might add grammar/rhetoric, form/force, and so on). As for the speakers, they suggested shifting back and forth between positions, trying to combine them, or trying not to occupy any of them. WORKS CITED Boden, Margaret.
