<plain_text><page sequence="1">FRIEDRICH SCHLEIERMACHER'S EARLIEST ACCOUNT OF RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE MARTIN H, PROZESKY It is well known that Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768-1834) provided an influential account of religion in his famous work On Religion : Speeches to its Cultured Despisers, issued anony mously in 1799.(1) It is a flawed account but still a brilliant one with much illumination for the contsnporary student, besides anticipating seme of the insights of several leading subsequent thinkers and providing a potential conceptual bridge between the western and eastern religious traditions. And yet his account is largely unknown, especially in non-German circles, for four main reasons. Firstly, both of the English translations of Schleiermacher's famous book are based on the third German edition of 1821, which departs fran the original in seme import ant ways, as did the second in 1806.(2) Secondly, several key terms are rendered misleadingly in these translations. Thirdly, Schleiermacher was not always the best ccnmunicator of his own intentions and insights, seme of which are recoverable only frcm his personal papers. These are seldom consulted. Fourthly,a severely unreliable picture of his religious philosophy was disseminated by Protestant neo-orthodoxy with its profound (if respectful) dislike of Schleiermacher's ideas.(3) So there exists the regrettable situation that one of the most impressive modern theories of religion is presently known only to a relatively small circle of investigators while the majority continues to believe (wrongly) that Schleiermacher defined religion in purely subjective terms and as a type of emotion, divorced theology fran knowledge and action, sacrificed God to Spinoza and by paving the way to Feuerbach indirectly prepared for Marx's rejection of religion. My aim in this paper is therefore to present and discuss the core of Schleiermacher's little-known original account of religious experience. Because of the strongly contextual character of his Speeches on Religion brief sketches of its context and Schleiermacher's personal orientation are prefaced to the presentation. Thereafter the Speeches are introduced arid their central passage is given in translation, to my know ledge for the first time in English. Finally, there is a critical discussion of Schleiermacher1s views in relation to 71</page><page sequence="2">72 contemporary interests in the study of religion. THE CONTEXT : CRITICAL REASON UNDEFMININ3 CONFIDENCE IN RELIGIOUS BELIEF The century frcm 1750 to 1850 in which Schleiermacher's lifetime falls brought sane dramatic changes to European life and thought. In politics the French revolution and the Napoleonic Wars initiated far-reaching changes to the style of government and the map of nations. Mechanized industry radi cally altered the economic base of society and created the novelty of a mass urban proletariat. Science continued to advance, carried by the powerful mcmentum of classical physics and inspiring confidence in man's powers of independent dis covery. The church, once the standard-bearer of intellectual eminence, steadily lost its hold on the European mind. This decline in the intellectual hegemony of Christianity is a matter of cardinal importance because it provides the setting in which Schleiermacher evolved his theory and defence of religion. Philosophy and science both challenged religious beliefs. They did so by criticizing logical and factual shortccmings in Christian doctrine, by suggesting rival ways of understanding the universe and especially by encouraging people to rely on their own critical investigations and reasoning, a far cry frcm that faith in the pronouncements of others which large sectors of Christianity have required in their adherents. Of this development - criticism of ecclesiastical religion and its doctrines on the part of independent thinkers - there are seme vivid exaitples frcm which two may be cited. The first is provided by David Hume (1711-76) who ended his famous essay On Miracles with the following verdict : "I am the better pleased with the method of reasoning here delivered, as I think it may serve to confound those dangerous friends, or disguised enemies of the Christian religion, who have undertaken to defend it by the principles of human reason. Our most holy religion is founded on Faith, not on reason ... Mere reason is insufficient to convince us of its veracity, and whoever is moved by Faith to assent to it, is conscious of a continued miracle in his own person, which subverts all the principles of his understanding ..."(4) Noteworthy here is the alleged dichotomy between faith and reason and the insinuation that Christianity is closed to the rational. My other example is Intnanuel Kant (1724-1804), whose first major work, the Critique of Pure Reason (1781; 2nd revised edition, 1787) advances an impressive vindication of scientific</page><page sequence="3">73 rationality (which Hume had challenged) but also severs meta physics and traditional religious belief frcm human knowledge, besides subjecting the classical attempts to prove the existence of God to a deadly philosophical fusillade. The human ability to know, held Kant, is not and cannot be the doorway to religion, being confined in its efficacy to the phenomenal realm. Trans cendental entities are beyond its ken. "I found it necessary to deny knowledge in order to make roan for faith" he declared.(5) Sane have seen this denial of cognitive underpinnings to religion as an epitaph to the Christian mind, notwithstanding Kant's later attempt to anchor ethical theism in the postulates of moral ex perience in his next work, the Critique of Practical Reason (1788) . But Schleiermacher, a university student when Kant re-issued his first Critique, came to see in it a fundamentally mistaken view of religion. In Hume, Kant and others like them we see the traditional conception of and case for Christianity under fire by sane of the foremost thinkers of the day. It is for this reason that we may epitcmize the situation confronting the young Schleiermacher as an undermining of religious belief by critical rationality. In so far as a similar state of affairs still exists, our cwn day shares important cannon ground with that of the Berlin thinker. SCHLEIERMACHER'S PERSONAL POSITION : THE DEVOUT DOCTRINAL CRITIC Schleiermacher's own experience echoes the drift of intellectual events just described, partly because he was well aware of the climate of opinion then obtaining and partly because he him self began to detect logical problems in certain basic Christian doctrines while enrolled in his late teens at the Barby seminary of the Moravian Brethren. Moreover, he chose to leave the seminary rather than stifle his doctrinal reservations.(6) In short, he knew at first hand that Christian doctrine was by no means exenpt frcm the undermining attentions of critical reason. And yet, unlike Hume or Kant, his primary loyalty was to Chris tianity. But hew does a Christian thinker retain religious allegiance, let alone reccmmend it to others, when serious doubts exist as to its rationality? Such, broadly, was the main issue confronting the young Schleiermacher. His parents, his Moravian educators and others had introduced him to the satisfactions of Christian fellowship and worship, giving him a cherished experience of what ecclesias tical idian calls a redeeming ccmnunity. Its ability to engender well-being in him he thus knew at first hand.(7) But the other part of his religious diet was the usual course in Christian doctrine. This he found far frcm nourishing. Hew could God possibly intend eternal punishment for a creature who fails to achieve a perfection manifestly beyond his capabilities,</page><page sequence="4">74 he pondered? And should he who called himself the Son of Man be upheld as the true, eternal God? Were the criticisms of leading thinkers and writers not prima facie evidence of doc trinal imperfection in Christianity? These and other questions refused to vanish and drove him in 1787 frcm his Moravian educators with their mental isolation to the free play of ideas at the University of Halle.(8) We have here the dilenma of a person refreshed by Christian fellowship but doubting the quality of its intellectual ex pression. In a religion that has frequently defined itself precisely in terms of doctrinal conformity, this naturally presents an acute problem. Are the doubts to be repressed for the sake of the fellowship, or mast the fellowship by sacrificed to intellectual integrity? Can faith warm but never really illumine, and reason illumine but never really warm? Or is there a middle way providing both ccmfort and enlightenment? Schleiermacher believed there was. All his work can be seen as a charting of that middle way, an alternative to the dis junction between fideism and rationalism so cunningly exploited by Hume, retained by Kant and lionized in Barthianism. The main requirement of such a middle way would be so to account for religion that its practical benefits can co-exist with a critical rationality which exempts nothing frail its attentions. Only so can it hope to survive sustained logical and factual evaluation. What Schleiermacher needed for him self and his contsnporaries was thus a religious formula capable of accomodating doctrinal criticism. His younger days were given to finding and publishing that formula in the first edition of the Speeches on Religion. THE SPEECHES ON RELIGION : ADVOCATING RELIGION IN AGE OF CRITICISM As the title of his famous book indicates, Schleiermacher addressed his advocacy of religion to those who rejected it in the name of intellectual sophistication. After all, it was their loyalty the churches were losing. He was well placed for such a project. Himself no stranger to doctrinal criti cisn, he could understand their rejection and being acquainted with the enriching pcwer of religion, he had something to oatmsnd to than. In any case, he knew his intended readers personally, for after moving to Berlin in 1796 the young thinker, by then an ordained minister of the Prussian Reformed Church, gained admission to the literary and intellectual elite in the capital. The rcmantic outlook was then establishing itself, tendering the austere rationalism of the enlightenment with an awareness of the limits of human reason and prizing the ideal of a well-rounded personality in which feeling and imagination received due attention. Religion as purveyed by the churches was scorned, though there was seme interest in</page><page sequence="5">75 Kant's recently published philosophy of religion, which Schleiermacher had studied in detail. People with views like these became his regular intellectual companions. He relished their sophistication but deplored their renoteness from the things he held were the core of religion. They admired his intellectual ability and pressed him to issue his ideas on religion in print. In 1798 an opportunity to do so arose and a year later his book appeared. His tactic in it was to convince the cultured despisers of religion that personal wholeness was unattainable without religion, correctly under stood, using their own literary idiom and canons of argument. Conventional theological jargon was thus generally avoided and the traditional attempt at a rational defence of Christianity was completely ignored.(9) This is scarcely surprising in a theory that marks a fresh phase in the history of religious ideas in the west, a theory directly related to the problem of a religion uncongenial to critical thinkers. The Speeches are thus the literary deposit of a twelve year quest for a view of religion resilient enough to embrace intellectual dissidence. They do so by conceding validity to such dissidence but denying religious centrality to the areas of dispute : doctrine and action. So Schleiermacher rejected the view that religion is essentially a matter of belief or behaviour, or a combination of both. Instead he defined its core as a vision and feeling of wholeness generated by love, as one might sumnarize the gist of his theory in its earliest form. The book comprises five discourses. The first is pre paratory. The third, fourth and fifth, dealing respectively with the cultivation of religion, its social expression and its historical manifestations are of secondary importance in the present article. It is the long second speech with its discussion of the essence of religion that concerns us. RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE : A VISION AND FEELING OF WHOLENESS GENERATED BY LOVE The important second discourse in the Speeches carries the title "The Nature of Religion" and makes four main points.(10) Firstly, religion always appears in conjunction with other things, never on its own.(11) Secondly, it is therefore frequently mistaken for the things that most often accompany it, metaphysics and morality.(12) These are rooted in thinking and acting, but religion, thirdly, has a different, independent, seat in the human constitution. "Its essence", wrote Schleiermacher, "is neither thinking nor acting but perceiving and feeling. Religion would perceive universality, the totality of things ... Religion sees the infinite3 its imprint, its manifestation, in all people and all other finite things."(13) Fourthly, beliefs and doctrines, including belief in God, are not strictly speaking</page><page sequence="6">76 proper to religion at all.(14) Obviously the pivot of the account is the third point, that man is religious in virtue of perceiving and feeling universa lity, a vision and feeling of wholeness amidst the multitude of specific experiences mediated by our senses. In the original text this formula is given as Ansehauung und Geftihl des Univer sums, and presents same perplexity because Schleiermacher occasionally used Ansehauung to signify sensory or phenomenal perception while otherwise using it for that theory-laden act of perceiving (to use later terminology) in which previously acquired notions enter into the business of seeing. This second-named use corresponds, of course, to the usual meaning of the word as "a way of seeing something", and may also be expressed as "vision" (in its metaphorical sense) and "percep tion", which is sufficiently equivocal for service as an alternative rendering of Ansehauung and is certainly preferable to Oman's "intuition".(15) While the Latin roots and earlier English usage of intuition also express the act of looking at or into an object, in contemporary idicm intuition means immediate apprehension by the mind without sensory input or rational inference frcm empirically obtained premises. This severely obscures Schleiermacher's empirical intentions. T.N. Tice, on the other hand, translates Ansehauung as "per spectivity", losing through inelegance of expression what he gains in accuracy. My preference is thus for "perception", "vision" and "way of seeing things" as renderings of the term in question. Schleiermacher was well aware that this expression was central to his theory, calling it the highest and most general formula for religion (16) and giving it detailed, if at times obscure, elaboration. Relevant sections of that elaboration are reproduced hereunder in translation(17) : "All perception involves an influence by the perceived on the perceiver ... If an anission frcm a light source - a phencmenon that happens quite independently of you - did not impinge upon your eye, if the smallest parts of a material did not affect your finger-tips mechanically or chemically, if the pressure of something heavy did not reveal to you a resistance and limit to your strength, you would perceive and observe nothing.(18) Thus what you perceive and observe is not the nature of things but their effect on you. What you know or believe about those things lies far beyond the realm of perception.(19) "So also religion. The universe is ceaselessly active and reveals itself to us all the time ... and thus to acknowledge all individual things as parts of the vhole, all finite things as manifestations of the infinite, that is religion. But</page><page sequence="7">77 whatever tries to proceed beyond this and penetrate deeper into the nature and substance of the whole is no longer religion and will inevitably lapse into empty mythology if it nonetheless tries to pass for religion. "Hence it was religion when the ancients, transcending the limitations of space and time, saw all living things throughout the world as the operation and realm of an cmnipresent being.(20) They had seen a particular operation of the universe in its unity and therefore characterized their vision of things as the work of such a being. It was religion when they gave a speci fic attribute and built a special temple to their god each time the eternal laws of the world happened to reveal themselves clearly in sane facourable event. They had grasped an operation of the universe, and characterized it in this way. It was religion when they elevated themselves above the rigid inflexi bility of their time and sought the golden age of Olympus in the merry life of the gods : this was their way of seeing the ever moving, ever-living and vibrant activity of the world and of their spirit ... "But when they made a marvellous chronicle of the lineage of these gods or when a later faith produces for us a long series of emanations and begettings, that is mere mythology. "To represent all events in the world as actions of a god, that is religion because it expresses the concern religion has with an infinite whole. Brooding over the existence of such a god before and beyond the world may be good and necessary in meta physics. In religion it is but empty mythology, an elaboration of what is merely a representational aid as though it were reality itself, a complete departure frcm the realm of religion. "Perception is and always will be scmething quite specific. It is immediate observation and nothing else. To synthesize perceptions into a totality is not the business of the senses but of abstract thinking. So with religion. It ranains a matter of directly experiencing the life and operation of the universe, a matter of individual perceptions and feelings, each of than independent and without dependence on or connections with others. Of deductions and connections it knows nothing; and nothing is more alien to it than these. Eveything is immediate in religion and true for it ... Whoever truly under stands his religion will subordinate all conceptual systems to specific experiences and will not sacrifice even the smallest of than to such a systan. "Therefore the range of perception is endless. Place yourselves at the furthest point of the material world. Not only will you then see familiar things in a different arrangement, and not only will you be completely wrong if you cling to previous, arbitrary impressions which do not belong there, but in new areas you will also discover completely new things. Nobody's horizon is wide enough to embrace everything. And nobody's vision is pene trating enough to detect everything ...</page><page sequence="8">78 "Even more so in religion. Frcm a contrary standpoint you would not only see things anew in a new area, but even in your original position earlier experiences would unite themselves in other interpretive forms and everything would be different "Religion is in all respects infinite; an infinity of matter and form, an infinity of being and an infinity in the ways of seeing and knowing. This feeling must accanpany all who are genuinely religious. Each must know that his is only part of the whole, and that there are ways of construing the things that affect him in religion just as devout as his yet quite different. He must knew that there are ways of seeing and feeling which proceed frcm other aspects of religion beyond his ken.(21) "You will thus see that ncdesty and tolerance belong to the very nature of religion. How unjust, then, is your charge that religion persecutes and is malicious, that it disturbs society and lets blood flew like water! Ascribe these offences to the people who pervert religion, who engulf it in philosophy and shackle it to conceptual systans. For is it not precisely over metaphysics and morality that partisanship and hostility occur, over morality occasionally and over metaphysics contin ually? But neither of than belongs to religion — "The netf Rccne, godless but consistent, hurls out its anathemas and casts out its heretics. The old Pane, truly religious in fine style, welcomed every god and so abounded in deities. Those who cling to the dead letter, which religion denounces, have filled the earth with tumult and shouting. Those who truly contemplate the eternal are, however, peaceful, either on their own with the infinite or tolerant towards the ways of others who also understand the living word. Possessing this broad outlook and this feeling of the infinite, they res pect that which lies outside their own personal sphere and are capable of universality in their judgements and ways of thinking ... "Only the desire for an all-embracing vision can free the spirit. Only religion can save the spirit from the most despicable fetters of opinionation and greed ... Religion is thus the sole sworn eneny of all pedantry and one-sidedness.(22) "Finally to complete this general account of religion, remember that every perception is inherently linked with a feeling. Your sensory organs mediate the connection between an object and yourselves. The same influence whereby an object reveals itself to you must stimulate those organs and create a change in your inner consciousness.(23) "So too with religion. The same operation of the universe in which it reveals itself to you in the finite realm also generates a new relationship of the universe with your feelings; and in so far as you perceive anything at all you must be grasped by feelings ...</page><page sequence="9">79 "Just as your particular way of seeing the universe determines the character of your religion, so the strength of the accom panying feeling determines its degree. The more healthy the senses, the more sharply and clearly will each sensory impression be. The more ardently persistent the desire to grasp the in finite, the richer will one's feelings be, the more thoroughly will they be suffused by the infinite, the more completely will they be penetrated by those impressions and the more easily will they recur and eclipse all others. "And that is the limit of religious feelings. We must have those feelings. We must express them, hold on to them, articulate them. But to go any further, so that they issue in actions, is to enter a different domain altogether. And if you persist in regarding action, however wise and noble, as religion, then you will have sunk into unholy superstition. Actions should and can be roral, and religious feeling should accompany all human activity like sacred music.(24) We should do all things with religion but nothing from religion ... That is why seme of the most deeply religious people, in the absence of other reasons for acting, forsake the world and devote them selves entirely to restful contemplation This entire misconception, that religion comprises actions, is none other than a terrible abuse which cannot fail to end in trouble and disorder " Before proceeding to show hew religious perception and feeling are stimulated by nature and especially by love, Schleiermacher digressed briefly to allege that despite the need for separate expositions of perception and feeling, they in fact belong together and originate in a fleeting mcment of conscious ness at every sensory stimulation.(25) His thesis, then, is that our perceptions of the world around us necessarily involve an activation of the nervous system and are experienced 'as a modification in our existing state of consciousness. Every perception thus entails a feeling. This fleeting experience unites the subject mentally with the environing world of which he is ontologically a member, and is seen as the tap root of human consciousness. Because of its unitive character this fundamental state of awareness is holistic. It is a vision and feeling of wholeness. And if this is the truth about religious experience, then religion cannot fail to exclude both metaphysics (and indeed any cognition whatever) and morality, since both entail not a sense of wholeness but a sense of division in the form of the subject-object distinction. The rest of the third step in Schleiermacher1s discussion of the nature of religion is devoted to shewing hew our sense of wholeness is called forth by nature and especially by humanity. It is the regularity of nature's workings that is decisive, this being evidence of unity in the environment and</page><page sequence="10">80 a mandate for our notion that there is a universe.(26) Much stronger in its ability to generate a vision and feeling of wholeness, however, is humanity and above all, love. "To have a vision of wholeness, to be religious, one must first have found humanity, and one finds humanity only in and through love" wrote Schleiermacher.(27) Is this all there is to religion, human love and natural order, disclosing to sentient beings the ultimate universality of things? Schleiermacher, wary of metaphysics, tried to con fine his account of religion to the empirical, but the Speeches nonetheless include an intriguing hint that more is involved in religion than just humanity, in the following words : "To an intimation of something beyond and transcending humanity all religion strives."(28) As we shall soon see, this transcendent focus of religious striving was not be equated, for the Berlin thinker, with the concept of a supreme being. And this brings us again to the fourth point in Schleier macher 's discussion, his denial that beliefs and doctrines are strictly speaking religious items at all, including the belief that there is a God.(29) He defined doctrine as an abstract expression of religious perception, a reflection upon religious experience but not itself religious. Doctrines and beliefs arise frcm our capacity for thought, not frcm perception and feeling, and mast therefore be alien to religion in Schleier macher 's understanding of it. The same must of course hold for the doctrine of God. Theism is one airong many ways of seeing things, contingent upon various factors, above all on the character of one's dominant images of reality. These vary frcm place to place and frcm time to time. In a word they are culture-specific, to use contemporary idicm for Schleiermacher1s foreshadowing of a central datum in the sociology of knowledge. Extremely interesting is his account of the personified theism of most western religionists.(30) It arises, he claimed, whenever one's dominant image of reality is characterized by a sense of freedom, personal existence being our leading model of freedom. For such a person, reality will thus be seen as supremely personal. This is valid so long as the contingent character of the perception is recognized, which is, alas, seldom. It is essential to notice that Schleiermacher is here offering an explanation for a concept, a mental model; he is not denying the existence of the reality that seme people choose to call divine and to think of under the image of a sovereign personal being. His view was that there is indeed a divine life operative in the universe but that it need not be conceived or seen as a supreme, personal being. On this view the belief that such a being exists is assigned to the sphere of meta physics (and in Schleiermacher's judgement, a rather modest metaphysics; perhaps even mere mythology), and nost theists would be guilty of conceptual idolatry, reifying and</page><page sequence="11">81 worshipping a contingent form of understanding as though it were ultimate reality. None of Schleiermacher's ideas has disturbed fellow Chris tians more than this, and it has brought on him charges of atheism and pantheism. Yet this is one point at which his theory offers a potential bridge between the non-theistic and theistic religious traditions. In any event he ended the speech by saying that "God is not everything in religion; God is one thing; universality is more."(31) CONCLUDING DISCUSSION To sunmarize : for Schleiermacher religion involves a type of consciousness. Fundamental to all other types, it is an awareness of the ultimate unity of all things, an underlying sense of universality or wholeness. Its subjective basis in the human constitution is thus our sentience, which Schleier macher regarded as anterior to the human capacities for knowledge and action and as comprising perception and its accompanying affective state of feeling. Not being rooted in knowing or doing, religion cannot thus be equated with meta physics or morality. Its objective basis is however not readily accessible to the experiential method of the Speeches and is thus hardly discussed in the book, but enough is said to hint that it lies in an antecedent coherence of all things which the religious consciousness discloses to homo relig-iosus. (This notion bespeaks a monistic tendency in Schleiermacher's ontology and explains his later rejection of the dichotomies of much Christian thought, especially that between nature and grace.) As for beliefs and doctrines, these owe more to human thinking than to the religious consciousness and are thus regarded as very much the outer trappings of religion which arise through reflection on that consciousness by means of whatever concepts and images a given culture affords. The concept of a personal supreme being is thus but one way of conceiving reality in its ultimate inclusiveness, a variable in the inventory of religion rather than the constant most theists believe it to be. Before evaluating this earliest version of Schleiermacher's theory of religion, I want to draw attention to seme important aspects of it. To start with there is the use to which it is put in the Speeches, namely an advocacy of religion as indis pensable to personal wholeness even in an age of cultured despisers. Then there is its close contact with prevailing intellectual interests, above all romanticism and Kant's critical philosophy. Schleiermacher clearly presupposes Kant's work with its metaphysical agnosticism and ethical theism. He accepted the former but rejected the latter, which partly explains his denial that religion is a matter of either metaphysics or morality. The romantic element in the Speeches shows itself in various additional ways : in the literary style of the book,</page><page sequence="12">82 in its forthright contempt for abstruse intellectual systems, and in its ideal of human completion. Another reflection of prevailing intellectual fashions is the tripartite faculty psychology Schleiermacher adopts. Much more than with Kant or romanticism, this definitely restricts seme of his ideas to a pre-Freudian currency. A third feature of the theory is its marked emphasis on universality and wholeness.(32) Schleiermacher never justifies this policy, though it would not be difficult to do so, given the personal satisfactions of a sense of wholeness and the philosophical value of the notion in classical Christian thought, which construes the divine simplicity as undivided wholeness, with implications of omnipresence and thus, ultimately, of the inclusiveness Schleiermacher was at such pains to emphasize.(33) No less important than this is the way the theory accom modates conceptual relativity, allowing and indeed welcoming a process of doctrinal modification in the light of increased and improved knowledge. There can be no doubt that intellectual progress has haunted many religionist; Schleiermacher's formula was intended to find a way of exorcizing this still-present problem and it succeeds in doing so. Success of course has its price: a major revolution in the assessment of religious priorities on the part of conventional theists, for whom religion is nothing if not grounded in the reality of a personal God. Also noteworthy is the way most of the stock criticisms of Schleiermacher miss the mark. His theory is clearly not merely subjective; its whole point is to insist on a larger reality than the religious subject. Nor does it reduce religion to mere emotionalism, though Schleiermacher's imprecise expression contributes to that misunderstanding. It is also misleading for commentators to say that he separates religion frcm science and philosophy, since most people do not share his view of religion, thinking of it instead as inherently involving beliefs and doctrines. These he quite definitely does not separate frcm science and philosophy. More subtle are the charges of atheism and pantheism, for they presuppose as absolute a theistic con ceptuality which he believed was contingent. Perhaps it is fair to say that those whem he regarded as conceptual idolaters can regard him as an atheist. But it is simply wrong to allege that Schleiermacher denied objective reference to the term God. And therefore his theory does not lead willy-nilly to Feuerbach and Marx.(34) The accusation of crypto-Marxism is especially bizarre: Schleiermacher claimed that true selfhood was im possible without religion, Marx that it was impossible with religion. These remarks must not be allowed to blind us to genuine weaknesses in the Speeches on Religion. Its basic terminology is far frcm satisfactory, as the many later revisions indicate; there are logical shortcomings in the argument and seme important</page><page sequence="13">83 factual omissions. The main logical problan is the inconsis tency between Schleiermacher1s separation of religion from metaphysics on one hand, and his definition of religion as a vision of universality on the other. What is universality if not a metaphysical concept? To rstedy this, later editions of the Speeches define religion as a feeling of wholeness; Anschauung recedes to the background and ultimately vanishes altogether. Schleiermacher thus continued to separate religion from metaphysics and morality, and sought consistency by adjusting his definition of religion. I, for one, would have preferred a reversal of tactics. As for his factual emissions and weaknesses, three seem especially regrettable. They are religious ritual, the objec tive reference of words like God, and above all the beneficial effects of religion carmonly called salvation. Salvation is much more important in religion than the Speeches allow, for all their concern with wholeness. These are not superficial shortcomings, but they are balanced by the many strengths in Schleiermacher's account. His theory can explain the imrense variety of religious beliefs and can accomodate conceptual relativity and doctrinal criti cism. His insights prefigure many important ideas in subsequent thought, whether in Wittgenstein, Husserl, holism, Heidegger's mit-sein or the sociology of knowledge. He was the first, to my knowledge, to centralize the notion of wholeness in the modern philosophy of religion. His implicit ontology has strong affinities with Whitehead's philosophy of organism, while the brief account of deity in the Speeches is valuable for its bold recognition of the rudimentary anthropomorphism so dominant in much western theism, no small achievement by a thirty year-old thinker in 1799. It is also to his credit to have initiated an experiential approach to the discussion of religion, appealing to considera tions capable of corroboration through experience, and to have posed implicitly a question of quite exceptional importance for all who deal with religion: what in it is map and what is countryside? Finally, Schleiermacher's view of religion is a potential bridge between the hitherto diverse religions of mankind, recognizing in than a cannon vision of wholeness, presently construed by means of the separate and different conceptualities of the various cultures of mankind. On this view, these religions do not appear as rivals but as variations of a single theme, and perhaps also as the headwaters of a canton stream.</page><page sequence="14">84 REFERENCES 1 German : Vber die Religion : Reden an die Gebildeten unter ihren Vera.eh.tern.

Not retained in subsequent editions and hence not in Cman and Tice. 14 Ibid, pp.H4ff. Cf.

I have used paragraph and sentence breaks to relieve scmewhat the daunting blocks of solid prose in the original. 18 This in itself gives the lie to the charge of subjectivism often levelled at Schleiermacher. 19 Cf. Kant's denial that we have knowledge of das Ding an Sich, things-as-they-are. 20 Schleiermacher actually uses the expression "seeing-as" (ansehen als - Piinjer, p.59) , so anticipating a favourite thane in seme contanporary philosophy of religion, which stems of course fran Wittgenstein's discussions in his Philosophical Investigations (Oxford, 1953 : 1968) p.l93e. 21 It is here that the potential of Schleiermacher's theory as a bridge between the Indian and European religious tradi tions first shows itself by positing varieties of religious vie,is as quite proper to religion. 22 Schleiermacher here sounds an important point : religion is necessary for personal wholeness and freedem. It was of course a clever tactic : his readers prided themselves on their all-round accomplishment; by showing that only religion can furnish it he uses their cwn values to carmend the very religion they despised. 23 In later works Schleiermacher made the analysis of conscious ness the centre-piece of his religious philosophy. In so doing he pioneered a methodological ploy that has since developed in continental phenomenology. Cf. E. Husserl, Ideas : General Introduction to Pure Phenomenology (Halle, 1913; London, 1931), especially pp.112ff.

We may have an echo here of his Moravian days: church music was exceptionally rich in their worship. Ibid., pp.75-80. Ibid., pp.82ff. Cf. Cttan, pp.63ff and Tice, pp.lllff. Ibid., p.94. Cf.

It is interesting to note that Schleiermacher used the term Universum 166 times, whereas Gott occurs only 56 times. See F. Hertel, Das theotogische Deriken Schleiermachers (Zurich, 1965), pp.295ff. Cf. David B. Burrell, Aquinas : God and Action (London and Henley, 1979) p.16, and Robert R. Williams, op. cit., passim. (See note 3.) This is vigorously demonstrated by Robert R. Williams in "Schleiermacher and Feuerbach on the Intentionality of the Religious Consciousness", in Journal of Religion, Vol. LIII, 1973, pp.424ff. Dr. M.H.
