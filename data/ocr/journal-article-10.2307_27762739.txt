<plain_text><page sequence="1">PETER COCOZZELLA Salvador Espriu's Prophetic Mode: The Voice of a Historicist Persona Figura eminentemente representativa de la generaci?n de la Guerra Civil (1936-1939), el autor catal?n Salvador Espr?u (1913-1985) se distingue por la extraordinaria amplitud de su visi?n, que Josep M. Castellet, siguiendo la teor?a de Northrop Frye, denomina, "enciclop?dica.*' El sincretismo y sincronumo, rasgos esenciales de esa vision enclicop?dica, encuentran su cabal realizaci?n en la conciencia de Salom de Sinera, personaje que a h largo de la producci?n de Espriu desempe?a una funci?n de factor centralizador y unificador especialmente como alter ego art?stico del autor. Portavoz por antonomasia de una orientaci?n vital pol?tica y socialmente comprometida, Salom se proyecta, por lo com?n, en el papel del profeta m?tico, que, a guisa de h?roe tr?gico unamuniano, logra desprenderse del "pozo" abismal de su existencia hasta enfrentarse con el Demiurgo todopoderoso en la din?mica de un di?logo personal entablado en tono de reto. Durante ese di?logo el discurso (o la voz) de Salom adquiere una dimensi?n "historicista" que me propongo indagar en este ensayo. Qu?iera hacer ver que el "historicismo" de Espriu, encarnado en Salom, por un lado, arranca de ideolog?as unamunianas a la vez que evoca el principio de Ortega y Gasset - "cada vida es un punto de vista sobre el universo" - relativo al enlace metaf?sico entre el individuo y el cosmos; por el otro lado, se explaya en una dial?ctica multiforme en la cual entran en juego la perspectiva prof?tica y la mesi?nica - la primera proyectada hacia el ambiente m?tico a temporal, la segunda enfocada sobre la circunstancia hist?rica, limitada por el tiempo y el espacio. Al fin y al cabo, la modalidad prof?tica de Espriu hace frente no s?lo a la ambicionada simbiosis entre el Ser Supremo y el ser humano sino tambi?n a la tensi?n complementaria entre la visi?n apocal?ptica del formidable demiurgo exterminador y la expectativa de un salvador, emisario de la divinidad. Salvador Espriu (1913-1985) belongs to the Catalan contingent of that group of Spanish authors - commonly known as the Writers of the Generation of 36 - who came of age during the Civil War and, revista canadiense de estudios hisp?nicos Vol. XIV, No. 2 Invierno 1990</page><page sequence="2">210 naturally, bore, firsthand, the brunt of that internecine conflict.1 Despite a political climate, which became anything but propitious to the survival of his ancestral culture, Espriu, elaborated throughout his career a sizeable production in prose and verse exclusively in his native language. A unique blend of staunch, quintessential Catalanism and an unmistakable cosmopolitan outlook have won for Espriu undis puted acclaim at home and a steadily growing recognition abroad. Together with J. V. Foix, Merc? Rodoreda and, to be sure, some other leading Catalan authors of the twentieth century, Espriu deserves a high rank among the outstanding literary figures of the Western World. In underscoring Espriu's universal appeal and comprehensive scope, Josep M. Castellet brings to light incontrovertible evidence attesting to this Catalan author's masterful recapturing and re-creation of the "encyclopaedic" mode postulated and extensively studied by Northrop Frye (cf., especially, pp. 52-67 and 315-26): No es tracta, dones, de donar, amb els indicis que el poeta ha escampat per la seva obra, una mostra de les seves prefer?ncies liter?ries o cultur?is, ni una relaci? d'afinitats significatives, sino d'una temptativa de creaci? d'ali? que Northrop Frye denomina una Torma enciclop?dica', ?s a dir, un g?nere literari el simbolisme del quai adopta una forma anag?gica -?s a dir, que eleva l'obra a la categoria de totalitat unit?ria-, com en els casos de les grans epopeies classiques (orientals o occidentals), La Divina Comedia, El Paradis Perdut, etc. (84) The same critic and other perceptive students of Espriu's works provide a key to the overall design of Espriu's ingenious production, characterized not only by the assimilation of disparate literary ingredients but also, more significantly, by, in Castellet's own words, "una temptativa m?s ambiciosa: la d'inserir la pr?pia obra en la consteliaci? de les grans creacions de la humanitat, sobre la base d'integrar tot el pass?t cultural en el present, de contribuir constructi vament a la prolongaci? del continuum historie, de crear una obra liter?ria en cada una de les ?tapes de la quai bateguen les ?tapes posteriors i hi s?n presents les anteriore" (84). These critics identify, from the outset, in Espriu's art, the two foremost traits, which I would label, for want of better terms, "syncretism" and "synchrony." On the one hand, the overall drive of syncretism is inherent in the very cosmic sway of Espriu's creativity - his "univers creacional," as Salvat calls it (274) - which bespeaks the author's uncanny ability to mold into an organic whole sources as diverse as the Bible, Greek and Egyptian mythologies together with</page><page sequence="3">211 elements derived from the "theologia negativa" and from the aesthetics of the Baroque (Castellet 83-138). Salvat argues, convinc ingly, that this same syncretic aspect, which Espriu derives, in all probability, from Cervantes' aesthetics of amalgamation - "el gran exemple de cuina liter?ria que ?s l'obra cervantina" (268)2 - accounts, all the while, for yet another telltale sign of the influence that Castilian literature exercised upon Espriu and other members of his generation; which, incidentally, Salvat identifies with the year 1934. On the other hand, synchrony refers to a peculiar dynamic of recurrence and expansion, whereby, as suggested in Castellet's passage quoted above (84), the same nucleus of motifs appears, time and again, virtually at every stage of Espriu's production, albeit at varying degrees of unfolding and from variable perspectives. The sense of simultaneity, effected by this process of reiterative creativity and constant interplay of unity and variety, theme and variations, is apt to intrigue many a reader. Salvat quotes Capmany's observation to the effect that Tobra d'Espriu es produeix en un avan? en espiral recollint, a cada nova etapa, no ja sols l'experi?ncia anterior, sin? temes i situacions que s?n novament, ?mpliament i m?s profundament explicades" (268). Then, he concludes: Tota 1'obra d'Espriu, sigui quin sigu? el genere que empr?n, ?s el producte, o una diversa revelaci? d'una mateixa realitat creacional. En Espriu, dones, cal recordar que la seva obra ?s un nueli que va llan?ant cercles conc?ntrics d'expansi?, que van ampliant-se a mesura que avan?a Tobra. (269) Lanciani, for her part, arrives at an insightful epitome of the previous criticism on Espriu's complex articulation of the principles of unity and diversity throughout his career: Un'opera, dunque, essenzialmente unitaria, ma anche poliedrica e pluridi mensionale in cui lo scavo ermeneutico del critico incontra di continuo insospettate condensazioni e stratificazioni sotterranee ardue da identificare e da connettere tra loro, in cui l'unit? ? il risultato di un costante, puntiglioso ripensamento combinatorio di tessere musive che non di rado sono di prove nienza eterogenea. (361) Doubtless, the syncretic/synchronic creativity of Espriu has received undisputed acknowlegment and ample critical commentary. Not so extensively recognized is the all-important dynamics of tension which, in my opinion, accounts for the cohesiveness of Espriu's entire "univers creacional." As I have shown on another occasion (cf. my "Ronda de Mort a Sinera"), it is, I believe, Ricard Salvat who provides</page><page sequence="4">212 the best approach to the tension he intuits between the centripetal and centrifugal forces operative at the very heart of Espriu's aesthetic. In his remarkable mise-en-sc?ne of Ronda de Mort a Sinera, a superspe ctacle fashioned out of miscellaneous texts culled far and wide throughout Espriu's production, Salvat, who unites the intuition of a brilliant literary critic and the achievements of the leading director that he is of the post-Civil-War Catalan theater, keenly envisages and dramatizes the principle that reconciles the aforementioned forces in the emergence of a central poetic consciousness. To this consciousness Salvat bestows a "local habitation and a name," that is, a living theatrical presence in the persona of Salom de Sinera, who turns out to be Espriu's artistic alter ego par excellence. At heart, Salom or Shalom, as I would prefer to call him,3 is an "agonistes" in the sense in which Unamuno employs that word. Deep down, then, at the metaphysical level, he is engaged in the minute-to minute, life-and-death struggle (agon?a, to borrow from Unamuno's common terminology) in order to assert his existence, and, thus, come to a sense of survival. He is, truly, the cynosure of Espriu's poetic cosmos, or, to put it differently, the fixed point of reference for any contemplator of that poet's gran teatro del mundo. In this paper I shall attempt to gain an insight into the principles of cohesiveness that account for the unity of Espriu's cosmic vision through the position of absolute centrality accorded to the author's persona. One striking aspect of Shalom's characterization, which has received little attention from the critics, is precisely the ingenious way in which Espriu employs his brainchild as a mouthpiece of his political concerns and overall social awareness. Even at the risk of overstating the obvious, it bears pointing out that Espriu is, undisputedly, an engag? writer or un escritor comprometido, to use the stock terminology. This designation could hardly come as a surprise when applied to Espriu or to any author of his generation, deeply affected, as we have seen, by the war and by the disastrous effects it wreaked especially upon the Catalan community. As Carles Miradles points out, critics agree that it was precisely the war and its aftermath which stirred Espriu's deepest sensibilities and shaped his consciousness as a poet (37), There is a distinctive aspect of Espriu's compromiso, and that consists in the wide range of its expression. At times, Espriu's artistic doppelg?nger, embodied predominantly in Shalom, voices his immedi ate reaction to his circumstances. This is the phase of Espriu's meditations on the surface level of history. At this level, the author expresses his concern about the contemporary events of special significance or utters his criticism of the political situation in as</page><page sequence="5">213 straightforward a manner as circumstances will allow him. As I myself have stated on another occasion apropos of Espriu's Weltanschauung: Shalom's strong penchant for criticism verging on sarcasm stems from his inability to distract his attention from the painful realities of the day. In reaction to the prevailing atmosphere of political oppression, his bitter asides and repressed commentaries - which, of necessity, must find an oblique expression - resound with a strange ring of self-reproach and exude little sympathy for the plight of contemporary Spanish literati and intellectuals (among whom, of course, Shalom includes himself), schooled by dire circumstances to become adept censorship dodgers and reduced to ignoble acquiescence to the whims and dictates of the powers that be. ("Ronda de Mort a Sinera" 312-13) If we turn our attention to more specific cases in point, we will soon realize that, at the uppermost level of his social awareness, Shalom shares with many contemporary Hispanic authors - whether they write in Catalan or in Castilian - a love-hate bond with the Motherland - a relationship stemming, I would submit, from reiter ated quixotic dreams of bringing some amelioration to the stifling atmosphere that the literati witness as pervasive throughout the nation. Shalom, then, is steeped in the ambiance of frustration and disillusionment that a perceptive critic such as Paul Hie readily descries in many if not all the representative writers of '36: "one senses a trace of guilt on the part of the poet, as if he were imagining an accusation on the peasants' faces, a fantasy that originates in his feelings of guilt and inadequacy over not helping them in their need Thus the poetry of this Generation suggests not only political failure but the failure of intellect in general" ("The Poetics of Social Awareness" 118-19). In the light of the aforegoing remarks, one would not call into question Espriu's deepseated empathy with the other members of his war-torn generation. Espriu and his colleagues well might have appropriated Unamuno's memorable exclamation: "?Me duele Espa?a!" Nevertheless, beyond these generational affinities, the dark mood of pessimism, not unlike the feeling of baroque desenga?o, precipitated by the pangs of self-criticism and, as Paul Hie points out, by the sense of collective guilt and inadequacy, affects Espriu in a truly distinctive way, as it seeps deeper and deeper into his consciousness till it reaches a metaphysical level, replete with far-reaching philosophical and, even more significantly, religious implications. More often than not, Shalom retreats into himself and becomes the exemplary ensimismado. We now realize that, characteristically, even</page><page sequence="6">214 as Shalom delves into the deepest level of his awareness as a man of letters, as a Spaniard with a distinctive Catalan conscience, as a citizen of the world and, finally, as a human being pure and simple, Shalom's reflective penchant becomes more and more pronounced as a function of what Octavio Paz would call "la dial?ctica de la soledad." In his equivocal attitude both of sympathy and of alienation toward the human community, Shalom reenacts the atavistic pattern which Paz discerns in the "twofold motion of withdrawal and return," postulated, in turn, by Toynbee as a constant in the history of mankind (cf. Coco zzella, "Ronda de Mort a Sinera" 314-15). A few quotations will suffice to illustrate Espriu's passage from the surface level of social awareness to the deep stratum of a sustained poetic meditation on the condition humaine. We may begin with one of the circumstancial compositions of the late 60s, "Vietnam," which strikes us as the fruit of an immediate reaction to a problematic, highly disturbing situation. The straightforward rhetoric, patterned after the speech of the common man, is the diaphanous medium which confronts us directly with the impact of the crisis not the less frightening for having flared up on the other side of the globe. Having introduced himself in a rather unassuming tone: Jo no s?c jove i sempre he vist al meu voltant la injusticia i la por. (84)4 the poetic persona acquits himself of some bitter criticism of his own country: Malvisc en un pa?s que no ?s lliure, cansad?ssim, cruel, corromput, molt covard. (84) and, in conclusion, drives home the disheartening message of his reflections: Despert? a oc a oc i en silenci contemplo la gran foguera encesa al lluny? sud. Vergonya i deshonor de tots els pobles, arreu s'escampar?</page><page sequence="7">215 i en ella ens cremarem. Ara alg? ho ha compr?s, per? aviat, de seguida, tothom coneixer? que som del tot perduts. (85) The author has chosen to broadcast, as loud as political realities will allow him, a cry of protest to the powers that be and a note of warning to the population of Spaceship Earth. Espriu's genuine alarm in the face of momentous events that determine the reckless course of history toward ultimate self-destruction, finds a voice in the engag? literary mode, in the language and style of commitment which strikes frequent notes throughout his production. Naturally, this contempla tion that occasionally, assumes a worldwide scope, comes to focus more sharply upon the ills that afflict the author's native land. As early as 1931, Dr. Rip, protagonist of Espriu's homonymous novel, delivers a depressing diagnosis of those ills: La nostra vergonya s'emmiralla en una antiga tirania paral?tica, i si des de tants segles la patim sense alliberar-nos-en, ?s que en som m?s complices que victimes. (13) In 1964, in the speech of the "L?cid conseller" that Espriu adds in the revision of the original 1939 text of his Antigona (Badia 12), the remarks of collective self-accusation are not any less poignant. The conseller inveighs with vitriolic irony against the irresponsible silence of those, himself included, who could and should take on a role of leadership in combating the abuses of all the Cr?ons of this world: I com establir i repartir, dones, amb n?tida precisi?, des d'aquest moved?s nivell com?, responsabilitats i culpes? La responsabilitat, per exemple, del nostre silenci, fill tant del que s? que anomenes la meva distanciada lucidesa com del que permetr?s que qualifiqui de temor, el teu temor de desplaure al nou rei. Confessa que ha est?t c?mode al teu espant d'apuntalar-se en la meva recomanaci?. (102-3) Going back to the year 1950, we find that, in the short story "El meu amie Salom," included in the second edition o?Ariadna al laberint grotesc, Espriu's reliable artistic alter ego, in much the same vein as the "L?cid Conseller," confesses his disappointment with both Konil?sia and Lavinia - the fictional terms he has devised, respectively, for Catalonia and Barcelona. Shalom addresses the reader:</page><page sequence="8">216 Vosaltres, que sou d'un pa?s normal, entendreu amb dificultat el que passa en aquella remota contrada. Els konilosians, gent d'una historia gloriosa, altrament com les histories glorioses de tothom, varen rodolar i encara rodolen per un pendent d'una decad?ncia inacabable. (95) Echoing Unamuno, Shalom well may cry out: "iMe duele Catalu?a!" Shalom, of course, is fully aware that his self-deprecation as well as the Conseller's "distanciada lucidesa" can only set him on the road to malaise, alienation and utter desolation, away from the wellbeing of a lost paradise, only to be regained through a strong sense of communal integration. Instructed by the age-old mores of the so-called "con tanta vanidad como inexactitud, hombre primitivo," Octavio Paz points out that "para el hombre primitivo salud y sociedad, dispersi?n y muerte, son t?rminos equivalentes" (185). Small wonder, then, that a sensitive soul like Shalom, Espriu's portrait of an "hombre primitivo" of sorts, dead to the world, withdrawn from a sympathetic contact with individuals of flesh and blood, is inclined to indulge in Apocalyptic visions, as the one evoked in Poem XLI of La pell de brau (1960): La covarda gana del fill de retorn barriga en deixalles que no volen porcs. El pare li llanca pedr?s de perd?, sopa de doctrina amb llardons de mots. Encetava el pr?dig un tendr?ssim dol: si fameges, mira de semblar ja bo. (OC 371) In this lurid scene - the reference is, obviously, to the parable of the Prodigal Son (Luke 15.11-32) - the ethos of repentance and forgiveness inherent in the Gospel message has been turned on its head. Even after his return, the repentant son is regaled with leftovers not fit for pigs and with that soup, not less repulsive for being metaphorical, made of doctrine mixed with larded words. And the attitude of his father who "hurls rocks of forgiveness" at him can bring him anything but comfort. These details will soon convince us that this is quite different from the Gospel story; here Espriu's creative imagination projected into Shalom's consciousness performs a function much similar to that of the mirrors of Cat's Alley (El callej?n del Gato) described in the unforgettable Scene 12 of Valle-Incl?n's Luces de bohemia. It is precisely through these mirrors, we may recall, that the blind Max Estrella "sees" the grotesque parade of the classical heroes of old.</page><page sequence="9">217 MAX. -Los ultra?stas son unos farsantes. El esperpentismo lo ha inventado Goya. Los h?roes cl?sicos han ido a pasearse en el callej?n del Gato. DON LATINO. -?Est?s completamente curda! MAX. -Los h?roes cl?sicos reflejados en los espejos c?ncavos dan el Esperpen to. El sentido tr?gico de la vida espa?ola s?lo puede darse con una est?tica sistem?ticamente deformada. (132) In much the same fashion, it is through the distorted reflection of his own mind that Shalom reproduces the exact reverse of Luke's compelling parable. What we witness here is, in effect, the final stage of a process: the drastic transformation of the aesthetic objectified in Shalom de Sinera's way of perceiving his own circunstancia. If, in a poem like "Vietnam," we are able to cut through the diaphanous rhetoric and focus directly upon the outside world, in the aforementioned segment of La pell de brau and in many other similar compositions, we feel our attention caught by the poet's eye itself, which has become a medium of the esperpentic distortion. Let us look, then, through the poet's eye, within Shalom's labyrinthine inner world and ponder upon the factors that have driven him through that "distanciada lucidesa" to detach himself from workaday realities, while taking refuge in the gloomy reveries of his solitude and in the mythic realm of his own making. As we ponder, we may ask: What are the inner workings of Shalom's mythic fantasies? What are the main factors at play in his habitual broodings? Above all, Why is it that Shalom feels compelled to withdraw into his laberinto de la soledad in, of all places, La pell de brau, which has been rightfully acclaimed as the high point in Espriu's career and as an epoch-making book precisely because it proves to be the epitome of the characteristics of the literatura comprometida of his entire generation? I hope that I will be able to shed some light on the paradox apparent in Shalom's overall idealistic assertion of a close attachment to his people, even while in practice he isolates himself from them. Before attempting to elucidate this paradox, I should like to submit here, by way of hypothesis, that Shalom's compulsive ensimismamiento closely parallels and ultimately reflects a cyclic phenomenon recurrent as a leitmotif of Espriu's entire production: the cycle I would call "the rise and fall of the prophetic persona." In the poem "Les oliveres" - included in Mrs. Death (1952) - Espriu highlights in no uncertain terms the epiphanies of this all-important personage: Secrets llavis m'imposen</page><page sequence="10">218 l'enigma que anomeno viure. Jo, solitari llegidor de prof?tics vols de falcons, voldria guiar tan dolorosos somnis dels altres homes cap a clarors llunyanes d'aquell cel. Si em deixaven servir el trist, el d?bil pas de ven?uts i fer-ne mort militar, amb altes banderes tremoloses de la ciutat salvada! Aleshores ja foren eis meus versos com llances immortals, i l'imperi d'eterna Hum vindria per velia plata d'arbres. (284) This intriguing, if improbable combination of clairvoyant leader, philosopher, poet, warrior all in one reminds us of Joan Maragall's highly idealized portrayal of his good friend Miguel de Unamuno, as reflected in the letters he addresses to him: Le veo como el ?ltimo h?roe en pie de una batalla perdida, rodeado de cad?veres y de ruinas humeantes, irgui?ndose todav?a, aunque ya solo y profiriendo aquella gran voz de desaf?o a Europa y al siglo. (Maragall's letter of Dec. 21, 1906; Unamuno-Maragall 48) and Ya le dije que V. se me figura como un profeta de Israel, y los profetas de Israel los imagino siempre llegando al extremo fin de la edad. (Maragall's letter of March 25, 1911; Unamuno-Maragall 90) In Espriu this romanticized notion of the prophet lingers in the mood of melancholy which suffuses some rare poems (such as No. xxiv of Hibre de Striera, 1963), and at times, this very patriotic fervor appears laced with elegiac resignation as in "La can?o del mari encalmat" (El caminant i el mur, 1954): Sota la Hum clement del mati, a la casa dels morts del meu veil nom, die avui: "S?c encara."</page><page sequence="11">219 M'adormir? dem? sense por ni recan?a. I besar? Tor nou la serenor del marbre. (324) At other times, as in the justly renowned "Assaig de c?ntic en el temple," also of El caminant i el mur, the note of impassioned patriot ism gives vent to the love-hate dialectic which has become a veritable trademark of Shalom's moody expression: Oh, que cansat estic de la meva covarda, velia, tan salvatge terra ... (337) Of special significance are the aberrant manifestations of Espriu's prophetic persona. In at least two crucial cases, this persona assumes virtually superhuman powers and a distinct aura of pernicious influence, which the author takes special care to project outside the pale of Shalom's central consciousness. Thus, Espriu's Muse gives birth to the figure of the energumen incarnated in two formidable female characters, namely the Catalan Laia and the German Ulrika Th?us. Depicted in one of Espriu's earliest works - the novel, first published in 1932, which bears her name as a title - Laia embodies an essential, atavistic, instinctual will to power, an animal magnetism of sorts that casts a diabolical spell upon those who come into contact with her. As her suitor Anton finds out much too soon, the closer the contact, the more devastating the consequences. Unsuspecting victim of the sheer power of her piercing glance, Anton literally withers away and, eventually, is driven to suicide: La mort es va confondre despr?s amb eil i ja va ser substancia seva i, amb tot, externa, impersonal i freda com un pur concepte trist, com un desig de no desitjar. Que arrelada que Tendevinava! I no hi havia pens?t mai, fins que top? amb els ulls d'aquella dona, uns ulls que Tendinsaven en la solitud, des d'on assisti al naixement i al poder d'aquella d?ria ... Esdevenir altre cop Thome d'abans, ara que tant comprenia? Rodolar pel pendent de la passio i de Tespera, quan Toreig dels cims ja Tenlairava? Un pas, i entrava en la placidesa. Un pas senzill, min?scul, i entrava en aquell regne inalterable de la mort. (64) Doubtless, passages like this must have inspired Manuel Montoliu, one of the earliest reviewers of Laia, to dwell, quite appropriately, upon the protagonist's overwhelming presence:</page><page sequence="12">220 L'autor ha coHocat, enmig d'aquella Henea d'humanitat inconscient i irresponsable que ha enfocat amb la seva cambra obscura, una figura de gran for?a simb?lica, una mena d'encarnaci? de totes les forces tenebroses de la psiquis femenina, que actua en tots els homes que la volten com una divinitat fat?dica que fascina eis sentits i paralitza les volunt?is. Lata es, en aquest sentit, tota una creaci?. Tot el fons de la t?rbola superstici? popular l'ha abocat l'autor en aquesta figura de dona, bella i atractiva, amb la bellesa d'un misteri esglai?s i amb l'atracci? d'un mal?fic ends. (Quoted in Capmany 83) In the light of Montoliu's and some other critics' comments also cited in Capmany's study,5 it becomes apparent that Laia shares the traits of the maleficent demiurge who, in accordance with one of the fundamental principles of Valle-Incl?n's aesthetic, looks down upon humanity and, thus, automatically creates the esperpentic perspective.6 This demiurgic viewpoint, which converts the world into a grotesque stage and all of us, "merely players," into puppets and Fortune's fools, overtakes Espriu not only when he acts out his role as an author by projecting himself, say, in Shalom de Sinera, but also when he surprises himself in the act of reading as suggestive a book as Lloren? Villalonga's Novella de Palmira: Com a la "Mort de becada" de Guerau de Liost, ossos i plomall de Palmira es perden en el misteri del xaragall. Totes les previsibles respostes a l'essencial pregunta se'ns escamotegen amb un art del tot acabada creaci? d'un personat ge a distancia, recerca d'una imaginado l?cida, d'una aparell mental d'una freda i quasi inhumana acuita t. ?s que no ha de temer Salvador Espriu, el tan modest personatge, haver est?t l'objecte d'una especulaci? paraHeia sota la Hum i capriciosa exploraci? de la mateixa esglaiadora m?quina cerebral? Si ?s aix?, voldria propiciar-me un poc el demi?rg d'aquest m?n inteHigent i complex, l'autor d'aquesta obra ... (Evocations 86) So much for Laia. Now, what about the other sibyl, also an offspring of Espriu's creative genius? First presented in a somewhat humorous key in a compact short story ("Quasi-conte alemany d'Ulrika Th?us") incorporated into Ariadna al laberint grotesc (35-37) and later given a prominent part in a much more serious vein in Ronda de Mort a Sinera (54-57), Ulrika looms large amidst Espriu's characters as the Stereotypie "mad scientist" come alive in the guise of the Antichrist in-the-making, who would usher in an era of violence, holocausts, and genocides and institutionalize man's inhumanity to man - all for the sake of a superior race. After these excursions into the realm of the aberrant demiurge, it takes the intervention of another redoubtable female character to</page><page sequence="13">221 bring us back to the well-balanced scope of Shalom's prophetic consciousness. Conjured up from the Biblical world, Esther, who also makes an encore appearance in Ronda de Mort after her premiere performance in Primera hist?ria d'Esther (1948), lives up to her traditional role as savior of her people and, hence, as a "figura" of the Christian Messiah. Though a far cry from the traditional representa tion befitting the awsome character that Esther is, Espriu's dramatiz ation of her still serves as a testimony of man's innate expectation of a devoutly-to-be-wished visitation from the Godhead. But, is that expectation ever going to be fulfilled? Let us reexamine the cycle of the ups-and-downs in the manifestation of Espriu's prophet to the world. Our attention must focus, once again, upon the aforementioned key poem (No. XLI of La pell de brau), which exhibits a crucial phase of that prophet's consciousness. In the very first stanza we hear a voice which echoes former well-established motifs and epitomizes preoccupations previously confessed throughout Espriu's production: Et rius de nosaltres, d'aquells que sempre somnien amb els ulls oberts. Per? quan contemples el fons del mirali, tens por dels qui saben dormir desvedlats. (OC 371) Here the poetic voice bespeaks a consciousness fully mature and well inured to the dialectic of the / and thou, which is one of the main determinants of Espriu's tragic vision. The existential milieu implicit in the first person, which in the very first line appears in the plural (nosaltres) and, later on, in the fourth stanza, is confined to the inner theater of the "jo" ("Baixo per la llarga corda de la set ...) has not changed substantially from the ambiance of Espriu's first book (Les can?ons d'Ariadna of 1949), in which the poem "El sotjador," dated 1937, provides what seems to be, within Espriu's oeuvre, the first extraordinary statement of the discomfiture wrought upon the "jo" by the piercing glance of the Valle-Inclanesque demiurge: Un ull sense parpella sotjant-me en nit din tre tenebra. Esguard de gla?, lluita del fi de l'anima muda, subtil: dolor en la tenebra senyorejada per l'esglai del rostre unie, inn?mer. (78)</page><page sequence="14">222 What we have in "El sotjador," then, is the dramatic installment of the first-person speaker in a unique vivencia or morada vital - to use Am?rico Castro's terminology - in the existencial space, that is, or in the self-awareness of the sotjat, literally the person on the spot, the individual who has the sensation of being the target of someone who is waiting in ambush. The sotjafs unique perspective and veritable obsession with his relationship with the sotjador receive an even more dramatic and forceful statement in the poem of El caminant i el mur that bears the enigmatic title "'Ix, 'Ix?, Eli, Elis!" the meaning of which, already investigated by Castellet (41, 105), does not concern us here. At this point the voice of the first-person sotjat has accrued a haunting Biblical resonance, which harks back partly to the De profundis (Psalm 129), partly to the Book of Job. The former source ("De profundis clamavi at te, Domine") is echoed in the opening verse of Espriu's poem - "Hem pujat el nostre crit a tu ..." (335) - while Job's lamentations, especially the ones referring to what Castellet calls "la mofa de D?u davant l'infortuni de l'home" (104), inspire the poet of Sinera to conclude his composition in a note of tragic, if resigned denouement: S?, clamem contra la sang, nosaltres, que hem vist els arbres i sabem prou b? com el teu nom pot ser burla o silenci. (335) Let these scanty quotations suffice to recapture the mood of the entire composition. Here the identity of the sotjat and his tragic condition is greatly enhanced as the persona becomes fully engaged in the dialectic between the "jo" (who has developed a collective entity as a spokes man of "nosaltres") and the "tu," clearly identified, as Castellet cogently points out (104), with Job's indifferent and even mocking Divinity. All the while, we begin to intuit the rise-and-fall pattern in the consciousness of the prophet's persona: the rise from the depths from which emanates the protagonist's cry of despair and protest - "des de l'amarga / profunditat del pou, et clamo ..." (335); the fall into that "pou," the bottomless pit that Unamuno called the "pozo sin fondo de nuestra conciencia humana" (cf. Cocozzella, "Salvador Espriu's Idea of a Theater" 475). On the one hand, the prophet attempts to transcend the limits of his human condition. On behalf of the multitude he represents, he directs "el nostre crit" to the Creator and, in order to attract the latter's attention, he and the rest even stand on their tiptoes: "ens pos?vem de puntetes per semblar m?s alts" (335). On the other hand, that same prophetic persona is beset by the awareness,</page><page sequence="15">223 precipitated by bitter experience, that whatever plan he may conceive for his own redemption and for the salvation of the people he stands for is bound to fail. By the time we return to La pell de brau and, particularly, to the crucial Poem XLI, which has set us on this train of reflections, we must be ready to take into account the whole cluster of motifs which Espriu has devised as functions of the fundamental dialectic between the jo (or nosaltres) and the tu. We have seen how this existential polarity evolves into a mode of tragic tension between the sotjat and the sotjador, and how, finally, the relationship between these two person ages is projected unto a universal scale as the struggle between the tragic individual and the Supreme Being perceived as an indifferent God. Espriu's prophetic persona has come a long way since his appearance in "El sotjador." No longer cowed by the demiurge, he has learned to live in the sight of the latter and, when the time comes to face the "Almighty Other," he can rise to the occasion. Joan Fuster argues that Salvador Espriu cannot conceive of a tragic hero comparable in stature with his conterpart in classical Greek theater: L'Espriu pertany a la s?rie inteHectual dels qui tracten de treure els coturns a la vida, dels qui descalcen Thome i el deixen de peus a terra. Desprove?da de les pr?tesis enlluernadores, la humanitat es queda en el seu nivell precis. I aquesta ?s la "lucidesa." ("Introducci?" xxx) I would maintain, nevertheless, that, at the height of his zeal, Espriu's prophet attains full heroic grandeur, ephemeral though it be. He well may be without buskins, but he can stand, as he avows, on tiptoe and can assume the authoritative voice of the community (nosaltres) in order to speak in a majestic tone - majestic enough to convert the anguished cry of his former self into a challenge to the Creator: You laugh at us, but do you dare fathom the depths of our tragedy and see your own reflection in the mirror of our suffering? Are you afraid of those who, like the prudent virgins of the Gospel parable, are awake, even while they sleep, and await your coming anxiously and diligent The grand stand of Espriu's prophet presupposes, I believe, an attitude much akin to that of Unamuno's notion of the superman, who, as Paul Hie explains, borrowing Unamuno's very words: "'plays with God' ... and aspires to achieve His immortality ... This is logical - Hie continues - because God has been created in man's image, so that the superman simply replaces Him by transcending his own finitude. As Unamuno asked, 'What is God if not the supreme and</page><page sequence="16">224 absolute superman, the projection of man into the infinite? The vision of God sprang forth in the human consciousness, and of necessity it takes an anthropomorphic form. Thus it is, and so it must be. The ideal must be for anthropomorphic man. And man is above all the depository of consciousness'" (Unamuno 179). Apparently, in Espriu's vision, the exalted prophet is eminently motivated by that hambre de inmortalidad which Unamuno expresses in the most forceful terms: "quiero ser yo, y sin dejar de serlo, ser adem?s los otros, adentrarme a la totalidad de las cosas visibles e invisibles, extenderme a lo ilimitado del espacio y prolongarme a lo inacabable del tiempo ... ?O todo o nada!" (54-56) Unamuno's dual metaphysics reflecting a paradoxical dialectic of action and reaction, escape and return, provides yet another prototype for a further development in Espriu's characterization of the prophet. To the surge of vitality, stemming from the impulse of querer ser that projects the prophet to the infinite realm of immortality and eternity, corresponds, as the obverse side of the same reality, God's providential plan to visit the kingdom of this world where time and mortality have their uncontested sway. Here we approach the area of Unamuno's obsessive meditation on what to him proves to be the most appealing tenet of Christian doctrine: the mystery of the Incarnation. In line with Unamuno's contemplative bent, Espriu's intuition brings into play one of his most memorable effects of alternanza sobtada. In a shift so sudden that it becomes imperceptible, the prophet abandons his attempted dialogue with the Divinity and rivets his attention upon the image of the Immanuel, the God-with-us, the Christian Messiah. Naturally, Espriu's persona becomes engrossed in his reflections upon the vision of the suffering Christ, the Christ Agonistes, whom Una muno suggestively identifies with the tragic hero par excellence, a veritable embodiment of the "el sentimiento tr?gico de la vida."7 Thus, by virtue of Espriu's ingenious technique o? alternanza sobtada, the prophet's daydream recoils upon itself, turns itself inside out, and becomes yet another reenactment of the very same role of "exemplary sufferer" that Susan Sontag finds well represented in modern Western literature. Sontag, in effect, points out in Pavese and, in general, in the artist of our time, a social sensibility for which we cannot but recognize an essential coincidence both with Shalom's own equivocal attitude toward the human community and with his overall disposition toward sacrifice. "For the modern consciousness," writes Sontag, "the artist (replacing the saint) is the exemplary sufferer. And among artists, the writer, the man of words, is the person to whom we look to be able best to express his suffering" (52).</page><page sequence="17">225 As we might expect from a process inspired by Unamuno's model, in Espriu the contemplation of Christ's suffering becomes a version of the imitatio Christi syndrome, which implies, in turn, a mechanism of sympathy, symbiosis, and ultimate identification. The prophet is ready to resume his atavistic descent into the depths of anguish, but without losing his dignity and majesty as a tragic hero: Baixo per la llarga corda de la set, dalt de Taridesa del dolor del vers, amb un vas de clara caritat de cel. Em batien ales d'?ngels esparvers, sabres de paraules em tallen els peus. Per? l'aigua salvo per al meu desert, neguit d'esperan?a de llavis ardents. (OC 371) Even as his mind becomes immersed, one more time, in his "dark world and wide," the prophet is stirred by the presence of the Messiah. He senses that the Christ is with him and within him. His heartfelt communion with the primordial "Savior" casts even him, the unpre tentious Shalom, into the role of the reformer and redeemer. In a revealing episode dramatized in Ronda de Mort a Sinera (94-96) - the conversation that, in his summary of his own life, Shalom has with his father (cf. "El meu amie Salom," Ariadna al laberint grotesc 95-97) - Shalom confesses his fervent sense of mission. Let us recall one memorable moment of the tense dialogue: "I em vaig graduar d'advocat." -Ara a exercir -va dir el meu pare. "Per? les lectures m'havien capgirat el cervell. -No, pap? -li vaig respondre-. No m'agrada el dret, penso volar m?s alt. -Que potser far?s de comerciant? -pregunt? amb un bri d'esperan?a el meu progenitor. -No, vull reformar Lavinia, Konil?sia i totes aq?estes coses. (Anadna 96) This is the high point of Shalom's career. And an enthusiastic moment it is! There is, nevertheless, a fly in the ointment. Shalom's mention of his "lectures" and of their deleterious effects upon his "cervell" - a reference, no doubt, to the voracious reading which eventually dried up Don Quixote's "cerebro" - comes as an ominous premonition of the inevitable quixotic failure, which Shalom's father is quick to foresee. The tension of the aforementioned dialogue flares up in an unceremonious warning:</page><page sequence="18">226 ?Tensorrar?s, gandul -va dir el meu pare. "Jo vaig somriure amb suficiencia. I em vaig ensorrar ..." "Si, em vaig ensorrar, jo, el redemptor ..." (Ariadna 96) Shalom realizes that the most enthusiastic enterprises sooner or later must crash upon the harsh realities of the world. The idea dawns on him that, after all, he is nothing but a redeemer manqu?. We notice, then, that, in a process analogous to that of the baroque desenga?o, Shalom's frustration and his ultimate coming to terms with the direst reality brings him to a point of enlightenment, to a flash of self recognition, comparable to the crucial moment of anagnorisis classical Greek theater. Even while in the depths of his "pou," though, Shalom retains his prophetic perspective which extends in ever-widening circles way beyond the abysses of his human condition. This shift in the orienta tion of Shalom's outward vision marks the analogy with a singular moment in the allegorical life history of one of the most renowned poet-prophets of all time: Soon after they reach the lowest pit of Inferno, the pilgrim Dante and his companion, we may recall, are able to rise to see the stars again; Lo duca e io per quel cammino ascoso intrammo a ritornar nel chiaro mondo; e sanza cura aver d'alcun riposo salimmo su, el primo e io secondo, tanto ch'i' vidi delle cose belle che porta ciel, per un pertugio tondo; e quindi uscimmo a riveder le stelle. (Inferno 34. 133-39) So it is with Shalom as Espriu's prophet. Even as he penetrates to the innermost ring of his personal inferno, he attains that self-awareness that allows him, through his own "pertugio tondo," some rewarding insights into the reality beyond the "pou." The mouth of the "pou" - the "brocal del pozo sin fondo de nuestra conciencia humana," to quote Unamuno once again - becomes the all-important opening from which to attain Espriu's cosmic outlook and "encyclopaedic form." From his vantage point, Espriu can create an existential frame of reference for his entire world view in much the same fashion as Unamuno avails himself of the conscious ness of Augusto P?rez to provide a bearing for the existential drama played out in Niebla. Analogous to the inner world of Unamuno's protagonist, Shalom's consciousness is the existential frame of reference against which to gauge the exemplarity of the episodes that either impinge directly upon his life or simply fall within the scope of</page><page sequence="19">227 his contemplation. Just as in Niebla the interpolated stories attain their full significance in their interaction with the process of raising Augusta's consciousness or awareness of his own existence, in Espriu's production the many relatively short narratives become articulated into a cohesive vision by virtue of Shalom's growth into the self awareness of a prophet. One example will suffice to illustrate the projection of Shalom's consciousness into a story which assumes the exemplarity of a parable even as it becomes, in the final analysis, an extension of that con sciousness. Let us reflect once again on the crucial turn of events that make up the episode of Shalom's desenga?o as related in Ariadna al laberint grotesc and as dramatized in Ronda de Mort a Sitiera. We have seen, already, how Shalom's reformist dreams precipitate his father's warning of the son's impending failure. The moment Shalom learns his bitter lesson, so bluntly taught by his own father, his eyes are opened and he is ready to assimilate a higher lesson - the one embedded in the story of Crisant Baptista Mestres. As he concludes his account, Shalom literally guides the reader or the spectator to consider the case of what turns out to be a highly ambiguous person age. "Crisant em manifesta a poc a poc i amb circumspecci? la seva doctrina, la quai vaig seguir al peu de la lletra. I he triomfat, ja ho veieu. No coneixeu la teoria de Crisant? Es tan genial com senzilla." "Espera," va tallar rimpacient Tomeu. "Digues abans qu? vas fer, en desar-te de redemptor." "Qui, jo? Mira, d'advocat. I de ventr?loc, com a distracelo, a estones perdudes." va riure el feli? amie Salom. I passava a exposar-nos la teoria de Crisant. {Ariadna 97) Shalom's very disillusionment, then, provides a living testimonial that one of the most powerful binding forces in Spanish society resides precisely in the widely-shared expectation, chimeric though it be, that a Messianic leader is sure to usher in the dawning of a Brave New World while leading the nation to its regeneration. Could Crisant be one such Messiah? Advertising himself in various ways as an M.D. and a metaphys ician, a guru and a faith healer, a lover of belles-lettres and a patron of the arts, Crisant gathers around himself a coterie of clients from the wealthy bourgeoisie and would-be disciples from the halls of the University, a motley group of individuals who not only imbibe his ideologies and foster his quixotic programs but also promote his personal fortune and fame by securing for him a number of posts as a member of the Royal Academy, a Counselor to the National Bank,</page><page sequence="20">228 a Deputy to the Cortes, President of the Commission for Discalced Indians, and Professor of "Characterological Graphology" at the University. At the core of Crisant's reputation as an outstanding teacher lies his ability to encourage his devotees to "think pure thoughts" and to foist among them the conviction that they and everything that pertains to them - be it their personal talents or national heritage - are, indeed, the best in all creation. What are we to make of Crisant's visionary pedagogy? What are we to think of the integrity of his character? From Espriu's depiction of Crisant's character (cf. Ariadna 99-103) and from Salvat's represen tation of it (Ronda de Mort 96-108), it appears that Crisant's ventures, far from eliciting admiration, can only rate, at best, a wry smile of condescension. There is every reason to believe that Crisant's enterprises are held in ridicule, for we are hard put refraining from laughter when we witness the members of his entourage, who bear such names as Tobies Comes, Trinitat Castellfollit, Pup? Aiosa, Mimi Pitosporos, Ludovicus Baronet, Victoria Prou, behave in puppetlike movements and repeat in a mechanical fashion such slogans as "Penseu amb puresa" ('Think pure thoughts)'! Especially comic is the moment when they, referring to Catalan folk music and, especially, to the sardana, burst out with "La, la, la, la. La, la, la, la. La, la, la, la. La millor. Sense discussi?" (Ronda de Mort 104)! We perceive a subtle irony in the dialectic between the ridiculous portrayal of these mechanized versions of humanity and the lofty epiphanies of archetypal grandeur which their stylized pose occasional ly evokes. In his mise en sc?ne Salvat brings to light the first striking manifestation of Crisant and his disciples when they line themselves up on the stage in a peculiar arrangement of three triangles within a larger triangle - a grouping which suggests, to name the most obvious symbolism, the Trinity or, perhaps, in accordance with Christopher Butler's explanation, the Gnostic triad of Being, Life, and Intellect (36). They also align as members of an attentive audience in a lecture hall so as to extol the position of Crisant as an educator of high renown, finally, they bring their relationship with their revered pedagogue to a climactic moment when they assemble in a reenactment of a love feast, emblematic, no doubt, of the Christian agape or of the Last Supper. We now realize that the characterization of Crisant Baptista Mestres hangs in suspense between adulation and ridicule, between supreme aggrandizement and utter annihilation. Poised between the thaumaturgie Messiah and the egomaniacal charlatan, between the hero and the fool, he ends up being neither of the two and, as the Unamunian character that he is, his very existence seems doomed to</page><page sequence="21">229 vanish into the thin air. The worst calamity or disgrace that could befall Crisant is for him to become a nobody both in the social and in the existential sense. The tightly-knit clique of his fervent admirers and protectors seems to understand this perfectly. So, when a shady personage named Bijou Fontrodona, arising from some dark nook of that macrocosm called society, is about to deflate Crisant's bubble reputation and, with it, lay low his very raison d'?tre by throwing at his face the fact that he is nothing but a philosopher (in Bijou's opinion, the basest and most boring of all professions), the loyal troop rallies around the master just in time for a photographer, who seems to pop out of nowhere, to transform the entire group into "una foto de fi de curs, que tots te?en la convicci? que esdevindr? hist?rica" (Ronda de Mor? 108). Even while this tongue-in-cheek commentary pronounces the last sardonic word on whatever impact Crisant may have had upon the course of human events, the photographer - a deus ex machina of sorts - enshrines Crisant's last, perhaps most meaning ful and memorable epiphany on a piece of paper sensitive to the ephemeral flash of a shining light. Thus, Crisant becomes simply a clich?, as Pulcre Trompelli, one of the most cynical denizens of Sinera, might disdainfully put it. Being of a different bent than Trompelli, Shalom is not likely to dismiss the vagaries of Crisant's vivencia. These, as we have seen, begin to manifest themselves as the focus of Shalom's prophetic perspective from the "pou" and are, naturally enough, the object of Shalom's meditations, integrated, in turn, into his own concerns about human existence. In one sense, Crisant's "exemplum" anchors Shalom's metaphysical lucubrations on to the world of Lavinia, Konil?sia, Sepharad - Barcelona, Catalonia and Spain - in that order, even as that world is being translated through the Cervantian ambiguities that thrive on the interplay between the sublime and he mundane, the tragic and the pathetic, the admirable and the ridicu lous. In another sense, the contemplation of Crisant's case adds a new dimension to Shalom's prophetic Weltanschauung because, by means of that contemplation, the challenge that Shalom addresses a la Unamuno to the Supreme Being and the anxious effort that Shalom makes in order to achieve a communion between Man and that Almighty Creator become transferred from the realm of the myth to that of human time. That is to say, Crisant's existence and its concrete milieu - the symbiosis between his yo and circunstancia - manifested, after all, in a literary construct, achieves a meaningful ontological correlative as a compendium of the history of a particular people, the Catalan nation, periodically informed by the spirit of Messianism.</page><page sequence="22">230 Akin to the development of Unamuno's notion of intrahistoria, the full assimilation of that literary-historic compendium into Shalom's consciousness is symptomatic of Shalom's acquisition of a distinctive point of view, which, borrowing Ortega y Gasset's terminology, I would call "historicist." This is the very historicist perspective that Carles Miradles recognizes in what he calls Espriu's reflection on history through the recreation of the mythic mode (42). We fully agree with Miradles in that the sense of historicism which transpires from Espriu's production involves a dialectic between myth and history, die timeless and the temporal, between, on the one hand, the "univers creacional" oriented toward the infinite and the eternal and, on the other hand, the microcosm made up of the individual and his limitations. In conclusion, Espriu takes to heart the notion of a poetic of prophecy, which well could harmonize with one of the leading motifs in Pablo Neruda's production, especially as stated in the latter's "Arte po?tica" included in Residencia en la tierra (1933). A distinguishing trait of Espriu's poetry is the enhanced sense of historicism in Ortega y Gasset's meaning of the term, which tempers, significantly, the pessimistic bent of Espriu's prophetic persona. In effect, Ortega's dictum - "Cada vida es un punto de vista sobre el universo" - which, in accordance with Ferrater Mora's explanation, "denotes not only, or exclusively, a human individual but also a national community or a historical period" (32), defines, most fittingly, the existential bearings and oudook which make up that persona's full perspective. This, as we have seen, exhibits, on the one hand, a preoccupation to an obsessive extent, with the tragic sense of life and, on the other hand, a wondrous vision oriented toward the contemplation of the starry heavens. Even as he meditates upon the teachings of his sobering experiences, which illustrate the misery of human life and the bankruptcy of the Messianic mission, Espriu's prophet raises his consciousness to the climax of entranced moments, such as the one which concludes the action of Primera historia d'Esther with a lofty hymn dedicated to the celestial Sagittarius: El teu arc, sagitari, enlaira la vilesa del Ilot a vol harmonie vers la pau pressentida. (51) The significance of a moment like this is not lost on Salvat who, in one of his enlightening commentaries, focuses upon the transcentantal</page><page sequence="23">231 qualities that mark the grand finale of Espriu's dramatic masterpiece: En l'ultim moment de l'obra, l'Alt?ssim -Corifeu de la historia- s'eleva amb els seus coturns per damunt de la trag?dia i s'adre?a no sols al ninots, inerts dins de la capsa, sino al public, morts ?vidents que desapareixen de l'exist?ncia, mes enll? de la quai continua la veu del cec. La veu del cec assimila la veu del poeta, i a trav?s d'ella l'ultima visi? d'Espriu es fa patent, unint en aquesta visi? tots els personatges en una sola unitat, per damunt de la vida i la mort, en un instant ?nic d'eternitat. La visi? del poeta, veu perenne, per damunt de la seva pr?pia realitat d'home, atura per sempre les coses del temps. (270) To sum up, Espriu's prophet often descends to the depths of the "pou," but he is quite capable, also, of riding the high tide of the historia of our time. He is, indeed, a historicist persona whose syncretic and synchronie glance reconciles myth and history, time and eternity, the limits of the human condition and the boundless realm of ecstatic contemplation. Above all, Espriu follows Cervantes' footsteps in deftly articulating within an ingenious creation both the Prophet's escape to the mythic realm and the Messiah's confrontation with reality. Thus, he achieves the artistic image of a historicist persona as rich in ambiguities, complexities, and paradoxical connota tions as life itself. State University of New York at Binghamton NOTAS 1 For a general orientation on this group of writers, I have found indispensable the collection of articles edited by Jaime Ferr?n and Daniel P. Testa. Among the leading critics of Catalan letters the notion of a "Generation of 436" remains nebulous. Joan Fuster recognizes and discusses some generational traits com mon to such writers as Agusti Bartra, Pere Calders, Joan Sales, Joan Teixidor, Joan Vinyoli, who began their careers at the outbreak of the war (Literatura catalana contempor?nia 323-60, 370-89). Maria Aur?lia Capmany, despite some reservation - "l'esclat del 1936 no aglutina, dispersa ..." - includes a chapter on "La Generaci? del 36" (Salvador Espriu 25-42) and does not hesitate to identify some key exponents, adding to Fuster's list the names of Salvador Espriu, Rosa Leveroni, Bartomeu Rossell?, Josep M.a Boix i Selva, Josep Jan?s, Jaume Vicens Vives, Ignasi Agusti, Gafim. Surprisingly enough, Capmany overlooks Merc? Rodoreda, widely recognized as the leading Catalan novelist of the Civil War. 2 Espriu well may have adapted to his own aesthetic that special Cervantian structural formula which Lowry Nelson calls "incremental repetition" and describes as follows: "[Cervantes'] main narrative proceeds by incremental repetition ... [that is,] in each episode some new possibility or actuality is revealed and added to our knowledge of the characters in Cervantes' fiction</page><page sequence="24">232 world" (8). Another intriguing analogue and more immediate antecedent for Espriu's sense of structure may be found in the "asistem?tica organicidad" that Blanco Aguinaga perceives throughout Unamuno's production (227-28). 3 This is the name I have adopted in my translation of Ronda de Mort a Sitiera. 4 The pagination refers to the updated but incomplete revised edition of Espriu's Obres completes (1985), which incorporates the variants of the poet's own revision undertaken shortly before his death. For the poems not included in this edition, I have used the previous Obres completes, vol. 1, published by the same Edicions 62 in 1968. In my references I identify the latter text with the abbrevi ation OC. 5 See, for example, the following paragraph taken from a study of Rafael Tasis, published in Barcelona in 1935: La influ?ncia del Valle Incl?n de les Comedias b?rbaras i els Esperpentos, la de V?ctor C?tala amb eis Drames rurab i les Ombrivo les, pesen damunt la inspirado de Salvador Espriu i fan de Lata, com del volum de contes Aspectes, llibres agres, d'un pessimisme violent, una mica menysp readors de la psicologia, i escrits en un estil personal, de par?grafs curts i acolorits, realista en les descriptions i que, malgrat el car?cter una mica repe Hent del tema i des figures, es fan llegir amb inter?s. (Capmany 35-36) Also worthy of note is the following statement which Capmany quotes from a review published by Dom?nec Guans? in 1932: Entorn d'una figura femenina, enigm?tica i torbadora, l'autor tra?a un seguit de suggestives estampes de p?ble. Els se us temes s?n ben ib?rics: la crueltat, la superstici?, la sensuali tat, la gelosia, el misticisme i la mis?ria. ?s amb una gran plasticitat que s?n fetes aq?estes estampes. Sobre fons tenebrosos, destaca la pinzellada vibrant. Per? els contorns de les figures i de les coses te?en una volguda vaguetat de somni i de misteri, apresa dels sobrerealistes; una incoher?ncia que permet a l'autor eHminar tots els elements que no es podrien transformar en poesia. Per? no per aix? aq?estes estampes deixen d'?sser r?alistes: d'un r?alisme violent i caricat?rese de tan expressiu com vol ?sser. (Capmany 82) 6 Referring to this perspective Rodolfo Cardona and Anthony . Zahareas point out that Valle-Incl?n "opta por una manera de ver el mundo art?sticamente: no de rodillas para crear admiraci?n (como en la ?poca de Homero) ni en pie para desdoblarse afectivamente en los personajes (como en la tragedia de Shakespeare) sino levantado en el aire, que es mirar a todos con iron?a y desd?n demi?rgico" (25). 7 In his illuminating book (see, below, "Works Cited"), Juan Guillermo Renart analyzes Unamuno's meditation on the figure of Christ as a tragic hero.
