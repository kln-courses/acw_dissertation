Instead of regarding the proper object of physical science as a search after essential causes, I believe it ought to be, and must be, a search after facts and relations.-W. R. (now Hon. Justice) GROVE, Correlatzio of Physical Forces, Pref. adfin.. THE teaching of the Infidel School in England culminates, as a well-informed writer$ observes, in three negations, viz.,-of God, of the soul, of virtue. Of that school in its high pretensions, its Germanizing tendencies, and its ignorance or contempt of the ordinary procedures of the human understanding, Professor Tyn dall has long been considered a fair specimen. His industry and courage, his success in some branches of physical science, his popularity as a lecturer, and his boundless admiration for the so called heroes of " advanced thought," pointed him out as a man not unqualified to fill for a season the Presidential Chair of the British Association of Scicnce. The thought found favor in high circles; nor did it lose its attractiveness from the likelihood which existed that Professor Tyndall, if elected, would use the influence of his high place to uproot, if possible, the most settled convic tions of religious minds, aInd scatter among English-speaking people the seeds of a degrading and withering scepticism. Whether the committee of the British Association are chargeable with such intention we know not. For ourselves ve are disposed to acquit that estimable body of such desigrn. Those who think differently, and they are many, may point to results and instance the tone and character of President Tyndall's Inaugural Address. The Ad dress, which we ventured in another number to designate as the New Koran, was certainly not such as either Science or Piety can applaud. It was not, as it ouglht to have been, a report of the ascertained results and actual state of physical science. It was rather a determined crusade upon long established and Christian beliefs. Had the most advanced of German or English unbe * Mr. Mivart, Contemporary Evolution, October number of the Contempo rary Review, page 773.</page><page sequence="2">30 The New Koran Refuted. lievers been selected, in place of Mr. Tyndall, for the execution of a formal assault upon Theism and the nature and destiny as well as the liberty of the human soul, we know not how else the sup posed champion could have managed his assault than as Professor Tyndall has done. Were such a one selected to act as a buccaneer or marauder in pay of some special science, charged to invade the domain of contiguous sciences, or even the wider domain of Metaphysics and Theology,4 we know not in what other wise he could have planned and conducted his incursion than as Professor Tyndall has done. Breaking loose from the examples of those who went before him in the Presidential Chair of Science, and spurning the well-defined opinions of Huxley and Justice Grove, which we have set down at the head of this paper, Mr. Tyndall, from the sphere of special physics, of which he knows much, evolves, or rather involves, himself into the region of general Metaphysics, from History, of which he knows little, into Theology of which he knows less, from facts and the relations of facts in which he would be a worthy wvitness, into conjectures and dim visions of the future where he is all at sea, and all, or nearly all, in error. We must not omit that AMr. Tyndall (in pure deference, we suppose, to his friend, Thomas Carlyle, and to impersonate a pic ture drawn by that frantic writer) has chosezL at the end of his Address to turn, as it were, champion, challenging people at large to a future encounter, parcelling out their functions and dominions and limiting their line of movementt under pain of coming dis aster and of his mighty displeasure. The Nemesis which follows the footsteps of Audacify and Dzs proportz2n- has not been slow to overtake Professor Tyndall. The Press in these countries and America has taken up the gauntlets of the challenger, and the marauding sciolist has at least been driven within his own lines. More than this indeed has been done. Future assaults of a similar character have been rendered more difficult and less to be apprehended. Even Mr. Tyndall himself has thought over his utterances anew, and, while we write, a mes sage comes to us that that adventurous thinker at the beginning of a course of lectures in AIanchester has avowed his belief in a Supreme Intelligence, and rejected the charge of Atheism so gene * Professor Tyndall has slain Theology, but only to revive?London Times, Aug.

We credit the declaration as made with entire sincerity, though the reason given for the Pro fessor's happy conclusion is a characteristic and almost a comic one. In the minds, however, of German infidels (and possibly too of their admirers in England) the admission of an Intelligence above the human, which the Professor makes, does not imply a belief in One Personal God, supreme over all his works and dis tinct from them. On the contrary, we fear the Professor holds on, notwithstanding his recent declaration, to the stupid admira tion (we cannot say worship) of a certain cosmical, harmonious whole (Tro ray) the Das Universum of the Professor's German oracles. Of this cumulative and aggregate Deity, the higher reaches-the efflorescence as it were-may, in the Professor's estimate, be intelligent. Venus sprang from the foam of the sea; the seminal egg from which sentient and intelligent things came forth was born of chaos; and so it may be that from patches of star-dust-from atoms self-polarized, self-moved-cemented by a divine agglutinative force, came forth, by an upward inexplicable motion, a certain confederated or rather cohesive intelligence, by which the phenomena of growth and decay, of rest, motion, and mechanical force, of evolution and involution, of the correlated action of nerve force and mind force, are possibly understood more clearly than they are by Mr. Darwin, Herbert Spencer, or even the Professor himself.* That such, or nearly such, is the view which Mr. Tyndall entertains simultaneously with his re pudiation of atheism, we dare to affirm from the following sighificant facts : i. That the Professor nowhere in his Address speaks of God as living, personal, and distinct from His works. z. That he seems to identify his own creed with that of Go6the, who, he himself tells us, had an abhorrence of One Personal God. 3. That nearly all Pantheistic writers are prime favourites in Mr. Tyndall's Address. 4. That the idea of a Personal Creator is everywhere spoken of with contempt and belittled with the caricature of an artificer at his bench, a human artificer; and, 5. That the profession of Mr. Tyndall of belief in "a cosmical life, in which all things we see have their unsearchable roots," is not a sufficient expression to convey belief in a Personal God, and is with the foregoing facts an adequate, though not very clear, expression of Pantheism or * See the Repudiation of Atheism by Professor Tyndall, at Manchester, Wednesday, October 28, in his Opening Lecture. See also the Professor's Address at Belfast ; in the end, where he quotes admiringly from Goethe, and about the middle, where the coincidence of the President's views with those of Lucretius, Giordano Bruno, and Carlyle, is but too manifest.

Pascal, in his Provincial Letters, somewhere introduces as defenders of an opponent's opinion a host of authorities-men of strange, unseemly views indeed, but whose names were still more strange. The attentive hearer asks in astonishment-What? and were all these Christians ! ! We should be tempted as we run over the list of Mr. Tyndall's favourite (German) Pantheists, to raise our eyes in astonishment and ask, were those who owned such opinions and such names, Men-Spinosa, Schleiermacher, Fichte, Hegel, IBichner, Hakckel, and the rest ? The last evolu tion of logic in the hands of these men(?) is the formula-" Das Nichts ist das Seyn,"*-Nron-Being is Bei`tg. Nothing is the equi valent of existence. Such a school debars itself from a hearing at the tribunal of human reason. If Mr. Tyndall has evolved him self during his residence beyond the Rhine into a disciple of that school we do not envy him his "organism" or his "environ ment." We have been at some pains to learn two things touching Pantheism. First, its logical origin; second, the mental concep tion, the Vorstellung (as Tyndall would say) which it involves. The only clue to the former is to be found, we think, in the gra tuitous and altogether erroneous idea which has arisen in some minds that personalily in God implies limi/ahon, inmerfection and (bless the mark!) an/hropomorphism of a certain kind. This conse quence is assumed at every page by the author of "&lt;Supernatural Religion." He prefers therefore an impersonal, diffusive Deity, hidden somehow in the interstices of things and pervading- the cosmost or universe. Mr. Tyndall seems fascinated by the fiction, and, in his far-famed lecture, Personality and Anthropo morphism are equivalent ideas, whether as applied to pagans, Christians, or to theists at large. The assumed equivalency of the two ideas is simply monstrous; and, speaking of the German and Pantheistic school, the confusion of such distinct and distant things ought to be known henceforth as the Opprobrium Ihiloso phorum. As regards the Pantheistic school of England, the Bamp ton lecturer, Dean Mansel, is in part responsible for that blunder. The able work of John Young, LL.D., Edinburgh, entitled "Province of Reason'" has exposed with singular success the many errors of Mansel. One however has escaped the keen vision * Hegel, Encyclop?die, Die Lehre von Seyn Seite, ioo, Heidelberg, 1827. Fechner, Hartman and Strauss, carry the absurdity still further. f Our Infidel Scientists take much pleasure in the use of the words cosmos, cosmic, cosmical, &amp;c. The ordinary reader may be informed that cosmos is a Greek word signifying a beautiful and symmetrical thing. The world was supposed such.

If there were no God to design it, it should be borne in mind by Scientists.</page><page sequence="5">The New Koran Refuted. 33 of Mr. Young, and the bird of prey has pounced upon it. We allude to the statement of Dean Mansel that " personality (in God) we conceive of as necessarily a limitation.",# This false and fatal admission is due, we must say, to the ignorance, or incomplete theo logical training of Mr. Mansel. Resting, however, upon this, the author of "Supernatural Religion" proceeds to urge that such inadequate and an/hropo-morphz;i (szc) modes of representing God to ourselves should be abandoned, and replaced by other modes (Pantheistic), '" neither contrary to our highest moral sense nor contradictory to the teaching of the universe and its laws." The error of Dean Mansel is seized upon as the teaching of all theists. In the false light supplied by Mansel's error a Christian truth is set down by an acute sophist as anthropomorphism, and the note once sounded is echoed, re-echoed, and prolonged in the lectures or rhapsodies of our cosmic prophets-such as Herbert Spencer and Mr. Tyndall. Now, personality in the Infinite Intelligence does not imply imperfection. Dean Mansel here, as in countless other instances, is gravely at fault. .No Christian theologian has ever, before Mansel, defended such an error. The scholastic theologians with one accord reject such an error. They maintain the true dogma, which is contradictory to the Dean's assertion. Gabriel Vasquez, for example, has the following thesis: " Personality is a mode deter mining an existing thing- in such wise that that thing be personal, not that it be finite."-!) isp. 25, n. s.f In the context text to which the thesis refers we read this :-" For personality in itself is only a certain mode, which, although it define and terminate the object so that it be a person incommunicable to aught beside, yet does not as it were receive that object into itself and so limit or terminate it in the nature of substance, as to render it finite of essence, unless finiteness belong to the object itselffor some other reason." Dean Mansel probably never read Vasquez$ or any of the commentators on St. Thomas of Aquin. The author of " Super natural Religion" never opened St. Thomas or his commenta tors, and never dreamed that in Christian nmatters there existed *See Bampton Lectures for 1858?Limits of Religious Thought. Lect. III., pp. 59, 60, 6r, 5th edition. f Vasquez, vol. i., p. 129. Antwerp, 1621. { Vasquez is not the only Catholic divine who states, in express terms, the opposite to what Dean Mansel blunderingly affirms, to wit, that "Personality (in God) implies limitation." Suarez is as explicit as Vasquez. His words are, ' The infiniteness (of God) is not an infinite of a multitude, but an Infinite inten sive of being (perfection;, and for this reason such infinity does not exclude the possibility of other entities distinct from God?distinct, I say, by this, that He is Infinite?they finite. He, Self-existent and Underived?they derived and dependent. It is otherwise as regards an Infinite o? quantity." See the entire first chapter. " De Deo uno et Trino," Lib. i. c. i. In fact that Personality neither is nor can be conceived as a limitation or abridgment of perfection in God is, whatever Dean Mansel says to the contrary, a simple, universally affirmed Christian truth.

Hence the charge, so exultingly made (page 74, "Supernatural Religion,") of inade quate and degrading conceptions ofthe Deity, ofanthropomorphism, in Christian minds. Hence cosmical and pantheistical instead of supercosmic and personal Godhead is the Ult/na Thule-the land of darkness and contradiction to which the author of " Supernatural Religion" is driven, and to which Professor Tyndall is resolved to follow him. We do not here discuss a possible metaphysical ques tion whether personality does or does not necessarily limit its posses sor in point of perfection. If any of our pantheists maintains that it does, we ave ready to join issue with him. Xhat we complain of is that Christians, in the face of existing facts, are charged with conceizvng Deify as lzmited and zmperfect in consequence of its per sonal character, and that upon this assuredly false charge is founded a rejection of the living God and a Deification, not of some crea tures, which is Polytheism, but of all creatures (which is Pan theism): of all creatures, we say, from the Ovum of Chaos to Kant,* Helmholtz and Carlyle. Among the Presbyterians of the North there still exists what was once known as the Stool of Repentance. At the present day it is sometimes, though rarely, used. Should the British Associ ation of Science again assemble at Belfast, we would suggest that the time-honoured stool of penance be brought forth and the late President of the Association placed thereon, Dean Mansel at his right hand, and the author of " Supernatural Religion " at his left, while Atheists and Pantheists, Cosmists and Comtists, Epicureans and Spinosists be requested to perform around the penitents that primeval atom-dance out of which from nothing came ordered things, and blind, unintelligent force, self-driven through ages, gave forth Professor Tyndall and his cosmic celebrities as its latest evolution. The logical analysis of pantheism reduces that monstrosity to a worship or deification of 0o 7ra, the whole,-all that presents itself to our senses, and, by an additive process of our memory and understanding, is strung together and symbolized (for it cannot be conceived) as the Universe of Things-Das Uni'veisum. This universum-this ro wray-is susceptible (logically speaking) of every predicate you choose. It is one, it is many, it is good, it is bad, it is great, it is small, it is homogeneous, it is heterogeneous, it is divided into parts, it is fused into one, it is ever evolving itself into forms, and ever destroying or rather devouring these * We mean no disrespect to the memory of Immanuel Kant. That great thinker is not fairly expounded by Professor Tyndall. The philosopher of Kcenigsberg, it is true, thought that the existence of God could not, in his system of formal Logic, be proved by strict demonstration of syllogism ; but he placed that truth on a ground which he chose to consider of higher certainty, [viz., as a postulate of the practical reason of Man. Tyndall, in his allusion .to Clerk Maxwell's Lecture at Bradford, forgets this fact.</page><page sequence="7">The New Koran Refuted. 35 forms ; it is life, it is death, it is littleness and meanness in the worm, it is power and mightiness in the mountain; you may worship it if you will with Wordsworth and Goethe; you may contemn and curse it with Mill. With no sympathy for you and your yearnings the pantheistic deity exists but to puzzle, to mock and to be silent; and mind (if mind there be) reaches its highest level in that strange escaped lemur which we call Man, and who is, at best (in the system of pantheism) not more than what the poetical misanthrope styles him4 "A child of doubt and death, whose hope is built on reeds." In sharp contrast with this wretched, untheological view of Deity stands the fundamental belief in One, Intelligent and Personal God, MIaker of Heaven and Earth and of all that exists,-a belief common to Patriarchs, Jews, and Christians, and as we deem, to all that think aright. The Christian contemplates and admires the Tro 7ray, the limitless multitude of things; he adores the To i't, the Infinite One which is above it, and which is its Cause. The homage of the Christian is not given to greatness of multitude or quantity, but to Infinite Intensity (or Perfection) of Being. In this line (and it is the only true line) of infinitude, God stands alone. He is necessary, self-existent, and eternal. He is intelligent, for intelligences exist among created things, and as no effect transcends the virtue of its cause, the Creator or First Cause of those intelligences must himself be Intelligent. He is One, for Multiplicity in the nature of Supreme, Eternal, Underived Being cannot be proved, nor assumed. Log,ical economy is against such a supposition: and if made it is found at once to convey im perfection and even contradiction. That Being is Personal; for were It impersonal, neither Oneness nor Intelligence could be affirmed of It; Simplicity and Perfection could not be Its attri butes. Life itself could not be its characteristic. Moreover, in the line of intensive perfection of being, the highest thing which experience reveals to us is the intelligent ego, which, when spoken of, we designate as person. Removing, therefore every idea of the imperfect as found in human, or imaginable in limited, personalities, we apply (for by so doing we guard the proper thought) the word person to the Supreme Being. As, therefore, we apply the word being to God, though no other being is like to Him, so, with just reason, we ascribe personality to God, though no other person is like to Him. The charge of anthro pomorphism against us (as derived from our idea of Divine personality) is the last possible extreme of logical injqstice. Because being is predicated of God, do we ascribe to him * Byron. f to iv, to bv and raya&amp;ov Ens, Unum, and Bonum transcend all categories, and are, as Metaphysicians know, convertible with one another?in fact, different names for the same transcendental thing. D 2</page><page sequence="8">36 Tlze New Koran Refuted. the limitedness and imperfection of experimental beings, as of a stone, an animal, a monkey ? Because personality is affirmed of the Deity we are by Professor Tyndall adjudged to ascribe to the Deity the limitedness, the affections, the very shape and figure of a human person! The definition of a person or personality, given by Bobthius as far back as the sth century, was supposilum zindividuujz razionaiis nalurax It is that still adopted. It embraces tie ideas of substance, unity, inlellitence. No other idea is to be imported into the significance of the term, person, and the " unworthy concep tions," the " limitations " and " imperfections," if any, associated with it, are the spontaneous gift of the pantheist-the outrrowth of ignorance and unbelief. If Professor Tyndall allows his Organism to be permeated with these salutary notions touching Personality; and if, still farther, he eliminates from the same organism, the gross delusions and nebulous conceptions of German Pantheism, we shall have no difficulty to accept his AManchester declaration as equal to a pro fession of belief in One God. We shall rejoice at the consummation. \WJe shall hail it in some sense as " The Truce of God." We shall faithfully observe it, and trouble the Professor no more with dissertations on the nature and mode of subsistence of the Suprenle Ineffable Being. 4, 4: 4 4 * 4 In consequence of recenit occurrences,4 we omit here the proofs furnished by Natural Reason for the Existence and attributes of a Personal God, as well as those which evince Design in His works. XVe Eome to the second and third of the three great neg-ations, wvhich distinguish the English Infidel School, of which Professor Tyndall has made himself the exponent and the oracle. These negations are, as Mr. Mivart expresses it, the negation of the soul, and of human liberty and duty. As -to the first, Professor Tyndall will concede to the human soul at least as much nobleness of nature as he claims for his unseen atoms. He will alloxv that the soul may, as an existing thing, be undecomposable, indestruc tible by any cosmic force. In this case, if the soul is to perish, it * We allude, of course, to the well-known avowal of Professor Tyndall, at Manchester, Oct. 28. The Irish Times reports as follows :?"Professor Tyndall inaugurated a series of popular scientific lectures in the Free Trade Hall, Man chester, last night. The subject which he selected was that of molecular forces. In the course of his lecture the Professor said* that the revelations of science should rather increase than diminish our wonder at the phenomena of nature. * I have often asked myself,' he continued, ' whether there was no being or thing in the universe which knew more about its mysteries than I do.' No man capable of profound thought would, in the lecturer's opinion, answer that question, by profess ing the creed of Atheism, which had been so lightly attributed to himself. These words were cheered again and again, and the Professor was obliged to suspend his discourse for several minutes to allow the enthusiasm of the audience to sub side." The reader, anxious for the arguments here omitted, may consult the recent pamphlets of Martineau and Pritchard.</page><page sequence="9">The New Koran Refuted. 37 can perish by only annihilation. * Nature, as far as we can witness her procedure, gives no example of simple annihilations, and this, in Professor Tyndall's system, would seem to suffice for the proof of the soul's unending being. We, however, require sterner proof for our thesis. That substance will perish, even if it be by annihi lation, which God has willed to perish. Have we any indications of God's will as to the future of the soul of man ? We have; and here it is to be noted, that what is called by an able American writer, " the madness of method" of the Infidel and Pantheistic School, is not to be suffered in the question we now approach. Neither the microscope nor the micrometer is a fitting instrument, nor the eye of the physicist a fitting organ, to survey the " promise and potenicy " of the human soul. The inspection of its character and destiny belongs to Ihe whole man, the intellectual and moral man of high synthetic grasp, rather than to the mere optician aLnd the decomposing analyst of matter. The immortality of the human soul, then, may be proved, not only from the general belief of the doctrine in all ages, but from the equally extensive prevalence of a dread of annihilation. The mind of man revolts at the idea of ceasing for ever to exist. Existence, even the depths of misery, is less dreadful to the mind than the-thought of eternal non-existence. Addison and others supplement this argument by a reference to the capability of the hunman mind to advance progressively in knowledge, without reach ing perfection in this vorld. The brute creation arrives at limits, beyond which it cannot pass. No such limits are imposed upon the human being. He goes indefinitely onward, from one degree to another of attainment, investigating with increasing anxiety every department of inquiry in the realms of both mind and matter. Can we suppose that the soul thus endowed with an insatiable thirst t for knowledge, which it incessantly seeks to gratify, without * This statement seems for its validity to postulate the simple, inextended and spiritual nature of the human soul. In reality, it does not do so ; as, in the supposition of Leibnitz's monads, the immortality of the soul of man might still be maintained. The soul of man, however, is, as all its operations attest, in extended and immaterial. Thought is no outgrowth of material particles or material movements. Even in the lowest organisms, no authenticated instance of Life emerging from aught but antecedent Life, had ever been found. Tyndall him self admits the fact ; and, declaring Bishop Butler's reasoning unanswerable, he calls for a new definition of matter?seeks but finds not an Archimedean fulcrum for his hypothesis?and lastly, in order to destroy in matter the potency and promise of terrestrial Life and thought, he is forced to transcend the bounds of experi ment, to prolong his vision beyond its horizon, and to cease, in so doing, to be a physicist or a philosopher. f "We possess powers and capacities," says Pritchard {Mod. Science and Rel. p. 9), " immeasurably beyond the necessities of any merely transitory life. There stir within us yearnings irrepressible, longings unutterable, a curiosity un satisfied and insatiable by aught we see. These appetites .... are the indications of something akin to something immeasurably beyond us ; tokens of something attainable, yet not hitherto attained : signs of a potential fellowship with spirits nobler and more glorious than our own : they are the title-deeds of our presumptive heirship to some brighter world than any that has yet been formed among the starry spangles of the skies."</page><page sequence="10">38 The New Koran Refuted. ever being sated, will, after the lapse of a few years, be arrested in its onward course, and plunged into eternal non-existence? An argument for the immortality of the soul may also be derived from a contemplation of the attributes of God. He is the Creator and moral Governor of the world. He has endowed man with earnest longings after immortality. It cannot be that FHe designs to mock us bv rendering these desires fruitless. Were such the case, the condition of man, prime though he be among living things, would be more pitiable and inexplicable than that of the brutes which obey him. Animals possess, as far as we know, neither aptitudes for, nor desires of, a future. God has endued them with no capacity for survival after death. Bishop Butler's admission on this point is neither in accordance with general feeling nor with philosophic reasons. If the belluine vital principle survived after death, it would be undue, objectless, inane, superfluous. It is otherwise with man. The veracity and justice of the Creator would forget themselves, if there were in store for man a destination such that he could not be completely happy except by zgnoranice or disbelief of it. Let us suppose, then, that the soul were perishable, and that a belief in the mortality of the thinking principle in man-that is, man's proper self; were fully established. The following con sequences would, in practical life, be unavoidably derived from this belief: I. That, as no distinction is placed by the Author of Nature between vice and virtue (one being often the means of felicity, the other of sorrow, in this life), the distinction between them is null, or God is unjust, both of which are incredible and absurd. 2. That, in any case, when the interest of Society requires great inconvenience or even suffering of some individual member let us say his death-there can be no full obligation to undergo such inconvenience. 3. That suicide, to avoid suffering, is just and prudent; and that, as the sufferings of this life (were it considered our only sphere of being) are more than its enjoyments, the destruction of them selves by the whole human race would be an heroic act, and a consummation much to be desired. 4. That, in proportion as the nations of the earth advanced towards greater civilization, a false doctrine, on the most important of all points of personal interest to each, became more firmly estab lished-more clearly defined, and further and further removed from objective truth. 5. That several of the noblest faculties and instincts of the human soul are anomalous in Creahton and even deceptive-as, for instance, our horror of non-existence. Now, if such is the uniformity with which the capacities and aptitudes of each living thing are adjusted to, and foreshow its coming stage of existence, its future theatre of action, as in the bee, the beaver, the ant, &amp;c., is it right to break the analogy when</page><page sequence="11">The New Koran Refuted. 39 we come to the human soul, and to conceive that its natural characters, its hopes, fears, faculties, and aspirations, are mere deceptions, and furnish no guarantee for the realisation of wvhat they promise ? There is no adequate rewarding of virtue and lustice in this life; vice often passes unpunished and triumnphant. If there is no future state to distribute to virtue its reward, and to vice its punish ment, why has the Author of Nature made us responsible beings ? Why has He given us a Conscience, an outlook to futurly, and a longing for it? Why has He bestowed upon us a capacity which enables us to converse with infinities of Time, Space, and Reality of Perfection, as with familiar and not estranged things; and if we are, in truth, the ministers and interpreters of Nature, why should the monster delusion-the promise to the ear and breach unto the heart-be reserved for man alone among Nature's works ? From these and many other rea?ons we are forced to the con clusion-highly probable, say " or rather " absolutely cogent-that the soul of man will subsist in a future world. it_ -And live Unhurt amidst the war of elements, The wreck of matter and the crush of worlds." The intimations of Reason, it is needless to say, are confirmed by the assurances of Christian Faith. The New Koran, throutgh which Mr. Tyndall endeavours to contradict these truths, derives no recommendation from the fact that its chief prophet eschews a contemplation of the ethical con sequences deducible fronm his system. These consequences have been eloquently set forth in the October number of this periodical,' and later still by the prelates of the Irish Church, in their joint pastoral of October 3 1. The prelates observe " If man be but a-conscious automaton-a machine constructed of organized matter-if the soul be but a function of the nervous system-the act of volition must be governed by laws similar to those which govern the other phenomena of matter. Hence it follows that the will must obey the irresistible impulse of these laws, and the attribute of liberty belongs to man's will no more than to the hurricane which ravages the tropics, or to the carthquake which engulfs cities. " And if man's will be not free, then moral responsibility ceases to exist, and the legislation which, by Divine or human authority, metes out to criminals punishment for their offences, is nothing but a colossal injustice. Vice and virtue are but equal expressions of the same mechanical force; there can be no sin, as there can be no holiness. It is not possible to read without a shudder of disgust the statement boldly enunciated a few weeks ago, that the human understanding, the passion of sensual love, and the religious feeling in man,.are all equally results of the play between organism and environment through countless ages of the past." The truths we have hitherto stated may be termed the natural gos pelof mankind.

It is amusing-absolutelyamusing, notwithstanding the gravity of the issue-to mark the vague and uncertain character of the forces which the New Koran opposes to these truths, " He is not the best shoe maker who makes the best shoes, but who makes the best shoes with the materials at his disposal."* On this principle we may award to Professor Tyndall a full claim to the celebrity he enjoys. Remarkable, indeed,, is the slenderness of the materials with which he operates. Atoms, evolution, organism and environment, asso ciated experiences, indestructibility of force, continuity of nature these are the materials (should we not rather say the names ?) with which Mr. Tyndall proposes to displace the old world and to con struct a new. No fulcrum, Archimedean or other, is demanded. A few worthies, unkennelled from their base environment in ancient or modern days, are, like Samson's foxes, strunr together by the tails and let loose by the prophet against,, as he deems them, an unscientific generation. Lucretius of old, Giordano Bruno of the middle ages, and Mr. Herbert Spencer of recent days, are promi nent in the crowd. Were all these, both men and forces, willing to do battle at the command of Professor Tyndall, they would avail little to achieve the intended object. As matters are, the names and forces relied on are either at one with the philosophy of mankind as hitherto accepted, or their opposition to it is but conjectural, uncertain and unestablished. The atoms, for example, are neither verified to us by experiment nor made clear by necessary reasoning, What are they? Is matter divisible ad infini'lzem, or is it not? If not, the continuity of nature is rudely broken, and divisibility and compressibility, which run down through all material existences, stop short when you come to the unseen things called atoms. Is their supposed infinite hardness a contingent or a necessary quality? Is it not possible for infinite power to break one of those so-called niz?itis or a/oms ? Are they each of a triple dimension with an under surface, an upper surface, and ends and sides? Do they possess polaritj, attraction, repulsion, and innate or essential motion ? Do they coincide with the points of Boscovich, or with the monads of Leibnitz? Does not the Daltonian law of chemical equivalents or combining proportions extend to the larger as to the smaller and ultimate particles of " matter ?" Was it not for the purpose of keeping clear of such assumptions as we now indulge in, that Wallaston and Davy rightly srejected the name "atomic theory" (for the law of combining proportions of matter) and proposed the more definite and truth ful name of " chemical equivalents," or " multiple proportions ?" Were not the great discoverers of these laws-Dalton, Wollas ton, Davy, as well as their latest exponents, Maxwvell and Andrews, devout believers in the spiritual subsistence of God and of the *Aristotle.</page><page sequence="13">The New Koran Reftted. 41 human soul? Does not the following statement from a popular book of science4 express nearly all that we know for certain on the subject of atoms ?-" Every body is supposed to consist of atoms of unknown size, form, and weight, which being supposed infinitely hard cannot be further subdivided. . . . No atom has ever been seen, even by the most powerful microscopes, al though particles of bodies less than 300,000 of an inch in diameter have been seen by their aid. The forms of atoms are, therefore, unknown." With elements, invisible, unknown, and supposed, such as atoms are, any skilful conjurer, even the author of the "New Koran," can play just what tricks he pleases. Before ousting the authority of ages, however, in behalf of suclh tricks, we must have some greater authority on this point than Demo critus orTyndall. We must ask such men as Newton, or Leibnitz, or Boscovich, or Dalton, or, last of all, the Herschells or the Max wells. The Professor cannot be ignorant what answers, as to the relation of atoms to an irntelligent cause, these meni have left on1 record. Evolution, whether organic with Mr. Darwin, or mental and psychological with Herbert Spencer, is another of those ventures to which prophets and men of " advanced thought," aspiring to a certain fame are not unaccustomed. Of Mr. Darwin's theory, though worked out by the author with great care and reverence,t Spencer somewhere admits that it is at present, and probably will "for ever remain, a mere hypothesis ;" wvhile of Ernest H1eckel's Anthropogeny or Development of Mlan (Leipzig, 1874), the most recent criticism is to the following effect:-" He does not consider that the graduation of forms is equally explicable on the hypothesis of an external agency working according to a preconceived plan, or of a plastic force immanent in all existence, and that if these, as must be conceded, are but precarious inferences from imper fectly understood phenomena, the capacity of anything to meta morphose itself into another thing is, until the transition has been actually observed, just such another questionable corollary. He would probably contend that Mr. Darwin's generalization has placed the matter on a different footing; but it is the misfortune of his book that he is compelled to refer habitually to the Dar winian theory as an established truth, without having space, or, as we suspect, inclination, to combat the numerous scruples which must present themselves to those who are even slightly acquainted with the literature of the subject."T Of the two principal works of Mr. Herbert Spencer (",New Philosophy " and " Psychology") the criticisms that reach us from * Beeton's Dictionary of Sciences?Art Atomic Weights. ^ f Darwin everywhere speaks of the Creator with great reverence, and leaves it uncertain whether one or more typical forms were placed on earth by Him originally. His system will be reviewed at a later date.

If this is Psychology, then logic is at an end, and human thought bids adieu to the world. 'The apotheosis of Mr. H. Spencer and his speculations occupies and disfigures pages 59 and 6o of Mr. Tyndall's Address. Of the "Correlation of Forces," introduced to save appearance by Mlr. Tyndall, we would speak more re spectfully. The writer who first unfolded that theory is now judge in an English court. He has within the last few days republished his book above-mentioned. Our third motto is from the preface to that book, and if the Professor adopts it in theory and pursues it in practice, there will be an end, as far as we are concerned, of all antagonism between Science and Religion. No section of mankind has done more to promote the study of the very branch of philosophy that delights Mr. Tyndall most-we mean Mo lecular Physics-than the Church has done. Gassendi, Descartes, Boscovich,t Bayma, and others, are ample evidence of this truth. When scientists, however, or rather specialists, forget the advice of Justice Grove, transcend the region of facts and relation of facts, in vade the dominion of philosophy (the mother of the sciences) and of the still higher dominion of theology, disestablishing and destroying the most sacred heritages of both, it is time in the interest of those great inheritances, of truth, and of this great universe at large, to challenge the invaders and ask under what warrant they proceed. We have so done, as time and circumstances have allowed us, with the author of the " New Koran." A thousand voices more potent than ours, have done the same. The Prophet has lowered his tone; he has recanted or explained. Something more remains to be done. Pantheism is distinctly to be renounced. The dig nity and destiny of the human soul are to be acknowledged. The essential and ineffaceable characters of vice and virtue arm, to be proclaimed. A few books of Christian philosophy and theology may be admitted, besides those of Bishop Butler, into the Pro fessor's library. Thomas Carlyle and Herbert Spencer are not to be adored; nor is the great belluine or materialistic school of Germany to be abjectly follQwed. Should Professor Tyndall accept these suggestions, there is much to be expected from his fearless devotion to truth, from his admittedly high powers, both of research * See the Catholic World, New York, Feb. 1872, Art. Cosmi. Philos, and Dublin Review, Oct, 1874, Art. Herbert Spencer's Psychology. f Father Boscovich has obtained a world-wide fame for what is known as Boscovich's theory. Father Bayma, in his ** Molecular Physics," published in England, a few years since, has brought to this subject an amount of speculative insight as well as high mathematical skill, which must command admiration. These last-mentioned writers were both of the Society of Jesus.</page><page sequence="15">The New Koran Refuted. 43 and elucidation and his intimate acquaintance with the many sci ences to which years of study and observation have introduced him. Should our suggestion be neglected, and the Professor continue, as hitherto, his abject idolatry of Lucretius, Herbert Spencer, and the specialists of Germany, we shall say, that we regret the fact, but fear not the result. "There is no need," says thie eloquent Professor of Astronomy at Oxford, " to be frightened at the phan toms raised by such terms as matter, and force, and molecules, and protoplasmic energy, and rhythmic vibrations of the brain; or in that which denies all evidence of design in nature, or in that which assimilates the motives which induce a parent to support his offspring, to the pleasures derived from wine and music, or in that which asserts the unknowableness of the Supreme and the vanity of prayer. Philosophies which involve -such results can have no permanent grasp on human nature; they are in them selves suicidal, and in their turn, and after their day, will, like other such philosophies, be refuted or denied by the next comer, and are doomed to accomplish the happy despatch." Opinionum commenta delet dies, nature judzcia confirmas, said the Roman philo sopher.* The conjectures, prophecies, prolonged visions, and shadowy generalizations of Professor Tyndall-which we have ventured to style the New Koran-will vanish with other such systems into the " infinite azure of the past," while the belief of a Living, Personal Creator and of Man's Immortal Destiny shall, like the molecules described by Professor Maxwell, remain as the "foundations of the universe," unbroken and unworn. * The Church is in many places taunted by Professor Tyndall with its slow ness in adopting new theories and adapting itself, as he says, to new " environ ments " of thought. Were the charge to the effect that the Christian Church persistently rejects ascertained facts and establislhed laws of the human mind as applied to such facts, it is met simply and sufficiently by a denial. If the new theory is simply on its trial, and especially if it seems to jar with well-established maxims of reason,and experience, surely mankind in such case can afford to wait a little before giving full adhesion to the novel ideas. Justice Grove rejoiced that his views on the 'I' Correlation of Physical forces" met, for a long time, with " the opposition usual and," as he says, "proper to novel ideas." The frequent adoption of a different course would involve, lie observes, "' an anarchy of thought -a perpetuity of mental revolutions." The advice The friends thou hast and their adoption tried, Grapple them to thy soul with hooks of steel, But do not dull thy palm with entertainment Of each new-hatch'd-unfledged comrade is as applicable to systems and theories, as it is to friends, and the great Bard but utters, in the person of Polonius, the wise miaxims which have ever guided the Christian Church.
