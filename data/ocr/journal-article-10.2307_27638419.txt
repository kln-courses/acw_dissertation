It has cast its long shadow over the entire history of inter pretation of the biblical narrative in Gen 11:1-9 in which it is found. In this inter pretive history, the "tower with its top in the heavens" (11:4 NRSV) has been adopted as the key to the story's theme: the human attempt to assert autonomy, attack heaven, and challenge God. The division of languages and dispersion of peo ples?that is, the origin of the world s cultures?that concludes the story of Babel is inseparably linked to this iconic symbol. Differentiating the worlds peoples is the sign of Gods displeasure with the tower; it is both the penalty for human pride and the means to restrain further assertions of it. The pride-and-punishment reading of the story of Babel is already firmly fixed in the earliest extant interpretation of Gen 11:1-9 in the book of Jubilees (ca. 200 B.c.E.), where it is found in the authors explanatory additions to his retelling of the biblical narrative. It has been embraced with little basic variation by both Jewish and Christian exegetes throughout the history of interpretation, and it is still dominant in recent scholarly commentaries on Genesis. Outside of biblical scholarship, this reading of the Babel story has been given broad cultural legitimacy in classics such as John Milton's Paradise Lost, in many works of art such as Pieter Brueghel's mas terpiece, and in all children's story Bibles.1 1 For the earliest interpreters, see James Kugel, "The Tower of Babel," in Traditions of the Bible: A Guide to the Bible as It Was at the Start of the Common Era (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1998), 228-42.

C. Escher, 29</page><page sequence="2">30 Journal of Biblical Literature 126, no. 1 (2007) Recently, a particular ancient version of this pride-and-punishment reading has become popular. This approach, defended most extensively by Christoph Uehlinger and supported by biblical scholars writing from liberation or postcolo nial perspectives, such as J. Severino Croatto, views the story as a critique of empire.2 According to this approach, the story is about pride and punishment, yet now the pride about which it speaks is the hubris of imperial domination, and the punishment it describes is God's judgment on the empires, in particular Babylon (Babel), that oppressed Israel and Judah.3 The emphasis on one language at the beginning of the story represents the imperial suppression of local languages and cultures, and God's punishment brings down the empire with its monolithic aims, setting free the local languages and cultures to flourish. This contemporary approach builds on an ancient view, which appears first in Josephus {Ant. 1.113-14) and is adopted widely afterward, that the building of Babel in Gen 11:1-9 was really an imperial venture masterminded by the violent king Nimrod, who is identified with Babel in the genealogy in Gen 10:8-10. In recent years, a few interpreters have begun to question aspects of the tra ditional pride-and-punishment reading of the story and have given greater atten tion to the story's theme of cultural origins on its own terms. This approach began with the work of Bernhard W. Anderson, who, while retaining the basic pride-and punishment framework, also saw in the story "a conflict of centripetal and cen trifugal forces" and a prominent theme of the homogeneity versus the heterogeneity of peoples. He thus gave new emphasis to the story's explanation of the diversi fication of humankind after the flood.4 This shift away from the pride-and punishment reading toward a new interest in the story's theme of cultural Fyodor Dostoevsky, Raimundo Panikkar, Jacques Derrida, church school curricula, and children's story Bibles (Toppling the Tower: Essays on Babel and Diversity [ed. Theodore Hiebert; Chicago: McCormick Theological Seminary, 2004]). All modern critical commentaries on Genesis reflect this approach. 2 Christoph Uehlinger, Weltreich und "eine Rede": Eine neue Deutung der sogenannten Turm bauerz?hlung (Gen 11, 1-9) (Freiburg, Schweiz: Universit?tsverlag; G?ttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1990); J.

The story's terminology, explicit claims, and repetitive structure all focus on the tension between singularity and multiplicity with the purpose of explaining the origin and variety of the world's cultures. The image that provoked the traditional pride-and-punishment interpretation, the "tower with its top in the sky," has neither the central place in the story nor the ominous significance of rebellion that interpreters have traditionally believed. As we shall see, the icon of the tower standing unfinished is a product of the imagi nation of the story's interpreters. The story itself contains no such picture at all. Throughout the history of interpretation, the theme of cultural origins has been recognized as an important element in the story of Babel. This theme has given the story its traditional name in Judaism, for example, where Gen 11:1-9 has come to be known as the story of the Generation of Division (or Dispersion), as is already the case in Genesis Kabbah (38:1-ll).6 Furthermore, an occasional inter preter has suggested that God's dispersion of cultures is not merely a response to pride and an act of punishment but the intention of God all along, in light of God's command to "be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth" (Gen 1:28; 9:1). Yet no interpreter has entirely escaped the dominant pride-and-punishment reading of the story that has controlled exegetes from the beginning?with a single exception: the medieval scholar Abraham Ibn Ezra.7 With Ibn Ezra, an ancient pathfinder, I want to argue that the story of Babel is not about pride, nor about imperial power, but exclusively about the origin of the world's cultures. Genesis 11:1-9 is one of two accounts of the spread of the human race across the earth after the flood, the other being the genealogical account of the descen dants of Noah's sons that immediately precedes it in ch. 10. That Genesis 10 and 11 are genuine variants of the same event, rather than one continuous account, can be seen in the chronological discontinuity between the conclusion of ch. 10?where 5 Ellen van Wolde, "The Tower of Babel as Lookout of Genesis 1-11," in Words Become Worlds: Semantic Studies of Genesis 1-11 (Leiden: Brill, 1994), 84-109; Terence Fretheim, "Genesis," NIB 1:410-14; Walter Brueggemann, Genesis: A Bible Commentary for Teaching and Preaching (Inter pretation; Atlanta: John Knox, 1982), 97-104. 6 For a survey of other rabbinic references, see Menachem Kasher, Encyclopedia of Biblical Interpretation (ed. and trans.

These variants have traditionally been explained by attributing the genealog ical version in ch. 10 to Priestly (P) tradition and the narrative version in ch. 11 to the Yahwist (J). Recent years have seen much debate about the sources of Genesis, including the shape and (even) the existence of the Yahwist. While I stand among those who believe that traditional source analysis still explains the shape of Gene sis more ably than newer proposals, and that the story of Babel in Gen 11:1-9 is a classic J text, the argument here about the meaning of the story depends not on such an attribution but on the logic of the story's form and content itself. At the same time, understanding the author as the Yahwist enriches one's understanding of the story and, in particular, its role in Genesis as a whole.8 Some scholars have argued for the composite nature of Gen 11:1-9, including Hermann Gunkel, who wished to isolate city and tower recensions behind the Yah wist's narrative, and more recently Uehlinger, whose anti-empire interpretation depends on four discrete literary layers.9 Yet the majority of scholars have seen in the story a cohesive literary structure and a beautifully crafted whole, including those who have done the key studies of the literary architecture of Gen 11:1-9, U. Cassuto, Isaac M. Kikawada, J. P. Fokkelman, and Ellen van Wolde.10 They are in 8 Genesis 11:1-9 reflects many classic J characteristics: an anthropomorphic deity, descending from heaven, referred to consistently by the divine name ni?T (w. 5,6,8,9); a concise, colorful style; an unscientific folk etymology (^11, "Babel," does not derive from V?!, "mix"; cf.

Gen 10:18; Exod 5:12; Num 10:35 [ySti in Gen 9:19]), nnn, "Come ... !" (w. 4, 7; cf. Gen 38:16; Exod 1:10 ["give" in Gen 29:21; 47:15, 16]), injrr^N UT?, "a man to his neighbor" (w. 3, 7; cf. Gen 15:10; 31:49; 43:33), the interjection p, "behold" (v. 6; cf. Gen 3:22; 4:14; 15:3; 19:34; 27:11, 37; 28:7; 30:34; 39:8; 44:3; 47:23), and the hiphil stem of V?n, "begin" (v. 6; cf. Gen 4:26; 6:1; 9:20; 10:8; 44:12; Num 25:1). 9 Hermann Gunkel believed that Genesis 11 incorporated a tower story about scattering and a city story about the multiplication of languages (Genesis [1922; trans. Mark E. Biddle; Macon, GA: Mercer University Press, 1977], 94-102). Uehlinger's four editions of the story include: an eighth century critique of the Assyrian Empire (w. la, 3aa, 4a?vo, 5-7,8b), an exilic revision to critique the Babylonian Empire (w. lb, 3aab, 9a), a further revision to link the story to the primeval narrative (v. 2), and a final revision in the Persian period to introduce the concept of dispersion (w. 4b, 8a, 9b; Weltreich, 514-84).

The first half focuses on human activity (w. 1-4), while the second half, following God's descent to inspect the human project at the midpoint of the story (v. 5), focuses on divine activity (w. 6-9). The parallel elements that replicate the structure of the halves at the same time reverse their content: human activity and divine activity move in opposite directions. In the analysis that follows, I will build on the literary conclusions in these studies, but I wish to show that these literary features provide important clues that the story is not about human pride or imperial power but about the origins of cultural difference. I. The Human Project (Genesis 11:1-4) 1 All the earth had one language and the same words. 2When they traveled toward the east, they found a valley in the land of Shinar, and they settled there. 3They said to one another, "Come, let us make bricks and let us fire them." The bricks were stones for them, and asphalt was mortar for them. 4And they said, "Come, let us build for ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the sky, and let us make a name for ourselves, so that we will not be dispersed over the surface of all the earth."11 Interpreters throughout history have taken a single image, the "tower with its top in the sky," as the clue to unlock the intent and meaning of the human project described in the first part of the story of Babel. The tower does not actually appear, however, until v. 4, and, as will be seen in the analysis that follows, it is neither the center of attention in the opening episode of the story nor the purpose for which the human project is undertaken. We will consider the tower's role in detail in a moment. In order to grasp the central theme of the story's first part, we must start at its beginning. The theme of part 1 is stated straightforwardly in the story's opening sentence: "All the earth had one language and the same words" (v. 1). This story is about lan guage; in particular, it is about the existence of a single, uniform language spoken by all people. To emphasize this theme the narrator repeats it, employing the num ber "one" twice: "one language" (nriN nau&gt;) and "one (collection of) words" (Dm*T DHnN).12 The story's theme?one language spoken by all people?is repeated later in the story in the opening sentence of part 2, where God responds to the human project. God's opening speech, just as the narrator's opening sentence, focuses on one language spoken by all people. God, just as the narrator has done, repeats the word "one" twice: "There is now one people ("Tritt DP) and they all have one Ian 11 All biblical translations are my own unless otherwise noted. 12 Gunkel states: "The two expressions are combined for the sake of emphasis" (Genesis, 95).</page><page sequence="6">34 Journal of Biblical Literature 126, no. 1 (2007) guage (nnN n_DU7)" (v. 6). The key word, n_U&gt;, "language," is used five times in the story (w. 1, 6, 7 [2x], 9) and its synonym, DHn, "words," once (v. 1). In the story's opening sentence, the narrator identifies the people speaking a single language as ^nNn'^D, which should be understood as "all the (people of the) earth" (cf. Gen 9:19 [J]; Pss 33:8; 66:4). This is confirmed in w. 2-4, where pKirta serves as the antecedent of the plural pronouns and verb forms that are employed for the human actors in part 1. Later at the story's midpoint, where God comes down to inspect the human project, the narrator refers to these people as DTKH ^1, the human race (v. 5).13 Furthermore, the motif of dispersion in part 2 assumes that these builders are the human ancestors of all people to follow, since it is by dis persing them that God populates the entire earth (w. 8, 9). When the story's nar rator uses pNH'^D for the earth itself, rather than for all of its people, he employs the phrase p?H"ta ^?3"bp, "on the surface of all the earth" (w. 4, 8, 9). The identity of the builders in part 1 has often been missed or misconstrued. On account of the etiology of Babel (Babylon) at the conclusion of the narrative, early interpreters took the story to be about the Babylonians in particular, rather than about the human race as a whole. To support this reading, they imported the figure of Nimrod from the genealogy in ch. 10, where he is identified as the king of Babel (10:8-10), and they enthroned him as the royal mastermind behind the tower of Babel and the instigator of the rebellion against God.14 Thus, the story was localized and was read as an account of the wicked Babylonians in particular, rather than as a story about the human race as a whole. As noted above, this way of read ing the story is one of the earliest interpretive shifts in our sources, found already in the Antiquities of Josephus (1.113-14), and it became a fixture in the history of interpretation. It resonated well with the traditional idea that pride motivated the human project, since the arrogance of the builders could now be equated with the imperial dominion of the wicked empire that destroyed Jerusalem. The legacy of this approach can still be seen in the inclination among modern scholars to regard Gen 11:1-9 as a satire of Babylon rather than an account of the dispersion of the human race.15 Shifting the identity of the builders from the human race to the Babylonians is particularly important for the postcolonial reading of Gen 11:1-9 as a critique of empire and of the intent of one culture to impose its control on other peoples.16 13 The Yahwist uses D*TNn, "humanity/the human race," for all humankind throughout the flood story which precedes the Babel narrative (Gen 6:5, 6, 7; 8:21). 14 Kugel, Traditions, 229-32. 15 E.g., Gerhard von Rad, Genesis: A Commentary (trans.

Wenham, Genesis 1-15 (WBC 1; Waco: Word Books, 1987), 244-46; Anderson, "Tower of Babel," 192. 16 Uehlinger sees the story's original kernel, as he reconstructs it, as an account of the Assyr</page><page sequence="7">Hiebert: The Tower of Babel 35 While a critique of empire is certainly present in the prophets and elsewhere, such an ideological perspective goes beyond the actual language of this story. It is, of course, precarious to import a Babylonian king from the genealogical traditions in Genesis 10 in order to interpret Genesis 11. This storyteller mentions no king with imperial pretensions, but attributes the project in w. 1-4 to the people, using plu ral pronouns and verbs throughout. No uniquely royal or imperial language is pres ent.17 Furthermore, empire is anachronistic within the boundaries of this story, which is about the entire human race, not about one culture imposing its will on another. The single language that all of the people speak is not imposed by an impe rial edict but reflects the reality of a single family surviving the flood. The aim of the project, as we shall see immediately below, has nothing to do with extending the reach of empire but just the opposite: staying in one place (v. 4). The story, thus, is not about the suppression of difference between cultures but about the origins of difference itself. The naming of the point of origin as Babel at the end of the story (v. 9), as we shall see later, derives not from its role in the Bible as the seat of empire but from its role as the cradle of civilization. The narrator thus "titles" his story at the beginning of part 1, "(The story of the time when) all the earth had one language," a "title" that is reiterated and empha sized in God's words at the beginning of part 2: "There is now one people and they all have one language." Following this opening "title," the narrative describes the human project itself: all the inhabitants of the earth settle in Shinar, the Mesopo tamian Valley (v. 2), and plan the construction of a city and a tower with fired brick, the customary material for monumental public projects (w. 3-4).18 At the conclu sion of the description of this grand project, the narrator explains the builders' motive: "so that we will not be dispersed over the surface of all the earth" (v. 4b). Traditionally, of course, interpreters have taken the motive for this building proj ect to be an arrogant attack on God?or, alternatively, imperial domination?but since the narrator says nothing about pride, defiance, dominion, or, for that mat ter, sin, the people's pride had to be inferred, and the image adopted for this infer ence was the "tower with its top in the sky" (v. 4). In a striking exegetical feat, remarkable both for its imagination and its blindness, interpreters managed to side ian Empire (w. la, 3aa, 4a?yO, 5-7,8b), and the story, as first revised, as an account of the Babylonian Empire (w. lb, 3aab, 9a; Weltreich, 514-57). 17 Uehlinger is certainly correct that the motifs of tower building and making a name are found in Mesopotamian royal inscriptions (Weltreich, 372-96,505-6). But in the Hebrew Bible these motifs are used in a variety of contexts and not limited to royal contexts or imperial claims, as will be seen below. 18 Fired brick was used in Mesopotamia for important public structures, sun-dried brick for less important and domestic dwellings. See Joan Goodnick Westenholz, "Babylon?Place of Cre ation of the Great Gods," in Royal Cities of the Biblical World (ed. Joan Goodnick Westenholz; Jerusalem: Bible Lands Museum, 1996), 204-6.</page><page sequence="8">36 Journal of Biblical Literature 126, no. 1 (2007) step the narrators explicit statement of the builders' motive: "so that we will not be dispersed over the surface of all the earth" (v. 4). The grammatical structure of the final sentence of part 1 makes the people s motive absolutely clear. "And they said, 'Come, let us build for ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the sky, and let us make a name for ourselves, so that we will not be dispersed over the surface of all the earth'" (v. 4). After the introductory clause, "And they said," this sentence is composed of an imperative, Hin, "Come," and two cohortatives?7\X21, "let us build," and TWyi, "let us make"?followed by a final clause introduced by the negative Hebrew conjunction ja, which may be translated "lest," or "that not" ("so that. . . not").19 This conjunction is employed, as Gesenius notes, "after an appeal to do or not do an action by which something may be prevented." Thus, the appeal preceding the conjunction is not an end in itself, but simply the means "by which something may be prevented," and that pre vention represents the goal of the previous appeal. Such an appeal, as here, is cus tomarily expressed with cohortative verbs.20 Thus, building a city and a tower and making a name are all simply means to achieve the actual goal of this activity, stated in the sentence's final clause: "so that we will not be dispersed over the surface of all the earth." The actual motive for the human project, stated explicitly in the narrative, is the people s desire to stay in one place. The theme of one language, introduced in the opening words of part 1, is now supplemented by the theme of one place, intro duced in the final words of part 1. Together, these themes frame the description of the human project in w. 2-4 and explain its purpose. All of the inhabitants of the earth speak one language and wish to live in one place. The story is thus about the cultural homogeneity of the human race?characterized here by a single language and location?and about the desire to preserve it. As noted in the introduction, this theme has been recognized in the story and in the design of the human proj ect throughout the history of interpretation, but it has been relegated to a subplot under the theme of human pride and defiance. Because the theme of pride has dominated past interpretation of the human project, and because the tower with its top in the sky has incited this approach, it is important to take a moment to point out the serious weaknesses in this inter pretation. The basic weakness is the fact, already noted, that the narrator never uses the word "pride" or any equivalent term and that this entire idea was inferred from a single image, the "tower with its top in the sky." But as we have just seen in the grammatical analysis of v. 4, building the tower was not the purpose of the human project at all but simply a means to achieve its ultimate aim, the peoples goal to 19 The LXX translates ]? with 7tp?, "before (we are scattered)," suggesting that the people knew they were to be scattered and, in the spirit of the traditional reading, making them culpable for their actions by resisting God's plans. 20GKC, 107q, 152w.</page><page sequence="9">Hiebert: The Tower of Babel 37 stay in one place. Furthermore, two other important problems exist for basing an interpretation of the human project on its tower. First, the tower is not the narrator's center of attention. It is mentioned only twice and then only in the stock phrase VtAQI "Vp, "a city and a tower" (w. 4, 5). E. A. Speiser and others have seen here a hendiadys, in which the two terms are employed to represent a single idea, an urban complex incorporating a tower, "a city crowned by a tower."21 In this sense, the tower is an aspect of the cityscape the nar rator describes, rather than the primary object of attention. This is supported in the second half of the story, where the city comes to the fore and the tower falls out of the narrative entirely. In part 2, when the narrator describes the end of the human project?"they stopped building the city" (v. 8)?the city is mentioned alone, with no reference to the tower. The presence of "tower" after "city" in v. 8 of the LXX (and the Samaritan Pentateuch and Jubilees) is a secondary expansion. It represents a harmonizing addition typical of the LXX (cf. w. 4, 5), as Ronald Hendel shows.22 It may also indicate the influence of the traditional interpretation of Genesis 11 at this early stage. Indeed, the etymology that concludes the story is concerned with the city (Babel = Babylon; v. 9), not the tower. The narrator's real interest lies in the city rather than the tower. Recognizing this, Terence Fretheim has titled his com mentary on Gen 11:1-9, "The City of Babel."23 It is only because interpreters have for so long believed the tower to be the clue to the story's meaning, as James Kugel has pointed out, that we now regularly refer to the whole story, as "The Tower of Babel."24 One last problem, perhaps the most serious problem, with the traditional approach is that the phrase describing the tower, "its top in the sky" (D^Q^l ?^fcCl), turns out to be just an ancient Near Eastern clich? for height and implies neither an attempt to scale the heavens nor an arrogant revolt against divine authority. As an idiom for impressive height, this phrase appears often in descriptions of fortifica tions and cultic installations, both of which incorporated towers. A similar phrase is used twice in Deuteronomy to describe the fortifications (nil^l) of the formi dable Canaanite cities the Israelites encountered: D^OUJl rmifll rblX D'HP, "large cities with walls sky-high" (Deut 1:28; 9:1 NJPS). A variation of this idiom is used for the fortifications of the Judean city of Azekah by Sennacherib in an Assyrian text, where he describes its walls "reaching high to heaven" (ana AN-e s?-qu-u).25 21E.

Using Deut 1:28 to support his view, Ibn Ezra claimed that "a tower with its top in the sky" should be taken as an idiom for height, not a literal descrip tion, asserting, "The builders of the tower were not fools to believe that they could actually ascend the heavens."26 Variations of the same idiom are also used to describe cultic installations in Israel and Mesopotamia. In the account of Jacob's visit to Bethel, its ?bv is described with the phrase no*Ott;n jrao WtiT\, "its top touching the sky" (Gen 28:12). Cus tomarily translated "ladder," ?bo (sull?m), like the related terms Tibbv, "mound, siege ramp," and ?"6oQ, "highway," is probably a constructed height like the raised platform in the cultic center at Dan.27 In Mesopotamia, this idiom is ubiquitous in descriptions of the height of ziggurats and temple complexes.28 Babylon's main tem ple precinct, for example, was named Esagila, "House whose head is raised high"; and the description of its construction in Enuma Elish plays on this meaning: "They raised high the head [ull? r?sisu] of Esagila equaling Apsu" (VI:62; ANET, 69). The great ziggurat in Babylon was named Etemenanki, "House that is the foundation of heaven and earth," identifying it as a point of connection between the two realms. Another example from Babylon, from the date formulae of the reign of Ham murabi, is even closer to the biblical idiom: "He restored the temple ?.me.te.ur.sag ("The Pride of the Hero") and built the temple tower, the mighty abode of Zababa (and) Innana, whose top is sky high [sag-bi an-dtm il-la] ..." (ANET, 270). With this evidence in mind, the tower with its top in the sky (1UWV1 blXD D^QUJl, v. 4) must be understood simply as a feature of the magnificence of the city in which it stands. Whether it should be viewed as a part of the city's fortifications or one of its cultic structures is actually difficult to determine. Because the city is identified in the story as Babylon (Babel, v. 9), its tower has been identified by most scholars with the great ziggurat, or temple tower, of Babylon, Etemenanki, since its excavation at the beginning of the twentieth century by the Deutsche Orient Gesellschaft.29 However, the Hebrew term in Genesis 11 for tower, Vuq, is used 26 Ibn Eza, Commentary, 139. 27 For a description of the high place at Dan, see Avraham Biran's analysis (Biblical Dan [Jerusalem: Israel Exploration Society, 1994], 181; idem, "Sacred Spaces: Of Standing Stones, High Places, and Cult Objects at Tel Dan," BAR 24, no. 5 [September/October 1998]: 38-45, 70). Sarna sug gests the possibility that the Babylonian ziggurat may lie behind the image in Gen 28:12 (Genesis, 198). 28 Sarna has assembled a list of occurrences of this idiom in Mesopotamian building inscrip tions (Genesis, 82-83). See also the instances discussed by Uehlinger (Weltreich, 236-42) and Coote and Ord (Bibles First History, 96-97). 29 Robert Koldewey, Die Tempel von Babylon und Borsippa (WVDOG 15; Leipzig: Hinrichs, 1911); F. Wetzel and F. H. Weissbach, Das Hauptheiligtum des Marduk in Babylon, Esagila undEte menanki (WVDOG 59; Leipzig: Hinrichs, 1938). Early studies following this excavation which took the Babylonian ziggurat as the prototype for the biblical tower include Hugo Gressmann, The Tower</page><page sequence="11">Hiebert: The Tower of Babel 39 consistently in biblical discourse for the towers incorporated into cities' fortifica tions.30 While much energy has been spent on this debate, the tower s precise char acter is not crucial for the argument here, since the narrator's primary interest is not in the tower but in the cultural homogeneity that was the purpose of humanity's building project as a whole. Before we can leave behind the old understanding of the human project as an act of hubris, we must deal briefly with two recent versions of it that shift the sup port for pride to the concepts of making a name and building a city. The former concept, "let us make a name for ourselves" (DW ub'TWyi, v. 4), was of little impor tance to early interpreters who saw the tower as the proof of hubris; but, as schol ars have begun to recognize the simple idiomatic nature of the "tower with its top in the sky," some have turned to the people's making a name for themselves for evi dence of their self-centeredness and pride.31 As we have already seen, the gram of Babel (New York: Jewish Institute of Religion Press, 1928); and Andr? Parrot, Ziggurats et tour de Babel (Paris: Albin Michel, 1949); idem, The Tower of Babel (New York: Philosophical Library, 1955). Among recent scholars, see, e.g., the commentaries of Sarna (Genesis, 82-83) and Westermann (Gen esis 1-11, 547). Speiser has proposed a variation of this view, arguing that Gen 11:4 draws its picture not from the ziggurat of Babylon itself but directly from the description of its construction in Enuma Elish (IV60-62; Genesis: Introduction, Translation, and Notes [AB 1; New York: Doubleday, 1964], 74 76). 30VUQ is often paired with "walls" (e.g., Ezek 26:4; 2 Chr 14:6), and the towers on Jerusalem's walls are frequently mentioned (e.g., Isa 33:18; Ps 48:13; Neh 3:25; 2 Chr 26:9). The VuD was used for launching weapons (2 Chr 26:9,15), for surveillance (2 Kgs 9:17), and for protection (Judg 9:51). Perhaps of most interest for interpreting Gen 11:4, where one tower is mentioned, are the references to single fortified towers in the cities of Penuel (Judg 8:9), Shechem (Judg 9:46), and Thebaz (Judg 9:51). Lawrence Stager, building on the archaeological work and interpretations of G. Ernest Wright, has argued that the Vuo of Shechem was a "fortress-temple," a massive, towering building con structed on the acropolis of Shechem, serving as the "temple of El-/Bacal-berith" (Judg 9:4,46) from ca. 1600 to 1100 B.c.E. ("The Fortress-Temple at Shechem and the 'House of El, Lord of the Covenant,'" in Realia Dei: Essays in Archaeology and Biblical Interpretation in Honor of Edward F. Campbell, Jr. at His Retirement [ed. Prescott Williams and Theodore Hiebert; Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1999], 228-49). If we combine with this evidence the contemporaneous "fortress-temple" discov ered at Megiddo and the references to similar structures at Thebaz and Penuel, we may have the local prototype for the Israelite narrative in Genesis 11. 31 The story's first interpreter, the author of Jubilees, was uninterested in the name. Richard E. Friedman singles out this phrase alone in the entire story for comment, connecting it with the peo ple's rebellion (Commentary on the Torah: With a New English Translation [San Francisco: Harper SanFrancisco, 2001], 46). In spite of their rejection of many elements of the traditional interpretation, both Anderson ("Tower of Babel," 172, 178) and Fretheim ("Genesis," 412) still view the people's wish to "make a name" as problematic, more problematic than their building the tower; they asso ciate this wish for a name with dominion and autonomy. Uehlinger identifies making a name with empire building (Weltreich, 380-86). Particularly problematic for many exegetes is the fact that the people wanted to make a name for themselves, in contrast to Abraham, whose name was made great by God (Gen 12:2). See von Rad, Genesis, 160; Anderson, "Tower of Babel," 178; Brueggemann, Gen esis, 119; Wenham, Genesis 1-15, 240; and Victor P. Hamilton, The Book of Genesis: Chapters 1-17 (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1990), 372.</page><page sequence="12">40 Journal of Biblical Literature 126, no. 1 (2007) matical structure of v. 4 indicates that building a city and making a name are not the goals of the human project but rather the means to the end for which it was designed, the perpetuation of a single culture?the human race, speaking one lan guage, living in one place. A thorough survey of biblical usage, in fact, shows that making a name is never used to describe self-centeredness, vanity, or insubordination. Making a name is always considered a noble venture, essentially the act of establishing an identity that will endure.32 The people's wish to establish a common identity is, therefore, closely related to the larger goal of remaining together to preserve a single culture. A collective name, as sociologists point out, is one of the primary markers of a com mon cultural tradition. Viewed in this light, the phrase "let us make a name for ourselves" expresses no conceit or defiance but rather the impulse toward cultural homogeneity at the heart of the human project. Other scholars have fastened neither on the tower nor on the name as proofs of pride, but on the city itself as the primary symbol of human self-sufficiency, autonomy, and hubris.33 The story itself simply mentions the city and makes no explicit value judgment on it, so such a negative interpretation of city building demands importing a view of urban civilization from outside the narrative. But a survey of the Yah wist s traditions, to which this story belongs, shows no anti-city polemic, and it is doubtful whether the Bible contains any true anti-urban ideology at all.34 Furthermore, as has been noted more than once above, building the city 32 As the case of Abraham in Gen 12:2 shows, making (nU&gt;P) a name (OW) is honorable, and wherever this idiom is used in biblical literature, it is used with approval. It is frequently used for God gaining stature and reputation for himself (Isa 63:12; Jer 32:20; Dan 9:15; Neh 9:10). In variant ver sions of the idiom, when "name" (DU?) is used alone or with a different verb (?W, "establish"; Vu [piel], "make great"; W and "f^n, "go out"), the endeavor is always endorsed. Such is the case when the expression is used for God (Josh 7:9; 2 Sam 7:23 = 1 Chr 17:21), Abraham (Gen 12:2), Abishai (2 Sam 23:18, 22), Uzziah (2 Chr 26:8,15), Israel (Zeph 3:19,20; Ezek 16:14; 34:29; 39:13), or Israel's leaders (Num 16:2; 1 Chr 5:24; 12:31). Making a name is described with respect even when humans make names/or themselves, as in Gen 11:4. Describing David's fame with approval, the historian says once that God made a name for David (2 Sam 7:9) and elsewhere that David made a name for him self (2 Sam 8:13). In the occasional cases when a reputation is negatively valued, it is clearly marked as such, as when Nehemiah speaks of the "bad reputation" (P"l DU&gt;) his enemies wish for him (Neh 6:13). Making a name in the Bible, that is, securing a lasting identity, can be accomplished by bear ing descendants, who preserve one's memory (e.g., Gen 12:2; 2 Sam 18:18; Isa 48:19; 56:5). A name may also be gained through enduring cultural achievements, such as military victories and building projects (2 Sam 23:18; 2 Chr 26:8, 15). All of this is summarized succinctly in a series of reflections on the good things in life by Ben Sira: "Children and the building of a city establish one's name" (40:19). 33 Frank S.

All defenses for reading the human project in w. 1-4 as an expression of hubris ultimately fail, and we are thrown back on the narrative's explicit statements themselves: all of the inhabitants of the earth, speaking a single language, found a city with a tower and construct a common identity in order to remain together in one place. The central interest in the opening part of this story is the homogeneity of human culture?exemplified by a common language and living space?and humanity's interest in preserving it. The narrative presents this picture in a straight forward and neutral way, without taking a stand one way or the other on human ity's project and plans. This neutrality contrasts sharply with the Yahwist's approach in his pre-flood narratives, where the disobedience and sins of the human charac ters are explicitly described (Gen 2:16-17; 3:11-19; 4:6-7; 6:5-8). This narrative neutrality accounts for the continuing puzzlement among inter preters, who, while reading the story as an egregious attack on God, could not help but notice the absence of any explicit mention of such belligerence. "R. Eleazar said ... while the evil deeds of the generation of the flood are explicitly stated, those of the generation of the Division are not" (Gen. Rab. 38). Summing up rabbinic attri bution of pride to the builders of Babel, Jacob Neusner writes: "noting in the nar rative little basis for God's punishment, they have provided what was lacking."35 The great Reformation exegete John Calvin acknowledged the same missing ingre dient: "at first sight the atrocity of the evil does not appear."36 And more recently, Bernhard Anderson concluded that the motive of the builders is "ambiguous. The builders apparently did something wrong, but this is not stated outright, nor is their sin specified."37 II. The Divine Project (Genesis 11:6-9) 5Then Yahweh came down to see the city and the tower which the human race built. 6And Yahweh said, "There is now one people and they all have one lan guage. This is what they have begun to do, and now all that they plan to do will be possible for them. 7Come, let us go down and let us mix there their language, that they will not understand one another's language." 8Then Yahweh dispersed them from there over the surface of all the earth, and they stopped building the 35 Jacob Neusner, Genesis Rabbah: The Judaic Commentary to the Book of Genesis: A New Amer ican Translation (3 vols.; BJS 104-6; Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1985), 50-51. 36 John Calvin, Commentaries on the First Book of Moses Called Genesis (trans.

The second half of the story, w. 6-9, contains God's response to the human project described in the first half of the story. In these verses, God replaces the human race as the primary actor. The story's second part is designed, with a kind of antithetical parallelism, both to replicate and to reverse the first, so that out of the single, uniform culture of part 1 God brings into existence the multiple, diverse cultures of part 2. It will become clear in the narrative's details that God is reacting not to pride, defiance, or imperial power, but to the cultural uniformity of human ity, and that God's response is not an act of punishment or judgment, but an inter vention to introduce cultural difference. Before taking up God's response, we must first look briefly at v. 5, the story's turning point: "Then Yahweh came down to see the city and the tower which the human race built." In this sentence the divine project (w. 6-9)?"Then Yahweh came down to see"?and the human project (w. 1-4)?"the city and the tower which the human race built"?intersect. God's descent from heaven is a character istic of the Yahwist's conventional language of theophany (Gen 18:21; Exod 3:8; 34:5). It reflects, of course, the ancient Near Eastern and biblical conception of a two-tiered universe in which the divine and human inhabit different realms, neces sitating God's descent to make contact with the human realm and to act within it (e.g., Exod 19:11; Num 11:17; Isa 63:19; Mic 1:3; Ps 18:10). The conventional char acter of this language of descent undermines the argument of some advocates of the pride-and-punishment reading that the narrator intends by it a satire on human pretensions: the "tower with its top in the sky" was, in fact, so tiny that God had to descend to see it.38 Moreover, as we shall see, God does not respond to the tower at all but to the cultural homogeneity of its builders. God's Response (Verse 6) The opening verse of the story's second part (v. 6), which contains God's ini tial response to the human project, is a key to the meaning of the story as a whole, and a proper reading of it is critical for shifting the story's interpretation from pride and punishment to cultural difference. Here more than anywhere else in the story, our English translations themselves have been influenced by the traditional inter pretation, so that Gen 11:6 is now a parade example of the old dictum, "every trans lation is an interpretation." Its grammar and content demand special attention. God's response to the human project, in the first sentence of v. 6, focuses on 38 E.g., von Rad, Genesis, 149; Sarna, Genesis, 83; Wenham, Genesis 1-15, 250; Hamilton, Gen esis 1-17, 354; Gowan, When Man Becomes God, 27.</page><page sequence="15">Hiebert: The Tower of Babel 43 its builders' cultural uniformity, not on their pride or imperial pretensions. God does not speak about the tower or its height, about the hubris of its builders, about their challenge to divine authority, or about their imperial power. Rather, what God notices first upon his descent and considers most remarkable is humanity's homo geneity: "And Yahweh said, 'There is now one people and they all have one lan guage" (?b^b nriN nsun mx Dp jn ?TI?T no*n, v. 6a). The opening sentence of part 2 thus mirrors the opening sentence of part 1. God notices the precise facts described by the narrator at the beginning of the story: "All the earth had one lan guage (nriN n?)tt&gt;) and the same words" (v. 1). The new element in God's speech, parallel to the narrator's "All (the people of) the earth" (f"lNn"^D), at the story's beginning, is the phrase "one people" (oy "THIN). With this phrase, God focuses even more directly on the cultural uniformity of the earth's inhabitants. Dp can mean people in a general sense, but it functions primarily as a kinship term, identifying a society tracing itself to a common ances tor. It is employed in the Bible for a distinct community sharing a common ances try and culture, usually for Israel (Exod 1:9; Num 23:9) but also for others, such as Moab (Num 21:29) and Syria (Aram; Amos 1:5).39 By using the phrase iriN DP, "one people," therefore, God characterizes humanity not as a diffuse group of indi viduals but as a kinship society with a common ancestry and a single, shared cul ture. Thus, God emphasizes the people's cultural homogeneity by mentioning both their identity as a kinship group and their shared language (?b^b nriN H?)U&gt;). If we place this story in its larger Yahwistic or biblical narrative?although this is not necessary to make the point above?the society God describes would be all the descendants of the flood hero Noah. God's straightforward statement about humanity's cultural uniformity has been subtly transformed by some translators into a suspicion about human pride. Their tactic is rendering this main clause as a subordinate clause, thus making it dependent on the remainder of v. 6, where they see ominous implications of pride (a point we will take up in a moment). They achieve this by translating God's open ing word, jn, with its less common meaning, "if": "If now, while they are all one people, speaking the same language, they have started to do this, nothing will later stop them from doing whatever they presume to do" (NAB, cf. NJPS, NIV).40 This 39 Norman K. Gottwald, The Tribes of Yahweh: A Sociology of the Religion of Liberated Israel, 1250-1050 B.C.E. (Maryknoll, NY: Orbis Books, 1979), 241-42; Frank Moore Cross, From Epic to Canon: History and Literature in Ancient Israel (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998), 11-13; E. A. Speiser, "'People' and 'Nation' of Israel," JBL 79 (1960): 157-63. 40 Hamilton interprets v. 6 in this way (Genesis 1-17, 349). Wenham proposes a variation, tak ing |n to introduce a subordinate clause: "Since they are all one people and they all have one language, and this is the beginning of their activity, now lest nothing they plot to do be beyond them, come..." (Genesis 1-15, 233-34, 240). Although ?"tf H may introduce subordinate clauses, this has to be deter mined by the precise context, and this case does not fit the subordinate patterns laid out by Lamb din, to whom Wenham refers.</page><page sequence="16">44 Journal of Biblical Literature 126, no. 1 (2007) rendering demotes cultural uniformity from God's primary concern to a subordi nate issue, of interest only as it contributes to the builders' supposed insubordina tion in the following lines. Such a translation, however, reads jn against its common meaning in the Bible and against its consistent sense in Yahwistic texts, jn is normally used as a variant of rtf H, traditionally translated "Behold," but better understood, following Thomas O. Lambdin, as a "predicator of existence" that "emphasizes the immediacy, the here-and-now-ness, of the situation."41 This is, in fact, the only way the Yahwist employs it (e.g., Gen 3:22; 4:14; 19:34; 27:11, 37). Thus I have translated: "There is now one people and they all have one language" (cf. KJV, NRSV, JB). God's opening words are a simple statement about the current state of human life. The rest of God's speech in v. 6 builds on God's concern about humanity's homogeneity expressed in its opening sentence. But it is in this second part of God's response that interpreters have found what they believe to be particular proof of the builders' hubris and God's reaction to it. God's speech continues with the words, HT1 nwpb D^nn, a pronoun followed by two infinitives: "This/their beginning/to do." "This" (HT), scholars agree, refers to the building project described in part 1, which God has just seen: "the city and the tower which the people built" (v. 5). The infini tive D^nn (with a plural suffix), "their beginning," assumes a nominal function in the sentence; it does not indicate tense, and the time to which it refers must be inferred from the context. Since God is commenting here on the building project he has just seen?that is, what the people have just accomplished?this infinitive may be rendered in the present perfect tense, "this is what they have begun to do," as many translators in fact render it (cf. Jub. 10:22, NJPS, NAB, NEB, NIV).42 God is simply acknowledging the builders' work. This simple observation about what the people have done has been embel lished by translators to imply that the people have sinister plans. To accomplish this, translators attribute to the infinitives m^P1? D*?nn the future tense: "This is only the beginning of what they will do" (NRSV; cf. RSV, JB). While the future is not prohibited by the syntax, since infinitives do not have tense, it is not the most obvious inference from the context. It shifts the object of God's observation from a concrete referent in the story, which God has just seen ("the city and the tower which the human race built," v. 5), to a hypothetical event outside the story, for which the narrator has provided no foreshadowing. Moreover, by adding to the actual Hebrew text a word like "only" (NRSV, RSV, NJB) or "but" ("This is but the start" [JB]), the future is emphasized and turned into a threat: God now appears to fear future human challenges. If the first half of the story is not about pride, there is no reason for such a fear nor for such a translation. It is certainly not supported by the story's context or this sentence's syntax. 41 Thomas O. Lambdin, Introduction to Biblical Hebrew (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1971), 168-70. 42 The LXX uses aorist verb forms: xo?xo fip?avco 7toifjaai, "they have begun to do this."</page><page sequence="17">Hiebert: The Tower of Babel 45 The final words in v. 6 complete God?s comments about the human project: TWVyh lor lUW bl DHD -|S_r *6 nnpl, literally, "and now not will be withheld from them all that they plan to do," or, "all that they plan to do will be possible for them." The key question on which the interpretation of this sentence depends is: to what does God refer by "all that they plan to do"? If we look for an answer in the context of the story itself, then a very simple and obvious solution presents itself: "all that they plan to do" refers to the human plans described in the first half of the story, that is, making bricks and building a city and a tower in hopes of not being dispersed across the earth. This meaning connects "all that they plan to do" with God's pre ceding statement, "this is what they have begun to do," so that both statements refer to the human project described in part 1. To paraphrase a bit, God makes the judg ment that, based on what they have accomplished already, their plans will succeed. Those plans, of course, are to avoid dispersion by building a city. We are now in a position to grasp the meaning of God's entire speech in v. 6 and to understand God's response to the human project. The first thing God notices, upon encountering the human project (v. 5), is the cultural homogeneity of the human race: "There is now one people and they all have one language." The next thing God recognizes is that based on what they have been able to achieve? "This is what they have begun to do"?they will be able to carry out their plans to remain together?"and now all that they plan to do will be possible for them." The real sense of God's response, rendered colloquially, could be put like this: "And Yah weh said, 'From what they have accomplished already, it looks like their plans to remain one people with one language in one place will succeed." God recognizes that the human race, left to itself, is intent on preserving one uniform culture, and that recognition spurs God to action in w. 7-8. This is not the sense of God's concluding words found in current translations and interpretations of v. 6, which perpetuate here too the traditional pride-and punishment reading of the story. These words are universally believed to commu nicate God's dread of unrestrained human pride and of humanity's future rebellions against divine authority. Two excellent illustrations of such an understanding are the NRSV, "nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them," and the NAB, "nothing will later stop them from doing whatever they presume to do."43 Such translations, motivated by the traditional interpretive perspective of their authors, strain the limits of both the text and its context. This strain results, first of all, from moving the people's planning into the future. This is grammatically pos sible, since the verbs 1QT\ "they plan," and 1X2\ "be withheld," are imperfect forms, indicating unfinished action. But such a translation faces the same problem as the 43 Contemporary scholars concur: Westermann states, "The meaning of God's reflections in Gen 11:6 thus becomes clear; there is the fear that people could become like God ... it is against human presumption, albeit only feared, that God must intervene" (Genesis i-21, 551); Sarna writes, "Unless preventive measures are taken, there will be no limit to mans arrogant schemes" (Genesis, 84).

Anderson, "Tower of Babel," 170, 178; and Fretheim, "Genesis," 412-13.</page><page sequence="18">46 Journal of Biblical Literature 126, no. 1 (2007) futuristic reading of the previous statement, "This is what they have begun to do." It shifts the object of God's response from the current situation in the story (w. 1 4), which God has just observed (v. 5), to a different, hypothetical event in the future outside the story, for which the narrator has provided no foreshadowing or context. This strain is increased by the expansive treatment of the human plans to which God refers: mu^pb lor 1U&gt;K b?. The NAB, "whatever they presume to do," and the NRSV, "nothing that they propose to do," move considerably beyond the more straightforward "all that they plan to do." The Hebrew term *?:), "all," is a big word, opening the gates for a maximal reading. But in the story's context, as has already been argued, it more obviously refers to the entirety of the planning described in w. 1-4 and observed by God in v. 5, than to some event outside the story's context. Finally, the Hebrew verb 1DV (DDT), "plan," cannot be taken to connote evil schem ing or plotting against God, as some have suggested. Its use in the Bible indicates that it is essentially neutral and may be used positively or negatively.44 God's Actions (Verses 7-8) Upon viewing the human project (v. 5), recognizing the cultural uniformity of the human race (v. 6a), and acknowledging the probable success of the people's plan to preserve it (v. 6b), God intervenes to introduce the world's cultures. To achieve this, God takes two actions: God introduces multiple languages (v. 7) and disperses the people throughout the earth (v. 8). As we will see, the literary structure of these verses is designed so that God's acts both mirror and reverse the people's acts in part 1. Each part of this literary design moves the narrative from the uniform cul ture of the human project to the diverse cultures of the divine project. God's first act to diversify culture, the multiplication of languages, is expressed in volitive form: Dn?3U&gt; ?W n^O?l HTll Hin, "Come, let us go down and let us mix there their language" (v. 7a).45 Numerous literary techniques link God's move toward diversification with the human project in part 1 and present it as a reversal ofthat project.46 The first act attributed to God, multiplying languages, alters the first characteristic attributed to the human race, a single language (v. 1). God's call 44 Speiser maintains that this root denotes scheming (Genesis, 75), though its usage shows that it can be used for good or ill (esp. Zech 8:14-15; cf. Pss 17:3 [for the righteous] and 37:12 [for the wicked]). 45 By using volitive verbal forms, the story describes God's desire to multiply languages but does not describe the act itself, a typical feature of this storyteller's style. In part 1 too the storyteller narrates the human desire to act, but does not narrate the acts themselves (w. 3,4). Later references indicate that all of these calls to act were carried out (w. 5, 9). 46 For a detailed analysis of these literary elements, see the studies cited in n. 10 above (though these studies are, by and large, undertaken under the aegis of the traditional reading of Genesis 11).</page><page sequence="19">Hiebert: The Tower of Babel 47 to the divine council to put an end to homogeneity, "Come, let us . . . mix," mim ics the people's call to one another to preserve it, "Come, let us ... make bricks ... and build ... so that we will not be dispersed" (w. 3,4). The verb expressing God's plans, nbu, "let us mix (their languages)," echoes, with both alliteration and asso nance, the verbs expressing the people's plans: rUl^J, "let us make bricks" (v. 3), and run, "let us build" (v. 4). Finally, God's use of the phrase inp"l . . . UPN, "one another," in v. 7b to describe the differences between languages, IPDU?*' N*? "IU?N injn n_u; urN, "that they will not understand one another's language," reverses the use of the same phrase in part 1 to describe the peoples use of a common language, "they said to one another" (inpn ... UPN, v. 3). Language, of course, is recognized by sociologists and anthropologists as one of the primary markers of a specific culture, cultural tradition, or ethnic group. It is a prominent feature by which a particular culture or ethnicity constructs its iden tity and distinguishes itself from others. This is certainly the belief of our story teller, the Yahwist, who uses language as the primary characteristic of culture in this story, where a common language represents a common culture (w. 1, 6) and multiple languages represent multiple cultures (w. 7, 9). It is also true for the Priestly writer, who, in the alternative traditions of the dispersion of humanity in Genesis 10, regards language?together with land, kinship, and nationality?as determinative of cultural distinctions (w. 5, 20, 31). In fact, throughout the Bible the terms for language, n_U? and its synonym ]wb, are invariably used as key mark ers of cultural difference (e.g., Deut 28:49; Isa 66:18; Zech 8:23; Ps 81:6). The verb employed to describe God's multiplication or division of languages is V?!, literally "mix." It is a little-used verb, employed elsewhere in the Bible only for mixing the ingredients fine flour and oil to make offertory cakes or bread (e.g., Exod 29:40; Lev 14:10; Num 6:15).47 On the basis of these biblical data, we should translate on_?W r6lJ, "let us mix their language," signifying that God makes a poly glot world, a mixture of languages, so that the language of humanity (DHfDW) is no longer a single language but a mixture of many. The verb V?:i strikes me as a some what unusual choice to depict God's multiplication, division, or differentiation of languages. The Priestly writer, for example, uses Tl?), "divide" (Gen 10:5, 32). Yet y?H was undoubtedly selected by the Yahwist to provide an etiology for *?M, Babel, the name of the city it is intended to explain (v. 9). The term V?! does not, of course, provide a proper linguistic etymology for btt?ba cannot be derived from the root V?!?but this is typical of the Yahwist, whose etymologies rely only on a rough similarity of sounds (e.g., Gen 3:20; 4:1; 5:29). Furthermore, as noted above, the first common plural form of V?l, r6lJ, appears to be an intentional play on the first common plural forms T\2lbl and n:i_J in part 1 (w. 3, 4). 47 In three instances, Isa 64:5, Hos 7:8, and Ps 92:11, it is unclear whether V?! or another root is being employed; these are difficult texts and certainly not a reliable basis for determining the meaning of V?3. The comparative evidence from Phoenician (bbll) and Akkadian (bal?lu) indicates the same usage as biblical V?2.</page><page sequence="20">48 Journal of Biblical Literature 126, no. 1 (2007) In the history of interpretation, this straightforward account of God's inter vention to introduce the world's many languages has been represented as a divine punishment?though punishment is never mentioned in the story?by reading punitive overtones into the verb V?2 and into the phrase "they will not understand one another's language" (v. 7b). Since the Septuagint chose the verb cnr/xeco ("pour together, confound, confuse, destroy, frustrate") to render V?2, lexicographers ("confuse, confound" [BDB]; "verwirren" [KBL]) and translators ("confuse" [NRSV, NIV, NAB, JB]; "confound" [KJV, NJPS]) have elected to give V?n in Genesis 11, and only in Genesis 11, a negative spin, thereby representing God's division of lan guages as a divine judgment that inflicts confusion, trouble, and conflict on the human race. Recent translators, trying to capture the play on V?2 (mix) and *?22 (Babel) in the story, have offered more creative, though still negative, translations: "babble their language" or "baffle their language."48 Exegetes themselves have, by and large, adopted the terms "confuse" and "confound" in order to imply divine punishment in God's action.49 With no linguistic evidence to support these mean ings, such translations of V?2 in Genesis 11 can only be seen as theological, as the consequence of understanding the people's project as an act of pride and defiance that demanded retribution from God. The same punitive overtone attributed to the verb V?2 has also been attributed to the final phrase of v. 7, which states that, upon the introduction of different lan guages, people will not be able to understand one another. According to one approach, this inability to communicate is regarded as the source of confusion, conflict, and discord in the human race, and such conflict and discord are consid ered a divine judgment on humanity.50 According to another approach, the people's 48 Friedman, Commentary on the Torah, 46; Everett Fox, The Five Books of Moses: Genesis, Exo dus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy; A New Translation with Introductions, Commentary, and Notes (Schocken Bible 1; New York: Schocken, 1983), 49. Compare David Rosenberg's "baffle" (Harold Bloom, The Book ofj [New York: Grove Weidenfeld, 1990], 73) and Fokkelmans "muddle" (Narra tive Art, 12). It is worth investigating further whether the word "babble," appearing in the twelfth or thirteenth century, is not in fact from the negative understanding of Babel in Genesis 11 rather than an onomatopoeic formation, as suggested in the Oxford English Dictionary. 49 Fretheim, who is otherwise critical of the traditional pride- and-punishment approach, sees w. 5-9 as a "judicial inquiry" and describes the "confusion" of languages as the "sentence" on human ity imposed by the divine council (v. 7) and carried out by God as "punishment" (v. 9) ("Genesis," 412-13). 50 According to one strain of rabbinic thought, a single universal language was one of God's twenty-four precious gifts to humanity at creation, and the division of languages led to misunder standing, violence, and warfare (Kasher, Encyclopedia, 90, 91, 96). Martin Luther called the division of languages "the seedbed of all evils" because it caused political and economic confusion (Lectures on Genesis: Chapters 6-14, vol. 2 of Luther's Works [ed. Jaroslav Pelikan and Daniel E. Poellot; trans. George V Schick; St. Louis: Concordia, 1960], 215). Modern proponents of the view that linguistic diversity led to confusion and should be regarded as divine punishment include S. R. Driver, The Book of Genesis (London: Methuen, 1920), 132; Sarna, Genesis, 80; Brueggemann, Genesis, 103; and Wenham, Genesis 1-15, 245.</page><page sequence="21">Hiebert: The Tower of Babel 49 inability to understand each other is seen as God's plan to restrain humanity's sins. God interrupted the people's communication in order to stop their work and under mine their unified effort to attack God, thereby preventing this challenge and any future challenges to divine authority.51 The phrase "they will not understand one another's language" has no such negative connotations in biblical usage. It is, in fact, the conventional way to describe a language different from the speaker's, that is, "a language you do not understand" (Deut 28:48; cf. Isa 33:19; Jer 5:15; Ps 81:6). Thus, v. 7b simply spells out the result of v. 7a: upon God's mixing of the people's language, many distinct languages resulted. Such a conventional expression for lin guistic difference can be turned into a punitive measure only if the people's pride is assumed and its punishment, or restraint, is required. Read in light of its cus tomary biblical usage, this phrase is a simple description of a multilingual world. God's second action to diversify culture is to disperse the human population: "Then Yahweh dispersed them from there over the surface of all the earth" (v. 8a). Just as the narrator describes God's creation of many languages as the reversal of the people's one language, so here the narrator describes God's dispersal of the people to many places as the reversal of their desire to stay in one place (v. 4). To highlight this reversal, God's speech employs the same language as the peoples speech: both use the verb t&gt;??), "be dispersed," together with the prepositional phrase "?J?^p tHNrr^D, "over the surface of all the earth" (w. 4, 8). The reversal from one place to many places is further emphasized when God's action to disperse the people in v. 8 is repeated verbatim in the final phrase in the story's concluding etiology, so that the final words of the story's second half, describing God's dispersal (v. 9b), repeat the final words of the story's first half, describing the people's desire not to be dis persed (v. 4b). Here in v. 8, as in v. 7, the interpretive spin on the terminology and the con clusion of the verse have both been employed to imply that dispersion is a punitive measure. The verb flu is regularly rendered in Genesis 11 with "scatter" (NRSV, NJPS; see BDB), the English translation with the strongest negative connotations, rather than with the equally viable "dispersed," or "spread abroad." Translations and dictionaries invariably use "scatter" for calamitous contexts involving enemies or exiles, while "dispersed" and "spread abroad" are reserved for more benign con texts.52 The final clause of this verse, "and they stopped building the city," as has been noted, does not even mention the tower, the crucial image for the traditional pride-and-punishment interpretation, yet scholars continue to regard this halt in construction as a judgment on the hubris of city building or the punishment of expulsion and exile.53 In fact this reference to the end of construction simply affirms 51 E.g., Cassuto, Genesis, part 2,247; Westermann, Genesis 1-11, 552; Hamilton, Genesis 1-17, 355. 52 BDB, for example, suggest "scatter" for Genesis 11 but "spread abroad" for the traditions of human dispersion in Gen 10:18. 53 See n. 34 and Wenham, Genesis 1-15,241.</page><page sequence="22">50 Journal of Biblical Literature 126, no. 1 (2007) that God has effectively countered the human project: the building of the city by which the people hoped to remain in one place has, in the wake of their dispersion to many places, ceased. Geographical residence?a people's land or territory?is closely associated, as is language, with the identity of a specific culture or ethnic group, and it is a promi nent means of distinction between cultures. The Yahwist thus employs two key cul tural markers, language and geography, to describe cultural uniformity, on the one hand (w. 1-4), and cultural diversity, on the other (w 8, 9). Taken together, God's two actions, distinguishing languages and dispersing humanity, explain the origin of the world's cultures and provide an etiology of cultural difference. Both charac teristics of culture also feature prominently in the alternative Priestly traditions of the origins of the world's cultures (10:5, 20, 31). The close relationship between separate locations and separate languages is an important concept today in historical linguistics, in which the development of new languages is directly linked to a space-time continuum. Over time, commu nities living in different geographical regions develop different languages.54 The Yahwist is not a modern linguist, as his etiology of Babel in v. 9 clearly shows, but his story does reflect an ancient observation about the relationship between dif ferent cultures, the different regions they inhabit, and the different languages they speak. The scholarly claim that language change and dispersion are separate issues deriving from separate recensions of Gen 11:1-9 fails to recognize the close con nection in the design of the story and in the conception of the Yahwist between language and geography as components of culture.55 The Concluding Etiology (Verse 9) The story's aim to explain the origin of the world's cultures is summarized in its final sentence, where God's acts to introduce cultural diversity are repeated: "there Yahweh mixed the language of all the earth, and from there Yahweh dis persed them over the surface of all the earth." "There" in this sentence refers, of course, to the city which the people built and which here in the story's conclusion God names Babel. While traditionally understood to represent an evil empire, the role Babel actually plays in this story is to represent the place where cultural diver sity originated, that is, the cradle of civilization. 54 Anthony Arlotto, Introduction to Historical Linguistics (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1972), 6-10,22-25,235. 55 Scholars who separate these motifs into distinct recensions include Gunkel, Genesis, 94-99; Westermann, Genesis 1-11, 552-53; and Uehlinger, Weltreich, 514-45, 572-84. The occasional con cern about the order in which the narrative describes language change and human dispersion tak ing place, and whether it got the order right, goes beyond the narrator s basic recognition of their relationship (e.g., Westermann, Genesis 1-11, 553; Hamilton, Genesis 1-17, 357-58).</page><page sequence="23">Hiebert: The Tower of Babel 51 Babels role is explicit in the etiology that the story provides for its name: "Therefore, he named it Babel 0?22, b?bel), for there Yahweh mixed (V72, b?lal) the language of all the earth." Whatever the actual derivation of the name Babel, the Yahwist believes it to be derived from the verb by which God first differentiated languages, and thus cultures, from one another.56 This sense of the name Babel is emphasized by the term "therefore" (p'^y), which links the naming of Babel to God's two actions to diversify culture, which precede it (w. 7-8), and by the term "for" ("O), which links the naming to the repetition of these acts, which follows it (v. 9). Babel's role as the point of origin of the world's cultures is emphasized in the narrative also by the repetition of the adverb DU&gt;, "there," each time God's diversi fication of culture is mentioned: "Come, let us go down and mix there their lan guage" (v. 7); "Then Yahweh dispersed them from there over the surface of all the earth" (v. 8); "Therefore, he named it Babel, for there Yahweh mixed the language of all the earth" (v. 9); "from there Yahweh dispersed them over the surface of all the earth" (v. 9). The adverb is first used, in fact, in v. 2 to identify the site, later named Babel, where the human race settled: "they found a valley in the land of Shinar, and they settled there?57 The conception of Babel and its environs, "the valley in the land of Shinar" (v. 2)?ancient Babylon and Mesopotamia?as the cradle of civilization in Genesis 11 is not unique in the Bible. It assumes a foundational place in the traditions of Israel's ancestors, which locate Israel's own origins in Mesopotamia. Both the Yah wist (Gen 11:28-30; 15:7) and the Priestly writer (Gen 11:31) claim that Abraham's family, the family of Terah, originated in Ur in southern Mesopotamia, referred to by the Yahwist as "their native land" (mVin pN&gt; Gen 11:28; 24:7), and then migrated westward to Canaan. This tradition is preserved also by the Deuterono mistic Historian, who places the origin of Terah and his family in Mesopotamia, beyond the Euphrates ("irtf ?1 "?jn, "in the region beyond the river," Josh 24:2-3).58 The name "Hebrew," ''"I2P, may, in fact, have been understood in tradition as "one 56 The actual derivation of Babel is likely no longer recoverable, though it was interpreted com monly in Babylon according to the Akkadian b?b-ilim, "Gate of God."

Gelb, "The Name of Babylon," Journal of the Institute of Asian Studies 1 (1955): 1-4; Burkhart Kienast, "The Name of the City of Babylon," Sumer 35 (1979): 246-48. 57 The adverb is not intended as a negative, satirical play on the word DW, "name" (v. 9), as is often claimed, so that the name (D^) represents the place (??W) of confusion (e.g., Fokkelman, Nar rative Art, 16-17; van Wolde, Words Become Worlds, 99-100). To the extent that it does play on "name," it simply reinforces the name as the place of the origins of the world's cultures. 58 P.

Genesis 10:8-12 concerns Nimrod, a "mighty hunter before Yahweh" (v. 9), whose kingdom began at Babel, Erech, and Akkad in the land of Shinar (v. 10). These traditions, like those in ch. 11, contain no censure of Babel. Nimrod is por trayed as a Yahwistic hero, "a mighty hunter before Yahweh" (niiT ^sb T? Tim).60 And Babel is presented as the first great city at the origins of human culture in Mesopotamia. As early as Josephus (Ant. 1.113-14), however, interpreters have read these traditions as a condemnation of Nimrod and his imperial exploits, and they have imported him into Genesis 11, making him the tyrant who led the Babyloni ans in the construction of their tower and their empire.61 Neither the negative read ing of Gen 10:8-12 nor its use to interpret 11:1-9 is warranted. Such an image of Babel in Gen 11:1-9 does not necessarily suggest that the story originated in Babylon, as many scholars believe it did.62 There is, in fact, no comparable story in Mesopotamian literature. Samuel Kramer's proposed parallel contains a reference to languages in a difficult and disputed context, and, more over, Kramers treatment of it has been heavily influenced by his own acceptance of the traditional pride-and-punishment reading of the biblical narrative.63 The story of Babel is so deeply indigenous in cultural detail, geographical context, literary shape, and religious perspective that it can be described only as a thoroughly Israelite narrative.64 59 McCarter states: "Whatever the ultimate origin of the term 'Hebrews,' this was the meaning it came to have in the tradition: The cIbrim, 'Hebrews,' were those who came from c?ber, 'beyond,' the Euphrates" ("Patriarchal Age," 18). See also BDB, 720. 60 Karel van der Toorn and P. W. van der Horst, "Nimrod Before and After the Bible," HTR 83 (1990): 1-16. Skill in hunting is a stereotypical trait of kings (Coote and Ord, Bibles First History, 92 93). 61 Nimrod is still mentioned occasionally in this role (e.g., Wenham, Genesis 1-15, 222). 62 Gunkel, Genesis, 101; Gressmann, Tower of Babel, 4; Sigmund Mowinckel, "The Babylonian Matter in the Predeuteronomic Primeval History (JE) in Gen 1-11," JBL 58 (1939): 87-91; W.

Babylon becomes Israel's enemy, and, after its destruction of Jerusalem in 586, Israel's archenemy, its enduring symbol of ruthless imperial power (Isaiah 13; 14; Jeremiah 51; Psalm 137). Read from this perspective, as scholars customarily have, Genesis 11 is regarded as a satire on Babylon and its culture: on its religion, its zig gurat, its imperial schemes, or its prideful pretensions.65 This Neo-Babylonian lens is particularly important for the newer, postcolonial reading of Genesis 11 as a cri tique of empire.66 But as we have seen in the analysis above, Gen 11:1-9 does not present Babel as the symbol of empire or critique it as such. Rather, by means of eti ology and literary structure, the story describes Babel as the cradle of civilization, the point of origin of the world's different cultures. III. Genesis 11:1-9 in Its Biblical Context If we regard Gen 11:1-9 no longer as a narrative of pride and punishment but as an account of the origin of the world's cultures, then we can no longer read the story of Babel as the climax of human sin and divine judgment in the primeval age, as it has been read since rabbinic and patristic exegesis.67 It plays an entirely dif ferent role in its biblical context. In that role, it is a foundational part of the theme of cultural differentiation that is prominent in the post-flood age. From the flood forward, the narratives of Genesis provide etiologies for the world's increasing cul tural particularity.68 In fact, at a very basic level, the book of Genesis provides a 65 E.g., Cassuto, Genesis, part 2,248; von Rad, Genesis, 151; Sarna, Genesis, 84; John Van Seters, Prologue to History: The Yahwist as Historian in Genesis (Louisville: Westminster John Knox, 1992), 182-85; and Joseph Blenkinsopp, The Pentateuch: An Introduction to the First Five Books of the Bible (ABRL; New York: Doubleday, 1992), 91. 66 Uehlinger, however, argues that an anti-Babylonian polemic belongs to the story's second stage, its earliest form originating as an anti-Assyrian narrative (Weltreich, 514-58). 67 In one strain of rabbinic thought, the generation of division, because of its direct challenge to God's authority, is judged to be more wicked than the generation of the flood (Gen. Rab. 38:6); Kasher, Encyclopedia, 90. For patristic exegesis, see Augustine, City of God 16.11-12. See also Gunkel, Genesis, 1; von Rad, Genesis, 151, 153; Sarna, Genesis, 81; Westermann, Genesis 1-11, 18-19; Wenham, Genesis 1-15, li; Van Seters, Prologue to History, 188-93; Jack M.

This is best illustrated by examining both Yahwistic and Priestly traditions. In Yahwistic material, of which the story of Babel is a part, the theme of cul tural differentiation begins immediately with the disembarkation from the ark of Noah and his family: "The sons of Noah who left the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth, Ham being the father of Canaan. These three were Noah's sons and from these all people of the earth were dispersed" (9:18-19).69 The story of Babel, which follows this brief notice, explains how this dispersion comes about. These two J texts are linked closely by vocabulary. The verb n^?3J (y?ti)y "were dispersed," in 9:19 is closely related to the verb fia, which J employs for the dispersion of human ity in the Babel narrative (w. 4, 8, 9).70 Moreover, the final clause of 9:19, "b'D TMSl tHNH, "all (the people of) the earth were dispersed," ends with the phrase lHNrr^3, "all (the people of) the earth," which is the same phrase with which the story of Babel begins, nriN nau; f^Nri'^D, "all (the people of) the earth had one language" (11:1). From this point on in Genesis, the Yahwist's narratives give prominence to the theme of the dispersion of humanity and its cultural differentiation, for which Gen 11:1-9 provides the foundational episode. The fragmentary genealogical materials from J (10:8-19, 21, 24-30; 11:28-30), which are embedded in the Priestly geneal ogy that now frames the story of Bab el (10:1-32; 11:10-32), contain select details of cultural diversification between Babel and the origins of Abraham's family in Mesopotamia (ll:28-30).71 The narratives of Israel's ancestors that follow docu ment the origins of new cultures in Israel's world with increasing specificity, focus ing on Israel's closest neighbors. The Ishmaelites originate in Abraham's generation (16:1-14); the Moabites and Ammonites in the generation of his nephew Lot (19:30-38); and the Edomites in Isaac's generation (25:21-34; 33:15-18). Finally, in the generation of Jacob (Israel), which concludes Genesis, the people of Israel itself is differentiated into subcultures represented by its constituent tribes, summarized in the archaic traditions appropriated by the Yahwist (49:1-28). For the Priestly writer, as for the Yahwist, the dispersion and differentiation of the world's peoples, languages, and cultures represent a dominant motif in the post flood period. God's covenant with Noah following the flood introduces this theme immediately (9:1-17). Dispersion is God's first post-flood command: 1*001 imi 11?3, 69 Anderson, "Tower of Babel," 175; Van Seters, Prologue to History, 180. 70 The verb f?J is often taken as a secondary root from the niphal of y\? (BDB, 659). The verb f!?D, "be dispersed," is used also in v. 18 in the genealogical material (10:8-19) customarily attributed to the Yahwist and now embedded in a Priestly composition. The alternative Priestly verb for dis persion is consistently *"H_, "divide" (Gen 10:5, 32). 71 The Yahwist's genealogical data in Genesis 10 have been displaced chronologically by P's editorial positioning of his genealogical record of dispersion (with its J sections) before J's account of dispersion in the story of Babel in ch. 11. The same editorial practice can be seen in P's position ing his creation traditions (Gen l:l-2:4a) before J's (Gen 2:4b-3:24).</page><page sequence="27">Hiebert: The Tower of Babel 55 parrriN, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the earth" (9:1, 7), which is repeated twice in God's opening speech. For the Priestly writer, this was God's intent from the beginning at the creation of the world (1:28). After the flood, God's first strat egy to reconstitute the world is to disperse humanity throughout it. The Priestly genealogy that follows the covenant with Noah, commonly referred to as the "Table of Nations," records the manner by which humanity mul tiplies and fills the earth. This is the Priestly "parallel" to the Yahwist s Babel nar rative. P's genealogy is divided into three sections, one for each of Noah's sons: Japheth (10:2-5), Ham (10:6-20), and Shem (10:21-31).72 Each concludes with a summary statement describing the dispersion of peoples and the differentiation of their languages and cultures, such as the one following Japheth's descendants: "These are the descendants of Japheth in their lands, each with its own language, by their clans, in their nations" (v. 5, cf. w. 20, 31). Just as in the Yahwist's story of Babel, cultural distinctiveness is characterized by P according to geographical dis persion ("in their lands") and linguistic diversification ("each with its own lan guage"). The entire genealogy concludes with a general summary that repeats this theme: "These are the clans of Noah's sons according to their genealogies, in their nations. From these the nations in the earth spread out after the flood" (10:32). Genealogy is the means by which the Priestly writer frames and organizes the nar rative traditions in Genesis, and in the genealogies that follow the Table of Nations in Genesis 10, P records with increasing particularity the cultures of Israel's world (e.g., 11:10-27, 31-32; 25:12-20; 36:1-30; 37:2; cf. Exod 1:1-7). Thus, both great traditions of the world's beginnings after the flood place great stress on the origins of cultural difference. They do, however, present these origins from different perspectives. The Priestly writer, by introducing the world's first new cultures in Genesis 10 with his typical tabular, genealogical form, records the spread of culture as a simple catalogue of facts, or, as Gunkel put it, "as a natural conse quence of reproduction and growth."73 The Yahwist, by contrast, presents these events in narrative form: with setting, character, and plot, and with a plot involv ing a conflict between opposing forces. The Yahwist's account of the origins of dif ference thus includes an element of tension that is lacking in Priestly traditions: the people's desire to stay together and preserve a single culture is juxtaposed to God's intention to disperse them and diversify their cultures. The story's drama springs from the tension, as Anderson put it, between the centripetal force of homo geneity and the centrifugal force of heterogeneity.74 What does the story of Babel mean to say about cultural difference by placing its origins within this tension between the people's wish to stay together and God's 72 As noted above, the Priestly genealogical traditions about Ham and Shem contain fragments of Yahwistic genealogical data. 73 Gunkel, Genesis, 99. 74 Anderson, "Tower of Babel," 166-68.</page><page sequence="28">56 Journal of Biblical Literature 126, no. 1 (2007) interest in dividing them? Some answers are clear from the data analyzed above. In the first place, the story presents the people's desire to preserve their common cul ture without censure. The storyteller does not claim that the people sinned, in direct contrast to the preceding stories of the Garden of Eden, Cain and Abel, and the flood. Nor, as has been shown in this analysis, are pride, defiance, or rebellion against God implied by anything the people did or by God's own assessment of the human project in v. 6. We may not take the people's wish to stay together in the Yahwist's story as a transgression of God's command to "fill the earth" in the Priestly tradition (Gen 1:28; 9:1, 7) as many interpreters have done.75 The story of Babel makes no reference to this command, even when God appears to diversify human ity and populate the earth. This reflects the fact that the Yahwist's traditions arose separately from Priestly ones, with which they now stand in some tension, and Priestly perspectives may not be employed to understand the origins or values of Yahwistic traditions.76 Ibn Ezra recognized the story's lack of censure: "The builders of the tower hoped that their city and tower would prevent them from dispersing, but this was not God's will. However, they did not know this."77 It is also clear from the data that the story describes God's response to coun teract the human desire for homogeneity by introducing heterogeneity without any negative connotations or consequences. God's initial assessment of human efforts recognizes simply their initial success at preserving a common culture (v. 6). God's subsequent introduction of cultural difference, through linguistic and geographi cal diversity, is presented as God's intention for the world and narrated in a straight forward fashion. As this analysis has shown, there is no support in the story for viewing God's actions as a punishment, judgment, or curse upon the human race, nor as a catastrophe which doomed humanity to confusion and chaos. The world's cultural diversity is represented as the consequence of God's design for the world, not the result of God punishment of it. Ibn Ezra, though going a bit beyond the explicit words of the story itself, understood this aspect of the story more clearly than his peers: "God scattered the people for their own benefit."78 What we can say, then, without transgressing the limitations of the data in the story itself, is that it describes the origins of the world's cultures through a narra 75 Among ancient interpreters, see Josephus (Ant. 1.4.1 ?109), Kimhi, and Malbim (Kasher, Encyclopedia, 94). Among modern interpreters, see Sarna, Genesis, 83; van Wolde, Words Become Worlds, 101-4; Hamilton, Genesis 1-17, 353; Fretheim, "Genesis," 412. 76 We would expect interpreters before the critical era, who read the Bible as a single, seamless narrative, to have read Gen 11:1-9 in light of earlier divine commands. 77 Ibn Ezra, Commentary, 140. Ibn Ezra believed, in fact, that Israel's righteous ancestors? Noah, Shem, and Abraham?were all present and assisted in building the tower of Babel (p. 138). This viewpoint contrasted with the primary rabbinic tradition, which developed the tale that Abraham refused to join the project and was thrown into a fiery furnace by Nimrod (van der Toorn and van der Horst, "Nimod," 19-29). 78 Ibn Ezra, Commentary, 143.</page><page sequence="29">Hiebert: The Tower of Babel 57 tive world in which people desire uniformity and God desires diversity. Since this short, spare narrative does not tell us why this was so?it offers motives neither for the people's drive toward cultural uniformity nor for God's introduction of cultural diversity?expanding on this brief summary takes us beyond the actual bounds of the story itself. But, in conclusion, I offer a few such personal expansions in order to explain why the story is set up in this way and what it intends to say through this tension between human and divine intentions. The story appears to be wrestling with the profound tension at the heart of human experience between identity and difference, between the power of cultural solidarity, on the one hand, and the reality of cultural diversity, on the other. In the story's first half, the narrator acknowledges and describes the reality of cultural sol idarity arising from the deep human need for identity, for belonging to a society whose members share the same language, name, and living space. In the story's second half, the narrator acknowledges and explains the reality of cultural differ ence, the fact that, in spite of the human desire and need for identity and cultural solidarity, the world is actually characterized by extraordinary cultural diversity. In articulating this tension, the storyteller represents the drive toward identity and solidarity as the distinctively human impulse and the emergence of difference as the peculiarly divine ambition. Attributing difference, that is, the extravagant array of the world's cultures, to God's intentions may simply represent a belief on the part of the storyteller that God as creator brought everything in the world he knew into existence, including its profusion of cultures. But it may also represent an understanding of the depth of the human need for identity and cultural solidarity, so that, left to themselves, humans?in this case, the family and their descendants who survived the flood? would dedicate their efforts to preserving a common culture. How in a world in which membership in a kinship group with a common culture defined human life in all respects, and outside of which an individual had no standing, could difference ever emerge? In such a world, cultural difference may have been considered possi ble only as part of a larger divine design, a design implemented by God's own ini tiative. It is striking that a story that embraces, as it were, both cultural solidarity and cultural difference in this open way, acknowledging their reality?and, in my opin ion, their value?would be read by interpreters from the beginning as such a neg ative tale, in which cultural solidarity is linked to pride and cultural diversity to punishment. This, in a sense, is the primary quandary about this story and its inter pretation. One simple explanation for such a shift may be found in the story's canonical context. After reading three classic tales of crime and punishment?the Garden of Eden, Cain and Abel, and the great flood?interpreters may have been inclined to see in the story of Babel the same pattern, even though this story lacked any such language. Furthermore, combined in the canon with Priestly traditions containing the divine command to "fill the earth" (1:28; 9:1, 7), the human desire</page><page sequence="30">58 Journal of Biblical Literature 126, no. 1 (2007) to stay together in this Yahwistic narrative could be regarded as a clear act of dis obedience, even though the story lacked such a claim.79 An answer may also lie in the insights of the story itself into the propensity of humans for identity and cultural solidarity. Perhaps the story's interpreters have outdone the story's own characters in the quest for ethnic uniformity. Perhaps our interpreters have recognized not only the value of identity and belonging, as does the story itself, but have taken the next step and devalued difference, seeing it as an obstacle, a source of confusion and chaos, a catastrophe and a curse upon the human race, and, ultimately, a judgment of God. This is a step the story does not take. By contrast, it takes a step in the opposite direction, valuing difference by explaining it as God's aspiration for the new world after the flood. 79 See nn. 75 and 76.</page></plain_text>
