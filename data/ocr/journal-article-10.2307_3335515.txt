<plain_text><page sequence="1">African Art at the Brooklyn Museum SYLVIA H. WILLIAMS The Brooklyn Museum's Department of African, Oceanic, and New World Cultures was created in 1903 by the Board of Governors, and its first curator, Stewart Culin, was appointed the same year. The selec- tion of Culin, as history has shown, was a brilliant choice. As a man and as a scholar he is not easily characterized. His friend George A. Dorsey, with whom Culin shared a deep interest in North American Indian culture, probably described him best when he wrote: "He is not to be measured by ordinary measures. Nor can I think of him as having been born, or of having had the measles, or childhood. To his friends he is always Culin, always a sage, always a philosopher, and always perpetual youth. And he is a first-rate scientist, a keen critic and a just judge of nature, men, pictures, books, bronzes, fans and lace - in short, having great merit in himself, his eye is quick to detect merit, his mind equally quick to appraise sham at its true worthless- ness" (Dorsey 1913: 37). If one discusses either the Brooklyn Museum's North American Indian or African permanent collections, one is primarily concerned with Stewart Culin the ethnologist. To this day, his acquisi- tions form a valuable and substantial core of the collec- tions. Culin's first concern as curator was to acquire North American Indian art and artifacts. He believed that what he assembled would soon be the only vestiges of a rich Native American tradition. To accomplish his aim, he conducted annual museum expeditions across the con- tinental U.S. from 1903 until 1909. A prodigious ethnographer, Culin evidenced the same persistence and perceptivity toward the formation of an African collection as he had toward that of the North American Indian. Determined to continue the department policy of relying upon its expeditions for exhibition material, he set out for Europe in 1922 search- ing for African objects in London, Paris, and Brussels (he never visited the continent of Africa). During the months abroad he met Captain Thomas A. Joyce at the British Museum; Baron d'Hauleville, the director, and 1. TOBACCO MORTAR. CHOKWE, ANGOLA. WOOD, 22.8cm. GIFT OF MR. &amp; MRS. JOHN A.

Maes, the curator, at the Musee Royal de l'Afrique Centrale; and Louis C. C. Clarke, the curator at the University Museum of Cambridge. They generously shared their knowledge and guided him in his search for works of art. Other familiar names, such as Paul Guil- laume and W. O. Oldman, were included in Culin's itinerary, as was Mrs. Webster's Antique Shop, London. His trip was devoted as much to study as it was to acquisition. He seemed to have been especially in- terested in the collections of the Musee Royal de l'Af- rique Centrale and consequently spent considerable time in Tervuren and Brussels. It was in the latter city in the fall of 1922 that he purchased a private collection of approximately 1,500 objects that had been assembled in the Congo region by a former Belgian colonial military officer. With the help of an interpreter, Culin quickly completed arrangements for shipment of the collection to Brooklyn. Upon his return to the U.S., Culin expeditiously handled the complexities of cataloguing the sizeable collection. He then organized the Brooklyn Museum's first exhibition of African art from the permanent collec- tion in 1923. The accompanying exhibition catalogue, Primitive Negro Art, lists 1,454 objects. In the catalogue introduction, Culin eloquently expressed his aesthetic philosophy: "The entire collection, whatever may have been its original uses, is shown under the classification of art; as representing a creative impulse, and not for the purpose of illustrating the customs of the African people. .... Of all the exotic arts, indeed, from which our world is seeking stimulation, the writer regards it as the most vital." Culin's installation divisions, numbering a staggering fifteen, are indicative of the size and variety of the material he had brought together: fetishes of wood, ivory, stone, and metal; masks; divinatory apparatus; ceremonial staves and scepters; furniture and utensils; tools; mats; basketry; textiles; metalwork; costume and personal ornament; pottery; musical instruments; games; tobacco pipes. Although the objects came from various sub-Saharan ethnic groups, there is no question that the majority of them represented three culture regions: the Eastern Congo Basin, the Lower Congo and Kwango Basins, and the Central Grasslands. This em- phasis is reflected in the collection today. There are several less often published objects from this formative period of the collection, for example, the Chokwe snuff container that Culin handcarried from Europe to Brooklyn as evidence of the quality of the collection he had acquired (Fig. 3). A small handwritten label in French attached to the piece attributed it to the Chokwe and noted that it was "received the 23 January 1906."1 Culin remarked that the container had been repaired in Africa at the base, not with copper wire as he had expected, but with fiber. He showed the container to the museum staff at Tervuren and inquired about the figure's left arm, which appeared to have been muti- lated. One explanation offered was that the carver had copied a condition that existed, probably from birth. This auspicious beginning of the Chokwe collection was further enhanced by several important gifts of figures and a tobacco mortar (Fig. 1) received in the 1970s. The majority of staffs and bow rests that entered the collection in 1922 are Luba carvings. A notable exception is the Mbangala staff with its intricate profusion of animal, reptilian, and human forms on the shaft, sur- mounted by a kneeling female figure with child straddl- ing the woman's right shoulder (Fig. 6). Historically, the Mbangala had contact with both the Songo and the Chokwe. There are echoes of both of the latter carving styles in this elaborately decorated piece. 3. SNUFF CONTAINER.

GIFT OF THE FLORENCE AND CARL SELDEN FOUNDATION Brooklyn's Eastern Congo Basin region holdings were strengthened by a number of important gifts and pur- chases received during the mid-1950s and throughout the 1960s. (After Culin's death in 1929 and until 1950, the department was primarily concerned with the devel- opment of its Mesoamerican and Peruvian collections.) There was a sudden resurgence of interest in the African collection in the 1970s. The Bena Lulua half-figure (Fig. 18) and Luba figure (Fig. 4) are two of the most impor- tant of this recent period. The Bena Lulua demonstrates exceptionally well the skill of an individual carver within a stylistic canon. Its relative naturalism, elongation, elaborate cicatrization, and glistening surface contribute to the sense of composure and dignified bearing man- ifested in this image. The substance concealed behind the brass cone on the forehead is a delicate reminder of the magical forces governing Lulua fertility rites and the belief in the reincarnation of still-born infants. The Luba figure, first published in Olbrechts's vol- ume, Les arts plastiques du Congo Belge (1959, pl. XXX), was one of several transitional pieces recognized by Olbrechts as stylistically related to a corpus that he identified as Buli, a name taken from an administrative center located between Kongolo-Kabalo and Lukuga 5.

This figure, with its large head and slightly elongated face, characteristic stance, stocky proportion, and large hands, has subsequently been attributed to the Kusu, northern neighbors of the Luba, by Franfois Neyt (1977:313).2 The 1961 acquisition of the Kuba king figure of Bom Bosh, who reigned in the seventeenth century, was a significant moment in the development of the collection (Fig. 2). This figure, given to a Belgian colonial official by a Bushongo chief in 1910, is one of five commemorative portrait statues that survive of the earlier kings (Vansina 1972: 45-46) and the only one of these five in the United States. Three are in the British Museum and one is in the Musee Royal de l'Afrique Centrale. This figure, impor- tant historically and artistically, as well as the numerous utilitarian objects and raffia fiber textiles acquired by Culin in 1922, brings the museum's Kuba holdings to an exceptionally high level. Culin's 1922 acquisition of a triple-headed Lega figurine (Fig. 5) was admirably complemented in 1974 by a second Lega figure received as a gift. The former 46</page><page sequence="6">"represents the concept of Sakimatwematwe, Mr. Many Heads, signifying the wisdom and the impartiality of the kindi" (Biebuyck 1973: pl. 86), the highest grade of the Bwami association. The Kongo, esteemed for their small, highly expres- sive carvings, are represented by a Yombe maternity figure, one of three acquired by Culin in 1922 (Fig. 9). Curiously, this one has two mirror-covered magic resin boxes, one on the torso of the child and the other on the back of the female. The boxes suggest a meaning be- yond that of maternity or motherhood to those potent spirit forces controlling the concept of female fertility.3 The Bwende are a Kongo-related people. In their cult of the dead, over life-size, red-cloth figures (niombo), enveloping the deceased as a kind of shroud, appear in funeral processions. The curious, never awkward, and 10.

Some of the elaborate designs on the torso refer to the lineage of the person; there are other symbolic markings not always understood by the unini- tiated. According to Ragnar Widman, the niombo cult is linked to the cult of the ancestors and the power of the elders. One finds large or small wooden figures carved to confine the power and spirit of those they represent (Fig. 19). The anthropomorphic wooden tobacco pipe from the Central Grasslands region concludes this part of the discussion devoted to Brooklyn's Congo region hold- ings (Fig. 8). Acquired by Culin in 1922, this pipe has been attributed by Dr. Leon Siroto to possibly the Ngbandi, or Western Azande. Received without its stem, this object is an ingenious combination of forms. The bowl is in the form of a human head; the tube and filter are in the shape of a palm fruit. Turning to the regions of the Western Sudan and Guinea Coast, one finds that the majority of objects were donated in recent years, as was, for example, a particularly fine pair of Bambara antelope headdresses, given in 1977 (Fig. 11). But there are three Culin 1922 accessions worthy of note: a Bambara figure (Fig. 7), a Guro zamle dance mask acquired in Paris from Paul Guillaume (Fig. 10), and a Yoruba door from the Ekiti region acquired in London from W. O. Oldman (Fig. 16). The central themes of the door are fertility, warfare, and hunting. Moving from top to bottom, the depictions are: a row of women with children on their backs; a mounted warrior flanked by two attendants, one of whom is his staff bearer; two hunters or warriors holding a net; a row of warriors holding sheathed guns. A type of Fon magical charm called gbo is one of the most interesting pieces from Benin (formerly Dahomey) (Fig. 17). Herskovits (1938, vol. 2: 280-81), in his classifi- cation of gbo, identifies the various types carved in wood and representing the human form. The Brooklyn exam- ple most closely resembles a type called nyangboliafo, a human male figure that has a pointed iron spike at- tached at its lower end. It can perform evil as well as good, for example, protecting its owner while he sleeps or driving an enemy of its owner to madness. Unlike Herskovits's illustration, however, the Brooklyn piece has two heads instead of one and is covered not only with cord but with additional magical objects and sub- stances, including a jawbone and bird skull. The encrus- tation is probably the result of the application of chicken blood used to activate this type of gbo. The elegant headdress of the Baga or Nalu was a 1974 gift to the collection (Fig. 12). Previously reported in the literature as a smaller version of a nimba and associated with cultivation, it has more recently been identified as a small headdress called yok&amp;, used in dances to mark the 12.

Its function is to encourage fertility and protect a woman from sterility. Also from the Guinea Coast region comes the Yoruba mask that has been of interest for quite some time (Fig. 14). At first tentatively identified as a Gelede Great Mother mask, it was subsequently found by Dr. Henry Drewal to have a strong similarity to a piece in the Nigerian National Museum, Lagos, catalogued as an "Apa mask from Ila Orangun."4 The carving style is markedly Yoruba. The face of the mask is painted a rich brown-red, and the helmet, indigo. The precise function and context are still to be determined. African metalwork has always been of special techni- cal interest. The collection includes a number of metal pieces from the Guinea Coast, for example, the gold pendant of a coiled snake holding a frog or toad in its mouth (Fig. 20). This type of ornament from the Ivory Coast was used by the Ebrib, Adjukru, Alladian, and others. When acquired in 1954, the piece was reported to have belonged to Abrogoua, a king of the Ebribs, who died in 1811.s Cast by the lost-wax method, it is one of 14. MASK. YORUBA, EKITI REGION, NIGERIA.

Dr. Earle R. Caley of Ohio State University reported that the object is about 40% gold, or 9.6 carats. The underlying metal is alloyed with silver and a higher percentage of copper. The surface is unalloyed gold produced by the mise en couleur process. Interestingly, Dr. Caley detected that the rough under- surface indicates the use of a sand mold, and the smooth upper surface, a clay mold. The technique demonstrates a sophisticated skill in the art of goldworking. Examples of art made for the court of Benin include a figure of the Oba's hornblower (Fig. 13) and an ivory gong (Fig. 21), both dating from about the seventeenth century. The figure was the second examined by Dr. Caley and proved to be an alloy of copper, zinc, and lead, containing tin, iron, nickel, and silver as im- purities. To be technically accurate, Dr. Caley suggested that the figure be referred to as a leaded brass.6 Dr. Caley also noted that the tooling, or chasing, of the surface was finished after the casting, a procedure often used in Benin. The ivory bell or gong, formerly in the Pitt-Rivers collection, is one of five surviving decorated examples and the only one in the United States.7 On the side that remains, the Oba is depicted with his hands ceremo- nially supported by two retainers, a position that indi- cates high rank. According to Bradbury (1973: 253), on the most important ceremonial occasions the Oba's arms are supported in this manner by the Ezomo and the Edaiken. The former is one of the seven hereditary nobles who constitute the highest order of chieftaincy in the Benin kingdom, and a supreme military comman- der; the latter is the Oba's heir. Also present are the familiar Benin motifs of mudfish, which is a royal emblem associated with Olokun, the god of the sea and riches, on either side of the Oba's skirt; and a hand, a symbol of success and accomplishment, in upright posi- tion clenched in the jaws of a crocodile, "the sacrificial victim par excellence" (Bradbury 1973: 267) and a symbol of physical power. These two pieces, as well as an altar head and tusk, several plaques, and other objects consti- tute an important group from the Benin kingdom. In contrast to them are the Ekpo society masks of the village-based Bini. The Brooklyn collection includes several such masks; one of the most interesting was received as a gift in 1978 (Fig. 15). From its inception, as this brief collection survey demonstrates, the Brooklyn Museum's African collec- tion has always been presented as art rather than ethnography. Its scope, following the Culin years, has been considerably broadened and enriched through selective purchases by its curators and, more important- ly, through the generosity of its donors. To this day, it is they who, on perceiving gaps in the collection, seek to fill them. Understanding its strengths, they seek to en- rich them with works that are a tribute to the masterful skill and ingenuity of the African artisan and the dynamic past of his continent.

Unfortunately, Culin never recorded, or did not know, the years during which the Belgian collection had been formed. The 1906 date for the Chokwe container is the only one firmly known prior to 1922. 2. Frangois Neyt discusses and illustrates a male figure in a Belgian private collection that is quite similar to the Brooklyn figure. He refers to Olbrechts's illustration of the latter (pl. 47) and identifies both carvings as Kusu, but he did not know the location of the Brooklyn sculpture at the time. 3. For a detailed discussion of this type of figure and the use of magic resin boxes "as a concept of augmenting a spirit's power," see Leon Siroto, African Spirit Images and Identities (Pace Gallery, New York, 1976), pp. 15-16. 4.

Dr. Caley's report states: "Quantitative chemical analysis of a sample of metal obtained from drillings in different places in the feet gave the following results: copper=87.77%, zinc=5.10%, lead=4.60%, tin=0.59%, iron=0.59%, nick- el=0.24%, silver=0.05%. Total metals=98.94%. The defi- ciency of 1.06% is apparently due to oxygen and other non- metals. .... It is not a bronze since the percentage of tin is too low. Neither is it a brass in the usual sense, since the percen- tage of zinc is too low." 7.
