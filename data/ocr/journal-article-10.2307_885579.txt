<plain_text><page sequence="1">Venice, Palazzo Grassi Marcel Duchamp Although it is not the case, as has been suggested recently, that there is no need for a Duchamp exhibition, on the grounds that his work is conceptual rather than visual, there is a serious question as to whether it is possible to hold one anywhere other than in Philadelphia. There can be no compensation for the absence of his two masterpieces, The bride stripped bare by her bachelors, even (The large glass, 1915-23), and his final work, Etant donnis .. (Given 1. The waterfall 2. The illuminating gas). Each is singular, complex, absolutely central to his work and immovable from its present site at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Both have distinctive relationships to the works (notes as well as objects) that precede or accompany them, not just as their summary or conclusion, but in terms rather of a process of mutual illumination. It is to the credit of the exhibition at the 502</page><page sequence="2">EXHIBITION REVIEWS Palazzo Grassi, Venice (Marcel Duchamp, to 18th July) that we miss them for the right reasons - that is, not because the works on show are insufficiently interesting in their own right, but because the climaxes are lacking. Etant donnis is the more serious absence, because nothing in the cluster of objects in the last room of the exhibition, casts, drawings, moulds and so on, spin- offs from the long, underground process of its making, can give an insight into the experience of seeing it in the flesh. The 1972 exhibition at Philadelphia itself is the only one which has been able to include Etant donnis. The Centre Georges Pompidou in 1977 included a kind of mock-up with a large colour photograph. Pontus Hulten has wisely refrained from any attempt to replicate it, but the photographic docu- mentation in the catalogue, useful as it is, cannot adequately signal its importance. Etant donnis, on which Duchamp worked off and on for twenty years (1946-66) re- mained a closely guarded secret until his death in 1968. His were the only obituaries I have ever known which opened up rather than closed down the events of a life, for it was there that Etant donnis was first revealed. Its existence thoroughly embarrassed all those who had been writing and teaching knowingly about the causes and conse- quences of Duchamp's notorious silence, his apparent rejection of a career as an artist. The initial veto on its photographic reproduction has been removed, but that has not helped much, since the thing as a whole cannot be photographed, the door through which the 'room' is viewed being furnished only with two tiny peepholes, which look onto a life-size nude lying in a magical landscape. However, as Pontus Hulten points out firmly in the catalogue,' there are over two hundred substantial works besides these two, a remarkable total for someone who refused to repeat himself and consistently outmanceuvred the commercial pressures of the art world. Pretty well all of them are on show here, together with numerous other objects and a substantial quantity of the various collections of published 'notes'. Among the most revealing are photographs, many by Man Ray, some of Duchamp en femme. Often the only record of an event, action or idea, whose significance, given Duchamp's modes of operation, could be considerable, these photographs raise in- teresting questions about authorship. The first part of the exhibition, leading up to Ulf Linde's new replica of The large glass, is the most successful. It begins, not at the beginning, but at the point when Du- champ rejected the purely retinal (c.1913- 14). If a spirit of cynicism produced the first readymades, it is not simply their negativity that now stands out from the vantage point of this exhibition. The first room, rather pretentiously entitled 'sala della bellezza d'indifferenza' contains just one thing: the Bottle rack of 1914. The French term igouttoir, as the catalogue points out, brilliantly expresses the draining of taste which Duchamp suggested was a consider- ation m his choice of readymade. Perhaps it was just a happy coincidence, then, that the object itself seems to have so many 56. Turm', by Marcel Duchamp. 1918. Oil and pencil, 69.8 by 313 cm. (Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven; exh. Palazzo Grassi, Venice). visual and conceptual reverberations in the rest of his work. The spidery antennae, like those of the Hat rack, hint at the insect- like form of the Bride, but its shape overall at the same time indubitably resembles the Bachelors' 'malic moulds'; in purely formal terms, too, there is the way its pyramidal shape breaks down into a cone and a cylinder, which, combined with the circle of the bicycle wheel and the bent square of In advance of the broken arm, hints at a faintly malicious, ironic game with ideal forms in the early readymades, while subsequent ones, like Fountain, take on an anthropomorphic character. Bottle rack is followed by a beautifully paced series of rooms displaying the ex- ploration of new or alternative ways of generating visual images, using a variety of techniques such as chance, a-logical cal- culations, linguistic puns, mechanical and architectural drawing and so on. As Du- champ said in an interview for the BBC in 1959, he was after a 'completely, personally new, expression', whose final product was to be 'a welding of mental and visual reactions'. To label the process presented here as 'conceptual' is not only to eliminate half of it, but also to imply that it is con- tained, a neat move from a to b, its con- sequences known in advance. There is a strong sense that, waterwings off, Duchamp did not know exactly where he was going. The key to the exhibition's aims lies in Pontus Hulten's short catalogue essay: 'The beauty of the total process is very stimulating. There is immense pleasure to be derived from the contemplation of the different steps of these proceedings, which allow us to see how an important question is dealt with: seriously, elegantly and with great precision.' And it was precisely the mixture of ideas and visual representations that generated such a head of steam, as one moves from the reductio ad absurdum of the readymades to the seductio ad absurdum of The bride stripped bare by her bachelors, even. Several paintings stand out with sur- prising grandeur in these first rooms: Riseaux de stoppages italon, for instance, of 1914, and Tu m' (fill in your verb at will), of 1918 (Fig.56). The latter, fittingly for Du- champ's last painting, shows the ghostly tentacles of the readymades casting their shadows over a satirical compilation of a 57.

Among the treasures in the 'Sala dei Readymades' are two miniatures of Fountain, the only readymade to provoke a (carefully orchestrated) public scandal: one in varnished papier mache, the other in glazed ceramic. Not the most striking instances, perhaps, but they remind us of Duchamp's fascination with the craft and construction aspects of the artist's job, and his endlessly fruitful investigation of the properties of materials. Given the readymades' character as a- art (rather than anti-art), and as serial destroyers of the aura of the unique and original work of art, it is their spare pre- cision that this exhibition underlines (Fig.57). But this has little relationship to the discourse, common at the time, of the superior aesthetic beauty of machines and the industrial world. They are just as dis- tant from Marinetti's racing car as they are from the Victory of Samothrace: dom- estic rather than sublime, commonplace and ideally fitted for the function from which Duchamp detaches them. This first sequence of rooms culminates in Ulf Linde's new replica of The large glass (he made the first over thirty years ago). The degree to which the replicas fall short of representing the original never fails to surprise, but Linde's version is better than nothing. The double-banked glass panels in their wood and steel frame, over nine feet tall, are more ponderous, their surface much neater and flatter than the original, but here they make a wonderful window onto the Grand Canal. The icon- ography of Duchamp's cynical commentary on sex and art in the modern world, The bride stripped bare by her bachelors, even, is notoriously over-determined. What stands out unmistakeably in Venice, though, is its blasphemous resemblance to an altar- piece, and especially to an Assumption of the Virgin - Titian's in S. Maria dei Frari is, as has been suggested before, a particu- larly rich comparison. The huge store of material in the Palazzo Grassi is presented with no other explan- ation than Duchamp's own notes, inscribed on the low platforms that are one of the happier aspects of the blocky white setting which covers up most of the magnificent interior. The installation capitalises on the blurring of conventional categories, inte- grating notes from the various published collections with the readymades, paintings, photographs, optical instruments and films. In spite of lighting that manages to be simultaneously intrusive and inadequate (the perennial problem of trying to show drawings and photographs demanding lower light levels with paintings and objects is certainly not solved here) the scraps of notes beg and repay close scrutiny. But the impetus of the first few rooms is not sustained. This initial examination of an absorbing process, which integrates the readymades with the drawings, plans and paintings for The large glass, is succeeded by a more inventory-like approach. But Duchamp got there first as usual, and is his own best curator. Several of the 'Boites en valise', Duchamp's portable museums of his own work, are present, both in order to set up the Box in some of its many display-combinations (Fig.58), and to in- clude some of the original works from the de luxe editions (the various versions have been well catalogued recently by Ecke Bonk).3 Among these are Paysage fautif (whose medium, unspecified in the Venice catalogue, is given by Bonk as 'Seminal fluid on Astralon, backed with black satin'), and what looks like a kind of female counter- part, Tifs. But nothing in the later parts of the exhibition matches the Boite for in- vention and ingenuity of staging. The room of early paintings is inevitably something of a let down. There is a worthy but rather overblown demonstration of Duchamp's sources for the late engravings, Morceaux choisis d'apres .. .', which goes to the length of importing an oil painting by Ingres. The catalogue, full of fascinating ma- terial, is obsessionally wayward, and patchy, like the labels in the exhibition itself, in the provision of basic information, such as the medium of a work. I shall not attempt to describe the chronology, or 'Ephemerides on and about Marcel Duchamp and Rrose Sdlavy', which takes a single year, to each day of which the events of a particular date are attached. It baffles the information- retriever, but is hard to put down. Many still resist the ever-growing evi- dence that Duchamp is the single most important influence on twentieth-century art. A cross little squib in the Independent last year by Bernard Jacobson claimed that his work was a series of one-liner jokes, a 'cul de sac in the history of art' and that he 'comes across as the modern art world's greatest villain'. Equally moralistic in tone but more considered is the view that he, more than any other artist, is symptomatic of the malaise of twentieth-century art and expresses most completely its negative cast of mind. This exhibition sets out to under- line, on the contrary, what an extraordinary range of artists, from Picabia to Matta to JasperJohns to Damien Hirst (any number of alternative lists could be substituted), have long recognised, that Duchamp's work springs from visual as much as con- ceptual precision, and will continue to take it from there. But it is obviously a mistake to judge someone's value by the extent of their influence. There is no sign that the debate is closing. DAWN ADES University of Essex 'Marcel Duchamp.
