Across the breadth of Canada and into Finland and Scandinavia, a wave of death affect- ing numerous species of birds and mammals, and millions of individuals, sweeps the northern hemisphere at ten year intervals. Apparently, it happens also in New Zealand. It seems to *the reviewer that this periodicity alone is so striking as to eliminate the last chance that local and random plant successions can pos- sibly account for the phenomenon, Grange has brought to.gether many interesting facts. That plant and animal successions are correlated I imagine nobody will question, but that these can account for the ten-year cycle or any other large-scale cycle, I, personally, find it impossible to believe. That game abundance can be enhanced by manipulating the local plant environment seems equally beyond doubt, and if such control could be applied simultaneously on a continental scale, I would certainly entertain a hope that the ten-year cycle m.ight some day be harnessed by management. In the meantime, I am afraid I shall remain a. skeptical-and possibly an obnoxious -reviewer of Grange's Explanation of Game Cycles.-Wm. Rowan. 36. Evolution Emerging. William King Gregory. 1951.

This extensive treatise combines an interesting presentation of selected evidences for the current concepts of the stages and pathways of the evolution of animals with numerous philosophic suggestions and theories concerning the dynamics of evolution. As one would expect from the author's numerous important researches, the core of the treatise is paleontologic; however, the author *has by no means dwelt alone on prosaic descriptions and comparisons of fossils but has extensively interwoven innumerable inferences concerning the biology of fossil groups as well as evi- dences and ideas from comparative anatomy, comparative embryology, ecology, and, to a considerably lesser extent, comparative physiology, comparative psy- chology, and genetics. The basic philosophy of the treatise is best expressed in the words of the author. "In the present work we -shall not be concerned pri- marily with the classic problems whether the course of -organic evolution has been guided by natural selection or by some other natural system. Even the hereditary and statistical mechanisms through which evolution works will be taken for granted here because they are being dealt with (as in the growing volumes on evolution) by many who are more competent to do so. Still less we are inter- ested in proving evolution. . . . Our postulates . . . are as follows: (1) Evolution, the natural history of the universe and its parts, deals with the processes and results of the transformation of energy and matter, viewed against the background of time and space. (2) Our sense organs and measuring instruments give only partial information of the complexities of the subject matter; our mental pictures, written records, symbols and measurements of evolution, having been made by fallible human beings, are often anthropomorphic or at best approximate. Never- theless, since scientists are always subjecting their colleagues' results to the test of experience, there is in the long run a rapidly growing residue of increasing approximation to the facts of evolution." (p. 7.) Volume I contains the text (with references to pertinent figures in Volume II), a classified bibliography of 143 pages and several thousand references, an index of authors, and a general index. Volume II contains only illustrations with a minimum of explanatory material, The total number of individual illustrations must exceed five thousand. Although the majority are concerned with the mor- phology of fossils, many depict restorations, morphology and anatomy of living species, and phylogenetic relationships. This valuable collection of illustrations will prove invaluable to zoologists in general, regardless of the field 'of specific interest. The text has an unusual, but effective, organization and order of presen- tation. Part One consists of an introduction and chapters concerning respectively (I) "the first living things" (bacteria, Protophyta, and Protozoa through Amelida), (II) the Mollusca, and (III) the Arthropoda. Part Two, "Emergence of 'the Vertebrates . . .," consists of chapters on (IV) "coelomate foodsifters of diverse types" (Brachiopoda, Polyzoa, and Echinodermata), (V) the prochordates 'and the origin of vertebrates, (VI) the jaw-less vertebrates, (VII) placoderms, (VIII)</page><page sequence="2">Vol. XXII 1951 Recent Literature [141 elasmobranchs, and (IX) bony fish. Part Three is concerned with the air- breathing fish, amphibians, reptiles, and birds; it contains chapters on (X) lung fishes, (XI) amphibians, (XII) origin of reptiles, (XIII) invasion of aquatic habitats by reptiles, (XIV) archosaurians, and (XV) pterosaurs and birds. Part Four, chapters XVI-XXIV, is concerned with the evolution of mammals. Part Six, "Evolution Emerging: Retrospect and Prospect," consists of a single chapter dealing with certain philosophic aspects of evolution. The text maintains reader-interest well. It is interestingly jolting, however, to pass from such head- ings as "The impetuous swordfish and the leaping marlin," "Leaping on all fours," and "The sharp-eyed blennies and their slithery relatives" to the relatively tech- nical terminology of the texts beneath them. The author repeatedly cautions against anthropocentrism in the development of theory of evolution and assails (p. 455) those who fail to place man in his rightful place in the scheme of animal evolution. Further (p. 231) he vigorously assails the contention of Broom that progressive evolution has come to an end and that man is after all the main objective and climax of evolutionary advance. The reviewer is prompted to observe, nevertheless, that "Evolution Emerging" could unwittingly contribute to this very type of anthropocentrism, particularly in the case of the more casual and non-critical reader. Of the 560 pages of text, 411 concern the Vertebrata, the sub-phylum to which man belongs. The arrange- ment is one which pyramids to the evolution of the human species, including "Part Five. The Devious Paths to Man" and Chapter XXIV, "Man's Debt to the Past." The latter traces evolution from the origin of life to the development of the human species. Birds are discussed in Chapter XV (pp. 312-322) together with the pterosaurs. In general the treatment is that of the classical paleontology with little reference to material in publications since 1935. The latest citation to Wetmore is 1933 and the latest to Howard is 1932. One finds no reference to the paleontologic investigations of Loye Miller nor to the comparative myologic studies of Hudson. The reviewer finds it somewhat difficult to consider feathers as "excretions" and scales as ada-ptations of feathers. The swallows are referred to the Alaudidae in the text (p. 320) and are omitted from the phylogenetic diagram (Plate 15. 1, Volume II). The author aptly states the principle which must be observed at all times by students of avian physiology and avian behavior. "Both birds and mam- mals are warm blooded animals and have been derived from cold blooded lizard- like reptiles; so that there has been considerable parallelism in end results, which have been achieved by similar means. However, the older heritage and derivation of birds and.mammals are widely different." (p. 326.) Throughout the text (pp. 228, 310, 549, for example) one encounters reference to and discussion of isomeres, anisomeres, polyisomeres, and polyanisomeres. Poly- isomeres are groups of repetitive units (structures, organs, events, etc.); aniso- meres are specialized isomeres. "But each polyisomere has its own individuality, for even if they look exactly alike they will have different histories in space and time, as in the case of different leaves on a tree or different ones of the paired appendages of Crustacea, or different generations. . . . In so far as different polyisomeres show difference in sizes or in emphasis of any given character, they are termed anisomeres (unequal parts). Polyisomeres (implying repetition, units, serial numbers) and anisomeres (implying either positive or negative em- phasis, degrees) form an associative or correlative pair of categories of wide application in nature and even in the special worlds of man. After we have once learned to know them, we are forced to wonder why others, especially students of natural and social science have not commonly recognized them as such. The answer is that the differences between polyisomeres and polyanisomeres of differ- ent kinds and origins are so conspicuous that each kind has received its own name . . . Daisies, flies, sand grains, chocolate bars, votes, vertebrae and mos- quitoes, we know separately . . . [but] we may fail completely to recognize the utility of lumping them all together under a single class." (p. 549.) Granting the eloquence of the discussion and the large number of apparently pertinent cases, there still remains to be developed the true basic meaning in terms of genetics, ontogeny, physiology, and natural selection. Viewed in light of its objectives and postulates, and as a portrayal of the evo- lution of certain groups as indicated primarily by the fossil record with support.</page><page sequence="3">142] Recent Literature Bird-Banding July ing evidence from other sources, "Evolution Emerging" is a treatise which should prove itself to be of noteworthy usefulness to biologists and laymen not extensively versed in animal paleontology, Its interesting text and wealth of illustrations make it an important exposition of this aspect of our knowledge of evolution.-D.

Volume VII of this invaluable reference is the first concerned with the Passeriformes. Included is the suborder Eurylaimi (broadbills) as well as the Dendrocolaptidae (wood-hewers), Funariidae (ovenbirds), Conopophagidae (ant-pipits), and Rhinocryptidae (tapaculos) of the superfamily Furnarioidea, suborder Tyranni. In general the plan of the previous volumes is followed al- though in the case of the Furnarioidea only the synonymy since Hellmayr, rather than since Sharpe, is given. With respect to the Furnarioidea it is of interest to note that Volume VII admits approximately 300 forms more than Hellmayr's revision of a quarter century ago. It is always an extreme pleasure to note fur- ther progress towards the completion of this monumental series and to anticipate the consequently greater ease in the use of proper nomenclature.-D. S.

There doubtless still are a few zoologists who decry taxonomy as a field of little modern-day importance-one in which there remains scant opportunity for yielding contributions of broad biological significance. To the contrary, systematics is just now coming into its own. The taxonomist is no longer a closet naturalist who deals only with dried, stuffed, or otherwise pre- served specimens in the museum. He is just as much concerned with the biology of living populations of the groups with which he is working. The techniques employed by the author of the present paper typify the trend in modern system- atics. Having already measured and critically studied no less than 1,156 museum specimens of a kind of bird in which there were supposedly several "good" species, he then went several times into the field to southern Mexico, to ascertain how these alleged species responded to their environment and to each other. His results are classic, and biologists are now nearer than they were before to under- standing fully the process of speciation in birds as well as in all higher groups. Specifically the paper deals with the perplexing relationships of the Red-eyed Towhees of Mexico, especially with the ocai-7naculatus problem. These two radi- cally unlike Towhees occur in one place (Oaxaca) side by side without inter- breeding; in another place (Mount Orizaba), the two exist side by side but pro- duce only occasional hybrids; finally, in a third place (Cerro Viejo, Jalisco), the two "species" hybridize so promiscuously that a sample of 77 specimens of the population there yielded no two that are alike. Areas such as this, demonstrating degrees of breakdown of reproductive isolation between two species, shed much light on the mechanics of species formation in higher vertebrates. They are to the zoologist the proving ground that the laboratory is to the chemist. Of special interest to ornithologists of the United States is the fact that Sibley advocates reducing the Spotted Towhees, Pipilo maculatus Swainson, of the West, to a sub- species of the Eastern Towhee, Pipilo erythrophthalmus (Linnaeus). The latter name has priority and hence would become the specific name of the group. In support of this action, Sibley's arguments are both logical and convincing. The paper is deserving of the attention of all serious students of ornit-hologyd-George H. Lowery, Jr. 39. Migration of Birds. Frederick C. Lincoln. 1950. Fish and Wildlife Service, U. S.
