<plain_text><page sequence="1">310 HETERODOX TRIBES OF ASIA MINOR.' By the late F. W. HASLUCK. I. ? 1. INTRODUCTORY. PROFESSOR VON LUScOAN, in his Huxley lecture on Early Inhabitants of Asia Minor,2 has done much to bring order into our ideas of the still insufficiently known ethno- logical and religious divisions of that country. His studies are based mainly on his personal observations, and his point of view is for the most part that of a physical anthropologist. rns predecessors in field work, dealing generally with narrower areas, have produced a great mass of literature, scattered or in some cases difficult of access, and no serious attempt has been made to approach the problems involved from the historical side. It therefore seems worth while at this stage to bring together the scattered material of explorers and coLlate with it such historical information as may be gleaned from printed sources, with the object of presenting in one view a summary of the facts at our disposal and the problems they suggest for the investigation of future explorers in the history, and particularly the religious history, of Anatolia. European travellers in Asia Minor, mainly classical archoeologists and very seldom orientalists, are generally better acquainted with Christianity than with Islam. Consequently, the divisions of the Christians are more obvious to them than those of the Mahommedan populations. By most the latter are regarded as a single whole, and any divergence they may notice from orthodox Sunni practice suggests to them that the population in question has been affected by Christianitv, that is, it represents an originally Christian population half-converted to Islam. This 1 [My husband left this article in an unfinished condition. Shortly before his death, he expressed a doubt as to whether it should be published, but as illness and war conditions had separated him for more than three years from his MS., he spoke from memory only. It has seemed to me that Part I could be published as it stood and that a little editing, mostly in the form of re-arrangement, would render Part II also suitable for publication. This has been done, but as my husband wished the article, if published, to be re-printed as a chapter in his book, Studies in Greek and Turkish Popular Religion, I should be grateful for any suggestions or criticisms which would assist me in removing blemishes from the article before its final incorpora- tion in this book.

HASLUCK.-Heterodox Tribes of Asia Minor. 311 archoeologically attractive theory is especially dangerous in so far as it touches anthropological questions, since the supposed converted Christians are naturally assumed to be a pre-Turkish, and, in default of evidence to the contrary (which is never forthcoming), an aboriginal population. The archoeologists, then, mainly on the evidence afforded by religion, hold that (1) the heterodox tribes are converted Christians, and they gladly accept the theory of the anthropologists, based mainly on craniology, that (2) the heterodox tribes are aboriginal. The orientalists, headed by Vambery, deny both these statements, holding that the peoples concerned are mainly of Turkish blood anid comiparatively recent immigrants from Western Persia or beyond. As far as religion is concerned, the main purpose of the present paper is to eniphasise the fact that, though crypto-Christians exist in Asia Minor, many, if not most, of the unorthodox practices obtaining amongst tribes supposed to have been originally Christian, are in fact to be referred either (1) to the primitive stratum of religion, which survives in superstitious practice among Christians no less than Mahommedans, or (2) to the Shia branch of the Mahommedan faith, which, though orthodox in Persia, is to the Sunni Turks quite as much outside the pale as the Christianity of the Armenian is to the Greek or vice versa. It is probable that many Turkish tribes, passing through Northern Persia on their way westwards, first met with Islam in the Shia form, so that the Shia religion may be considered to some extent as the link between paganism and Sunni Mahom- medanism. We can certainly point to a period during which a Shia, or at least a Persianising, form of Islam was prevalent, together with a culture derived almost exclusively fromn Persia, in Central Asia Minor. Very considerable confusion has also arisen with regard to the heterodox tribes of Asia Minor owing to a vague and inaccurate use of tribal and other names. It has been more or less assumed that, whatever their original significance, the names Yourouk, Turcoman, Kyzylbash, Takhtadji, Bektash, etc., are on the same footing and have ethnological significance. An examination of what has been written on the tribes in question leads to the conclusion that some of these names denote, not ethnological, but religious and other divisions. Thus, of the names cited above, Yourouk' in itself denotes no more than the nomadic life of the tribes so designated, while Turcoman is a tribal name wrongly used to cover a much larger division of the population. Takhtadji (" woodcutter ") is essentially a caste-name, Kyzylbash (" red-head ") is a nickname for a widely distributed religious sect, while Bektash designates members of a religious organisation within that sect. So far from these categories being mutually exclusive, it would be possible for a single person to come under all of them. 1 Tk. youroumek = to walk. The word " Yourouk " is first used, as far as I can discover, by Ryeaut (Hist. of the Turks, ii, 138; cf. Pococke, Descr. of the East II, ii, 108) of the nomads of the Troad.</page><page sequence="3">312 F. W. HASLUCK.--Heterodox Tribes of Asia Minor. ? 2. THE YOUROUKS. The term Yourouk has long been recognised by ethnologists as of very wide and vague application: in itself, as we have said, it signifies no more than " nomadic." Dr. Tsakyroglous of Smyrna, whose profession has given him unusual opportunities for intimacy with the Yourouks of his vilayet, is the only writer who has dealt with the Anatolian Yourouks as a whole.1 He enumerates no less than eighty-eight tribes of them, varying greatly in size and importance and distributed over all parts of Asia Minor.2 His list, however, does not profess to be complete, though, if we except the short list of tribes in the Aidin vilayet given by Vambery,3 it is the only attempt to collect Anatolian tribal names. As the pamphlet containing this list is inacces- sible, the list is given in full below,4 together with some tribal names collected by Langlois in Cilicia, and, for comparison, a list of Turcoman tribes given to Niebuhr by Patrick Russell of Aleppo. The Yourouk tribes (ashiret) bear for the most part personal names, presumably of ancestral chiefs, with or without the adjectival suffix -1i. Exainples are Dourgout, Ahmedli, Gueuk Mousali, Shichli. It is significant that the chief of the latter tribe bears the surname Shichli Baba Zade (" Son of Father Shichli "). Other tribes bear names apparently denoting their habitat, as Akdaghli (" ol the White Mountain "), and Roumli, or characteristics as Katchar (" runners "), Tash-evli (" stonehouse men "), Boini Indjeli (" slim-figured men "), Sari Ketchi-li (" men with yellow goats "). Traces of early divisions of originally united tribes are probably to be seen in) the numerous tribal names running in pairs, such as Selge- and Keles-Katchar,5 Kara- and Sari-Tekkeli, Kyzyl- and Kara-Ketchili. Colour-epithets, such as Kara (" black "), Ak (" white "), Kyzyl (" red "), Sari (" yellow "), and Gueuk (" blue") are probably in all cases taken from the natural colour or distinctive nmarkings of the flocks of two divisions of the same tribe ; this seems clear from the occurrence of such names as Ak-koyounlu (white sheep tribe), Aladja-koyounlu (spotted sheep tribe), Kyzyl-ketchili (red goat tribe), etc. Some of the Anatolian tribe-names occur also further East, as Odemish in Merv6 and Kengerlu in Transcaucasia.' From the Katchar tribe, which is also to be found 1 HEypt rPovpoviXwv (pp. 40), Athens, 1891. There is also a French translation printed at Smyrna.

Nadir Shah was of the Afshar tribe of Khorassan, with which the Anatolian Afshars claim kinship.2 Of the Yourouk tribes in the Aidin vilayet enumerated by Vambery, the Bourkhan, Narindjali, and Kirtish still exist among the Central Asian Turcomans. Baiandir is a subdivision of the Goklen tribe.3 A very large proportion of the tribal names can be found also on the map of Asia Minor as village names, presumably denoting places where tribes or portions of tribes have settled. Examples are Baindir, Ushak, Odemish, Kenger, Tourgoutlou, and many others. Though most of these tribes are pastoral, some are addicted to other callings the Katchar and Varsak are camel-men, many of the Yourouks of Mount Ida are woodcutters, the Abdal, whom von Luschan identifies with the gypsies, a beggar caste.4 Other tribes are distinguished by their skill in certain crafts, as the Turkmen, Harmandali, and Zili in carpet-weaving, and the Kenger of Adala (near Koula in Lydia) in massage.5 The head of the tribe is called Bey or Sheikh.6 The tribe is subdivided into kabilehs (" clans ") or mcahallas (" quarters," " wards "), the latter a word in common use as a division of a town among the settled populations. Divisions of the same tribe are found in widely-separated districts in Asia Minor: evidence of such splitting up is to be found in the occurrence of certain tribal-names all over the map. On the other hand, some tribes have a well-defined area within which their settlements are thickly planted. Of this the Afshar tribe of the Taurus affords a notable instance.7 Similarly, the original home of the Farsak tribe in Asia Minor seems to have been the mountainous region North-West of Selefke which bears their name.8 But scattered units of both tribes, to judge by the evidence of the map, wandered far. The languages current among the Yourouks are varied. They are mostly rough dialects of Turkish, among which those of Azerbeijan and Jagatai have been recog- nised.9 Dr. Chasseaud of Smyrna tells me he has found that Yourouks from diflerent parts (presumably of the Aidin vilayet), even when they acknowledge kinship, are unable to understand each other. Tsakyroglous says, furth'er, that some tribes speak Kurdish, i.e. probably, that some nomads are Kurds, and that the Abdal speak a language of their own.10 1 Vambery, 572, 577. 2 Vambery, 607. 3 Vambery, 394. 4Tsakyroglous, op. cit., 19.

As to the religion of the Yourouks, on which subject they are extremely reticent, very varied accounts have been given. Humann speaks of them in Western Asia Minor as entirely without religion.' Drs. Tsakyroglous and Chasseaud, with their more intimate knowledge, concur in considering them (negatively) heretical. Some nomad tribes are certainly Shia,2 while the Yourouks of Lycia are reported by Bent to be good Sunni Mahommedans.3 These discrepant accounts are intelligible only when we realise that the Yourouks are not a homogeneous race, but a collection of tribes and sub-tribes which, originally pagan, have fallen to a greater or less degree under various missionary influences. It is generally reported of Yourouks that circumcision is not usually practised among them, and that when the operation is performed from motives of policy, they prefer that it should not be done by a Sunni in orthodox fashion. A similar prejudice is implied by the story quoted by Tsakyroglous4 from the Turkish news- paper Hakikat to the effect that a Jew from the Dardanelles is habitually invited by the Yourouks of Mount Ida to perform for them some ritual act at marriages. This is probably a confusion, the same word (duyun) being commonly used by the Turks both for marriage and circumcision (properly sunnet).5 Dr. Chasseaud tells nme that when he has operated on Yourouks the feast was made several days after, and a hodja duly invited. It was then explained to the latter that the operation had been already performed, and his scruples silenced by a present of money. The object of this manoeuvre is probably to ensure the proper disposal of the part amputated in order that it may not come into the wrong hands.6 Siiilarly, Dr. Chasseaud tells me both Yourotik women and 1 Verhandclungen Ges. f. ErclkAundce, 1880, 248. 2 C. B. Elliott, Travels, ii, 107 (Turcomans near Akhissar); Hadji Khalfa, tr. Armain, 656 (Turcomans near Trebizond); ibid., 683 (liva of Bozouk = Kirshehr). The Afshars are Sunni (Karolides, Ta Ko'buuva, 42) but do not veil women. 3 J. R. Anthr. Inst., xx, 274; cf. von Luschan, Lykien, ii, 216. 4 rIeP'a -PlOpOViKcV, 32. 5So apparently in India the Persian word for marriage (shadi) is used for both ceremonies (Hastings, Dict. of Religion, s.v. Circumcision, 678). For the performance of the operation by non-Musulmans, see the same article, p. 677. 6 Hastings (Dict. of Religion, s.v. Circumcision, p. 678) says " the exuviae seem generally to be burned or buried, sometimes in a mosque." At an imperial circumcision in 1582 the part amputated was presented in a golden box to the Queen Mother (de Vigenere, Illustr. sur Chal- condyle, 271, in de Mezeray's Hist. des Turcs, ii). In the seventeenth century the Turks burnt it (Aaron Hill, Account of Turkey, 47). Among Persians of the same date aut gallinis edendum dabatur aut a feminis sterilibus spe progeniei consumebatur (Raphael du Mans, Estat de Perse, ed. Schefer, 77). Scarlatos Byzantios in the middle of the last century, writes: "To a7TrorTA7Oev /b'pos avTreraT ?/ 01/oeraTt c. OvXaKrT)ptov EFrL T KfaX7K irt v -iro i rov veoTkiTov'" (KAwoTavLvo6vroXLs, iii, 485). Osman Bey states that the part amputated is presented to the parents on a plate, where they in return place the customary gifts (Les Imans et les Derviches, 121). The magic power of the part in question is thus proved: it might be used actively as a charm or merely put out of harm's way. The modern Turks in towns are said to be very careless in the matter, doubtless regarding the superstitions concerned as old wives' tales: hence possibly the scruples of the Yourouks, who are still punctilious in the matter.</page><page sequence="6">F. W. HASLUoK.-Heterodox Tribes of Asia Minor. 315 Turkish midwives in towns are exceedingly scrupulous that the placenta should be properly disposed of.' Some Cappadocian Greeks hide the umbilical cord of new-born children in a chink in the wall of church or school, which ensures that the child grows up devout or learned.2 It is natural to compare the similar superstitions about nail-parings and extracted teeth.3 When a Sunni preacher visits the Yourouk villages of Mount Ida during Ramazan, he is lodged in the best tent and royally entertained, but induced by a present of money to abstain from meddling with the Yourouks' ceremonies and from preaching and teaching.4 All this merely shows that the tribes in question are not Sunni. Little has been extracted from them as to the positive side of their religion. According to Dr. Chasseaud, the Yourouks have an initiation ceremony corresponding to circuincision at which he has himself been present, though he was unable to see what took place. Further, their holy places-called, as all over Turkey, dedes- are frequently trees or bushes, not remarkable to the outside observer, which they hang with rags; certain springs, also not outwardly remarkable, are held sacred. On two occasions Dr. Chasseaud, when in the company of Yourouks, was prevented by them from drawing water at such springs, though the tabu did not extend to the Yourouks themselves. A Yourouk mountain-cult with a festival on August 15th on the summit of Ida and vaguely connected with two giants (male and female), to whom small offerings of money are made, has come under my own observation.5 These hirnts, so far as they go, point to a primitive animistic religion slightly touched with anthropomorphism. The Lycian Yourouks (as opposed to the heretical Takhtadji) are regarded by both Bent6 and von Luschan7 as good Suniti Mahommedans: they have hodjas, the Koran, and circumcision, say their five prayers, eschew pork and wine, and make pilgrimage to Mecca. In villages they assimilate themselves to the settled I On the importance attached to the placenta in Egypt and elsewhere, see Seligmann in Man, 1911, 168, and in Ridgeway Essays, 451. For Turkey, cf. Abbott, Macedonian Folklore, 123. 2 Pharasopoulos, Ta lvXara, 41. 3 Frazer (Taboo and the Perils of the Soul, 267 ff.) shows that superstitious care in the disposal of nails and teeth is world-wide, the original idea being to prevent their malicious use by sorcerers, In Bosnia nail-parings are placed where contact with unclean things is not likely, in fountains, in the earth, or in a mosque (Wiss. Mitth. aus Bosnien, vii, 279). For the superstition in Asia Minor, see White, Trans. Vict. Inst., xxxix (1907), 159; de Bunsen, Soul of a Turk, 147; Aucher- Eloy, Voyages, 71 (hole in mosque wall at Angora used for extracted teeth and toothache so cured); in Macedonia, Abbott, Macedonian Folklore, 214; in Lesbos, Georgeakis et Pineau, Folk-Lore de Lesbos, 331. 4Hakikat, ap.

HASLUCK.-Heterodox Tribes of Asia Minor. population, though intermarriage is rare.' Sunni propaganda, as we have seen, exists among the Yourouks of Ida: it is said to have made great strides elsewhere, especially in the Konia vilayet.2 The Yourouks of Lycia are probably of com- paratively recent conversion. Of the Shia heresy there is little or no trace except among 'the confessedly "Kyzylbash " tribes,3 which we shall discuss at length4; we do not know whether Shia missionaries are at work among the pagan nomads. Nor are there any positive traces of Christianity, though the idea is widely, if vaguely, current. The evidence we have points to the conclusion that, except where they have been affected by Shit or Sunni propaganda, the Yourouk tribes are " primitive " in religion; further, that by race and speech they are largely Turkish, and may be regarded as still unsettled fragments of the nomad hordes which strayed into Asia Minor in the Middle Ages. The Turks, before they left their home in Central Asia, worshipped the sky-god (Ta-ri)5 and spirits of earth and water; they had no priestly casbe.6 That ancestor- worship developed early is clear from the present comprehensive use of dede (lit. "grandfather ") to describe any holy place7: gaining ground, possibly because more or less permitted in Islam, it seems to have been fused with the original elements of their religion, and especially with the cult of "high places," originally doubtless the places where the sky-god was worshipped, especially for rain.8 We consequently find that mountains in Turkey frequently bear human names, which are, or are said to be, those of saints. When these saints' names Von Luschan, Lykien, ii, 216. 2 Tsakyroglous, IIiep rlovpoV'Kcov, 35. 3 I here note the frequency of the name Haider among Yourouks, perhaps a link with the Kyzylbash. The Yourouks are said by the writer of the Hakikat article to drink wine, which is still negative evidence of Shiism, and to be visited yearly by an itinerant holy man (? from Syria), which is true of the Lycian Kyzylbash and may be merely a confusion. 4 Below, p. 32)7 ff. Some include the Tchepni in this category; see Oberhummer, Durch Kleinasien, 393. Wilson in J.R.G.S., 1884, 314, calls them Nosairi by religion. See also von Diest, Reisen und Forschungen, i, 27. 5On the word see Vambery, Prim. Kultur des Turko-Tatarischen Volkes, 240 ff. This seems to have been the current word for "God " in Turkish till quite a late date, cf. Schiltberger, ed. Hakluyt, 74, ed. Penzel, 149; Leunclavius, Pandectes, ? 177; Hammer-Hellert, Hist. Emp. Ott., iv, 64. It occurs frequently in the modern folk-tales collected by Kunos. 6 Eliot, Turkey in Europe, 79. The latter is still true of the nomads. The first Turkish ruler to embrace Islam is said to have been Satok Bogra, Khan of Turkestan, died 1048 (Grenard in Journ. Asiat., xv, 1900, 5 ff.). 7 Bent in Report British Assoc., 1889 (Newcastle), Sect. H, p. 3, says tribes of Azerbeijan (the district through which the Turks came into Asia Minor) are governed by hereditary chiefs, supposed to descend from a tribal holy man (pir): the grave of the pir is shown at the summer quarters of the tribe. For dede with the meaning of numen, cf. Ramsay, Pauline Studies, 172. 8 This custom is preserved among the Shia Turks (Kyzylbash) of Pontus (White in Trans. Vict. Inst. xxxix (1907), 154). They have also a festival at the summer solstice held'on mountain tops.</page><page sequence="8">F. W. HASLUCK.-Heterodox Tribes of Asia Minor. 317 are also those of tribes, it seems probable that they are regarded as the eponymous ancestors of tbe tribes concerned. In tribes still without a priestly caste the tribal chief is the natural person to invoke the sky-god on behalf of the tribe, and the eventual confusion between the sky-god who sends rain and the tribal chief whose prayers induce him to send it, is merely the confusion between deity and intercessor which is familiar enough in Christendom. The rainmaker-sheikh and the magician or dervish are hardly distinguishable, so that we are not surprised if Tour Hassan Veli, the saint of the HIassan Dagh in Cappadocia, and his tribesmen are said in folk-tales to have been dervishes,1 or if Ibn Batuta2 says of Baba Saltuk, the tribal saint of a group of Crimean Tartars, that he was " said to have been a diviner." Tour Hassan seems really an historical figure known by a lucky accident to have been a petty prince ruling part of Cappadocia about 1100 A.D.3 The name of his tribe survives in Tour iassanli, a village near Kirshehr, the word being formed, like the majority of tribal names in Tsakyroglous' list, by adding -1i to the name of the eponymous chief. Of Saltuk before he became involved in the Bektashi legend, we know less, but here again the tribal name Saltaklu seems to be preserved at a village near Baba Eski in Thrace and possibly in Asia Minor.4 The tribe of Mentesh, which eventually gave its name to the kaza of Moughla in Caria, can be traced by villages bearing its name from the Sivas district westward across Asia Minor. The eponym Mentesh figures in tradition5 as the brother of Hadji Bektalsh, who was himself before the usurpation of his tomb by the Houroufi sect,6 no more than a tribal ancestor. Bektashli is a fairly comimon village-name in the district round his tomb and occurs sporadically so far west as Cape Lectum.7 Not only Bektash himself but many of the " seven hundred dervishes " of his cycle, who came with him from Khorassan at the bidding of Khodja A.chmet of Yassi for the conversion of Roum,8 must have been tribal heroes of the same kind. This grouping round tribal leaders seems to be the basis of the early Turkish polity: the tribal tie was not always one of blood, since powerful tribes or leaders included under their own name less important allies. The tribe known from its leader as Osmanli was a political combination of this sort, and is said to have been Carnoy et Nicolaides, Trad. Pop.de l'Asie Mineure, 212 ff. 2 Tr.

A similar political grouping in recent times is that of the Shahsavand Kurds, which was formed artificially and purely for political reasons by Shah Abbas of Persia in the seventeenth century.2 Such probably was the grouping of tribes round the Seljouk dynasty, which succeeded in attaining to a considerable degree of material civilisation and political cohesion, dominating the greater part of Asia Minor. When the central power became weakened, however, the combination dis- integrated into smaller territorial units, resting probably on similar tribal groupings, which kept their names in some cases for many centuries.3 The province of Tekke (Adalia) is a notable instance. Tekke or Tekkeli is a " Yourouk " tribe in Asia Minor to this day4-the name occurs also in Central Asia-and the Tekke-oglou, descendants or reputed descendants of the tribal eponym, were still important derebeys in the Adalia district as late as the reforms of Mahmoud II.5 Down to the reforms and centralisation of the early nineteenth century the nomad tribes were allowed a great deal of liberty and were administered by their own beys,6 occasionally by strangers appointed from Constantinople.7 They seem to have been turbulent and easily excited to rebellion. Their risings were often fomented by sheikhs, probably Persian emissaries sent over the frontier to embarrass the Sultan. In the wooded mountains of Anatolia and in the steppe land of the central plateau, notably in the districts of Bozouk (Kirshehr) and Haimaneh, where the natural conditions-thin soil and lack of water-are against permanent settlement the Yourouks have been able to maintain themnselves in compact masses without abandoning their primitive social conditions: the mountaineers turn to wood- cutting and the men of the plains to herding. 1 Hammer-Hellert, Hist.

In 1564 the Venetian Relazioni (Alberi, ser.

Emp. Ott., ii, 288). The Yourouks of Roumeli in the eighteenth century supplied a contingent of 57,000 troops under their own leaders (Perry, View of the Levant, 48). 7A Circassian, Abaza Hassan, was appointed Voivode of the Anatolian Turcomans (see below, p. 324) in the seventeenth century (Hammer-Hellert, op. cit., x, 300).

W. llASLUCK.-Heterodox Tribes of Asia Minor. 319 Various attempts have been made to break up their solidarity and wean them to settled life, the first bv the importation of Kurds,' the second by the formation of town-centres. Many towns of the districts mentioned seeml to be of recent origin and artificial foundation. Ak Serai is a Seljouk foundation of 1171,2 Nevshehr was founded by Damad Ibra.him in 1720,3 and Yuzgat, the capital of the Tchapanoglou, dates from the eighteenth century.4 The two latter certainly are not spontaneous growths but artificial settlements.5 The more backward tribes are still nomadic in the restricted sense-that is, they have definite summer pasturages and fixed winter quarters, between which they alternate.6 The winter quarters tend gradually to become fixed villages, and despite the mutual antipathies of " Turk " and " Youirouk," some tribes are said to be absorbed by towns.7 But government pressure has not yet succeeded in weaning the Yourouks fronm their old life and their conversion to Islam is also incomplete. In view of all we have said, it would be surprising not to find among these heterogeneous tribes great diversity in physical type, as well as customs and religion, within the restrictions imposed on them by their manner of life, and future investigators will perhaps do best to consider the tribes known as " Yourouk " more as separate units than has been done hitherto. Their apparent and obvious simi- larities, such as the absence of mosques, relatively high status of women,8 and hospitality, are probably due to the habits of life shared by the whole group irrespective of race.

W. HASLUJCK.--Jleterodox Tribes of Asia Minor. ? 3. THE, TURCOMANS. The word Turkmen (Turcoman) seems properly applied to an important tribe of the Yourouk group. This tribe is widely distributed, being found in the districts of the Bithynian Olympus, Dineir, Konia, Sivas and even Cyprus.' Dr. Chasseaud considers that the term denotes a markedly Mongolian type and is synonymous with Tartar.2 The Tarkmens with whom he is acquainted are herdsmien by calling, not rich, and frequently serving others. This tallies with the account given by Burckhardt3 of the Turcomans he knew. He divides them into five main tribes, namely, the " Ryhanlu'" with thirteen sub- tribes, the " Jerid " with six sub-tribes, the " Pehluvanlu," the " Rishwans " with four sub-tribes, and the " Karashukli." Of these, the " Karashukli" are a mixed tribe of Turcomans and Arabs, living near Bir on the Euphrates. The Pehlivanli are the most numerous, while both the Djerid and the Rishwans are more numerous than the Rihanli, who have 3,000 tents, each containing two to fifteen inmates, and muster 2,510 horsemen all told. The Pehlivanli and the Rihanli are tributarv to the Tchapanoglou, the Djerid to the governors of Badjazze (Baias ?) and Adana, between which they live. The Rishwans also are now tributary to the Tchapanoglou, though formerly to the governor of Besna (Behesneh ?) near Aintab. The Pehlivanli drive sheep as far as Constantinople, and, their camels form almost exclusively the caravans of Smiyrna and the interior of Anatolia. The Rishwans are notorious liars. If Rihanli families dislike their chief, they join another tribe. Some of the Pehlivanli have long beein cultivators, but the Rihanli employfellahs to cultivate for them. But the word has for long had a wider signification, exactly corresponding to the ordinary use of the word Yourouk, i.e. it denotes nomiadic as opposed to settled Turks. The word is found with this meaning as early as Cinnanmus4 and is still so used bv the mlodern Turks.5 ITsakyroglous, op. cit., 11. 2 So Tsakyroglous, 34, von Luschan, J. R. Anthr.

THE KYZYLBASHT, TAKHTADJI, AND BEKTASHI. The word Kyzylbash (lit. "red-head") is said byall authorities to be of comparatively recent origin, dating only from the establishment of the Sefavi dynasty of Persia by the Shah Ismail in 1499.4 "Kyzylbash " was originally a nickname given to the new Shah's supporters on account of their having adopted as a distinguishing mark These speak a language of their own (Burckhardt, op. cit, 642). 2 Cf. Grothe's Tedjerli, above, p. 323. 3 A comparison with the list of the Turcomans of Luristan as given by Rawlinson (in J.R.G.S., ix, 1839, 103) is also of interest. He enumerates them as follows:-Ulaki and Mal Ahmedi, with 400 families, wintering at Sar Dasht and Dizful, summering at Japalak and Silakhir: Bukhtiyariwand with 600 families and the same habitat as the above: Duraki with 4,000 famnilies,' summering at Chahar Mahal and wintering as above: Sallaki with 2,000 families, summering at Burburud: Kunursi with 1,000 families, summering at Feridun and about Zardah Kuh, wintering at Ram Hormuz, Janniki-Garmasir, and about Schuster: Suhuni with 1,500 families, habitat as Kunursi: Mahmud Saleh with 1,000 families and same habitat: Mogui with 500 families, 'Mfemiwand with 4,000, and Zallaki with 4,000, all with habitat as Kunursi: Ba vai with 3,000 families, Urak and Shaluh combined with 2,500 families, summering at Bazuft and wintering at Susan and Mal Amir. 4 Hammer-Hellert, Hist.

The Persian change of dynasty brought with it a change in the official religion, since the preceding monarchs had been of Turkish origin and Sunni, whereas Shah Ismail adhered to the Shia doctrines of his father. The name " Kyzylbash," therefore, is associated from the first both with Persian nationality and Persian (Shia) religion, bqlt has no ethnological significance whatever. In modern popular Turkish, owing to the long enmity between the two nations and the two religions, and to the suspicion and dislike with which the Turks regard the "Kyzylbash" of their own country, the word is used merely to designate a persor of loose morals.2 As regards Anatolia, "Kyzylbash. is a contemptuous term used to denote the adherents of all sects of the Shia religion, including, e.g., the Nosairi and Yezidi, irrespective of race or language: the corresponding inoffensive term, by which the Anatolian Kyzylbash designate themselves, is Allevi (" worshippers of Ali "). Both terms include the Shia tribes of Northern Asia Minor, who are said to be Iranian Turks3 and speak Turkish, and the so-called " Western Kurds," whose speech is a distinct dialect (" Zaza ") of Kurdish or Turkish, and whose race is generally thought to contain a strong admixture of Armenian blood. This opinion, based not only on the physical characteristics of the tribes concerned b'ut on tradition of various kinds, is of some inmportance as bearing on the question of the Christian element in the Kyzylbash religion: we shall return to it later. In the West of Asia Minor the " Kyzylbash " are found only sporadically. In the Smyrna vilayet they, are numerous in the sandjak of Tekke (Lycia), where they are called " Takhtadji,"4 and are reported by Tsakyroglous to inhabit certain valleys of the Hermus5 and Maeander,6 where they are nomadic or semi-nomadic.7 The Kyzylbash of Kaz Dagh (probably Ida, which other considerations point out as a Kyzylbash district) are mentioned by Cantemir,8 and Oberhummer found Kyzylbash villages in the neighbourhood of Afioun-Kara-Hissar,9 which forms a link on the main highway between the Eastern and Western groups. As to the Eastern group of Kyzylbash, they are known. to inhabit certain parts of the vilayet of Angora,10 and are admitted even by Turkish statistics to be numerous 'P. della Valle, Viagg (Rome, 1658), ii, 46-7. Similarly, dervish is used of a person lax in the performance of his religious duties or suspected of free thought. 3 Vamb6ry, Turkenvolk, 607. 4See below, p. 329. 5 On the slopes of Mounts Tmolus and Sipylus and in the districtis of Nymphi and Salili. 6 At Denizli and Apa. 7 f1Ep' VLOVpOVKov, 29. 8 Hist. . . .

HASLUCK.-Heterodox Tribes of Asia Minor. 329 in those of Sivas (279,834),1 Diarbekir (6,OO0),2 and Kharput (182,580).3 In the case of the Sivas vilayet the official figures represent them as exactly half as numerous as the Sunni Moslems, not only in the vilayet as a whole but in every kaza composing it. The inference is that they are in reality much more numerous than the goverrn- ment is willing to admit. Grenard, the only writer who has treated the Eastern Kyzylbash area as a connected whole, estimates the total number of the sect as upwards of a million.4 Of these, he places 365,000 in the vilayet of Sivas (kazas of Sivas, Divrigi, Tonous, Yildizili, Hafik, Zileh, Medjid Euzu, Hadji Keui), 300,000 in that of Kharput, and 107,000 in that of Erzeroum (sandjalk^ of Erzingian, especially kazas of Baiburt, Terdjian, and part of Kighi). It is thus in the "Armenian " vilayets that the "Kyzylbash " are strongest. The great importance of Grenard's statistics consists in the fact that they clearly show the close geographical contact of the Kyzylbash communities of Western Kurdistan with those of Eastern Anatolia. We may probably assume that the Eastern Anatolian Kyzylbash are similarly connected with the more scattered communities of Western Anatolia. The Kyzylbash religion, if we make allowances for variation due to locality and to the natural in-telligence, candour and knowledge of different informants, is sihmilarly homogeneous, though fluid; there are indications that the whole sect is linked together by its alliance with the Bektashi dervishes. Thus, in Cilicia the woodcutter (Takhtadji) caste has embraced a form of the Shia faith and would be reckoned bv the Turks as Kyzylbash: some have identified their religion with that of the Syrian Nosairi.5 In the province of Tekke (Lycia) the Kyzylbash are generally known as Takhtadji (" woodcutters ") on account of their employment, but like the Kyzylbash elsewhere, they call themselves Allevi6 and are connected with the Bektashi order of dervishes,7 whose local centre is at 1 Cuinet, Turquie d'Asie, i, 617; for further information on the Kyzylbash of this vilayet see van Lennep, Travels in Asia Minor, i, 30 (cf.

The Lycian Takhtadji are said to owe their conversion to Shia Islam to the missionary activity in the fourteenth century of sheikhs from Konia.1 Side by side with the Lycian Takhtadji von Luschan fQund traces of what appeared to be a second heterodox sect, the Bektashi.2 Similarly, Crowfoot, finding that the Kyzylbash of the Halys district (vila.yet of Angora) hailed each other as "Bektash," suspected that this was the name of a local sect of Kyzylbash.3 The real explanation of the apparent second sect or subdivision lies in the close association of many Kyzylbash with the Bektashi order of dervishes. Lycia has long been a field of Bektashi propaganda, and the Kyzylbash villages of the Halys are aot far from the central sanctuary of the Bektashi, near Kirshehr,4 which contains the tomb of their titular founder, Hadji Bektash, and is visited as a pilgrimage even by the distant Kyzylbash Kurds.5 The Bektashi-Kyzylbash of Lycia are probably Kyzylbash who have become affiliated as lay adherents (milhib) of the Bektashi order of dervishes. As to the " Bektash " of the Halys district, which are nearer the Bektashi centre, they may either be inhabitants of villages forming part of the endowments (vackouf) of the tekke of Hadji Bektash, or, if (as I have suggested elsewhere)6 " Hadji Bektash " himself represents the original tribal-chief and medicine-man eponymous of a tribe Bektashli, they may be a portion of this tribe. Kyzylbash, in the Turkish sense at least, are to be reckoned the inhabitants of certain heterodox villages in the Hermus valley, regarding the population of which Ramsay gleaned the following details. Like the nomads, thev do not conform to orthodox Mahommedan custom in the details of veiling women, polygamy, abstention from wine, and worship in mosques. They fast twelve days in spring, their women are called by Christian names, they have no aversion to Christian holy books, and are visited by an itinerant holy man called a Karabash7 (Tk. " black head "). It happens that, among the Yezidi of Syria (Jebel Siman),8 there is a tribe possessing a kind of Levitical status and called Karabash.9 The Yezidi religion is, of course, known to contain Christian elements, and the Yezidi view of Christianity and the Bible is somewhat simrilar to that of the Kyzylbash. It would thus appear 1 Von Hammer, Hist. Emp. Ott., iv, 91 (from the sixteenth century Turkish historian Djenabi). 2 Von Luschan, Lykien, ii, 203, note. 3 J. R. Anthr. Inst., xxx (1900), 305; cf.

HASLUcK.-Heterodox Tribes of Asia Minor. that the heterodox villages of the Hermus valley are connected with the Yezidi, which implies that they were converted or colonised from Syria. But it will be observed that the whole argument depends on the word " Karabash," which is ambiguous, having been applied, till recently, to Christian monks and priests' (as wearing black caps) in general. It is safer to suppose for the present that the story is a garbled version of an annual visitation of Kyzylbash villages, which are known to exist in this district,2 by Bektashi sheikhs. The following is a summary of the information at our disposal on the religion of the Kyzylbash, compiled from several sources and referring chiefly to the Kyzylbash of the Kurdish and Armenian vilayets. It will be found that, although we have little exact information on the religion of the Lycian Takhtadji, what we have .confirms the idea of their close religious connection with the Kyzylbash further East. I. Theology. God is one and omnipotent, without son or companion.3 Ali is God incarnate, identical with Christ, and will appear again.4 Ali is identical with Christ and is the spirit of God. "Ali is the best of men, excelling even Mohammed in goodness; if Ali had not existed, God could not have created the world, but Ali is emphatically not divine."5 Ali is identical with Christ, but the Kyzylbash call him Ali to deceive the Turks.6 The Kyzylbash Trinity is perhaps Ali, Jesus anid Mahommed (Father, Son and Holy Spirit respectively), but the intrusion of Mahommed, for whom they have no reverence, is to be suspected.7 Their prayers are directed chiefly to Allah, Ali and Hussein.8 The Devil is a person and is re-incarnated to oppose each incarnation of God: he is not worshipped.9 Intermediaries are the five archangels, twelve ministers of God, and forty prophets, including Selman. The prophet Khidr is identified with S. Sergius.10 1 Cf. 0. F. von Richter, Wallfahrten, 333; Fallmerayer, Fragmente, 125; also Schiltberger, Reise, ed. Penzel, 149, ed. Hakluyt, 74.

The twelfth Imam is in hiding and the Kyzylbash await his coming.2 The great prophets are Jesus, Mohammed, Moses, Abraham and Ali.3 The great prophets are Adam, Moses, David and Jesus.4 The great prophets are Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Christ, Mahommed and Ali.5 Moses, David, Christ and Ali are all incarnations of the same person.6 Jesus is the greatest of the prophets.7 The Virgin is regarded as the Mother of God and much venerated.8 II. Mythology. When the Mahommedans of Damascus killed IHussein, the son of Ali, they cut off his head and carried it away. It was stolen from them by an Armenian priest, Akh Mrtouza Keshish, who substituted for it the head of his eldest son, at the proposal of the latter. As the Turks discovered the fraud, the priest cut off the heads of all his seven sons and offered each in turn as the head of Hussein. In the case of the last head he received a divine warning to smear it with the blood of Hussein and by this nmeans deceived the "Turks and kept the holy relic for himself.9 He placed it in a special apartment, which he adorned with gold and silver and silk. His only daughter, entering that apartment one day, saw not the head of Hussein but a plate of gold filled with honey. She tasted the honey and became with child. "One day the girl complained of a cold, and on sneezing her father saw suddenly issue from her nose a bright flame, which changed at the same instant into the form of a child. Thus did Imam Bakir, son of Hussein, come into the world." Molyneux-Seel, 66. 2 Sykes, 122. 3 Sykes, 121. 4 Ellsworth Huntington in Geog.

A variation is related by White from the Cappadocian Kyzylbash country (Contemp. Review, Nov. 1913, 698) as follows:-" There is a story that when the great Ali was put to death by his enemies, his head by some chance was placed for safe keeping in the hands of a Christian priest. Afterwards the persecutors wanted it to gloat over it or abuse it, but the priest refused to deliver it up. On being pressed, he cut off the head of his eldest son and offered that instead, but it was refused. So he did with his second and other sons, to the number of seven. Then his wife asked her husband to cut off and offer her head. He did so, and this was accepted."</page><page sequence="25">334 F. W. HASLUCK.-Heterodox Tribes of Asia Minor. " The fact that a descendant of Ali had been born immediately became known to the sorcerers of the Turks, who thereupon sent people to search for the child and slay it. They came to the priest's house. At this time the young mother was engaged in washing the household linen, and, being told the reason of the visit of the Turks, hastily put her child into a copper cauldron which was on the fire and covered him with linen. The Turks knew by their magic arts that the child was in a house of copper, but unable to find any such house in the precincts of the priest's dwelling were baffled, and the child's life was saved. On account of this incident the child received the name of Bakir, which in Turkish means copper."' Ali as a child went to Khoubyar and was put into a furnace for seven days as his enemies wished to kill kim.2 III. Hierarchy. The priests are called Dede; above them are bishops and patriarchs. Of the latter there are two, one of whom resides in a tekke at Khoubyar, fifty-five kilo- metres North-East of Sivas. The patriarchs are descendants of Ali and infallible in doctrine.3 The religious head of the Kyzylbash resides in the Dersim.4 Priests are called Seid; above them are bishops (Murshud) and archbishops (Murshudun Murshudu). Seids give religious instruction and receive tribute.5 The Kyzylbash are visited once a year, but at no fixed time, by a murshud, who holds a service, recites the law, and gives definite readings and interpretations of the sacred books. If he pays a second visit in the year he holds no religious conversation.6 Priests are allowed to marry, but celibates enjoy greater prestige.7 Once or twice a year everv village is visited by a dede, a kind of communion takes place, as also preaching, prayers, and a religious dance in which both sexes participate.8 The hierarchy is composed of Deydees and Seyds; the latter are hereditary, the formier apostolically consecrated.9 Peripatetic dedes are mentioned by (irothe.10 1 Molyneux-Seel, 65. 2 Grenard, 518. 3 Ibid. 4Oberhummer and Zimmerer, Durch Syrien und Kleinasien, 394. 5 Molyneux-Seel, 64. 6 Ibid., 66. 7Prof. White in Trans.

HASLUCK.-Heterodox Tribes of Asia Minor. 335 Among the Lycian Takhtadji every tribe, however small, has a Baba or Dede, whose office is hereditary.' IV. Fasts and Feasts and Public Worship. The twelve days' fast and feast of Mohurrem is observed.2 They fast twelve days for the twelve Imams and three days for Khidr.3 They fast before Khidr's feast (February 9th) and at the Armenian Easter.4 " On the night of January 1st (O.S.)5 they meet at the house of the Seids for a ceremony resembling the Communion. After prayers the Seid blesses the bread, which is called Haqq loqmase,6 and distributes it to the communicants, who approach two by two. The blessed bread is not distributed to any person who may be declared by the inhabitants of his village to be unworthy. The communicants are called Musseib."7 The Kyzylbash have neither mosque nor church, but both sexes meet for prayer at the house of the Seid on Fridays.8 They have a perverted mass: the priest chants prayers in honour of Christ, Moses and David. Water is consecrated by the priest dipping a stick into it. There is a public confession of sins, which are punished by fines: lights are put out while the congregation mourns its sins.9 When they are re-lighted, the priest gives absolution,10 and, having blessed bread and wine, gives a sop to the congre- gation. Morsels (loqma) of the flesh of a sacrificed lamb are given at the same time. Known evil livers are not admitted to the service.11 As to the consecrating of water the following is informing:-" All the Seids keep with them a certain stick and a leather bag, about the uses of which there is some mystery, and which are said to be employed in the performance of certain pagan rites. However, the Seids say that the stick is a portion of the rod of Moses, and the bag an imitation of that carried by St. John the Baptist."'12 IVon Luschan, ii, 201. 2 Grenard, 514; Sykes, 122. 3 Molyneux-Seel, 66. 4Grenard, 518. 5 This is one of the days on which the Nosairi celebrate their communion, the others being Christmas, Epiphany and the Persian New Year (Nevrouz).

Grothe, ii, 155. 10 Confession and absolution ceremonies exist also among the Lycian Takhtadji (von Luschan, ii, 202). 11 Grenard, 517. A " sort of sacrament " is reported of the Eastern Kyzylbash by Huntington (loc. cit., p. 188), a communion of bread and wine by White (Contemp. Review, Nov. 1913, 696). 12 Molyneux-Seel, 66.</page><page sequence="27">336 F. W. HASLUCK.-Heterodox Tribes of Asia M11inor. V. Private Prayer. Private prayer is enjoined once a day. This prayer is secret, but contains reference to all the great prophets.' They pray privately every morning.2 They never pray in private.3 They adore the sun rising and setting,4 reverence fire, and sacrifice at the sources of rivers, in particular that of the Mezoor.5 VI. Sacred Books. The Kvzylbash have no sacred books, but recognise as inspired the Pentateuch, the- New Testament, and the Koran.6 They admit the five collections of Traditions, but do not recognise Jews or fire-worshippers as " People of the Book."7 They have four holy books, which are the Gospels.8 They have two books, the Bouyourouk,9 which contains selections from the Old Testament, and the Yuseff Kitab,'? which conltains extracts from the New Testament." They have a book, which is only in the possession of the priesthood, hiut it does not seem to be a corpus of dogma.'2 The Lycian Takhtadji claimri to have a book.'3 VII. Pilgrinage. The Kyzylbash do not make pilgrimage to Mecca but to the Shia sanctuaries of Bagdad, Kufa and Kerbela, and to certain Anatolian holy places, the most 'Sykes, 121. 2Molyneux-Seel, 66. 3 Huntington, 187. 4 Cf. the similar custom of the Yezidi, mentioned by W. B. Heard in J. R. Anthr. Inst., xli (1911), 213. 5 Taylor, J.R.G.S., xxxviii (1868), 320. A local legend connects the source of the Mezoo, with a shepherd saint of the same name, who is said to have disappeared there (Molyneux-Seel loc. cit., 60). It is probably a nature cult anthropomorphised. 6 Molyneux-Seel, 66. Van Lennep says vaguely that they read the Christian scriptiures (Travels in Asia Minor, 30 ff.). 7Sykes, 122. 8 Huntington, 187. This author recognises that the Kyzylbash, when questioned as to their religion by Christians, colour their answers to make its analogies to Christianity closer. This seems to be an extreme case. 9 [ Book of Commandments" from bouyoarmaq to command.-M.M.H.] n [ Joseph's book."-M.M.H.] 11 Dunmore in Amer. Miss. Her., liii (1857), 220.

HASLUoK.-Heterodox Tribes of Asia Minor. 337 important being Hadji Bektash (near Kirshehr), the centre of the Bektashi der. vishes, and a reputed tomb of Hassan at Sivas.1 IX. Marriage. The Kyzylbash may marry three wives; divorce and temporary marriage are prohibited. An unfaithful wife may be killed.2 Divorce is prohibited. Armenians are accepted as parrains at marriages.3 Divorce is prohibited.4 Strictly the Kyzylbash are only permiitted to take one wife, but many have lapsed into polygamy. The peripatetic dede presides at marriages when possible.5 Prostitution of virgins to guests, and especially to itinerent dedes, is recorded, on the authority of a bigoted Sunni, by Grothe.6 Among the Lycian Takhtadji marriage between brother and sister is per- mitted.7 It is fairly apparent that the predominating element in the Kyzylbash religion is Shia Mahommedanism, and the secondary Christian, the whole having a sub- stratum of pagan animistic elements,8 many of which might be found in slightly changed form among professedly orthodox Turks or oriental Christians. On the Shia side note the, exalted position held by Ali, Hassan and Hussein, and the importance of their pilgrimages, as compared with the neglect of Mahommed and Mecca: note also the importance of the Imams and the Second Advent. The Christian elements, apart from the formal identification of Shia with Christian sacred figures, reduce themselves to the celebration of certain Armenian feasts, and the ritual of the "perverted mass." It should be noted that the "ritual meal " is an idea by no means foreign to Islam,9 the Semitic element being, as in Christianity, partly responsible. Nor -must it be overlooked that one of the prototypes of the Christian communion is found in Persian Mithraism. As regards the hierarchy it seems clear that the parish priest, who is, generally called Seyid by our authorities, is normally married, his office being, hereditary, and he himself, as his name implies, a descendant of the Prophet and therefore of 1 Molyneux-Seel, 66. This is presumably the tomb of the Holy Children (Maksoum Pak), discovered in recent times in the town of Sivas. The Holy Children are not Hassan and Hussein but the infant sons of two of the Imams: the confusion in popular thought is natural (see F. W. Hasluck in B.S.A., xxi, 1914-16, pp. 95-6 and 96, n. 1). 2 Sykes, 121. 3 Grenard, 518, 521. 4Taylor, 319. 5 Grothe, ii, 154. 6 Vorderasienexpedition, ii, 150. 7Von Luschan, Lykien, ii, 199. 8 Grenard, loc. cit., brings this out in detail. 9 G.

A celibate monk can, however, as in oriental Christianity, officiate, if in orders, as parish priest. The peripatetic " bishop " or murshud' seems to be a (celibate ?) dervish of the Bektashi order. On this point Tsakyroglous, speaking of the Kyzylbash in general but probably more particularly of those in his own vilayet of Aidin, is very explicit. He says that the communities are visited yearly by Bektashi sheikhs, wlho confess, catechise and instruct their flocks.2 Professor White, speaking of Pontus, says that the Kyzylbash villages there are organised in groups, each group having its tekke of dervishes.3 The " patriarchs," of whomi one resides at Khoubyar (the other is probably the " Tchelebi " of the Bektashi4) are again hereditary (the " Tchelebi " certainly), their descent being important. The doubling of the office reminds us of the Arnmenian and Greek churches. Certain points in the Kyzylbash system, mostly negative, sever them from, and form a stumbling-block to, their Sunni neighbours. Thus, they do not conform to Sunni practice in the matter of veiling women, the five prayers, circumcision and other religious duties; they are said to eat pork and drink wine. to marry, within the prohibited degrees, and to indulge in immoral orgies, men and women being assembled in a great room in which the lights are suddenly extinguished. This is evidently a prejudiced version of the " perverted mass " ceremony described above. Impartial investigators have found that, while marriage between brother and sister is countenanced by them,6 they are very strict about divorce and monogamy, and the grave charge of promiscuity, which has been much exploited by (chiefly ignorant), Sunni partisans, and has earned for the Kyzylbash the opprobrious nicknames of Zerati and Moumsounderen (" candle-extinguishers "6), is generally thought to be a calumnny. The same charges of incest and promiscuity are brought against the Druses by Benjamin of Tudela in the twelfth century,7 and the latter in modern times by I The word is in general use amongst dervishes for a " spiritual director"; every sheikh of a convent, for instance, is a murshudl in relation to his pupils (chaguirt). 2 Jlep'L IOVpOVKcov, 30 :-'EK T3S /WVqS TIvT (sc. rov XarCi BE'Krar) E4EpXOVraL ET7)O-O LS d rEpLot3ELaV 2ELXCU ErLCTKE7TO/ EVOL Ta KCaS KaL Ta XCPLa ev4a vrapXovOl KOLVOT7TES TOVW E6O/uOXOyOvcZLv avTrov, KaTT)XOVOYL KaL 7ro017yETOVcTLV aVroV eLf r4v Ww6 rif adXrjOeiasV KaL EXovTE ovva/lAa 8IKaoT7Kq)V OvTCOS EL73ELV 8&amp;KaLO8O0LaV EO,oaXVVOoviTL 8Q)VE'6ELf Ka't 8ac/opas 4LcWra/.Levas, /Iea4 7O.V KOLVOT)TWOV, OVTrO EP TEVEL 7 aMv3aVOTLV 7Trap avrToV KaL TO frT)OLWV WPLo-AeVOv 7vdpcOv. 3 Trans.

HASLUCK.--Heterodox Tribes of Asia Minor. 339 the Arabs against the fire-worshippers' as by the " Old " Turks against the Crypto- Jews of Salonica.2 The truth seems to be that the Turks are extremely strict about the degrees of consanguinity,3 and that some Kyzylbash infringe their rules. As a matter of fact, as we have seen above, the marriage laws of the Dersim Kyzylbash at least are in some respects much stricter than those of orthodox Islam. For the rest, Kyzylbash laxity in the veiling of women and the fact that the sexes uhite in an act of worship, of which no more is known than that it is unorthodox, are sufficient basis for a wholesale slander. A certain amount of official pressure is exerted to convert the Kyzylbash to the orthodox faith of Islam. To them, as to the Yourouks of Ida, Sunni missionaries are sent to preach during the month of Ramazan, and mosques are occasionally built in their villages by government orders.4 The Pontic Kyzylbash, according to Professor White, are to some extent organised against government aggression. Some years ago, it is said, a rumour became current that the documents of the Kyzylbash religious foundations (vakoufs) were required at Constantinople: the leaders of the sect warned their communities to be ready to resist, and no steps were taken by the governmnent.5 As regards the connection between Christianity and the religion of the Kyzylbash the latter claim that there is very little difference between the two faiths ;6 they are certainly in their personal relations more sympathetic to Christians than to Sutnni Mahoniniedans. An aga of Kyzylbash Kurds was actually converted to Christianity by American missionaries in the fifties.7 An obvious link between the two religions is the fact that both are regarded as inferiors, socially and politically, by the dominant Sunni religion. Further, we have found that the Kyzylbash celebrate certain Armenian feasts and are thickest in the " Armenian" vilayets. A number of traditions also connect the two. Thus, the Kurdish, and probably also the Anatolian, Kyzylbash represent their Imam as 1 Jerphanion in Mellanyes de la Faculte Orientale (Beyrout), ii, 405. 2 Meheroutiette (an organ of the Turkish Liberal party), 1914, p. 16. The same is alleged of the Russian Tatarinof sect (see A. Dumas, Russie): one of their number confessed this, but under torture. Early Christian heretics were accused by the orthodox of the same crime (Strack, Blutaberylaube, 71); pagans said the same of Christians (Kortholt, De Calumniis Paganorum, Kiel, 1668). Thevenot records that the vagabond Hhoiiames of Egypt practised promiscuity (Voyages, ii, 852), but any mixed gathering was liable to the suspicion: cf. the accounts of the Easter Fire ceremony at Jerusalem in d'Arvieux, Memoires, ii, 142; Faber, Evagat. ed. Hassler, ii, 92; Maundrell, Travels, ed. Wright, 182. Cf. also what Lucius says of the festivals of martyrs in early times (Anfange des Heiligenkults, 319-23). In the case of Jerusalem there is also an idea that a child begotten in such circumstances and surroundings is particularly fortunate (Tobler, Bethlehem, 75, 139; Tobler, Golgatha, 427). 3 Cf. Le Bruyn, Voyage au Levant, i, 405. 4White in Trans. Vict.

The Armenians on their side claim the Kyzylbash Kurds as perverted co-religionists.2 Other examples of traditions recording the conversion of Armenians en bloc to Islam are to be found in the cases (1) of a tribe classed as Turcoman and called Pehlivanli, settled between Sivas and Angora3 (a "Kyzylbash " country, be it remarked), and (2) of the Mahalemi " Kurds," who are said to have been coniverted two hundred years ago."4 According to Mrs. Scott-Stevenson the (Sunni) Afshars5 of the Anti-Taurus claim Armenian descent,6 which, though probably false of the Afshars as a whole, may still be true of some sections of the tribe. Tchihatchefl's picture of Pharasa (a Greek village of the Anti-Taurus) in the fifties, ruled by Afshar chiefs and taking part with them in their forays against the Turks,7 may show a phase in such a develop- ment.8 As regards the Kyzylbash, it is important to note that all traditions speak of them as converted Armenians, not Greeks. It must not, however, be imagined that the question of the " Kyzylbash" religion is finally disposed of by classing it as Shia, since the Shia religion is sub- divided into numerous sects and heresies. Sir Charles Wilson compares the religion of the Anatolian Kyzylbash, not with that of orthodox Persian Shias, but rather 1 Above, p. 333. 2 Molyneux-Seel in Geog. Journ., xliv (1914), 64-7: cf. Huntington in Geog. Journ., xx (1902), 186. 3 Niebuhr (who had it from Patrick Russell of Aleppo), Voyage en Arabie (Amsterdam, 1780), ii, 341. 4 Sir Mark Sykes in Geog. Journ., xxx (1907), 387. Both these and the Pehlivanli (Niebuhr, Voy. en Arabie, ii, 341) are said to have turned Musulman on account of the severity of Armenian fasts. The motif is a " stock " one (cf. Pococke, Descr. of the East, ii, 133; G. Kammas, MtKpacr'. 'HuepoX, 1915, p. 281), but the conversion may nevertheless be a fact: on the other hand it may be merely a reflection on the character of the tribes in question, put into currency by rivals or enemies. The Maronite villages are said to convert regularly to Protestantism when oppressed by their priests: when this pressure has gained them their point, they as regularly revert to Catholicism (Mrs. Mackintosh, Damascus, 286). If it were as easy and safe to revert from Islam as from Protestantism, we should doubtless find fewer Moslems in Turkey at the present day: cf. the cases of the Presba villages (Berard, Macedoine, 20), of the Karamuratadhes (Pouqueville, Voyage dans la Gre'ce, i, 259-61), and of the Valachadhes (Berard, Macedoine, 110; Wace and Thompson, Nomads of the Balkans, 29). 5 For the Afshars see Grothe, Vorderasienexpedition, ii, 135 ff. 6 Our Ride through Asia Minor, 218. Others have called them renegade Greeks (Tsakyroglous, riept rLtovpot'KWV, 13). 7 Tschihatscheff's Reisen in Kleinasien, ed. Kiepert, 14. We may compare the conditions noticed in the early'years of the nineteenth century by Burckhardt in the Cilician plain (Barker, Lares and Penates, 355 ff.). Here the Greek villages were subjected to Turcoman chiefs and had largely assimilated themselves to their protectors. 8 The recent (" fifty years ago," i.e. about 1830) conversion of Burunguz, an Armenian village near Tomarza, in the district of Caesarea, noted by J. F. Skene (Anadol, 175), is worth putting on record in this connection: both period and locality point to the Afshars as the " missionaries " responsible for the change.</page><page sequence="32">F. W. HASLUCK.-Heterodox Tribes of Asia Minor. 341 with that of the Nosairi of Syrial. Bent, speaking of the Takhtadji in particular, classes their religion with that of the Nosairi and Yezidi,2 and von Luschan3 and Oberhummer4 are of the same opinion. It cannot be expected that the religion practised by these scattered and possibly heterogeneous communities is identical. But in the present vague state of our knowledge it would be worse than useless to attempt a more exact classification. It is at least fairly clear that the Kyzylbash religion from Mardin and Erzeroum to Smyrna is identical in its main lines and an offshoot of Shia Islam containing considerable elements of Chriatianity, with an animistic basis, according to Grenard's information, and that the Bektashi, the only dervish order in Turkey openly professing the Shia faith, form a sort of hierarchy among a large proportion of the Kyzylbash populations. The inherence of the Bektashi, whatever its origin, is explained by the fiction that the tribal saints of the various Kyzylbash villages were " brothers," " companions " or " disciples " of Hadji Bektash.5 Von Luschan has already established the important point6 that the similarities of religion between the " Kyzylbash " group (including " Bektash " and " Takh- tadji ") in Anatolia coincide with anthropological similarities which connect this group also with the North Syrian and North Mesopotamian heterodox sects (Yezidi, Nosairi, etc.), with the Armenians, with certain types of Anatolian Greek, and with the Hittites. The locality in which this anthropological type is most frequent is the moun- tainous " bridge-land " which lies between the fertile countries of Anatolia, Persia, Mesopotamia and Syria. This " bridge-land " has never been civilized, though it has been penetrated at various times by missionaries, religious, political and military: in particular, being the old border-land between Turkey and Persia, it was naturally the resort of Persian emissaries during the long wars of the two nations. The result of the presumed religious propaganda carried on from the side of Persia among still pagan nomads, Kurdish and Turkish, possibly also among Armenian Christians,7 is a patchwork of religious compromises, of which the outwardly predominating elements are Shia Islam and Armenian Christianity, among a people of marked physical homogeneity. A certain proportion of these peoples has migrated westwards, as probably in other directions, either from natural causes or under the pressure of the artificial transplantation, which was carried out in the sixteenth century by the Ottoman 1 Geog.

The emigration process may have gone on for centuries, the emigrants from the mountainous " bridge- land ",sometimes amalgamating with the men of the plains under the influence of a prevalent civilisation, sometimes keeping themselves aloof owing to religious or other differences. The " bridge-land " type, when found in the west, may thus represent immigrations of widely different date, ranging from remote antiquity to comparatively modern times. I Cf.
