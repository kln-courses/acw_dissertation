<plain_text><page sequence="1">PROFESSOR KNIGHT ON PSYCHOLOGY PROFESSOR KNIGHT in two penetrating and vigorous articles I has recently set forth the view that economics is, or at any rate ought to be, more than a branch of mere science a part of what he calls ethics and esthe- tics as well. In taking this view he finds himself in op- position to much of modern scientific psychology, but he centers his attack on one school of psychologists - the behaviorists. In so doing he achieves a rare distinc- tion by beginning one of his articles with an admirably fair formulation of certain aspects of the position he is attacking - a formulation that many of his opponents (including the present writer) could accept with rela- tively slight amendment. The conclusions of these two papers may be con- veniently grouped as follows: (1) It is part of the task of the social sciences to concern themselves with human purposes, and to appraise our economic system. That system not only satisfies wants but in large measure also determines their survival and evolution; it should be judged, therefore, both as a satisfier and as a determiner of wants. (2) The applicability of scientific method is limited; we can never know values scientifically, tho we may know in this way the objective facts of exchange; in order to understand values as such, we must employ a "higher" process of the human mind than scientific method. With the first set of conclusions and their im- 1.

On the contrary there is pleasure in record- ing hearty agreement. No doubt these conclusions fol- low logically from Professor Knight's position. The present writer holds that they follow equally from the position he is criticizing. But for brevity's sake he will not undertake to prove this proposition here. The quar- rel is with the second set of conclusions. Without that disrespect to philosophy in general which Professor Knight so much deplores, one may fairly call in question the particular philosophical posi- tion through which he seeks to delimit the scope of scientific method in dealing with human affairs, espe- cially when he tells us that science is further from com- mon sense than his own abstract and avowedly specula- tive philosophy.2 Still more may one question Professor Knight's findings without disrespect to philosophers when he calls on them to arbitrate an alleged conflict between reason and common sense.3 As if philosophers, were agreed upon this issue of the conflict between rea- son and common sense, if indeed there is a conflict here except as seen from a particular philosophical position such as Professor Knight's! The argument by which Professor Knight claims to have demonstrated the limited applicability of scien- tific methods in dealing with men, and more especially with values, may be called a process of elimination. Apparently he holds, somewhat after the manner of Bergson, that there are two methods of knowing, the scientific, and what we shall call the ethical-esthetic. The scientific method according to Professor Knight includes objective observation, which furnishes the data that science classifies and analyzes. In its classifica- 2. Q. J. E., p. 378. 3. Q. J. E., p. 377.</page><page sequence="3">136 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS tion and analysis of these data science employs " static categories (that is, presumably, terms the meanings of which do not change in the course of the discussion) and exact reasoning; but it is confined to these data of ob- servation and excludes matters of inference. Its ulti- mate test (and possibly he means that of the other sort of knowledge too) is intelligent communicability. The ethical-esthetic "apparatus of thought and communica- tion" is not very fully described.4 It is "higher," and this sort of knowledge is less exact and more "imme- diate" (apparently as distinguished from "inferred"). As contrasted with the scientific or " outside" method of knowing, it is knowing "from the inside . . . by iden- tifying ourselves in a real sense with the object of know- ledge." Professor Knight finds that desire and choice are (like other "conscious states") matters of inference for science. They are not objectively observable, not scientific data, except in a sense which makes the he- donistic analysis purely a tautology.5 Furthermore, he argues, attempts to apply scientific logic to values and to the observation process lead to impossible conclu- sions, and this casts a reflection on the validity of scien- tific logic.6 And again, he urges, desire and choice as "conscious states" "make prediction and control im- possible to the extent that they function as causes" 7 of physical behavior. "Behavior mechanics" taken alone is inadequate and will not work as a basis for deal- 4. On these two methods see Q. J. E., pp. 382-383, 404-405; A. E. R., p. 266. 5. Q. J. E., pp. 375-377, 387. One wonders why, if " desire" is really the analogue of "force" (in what Professor Knight would call the be- havioristic senses of these terms), the physicist's use of "force" is not also tautologous; or, if physics escapes tautology, why a scientific he- donism should not escape it too. 6.

But they are real and objective by the scientific test of in- telligent communicability. Moreover he finds that consciousness is "presupposed" by science in com- municability,9 and that value is "presupposed" in the observation process, which is always relative to some interest of (value for) the observer.' Hence conscious- ness and value are real, but one of our two methods of knowing, the more exact scientific method, can never get at them, so that for our understanding of mind and value we must have recourse to the immediate, non- analytical, ethical-esthetic method. And "motives re- sist reduction to any common measure or principle in any terms simpler in their own kind than value itself." 2 Professor Knight apparently feels that values can be known "from the inside" "immediately," but cannot be analyzed according to the methods of (scientific) logic. If one thinks of the scientific method of attaining knowledge not as one of two knowing faculties or powers of the mind, each having its own sphere of knowledge, but rather as a method of knowing differing from common sense in being more systematic and accurate in employ- ing the same type of data and much the same sort of reasoning, one will be likely to think Professor Knight's argument largely destructive. But perhaps the want of a more detailed account of the ethical-esthetic faculty of knowing (especially if it is to be identified with Berg- son's intuition) should rather leave one wondering whether Professor Knight is not essentially a mystic. Otherwise why should he tell us that interests are real in an ultra-scientific (literally metaphysical or super- 8. Q. J. E., p. 390. 1. Q. J. E., p. 397. 9. Q. J. E., p. 381. 2. Q. J.

I The issue seems to be: Shall we continue our present reliance on statistical technique, our efforts to put psy- chology and social science (including economic theory) into the form of objectively verifiable hypotheses? Or shall we, regarding it as an egregious error to seek to understand minds and purposes scientifically, and rele- gating the objective, scientific approach to "a subordin- ate and instrumental r6le" in the study of man, place our main emphasis on an approach "from the inside," and follow a program of investigation the precise nature of which Professor Knight has not yet made clear? His argument for the latter course is open to a double at- tack. (1) We may question the psychological hypo- thesis as to the nature of thought, on which his whole argument depends. Instead of supposing with Professor Knight that man has "two types of thought, between which there is no bridge," -(a) a scientific type, ap-- propriate to physics and the "mechanics" of exchange; and (b) an ethical-esthetic type, appropriate to under- standing minds and values and the chief reliance in the field of social " science," - it seems preferable to hold that thought is an activity, the different types of which shade off gradually into one another; that the scientific method of attaining knowledge as a type of thinking differs from other thinking by being systematic and careful in a higher degree; and that its proper sphere is not limited to a part of the field of knowledge but is coextensive with the entire field. Unless Professor Knight can show that " our minds do have an apparatus of thought and communication different [in kind] from that of scientific logic," he can hardly hope to establish its supremacy in dealing with mind and value by attack- 3. A. E. R., p. 249.</page><page sequence="6">PROFESSOR KNIGHT ON PSYCHOLOGY 139 ing the achievements of scientific method in this field of thought. (2) We may question the accuracy and ade- quacy of Professor Knight's conception of scientific method in general and as applied to man. It will be argued that he wrongly excludes inference from science, and wrongly conceives all scientific method to be pat- terned closely on that of mechanics, so that he is in part attacking a straw man. It will also be argued that he does not substantiate the charge of "flagrant incon- sistencies " in the nature of science, and that he confuses the want of present success in the anthropological sciences with the impossibility of success in the future. (1) The validity of Professor Knight's attempt to delimit the scope of scientific method depends first of all upon the correctness of his enumeration of the al- ternatives. Do our minds have a scientific apparatus of thinking and knowing, and another "higher" apparatus in addition? Professor Knight recognizes that the psy- chology of knowledge is fundamentally the point at issue.4 It is surprising, therefore, that he not only offers little constructive argument in support of his own views on this subject, but that he has scarcely discussed at all the views of the psychologists whom he is chiefly attack- ing. He does tell us that the behaviorist view involves an infinite progresses of talk to explain talk, talk to ex- plain the explanation, etc.,5 and he dogmatically asserts that "only grammatically does the statement [of the behaviorist's theory] make sense." But both his attack upon the behavioristic psychology of knowledge (which, 4. Q. J. E., pp. 373-374. 5. A. E. R., p. 255. In holding that an explanation of a thing is a form of response to (talking or thinking about) it, the behaviorist or other psy- chologist would be bound to admit that if each of these explanatory responses were to be itself explained by a subsequent response to itself as a stimulus, there would be an infinite (temporal) progressus. He need not hold that such a series will ever take place. Moreover it is hardly a sufficient refutation of a theory to show that it thus involves the notion of infinity.</page><page sequence="7">140 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS in contrast to his dualism, we might call monistic or perhaps pluralistic) and his defense of his own theory that the mind has two faculties of thought, are so much incidental to his discussion of the world that men know and think about that it would easily be possible to read both his articles and not realize that the psychology of knowledge and thought was at the very heart of the argument. Yet if he means to establish by the process of elimination that human purposes, in their "unique- ness" and growth, can only be understood by his "higher" apparatus of thought, he must first of all establish the correctness of this dualistic psychology of thought. And his views on this subject would probably receive little more support from introspectionists like Titchener or Woodworth than from Watson. Whatever may be the merits of his theory, it is in conflict not only with the behaviorists, but also with most of the other psychologists, at least in this country. And so far as these two articles go, his view is not only largely unsup- ported, but his conception of the "higher" apparatus of thought is not even clearly stated - perhaps this con- ception is one "to which it is difficult if not impossible to give clear expression in language." At all events it is difficult to state his dualistic epistemology except in terms strongly reminiscent of the long-discarded "fac- ulty psychology." But while a particular psychological 6 problem (that of the nature of thought) is the battle ground, the issue has a wider aspect. Science has repeatedly had to face the attempt to delimit its scope and set aside a field of knowledge which it could not enter. In the past this conflict has been associated with such* men as Galileo and Darwin. Without meaning to appraise living great- ness or to subscribe to a heroistic interpretation of the 6. Professor Knight would probably prefer to call it a "philosophical" problem, one which falls outside the proper field of science.</page><page sequence="8">PROFESSOR KNIGHT ON PSYCHOLOGY 141 history of thought, we may add as one who typifies the position around which the controversy centers to-day, Watson. Watson himself has suggested that the at- tempt to delimit the field of science by hypothecating a realm of "phenomena" which can never be gotten at scientifically may be a defense of religion and absolutistic philosophy.7 Professor Knight appears to use this de- limitation as a defense of the "will to believe," and he has recourse to an argument which has also been em- ployed by modern theology.8 Not that scientific method is opposed to any belief as such, religious or otherwise. On the contrary it requires us to test each possible niew fairly by reason and by observation, and then to face the truth fearlessly, whatever the verdict may be. Nor need one who objects to the attempt to delimit the scope of science, hold that it will be uniformly and completely successful everywhere. But pragmatically it is a good working hypothesis to assume that we can gain by syste- matic observations checked against one another, by precise use of terms, and by accurate reasoning, an hypothesis not lightly to be discarded. If no one has yet succeeded in understanding values scientifically, we should not, for want of early success, give up when psy- chology is still so young a science. (2) But is the method which Professor Knight finds incapable of dealing with value and mind properly to be identified as "scientific method"? To begin with, he finds that in the field of physics scientific thought has generated self-contradictions, and ends in analyzing all perceptible and imaginable qualities of things entirely out of existence." [Thus he refers to certain ] flagrant contradictions of thought in the modern theory of matter, familiar to every critical student of the subject, 7.

The issue really is, therefore, - does it de- stroy redness to understand it as a quality of objects by virtue of which they reflect light-waves chiefly of a wave length of about .0007 mm.? Or is water less wet for being known as H20? Professor Knight assumes without explanation that such "analyzing" is necessarily "ana- lyzing out of existence," but "common sense" at least is not clearly on his side in this assumption; and the pres- ent writer hazards the guess that by "critical student" he necessarily means a non-behaviorist. Professor Knight further argues that the attempts to maintain a thoroly scientific and logical view both in the investigation of inanimate bodies and in that of men leads to an irreconcilable conflict with " common sense." " The physicist," he tells us, " constantly recognizes that he really knows nothing about force" as a cause which " 'makes' things happen." I And in the anthropological field an exclusive reliance on science requires us to deny consciousness to the human organism,2 and conse- quently to exclude from the realm of the known such things as desire and feeling,3 interests and motives,4 pur- pose 5 and value,' meaning and the communication of ideas.7 Yet, he dogmatically asserts, it is an obvious fact that no human being really disbelieves iti the reality of force as an element in the external existent world, any more than he doubts the fact of consciousness in his fellow human beings.8 1.

Neither the physicist nor the psychologist needs to accept this "fact" in a sense which contradicts his science, nor in standing by his science to deny or overlook what is obvious and really disbelieved by no one. Let it be said once for all that the behaviorist as well as any other psychologist - and as we shall see Pro- fessor Knight's attack, tho nominally on behaviorism, is on the science of psychology as such - believes that men have minds and interests, that they are conscious of things going on around them, that things have values and words have meanings for them, and that men com- municate with one another. The behaviorist does not deny mind, interest, value, etc., "making all control an illusion" (which is what Professor Knight appears to think), and then proceed to act as if he believed in these things, science itself being avowedly instrumental and purposive. 9 The behaviorist does reserve the right which Professor Knight assumes for himself - the right to conceive mind and value in his own way. Professor Knight is rather like the man who defines an atheist as one who believes in a different kind of god from that in which he believes. The issue is not as to the existence of mind, value, etc., but whether Professor Knight's ad- mittedly unscientific conceptions of these things or the 9. Q. J. E., p. 388; A. E. R., p. 255. In one form Professor Knight's argument as to the self-contradictory nature of the behaviorist's posi- tion becomes an attempt to lift himself up intellectually by his boot- straps. The behaviorist, he urges, recognizes the correctness of Professor Knight's position in the very act of arguing against it. (A. E. R., pp. 249, 255, 258.) Of course the question at issue is precisely whether a scientific psychological account (such as that of the behaviorist) or Pro- fessor Knight's account of the sort of conscious, purposive, communica- tive human behavior called "arguing against Professor Knight" is the correct one. Professor Knight assumes his case established in this argument.</page><page sequence="11">144 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS conceptions of a scientific psychology - behavioristic or otherwise - shall prevail. As for physics, the careful physicist employs the con- cept of "force" only as an objectively measurable rela- tion between two bodies; and any further conception of force as a "real existence" "which makes objects fall" or move, serves not to add to an accurate, practical un- derstanding of inanimate objects and their behavior, but rather to create confusion by thinking of them as if they were human beings.' Professor Knight's exclusion of mind and value from the realm of scientific knowledge depends in part on his notion that "inferences" have no place in science,2 ex- cepting that observations in an important sense involve inference. Yet he seems to admit I that electrons, etc., are at least as truly matters of inference as values. And it is difficult to see how science can employ logic without employing inference. If values are to be excluded from science it will have to be on some other ground than that they are inferred rather than observed, for surely it is not unscientific to draw inferences. A more accurate formulation of the relation of observation and inference in scientific method would probably assert that for the most part science confines itself to making and investi- gating hypotheses which can be tested empirically. That is, as Professor Knight has so admirably said of tautological hedonism,4 an hypothesis which cannot be tested by comparing observation with a previous pre- 1. The thoroly anthropomorphic character of Professor Knight's thinking on this subject is apparent from the following passage: "The idea of force in connection with the motion of objects in space is a feeling of effort which we read into them on the basis of our own experience." Q. J. E., p. 381. (Italics are the present writer's.) And yet he thinks that "candid reflection" will show us all to be equally anthropomorphic in our habits of thought. 2. Q. J. E., p. 375. 3. A. E. R., p. 253. 4. Q. J. E., p. 377.</page><page sequence="12">PROFESSOR KNIGHT ON PSYCHOLOGY 145 diction (inference) is unscientific. On this ground Pro- fessor Knight clearly cannot exclude values, or at any rate feelings and purposes, from science, since he also argues I that any scientific hypothesis will in the nature of the case, where feelings and purposes make a differ- ence, yield predictions which disagree with observable facts; that in the field of human activity the application of scientific technique alone will not work as a method of controlling behavior. In other words, he holds that hypotheses regarding emotional and purposive behavior can be tested by observation, but will always be found wanting. This argument, while making it perfectly clear that scientific method, properly conceived, will seek to deal with values as well as with electrons or "the other side of the moon," suggests a limitation of another sort: science may try to understand human beings, but alone it can never succeed. The postulate of "uniformity of nature" on which all science rests, does not hold for human nature, since human organisms "do not remain unchanged through successive reactions. . . . They have memory." 6 But the sort of change of human na- ture involved in memory does not necessarily invalidate the postulate of "uniformity." This "requirement [of uniformity] for predicting future behavior from that of the past" will be satisfied, if only memory or " associa- tion " is a change in a human being that takes place uni- formly, so that psychologists can describe the change in terms of "laws of association." But the essence of the issue here involved is not tied 5. Q. J. E., p. 388. 6. A. E. R., p. 258. Professor Knight gets into difficulty when he as- serts that "Human 'bodies,' to be sure, have all the physical (universal, uniform, and inexorable) qualities of other objects," for he seems also to be denying to human bodies the uniformity of nature which in inanimate bodies makes prediction and control of their behavior possible. They cannot both have and lack this quality of uniformity at the same time!</page><page sequence="13">146 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS up with any particular uniformity or lack of it. Pro- fessor Knight desires to show that science alone can never succeed in predicting human behavior, and he cites evidence to show that it cannot now predict suc- cessfully. To assume (1) that it is theoretically possible to give a scientific explanation of " the infinitely various ' responses' of different individuals" whom one chances to meet as he goes down the street, the stimulus having been in each case for the experimenter to "thumb his nose at them or offer to present each with a dollar bill," and (2) that "only 'practical difficulties' prevent" such a scientific explanation, is obviously not "pure dogma, the antithesis of science." In asserting that it is,7 Pro- fessor Knight has confused two different sorts of possi- bility, or rather what science has not now accomplished with what it can never accomplish. If "is theoretically possible" means "possible in the present state of the science of psychology," the assumption is simply con- trary to fact. But if the assumption is amended to read, "may some day be possible," and for his purposes Pro- fessor Knight must show that it is also untrue in this form, the assumption becomes about equally difficult to prove or to disprove a priori. But it is an hypothesis which has been found fruitful in the past, and may be again. At all events " can't never did anything," and we are more likely to make progress in psychology and the social sciences if we act on the assumption of a sufficient uniformity of human nature to make progress possible. But if scientific methods are to be freely and opti- mistically employed in the study of man, there is surely ample justification for the criticism which Professor Knight's Bergsonian epistemology offers of those who would attempt to apply the methods of mechanics in economics or psychology. If scientific method is to be 7. A. E. R., p. 257.</page><page sequence="14">PROFESSOR KNIGHT ON PSYCHOLOGY 147 applied to such diverse materials as human and celestial bodies, it can only be because that method is adaptable to its varied subject matter. But our "apparatus of thought" and knowledge need not be like a two-speed auto. Rather it may be a (scientific) method which is continuously variable like its subject matter, with dif- fering concepts and technique of observation, according as the subject matter is the structure and behavior of inorganic bodies, or of protozoa, the structure and func- tioning of metazoan organs and tissues, the anatomy and behavior of some "higher" vertebrate organism as a whole, or the organization and behavior of groups of homo sapiens. And if Professor Knight means to imply that the behaviorist in psychology or the institutionalist in economics 8 is seeking to apply the methods of me- chanics to man, he could more fairly bring this charge against older views, such as that of the "structuralist" in psychology, and in the social sciences, such as his own view that "there is a science of economics, a true and even exact science, which reaches laws as universal as those of mathematics and mechanics." 9 The be- haviorist and the institutionalist believe their subjects to be biological sciences, and they employ concepts and (statistical) methods appropriate to classes of which the individual members differ from one another, to species that originate and evolve. As biologists, their observa- tional technique includes collecting specimens ("case work") and unearthing the remains of the past, as well as laboratory experiment. If the attempts of the behaviorist and the institu- tionalist to apply scientific method to human beings have thus far led to impossible conclusions, - and it is by no means clear they involve the difficulties Professor 8.

Tugwell, p. 256.</page><page sequence="15">148 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS Knight supposes, - we ought to remember that it still remains possible that a happier application may be made hereafter. But how fairly has Professor Knight conceived these attempts to apply scientific method to man? He is chiefly concerned here with that of the be- haviorist, and certainly his discussion of "behavior me- chanics " presents a mere caricature of the position he is criticizing. The behaviorist is under no compulsion to make the mistake of the early devotees of "scientific management," and assume that men behave like ma- chines, never tired, never angry, with no good will to enlist. On the contrary, investigating emotional and purposive behavior is part of his avowed job - to study the behavior of the organism as a whole. Moreover he is quite as able to predict and control behavior accurately as is the psychologist who believes in mental states or processes, each of which is "paralleled" by a physio- logical (nervous) state or process. Both believe that the physical facts pertaining to the organism and its en- vironment are adequate data for predicting and con- trolling the organism's behavior. And probably most American psychologists are either "parallelists" or behaviorists. When Professor Knight tells us that " The interpretation of human conduct in terms of 'be- havior patterns,' inherited or acquired, in relation to 'situations' . . . will not work," he is indicting paral- lelists as well as behaviorists. Both in this assertion that the postulate of uniformity of nature as applied to man "is practically false" 1 and in his insistence that psychology to be scientific must be behavioristic, and to be behavioristic must leave out essential data, Pro- fessor Knight is attacking not behaviorism alone but 1. A. E. R., p. 262. The form here given to the postulate is that "the sequence [ of human behavior facts I is really complete on a purely physi- cal level," a common form for the "parallelist." See also Q. J. E., p. 390.</page><page sequence="16">PROFESSOR KNIGHT ON PSYCHOLOGY 149 the very possibility of psychology as a scientific account of mind and human conduct. As a corollary to the proposition that scientific psy- chology does not require men to behave in detail like machines or other inanimate objects, we may say that "desire" (as one of Professor Knight's "metaphysical entities") may be the analogue of "force" (as another such entity) but that desire certainly is not the analogue of force from the viewpoint of psychology and physics. Unlike force, desire cannot be measured objectively, and it is extremely doubtful whether Professor Knight is right in assuming that it is quantitative. Incidentally it is doubtful also whether Professor Knight is justified in thinking of desire either as a stimulus 2 or as an end.3 A further difficulty in the analogy of desire to force is that, while force is commonly an elemental concept in physics, desire is a complex aspect of human behavior, which the psychologist will attempt to resolve into sim- pler terms. In fact from a scientific standpoint it is difficult to see any analogy between force and desire at all. The whole analogy exists only in Professor Knight's metaphysics. So much for the two steps in Professor Knight's argu- ment considered as a process of elimination. Viewed now as a whole, the argument assumes another aspect: We have [he says] two sources of information in regard to the causes of human behavior, but they do not tell the same story; and yet we cannot disbelieve in the validity of either of them.4 We are infinitely more sure of these [two sets of I more or less contradic- tory facts than we are of any [logical] principles which will resolve 6 the conflict between them. Therefore we can better rely upon these contradictory data of (scientific and ethical- esthetic) observation than on our reason. If this is his 2. Q. J. E., p. 399. 4. Q. J. E., p. 383. 3. Q. J.

And yet, in spite of his sureness of these two kinds of "observational" data, he finds the data of scientific observation not "immediate" because this type of ob- servation "rests upon ages of mental sophistication" and because it is conditioned by the language into which it must be put.6 He holds these data to be constructs of an elaborate process of purposive inference, while "the facts of modern genetic [which he apparently regards as non-scientific] psychology" make it "much more natural and easy" to regard the data of ethical-esthetic observation as "immediate." I But the argument against immediacy can be transposed 8 to apply to the data of ethical-esthetic observation too, making them also elaborate constructs dependent upon ages of so- phistication. Certainly they are equally learned re- sponses for the psychologist and social scientist, and equally the result of inference or reasoning. Even if one believes that reasoning has not yet succeeded in resolv- ing the conflict between these two different sources of information (assuming that they are so different as to constitute two distinct types "between which there is no bridge"), why should he assume it never will? Or if the "will to believe" takes precedence over reason, why bother with a reasoned basis for the precedence? But if it is true that Professor Knight's argument 6. Q. J. E., p. 398. 7. A. E.

There are difficulties with transposing literally, since his argument confuses (or identifies?) the thing known with the knowledge of it, and logical priority with chronological priority. The statement in Q. J. E., p. 398, "Knowledge of that which we say we infer [other minds as con- scious centers] is logically prior to knowledge of that which we say we observe [e. g., physical objects], since it is a condition of observation itself," should be amended by striking out the first two words and sub- stituting "chronologically" for "logically."</page><page sequence="18">PROFESSOR KNIGHT ON PSYCHOLOGY 151 rests on a conception of the nature of scientific method, which, because it smacks too exclusively of mechanics, is inadequate in general, and especially in its applica- bility to the study of human behavior; if, further, it is true that to conceive thought as continuous is more in accord with modern psychology than to assume with Professor Knight that there are distinct faculties of thought; and finally, if it is true that, while scientific, as distinguished from less logical and systematic, meth- ods may be limited in their applicability to human con- duct because of non-uniformity of human nature, still we are only able to get the most out of these methods by assuming that their scope is coextensive with the field of our knowledge; then the outlook for economics as a social science is not so dark as Professor Knight's argument would make it. His critique of "quantity of life" and "adaptation" 9 as ("scientific"?) terms into which some have sought to analyze values is surely well made, as is also his critique of the concept of "social control." But instead of accepting Professor Knight's mystical attitude toward human desires and purposes and he gives us little or nothing in the way of concrete, specific suggestions as to how to study them from this approach - perhaps we may still proceed on the as- sumption that psychology and social science will be able, by improvement of statistical and laboratory technique, by a more exhaustive collection of data, by better defini- tion of terms and formulation of problems, and by ac- curate reasoning, to render a scientific account of hu- man purposes and values.'
