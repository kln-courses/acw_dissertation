Both were acquired by the British Museum in 1843 from the second Earl of Belmore, and though their provenance is lost, styl istically they are similar to one another and both probably came from the same place, which, in view of the titles held by the persons named, was most probably Thebes.

Aston above seven vertical columns of inscription. Clearly belonging to the same group is that of Tauetek (T3wtk ?), known through a single side, San José RC 598, which is also painted black with inscriptions and figural decoration in yellow, though in this instance a little green is also used. At top it shows a row of alternating djed and tyet amulets which are sited above horizontal and vertical rows of texts, whilst the lower third shows two of the four sons of Horus. In view of these examples, two other incom plete boxes, originally belonging to Nakht(ef) Thoth and Iset now in Leiden, AH 32a (pis. 20a-b), and AH32b (pi. 21), respectively, are perhaps also to be considered as canopic boxes, though they dif fer to the previous three. They are more rectangu lar and flatter in shape, recalling boxes of type Bl, but both are painted black with outline drawings similar to that found on St Petersburg 822. If any thing can be made of the fact that this decorative style is found on boxes which in shape recall those of types Bl, B2 and C, it is possible that they should be dated to a period when type B1 was giving way to type B2, and at the same time as the first appear ance of type C, and thus this style should perhaps be dated to the sixth century BC. On the other hand, however, this yellow on black style of decora tion is found on coffins from Akhmim and Thebes which are generally dated to the Thirtieth Dynasty or early Ptolemaic Periods.102 Vienna A806 (type B2, pi 22, unpublished) is perhaps related to the above types, since three of the four sides are entirely black.
