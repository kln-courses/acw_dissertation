<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Romano-British Pottery Manufacturing Site at Oakleigh Farm, Higham, Kent By P. D. CATHERALL A seemingly extensive site which was engaged in the manufacture of Black-burnished pottery of Category 2, was discovered during the construction of a gas pipeline in north Kent. From the evidence recovered, it appears that the site was engaged in production for around a century, beginning in the middle of the second century A.D. The remains of four kilns, together with a number of associated features, were excavated. INTRODUCTION N the spring of 1978, the construction of a gas pipeline from the eastern outskirts of Gravesend to the Isle of Grain, revealed the existence of a previously unknown Romano- British site at Oakleigh Farm (TQ 729 741) in the parish of Higham, Kent (FIG. I). The site was first noticed by Messrs Patrick Thornhill and Percy Payne, both members of the Kent Archaeological Society. The Engineer in charge of the construction of the pipeline was immedi- ately informed of the discovery and arrangements were put in hand for the examination of the site by the author (Archaeological Adviser, British Gas Corporation). The excavation and recording of the site took place during the time the pipeline was being constructed. The remains of four kilns used for the manufacture of Black-burnished ware, category 2 (BB2) were examined. The scale of the investigations was subject to a number of constraints, such as the speed of the construction programme, the size of the site, the available manpower and by the need to maintain a presence on other parts of the pipeline route, where other sites were being discovered. Despite these restrictions, all four kilns were at least partially excavated and a number of other features were recorded, mainly in the sections of the pipetrench, when this was cut. THE SITE (FIG. 2) The kilns were located on the east-facing slope of a slight valley which is bisected by a small stream (which forms the boundary between the parishes of Higham and Cliffe). The subsoil of the site consists of sand, the colour of which varies from white to bright yellow. The evidence from the pipetrench suggested that the site covers the whole slope to the west of the stream and, indeed, it may cover the crest and part of the further slope some 300 metres to the west of the kilns. There were no positive indications of Roman occupation to the east of the stream, although the occupation material runs down to its western edge. Excavation of the pipetrench through the bed of the stream showed that, although it is quite insignificant in size today, it had once been much larger, with a minimum width of some 15 metres. This stream, which reaches the Thames as Higham Creek may once, therefore, have been navigable for craft such as barges, an important consideration in the siting of a pottery manufactory.

A casual survey of the field to the north and south of the pipeline revealed a substantial pottery scatter in both directions. This scatter may indicate that the site extends for as much as 400 metres from north to south. Part of the area outside the pipeline construction area was the subject of a geophysical survey by the Ancient Monuments Laboratory of the Department of the Environment, using a fluxgate gradiometer (AML Report G30/78). The results point to the existence of other possible features, both to the north and south of the pipeline. The presence of pits and ditches is suggested but there are no definite traces of other kilns in the area surveyed. THE EXCAVATION (FIG. 3) Once the topsoil had been stripped off over the site, two kilns were located, each of which showed as a roughly oval outline of red fired clay. The surrounding subsoil was stained black and so the positions of the two stokeholes were not immediately apparent. After the pipe- trench had been cut through the site, it could be seen that over the whole area covered by the kilns and running down the slope as far as the stream, was a layer, up to one metre in depth, of discoloured and stained sand. Such staining has been noted at other sites, such as Rough Piece, Linwood, where the excavator considered it likely that the darkest areas were</page><page sequence="3">A ROMANO-BRITISH POTTERY MANUFACTURING SITE AT OAKLEIGH FARM 105 ++ BI B I I I limits of -II igeophysical ,- survey pits/ditches ? 30 m o 100 ft FIG. 2.

The kilns and other features were cut into this layer. Because of its nature and the size of the site, it was not feasible to attempt to clean down a large area. 1 V. G.

Towards the end of the excavation, it was decided to investigate a hole which had been dug a few metres to the east of these kilns. This hole and several others in the immediate vicinity appear to have been the result of a treasure hunter's weekend activities. The hole had partially destroyed an otherwise perfectly preserved kiln (Kiln C). This was subsequently excavated, along with the small portion of its stokehole which lay within the pipeline easement. Apart from the kilns and the feature into which Kiln A had been cut (Feature I) no other features were noted in the immediate area until the pipetrench was dug. On examination of the section of this trench, a further three features (Features 2-4) were recorded. Little in the way of vertical stratigraphy was noted on site; the only observed sequences coming from Feature I and possibly Kiln C.</page><page sequence="5">A ROMANO-BRITISH POTTERY MANUFACTURING SITE AT OAKLEIGH FARM 107 0 05 1 m 0 1 2 3 ft '\ STOKEHOLE * +++ + 4- + LIMIT OF\ FL+ 'FLUE + + EXCAVATION' + S+4-DOME,+++ + + +++ 4-. + + + + WALL OF POTTERY CHAMBER FLOOR?V..* , / FIG. 4. Plan of Kiln C. KILN C This kiln was the best preserved of those excavated, although substantial damage had been caused by a very modern disturbance. This destruction had probably resulted in the removal of part of the raised floor of the oven and part of the wall of the kiln (FIG. 4). The axis of the kiln was NNW-SSE, with the stokehole being situated at the northern end of the chamber. Unfortunately, the major part of the stokehole lay outside the pipeline easement and it was therefore not investigated. The furnace chamber was slightly oval in plan, measuring 0-84 x 0o94 m internally. The bottom of this chamber had a solid clay floor, in the centre of which was a free-standing clay pedestal which supported a permanent raised clay floor (FIG. 5). This pedestal was roughly circular in plan and had a definite waist. The surviving portion of the floor was o - Io m thick and had been pierced by at least six vent-holes, most of which were extremely irregular in both size and shape.</page><page sequence="6">IO8 P.

The clay walls of the kiln survived to a maximum height of some 0"55 m above the lower clay floor. On the north-east side, the wall still included part of the overhanging 'lip', on the same level as the raised floor of the oven. The walls of the kiln were o-o8 m thick at their base and tapered slightly to 0a05 m thick at the top. They had been constructed inside a scoop and the sand outside them was discoloured with ash. The fill of the stokehole was also dis- coloured, but to an even greater degree, most of the fill being black in colour. It consisted of black, ashy sand, pottery fragments and kiln debris (fragments of vitrified clay and pieces of red or green-grey fired clay). The flue leading from the stokehole had a level clay floor and a domed clay roof over its whole length (0a70 m). This roof was an integral part of the walls of the kiln and the floor</page><page sequence="7">A ROMANO-BRITISH POTTERY MANUFACTURING SITE AT OAKLEIGH FARM IO9 of the flue was a continuation of that of the furnace chamber. The flue tapered in plan, the internal measurements being c. 0o'55 m at its entrance into the chamber and o030 m at the stokehole. The roof also declined in height towards the stokehole, from 0-35 m to only o. 15 m (FIG. 5, A-B). A structure made from red-fired clay was noted below the flue inside the stokehole, but as the kiln was not in danger of being destroyed by pipelaying operations, it was decided not to remove it. This structure was therefore not investigated further. From the interior of the furnace chamber came a strip of coiled lead. A natural flint pro- jection, some o00o6 m long and tapering in shape (FIG. 16:4) was found with the pottery and kiln debris in the stokehole. This flint was covered in cortex, apart from at its tip, where it was worn, and also at its larger end where it had been detached from a larger piece of flint. The worn end displays a distinct facet. The size and angle of this facet identify the piece as a tool used for adding the decoration to the pots (as for example on V. 19 (FIG. 12) which comes from this stokehole). FEATURE I (FIG. 6) During the excavation of Kiln A, it became obvious that the kiln had been constructed inside a large hollow (Feature I), which also contained the remains of an earlier kiln (Kiln D). The stokehole of Kiln A was also contained (in part at least) within Feature I (FIG. 7). The total extent of this hollow is not known because its excavation in a southerly direction was not possible. It is clear, however, that it was of considerable size, measuring in excess of 4"50 m on a N-S axis, while its width was some 4-oo m (FIG. 6). The maximum depth recorded was 0.93 m in the stokehole of Kiln A (FIG. 8). This measurement is probably accurate as the fill of Feature I could be seen quite distinctly running below the lower flue of Kiln A, which had been dug through it. Three possible postholes were discovered at the bottom of Feature I, although it was not possible to determine whether or not they were contemporary with it since they only appeared as circular depressions, filled with the same black, ashy sand which filled most of Feature I. They were similar in size to each other, measuring some 0-30 m in diameter and being cut o - 15 m into undisturbed sand. The fill of Feature I, where it had been cut through by Kiln A, was variegated. It consisted at these points of dark brown/black sand containing lenses of black, ashy sand and orange/brown sand. The fill elsewhere comprised mainly black sand, pottery fragments and kiln debris. This latter material was often vitrified. KILN D (FIG. 6) Kiln D consisted of a section of wall, slightly to the south-east of the wall of Kiln A. The top of this slight wall, which survived to a maximum height of only o* 12 m, was some 0 -48 m below the stripped surface of the subsoil. The top of this wall corresponded exactly to the bottom of Kiln A's construction pit. The wall was joined to a fired clay floor, a portion of which lay under the pedestal of Kiln A while another part had been reused as part of the floor of Kiln A's furnace chamber (FIG. 8). Both the wall and floor of Kiln D could be followed behind the wall of Kiln A and underneath part of its lower flue. The clay wall of Kiln D was black at the top of the surviving portion and bright red at the bottom, where it overlay yellow sand. Almost a quarter of the circumference of Kiln D still survived in some form and so it is possible to state with some degree of certainty that the diameter of the chamber is unlikely to have much exceeded L-Io m. No datable material was directly associated with the remains of this kiln. Fragments of a bronze bracelet (FIG. 16: 2) and some pottery (FIGS. 12: IO; 13: 30, 40 and 41; 14: 59) were, however, recovered from Feature I.</page><page sequence="8">II0 P. D.

FEATURES 2, 3 AND 4 (FIG. 3) During the cutting of the pipetrench, an indistinct feature (Feature 2) was briefly seen in the southern section of the trench, some 2. 10 m to the east of the edge of Feature I (FIG. 3). It had a fill of black soil and pottery fragments. Unfortunately, none of the pottery could be recovered. Feature 3 also showed in the same section, some I -60 m to the east of Feature 2 and 2-30 m west of Feature 4. It consisted of a shallow scoop in the discoloured sand, measuring some 0 -70 m in length. The bottom of this scoop was lined with dark red fired clay, o. Io m thick. The maximum depth of the feature was only some 0-25 m.

Plan of Kiln A. been partially truncated by the machines used for digging the trench (FIG. 3). It consisted of part of a massive, simple everted-rim jar which was lying on its side in the bottom of a scoop which had been lined with a thin layer of yellow clay, into which the jar had been set. The jar was aligned with its rim pointing towards the west. It was completely filled with broken pottery. Indeed, there was very little sand within the container, although it appeared to have been sealed with a layer of discoloured brown sand some -20 m thick. It is possible, though unlikely, that this layer had been deposited by the machines. Feature 4 measured o - 6o m in length and some o-6o m in width, although a certain amount may have been lost from the latter measurement.</page><page sequence="10">A A' subsoil surface...

KILN A (FIG. 7) Kiln A had been constructed inside a pit, which itself had been dug into Feature I (FIGS: 8 and 9). This construction pit had been some 0o40 m greater in diameter than the chamber of the kiln. The walls had been constructed from clay and averaged 0"05 m in thickness. The fact that the wall had a regular and smooth outer face would appear to demonstrate that the wall had been constructed separately from the filling of the construction pit. The space between</page><page sequence="12">114 P. D. CATHERALL the wall and the edge of the pit had originally been filled with yellow clay. Subsequent firings of the kiln had turned much of this to a cherry-red colour (FIG. 8). Kiln A was a type of kiln with a raised oven floor, similar in size and design to Kiln C. The furnace chamber measured I -25 m in length and I - Io m in width internally. The floor of the chamber had been stepped up in that portion furthest from the stokehole, it being o0 2o m higher in that part than where closer to the flues. Towards the lower flue, the floor had been destroyed in antiquity. The central, free-standing clay pedestal was oval in plan, measuring o-35 m in length and o 45 m in width (FIG. 7). At the back of the chamber the pedestal was waisted. This pedestal had supported a raised clay floor which had divided the oven from the furnace chamber. Where it survived, this floor varied in thickness from o014 to o-o8 m, with an average thick- ness of o-Io m. Very little of the oven above the raised floor survived; the walls standing to a maximum height of only 0 05 m. They averaged o0 -5 m in thickness and had been carried down below the level of the clay floor of the furnace chamber, except in those areas where the floor of Kiln D had been re-used. The raised floor of the oven had been pierced by at least six vent-holes on the circumference of the floor. Of the four complete examples, three measured o-I12 x o. Io m and the other o 14 x o- o m. The edges of all the vent-holes were covered in vitrified clay. Extensive areas of vitrification were also noted on the walls of the furnace chamber, on the outside surfaces of the central pedestal and on the walls of the lower flue. The pedestal, despite its size, had fired hard throughout. The lower flue was some o9go m in length and was circular in section, measuring 0o36 m in diameter. It had been tunnelled through the fill of Feature I. There also appears to have been an upper flue, 0 25 m in length and measuring 0-24 m in height and 0o.32 m in width. The sides of this upper flue showed signs of burning and there was a distinct, fired level running from this flue towards the stokehole (FIG. 8). The size and shape of the stokehole are unknown as it was not possible to excavate it fully. Its fill consisted of black, ashy sand which was noticeably looser than the fill of Feature I, and quantities of pottery sherds. The predominant forms present in Kiln A and its stokehole were Gross Forms I, III and V, those of dishes and bowls (see TABLE I, Coarse Pottery Report). A broken iron key (FIG. 16: 3) was also recovered from the fill of this stokehole. A note on this object by Dr W. Manning is included below, p. I39. Concentrations of pottery were found under the floor of the oven inside the furnace chamber, notably in the north-west corner. Underneath one of the vent-holes furthest from the flues was a bronze belt-buckle (FIG. i6: i). Other concentrations of pottery occurred on the floor of the oven, both in the north-west and south-east. The lower flue contained the almost complete remains of a pie-dish (GF I), together with other large fragments of pottery. A number of flint flakes (FIG. 16: 5) were also found in the interior of the furnace chamber, together with a partially-polished pebble (FIG. 16: 6) and several pieces of bone. It was possible to identify these in situ as being ribs (probably of cattle or horses), but they were in such a friable condition that they were not recovered intact. The clay which had been used in the construction of the central pedestal of Kiln A was found to contain large quantities of vegetable matter. This has proved to be mainly barley (see below p. 140). KILN B Kiln B lay only some I -30 m to the north of Kiln A (FIGS. 3 and Io), where its wall abutted the edge of Feature I. It was oval in plan, measuring I ~3o m in width and 200oo m in length including the flue, which was an integral part of the single chamber (FIG. Io). The kiln con- tained a roughly circular, low central platform, with maximum dimensions of o 80 x 0o 70 m, which was surrounded by a shallow gully averaging 0O2o m in width at the top and o-15 m</page><page sequence="13">A ROMANO-BRITISH POTTERY MANUFACTURING SITE AT OAKLEIGH FARM 115 stakeholes STOKEHOLE 'LIMIT OF /,'EXCAVATION / 0 CENTRAL STAND E F KILN WALL FIG. io. Plan of Kiln B. in width at its base. It also varied in depth from o o10 to 0.20 m. The 'neck', which served as a flue, was some o - 6o m in length and led to a stokehole located to the north-east. The walls of the kiln, which survived to a maximum height of 0 - 12 m had a thickness of 0 - 15 m. There was no evidence that the platform had ever supported a raised floor (FIG. I I). In the gully on the east side was a hole through the baked clay floor. This seems to be a modern animal disturbance. Part of the floor of the flue was also missing, but it was noticeable that this area had not been fired to a particularly high temperature. Some small pieces of vitrified clay were recovered from the kiln. The stokehole was only partially excavated. Its full extent is unknown. Its depth was o- 65 m. A number of possible stakeholes were found at the bottom of the feature. Two were situated towards its western edge (FIG. io) and four towards the eastern side. They averaged o-o8 m</page><page sequence="14">II6 P. D. CATHERALL C D subsoil level fired clay 000 0 0 0 0.. 0 .. S0005 om t 1 2 30 ft yellow sand 0 0.5 1 m 0 1 2 3 ft FIG. I I. Kiln B.

Their relationship with the stokehole was unclear as they were noticed only in the bottom of the feature after the black sand fill had been removed. There can be no certainty, however, that they did not penetrate the fill of the stokehole. No concentrations of pottery were apparent, either in the kiln or the stokehole, although pottery was present in some quantity in the stokehole. It is worth noting that the majority of the sherds belong to jar forms; this is the only context where such is the case (see TABLE I, Coarse Pottery Report). A flint flake was also found in the fill of the stokehole. DISCUSSION The evidence from the pipetrench, the area covered by the surface pottery scatter and the evidence of the geophysical survey by the Ancient Monuments Laboratory, when considered together, suggests that the pottery manufacturing site covers a considerable area. There is a distinct lack of domestic-type material from the site. The belt-buckle from the interior of Kiln A and the bracelet from Feature I are both personal items which might easily have been lost by people working at the site. The only items which stand out are two sherds of samian, one fragment of mortarium, a few pieces of possible Oxford red colour-coated ware, a few miscellaneous sherds and a coin of Tetricus I (A.D. 270-3). The sherds of samian and the coin came from the surface of the subsoil and were unstratified. There seems little doubt, therefore, that the site was used primarily for the manufacture of good quality BB2 pottery.</page><page sequence="15">A ROMANO-BRITISH POTTERY MANUFACTURING SITE AT OAKLEIGH FARM 117 Kiln C was the earliest feature excavated. The enigmatic structure below the opening of the flue hints at the possibility of an earlier structure on the site but the evidence is inconclusive. The kiln itself appears to have been built inside a scoop. No trace of a construction pit was found but the sand surrounding the walls was discoloured and extended for at least 0-70 m in one direction. This practice of building kilns inside scoops is known from other pottery manufacturing sites, such as Hanborough I and Churchill Hospital, Oxford,2 and Rough Piece, Linwood.3 There is no hard evidence to indicate how long Kiln C had remained in use. The pottery from this kiln can be dated to A.D. I60-80, but no more precisely than this. Certainly, the kiln was very robustly constructed, perhaps to avoid damage from subsidence in a pre-existing scoop. It had also obviously been fired to a considerable temperature since pieces of vitrified clay were recovered among the debris in the stokehole. The vent-holes perhaps provide a clue which would seem to indicate repeated firings. Most of the vent-holes were extremely irregular in both size and shape. It was certainly noticeable that the furthest surviving vent- hole from the flue was perfectly circular and was only o- Io m in diameter, while those nearer to the source of the heat were mostly considerably larger as well as being irregular in shape. This observation is in direct contrast to otherwise similar kilns discovered near Wilderspool,4 where the vent-holes increased in diameter towards the rear of the oven. This, it was suggested, was to ensure an even distribution of heat throughout the oven. The spacing of the surviving vent-holes in Kiln C would suggest that there had originally been ten or eleven of them, if one assumes that they continued around the whole circumference of the oven floor. The walls of the kiln still contained part of the 'lip'. This would presumably have been used to provide a footing for some kind of roof. No traces of a roof were found in Kiln C, although fragments of kiln debris were recovered from the fill of the stokehole. It is possible that some kind of organic material, such as turf, was used to seal the oven. The kiln debris occurred mixed together with pottery fragments in distinct concentrations within the fill of the stokehole. The impression given by these concentrations was one of deliberate infilling of the stokehole, perhaps by two or more persons, one of whom was dis- posing of waste pottery and kiln debris while the others were shovelling sand into the feature. Little pottery was recovered from the interior of the furnace chamber (in contrast to the situation in Kiln A), but the coiled strip of lead which was found there must have been deposited subsequent to the kiln's last firing, since otherwise it would certainly have been melted. Feature I seems to have been a large scoop. It is unfortunate that the relationship between the apparent postholes and the scoop was not absolutely clear. The function of the scoop is difficult to ascertain, whether or not the postholes are seen as an integral part of it. At least two of the possible postholes were situated on the edge of the feature but the evidence does not suffice to enable the feature to be identified as part of a building. This lack of positive evidence about buildings is only too common with regard to most pottery manufacturing sites.5 In view of the very limited nature of the excavations at Oakleigh Farm, such negative evidence should not, however, be used to suggest that workshop buildings, situated close to the kilns as at Stibbington in the Nene Valley," are nowhere to be found on the site. The presence of the three possible postholes, the fragment of the key and the evidence of pits and ditches indicated by the geophysical survey suggest that substantial timber buildings may have existed in the immediate vicinity. 2 C.

Rep. 10, 1973), 135-8.</page><page sequence="16">II8 P. D. CATHERALL If the scoop is not seen as part of a building, its function must be sought in other directions. It is possible that it was formed as the result of the continual destruction and rebuilding of kilns on the same spot. Certainly, the fill of the hollow contained fragments of fired clay which may have come from destroyed or abandoned kilns. The practice of rebuilding kilns on the same spot is attested at other kiln sites, including Amberwood Kiln I, Lower Sloden,7 and Linwood.8 In this case, however, it is difficult to account for the comparatively large size of the hollow in relation to the size of the kilns. The construction of Kiln A involved the digging of a vertically-sided pit, only some o'40 m greater in diameter than the resulting furnace chamber. Since the walls of the furnace chamber were not free-standing, it is unlikely that hollows any larger than Kiln A's construction pit would have been needed. But Feature I was at least 4 -o m in width and over 4" 50 m in length. The possible hollow surrounding Kiln C would also appear to be much greater in diameter than the kiln itself. One possibility is that these hollows had originated as scoops for the collection of sand. The pottery recovered from the site has, in the main, a sandy fabric and it is possible that quantities of sand would have been required for large-scale production. These scoops would then have had a useful secondary function, being used for the disposal of waste material or as sites for the construction of new kilns. Other uses to which such hollows could have been put include the provision of clay-weathering pits. Two kilns had been constructed inside Feature I (Kilns A and D). The remains of Kiln D suggest that it may have been contemporary with Feature I, although as Kiln D seems to have been of the same size range as the other kilns on site, the hollow is unlikely to represent its construction pit. Kiln D's floor sat directly on undisturbed sand and there was no trace of a construction pit to suggest that Kiln D had been placed in an already filled Feature I. It must be admitted, however, that the remains of Kiln D were scanty and had obviously suffered some destruction during the construction of Kiln A. It is possible to interpret the relative positions of Kilns A and D as suggesting that Kiln A was built immediately on the abandonment of Kiln D. This would provide an explanation for the re-use of part of the floor of Kiln D and for the survival of its wall to precisely the bottom of Kiln A's construction pit. But if Kiln D is contemporary with the filling of Feature I, as seems likely, then the two kilns would have to fill the whole timespan between the filling of Feature I (which can be dated on the evidence of the pottery to c. A.D. I80-2IO) and the abandonment of Kiln A (c. A.D. 220-40). If Kiln A had been constructed immediately after the abandonment of Kiln D, however, it is difficult to understand why there should have been a change in its position and in its alignment, since this involved the cutting of a new flue. The evidence seems more in keeping with there having been an interval between the abandonment of Kiln D and the construction of Kiln A. The survival of Kiln D's wall to the bottom of Kiln A's construction pit poses no difficulties to such an interpretation, since the design of Kiln A, with its furnace chamber constructed below ground level, would have necessitated the removal of the upper portions of the ruined kiln, except where they could be conveniently re-used, as was the case with a portion of the floor of the furnace chamber. The remains of Kiln D would suggest that it had been similar in design to Kilns A and C, with a permanent raised floor. Kiln A differed from Kiln C in that there appears to have been two flues. The lower one was circular and had been tunnelled through the fill of Feature I. Thus there was no necessity for a clay roof as there was with the flue of Kiln C. The upper flue, however, was much shorter and was angled downwards, entering the furnace chamber just below the level of the permanent 7 M. G. Fulford, New Forest Pottery (BAR 17, 1975), 14. 8 B. W.

It was noticeable that there was a definite, burnt surface spreading from the entrance of this flue over the top of the material through which the lower flue was cut. This upper flue was oval in section, with the width being greater than the height. It is difficult to understand the need for this second flue, which seems to have no parallels at present amongst Romano-British kilns, if it was merely intended to carry hot air from the stokehole into the furnace chamber. It does, however, appear to make sense if it were used as a means of shovelling embers and fuel into the furnace chamber, rather than having to introduce them through the lower flue which was o-9o m in length. This idea might also explain the angle and shape of the flue. One other possibility remains, that this flue was cut at a late stage in the kiln's life as a result of the lower part of the furnace chamber becoming choked with ashes (pers. comm. V. G. Swan). This is possible, although it should be noted that the floor of the furnace chamber immediately in front of the entrance to the lower flue had been worn away, presumably by the continual raking-out of the ashes after each firing. The elongated width of the upper flue (o 32 m) might be explained as either the result of a shovel occasionally hitting the sides of the flue as embers were introduced into the furnace chamber, or it might give some indication of the size of the implement used for this task. The kiln seems to have been deliberately filled with sand and broken pottery. Large amounts of pottery were found in the furnace chamber under the surviving portion of the oven floor. This might suggest that the missing part of the floor had collapsed or been removed before the backfilling took place. The lower flue contained the remains of an almost complete vessel (Gross Form I - similar to FIG. I2: 7) and other large fragments of pottery. It is possible that this pot had been used to seal up the flue during the kiln's last firing, but in this case it might be expected that the furnace chamber would still have contained any ashes which had been introduced as fuel during the firing. There was no trace of any such concentration of ash, and a fragment of the same vessel was found in the interior of the furnace chamber. Two adjoining pieces from a jar were also recovered, one coming from the lower flue and the other from the interior of the kiln. This suggests that the kiln was not abandoned during its last firing. The idea of deliberate backfilling seems supported by the presence of the belt-buckle in the fill of the furnace chamber as well as the presence of the bones, the flint flakes and the partially polished pebble. These latter finds suggest that a potter's tool-kit, or at least part of one, had been incorporated into the rubbish which had been packed into the abandoned kiln. Bone tools, flint flakes and rounded pebbles showing signs of wear consistent with their having been used for burnishing or smoothing, are known from other pottery manufacturing sites.9 It is worth noting in this context that a much lower proportion of decorated sherds was found in Kiln A contexts compared with Kiln C. A burnishing stone was found in Kiln A and a flint nodule (almost certainly used for producing the linear decoration found on the vessels) in Kiln C. The discovery of part of a tool-kit in two of the kilns on the site, besides rein- forcing the idea that the kilns were deliberately backfilled, suggests that the kilns were abandoned at the end of a production run. That they were not abandoned as a result of damage seems evident from the excellent condition in which they were discovered. Some other factor, which is not immediately apparent, seems to have led to their abandonment. Kiln B is quite clearly a different type of kiln but its position in relation to Kiln A would suggest that they may be contemporary. This also seems to be borne out by the pottery evidence. The pottery from the stokehole of Kiln B appears to be the only 'mixed' assemblage from the site and it may be that this pottery had accumulated in the vicinity over a number of years before deposition in the fill of the stokehole. The latest pottery from the stokehole of Kiln B can be dated to the same phase as the material from Kiln A. Although different in type from the other kilns at Oakleigh Farm, Kiln B belongs to a 9 Young, op. cit. (note 2), 19.</page><page sequence="18">120 P. D. CATHERALL common class of kiln. It is paralleled at Boar's Hill, Oxford,10 where a low central platform, surrounded by a circular 'flue', was found still packed with pots. Other parallels are the kilns in the Joslin kiln group at Colchester and many of the kilns in the Wattisfield complex in Suffolk. The type is common in the BB2 potteries around the Thames Estuary and among the potteries in that area making related wares, as at Mucking,1 Orsett,12 Buckenhams Farm, Billericay 13 and Chelmsford.14 The kiln excavated at Chalk, although originally interpreted as having a collapsed floor, may have been similar 15 (FIG. I). Kilns of the type represented by Kilns A and C are also found in the area around the Thames Estuary. The example excavated at the nearby site of Cooling by Muggeridge, although it was built above ground, clearly had a central pedestal and a permanent, clay, vent-holed floor.16 The kilns from the complex at Highgate Wood are also similar in many respects, although they too are surface built.17 The kilns at sites in northern Kent are generally poorly preserved, but the fragmentary remains of a kiln which may have been similar to Kilns A and C at Oakleigh Farm were discovered at Hoo Junction.18 Another possible kiln site in this area was uncovered at Joyden's Wood, although there now appears to be some doubt as to whether the remains are those of a kiln or a corn-drier.19 What does not appear to be in doubt is that this particular area of north Kent contained a large number of specialist pottery-manufacturing sites. Early references to a site near Higham Church which suggest that kiln debris was to be found covering an area of some four acres make it likely that further extensive sites remain to be discovered in the immediate vicinity of Oakleigh Farm.20 Other features of the Oakleigh Farm site, such as Feature 4, can also be paralleled elsewhere. There seems little doubt that Feature 4 represents a deliberately constructed container. The key to its function would appear to lie in the use of a layer of clay in which it was bedded. Although it was full of waste sherds when discovered, it is much more likely that it was in- tended as a water container and had been reused for rubbish disposal at a later date. Similar containers are known from sites such as Linwood.21 CONCLUSIONS The dating of the site rests almost entirely upon the evidence of the waste pottery found in the various kilns and related structures. The number of stratigraphical relationships which were noted during the work were limited. However, it is worth emphasizing that in every instance the dating sequence suggested by the pottery study was supported by the stratigraphy. A putative Phase I has been included, because there remains the possibility of an earlier structure underlying the flue of Kiln C, even though the present evidence for this is scanty and unsatisfactory. 10 E.

Introduction Romano-British pottery was recovered from a total of twelve contexts, most of them within or directly associated with the four kilns (TABLE I). The vast bulk of this material can be grouped under one broad fabric type, described below as local or '"Kiln" Fabric'. Rim sherds from the site were almost entirely of this ware, and these have been quantified by vessel rim equivalents.2" A Form Typology has been constructed as a basis for synthesis of this 22 C. R. Orton, 'Quantitative Pottery Studies: Some Progess, Problems and Prospects', Science and Arch. xvi (1975), 30-5.</page><page sequence="20">122 P. D. CATHERALL quantified data and for the discussion of the Higham industry in the context of Romano- British coarse pottery production on the lower Thames. The sandy wares, including BB2, which are interpreted as being for the most part products of the Oakleigh Farm kilns.(whether of the four discovered or of others suspected of lying in the vicinity) are divided into 17 Gross Forms, which are in turn subdivided where numbers deem fit, into Vessel Types. Each of these Types is illustrated by one or more examples from the site, and their spatial distribution and cardinal characteristics are summarized. The archive, lodged with Rochester Museum includes more detailed information. Fabric analysis has been confined to inspection of a non-random sample of sherds of the ' "Kiln" Fabric' under a X 20 hand-lens, with reference to Peacock's Matrix for identification of inclusions.23 Fabric characteristics are described using the conventions adopted by Orton.24 Coarse pottery that does not fall within the ' "Kiln" Fabric' group is described briefly in Section III below. II. The Local, or ' "Kiln" Fabric' The probability that the bulk of the pottery found at Oakleigh Farm represents the rejected products of the local kilns carries the implication that the range of variation in details of the fabric is likely to be wider than that exhibited by those products deemed suitable for marketing. A certain amount of experimentation may be represented in the assemblage alongside stan- dardized products; for example No. 54, with moderate amounts of chalk in the fabric. Quartz is the predominant mineral inclusion, occurring in abundant quantities of ill-assorted grains of fine to coarse size (c. o I-I mm in diameter) with extremely sparse very coarse grains. The quartz is generally rounded and sub-angular with sparse angular grains, and is clear, translucent, 'grey' and white. Very fine white mica, and medium-size black iron ore (c. 0o25- 0o5 mm) are present in varying quantities but never as abundant as quartz, while very coarse grey and white flint (up to 5 mm) occurs in very sparse scatters in a proportion of the sherds, mostly in the coarser, less well-levigated fabrics. These inclusions may all have been derived from the sandy subsoil of the site. They give the surfaces of the sherds a rough, occasionally harsh, feel. Vessels were wheel-made, of finely irregular or irregular fracture, and of a hard- ness ranging from soft to very hard. The hardest sherds are often brittle and exhibit signs of vitrification. Fabric colours include shades of orange, buff, brown and grey to black; the fabric commonly revealing a 'sandwich' of one or more colour changes.25 Slips range from white through buff, brown and grey to black. In many cases the palest slips are associated with oxidized fabrics, suggesting a misfiring of the sherds as the norm for vessels of Oakleigh Farm forms on occupation sites in a grey to black slip. However, a handful of sherds exhibit a white slip on a reduced fabric (e.g. Nos. 3, 34 and 65), and this combination has occasionally been recognized on occupation sites (at Springhead on a rim of Form III-i, for example). Techniques of formal refinement include knife-trimming of dish chamfers, executed sub- sequent to the application of a slip. This may have been a feature solely of later production, as it has been positively identified only on Feature 4 sherds. Surfaces are frequently burnished, particularly on Gross Forms I-V, VII, X, XIII-XV; dishes were generally burnished overall and jars on the rim and upper exterior over the slip, and on the lower exterior (as No. 77). Surface deterioration has often resulted in the partial or total loss of slip on some vessels which might on formal grounds be expected to have been slipped. Base sherds of some dishes from 23 D. P.

(note 6), 67-1o3.</page><page sequence="21">A ROMANO-BRITISH POTTERY MANUFACTURING SITE AT OAKLEIGH FARM I23 the stokehole and interior of Kiln A exhibit concentric plain and burnished bases on the interior, a motif recorded also at Mucking 26 on vessels of Oakleigh Farm Forms I and III. Linear decoration is confined to wavy lines, right-angled and acute lattices and vertical or oblique repeated strokes (see Section IV). A number of the slipped and burnished forms fall within the fabric group of 'BB2' in accordance with the criteria expounded by Farrar.27 These include Forms I, III and XIV, which are common in the northern military zone."2 However, other Forms which satisfy Farrar's fabric criteria were also produced on the lower Thames and at Colchester, including Forms II, IV, V, VII, X, XIII, XIVa, XV and XVI iv at Oakleigh Farm. These types of vessel were evidently produced for local consumption only, and are rare in east Kent and London 29 in comparison with the numbers found in West Kent and south-east Essex. Their absence from the northern military zone does not provide a logical foundation for their exclusion from the category of BB2, although they have been overlooked by Farrar 30 and Williams.31 It is here proposed that these forms in slipped, burnished, sandy, reduced, wheel-thrown ware of 'BB2' fabric should be classified alongside the dishes and jars of Forms I, III and XIV as BB2. A case can also be made for the inclusion of burnished but unslipped vessels in this category, as there is some debate over whether slipping is an essential or optional feature of BB2.32 Other forms with these finishes were also produced by the lower Thames potteries, such as the flask and necked bulbous beaker.33 III. The other Roman Pottery (excluding samian) The range and quantity of wares that do not fall within the local fabric group are small and may be dealt with summarily. I.

Miscellaneous undesignated fine wares: a handful of bodysherds in fine grey, orange and buff micaceous wares, possibly from the Medway marshes 'Upchurch' industry 35 or other sources, and occurring primarily in the surface scatter around Kilns A and B. The only rim was in fine grey ware, cf. No. 53, possibly a 'poppyhead' beaker. One sherd was white- slipped, probably from a flagon from Feature I. 3. Buff ware, a rim sherd, possibly from a Baetican Dressel 20o amphora: from the stokehole of Kiln B. 4.

It is a frequent find in west Kent, south Essex and London, and is encountered occasionally further afield, for example at Rich- borough,37 and as far north as Cramond, Edinburgh.38 Production in the lower Thames is extremely likely.39 6. A handful of sherds in sandy fabrics containing temper of grog (from the upper level of Kiln A) or flint (stokehole of Kiln B). These may be residual first-century A.D. material, but the former could equally well be from a contemporary storage-jar, and the latter from undesignated mortaria. 7. Miscellaneous sandy wares. A small number of sherds in sandy wares somewhat at variance with the ' "Kiln" Fabric' were recovered from virtually all contexts (significantly excluding the homogeneous Kiln C stokehole assemblage).40 Two of these are illustrated: No. 29 - medium sandy grey with light-grey overall slip burnished in zones, and very coarse in- clusions of quartz and haematite in sparse quantities, wheel-thrown; and No. 68 - medium sandy micaceous grey with buff external margin and yellow-buff matt slip overall, wheel- thrown. These two vessels have been included in the quantification presented on TABLES I and 2 as it cannot be deemed certain that they are exotic. IV. The ' "Kiln" Fabric' Pottery: Probable Products of the Oakleigh Farm Industry The excavation of a kiln site almost invariably results in the recovery of large quantities of pottery, and Oakleigh Farm was no exception despite the small scale of the investigation. The following section presents a summary of the pottery, thought to represent that which was fired in the Oakleigh Farm kilns. Recourse has been made to tabular presentation of the quantified data (TABLES I and 2) and to the extensive use of abbreviations in describing indi- vidual vessels and the spatial distribution of vessel types.

No. 45 may be a freak of misfiring rather than a deliberate attempt at producing an 'over- sailing' rim, as the latter form is otherwise unknown in BB2 in Kent. The absence of decoration from No. 47 could conceivably have been an oversight on the part of the potter, as it is other- wise unparalleled in BB2, and may have resulted in the eventual rejection of the vessel, for the quality of firing and slip is high. Decoration on bodysherds, which on external parallels should be of GF XIV, includes open and grouped acute lattices, and evenly spaced vertical strokes.48 No. 50 provides a typological link with GF XVI, a point emphasized by the plain surface.

The roll-rim necked jar is an extremely common find in the south-east of Britain, with a date range covering the whole of the Roman period. In Kent, the hooked form is particularly characteristic of the late second to fourth centuries. The 'pendant-bead' frequently occurs in Essex on narrow-necked jars 51 and may be finger-pressed giving a 'pie-crust frill'.52 It can also occur on flasks 53 but is more common on wide-mouth jars 54 The frequency of un- burnished slips on GF XVI may reflect a desire to alleviate the roughness of feel at the rim without necessarily improving the visual appearance of the vessel. 49 e.g. at Highgate Wood in A.

No attempt has been made to quantify base sherds.55 Four forms have been recognized. The chamfered dish base (e.g. Nos. 7, I8, I9 and 24) appears to have served all dish types, and may be defined by knife-trimming or by a less sharp (templated ?) angle in the wall. The simple jar base, No. 76, probably served most jar forms, and is usually plain, as figured. The more delicate base, No. 77, is a unique sherd so far as Oakleigh Farm is concerned, and exhibits discrete tooled horizontal lines and a facet-burnished lower body on the exterior.

The pottery from this structure comprised almost solely vessels of GF III ii, with a high proportion of decorated sherds. External parallels date the decorated pie dish to c. A.D. 120-210,57 but it seems probable that production dropped markedly after the introduction of the 'plain' BB2 pie dish 58 c. A.D. I8o.59 The other sherds from this kiln, including a decorated dog-dish (GF I i),60 and the jars Nos. 56-7, are consistent with a date of infilling no later than the final decades of the second century. The presence of undecorated pie dishes in this kiln suggests that this infilling took place after c. A.D. I80 and the life of the kiln may be dated to within A.D. I60-80. Feature I. The absence of decorated pie dishes from this context, and the presence of a quantity of undecorated pie dishes, suggests a terminus post quem for the infilling of this feature later than c. A.D. I 80. It must be earlier than Kiln A, which indirectly cuts its fill and which may be dated to the mid-third century (below). The presence of a decorated dog-dish and the absence of bead-and-flange dishes (GF V) suggest a date no later than the first quarter of the third century for the filling of this feature, and by stratigraphic implication for Kiln D also. Kiln A. This kiln is unique amongst Kent kilns in containing a large group (totalling some 16 per cent of the pottery: TABLE I) of bead-and-flange dishes in its fill. The dating of the inception of this form in Romano-British pottery has been reviewed, from a northern stand- point, by Gillam,61 who points out that the earliest examples of the 'flanged bowl' 62 arrived no later than c. A.D. 2IO in the north. The BB2 bead-and-flange dish does not occur in the north, even at Carpow, where undecorated pie-dishes are present in military contexts as late as c. A.D. 215-16.63 Williams' petrological work has demonstrated that the lower Thames potteries could have been involved in the commerce between south and north in the late second and early third centuries,64 a trade which ceased by the middle of the latter century.65 The Cooling site, where possible kiln rejects of bead-and-flange dishes have been recorded 66 may have been a participant according to Williams' results. It is possible that the selective exportation of BB2 forms (Section II above) excluded bead-and-flange dishes, but the observable similarity in the ranges of BBI and BB2 forms in the north suggests that this is unlikely. It follows there- fore that this form was introduced in BB2 in or after the middle of the third century, but the presence of several such vessels in the late third-century cellar debris at Chalk,67 narrows this event down to some fifty or sixty years, say, between A.D. 230 and 290.

CATHERALL date is generally favoured.68 The fact that some decorated pie-dish sherds were incorporated in the second phase flue-fill of Kiln A suggests that this infilling took place quite early on in the life of the bead-and-flange dish, perhaps between A.D. 230 and 250. A terminus post quem for the kilns' construction is provided by Feature I (no later than the early third century), and the absence of decorated pie dishes from the stokehole of A (i.e. A.SH) supports a date later than c. A.D. 200. Kiln B. The general range of forms of pottery found in this kiln (TABLE I and Section IV) and the horizontal stratigraphy of the site combine to suggest a broad contemporaneity with Kiln A. However, the fill of the stokehole of B exhibits a more mixed pottery assemblage than is present in the other kilns, including a sherd of Oxfordshire ware (Section III.I) datable to c. A.D. 240+, 69but excluding the GF V iii type that predominates in Kiln A. It is unlikely therefore that the infilling of A and B was a single event, B possibly occuring somewhat later. Feature 4. The virtual absence of decorated dish sherds (Section IV) and the total absence of bead-and-flange dish sherds, suggest that this container was filled sometime between c. A.D. 190 and 240. This would suit the external dating of GF VIII to roughly the same period. However, the negative occurrence of GF V is rendered less reliable by the almost homogeneous nature of the F4 fill, which is dominated by GF III i and iii, suggesting that it represents for the most part the rejects of a single firing or set of firings. VI Discussion The Oakleigh Farm site is just one of several BB2/grey sandy ware kiln sites that have been excavated around the lower Thames and its hinterland in the 1970's. Others include Mucking,70 Orsett 71 and Billericay 72 in Essex, and New Ash Green 73 in Kent, to which may be added Cooling, where evidence of production takes the form of possible waste pottery.74 The pro- duction and distribution of BB2 was a major preoccupation of Romano-British coarse pottery studies during this decade, which brought forward a number of hypotheses that can only be tested adequately when the large body of fresh data from both kiln and occupation sites has been published and assimilated. An intensive study of Roman pottery in Kent, currently in the final stages of preparation, incorporates extensive discussion of the production and dis- tribution of these wares south of the Thames and in southern Essex.75 It is clear that the potteries of the Hoo Peninsula, including Oakleigh Farm, Chalk 76 and Cooling were in close contact with those of the Thurrock area of Essex, on the opposite bank of the Thames. There is a close typological affinity between these two groups of kiln sites in both their environment (essentially rural) and the pottery produced by them. Minor typological variations are apparent, for example the diamond-rouletting, roller-stamping and pedestal bases of Orsett 77 and Mucking are unparalleled on Kent kiln sites, although roller-stamped sherds have been recovered at Lullingstone and Springhead (as yet unpublished). The absence of decorated pie-dishes and bead rim jars (GF IX) from Essex kiln sites known to the present author may reflect a later commencement of production in the BB2 tradition in southern 68 See note 29. 69 See note 2. 70 See note 26. 71 H.

It should also be recorded that the evidence for pre-Hadrianic production of BB2, accepted at face value by Williams,84 has been refuted by the present author on the grounds that the handful of vessels believed to represent such production could be intrusive from the nature of their contexts.85 Oakleigh Farm GF V, VIII, XIII and XV, and Mucking Types O, Q and R (possibly pro- duced also at Cooling), exhibit an interesting spatial distribution from which it can be inferred that the primary markets for Hoo Peninsula wares in the late second and third centuries lay in that part of Kent bounded on the west by the Cray valley and on the east by the Forest of Blean, and to the south by the Greensand ridge, beyond which Roman settlement (in the Weald) was sparse. This area is, very approximately, some I,4oo km2 in size. Beyond these boundaries GF I, III and XIV may have been traded, for these types occur in quantity in east Kent during this period, and also in the northern military zone, some at least probably being from north Kent.86 It is assumed that the potteries north of the Thames supplied southern Essex. 7" V. G. Swan, personal communication, has suggested that a small migration of Kent potters may have taken place. 79 See note 26. 80 Information from M. U. Jones. 81 M. R. Hull, Roman Colchester (Soc.

AN INTERIM NOTE ON THE PLANT REMAINS CONTAINED IN THE FIRED CLAY STRUCTURE OF KILN A, by M. A. Monk. During the rescue excavation of a series of kilns threatened by the Isle of Grain gas pipeline, it was noted by the excavator that the fired clay sub-structure of the kiln (its central pillar) contained dense concentrations of plant remains. Subsequently, several of these kiln fragments were dispatched to this author for archaeo- botanical examination. Initial observation showed that plant matter was present in both the oxidized and reduced kiln pieces. The density of organic material was quite startling (about 60-70 per cent of the mass) and had obviously been included in the clay as a binding. The remains of the plant material had been preserved (using that term broadly) in three ways: (I) As silica bodies (preserved sheets of silicified epidermal cells of the grass family).95 (2) As impressions in the clay. Hollows remain in the clay where the plant fragments had been burnt out by the heat from the kiln but the baked clay had retained the impression. (3) As positives. In contrast to the mode of preservation by impression, the clay/mineral substance had taken the place of the burnt-out matter. This came about when the kiln was fired beyond the melting point of clay, causing its collapse into the long burnt-out impressions of the organic material, where on re-hardening the clay took on the exact shape of the im- pressions. This would mean that particularly high temperatures were being reached in the kiln.96 A close examination of sub-samples of the remains indicated that the major plant com- ponent in the clay was cereal straw with some 'chaff' and several grains of barley (Hordeum sativum). A microscopic examination of the silica bodies which were found lining the impressions and the positives of both straw and grains (silica bodies are almost indestructible even when plant remains are subjected to burning) revealed a cell structure that was similar to that of barley, although identification to species on this criterion or on the basis of the impressions was not possible. In addition several of the impressions and positives had the appearance of oat grains (Avena sp.). Here again specific identification was not possible, so it was not feasible to decide whether the grains were from wild or domestic oats. A further study is in progress on plant remains from several other clay fragments from this kiln and it is hoped that this will yield more specific information. The preponderance of cereal remains, in particular of straw and chaff, would indicate that this material was waste from the threshing floor. The occurrence of barley chaff as a temper in pottery has been discussed elsewhere.97 The reasons for organic tempering in this instance are probably very similar to those given for the incorporation in pottery, particularly to bind the clay together and to withstand thermal shock by reducing the plasticity of the clay and therefore its shrinkage.98 The use of organic matter in the construction of iron furnaces in Africa and as moulds for casting bells in the medieval period is thought to have performed a similar function, though in these cases animal manure containing organic matter was being used. It is difficult to be sure from the botanical evidence presented here, but it is unlikely that animal manure is involved, partly because the plant matter would be more fragmented if it had passed through the digestive tract of an animal and partly because if, as seems likely, 95 J.

This is not to say that animal manure could not also have been incorporated into the clay alongside the apparently undigested chaff element. It seems also according to Hodges, op. cit. (note 96), that the incorporation of silica in whatever form is often added to finer clays with a low flux content to produce the lining and furniture of fired clay used in kilns. It is possible that the 'chaff' was performing this function. Whatever the source of this cereal based temper its importance in the construction of Roman kilns is an important issue that deserves further investigation.</page></plain_text>
