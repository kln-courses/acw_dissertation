Early specimens of maize from tropical American are readily available, but consist primarily of cobs or kernels alone rather than complete ears. Thus, classi- fication of prehistoric races of maize has been largely limited to cob characteristics. Inspired by the late Paul C. Mangelsdorf's Corn: Its Origin, Evolution, and Im- provement (1974), Mary W. Eubanks presents here im- portant information gleaned from pre-Columbian ce- ramic urns and effigy jars. As the external features of ears of corn are often clearly visible in the pottery, local races of corn can be identified and characterized, thus contributing not only to a knowledge of corn di- versity, but can also be used to trace ancient human trade and migration routes. The ethnic groups that pro- duced this pottery include the Moche of northern Peru, and the Zapotec of southern Mexico. What type of scientist would be capable of inte- grating elements of archaeology, corn genetics, nu- merical taxonomy, and art history into such a highly useful volume as Corn in Clay? None could be more qualified than Eubanks who, after earning a doctorate in anthropology, devoted years to studying genetics and systematic botany. Currently, she is a senior re- search scientist at Duke University where her research and often controversial views are increasingly gaining attention. Among other contributions, she was the first to reproduce an extinct strain of maize for cultivation. The introductory chapter is followed by "Moche Ef- figy Jars" (chapter 2), "Zapotec Urns" (chapter 3), "Corn in the Clay: Races of Maize on Pre-Columbian Pottery" (chapter 4), and "Prehistoric Races of Maize and Cultured Diffusion" (chapter 5). Scattered throughout are 134 black-and-white photographs de- picting urns, jars, molds, and other ceramic figures, many of them anthropomorphic. All students of maize genetics and evolution, pre- Columbian archaeology, and related areas will wish to examine closely this important and enjoyable book.</page><page sequence="2">244 ECONOMIC BOTANY [VOL. 54 THOMAS E.
