<plain_text><page sequence="1">"We're Not Dealing with Naturalism Here": An Interview with Angela Carter Angela Carter Susan Bernofsky I had the great fortune and privilege to meet Angela Carter in the fall of 1989, when she was in residence in the Writing Program at Washington University in St. Louis. For a few short weeks, a hand ful of students were able to listen to her tell her wonderful stories, critique our work, and, above all, talk about literature and writing. This interview was conducted on October 9, 1989, shortly before her return to England, where she was soon diagnosed with the cancer that was to take her life in 1992. Publishing it now, just after the tenth anniversary of her death, seems an appropriate tribute. Carter, whose novels include The Infernal Desire Machines of Doctor Hoffman, The Passion of New Eve, Nights at the Circus, and Wise Children, also published several collections of stories— among them the classic collections The Bloody Chamber and Saints and Strangers—and two nonfiction books, as well as poems, journalistic pieces, and radio scripts. She wrote screenplays for the films The Company of Wolves and The Magic Toyshop, and trans lated a volume of Charles Perrault's fairy tales. A native of Sussex, England, Carter lived in Japan and the United States as well, teach ing at Brown University, the University of Texas, Austin, and the University of Iowa. Her fiction received the Somerset Maugham Award, the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize, and the Cheltenham Festival of Literature Award. Susan Bernofsky: One of the first things one notices about your work is the illusory nature of the world your characters inhabit. In Nights at the Circus, for instance, you take a journalist and let his world of hard facts be subsumed into that of the circus, where things are more illusory and mutable. 161</page><page sequence="2">Angela Carter Angela Carter: Yes, but Jack Walser's profession is a function of the plot as much as anything else. He's primarily an adventurer, and that's how he's become a journalist. He's supposed to rather look like and be based on the young Jack London, who did some terrific jour nalism in London in the 1900s. The most important thing about him is that he hasn't experienced his experience as experience. He doesn't believe himself to have any inner life at the beginning of the novel. At the end of the novel, of course, he has nothing but inner life. Some people read the whole novel as being dedicated to absolutely and rit ually humiliating this nice young man. I don't see it that way at all. What happens to him in the wilderness is that he gets emptied out, he just gets emptied out and filled up with new stuff. Bernofsky: Isn't Nights at the Circus filled with creators of illu sion? There's the bird woman who goes by the stage name Fewers, and the Grand Duke who almost imprisons her in one of his jeweled eggs. Carter: Actually the Grand Duke is an inhabitant of Andrei Bely's St. Petersburg, an inhabitant of a certain fictional city, Pushkin's St. Petersburg, I suppose in a way, which is kind of strange around the edges. That's where he lives and that's where he comes from. The Grand Duke's house has got a detail on its portico which comes directly from St. Petersburg, in case people notice it. A capripede caryatid. It's only a tiny one, a goat-shaped caryatid. I didn't want to pick anything that would stand out. It was just a small indication as to the kind of house it is, that it's a house in an imaginary place where other people have lived as well, if that doesn't seem too whim sical. A sign of what kind of narrative it is really. Bernofsky: Your characters help show this, too—they tend to say to the reader, careful, don't put too much faith in us. Fewers's slogan is "Is she fact or is she fiction?" Carter: Yes, but they're very three-dimensional characters. So much fiction is taken up with people pouring out cups of coffee and lighting cigarettes. One of the imitations of a real novel that goes on in Nights at the Circus is that they're always doing that, there's all this stuff called "character" that they all have. They've all got these rounded, three-dimensional characters that were built up, you know, through bits of business and so on. Like acting of the British school. The thing is that this sort of thing is a lot more fun to read than it is to write. I always feel I'm cheating the reader when I write "he said," 162</page><page sequence="3">Angela Carter "she said," all that. It's filling up space. To load every action so that it has some sort of character significance is actually more fun, that's something that's a project, a serious project. But I wanted to have a real sense of nineteenth-century solidity about Nights at the Circus. Obviously when one of the leading players is a clairvoyant pig, you've got to be very scrupulous about the techniques of the sus pension of disbelief. I really wanted people to feel for that pig, be moved by its predicament when it looks like it's going to get eaten. Bernofsky: I was. Carter: I'm very glad, I'm very fond of the pig Sophia, too. Actually I use that name a lot, Sophie, Sophia. My great-aunt was called Sophie, a reasonably common Victorian nineteenth-century English woman's name, but also it's the name of the Gnostic goddess of wis dom, and therefore I tend to give it to characters either because they have a particular grasp of the way things work or because they have none. I use it either positively or ironically. Fewers's real name is Sophie. But she's too young to be wise, as her foster mother keeps reminding her. Bernofsky: It's a name that's also important for Andrei Bely. Carter: Yes, for the same reason. Except he was more obsessive about the cabala and the occult than 1.1 picked up on Sophia because my aunt was called Sophie. Bernofsky: As characters, are the apes in Nights at the Circus in a different class than the pig Sophia, since apes lend themselves so much more readily to anthropomorphism? Carter: The apes are led by a man called Lamarck, and the point about the apes is that they learn to read and write, and it's the inher itance of acquired characteristics: as soon as they learn to read and write they read their own contract, tear it up, and renegotiate it. They don't have vocal cords. The one thing that holds the higher primates back is the inability to speak. Which is why people have tried to teach them to sign. Bernofsky: Which has been done. Carter: It's moot, actually. What they do depends very much on who's interpreting them. Not on the degree of sympathy which exists in the person who's working with the apes, but on how anthro pomorphic the interpretation is. I've followed all this vaguely, not 163</page><page sequence="4">Angela Carter very intensely, but there is this assumption which is in Dr. Doolittle books that if the apes would speak, they would speak things which are of interest to us, and in fact they probably won't, they'll speak things which are of interest to apes, which might be quite different. I mean, in a very, very small way, this is what the Colonel is angry about in Nights at the Circus, that the first thing they do when they leam to read is to read their contracts. He wouldn't have expected that. He would have expected them to want to stand in the arena and recite, you know, "To be or not to be." And of course they flee the debacle, they escape the debacle by taking the train out to Helsinki. Bernofsky: In The Passion of New Eve . . . Carter: One of my more obscure books in this country, it hasn't been reprinted since it came out here. Bernofsky: That's strange to me; it's one of my favorites among your novels. Carter: It's one of my favorites, too. But its publishing history here was kind of dire, actually. Bernofsky: Because of the portrayal of America in it? Carter: I don't know. I've noticed that Americans tend to like negative depictions of the U.S. It was to do with other things, with particular convulsions in my then publishers, and also it's a difficult book, a difficult novel. Bernofsky: Was the book's eroticism a problem for American readers? Carter: No, I don't think so. It's written in quite a high style, it isn't an easy read. The novel declares its intentions, its parameters, I think, straightaway by quoting Rilke. That indicates that it's aiming for a certain kind of seriousness. Including a certain kind of linguis tic seriousness. That means it's not going to be, you know, on the New York Times bestseller list. And also it is very, very bleak in its view of the world, its view of sexual relations, human relations. I do think it's good, though. I like it, I like it a lot. There are bits that are put together with spit and glue, there are bits where the writing's very flawed, but some of it I think is not. Bernofsky: I'm tempted to see in Evelyn's journey from East to West a mirror image of Jack Walser's West-to-East journey. Though 164</page><page sequence="5">Angela Carter one book is far more bleak, they both involve journeys the characters make in the process of learning who they are. Carter: I had a plan at that time, when I started Hoffman, that I would do three picaresque novels, so that in fact although this proj ect took much longer than I thought it would, those three novels all have a journey in common, the picaresque. In the very simplest terms, they're all about a journey from here to there. Crossing the continent is important in New Eve, and crossing the desert. I origi nally wanted Eve to set off on the sea at the very end of the novel, from Florida. The state was named Florida because the conquista dores smelled the flowers—the first indication they were reaching land was the perfume of the flowers blowing out from the shore. I'd planned for that to happen, for her to go out in her little boat and smell the flowers. There were problems, though. For one thing, there was no way of getting to Florida through a desert; they would have had to make an immense detour. Bernofsky: And it would have destroyed the trajectory of the novel, that straight line. Carter: That's right. Also the ruins of Hollywood at the end are very important. Because in some ways it's about Hollywood. Bernofsky: Each of these characters, too, is transplanted from the other continent: Jack Walser is an American transplanted and Eve lyn's an Englishman in America. Carter: Yes, and this is part of the picaresque mode. It's common to all three novels. The person who's the central figure has to be a traveler, otherwise the story literally can't get on the road. Eve had to be English, British because I am. I couldn't possibly have invented Americanness as a narratorial voice, I simply couldn't have. I would get the language wrong, I would get everything wrong, he would have the wrong things for breakfast. His relation to the hallucinated New York of the beginning would be quite different. One or two of the details in that first chapter are from things that actually hap pened to friends of mine who were working there in the early sixties. I don't mean any of the sex and violence, but one or two odd things happened. A native New Yorker—I know we're not dealing with nat uralism here—a native New Yorker would never have put himself in the situations that Evelyn puts himself into in the first part of the novel. It's not possible. The Latin American country in The Infernal 165</page><page sequence="6">Angela Carter Desire Machines of Doctor Hoffman is a pure invention and there fore I could invent Desiderio and I felt quite happy about that. I think writing, inventing a character, especially a first-person narrator out side your own culture, is almost impossible. I can't think of anybody who's done it successfully. Bernofsky: Are there advantages to looking at America from the outside? Carter: There's lots of things about the States, lots of the physical detail Europeans pick up on that nobody here pays any attention to at all. I was thinking about this the other day. Near where I live in London there's the big showroom of a firm called Classic Americana. They sell fifties cars, cars I've seen on the streets here. The ones with fins and chrome and everything. That's what they're in business doing; they sell them to musicians, people who just love them. It's not even a particularly camp thing, it's just that people have an obsession, often with the visual texture of the U.S., that a lot of Americans just can't understand, they think it's strange. Well, they can't understand because they don't see it, you never see what's around you. Bernofsky: There are other American things you pick up on, for instance in your short story " 'Tis Pity She's a Whore" that has the two John Fords in it. Carter: I've always mixed up the two John Fords in my mind, and it seemed that " 'Tis Pity She's a Whore" would make a wonderful Western. Bernofsky: This story's not only about the two different Fords but also about the different media, film and fiction and drama, isn't it? Carter: I don't know. I mean, I like the movies and there are ways in which that particular landscape, the plains, was built for cinema,· cinema had to be invented to represent it, to show it, to display it, the size of it, the enormous size of it. You sit in this small dark place and you see this immense space, this immense distance on the screen, which is a paradoxical state. Obviously, of course, it's impos sible to conceive of John Ford directing this story as a Western. It contains all the elements about life that it was impossible for the Western in its great days to even begin to hint at. That's why at one stage in it the girl wears a yellow ribbon. It's impossible to imagine the great John Ford Westerns being about the kind of tragedies, 166</page><page sequence="7">Angela Carter deaths, and transgressions which we know took place in those small communities. I was thinking about William Gass's story "The Peder sen Kid." You know, Ford wouldn't have touched that. Bernofsky: There are undercurrents in Ford, though, aren't there? There's that moment in The Searchers when John Wayne is ready to kill his niece, Natalie Wood, because she's been kidnapped and raped by Indians—she's now, in a sense, spoiled goods. Carter: That's getting towards it, there are areas of darkness in some of the films, hints of darkness, which are usually to do with the relation to the Indians. The idea that premarital intercourse might occasionally take place in these small communities on the prairies is not on the whole encouraged in the Western as a genre, and that it might take place between siblings is a definite no-no. Even though I assume that those small farms were hotbeds of it. But I suppose I would. Bernofsky: How did you come to write about Lizzie Borden, in "The Fall River Axe Murders"? Carter: I was living a few miles from Fall River for about ten years, and I was very struck by the industrial dereliction of New England, those old industrial towns, those old mill towns in northeast Mas sachusetts, Rhode Island. The murder, of course, is a great local event, one of the things that everybody knows about Fall River, per haps the only thing that everybody now knows about Fall River. I read a lot around it, about it; a friend of mine also used to teach her in an American history course. Bernofsky: In Saints and Strangers there's a note saying that the American version of this story differs from the one in the British edi tion. Did you make it different for Americans? Carter: It's slightly different only in that the British reprinted a rather shorter version of the Lizzie Borden story that had appeared in a British magazine, and when it was published in the U.S. I thought that I would work on it some more. I spent ages on the story, ages and ages and ages, and there's a whole lot of extra material lying around somewhere which will never see the light of day, I guess, now. I'd never really been happy with it before. It's only very slight ly longer in the American version, but I just wanted some more in it, I wanted some more detail. It looks the same, it's got the same begin ning and end, but the organization inside is slightly different. 167</page><page sequence="8">Angela Carter Bernofsky: The story itself talks about excluding material. There's an old relative in the house, and the story says he's not terribly rele vant, so let's throw him out. Carter: Yes, this is one of the things you can do in fiction. Bernofsky: In an interview about five years ago you said you'd once believed that all writing, all fiction, was somehow about other fic tion, other stories—then you said you'd changed your mind about this. Many of your stories in one way or another come from other stories, most obviously in The Bloody Chamber, but in much of your other work as well. Carter: I don't think I said that absolutely positively, I think I may have said I was beginning to wonder how, if culture was as self referential as that, anything new ever got into it. I'm very much con cerned with what the culture-worker produces when he or she works at producing culture. It's something that's quite important. Bernofsky: By "culture-worker," do you mean the writer spe cifically? Carter: No. This is a term used in Scandinavia which in fact is quite culturally specific to the situation of artists in a society that's organized a bit differently than this one. I just mean people who pro duce the stuff, fiction of all kinds, fiction in the shape of movies. I don't use the word "culture" lightly—but also I don't use it narrowly. I use it neither lightly nor narrowly [laughs]. I use it in the anthro pological sense as much as in the aesthetic definition sense. A cul ture is the total material mix, what surrounds one. I don't think that literature is any different from anything else in that respect. It's a part of culture which is produced by people living in culture. To a very large extent it gets filtered through them. It's actually impos sible to be original, it just is, if you're a human being, if you come from any existing cultural context. When I was living in Japan there was this kind of peculiar tension, especially in the theater, the avant garde, because so many of the techniques of traditional Japanese the ater—the intense stylization of Kabuki and No and so on, and the kind of mix of music and drama, which to most Japanese was very, very old hat—was at the absolute cutting edge of innovation in Europe. The Japanese tend to look towards Europe for innovation and they found bits of their own past. I think it must be like that to be somebody from Oceania walking around an exhibition of, oh, I 168</page><page sequence="9">Angela Carter don't know, contemporary sculpture. They must think: goodness me, that's old-fashioned! The stories in The Bloody Chamber aren't derived from existing texts, anyway. They're derived from sources in the oral tradition, which I have a special relation with, I guess, and which is dying out now. The acceleration of the death of traditional cultures has happened. In my lifetime. By the time you were bom it was almost over. I think it's probably television that's done it. Bernofsky: You've also translated Perrault's fairy tales. Carter: That was a by-product. They were there. The little col lection of stories that Perrault made were there, and they're in fairly simple French, and I did some work on them and part of that was doing the small translation. I'm told, quite kindly, that it's not extraordinarily accurate. People have offered to correct my French. Bernofsky: Did someone ask you to put together the book of translations? Carter: No, it was a small project I set myself, when I was moving house, it was something I could pick up and then put down again. Unlike some of the other things which aren't so easily portable. Working on somebody else's writing is a little more portable than working on your own. Bernofsky: In the afterword to Fireworks you wrote that you found yourself living in a small room and started writing shorter pieces. Carter: That was partly a joke, but I was living in a small room when I started most of the pieces in Fireworks. Bernofsky: Did that have to do with being in a foreign country, doing smaller, more portable things? Carter: Well, no, you don't have to live in a small room just be cause you're in a foreign country. I moved to a much bigger place pretty soon and then I wrote a long novel. Just before I started living in Japan, I'd read Borges for the first time, and I was full of excite ment about the possibilities of short fiction. I'd not been able to see the point of it much before. But the Borges stories really, really ex cited me. Bernofsky: Any particular ones? Carter: The book I read first was the one I think everybody reads first, Labyrinths. These are still the stories I remember, I can 169</page><page sequence="10">Angela Carter remember them in hallucinatory detail. All the stories in Labyrinths I think are wonderful. The dictionary story, "Tlôn, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius." I still think about that one, I think about it a lot, particu larly when I'm in the States, it seems in some way allegorical, in some way it seems to be about the United States, that story. Bernofsky: The invented world that's invented through its ency clopedia? Carter: Well, the way this world puts itself, the way this world inserts itself into the real world. Lots of people of my generation have this reaction to Borges. It was one of the great events of the sixties, I suppose. Those stories, the way that they approach the world, seemed to hold a lot of possibilities. Bernofsky: You've mentioned Calvino as being very important for you, too. Was he a similar sort of discovery? Carter: I like Calvino a lot, but it's not the same, I don't have that same feeling of wonder and excitement when I read Invisible Cities. He read Borges, too. They derive from the same kind of excitement, I think. He probably read Borges much earlier than I did. I think Borges was translated into European languages earlier than he was into English. And when Calvino started out, well, his career's very interesting. He has some early stories about the partisans which are very straightforward. Bernofsky: Would you tell me a little about the anthology you're editing, the fairy-tale book? Carter: I'm just doing that for Virago, a feminist publishing house in Britain. It's a sort of spin-off on some of the work I've been doing in one way or another with traditional material. That's all it is. The stories all come from books, some of them pretty obscure. The vagaries of my research, the vagaries of the particular library I've been using most, have had a great effect on the shape of the collec tion. A lot of the material reflects the ideology of the people who did the collecting as much as anything else, and that's quite interesting to me. One or two cultures, very few of them, have got things against women telling stories. On the whole, in my experience, it's about fifty-fifty, with maybe women having a slight edge as the performers and interpreters of traditional culture. A lot of it is kind of specific to certain activities, but certainly as far as singing, as far as musical per formance—which is what I've seen most, you know, in action— 170</page><page sequence="11">Angela Caitei women do just as much as men do, if not more. And the collectors on the whole tended to pick out stories that don't have female protagonists, although there are dozens of them. Which, I assume, means that they tended on the whole to be able to relate better to men. At any time. Bernofsky: Do the men's stories just center more on male charac ters, or is it not that simple? Carter: It's the old story, you do get stories with princesses who get out and do things which are told by men, but on the whole the bias does tend to be more towards comic tales and tales of heroics and cunning and so on, and it's men talking, men's storytelling. I haven't really been looking out for them. But there are all kinds of things about this that interest me, that there's no such thing—I really do believe this—there's no such thing as a pure art, there's all kinds filtered through various lenses. It never comes to us pure, we don't make it pure, in a pure state. Bernofsky: You wrote once that tales don't so much log everyday experience as interpret it and therefore can't betray the reader into a false knowledge of everyday experience. Do you consider all your stories tales? Carter: I wrote that piece in 1974, when Fireworks was reissued in London. It was reissued again in Britain a couple of years ago, and I removed that essay because it seemed most of the things I said in it then are now self-evident, there was no reason to go on about them. There's a lot I'm not terribly interested in, and I guess what I was trying to say about the tale was just describing the kind of fic tion I'm interested in. In 1974, it was really before a lot had gotten into the bloodstream that seems to be in the bloodstream now. It was before semiotics, the theory of representations, the relation between the representation and reality, I'm very interested in that. I think that all artists work in that gap. Some of them are more aware of it than others. Bernofsky: Have these representations themselves really changed, or is it just the way in which people describe them? Carter: I don't think it's just their descriptions, I think it's more complicated than that. The novel is a form which is two hundred years old, it's very, very new. The particular kind of imitation of bourgeois experience which is characteristic of the American novel 171</page><page sequence="12">Angela Carter at the moment is very new indeed, it's less than a hundred years old, I'd say. And people have been telling other stories, people have been trying to make sense of the world through reinventing it since the beginning of time. It's like easel painting, which is very specific to a small part of the world. It has never existed anywhere else but in Western Europe. From the late sixteenth century to—well, it's still around. This is a tiny, tiny little bit of the human habit of making marks, of making images. There's not a great deal of cultural relativ ity in our culture. Bernofsky: We're not aware enough of other sorts of image makers? Carter: The obsession with, the conviction of their own impor tance that artists have acquired in Western European culture—and, being a good Japanese, I would include America in Europe—seems to me kind of strange. Bernofsky: You wrote once about a certain kind of writing, in the tradition of Poe, that it retains a singular moral function, that of pro voking unease. Carter: I haven't got a particularly quirky definition of moral. I suppose what I meant was that it's important for human beings to continually question their circumstances if they want to retain their humanity. Basically, to keep on asking yourself what's going on all the time. That's what I meant. I think we owe it to ourselves as a species to keep our eye on what's going on. 172</page></plain_text>
