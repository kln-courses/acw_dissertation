Czeslaw Milosz The Captive Mind Introduction The scale of the problem of writing in a new language is suggested with especial force and finesse by the title of the Polish-Canadian writer Eva Hoffman's autobiography: Lost in Translation: Life in a New Language (1989). The second half of the title answers the question implicitly posed by the first: it is the immigrant's life which is imagined as "lost in translation,'' by analogy with the meaning of a literary text. "Lost" moreover punningly refers to the author herself, who is at once lost, as in a maze or fog, in the activity of translating from Polish into English cultural perspectives ? and in danger of losing her very self in the course of the translation. The metaphor of fidelity to an original is an especially suggestive one in the context of an immigrant's life: are the cultural assumptions with which he or she arrives susceptible to extension and revision, and to what extent can a "selP be identified with them? In a special way, problems of translation pertain as much to "selves" inducted into a new language as to texts to be rendered in a new linguistic code. In this article I will be examining some of the issues surrounding textual translation and a concomitant "self-translation" as they emerge in the work of another Pole in America: in some translations from his own originals by the poet Czeslaw Milosz. If for Hoffman, remaking oneself within the parameters of an alien language is like translating an intricate and elusive text, the English versions of some of Milosz's poems indicate that questions of self-translation may inhere in the subtlest of slippages between words. The problems facing Milosz as an expatriate writer would at first appear to be almost the converse of Hoffman's: those of a writer who chooses to continue to write in his native language. Milosz's loss is most obviously that of a potential American readership, rather than of his Polish identity. But a closer look at the specific choices he makes in his translations shows Milosz 415</page><page sequence="2">416 The Polish Review to be confronted by questions of a similar order to those encountered by Hoffman, the fundamental one being, what sort of confluence is possible between two different conceptual worlds? Whether an immigrant writes in his mother tongue or adjusts to a "foster tongue," he is still forced to live in the second language's sphere. Language And Exile: The Problem Of Readership During the Nazi occupation of Poland Milosz was active in underground circles, and he edited a well-known anthology of anti-Nazi poetry. After the war he joined the Polish Foreign Service and from 1946 to 1950 served as a diplomat in Washington. After breaking with the communist regime in 1951 (when he was their cultural attache in Paris), he lived for several years in France, emigrating to the United States permanently in 1960. By the time of his second arrival there he had published The Captive Mind (1953), an analysis of the "mental acrobatics" East European intellectuals were forced to perform in accepting Stalinist dogmas, and this, along with the translations of his poetry that began to appear, brought him rapid renown. As Milosz himself notes in The History of Polish Literature (1969), the fact of his belonging to the group of writers who emigrated only after "a period of activity" (p. 529) in People's Poland, did not endear him to the emigre intelligentsia. He characterizes these readers as presenting "not a very high intellectual level" (p. 522), their "conservative taste" turning to the "familiar, the imitative, and thus, the second-rate." Rather than allaying their suspicions, The Captive Mind, on Milosz's own account, aroused further hostility, "attacked in the emigre press as tainted with Hegelianism and Marxism" (p. 529). The older emigrants in the United States and France, mostly of peasant descent, were a no less discouraging audience, tending either to parochialism or a wholesale assimilation into their host cultures. Milosz's essay "Prywatne obowiazki wobec polskiej literatury" [Private Obligations to Polish Literature] (Prywatne obowiazki, 1964) offers a series of important insights into his position as a Polish expatriate continuing to write in his native language in an English-speaking world. The slightly oxymoronic title is in fact a highly condensed formulation of Milosz's dilemma, whether to write in English or in Polish. How can an obligation be private, especially one owed to an entire national literature ? the exacting pressure of which is itself probably a notion in need of translating. Milosz's essay is, at one level, a response to a particularly Polish accusation, with which he was charged after his break with the regime in 1951. The Polish poet Galczyhski launched this attack in the baldly titled "Poem for a Traitor" (1951): Milosz has "exchanged Poland for a suitcase" and will be punished in exile by a loss of his creative powers. (Indeed, in The Captive Mind Milosz himself describes the prospect of exile, as he saw it</page><page sequence="3">Miiosz Translated by Milosz 411 immediately after the war, in similar terms: a[it was] the worst of all misfortunes, for it meant sterility and inaction" (p. xi).) For all that "Poem for a Traitor" trades in fairly crude party propaganda, its message derives special force (Milosz evidently feels it keenly) from a certain patriotic tradition. In an essay on Joseph Conrad's father in the same collection (an English version is included in Emperor of the Earth (1977)) Milosz provides an example which, in the light of his diary entry, is charged with personal significance: The father's character does much to explain why Conrad was so wounded by an article by Eliza Orzeszkowa (a celebrated "positivist" novelist who wrote about many contemporary social problems) denouncing his "betrayal." In her opinion the betrayal consisted in writing in English, bestowing his talent upon another country. (P. 183.) The accusation of betrayal draws on a particular understanding of the role of a writer in relation to his country which, despite common Romantic antecedents with contemporary writing in English, may strike readers of the English as extreme ? even in comparison with a poet like Seamus Heaney's exploration of a political side to his vocation. Of course, it arises out of Poland's specific historical circumstances as a country long subject to foreign rule; the Polish for "to serve" (i.e., one's country) is, even in Milosz's rather iconoclastic perspective, an expression full of urgency, without the somewhat pompous associations the English word has attracted. "Private Obligations ..." is an attempt to justify the author's life abroad by redefining the terms of "service" to national literature. It reveals conflicting feelings about the author's choice to write in Polish ? and its implications. On the one hand, Milosz makes the claim that only Polish literature written with a critical distance from "the Polish Question," and the Poles' attendant view of themselves, mired in what Milosz calls "martyr complexes," can substantially contribute to world literature. He cites the examples of Witold Gombrowicz and Slawomir Mrozek, both expatriates. In his own case, his life in America offers him the necessary outsider's angle; indeed, he admits to emphasizing his Lithuanian connections largely for their value as a metaphor of "corning from without" (przyjscia spoza) (p. 81). On the other hand, Milosz implicitly defends himself against accusations such a Galczyrlski's by comparing himself with Conrad and Nabokov, who clearly represent a hypothetical Milosz: It's not true that, if one wanted to, one couldn't become perfectly inward1 with another language, even without the natural talents of a Vladimir Nabokov ? 1. The Polish word przyswoid is closer to "tame" or "domesticate."</page><page sequence="4">418 The Polish Review who was in any case already a master of pastiche and the counterfeiting of styles, in Russian. The point is, with all due respect to Nabokov's sturining artistry . . . would I really want to be the author of books like his? No. Perhaps his extraordinary achievement as an immigrant, harnessing the powers of English as no one, bar Conrad, had ever done, was in the event made possible by some secret flaw or taint. [My translation.] (P. 81.) Milosz surely underestimates the difficulty for a non-Nabokov of adjusting to writing in another language. At any rate his suggestion of an inherent superficiality in Nabokov's linguistic remaking of himself does not necessarily extend to Conrad, with whom Milosz in many respects appears to identify. His comment in the essay on Conrad's father that the writer "did remain faithful in his own way to 'an idea without a tomorrow' [the Polish Question]" could serve as the submerged autobiographical motif of Milosz's own essay on "private" obligations. But Milosz undoubtedly intends the comparison to highlight his continuing loyalty to his native Polish. The "battle" against Polish provinciality, that is, the Poles' obsessive focus on their own "Question," as he is quick to explain, and not the country's geographical dimensions or location (p. 79), can be engaged in "only within the borders of the Polish language itself" (p. 82). What this means for Milosz, as he implies in the essay, is resignation to a more or less distinguished anonymity in the West. In attempting, according to his privately intuited obligation, to expand the reluctant horizons of Polish readers, who, goads Milosz, are concerned only with "being Polish" (defined as sitting on top of one another and keeping watch over potential leaners-out - p. 87), he in an obvious sense contracts his own possibilities. He foregoes the readership of a Conrad, becomes a specialist's poet. A dream he records in Rok my$liwego [The Year of the Hunter] (1991), his journals for the year 1987-1988, encapsulates his sense of his relationship with his American public: The dream about my long speech in Polish, which isn't translated, and which no one in the audience understands. It is to reach this lost audience, at least indirectly, that Milosz has undertaken the thorny task of translating himself ? likely as it is to involve losses and betrayals of the Polish self. Milosz Translated By Milosz: Lost And Caught In Translation Milosz has admitted to not liking to translate his own poetry (Prywatne obowis&amp;ki - p. 9), although in fact a considerable portion of the published English translations of it are his own work. In the same context he describes himself as holding "obstinately" to Polish when composing his poems and</page><page sequence="5">Milosz Translated by Milosz_419 essays, the things which "count most," and this stance is no doubt related to the admission made by him in the same book, of finding something slightly disturbing in Nabokov's facility with English. Milosz's translations, when compared with the originals, provide an often illuminating entry into the process of self-translation from Polish into English ? on which he is perhaps (and for similar reasons) as reluctant to embark. They are in themselves a form of self-writing, sometimes unwitting "self-writing." My readings of this process may seem at times to veer in at the poems from an unwarranted angle; that can not be avoided, because I will be focussing on them in the translated, or re-created, aspect. Not all of them are explicitly or exclusively concerned with American experience; some were written in France (although after Milosz's first stay in America). The readings naturally are not intended as improvements on Milosz's versions, striking poems in their own right, sometimes coining phrases in English with their own unique resonance, such as "a mere face of man." These could not have been generated in any other way. Milosz is in any case always at pains to render the poem rhythmically (which cannot be said of all his translators). These readings are meant to highlight some of the implications of the originals and the translations for the cultural values Milosz was and still is forced to negotiate in the course of his self-translation. 1. "Ludzie" and "Czlowiek": Neither "People" nor "Humans" The word ludzie, in its closest yet problematic English counterpart "people," presents Milosz with interesting difficulties in several poems. In "Nauki," "Lessons," it is the last word and emphatic telos of the first sentence, covering five lines: Od tamtej chwili, kiedy w domu o niskich okapach DoktoT z miasteczka przeciaj pepowine A pleniry sie w sadach szczawie i lebiody, Gniazda dla kropkowanych biala. plesnia gruszek, Bylem juz w rekach ludzi. Since that moment when in a house with low eaves A doctor from the town cut the navel-string And pears dotted with white mildew Reposed in their nests of luxuriant weeds I have been in the hands of humans. Milosz has to use the word "humans" in English in order to make clear that he means to refer to our ontological status ? to us as a kind among other kinds. "People" on its own would suggest a merely sociological category. A phrase which powerfully demonstrates the difficulty of translating the deceptively</page><page sequence="6">420 The Polish Review commonplace concept ludzie is one used by Zofia Nalkowska ? a Polish novelist and the author of a celebrated literary reportage about Auschwitz just after the war ? to sum up the meaning of genocide: Ludzie ludziom zgotowali ten los (Medaliony [Medallions], 1946). There are two immediate ways of transcribing this into English, each in a completely different register: "Human beings prepared this fate for other human beings"; "People did this to people." Needless to say, neither carries anything like the force of the original; the "people" phrase keeps some of the Polish brevity and colloquialness, "did" in a way closer to the perfective zgotowali (a single, isolated and complete action) than "prepared"; but it loses the crucial word for fate, los, and most importantly, it fails to accentuate the Polish equation's canceling out of our kind : human + human = inhuman. Ludzie, however, unlike "humans" or "human beings" or "inhuman," is neither pseudo-scientific nor, as in this context, banal: in Nalkowska's aphorism ludzie is the utterly ordinary taken up through an implied negation into horror. "Lessons" is a poem very much about the strangeness of human beings as opposed to other (though unspecified) kinds. Since birth, the poet has been in the hands of this particular sort: ... Mogli przecie zdlawic M6j krzyk pierwszy, nacisnaC swoja wielka dlonia Gardlo bezbronne, budzace ich czuloSC. Od nich przejalem nazwy ptakbw i owoc6w. .. . .. They could have strangled My first scream, squeezed with giant hand The defenseless throat that aroused their tenderness. From them I received the names of plants and birds . .. The Polish przecie, an untranslatable particle omitted by Milosz, meaning something like "after all" or "why ..." with heavy disbelieving emphasis, interrogates their motives for not strangling him even as their (unaccountable) tenderness at the sight of his defenseless throat is offered as a still puzzling answer. The word ludzie (or strictly speaking the genitive plural ludzi ), which is as elementary, both basic and primary, as "people," receives the whole weight of the opening lines in a way that "people," being in a special sense unspecific, could not. Yet Milosz's substitution of "humans," while retaining the vital sense of us as a kind, introduces an odd, semi-clinical note, moreover as telltale as a foreign accent. The poet continues: I lived in their country, not too barren, Not too cultivated, with a field, a meadow And water in a boat moored behind a shed.</page><page sequence="7">Milosz Translated by Milosz_421 The mildew-spotted pears and "luxuriant weeds" mark out the realm of ludzie as a contaminated Eden, although the suggestion of an embrace of rankness and fecundity (in "nests") loses something in Milosz's elision of the rather luscious-sounding Polish words for sorrel and origan, szczawie and lebiody. (These words are in fact associated with times of famine, when they would be substituted for staple foods.) As these details become more and more minute and local (down to the deserted boat), and as they identify the beings' "country" (kraj) unmistakably as the poet's "not too" one-or-the-other Lithuania, the mythical land of his childhood, they are cast in a increasingly "defamiliarizing," quizzical light which, though not as intense as that of Craig Raine's Martian, emphasizes again the fundamental oddness of the beings' perception and activity. The deceptive moderation and pleasant monotony of "not too barren / Not too cultivated" in fact spells the extremity of a potential for both good and evil (fruit and mildew), so that Milosz's native Lithuania in its very particularity becomes an instance of the global human force-field. As the poem proceeds, the word ludzie appears to undergo a bifurcation, as if evil were being opposed to humanness: Their lessons met, it is true, with a barrier Deep in myself and my will was dark Not very compliant with their intents or mine. Others . . . Were pacing within me ... " Their lessons" become those of the respectable, such as the town doctor, coinciding with the speaker's better, but hypothetical, self ("their intents [and] mine"), while "Others," (inni ), dark, troubled ancestors, grow rampant within: "pacing within me ... in locked creaky rooms . . . Kazimir, Hrehory / Or Emilia or Margareta... I had to repeat all by myself / Every flaw and sin of theirs." So that I wanted to shout: you are to blame For my not being what I want and being what I am. It is probably significant that these names, bar Kazmierz, itself a nonstandard form of Kazimierz ? a fact lost in the Anglicized form "Kazimir" ? are not really Polish. Milosz chooses to figure his authentic, maladjusted forbears as Lithuanian and Ukrainian. "Emilia" recalls for a Polish reader the only familiar literary instance of the name: Emilia Plater, the eponymous Polish Lithuanian heroine of a long poem by the great (Polish-Lithuanian) poet Mickiewicz, and a well-known historical figure, a legendary heroine of the 1830 Polish Insurrection against Russia. These are names z kresdw, literally "from the borderlands," a phrase referring to the eastern areas of the Poland</page><page sequence="8">422 The Polish Review (including Wilno), with a greater ethnic Lithuanian population ? those most "troubled" by the threat of an encroaching Russian empire. Paradoxically, they represent at once the margins of ethnic Poland, a sort of mythical Wild East, and the vital source of its Romantic culture (created by people like Mickiewicz). Thus the ancestors' names carry suggestions of a dark yet rich imaginative vein within the poet himself. The last lines nevertheless seal up the division between "they" and "others": Slortce padalo w ksiazce na grzech pierworodny. I nieraz, kiedy huczy w trawach popohidnie, Wyobrazalem sobie dwoje, z moja wina,, Jak depcza ose pod rajska jaWonia. Sunlight would fall in my book upon Original Sin. And more than once, when noon was humming in the grass I would imagine the two of them, with my guilt, Trampling a wasp beneath the apple tree in Eden. This ambivalent image of human doubleness ? is "Trampling a wasp" incurring a puncture in innocence through cruelty, or attaining victory over the serpent's sting? ? throws us back to the beginning. These beings, given their nature, should after all have strangled him. Milosz relies throughout the poem on a Polish concept as simple and fundamental as "people," but in which our separate humanness is stressed as it is not in English. Elsewhere he translates: The features of my face melt like a wax doll in the fire. And who can consent at the mirror to a mere face of man? [my italics] (Rzekimalejz [Rivers Grow Small]) As its title indicates, the poem is concerned with the dwindling of physical formations that impressed us as children, and at the same rate, of our aspirations to superhuman dimensions for ourselves. When for the first time I swam across the lake it seemed immense, had I gone there these days it would have been a shaving bowl between post-glacial rocks and junipers. The swim retrospectively ceases to be heroic. The curious phrase "a mere face of man" is a rendering of the simple Polish tylko twarz czlowieka, "only a human face." In Polish the phrase is expressed, without the articles (which</page><page sequence="9">Miiosz Translated by Milosz 423 Polish does not have), more like the still simpler "only the face of a man"; cziowiek, of which ludzie is the irregular plural, again places a stress on humanness which the English word does not. Unlike "a man,'' it can refer as a grammatical predicate to a woman: ona jest dobrym czlowiekiem [she is a good "cziowiek"]. Milosz translates without an indefinite article before "man" to suggest the encompassing human nature that "a man" cannot convey, and the result is intriguingly not-English. The phrase implies a somewhat archaic grandeur ("the history of Man"), just where it ought to convey the ordinary heightened, and precisely for emphasis not elevation, given that the mirrored face is a butt-end of great expectations. (At the same time, the resistance to being so defined by one's mirror, "who can consent. ..," is itself offered as a definition of humanness.) O aniolacb, "On Angels," is a poem which, in its context in Selected Poems, has suggested to Donald Davie that it presents a picture of the poet as angelic messenger, which is undercut in the following poem of the selection, Mistrz, "The Master," by a view of the poetic gift as demonic.2 I will return to that possible contrast in looking at "The Master" but for now will concentrate on the implications of ludzie versus, again, "humans" in a poem presenting itself as about angelic beings. The poem, with a title suggesting a scholastic treatise, is addressed, with a reverent familiarity, to angels themselves, whose existence and importance as divine messengers the poet whimsically affirms: Odjeto warn szaty biale Skrzydla i nawet istnienie, Ja jednak wierze warn, Wyslancy. All was taken away from you: white dresses, wings, even existence. Yet I believe you, Messengers. Ja . . . wierze warn could also have been translated as "I believe in you." Milosz evidently wanted to eschew a too obviously creed-like utterance, but "believe you" can suggest merely "I accept what you say." "Believe in" has the added sense of trust in someone's motives or character, implied by the Polish wierze [I believe] + dative; the Polish construction brings the angels closer. 2. Davie's (p. 43 - for full citations, see Bibliography) assumption seems plausible, but the originals of the two poems do not form a "companion-piece" in any Polish edition, and in fact Mistrz was written in 1959, well before O aniolach first appeared in an anthology published in 1974.</page><page sequence="10">424 The Polish Review There, where the world is turned inside out, a heavy fabric embroidered with stars and beasts, you stroll, inspecting the trustworthy seams. The combination of majestic, ethereal power and anthropomorphic quaintness in the angels' movements is brought out immediately in the contrast between their habit of "stroll[ing]" past the beautifully described "heavy fabric" of the world, as in a park, and their very role in surveying the "seams" i.e., foundations, of their white szaty. This is a word closer to "robes" or "raiment" than to the rather unfortunate "dresses," but with a solemnity somehow much more at ease in ordinary language; szaty, unlike robes, are vividly familiar, perhaps from the ceremony of the Catholic Mass. ("[T]rustworthy," of the world's seams is a fine translation of prawdomowne, which literally means "truthtelling) Short is your stay here: now and then at a matinal hour, if the sky is clear, in a melody repeated by a bird, or in the smell of apples at close of day when the light makes the orchards magic. Again, the angels' presence is captured (in both Polish and English) in twofold terms in the next lines, on the one hand in lyrical glimpses of fleeting yet pungent sensory experiences, the smell of apples at dusk and a bird's melody at dawn (or at the delicately translated "matinal hour"), and on the other in the witty phrase Kr6tki wasz postdj tutaj. In English, "Short is your stay here" misses the mundane association in postdj of a vehicle of public transport (say, a train, or a taxi ? postdj taksdwek is a taxi stand) coming to a brief standstill at an appointed place. The next three lines form the crux of the poem: They say somebody has invented you but to me this does not sound convincing for the humans invented themselves as well. As in "Lessons," the stress ludzie places on people's humanness, their "quiddity" as distinct from that of other beings ? like angels ? would not be carried by "people," so Miiosz falls back on the scientific "the humans" (sounding again like a scientist from Mars). His definite article is no doubt inserted for reasons of rhythm, but it adds to the alien ring of the phrase. What is coined, "for the humans invented themselves as well," has a new quality of somewhat ponderous if also engaging gravity, like the "mere face of man," where in Polish the irony of people's self-invention is couched in terms</page><page sequence="11">Milosz Translated by Milosz_425 of devastating simplicity. Nothing could be more like ludzie in their ludzkoSC than the hubris of displacing celestial beings with their own enlarged forms: in Polish, the point is made in a way as casual as a comment about the weather. The poet hears in his sleep the voice of these "radiant creatures'' whose wings he diffidently restores ("weightless and winged [after all, why not?]"), and this access to the beings may be a clue that Milosz does playfully intend "angels" to represent poet-prophets, "divine" messengers like himself. That would certainly multiply the ironies of contrasting angels with human beings: making people into a species, not just a race, apart. The angels speak to him in an "unearthly tongue": day draws near another one do what you can. "[U]nearthly" and "tongue" are words which indicate again the relative dissociation in modern English or ordinary and extra-ordinary diction, whether ceremonial or "poetic," and perhaps Milosz's less than full awareness of it. In Polish, nadziemskim, which means supra- rather than un-earthly, and jezykiem, which covers the range of both "language" and "tongue," have none of their English semi-counterparts's potential for inducing faint embarrassment. In fact, "unearthly tongue" is an apt description of the appeal of some of Milosz's English coinages ("Girdled with the lightning"). Szaty and nadziemskim indicate, by contrast, how closely interwoven the earthly and the above- or out-of-the-earthly still are in modern Polish. Ludzie and czlowiek, then, as Milosz's model in in his writing, have particular implications for his description of himself as a humanist, one "on the side of man, for lack of anything better" (Visions ). Without being too farfetched, one could read the extra emphasis of ludzie and czlowiek (when compared with "people") as revealing a built-in linguistic predisposition, or at least encouragement, to thinking of ourselves especially as a kind of being ? the kind that thinks about its being a kind, unlike un-self-obsessed angels. 2. Wzniosly versus "Lofty": The Tongues of Men and Angels To take up the question of the possibly greater hospitableness, in Polish, of ordinary to ceremonial diction, I want to return to the poem "The Master," where, if Davie is right, "On Angels" likens poets to celestial beings, Mistrz, "The Master" is a poet speaking through the mouth of a baroque composer, a maestro: Everybody has heard in the cathedral my Missa Solemnis. I changed the throats of girls from the Saint Cecilia choir</page><page sequence="12">426 The Polish Review Into an instrument which raises us Above what we are . .. The poem turns upside down the belief in a divine origin to poetic inspiration (possibly as played on in "On Angels"). It begins "They say that my music is angelic" and ends "A language of angels! . . . What comes from my evil ? that only is true." Yet, interestingly, what emerges in a comparison of the Polish and English versions, is the extent of the ready co habitation in Polish, if not of the angelic and the demonic, then of the sacred and the profane, the mundane and the ? for significant want of a better word ? lofty. This dimension would be called podniosle or wzniosle in Polish, with the same connotations of being aloft, but, predictably, unlike "lofty," without a mandatory ironic inflection. The demonic master is reminiscent of Browning's personae, his speciously elevating music depriving a lady-in-waiting's silk dress of its tactile property to "induce pleasant immodest thoughts." When he speaks of not "wasting" his youth, in Polish the word trwonilem [squandered] has a strong biblical resonance, distinctly recalling the prodigal son (syn marnotrawny). A few lines later, beginning to suggest how he "paid" for the power to create work outlasting the strongest things of his day ("ploughs will erase a forest. The flute and the violin / Will always work as I have ordered them"), the master scoffs at his audience, who think it may be gained without incurring guilt: "Ridiculous, they believe / It may be got for nothing." In Polish the phrase dostaje sie darmo is as colloquial as "you get it for free," and yet it does not jar at all against trwonilem. From his position of ageless immortality, the master watches "white-haired" women dipping the fingers in a basin (i.e., of holy water in church) and imagines that "she," presumably a lost beloved, "might have been one of them." He is excluded from an aging human circle. Nevertheless, he "loved [his] destiny": Whether I would have chosen virtue. My line of fate does not tell. Does God really want us to lose our soul For only then He may receive a gift without blemish? What Milosz calls "without blemish" in English, was in Polish nieskazitelny, a word brimming with religious associations, as much "unstained" as artistically flawless. As if to exorcise a pious thought, the speaker exclaims: Mowa anioidw! Nim wspomnisz o Lasce Bacz, abyS innych i siebie nie zwodzil. Co z mego zla powstalo, to tylko prawdziwe.</page><page sequence="13">Miiosz Translated by Milosz 421 A language of angels! Before you mention Grace Mind that you do not deceive yourself and others. What comes from my evil ? that only is true. In Polish, all three lines are, ironically, permeated with wzniosfy speech. Mowa itself corresponds to both "speech" and "parlance," or "tongue" ? as in the Pauline "tongues of men and angels" to which the poet is no doubt referring. "Mind" is probably the best possible translation, but the Polish Bacz sounds less like an English governess reminding her charges not to muddy their shoes than an Old Testament prophet issuing a terrifying warning. Zwodzil is again, unlike "deceive," heavily biblical, and powstalo, without being archaic, is closer to "arises" than "comes from." In the poem Oeconomia Divina, also translated by Milosz (with the same title), a Polish particle, zaiste, meaning something like "I tell you" or even "yea, verily," is lost altogether in the bald English "indeed" ? "It was a spectacle that was indeed unlike . . . ." In its implication of a special knowledge, zaiste is symptomatic of the conception of the poet as wieszcz, which underlies that and many other poems. Wieszcz, to go on tiresomely proving the point, is something like "bard" without the automatic ironic reflex (and always referring to a national figure). Of the same kind as zaiste, the language of Mistrz partly undermines the very revolt against poet-prophets which its overt logic mounts. It is interesting to note in this context the similar, indeed almost identical problems encountered by translators rendering Rilke's poetry in English, as these are identified by Richard Bly in bis essay, "The Eight Stages of Translation": We notice that this problem of "noble language" causes a lot of trouble to translators in their effort to translate Rilke into English. Rilke translations have frequently been nobly dead. The translator, in the effort to rise to the upper or resonating level he senses in Rilke, will abandon out living language and resort to old cloudlike phrases that are now only scenery. He will try, from the best intentions, to retrieve and revive dusty clauses and high-flown diction and stuff them into the poem, with the result that the living language dies, both languages die, and Rilke seems ridiculous . . . [the ailing tone of some translations] comes from pretending that the aristocratic stream of language is still alive in English.3 This forced feel hardly characterizes Milosz's own translations, which veritably seem to toll with the authority of the original voice, yet the need to contend with the lack of a "high-flown" vein in English is as evident in his translations from Polish as in any from Rilke's German. A translated poem in which the comfortable strain of ceremonial language in s3. Bly, p. 79.</page><page sequence="14">428 The Polish Review Polish comes into a still more culturally revealing conflict with the absence of a similar one in English is zadanie, "a task." The Polish title itself has the sense of a "task" (which can be quite humdrum) but also of "mission." W trwodze i drzeniu mysle, ze spelnilbym swoje zycie Tylko gdybym sie zdobyl na publiczna spowiedi Wyjawiajac oszustwo, wtasne i mojej epoki... In fear and trembling, I think I would fulfill my life Only if I brought myself to make a public confession Revealing a sham, my own and of my epoch .. . The opening line in Polish contains a word which, like "fulfill," has its root in the practical sense of "to fill," e.g., a vessel. Yet its meaning is very different. As in the English "fulfill a decree," one can spelni? wyrok ; but where in English this sense is quite distinct from "find fulfillment" or "fulfill oneself," in the Polish verse life is indeed imagined somewhat as a decree, the pressure of which is the source of "fear and trembling." Spelnilem swoje zycie is cast in an aura of obligation and preordination. The phrase is used by analogy with the set spelnid zadanie, to complete or execute a task; "fulfill my life" does not immediately bring the analogy with the title to mind (where perhaps "complete" might). The verb spelnid is in the perfective aspect, referring to a completed, isolated action: there is, by implication, a single life which awaits our decision. It may be "filled" once and for all (by the public confession) or not at all. The English "fulfill," it hardly needs pointing out, entails a very much more openended conception, both of life and the person living it. One can see therefore how tendentious a foothold the word claims for itself in this Polish poem about a "task," about responsibility not to oneself but so some larger entity encompassing that self. Something similar is true of Milosz's rendering of the key word dostojne [dignified] in the next lines, as "generous." Wolno nam bylo odzywaC sie skrzekiem karlbw i demondw Ale czyste i dostojne slowa byly zakazane Pod tak surowa kara, ze kto jedno z nich smial wym6wiC Juz sam uwazal sie za zgubionego. We were permitted to shriek in the tongue of dwarfs and demons But pure and generous words were forbidden Under so stiff a penalty that whoever dared to pronounce one of them Considered himself as a lost man. Dostojne would never be found under "generous" in an English-Polish</page><page sequence="15">Milosz Translated bv Milosz 429 dictionary. The adjectives "dignified," "grand" and "august" are given as its English equivalents by The KoSciuszko Foundation Polish-English Dictionary. Significantly, "dignified" has in contemporary English become affiliated with words like "stiff" and "pompous." While "dignity" to some extent retains a positive meaning, as in the motto "to die with dignity," "generosity" is in fact conceived as the very opposite of "standing on one's dignity." Dostojne, like "dignified" or "grand," implies a certain status, a hierarchy, though more likely to be applied to a fine old man (dostojny starzec) than to members of any particular social class (i.e? what is implied is membership of a certain aristocracy of the spirit). This related aspect of "dignified" is perhaps precisely why it has come to accrete negative connotations in English. Dostojne slowa are the opposite of a demotic. In a passage in the essay "Private Obligations to Polish Literature" which provides an interesting gloss on the poem's opposition of dostojne and dwarfish speech, Milosz contrasts the irony used by writers like Gombrowicz and Mrozek ? whom he nominates in a special sense "prone to hierarchies, aristocratic through their attachments to distinctions"4 ? with Galczynski's irony at such irony's expense. While the former are iconoclasts, like Milosz himself satirizing the "rite of the National Mass," they are implicitly moved by what Milosz evidently sees as a savage Swiftian integrity, a body of inherited values, a sense of obligation. Galczynski's laughter, actually directed at ironists like these (and thus, since "two negatives make a positive," supporting a Communist brand of nationalist self-glorification), is the amoral cackle of "Realpolitik," of "hooligans [who would] push an old man's face in his soup." It is clear from both this passage, which is clearly highly personal, and these lines in Zadanie/ "A Task," that dostojne slowa stand in Milosz's mind not for effete verbal effluvia, removed from daily realities, but for a true vernacular. It might be objected that "generous," like "magnanimous" or "munificent," equally implies a hierarchy, since one person has the wherewithal to practice it while another can only be its recipient. "Generosity," however, in a less narrowly monetary sense, is rather something imagined as coming entirely from within. Not owed to anyone, no "task," certainly not a commitment to a possibly passing order, generosity is drawn from an inner wellspring, unforced, creative, and purely personal in origin. It suggests no sense of a claim on the individual from without; which is exactly what the poem is about. Milosz in a sense laments the passing of the element of podniosloSd [loftiness] in Polish itself, and in modern culture more generally, to be replaced by the shrieking of "dwarfs and demons" ("the tongue of..." is of course another reference to Paul's [or here King James's] "tongues of men and angels" ? a biblical touch again). Yet, curiously, the poem reveals the degree to which this register, by virtue of the very power of a word like dostojne, is 4.

In his essay "Understanding as Translation,'' George Steiner equates linguistic "conservatism" with "the deliberate retention of the archaic."5 In this sense, Polish seen in the light of Milosz's Polish-to-English translations, seems inherently conservative. These terms are not really adequate, however, to describing the differences at issue here. The modern meanings of English words like "Fulfillment" and "generosity," though relatively recent, represent in themselves a certain solidified and "sanctified" usage, with all the propensity for cliche that Steiner ascribes to what he calls the archaic. Steiner's contrast between the deadening and "sclerotic" force of cliches and the power of more innovative trends is of course uncontroversial. Milosz's own interaction with time-hallowed Polish words like wieszcz remains in any case properly ambivalent. Nevertheless, expressions as "unexamined" and easily overlooked as on the one hand dostojne and "dignified," on the other, ludzie and "people," may yield surprising cultural and ethical discoveries. The opposition Steiner sets up between "language used to formalize" and that which "quicken[s] the means of human response" fails to take account of this.6 Milosz's choice of "pure and generous" for czyste i dostojne indeed reveals an achieved inwardness with the cultural values inscribed in such weighty ethical terms, which evidently proceeds from a familiarity with lived rather than dictionary English. Thus the poem is both lost and translated, made intelligible to readers of the English by means of a meaning not only absent from the original, but even partly at odds with it. One could say that in juxtaposing "generous" with a word like "task," more likely though it is to be associated with the schoolroom than a mission on the scale of an "epoch," Milosz stretches the concept of generosity in an unfamiliar direction: the English word, too, undergoes a partial translation. Conclusion The problem of writing in a language not one's own is inevitably one of translation, whether or not one addresses a finite original. Indeed, despite Milosz's instinctive revolt against writing in English, his translations show that the two projects of rendering into a second language what was written in one's native tongue, and choosing ton write in the adopted one, are closer than might be expected. With each, vital original meanings may become attenuated ? or alternatively extended ? by their exposure to the new code of cultural values which constitutes the second language. Milosz is forced to "translate" himself in the course of translating his texts 5. Page 20. 6.

His translations thus throw an interesting light on central questions regarding translation: is it, in essence, the recuperation of a threatened original? At what points might the attempt to salvage that prevent the speaker making himself heard at all? The rewritten poems show Milosz creatively engaging with these questions, as both writer and immigrant,as he translates himself from Polish into English.
