Two Annotated Poems for a More Literary, Poetic Sociology Am a b Ch atterje While literature and sociology are separately signifying, discursive practices, their use in unison has been limited to either the sociology of literature or a sociology through literature. This article, while demonstrating these two approaches as doubly mistaken, innovates - with two annotated poems - a more or most literary, poetic sociology where the self-deconstructive writing that happens in the event of a poem, undergoes a destructive mutation being contaminated by the social: they cannot be sundered in annotation, cannot be gleaned from a unity a priori. Then, are we prepared to subvert the sociologie of sociological texts and themes through poetic sociology in the classroom? The moment is here. [Keywords: circus; literary sociology; pedagogy; phenomenological sociology; poetic sociology] No mean aesthetic skill is involved in Marx's depiction of capitalism as a structure in motion, in Tocqueville's rendering of equality as a dynamic process... 'Societies are organisms'. All of these are instances of metaphorical constructions. - Robert Nisbet (1976: 7, 32) I believe that anyone who stood up at a meeting, banged his fist on the table and declared: 'We demand a sociology that seeks to be nothing other than sociology could be sure of a certain measure of collective assent. - Theodor Adorno (2000: 101)</page><page sequence="2">60 Arnab Chatterjee But we also have to ask all the others to examine their conscience and answer the question: Do you believe you could bear to see mediocrities getting ahead of you year after year without feeling inwardly embittered and crushed? - Max Weber (2008: 30) While reeling off this apparently uncomfortable and embarrassing anecdote quoted above, Max Weber was not engaged in an auto biographical gesture (or for that matter, echo the scream of his friend Georg Simmel, who, surrounded by aggressive mediocrity, never got a respectable, fulltime tenure). He was, in fact, busy engineering a distinction between the vocation of sociology as a science and sociology as an art. The only significant difference he could observe and elaborate on it was that, in sociology, one paradigm is transcended, overcome or surpassed in favour of another and there is 'progress', while in art it is not. 'A work of art that attains real "fulfilment" will never be surpassed, and will never become obsolete' (Weber 2008: 34). Then, derivatively, we could ask, how could sociology be an art, as Robert Nisbet (1976: 29), while noting the presence of styles in sociology, seems to suggest? May it have been woefully in the 1970s (in fact, in 1971, Andrew Greeley, five years before Nisbet, had declared sociology to be an art form) or anachronistically only after sixty years or so (since 1910) that sociology claimed for itself the form of the art. By the first half of the 20th century, art happened to have been condemned and abandoned by the Dadaists or the futurists; even with the Surrealists, their co-habitation with whatever was art, was all too distant (see Chatteijee 2011: 164). The fragmentation of the world tended to be reconciled in art; therefore, in order to celebrate the fragment, art would have to be opposed: this gave birth to the avant-garde. 'Artists discover the compulsion towards disintegration in their own works, in the surplus of organization and regimen...[H]owever, the truth of such disintegration is achieved by nothing less than the triumph of guilt and integration' (Adorno 2004: 57). By the end of the 1960s, if we are to be convinced about the death of the avant-garde or their practice of guilty integration, art was reclaimed by other disciplinary forms - sociology is an immediate instance for us. The autonomy of art was, by then, a sham; the autonomy of sociology was a sham, too. And now, art is no more possible, but as literature! Or when literature - if it has become impossible, then the only way to its recurrence is its appearance as, or, in the novel, or in the body of the poem, or again, in resemblance - which is an 'as if a poem'. And, after Auschwitz, if poetry were to become impossible, as Theodor Adorno declared, then what remains? The visuals today are not visible to the</page><page sequence="3">Subverting Sociologie? 61 plain eye; it is only accessible in the movie theatre at the epicentre of the high profile, prolific market complex: the eternity of the shopping mall subject to central surveillance. In a postcolonial polity such as India the situation is severe. In Salman Rushdie's novel, Taslima Nasreen's autobiography and essays, paintings by M.F. Hussain, and in movies like Fire or Water various communities have claimed their demands for rightful representation, problematising the modernist niche of autonomous art to be judged only by the norms of aesthetic representation. The arrival of counter-norms of political representation has notched, bullied, and crisscrossed with the rules of aesthetic representation. The problem of art as representation is no more the same; it is, in fact, two-fold 'requiring a double reflection on their being-for-themselves and on their relations to society' (Adorno 2004: 297). Even with this double entendre in play, a sociological text is far from being an artistic one and vice versa. It is commonplace now that sociology is not literature and literature is not sociology. D.P. Mukheijee, who, in the 1930s, wrote novels and engaged with the sociology of literature, though remarked on the resemblance of 'the work of the sociologist akin to that of the litterateur' (Basu 2012: 164), did not think they could be united in a dialectical moment. M.N. Srinivas wrote two beautiful short stories (now available in Narayan 1997), but did not, despite requests, include them in any of his works or anthologies. T.N. Madan notes how 'through the medium of fiction, Srinivas said things that he did not through his ethnography' (2011: 193). This reluctance also went against Srinivas's own observation elsewhere on how the anthropologist, while empathising with the indigene and imagining himself in their place and pathos, he 'crosses the barriers between himself and the indigenes. In doing this, the anthropologist is close to the novelist who places himself in the position of the diverse characters in his novel' (Srinivas 1998: 2526; italics mine). A sceptic will justifiably ask: why did Srinivas assert and arrogate himself against the disciplinary, ethnographic incorporation of his own stories? That is because, despite admitting compliance here and there (expressed by both Mukheijee and Srinivas through such adages as 'like a', 'akin to', 'similarly', or 'close to'), literature and sociology have always been defined by a close negation; in 'literary sociology' this negation is transcended and an existence is affirmed. Let us see this affirmation embedded in sociological traditions - even in marginal forms - for we need this to establish it as not arriving from nowhere, and then we shall try to get a handle over its original essence.</page><page sequence="4">62 Arnab Chatterjee Literary, Poetic Sociology in Sociology: A Review 'Literary sociology' as a phrase has appeared in sociology circles though with an unsatisfactory and insufficient ring. It has been used interchangeably with 'sociology of literature' fed with bits of literary history: beginning with the positivists to the Reader Response Aesthe ticians, all are literary sociologists (Miles 1975). Or, it has been taken to stand for socially oriented textual criticism (Tanselle 1991: 85), where the text - conceived to have been exorcised from the intentions of the original single author - reaches the reader as a collective product bearing the marked imprint of many collaborators hinged in between {ibid. : 83 143). And where is poetic sociology here - in its primordial form - as a precursor to our own mooring? One could easily begin by relating how, explicit in poet Octavio Paz's affirmation, Simmel influenced him and this influence could be deciphered and delineated in Paz's work culled as a sample (Capetillo-Ponce 2005). Influence apart, a sociologist who has been studied in terms of poetic metaphors is Zygmunt Bauman. Bauman's societal metaphors ... of liquidity is employed to describe a world that has melted, changed beyond all recognition when compared to its former 'solid state'. Liquid modem society is one that does not hold any particular shape for long. Life in a 'liquid' environment is such that one cannot rely on anything to remain fixed: nothing lasts, nothing stays the same. Individuals cannot use past events and experiences to navigate their futures...' (Jacobsen and Marshman 2008: 805). A more promising endeavour has been to consider poetry and 'learning to view them as "primary data", to be interpreted, rather than as sources of entertainment and escape' (Mileyl988: 176). John Powell Ward observes, 'the poeticality of language in the new sociology signifies an attempt to combine understanding this constraint [which society imposes and poetry helps breaking and freeing us from] with breaking it' (1986: 330; see also Ward 1981). Without commenting, however, on what he calls 'sociological activity', he illuminatingly summarises: 'The crucial thing is that sociology's central concern (collective order and, therefore, control) is argued to be only able to be broken by poetic language' (ibid.: 331). This is the subversion of the sociologie to which we have referred to in the title. Also, our annotation that would follow the poems subsequently could be seen as a poem's resonance: 'The poem's resonance is the poem (ibid.: 335, italics in the original). The annotation could also be seen as a stance which,</page><page sequence="5">Subverting Sociologie? 63 elaborated as lyrical sociology, is not an explanatory narrative, but an emotional subject position towards a moment (Abbott 2007). This is all the more justified taking into account the new French pragmatic sociological argument where the fictional characters seemed to provide 'justifications' through their own dilemmas and voice; in other words, the very necessary substratum for an empty, injunctional 'ought' otherwise universalised as a moral solution. 'We argue that social actors (real or fictional) voice critiques in the name of values, ideals, and repertoires of justification that are presumed to be universally shared' (Dromi and Illouz 2010: 355). Emotion has an ethics too, and fictional characters are, therefore, treated as moral sociologists. But this linkage immediately becomes dull the moment it is, as Shai M. Dromi and Eva Illouz do, linked to the 'sociology of literature' (ibid. : 353). This being the state of things in current, contemporary sociology, we shall now reveal briefly, how, a more literary, poetic sociology is not only the outside of sociology - subverting and fracturing the sociologie and the semiotics of objects and things and is thus not the sociology of literature - as it is so often (mis)understood, but also is, at the same time, outside of language itself. From Phenomenological Sociology to a More Literary, Poetic Sociology: A Prelude Methodologically, the debate on whether sociology is a science or a factorial, olive branch of the humanities has persisted. Mayer N. Zald, who is not opposed to 'playing the science card', argues that, In a sense there are lodestone classics for each of the enduring civili zational themes. Returning to the classic themes and the classic answers occurs as our common language usage shifts and as we attempt to refine and rethink our orientation in specific problem areas. As the focal concerns of scholars shift in the context of the larger society, different historic usages and analyses come to the fore. That resembles the procedures in the humanities more than it does those of the sciences (1991: 179). It was required to make a reference to this and so far so good. But for us, it is not a keen question of methodology, but a substantive question of a discipline's intent, direction, and essence: meaning is what sociology must mean and nothing less. The question of meaning was first mooted emphatically by phenomenological sociology. Max Weber, being a neo Kantian, is no exception with his emphasis on other-oriented meaning and value, and such is the case with all classical sociologists. Anybody</page><page sequence="6">64 Arnab Chatterjee suspicious about this claim may see Gilian Rose's brilliant classic (Rose 1981) for a scholarly demonstration. We shall first state this position and then, briefly, curve a departure. In phenomenological sociology, the origins of literariness or a literary attitude is foregrounded in the everyday life. The question of meaning in the intended meaning acts or even speech acts of other people may elicit the following questions among others: 'Have I understood you correctly?' 'Don't you mean something else?' 'What do you mean by such and such action?' These are typical of the questions that I am forced to ask every day in my relations with other people. The moment I raise such questions, I have abandoned my simple and direct awareness of the other person, my immediate grasp of him in all his subjective particularity. I have abandoned the living intentionality of our confrontation. The light in which I am looking at him is now a different one: my attention has shifted to those deeper layers that up to now had been unobserved and taken for granted (Schutz 1980: 140-41). The naturalised attitude and the shared life-world being abandoned, now we brace ourselves for the unobserved: the allegorical abbreviation of the 'taken for granted'; the double reflexivity, the tropes and figures in comparability, briefly, the lie. In other words, a uniqueness, a oneness quickly and silently sets in through this very aperture. In poetry, this is consolidated and the journalistic world of everyday life is readily de familiarised; the expectation of a deep structure is handy and could be compared rightly to a second natural attitude - though this is its problem, which is also the problem of phenomenological sociology. Yet that the poem or the literary speech act, even if contaminated by everyday speech acts, is also parasitical upon the latter in some form, grants it a value more than validity. Therefore, a poem is a closed social world, but resembles the interrogation of meaning that we indulge in our everyday ness, and here the conventions that give rise to such and such meaning have to be discovered and debated. Simply ascribing it a social conventionality or rituality is to practise the sociology of literature, not 'literary sociology'. A literary sociology is where the social world is reconstituted through the acts of literature and sent back to the social to be thrown back once again, and this goes on. Let us put a few more words in order to clarify this complex issue. Above, Alfred Schutz holds on to a very crucial aspect of the everyday social world, no doubt, but his limitation is the limitation of phenomenological sociology in general. The emphasis on the intended-meaning-acts of the actor/speaker is elusive to say the least:</page><page sequence="7">Subverting Sociologie? 65 Reaching out my hand to pull a chair toward me, I have folded the arm of my jacket, scratched the floor, and dropped my cigarette ash. In doing what I willed to do, I did a thousand and one things I hadn't willed to do. The act was not pure; I left traces. Wiping away these traces, I left others... Thus we are responsible beyond our intentions (Levinas 2007: 3). If this is so, then we are responsible beyond our meaning. It is not that I ask what did you mean, and s/he as the answerer has a full grasp of it and the 'meant' could be narrated as a commentary or quoted in full translation in its full measure. It could well leap out of his competence and the sense of violation and out of the sense of well-formed intentional speech acts; it could face up to an exteriority - the thought of an outpouring - totally uncalled for. Language slips through the sovereign 'I' and the whole network of the formal modes of representative conventions used to situate and interpret the force of the authorial, speakers' signature. This unknown, this limited infinity is what is literature, and what it is meant to be. Michel Foucault, apart from making a terse nullification '"I speak"; it disappears the instant I fall silent" (2000: 148), expresses this beautifully: If the only site for language is indeed the solitary sovereignty of 'I speak', then in principle nothing can limit it - not the one to whom it is addressed, not the truth of what it says, not the values or systems of representation it utilises. In short, it is no longer discourse and the communication of meaning, but a spreading forth of language in its raw state, an unfolding of pure exteriority. And the subject that speaks is less the responsible agent of a discourse ... than a non-existence in whose emptiness the unending outpouring of language uninterruptedly continues {ibid.). And, literature is the short name for this opening of language to its outside and not really the self-referential interiority captured within the prison house of language - as held by the structuralists in the moment of their allergy towards phenomenological sociology. But, how is this possible? When we are doing sociology - that too with an applied niche - we ought to undertake an answering of the question. The predictable answer is that we achieve it by departing from the everyday language or habits of speech as one step forward from the Husserlian and Schutzian move away from the naturalised worldhood in general. But, literature, as the outside of language, has to be envisioned and encrypted from within that of language itself (in sociology, the problem, as 'The Problem of Sociology', finds itself in the classic statement by Simmel: 'It is first necessary to find in society what "society" actually is, just as geometry determines in spatial things what spatiality actually is' (2009: 27; italics</page><page sequence="8">66 Arnab Chatterjee mine). This paradox seems insurmountable - apparently, but reasonably so. More because it is not always the realm of the figure, but the figure, in contact with the non-figural, non-tropological, non-allegorically ordinary and the everyday, expressive commonplace that literature arises or dissolves within and outside of itself: Not when it is set apart from words, but within the intimacy of what is said, through the operation of clichÃ©s, which alone are capable of rescuing it from the anamorphosis of reflection. One might imagine this thought which is revealed in conventions, which both escapes and is kept safe [se sauvÃ©] within constraints. But that is language's secret... [A]ll we have to do is to imagine that true commonplace expressions are words torn apart by lightning and the rigours of law found the absolute world of expressions, outside which there is nothing but sleep and chance (Blanchot 1995: 60; italics original). So, it is not always our hunt for the figurai immanent in everyday practice of signification, but in a literary act where the figure and the trope are entwined with the clichÃ© in an extraordinary non-distinction; and this non-distinction traverses the literary text which is sociological and literary at the same time in the single act: the poem. A 'More Literary', Poetic Sociology: Preface to the Practice Ahead Subsequent to Georg Lukacs' famous sociological studies of literary realism, George Konrad's excellent novel The Case Worker (1974), Lewis Coser's collection of literary narratives for the adumbration of a sociology (Coser 1963), and Michael Ungar's The Social Worker: A Novel (2011), a collection of 'sociological' poems for a 'more literary, poetic sociology' has been long overdue. The two poems - 'The Animal Trainer', by the American poet John Berryman, and "Bleached Fatal: Cho's Iraqian Confession' (my own) - are responses to this intimate, academic calling.1 Like the narrative tracts of Coser or Konrad, these poems could be used in the social science classes and be read together with the topics they theoretically regulate. While standard sociological themes are invoked in the class, these poems, for their allegorical and tropological form, will de-familiarise the students and urge them to unravel the deep structure of apparently sociological content localised in such literary formations. Therefore, while the students could start by separating the poetic and the sociological, or the tropological and the clichÃ©, they will, finally, give the exercise up in despair: the magic of 'poetic sociology' ought to be this, not to be pinned down by the gravitational pull of separately signifying discourses. One might call this, if he may, not 'sociology through literature', but the intimate, responsible</page><page sequence="9">Subverting Sociologie? 67 de-structuration of 'sociology through literature'. This much for the traditional, didactic use of our text. The two poems are followed by annotation. Is it explanation, evalua tion, commentary, or criticism? In response to this question one recalls the highly interesting manoeuvre made by Walter Benjamin (2006: 215â 50). I agree with Benjamin's distinction between 'commentary' and 'assessment', in that a commentary is not an evaluation: 'The commen tary takes for granted the classical status of the work under discussion and thus, in a sense, begins with a pre-judgement' [concerned only with] 'the beauty and positive content of the text' (ibid.: 215). But I disagree with his observation that 'the business of a commentary is to demonstrate the political [in our case, sociological] content of the very passages that are purely lyrical in tone' (ibid.: 216). That will be again a sociology of literature, a position that we disagree with, since these poems are socio logical and, they are on their own, immanently 'literary'. Have we been able to make our case with sufficient reason? This should be read with caution since everything literary could be sociological (this is the stuff of the 'sociology of literature' or sociology through literature), but every thing that is sociological is not literary. Therefore, a literary sociology is, at the same time, literary and sociological. Here, the poems are the primary object; they are self-evidently adequate. The annotation comes only as a double exposition and could be considered by some to be redundant. Poetic Sociology of the Circus: 'The Animal Trainer' by John Berryman The hunt for the stable signified is mechanised in the traveling tent and the content of the circus. The general sociological view tends to endorse an anthropomorphic (entailing enforced humanisation) explanation of the trained tactic and the territorialisation that the animals undergo; the question of admissible hospitality and terror at their tortured acrobatics is, to this admonition, a rememoration of the prehistory of the people as spectators - thus goes the view. What follows is a superb 'sociological' summary: It is in this context of an industrial and commodified order, of the 'fear and trembling' at the loss of Nature, that the new circus play emerged on the periphery. Anthropomorphism is being played here anew and gains new significances. It is no longer just part of the narrative of control and subjugation of Nature, as some 'anti-circus' voices would argue... It is no longer just a trope of critical irony, of the grotesque, as in Grandville... as perceived by the circus spectators... Nature is constantly there, in those</page><page sequence="10">68 Arnab Chatterjee anthropomorphic segments of the act [where 'Animals are "self referentially" absorbed into Human forms'], yet it is constantly being disintegrated, transgressed, and textualised. In an era fearing the loss of Nature, it is in the periphery, that is, the circus, that this loss is playfully pushed to the extreme and experientially 'realized.' Elsewhere... I have looked at this circus experience as part of a phenomenological inter pretation of the accusations the 'anti-circus' group level against circus cruelty to animals. My argument was that the experience of 'cruelty' among some of the spectators in circus animal acts does not originate in the witnessing of actual torture inflicted on animals during the per formance... If the accusations levelled against the circus do persist, it is because 'cruelty' arises from the public's perceptual experience of Nature as being shattered and transgressed in the circus performance. This circus experience of transgression, evoked at the sight of Nature being made an object of play, impacts on the spectators' sense of their own ontological grounds. In the peripheral circus performance, the public's Nature mirrored (Animal-opposed) Human self is playfully endangered. (Carmeli 2003:79-80). This explanation of sociological poetics, plausible though it may be, would be first problematised theoretically and then made to perish through a poetic sociological experiment as delineated below. In terms of a historical sociology, the trajectory Carmeli charts for the emergence of a new circus in the 'context of an industrial and commodified order, of the "fear and trembling" at the loss of Nature' is self-fulfillingly ideological. The circus had both a public (political) and a private (cultural) significance in medieval Rome. The circus - where the sovereign was often present to preside - was also home for the plebeians, and in times of agitation and political turmoil, 'it was to those places that they hastened to assemble and demonstrate' (Veyne 1990: 401). This public-political significance of the Roman circuses was hastened by the fact that they were 'official ceremonies which theo retically formed an element in the state religion (except for gladiatorial muner, which were, so to speak, a matter of custom and folklore' (ibid.: 415). And, it was through the circus, or the site of the circus, which emerged as the place holder, that the relations between the sovereign, the people and the Senate were reorganised. The peripheral movement of the circus was already evident in the late Roman formations. The circus itself had become a matter of popular2 political diversion, leading the people to be interested only in the circus as festivals, energised by their sole engagement with 'breads and circuses' only. 'The Roman people, the poet exclaims, no longer wants to vote, it has renounced public life, and is interested only in its bread and festivals' (ibid: 417). The circus then, being a part of 'city's business', was pushed to have</page><page sequence="11">Subverting Sociologie? 69 become a part of 'festivals' only, which was the third aspect beyond the public 'city's business' and 'private life'. So, the modern meaning of the circus as a show or an entertainment was already imminent in the Roman decline of the circus as a public event and not an industrially modern phenomenon as Carmeli seems to suggest. Secondly, his phenomenological interpretation of the loss of nature personified, displaced, and mourned in the spectatorial imaginary is attractive and interesting, but would hardly stand the test of a radical, semiotic analysis. In this, the circus imbibes a meta-cultural code, that is, 'as a code that implicitly refers to the cultural codes' and thus situates the circus as both 'within' and 'outside' culture (Bouissac 1976: 7): Some of the cultural elements are combined differently in the system of the circus than in the corresponding everyday instances. The mies of compatibility are transformed and often even inverted: at the level of the decoding process, a horse makes fun of a trainer; a tiger rides an elephant... Even the basic mies of balance are seemingly defied or denied (ibid: 8). And here the spectator is horrified not at the loss of nature and mourns her/his own existence being endangered, but at the loss of culture and is both - at the level of a meta-semiotic and in consonance with it - horrified and fascinated at the same instance. 'The circus freely manipulates a cultural system to such an extent that it leaves the audience contemplating a demonstration of humanity freed from the constraints of the culture within which the performance takes place' (ibid: 8). Carmeli's explanation based on the supposed transgression and torture of nature is thus problematised with the spectators wanting to be within and also to overcome the imperatives of culture itself (and the clown mediates this interface), and we concur with this view. Now, having begun with a historical-theoretical rejection of the standard sociology of the circus evinced in Carmeli, we shall get on with the poetic sociological elaboration that begins with the poem as an existential sample itself inseparable from other ruminations we might pursue. To begin with, one needs to remember Berryman's poems The Animal Trainer 1 and 2 (henceforth AT 1 and AT 2); submitting them to a ready mix, assumes the following form: Animal Trainer (V I told him: The time has come, I must be gone. It is time to leave the circus and circus days,</page><page sequence="12">70 Arnab Chatterjee The admissions, the menagerie, the drums, Excitements of disappointments and praise. In a suburb of the spirit I shall seize The steady and exalted light of the sun, And live there, out of the tension that decays, Until I become a man alone of the noon. Heart said: Can you do without your animals? The looking, licking, smelling animals? The friendly fumbling beast? The listening one? The standing up and worst of animals? What will become of you in the pure light When all your enemies are gone, and gone The inexhaustible prospect of the night? - But the night is now the body of my fear, These animals are my distraction. Once Let me escape the smells and cages here. Once let me stand naked in the sun, All these performances will be forgotten. I shall concentrate in the sunlight there... I reared them, tended them (I said) and still They plague me, they will not perform, they run Into forbidden corners, they fight, they steal. Better to live like an artist in the sun. - You are an animal trainer. Heart replied. Without your animals leaping at your side No sun will save you, nor this bloodless pride. What must I do then? Must I stay and work With animals, and confront the night, in the circus? - You learn from animals. You learn in the dark. (Berryman 1989: 30-31) We would speed through and abide by the poem in the following manner: the animal trainer then wants to abandon the dark corner of the circus (though they still are 'circus days'), abandon training and thus un inhabit culture (all culture is discipline, training, and selection) and, by it, the animals; abandoning, so that, by this translation, s/he may become an artist alone, with art not 'decaying' in forged 'tension'. The sound, the smell, the entwined acts of standing up and putting up 'soul delighting tasks' - all a product of taming the animal 'enemies' presupposed by the performative acts of punishing them - where the acts are themselves punishments. Punishment in itself is performance here. The dread, the fear, and the trembling in the trainer, of course, emerges from the scared adventure of meeting the most obstinate, unruly animal on whom the whip dithers and breaks: 'the unbroken animal that</page><page sequence="13">Subverting Sociologie? 71 cannot be trained' (Bataille 1988: 24); besides, 'all this performance will be forgotten' (by whom? It could be by the audience or by the animals that the trainer anticipates 'will not perform' ever-anymore'). This is all his baggage of culpable, collapsible fear. Cultural training demands obedience and obedience is a sort of, if not in its entirety, a form of blindness that ushers, flowers in the dark. As against this demand, the animals' inherent denial in that â'they fight, they steal' and by 'forgetting' ( if they are to) and running 'into forbidding corners' (but what is forbidden in the dark since the dark and the night themselves are of forbidding, sensuous propensity 'The animals are coupling, and they cry/The circus is, it is our mystery,/ It is a world of dark where animals die' [ibid. : AT 2: 32]). A dark, dangerous, dirty world of slaves - stealing, copulating, defecating, forgetting and thus showing in droplets, a rain of rebellion to come - appears as a possible world to the trainer where the darkness gravitates towards or invades her/his own interiority and s/he wants to stand 'out' in the sun; s/he wants to escape. There is then an indeterminacy built into the optic of everyday taming of the animals - not once for all - but which have to be repeated, rehearsed, and reiterated with the shock of pulsation again and again. This distraction, which the trainer confides while trying to impinge upon the constant attention of the animals, derives not from an externality, for sure. 'The animal has contingent self-movement because its subjectivity is, like light and fire, ideality torn from gravity, ... a free time, which, as removed at the same time from real externality, determines its place on the basis of inner chance' (Hegel 2001).3 This 'inner chance' or 'spon taneous determination' is what is indeterminate to the trainer and, therefore, even an overburdening of attention (or gravitation to pull down and keep them pinned to disciplinary regimes) is not enough: freed from this gravity, they always slip through the attentive, concen trated net of eyes - Georges Bataille would call this 'the pineal eye' (1986b: 82). In Animal Trainer (2), Berryman declares the suburb and the sun - where the trainer wants to escape and reside, standalone - 'are pale' (Berryman 1989: AT 2: 32). If the suggestion to abandon is the spirited lesson of the head, the heart persuades him to stay learning from the angels of the night, since the sun that leaves no shadows cannot save and if all learning is journeying from darkness to light, then dispelling all cognitive dissonance or, ignorance could happen at the site of this thin darkness only. The trainer must remain, and learn from the animals - learn from the night which treasures 'inexhaustible prospects'. Let us rehearse the grounding of the animal ontology: who is the animal? The Animal 'I' is identity or equality to itself (Kojeve 1980: 5),</page><page sequence="14">72 Arnab Chatterjee the 'given being' of animal life (ibid. : 10) rooted in natural heteronomy; while animal is animation or spirited life, bestiality is incest; the most ghostly/major sin - the only one with which animals could be dis tinguished4 from the human, yes! - neither by labour nor by language, as traditions have had it. And Bataille rightly, therefore, in this old fashioned way, has Claude LÃ©vi-Strauss as his primary interlocutor. But we must differ with him as his tiring anthropomorphism (as also in the sociological abstract of Carmeli (2003) cited in the beginning of this section) plots the animal as the negation of man or vice versa; the opposite of animal (or, animated, spirited life as above) is, actually, non life, de-animated, matter.5 Yet he is true to the extent that (if) man does negate animality, in order to disown his nature, man negates himself; he trains himself; he refuses... It still must be granted that the two negations by man - of the given world and of his own animality - are linked. It is not for us to give a priority to one or the other, to try to determine whether the training [in our case it appears in the form of prohibiting the animals to assert their nature] is the consequence of labor, or the labor is the consequence of moral mutation (Bataille 1991 : 52-53). Therefore, when, finally, the trainer is left to learn from the circus in the dark, he is actually left to train himself. To end this strenuous reading with a bit of Bataille as our instrument and purview, let us take on the metaphor of the sun and the noon. The trainer's plea to gravitate from the dark circus night and darker animals to the noon's 'exalted light of the sun' is reversed by the metaphor's own mythological burden of the signified and we shall allow Bataille to have the last say: the sun though often 'is confused with the notion of noon... is the most elevated conception. It is also the most abstract object, since it is impossible to look at it fixedly at that time of day...' (1986a: 57). It could be blinding if one does so 'adequately expressed by the horror emanating from a brilliant arc lamp' (ibid.) - (as in custodial interrogation). In the same way that the preceding sun (the one not looked at) is perfectly beautiful, the one that is scrutinized can be considered horribly ugly. In mythology, the scrutinized sun is identified with a man who slays a bull (Mithra), with a vulture that eats the liver (Prometheus): in other words, with the man who looks along with the slain bull or the eaten liver... [0]f course the bull himself is also an image of the sun, but only with his throat slit. The same goes for the cock, whose horrible and particularly solar cry always approximates the screams of a slaughter (ibid.).</page><page sequence="15">Subverting Sociologie? 73 To conclude, where is the will of the trainer traveling then? Against her/his willing grain, s/he journeys (or, is on his way to travel) from blood to more violent blood, from darkness to blindness, from madness to murder, from circus to slaughter vis-Ã -vis the myth of the sun and the noon. With this our de-structuring seems to have been complete but awaits a sociological, stable resolution: let us climb down to the margins of the earth again. Relevant to the pulls and pressure of our interest - how is it that the tusker in the circus could be claimed by the anti-circus animal rights activist as well as pro-children, pro-entertainment and thus the pro-circus lobbyists? Two provisional answers can be advanced. First, as the semiotics of the circus suggests, the circus, because it is a meta cultural system and manipulates culture by altering its codes, becomes relevant to the culture as such, and it is the very relevance of the circus to culture that accounts for the semi rejection of the circus by the culture. ...[Â¿Individuals who have not been fully integrated into a culture [for instance, children] find it more acceptable to enjoy this type of performance, as do individuals with a marginal unique status, such as poets and artists (Bouissac 1976: 8). The second explanation is: the animals are 'boundary objects' inhabiting several social worlds and their informational requirements at the same time (Marie 2008). To pose them as a pure object of natural/social, scientific, or commercial-sympathetic recognition is thus difficult; conflicting claims on the same object/subject arises from this transitional and shadowy presence, and their discursive appropriation, or even an attempt to it, is, therefore, never sufficient.

(Arnab Chatterjee) Annotation Though the poem was written with the Saddam event and the counter event as central, I was lost in between someone who could mobilise a narrative in favour of violence (Saddam Hussain or George W. Bush) and a lonesome, stray killer like Cho Seung-hui, who killed many without warning for reasons of his own, and finally got killed. The Virginia Tech massacre being over, hoax bomb alerts and false gun signals ran riot. How are we to understand these - aided by the poem, if we want to - as forms of mourning? This apart, how do we make sense of Cho Seung-hui's violent onslaught? The annotation argues, he could not sell his 'mental defects' to similar minded people (as Saddam Hussain or George Bush could do) and thus his grievances were not political and will never be taken seriously. It was those days in the early 1990s, when leaving my desolate college in Kolkata's Park Street, I used to walk down with 'shoes full of blood' to the American Center Library in Esplanade (which was there then) to read Gregory Corso and The American Poetry Review. It was</page><page sequence="17">Subverting Sociologie? 75 pretty exciting when I came across an adolescent monograph on postmodernism (edited by Ihab Hassan) in which there were praises for separate and lonely, unorganised acts of violence as being postmodem. I still remember at least two of those anecdotes: 'What is Stalin but a Chenghiz Khan with a telephone' and 'terrorists are the greatest entertainers of our time' (except for the victims)! Quotable quotes, of course (though neither Joseph Stalin nor Chenghiz Khan or the terrorists could be called lonely aggressors any way!). Having grown up in age, it seemed no longer interesting to grapple with things such as postmodernism - and 'post' others - and sit, being unwell, in an eternal 'post'-office, as if. But those two sentences remained in my mind and slept as quotations like two friends till Cho Seung-hui and his Virginia Tech massacre sparked that memory with bright light. If you had followed the incidents post Virginia Tech carnage, you will not but agree with me. In a US school campus, in the canteen somebody had left a small note: 'Shooting will start at dot 12 noon and it will be worse than Virginia Tech.' Immense snooping followed up the threat to find just nothing - it was a joke. A boy in a New Jersey college was arrested, as from the dorm he swayed his toy gun in ambivalence to a suspecting audience; at Oklahoma a man's umbrella was seized for a gun. A number of campuses had shut down to beef up security and return to normalcy. All in the United States of America. In India, for instance, one remembers, subsequent to Dhananjay Chatteijee's hanging (who was hanged for raping and murdering a minor girl), a number of adolescent deaths while aping that act. I still remember reading an interview in a Bengali daily of a boy who belonged to a group in which at least two such dramatic deaths celebrating Dhananjay's noose had been sadly reported. The kid said, 'Thank God! I've escaped; now in our group, it is the latest game; this Monday I was to be hanged - it was my date... ' To make sense of this, one needs to examine a number of play theories that we know. For instance, D.W. Winnicott observed that 'Play is immensely exciting' due to its 'precariousness' caused by 'the interplay of personal psychic reality and the experience of control of actual objects' (1971: 55), and precariousness understood more socio logically (if we may) - how, for a child, any violent act s/he perceives will be the subject of her/his next new game. But when so-called adults give hoax calls as bomb alerts, then how come s/he adopts the gesture of a playing, aping child? I think we need to take this with a pinch of sugar. This is how things become normalised (the way 'reading' normalises texts). Similarly, '9/11' or 'Carnage-Cho' will be memorialised as video games for the bore.</page><page sequence="18">76 Arnab Chatterjee It might be painful this way, but there is less cause for misunder standing if one reckons with the fact that these hoax callers, game players, joke makers are not at all insensitive people; they have real, moving tears in their eyes, which have not been planted. But, all the more, they can transform an event into an image, which having undergone this change, loses much of its cutting edge. Does not this beget an immense contradiction - that we must remember injuries, but remembering itself seeps away their strength and sharpness? This is peculiar and paradoxical! On a massacre, therefore, either a joke is invented, virtual games introduced, a cinema censored, stories written, documentaries made, novels forbidden! It is not only remembering, but also mourning (as all the hoax calls are mourning) in a very different way; even some mourning will not be permitted. It proves that all deaths are interpretive and allegorical. Or, how come people arrive for a feast (the shraddh) after a very near one has died? One popular explanation is, to forget the setback and get on with life again. An objection is easy: time itself fades the ruthlessness of pogroms and poetry continues to be written after Auschwitz; so, why do we need a joke or games have to be crafted to aid us in forgetting? Truly, time is a good leveller. But time takes time and if we agree that we live in an age of speed and trace, we need to undertake the duties that time performs and accomplish acts well before time. A hoax bomb alert is thus after an event, but it is well before time, too - for what 'remains to come'! Situated in between, it is mourning for the already dead; also for the deaths to come. No one can deny its message. It is meant for everybody, but the bomb being nowhere, it is for no body. This disillusionment is the consequence or cost of adopting an impossible duty that only time performs. This is the crux of the Virginia Tech carnage. Cho had complained that everybody in his audience had had a hundred chance to be saved from his gunfire, but could not avail them ('I want to be classical in all that/I'll have connections'). Teachers and pop-psychologists complained that signs were everywhere - in the country's errant gun laws to Cho's authored dramas, his 'unwanted' SMSs sent to campus girls, his 'old man' movie, his voice, his loneliness - that he was dangerous and 'sick' ('with the chemical weapon of tears we hzve/"saddamn"\\ - okay, yes, but "whose-sane", say?') and needed 'counselling' (though his so called ex-counsellors had released him with Cho showing 'normal' responses). Alas! It seems, signs, for both the perpetrator and the victims, were everywhere and nowhere. Now, to declare a war of extermination against 'the rich, the debauch and the deceitful charlatans' - which Cho said he did, in 2007, was, and still is, a sickness and a crime both; an anarcho-communist syndrome, as</page><page sequence="19">Subverting Sociologie? 77 if. Let us agree he was sick. The problem with Cho was he could not persuade others to go with him. In an age of unashamed commodi fication, he could not transform 'neurosis and even mild lunacy into a commodity which the afflicted can easily sell, once he has discovered that many others have an affinity for his own illness' (Adomo 1994: 223). Cho Seung-hui could not; but who could have done that? Theodor Adorno answers, 'The fascist agitator is usually a masterly salesman of his own psychological defects' {ibid.). Do Cho's critics want him to have been an anarcho-communist with the techniques of a proto-fascist? Well, it comes for the first time that Cho's acts will be praised as infinitely normal and (incomparably sane, not having had the potential to play a Hitler or a Pol Pot game. And, in the wake of this uncalled for praise, Cho's footage will be surrounded by (dead)bodies of those - all of whom were not rich, debauch, or cunning charlatans - equally, or perhaps not even minimally, gifted with Cho's itemised 'Mercedes' or 'Cognac'. They will stand (or sleep for ever) allegorically for perpetrators who were not present - a utopia again. Neither Cho would represent the 'weak and the defenceless', as he claimed. Cho is definitely a postmodern, unlike Che who had had his aims and enemies clear. Cho will definitely be cast out as fatalistically excessive and dumped in the dustbin of history. Conclusion 'Research poets listen for a poem to tell a story' (Lahman et al. 2011: 894, italics original). Are we 'research poets'? Have we been telling stories? Two stories in their finite but incomplete description, middle range totality? And, have they been adequate, or more could have been likened to this sense? Whatever, having completed our sampled, selective but laboured detour, now we could meditate on the consequences of such an exercise and take account of this initial, affirmative exclamation made by Vernonica, a participant-respondent in Lahman's project: There is something about the poetry format - the space, the shortened lines - that made me think more about what was being said/written. I got a sense of less formality in an educational sense, but more formality in a literary sense {ibid. : 892). A literary sociology in its pedagogic moment, as we have already noted before, would entail the imaginative and diverse uses of not only poetry but also fiction. This is far from diversifying the reading list for</page><page sequence="20">78 Arnab Chatterjee sociology students and including poems beside fictions and make the class interesting by introducing a slice of the real world into the drab dramaturgy of a sociology class. For instance, while teaching inequality through poetry (Moran 1999) - we are not, and ought not to be, insensitive to this more inclusive view of a 'sociology through literature'. The moment of poetic sociology, as we have argued before (like literature being the outside of language), is the outside of sociology situated 'in' the outside, opening to an exteriority and could be used to destroy the sociological binaries and subvert the sociologie in a relentless process of resumption and a consequent (in)completion: radical alterity. Students and teachers collectively could work upon to generate a piece of fiction or a poem from existing, and immediate, social and cultural events and it could be sent back to the sociological imagination, and back again. This has been our trial. While having to work on poetry collectively, students have welcomed the inclusion of personal, interpretive standpoints accompanied by the chance to contextualise them (Gordy and Peary 2005: 396). In the conservative view, such as that of Coser (1963), literary tracts (for us, poetry) could not and should not be allowed to supplant systematic sociology, but are only its 'nutritious' supplements. This is because Coser knew too well that if poetry could be used as a substitute, it could be a dangerous one. We have been a witness to this exercise: we are compelled to unsettle the stable sociologie and engage in wildly perilous interpretations. However, a good, imitable book length example of such 'research poetry' (if we are to use this phrase) written in sociological prose or poetic sociology, an example to turn to, is Simmel's translator Kurt Wolffs lesser known works (1976, 1989; see Ward 1993 for an introductory view). What is left to do now? After going through this more down to earth conclusion above, a friendly colleague asked, do we study Srinivas's stories more than his ethnographic accounts, Wolff more than Durkheim or Weber, Konrad and Berryman, Hart Crane and Dylan Thomas than all the sociologists combined and exclude your favourite Gilian Rose, too? Will that do? But are the students themselves ready to confront the deeply inward language of contemporary poetry and practise some of it? Do they have the skills? I agreed with the suggested lack, but with a reasonable regret, as Andrew Greeley puts it excellently: We are all born poets in the sense that our first cognitive activities involve the arrangements of symbols. We have to learn to write prose, and it takes a good deal of effort for us to learn how to think exclusively in prose. This, of course, is what graduate education in the social sciences is designed to teach, and it must be confessed that we are quite successful. Whatever</page><page sequence="21">Subverting Sociologie? 79 trace of the poet is left in a student after primary and secondary and higher education we successfully eliminate in his professional socialization and then we find it difficult to understand why his work is dull and uncreative (1971:225). Genealogically, poetry meant something created through literary work. So, in its etymology, the recognition of semiotic labour is evident. Close to skills and artisan craft, even if the storyteller is close to being dead in the Walter Benjaminian version, the poet is not. Literature when 'seen as a late medieval and Renaissance isolation of the skills of reading and of the qualities of the book' and poetry, also etymologically, as imaginative speech (Williams 1976: 153-54), it is possible to reinforce them through the practise of reading and tracing the escapade of the signifier from book to book. Yet my friendly interlocutor remained adamant and said, 'OK, we understand, but what do we tell our students then? What do we do? What is the resolution?' Now, it was necessary for me to show that I had people on my side, and marshalling courage, I cited: 'We believe the primary way one learns to write poetry is to read, read, read poetry; write, write, write poetry; edit, edit, edit poetry; and share, share, share poetry' (Lahman et al. 2011: 894). That's all! Notes I am grateful to my Ma, Mejdi, and Bacchiya for their presence in each line of the article when I was drafting it, thinking. To Pradip Kumar Bose and Surinder Singh Jodhka I owe special thanks for their supportive and inspiring cognitive bit; to Dalia Chakraborty, for helping me survive amidst my beautiful, involuntary poverty; to Aniruddha Choudhury (Dhruba) of York University, for appreciating the telos of this essay; to the anonymous referee, for, apart from providing two exceptional references I had missed out, for calling this essay 'excellent', and most of all to N. Jayaram, Managing Editor of Sociological Bulletin, for providing us an editorial horizon that we shall obligingly recall throughout our innumerable, disparate, and destroyed authorial lives. 1. The use of poems - even the teacher's or the students' poems - has been acknowledged and affirmed for the use of a teacher in the sociology class room (Samuels 1987: 59). 2. Paul Veyne makes a larger point here and should be noted for its prominence: 'the ancients distinguished between three things where we see only two. We contrast public life with private or everyday life. They distinguished between the city's business, private life and festivals.... [In] Polybius... and in 'Juvenal's panem et circenses' there is the same triple division (1990: 417). 3. I preferred this translation for its simplicity to "The animal has freedom of self movement because its subjectivity is, like light, ideality freed from gravity, a free time which, as removed from real externality, spontaneously determines its place' (Hegel 1970: 352; italics mine). 4. And such a suggestion that works on or urges us to work on the 'political mystery' of this distinction is illuminating (see Agamben 2004).</page><page sequence="22">80 Arnab Chatterjee 5.
