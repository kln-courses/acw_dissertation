<plain_text><page sequence="1">NEW METHODS OF OBTAINING NEUROTIC BEHAVIOR IN RATS By GEORGE HUMPHREY and FRED MARCUSE, Queen's University In a recent monograph,' Maier described certain disordered activities that he obtained in the rat. We have succeeded in duplicating his results by techniques entirely different from his. Maier used Lashley's jumping- board technique, according to which the rat jumps from a platform at one of two patterns, behind one of which is food. Acutely disordered behavior ("neurotic") was produced when one pattern was removed, leaving the animal no choice but at the same time forcing it to jump by turning a jet of air upon it. We have used a new series of stimuli, graded in severity, partly on normal rats, partly on a small group of animals in which chronically disordered behavior has been induced by a method to be described. The method apparently permits of differentiation between these two groups, and clearly contrasts what may be called a chronic and a traumatic stage of abnormal behavior. In order to induce chronically disordered behavior, 10 rats were trained by daily runs for 25 days in a Warner-Warden multiple Y-maze, set up in the type left, right, left, right, foodbox. The foodbox had no bottom so that the rat and its food were in direct contact with the floor of the room. With 6 of the animals the foodbox was moved along the floor, after the animal was in the box and the door closed. Movement was care- fully effected so as not to cause pain; the extent of movement varied from 4 to 10 ft., with no appreciable effect on immediate behavior, except that the animals did not eat until movement ceased. The relation of this move- ment to the animal was something like that of a revolving door, which is being pushed by someone else, to a pedestrian. The remaining 4 rats were trained in the ordinary way, with a stationary foodbox. Results. (a) Chronically disordered behavior. The 6 rats whose food- boxes were moved were consistently above the 4 unmoved controls in their scores, both for time and error. The 4 controls satisfied the criterion for learning; namely, 5 errorless runs, within 16 days, but not one of the 6 experimental rats did so within 25 days. The curves for the experi- mental animals are strikingly more irregular than those of the controls, both in time and errors. At the same time there appeared in the experi- * Accepted for publication August 10, 1939. 1N. R. F.

(1) "Belly-crawling"-i.e. crawling upon the belly through part of the maze or when finally moving into the foodbox-was observed in the behavior of all 6 experimental animals and on several occasions by each of them. (2) Loud gnashing of the teeth was frequently heard-louder than the chattering that these animals ordinarily make. (3) Spasmodic starts from one side to the other of a cul-de-sac were common; as was also (4) shivering. There was (5) frequent biting of the door of the foodbox and also at the metal mesh at the top of the culs-de-sac. The rats (6) frequently moved hesitatingly back and forth a few inches at a time when they arrived at the entrance to the foodbox. When half way into the foodbox, they would frequently (7) withdraw-sometimes com- pletely retracing the maze (with or without errors) and then return again to the foodbox (with or without errors). All these actions were observed in all the rats during the 25 days of their training.2 None of them was observed in any of the control animals. Further analysis showed that while the experimental animals never learned the maze in the sense that they achieved errorless runs into the foodbox, 5 of the 6 learned to run as far as the door of the foodbox without error. In that they achieved the criterion of 5 errorless runs by times varying from the 12th to the 27th day. That is to say, these animals ran to the door of the foodbox, probably to within sight of the food, without a mistake-and did that on 5 successive trials. They then retraced their steps making mistakes, behaving abnormally and so on, spending in this way the rest of the time before they entered the foodbox. The sixth experimental animal did not even learn to reach the door of the foodbox without error during the 25 trials. It is hard not to use anthropomorphic terms in describing these animals. The most natural description seems to be that the animals knew the way to the foodbox but were prevented from entering it by some conflicting motive. In terms lately made fashionable by Lewin, one may say that there was apparently present a cognitive structure corresponding to the maze, with conflicting valencies at the foodbox. The conflict is evidently one which is very difficult, perhaps impossible for the animal to resolve.3 It 'No attempt was made to make a quantitative record of such behavior. The records show teeth chattering, 22 observations; belly crawling, 20; spasmodic starts, 16; shivering, 15; biting at door, 14. Since more than one person was engaged in training the rats, which in the case of the abnormal animals is a very protracted business, and since no scheme of annotation was adopted until late in the experi- ment, these figures are suggestive rather than exact. Except by some special device, such as was adopted by one rat who made a practice of snatching out the food before the door of the foodbox could be closed.</page><page sequence="3">HUMPHREY AND MARCUSE apparently induces a condition of 'nervous strain' which results in the chronically disordered activity above described. It may be mentioned that 85 rats were handled during the experiment by the junior author, who was bitten 4 times in all, each time by one of the chronically disordered animals. Total daily errors of a separate group of 4 animals trained similarly were temporarily reduced, by 2 cc. of a 10% solution of alcohol, from 9 to 0, and the average running-time was reduced from 22 sec. to 7 sec. These effects occurred the day after the alcohol was given them- the 38th day of the experiment. A similar result was obtained after a second dose of alcohol-given 5 days later. This finding is reported as suggestive rather than as scientifically conclusive. (b) Acutely disordered behavior. Maier reports highly excitable be- havior in his rats, followed by a plastic phase, in which the animal could be taken in the hand lying on its back, and its limbs 'moulded' by the experimenter. We have obtained these effects by a procedure different from his. Stimuli of three grades were used. S, consisted of ringing an electric bell (2 dry cells) for 3 min. on the floor of the carton on the upper surface of which the animal was placed. S2 consisted of ringing the bell for 3 min. close up to the cage, and on the same plane with it. S3 consisted in swinging the cage gently 5 or 6 times with an oscillation of 180? while the bell was ringing in the position of S2. Thus S,, S2, and S3 were of progressive degrees of 'severity.' Experiments were mainly confined to Si and S3, though seizures were obtained by all three methods. Table I shows the results obtained at the first trial of the stimulus in question. S2 was not used at a first trial. TABLE I NUMBER OP SEIZURES OBTAINED AT FIRST TRIAL OF THE VARIOUS STIMULUS-GRADES grade S1 24 - o Normal S - 26 I Ss 23 - II Chron. dis. Si 6 - 3 It will be seen that while S3 induces seizures in nearly 50% of normal male rats, Si has no effect on 24 males and induces a seizure in only 1 of 26 females. On the other hand, S1 induces seizures in 3 (i.e. 50%) of 6 chronically disordered males. This was a rational solution of the problem; the animal obtained the food without being moved. The records show that this animal's performance improved in time and errors after he had found this solution and before means were taken to bar it. 618</page><page sequence="4">NEW METHODS OF OBTAINING NEUROTIC BEHAVIOR IN RATS 619 (c) Nature of seizure. The seizure as observed by us consists essentially in very violent motor activity. The animal begins by violent jumping round the cage, from one to another of the four walls, hardly pausing between each jump. Sometimes he appears to wound his nose during this behavior. When the cage door is opened, he leaps out on to the floor, rushes madly round and round in circles, or straight across the room, bumping headlong into chair legs and walls, and at times making great leaps across the floor. There is sometimes a peculiar noise, between a grunt and a squeak. Sometimes the rat leaps up directly into the air. One stunned itself for over a minute. Functional paralysis of the front legs often developed during seizure. In all, 40 seizures were observed. Of these, 28 were obtained from 3 rats; and of these 28, 6 were produced by SI, 3 by S2, and the rest (19) by S3. All three of these disordered rats became adapted to Sx and S2 after two or three stimulations, and there- after S3 was used. (d) Plastic phase. As observed by us, the plastic phase consists in complete inactivity immediately succeeding the excited phase. The animal can be taken in the hand, laid on its back and its legs stretched out or moulded,to use Maier's term. The feet and tail are bluish, the nose red, possibly owing to wounding in the cage. The hind toes are often rigidly outstretched, in contrast to the closed toes of the front feet. There is loss of the reflex to tickling the feet and in three cases there was loss of the blink reflex to a puff of air. A sharp pinch of the tail or pulling the vibrissae has no effect. The neck is drawn up in a peculiarly stiff posture. Summary. Acute neurotic behavior was produced on 40 occasions in 15 rats, by a graded series of stimuli. The least 'severe' stimulus, pro- duced seizures in 3 of 6 chronically disordered male rats, had no effect on 24 normal males, and produced a seizure in one of 26 normal females. The most 'severe' stimulus produced seizures in 11 of 23 normal males. The rats were throughout in good physical condition, as far as could be judged. Experiments are now proceeding to effect a standardization of the stimuli and, since the number of the chronically disordered animals is admittedly small, to confirm the results on a larger scale.</page></plain_text>
