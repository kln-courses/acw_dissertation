[Volumes 2-3 are the posthumous publication of this Ei- narson-Link translation of this seminal work of Theophrastus of Eresus in Lesbos (372-370 to 288- 286 B.C.). Volume 1 has Einarson's 61-page introduction on Theophrastus and translates his Books 1-2; volume 2 translates Books 3-4; volume 3 translates Books 5-6 and gives appendices, including one on the lost Book 7. In the same Loeb classical library series (vols. 70, 79) is Sir Arthur Hort's 1916 translation of Theophrastus's Historia plantarum (for Suzanne Amigues's new French trans. see Bot. J. Linn. Soc. 102: 101) and other works, the translation entitled Enquiry into plants, and minor works on odours and weather signs (2 vols., xxvii, 475, ix, 499 pp., unillus. exc. fp., Ibid.). These are Theophrastus's two surviving important botanical works that, and this might be of some interest to molecular biologists, cause him to be widely acknowledged as the "Father of Botany," his mentor Aristotle being the "Father of Zoology." The Historia classifies and describes nearly 480 types of plants, including trees, plants of various regions, shrubs, herbs, cereals, and pulses. The last of its nine books treats plant juices and medicinal properties of herbs. Books 1-2 of De causis treat gen- eration, sprouting, flowering, fruiting, and the effects of climate and agriculture, Books 3-4 cultiva- tion and agricultural methods, and Books 5-6 plant breeding, diseases and other causes of death, and distinctive flavors and odors. The lost Book 7 was on manufactured flavors (and odors) and apparently dealt largely with wine and oil. On odours continues the theme, dealing with manufac- tured perfumes and unguents. To see how far botany has progressed in the past 2300 years (my quick research failed to reveal when Theophrastus's works were written) see the impressive sum- mary effort by James D.

Vol. 2, in press, will treat Picea to Widdringtonia, propagation, and pests and diseases. The t.p. notes "this book represents a full revision and up-dating of' P. den Ouden's (in coll. with B. K. Boom) Manual of cultivated conifers hardy in the cold- and warm-temperate zone (1965, 1978 reprint, x, [ii], 526 pp.) and Welch's Manual of dwarf conifers (1979, x, 493 pp.).] In recent years a spate of manuals on gymnosperms (often calling them "conifers") have appeared (see Taxon 36: 311, 534, 547, 666, 668-669, 690, 38: 452, 469, 611-612, 617, 39: 282, 40: 359-360, 361, Perry entry above). Most deal with horticultural aspects. Bibliographic information is given here for two works to make a point or two below: Kriissmann, Gerd. Manual of cultivated conifers [2nd ed.].

(B&amp;W), ISBN 0-8160-1735-2 (HB), $27.95. [Publ. in Britain by Christopher Helm, Bromley. See also Taxon 38: 469.] This updating of the two earlier works noted in the Contents above is a most valuable treatment of 41 genera, 182 species and hybrids (9 genera sans mention of species), and many infraspecific taxa. Technical data for many of the species include, as appropriate, sections on size and habit, the trunk, branches, branchlets, winter buds, leaves, "flowers," mature cones, bracts, seeds, habitat, and cultivation. Besides giving detailed information on infraspecific taxa, as pp. 263-279 on 51 cultivars (not all valid) of Cryptomeria japonica, Welch offers some novel ecological conclusions, as Micros- trobus occurring "under shelving rocks at the base of waterfalls ... seems to be more the result of the ravages of fire than the requirements of the plants themselves" (p. 425). Falling into the prov- ince of "conifer" are Ephedra, curtly dismissed as "straggly bushes of no garden value" (p. 317), and naturally Ginkgo (pp. 317-321). Ephedra needs reappraisal, for E. chilensis with its thick, ivory, fleshy bracts is most attractive (e.g., see E. M. Gifford &amp; A. S. Foster, Morphology and evolution of vascular plants, 1989, 3rd ed., p. 472). Incidentally, Kriissmann discusses 26 species of Ephedra (pp. 115-118, pls. 56-57; also Ginkgo). The typography of Welch's book is excellent, though notation of species and cultivars in the running heads would have been useful. Pages 63-89 are "simple 'guides to identification of species"' (p. 62). These begin with a listing of "the twelve main groups" (p. 64), which then have many diagrams and 60 subgroups (my term, 1-11 540</page><page sequence="2">AUGUST 1991 subgroups/group, average of 5), and within three subgroups a total of 16 subsubgroups (again my term). None of this is dichotomous or indeed parallel in construction. In fact, Welch argues against dichotomous keys on p. 62. In addition, there are "guides" for Abies, Cupressus, and Juniperus (resp., pp. 98-100, 290-291, 324-325), actually tables for the first two, and finally even a dichotomous key for Chamaecyparis (p. 196). On the downside are use of angiosperm terminology ("flowers," "fruits," etc.), anthropomorphic and teleological expressions (among the worst, species that "laughed," a plant that "wakes up slowly" in the spring, p. 32), various slips (e.g., "Johnson" for "Johnston," p. 317), fuzzy language (Diselma in mountains of "Australia and W. Tasmania," p. 317), and erroneous ranges (Fitzroya cupressoides "only in southern Chile," p. 317, a mistake also in Krussmann, p. 119). I examined the manuals by Welch, Rushforth, Kriissmann, and three others, including W. Dallimore &amp; A. B. Jackson's A hand- book of Coniferae and Ginkgoaceae (1966, 4th ed. rev. by S. G. Harrison) to seek morphological and horticultural information (but not especially information on cultivars) on Ginkgo and 12 species of conifers. All show similar slips and fuzziness. Indeed the disagreement and misinformation perpet- uated from one book to the next is rather disconcerting. Welch's work naturally is vital for an up- dating of nomenclatural and taxonomic aspects of the many infraspecific taxa he treats. Unfortu- nately, the high cost of the book, ca. $137.75 for the first of two volumes, will restrict its acquisition to botanical libraries. Individuals needing a "conifer manual" will get much better value for their money spending $65.00 on Kriissmann or $27.95 on Rushforth. [Rudolf Schmid, UC] Woodland, Dennis W.

He appears to have succeeded, though the proof will be in the pudding sales. The book covers the requisite topics, including a useful chapter with con- tributions by four outsiders (see Contents) that distills Stuessy's new Davis &amp; Heywood (for review see R. Schmid, Taxon 40: 361-362), and 245 handy, compact summaries for vascular plant families. The 210 family synopses for the angiosperms are ringed with a border and involve one page per fam- ily except for grasses and comps, which slop onto two pages (legumes are split into three families). Students will be intrigued by the many photos of botanists and botanical institutions and by the fig- ures of newspaper clippings on plant rustling (p. 468), the letter to John Thomas by a student who is endangering plants (p. 473), and the phylogeny of paper clips (p. 399).
