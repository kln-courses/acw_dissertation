<plain_text><page sequence="1">AL-KINDI'S ETHICS TH?R?SE-ANNE DRUART ITXEDiEVAL Arabic philosophical ethics is a much neglected field. Not many texts have survived. Some of them are rather popular and belie the assumption that Medieval Arabic philosophy is essentially Aristotelian. For instance, al-Kindi, Abu Bakr al-Razi, Avicenna, and Miskawayh all wrote about treating sadness. Were philosophers at the time subject to acute bouts of depression? or did they have some serious philosophical reasons to deal with this topic? How can one conciliate the popular and highly successful genre of the "Spiritual Medicine," which considers passions as diseases of the soul that are badly in need of eradication, with the need for a rigorous normative ethics? As Islam and its Sharia provide detailed ethical prescriptions and prohibitions, as well as guidance for any situation in the life of pious Muslims, how can philosophy vindicate the autonomy and im portance of philosophical ethics? Can it be done on Aristotelian grounds? Why do serious philosophers devote such efforts to "Spir itual Medicine," a very un-Aristotelian enterprise? Such questions are puzzling. To even begin answering them, we need to study carefully the works of each philosopher in order to understand on their own terms what place and what role they assign to ethics, and then to analyze their ethical works to determine their purpose, audience, and philosophic worth. Al-Kindi, who is known as "The Philosopher of the Arabs" and who died in about 870 a.D.,1 is the first Arabic philosopher to have 1 The best introduction to al-Kindi remains George N. Atiyeh, Al-Kindi: The Philosopher of the Arabs (Rawalpindi: Islamic Research Institute, 1966). Atiyeh discusses the date of al-Kindi's death on p. 8 and in n. 9 on pp. 15-16.

A careful exam ination of his works may well offer clues to dealing with a whole tra dition. Besides, The Art of Dispelling Sorrows provides some solace for our loss of his other ethical works. For centuries it incited other thinkers to write on the same subject or to paraphrase it. It is a prime example of "Spiritual Medicine" at its best. Understanding it allows one to make sense of this tradition. Before carefully analyzing The Art of Dispelling Sorrows we will trace back this text to its theoretical framework. We will first delin eate al-Kindi's conception of ethics, then determine the underlying principle of his ethics, and finally examine his understanding of free dom. Once these three themes have determined the theoretical framework we will study how they are put into practice in The Art of Dispelling Sorrows. This will clearly show that al-Kindi's ethics, though rather innocent of Aristotelianism, is not without interest. I Al-Kindi's Conception of Ethics. The role and place of ethics in al-Kindi's classification of the sciences is difficult to determine, since his treatises on this issue are lost.3 An examination of incidental state ments in various works and in his On the Number of Aristotle's Books,4 tered, but one volume which contains Spanish translations of most of his philosophical texts is Obras filos?ficas de al-Kind?, ed. and trans. Rafael Ram?n Guerrero and Emilio Tornero Poveda (Madrid: Editorial Coloquio, 1986). Other translations, particularly into English, will be indicated when they are available. 2 Not many of al-Kindi's works have reached us, and most of those are rather brief or even?in the case of On First Philosophy?truncated. Then chronology is generally obscure. All this makes their interpretation difficult and tentative to such a point that recently Herbert A. Davidson claimed that "the character of [al-Kindi's] writings should dissuade us from the temptation to harmonize the divergent positions that he embraced on different occa sions"; Herbert A. Davidson, Alfarabi, Avicenna, and Averroes, on Intellect: Their Cosmologies, Theories of the Active Intellect, and Theories of Human Intellect (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992), 34. Though Davidson may well be right in what concerns al-Kindi's views on the intellect, we should resist the temptation not to attempt to look for some continuous threads on other themes even if details may differ. 3 For instance, On the Nature of Science and its Parts, and The Parts of Human Science.

Al-Kindi follows the Alexandrian tradition in distinguishing the practice of ethics as prerequisite to the study of philosophy from theoretical ethics grounded in metaphysics or first philosophy.5 That al-Kindi embodies the Alexandrian tradition in considering logic and mathematics?including astronomy, music and some natural sciences?as prerequisite for the study of philoso phy proper is well known. Al-Kindi even offers a particular twist in giving the lion's share to mathematics. It therefore comes as no sur prise that he uses so many mathematical arguments in his metaphys ical treatises. For instance, On the Proximate Efficient Cause of Gen eration and Corruption ends with the statement that "all that we have said is obvious to anyone well schooled in astronomy and natural sci ence, but anyone who falls short from this will also fall short in his understanding of what we explained, precisely because of his falling short of serious knowledge of astronomy and natural things."6 Does al-Kindi also claim that the practice of ethics is prerequisite for the study of philosophy? Yes, because reason or intellect can work prop erly only if it dominates the passions, which are represented mainly by anger (the irascible part of the soul) and sensual desires (the con cupiscible part of the soul), but which also include sorrow7 and other such passions. Control, if not extirpation, of the passions precedes sound intel lectual understanding. For instance, the Introduction to God's One ness and the Finiteness of the Body of the Universe tells us that this issue would require long explanation and much research, except for someone "who has reached your degree of theoretical thought (na zar), ... is helped by an understanding (fahm) such as yours, and is prevented from inclination to passion by means of a determination Aristotele," in Atti della Reale Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei 334, Memorie d?lia Classe di Scienze Morali, Storiche e Filologiche, serie 6, 15 (1937); vol. 6 (Roma- 1937), 375-419. 5 See Dimitri Gutas, Avicenna and the Aristotelian Tradition: Intro duction to Reading Avicenna's Philosophical Works (Leiden: E.

Except when otherwise stated all translations are my own. 7 Though to my knowledge al-Kindi never explores the relation between sorrow and the two parts of the soul, he seems to conceive of sorrow as an affect of both these parts.</page><page sequence="4">332 TH?R?SE-ANNE DRUART like yours ( azm)."s Not only must control of passion precede sound intellectual understanding, but it also should accompany it even after some theoretical thought has been acquired. The first chapter of On First Philosophy attacks contemporary scholars famous for their theo retical thought (nazar) but in fact strangers to the truth, not only be cause of their lack of real knowledge but also because of the envy (hasad) that controls their animal soul.9 Al-Kindi does not hesitate to claim that these religious scholars "traffic in religion, though they are devoid of religion."10 This highlights the dependence of truth recognition on control of passion. The theme of conflicts between intellect and passion?be it an ger or sensual desire?is at the heart of the argument for the tripar tition of the soul in The Discourse on the Soul.11 For al-Kindi the three parts of the soul are the intellective, the irascible, and the con cupiscible. On the Proximate Efficient Cause of Generation and Corruption completes the picture by laying down the following dic tum: "The acts of the soul follow the mix of bodily humors which itself follows variations in the positions of the celestial bodies" (RKF, 224-5). Obviously al-Kindi sees a close relation between character and climate. People living below the equator are strongly affected by the heat emanating from the celestial bodies and, therefore, are 8 RKF, 201.

As for those who inhabit better climes, that is, zones closer to the North pole, they are often interested in theoretical thought (nazar) and research because their character traits are justly proportioned (RKF, 225-6). Proper character building, understood as the domination exer cised by the intellect over the passions, is thus not only requisite for the fruitful study of philosophy and the quest for truth but must also accompany each of its steps. One may wonder whether such ethical preparation coincides with common moral or religious education or requires a more technical or scientific approach?as mathematics and logic obviously do. If this is the case, philosophers need to provide some kind of "intermediate" or prephilosophical ethics which would shake some of the common views and incite people to the pursuit of philosophical studies. Our analysis of The Art of Dispelling Sorrows will show that to shake common views and to incite people to philos ophy are the two aims of this text. Philosophical ethics proper, on the other hand, has its place at the end of the curriculum. In On the Number of Aristotle's Books al Kindi, who claims that the study of Aristotle's books on ethics is of utmost utility for philosophy, states that these books can be fully understood only after the study of what does not need bodies in any way. Ethics is the "fruit of this science," namely, metaphysics, though "in some way ethical books pertain to the discourse on the soul."12 This is not surprising, since al-Kindi has just indicated that although the soul in this life is in a body, it does not need this body for its existence and subsistence.13 A study of the incorporeal soul, however, is not enough to ground ethics, since its full understanding requires metaphysics. Does this mean that any approach to ethics 12 RKF, 369; Guidi and Walzer, "Scritto introduttivo," sec. 3, p. 393. On ethics in On the Number of Aristotle's Books see Charles E. Butterworth, "Al Kindi and the Beginnings of Islamic Political Philosophy," in The Political Aspects of Islamic Philosophy: Essays in Honor of Muhsin S. Mahdi, ed. Charles E. Butterworth (Cambridge: Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Harvard University, 1992), 14-32. 13 Al-Kindi does not really place psychology in physics in the way the Aristotelian tradition does, but he gives it a special status. Complete under standing of psychology requires metaphysics. See Guidi and Walzer, "Scritto introduttivo," 378-80.

Whatever the case, al-Kindi takes ethics to lead "to full human excellence [fad?lah] which is the aim of the naturally upright human being both in this life and in the hereafter."14 The end of On the Number of Aristotle's Books recaps the whole curriculum and claims that anyone who wants to study philosophy must begin with mathematics and logic, and then move to physics, metaphysics, and finally ethics. On First Philosophy makes the de pendence of ethics on metaphysics a particular application of a much broader principle. Since "knowledge of the first cause has truthfully been called 'First Philosophy', [and] since the rest of philosophy is contained in its knowledge,"15 theoretical ethics, as well as other philo sophical disciplines, requires a knowledge of the first cause, that is, a knowledge of God. It is unfortunate that al-Kindi does not tell us much about what exactly constitutes philosophical ethics. In fact, what he says about Aristotle's ethical and political texts is rather vague. This raises the suspicion that al-Kindi, at least at the time he wrote this text if not during his whole career, had little access to these texts, and to the Nicomachean Ethics in particular, even though he refers to the latter by name.16 He even attributes to Aristotle the view that "happiness is excellence at each instant, excellence in soul and body and also in what is external to both body and soul."17 The parallel between the excellence of soul and body is more reflective of the tradition of spir itual medicine than of Aristotle's own views. The near absence of Aristotelian influence is also clear in the two main texts relevant for a study of al-Kindi's ethics, The Discourse on the Soul and The Art of 14 RKF, 369. 15 RKF, 101; Al-Kindi's Metaphysics, 56. (Ivry's translation.) 16 Guidi and Walzer believe that al-Kindi had rather scant knowledge of Aristotle's psychology and ethics; see Guidi and Walzer, "Scritto introduttivo," 382-4. 17 RKF, 384. It is noteworthy that al-Kindi, as we shall see, indirectly argues against such a conception of happiness in The Art of Dispelling Sor rows. There true happiness focuses on the soul?or more precisely, the intellect alone?and there is a clear denial of the importance of external things and possessions.</page><page sequence="7">AL-KINDI'S ETHICS 335 Dispelling Sorrows. This fact explains why M?jid Fakhry character izes al-Kindi's ethical thought as Socratic18 and Stoic because of its insistence on suppressing passion.19 Before moving to al-Kindi's basic ethical principle it is useful to turn to al-Kindi's definition of philosophy in On First Philosophy, his most detailed metaphysical work. It defines philosophy as "knowl edge of the true nature of things, insofar as it is possible for the human being."20 "The aim of the philosopher is, as regards his knowledge, to attain the truth, and as regards his action, to act in conformity with truth."21 This again indicates an intimate connection between knowl edge and action. Not only is there an intrinsic dependence of proper action on proper knowledge, but it seems too that knowledge which does not lead to appropriate action is not true knowledge. There is clear evidence for the former claim, as we saw, but the latter is merely implied. Later on, al-Kindi somewhat unfolds the meaning of knowl edge of the true nature of things: [It] includes knowledge of Divinity, oneness [al-wahdaniyyah22], and excellence [fiul?lah], and a complete knowledge of everything useful, and of the way to it; and a distance from anything harmful, with precau tions against it. It is the acquisition of all this which the true messengers 18 Following a late Hellenistic tradition al-Kindi collected Socratic say ings in a way that rolled Diogenes the Cynic and Socrates into one. The late Hellenistic tradition had already made of Socrates a kind of traditional ar chetype, the hero of the philosophical epos. 19 Mqjid Fakhry, Ethical Theories in Islam (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1991), 67. On the knowledge of Socrates in Medieval Arabic literature, see liai Al?n, Socrates in Mediaeval Arabic Literature (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1990). On al Kindi's collection of Socratic sayings, see M. Fakhry, "Al-Kindi and Socrates," Al-Abhath 16 (1963): 23-34 (in Arabic). The influence of the Socratic sayings is also clear in The Sayings of al-Kindi, edited and translated into English by Atiyeh in his Al-Kindi, 216-57. Butterworth examines al-Kindi's Socratic perspective in his "Al-Kindi," 52-8.

For the true messengers . . . brought but an affirmation of the Divinity of God alone, and an adherence to excel lences, which are pleasing to Him; and relinquishment of vices, which are contrary to excellences both in themselves and in their effects.23 Philosophy and true religion both conjoin knowledge of God?be it through metaphysics or revelation?and ethics. If indeed true ethics is grounded not only in knowledge of the soul but ultimately in knowledge of God, then we can understand why philosophical ethics at its most sophisticated requires metaphysics. Such an understanding of ethics reflects the old definition of philoso phy as imitation of God as far as it is possible for a human being. In fact the move from understanding the soul to reflecting on God or the first cause in order to ground ethics is exemplified in The Discourse on the Soul, which begins with a definition of the soul as simple and noble, and connects this nobility to the imitation of God. II Al-Kindi's Fundamental Ethical Principle. Obviously, the ethi cal implications of conceiving philosophy as imitation of God will de pend on al-Kindi's conception of God, since imitation presupposes at least some knowledge of that one imitates. This plunges us at once into a difficulty since, on the one hand, al-Kindi speaks of the imitation of God?that is, the attempt to make oneself similar to God (tashab buh, fifth form of shabaha)?but on the other hand, he also denies that God would be in any way similar to his creation. Once this dif ficulty is solved we will see that the suppression of passion is one aspect of this imitation of God. The other implication will concern the heavenly bodies or celestial spheres. Philosophy as the Imitation of God. The definition of philosophy as imitation of God, of course, has its origin in Plato's Theaetetus, which speaks of "homoi?sis the?i" (176b). Later on, this definition was picked up by the Alexandrian tradition and became popular in 23 RKF, 104; Al-Kindi's Metaphysics, 59. (Ivry's translation, with modi fications.)</page><page sequence="9">AL-KINDI'S ETHICS 337 Arabic philosophical circles.24 Al-Kindi is fully aware of this defini tion. It is one of the six definitions of philosophy listed in On the Definitions and Descriptions of Things and is used rather extensively in The Discourse on the Soul. In On the Definitions the Kindian for mulation gives this definition an interesting twist.25 First, it is pre sented as a definition of philosophy given by the Ancients from its effect (fil), that is, its result. Second, it is an imitation of God's ac tions ?af?l). Third, al-Kindi interprets it as meaning that "the human being should have perfect excellence [fad?ah]." That this definition focuses on the effect of philosophy reinforces the connection between knowledge and deeds. In fact two of the definitions al-Kindi gives are taken from philosophy's effect. The first one defines philosophy as the imitation of God's actions. It is im mediately followed by the second, "Being mindful of death," for "in [the] view [of the Ancients] death is twofold: natural, that is, the soul ceasing to make use of the body, and secondly, the killing of sensual desires; it is the second which they meant here, because the killing of sensual desires is the way to excellence."26 This, of course, leads us back to the theme of suppression of passion and suggests that the imitation of God implies suppression of the passions. As for the qualification that the imitation of God focuses on God's actions, Gimaret rightly points out that this new formulation avoids claiming one could really make oneself similar to God himself.27 The imitation concerns itself with God's actions and not with God's es sence. This is a first hint that al-Kindi will be careful to maintain God's transcendence and to eschew any implication of "shared divinity" (shirk), an implication which would be unacceptable both philosophi cally and religiously. Finally, al-Kindi's surmising that by means of this formulation the Ancients meant that a human being should have perfect excellence is 24 See Dimitri Gutas, Greek Wisdom Literature in Arabic Translation: A Study of the Greco-Arabic Gnomologia (New Haven: American Oriental Society, 1975), 116-17.

In his Explanation on the Prostration of the Outer most Sphere and its Obedience to God, a commentary on Koran 55:5, al-Kindi attributes excellences to God.28 Human excellence thus not only reflects God's but takes its origin from God's excellence. The Discourse on the Soul, which purports to be abridged from what al-Kindi calls the book of Aristotle, from Plato, and from some other philosophers, refers extensively to the imitation of God. This is not surprising since contrary to what one might infer from its title, the book makes little use of Aristotle but rather borrows heavily from Neoplatonic sources.29 The text begins with a statement on the soul, attributed to no one, but which gives the tone for the whole work by moving immediately from the soul to God. "The soul is simple, has nobility, perfection, and great dignity. Its substance proceeds from the substance of the Creator just as sunlight proceeds from the sun."30 Then, having carefully distinguished the sun or Creator from its light or creation, the text goes on to add that the spiritual and "divine" character of its substance "arises from the nobility of its nature and its opposition to what pertains to the body, such as sensual desires and anger" (RKF, 273). This immediately links the incorporeality and simplicity of the human soul to its opposition to the body and to the theme of the suppression of passion. 28 ?These [the motions of the celestial bodies bringing potencies to ac tuality] are those by means of which you may become aware of the greatness of God's power, the breadth of his generosity, and the emanation of his ex cellences [faydfadd'ilihi]"; RKF, 259-60. 29 RKF, 272-80; French paraphrase by A. Badawi, Histoire de la Philo sophie en Islam, 2:427-33; Spanish translation with interesting introduction by Rafael Ram?n Guerrero, "La tradici?n griega en la filosof?a ?rabe: el tema del alma en al-Kind?," Al-Qantara 3 (1982): 1-26. For the Neoplatonic influ ence see also Atiyeh, Al-Kindi, 99-100. The imitation of God is central to the anonymous Neoplatonic ethical treatise surviving in Arabic and edited by Abdurrahman Badawi in his Aristotelis Ethica Nicomachea (Kuwait: Kuwait University Press, 1979), 389-445. For a brief study of this text see M. C. Lyons, "A Greek Ethical Treatise," Oriens 13-14 (1960-61): 35-57. For a study of other Greek sources, see Charles G?n?quand, "Platonism and Her metism in al-Kindi's F? al-nafs," Zeitschrift fur Geschichte der arabisch-is lamischen Wissenschaften^ (1987-88): 1-18. 30 RKF, 273. The soul that al-Kindi calls simple must be the intellective soul only, since this soul is contrasted to the irascible and concupiscible. In The Explanation of the Prostration (RKF, 255) al-Kindi states most clearly that the soul has three faculties. Al-Kindi's interest in the simplicity of the soul led to his writing a treatise on this subject; see Atiyeh, Al-Kindi, 193 n. 193.</page><page sequence="11">AL-KINDI'S ETHICS 339 Moving then to Plato's views, some of which he explicitly en dorses, al-Kindi gives us what he takes to be Plato's conclusion: The intellectual souls of those whose goal in this world is the ery oyment of various kinds of food and drink, which become transformed into pu trescent matter and whose aim is the pleasure of copulation, are inca pable of attaining the knowledge of these noble things [i.e., the incor poreal beings] and cannot achieve the imitation of the Creator. (RKF, 274) Still supposedly paraphrasing Plato, al-Kindi indicates that a human being dominated by sensual desires is like a pig?a very impure animal in an Islamic context?and one dominated by the irascible is like a dog, but a human being dominated by the intellective soul is like an angel. Not only does such a one know "the true natures of things" but he is also "an excellent person close to resembling the Creator [notice the carefulness of this formulation] for the things which belong to the Creator are wisdom, power, justice, goodness, beauty, and truth. Human beings likewise may sometimes31 govern their souls insofar as it is possible for a human being, and so become wise, just, generous, good, and prefer the true and the beautiful."32 In this way the human being is able to participate to a small degree in some of God's excel lences, which are presented as positive attributes. The soul's prox imity to God's power endows it with a power resembling God's. Things get even better after death, when the soul liberated from the body comes to know all else?as the Creator does?or to a somewhat lesser degree because it receives this knowledge from the Creator's light. At that stage the soul's status in the realm of intellect becomes "higher than the realm of the celestial sphere," probably because ce lestial spheres will remain bound to a body (RKF, 275-6). Introducing then another philosopher, probably Pythagoras, al Kindi again states the necessity of abandoning sensual desires and undergoing purification. He uses the famous Neoplatonic comparison of the soul to a mirror in need of serious polishing. Pythagoras?if indeed it is he?claims that after death, thanks to God's light and mercy, we will be close to the Creator's light and mercy (RKF, 276-7). The incorporeal soul's proximity to God increases with its distance from the body and its two lower faculties. Reverting to Plato, al-Kindi 31 With an emendation to "qad yumkinu 1-insana"; RKF, p. 275,1. 3. 32 RKF, 274-5. One can find a summary of this passage in one of al Kindi's sayings; see Atiyeh, Al-Kindi, 218-19, 240 n. 5.</page><page sequence="12">340 TH?R?SE-ANNE DRUART even asserts that purification is the only way for the soul to reach nobility in this life and in the hereafter. Then, al-Kindi says once again, the soul's power is close to resembling God's power (RKF, 278). Al-Kindi finishes with an illustrative story attributed to Aristotle and some moral exhortations. The only good reason for sorrow is ne glect of the truly important thing, "to purify one's soul insofar as is possible."33 Clearly the text is not of the greatest sophistication: it does not argue for its positions, relies on authorities, employs a story, and ends with an exhortation to moral purification and the intellectual life. Many of the terms used for God are Koranic and all are positive attri butes describing God's actions. Strikingly the exhortation to take care of one's soul derives all human excellences not from human ef forts (except from purification) but from God's gift and mercy. The various philosophers who are quoted are united in inciting the reader to suppress anger and sensual desires in order to purify his soul and pursue the intellectual life, particularly the consideration of meta physical themes. This may well be an instance of prephilosophical ethics. In more technical texts al-Kindi reflects on the terms applied to God in order to highlight God's transcendence. Terms applied to both God and his creation are not used in any of the usual ways. They are neither synonymous nor homonymous; therefore, they are not purely equivocal or even equivocal in relation to a prime analogate as all medical things are related to medicine.34 What are left are terms that are either purely negative or purely positive, such as "Oneness" and "Agent," which apply essentially and primarily to God?the universal cause?and are applied metaphorically and accidentally to his crea tion. Al-Kindi's The Agent in the Proper Sense35 argues that God alone is truly an agent, since He alone produces existence out of nothing. Strictly speaking the term agent (fail) should be restricted to God. Any other kind of action (fi'l) coming after the first is an "influence" 33 RKF, 379.

The true Agent can also be said to influence, but He alone does it without being influenced in any way. The work called On First Philosophy focuses on oneness36 and argues that only the first cause is truly and essentially one, since all other forms of oneness are derivative, mixed with multiplicity, and accidental. From this it follows that the first cause has no genus whatsoever and is neither in time nor in motion, since both time and motion involve multiplicity. Additionally, since the first cause and its creation are not in the same genus, and similarity or likeness occurs only in the same genus, the first cause has no similarity or likeness to its creation.37 This picks up the stern affirmation in God's Oneness that God does not resemble his creation because he is "far beyond the attributes given to him by the unbelievers."38 By the unbelievers al Kindi seems to mean people who take the anthropomorphic Koranic attributes literally. On First Philosophy ends on the same note and adds that metaphorical oneness derives from the generosity of the One.39 It seems logical to conclude that all of God's positive attributes pertain primarily and essentially to God and are applied only meta phorically and accidentally to his creation, because whatever pertains to creatures is purely derivative from God's power and so necessarily imperfect. Certainly al-Kindi believes that some terms such as "similar" apply to two things by a relation of "annexation," that is, that they are ex trinsically related ?id?fah).40 Such relation implies (1) that the two things are in the same genus; (2) that the relation is accidental (similar and dissimilar belong to the category of quality41); and (3) that, therefore, the "producer" or "influencer" qua "producer" and the thing which is "affected" qua "affected" in that particular manner are 36 RKF, 143; Al-Kindi's Metaphysics, 95-6.

Strictly speaking, of course, such relational terms can not be applied to God. What applies to God is a relation of cause to effect in which the cause in essence precedes and completely causes the effect.42 In this case the cause is more elevated and more noble than its effect, and is in no way associated to it. Imitation of God's actions therefore derives from God's generosity, and remains a mere imitation that never leads to true likeness to God because such like ness is strictly impossible. Al-Kindi's affirmation of God's oneness and, therefore, his rejec tion of motion and multiplicity in God have an interesting corollary: God is neither soul nor intellect. God is not intellect because to be an intellect would involve a multiplicity of cognitions.43 He is not soul either not only because of the multiplicity of cognitions in the intel lective soul but also because of the presence of motion in the soul. The soul thinks some forms and then moves to others. It is also sub ject to various character traits or dispositions ?akhl?q) and pains ??ldm) which accompany it, such as anger, fear, joy, sorrow (huzn), and the like.44 This makes it clear that if we want to imitate God's actions we must suppress not only our sensual desires and anger but also various emotions or passions, because emotions and passions involve motion. We can therefore now see why imitation of God re quires the suppressing of passion, and in particular the dispelling of sorrows. The Celestial Bodies' Imitation of God. A closer look at al Kindi's views on the celestial spheres or bodies in the Explanation on the Prostration of the Outermost Sphere and its Obedience to God45 (a commentary on Koran 55:5-6, "the stars and trees prostrate them selves") reveals some of their interesting features. The celestial bod ies are rational beings also but are more perfect than we?at least as long as we have not yet reached the hereafter?since they, qua causes of our bodies, are our proximate efficient causes. An examination of their perfection sheds further light on human excellence. Al-Kindi interprets the outermost sphere's prostration before God not as a physical prostration similar to the ritual prostration of 42 RKF, 142; Al-Kindi's Metaphysics, 94. 43 RKF, 154-5; Al-Kindi's Metaphysics, 106-7. 44 RKF, 154; Al-Kindi's Metaphysics, 105-6. 45 The text begins with an examination of the outermost sphere but later on shifts to views on the celestial bodies. Al-Kindi's unheralded switch from singular to plural justifies ours.</page><page sequence="15">AL-KINDI'S ETHICS 343 the canonical Islamic prayer but as an obedience. As obedience im plies choice, the celestial spheres must be both animate and rational (RKF, 246-7). At first using a fairly Aristotelian division of the soul, al-Kindi argues that since the spheres have incorruptible bodies? they have no contrary?they can neither grow nor decrease and do not need nutrition. In other words, they do not have a vegetative soul. They also necessarily lack any of the senses essentially related to nutrition, namely, taste, smell, and touch (RKF, 253). They must have senses, however, since they are animate. They therefore have only the two noble senses of hearing and sight,46 which "lead to true sciences and the acquisition of excellences." Thanks to these two senses one reaches "the complete science of philosophy which grants all excellence" (RKF, 254). There is a clear assumption that celestial spheres philosophize, since philosophy?including metaphysics?is the way to all excellence. The message is not difficult to decipher: "Follow the celestial spheres' good example and become a philo sopher." Then, switching without further ado to the Platonic tripartition of the soul, al-Kindi goes on to state that the celestial spheres do not have an irascible or concupiscible faculty.47 Their degree of perfection grants them by nature what we have to strive so hard to attain in this life. They are never burdened by the irascible and concupiscible soul and its passions, while we have to learn how to dominate the two lower faculties of our soul in order to extirpate the passions. We even have to wait for death to bring the ultimate liberation. What exactly does al-Kindi mean when he says that the celestial sphere is a proximate efficient cause?48 Al-Kindi first explains that it is the cause of anything subject to generation and corruption and of life in particular (RKF, 248). His argumentation rests essentially on physics and a conception of the soul as the principle of life. Then, 46 In Islam the common list of God's essential attributes includes hearing and seeing, and therefore sight and hearing are aspects of the imitation of God. Of course some theologians, to avoid any form of anthropomorphism, identify God's sight and hearing with his knowledge, but others think they are senses. 47 RKF, 255. Al-Kindi does not seem to be aware of any incompatibility between Aristotle's and Plato's divisions of the soul. 48 Al-Kindi had already dealt with some aspects of this issue m On the Proximate Efficient Cause of Generation and Corruption, which is later than On First Philosophy (RKF, 215, 219) but earlier than On the Prostration, which refers to it (RKF, 255).</page><page sequence="16">344 TH?R?SE-ANNE DRUART referring to On First Philosophy, al-Kindi defends the same view by means of a metaphysical argument (RKF, 251). Later, having introduced God's creation and design, al-Kindi states that true causation consists in bringing from potency to act all that is not impossible.49 The implication is clear. Just as God brings about actuality out of pure nothingness, so the celestial spheres in their own derivative way move as many preexisting potencies as possible to ac tuality. This is the manner of their imitation of God's own generosity to and governance of other beings while the celestial spheres strive to reach their own excellence through philosophical sciences. Only a metaphysics of act and potency and creation out of nothing allows one to understand what is involved in the imitation or emulation of God's generosity as far as possible for the celestial bodies and human beings. The Discourse on the Soul had already stated that imitation of God requires the human being to imitate His generosity, but had left rather unspecified what exactly this emulation could entail. The Discourse did not provide the metaphysical apparatus necessary to understand God's generosity. Ill Human Freedom, Astrology, and the Humoral Mix. Al-Kindi clearly believes in at least some degree of freedom of the will, although he neither explicitly addresses the issue nor has a specific term for free will. He seems to undermine his own conviction, however, in highlighting astral influences and astrological computations and in ac cepting the dictum that "the acts of the soul follow the mix of bodily humors" (RKF, 224-6). Therefore, we need to look more carefully at these issues. (1) The Affirmation of Human Freedom. Al-Kindi often speaks of human choice and will. He even claims, as we saw, that the celes tial bodies' obedience requires them to have choice. Choice, however, does not by itself necessarily entail that choice be free and that the 49 RKF, 259. That is, true causation consists in bringing from potency to act everything that is in fact possible. This is similar to al-Ghazali's po sition. On this matter see Richard M. Frank, Creation and the Cosmic Sys tem: Al-Ghazali and Avicenna (Heidelberg: Carl Winter-Universit?tsverlag, 1992), 52-77.</page><page sequence="17">AL-KINDI'S ETHICS 345 will not be subjected to some forces that would predetermine the choice. The Art of Dispelling Sorrows provides us with a clear statement that, at least in some circumstances, the human being is free to act or not to act. This very freedom grounds the attempt to rationally dispel some sorrows based on the fact that some of them arise from our own action and we ought not to do what saddens us. If we do what saddens us, though refraining from it is up to us [ ?layn?], for our doing it or refraining from it is up to us [?layn?], then we are doing either what we will or what we do not will. If we are doing what we will but in fact do not will to be saddened, then we end up willing what we do not will. Such conduct is typical of irrational people.50 In fact this ability to pursue or to refrain from a certain course of action gives us a handle on sorrow, since sorrow is by convention and not by nature (ADS, 35). As Simone Van Riet puts it, "Sadness is not inescapable. One chooses it. It is voluntary."51 One may regret that al-Kindi does not explore the theme of human freedom further. Are all our actions and our refraining from them up to us? Are they com pletely up to us? and at all times? What exactly does it mean to say that they are up to us? Such questions are not answered or even raised. (2) Human Freedom and Astrology. Although al-Kindi does not hesitate to use astrological computations to predict the date of the end of Arab domination,52 in a lesser known treatise he presents astrolog ical computations as essentially means for making rational choices. In The Determination by Astrological Means of the Moment at which to Expect an Answer to One's Request and Supplication to God,63 al Kindi first explains that although the stars may determine what is be low them?that is, the sublunary world?since they are the proximate 50 Ritter and Walzer, "Scritto morale," 35. The Arabic expression ilayn? is a literal translation of the Stoic eph3 h?min (?&lt;f)s r)\xiv), "in our power." See, for example, Epictetus, Discourses 1.1.7-9, in The Hellenistic Philoso phers, ed. and trans, by A. A. Long and D. N. Sedley, 2 vols. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987). The Greek text is in vol. 2, p. 388; the English translation and comments is in vol. 1, pp. 391-4. 51 Simone Van Riet, "Joie et bonheur dans le trait? d'al-Kindi sur l'art de combattre la tristesse," Revue philosophique de Louvain 61 (1963): 15. 52 Atiyeh, Al-Kindi, 190. For Atiyeh's discussion of al-Kindi's views on astrology and what Atiyeh takes to be Al-Kindi's determinism see pp. 79-82. 53 The Determination by Astrological Means of the Moment at which to Expect an Answer to One's Request and Supplication to God (hereafter,</page><page sequence="18">346 TH?R?SE-ANNE DRUART causes of generation and corruption, they certainly do not in any way determine what is above them?that is, God, who is their own cause. Astral conjunctions, therefore, are simply signs of God's actions for those who know how to read them, since stars are intermediaries be tween God and us (DAM, 65-6). As stars are caused by God, they manifest something of their creator's will. Such signs allow us to select the propitious time to ask for something (DAM, 65). As foolish people would apply such knowledge for requesting and obtaining things harmful?such as riches or dainty food?instead of useful things, al-Kindi wants to restrict this lore to the learned and wise. Presumably the philosophically inclined would employ it to ask only for useful things, such as mathematical knowledge and understanding of metaphysics. To prevent the misuse and abuse of astral compu tations knowledge gained in this way should be hidden under symbols (DAM, 68). Al-Kindi's views on the extent of the astrological influence remain unclear, as do his views on the extent of the limitations it may put on human freedom. Astrological computations, however, allow us to time intelligently and therefore to choose rationally the moment at which to make a specific petition. (3) Human Freedom and the Humoral Mix. As we saw earlier, al-Kindi accepts the dictum that the soul's actions follow the mix of bodily humors, which itself is determined by astral influences. This dictum may be true of actions arising from innate character traits and inclinations, but it does not follow from this that such traits or incli nations cannot be suppressed, or at least curbed or modified, by ac quiring proper habits. A natural inclination to sorrow?the objects of which are conventional and not natural?can, therefore, be con trolled by proper habits.54 This allows al-Kindi to speak of choosing character traits. Proper moral training may bring some change in the natural inclinations, or more exactly, to their focus. If those naturally inclined to sorrow discover that objects of sorrows are in fact few and UDAM", edited with an Introduction by Muhsin Mahdi in his "Unedited Texts of al-Kindi and al-Farabi," (in Arabic), in Nusus falsafiyyat given to Ibrahim Madkour and edited by Uthman Amin (Cairo: Egyptian Association of the Book, 1976), 53-68. The text edition runs from p. 65 to p. 68. The same treatise had previously been edited by M?bahat T?rker K?yel in Ara?tirma 10 (1972): 9-14. We will refer to Mahdi's edition. 54 The Discourse on the Soul speaks of those whose nature it is to cry for things causing sorrow (RKF, 279) but The Art of Dispelling Sorrows shows how such a disposition can be altered by acquiring proper habits (ADS, 33 4). See also Van Riet, "Joie et bonheur," 16.</page><page sequence="19">AL-KINDI'S ETHICS 347 far between they will, it is hoped, sorrow much less. Opinion about what is really worth sorrowing about may be changed. In addition, medicine too may help in modifying the humoral mix thanks to better habits.55 This may enhance human freedom. Clearly al-Kindi's views on astrology and the influence of the hu moral mix are not as detrimental to human freedom as one might think, although we have no hint that al-Kindi himself was bothered about their compatibility. Moving from theory to practice, let us examine how al-Kindi deals with the malady of sorrowing. IV The Art of Dispelling Sorrows.56 Too often The Art of Dispelling Sorrows is deemed not worth philosophical examination. Abu Ridah takes this view so far that he does not bother editing it.57 Walzer and Van Riet dub it "popular" philosophy.58 More recently Butterworth, taking it more seriously, analyzes it at some length but at the end confesses disappointment. For him, this work "provides strategies for coping, personal coping, and accepts the milieu in which we live as a fixed variable?that is, something not worth trying to alter. We learn to put up with it, even to come to terms with it in such a way 55 See Felix Klein-Franke, "The Arabic Version of Galen's 'Peri Eth?n' (irep? hOC?v)," Jerusalem Studies in Arabic and Islam 1 (1979): 125-50. About the role of humors in a mental disease see, for instance, Hans Hinrich Biesterfeldt and Dimitri Gutas's article, "The Malady of Love," which presents a pathology of love that associates it with an excess of black bile and explains why this malady is medically incurable; Hans Hinrich Biesterfeldt and Dimitri Gutas, "The Malady of Love," Journal of the American Oriental Society 104 (1984): 21-55. Where medicine fails philosophy takes over, and al-Razi dedi cates the fifth chapter of his Spiritual Medicine to the treatment of this dis ease. Al-Kindi too had some interest in this issue, since he wrote the Agree ment of the Philosophers about the Allegories of Love, which must have contained a paraphrase of Plato's Symposium; see Dimitri Gutas, "Plato's Symposium in the Arabic Tradition," Oriens 31 (1988): 37-47. 56 In addition to the Ritter and Walzer edition to which we are referring, there is an edition by Abdurrahman Badawi in his Trait?s philosophiques par al-Kindi, al-Farabi, Ibn Bajjah et Ibn ?dyy, 3d ed. (Beirut: Dar Al-Andaloss, 1983), 6-32. Badawi provides also a close French paraphrase of this text in his Histoire de la Philosophie en Islam, 2:456-69. 57 For Abu Ridah's justification see RKF, viii, where he states that this text is not philosophical. 58 Ritter and Walzer, "Scritto morale," 7, 13; Van Riet, "Joie et bonheur," 13, 23.</page><page sequence="20">348 TH?R?SE-ANNE DRUART that we improve our own life." According to Butterworth, however, The Art of Dispelling Sorrows does not deal with any serious philo sophical issue?such as the nature of happiness?and does not even question its own hidden assumptions.59 Rafael Ram?n Guerrero and Emilio Tornero Poveda's translation under the title "The Art of Consolation," relates this work to Epicte tus's Manual and to Neoplatonic texts.60 The notion of philosophy as consolation evokes Boethius's famous Consolation of Philosophy, which far more than al-Kindi's own had an enormous literary, artistic, and philosophical influence.61 Al-Kindi is more indebted to a Helle nistic and late Roman tradition of "therapeutic arguments" than is Bo ethius. According to Martha Nussbaum this tradition covered the spectrum from Aristotelians to Stoics and Epicureans. This kind of tradition, which conceives of philosophy as something that must nec essarily affect the manner of our living in all its aspects, links the therapeutic arguments needed to heal the soul from its diseases to literary artistry.62 No one would deny that Boethius's masterpiece is 59 Butterworth, "Al-Kindi," 32-52; see p. 52 in particular. 60 Obras filos?ficas de Al-Kind?, 156-71. There is an Introduction on pp. 154-5. Badawi calls it a "consolation par la philosophie"; Badawi, His toire de la philosophie en Islam, 2:456. For the Greek sources see Ritter and Walzer, "Scritto Morale," 9-30; although Walzer's view that it is clearly modeled after a lost treatise of Themistius should not be accepted. See also Jadaane, L'influence du Sto?cisme, 88-90,195-214; and Badawi's discussion in his Histoire de la philosophie en Islam, 2:456-7, 469-73. 61 On the great influence of The Art of Dispelling Sorrows see Ritter and Walzer, "Scritto Morale," 7-9; and Badawi, Histoire de la Philosophie en Islam, 2:473-7. Miskawayh quotes from The Art of Dispelling Sorrows at length in his Refinement of Character. The Arabic edition of this work is Tahdh?b al-Akhl?q, ed. Constantine K. Zurayk (Beirut: American University of Beirut, 1966), 219-21. There is also an English translation: The Refinement of Character, trans. Constantine K. Zurayk (Beirut: American University of Beirut, 1968), 194-6. There are some similarities between The Consolation of Philosophy and The Art of Dispelling Sorrows, which show their depen dence on the same tradition of late antiquity. For instance, Lady Philosophy acts as a physician to cure Boethius's soul and first applies an easy or light remedy (as does al-Kindi), and both texts argue that what was thought to be misfortune is in fact good fortune. 62 "This idea of philosophy as a compassionate art through which con fused and suffering people may be brought from their current misery to a greater measure of flourishing?this is a deeply rooted idea in the irayor traditions of Hellenistic ethical thought, both Greek and Roman. Frequently it is expressed through an analogy between philosophy and the art of medi cine: as medicine is to the body, so philosophy is to the soul"; Martha C. Nussbaum, Introduction to The Poetics of Therapy: Hellenistic Ethics in its</page><page sequence="21">AL-KINDI'S ETHICS 349 a prime example of one of those rare happy marriages between artistry and philosophy. Anyone who has taught this work knows how it still captivates and charms contemporary undergraduates. As for al-Kindi's Art of Dispelling Sorrows, it too exhibits literary and artistic ambitions sadly absent from the rest of his work.63 Nussbaum's paper, "The Stoics on the Extirpation of the Pas sions," M is most helpful for locating al-Kindi's own therapy. She as serts that "in order to see the power of the Stoic conception of therapy we need to focus on their account of the emotions or passions. . . . We shall go on to investigate the notorious thesis of Chrysippus that the passions are forms of false belief or judgment. This thesis has, as I think we shall see, considerably more philosophical and intuitive power than might at first be evident."65 If, indeed, passions and emotions are tied to false beliefs we can understand why a phi losopher such as al-Kindi, who values truth so highly, would like to eradicate them. (1) Introduction (p. 31).m The Art of Dispelling Sorrows makes its own the common literary device of presenting philosophy, be it at its most sophisticated or popular, in the form of a letter an swering a personal request of a friend. This of course allows for the reader's easy identification with the friend. Presumably someone who asks for a tract to help him in dispelling sorrows must be afflicted in some way, but the text does not offer further clues. Al-Kindi's answer will thus fit anyone suffering from sadness. In a captatio benevolen tiae al-Kindi states at the outset that noble souls, such as his friend's, do not want to become prey to vice and try to avoid its pain and tyranny. The implications are clear: sorrow is a vice and painful dis ease for which we should seek a remedy. As only knowledge of the cause of a pain can lead to its cure, al Kindi without further ado gives an essential definition of sorrow: "It is Rhetorical and Literary Context, ed. Martha C. Nussbaum, Apeiron 23, no. 4 (1990): 1-6. 63 See Obras filos?ficas de Al-Kind?, 154; Jadaane, L'Influence du Sto? cisme, 209-10. 64 Martha C. Nussbaum, "The Stoics on the Extirpation of the Passions," Apeiron 20 (1987): 129-77. Nussbaum shows how some of the relevant Stoic views were known to Galen. Galen's influence on Arabic philosophy? which is much more important than usually stated?explains how they reached al-Kindi, even if he was unaware of their true origin. 65 Ibid, 130-1. 66 Page references in these headings are to ADS'.</page><page sequence="22">350 THERESE-ANNE DRUART a pain of the soul occurring from the loss of things loved or from having things sought for elude us."67 No justification is provided: this is a view commonly held. Nearly the whole treatise follows from this presupposition, although at the end al-Kindi will claim that the defi nition leads to inconsistency and so hint that it is false. The treatise uses various literary devices to make its points. Although al-Kindi, to my knowledge, never states that emotions or passions are false beliefs or inherently connected to them, he nevertheless spends his time gen tly correcting and even refuting the common beliefs about the causes of sorrow. The arguments, of which there are many,68 do not rest in any way on revelation and often not even on defined philosophical positions. On the surface they are fairly ordinary common-sense arguments made palatable by tales, illustrations, and even a long allegory. The work is pleasant if somewhat pedestrian. I believe, however, that it is de signed to make careful and thoughtful readers question their com monly accepted false beliefs which are at the root of their complaint and to incite them to seek what is really necessary, that is, to engage in the pursuit of philosophy. Only philosophy provides secure foun dations for the assumptions of the therapeutic arguments the curative power of which the readers will have experienced. The slow pace, repetitions, apparent digressions, stories, and so on, have no other purpose than to upset the readers' familiar beliefs and give them time to assimilate fully the consequences of the refutation of their old be liefs and of the acceptance of more philosophical ones. (2) Causes of sorrow are such by convention and not by nature (pp. 31 -35). From the very beginning of this work, its readers must confront the implications of a truth they do not fully acknowledge. Our world is a world of generation and corruption, and this fact nec essarily leads to sorrow if the possessions we love and the things we seek are corruptible and sensible objects. By definition such objects are not only elusive and transitory but also such that others can snatch them away from us. To avoid sorrow, therefore, we should rather love and seek things of the intellect, since these things alone are stable and eternal. Besides, no one can despoil us of them. True under standing of nature, of physics, would bring home to us that the love 67 Butterworth, "Al-Kindi." 40. (Butterworth's translation of The Art of Dispelling Sorrows, with modifications.) 68 That is, in contradistinction to the other "ethical" treatise, The Dis course on the Soul.</page><page sequence="23">AL-KINDI'S ETHICS 351 and pursuit of sensible and corruptible objects is self-defeating. As we are not yet able to give up our attachment to the sensible world al Kindi, leaving aside the claims of the world of intellect, invites us sim ply to imitate illustrious kings, who do not cry over the past or rush for what may or may not come but rather pay full attention to the present. Somehow the field of things that cause sorrow has been narrowed down to current things or events, and the self-esteem of the readers is boosted by telling them that their past attitude is common and that they can imitate the glorious behavior of illustrious kings. Sorrow is not grounded in its object?the nature of which, in fact, is not under our control?but rather in our own attitude towards the object. Why? Because what brings sorrow does not do so by nature but simply by convention?by the way we choose to look at it. Hu man experience shows that such is the case, since different people value different things and assume that what they value is the only thing worth valuing. The hedonist, who takes his pleasure in drink, food, sex, and elegant clothes, thinks everybody else is a sad case. The gambler, though wasting time and money, thinks that everybody else is missing his life. Even the highway robber?who risks amputation and crucifixion?assumes that everyone else is a loser. Most pathetic of all, the effeminate69 and cross dresser?for whom everyone feels aversion?assumes everyone else lets life pass him by. Notice how al-Kindi suggests that at least the practitioners of the last three types of conduct are victims of false belief. Now he can draw the conclu sion: what people value is not valuable by nature but rather by habit and familiarity. Therefore, he says, let us change our own attitude to things and no longer accuse the sensible objects of being the cause of our sorrows. Al-Kindi kindly provides two incentives for doing so. First, as the soul?presumably only the intellective soul?is incorruptible, it is much more important than the body, which is merely its instrument. Second, spiritual medicine is less painful and much less expensive than bodily medicine. All that it requires is a "determination,"70 which, 69 The context indicates that for al-Kindi the effeminate is also a cross dresser. About the effeminate (mukhannath) see Everett K. Rowson, "The Effeminates of Early Medina," Journal of the American Oriental Society 111 (1991): 671-93. According to al-Razi even spiritual medicine cannot cure the "effeminate" of the malady of love; Rasa il Falsafiyyah, ed. P. Kraus (Cairo: Imprimerie Paul Barbey, 1939), 45. 70 That is, eazm; see note 8 above.</page><page sequence="24">352 TH?R?SE-ANNE DRUART starting from small matters, will gradually take up greater ones. Again, wary that the reader may be frightened by the immortality of the soul?a weighty philosophical issue dealt with at the end of phys ics and in connection with metaphysics?al-Kindi focuses on the im mediate emotional appeal of the ease and inexpensiveness of the spir itual medicine. (3) The easy remedies (pp. 35-39). Classifying the kinds of sorrows allows the reader to see that many of them can be prevented. Some arise from our own actions. Since we can refrain from these actions, as we saw earlier, we can dispel these sorrows by not per forming such actions. Other kinds of sorrow arise from other agen cies; not all of these, however, are unavoidable, for we can prevent some of them from occurring. Thus only unavoidable sorrows are left, but we should not worry about them beforehand because they may not even happen. Anxiety about their possible occurrence is simply a useless, self-inflicted torment. Assuming that harming one's body is irrational, al-Kindi goes on to conclude that harming one's soul is the peak of ignorance and injustice. Instead of worrying about evils which may not even occur, he says, let us rather deal with actual in evitable sorrows. The originally enormous burden of all past and pos sible sorrows has now become much smaller and lighter, thanks to a change in our own attitude. Al-Kindi then works on decreasing the remaining time during which the burden must be borne. Various simple psychological de vices are given. Experience tells us that previous sorrows abated, and so will current griefs. Misery loves company and particularly glamorous company. Al-Kindi therefore tells the story of Alexander, a very educational philosopher king, who from his deathbed provides his mother with consolation. She must build a city and then give a great feast there to celebrate her son's death. Many people are to be invited, on the condition they have no sorrow whatsoever. So she does, but no one comes to the banquet. As she expresses her surprise a courtier kindly points out the obvious. Nobody came because no one is fully exempt from sorrow. Notice that the wise Alexander knows that it will take some time for his august mother to get the message. A fortiori al-Kindi should give time to the naive reader. As sorrow is by convention and not by nature,71 it is a senseless self inflicted torment and therefore irrational. It thus places its victim at 71 ADS, 37. Notice the repetition of this same point made earlier.</page><page sequence="25">AL-KINDI'S ETHICS 353 the level of the brutes. Drily al-Kindi adds that brutes?being so by nature?behave with constancy and order, whereas irrational human beings?who follow their whims?do not even have method to their madness. Giving some more instances of the irrationality of common be havior, al-Kindi shows that to wish to avoid all misfortune is to wish for the impossible, and that wishing to keep as one's own what is in fact common property?that is, sensible and corruptible things which can be snatched away from us?is also self-defeating. Then, leaving aside these tantalizing philosophical arguments, he turns once again to the emotional appeal and argues that the wish to keep common property as one's own is a form of envy, the most shameful vice.72 Finally, al-Kindi explains why he thinks all sensible things are common property. Echoing a passage of the Phaedo dear to the Sto ics?in which Socrates argues that suicide is immoral because, being properties of the gods, we need their permission to leave this life73? al-Kindi claims that external things are common because they belong to God who created them and lends them to us. We should, therefore, understand that God can take external things away whenever and by whatever means he wishes, even at the hands of our own enemy. We should also be most grateful that God never reclaims what is essential, that is, our own soul. Although the immortality of the soul and God's creation ground the argument, al-Kindi once again chooses to focus on the emotional appeal of the ugliness of ingratitude. (4) The difficult remedies (pp. 39-end). The time has now come to show that the original definition of sorrow is self-contradictory if the objects of acquisition and desire are sensible and corruptible. Al Kindi has a real passion for using and even abusing the principle of noncontradiction. If the cause of sorrow is the loss of such external possessions or our not obtaining them, then to avoid sorrow we should eschew the acquisition of external possessions. Since failing to ac quire them is the other cause of sorrow, however, it follows that whether or not we come to acquire external possessions we shall in evitably be plunged into sorrow. 72 Let us remember that for al-Kindi envy leads even some learned people to give up the pursuit of truth (see note 9 above). Al-Razi dedicates the seventh chapter of his Spiritual Medicine to envy. 73 Phaedo 61c-62e. On the curious influence of this text on the Stoics see John M. Rist, "Suicide," in John M. Rist, Stoic Philosophy (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1969), 233-55.</page><page sequence="26">354 TH?R?SE-ANNE DRUART The solution to this conundrum is simple: let us not even desire external possessions. We are moving from treatment to prevention. Having now abandoned the implied conception that joy is the acqui sition and retention of external things, we are also ready to abandon kings as role models and to move to emulate philosophers, who es chew external things. To someone who notices that he has never been sad Socrates replies that such is the case because he possesses nothing. In contrast Nero, "king" of the Romans, is duly warned by an anonymous philosopher not to get attached to a fragile crystal can opy given to him but is foolish enough to take it with him on a ship. A shipwreck conveniently destroys the canopy but spares Nero's life, so that he can survive to grieve about the loss of his canopy. Adding another allegedly Socratic saying for good measure, al-Kindi highlights the practical superiority of the philosopher who, in contrast, would not even grieve about the loss of his only shelter, a tub. Indeed, al-Kindi asks, Why should we worry about externals? since the Creator, presumably because of his generosity, provides every creature with what it needs. Only human beings burden them selves with useless worries about external things?worries which not only plague their earthly life but even endanger their eternal destiny. Building a near mosque on the few lines of section 7 of Epictetus' Manual, al-Kindi compares in great detail human life to a sea voyage towards the homeland. At a necessary stop for restocking, the closer people remain to the ship and the less they pay attention to the beau ties of the scenery, the sooner they return aboard to find a first class choice seat with plenty of leg room for the rest of the journey?seats apparently are assigned on a first come, first serve basis. People who return unburdened with souvenirs but, distracted by the sights, have lingered somewhat behind get only business class seats. As for those who have wasted time collecting ungainly souvenirs, they go in tourist class and struggle to put their newly acquired possessions under nar row seats and over their heads. The later they join, the more cramped their space and the more voluminous their possessions. After a time some of their possessions will spoil, causing their owner further em barrassment and discomfort. Some people will even die on the way, smothered by their possessions. Others, fully engrossed in their hunt for souvenirs, will not notice the captain's last call and will be left on land to die horrible deaths. Al-Kindi refrains from spoiling the charm of his allegory by ex plaining it in detail. Butterworth therefore rightly points out that little</page><page sequence="27">AL-KINDI'S ETHICS 355 is said about the final destination of the journey except that it is the world of truth.74 Thoughtful readers, however, wondering and pon dering, will pay attention to the faint but unmistakable call to serious philosophical studies. There a close examination of nature, the soul, and God?that is, issues of physics, psychology, and metaphysics ex plored by al-Kindi in other works?will provide serious answers to their questions. Having been led to abandon the common but false belief that ex ternal things lead to happiness, and having been given a glimpse of tantalizing metaphysical truths, al-Kindi's readers, desiring once and for all to escape self-inflicted sorrows, will focus on the imperishable and inalienable realities of the world of the intellect that al-Kindi has spoken of at the very beginning. We have come back, full circle. The only thing really worth sorrowing about is our allowing ourselves to be deflected from reaching our homeland, where things are eternal and immutable, where everything is real, and where one does not de sire what should not be desired. Finally, al-Kindi's readers can face up to the greatest counterin tuitive argument about what causes sorrow. Even death, assumed to be the greatest evil, is no evil at all. It is inherent in the human con dition.75 An immortal human being would be a self-contradictory thing. Our considering death an evil is rooted in ignorance, for death opens for us the world of the stable objects we crave. If death is no evil then, a fortiori, simple loss of or inability to gain sensible things will be no evil either. What is evil is fear of these supposed evils, that is, our own attitude toward them. The ultimate step in the shedding of false beliefs has come. What readers had assumed to be misfortunes turn out to be good fortune or grace, since they remove false causes of sorrow. Only the one who possesses no external things is really master of the things that enslave kings, namely, anger and sensual desires, which are causes of vices and pains. True freemen are not?as common people falsely be lieve?kings, for kings are slaves to their own lower soul. Rather, true freemen are people who are fully rational and give true weight to intellectual objects. The implication is clear: these are the philoso phers. The text ends by asking God to place the reader among those 74 Butterworth, "Al-Kindi," 48-9. 75 In On the Definitions too al-Kindi defines the human being as animal, rational and mortal; RKF, 179.</page><page sequence="28">356 TH?R?SE-ANNE DRUART who ery oy the fruit of the intellect and shim ignorance. There is per fect rest. Even God gives his blessing to philosophers! The audience of The Art of Dispelling Sorrows. Although al-Kindi often uses arguments based on common views and emotional appeal, he nevertheless refers to metaphysical positions he holds. The stock and trade Stoic arguments open up for the reader the realm of serious argumentation, but they need to be supplemented by Neoplatonic metaphysics. Boethius's Consolation of Philosophy presents a trained philos opher suddenly confronted with misfortunes so great that he forgets himself; that is, he forgets that he is a philosopher. Lady Philosophy gradually cures him of his illness and returns him to himself. She can then proceed without further ado to metaphysical intricacies, although it is first necessary for her to spend half her time on therapeutic ar guments and to sustain Boethius's efforts with doses of poetry which become less and less frequent as the work progresses. Al-Kindi, on the other hand, is addressing a beginner. He sees his therapeutic arguments as a necessary precondition to the study of philosophy and as arguments which therefore can only adumbrate the philosophical truths which should replace the common false beliefs of which the reader needs to be cured. There is the patience and emo tional appeal needed to coax a reader easily distracted by the imme diate need to cope with some undetermined sorrows. When finally the reader admits that what looks like misfortune is in fact good for tune he can move to philosophy proper and its rigorous methods. The Art of Dispelling Sorrows is an instance of prephilosophical ethics leading to the liberation of the mind from passions and for philosophy. Many readers may remain at its surface level. So be it. Promising readers will not. They will register for philosophical studies. A last remark. As Van Riet has pointed out, the text often incites us to joy, another emotion.76 Are we not then confronted with an inconsistency in al-Kindi's views? Perhaps the quest for joy is part of the immediate emotional appeal and, in more sophisticated contexts, al-Kindi would explain that joy is only a temporary aim. Alternatively, the link between joy and rest?the contrary of motion?may indicate that there is a contentment of the mind which is not a passion because it is a stable condition. 76 Van Riet, "Joie et bonheur," 15-23.</page><page sequence="29">AL-KINDI'S ETHICS 357 V Conclusion. Let us now recapitulate some trends in al-Kindi's ethics while avoiding the temptation to harmonize details. True philo sophical ethics follows from psychology and metaphysics. The for mer provides knowledge of the immortality of the intellective soul, of the soul's simplicity, and that the body is a mere instrument. The latter establishes God's oneness and His true agency. God's oneness in turn excludes motion and therefore passion. The notion of ethics as the imitation of God follows nicely from this. The suppression of passion in this life for the sake of the development of the intellectual life and as a prelude to the soul's liberation and greater closeness to God in the hereafter is thus included in ethics. Philosophy is the core of human science, which is discursive by its nature. Revelation or "divine" science may grant to some, already in this life, a glimpse of the eternal participation in God's light and truth.77 As for prephilosophical ethics, The Discourse on the Soul shows that it too can accommodate the theme of imitation of God in its fo cusing on the philosophical implications of common religious beliefs. The Art of Dispelling Sorrows illustrates how therapeutic arguments may not only extirpate some specific painful passion but, in so doing, may incite the reader to the pursuit of philosophy.78 The Catholic University of America 77 On human versus divine science, see On the Number of Aristotle's Books; RKF, 372-6. 781 would like to thank Richard M. Frank for his most helpful remarks on an early version of this paper. This paper owes much to him but, needless to say, all its defects are my responsibility alone.</page></plain_text>
