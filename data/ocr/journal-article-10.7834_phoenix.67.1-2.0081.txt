<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> THE IRREDUCIBILITY OF MYTH: PLATO’S PHAEDRUS, APOLLO, ADMETUS, AND THE PROBLEM OF PEDERASTIC HIERARCHY T. K. Hubbard Ever since the publication of Sir Kenneth Dover’s influential Greek Ho- mosexuality in 1978, the study of Greek pederasty has been dominated by a hierarchical model of sexual protocols governing the behavior of the adult erastes and the adolescent eromenos. This model posits the former as invariably the one who pursues intimate relations with the latter, assumes the penetrative po- sition in sexual acts, and offers gifts and authoritative guidance which the latter respectfully and deferentially accepts. The eromenos is constructed as a passive character largely devoid of subjectivity, certainly feeling no sexual desire, and showing some initial resistance to the advances of the erastes not so much out of individual will as out of deference to the social protocols which tell him that he is expected to play “hard to get.” One well-known scholar, David Halperin, has articulated the active/passive dichotomy in particularly stark terms: Sex is not only polarizing, however; it is also hierarchical. For the insertive partner is construed as a sexual agent, whose phallic penetration of another person’s body expresses sexual “activity,” whereas the receptive partner is construed as a sexual patient, whose submission to phallic penetration expresses sexual “passivity.” Sexual “activity,” moreover, is thematized as domination: the relationship between the “active” and “passive” sexual partner is thought of as that obtaining between social superior and social inferior. “Active” and “passive” sexual roles are therefore necessarily isomorphic with superordinate and subordinate social status; hence, an adult, male citizen of Athens can have legitimate sexual relations only with statutory minors (his inferiors not in age but in social and political status): the proper targets of his sexual desire include, specifically, women, boys, foreigners, and slaves—all of them persons who do not enjoy the same legal and political rights and privileges that he does.1 Others have questioned this schema of sex as a one-dimensional power trans- action and argued that the reconstructed “sexual protocols” on which it relies are largely a fiction derived from overly literal and naive readings of a handful of ancient texts, particularly Pausanias’ speech in Plato’s Symposium.2 1Halperin 1990: 30. See also Dover 1978: 84–91, 100–109; Winkler 1990: 45–70. This view is frequently, but wrongly, attributed to Foucault, for whom the active/passive dichotomy is really more about being in control of one’s passions, rather than controlled by them. 2For arguments against this view, see Hubbard 1998; 2002: 283–290; 2003: 10–14; Davidson 2001 (at greater length in Davidson 2007: 101–166). See also Lengauer 2006: 67–75 for questioning of the active/passive dichotomy more broadly. The unreliability of Pausanias as a witness to social realities is a subject I will pursue elsewhere. 81 PHOENIX, VOL. 66 (2012) 3–4. </page> <page sequence="2"> 82 PHOENIX However, Plato’s Symposium itself presents a variety of constructions of erotic relations that are not all consistent with this model. Indeed, I would like to suggest that the speech immediately preceding Pausanias’, that of the often dismissed Phaedrus, has already constituted Plato’s aporetic deconstruction of the very conceptual architecture of erastes and eromenos, which Halperin and others have effectively essentialized for all of Greco-Roman civilization. What Phaedrus reveals, albeit unwittingly, is how the traditional body of wisdom preserved in myth resists the overly neat structuralist reductions through which sophistic thinkers of both his time and ours attempt to categorize them. In the second part of this essay, I shall proceed to demonstrate this principle by analyzing in greater depth the background to one of the stories upon which Phaedrus touches, that of Alcestis’ husband Admetus and the double-edged favor he receives from Apollo. i. phaedrus' aporetic speech in the SYMPOSIUM Phaedrus of Myrrhinus, the son of Pythocles, appears in three Platonic dia- logues as an enthusiastic young man fascinated by the subject of Love, particu- larly of the pederastic sort; such is also his character in the mid-fourth century comedy of Alexis (see especially the wonderful fr. 247 PCG).3 The Protagoras presents him and Eryximachus among those associated with the amazing poly- math Hippias of Elis, and Andocides (1.15, 1.35) names both friends among those prosecuted for parodying the Eleusinian Mysteries a year after the dra- matic date of the Symposium. Like the pompous Hippias, of whom Plato was no fan,4 Phaedrus presumes to encyclopaedic knowledge of the poets and their stories, but his analytic abilities do not match the vast scope of his ambitions. Platonic critics have been harsh in their verdicts on his short epideictic speech in the Symposium: J. B. Bury long ago condemned it as possessing a “moral standpoint . . . in no respect raised above the level of the average citizen,” “little regard to consistency,” and a method of argument that “with its want of logical coherence, savours much of the sophists.”5 When Plato conceived the idea of making Phaedrus a key character in his two principal dialogues on Love, Phaedrus had long ago vanished from the scene in Athens; like many of the sophistically inspired young intelligentsia of 3For the best prosopographical study, see Nails 2002: 232–234, who is, I think, too cautious with regard to Alexis’ comedy, which without question parodies Plato’s dialogues on Love. 4See Guthrie 1971: 280–285. 5Bury (1932: xxv–xxvi), who further complains of Phaedrus’ stylistic flaws, including monotony of expression and anacolouthon. Rosen (1987: 39–59) calls attention to Phaedrus’ selfishness, other- worldliness, and devotion to expediency and appearance. Hunter (2004: 38–42) notes his sloppiness in citing poetic authority and overuse of antithetical examples that merely lead to aporia. Penwill (1978: 144, 161) suggests that Phaedrus was constitutionally weak, dependent on Eryximachus for his medical supervision: his emphasis upon Love as a motivator of courage ironically reflects his own lack of it. </page> <page sequence="3"> THE PROBLEM OF PEDERASTIC HIERARCHY 83 Athens, he fled into exile to escape prosecution for the sacrileges of 415.6 As a rationalist who would make light of traditional beliefs and rituals, Phaedrus probably belonged to those like Prodicus (whom he and Eryximachus praise at 177b), who allegorized or critiqued traditional mythology, explaining religious institutions in anthropological terms.7 The god Eros certainly lends himself to Prodicean interpretation: it is arguably the point of Phaedrus’ own praise of Eros to illustrate that the force for which the god stands is “useful to mankind” (pr ̃w 1⁄2fel’an, 177b), motivating great acts of courage. Phaedrus’ love of speculating about myth is also foregrounded in the dialogue named after him, where he imagines (falsely) that he and Socrates are present at the spot where Boreas is said to have raped Oreithyia, only to be corrected by Socrates, dismissing the sophoi who attempt to trace the origin of myths in terms of ordinary human phenomena (Phaedrus 229b–e). Socrates’ digression on this topic may be meant to challenge the very kind of thinking about myth to which the historical Phaedrus was inclined.8 It should therefore not surprise us that the Symposium depicts him analyzing mythological examples to illustrate the powers of the preeminently allegorical Eros. As is often the case for the Greeks, traditional myths are good to think with. Indeed, these stories constituted a major part of the literary education of Greeks and were thus fundamental in both shaping and reflecting social attitudes about acceptable and unacceptable behaviors. However, what Phaedrus’ speech reveals is precisely the difficulty posed by mapping onto these traditional stories strictly separated categories of active and passive, erastes and eromenos. Anxious to prove that love motivates humans to the most honorable and courageous conduct, Phaedrus cites the case of Alcestis, whose love for her husband Admetus caused her to offer herself to Death in his place. But this example strikes us as a logical non sequitur to Phaedrus’ preceding discussion of pederasty, which insisted that lovers would never act shamefully in battle, because the eyes of their younger male companion would be upon them. Not only is Alcestis’ marriage to Admetus not pederastic, but she 6For the tendency of contemporaries to connect the sacrileges with a lack of respect for tradi- tional religion inspired by sophistic teachings, see Kagan 1981: 205–209; Ostwald 1986: 324–330. Debra Nails (2006) has pointed out that virtually all of the speakers in the Symposium except Aristo- phanes will eventually suffer the “tragedy” of separation from Athens, due in one way or another to the successive waves of anti-aristocratic/anti-intellectual religious backlash: Alcibiades, Phaedrus, and Eryximachus in 415, Agathon and Pausanias in 411 or soon thereafter, and finally Socrates in 399. See also Penwill 1978 and von Blanckenhagen 1992 for the necessity of reading the characters of the dialogue in their historical context. 7Phaedrus (177b) not only acknowledges familiarity with Prodicus, but even his less inspired imitators who would write treatises on the usefulness of salt, echoing Prodicus’ conviction that men deified natural objects or forces useful to them; see Guthrie 1971: 238–242 for a careful evaluation of the sources of Prodicus’ anthropology of religion. Cole (1990: 153–163) sees such beliefs, including those of Democritus on human progress, as the background to later euhemerist analysis. 8For an interesting discussion of this episode and its significance, see Ferrari 1987: 9–12. </page> <page sequence="4"> 84 PHOENIX is a woman and therefore the younger, “passive” partner in the union according to the conventional protocols posited by Halperin’s equation of boys, women, foreigners, and slaves;9 the “active” husband Admetus, who passively allows his wife to die for him rather than courageously rescuing her from that fate by dying himself, fails to assert the manly self-sacrifice Phaedrus’ discourse on military heroism would demand of a true erastes. Phaedrus compounds the incongruity by adducing Orpheus as a contrastive example to Alcestis: although tradition holds Orpheus to be a heroic lover who descended to Hades in an effort to rescue his wife from the dead, Phaedrus minimizes his undertaking by characterizing him as a cowardly musician who was unwilling to die, and was so lacking in masculinity as to be ultimately killed by Thracian Maenads.10 Could this charge not more reasonably be made against Admetus in his previous example? Phaedrus falls into even greater incoherence in addressing the story of Achilles and Patroclus, which seems to have first been given an erotic inflection by Aeschylus’ Myrmidons.11 Whereas Aeschylus had characterized Achilles as the erastes of Patroclus (as also assumed by Pindar in Olympian 10.16–19),12 Phae- drus insists that it must have been the other way around, since Achilles was more beautiful and, according to Iliad 11.787, younger. However, Phaedrus ex- aggerates the age difference by claiming Achilles was “much younger,” and there is no evidence that Patroclus ever assumed the stereotypically pederastic role of Achilles’ mentor or tutor (a function more closely associated with the centaur Cheiron); indeed, in the Iliad it is Achilles who gives advice and instructions to Patroclus when he dons Achilles’ armor and enters battle.13 Moreover, it is clearly Achilles who is the hero of higher status, both as the son of the king 9To be sure, women were capable of feeling erotic desire, as we see from numerous tragic hero- ines (Clytemnestra, Deianeira, Phaedra, Medea) and even comic characters (like the Old Women of Aristophanes’ Ecclesiazusae), but the term erastes was never used of a woman, and female erotic initiative in Athenian drama always leads to a disruption of the social and sexual order. Nothing in Euripides’ Alcestis suggests that erotic love is Alcestis’ motive, so much as a sense of duty to her marital partner. 10Whether Phaedrus intends by this critique to ridicule contemporary Orphic beliefs is a possi- bility I shall leave to others to investigate. 11See especially frs. 135–138 TGF. Clarke (1978) and more recently Davidson (2007: 255–284) have argued that a sexual relationship is understood already in Homer, but this view has not gained many adherents; for the opposite conclusion, see Barrett 1981; Patzer 1982: 94–98; and Halperin 1990: 75–87. Some even read the lines about Telemachus and Nestor’s son Peisistratus sleeping in the same bed (Hom. Od. 3.397–403) to imply that physical intimacy among male age-mates was common. However, epic tradition is generally reticent about same-sex love because, whatever may have been going on in Crete or Sparta at this time, it lacked sufficient pan-Hellenic status to be acknowledged in poems that were meant to appeal to all Greeks. Homosexuality is thus left as a possible reading for those members of the audience inclined to it, but it nowhere forces itself upon us. Neither of these relationships conform to the pederastic model familiar in later Greek history. See below, 96–97, n. 43. 12See Hubbard 2005: 138–140. 13At Iliad 11.786–789, Nestor quotes Patroclus’ father Menoitios telling him that since he is older, he should “speak well to him a closely-set saying” (e{ o ́ f‡syai pukin ̃n Ápow), “set </page> <page sequence="5"> THE PROBLEM OF PEDERASTIC HIERARCHY 85 of Phthia and the leader of the Myrmidons; Patroclus, on the other hand, is styled as the opadon or “squire” to Achilles. As the subordinate figure in the relationship, Patroclus can hardly be the erastes of Achilles, at least according to the usual sense of the term posited by Dover, Halperin, and others. Indeed, what Phaedrus fails to grasp is the genuine inadequacy and irrelevance of his (as well as Aeschylus’) conceptual schemata in analyzing a relationship such as that between Achilles and Patroclus. Both Phaedrus and Aeschylus run up against the problems inherent in trying to re-interpret Bronze Age heroic relationships in contemporary terms, a difficulty scholars of gender and sexuality today have with the Greeks in general. Phaedrus’ categorical confusion becomes even more apparent when he con- cludes his discussion (Symp. 180a–b): the gods, though they always value courage which comes from love, are most impressed and pleased, and grant the greatest rewards, when the younger man is loyal to his lover, than when the lover is loyal to him. That’s because the lover is a more divine creature than the younger man, since he is divinely inspired. And that’s why they honored Achilles more than Alcestis, and sent him to the Islands of the Blessed. On the one hand the lover is more divine than the beloved (which would suggest that Achilles, as the son of a goddess, must be the lover), but on the other the gods grant the greatest rewards to a beloved who is loyal to his lover (which contradicts Phaedrus’ initial contention that it is love that encourages lovers to act heroically by suggesting that a sense of loyalty or obligation to a lover could be even stronger). Phaedrus’ attempt to maintain the separation of these categories is revealed as even more futile when he returns to the example of the female Alcestis, whom he still classifies as a “lover,” but who could just as easily have been presented as a self-sacrificing beloved like Achilles. Phaedrus’ muddle-headedness about love, also evident in the Platonic dia- logue that bears his name (witness his naı ̈ve enthusiasm for Lysias’ discourse of non-erotic seduction), shows that individual case histories, even those of myth, prove stubbornly resistant to the neat theoretical models critics are so fond of presenting as global explanations of social phenomena. It is well-recognized that the preliminary speeches in the Symposium are all meant to be imperfect perspectives leading up, in the style of a priamel, to the revelations of the orac- ular Diotima of Mantinea,14 who mostly dispenses with the terms erastes and eromenos.15 Indeed, one could argue that the entire plot of the Symposium re- proposals before him” ([poysyai), and “point things out to him” (o ́ shma’nein). This is certainly not inconsistent with the kind of advice one might expect a pederastic lover to give a boy, but it could just as well be the advice an older teen brother might give, based on one or two years’ more experience with the world. It need not indicate a substantial difference in age. 14For this approach, see Rosen 1987; Allen 1991: 40–41; and Hunter 2004: 97–98. 15Although by far the longest in the Symposium (at 10.8 Stephanus pages), the speech of Socrates/Diotima uses the term erastes only twice (203c3, 210b5) and eromenos just once (204c2). </page> <page sequence="6"> 86 PHOENIX volves around deconstruction of these categories:16 at the beginning, we hear of Socrates’ barefoot imitator Aristodemus, said to be one of the elderly Socrates’ most fervent erastai at the time (\rast|w ãn \n to”w m‡lista tQn t—te, 173b); he encounters a freshly bathed Socrates, “who has become beautiful” (kal ̃w gegenhmnow, 174a). At the end, the young Alcibiades, the most desirable and notorious eromenos in all Athens in his youth (Plut. Alc. 3.1–5.3), a man of enduring sexual attractiveness and personal charm (Ar. Ran. 1425; Xen. Mem. 1.2.24; Diog. Laert. 4.49; Plut. Alc. 1.4–5, 24.5),17 likewise describes himself as an erastes of Socrates (217b–c), utterly unsuccessful in attempting to make Socrates his own erastes (218c). As Alcibiades formulates it in his speech’s finale, he experienced the same thing as Charmides, Euthydemus, and many others: like an erastes, Socrates has tricked them and thereby become their paidika in- stead of their erastes (\japatQn qw \rast|w paidikˆ m‰llon a[t ̃w kay’statai únt&amp; \rastoā, 222b). In seeking to be loved by Socrates, younger men come to love him,18 such that the conceptual categories based on age roles and ac- Contrast this with Phaedrus’ much shorter speech (2.3 Stephanus pages), which employs erastes seven times and eromenos three times, twice coupling the terms in explicit opposition (178e1–2, 180b2–3). Similarly, Pausanias (whose speech is 5.1 Stephanus pages) refers to the erastes seventeen times and the eromenos three times, specifically coupling the terms at 183c4–6. Neither Eryximachus nor Agathon use the terms at all; Aristophanes refers to an eromenos once (192e8), usually preferring the more colloquial paidika (which he uses four times). Alcibiades uses erastes five times and paidika three times. It is significant that the active/passive dichotomization implied by this terminology is not universal among the contributors to the Symposium: indeed, it is emphasized only in the first two speeches, which are arguably the least enlightened. The opposition between the two terms is not common in literature before Plato: the only clear example is Aristophanes, Knights 732–737, where eromenoi is used as a qualifying adjective with paides, suggesting that the substantive use of the term was not yet fully familiar to the play’s audience of 424 b.c. Modern commentators who regard these two terms as fundamental to understanding the social practice of Greek pederasty have erected their theoretical edifice on a rather thin textual foundation. 16Wardy (2002) argues for the dialogue’s systematic engagement with Heraclitus’ concept of unity within opposition, explicitly cited in Eryximachus’ speech (187a). The opposition of lover and beloved is one of those that Wardy (2002: 14–17) sees the dialogue collapsing, like tragedy and comedy, Poros and Penia, divine and human, male and female. See also Halperin 1986. 17For Alcibiades’ sexual ambivalence within the Athenian imaginary, see the stimulating dis- cussion of Wohl (2002: 124–170). Like a fifth-century b.c. Michael Jackson, Alcibiades was both eternally young (always remaining clean-shaven) and older than his years, both masculine and ef- feminate (see the transvestite death anecdote in Plut. Alc. 39), both gay and straight (Diog. Laert. 4.49), both a lover and beloved of the demos (Ar. Ran. 1425; Thuc. 6.29.3; Pl. Alc. 132a), not to mention being a character of shifting nationality and ethnic habitus. In the Symposium (216b–c), he admits to being both a slave to Socrates and a disobedient runaway. The same ambivalence extends to Socrates’ own relation to Alcibiades; in Plato’s Alcibiades (131c–e) and Gorgias (481d), Socrates is characterized as Alcibiades’ erastes, as he was in Aeschines of Sphettos’ Alcibiades (fr. 11 Dittmar), which Kahn (1994: 93–94) argues was the original literary work to introduce the theme of an erotic relationship between the two men. 18Compare the concept of anteros later articulated in Phaedrus 255b–e. On the importance of the beloved’s agency in the doctrine of the Phaedrus, see Ferrari 1987: 173–180. Halperin (1986) argues that Plato already in the Symposium is working toward this kind of reciprocity in his own doctrine </page> <page sequence="7"> THE PROBLEM OF PEDERASTIC HIERARCHY 87 tive/passive distinctions become meaningless. Some critics have interpreted the Symposium as a critique of pederasty more broadly,19 but I would propose that it is really only an overly role-scripted, non-reciprocal, structuralist analysis of pederasty that it criticizes. Phaedrus is certainly neither the first nor the last student of Greek love to flounder by adhering to overly mechanical definitions of category and the ideological assumptions behind them. ii. admetus, apollo (and alcestis) Since Phaedrus has encouraged us to think with myths, I would like to expand upon one of his examples, that of Alcestis and Admetus, by including the troubling third party in that relationship, the perpetually young god Apollo. Here too we find a situation that inverts all the usual categories and shibboleths and reveals a far more complex interpersonal reality than the one we thought we knew and understood. In the developed version of this myth, as recorded in the Bibliotheca attributed to Apollodorus (1.9.15, 3.10.4), Apollo kills the Cyclopes, forgers of Zeus’ thunderbolt, to avenge the lightning-struck death of his son Asclepius, whom Zeus had to kill because of his attempt to bring a man back from the dead. Zeus at first plans to punish Apollo by throwing him into Tartarus, but Leto persuades him instead to sentence Apollo to serve as a menial laborer for a mortal man, the Thessalian king Admetus, for a term of one year. Apollo tends Admetus’ herd and rewards his master by making the cattle bear twins. During this period, Admetus woos Alcestis, the daughter of Pelias, who has set as a test for all potential suitors that they should bring him a chariot yoked to a boar and a lion; Apollo uses his divine powers to yoke the chariot for Admetus. Omitting sacrifice to Artemis at the wedding, Admetus finds his bridal chamber full of snakes on the wedding night, but again Apollo helps by advising him how to propitiate the goddess. Moreover, Apollo intercedes with the Fates to release Admetus from death if a volunteer can be found to die in his place; Alcestis steps into that role, but is eventually returned to the living either by the agency of Persephone or Heracles. The theme of overcoming death is clearly a leitmotif unifying this story, but what is not immediately apparent from Apollodorus’ narrative is why Apollo was so beneficent to Admetus and continued to bestow favors upon him that went far beyond the obligations of a year’s menial servitude. Callimachus’ Hymn to Apollo 47–49 identifies the god’s motivation as erotic: of love: “the Platonic approach all but erases the distinction between lover and beloved, between the active and passive partner—or, to put it better, the genius of Plato’s analysis is that it eliminates passivity altogether” (68). Both Halperin and I agree that Plato’s own approach differs markedly from conventional practice and values, although we differ on the construction and univocality of what he calls “Athenian moral convention” (66). 19See, for example, von Blanckenhagen 1992: 64–65 (who sees it as an increasingly outmoded institution by 416), and Brisson 2006 (who reads the institution exclusively in the structuralist terms proposed by Halperin 1990). </page> <page sequence="8"> 88 PHOENIX Fo”bon ka“ N—mion kikl}skomen \jti ke’nou, \j—t&amp; \p&amp; &amp;Amfruss ̃ zeug’tidaw Átrefen ]ppouw ±iyou [p&amp; Árvti kekaumnow &amp;Adm}toio. We call him Phoebus and Nomios from that time When, on the river Amphryssus, he fed the yoke horses Of the youth Admetus, burned by love. The hymn goes on to describe the fertility Apollo brings to all flocks that he favors, including the birth of twins (Hymn 2.54). The scholiast to Euripides’ Alcestis (ad v. 1 Schwartz) tells us that the epic poet Rhianus of Crete, who was a younger contemporary of Callimachus, also identified Apollo’s service to Admetus as a willing act of love; Rhianus probably treated this story in his vast ethnographic epic Thessalica.20 Plutarch (Amatorius 761e) also records that Admetus was Apollo’s beloved (as well as Heracles’!), and preserves the hexameter line &amp;Adm}t~ parayhteāsai mgan ew \niaut—n (“he was a common laborer in the service of Admetus for a great year”);21 J. U. Powell’s Collectanea Alexandrina assigns this line to Rhianus as fr. 10, but Plutarch does not specify the author. Was this erotic involvement merely a romanticizing interpretation by hellenistic poets, or was it an earlier development? Callimachus’ glancing allusion suggests a story he expected to be already familiar to his audience,22 and Plutarch’s anonymous muyologoāsin also implies that this was a relatively canonical version of the myth by his time, as it also appears to have been among the Roman poets.23 We hear a very similar (although less often repeated) story concerning Hermes in the Homeric Hymn to Pan (19.32–35), where Hermes is said to have tended flocks for a mortal man (Dryops) out of love for his daughter. Impregnated by the god, she gives birth to Pan. Could Callimachus (or Rhianus) have merely transferred the erotic motivation for Hermes’ service to Dryops onto the similar, but differently motivated story of Apollo’s service to Admetus? Such mixture of sources and stories is not uncharacteristic of the complex allusive technique of hellenistic poets. Or does the Homeric hymn reveal to us that 20This seems to me more likely than that it was a digression within his Heraclea, as assumed by Meineke (1843: 180–181) and Solimano (1970: 258–260). However, the latter possibility might explain the otherwise strange notice in Plutarch that both Apollo and Heracles were lovers of Admetus. 21A “great year” is to be distinguished from a normal year as a cycle of eight years (cf. Apollod. Bibl. 3.4.2). This would explain the notice in Servius ad Aen. 2.761 that Apollo’s term of service was actually nine years (eight years counted inclusively). This more extended period of service would certainly be consistent with a pederastic love relationship that lasts until the youth’s marriage. 22So also Wilamowitz (1895: 1.68, n. 125), who believes that Rhianus may have been Calli- machus’ source. 23See Solimano 1970, citing Tibullus 2.3.11–16; Lygdamus 4.65–81 = ps.-Tib. 3.4.65–81; Ov. Her. 5.151–152, AA 2.239–241; Sen. Phae. 296–298. Much later, we also find it in Nonnus 10.322– 324 and the so-called “Orphic” Argonautica 175–178, which repeats the verb yhteœv. Each of these sources cite the story as if it were already familiar to the audience. </page> <page sequence="9"> THE PROBLEM OF PEDERASTIC HIERARCHY 89 Figure 1 the erotic basis of such service is a deeply embedded mythological motif (also detectable in the story of Heracles and Omphale),24 obscured in the case of Apollo only by the fragmentary nature of our sources and the prudishness of later mythographers? Some intriguing artistic evidence may help us, although not conclusively. An Apulian oinochoe from the mid-fourth century (Figure 1 = Fiesole, Villa Pagliaiuola 116 = RVAp 16.68 = CVA Italia, fasc. 58, pl. 18–20 = LIMC 1.1: 220, no. 11 and 1.1:536, no. 18) shows Heracles rescuing Alcestis in its lower central frame and immediately to the left in the same register two naked youths engaging in friendly conversation, both holding laurel branches. The youth on the right clearly has the long locks typical of Apollo, and if we are right in identifying the other youth as Admetus, the scene is suggestive: rather than greeting his wife upon her joyful return from the dead, Admetus’ attention is entirely absorbed in his relationship with the god.25 Indeed, he is the figure positioned furthest away from Alcestis. The chariot yoked to a boar and lion was an occasional scene in art of the archaic period (see LIMC 1.1: 219, nos. 1–3); in one of these representations, an Ionian gold ring from the late sixth- century (Figure 2 = LIMC no. 2), a youth is mounted in the chariot, led by a 24The first certain indication of an erotic relationship between Heracles and Omphale is a fourth- century Apulian hydria (Berlin F3291 = RVAp 16.60 = LIMC 7.1: 46–47, no. 5) showing an Eros flying between them. However, fifth-century art does show Omphale assuming Heracles’ costume (e.g., Getty 77.AE.45), suggesting her assumption of masculine initiative in the relationship. The story was treated in some detail by the mythographers Pherecydes of Athens (FGrH 3F77 and 82) and Herodorus (FGrH 31F33), as well as in satyr plays by Ion of Chios and Achaeus, who may well have been intrigued by the erotic aspects of the situation. 25On the interpretation of this vase, see Trendall and Cambitoglou 1978: 1.427–428 and Sal- adino 1979: 99–101. The former say, “Apollo bids farewell to Admetus with a gesture of admon- ishment for the future.” If this is correct, it implies that Admetus’ reunion with his wife represents the end of the relationship between Apollo and Admetus. </page> <page sequence="10"> 90 PHOENIX Figure 2 winged Eros.26 Does this depict Admetus bringing the chariot to Pelias out of his love for Alcestis? Or is it Apollo bringing the chariot to Admetus out of erotic devotion? The most detailed interpretation of the myth of Apollo and Admetus to date is that of the French historian Bernard Sergent,27 who believes that Greek pederasty and most of the myths associated with it descend from early Indo- European initiatory rites. He notes the similarity of Apollo’s providing Admetus with the magical talisman that wins a bride (the chariot yoked to a boar and lion) to Poseidon’s gift of divine horses that permits Pelops to win the chariot race with Oenomaus and thus obtain his bride Hippodameia: in both cases, a pederastic relationship with a god prepares a young man for the feat of compet- itive masculinity that wins him a bride and thus a full place in the adult repro- ductive community. Although acknowledging this initiatory structure, Sergent resists seeing Apollo as an initiator or even as the erastes in the relationship, since Admetus already holds the authoritative position of king and in this case Apollo is his vassal and servant, which Sergent regards as inconsistent with the role of an erastes. He also subscribes to Vian’s theory that Apollo’s banishment from Olympus is itself a period of the god’s own initiatory isolation.28 Sergent thus comes to the rather surprising conclusion that it is actually Admetus who is the erastes and Apollo who is the eromenos in the relationship: If one is willing to accept what it is the purpose of this book to prove, namely, that initiation in protohistorical Greece normally involved the sexual subjection of the novice 26For the winged figure as either Eros or a wedding spirit, see Schauenburg (1957: 214), who reproduces the ring as Plate 3, Fig. 6. 27Sergent 1986: 102–108. 28Sergent 1986: 106–107, citing Vian 1963: 116–117. </page> <page sequence="11"> THE PROBLEM OF PEDERASTIC HIERARCHY 91 to the teacher, then Apollo, model of the kouroi, a kouros himself, and the educator par excellence, must have undergone the full cycle of education in order to become what he is, for example, in the Hyacinthus myth, the erastes and teacher. The sexual submission of god to king must have struck Greek minds as unspeakably shocking . . . . Thus it is not surprising that we find no mention of it in literature prior to its revelation, in inverted form, in the work of a poet of the early hellenistic era.29 Sergent complicates matters yet further by subscribing to the old theory, originating with K. O. Mu ̈ller, that Admetus (“the untamed One”) is really a double for Hades and Alcestis for Kore, hence Apollo’s being sent to Admetus as an equivalent punishment to Tartarus.30 Other scholars have justly criticized Sergent’s book for its uncritical belief in Indo-European origins, despite the scantiest of evidence from cultures other than Greece, its overreliance on a schematic concept of initiation applied to a historical period in which initiation as such no longer took place, and its excessive credence in the universality and historicity of the Cretan pederastic abduction ritual described by the fourth- century historian Ephorus (FGrH 70F149).31 In addition, we must observe that his rhetoric of “subjection” and “submission,” like Halperin’s, leads to an overly rigid dichotomization of roles in a same-sex relationship that obscures, rather than clarifies, its interpersonal complexity. As with Phaedrus’ speech in the Symposium, confusion is the inevitable result. In fact, one could argue that it is really the eromenos who subjects his lover to torment, and the erastes who submits to the overpowering force of Eros. This is of course a topos of hellenistic poetry (e.g., Theocritus’ desperate boy-lovers in Id. 12, 23, and 30, the lover as tortured bird in Rhianus, AP 12.142, the victim consumed by fire in Meleager, AP 12.63, or the `m—douloi “fellow-slaves” of AP 12.81.5). But it was already commonplace even in pederastic lyric of the archaic period: boy-lovers “melt” (Ibyc. fr. 287.1–2 PMGF; Pind. fr. 123.10–12), endure chains (Thgn. 1306–7) and yokes upon their neck (Ibyc. fr. 287.6–7 PMGF; Thgn. 371–372, 1357–58), fall into nets (Ibyc. fr. 287.3–4 PMGF), and suffer heart-ache (Thgn. 1091). The beloved boy can “tame minds” (Thgn. 1235) and act as the “charioteer of the soul” (Anac. fr. 360 PMG). Anacreon declares that Love strikes him with a great hammer and plunges him into a wintry torrent (fr. 413 PMG). Servitium amoris certainly existed long before the Roman elegists. In this context, nothing should surprise us in seeing Apollo as simultaneously a lover and vassal of Admetus. 29Sergent 1986: 107–108. 30Sergent 1986: 108. Cf. Mu ̈ller 1825: 300–306; Wilamowitz 1886: 75–76; and Weber 1936: 138–147. This view was already devastatingly refuted by Lesky (1925: 8–9). 31See especially Dover 1988: 115–134; Percy 1996: 19–26; and Dodd 2000. Sergent’s later book (Sergent 1996) attempts to broaden his repertoire of non-Greek evidence for Indo-European pederasty, but his examples are still scattered and many of them very late. For a more general critique of initiation theory as it tends to be applied to Greek literary narratives, see Dodd 2003 and Graf 2003. </page> <page sequence="12"> 92 PHOENIX One of the difficulties of Indo-Europeanist interpretation of Greek myths is the assumption that all elements of the myth can be traced synchronically back to a pre-historical origin. Literary scholars, however, rightly insist on examining myths from a diachronic point of view, recognizing that different elements of a narrative may derive from distinct sources in various periods, and must be interpreted each within its appropriate historical and generic context. Accordingly, it is worthwhile to review our sources for this myth in order to determine how far back the erotic interpretation of the story may go. There is no question that Apollo’s association with Admetus was early: Iliad 2.763–767 says that Eumelus (Admetus’ son) brought to Troy horses that had been tended by Apollo, presumably during the god’s year with Admetus. The Hesiodic corpus (fr. 54 MW), probably from the Catalogue of Women, relates the origin of Apollo’s servitude in Leto’s intervention to dissuade Zeus from casting Apollo into Tartarus in punishment for killing the Cyclopes to avenge Asclepius’ death; this version is attributed to Hesiod both by Philodemus in De Pietate (P.Herc. 433, fr. VIII,5–12 = p. 88, Schober) and the Euripidean scholia (Schol. Alcest. ad v.1 Schwartz), and is confirmed by a papyrus fragment apparently on the subject (P.Oxy. 2495, fr. 1[a]). In a brilliant reconstruction of this part of the Hesiodic Catalogue that antedated the discovery of the papyrus, Wilamowitz proposed that it was part of the section concerning Apollo’s love of Asclepius’ mother Coronis (cf. Hes. frs. 59–61 MW), which was also located in the same part of Thessaly; Wilamowitz noted several points of correspondence between the Ischys/Coronis episode and that of Admetus and Alcestis, especially the intervention of Artemis as a terminating figure in each relationship.32 Wilamowitz did not address the question of whether Apollo’s status as a rival lover of one marital partner was also 32Wilamowitz 1886: 65–73. Note also that Coronis is called parynow údm}w (“untamed maiden”) in fr. 59.4 MW. West (1985: 69–72) argues that there was no Ehoie of Coronis, since fr. 50 MW suggests that the Hesiodic Catalogue made Asclepius the son of Apollo and the Leucippid Arsinoe ̈ and fr. 52 MW says that it was in the catalogue of the Leucippids that Hesiod narrated Apollo’s killing of the Cyclopes; Schwartz (1960: 397–403) also thinks Arsinoe ̈ was the mother according to Hesiod. Wilamowitz (1886: 77–80) anticipated this objection by proposing that these two fragments reflect a later Messenian-inspired interpolation into the Catalogue, a view at odds with West’s theory of the Catalogue’s organic unity; later, in Wilamowitz 1905: 123, he suggests that the Catalogue of the Leucippids was a completely separate work. The source of fr. 50 (Paus. 2.26.7) admits that Arsinoe ̈ as the mother of Asclepius was the least well-attested version of the story and may indeed have been interpolated into Hesiod. Archaic tradition as preserved in the H. Hymn to Asclepius (16.2–3) and Pindar’s Pythian (3.8–40) favors Coronis as the mother of Asclepius; in most mythological matters, Pindar follows Hesiodic genealogy (as he clearly does in making Ischys the son of Elatus; see fr. 60 MW). If a work as authoritative as the Hesiodic Catalogue originally recorded the Messenian version of the story, it seems strange that we find so little echo of it in later mythography, outside of Asclepiades of Tragilus (FGrH 12F32), who generally derived his material from tragedy, Crates of Mallus (cited by the Hesiodic scholia adTheog. 142 = fr. 52 MW), and the rather dismissive comment of Pausanias. Accordingly, I tend to think that Wilamowitz was right about the form of the original Hesiodic version, but the matter remains uncertain. </page> <page sequence="13"> THE PROBLEM OF PEDERASTIC HIERARCHY 93 a parallel linking the Coronis and Alcestis stories either in the Hesiodic account or the local mythology that was its source, but the possibility is intriguing. Philodemus cites the early fifth-century genealogist Acusilaus of Argos, whose work was mainly based on Hesiod, as confirming what we know of the Hesiodic version (FGrH 2F19). Pherecydes of Athens, a mythographer and genealogist about one generation later, who is cited by the Euripidean scholia, adds that Apollo’s term of service was one year (FGrH 3F35a), as does the fifth-century epic poet Panyassis of Halicarnassus (fr. 16.2–3 Davies). Pherecydes also relates that it was during the time that Apollo herded Admetus’ cattle that he gave Hermes his magic wand (FGrH 3F131), thus integrating this myth with that of the Homeric Hymn to Hermes. All these sources seem to share a characteriza- tion of Apollo’s service as that of a thete (Panyassis uses the verb yhteusmen, Philodemus [P.Herc. 433, fr. VIII,4 and 12 = p. 88 Schober] yhteāsai, the Euripidean scholia yhte’a; cf. Rhianus, fr. 10 Powell parayhteāsai), in other words not a slave, but a wage-laborer. Apollo’s involvement in Admetus’ relationship with Alcestis also appears to be early. As we noted above with regard to a sixth-century Etruscan gold ring, the yoking of the chariot to a boar and lion was a well-attested artistic motif in the late archaic period, going back to the late sixth-century Amyclae throne, as described by Pausanias (3.18.16). Aeschylus (Eum. 723–728) alludes to Apollo’s intervening with the Fates to make Admetus “immortal.” Although the Furies’ colorful charge that Apollo accomplished his goal by getting the Fates drunk may well be Aeschylus’ innovation, the brief and elliptical nature of the allusion (not even naming Admetus, but merely referring to the “house of Pheres”) indicates that the basic story was pre-Aeschylean. Phrynichus’ Alcestis may have been his immediate point of reference. Apollo’s role as the sponsor of Admetus’ simultaneous salvation and tragic loss is of course the starting point of Euripides’ Alcestis, where the god appears to deliver the prologue, makes a half- hearted effort to dissuade Thanatos from taking Alcestis, and then disappears altogether. Both of the tragic texts suggest that Apollo’s motivation in rescuing Admetus is to reward his piety: in the Eumenides, Apollo defends himself by asking oákoun d’kaion t ̃n sbont&amp; e[ergete”n (“Isn’t it just to benefit the man who is reverent?,” Aesch. Eum. 725), and in Euripides, Apollo attributes his protection to Admetus being Ðsiow (“holy,” Eur. Alc. 10). Most men, no matter how pious, are not rewarded with escape from death, so we might feel justified in being dissatisfied with this explanation as the original one, but it is probably the one most in keeping with the serious tone one expects of tragedy. Even if some earlier sources had attributed an erotic coloring to the relationship of Apollo and Admetus, it would be an ill-fitting distraction to acknowledge it in either of our extant plays.33 33Elsewhere I have argued (2006: 237–243) that pederastic themes are usually treated negatively in Euripides, in keeping with their general marginalization in later fifth-century literature. </page> <page sequence="14"> 94 PHOENIX iii. admetus songs Bacchylides 3.76–84 (datable to 468) terminates a series of gnomic statements on the uncertainty and vicissitudes of the mortal condition by quoting a piece of advice Apollo once gave the “son of Pheres,” warning him that one should live every day as if it could be one’s last or as if one might live another fifty years. This insight is certainly appropriate to Admetus’ experience and parallels it to the poem’s main narrative of Apollo’s unexpected rescue of Croesus, whom he takes to the land of the Hyperboreans. The style of this advice certainly resem- bles traditions of wisdom poetry like the Precepts of Cheiron or Theognis’ advice to Cyrnus, tinged with overtones of adult solicitude and pederastic affection.34 Indeed, evidence suggests that a tradition of logoi Admetou or mele Admetou may have been well-known already in the fifth century, with the genitive mean- ing “addressed to Admetus” (cf. S Ar. Vesp. 1245 Koster, and Zenobius 1.18: &amp;Adm}tou mlow: t ̃ ew &amp;Admhton mlow Æd—menon).35 In addition to the gnome cited in Bacchylides 3, Athenaeus 15.694c preserves in his collection of Attic scholia the following couplet in the Greater Asclepiad meter: &amp;Adm}tou l—gon, ã &amp;ta”re, mayWn tow úgayow f’lei, tQn deilQn d&amp; úpxou, gnow Ðti deilQn `l’ga x‡riw. Friend, learn the saying addressed to Admetus and love good men, But stay away from the base, recognizing that little reciprocity comes from them. Attic comedy refers to this couplet repeatedly as a sympotic song just as traditional as the Harmodius or Kleitagora scholia (Ar. Vesp. 1238–48 and fr. 444 PCG; Cratinus fr. 254 PCG). The Aristophanic scholia (ad Vesp. 1238), which also quote the same couplet, tell us that some had credited the lines to Sappho or Alcaeus (presumably because of the Aeolic meter), but it was actually the work of the fifth-century poetess Praxilla of Sicyon (to whom Page assigns it as fr. 749 PMG). Ruth Scodel has noted its close verbal and conceptual similarity to many of the gnomes in the Theognid collection,36 but does not observe its erotic connotations or those of the parallel passages in Theognis. Although this couplet is usually interpreted as an admonition on choosing friends, f’lei equally means “love” in an erotic sense and x‡riw is a word that frequently bears the sense of “erotic reciprocation.”37 When Theognis warns Cyrnus not to associate with base men, he is not merely expressing a sense of class or political 34The erotic context of Theognid poetry is explicit. Kurke (1990: 94–95) suggests there were also erotic overtones to the Precepts of Cheiron. 35See Kurke 1990: 104–107 for this and other possible traditions of archaic or classical advice poetry presented in the persona of mythological characters. Maehler (1982: 1.2.55) also proposes a tradition of logoi Admetou that may lurk behind this passage. 36Scodel 1979: 51–54. 37For phil-words in explicitly pederastic contexts, see Thgn. 1238a, 1241, 1253, 1255, 1270, 1278b, 1296, 1312–16, 1345, 1357, 1359, 1361, 1364, 1368, 1379. Thgn. 1319–22 plays upon the various erotic meanings of charis (“beauty,” “charm,” “favor,” “sexual reciprocation”); see also </page> <page sequence="15"> THE PROBLEM OF PEDERASTIC HIERARCHY 95 exclusivity, but, viewed within the context of their personal relationship, he is also telling Cyrnus to avoid rival lovers.38 It bears noting that the two other scholia that comedy groups together with this one also invoke an erotic context: Harmodius was notably the heroic beloved of Aristogeiton, and Kleitagora was likely a greedy courtesan.39 So confusing the Admetus song and the Harmodius song (Ar. fr. 444 PCG) is natural, in that both were famous eromenoi. Similarly, mixing up the Admetus song and the Kleitagora song (Cratinus fr. 254 PCG) is a bit of gender confusion. If the tradition of “Admetus songs” (i.e., songs for Admetus) does indeed suggest Admetus as a beloved under the tutelage of Apollo, it is still necessary to locate a source for the narrative background to this assumed love relationship. It is interesting to note that Bacchylides 3.76–84 is immediately followed in 3.85–96 by a series of lines parodying Pindar’s Sicilian odes.40 Could Pindar have been associated with the story of Apollo and Admetus? In a largely forgotten article over seventy-five years ago,41 J. T. Kakridis proposed that he was: we have noted the parallel to the erotic interpretation of the Pelops and Poseidon myth, which is usually regarded as a Pindaric invention,42 and Kakridis suggests that Pindar’s refusal to believe anything bad about the gods also caused him to reject the Hesiodic story of Apollo killing the Cyclopes to avenge the death of Asclepius (the narrative of Pythian 3 stops just before this event). According to this line of reasoning, a voluntary erotic association between Apollo and Admetus would be less disgraceful to the god than being condemned to servitude as punishment for challenging Zeus. 1263–66, 1299–1304, 1331, 1367, 1372. For a general treatment of charis as an erotic term in archaic poetry, see MacLachlan 1993: 56–72. 38See especially Thgn. 1238a–40, 1243–44, 1311–18, 1377–80. 39The Aristophanic scholia identify her as either a Thessalian (adVesp. 1245) or Laconian poetess (ad Lys. 1237), but we never hear of such a poetess in any other source; both identifications appear to be deductions from geographical cues in the respective texts. The mention of “money and violence for both Kleitagora and me” in Vesp. 1245–47 sounds more like the interaction between a lover and courtesan, and the contrast between the Kleitagora song and the Telamon song in Lys. 1236–37 suggests the love vs. war antithesis that is fundamental to the whole play. 40Not only does 3.85, frononti sunetˆ garœv, parody Ol. 2.85–88, a passage critical of lesser poets that many since the time of the scholia have seen as directed against Simonides and Bacchylides, but 3.85–87 (on ether, water, and gold), a passage that otherwise seems to be a non sequitur, obviously cites the famous opening priamel of Ol. 1.1–7 (water, gold, the sun in the ether, Olympia). It is less often noted that 3.90–91, úret‰w ge mn o[ minœyei . . . fggow, echoes Pyth. 1.94 (of Croesus’ areta that does not waste away after his death), 3.92, Moās‡ nin trfei, cites Ol. 1.112, and 3.94–96 on silence as an inappropriate response to success resembles Nem. 9.7. All of these Pindaric texts are earlier than 468 and were likely to have been well known at Syracuse. For some of these, as well as other Pindaric echoes, see Maehler 1982: 1.2.56–60. 41Kakridis 1931. 42For a convincing defense of this position, see Fehr 1936: 104–105 and Ko ̈hnken 1974: 200–204, although I do not follow them in believing that Poseidon’s association with Pelops as a whole was Pindar’s invention. See Hubbard 1987: 16, n. 2. </page> <page sequence="16"> 96 PHOENIX Kakridis’ most intriguing piece of evidence is a passage from Clement of Alexandria’s Stromateis (1.21.107.2): EkQtvw îra ka“ ` BoiQtiow P’ndarow gr‡fei “\n xr—n~ d&amp; \gnet&amp; &amp;ApQllvn” ka“ o[dn yaumast—n, Ðpou ge ka“ &amp;Adm}t~ yhte”vn e[r’sketai sn ka“ ^Hrakle! “mgan ew \niaut—n.” Even the Boeotian Pindar appropriately writes, “In time Apollo was born.” No wonder, when he, together with Heracles, is found to be a wage-laborer in the service of Admetus “for a great year.” Snell and Maehler (2001) assign the Pindaric quotation to the so-called Hymn to Zeus as fr. 33b, but it could of course just as well come from a hymn to Apollo or some other poem. The central question is whether Clement’s citation of Pin- dar merely refers to the quote about the birth of Apollo or includes the following information as well. The purpose of this chapter in the Stromateis is to estab- lish the chronology of Greek mythology through synchronies and ultimately to prove that all the stories of Greek myth describe human events considerably more recent than the time of Moses. Hence the real point of Clement’s com- ment is to establish the synchrony of Apollo (who for Clement was a human being) with Heracles; there might be more point to his invoking the authority of Pindar if Pindar was in fact the source for this synchrony, rather than merely the insignificant fragment about Apollo being born. Particularly interesting is that this passage provides our one other attestation of Heracles having the same relation to Admetus as Apollo, also mentioned by Plutarch in Amatorius 761e. However, Plutarch emphasizes that both Apollo and Heracles were lovers of Admetus, whereas Clement’s information is that they both served Admetus as wage-laborers at the same time. It is therefore unlikely that Plutarch was Clement’s direct source, but they both appear to be talking about the same oth- erwise unattested story and therefore probably share a common source. Clement and Plutarch both quote the phrase mgan ew \niaut—n, but Plutarch quotes it as the second half of a hexameter line; if this same hexameter poem (whether of Rhianus or someone else) is the common source for both Plutarch and Clement, then Clement is mixing his quotation of Pindar with citation of some other un- named poet. So Kakridis’s proposal must be regarded as possible, but uncertain. iv. apollo EROTIKOS In assessing whether the erotic motivation for Apollo’s continuing patronage of Admetus may have had pre-hellenistic sources, it may be helpful to examine when and how other narratives concerning Apollo’s erotic adventures developed. I suspect that the romantic problems of Apollo were mostly an inflection given his myths by the lyric poets, even as the pederastic involvement of Zeus and Ganymede was.43 What we can say for certain, even if the exact beginnings 43The Iliad (20.232–235) and the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite (202–217) merely say that Zeus (H. Hymn) or “the gods” (Iliad) carried him off because of his beauty, so that the gods could enjoy </page> <page sequence="17"> THE PROBLEM OF PEDERASTIC HIERARCHY 97 of each story remain obscure, is that these stories became a matter of special interest to poets in the late sixth and early fifth centuries, who seem to have taken delight in elaborating and complicating the narratives. We have already noted the story of Coronis, who rejected Apollo to marry the mortal Ischys; the sixth-century compilers of the Hesiodic Catalogue probably took this plot from local Thessalian traditions. We cannot rule out the possibility that a romantic relationship between Apollo and Admetus was also embedded in local Thessalian cult and tradition; indeed, Davidson has integrated evidence to suggest that the Thessalians were closer to the Macedonians in practicing a non-pederastic form of homosexuality.44 But even if the story’s origins were local, it must have been the lyric poets who made it pan-Hellenic. I would adduce three other examples which point to late sixth or early fifth-century romantic elaborations with regard to Apollo:45 (1). The Iliad in a single line (9.557) alludes to Marpessa, whom Apollo had kidnapped and who was later returned to her mortal suitor Idas; similarly Pausanias (5.18.2) narrates that the Chest of Cypselus, from the first half of the sixth century, depicts Idas bringing her back, not unwillingly, after Apollo had carried her off. However, Simonides (fr. 563 PMG) appears to have been the first to have formulated the myth in such a way that Marpessa was granted an active choice by Zeus between Idas and Apollo, and of course chose her mortal suitor in preference to the god, thinking that Apollo would abandon her in old age. Simonides’ version is clearly represented on a red-figure psykter by the Pan Painter (Figure 3a–b), datable to ca 480 b.c. Here we see, moving from the left, Apollo, Artemis, and an adult male figure who some have identified as Evenus, the father of Marpessa, but who might also be seen as Zeus, and then Marpessa, and the bearded Idas, who appears further advanced in aiming looking at him as he served wine (yaāma de”n, p‡ntessi tetimnow úyan‡toisi, H. Hymn 205;  ̈n' úyan‡toisi mete’h, Il. 20.235); Little Iliad, fr. 6 Davies, makes Ganymede the son of Laomedon rather than Tros (his father in H. Hymn 207) and identifies the compensatory gift as a golden grapevine rather than horses (as in H. Hymn 210–217). But it also says nothing explicit about a pederastic relationship. The difference in the two versions suggests a lack of canonical status in epic tradition. As I have argued (2006: 233–234), the epic tradition tends to be reticent in matters relating to homosexuality: inasmuch as epic aims to be pan-Hellenic, the “peculiar institution” of pederasty, which was not equally practiced in all Greek states at all times, was out of place. On the other hand, lyric and elegiac authors had no inhibition in asserting the erotic nature of Zeus’ relationship to Ganymede: cf. Thgn. 1345–48; Ibyc. fr. 289 PMGF; Pind. Ol. 1.43–45, 10.103–105; and perhaps Alcman fr. S4.8 PMGF, if we accept Lobel’s supplement. For other pederastic myths in the lyric poets, cf. Ibyc. fr. 309 PMGF; Pind. Ol. 1.40–42; and perhaps Praxilla fr. 753 PMG, although its interpretation is uncertain. 44Davidson 2007: 360–365. He argues for a North Greek sexuality at some variance from Athenian and Spartan norms. With regard to Thessaly particularly, he cites the evidence of Meno of Pharsalus, who was known to maintain a bearded beloved (Xen. Anab. 2.6.28), and the presence of Achilles-Patroclus cults. However, if one accepts my argument (2002: 260–261) that Pind. Pyth. 10 was commissioned by the Thessalian prince Thorax for his beloved Pythocleas, at least some form of pederasty must also have existed in Thessaly. 45 I repeat the following numbered sections from Hubbard 2009. </page> <page sequence="18"> 98 PHOENIX Figure 3a his arrow at Apollo than Apollo is in aiming his. Marpessa signals her prefer- ence for Idas by looking in his direction, at his bow and arrow, and moreover by lifting up the fringe of her skirt in his direction, as if to give a covert sig- nal. The scene is represented elsewhere in fifth-century vase painting as well.46 It may be significant that Idas is here represented as fully bearded, more ma- ture than the ephebic Apollo and therefore in some sense possessing superior claims, despite his mortal status. Simonides’ nephew Bacchylides also treated the Marpessa story in two poems of which we have fragments (Bacch. 20.4–11, fr. 20A.13–48 S-M); while we do not have this particular episode in these two lacunose fragments, Bacchylides does support Idas’ heroic claims by narrating his defeat of Marpessa’s father Evenus in a deadly chariot race, through a gift of divine horses from his father Poseidon; the parallels with Pindar’s narration of Pelops’ defeat of Oenomaus are clear. As I argued many years ago in an interpretation of Olympian 1,47 defeating the bride’s father in an athletic com- petition to the death is the ultimate sign of a fully completed initiation process, wherein the initiand exhibits his worthiness of marital consummation by forcibly displacing the older male who had previously exercised exclusive dominion over the female. In contrast to Idas, Apollo remains the perpetual ephebe and thus fails in his quest for Marpessa. 46See LIMC 6.1: 365, nos. 3 and 4, respectively a red-figure stamnos by the Triptolemus Painter (Paris C10834 + Florence 19B41 = ARV2 191.100 + 361.3) and a red-figure amphora (London 1895.10–31.1 = ARV2 583.1), both ca 460 b.c.

Although Cassandra is a little-heeded prophetess in the Cypria, it is first in Aeschylus (Ag. 1202–12) that we hear the cause of her not being be- lieved to be a curse of Apollo after she deceived him. Pindar (Paean 8A) and Bacchylides (Bacch. 23) also wrote poems in which Cassandra played a ma- jor role, although the tattered remnants tell us little about their treatment of her background. While Aeschylus may not have necessarily been the one who invented the erotic element in the story, the motif of Cassandra actively de- ceiving Apollo by giving her consent to him and then later withholding it may be original here: this version of the myth seems especially appropriate in the context of the Agamemnon, where Clytemnestra has just finished seducing her husband under false pretenses. Moreover, the fact that Apollo was able to be deceived by Cassandra in the first place foreshadows the more fully developed problematization of his omniscience and authority that one will also encounter in the Eumenides. Indeed, it seems an appropriate pendant to Cassandra’s erotic rejection of the god that she at the end rejects his gift of prophecy as well by casting to the ground her prophetic fillets and scepter (Ag. 1264–68), imagining the god as her ravisher (Ag. 1269–76). Apollo’s often-noted contempt for the female gender, foregrounded in his conflict with the Furies (see especially Eum. 625–666), is integral to the trilogy’s pervasive theme of gender polarization and conflict.48 If a romantic version of the Apollo-Admetus relationship does indeed predate Aeschylus, the Furies’ accusatory allusion to it (Eum. 723–724) gains added point. 48Only Athena, female in sex but not in gender, receives his respect. For Apollo’s place within the general conflict between male and female in the trilogy, see Finley 1955: 279–280; Zeitlin 1978: 155, 162–172 = Zeitlin 1996: 93–94, 100–116; Goldhill 1984: 248–283. </page> <page sequence="20"> 100 PHOENIX Figure 4 (3). Perhaps most relevant to our present concerns is the case of Hyacinthus. Although the Spartan Hyacinthia were clearly a ritual of some antiquity with initiatory associations,49 it is unclear whether Apollo’s involvement with Hy- acinthus was from the beginning meant to be pederastic; however, Paul Cart- ledge has drawn attention to some epigraphical evidence suggesting it was in- terpreted this way as early as the last half of the sixth century, at least in the Laconian perioikos.50 Hyacinthus’ death by the discus is mentioned in the Hes- iodic Catalogue of Women (fr. 171 MW), but the fourth-century mythographer Palaephatus is the earliest extant literary source to characterize Apollo’s relation- ship to him in erotic terms;51 Palaephatus moreover relates that the discus fell on Hyacinthus because it was blown off-course by Zephyrus, who was a jealous rival. A compiler like Palaephatus would certainly not have been the originator of this story, and we find it attested in iconographic representations from the beginning of the fifth century (Figure 4). We find numerous representations of Hyacinthus astride a swan, a bird often associated with Apollo;52 the phallic protrusion of the swan’s neck through the boy’s thighs in Fig. 4 can leave us 49See Pettersson 1992: 9–41 and Calame 1997: 174–185 for the most recent and detailed treatments of this festival and its significance, which included female as well as male initiation. 50Cartledge 2003: 208, n. 18, citing SEG 28.404, referring to a Hyacinthian aı ̈tas, a Spartan term for eromenos. 51 It should be noted that this section (46) and all the later chapters of Palaephatus’ Peri Apiston are preserved in only one manuscript and are therefore bracketed as spurious by Festa (1902: 67). 52See LIMC 5.1: 547–548, nos. 3–33. For the swan’s association with Apollo, attested as early as Sappho and Alcaeus, see the sources listed in Pettersson 1992: 30, n. 157 and RE II.2, 788–789, s.v. “Schwan.” That this must be a swan of Apollo here is proven by LIMC no. 35, an Etruscan oinochoe (Vatican G111) that depicts a figure who is clearly Apollo (as identified by the laurel branch and crown) in a horse-drawn chariot on one side and a boy (presumably Hyacinthus) in a swan-driven chariot on the other. Pettersson (1992: 32) suggests that the swan was depicted on these vases instead of an anthropomorphic Apollo because it was inappropriate to depict both erastes and eromenos as equally young in art of this period. However, this was not at all true. Moreover, Zephyrus, who is often depicted, is just as youthful as Apollo; Hyacinthus is sometimes presented as a mere boy who is clearly shorter and more slender than Apollo would be (Fig. 4). We must therefore seek elsewhere for a reason why a swan is always (with the exception of the Etruscan oinochoe) depicted in lieu of Apollo. Probably the literary account behind the iconography had </page> <page sequence="21"> THE PROBLEM OF PEDERASTIC HIERARCHY 101 in no doubt concerning the erotic implications of the swan’s seduction. We are of course reminded of Ganymede and the eagle, although that motif is fourth- century in date and probably derivative of this one. The second common icono- graphical representation associated with Hyacinthus is the winged figure we see chasing him in Fig. 4.53 This plethora of iconographic representations, all be- ginning right around 500 b.c., must have been inspired by some contemporary literary source, although we cannot at present identify it. However, Pausanias’ description of the Amyclae throne in Sparta (Paus. 3.19.3–5), dating also to the last quarter of the sixth century, suggests a very different image of Hyacinthus, for here he appears as a bearded, somewhat older figure, no longer the fair ado- lescent. Even if in this form he was a beloved of Apollo, the Hyacinthus of Spartan ritual may have been very different from the literary-artistic construction we know from fifth-century Attic pottery. The seduction by Apollo in the form of a swan and particularly the inclusion of Zephyr as a rival were unlikely to have been elements of Spartan ritual, but seem to be the kind of romantic color we would expect a non-Spartan lyric poet to add to the story. In another article,54 I suggest that Apollo’s various romantic difficulties, including rejection by women (Coronis, Cassandra, Cumaean Sibyl, Sinope, Marpessa, Daphne), naivete ́ in dealing with women (Cyrene in Pind. Pyth. 9), and prematurely truncated affairs with boys (Hyacinthus, Cyparissus)55 reflect the ambiguity of his own status as a perpetual youth among the gods, not fully initiated into adulthood himself and thus unable to initiate other youths or to marry. I suspect the same pattern may underlie the god’s rather unusual relation- ship with Admetus. No ephebe, Admetus is already a king who has participated in heroic quests like the Calydonian boar hunt and the Argonautic expedition. On the one hand, Apollo helps Admetus win his wife (marriage representing final integration into adult responsibilities) by giving him the chariot yoked to the boar and lion, parallel to Poseidon’s assistance of his former eromenos Pelops. But the marriage is troubled from the very first night, its consummation hin- dered by the bridal chamber full of snakes (courtesy of Artemis, Apollo’s fem- inine double); the chthonian character of snakes is familiar, so this motif may Apollo at some point metamorphose into a swan, either to abduct the boy or rescue him from the wind god’s pursuit. 53See LIMC 5.1: 549, nos. 41–47. 54Hubbard 2008. 55Cyparissus has long been assumed to be hellenistic (see, e.g., Bo ̈mer 1969–1986: 5.53), since Ov.Met. 10.106–142 is our earliest extant literary source and all the artistic representations are of the Roman imperial era: see LIMC 6.1: 155–156. However, D’Alessio (2000: 255–256) reconstructs the name Cyparissus in a papyrus fragment of Pindar, although he doubts whether this figure should be identified with the one Ovid mentions. On the other hand, Cyparissus’ identification with the otherwise minor island of Ceos does make one wonder whether he might have owed his literary debut to a lost poem of Simonides or Bacchylides. Apollo did have an important cult presence on Ceos, but a cult of Apollo Cyparissus is also attested on Cos (see Bo ̈mer 1969–1986: 5.49), which might point to poetic diffusion by Philetas or his disciples. </page> <page sequence="22"> 102 PHOENIX be an adumbration of impending death for at least one of the newlyweds.56 Apollo’s affection for Admetus continues even after Admetus’ marriage, and Apollo offers to make him immortal,57 even as Zeus did Ganymede (see Pind. Ol. 10.102–105). But this reward comes at the price of Admetus finding another human willing to die in his stead, and of course Alcestis is the only one devoted enough to do so. So immortal life with Apollo is possible only with the death of Admetus’ mortal wife.58 But Apollo’s plan is foiled when Heracles (who Plutarch tells us was also a former lover of Admetus) brings Alcestis back to him, granting Admetus a more lasting and secure marriage than the one Apollo had initially delivered. The tension between Heracles and Apollo goes back to the myth of their struggle over the Delphic tripod.59 In the present story, they share the attribute of having been condemned to humiliating service to a master of lower status than themselves. The distinction between Heracles and Apollo as rival former lovers is between the lover who matures into a bearded super-hero and is willing to let his former beloved mature into a married man, and the perpetually young, never-bearded god who can never quite move beyond his attachment to the beloved, first helping him marry but then undermining the gift by effectively taking it back. If my interpretation of this myth is correct, it must be seen within the frame- work of the other myths about Apollo’s troubled and largely unsuccessful ro- mances. While its pre-hellenistic provenance cannot be proven beyond reason- able doubt, the story’s narrative coherence in these terms is so compelling that one suspects an earlier genesis. Also suggestive are its close narrative and ge- ographical connection with the story of Apollo’s unsuccessful love for Coronis 56So Weber (1936: 118–119), following Wilamowitz (1886: 69 n. 47 and 71–72). I am less persuaded by their equation of Artemis with the local Thessalian goddess Brimo. Lesky (1925: 11–42) surveys the folktale parallels to the Alcestis-myth and shows that Death frequently announces himself on the day of the wedding. 57Exactly how long Admetus is to be exempted from death is not made clear in our extant sources, but I suspect that it was originally some form of immortality that Apollo sought, parallel to the act of Asclepius that began the myth. Dicaearchus’ hypothesis to Euripides’ Alcestis says that Admetus will be allowed to “live a time equal to what he has lived already” ( ̈na æson t ̃ protr~ xr—non z}s_), but this formulation does not surface within the play: Apollo merely says that he has interceded with the Fates so that Admetus can “avoid immediate death” (*Aidhn t ̃n paraut’k&amp; \kfuge”n, Eur. Alc. 13). 58 It becomes a matter of major emphasis in Euripides’ Alcestis that she exacts from Admetus the promise that he will never remarry (Eur. Alc. 299–335). 59For the antiquity of this story and its possible association with the First Sacred War or the establishment of the Delphic amphictyony, see Defradas 1954: 123–146 and Parke and Boardman 1957: 276–278, 281–282. Cicero (Nat. D. 3.16) says this was a different, more ancient Heracles than the familiar hero. Iconographic evidence, including most prominently the Siphnian Treasury at Delphi itself, is certainly widespread by the sixth century (see LIMC 2.1: 304–308, nos. 1009–40 and the list of von Bothmer 1977), and may even be as early as ca 720 b.c., depending on the interpretation of a bronze tripod leg from Olympia (Olympia B1730 = LIMC 2.1: 306, no. 1011); in favor of its association with the struggle of Apollo and Heracles, see Parke and Boardman 1957: 278–81. </page> <page sequence="23"> THE PROBLEM OF PEDERASTIC HIERARCHY 103 and its parallelism with the story of Hermes’ tending the flocks of Dryops out of love, both of which are well-attested as archaic. Bacchylides 3.76–84 and the other evidence for an archaic tradition of Apolline advice poetry to Admetus add another indication of the myth’s prominence. The late archaic topos of love as a form of slavery and the multiplication of stories about Apollo’s problematic love life during this period both point to late archaic or early classical origins of this myth’s eroticization. There is no question that the standard erastes/eromenos dichotomy oversim- plifies the complex relationship: in some respects Apollo is the figure of higher status (a god as opposed to a mortal, the gift-giver as opposed to the receiver), but in others Admetus is (a king as opposed to a vassal, a mature man who marries as opposed to an ephebic god who never ages and can never marry). Sergent is certainly wrong to suppose that Apollo must be classified as the eromenos and Admetus as the erastes. Greek gods may love, but they cannot be loved, only revered (cf. Aesch. Eum. 725: “Isn’t it just to benefit the man who is reverent?”).60 Any mortal who fancies loving a god is destined to suffer the fate of Ixion, deluded by a Cloud.61 However, Sergent’s misprision of the relationship attests its confusing ambiguity, mingling different forms of status superiority on each side. The myth simply makes no sense from the standpoint of theoretical categories and associations evolved by abstract thinkers in the late- fifth and early-fourth centuries, much less in derivative modern formulations. If this myth received an erotic character in the work of poets as recent as Pindar and Praxilla, it suggests that the erotic taxonomies of Phaedrus and Pausanias are very localized and era-specific, if valid at all. conclusions If I am correct in assuming a familiar tradition of “Admetus songs” predicated upon a pederastic and pedagogical relationship between Apollo and the young king Admetus, these songs and the traditional wisdom they embody would have been familiar to Plato. If so, an added dimension of irony looms over Phaedrus’ speech. In presuming to extol pederastic love, Phaedrus balks at mentioning the more obvious example within Admetus’ myth, instead swerving aside to the less apt and rather puzzling example of Admetus’ wife. Could it be because the conceptual categories of erastes and eromenos were so confused with regard to the ephebic Apollo’s service to King Admetus? But even when avoiding this troublesome myth, Phaedrus falls into equal confusion with the examples of Admetus and Alcestis, or Achilles and Patroclus. Rather than successfully 60Xenophon’s Hieron 1.32–38 expresses the same paradox: the tyrant may love, but can never truly be loved in return, because he must be feared. Love that is yielded on the basis of fear can never be true love. 61Pind. Pyth. 2.21–48 relates Ixion’s attempted seduction of Hera and his punishment on the flaming wheel in Tartarus. </page> <page sequence="24"> 104 PHOENIX expounding a sophistic epideixis based on mythology, Phaedrus encounters the irreducible “queerness” of a mythology that proves stubbornly resistant to the neat little boxes of his own conceptual architecture, which has been adopted uncritically by many modern readers.
