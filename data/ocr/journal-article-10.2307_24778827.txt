<plain_text><page sequence="1">"£/« principe d'insuffisance Dickey's Dialogue with Bataille HEINZ TSCHACHLER In James Dickey's novel, Deliverance (1970), two very different forms of and attitudes toward a return to nature are explored. Lewis Medlock, who is convinced "that the whole thing is going to be reduced to the human body, once and for all. I want to be ready," bases his primitivism on the reasonable hope of averting the imminent collapse of a civilized world; the return to nature of Ed Gentry, the first-person narrator of the novel, takes the form of that very collapse itself: in the course of events, Ed becomes "some kind of an animal.. .quiet and deadly.. .a snake" ( 149). Not that this would make any difference in the consequences of their development. Both Lewis and Ed shoot to kill a human being. Dickey himself can be quoted as saying that it had been his express intention to show "how decent men kill" as well as to make the reader feel that "Deliverance is something that could happen" (Ashley 79, 80). If the novel is, to borrow a phrase from a contem poraneous song by the "Rolling Stones," the author's plea for "sympathy for the devil," the variety of responses the novel has elicited also indicates that, again in the words of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, "what's puzzling you is the nature of my game."1 Much of the puzzlement, I would argue, stems from a tendency either to ignore entirely or to pass over the import of the novel's epigraphs, and particularly the second which is taken from the writings of the French philosopher Georges Bataille: "// existe à base de la vie humaine un principe d'insuffisance." I am of course aware that certain editions of Deliverance for some reason do not contain Mosaic 20/3 0027/1276-87/010081-13 $01.50 © Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">82 Heinz Tschachler this epigraph, but even critics who attend to it do so in a casual way. Thus Rosemary Sullivan, for example, renders Bataille's "principe d'insuffisance" as a "fundamental boredom, the cause of which is normality," seeing it, in other words, as a psychological reaction to a cultural situation of ennui (8; cf. Schechter9; Samuels 24). While the appeal to the decadence of contemporary civilization does have a great deal of plausibility, Dickey seems to have concerned himself with still another aspect of modernity. In an interview with William Heyen he remarks that "we are in the process of losing the cosmos. We dominate it, but in a sense we've lost it It's not just the ecology issue which is, surely, in my opinion the most important issue in our era It's the sense of being part of what Lovejoy called 'the great chain of being'" (139). Dickey's reference to Lovejoy's influential study of the intellectual history of the eighteenth century is no coincidence.2 It was with the Enlightenment that reason began to assume functions which up until then had been the domain of religion. The religious symbols spawned by the Enlightenment, however, lacked the power to elicit emotional response; the sacred became profane. History replaced theology as the key discourse so that man could no longer look to a sacred symbol (such as the "great chain of being," once that Platonic concept had filtered into Christian dogma) as a stabilizing and organizing principle. This is what Dickey means by "losing the cosmos": the loss of cohesion around a point of fixity which allows thought and vision to transfix time—a process that began with the Enlightenment. What concerns us in reading Deliverance is, therefore, less the question of too much or too little violence (or of any other form of the "irrational") than the question of the religious sanctioning of violence. As long as we interpret Deliverance as Dickey's apologia for a proto-fascist philosophy of power and violence (Jameson 181), the implication remains that the violence expressed in the novel is nothing but "une excroissance ...qu 'il est facile à volonté d'annihiler" (Bataille, L'Erotisme 204), a temporary lapse into animal behavior. Yet the violation of a taboo has always been understood as an act of transgression that opens the door to the sacred or that which lies beyond the boundaries of quotidian reality. The transgression complements the profane world of work, extending the latter's boundaries but not destroying them, since the taboo is merely aufgehoben, suspended but not suppressed: "La transgression excède sans le détruire un monde profane, dont elle est le complément" (L'Erotisme 75). Thus, my thesis here is that reading Dickey's Deliverance in the context of the writings of Bataille elucidates the novel's thematic concern with the resacraliza tion of the world for the reader, much as reading Bataille must have contributed toward Dickey's own understanding of the matter. We might begin by stating that neither Bataille's "principe d'insuffisance" nor Dickey's use of it has much to do with an individual's experience of a "funda mental boredom." Both writers are concerned with the dilemma of modern man vis à vis an absolute reality which seems to have been lost, "transvalued" in Nietzsche's terms. This becomes clear if we discuss the Bataille epigraph in its context: "// existe à la base de la vie humaine, un principe d'insuffisance. Isolément, chaque homme imagine les autres incapables ou indignes d'être. Une</page><page sequence="3">Dickey and Bataille 83 conversation libre, médisante, exprime une certitude de la vanité de mes semblables; un bavardage apparement mesquin laisse voir une aveugle tension de la vie vers un sommet indéfinissable" (Oeuvres 5:97). With Bataille, the "principe d'insuffisance" is the human condition: being cut off from one's fellow human beings as well as from the world, the individual has no means of assurance of his/her existence ("suffisance") in the world of work; in view of this "insuffisancethis sense of being divided against oneself, there seems to be no other alternative than "d'y répondre en introduisant dans ma nuit la suffisance divine" (Oeuvres 5:98). In an earlier articulation of this issue, Bataille had explained how this "divine sufficiency" could be reached: "LES HOMMES AGISSENT POUR ETRE. Ce qui ne doit pas être compris dans le sens négatif de la conservation (afin de ne pas être rejeté hors de l'existence par la mort) mais dans le sens positif d'un combat tragique et incessant pour une satisfaction presque hors d'atteinte" (Oeuvres 1:433). Human beings act in order to be, but with no possibility of being able to make even the "leap of faith" to Kierkegaard's God, each such act is an act of transgression, a combat. As Bataille sees it, it is "la nécessité d'engager une lutte non plus avec un ensemble égal mais avec le néant" (1:441) which makes the combat "tragic and incessant." This is an existentialist view of a world in which there are no ultimate certainties: existent individuals create themselves by a series of free actions, thereby asserting the validity of their private systems of values in the face of traditional moralities. In view of nothingness ("le néant") even a most violent relation between the self and the world can no longer be considered simply a crime against the common good; common morality is all but suspended by nothingness. Face to face with the nausea of nothingness, the discontinuous self can find at best a momentary and illusory sense of meaning and stability. Even this little solace, Bataille argues, requires the courage to dance on the edge and to assert the creative power of life in the very moment of acknowledging its nothingness. For Bataille, existence acquires significance only through an act of self-questioning, the most extreme form of which puts the self on the threshold of death. Further, since he sees the most intense form of relationship as an erotic one, Bataille can formulate such a seeming paradox as the following: "L'Erotisme est l'approbation de la vie jusque dans la mort" (L'Erotisme 29). Through sensuality, the threshold is pushed toward its extreme; this is what makes sensuality, as it were, sacred. At the intensely erotic moment of the expenditure of the self the "discontinuity" of the self is "mise en question." With discontinuity approaching its opposite, continuity, the self approaches that which transcends the self. There is, however, no way that the threshold can be eradicated, since the fact remains that discontinuity is the conditio sine qua non of human existence. Thus the "principe d'insuffisance" discloses a nostalgia of the discontinuous self for cosmic continuity—for the de-alienation of self and cosmos. Continuity, Bataille believes, can be reached only through an act of transgression, a violation of a taboo which liberates the self from the world of reason and work and opens the door to a world of the "wholly other," the world of excess in which there is, finally, "sovereignty." What is at stake here is not the moral insufficiency of human beings</page><page sequence="4">84 Heinz Tschachler but the insufficiency of human morality. We must not infer from this, however, that Bataille would subscribe to the maxim of homo homini lupus. We need, after all, to keep in mind that the transgression of a taboo is never the same as its suppression, and that the human being is always called upon to become aware of himself, "de parvenir à la 'conscience de soi' et de bien savoir, afin de limiter des effets ruineux, à quoi elle aspire 'souverainement': de disposer s'il lui convient de ces effets, mais de ne plus les reproduire au delà de ce qu'elle veut, et de s'y opposer résolument dans la mésure où elle ne peut le supporter" (L'Erotisme 205). Concern with self-awareness touches upon the personal unconscious. In a discussion of the religious aspects of primitivism in Deliverance, Evelyn J. Hinz argues that the only way the contemporary writer has of convincingly representing the resacralization of the world (in other words, the reversal of the split of the self and cosmos) is through the experience of the collective unconscious. There, in his unconscious self, the hero finds the "prototypical" relation to nature which would validate the new "autotypic" culture (161-64). It is this variation on the theme of primitivism which makes the topos of the "Know Thyself' so pertinent to a reading of Deliverance. Ed Gentry, Dickey says in an interview, has "done it once and that's all he needs to do it. That's all he needs to know, that he's capable of it" (Heyen 145). In Ed Gentry's development there is the taboo as well as the transgression. Similarly, we have seen just how important thematically the taboo and its transgression are for Bataille. By adopting a critical standpoint which allows Bataille and Dickey to enter, as it were, into a dialogue, I aim to disprove the allegation that for Dickey violence is merely a given, with its manifestations in the novel being merely an expression of "mindlessness" (DeMott 38). I also hope to show how an American writer—whose novel has been repeatedly decoded in terms which are specifically American, that is to say vis à vis the "Adamic myth" of the trial and subsequent apotheosis of the young innocent described by R.W.B. Lewis (Armour)3—reacted to European thought in an obvious and sensitive way, absorbing and reshaping impulses from the Old World. * * * In explaining the popular appeal of Deliverance, Dickey observed that he "wrote the right book at the right time.... People were caught up in a savage fable of decent men fighting for their lives and killing and getting away with it" (Ashley 60). What the author wants us to see in the novel is that in view of "the mysteriousness or the mystery of existence [which] is both magical and terrifying and violent rather than reposeful (Night Hurdling 226), the "veneer of civilization" can at best be a kind of "patina" (Arnett 287). The suspense of the civilized code reveals the barbarism that always lurks behind the Utopia of the state of nature. Thus the novel owes its disturbing effect to the revelation that what we generally believe to be benign and peaceable is truly terrifying. It is precisely because the "veneer of civilization" (the term is Sartre's) is so thin and precarious that, Dickey argues, there is no other choice but to come to terms with what terrifies us most. And what terrifies us most, the "ultimate horror" (the Sartrean nausée?) which Ed Gentry</page><page sequence="5">Dickey and Bataille 85 faces when he has killed the mountain man (171), is deep inside us. As Bataille says, "ce qui, le plus violemment, nous révolte, est en nous" (L'Erotisme 217). Early in the protagonists' adventure on the river, Ed becomes aware of the existence of certain inexplicable and extra-personal forces: "It's got me," [Ed] said. "What's got you?" "It." A slow force took hold of us the complicated urgency of the current... the feeling I always had at the moment of losing consciousness at night, going toward something unknown that I could not avoid (65-66) The "something unknown" Ed refers to is later symbolically expressed through the image of the liberated beast. "I got on my back and poured with the river," Ed comments on the events following their shipwreck, "sliding over the stones like a creature I had always contained but never released." At this point in the course of events, Ed's actions are already beyond rational control: "I felt myself fading out into the unbelievable violence and brutality of the river, joining it" (124). Dickey's use of an anthropomorphic metaphor suggests that the "It" which has overpowered him symbolizes that which Western civilization has always tried to suppress in the name of reason—naturé, bodily nature and external nature. Ed Gentry's orgiastic celebration of nature—"Being alive in the dark and doing what I was doing was like a powerful drunkenness, because I didn't believe it. There had never been anything in my life remotely like it" (157)—is the symbolic reintegration of those parts of his self that had long been denied. What we observe in Ed's ecstatic risking of his life is the expenditure of the self in its total indifference toward death, an "indifference not only to the other man's body scrambling and kicking on the ground with an arrow through it, but also to mine" (154). The (ultimately romantic) principium individuationis has been suspended, "discontinuity" giving way to "continuity." This dance on the edge is an ambiguous achievement, as both Dickey and Bataille are well aware: "Les hommes peuvent retrouver par la perte le mouvement libre de l'univers, ils peuvent danser et tournoyer avec une ivresse aussi délivrante que celle des grands essaims d'étoiles, mais, dans la dépense violente qu'ils font ainsi d'eux-mêmes, ils sont contraints d'apercévoir qu'ils respirent dans le pouvoir de la mort" (Oeuvres 1:520). The power of death begins to exert itself on the threshold to continuity, which is, ultimately, death; the split between the self and cosmos cannot be healed, "discontinuity" being the condition of our existence. The dialectic of the taboo and its transgression will remain without synthesis forever. Ed Gentry "held madly to the human" (151) only sub specie continuitatis, that is to say, sub specie mortis. The climactic situation "at a place where staying on the wall and falling down canceled each other out in [Ed's] body" (150) is one on the threshold between discontinuity and continuity. The balance inherent in such a situation is one which is essentially tragic, as Hölderlin told us. The</page><page sequence="6">86 Heinz Tschachler destructive power Ed unleashes through his act of transgression is, then, the direct result of the impossibility of reaching synthesis. Forcing his way to awareness of self, Ed opens himself to the terror of nature. The moment of his vision of absolute power is also the moment of "the ultimate horror": "Anything... you can do what you want to do; nothing is too terrible. I can cut off the genitals he was going to use on me. Or I can cut off his head, looking straight into his open eyes. Or I can eat him. I can do anything I have a wish to do" (170). Awareness of self and fear are equally prerequisite for ecstatic experience because unless the taboo is observed with fear it lacks the counterpoise of desire which provides its deepest significance. "L'interdit observé autrement que dans l'effroi n'a plus la contrepartie de désir qui en est le sens profond," Bataille reminds us in L'Erotisme (42). Ed's development is far from a nostalgic return to a benign nature. It is, rather, an act of transgression, a sin. As such it is incompatible with any form of a back-to-nature movement: "la transgression diffère du 'rétour à la nature': 'elle lève l'interdit sans le supprimer'" (L'Erotisme 41). The taboo, Bataille says, cannot be destroyed since, being sacred, it was never imposed from the outside in the first place. If the taboo were based on reason, violence would be condemnable and we would have a choice of either obeying the taboo and doing everything to rid the earth of violence or else to keep transgressing and interpret the taboo as a put-on. While the world of work and reason may well be one that is founded on reason, it does not follow from this that the taboo itself be based on reason. If the opposition to violence did not itself draw upon violence in some way, Bataille argues, if some violent emotion did not make violence horrible for us, reason alone would not be able to define the limits authoritatively enough: "L'horreur, l'effroi irraisonnées pouvaient seuls subsister en face de déchaînements démesurés" (L'Erotisme 11). Thus, behind Ed's statement, "I held madly to the human," there is "une sensibilité non moins grande à l'angoisse fondant l'interdit, qu'au désir menant à l'enfreindre" (L'Erotisme 43). Given the premise that the taboo is not reasonable, a utilitarian morality (one which should consider it child's play to subjugate nature to reason so as to eradicate war and violence once and for all) finds its counterpart in the complementarity of civilization and barbarism, the dialectic of periods of productive labor and periods of the tumultuous unleashing of the reserves accumulated during periods of labor. His theory being essentially economic, Bataille sees in the period of festivity a possibility for the extravagant squandering which becomes a necessity as each system reaches a point when its reserves can no longer be used for an increase in production (La part maudite 67-96). That a theory of expenditure ("dépense") is anathema to Marxist thought is therefore not surprising: there is no place for the future in festivity, the "not yet" that has been the final cause for the subjugation of nature so often. Viewed in the context of social theory, "nature" is no longer the intractable raw material as the ideologues of progress would have it; instead, nature is an integral part of the social process itself. This is, after all, why Dickey can say that it is "useless to deny it.. .you do feel it" (Self-Interviews 137, 138).</page><page sequence="7">Dickey and Bataille 87 It was Hölderlin who, in his Hyperion, called feast days the Versöhnungszeit der Welt, the time of reconciliation between self and cosmos. The very word "feast," however, points toward transgression. There is no longer any direct reconciliation of self and cosmos except for the one which takes place in a time out, when human beings are beyond themselves. We cannot effectively change the otherness of nature but we can communicate with that otherness by becoming "other" to ourselves. This of course is possible only when reason and the principium individuations are suspended. It is only then that we become aware of the truth that nature is neither rational nor irrational but is, instead, beyond reason altogether. Nature is, then, no longer the "condition fondamentale.. .de l'activité productive" {La part maudite 33)—no longer a mere concession or alternative to work which is ultimately supportive of it. Nature, being beyond reason, must needs be squandered extravagantly at feast times, "lost" as it were in such unproductive expenditures as luxury, mourning, cults, sacrifices, war, games, spectacles, arts, erotic activities, orgies —activities which have no end beyond themselves. The emancipation of human beings lies, if we are to follow Bataille, in the revolt of human nature. "Nature" needs to become "historical." This would be the radical (albeit logical) conclusion to the Enlightenment, one which would carry the torch of reason beyond reason itself toward the kind of excess which comes with the revolt of nature. This, the "revolt of nature," is clearly a theme pertinent to Deliverance. Ed Gentry, as we have seen, has no control over the "something" that is getting hold of him. Finally, he goes down on "all four with [his] head down like a dog.. .smelling for blood like an animal" (168, 169). Copulating with the rock and soiling himself, Ed becomes an outsider to himself, losing himself: "I simply lay in nature, my pants' legs warm and sopping in my juices" (145). His being beyond-himself is the result of an act of transgression. As a consequence of the dialectic of taboo and transgression, however, the ecstatic moment of loss of self is also the moment of the "ultimate horror" (170). In Ed's primitivistic regression, nature is unleashed in a frenzy which is in turn followed by fear of the imminent annihilation of self. The ensuing plunge into the river is the symbol of Ed's rebirth from a moral vacuum. It also marks the interruption of the sacred, and the hero's eventual return to the profane: The rope broke.. .and then I felt the current thread through me, first through my head from one ear and out the other and then complicatedly through my body, up my rectum and out my mouth and also in at the side where I was hurt... .Uncon sciousness went through me. I was in a room of varying shades of green beautifully graduated from light to dark, and I went toward the palest color, though it seemed that this was to one side of me rather than above. An instant before I broke water I saw the sun, liquid and transformed, and then it exploded in my face. (176) The price Ed pays for his rebirth lies in some form of domination of (his) nature by reason. The much-discussed image of the "river within" contains the notion of the sublimation of his procreative energies, their disciplining into acts of moderate</page><page sequence="8">88 Heinz Tschachler excess: "The river and everything I remember about it became a possession to me... .Now it ran nowhere but in my head, but there it ran as though immortally. I could feel it—I can feel it—on different places on my body.... The river underlies, in one way or another, everything I do" (233). Dickey's resolution is intellectual to the point that it evokes the triumph over the "animal in us" that Thoreau talks about in Waiden. It is, as Michael Glenday suggests, "the triumph and continuation of civilized values the primacy of an artistic intelligence... rooted in logic, design and harmony... the ascendancy of an ordering aesthetic principle" (150). Transgression is followed by observance, delimitation by limitation, always turning that which is "out there" into a new "in here." This is the nexus Horkheimer and Adorno recognize as the historical law they called the "dialectic of enlightenment": "Enlightenment is mythic fear turned radical" (18). It is perhaps interesting to note here that Dickey, the man who is so fond of presenting himself in the pose of the great American hunter, also remembers "walled gardens," which he loves "more than any other constructions of man" (Night Hurdling 24). The reintegration of Ed Gentry into society is complete only "when the dam at Aintry was completed" (233). The pun discloses that there is no more "entry" ("Aintry") into nature. The dam symbolizes the shutting out by the self of a nature which has become a threat. It is no coincidence that the first reference to the dam is Lewis's: "The dam at Aintry has already been started, and when it's finished next spring the river will back up fast" (7). The notion of defense against a potential threat is repeated when Ed is defending his rational self; again, Lewis is brought in: "But as Lewis would say," Ed comments, "Control, baby. It can be controlled" (193). It seems that the eventual domination of nature by Ed can be fully understood only in conjunction with Lewis's relation to nature. Lewis Medlock reveals the kind of cosmic alienation we have observed in Ed. "If everything wasn't dead," he tells Gentry, "you could make a kind of life that wasn't out of touch with everything" (42). The tone here is one of profound cultural pessimism: "Life is so fucked-up now, and so complicated, that I wouldn't mind if it came down, right quick, to the bare survival of who was ready to survive" (41). Lewis, however, will never become fully alive, not even through excess, as his apocalyptic consciousness is geared exclusively to the future, "always leaving, always going somewhere, always doing something else" (9). His homelessness indeed makes him a latter-day Huck Finn, lighting out for the territory ahead. The territory, for Lewis, lies in the metaphysical realm of time transcended: Lewis wanted to be immortal. He had everything that life could give, and he couldn't make it work. And he couldn't bear to give it up or see age take it away from him, either, because in the meantime he might be able to find what it was he wanted, the thing that must be there, and that must be subject to the will. He was the kind of man who tries by any means—weight lifting, diet, exercise, self-help manuals from taxidermy to modern art—to hold on to his body and mind and improve them, to rise above time. (12) Transcendence of the self, for Lewis, means the absolute power of the will over the body. The obscene contrast between "Lewis' huge pumped-up bicep shoving</page><page sequence="9">Dickey and Bataille 89 out its veins in the sun" and "the old man's spotted hands trembling like he was deliberately doing so" (51) reveals only the "humiliation of the flesh by the ruling power" (Horkheimer and Adorno 232). The very ugliness and cruelty of the men from the "country of the nine-fingered people" (52) become the ideological reflection of the suppression to which they were themselves subject. Conversely, Lewis's relation to nature shows merely the "irrationality and injustice of rule as cruelty which is as far removed from the relationship of insight and happy reflection as the practice of cruelty is from freedom" (Horkheimer and Adorno 232). The accident Lewis had before the story proper begins points toward the possibility of such a relationship of insight and happy reflection: "It's luxury. For a while I don't have to lift weights, or work out on the bag" (12). At the pastoral moment of enforced repose in the hospital room Lewis's body-nature is out of reach of the domination by the will. For the reader, this moment signifies a critique of this relationship of power which Horkheimer and Adorno have phrased as follows: "Culture defines the body as a thing which can be possessed; in culture a distinction is made between the body and the spirit, the concept of power and command, as the object, the dead thing, the corpus" (232). The cultural critique by Horkheimer and Adorno is pertinent here to the extent that Lewis is himself a child of the Enlightenment, as Ed's question reveals: "What's the life like up there now?... I mean, before you take to the mountains and set up the Kingdom of Sensibility?" (43). Lewis's concern for the body is the triumph of the will; it does not denounce injustice as it is but glorifies injustice as it was. Lewis's one-dimensional cult of the body—"I just believe... that the whole thing is going to be reduced to the human body, once and for all" (40)—is a mere "ornament of mass culture which cannot do without noble gestures"; ultimately, the "body cannot be remade into a noble object: it remains the corpse however vigorously it is trained and kept fit." In view of the sinister vision the dialectic of Enlightenment provides, not even the obviously ironic reference to Lewis as Tarzan (90) can remove our suspicions of what Lewis might just stand for, "the new, great, beautiful and noble type of man—the Führer and his storm troopers" (Horkheimer and Adorno 233-34). After all, Lewis would be only too happy for everything to come down, "right quick, to the bare survival of who was ready to survive" (41): he would like his myth of survival to become a fact. Lewis appears to be only too eager to enact his confused fantasy of the Übermensch, the only man so strong that he can entrust himself completely to the creative impulse of the will to power and to the heroic life at the apex of an existence behind which there is nothingness. Even so, a novel about murder and sexual perversion is not the same thing as murder and sexual perversion. It is only when this difference becomes blurred that one falls into the trap set by that (pseudo-)Nietzschean brand of existentialist romanticism. Since Bataille appears to have changed his views of (organized) violence—as we have seen in our discussion of L'Erotisme above, and as his revaluation of the concept of "otherness" ("heterogeneity") indicates (see Libertson 669-98)—the question is, where does James Dickey, author, stand here? "We need consequentiality. We must have it; the sense of things and people</page><page sequence="10">90 Heinz Tschachler mattering to us. We must have it, even if we have to give to things and to people consequentiality by a brute act of will." These are not the words of Lewis Medlock, though they might well be his; these are the words with which Dickey addressed the University of Virginia class of 1973 upon their commencement {Night Hurdling 179). Dickey, as we all know of course, did not confound myth and reality. Someone else, however, did. And that very person is being referred to in Dickey's address, significantly titled "Upthrust and Its Men." Surely, the "leaping flame of creative and physical possibility, a philosophy of sun and steel that led into the wilderness and down the rivers" that Dickey refers to in his speech (180) pertains to Lewis Medlock. As the phrase "sun and steel" reveals, however, Dickey is really talking about the Japanese poet and novelist Yukio Mishima. This becomes even more obvious if we look at Dickey's essay on "Style and Chance," which is included in the same collection. There Dickey talks about his own "physicality," that how his body relates to things and people is how he relates to them, and that the writers he likes the most are those "who have something like the same approach to existence [such as] the Japanese novelist Yukio Mishima, who destroyed, by ritual suicide, the body on which he worked so hard and mystically for so many years." Dickey then goes on to tell how "Mishima speaks of his personal cult of 'Sun and Steel': the pitting of the body against an obstacle, like the lifting of a weight, a barbell: the cult of open air and physical strain" (Night Hurdling 172). Dickey's reference to Mishima is no historical coincidence. Having become a literary and political cult figure during the 1960s, Yukio Mishima died at the headquarters of the Japanese armed forces in November 1970, after an abortive coup d'état by his proto-fascist secret army which had been aimed toward the restoration of the old feudal order of Japan. In view of the utter failure of his ludicrous attempt, Mishima committed ritual suicide. His esthetics of violence recalls a public debate in America in the 1970s, of which Susan Sontag's formula of the "fascination of fascism" is but a dim reminder, and of which Francis Ford Coppola's film Apocalypse Now, released in 1979 after a four-year wait, was to become but the culminating point. In that film, the war in Vietnam appears as an esthetic feast reminiscent of a Leni Riefenstahl movie of the 1930s, with music from Wagner's Valkyries as a decorative backdrop. Today, America seems to be swept by a new wave of films which portray violence in essentially esthetic terms. We need not even talk about "Rambo" or "First Blood: Part I," or the "Exterminator." Instead, consider the import of a film by the American director Paul Schräder, which was first shown at the Cannes festival in May 1985. This film, co-produced by no lesser person than Coppola himself, portrays the life of (an unabashedly idolized) Yukio Mishima. James Dickey's admiration for Yukio Mishima should not come as a surprise, then. Having expressed similar attitudes in the figure of Lewis Medlock, Dickey's eventual discovery of Mishima served only to focus some of his own views. It is in this biographical context that the following statement from Dickey's Bacca laureate address of 1973 should be read: "In an odd way, I began to imitate Lewis, my own character, and tried to make of myself, at the age of fifty, a man of</page><page sequence="11">Dickey and Bataille 91 upthrust...of austerity and audacity, both intellectual and physical" (Night Hurdling 176). It is obvious that Lewis stands, and may well always have stood, for Dickey's own hopes of cultural renewal. For the Lewis of Deliverance, however, "No price is too big" (43), whereas for the author there might just be a cost which is, ultimately, too great. A passage from the Dialectic of Enlightenment will make sufficiently clear what is meant here: "Every attempt to break the natural thralldom, because nature is broken, enters all the more deeply into that natural enslavement. Hence the course of European civilization" (13). In Deliverance, Dickey has symbolically represented this "course" in the image of Lewis's broken leg: "It felt like a thing that was trying to open, to split, to let something out" (128). The passage very subtly reveals the possibility that the domination of nature by the will could once more change into the domination by nature, that the "human instincts and passions which are displaced and distorted by civilization" (Horkheimer and Adorno 231) will erupt in yet another "revolt of Nature," wherein the "underground" history will once more replace "written" history. If this sounds like a cautionary tale, a summary of its plot would run as follows: when all traditional bonds and obligations are destroyed (suspended), there will be a "vacuum" and, consequently, the individual will be the more prone to being sucked up by authoritarian ideologies. What Dickey has shown in Deliverance is, then, nothing less than the aporia of individual liberation, the contradictions of modern man who is, like Dickey himself, torn "between doing the thing of maximum physical pleasure and that of the maximum physical difficulty, toughness. How long can I hang between these two? For the rest of my life probably, or for as long as I hold out" (Sorties 64). Such contradictions (which are clearly contradictions within a particular class rather than between different classes) are reflected in the way Dickey handles the theme of violence on the level of characterization. There is an instrumental form of violence that is governed by the will. This is symbolized in the domination of nature by the will as it is embodied in the figure of Lewis. Conversely, there is that instinctual form of violence which is the result of the liberation of those forces so long suppressed by the will—it is a manifestation of the revolt of nature. The fact that Dickey very carefully balances one form of violence against the other points toward an artistic consciousness that can hardly be dismissed as the author's political ««conscious. Frederic Jameson's interpretation of Deliverance as a "political fable" (181), persuasive as it is, cannot fully do justice to the novel precisely because the allegation of "political wishfulfillment" implies that there is very little at stake beside the material interests of a ruling class.4 Both Lewis's weightlifting and Ed's artistic creativity (and probably even the killings) are acts of sublimation, the workings of "mythic fear turned radical," a fear of that which "may remain outside, because the mere idea of outsideness is the very source of fear" (Horkheimer and Adorno 16). There is a mythic fear informing the discourse of the narrative. Deliverance is, after all, Ed's story, which is being told so that the rigor of the rite de passage plot stands for a secondary rationalization on his part. Ed's ordering consciousness gives the account, over which his experiencing self would have had to remain silent, for, in the words of Bataille, "/a violence est</page><page sequence="12">92 Heinz Tschachler silencieux" (L'Erotisme 206). What does indeed help us understand Deliverance is Bataille's notion that "L'horreur, V effroi irraisonnées pouvaient seuls subsister en face de déchaînements démesurés" (L'Erotisme 71). Reading Dickey's Deliverance in the light of the writings of Georges Bataille has, I hope, reached to the depths that reasoned cognition alone cannot reach, denouncing the union of reason and domination as instrumental reason and recognizing the dialectic of fear and desire, of taboo and transgression in a realm beyond reason. Although Dickey is well aware of the fascination of violence, he does not take pleasure in it; but neither does he turn away in moral outrage. Instead, he is courageous enough to look the ultimate horror in the face.* NOTES 1/ For a summary of critical interpretations of Deliverance beyond those I will cite, see Calhoun and Hill 109-11. 2/ For a discussion of the eighteenth century as a touchstone for Dickey's concerns in Deliverance, see Hinz. 3/ Decoding Deliverance as an initiation story with suggestions of Twain's HitckFinn or Cooper's The Deerslayer, i.e. in terms which are essentially those of the nineteenth century, "delivers" some ironic results, though: after all, it can hardly be maintained that either one of the four middle-aged suburbanite protagonists is young and innocent.
