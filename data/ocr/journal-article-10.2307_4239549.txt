<plain_text><page sequence="1">JAMES BLISH AND NORMAN L. KNIGHT 199 David Ketterer Pantropy, Polyploidy, and Tectogenesis in the Fiction of James Blish and Norman L. Knight James Blish belongs with that relatively small but prominent group of SF writers- among them, Isaac Asimov, Gregory Benford, and Arthur C. Clarke -who actually received at least some advanced scientific training. The knowledge of biology that Blish gained while at Rutgers University is effectively exploited in much of his fiction. It is not surprising, then, that, in a series of 1951-52 articles entitled "Science in Science Fiction," he should begin with a discussion of "The Biological Story.' After remarking the comparative rareness of stories deriving their major ideas from biological areas (with the exception of stories concerned with- teratology, the study of monsters), Blish points in a note to Norman L. Knight's "Crisis in Utopia" as "a real genetic story:' He explains that this 1940 account of human beings adapted to life underwater as "Tritons" is "grounded in... tectogenesis, the direct, surgical manipulation of chromosones."2 He goes on to mention his own stories of adapted humanity, "Sunken Universe" and "Surface Tension," which are clearly indebted to Knight's example. Blish in- vented the term "pantiopy" for the adaptation process; but some years later the term "tectogenesis" is reintroduced in A Torrent of Faces (1967), the work on which Buish and Knight collaborated in a manner I will spell out in a subsequent digression. The world of the Tritons introduced in "Crisis in Utopia" becomes an important aspect of the world described in A Torrent of Faces. In between Blish's pantropy stories, which he collected as a sequence entitled The Seedling Stars (1957), and A Torrent of Faces, Blish published a novella called Titans' Daughter (1961) (an expanded version of the 1952 story "Beanstalk") about biologically adapted human giants. The process here involves polyploidy, or increasing the number of cell chromosones. Whatever the terminology, all these stories focus on what is more commonly referred to these days as "genetic engineering." The Seedling Stars is the most important of these works; indeed, it ranks just after A Case of Conscience among BUsh's greatest achievements. The four stories which make up The Seedling Stars were not written or published in the order in which they are collected. "Sunken Universe" by "Arthur Merlyn," which appeared in Super Science Stories in 1942, is the germinal seed: considerably revised and combined with its sequel, "Surface Tension" (originally published in the August 1952 issue of Galaxy Science Fiction), it became Book Three of The Seedling Stars (under the title "Surface Tension").3 "The Thing in the Attic" (a parallel story detailing adapted human life in the canopy of a great forest as opposed to adapted human life underwater), constitutes Book Two, and was originally published in IF Worlds of Science Fiction in 1954. "Seeding Program," the story which as Book One sets up the pantropy theme, first came out in Fantasy and Science Fiction in 1955 as "A Time to Survive." In the same year, "Watershed," the concluding Book Four, appeared under that same title in IF Worlds of Science Fiction. This process of composition repre- sents a clear instance of what is increasingly recognizable as Blish's pattern: one step forward, one step back, one re-establishing "as you were" disguised as a final leap. There is evidence that Blish considered alternative titles for his story sequence. The draft of a latter to his agent Harry Alshuler, dated August 3, 1953, includes his</page><page sequence="2">200 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 10 (1983) plans for a book called SEEDING PROGRAM: "All right by golly, here's the start of a book for you .... I'm glad to report, at least, that I got through with my Capt. Video stint today Ichurning out scripts for a television series], so beginning now I &gt;am working for you."4 As the actual title of Book One, "Seeding Program" focuses on the concluding revelation of that story in a way that prepares for the stories to come. Interestingly, it seems that Blish also considered "A Time to Survive," his earlier title for the Book One story, as a title for the book as a whole. This title runs across the top of most of the pages of the work's final typescript. That typescript also indicates that he considered entitling "Watershed" simply "Epilogue." Blish pushed the implications of his subject matter to their limits in the last-written introductory and concluding Books. It is appropriate, therefore, in discussing the novel5 to treat those two stories together. Likewise, it makes sense to combine the discussion of Books Two and Three. 1. Change and Truth in The Seedling Stars. "Seeding Program," like many works of SF, is written as a mystery story. There is consequently a considerable difference between describing the plot (which unfolds intricately in four sections) and actually stating what the piece is all about. Once all the revelations are in and the obfuscations dispensed with, it turns out to be about the competition between terraforming and pantropy as ways of making mankind at home on alien planets.6 (A third possibility, living under domes, is dismissed as unpopular and unprofitable.) An organization called the Great Earth Port Authority (modelled on the Port of New York Authority) has a stake in terraforming because of the money it can make from this expensive enterprise by way of concessions, tolls, etc. It is in the financial interests of the Authority to kill the cheaper option, pantropy, and with it, the Altered Men already produced. Some of these have escaped to Ganymede, the third moon of Jupiter.7 In response the Port Authority creates a new Altered Man named Donald Leverault Sweeney, the protagonist of this story, who is to be planted on Ganymede in order to somehow enforce the return of the fugitive Altered Men to Earth, or at least the return of a Dr Rullman, who may know the secret of converting "an Adapted Man back into a human being" (I:2:24).8 However, once on Ganymede and properly clued in (if we are to believe what Sweeney is told there), Sweeney's loyalties change. (In symbolic terms, his loyalty to Mickey-a change from "Mike" in the typescript -who drops him off on Ganymede, is exchanged for a loyalty to Michaela, or "Mike," who turns out to be his niece.) Consequently, he assists the Altered Men in their "seeding program" (they have prepared new generations of Altered Men to fit the environments of six selected planets) by staging a phoney rebellion and explosion to distract the attention of the Port Authority observers while the survival ship (containing the newly Adapted children) takes off. Explosive endings, it should be noted, are endemic in Blish's fiction. It will be apparent from this summary that the fundamental structural opposi- tion at work is that between appearance (or surface) and reality. The fundamental question is: Do appearances (surfaces) mask reality or do appearances mask further appearances? If the latter is true, then what we have to deal with is a matter of conflicts among appearances-or, to use a phrase that exploits the marvelous appropriateness of the title of Book Three, tensions between surfaces. Blish pays particular attention to the appearance of Ganymede. The first feature to be pointed out is the frozen sea, Neptune's Trident, which, in the context of the entire book, might be viewed as anticipating the environment of "Surface Tension." Attention is also drawn to a feature which curiously parallels the shape of the Trident, "a great triangular marking called the Gouge, a torn up, root-entwined, avalanche-shaken valley which continues right around the pole and back up I i.e., in a</page><page sequence="3">JAMES BLISH AND NORMAN L. KNIGHT 201 southerly directionI into the other hemisphere, fanning out as it goes" (1: 1:4). (As part of a general procedure of reversing our normal points of reference, it is explained that to space pilots and astronomers north is down.) The Adapted Men live on a shelf that overhangs "this enormous scar." The shelf juts out from the base of an isolated mountain which, in the sunrise, displays a "star-fire peak" (1:1:5). By way of anthropomorphism and the pathetic fallacy, it would seem that the appearance of Ganymede mirrors something of the reality of the Altered Men. While the geograph- ical features suggest something of both the deforming surgery that the Adapted Men have undergone and their resulting isolation and apartness, the "star-fire peak" suggests the aspiration that has led to this situation. As an Adapted Man whose "bones were Ice IV" (1: 1:8), Sweeney can empathize with the frozen sea. Mention is also made of "the gouge which was Sweeney's frigid tangled substitute for a human soul" (1:2:25). Something of the same metaphysical mix is conveyed by the effect on him of an acute question: "His veering attention snapped back into the frigid center of his being so suddenly that it left behind a bright weal, as if a lash had been laid across his exposed brain" (1:2:29). In fact, the reader's sense of Sweeney depends almost entirely on a sense of his congruence with the environment of Ganymede. We are not provided with any direct physical description of the man. A wind, previously "as gentle and variable as a flautist's breath" (1:2:19), takes to hooting lilke an owl as "[t]he congruent furies of the storms inside and outside Sweeney mounted together" (1:3:37). Clearly Blish's metamorphic images are designed to reflect the theme of fitting men to their environment. This symbolism, it should be emphasized, is applied with a very light touch. Blish is also at pains to present Ganymede as a real place, and he achieves a considerable degree of credibility by offhand comparisons to "Syrtis Major on Mars" (1:1:4) and "the Moon's Mare Crisium" (1:1:5). Blish makes extensive use of containers, suits, and screens, and these have an important bearing on his theme of appearance vs. reality. In the present context, the containing metaphor relates particularly to the alien environments into which man will be fitted. Unlike the suit of clothes which is selected, cut, and,adapted to fit the individual, here the individual is adapted to fit the suit of clothes. On his way to Ganymede, Sweeney is segregated in a "heavily insulated cabin" or "vault" (1: 1:3). We learn that previously he had been formed in a "great sealed cavern" (I:1:9) on the Moon, where, he tells Rullman, he was "a cell in a jug" (1:1:13). Rullman later confirms that the Adapted child is "the ultimate in bottle babies" (1:3:46). All these containers are imprisoning, isolating vaults from which the Adapted Man must free himself in order to live in whatever alien context he has been fashioned for. There are two other containing alien contexts outside the bottle which figure in this first story, contexts from which the Adapted Man is forever excluded. One is the world of contemporary normal human beings, whether on the Moon or on Earth. The other is the wider temporal context implied by the presence of an omniscient narrator and, in particular, by this reference to Sweeney's trek across the surface of Ganymede: "It took him eleven days and efforts and privations of which Jack London would have made a whole novel" (1:3:35). This kind of statement can be risky in SF. It makes the narrator obtrusive and may sound anachronistic. In this case, however, the reference does have the advantage of placing the reader within a context which may be related to the three other contexts - Sweeney's contained world, the contemporary human environment, and Ganymede - with which the story is more directly concerned. The above formulation quickly makes apparent the likely thematic configura- tion of The Seedling Stars. It concerns itself with views that are limited because they are contained, and with the need to break out of such containers. These, after all, are the logical possibilities- and characteristically Blish's plots depend upon logic. The</page><page sequence="4">202 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 10 (1983) references to a "chain reaction" of explosions (1:3:37) and the process whereby pantropy will spread throughout the universe as "One, two, three, infinity" (I:3:48)9 might, in fact, be taken as images of Blish's logical way with plotting. There is a logical corollary to the concern with breaking out of containers which should be mentioned now although it will figure in this analysis only later. As likely as not, the notion of birth will present itself as an image for the process of mental breakthrough. And likely as -not, birth will be viewed as a compensation for, or means of surmounting, death. Sweeney learns that as "a Jay-positive blood type" (1:2:31) he would be cancer-prone if he were an Earth-normal man.'0 At the beginning of the story, Sweeney is in a state such that, were it not for his pulse, "he might ... have concluded that he was dead" (L:1:3). Although the relationship between the Altered Men and other human beings is problematical in "Seeding Program," there is no real doubt that the Altered Men are human beings- and this in spite of the syntactic denial implicit in such references as Sweeney's to the possibility of converting "an Adapted Man back into a human being" (1:2:24) and in spite of the meaning of the word "pantropy" itself: "changing everything" (:1:8). If everything is changed or can be changed, then in what real sense is an Altered Man a human being? That question in effect occupies the concluding Book, "Watershed," where the notion of pantropy as total, ceaseless change comes up against the notion that there is an essential human nature which remains the same, an essential truth. "Watershed," we are given to understand, takes place many centuries after what was envisaged in "Seeding Program" has come to pass. What has also come to pass is the virtual destruction of the Earth. Human beings can no longer live there. The reference to how the Earth was despoiled-"the people began their lives as farmers with the use of fire, and they killed themselves off in the same way" (IV: 176)- serves to complete the pattern of linking each of the four Books allusively with one of the four elements. Book One, which takes place on the harsh surface of Ganymede (a world comparable with the cold rocky landscape of Earth in "Water- shed"), can be associated with earth, and the tree-top world of Book Two and the underwater world of Book Three with the elements of air and water, respectively. "Watershed" is about the prejudice harbored by the "human" crew of a military starship against the Adapted Men who are being transported to Earth. By a nice irony, the "human beings" cannot live on Earth in its present condition; only the seal-like Adapted Men, the Altarians, can do that. A further irony inheres in the fact that at this point in time, after countless generations of Adapted Men, it is legitimate to wonder if any "human beings" in their original form still exist. The ship, after all, is manned by a "Rigellian crew" (IV: 176). "Watershed" thus provides the perfect and inevitable logical conclusion for The Seedling Stars. Coming after "Surface Tension," with its division into "Cycle One" and "Cycle Two," "Watershed" might well be subtitled "Full Cycle." It success- fully introduces a new idea, yet one implicit in everything that comes before. Hocqueah, the Altarian in the story, relates the history of pantropy for the benefit of Captain Gorbel. He implies that pantropy, as a means of doing without artificial containers - spacesuits, domes, and man-made environments - provides direct access to reality, including the reality of a basic human equality. In apparent contradiction to the definition of pantropy in Book One ("everything changes"), this concluding story asserts that there is an essential truth, an essential human nature that remains the same. Presumably what Blish must have in mind is the human soul or something like it, something like the Ganymede gouge which "Seeding Program" mentions as Sweeney's "substitute for a human soul" (1:2:25). Does this mean that pantropy leads to yet another deceptive surface that has to be broken through? The implications of this surface/reality dilemma are more fully</page><page sequence="5">JAMES BLISH AND NORMAN L. KNIGHT 203 explored by Blish in A Case of Conscience (story, 1953: novel, 1958); and hence it is appropriate that the narrator of The Seedling Stars mentions Lithia, the alien world of A Case of Conscience, as an example of an alien race's familiarity with form- changing: "the dominant race undergoes complete evolutionary recapitulation after birth- not before it, as men do" (IV: 179). Indeed, similar allusions in Blish's other works indicate that he had the ambition of turning his works into a single tapestry, a loose but consistent historical universe. The present time, Hocqueah claims, "is the greatest of all moral watersheds for our race" (IV: 183). The evidence that only Adapted Men can now survive on Earth, the birth place of "true' human beings, will force the recognition of a basic equality. Will this "truth" in fact break through? The story ends with two humans, Gorbel and his navigator, looking at a "screen" "image' of an Earth they cannot inhabit. But a watershed is also a container, albeit a metaphorical one. At least, it may be supposed, the stage of recognizing the existence of a container has been reached, and that itself is a form of breakthrough. As ever, ultimate revelations are denied. 2. The Sexual Analogy in "The Thing in the Attic"' and "Surface Tension." There is a notable sexual analysis by Damon Knight of Blish's story "Common Time."" Whatever the appropriateness of such an approach to this story, the presence of some kind of sexual analogy is surely inevitable in a novel concerned with the placing of seeds. And, as it happens, "Common Time" appeared in 1953, in between the years in which "The Thing in the Attic" and "Surface Tension" were first published. It is in these two Seedling Stars stories that some kind of sexual analogy is most apparent. "The Thing in the Attic" is set on a planet named Tellura. Its animal-like inhabitants (they have muzzles, and we eventually learn that they are Adapted Men), live high above the ground in the canopy of a great forest and harbor all kinds of superstitions about the world below, which they call "Hell" and which contains at least one "chlorophyll-green snake" (11:1:64). They hold to a mythology involving giants who are responsible for their tree-top existence.'2 At the beginning of the story, a group of five "criminals," upon being convicted by their fellow tree-top dwellers of heresy regarding the Giants and the myth of origin as set down in the Book of Laws, are sentenced to a period of exile on the surface of the planet, to which they are lowered in a basket. This punishment effectively corresponds to a death sentence, since no previous visitor to the surface has survived. And, in fact, only two of these heretics - a couple named Honath and Mathild - do survive. At first, life on the surface (which in this story betokens reality rather than mere appearance) is every bit as alarming as anticipated. In a nice touch, the exiles are for a while afflicted with motionless sickness before they adapt to the fact that the ground does not constantly move like the tree tops. Then follows a long and complicated trek to reach higher ground, during which a monster is encountered and destroyed - but not before it has eaten one member of the group. If this monster is truly "the thing in the attic," why is it encountered in what figuratively must be viewed as the basement world on the surface? The answer seems to be that the monster's potency depends upon its existence in the attic world of the mind; in the basement world of reality the thing may be dealt with. Blish's tide, then, is an important clue to an overall allegorical intent. Eventually, in this "Jack and the Beanstalk" story in reverse, the Giants are encountered and turn out to be human beings from Earth. The two survivors learn of the seeding program which began thousands of years ago. Incidentally, it should be noted that, if Earth is now involved in the seeding program, then the ending of Book One does not fully set up the stories that follow. Are we to assume that some authority on Earth in the intervening centuries has come round to seeing the benefits of</page><page sequence="6">204 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 10 (1983) pantropy and that a seeding program similar to that described as taking place from Ganymede has been initiated? It is hard to know whether this is an instance of carelessness on Blish's part or an interesting complication for the careful reader to appreciate."3 Honath and Mathild also learn why the Tellura Adapted Men were first placed in the attic world. The world of the surface was simply too dangerous; but now, following the example of the new Adam and Eve, all their fellows must adapt to life on the surface. This explanation is hokey; and taking the allegorical hint which Blish has planted in his title, the reader is free to consider alternatives. To my mind, the story makes most sense if interpreted as an allegory of maturation, of man's need to leave the womb of security-which is nevertheless haunted by imaginary demons- and confront the monsters of reality. The tree-top world is a mental labyrinth. The monstrous reality to be met with, according to the story's dominating images, is that of sexuality. Phallic imagery predominates, intro- duced by the reference to "great pink cliffs" and "the intervening columns of blue air" (11:2:77), a nice inversion of the penetrable and the impenetrable. After "basalt pillars" the group encounter a second "chimney" cut in the cliffs: "The column of air inside the chimney was filled with spray" (11:3:92). An impressive ejaculation had been described a little earlier: "At the top of the falls, the water shot out from between the basalt pillars in a smooth, almost solid-looking tube, arching at least six feet before beginning to break into the fan of spray and rainbows which poured down into the gouge" (11:3:90). The story's geography, which I have not attempted to describe fully, is detailed and not always easy to follow; but that is appropriate because we are dealing here with a surrealistic psychic geography. All of this prepares for the reptilian monster and the Giant's rocket. Alaskon, the third surviving member of the group at that point, likens the doing away with the demonic "reptile" (1:3:88) to "spearing fish in a bromelaid" (11:3:91). This comment serves to link the reptile with the description of the phallic rocket: "a shining, finned spindle, like a gigantic minnow, pointing skyward in the. center of the rocky pla- teau...." (11:3:93). The phallus, of course, requires an egg to fertilize. It may be recalled at this point that the criminals were lowered to the surface world like eggs in a basket. Along the way, three surviving members of the group encounter and eat three reptile eggs. If, as seems to be the case, "The Thing in the Attic" is a story about achieved sexuality, we might expect to find it followed by a story dealing with conception. "Surface Tension" turns out to be that story. "Surface Tension" is the most popular of Blish's stories, a fact which caused him some puzzlement. Did he not realize that "Surface Tension" amounts to a classic embodiment of the model of conceptual breakthrough so central, both structurally and thematically, to the nature of SF? 14 "The Thing in the Attic," Blish's attempt to repeat the magic of "Surface Tension," has not met with the same success. According to Brian Stableford, the entrance of the human beings from Earth takes "the reader's viewpoint into the story" and consequently it lacks "the crucial moment of revela- tionfl"5 Nevertheless, as I have attempted to demonstrate, "The Thing in the Attic" does more than merely ape the moves of "Surface Tension"; it successfully sets the stage for it by developing a sexual analogy which culminates in "Surface Tension." In his Introduction to The Best of James Blish, Robert A.W. Lowndes main- tains that the explanatory Prologue to "Surface Tension" is "needlessly intrusive" and "is therefore omitted in the present edition."'6 As it happens, for reasons doubtless beyond Lowndes' control, the Prologue is printed in his edition; but that is just as well since this intrusion of the human viewpoint (which Stableford claims spoils "The Thing in the Attic" and which he mistakenly believes to be absent from "Surface Tension") does have its purpose. The womb world of Hydrot, as described in the Prologue, is all ocean except</page><page sequence="7">JAMES BLISH AND NORMAN L. KNIGHT 205 for "one small, triangular continent" which itself "was mostly swamp:' In the context of the sexual analogy that I am pursuing, we have here at least a suggestion of the mons veneris. A seed-ship has crash-landed on this world, presumably on this triangular continent: "The wreck of the seed-ship lay broken squarely across the one real spur of rock which Hydrot seemed to possess which reared a magnificent twenty-one feet above sea level" (111:0:104). Allowing for some mixing of the metaphor, the penis has penetrated the vagina and the surface tension of the hymen has been squarely broken. This introductory itnage contains the gist of the whole story, which, as we shall see, has to do with breaking through surface skin. Above the rock shines the star Tau Ceti, a beacon of aspiration like the "star-fire peak" (1: 1:5) in "Seeding Program: Having lost their germ-cell bank (from which Hydrot was to have been seeded), the crew of five men and two women have apparently no alternative but to await death. However, Dr Chatvieux points out that they themselves can contribute germ cells; and from these, with the aid of "pantropes," microscopic beings might be created that could survive in the puddles about the broken ship. Echoing the reasoning which applies in "The Thing in the Attic," fresh water is chosen rather than the sea because it is safer.'7 The Adapted colonists that result will have no memory of their previous incarnation, although to some degree "the donor's personality patterns" (11:0: 107) will be transmitted. But the original seeding team, including the two lovers, the pilot la Ventura, and midshipman Joan Heath, will die before they can be reborn as something new. A record engraved on metal plates of an appropriately micro- scopic size is left in the hope that the aquatic colonists, after generations of evolution, will decipher and learn the facts. In spite of the objection that telling them they are microscopic "may saddle their entire early history with a gods-and-demons mythol- ogy" (an echo of "The Thing in the Attic" again), this information is included. Chatvieux points out that "These people will be of the race of men .... They are not toys to be protected from the truth forever in a fresh water womb" (11:0:109). The rest of "Surface Tension" is divided into Cycle One and Cycle Two, these titles referring to the aquatic colonists' life cycle, which includes a six-week sporulation "breeding cycle" (11:0: 109). Much of what happens in Cycle One, described from the viewpoint of the colonists, is virtually unintelligible without the information provided in the Prologue. Just as Books One and Two begin with arousals, so Cycle One begins with Lavon waking up in the spring to a "rocking" motion and breaking out of his winter shell, dispersing its "amnionic guid" (11: 1:111, 110)- with his being reborn, in fact. We have been told about the natural inhabitants of the puddles in the Prologue: rotifers, "including a castle-building genus like Earth's Floscularidae," and "a wonderfully variagated protozoan population, with a dominant ciliate type much like Paramoecium" (111:0: 106). In Cycle One it becomes clear that the latter, called Para, are united with the colonists against the deadly rotifers. In all of this intensely and convincingly imagined if confusing activity, includ- ing a successfully repulsed rotifer attack, one is reminded of nothing so much as the behavior of spermatozoa or of the behavior of cells within a human body in the manner of Isaac Asimov's Fantastic Voyage (1966). The sexual dimension is repeatedly suggested: "The man drew up his knees and sank to the cold mud of the Bottom to think. Something wriggled under his buttocks and a tiny spirillum corkscrewed away, identifiable only by feel" (III: 1:113). Whatever may be construed as sexually going on here, the capitalized "Bottom" serves to set up an analogy with the human mind much like that which operates in "The Thing in the Attic"; for two paragraphs later, there is a reference to how Shar, the wise man of the community, dredges strange words "from some Bottom in his skull which none of the rest of them could reach and even Shar could not explain" (III:1:114; emphasis added). Pantropy is ultimately a metaphor for human plasticity. Life depends upon the capacity for continual mental</page><page sequence="8">206 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 10 (1983) rebirth. Not for nothing are we told in Book One that "pantropy had to begin before conception" (1:2:24). Sexual conception is the inevitable metaphor for that concep- tual breakthrough towards which "Surface Tension" moves. It is, after all, the reproductive function of sex that allows men and women to collectively live on into new worlds. As the seeding crew of the Prologue had projected, the colonists push out the castle-building Floscularidae, or Flosc. Section Two of Cycle One deals with the occupation of one such castle, which is described as being "all tunnels and exits and entrances" (11:1:124). For this they abandon a previously captured worm-house, described as "a great tubular hail" (11:1:122)-big enough to house the full 200 members of Lavon's clan- after chasing out the penis-like "worm" (11:1:121). A penis symbol is to be exchanged for a vagina/womb symbol. On the way to battle and passing through the "thermocline" (11: 1:125)-a temperature barrier- into warmer water, "Lavon felt his flight suddenly quicken, as if he had been shot like a seed from some invisible thumb and forefinger" (11:1:126) - or like an ejaculated sperm perhaps? Cycle Two further stresses the importance of biological and planetary rhythms. The time is summer, some generations hence. Shar I of the First Cycle, who had lost one of the two then-undeciphered history plates in the concluding battle, is replaced by Shar XVI, who has made some headway with the remaining plate. The new Lavon, or authority figure, listens to Shar's claim that "We were made by men who were not as we are" (111:2:136) but is unimpressed, and the Para who is present and fears that man will abandon the Protos in search of further knowledge promptly executes Lavon's suggestion that the plate be thrown away. Nevertheless, a seed has been planted. Near the surface of the water, the area called the "sky," Lavon pauses to reflect: Here was the upper limit, the third of the three surfaces of the universe. The first surface was the bottom where the water ended. The second surface was the thermocline, definite enough in summer to provide good sledding, but easily penetrable if you knew how. The third surface was the sky. One could no more pass through that surface than one could penetrate the Bottom, not was there any better reason to try. There the universe ended. (111:2:142; emphasis added) Reflecting on the nature of a gas bubble and on the fact that it contains no water leads Lavon to frame a primitive cosmology. The surface tension of the bubble is as impermeable as the top of the "sky" Perhaps the world of water drifted in a universe of gas? The image of "Jack and the Beanstalk" presents itself again: "Here at his back ... was a plant which gave every appearance of continuing beyond the sky..:" (111:2:143). Although he climbs the plant, he seems unable to breach the weight of the "sky": "He might as well have tried to penetrate a cliff:" When he does finally manage to insert a hand, "There was a kind of soundless explosion. His whole wrist was suddenly encircled in an intense, impersonal grip, as if it were being cut in two" (111:2:144). Nevertheless, for a moment, before the sensation of drowning causes him to tumble downwards, he does manage to thrust his whole body through the "sky" This finely pictorialized philosophical apocalypse strongly suggests that famous 16th-century German woodcut of a monk poking his head through the enclosed circle of the Ptolemaic stars and looking at the actual machinery. The denouement of "Surface Tension' deals with the epic journey that is undertaken across the space that separates Lavon's puddle from a neighboring one. It is this aspect of the story in particular that has left an indelible imprint on the imagination of its SF readership. Christopher Priest's The Inverted World (1974), in its general weirdness and overall intent, represents an attempt to repeat Blish's achievement here. In a passage that appears in the Bodleian typescript as an insert</page><page sequence="9">JAMES BLISH AND NORMAN L. KNIGHT 207 (III:2:147-53) and does not appear in the Galaxy Science Fiction version of "Surface Tension," Shar XVI is provided with three assistants who discuss the design of a "spaceship:" A "tube-shaped model" (111:2:150) rather than "a fragile spherical" (111:2:148) one is favored. Two winter-sleeps later the voyage gets under way and eventually Lavon and his crew of "men"', Para, and Protos, after much difficulty, break through the surface skin of the "sky" - a moment which recalls the broken hymen image with which the Prologue opens. The sun shines in the sky above the "sky." For Shar things begin to make sense. He envisages a universe of containers within containers: I'm beginning to get a picture of the way the universe is made, I think. Evidently our world is a sort of cup in the Bottom of this huge one. This one has a sky of its own; perhaps it, too, is only a cup in the Bottom of a still huger world, and so on without end. It's a hard concept to grasp, I'll admit. Maybe it would be more sensible to assume that all the worlds are cups in this one common surface, and that the great light shines on them all impartially. (111:2:162) At night the light of the "two moons of Hydrot" shines down on "the two-inch wooden spaceship and its microscopic cargo" (III:2:166). In the context of the overall sexual analogy, it seems legitimate to wonder whether the two moons of Hydrot, together with the two suns of Tellura in Book Two, should not be understood as an image of testicles. The first "human" encountered in the adjoining puddle is a terrified girl. We have here the conjoining of a male world (no "human" females are specified in Lavon's puddle) and a feminine one. The description of the girl as "a tall, deceptively relaxed, tawny woman" (111:2:170) is intended to evoke the description of Joan Heath in the Prologue, with her "bright head and tall, deceptively indolent body" (11:0:105). If she has inherited Joan Heath's germ-cells, Lavon, who "had the odd and impossible impression that he should recognize her" (III:2:170), presumably derives from la Ventura's germ-cells and Shar from those of Dr Chatvieux. If the Prologue were omitted, in accordance with Lowndes' wishes, this revelation would, of course, be denied. Blish pays careful attention to the conclusions of his stories and in this case there is an interesting difference to be noted between the Seedling Stars' version of "Surface Tension" and the original magazine publication. Shar undercuts Lavon's assertion that "We have crossed space" with "But- have we?" (11:2:17 1). The Galaxy Science Fiction text concludes with "'As far as I'm concerned, yes,' said Lavon."'8 The Seedling Stars' conclusion deepens the equivocation and focuses attention on the new-found sexual relationship: "Lavon was looking at the girl. He had no answer for Shar's question. It did not seem to be important" (111:2:171). Now is the time to note that the sexual analogy which informs "The Thing in the Attic" and "Surface Tension" is introduced appropriately in Book One, "Seeding Program." In that story, Sweeney is projected onto Ganymede by an odd catapulting device: "The JATO unit shuddered and dealt Sweeney a nearly paralyzing blow between his shoulder blades" (1:1:7). This, of course, is the slap on the back received by the newly-born baby. The experience is recaiie4 as the survival ship takes off during Sweeney's decoy explosion: "The heat struck against Sweeney's skin as strongly as the backwash of the JATO unit had done, so long ago. The concussion, which followed about nine seconds later, flattened him and made his nose bleed" (1:4:58). Balancing the death-like state with which the story opens, Sweeney con- cludes with the assertion "that I'm just born" (1:4:60). He is at home in the new world he was created for. To what extent, it might be wondered, does the sexual analogy reconcile the</page><page sequence="10">208 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 10 (1983) conflict between "changing everything" (I:1:8) and an essential human truth in The Seedling Stars? If sex, as it seems to be, is that essential human truth, a material counterpart to the soul, then pantropy has a long way to go before it can be said to "change everything." A reality which "changes everything" seems to be the revelation towards which The Seedling-Stars, like much SF, aspires. From this point of view, the sexual analogy is part of a containing reality that must be broken through. However, since the sexual analogy is only an analogy, a reader is free to assume that this particular analogy with a seedling pantropic reality, a pantropic truth, is, in fact, a deceptive one. Superficial resemblances mask fundamental differences. The sexual analogy, then, does not so much reconcile the conflict between change and truth as it provides a flickering third term which, depending on how that term is taken, may be related to both change and truth. Nevertheless, it is significant that the structure of The Seedling Stars amounts to a closed circle. 3. A Bigger "Beanstalk": Titans' Daughter. The seedling analogy may fittingly be adapted to Blish's own art. Frequently story seeds would grow into full scale novels.'9 Thus "Beanstalk," the title itself an image of organic growth, doubled its length in becoming Titans'Daughter. Unlike A Case of Conscience, where Blish added a new Part Two, Titans' Daughter is literally an expanded version of "Beanstalk" (also entitled "Giants in the Earth").20 By a process of extensions and insertions, the nine sections of the original story became the 13 chapters of the novella; but the result indicates that financial rather than aesthetic considerations must have been the determining factor. Titans'Daughter further explores the implications of "Watershed" - the prej- udice that "normal" human beings will likely express towards any of their fellows who are perceived to be different. In this case, the difference is a matter of size. This theme of human giants vs. normal humans is one that H.G. Wells got to first, in Food of the Gods (1904); but the similarity would not matter had Blish been able to improve on Wells's treatment. Unfortunately Titans'Daughteris also like Food of the Gods in being one of its author's poorer books. Hokey plotting and forgettable characters, together with little sense of pacing or of a building up to anything, cover a good deal of what is wrong with Blish's book. Its three titles (see above) - none of which quite fits- convey something of the work's generally unfocussed quality. Blish's eight or nine-foot tall, long-lived giants exist because of experiments with polyploidy- that is, with the nuclei of cells which have three or more times the number of chromosones of haploid cells. The giants are "synthetic tetraploids" (1:21) as opposed to the supposedly normal run of "diploid" (1:20) humanity, or so the reader is initially informed. Their life is regulated by SPEECH - "the Society for the Prevention of Exploitation of Exceptional Children:" The Society was created by "A trust fund and congressional backing (modelled on the state's stepping in to protect the children in an old case of multiple birth somewhere in Canada)" (1:23) -the parenthetical reference is to the Dionne quintuplets, born on May 28, 1934, at Callander, Ontario. I will not attempt to summarize the more-than-usually complex convolutions of Blish's plot except to say that it turns on the extremely devious attempt of Maurey to create dissension between tetraploid and diploid by murdering Dr Hyatt, the creator of the tetraploids, and framing fellow tetraploid, Sam, for that murder. Sam is the lover of the beautiful Sena, the Titans' daughter of the book's title, the Titans being a tetraploid football team which plays exhibition games against another tetraploid team called the Atlantians. It is Maurey's aim to have the tetraploids-"like all the hornets of Hell's own ante-room" (11:118) (aided by advanced weaponry and the power of flight derived from a combative football gear item) -and the diploids kill each other in the war he will engineer, so that he, by Sena, "will be patriarch of all the generations to come" (12:129). A polyploid dog</page><page sequence="11">JAMES BLISH AND NORMAN L. KNIGHT 209 named Decibelle, based on "our first dog, Trouble" (0:14) according to Virginia Kidd's Introduction,2" plays a part in finally clearing Sam and tracking down Maurey. Maurey then dies in a collapsed lodge, one of the images of destruction that characteristically end Blish's books. The rather murky point has to do with the fact that the use of the terms "diploid" and "tetrapolid" is inaccurate. All human beings are actually tetraploid. Each of the giants simply has "a different degree of polyploidy" They are called "tetras" for convenience; "The only other choice would have been 'Polly"' (10:112). This detail is picked up in the expansion process; and it there becomes the prefigura- tive vignette of harmony, which Blish inserted in constructing the new Chapter One, involving the marriage of a "normal" man and a giant named Polly (1:26-27). Sena, Maurey discovered, was created, along with himself, by Dr Hyatt as an experiment designed to produce a new breed of "normal"-sized children who will "blend back into society." "Eventually the polyploid characteristics will begin to reappear, piece- meal, until the whole race is heavily polyploid, and then giants will be commonplace and not the subject of pogroms" (13:139). Blish's usual reliance on logic has led him once again to the mediating third term. Girding all this about is a somewhat contrived symbolism introduced by the old Indian legend about the homed devil caterpillar: Mother Carey offered the devil a drink from the Double Cup. One half held wine, and the other half held, I forget, something unpleasant; anyhow there was only one place to drink, so you got a little of each. That was how the horned devil got to be so ugly as a caterpillar, and so beautiful as a butterfly. (1:26) This notion of a compensatory dualism also come out in the business of the "projector," a bamboozlingly described device which realizes "Itihe last of Roger Bacon's engineering dreams" (3:45): a reactionless force, a one-way push. Designed initially for combat on the football field, it has possibilities in war which only Maurey recognizes. Ultimately it turns out that the one-way push actually does have "polari- ty" (12:126). This might have been anticipated by the symbolic association of history and the projector (a word which at this point functions as a pun). After the observation that "A student of history might have known where to look for the missing 'equal and opposite reaction"' (3 45), Maurey disguises the projector with "old newspapers" (4:48) so that it becomes "the invincible thing he had wrapped in ancient history under his arm" (4:49). This association culminates with the reference to "the silver muzzle of history's deadliest weapon" (4:54). In other words, history tells us that the nature of reality is both good and bad; prejudice is a two-way push; the victimizer can easily become the victim. The cleverness and subtlety of all this indicates Blish's ambitions to elevate pulp SF to the status of literary art. In the case of Titans' Daughter, however, the effects are more grotesque than sublime. 4. A Torrent of Faces and a Mass of Mail. In A Torrent of Faces (1967), on which Blish collaborated with Knight, the genetic process is called "tectogenesis"; and the result of that process represented in the novel are called Tritons, human beings adapted for life under the sea. Knight (1895-1972), an SF writer of small output (10 stories in 6 years) and a pesticide chemist for the US Department of Agriculture until his retirement in 1963, had introduced the term "tectogenesis," along with Tritons, in his novella "Crisis in Utopia," an early version of which was serialized in the July and August 1940 issues of Astounding Stories.22 Figuring in both "Crisis in Utopia" andA Torrent of Faces are: an elite group calling itself Prime Center (specified in "Crisis" as short for Prime Co-ordination Center), which runs the world; Submarine Products Corporation; a place called Triton Reef; a substance called "vitrolith"; and the term "Drylander" Submarine Products Corporation also makes an appearance in Knight's</page><page sequence="12">210 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 10 (1983) first story, "Frontier of the Unknown," set in the same future as "Crisis," which was serialized in the July and August 1937 issues of Astounding Stories. In their Preface to A Torrent of Faces, Blish and Knight point out that "this book is a sort of sequel" (0:vii) to the two Knight novellas.?3 On the face of it, A Torrent of Faces seems to have more to do with the theme of overpopulation than with that of tectogenesis. The future, well-nigh utopian world described supports a population of about one trillion "normal" human beings (nine- tenths of whom are unemployed) in one hundred thousand enclosed, pyramidical, hive-type cities. Most of the book deals with the increasing threat of this stable world's collapse posed by three major disasters, one for each of the novel's three books: the shipwreck of a sea hotel; a break in the main supply pipe of a normally empty Disaster City named Gitler in Missouri, Unistan (i.e., the US plus Canada), to which people might be evacuated; and the impact in the Hudson's Bay area of an asteroid, one mile in diameter, named Flavia, one of a cast of 24 "characters" listed after the contents page. (A minor disaster involving a runaway slime-culture carpet makes for a second sea disaster balancing the two land disasters.) Among the characters, the most important are Biond Smith, who is chief of the Disaster Plans Board; Jothen Kent, the senior water engineer for Gitler; Dorthy Sumter, the chairwoman of Submarine Products Corporation (SPC); and two Tritons-Storm, their chief and executive chairman of SPC, and Tioru, the deputy chairman of SPC. We may assume that Blish, with his fondness for T.S. Eliot (note the name Sweeney in "Seeding Program" and note also that Blish's "After Such Knowledge" trilogy takes its title from a line in "Gerontion"), was responsible for choosing the book's epigraph, which is taken from Four Quartets: "The dove descending breaks the air/With tongues of incandescent fire." As the title of Chapter 14, "The Dove Descending" designates the meteor. A Torrent of Faces and Doctor Mirabilis were the two novels on which Blish invested most time and effort. In the Preface to A Torrent of Faces, Blish and Knight note that "We began speculating about the population side of the problem in 1948; the intervening time was consumed mostly by endless pages of calculations, several dozen drawings and diagrams, about thirty thousand words of notes, and many fat letters..." (0:vii). Nineteen years on from 1948, the novel finally appeared. Most of the material that Blish and Knight refer to may be located amongst the Bodleian Blish Papers.24 There are 167 pages of correspondence alone, beginning with a Knight letter dated February 28, 1949, and ending with a Knight letter dated June 18, 1967. Blish's side of this correspondence is, unfortunately, not fully represented. Since these letters document the extent of Knight's involvement in the composition of A Torrent of Faces, it will be necessary to review their contents before returning to my analysis of the tectogenesis theme. In addition there is Dep. Blish 399/6 which consists of maps and six very detailed diagrams by Knight of a futuristic form of television, the floating-globe hotel, and aspects of a Biological Preserve where, in the interests of a controlled ecology, all the wildlife is kept apart from all that vegetation known as the World Forest, which covers most of the world's land masses including the exteriors of the cities. And Dep. Blish 399/5 contains a mass of possible source material and relevant information culled mainly from newspapers and magazines. To say the least, the research for A Torrent of Faces was thorough. In some respects all this material is rather more interesting than the final novel. Indeed a fascinating book might be written on the production of A Torrent of Faces by concentrating on the papers, including corrected typescripts (Dep. Blish 400/1-2), at Oxford. There is probably no other SF novel, and very few novels generally, about which so much information exists. It is a poignant and sobering experience in reading through the mass of correspondence to note the references to the major crises and events in Blish's personal life - the flooding of the Blishes' Milford home, his separa-</page><page sequence="13">JAMES BLISH AND NORMAN L. KNIGHT 211 tion and divorce from Virginia, his remarriage, and the first appearance in 1964 of the cancer that would eventually kill him. Indeed, his life went by during the gestation and composition of this book. Here, however, I wish only to outline what may be leamed about the composition of A Torrent of Faces and the division of responsibility. Knight, in a letter headed Silver Springs, Maryland (this address remains constant throughtout the correspondence) and dated October 21, 1951, agrees to Blish's proposal of a collaboration, "but I think that I shall be collaborating with you rather than you with me." In a subsequent letter (November 24, 1957), Knight suggests a series of tides: DISASTER ALERT, COLLOSSUS IN FLUX, THE MILLIONS MARCH, TIDE OF BIL IONS, and BILLIONFOLD EXODUS. The basic idea he wanted to express was that of a "great mass of people in motion: Later they fixed on the title CRITICAL MASS. In a letter of June 2,1952, Knight refers to a plot that Blish has worked out; and in a much later letter, dated June 16, 1965, Blish confirms that plotting was his responsibility. In a series of 1952 letters, Knight notes "Your 'corporate franchise' system is a novel idea," exclaims "What a-long incubation period this story has had," remembers that Blish had located Gitler in the vicinity of present-day Kewanei, and confesses himself unaware that fluted French fires are called "pagodas:" Blish and Knight felt themselves to be in competition with Isaac Asimov's overpopulation novel, Caves of Steel (1954). Much later (March 24, 1964) Blish claims that Horace Gold pirated the meat of A Torrent of Faces and passed it along to Asimov. In a September 1953 letter, Blish recalls Knight's stipulation that "you'd be able to do no writing but would advise," and then goes on to ask, "Could you find time to write Section II-that would be chapter 4, 5, and 6? I think I could take it from there to the end:" Blish had hit a "rather sizable psychological block: Knight rejects Blish's request in a letter of September 29, 1953: "At best, the product would seriously impair your flattering opinion of my ability as a writer:" John Campbell apparently saw a portion of the story and felt it to be swamped by detail. Blish decides to incorporate Campbell's ideas surreptitiously in order to sell the stoxy (October 2, 1953) but fears the nudity would "never get past Katy Tarrant," Campbell's blue- stocking secretary. However, nudity does remain in the published novel as a feature of sealed city life, although there are taboos against running, stretching, or bending! A letter of March 17, 1956 makes it clear that Knight did not feel entitled to any profits from the novel: "You have had all the toil and trouble of writing Critical Mass, and of trying to find a buyer for it, while I have had nothing but the fun of dreaming up ideas and none of the labor of hammering them into shape:" But Blish.in his reply (April 1, 1956) points out that "my plots almost always evolve quasi-automatically from" "a solid idea and background details" -the things which Knight supplied - and hence insists that they "split by[-I line and 50-50 on the money:" Blish was in fact having considerable difficulty in placing the novel and had considered breaking it up into saleable sections. However, in a letter dated December 13, 1963, in which he announces his break-up with Virginia, he also announces that the novel has been placed with Canaveral Press under the tide A TORRENT OF FACES. The news provided a major new impetus. But Dick Lupoff, the editor of Canaveral Press, insists that the duodecimal numbering system used in the manu- script has to go and "wants Jothen or Biond to visit a Triton home or nest, or a center such as you described in CRISIS IN UTOPIA:' Blish asks Knight to do the latter - Jothen is the visitor- in Chapter 4. Furthermore, "Dick wants to see a firmer tie throughout to the world of CRISIS IN UTOPIA, as though the world of A TOR- RENT OF FACES were a logical outgrowth of it." Lupoff seems to have rejected a proposed last chapter, claiming that the preceding one makes a good logical ending. However, in a letter of December 9, 1963, he claims to like the hardboiled ending of Chapter 16. It seems to have been agreed that the undersea ecology represents the</page><page sequence="14">212 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 10 (1983) only source of hope, and around this time a new character, the Triton Storm, is introduced. The references to Storm prior to Chapter 4 were later inserts. Replying to Blish's letter on January 27, 1964, Knight selects the Great Barrier Reef as the scene of Triton operations and points out that "Crisis in Utopia" is set in the 42nd century (although this is not explicitly stated in the story): "If TORRENT is dated earlier, let us hope that no reader with a memory like a couple of elephants will note the discrepancy." Two days later Blish suggests a 22nd century date for TOR- RENT (it turns out to be 2774) and proposes changing the date in "Crisis" if the story is reprinted. (That story has not been reprinted since 1953.) The reference to a "hovercraft" (1:5:88) was added at Blish's suggestion- "because they are now in current use:" Pleased with Knight's idea that the Tritons should have an electric organ, Blish writes: "The notion will give the ladies a delicious shudder:" Some question arose as to the placement of the Triton's gills: should they be between the ribs or behind the ears? They decided on the rib location. Knight, who mentions his dislike for hair, is, it appears from these letters, touchingly attached to his hairless Tritons. The sunken hotel business seems to have been Knight's idea, and he also suggested the Deep Water Safari idea for Chapter 4. It is agreed that Chapters 4 and 5 will be published separately under the latter's title, "The Shipwrecked Hotel." In greatly abridged form, this comes to pass in Galaxy (August 1965; Frederik Pohl accepted the story after John Campbell had rejected it). In a letter dated February 19,1964, Blish speaks of plotting to marry his new young lady (Judith Lawrence) "(she is only 28)" and suggests that she do the jacket for the book. This does not come to pass. As a "useful rule of thumb," Blish, in a letter of February 20, 1964, suggests that Knight do Jothen throughout while he adopts Biond's persona. The hotel disaster is to be the result of a computer malfunction caused by the intrusion of small creatures. Knight originally decided on mice for this purpose; and in a letter dated March 2, 1964, he favors publishing "The Shipwrecked Hotel" as "Three White Mice:" Blish replies with the suggestion that silverfish would be better, but in a subsequent letter (March 24,1964) he reverses himself and opts for mice. However, Knight, who seems to have drafted Chapters 4 and 5 at least, had already used silverfish. Writing the second installment of Chapter 4 Knight found "a real chore" (June 9, 1964). Blish had also asked Knight to write Dorthy's "oration," which must be the case that she makes in Chapter 2 before Prime Center for making use of the artificial production of amino acids under the sea. Everything does not go smoothly. In 1965, Canaveral Press backs out of the book, but the work goes on. Knight's idea of the Gitler pipeline break is adopted. The development of this aspect of the novel in Chapters 7, 8, and 10 also becomes a separate story under the title of Chapter 10, "The Piper of Dis" (named for a musical method of crowd control and also for the broken pipeline), which appeared in Galaxy (in August 1966). Blish announces Pohl's acceptance of the story in his letter of July 1, 1965. The Fongavaro Jones episode, which weaves through Chapters 7 and 10, and involves a crazy member of the Jones Conventionl at Gitler who attempts to kill Jothen, was also Knight's idea. However, Knight's suggestion (July 3, 1965) that the forest rangers (who look after the World Forest) be tectogenetic rodents does not meet with Blish's approval. He believed - rightly- that the book was already over- crowded with novelties. Then, in a triumphant letter dated December 30,1965, Blish announces that A Torrent has been sold to Doubleday. Success at last, 18 years after the idea first germinated. Meanwhile, Knight has not run out of suggestions. He now wants to introduce a love affair between a Triton and a human. At first Blish is against it, but then he changes his mind and proposes that the relationship should be fertile. In his letter of February 1, 1966, aside from dropping the titles (unspecified) of the three interior</page><page sequence="15">JAMES BLISH AND NORMAN L. KNIGHT 213 books, he suggests "Hybrid Vigor" as the title for the magazine version of the love story which occupies Chapters 6,9, and 11. Subsequently (May 27,1966), he retitled "Hybrid Vigor" "To Love an Other" (which, appearing in Analog in April 1967, was the third independent story-extract from the novel) but retained "Hybrid Vigor" as the title for Chapter 11 of the book. In the same letter Blish asks Knight to do the penultimate chapter, 15- "A Walk in the Paradise Garden" towards the Biological Preserve wrecked as a result of the meteor-because of his "softer hand under Mother Nature" On the whole, A Torrent of Faces is a successful collaborative effort though not without its faults. Knight does not have Blish's stylistic or narrative skills; and per- haps something of the book's plodding, overly descriptive quality is to be attributed to his input. There is a lot a superfluous detail, and too much of the novel reads like a verbal blueprint. Marvellous buildings, which suggest an old Gernsbackian techno- logical SF, get more descriptive space than people do. Blish had objected to Knight's contrived Victorian alternatives to the straight "he said," "she said:' But each writer contributed things the other lacked, and the finished novel does achieve a stylistic uniformity. Without the evidence provided by the correspondence, it would not be possible to allocate responsibility for the various aspects of this underrated, richly meaningful, and carefully structured novel. Brain Stableford has implied that the tectogenesis theme is very minor in A Torrent of Faces.&gt; In what follows- and returning to the main topic of this article-I wish simply to demonstrate that, on the contrary, the Tritons are the lynch pin which holds together the book's apparently disparate elements. Like much SF,A Torrent of Faces hinges on the opposition between the artificial and the natural.27 The land world of the novel has been artificially segregated into three separate areas: a massive vegetable area, the World Forest; the various Biological Preserves where the animals are kept; and the enclosed cities where the people are kept. This apparently stable situation is then steadily undermined by a series of more or less natural disasters, culminating in the meteor. The hotel disaster, for example, depends upon the accidental presence of silverfish and a storm. The opposition of the artificial to the natural is correlated with that between reason and emotion; while the Tritons, who are frequently the target of prejudice, as one might expect represent the necessary balance between the two. The name of the Triton leader, Storm, connects him quite directly with the major natural force responsible for the hotel disaster. Throughout the novel, all manner of imagistic and thematic details serve to relate the sea world (primarily associated with the natural and the emotional) with the land world (primarily associated with the artificial and the rational). Most of the pyramidical city of Chicago is "out of sight, like an iceberg" (1:4:45). Likewise, the Barrier-hilthon hotel, adrift at sea and "afflicted by the computorial equivalent of schizophrenia" (1:5:66), moves "with the ponderous steadiness of an iceberg" (1:5:68). An artificial aerial panorama - "Everywhere were the endlessly diversified patterns of the terraced cities - wheels and stars, snowflake designs... interlaced circles, three-dimensional lattices of arches... .the tapestry of cities and forest" (1:4:51) - seems not that different from this natural aerial panorama: "Scattered among the lush islands were the white rings and crescents and filigree patterns of reefs and atolls" (1:5:76). Philadelphia, like London with its "Cornwall District" (11:6:110), is a "people reef' (11:6:109; 11:9:139). The World Forest is twice compared with the sea (11:9:140,148). Jothen flees "a lake of bent heads" (11:10:181), rolls over "Ilhike a scuba diver" (11:10:183), but "A growing murmur of many voices, like a distant sea, told Jothen that a surf of Joneses was already out on the roof of the city" (11: 10:184-85). Of course, the titles A Torrent of Faces and "A Torrent of Joneses' (Chapter 7) make the same point. And naturally, the break in Gitler's main feeder line has the effect of</page><page sequence="16">214 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 10 (1983) "flooding" (11:10:179) the city. The meteor Flavia, as part of a superbly realized scene, speeds towards the interface of land and sea (the Hudson's Bay area) with a noise "like a distant waterfall" (III:14:24). Parallel murders-that of the woman discovered by the Triton Tioru in the reservoir and that of a man named Krantz in Gitler City - also serve to relate the two worlds. The conflict between reason and emotion is explored in two relationships: one between the Drylanders Jothen and Kim Wernicke, the ecological surgeon for the Starved Rock Biological Preserve; the other between a Drylander, Dorthy, and the Triton Tioru. In spite of the fact that the "Erection of [their] rocket has begun" (1:4:54), Jothen cannot make the right emotional connection: "You try to be eloquent and persuasive and it comes out sounding like a tract or a lecture. This is no engineering problem" (1:4:55). (But this is something like the problem that much of the book's descriptive detail makes for its readers.) As for the Triton-Drylander liaison, "Reason, as usual, was all against it" (11:6:102). After an attempt at living in Philadelphia, Tioru comes to agree with Dorthy: "Triton and Drylander can't mix" (11:9:167). However, Dorthy is happy to be made an honorary Triton, and it seems that the hybrid children that result from such unions possess special powers- they represent the necessary further evolution of the human race. The "Hybrid Vigor" of Chapter 11 takes the form of an ability to create hallucinations, an ability which Storm, who reveals himself to be a hybrid, demonstrates. This wild talent business may be corny, as Stableford suggests, but it does effectively make the basic point?, The connection between the false opposition of the natural and the artificial and the equally false opposition of emotion and reason is made most tellingly by the title of the very short central Chapter 8: "The Wooing of Flavia." Those four words unite the source of -a natural disaster with human emotions. An ultimate solution to the population problem, which becomes almost ancillary to that of artificial-reason vs. natural-emotion (although the birth rate has gone up thanks to a diet change), is seen to rest with the Tritons- or more particu- larly with the hybrids who "can be a bridge" (11:6:111): 'There is hybrid vigor. And there is, of course, the sea .... For the forseeable future all our hope lies in Submarine Products- and with the Tritons .... And there's the mutations that the fall of Flavia is bound to provoke. All disorderly and unpredictable, like the sea itself- but we never really did have our order imposed upon nature, we were only fooling ourselves' (III:16:269-70) The future possibilities, those explored in The Seedling Stars, "when we start living on other worlds," had been raised earlier: 'It's a big universe, and a mere two kinds of human beings won't be able to cope with it" (11:11:207). The title of the concluding Chapter 16, "... but we shall all be changed" - Biond's first reaction to hearing of the meteor is being quoted (1:3:36) - likewise recalls the idea of pantropy. The novel's concluding description of Storm serves to unite, via the mineral element (outside of the sea, Tritons' tears, it has been explained [1:2:181, are continual and involuntary), those animal, vegetable, and human realms- together with those of reason and emotion, the artificial and the natural - that the Drylanders had attempted to segregate: "He paused to look back in the direction of the ruins of Starved Rock Preserve, his ebony face enigmatic except for his mechanical, slow- falling, and-perhaps-meaningless tears" (III:16:270; emphasis added). A com- plex, controlled novel reaches an appropriately complex, controlled conclusion. What it perhaps lacks is a sufficient input of the "disorderly and unpredictable" (III: 16:270). It should be recognized that the notion of biological or genetic engineering predates Blish's three treatments of the theme. It crops up incidentally in Wells's The First Men in the Moon (1901), in Olaf Stapledon's Last and First Men (1930) (an</page><page sequence="17">JAMES BLISH AND NORMAN L. KNIGHT 215 ancestor Blish alludes to in The Seedling Stars 11:3:441), and most significantdy in Aldous Huxley'sBraveNew World (1932). J.B.S. Haldane had discussed the possibili- ties in a 1923 lecture published in 1924 asDaedalus; orScience and the Future. And, of course, the influence of Knight's "Crisis in Utopia" was seminal. One of the Tritons in that novel makes a speech which clearly anticipates much of The Seedling Stars: But is this the end? Must we forever restrain ourselves from going beyond the Triton? We shall populate the sea; what of the air? What of the vast world of little things, where flowers and trees and a meadow is a boundless forest? What of our neighbour planets, where Man exists only as an alien? What of the unknown worlds among the stars?" What Blish did in three novels, one outstanding, one good, and one not-so-good, was to follow Knight's lead in placing genetic engineering on center stage and treating the matter seriously and convincingly. Thereby he paved the way for a novel like Pohl's Man Plus (1976) and for the possibilities of that form of genetic engineering known as cloning, possibilities marvellously exploited in John Varley's The Ophiuchi Hotline (1977). Thus the seeds Blish developed have continued to grow. NOTES 1. Science Fiction Quarterly, 1 (May 1951):89-91. Discussions of "The Mathemati- ca Story," "The Astronomical Story," and 'The Psychological Story" appeared in the subsequent issues: in August (pp. 83-86) and November 1951 (pp. 111-13) and in May 1952 (pp. 49-53), respectively. The above order of these "sciences" (Blish notes that as yet there is no science of psychology) corresponds exactly to their importance in his own work. In an autobiographical piece, 'The Development of a Science Fiction Writer" Blish notes that "the biological sciences play important roles in more of my output than in that of any other living SF writer known to me": Foundation, no. 2 (June 1972), p. 19. 2. "The Biological Story," loc. cit., p. 90. 3. "Sunken Universe" corresponds to Cycle One of Book Three, and the Galaxy version of "Surface Tension" consists of the Prologue and Cycle Two minus an insert in section 3 of that Cycle. Note also that "panatropy" and its derivatives in that version of the Prologue were changed to "pantropy" and its derivatives for the book. 4. See the back of the first page of a ycript of "The Thing in the Attic' (Bodleian Dep. Blish 399/1). This tpescript also indicates two changes of heart regarding the book's dedicatee. Dr Thurlow G. Nelson, exed out, is replaced by Karen Anne Emden (the daughter of Blish's first wife, Virginia Kidd, by a previous marriage). Then her name is crossed out in pencil and the final choice, H.L Gold, the SF writer and editor, is pencilled in. 5. The Seedling Stars raises the question of whether it is a story sequence or a novel. Books One, Two, and Four were clearly written as logical offshoots of Book Three, and there is no difficulty is establishing thematic, imagistic, and structural coherence. I would classify the book as a story sequence on its way to being a novel; where the choice arises, as here, I shall use the term novel. 6. Blish was invited to chair a panel discussion on the topic "Pantropy vs. Terraforming" at Novacon, the First British November Science Fiction Convention, held in Birmingham (November 13-14, 1971). In his introductory survey of the same title (Bodleian Dep. Blish 427/4a), Blish notes that the term "terraforming" was coined by Jack Williamson in the late 1940s. 7. A couple of revised and extended paragraphs on page 48 of the typescript of "A Time to Survive" (pp. 46-47 of the Gnome Press edition of The Seedling Stars, for which see n. 8 below) indicate the care with which Blish constructs a logical chain for his stories. In describing how Port Authority suppressed the existence of an interstellar drive, Blsh inserts references to "several exploratory voyages," the records of which were destroyed. But thanks to contact with "several survivors," Blish is able to explain how the Altered</page><page sequence="18">216 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 10 (1983) Men reached Ganymede. 8. All parenthetical book: chapter: page references to The Seedling Stars are to the original edition (NY: Gnome Press, 1957). 9. 1 am grateful to my colleague, Robert M. Philmus, for pointing out the allusion here to George Gamow's One Two Three... Infinity: Facts and Sperulations of Science (NY: Viking Press, 1947; rev. ed., 1961). Gamow's title nicely encapsulates the process from extrapolation to transcendence so typical of SE 10. Given that Blish himself died of cancer, one wonders to what extent this reference constitutes prescience on his part and to what extent this SF story and other aspects of his work represent a wish-fulfilling attempt to avoid his own death. See in this regard, my, "Death and the Denial of History: The Textual Shadow of the SF Author," SFS, 9 (July 1982):228-30. Reference is also made to "the cancer problem" in Titans' Daughter (1:3:40; see publication data in n. 20 below), but not in the original "Beanstalk" version. In both versions, the giant's extended 150-year life span is a significant issue. Evidence of Blish's preoccupation with cancer is further supported by the novel interpre- tation of K4fka's The Castle which Blish outlines in a letter (December 17, 1962) to the Australian critic John Baxter. Suggesting that the whole book may be viewed as being about cancer, Blish identifies K as a "metastatic cell from a testicular cancer," or Krebs in German (Bodleian Dep. Blish 411/10). 11. See Chapter 26, "Symbolism," in Damon Knight, In Search of Wonder: Essays on Modem Science Fiction (1956; rev. ed., Chicago, 1967), pp. 265-73. Most of this material appeared originally in Science Fiction Forum, No. 1 (1957). 12. The upper world of Tellura is vividly imagined and may have influenced at least two imporant works of SF: Brian W. Aldiss's Non-Stop (1958) and Ursula K. Le Guim's "The Word for World is Forest" (1972). Non-Stop shares not only the imagery of vegetative abundance and "Giants" but also the basic theme of conceptual breakthrough. 13. There is also a contradiction regarding whether "lizard birds" or "monkeys" should be viewed as the Tellurians' evolutionary ancestors (11:2:76-77; 11:4:94) but this definitely appears to be carelessness on Blish's part. 14. "To my considerable bafflement, this is the most. popular story I have ever written .... I set out to do no more than write about what it might really be like to live in the microcosm, where such forces as surface-tension are all important and such forces as gravity negligible; but somewhere along the line I seem to have touched a nerve more mythological than molecular. I wish I knew how, for if I did, I'd do it again": Introduction to "Surface Tension," in The Best SF Stories of James Blish (London: Faber &amp; Faber, 1965), p. 72. 15.

Lowndes (NY: Ballantine Books, 1979), p. xvi. 17. In "The Biological Story" (see n. 1 above), Blish points out that "Sunken Universe" and "Surface Tension" are "based on a small subdivision of ecology called limnology, which is the study of the shore-line areas of bodies of fresh water" (p. 91). 18. Galaxy Science Fiction, 4 (Aug. 1952):40. I have described the journey in "Surface Tension" as "epic." But given the microscopic context, "mock epic" might be the more appropriate term. In a perceptive critique, Gary K. Wolfe observes that, in its concern with colonizing other worlds, "Surface Tension" parodies the entire concept of The Seedling Stars (something that cannot, incidentally, be said of "The Thing in the Attic"). In fact the sustained tone of irony throughout the book, culminating in the heavily ironic final story, both parodies the vast Homeric sweep of SF and makes for a four-part, mock-epic, miniature counterpart of Blish's grander vision of cyclical history, the Cities in Flight tetralogy.

In a December 17, 1962 letter to John Baxter (Bodleian Dep. Blish 411/10), Blish notes that "Beanstalk" and Titans'Daughter represent the first success for the tape recorder method of composition that he and Virginia Kidd experimented with. 21. Virgina Kidd also points out in her Introduction that the fleeting description of "The old green statue of Charles S. Peirce expounding philosophy from his chair" (1:4:49) commemorates "the pragmatist" who "lived and worked one mile up the road from us, here in Milford" (0:13). 22.

More specifically A Torrent of Faces grew out of the passage from Henry George's Progress and Poverty (1879) which appears as the book's epigraph: "That the Earth could maintain a thousand billions as easily as a thousand millions is a necewary deduction from the manifest truth that, at least as far as our agency is concerned, matter is eternal and force must continue to act....' Blish records that, having read the essay that Knight published in response, "Hemy George Slipped Here," he wrote to Knight suggesting that the essay be turned into a novel. See "Comments on Torrent," Speculation, 2 (September 1968), p. 6. All parenthetical division: page references to A Torrent of Faces are to the British edition (London: Faber &amp; Faber, 1968). 24.

(DK) Abstract.-A concern with genetic engineering links The Seedling Stars, Titans' Daugh- ter, and A Torrent of Faces. In the four stories which make up The Seedling Stars, the most important of these three books, a technique designed to fit human beings to alien worlds is called 'pantropy, " which means "changing everything." The question arises, if evetything about a human being is, or can be, changed, is the result still a human being? This dichotomy between change and an unchanging human reality or essential truth is ambiguously mediated by a developing sexual analogy which figures in the two central stories, ".The Thing in the Attic" and "Surface Tension. "Experiments with polyploidy have led to the creation of a persecuted race of giants in Titans' Daughter, a work marred by hokey plotting, poor characterization, and contrived symbolism. A Torrent of Faces, by Blish and Knight, takes over a process called "tectogenesis" and artificial sea beings called "Tritons" from Knight's 1940 novella, "Crisis in Utopia." An analysis of letters exchanged between the two authors (and now part of the Bodleian Library Blish Papers) reveals the division of labor that went into the novel over a 19-year period. What might appear to be a division between the themes of overpopulation and tectogenesis is shown to be reconciled by the Tritons. Blish 's and Knight's work in the area of genetic engineering mediates between that of Wells, Stapledon, and Huxley on the one hand, and that of Pohl and Varley on the other (DK)</page></plain_text>
