<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGICAL REPORTS FOR 1970-71 ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1970-7I Archaeological work in 1970-71 has been domi- nated by the further remarkable discoveries of Professor Marinatos at Akroteri on Thera, by the further exploitation of the discoveries at Marathon, and, in Athens itself, by the extension of the work of the American School in the Agora, where the streets between the Stoa of Attalos and the Roman Agora have now been demolished (197I). In spring 1971 a major discovery was made, that of a large Myce- naean chamber-tomb on the hill of Megalo Kastelli at Thebes (see below, pp. I4-15). A second large Macedonian chamber-tomb with frescoes has been recently discovered at Lefkadia, close to the tomb discovered by Ph. Petsas in 1954, but no details are at present available. The present report concerns essentially work done in 1969 and 1970, as reported by leaders of the excavations of the Foreign Schools in Athens, and as reported on behalf of the Archaeological Society in Ergon (1970). It also concludes the brief advance- notices of major finds in AAA 1970 and 1971(I). The contents of the two volumes of the Chronika of Archaeologikon Deltion (ADelt 24, Chr I and 2), which appeared in 197o, and cover the year 1968, are also analysed on a very selective basis, and only, for the most part, if the item has not already appeared in AAA. I owe, as usual, a debt of gratitude to the Directors of the Foreign Schools and to the leaders of excava- tions for their co-operation in providing reports and photographs, and to those responsible for the publi- cations for permission to reproduce photographs which have already appeared in Ergon, ADelt and AAA. ATHENS AND ATTICA National Museum. In AAA 1971, I, 44-9, V. Kallipolitis reports on progress in the preparation of the late Hellenistic and Roman Sculpture rooms in the National Museum, and discusses in this context the newly restored large equestrian statue from Melos. He also describes the provisional exhibition of bronzes, including the Peiraeus bronzes found in 1959 and those found at Ambelokipi in 1964. He dates the Peiraeus Athena to the end of the fourth century. Mrs Touloupa describes, ibid. 49-53, other items among the newly exhibited bronzes, including bronze hydriai, an unpublished bronze lamp from Chalkis of the third quarter of the fourth century, and various mirrors, some with a support in the form of a female figure, others with handles, and others of the folding variety, with lids with scenes in relief, notably one (15268) showing Dionysos and Ariadne. Agora. In continuation of his report on the cam- paign of 1970 (see AR 1969-7o 3-4), dealing with the discovery of the Stoa Basileios, Mr Leslie Shear Jr. reports as follows on the two other major areas of excavation: 'In the eastern half of the newly appropriated zone the excavations of 1970 brought to light the fagades of the first buildings along the north side of the market square. The heavy foundations for a colonnade, perhaps of another stoa, indicate the northern limit of the Agora in the Roman period. This structure was erected in the early years of the first century after Christ. About A.D. 150, its eastern end was incor- porated in a large basilica constructed at the north- eastern corner of the Agora adjacent to the terrace of the Stoa of Attalos. The principal axis of the building seems to have run north to south, and its short southern fagade took the form of a colonnade which faced the Agora. The remains of this colonnade were found just south of the railroad within the old archaeological zone and have long been known as the 'North-east Stoa'. These foundations can now for the first time be properly understood. Best preserved of the remains of the basilica are the heavy foundations for its great internal peristyle and portions of the marble within the peristyle. 'Beneath the Roman buildings there were preserved deep stratified deposits extending from the archaic period to Roman times, for the Roman buildings themselves had protected the earlier remains below them. Here were uncovered a line of small shops of the archaic and classical periods which had lined the principal streets along the north side of the Agora. The shops are undoubtedly parts of private buildings, perhaps with domestic quarters behind them, and they occupied this part of the market square, with various renovations and reconstructions from the sixth century B.c. until the first century A.D. These remains provide important evidence for the northern limits of the Agora in early times; and they further indicate that the location of the great Classi- cal public buildings, the Stoa Poikile and the Stoa of the Herms, should be sought further to the west beneath the modern St Philip's Square. 'The third major area of excavation was on the north-eastern slopes of Areopagos, where part of a large and sumptuous private house of the fifth and sixth centuries after Christ was explored. Only the western half of the structure was cleared during the season of 1970, but enough to show that it consisted of large rooms grouped about a central court once adorned with marble columns of the Ionic order. At the south-east corner of the peristyle there came to light an apsidal chamber approached from the peri- style by a flight of marble steps descending between a pair of Ionic columns of which one stands in situ. The walls of this room were originally revetted with marble slabs of which those on the west wall have survived intact. The walls are preserved in places</page><page sequence="2">4 P. M. FRASER FIG. I to a height of 3 m. so that the arched doorway communicating with an inner chamber likewise stands to its original full height. The apse itself is largely occupied by a stepped pool about I m. deep, and the floor around it is paved in mosaic (Fig. I). 'The building is one of the largest and most ele- gantly appointed private dwellings to be excavated in the area of the Agora. Its original construction dates to the years around A.D. 400, although it in- corporates some earlier pre-existing elements in its plan. Its floors were heavily overlaid with masses of destruction debris which dates to the end of the sixth century after Christ and is surely to be associated with the Slavic invasions of the 580s.' Reference must be made here to the publication of J. Travlos's monumental Bildlexikon zur Topographie des antiken Athen, a remarkable repertory of the ma- terial remains of the city from the earliest period until the end ofAntiquity (Deutches Archiologisches Institut, Tiibingen 1971). Enriched with magnificent photo- graphs and furnished with full bibliographies, it embodies a lifetime of concentrated thought and study, and will provide a new starting-point for all future studies of Athens. An English version of this work has also been published. City Area. In AAA 1970, I, 1-9, Miss Y. Niko- poulou publishes a summary account of her excava- tions at the corner of Adrianou and Theseiou Streets, and associates them with other excavations in the same area, opposite the 'Theseion' (see her plan, p.3, fig. I). The excavations uncovered part of the Pana- thanic Way (Fig. 2), the earlier layer of which, lying at a depth of 7 m. below the modern road, apparently belongs to the sixth century. At subsequent periods it was considerably widened and realigned and drain- age channels added. During the Byzantine period the surface of the street was covered with buildings. In the late Hellenistic period a stoa flanked the road on the north. The Archaeological Service under Miss O. Alexandri undertook some sixty excava- tions, mostly in the nature of rescue opera- tions, in the city area in 1968. Further sections of the city-wall were, as usual, brought to light. Among these excavations attention may be called to the following items. (I) (No. 13) At the junction of Dionysiou Areopagitou and Propylaion Streets, on the slope at the foot of the Acro- polis, buildings of at least seven phases from early classical to late Hellenistic times were identified, also part ofa late Roman villa with a well-preserved mosaic. The original use of the area, in the Geometric period, was as a burial ground, and the earliest surviving architectural remains are the stretch of archaic wall 6 m. below present road level. In early classical times a P-shaped poly- gonal analemma was built on the sloping ground, and this in turn was replaced by another larger, triangular analemma in the second half ofthe fifth century. The masonry of this structure consisted of an unusual combination of large irregularly shaped blocks and intervening small pieces inserted to fill up the gaps caused by the irregularity of the large blocks; on the south a stretch of 15 m. of this wall survives. In Hellenistic times a single structure absorbed all these classical walls. After the Sullan destruction the area was covered over and was not re-used till late Roman times. Three graves, one of the early classical period, one of the late fifth or early fourth, and one of the third, century, were found, and, among chance finds in a deposit, a Panathanaic amphora of the second century B.C. (2) (Nos. 17, 18, 53) In the Kerameikos area, a stretch of the city wall discovered in Dipylon Street, and another in Sapphous Street, assist the determi- nation of its direction in this area east of the Erian Gates: the stretch in Dipylon Street (No. 17) was built in the fourth century, while that in Sapphous Street (No. 53) contains both a Themistoclean and a late fourth century phase. At the juncture of Dipylon and Leokoriou Streets (No. 18) a section of the west tower of the Erian Gates was discovered, belonging to the first half of the fourth century, and the previous location of these gates was shown to be incorrect: the gate was repaired in late Roman times. (cf. AAA 1968, 2, 102ff., where a brief report is already given). (3) (No. 31) A major discovery already briefly described and illustrated by Miss Alexandri (AAA 1969, 2, 257 ff.; cf. AR 1969-70 4) was made in a plot in Marathonos Street, close to its junction with Achilleos Street, in the area between Homonoia Square and the railway line. The plot was used as a burial ground in the fifth and fourth centuries. Five pit-tombs covered with tiles and one child's burial in a larnax were discovered in the centre of the plot. Fragments of numerous vases found in the top soil, and subsequently restored, included a fine red- figure lekythos with a scene from a gynaeconitis, and numerous white lekythoi. On the ground in the</page><page sequence="3">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1970-7I 5 (Fig. 4). In the late Roman building on the same plot were discovered built into a wall three headless statues of seated philo- sophers of the second century A.D., including one identified by its resemblance to other pieces as Epicurus. (4) In Poulopoulou Street, between the Theseum Gardens and the line of the Athens-Peiraeus Underground, a substantial section, 35 m. long, of the road leading to the Peiraean Gates was discovered. Four road levels were identified, the first of the early Hellenistic, the last of the early Byzan- tine, period; the analemmata of the road were irregular trapezoid blocks. Beside the road were various buildings including a potters' kiln, and on its north side three tombs, one of which, of late Roman date, consisted of a cylindrical marble osteotheke in which was a silver funerary urn. (ADelt 24 Chr I, 25-76). Marathon. The excavations of Professor Marinatos begun in 1969 (A.S.), continued in 1970: see the account published in AR i969-70 6, based on preliminary reports. For a fuller account of the excavations see Ergon 1970, 5-13. It is to be noted that Tombs II and IV of the grave circle at Vrana are now known to have contained objects not only of Middle Helladic, but also of Mycenaean date. In AAA 1971, I, 99--1O, Mme D. Callipolites- Feytmans discusses the Attic b.f. plates found in FIG. 2 area of the tombs were numerous pieces of funerary statuary in Pentelic marble of the middle of the fourth century. They include four statues of female figures (Fig. 3), and a well-preserved funerary lion FIG. 3 FIG. 4 Professor Marinatos' excavation of the 'Tomb of the Plataeans' at Marathon. Laurion. Cave of Kitsos. The excavations of Mme N. Lambert inside this cave on behalf of the French School yielded an upper stratum of Classical date, followed immediately by a rich Neolithic layer. Finds included fragments of incised pottery, matt- painted brown or red or white, and white on brown; large vessels with rope patterns made by thumb pressure (Fig. 5); small artifacts, mostly of obsidian, and occasionally of flint; some small axes, and pestles of polished stone; a number of bone tools, such as chisels; and personal ornaments of beads and earrings, pierced sea-shells and bone plaques. Animal bones were very numerous in the lower level; goat and hare were most abundant, but wild boar,</page><page sequence="4">6 P. M. FRASER snakes, birds and fish and shell-fish are represented among the varied refuse of the kitchen. Outside the cave a pit dug in front of the entrance permitted observations on the volume of stalagmites of the original cave (now disappeared). Their in- terpretation, and the study of the fossilised fauna, can provide information on the climatic variations of the region at the end of the Quaternary period, and on the presence of human life on the Ripari Mountains before the Neolithic era. Lavrion. Kamariza, the village above Lavrion. P. Themelis, ibid., 9I-2 describes some of the remains in the valley below the deserted mining village, connected with the mine-working. I may refer also to the papers of K. Konophagos, 'H M9Oo6o; Toil' /u2AovztoaLogi Trv qesTzaAevudT'wov Tv dpEaiwv EAAvOwv e8; Trd nedarva 7AvvT pta t; AavpEswztKt; and of K. Kono- phagos and H.

The preliminary report of the fourth campaign of excavations of the Greco-Belgian team under D. Lazarides and H. Mussche has now been published (Thorikos 1966/1967, IV [1969]; see already the summary in AR 1968-69 6-7). of geometric design near the harbour, which he dates to the fifth century A.D. Euboea. Eretria. In ADelt 24 Chr I, 189-20o, P. Themelis publishes an account of excavations and investigations carried out in the city area in 1968. Traces of foundations of houses and other installa- tions, mostly of Hellenistic date, were found. Of particular interest was the discovery in one operation (No. 3) of c. I3 m. of the coastal section of the city- wall to a maximum height of I-40o. A late fourth century r.f. sherd in the packing of the wall gives a terminus post quem for its construction. Another excavation (No. 4), near the Geometric cemetery, yielded traces of a polygonal structure which Themelis suggests may have been a heroon of the third century, FIG. 5 Sounion. In ADelt 24 Chr I, 89-90o, P. Themelis publishes a fragment of an inscription found by a visitor on the west slope of the promontory. It apparently contains a deed of sale of land. The text of five lines is complete as to length, but a considerable amount is evidently missing on the right. It apparently belongs to the earlier part of the third century. Megara. In ADelt 24 Chr I, 81-88, Miss O. Alexandri reports on numerous minor discoveries in the city, resulting from rescue-operations, Aegina. City. In ADelt 24 Chr I, 99- oI, P. Lazarides records the discovery of a damaged mosaic FIG. 6 and another (No. 6) a small deposit of fourth century terracotta idols representing seated children, which Themelis identifies as offerings to Artemis. The section of the city-wall with tower running inside the Museum Garden was also identified (No. io) He also reports (No. 13) the uncovering of the mosaic of the Iseum discovered by Papadakis in 1915, a cor- rection to the inscription of which has been made by Ph. Bruneau, AK 12, 1969, 80-2. The Greco-Swiss excavations of 1968 are described by K. Schefold in ADelt 24 Chr I, 204-9, and in AK 12, 1969, 72-4, with particular reference to the discovery that the ditch with east-west orientation, running under the West Gate, was used in the early seventh century as a channel for the river which passed between the embankment-walls under the later Gate towards the east. Schefold regards this</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1970-71 7 as a unique structure for the archaic period, and suggests that the Eretrians may have had oriental models. Subsequently the channel was abandoned and the river flowed further south and was crossed by a bridge, while the old channel was closed by the construction of the Gate. It seems probable that the canalisation and re-routing was connected with an attempt to prevent silting up in the bay. Im- mediately south of the triangular 'heroon' (for which see now Cl. B6rard, Eretria, Fouilles et Recherches III, L'H'rdon da la porte de l'ouest) Cl. B6rard excavated an pit contained remains of funerary feasts and also archaic terracottas, including one (Fig. 6) of a goddess with a large head and scarcely modelled body which Berard regards as among the earliest of Greek terracottas, and a terracotta plaque with a lively representation of a trotting horse below which a fish swims, to which Berard assigns an early seventh century date and a Cycladic, perhaps a Melian, origin (Fig. 7). The oikos itself, belonging to the end of the seventh century, probably formed the locale of the commemorative reunions (AK, ibid., 74-79). Lefkandi. During June and July 1970 work was continued in the area of the Protogeometric cemetery under the joint direction of the British School at Athens represented by M. R. Popham and L. H. Sackett, and of the Greek Archaeological Service represented by P. G. Themelis. Mr Sackett writes: 'Deep ploughing during the winter had disturbed numerous pyres and tombs in the area between the Skoubris field and Toumba where tombs had been excavated previously (see AR 1969-70 8-9). Most of the time available was spent on clearing a large proportion of this cemetery, now named Palaia Perivolia-and in all 47 tombs and about the same number of pyres were found. The boundaries of the cemetery were established and it will be possible to make an estimate of the total number of burials made there. It is now clear that we have three separate cemeteries, close together and all in use during the Protogeometric period. The earliest is the cemetery of cist-graves in the Skoubris field, which began in the Sub-Mycenaean period, had its main period of use during the succeeding Protogeometric phase, but continued in sporadic use for shaft or pit graves down to the time of Attic Middle Geometric. FIG. 7 'oikos' of Geometric date, beneath which was a large sacrificial bothros which was continually filled after the final burial in the heroon (c. 650 B.c.). The FIG. 8</page><page sequence="6">8 P. M. FRASER The Palaia Perivolia cemetery contained only one cist-grave, the earliest burial yet found there, the majority being small shaft graves, mostly covered with stone slabs resting on a ledge cut in the rock. These were oriented roughly north-south, with the exception of a few large and comparatively rich graves FIG. 9 near the northern limit of the cemetery, which were orientated east-west. One of these (Tomb 21) contained an imported Attic pyxis of Attic Middle Geometric type; another (Tomb 22) included a Cypriot flask and a chest, probably from Attica. in a group of 32 vases. FIG. IO 'Two weeks were spent in extending work on the Toumba site, where a further 16 tombs and i8 pyres were found; these are contemporary with Palaia Perivolia, but the period of main use seems to have been the latest phase, overlapping Attic Early and Middle Geometric. It is noteworthy that a higher proportion of small objects (including weapons and jewellery) were found in this cemetery. 'From the three cemeteries there is now a body of some 650 vases and 499 other finds (Figs. 8 and 9). These include a number of imports (Fig. io), and it is possible to trace overseas connections, especially with Cyprus and the Near East. 'Cremation was the norm throughout the period of the cemeteries' use; with the burial was a token amount of cremated bone and the offerings in cists or shafts. Of a total of 150 tombs, only five were certain inhumations.' CORINTHIA AND ARGOLIS Isthmia. The University of California under Professor P. Clement carried out its fourth campaign at the Isthmian Sanctuary of Poseidon, under the auspices of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens. Investigations were begun in three areas: (a) in a field at the west end of Kyras Vrysi, south of the Hexamilia Road and not far from that part of the West Cemetery excavated on Lambrou property in 1967 and 1968; (b) in a field immediately east of the Temple of Poseidon; (c) on a section of the trans- Isthmus Wall (the Hexamilion), north-west of the Theatre, where the fortifications become involved with a Roman Bath (see plan in AR 1969-70 I I, fig. 15). (a) West Cemetery: Kyras Vrysi. Nine trenches were dug in all. In the three most northern, seven sarcophagus burials were discovered, none of which contained grave furniture of any sort. All seven graves lie west of a slightly curving rubble wall pre- sumably dated by a piece of a perirrhanterion rim and by a loomweight built into its fabric, the former of which has its counterpart in a perirrhanterion re- covered from the circular pit located south-west of the Temple of Poseidon and filled up apparently before 480-70, and the latter of which belongs to a class of loomweights dated 460-400 B.C. Since graves have so far appeared only on the west side of this wall, it may be a boundary wall for the cemetery of this area. No graves at all, however, were found along the southern two-thirds of the run of the wall cleared. In the same area an access shaft c. I o-oo m. deep ('Well A') to an elaborate underground water system was discovered. At the bottom of the shaft is a corri- dor oriented approximately north-west, from which four tunnels branch off, two towards the west, two in an easterly direction. FIG. II In this area Greek material predominates over Roman. Of II loomweights found all were from the fifth century B.C., and a scrap of Attic b.f. with head of warrior to left is worthy of note. From the fill in one trench came to small terracotta horse and rider, apparently of the fourth century B.C. (b) East Field. Varied finds were made in seven</page><page sequence="7">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1970-71 9 trenches in this field, and included a sherd with red glaze on both sides and the graffito IIETHNH, and numbers of Roman lamps, and coins, mostly of the third and fourth centuries A.D., found in fill of the trenches, in remains of houses, and in a trench which contained, in addition to numerous lamps, the snake-crater illustrated here (Fig. x ). Also in the tunnel entrance was a lamp with 12 nozzles, four handles for suspension, and a vine with grapes for decoration. (c) Trans-Isthmus Wall. The area west of the North Drain (see AR 1969-70 I I, fig. I5) was investigated, and a blocked-up gate discovered. From the gate the Wall con- tinues westward, and its course and structure in the neighbourhood of the Kyras Vrysi ravine were investigated. At the inside corner of the westermost bend in the Wall a multiple burial was discovered, built against the inner face of the Wall, which clearly antedates the grave. The grave was divided into irregular compart- FIG. 12 ments by a line of tile, and the whole burial was covered with tiles, among them one stamped HOEEIAdQNOE. One compart- ment of the grave contained two skeletons, the other eight. Objects in the latter compartment suggest a date in the fifth century after Christ for this grave. The situation here is similar to that at the north-east gate where a fifth-century grave was built against the inner face of the stairway ramp to the fighting-platform of the Trans-Isthmus wall. Several fragments of inscriptions were found in 1970, most from the Gully Bastion area of the Trans-Isthmus wall where they had formed part of the rubble fill. One, of which 25 fragmentary line3 survive, FIG. 13 is a decree of Imperial date, in honour of a benefactor. Another fragment, found near the Theatre, contains a list of properties, probably of the early third century B.C. (Fig. 12). Corinth. Excavations were carried out for the American School of Classical Studies in four areas: (a) in the Roman Forum around the Sacred Spring; (b) north of the Temple Hill; (c) in the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore on the north slope of Acrocorinth; (d) in the Gymnasium area. (a)Traces of Neolithic habitation were found on the cliff above the valley south of the Sacred Spring; filling operations were made in the valley in the Protogeometric period, and from the late Geometric period occupation was continuous until 146 B.C. A wall of late Geometric period supported a terrace which held a house which had passed through numerous phases of occupation, and originally consisted of at least five rooms; it was abandoned when the temenos of the Sacred Spring was expanded to the south FIG. 14</page><page sequence="8">IO P. M. FRASER (Fig. 13). Work on the spring house itself and the nearby area showed that the open area to the east was supplied in the classical period with grandstands, which were abandoned when the Hellenistic race course was laid out close by. At the east end of the Forum, immediately West of Temples H and J, the removal of Early Christian walls revealed road surfaces of the fourth and third centuries overlying late Neolithic levels. (b) The Demeter Sanctuary. A new area on the upper slope was excavated by Dr Bookides, revealing a stepped terrace or cavea carved in the bedrock, forming a theatral complex, apparently of the Roman period. South-east of the cavea the foundations of a structure of the Roman period were laid bare. The three buildings on the east side of the staircase, the excavation of which had been completed in 1969, were further investigated; the largest consisted of at least six rooms (Fig. 14). (c) On the north slope of the Temple Hill Dr H. Robinson continued his excavation of the terrace fills. Excavation has not been completed, but a fill at bed- rock contained a number of intact votive vases of the first quarter of the sixth century, including two early Corinthian palmette and lotus patterned aryballoi and a warrior aryballos, which must have been among the latest offerings of the pre-sixth century temple. In FIG. 15 the area immediately north of the sixth century temple a deposit of late Geometric and early Protogeo- metric pottery was found covering the prehistoric fill. On the north side of the temple a small fragment of a boustrophedon inscription was found in late fill. Kraneion. Work on the basilica of Kraneion, near the Kenchrean gate, was recommenced this year, after a long break, by Professor Pallis (A.S.). The liturgical annexes north of the narthex, including the baptisterion, were cleared in whole or in part, and the excavation of the narthex itself completed. A rectangular court on the south of the basilica, first discovered in 1937, was further investigated (Ergon 1970, 87-90). Argolid. Phlius. Work was resumed by the Uni- versity of Missouri for the American School of Class- ical Studies on the site previously excavated in 1924. The main building, the 'Palati', was re-cleared, and its interior arrangement studied. A row of bases consisting of a Doric column-drum and plinth cut from the same block of stone was found on the east side of the structure (Fig. x5). Mycenae. Excavations at Mycenae in 1970 (A.S.) were continued by Professor G. Mylonas in two sectors on the north-west side of the acropolis, in completion of the work carried out in 1966 and 1968. (a) In sector A the threshold at the south-east corner of Tsountas' House was completely uncovered, together with part of the eastern wall of the street leading to it. At its southern corner the street turned a right angle to the east and formed a level space from which rose a large staircase of which parts of eight FIG. 16 treads are preserved. A grain store containing pithoi and stamnoi was discovered on the east side of the staircase. (b) In sector B, the northern part of the deposit left by Tsountas along the eastern side of the Hellenistic tower of the western cyclopic wall was investigated. The mouth of a well was found immediately below the present ground level, in a corner of the room which contained a fixed washing bowl and a stone basin. On the eastern side of the room was a quadri- lateral structure and an upturned pithos, both used for drainage purposes. The deposit below the pithos, of LH IIIC date, contained sherds and structures belonging to three phases of construction. This confirms the conclusion reached in 1968 that the LH IIIC phase lasted longer than is commonly thought, at least for three generations. Below 3 - 30 m. the deposit was of LH IIIB date. Many sherds of</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1970-71 II this date were found, of which the most notable belong to a krater-shaped vase with representations of chariots and charioteers. FIG. 17 Two important fragments of frescoes were found in one section of the southern part of the deposit: a fragment of a figure-of-eight shield (Fig. x6), and an excellently preserved fragment of the upper part of a female figure, of first-rate execution. The excavation of the room to which the frescoes belong, will, it is FIG. 18 hoped, be completed in 1971; its destruction is assigned to the end of the LH IIIB period, or to the transitional period, LH IIIB-C (Ergon 1970, 94-100). Nauplion, suburb of Pronoia. Remains of a Neo- lithic and Early Helladic settlement have been found on this hill, which is on the land side of Palamidi. The region is pitted with cavernous holes, leading at times to underground chambers, and probably corresponds to the location described by Strabo (369, 373) as 'the caves and the man-made Labyrinth near Nauplia, which they call Cyclopean' (AAA 1971,1, Io-II). Argos. The excavations of the French School at Argos (Sector D) continued in the Refugees' Quarter area on the road to Tripolis. The Roman insula constructed in the fourth century and reconstructed in the fifth and sixth centuries was fully excavated. In the fifth century the street bordering the insula was transformed into a portico (Fig. 17). Some 25-30 cm. below the Roman level a stratum of eighth cen- tury was discovered. Traces of Hellenistic building were very slight. A wall associated with early filling of the seventh century was cleared to a total length of 25 m. The area enclosed contained some tombs with late Geometric (Fig. x8) and early Archaic pottery. At the neighbouring site of the Aphrodision consolidation of the middle Helladic and Mycenaean remains were carried out. The removal of the steps of the Roman period in front of the temple brought to light the whole east facade and the chronology of the Archaic terrace was ascertained. In the Anagnostopoulos property (see BCH 92, 1968, fig. I) further work clarified the chronology of the area. South of the sounding of 1969, the road seems to have extended beyond the limits of the pro- perty. Coins found on the surface indicate that the street was abandoned by the fifth century. To the north a deep sounding brought to light deep and well- built walls of which the earliest seem to be of the first century B.c., and to be connected with the bath situated south of the large stoa of the Agora. Asine. Excavations were resumed here after an interval of 40 years by the Swedish Institute in Athens. Twelve trial trenches were dug some oo00 m. east of the Acropolis, just above the beach. Below the surface layers Geometric foundations were encoun- tered, and in an upper layer a child burial contained a kotyle of Corinthian date, a period not represented in the earlier excavations. Protogeometric layers were rich in pottery fragments. Below this level was a Protogeometric cemetery of child burials dug into Submycenaean and Mycenaean layers. Mycenaean pottery of LH IIIC date was richly represented in the Mycenaean strata. A Middle Helladic cemetery of cist graves was uncovered below the Mycenaean level. Porto Cheli. Excavations at Halieis were continued in 1970 under Professor M. Jameson of the University ofPennsylvania. The citywall anddthe east tower were further investigated, and inside the city wall, south- west of the east tower, excavation revealed continu- ous habitation from the late Geometric period to the fourth century B.C. In the north-east area of the harbour of Porto Cheli remains lying at a depth of I-50 m. were shown to be the site of a complex of buildings of the Archaic period surviving into the early fifth century, and probably a sanctuary. Two buildings were investigated, one of which (Building I, apparently a temple), yielded a very large amount of Corinthian and Attic pottery and bone and bronze objects, and a hoard of 18 Aeginetan 'turtles' and some sculptural fragments of a nude male figure. No pottery or other object later than the second quarter of the fifth century was found, and there were</page><page sequence="10">12 P. M. FRASER FIG. 19 traces of destruction by fire, which may be connected with the Athenian attack of 459 B.c. An upper date is suggested by a Protocorinthian aryballos of the second quarter of the seventh century or earlier. Near Building 2, a large structure in the shape of a stoa, are the foundations of a monumental altar of poros, possibly surmounted by a canopy. The area k *r: r* i FIG. 20 round the altar is limited to the south by the starting- line of a race track, consisting of rectangular slabs of limestone with parallel grooves for the feet of the runners. Associated structures were also investigated. A fragment of a Laconian stirrup crater in the fill used in the construction of the race course suggests that it must be later than the middle or third quarter of the sixth century. The sanctuary may have been that of the principal deity of Halieis, Apollo. ARCADIA TO ELIS Elis. City of Elis. The rescue operations carried out in 1968 on the site of ancient Elis, with a view to finding the least harmful route for the central channel of the Peneus dam, covered a wide area between the eastern and western necropoleis, which are about 2 km. apart, and the boundaries of the city were securely fixed. Over 400 graves were opened, and much information acquired regarding the archi- FIG. 21 mirrors and coins, but one grave contained gold jewellery of high quality. Many of the terracottas, which seem to be local products, are of very fine workmanship. Two marble heads of Germanicus and of Nero in excellent condition were also found (ADelt 24 Chr I, 152-4). The joint excavation of N. Yialouris and Mrs Leon- Mitsopoulou (A.S.) was again concentrated in 1970 on the theatre, where the excavation of the koilon continued, and the existence of a brick analemma and a well-built stone drainage-channel was estab- lished; the channel contained pottery fragments of the fourth and third centuries B.c. (Ergon 1970, 132- 8). Excavations carried out in 1970 by Miss Karayiorga brought to light a series of three pottery kilns of an unusual form, each of which is two storied and circu- lar. The lower section below ground was formed like a well with brick sides, with an opening for the in- sertion of the heating material, while above ground there was only the semi-circular rotunda (Fig. 2x). The perforated circular hearth itself rests on a ledge round the circular chamber, and is supported by a substantial cylindrical post of compressed clay strengthened with broken potsherds. Miss Karayi- orga explains the operation of the kiln and compares it with material from Olympia. (AAA 1971, I, 27-31). Messenia. Messene. Professor Orlandos' excava- tions, recommenced in 1969 (AR 1969-70 15-16), were continued in 1970. The main purpose was the completion of the excavation of the Doric Temple in the centre of the tetrastyle court. The excavation of its eastern part brought to light the lowest course of the crepis, and parts of the foundations and lowest courses, including the stylobate and fragments of the toichoibate, on the southern side were discovered (Fig. 22). On the eastern side the paving of the tecture of tombs and the burial-customs of the Eleans. The majority of the burials were pithos-burials and cist-graves with brick sides, dating from the fourth century to the middle Hellenistic period (Fig. 19); others were covered with tiles, and others were cist- graves with stone blocks for walls. Of particular interest is a large cist-grave, surrounded by a cir- cular peribolos (Fig. 2o). Considerable sections of the Roman city were also uncovered. Smallfindsfrom the tombs were mainly terracotta statuettes, bronze</page><page sequence="11">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1970-71 13 altar which seems to have undergone successive modifications. East of the altar the stylobate of a long line of Corinthian columns was encountered, running parallel to the short side of the temple, and forming the inner row of columns of the double stoa of which the outer row of columns formed the tetrastyle court itself. Traces of corres- ponding inner rows were found on the other sides of the central temple, each with their own drain course. Fragments of the poros architraves of the stoa were found; the decoration consisted of a continuous series ofphialai and bucrania. Among the few inscriptions found was an Early Imperial dedication by the city of Thurioi in honour of a woman of Messene named Kallikratis (Ergon 1970, I oo-31). Laconia. Sparta. In ADelt 24 Chr I, 131-4 A. Delivorrias describes some sculptures in Sparta Museum. Acquis- itions include the trunk of an archaic warrior, assigned to the seventh century, and a female figure wearing peplos, of the classical period, found in the sea near Monemvasia (Fig. 23), an import prob- ably from Ioni 1. Work continued in 1968 on the shrine discovered in 1967 on the banks of the Eurotas (see AAA 1968, I, 41 ff.), and some 18 m. of the external wall were uncovered without encountering a second cross-wall. A door was discovered at the north-west end. On the floor were found two comic masks and a terracotta FIG. 22 FIG. 23 pronaos and the cella, resting on poros foundations, was found. Among objects found were an epistyle block and some fragments of inscriptions. A series of dedicatory bases was uncovered on the south side of the temple and on the east a rectangular FIG. 24</page><page sequence="12">14 P. M. FRASER statue of a Dioscurus, and, in the debris of the fallen wall, a fragment of a late archaic relief of the type of the seated chthonic deity or heroized persons. The relief had been re-used in the later walls which were constructed to serve as terrace-walls. The store-pit containing a quantity of domestic pottery was cleared, and it was confirmed that it was constructed in the first century B.C. In the bottom of the pit and at a point corresponding to that at which the 'tombstone' was found in 1967, a tomb was discovered, formed of tiles and covered with stone slabs. Delivorrias FIG. 25 stresses the importance of the discovery of the shrine for the history of Laconian religion, and particularly of the cult of heroes described by Pausanias. The shrine seems to have remained in use throughout antiquity. (ibid. 134-5)- Phoinikion. The chance discovery of an archaic poros Doric capital near the site of the shrine of Apollo Hyperteleatas led to the discovery of the largely destroyed foundations of a building perhaps to be identified with the temple itself (the known bronze objects from the site were mostly found in the 'Lakka tou Chasanaga' near the temple). A number of fragments of sixth and fifth century vases, mostly black glaze kylikes, were found (ibid. 138-9). Mani. Caves of Dreros. The excavation of the great caves of Dreros (Alepopetra) between Areopolis and Gerolimena discovered by Mr and Mrs Petro- cheilou in 1958, was begun by the Archaeological Service (G. Papathanasopoulos), in 197o, and much varied pottery of the late Neolithic period recovered on the surface. In lower levels of chamber A numerous middle Neolithic sherds were found, along with stone and bone utensils, while in the upper levels human bones were more frequent. Chamber B contained nine layers of earth deposit and, in the seventh layer, a perfectly preserved skeleton in a burial pit (Fig. 24). In the late Neolithic period the FIG. 26 cave was evidently closed by the force of an earth- quake, and much skeletal material was discovered. Other finds include a marble head of an idol (Fig. 25), a schist brooch, and spearheads in obsidian and pyrites. Mr Papathanasopoulos concludes that the cave was inhabited for the whole of the later Neolithic period (4000-3000 B.c.), though the lower levels contain earlier material and some of the sherds of the level immediately below the stalagmites may be of the transitional period between Neolithic and Early Bronze age. (AAA 1970, I, 12-26). CENTRAL GREECE Boeotia. Thebes. The discovery in spring 1971 of a large chamber-tomb with dromos, and with pre- FIG. 27 served frescoes, on the circular hill of Kastelli (facing the new Gymnasion) on the further side of the Ismenos river-bed, must rank among the most important archaeological discoveries of recent years. The tomb, cut in the sandstone of the hill, is approached by two long, parallel dromoi, and consists of two compartments separated by a dividing wall. The benches round the walls, and the walls themselves,</page><page sequence="13">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1970-71 15 are decorated with frescoes, the first to be found in a Mycenaean tomb. The tomb had been robbed, but among a few other objects which remained was a fine ivory pyxis with representations of four winged sphinxes, which, through the kindness of Mr Th. Spyropoulos, I am able to reproduce here (Fig. 26) (Eleftheros Kosmos 6 May; 5, 26 June 1971). In AAA 1971, 1, 32-7, Th. Spyropoulos publishes a preliminary notice of his excavations in 1970 in the central Mycenaean palace area in Thebes (Cadmeia) and of the discovery of the Linear B tablets (cf. AAA I970, 62). He challenges Keramopoullos' interpre- tation of the remains excavated by him in I906 as representing a structure of the Cretan, rather than the Peloponnesian, type, as based on the assumption that he had excavated the main palace area. He maintains that his excavation in the centre of the Cadmeia, which brought to light part of its palace archive, west of the area excavated by Keramopoullos, has uncovered the western limit of the palace area, and that consequently the problem of its structural form must be reconsidered. Rescue operations were carried out in 1968 on 20 other sites. Reports of the most important of these, particularly those of Mycenaean date, were held over In the other sector 17 Classical graves (inhumation and cremation) were found in the same level as, and sometimes below, the Archaic necropolis, which had probably fallen into disuse in the Classical period (ADelt 24 Chr I, 175-7). A quantity of black glaze ware and idols was found, and in one cremation- grave a layer of eggshells was found above the ashes (ADelt 24 Chr I, 175-7). Tanagra. In the course of 1970 work continued (A.S.) on the Mycenaean necropolis of Tanagra I1IG. 29 FIG. 28 for further work to be carried out in 1969, and for further study. Only one excavation (No. 2), in which more Mycenaean fresco fragments were found, requires mention here (for previous frescoes see AAA 1968, I, I I, and colour plate); a more detailed publi- cation of this material will follow (ADelt 24 Chr i, I75-84). A small fragment of a vase or larnax found on the surface on a plot in Pindarou Street, carries a vivid representation of fishes in a net (Fig. 27). It is assigned to the 'Palace Style' period (ADelt 24 Chr I, 177-83). In the suburb of Pyri excavation of the Archaic necropolis continued (cf. AR 1968-69 18); no further graves were found in the two sectors excavated, but in one quantities of late Neolithic sherds were found beneath undisturbed levels, thus demonstrating the location of the, or a, Neolithic settlement of Thebes. FIG. 30 (AR 1969-70 16-I7). More than 30 chamber tombs were discovered, some of LH IIIA date, and a rich harvest of pottery (Fig. 28) and bronze utensils and weapons and five seal stones. In addition four more painted larnakes were found including one showing the burial of the deceased in the larnax in the presence of weeping women. In all, more than 30 larnakes have so far been found, of which 20 are decorated (Ergon 1970, 13-22). Phocis. Corycian Cave. In 1970 the French School under its Director, P. Amandry, began the excavation of this cave sacred to Pan and the Nymphs. Habi- tation from the Neolithic period onwards was estab- lished. The Neolithic level included crude and painted pottery of all Neolithic periods, some terra- cotta figurines and flint and obsidian figurines. Above the Neolithic level was a stratum completely lacking in remains; above this was an upper layer containing disturbed finds of all periods from late Mycenaean to the third century B.C., except the eleventh to seventh centuries. The majority of the offerings date from</page><page sequence="14">16 P. M. FRASER FIG. 31 the sixth to the third centuries. Pottery included hundreds of aryballoi, Corinthian alabastra and kotyoli, and Attic lekythoi. The most remarkable find was an Attic pinax of the sixth century with a painted representation of a dance of Satyrs and Maenads. The thousands of figurines, animal and human, are mostly of Attic, Corinthian and Boeotian fabric. Other objects included a marble statue of Pan, and a bronze statuette representing a squatting infant, his right hand on a tortoise (Fig. 29). In the soil were about I6,ooo knuckle-bones, some with a hole cut in them. Some also carried a letter or the name of a divinity or hero (Fig. 30). Galaxidi. Miss Y. Nikopoulou reports, in ADelt 24 Chr I, 2 14-I5, on the discovery of a cave named 'Ancona' east of Galaxidi, in which a superficial examination yielded a large amount of sherds and terracottas ranging from the seventh century to the Hellenistic period. THESSALY Demetrias. The 'German Archaeological Ex- cavations' team in Thessaly, under the leadership of Professor V. Milojdi', continued its work in 1970. As in 1969, operations were concentrated on the Pefkakia-Magoula settlement on the coast, on the area of the Macedonian palace, and on the early basilica. (I) On Pefkakia- Magoula (Neleia) the excavations on the south of the hill were continued, and more cist-graves belonging to the Helladic cemetery were found (cf. AR 1968-69 20). In the eastern sector Middle Helladic dwellings were found below the necropolis. One house rested on the well- preserved remains of another which consisted of a series of rooms with central hearths. The entrance was through a funnel-shaped room on the west (Fig. 31), and the house was separated from its neighbours by a narrow passage way; two phases of construction were discernible. The pottery discovered in the large central room included Minyan matt-painted ware; one matt-painted amphora is probably an Aeginetan import, and the Minyan vessels are, in part at least, Boeotian imports. Of particular significance were fragments of Trojan and Cycladic vases and a fine frag- ment of a Kamares-style vase. The picture of close mercantile connections as far as Troy and Crete is thus confirmed. It is hoped to fulfil one of the aims of the expedi- tion by establishing by means of the Cretan fragments a link between the phases of Thessalian culture and Egyptian chronology. On the north-west slope of the hill further buildings were excavated which probably sloped towards the sea on terraces. Here, in addition to rich finds of the Rachmani period, numerous imports were again found. From the Rachmani period storage vessels of raspberry colour painted in an encrusted style are noteworthy, as also numerous idols, some partly of painted marble and others of terracotta. Ceramic fragments of Trojan type were also found in stratified layers. Fragments of EH II saucers occurred in the : i;;;i~ nr:^r ----;---_- - ItI~~~::~ ql-~- it " DEMETiAS, DAMOKIAT(A- EZiFK IAV STAItN -  Soadtnwm~aik ffir"S"i MMarmot Z ?--- W..dw.tr.. J,.

Here too numerous imports promised clarification of the rela- tions of the Rachmani culture to the other Aegean cultures. (2) The terrace on the west of the palace was examined stratigraphically and many fragments of the faCade of the palace-bases of half columns, column-drums and fragments of pilasters, all of excellent workmanship, were discovered. Within the terrace more walls were brought to light, and periods of construction could be ascertained from the deposits which contained much early Hellenistic pottery in- cluding polychrome ware of good quality; later deposits contained characteristic types including stamped ware. After the destruction of the palace, which did not have a long life, the terrace was used for later buildings. (3) The basilica and its associated buildings were almost completely cleared. The basilica appears to belong to different periods (Fig. 32). The earliest structure was the eastern part of the three- naved basilica which joined with the west wall which survives under the mosaics. This structure must have remained open for some time, since there was a layer of dark earth between the underside of the mosaic and the yellow soil of the fill above it. At that time the building was first decorated with mosaics through the generosity of a woman named Damo- cratia (a common Thessalian name). The church was subsequently enlarged and five entrances were opened on the west; subsequently again a narthex was added, with another mosaic provided by Damo- cratia, and a courtyard with a fountain joined to it, the surrounding passages of which were also covered with mosaics. To the west of the courtyard again an entrance hall of two storeys was added and north of the church more rooms were added later, including a baptisterion with two baptismal baths. A number of re-used inscriptions found in the presbyterium, including manumissions and dedicatory inscriptions, will be published by Professor Habicht. Further work on the city plan of the Hellenistic period was carried out, and its Hippodamian plan established (Fig. 33). Pelion. Preliminary excavations of a cave on the north-west foothills of Pelion, at a point 200 m. above sea level, below the summit 'Vigla', revealed an un- disturbed deposit at the entrance which yielded evi- dence of palaeolithic occupation, including numerous pieces of elephant tusk, and a bone brooch with anthropomorphic head (ADelt 24 Chr 2, 222-3). Ossa. At a height of 8oo00 m., near the village of Spelia, a partially plundered small Mycenaean tholos was excavated (cf. already AAA 1969, 2, 165-7), constructed of small slab-shaped stones, in the manner of a large tholos tomb. Finds in the tomb, in addition to the male skeleton, included an alabastron, a three-eared pyxis of red clay and a lentoid seal stone of steatite with a representation of a goat and branches. The vases are of LH IIIA2/BI date. Dr Theochares writes: 'The finds are certainly meagre for a tholos tomb, but so typically Mycenaean that we must suppose the complete "Mycenaeanisa- tion" of this somewhat inaccessible area' (ADelt 24 Chr 2, 223). Nea Anchialos. The late Roman necropolis north- east of the hill of Pyrasos, first excavated by G. Soteriou, was further investigated as a result of road- widening in the area.

EPIRUS NVome of Ioannina. Dodona. St. Dakares' excavations at Dodona (A.S.) in 1970 were once again concen- trated on the bouleuterion. The sloping area north of the altar of Charops, where the Assembly of the Epirote League met, was investigated, and most of the outline of the semicircular seating area uncovered. North of the circumference of this area, the curved pi-shaped building discovered in 1969 was fully ex- posed, and its destruction-level of 167 B.C. identified in the upper layers of the fill (Ergon 1970, 70-7). Mazaraki. A rich LH IIIB cist-grave was dis- covered by chance in this area. It contained three skeletons, and a considerable quantity of Mycenaean and local pottery and weapons (Fig. 34) which pro- vide a valuable chronological indication of the pene- tration of Mycenaean colonisation in the interior of Epirus (ADelt 24 Chr 2, 252-3; AE 1969, 191-4 (full publication)). Zagori. Excavation of the large necropolis and settlement at Vitsa continued in 1968, under Mrs Vokotopoulou (cf. AR 1969-70 18). Twenty-eight tombs of Geometric, Archaic and Classical date were excavated. The nearby settlement was also further investigated (ADelt 24 Chr 2, 250-2). Arta. In ADelt 24 Chr 2, 246-7 (cf. already AAA 1969, I, 42-3) Mrs Vokotopoulou publishes the results of excavation in the centre of Arta in 1968, when further remains of the large Archaic temple were brought to light. In the area excavated, the temple lay beneath a large number of tile-covered Christian burials. The most significant discovery was of a poros Doric capital the echinus of which resembles that of the temple of Aphaia on Aigina and the second poros temple of Athena Pronaia at Delphi. The temple may probably there be dated c. 500 B.c. IONIAN ISLANDS Kerkyra. In ADelt 24 Chr 2, 258-9, P. Kalligas gives an account of the arrangement of the new museum in Kerkyra, as it was in 1968. Cephallenia. Krane. P. Kalligas has described his investigations in 1968 on the two hills of the acropolis of ancient Krane, on the edge of the lagoon of Kout- avos. Much of the walls on the north hill and other architectural fragments have disappeared, but he publishes a stepped base containing a dedication to Demeter and Kore there, which indicates that the main FIG. 35</page><page sequence="17">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1970-71 19 temple was dedicated to Demeter. He describes the exiguous remains of the temple (Classical) and adja- cent stoa (Roman) on the western hill, and the better preserved acropolis wall with two gates. Near the temple a prehistoric deposit containing pyrites and monochrome handmade Bronze Age pottery was discovered. Pronnos. Similar investigations were carried out at Pronnos at the southern end of the island. Here too the once well-preserved walls have greatly FIG. 36 deteriorated. Prehistoric sherds were also found. Three late archaic tombstones from the nearby acropolis, now in Argostoli Museum, are welcome additions to our knowledge of the early alphabet of the island. Other remains in the island are also described by Kalligas, ibid., notably the foundations of the temple by the Skala Ayiou Georgiou, first investigated by Professor Marinatos. Lefkas. P. Kalligas reports the discovery of a cave 'Choirotrypa' near Lefkas, superficial investigation of which has yielded sherds and objects ranging from the prehistoric to the Hellenistic period. A roughly worked archaic funerary stele from the necropolis at Frankokklesia carries the name 'Apx~e--(ADelt 24 Chr 2, 271-8). MACEDONIA Thessalonike. Museum. Ph. Petsas reports in ADelt 24 Chr 2, 291 ff., on new acquisitions during 1968. They include a remarkably varied collection of an- tiquities seized by the Security Department, including 50 early Minoan seals, Cycladic idols, Mycenaean stirrup-jars and an excellently preserved Cretan Daedalic pithos (Fig. 35) and many other objects of various epochs. City. Further work was carried out in 1968 on the 'Galerian Complex' (i.e. the whole group of buildings of that date, recorded under modern street names). In the central area of this complex (in Dem. Gounari Street) remains were found of a crypto- porticus with marble paving and wall revetments, FIG. 37 ofwhich Petsas has published a reconstruction in'Apcata MIaKeovia (Papers of Sympos. of 26-29 August Iq68), 227 and plan. Petsas also reports on the discovery of new sections of the city wall, and on Roman baths found in Olympou Street. New tombs and funerary reliefs were found during building operations in the area of the western necropolis. One remarkably well- executed funerary relief with a scene of parting carries a bilingual inscription (cf. AR 1969-70 20 and fig. 34) (Fig. 36). One relief (Fig. 37) representing the deceased, Crescens, driving a cart has a very interesting inscription, indicating that the monument had been erected by the avv?'Ota "Hpwovog A~o3wvitov under its dpXtavvdywyog. Nome of Pella. Edessa-Aigai. Petsas' excavations in the lower city of Aigai ('Longos') in 1968 un- covered part of the city wall of the old Macedonian capital including a gate with a tower (ADelt 24 Chr 2, 305-6; see id. in 'ApXala MaKe&amp;ovia, 203-19, for a full report).

FRASER which included (No. 2) the uncovering of an elaborate Roman well-foundation or Roman bath with paved floor and colonnade of the third century A.D., of which fragments of the colonnade with its epistyle were found. A considerable number of inscriptions and architectural and other fragments which were dis- persed in the city, built into houses, etc., have now been concentrated in the museum of Verria (ADelt 24 Chr 2, 315-20). Vergina. The excavations of Professors G. Bakalakis and N. Andronikos continued in the palace area, particularly in the sector between the south wall of the palace and the external 'toothed' wall. Five more rooms newly excavated and in the peristyle court the south wing of a further peristyle court, which seems to have formed an 'emergency' extension of the palace itself. The central court was demarcated on each side by rectangular bases which supported wooden pillars. On the outside of the toothed wall fifth and fourth century sherds were found, whereas in the rooms newly excavated and in the peristyle court the pottery was Hellenistic, especially West Slope Ware. The palace itself the excavators assign to the first quarter of the third century B.C. and the 'extension' to the later third or early second century, and they suggest that its hurried technique may reflect the troubled time of the first appearance of Roman forces in Macedonia (ADelt 24 Chr 2, 336-9). Pindus area. In AAA 1971, I, 37-42, Miss K. Rhomiopoulou reports on her excavation of early Iron Age burials at Spelaion near Grevena in August 1970. A number of pit-graves were opened and metal fibulae and necklaces and other objects dated by Miss Rhomiopoulou to not later than the ninth century, were found in the graves. EASTERN MACEDONIA Amphipolis. Excavation of the Basilicas A and P by E. Stikas (A.S.) continued in 1970. The exonar- thex of Basilica A was discovered to be covered with mosaics of the elaborate type now familiar from this structure. The excavation of the atrium adjoining the exonarthex, also containing excellent mosaics with representations of birds and fishes, was completed. In Basilica F the excavation of the room south of the narthex, also paved with mosaics, was continued. In the excavations a Hellenistic base was found bearing the names of Edynopiov ntyue~lral, together with their ypaiuatar'Es, presumably magistrates of Amphipolis (Ergon 1970, 33-47). Mrs Ch. Koukouli (ADelt 24 Chr 2, 355) reports the discovery of a number of funerary reliefs from Am- phipolis, now in Kavalla Museum. One, which she dates to the end of the fourth century, is inscribed 'Epavrao/ NLKdvspov/ ipeta tr "Iz o0G. That is of in- terest, for, if the date is correct, this evidence for the adoption of the cult of Isis by Greeks must be among the earliest from the Greek mainland, for at Athens and Eretria the persons concerned with the cult are ol Abyw'tzot. Amphipolis. Members of the American School have conducted a salvage operation on the blocks of the Lion monument which had been left on the banks of the Strymon when the bridge was built in 1930. The blocks (380 in all) have been assembled on the site. Nome of Kavalla. Philippi. Professor Pelekanides' excavation (A.S.) of the 'Octagon' was continued in 1970. More rooms of the Episkopeion were cleared and studied, and the structure of the eastern part of the building was determined. A street on its east side was also further excavated and remains of its tiled drainage system brought to light. Further FiG. 38 work was also carried out on the entrance porch of the atrium of the church existing on the site before the Octagon was built (Ergon 1970, 48-58). Kepia. Mrs Koukouli gives an advance notice in ADelt 24 Chr 2, 318-I9, of the discovery in 1968 on a hill at Kepia, I km. north of the Kavalla-Salonica road on the slopes of Mt Pangaion, of an extensive shrine, with perhaps a settlement, shown by dedica- tory inscriptions to be a sanctuary of the rider god Heron-Aulonites. She suggests that this was the main shrine of the god, on account both of the number of dedications found and of the preservation of the name 'Auli' for a neighbouring village. THRACE Mesembria. A. Vavritsas' excavations at ancient Mesembria (A.S.) continued in 1970 on the sector of fortified settlement on the city wall and in the acro- polis (Ergon 1970, 58-70). CYCLADES Kea, Hagia Irini. Supplementary excavations were carried out in 1970 by the University of Cincinnati under Professor J. L. Caskey. He writes: 'A wall in cyclopean masonry, MG, had been re- corded in 1968. It runs roughly N.N.W.-S.S.E. apparently athwart the approach to the main gate in Area G, and its remaining blocks are largely below modern sea-level. Further investigation this year, carried on in the mud with constant pumping, showed that the wall turns at an obtuse angle and</page><page sequence="19">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1970-7I 21 runs toward the eastern corner of Tower g, which flanks the gateway. The juncture (if ever there was one) is not preserved; a tomb, No. 58, intervenes. 'Tomb 58 is rectangular, built of stones neatly laid (Fig. 38). It is made up of a compartment on the north which probably gave access from above, and the tomb chamber itself on the south. Between them is a dividing wall, with a doorway at its western end. The total space occupied by the two parts is roughly I - 50 m. by 2 - 50. The chamber was roofed by big slabs of stone, some of which were found cracked and sagging or fallen. It had a flooring of two large well-cut slabs fitted into the inner face of the side walls and held up by a supporting wall, evi- dently to provide a hollow space below. The door- way was found loosely blocked by stones. On the floor were ten small pots, not precisely datable but probably belonging to an early phase of the great settlement of this site, corresponding to MM III in Crete. No human bones were recognised. 'Relative chronology of the structures in this area is not easy to understand. At first glance one sup- poses that the builders of the tomb destroyed part of the cyclopean wall (which is bedded deeper by a metre or more); but the presence of potsherds of LM I types at lower levels suggests, on the contrary, that the cyclopean builders may have come upon the walls of the tomb and abandoned or changed their plan. The problem is complicated by the fact that the ground in this region was not horizontal at the time in question and that sloping strata can rarely be ob- served in the mud, and also by the presence of the much later (Graeco-Roman?) retaining wall, A, which cuts through the region from north to south. Further study of the pottery may bring us nearer to a solution. 'It is clear in any case that there was a long suc- cession of buildings. At least one wall, associated with pottery of the Middle Bronze Age, is based on bedrock 2 53 m. below modern sea level. Part of a rect- angular structure, probably another tomb, antedates Tomb 58. East of the latter, at a higher level, is an arc or curving wall which may perhaps have marked a precinct or bordered a tumulus over the graves. Wall MG, which we had assigned tentatively to LH III and thought possibly to be a breakwater against encroachment of the sea after earthquakes of the fifteenth and fourteenth centuries, now appears surely to be older. The purpose it served remains obscure. Above all these remains have been found walls, graves, and indications of the changing shoreline in Classical Greek and Roman times and as late as the Byzantine period. 'In the course of work in the eastern sector, Room XIII, the last which is preserved in the series along the fortification wall from the gateway to the sea, was uncovered and examined. Like the others, it appears to have been used and altered or rebuilt in successive stages from an early phase of the major settlement down to the time of the great earthquake of LM IB/LH II. Beyond it there may have been still another room, XIV; but here at the pebbly beach beside the water we were not able to dig farther. 'To the west of Tower NE, in the angle where the later face of the great fortification wall turns north- ward, remains of a circular lime kiln were uncovered in 1961. This had been used in late Roman or By- zantine times, presumably to reduce the good lime- stone blocks of the old wall and tower, plentiful just here. In 1970 we removed it, revealing the fortifica- tions to a height of - go m. and exposing an opening in the masonry through which a drain had issued. Around and under the kiln there was pottery of the LM IB/LH II period, including more than ,000ooo conical cups. 'From the end of House C (on the western side of the town) a series of four rooms ran northward to the fortification wall in the late Bronze Age. In the third of these a deep sounding in 1968 had exposed the inner face of the older defensive wall, DJ, and a drain running through it at the bottom. This year the partition between the third and second rooms was taken out and the whole space excavated, in an effort to learn more about the stratification and sequence of pottery styles in the early phases of the Middle Bronze Age. We came in turn upon habitation deposits with much gray and black ash, then remains of an oven or small potter's kiln, and, ultimately, the earliest strata, with many fallen stones. In the south wall of a room or enclosed area at this depth there is a drain corresponding with the one in Wall DJ. Just below it was found a house wall of the Early Bronze Age, which could be tested in a small pit down to its footing below present water level. 'Preliminary inspection of the pottery from this sounding and comparison with that found in other areas nearby show that fine Cycladic red burnished ware, with its brown, gray and black counterparts, began early in the Middle Bronze Age and continued to be made, in decreasing quantities, down to the later phases. Gray Minyan ring-stemmed goblets, and big barrel-shaped jars in Matt-painted ware also occur early, along with a few bits of eggshell Kamares ware, but are not equally distributed in all regions of the town. Importation of Middle Minoan pots with coatings of dark glaze, sometimes in trickled patterns, increased as time went on. A development can be traced in the Cycladic carinated bowls with one handle, from early dark burnished wares to later soft gray and buff fabrics. Cups of the Keftiu shape in plain ware and other forerunners of cup shapes which were to be very common in the LM/LH period at Ayia Irini are seen to have been made locally before the time of the great fortifications (MM III). 'Architectural remains of House F and the ceramic evidence for its date were reviewed in 1970. The main block of the building, made up of six rooms in a row, appears simple but presents many problems. Rooms I-V (numbered from the north) were deep cellars, but the earthen floor of Room VI was at ground level; Room I had its own descending stair- case, whereas II-V were accessible only from VI, which also contained a flight of steps upward. 'During examination of the western outer face of House F near its south end, Early Bronze Age walls were uncovered at a surprisingly high level, leading to</page><page sequence="20">22 P. M. FRASER discovery of additional parts of the important complex seen in 1969. South-east of E.B.A. Room IV there remains a corner of a room which we call VI and south-east of E.B.A. Room III is another, called VII. These are not yet fully excavated. Three stages of construction are represented; the earliest may be contemporary with House E (E.B.A. Rooms I and II), the second with E.B.A. Rooms III-V, and the third firming the conclusion, reported last year, that this late stage followed the period of the sauceboat (EH II/EC II) at Ayia Irini, though without a sharp break in continuity or violent destruction.' Thera. Akroteri. Professor Marinatos' excavation at Akroteri in 1970 (A.S.) was aimed at clearing the area linking the most northerly and most southerly sector. As in the other sectors, the buildings of this area (A) were mostly preserved to two levels. The building complex was entered by a courtyard, from which a wide door led to a small ante-chamber, whence a stone staircase led to an upper storey. Of the other rooms in the building, one contained several doors, between which were stacked upright pithoi buried in the pumice. One small room (A 2), c. 2 50 m. square, con- tained a splendid continuous fresco of lilies on three walls, above which was a shelf resting on horizontal beams, on which were stacked large numbers of vases. The room also contained a large quantity of daggers, sickles, and bronze vessels lying among the vases on the floor which had fallen from the shelf. Most remarkable of all, however, was the discovery of the outline of a wooden bed, which, when Plaster of Paris was applied, emerged in complete form (Fig. 39). The space below the bed was packed tight with vases. The fresco of lilies is a work of outstanding charm, FIG. 39 with a quite different building, House D, which stood at an appreciably higher level. One large rubbish pit of the Middle Bronze Age had been dug into the debris over Room VII, but there were few other remains of this period since the ground had been cut down and levelled in the time of House F. 'E.B.A. Room VI produced a red-brown burnished tankard, lacking only its handle, of a shape now re- cognised as characteristic in the late phases of the Early Bronze Age settlement. Further study of pottery from various areas has now gone toward con- FIG. 40 FIG. 41 perhaps representing 'The Coming of Spring'. The lilies are painted red with yellow stalks, and the landscape consists of variously coloured rocks cover- ed with vegetation and lichen, and gives 'a unique picture of the pre-seismic form of the island', to quote Professor Marinatos. Swallows singly and in pairs fly among the vegetation (cover picture).</page><page sequence="21">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1970-7I 23 In a second building (B) another room (BI) was covered with frescoes, representing two human figures of almost human size and four horned animals resembling antelopes (Oryx). An adjacent room con- sisting of four partitions was a shrine and contained vases, one group of which bears one or two incised signs of the Linear A script; the signs on one jug are rendered by Professor Marinatos as A-PE-ZA-NA, which, he suggests, may possibly conceal the 'pre- Greek name of the divinity of vegetation, subsequently hellenised as Ariadne-Ariagne'. Among other uten- sils found were (in the Room of the Lilies) two terra- FIG. 42 cotta spit-rests, one three-footed chytra with the symbol of the double-axe on the base, and a large number of metal objects including fragments of a large dish and three ewers. Among the abundant and excellent pottery discovered (the Room of the Lilies alone yielded 250 vases) were a pithos with decoration of lilies, a very fine jug with reed-decoration and an eye- jug with decoration of wheat (Fig. 40), and two un- usual shaped containers, decorated with white lilies, and identified by Professor Marinatos as flower-vases (Fig. 41). (Ergon 1970, 145-61; AAA i971, I, 58-74). Sellada. N. Zaphiropoulos' excavations (A.S.) of the necropolis of the ancient city continued in 1970 both on the north-east slope of the hill and on the other side. Once again, most of the funerary gifts consisted of Attic b.f. cups; on the base of one was the graffito 0IAO0. Three sixth-century tombs were discovered near the crest of the hill, one of which contained a funerary blockwith the inscription "Arraflos. Finds in a nearby group of tombs of the second quarter of the seventh century included a Theraean amphora with an unusual design and a Euboean amphora serving as an ash-container, with an excellent representation of a squatting bird on one side and a FIG. 43 swimming bird on the other (Fig. 42) (Ergon 1970, I6I-7). Naxos. Professor N. Kondoleon continued his excavations (A.S.) of the necropolis of Haplomata where three Mycenaean chamber tombs were found last year (AR 1969-70 25). It was shown that the necropolis was in continual use from Cycladic times onwards. Immediately east of the Mycenaean tombs io Middle Helladic pit-graves, five badly damaged, were discovered; two contained burials at two levels. The contents of the graves, scattered in the earth deposit, included Cycladic tools, and lead seals; among the idols were two seated figures, one of a man, the other of a woman. North of the My- cenaean tombs a Roman house was discovered, be- neath the floor of which were traces of a Geometric FIG. 44</page><page sequence="22">24 P. M. FRASER and Orientalising deposit, which had largely dis- appeared into the sea (Ergon 1970, 138-45). Donousa. Mrs Ph. Zapheiropoulou reports on her excavations of the Geometric cemetery on Donousa, the small island east of Naxos. A number of Geo- metric vases were recovered which Mrs Zapheiropou- lou connects stylistically with ware from Samos and the Dodecanese (ADelt 24 Chr 2, 390-3). OTHER AEGEAN ISLANDS Samos. Pythagoreion. Dr W. Martini reports that the main work of the German Institute here in 1970 was focused on the large Late Roman baths identi- fied in 1969 (AR 1969-70 25-6). The whole of the west part of the building was cleared to the level of the previous season's work. The floor level was reached at a depth of o-o6, and, o-04 deeper, the bathing-cubicles (Fig. 43) in the bays round the room; below them, the floor between the hypocaust pillars was reached. Outside the baths on the west the foundations of the heating system were discovered at a depth of 2 m. (Fig. 44), and its connection with the cubicles by means of praefurnia established. Small finds included stratified late Roman and Byzantine pottery, and stray sherds going back to as early as the Geometric period. A fragment of the knee of an Archaic kouros, and two Samian fifth century cubical tombstones of the type known as 'trapezai' came to light. A fragment of a dedica- tion in honour of the Samian, Callicrates the son of Boiscus, admiral of Ptolemy Philadelphus, discovered by N. Zaphiropoulos in 1964, adds one more item to the dossier of that much-honoured official, though the restoration is not immediately clear: [KaA]AtKpdTriv BotrKov [-?] /[Oeo]1g ZWor)tipr vac.

Servilius Isauricus, the proconsul of Cilicia in 78-4, described as the father of his son, proconsul of Asia in 46-44, and the other in honour of the Emperor Tiberius, are also noteworthy. Fifteen building-sites investigated during building operations in 1968 are reported on by K. Tsakos in FIG. 46 ADelt 24 Chr 2, 376-90. In one, near the harbour (Chatzianni property), the external wall of a large public building of Hellenistic date was uncovered; in another (Solounia property), where late Proto- geometric sherds had been found in 1967 (cf. AR 1969-70 29), numerous Orientalising sherds of the seventh century were recovered within bell-shaped deposit pits cut in the rock. Mytilene. City. The magnificent mosaics of the third century A.D. in the 'House of Menander' in the quarter of Chorafa in Mytilene, excavated by the late S. Charitonides in 1961-63, have now been published by tS. Charitonides, L. Kahil and R. Ginouvis (6te Beiheft z. Antike Kunst, 1970). They are of outstanding interest for the history of theatrical presentations and for New Comedy in general, and this important publication covers all aspects of the many problems they raise. In ADelt 24 Chr 2, 368-37I, B. Petrakos reports on the excavations carried out during demolition of the old hospital in front of the church of Ayios Therapon. Most of the ancient remains had been destroyed when the hospital was built in 1850, but fragments of a damaged mosaic floor of high quality belonging to a large dwelling-house were found, with octagonal panels enclosing representations of winged loves (Fig. 45), fauna (goats, lion, panther) and human portraits; in the modern deposits was found a frag- ment of an inscription honouring Marcus Pompeius FIG. 45</page><page sequence="23">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, I970-71 25 Theophanes, described as etpovaas;, and some archi- tectural fragments. Thasos. The main excavations of the French School, undertaken by B. Holzmann and 0. Picard, were in the area west of the Agora, in the direction of the ancient fortification. Starting from the North- West Stoa, it was established that the frieze of the later wall of the stoa did not continue on the rear facade. Beyond the stoa was a large open space which apparently remained in use until the fourth century A.D. Against the back wall of the stoa was a conduit, covered with marble slabs. Some honori- fic monuments including the foundation of an exedra (Fig. 46), were discovered in this area. At Alike the basilicas were further investigated. The naves and narthex of the South Basilica, and annexes thereof, were examined. In the central nave an ambon consisting of a platform accessible by a staircase was found. The basilica orginally possessed a narthex situated more to the East, which was replaced by one attached to the west wall. Large numbers of the pieces of sculpture and revetment blocks were found. The final form of the whole complex seems to belong to the sixth century. [Corrigendum to AR 1969-70 26, fig. 52.

Traces of paving east of the propylon indicate the link between the pro- pylon and a road from the ancient city. A paved area sloping westward towards the propylon at a level slightly higher'than the forecourt was composed of various limestone and porphyry blocks. No un- disturbed fill was discovered, but its resemblance to the paving on the Eastern Hill suggests a date in the late fourth century, and, if that is correct, earlier than the Propylon. (b) Eastern Hill. Work was confined to stripping the north and east slopes to recover architectural frag- ments and to locate remains of the road thought to have skirted the slope. At the edge of the hill a block of paving was exposed, indicating that the road continued beyond the out-croppings, to follow the slope and eventually to meet the ramp from the Pro- pylon of Ptolemy II. Among the debris on the hill was a fragment of the architectural inscription of the Doric building dedicated by BantOeI;/ ,tutGnno 'A [Ai$avrp]o[ OeoTg Meydo)og]. (c) Western Hill. A trench was opened at the south-west corner of the Byzantine fort to clarify the chronology of the late buildings and to reveal more of the Hellenistic treasury-like structure below. A large rectangular building with a shallow porch, the southernmost of three such buildings covered by the Byzantine fort, is probably, like the others, of the</page><page sequence="24">26 P. M. FRASER late Hellenistic period. Associated with the building is a series of small-scale statue-bases inscribed with dedications of ambassadors. Byzantine buildings on the site were considerably remodelled up to the de- struction of the fort in the thirteenth century. (d) Stoa. A series of nearly square rooms in front of the stoa was investigated, and they were provisionally identified as ritual dining rooms (Fig. 47), dating from the second half of the fourth century B.C. Traces of marble-chip and rough pebble mosaic floors were preserved, along with traces of dining- couches. The buildings were considerably repaired in the Roman period with material brought from elsewhere to the sanctuary, including a fine fourth- century marble sculptured coffin lid. Elsewhere, the inscribed stele, IG xii.8. 190, representing a round building in Cyzius, was rediscovered (Fig. 48). CRETE. CENTRAL CRETE Cnossos. Neolithic Settlement. Professor J. Evans writes: 'The second season of the present series of excava- tions in the Neolithic mound at Knossos saw the successful completion of the research programme as originally envisaged. Some of the discoveries made this year, however, especially those concerning the nature of the earliest settlements on the hill, posed new and unexpected problems which could only be fully elucidated by further major investigations beyond the scope of the present work. 'The aims proposed at the outset of the new investi- gations have been in the main fully realised. A great deal of new information has been obtained about the architecture and layout which puts the discoveries of the 1957-60 seasons in a new light. It is now possible to map, in a tentative way, the growth of the settlement during successive phases, and much new evidence has come to light bearing on both the earliest and latest phases of the Neolithic occupation. Despite the poor conditions for preservation on this site, a fairly representative series of plant remains and seeds has been recovered by Mrs H. N. Jarman, and a further large sample of animal bones has been collected and studied by Mr M. R. Jarman. The mass of new artificial material also provides much fresh detail about industrial traditions. 'West Court. Here the main task was the comple- tion of the large sounding AA/BB, begun last year. Below the late Neolithic levels excavated at the end of the last season remains of portions of several super- imposed buildings were found, the top one dating from Middle Neolithic, the lower three all of the early Neolithic II period. The walls of these buildings had all the same orientation, which differed slightly from that of the Middle Neolithic buildings in the Central Court and the Early Neolithic II buildings found in the small northern sounding XY in 1960; but agreed with that of Sir Arthur Evans' Late Neolithic buildings in the Central Court and of the Early Neolithic II building found last year in the uppermost levels of AA/BB. Walls of different phases were often renewed in exactly the same line. All these buildings consisted of agglomerations of small rooms with an abundance of doorways, which had often been deliberately blocked. Each showed traces of several stages of use in the form of renewal of floors, repair of walls and addition of new ones, etc. 'The deposit in which these building remains were found embedded was almost uniformly solid yellow clay and kouskouras with scarcely any trace of the darker refuse levels. The quantity of this material, together with the fact that some quite thin walls survived to a height of over a metre, suggested that at the end of their occupation the rooms had been deliberately filled in to level the site for new building. FIG. 49 The deliberate creation on each occasion of a flat platform contrasts with the simple mound of clay and kouskouras from the walls found covering buildings elsewhere on the site. The indications are that we are here dealing with part of an exceptionally large building which was several times renewed on the same site. However, the rooms found were small and contained, as usual, little material, and that of a quite ordinary kind. In one of the Early Neolithic II levels traces were found of canes which covered part of a floor, though this was probably a space between buildings and not the floor of a room. 'Below the last of these buildings, the deposit changed character. It became predominantly dark in colour, with many thin layers, closely resembling the accumulation of occupation debris normally found between houses. Some traces of floors and constructions of stone and clay were found in these levels in the North of this area, but nothing comparable in scale to the buildings above. The pottery from this deposit was all of Early Neolithic I type, and sherds were found abundantly right at the bottom. Bedrock was reached at the base of this deposit, at a total depth of c. 8 metres below the West Court. There was no trace of the aceramic level found in the Central Court in I960. 'Three other soundings were made in the West Court this year in an effort to locate intact deposits spanning the transition from Neolithic to Early Minoan I. The first of these, a four metre square, EE, was located slightly to the south-east of AA/BB, in the space left by the offset in the west wall of the</page><page sequence="25">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1970-71 27 Palace. A Late Neolithic level was found immedi- ately below the pavement, and it was clear that all Early Minoan material, and probably also the latest Late Neolithic deposits, had been removed in later levelling. Excavation was continued, however, for a while in this square, chiefly because the deposits were found to be very productive of carbonised seeds, whereas the corresponding ones in AA/BB had been almost sterile. Below some fragmentary construc- tions of Late Neolithic date a portion of a building was found which could be linked with the remains of the Middle Neolithic buildings in AA/BB. Below these again were deposits of the Early Neolithic II period (Fig. 49). These were located in a small trial in the north-west corner of the area, but work was aban- doned at this stage because the yield of carbonised seeds had fallen off. 'A second four metre square, FF, was begun to the north of AA/BB near to the top of the slope which leads to the Theatral Area. After clearing a modern dump, packed with sherds, the edge of an Early Minoan fill, evidently the same as that found in AA/BB last year, was struck in the southern part of the square. Stratified below this, but at a higher level in the north- ern than in the southern half of the square, was a most interesting Late Neolithic deposit. It was largely midden material with some pits and occasional fragments of floors and piled stones which were possibly parts of rough walls. Its significance lay in the contained pottery, which, among much material of familiar Late Neolithic type, also included a scatter of pieces with features not otherwise known at Knossos, but all characteristic of the Neolithic deposit below the Palace of Phaistos. Among these were several coarse sherds with slanted rims, a frag- ment of a spouted jug, a trough spout in red polished ware with a V-shaped section, and two pieces with red crusted decoration, one an almost complete bowl with a carinated profile, of a type not previously recorded at Knossos, The preservation of this de- posit seems to be due to its being on the edge of the original mound and having therefore escaped the drastic levelling operations which affected the central areas. 'Immediately below these important levels was a stratum which produced Middle Neolithic pottery and traces of a building with the same orientation as the Middle Neolithic building in AA/BB. At this point work was stopped in this area. 'The third and last sounding in the West Court was a small trench, GG, which was laid out alongside the causeway which runs from the north-east to the south- west of this court, somewhat to the south-west of AA/BB. Once more an Early Minoan fill, pre- sumably the same as that found in AA/BB and in the east-west trench last year, and this year in FF, was located immediately below the paving. At one point it had been cut through by what appears to be the test pit of a twentieth-century excavator. This was possibly one of Sir Arthur Evans' soundings, though none is recorded by Pendlebury in this area. Im- mediately below the Early Minoan fill lay a Middle Neolithic deposit. Work was abandoned at this stage, since it was clear that no trace of the Late Neolithic/Early Minoan transition had survived here either. 'The information furnished by these three cuttings, combined with that obtained last year in the two trenches and area AA/BB show clearly that the Early Minoan I levels in the West Court area were largely removed during the later stages of the Early Minoan period, probably partly by erosion, but partly also by the deliberate levelling which seems to have pre- ceded the building of the Early Minoan IIA structure found last year in AA/BB. Any portions which may have survived this period were removed in later level- ling operations for the construction of the Palace and its Courts. 'Central Court. Work here was on a smaller scale than last year. Two east-west trenches, P and Q, were cut on the west side of the Court in an attempt to locate the position of the neighbouring Middle Neolithic struc- tures west of the large Middle Neolithic building un- covered last year. The result was unexpected, since it showed that scarcely any deposits of the Middle Neolithic period are preserved on this side of the FIG. 50 Central Court. P showed very clearly the rapid rise in the level of the Middle Neolithic deposits in this direction, and the corresponding thinning out of the deep Late Neolithic fill which covered 'the remains of last year's house. 'Both cuttings demonstrated the shallowness of the Late Neolithic and, even more strikingly, the Middle Neolithic, deposits preserved on the west side of the Court. An Early Neolithic II level was reached at a depth of only 2o cm. at the western end of each trench, though the deposits sloped so steeply to the east that at the opposite end the top of the Early Neo-</page><page sequence="26">28 P. M. FRASER FIG. 51 lithic II deposits was already more than one metre deep. 'Three further cuttings, R, S, T, were made in the north-west part of the Court. These were laid out FIG. 52 north-south, and were eventually joined up. The chief architectural remains found were further por- tions of the Middle Neolithic 'House B', part of which was excavated in 1959 ( in square B). These cuttings also enabled us to study the profile of the mound in the north-west corner of the Central Court. From south to north building remains of the Early Neolithic II, Middle Neolithic and Late Neolithic periods were found at approximately the same level, demon- strating the sharp northward slope which must have existed here, and the way in which later levels must have been cut away to the south. 'One other sounding, X, situated near to the southern limit of the Court, will be best dealt with in the next section. 'Peripheral Soundings A number of small soundings was made at selected points on the edges of the mound. Four, ZA-ZD, were made in the south-east corner of the Palace area. Relatively little deposit was found at any of these points, and no Neolithic material was found anywhere in situ, though they were useful in providing information about the profile of the natural rock in this part of the site. 'A further trial pit, ZE, was then laid out farther to the north-west, just west of the ramp leading to the Central Court. Here, just below a Minoan level which included mud brick, was found a deposit which contained mud-bricks, but of quite a different texture and shape (Fig. 50). No pottery was found, but pieces of obsidian and bone points were abundant, and small beads and pendants quite frequent. 'A small sounding, X, 2 m. by 3 m., was next begun in the Central Court, just to the north of its southern limit, and not far from ZE. This sounding furnished a remarkable sequence consisting of, first, a deep Late Neolithic deposit (c. 2 m,.), next, a very thin layer (c. Io cm.) of Middle Neolithic/Early Neolithic II material, extending only over about half the area, then a substantial deposit of Early Neolithic I mat- erial (c. 2 m.), and, finally, one and a half metres of accumulated debris which lacked pottery, but con- tained much obsidian and bone, many ornaments and two baked clay figurines (Fig. 51), while portions of three walls, at different levels, made of a mixture of stone (including many querns) and unfired brick, were found in it (Fig 52). Unfortunately, these de- posits were cut by a large pit, and thus the total area was reduced, except at the bottom, just above bed- rock. This was found here at a depth of c. 5"5 m., in other words, about 2 m. above the level in the northern part of the Central Court. In ZE it was at a still higher level. In other words, the original ground surface rose appreciably in this area, which must have been the highest point in the original hill. If the aceramic deposits in X and ZE are to be correlated with the aceramic stratum X of 1960, rather than with Strata IX and VIII, both of which produced small amounts of pottery, then the nucleus of the earliest settlement would have been on this eminence, with working areas spreading down the slope to the north (the 1960 'Camp' level) and perhaps in other direc- tions also. But ZE and X are both small in area, so that it is difficult to be completely certain that the absence of pottery is not due to chance. The prob- lem could only be fully resolved by establishing the stratigraphical relationship with the I960 sounding. but this would mean further extensive excavation, which was out of the question this year. 'Three other small soundings were made in out- lying areas. ZF, at the foot of the East Bastion, again produced no Neolithic material in situ, but at the</page><page sequence="27">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1970-71 29 determined and the extension of the 'Strong Building' to the south estab- lished. A deposit of early Palatial vases found in the area, including tall tum- blers with white on polychrome decor- ation, may have belonged to a shrine. The 'Building of the Sacred Deposit', south-east of the street-crossing, was found to have a strong wall as faCade on the street side, and to consist of several small storerooms, the pottery within them being MM IIIB-LM IA. The building G, partially excavated by Hogarth, was fully uncovered, and shown to be approached through an entrance-porch flanked by projecting pilasters, inside which was a double staircase giving access to an upper floor and a paved entrance-hall; beyond was a large rectangular room supporting an upper storey by means of a wooden pillar. Other rooms were approached through the entrance-hall. Four underground rooms, already so identified by Hogarth, were shown to have communicating doors, and to connect with the ground floor by means of a staircase. Large numbers of objects were found in the house, vases, stone artefacts, etc., and a large white stone lamp. The adjacent house-complex, Hogarth's H, and the street running outside it, were also cleared, and numerous objects were found in the deposit of the street; the most sig- nificant was a fragment of a terracotta boat consisting of the stern with two benches, and a small figure of a man facing the prow. The house of two storeys itself consisted of two main units with separate en- FIG. 53 bottom, above the rock, is a deposit of hillwash which contained Neolithic and Minoan sherds, and pro- vided evidence of erosion on the east slope pre- ceding the building of the Bastion. ZG, in the north- east corner of the Palace area, near the modern fence, furnished, below a mixed deposit, several levels which contained only Early Neolithic I pottery, the lowest of which rested directly on the rock. It was somewhat unexpected to find that the Early Neolithic I settlement had extended so far to the north. The third sounding, ZH, was located just to the south of the ramp leading down westwards from the West Court. Here, below a considerable depth of mixed Minoan and Neolithic material, an intact Neolithic deposit was found, the top level being apparently of the Middle Neolithic period. Since this sound- ing was only started a few days before the end of the season, work here had to be stopped at this point, without exploring the rest of the Neolithic deposit.' EASTERN CRETE Zakros. Professor Platon's excavations at Kato Zakros (A.S.) continued in I970, atten- tion again being concentrated on the two palace structures on the slope of the north-west hill, including the buildings incompletely ex- plored by Hogarth in 90go. The structure north of the road to the harbour (cf. AR I969-70o 29) was further investigated, and more than twenty rooms uncovered, built on ir- regularly placed terraces of the slope. The building, like the vases found in it in 1969, belonged to the end of the Early Palatial period. In the rooms, remains of benches, storage pits, etc., were found, along with a large number of vases, offering-tables and utensils. The line of the street between this group of build- ings and the 'Strong Building' (see AR ibid.) was FIG. 54 trances, and is one of the main domestic complexes of the Palace area. Further work was also carried out on remains of the Eastern Wing of the Palace, which had been much damaged by cultivation. At one point in this area remains of a large building of the Early Palatial period were found lying on a different orientation from the later Palace (Fig. 53); it</page><page sequence="28">30 P. M. FRASER seems to have been built over at the end of the transi- tion to the first Late Palatial period. In the deposit in the rooms were large quantities of Early Palatial and early Late Palatial pottery, much of the latter evidently having been discarded there when the new Palace was built in c. 1600 B.c. Only a few metal objects were found (Ergon 1970, 167-85). Myrtos. Pyrgos. The first of a series of new excav- ations was carried out by G. Cadogan under the FIG. 55 auspices of the British School at Athens in September and October 1970. Mr Cadogan writes: 'The principal aim of these excavations is to re- cover the sequence of Minoan habitation on this hill on the south coast of Crete, below the Lasithi Moun- FIG. 56 tains. Other aims are to link the history of Pyrgos with that of the nearby EM II settlement at Fournou Korifi, recently excavated by P. M. Warren for the British School (see AR 1967-68 24 f., 968-69 34), to uncover as much as possible of the MM settlement here, and to establish the nature and date of the apparent LM I destruction. 'The 520 sq. metres excavated in the first season have revealed a Minoan settlement with a long his- tory, which was dominated in MM III - LM I by a splendid country house which was evidently the ruling house of the neighbourhood. Parts of the settlement have been excavated on the East and West slopes of the hill. On the east slope MM III and LM I levels have been found, though there are some earlier chance finds such as an EM steatite seal. On the west slope some LM I buildings were found near the top of the slope, built over an EM III-MM I deposit and over other MM deposits. These LM buildings have been terraced into the hill, and their back walls are formed by the cut rock which has been built up with stone walling. Farther down the west slope there are no LM remains, but two MM I FIG. 57 deposits have been found, one of them in a building which rests on a terrace platform apparently made in EM III, to judge from the EM II and III sherds in the terrace fill. Connected with this platform is a fine stone staircase. In the area of the other de- posit a surprising find was the burial, probably of a woman, in a pit, with the bones of a baby nearby. With this burial were a conch shell, some plain pottery and a bowl with linear decoration which may belong to LM I. 'The country house on the top of the hill has been about half excavated. It faces north-south, its north view being up the valley of the river Myrtos and its south across a courtyard to the sea. The house is about 20 m. long, and is approached by a street which runs up the east side of the hill along the house's ashlar facade to join a raised walk which crosses the courtyard (Fig. 54). At the end of this walk, at the south-west corner of the house, is probably the main entrance, which was entered through a verandah. From the entrance one walks along a passage to reach a stone staircase bordered by a para- pet descending by steps with a wooden column at the end of each step-a miniature of the Grand Staircase at Knossos-which leads to the upper floor (Fig. 55). Most of the rooms uncovered are base-</page><page sequence="29">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1970-71 31 ments, but in the entrance-passage the contents of what may have been a shrine on the upper floor were found lying on its collapsed gypsum flagstones: five clay tubes, a faience conch shell and a Linear A tablet (Fig. 56). In the south-east corner of the house are two store rooms containing pithoi, and a second en- trance leading off the street to reach them. Above these storerooms would have been an important room, whose fine pottery was found lying fallen on to the street below. Among the pottery were two am- phorae with a highly lustrous black wash and curving bands of white paint, to imitate the veining of marble, which had both been pierced in the base for use as rhyta (Fig. 57)- 'Throughout the house was ample evidence of destruction by fire. The house was probably built in MM III, from the evidence of a test pit below the floor of one of the storerooms, and may have been altered during LM I. It was burnt down in LMIB, as Marine Style sherds have been found in the des- truction debris. 'Some other buildings excavated around the court- yard include a small pavilion or shrine, and some outhouses. In the earth above the outhouses was FIGo. 58 found the latest piece of Minoan pottery, a Late Minoan III CI deep bowl; and at the top of the hill are a few Hellenistic remains.' Archanes. Miss A. Lembesi's excavation (A.S.) in areas some way from the known location of the Minoan settlement at Archanes brought to light construction levels of MM III and LM I-III date. In one build- ing a remarkable terracotta model of a large Minoan house was discovered; it is executed in considerable detail, and casts light on some obscure features of Minoan domestic architecture; in general it bears a remarkable resemblance to the reconstructed Palace at Knossos. Two complete Linear A tablets and various fragments of others were also found. (Ergon 1970, I85). Lato. Work here by the French School was car- ried out in two sectors, (a) at the top of the Agora stairs, against the south wall of the Prytaneion, which also served as supporting-wall of the staircase, and (b) on the 'rampart' and terraces along the street excavated by J. Demargne; this rampart turned out to be a continuous wall comprising the succession of lateral walls of the various terraces, each of which contained a house or houses; on two of the terraces these included strongly fortified residential towers. The associated pottery, almost exclusively local, seems to be of the fourth to third centuries B.C. Herakleion. A female head of the fourth century belonging to a funerary monument was found in a Venetian layer near the Museum. It shows Attic influences. Also from Herakleion came a series of fine marble pyxides from a Hellenistic pit-grave. which also contained a number of terracottas. Miss Lembesi also reports on excavations at various points in the area of Herakleion. At Arkades (Aphra- ti), where a quantity of archaic armour, some of it in- scribed, had been stolen and dispersed in various collections, an excavation on the hill of Hai-Zia, where the armour had been found, led to the dis- covery of a rectangular building with a bench round the walls, identified by Miss Lembesi as a shrine. A large number of fragments of chased bronze weapons were found; they had probably been dedicated in the shrine. The stratigraphy of the structure was disturbed, and a firm date is not possible, but most of the sherds so far examined seem to be of late Geometric date, and few later. A complete trefoil Geometric oinochoe found in situ in a recess of one wall permits the dating of this and the accompanying wall, which are both earlier than the shrine, to the middle of the Geometric period. At Xydas (Lyttos) fragments of relief pithoi were found, of the third quarter of the seventh century (Fig. 58). (ADelt 24 Chr 2, 415-20). Other excavations carried out under the auspices of the Archaeological Society at different localities near Herakleion brought to light a number of un- damaged larnakes, one of which has a fine representa- tion of heraldically facing birds (Preveliana and Gazi), and quantities of glass paste beads (Kyparissi). Also from Gazi is reported the discovery of a larnax with a representation of a large ship with triangular sail, the first representation of a ship of this size known in Minoan art. Protogeometric and Geometric graves were discovered at Knossos and Mastamba (Ergon 1970, 189-90). WESTERN CRETE Nomos Chania. Chania. Kastelli. The excavation of the Kastelli was continued in 1968 by I. Tsedakis, but since the report of 1969, when the excavation continued as a combined Greco-Swedish operation, has already been summarised in AR 1969-70 3o, it will suffice here to refer to Tsedakis' report , ADelt 24 Chr 2, 423-3I.- In AAA 1971, I, 42-4, K. Davaras gives a brief account of his excavation of the tholos tomb first in- vestigated by N. Platon and himself, south-east of Chania. The settlement to which the tomb be- longed was located on the nearby hill of Azogyres,</page><page sequence="30">32 P. M. FRASER and a substantial buiding of LM III date was un- covered there. Kastelli Kisamou. Excavation of the house with the mosaics (see AR 1969-70 30) continued in 1968. Nine rooms were uncovered to the west of the room with the mosaics, but none contained any trace of mosaic covering. The existence of two building- phases of the house, the first of the second half of the third century A.D., the second of the early Christian period, was confirmed. Kavousi Kisamou. At this point on the western ex- tremity of Crete roadworks brought to light a chamber tomb containing eighteen Geometric vases, and the fragments of eighteen others; the material was divi- sible into late Protogeometric and Geometric phases. This is the first indication of Protogeometric in- stallations so far west; hitherto the cemetery excava- ted by Professor Platon at Modi, west of Chania, has been the farthest west. Phalasarna. Part of the hitherto unknown cemetery of Phalasarna was discovered by chance. Forty- three graves were excavated, containing either burials in pithoi or in rectangular cist-graves. Good pot- tery was recovered, including b.f. lekythoi, some of them of the school of the 'Haimon Painter', and small two-eared 'Ionic' amphorae and skyphoi of the late sixth century. A Corinthian aryballos of the second quarter of the sixth century shows that the city was already in existence at that time, which is con- siderably earlier than had previously been supposed (ADelt 24 Chr 2, 431-3). Nome of Rethymno. Pigi. A subterranean chamber tomb discovered at Grambela near Pigi contained eight sarcophagi and forty-two vases. It seems to have been used at different periods, first in LM IIIA, then in LM IIIB, and finally in late LM IIIB. The vases and sarcophagi are richly decorated (ibid. 435). DODECANESE Rhodes. City. In ADelt 24 Chr 2, 451-85, G. Konstantinopoulos reports on work carried out in 1968 in the Dodecanese, and especially in Rhodes. He announces the completion by Mrs Christa Gross- mann of a plan of the Hippodamian city, embodying all the relevant discoveries of the last twenty years. Excavations during the year revealed further sections of the southern course of the city-wall and proteichisma. In the north-west of the town heavy seas brought to light for the first time traces of the mole of the ancient Western Harbour on the foreshore in front of the Akte Miaouli. Among other finds not already mentioned (see AR 1969-70 30-1) is that of a partially rock-cut Nymphaeum with a well-preserved mosaic with a representation of a nude Dionysos in the centre, sur- rounded by geometrical patterns, in Pavlou Mela Street. The excavation of the large basilica on the corner of Pavlou Mela and Chimaras Streets con- tinued. In the main building the existence of two floor levels was confirmed, and, below the first floor, remains of earlier walls built on the rock were found, and also three cist-graves. The necropolis areas again yielded prolific material. A group of tombs in the South Necropolis (Lindou Street) is of particular interest as having yielded objects of the fourth cen- tury, and a bronze hydria assigned to the fifth cen- tury. In the Karakonero area, above the British War Cemetery, 91 pit-graves were excavated on the pro- posed site of the Reformatory, largely of the third and second centuries B.C. Kymisala. The construction of a new road to Monolithos in the mountainous and wooded area of Hagios Phokas, west of Siana, which formed the centre of the ancient deme-complex of Kymisala, led to the discovery of a group of nine rock-cut tombs of the Classical period, and, in the saddle at the foot of the Acropolis, of a substantial funerary peribolos consisting of a row of chamber tombs surmounted by a row of five large stone bathroi, which evidently supported funerary monuments, as at Karakonero and elsewhere; the tombs are apparently of the fourth century.
