Alles A FITTING APPROACH TO GOD: ON ENTERING THE WESTERN TEMPLES AT KHAJURAHO David Freedberg's long, rich book, The Power of Images, is at once en- gaging, rambling, insightful, intriguing, instructive, tedious, and just plain frustrating.l In an account redolent with religion, Freedberg en- gages in a bold, metaphorical iconoclasm on behalf of a literal icono- dulism: he deliberately smashes some of the most venerated icons of recent artistic and religious scholarship in order to preserve what he al- leges to be the human response to real icons. Overturning a regnant conventionalism and contextualism, he insists that a universal substrate of psychological experience underlies every human response to im- ages. Exhorting us to forsake theory for experience, he renounces any talk of symbolism-"in no case is it useful to introduce the notion of symbolism"2-and sees in semiotics an embarrassed, elitist attempt to separate into sign and signified what in ordinary experience is so tightly conjoined that we should not even speak of identity, since iden- tity is a relation between two distinct terms. Intending a course beyond both the hermeneutical enterprise of high iconography and the incisive critique of social history, Freedberg actually adopts two strategies to I gave a talk with this title on December 6, 1990, for the "Arts of India" series at Hood College, Frederick, Md.

"We survey the banal and com- monplace evidence, the evidence we all know, and supplement it- flesh it out-by looking more deeply into ourselves."3 Freedberg, it seems, has written a little something for everyone to disagree with. But perhaps he has written a little something from which we can learn, too. Take the western group of temples at Khajuraho, for example. Scholars may puzzle over, catalog, and speculate about the erotica that decorate their surfaces, but for visitors who flock to these temples by the planeload, such intellectual activity is surely secondary. We do better to speak of their voyeuristic pleasure, prudish revulsion, or even, for those with more ethereal tastes, their aesthetic delight. In the matter of sexual imagery, at least, it seems difficult to resist entirely the force of Freed- berg's argument.4 When we see a man having anal intercourse with a horse and a woman standing behind the unlikely pair, burying her face in her hands in evident disgust, to speak of semiotics, hermeneutics, or any theory, for that matter, may well be to miss the point-deliberately. This article is not about the power of Khajuraho's images to arouse, astound, and repulse. It proposes to reflect instead on a topic more in- tegral to the structures' religious character: the power, to use Freed- berg's term, by which the temples provide an approach to God. Furthermore, this article does not intend slavishly to extend Freedberg's ideas; it rests more comfortably on its own conceptual frame. But, whatever hesitations we might have about Freedberg's procedures in an abstract, logically antiseptic environment, the present discussion is more or less bound to follow his lead, and for the simplest of reasons: there are no feasible alternatives. From Arab historians like al-Birini and Ibn Battutaah we learn, it seems, that when the western group of temples at Khajuraho were new, they were disposed pretty much the way Alexander Cunningham mapped them in the early 1860s (fig. 1).5 3 Ibid., p. 430. 4 Freedberg adopts, then, a nuanced universalism. "However much one argued for the place of small feet in sexual contexts in China, or other anatomical features elsewhere," he writes, "it would be futile wholly to argue away the psychosexual dimension of the bare female breast in all cultures, or of the exposed genitalia, male or female. The exact limits of the resonance... are only somewhat variable, certainly not so much that they never intersect" (ibid., p. 324). Recently this point has been hotly debated. Strict social constructionists would vehemently disagree. Freedberg is clear that he does not claim that a conventionalist view is wrong, only that it is insufficient (p. 325). Freedberg him- self dismisses the eroticism of Khajuraho as too blatant: "We do not need to pause for long or to concentrate to see what is happening. We see the penis and the vulva; we scan cursorily and get the point" (p. 356). 5 See H. M. Elliott, The History of India as Told by Its Own Historians: The Muham- madan Period, ed. John Dowson (New York: AMS, 1966), 1:57, 383-84; Ibn Battuta, The Rehla of Ibn Battuta (India, Maldive Islands, and Ceylon), ed. Mahdi Husain, 2d ed. (Baroda: Oriental Institute, 1976), p. 166.

XCV.)</page><page sequence="4">A Fitting Approach to God From materials like Krsna Misra's play, Prabodha-candrodaya, we learn in general terms about the religious life of those who built and used the temples. One temple in the western group, the Matanigesvara, remains in use; I worshiped there myself. But its rituals are nothing special, and its form is entirely different from the temples in the west- ern group on which this essay concentrates. In short, there are no known accounts dating from the time when the grand temples of the western group were actually used that recount ritual practices or relate worshipers' experiences in sufficient detail.6 The primary evidence is, and will have to remain, the temples themselves. Our situation is reminiscent, then, of the tenuous perch on which prehistorians sit. But a tenuous perch is better than no perch at all. Julian Thomas writes, "The interpretation of constructed space is never entirely free, bound as it is both by cultural conventions of 'reading' and by the physical reality of the spaces encountered and the bodily movements necessary to pass through them. It is this insight which allows us to investigate [in Thomas's case] the architecture of Irish megalithic tombs, not necessarily to attempt to evoke the same specific meanings which their internal spaces held for their builders and users, so much as to consider their role in constraining movement and staging or framing particular ritual practices."7 In recognizing the inaccessibil- ity of authorial intentions, Thomas does not jump immediately to an ahistorical, New Critical account of ancient monuments, and neither will I. We know that the temples of Khajuraho, like the Irish mega- lithic tombs, have changed, and we know what those changes were, that is, at least some of them. The historical moment consists of imag- ining the effects of past features that we know about. In the case of Khajuraho, as with the Irish tombs, the evidence may be spotty, but, as Thomas's "never" signals, the tenuousness of the procedure and the tentativeness and fragmentariness of the results characterize every dis- cussion of the past. Thomas's work provides another important signpost, too. Freedberg generally presupposes images that are viewed by relatively stationary Made during the Years 1862-63-64-65, 2 vols.

Gibb (London: Routledge, 1939), p. 363, n. 5. 6 It is true that certain panels at Khajuraho depict abhisekham, the inauguration of Siva's liiigam, which some take as a celebration of Mahasivaratri. But, while helpful, such depictions are not detailed enough for present purposes. 7 Julian Thomas, "Monuments from the Inside: The Case of the Irish Megalithic Tombs," World Archaeology 22, no. 2 (1990): 168-78, esp. p. 170. Thomas spreads over his account, in a thick appliqu6, the metaphor of reading (we must "read the monu- ments"), but it does not seem to provide much content, only an aura of sophistication. (Thanks to Kenny Geremia for this quote.) 164</page><page sequence="5">History of Religions observers: that is precisely the attitude toward architectural experience Thomas argues vigorously against.8 To make his argument case- specific: the temples in the western group at Khajuraho do not primarily affect people who stand still and observe them. They exercise religious power on people who approach and enter them. The first task, then, will be to explicate the means by which the western temples at Khajuraho constrain and direct the movement of worshipers so as to create an ap- proach to God. Then we will consider variations in space and time. FIVE MOMENTS OF APPROACH It is customary to laud the western temples at Khajuraho, especially the magnificent Kandariya Mahadeva, for the beauty of their structure and decoration.9 In structure these temples, built between 950 and 1050 C.E., represent the climax of central north Indian temple building. In decoration they sport an array of erotic displays virtually unmatched for their technical and imaginative delight. Much less has been made of the location of the temples, the fact that they are peripheral. True, the Chandellas, the medieval kings who had them built, situated the temples toward the ancestral center of their holdings. But the western temples seem always to have lain pretty much where they lie today: on the western edge of a major north-south artery and a couple of kilome- ters west of the closest settlement, the medieval town and moder vil- lage of Khajuraho (see fig. 1). This much, then, should be clear: the temples were meant to be approached from a distance. The approach to the temples proceeds in five moments or acts.10 Like the superstructures of the temples themselves, these moments 8 "Perhaps, then, we would do well to consider prehistoric monuments less from the dehumanized perspective of the air photograph, and more from that of the human subject moving about in space" (ibid., p. 169). For further elaboration, see Julian Thomas, Re- thinking the Neolithic (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991), esp. chaps. 3, 8. 9 A basic bibliography should begin with Krishna Deva, Temples of Khajuraho, 2 vols. (New Delhi: Archaeological Survey of India, 1990). Also consult the luscious color photographs in Deva's Khajuraho (New Delhi: Brijbasi, 1986)-not to be confused with his smaller guide to the site, published under the same title by the Archaeological Survey of India, New Delhi (1987)-and his important article, "The Temples of Khajuraho in Central India," Ancient India: Bulletin of the Archaeological Survey of India 15 (1959): 43-65. F. Fritz's 2-vol. documentation, Khajuraho (Boblingen: Codex, 1971), suffers from poor-quality photographs, but it is thorough and useful. For further bibliography, see successive references and my earlier article, "Surface, Space, and Intention: The Par- thenon and the Kandariya Mahadeva," History of Religions 28 (August 1988): 1-36. 10 The historical present makes for vivid reading, especially where physical character- istics have remained unchanged. Unless otherwise specified, however, the account that follows is adjusted to what we know of the past. Michael W. Meister has briefly noted the importance of approach in his article, "Hindu Temples," in The Encyclopedia of Re- ligion, ed. Mircea Eliade (New York: Macmillan, 1987), 14:368-73, esp. p. 372, by and large reprinted as "The Hindu Temple: Axis of Access" in Concepts of Space, Ancient and Moder, ed.

The first is the moment of attraction. In the immediate vicinity, the temples-especially the tall- est three, the Laksmana, the Visvanatha, and the Kandariya-attract potential visitors by means of their height and shape. The graceful, parabolic arcs of the sandstone structures (sikharas) over the inner sancta (garbhagrhas) soar to summits 100 feet and more off the ground, clearly distinguishing the temples from their vernacular and natural environments. The temples attract more distant visitors by means of the quality and grace of their design and workmanship, and above all by the fascination of their sexually explicit decoration, which today lures visitors from all over the globe.ll Some of the figures- physically full and sensuously rich-show a gentle, tender coitus. A few are real eye-catchers. The middle panel in the top frieze on the Visvanatha's north wall shows presumed sexual penetration of a female figure who is standing on her head, face to viewer. Her right arm pro- vides balance; her left hand rests on the otherwise naked pudendum of a standing female attendant. The moment of attraction establishes a destination; orientation tells visitors how to get there. In theory visitors coming from any direction may need orientation, but traffic and settlement patterns favor an ap- proach from any direction except the west, which provides an unfavor- able view of the temples. Religious considerations are more specific; they favor an approach from the south, where a "tank," Siva-sagara (Siva's lake), enables visitors to cleanse themselves before entering the sacred precincts. Whether visitors come from the north, the east, or the south, the temples establish strong vectors pointing east to west, direct- ing the worshiper from the doorway to the point singled out by the lofty superstructure. Two architectural features establish these vectors. To the east of each sikhara stands a succession of lower, often pyramidal superstruc- tures above the entrance porch (ardhamandapa, mandapa) and audi- 1 The dynamics of attraction distinctly appear in the report of T. S. Burt, the first Eu- ropean to notice the temples: "It was whilst I was on my return trip from Eraw to Saugor that I heard, from a palky bearer, of the wonders of the place-Khajrao, near Chatpore, as he called it; . . . I was much delighted at the venerable, and picturesque appearance these several old temples presented, as I got within view of them. They reared their sun- burnt tops above the huge trees by which they are surrounded, with all the pride of supe- rior height and age.... The palky bearers, however, appeared to take great delight at the sight of those to them very agreeable novelties [the sculpted decorations], which they took good care to point out to all present" ("Notice of an Inscription on a Slab Discov- ered in February, 1838, by Capt. T. S. Burt, Bengal Engineers, in Bundelkhand, near Chhatarpur," Journal, Asiatic Society of Bengal 8 [1839]: 159-84, esp. pp. 162-63). Measurements of the superstructures vary. For one set, see Alexander Cunningham's Re- port of Tours in Bundelkhand and Malwa in 1874-75 and 1876-77, Archaeological Sur- vey of India, Reports, o.s., 10 (Calcutta: Government Printing Office, 1880), pp. 18-19. 166</page><page sequence="7">History of Religions ence area (mahaman.dapa). The gradual increase in height from the entrance to the sikhara points an insistent, directive finger at the main sanctuary. Close up, the task of orientation passes from the superstruc- tures to the stairs that lead first to the platforms on which the temples rest, then to the mouths of the temples themselves. The disposition of the steps from the ground to the platform varies considerably. At the Laksmana temple, they are in line with the temple's longitudinal axis. At the Visvanatha, two sets of steps approach that axis at right angles. At the remaining temples-the Chitragupta, Devi Jagadambi, and Kan- dariya Mahadeva-one set of steps turns obliquely toward the south. Once visitors are oriented and in motion, instruments of separation signal their arrival at the temple's precinct, then their entrance into the temple itself. The western temples at Khajuraho lack one instrument of separation prominent in many Hindu temples, an enclosing wall. Per- haps the distance worshipers travel to get to the temples, situated apart from any human settlement, creates enough of an initial separation. In any case, the temples' visually impressive elevation creates separation, too. The tops of the temples' platforms and, about twice as high, the floors of the temples' interiors establish two planes that levitate parallel to the ground. Additional features sometimes accentuate the separation that comes with moving from plane to plane. (1) The Laksmana and Vis- vanatha temples have smaller, accompanying temples, roughly in line with their longitudinal axes, that are today dedicated to Devi, Varaha (Visnu's boar incarnation), and Nandi (Siva's bull). The presence of these shrines-on the ground at the Laksmana, on the platform at the Visvanatha-informs visitors that they have arrived at a distinctive place. Freestanding guardians of stone perform a similar function at the feet of the Visvanatha's two north-south stairways, an elephant on each side of the south stairway, a lion on each side of the north.12 (2) At the same two temples, subsidiary shrines occupy-or occupied-the two eastern corners of both platforms, turned so that their entrances faced one another.13 The facing fronts defined broad imaginary lines marking the entrance onto the temple platform proper. The imaginary lines also defined the foot of the stairs leading from the platform to the temple and thus accentuated not only arrival on the platform but departure from it as well. (3) The movement from the platform to the temple may be 12 If the large stone lion on the left side of the approach to the Laksmana temple is in its original location, it performed the same function. 13 The southeast shrine on the Visvanatha's platform is no longer extant. Previous scholars have assumed that the Devi Jagadambi and the Kandariya Mahadeva had sub- sidiary shrines, too; see, e.g., B. L. Dhama, A Guide to Khajuraho, ed. Daya Ram Sahni (Bombay: Times of India, 1927), pp. 9, 11. So far as I know, no one has ever advanced evidence to support these claims; Deva, Temples, 1:95 (cf. Deva, Khajuraho [1986], p. 90), rejects subsidiary shrines at the Devi Jagadambi on just these grounds. 167</page><page sequence="8">A Fitting Approach to God signaled by decorations on the steps. At the Laksmana temple the two lowest steps leading from the platform to the mouth are each inset with a "moon stone," a broad half-moon that anticipates the entrance to the inner sanctum itself. At the Kandariya the same design recurs in the two highest steps of the same course. (4) The entrance to the interiors of the temples is profusely decorated, most notably by elaborately carved fes- tooned arches (makara-toranas, "sea-monster gates"). The Laksmana and the Visvanatha each had one such torana, but the Visvanatha's is now lost. The Kandariya is unique in the western group for having two, one for the passage from the exterior to the entrance, the other for the passage from the entrance to the interior.14 The series of separations creates the expectation that visitors are en- tering an increasingly special place. The temples meet that expectation by organizing their formal and semantic environments. The primary path of approach is the main feature shaping the formal environment. In most cases it runs in and out, more or less along the longitudinal axis of the temples, but at the Visvanatha it runs back and forth, from the Nandi pavilion to the temple and back again. Several variations amplify and thus dignify this path. In approaching these temples, a visitor moves vertically as well as horizontally. The stairs provide a relatively steep ascent, the floor of the interior a more gentle one. Circumambulations-from a minimum of one (on the plat- form at the Devi Jagadambi) to as many as three (on the ground, plat- form, and temple floor at the Laksmana)-add pronounced lateral vectors at right angles to the longitudinal movement. Where visitors make more than a single circumambulation, the radius of their paths varies inversely with the height of the paths. Within the sacred pre- cincts, then, the various paths make gradual, circling ascents along the sides of irregularly shaped cones, whose apexes rest squarely in the in- ner sancta. The doorways effect a different sort of modification, one that alters not the path but its context. The approaching worshipers are engulfed by the temple. They leave a world of light, whose primary boundaries are space, for a world of darkness, whose primary bound- aries are mass. From being mere observers of the temple, they become for the time being parts of it. Elevation, circumambulation, a gradual shrinking of horizons, the transition from exteriority to interiority-each modification of a straight, horizontal procession contributes nonsemantic significance or weight to the point of destination. The temples' decorations and in- scriptions contribute semantic significance, but, aside from the name of 14 The torana in the Visvanatha is missing, but the holes into which it was fitted re- main. See Deva, Temples, 1:87; cf. Deva, Khajuraho (1986), p. 75. 168</page><page sequence="9">History of Religions the deity worshiped, that significance is rarely specific.15 Decorations and inscriptions do, however, clearly articulate two unmistakable themes, the dynastic might of the temples' builders and an occasionally blatant eroticism that consistently attains a sublime grace. The dynastic theme is everywhere, but it stands in the shadows, of- ten literally. The leogryph, a mythical symbol of Chandellan suprem- acy, is a constant feature on the temples' exterior friezes, but only in the most recessed of niches and at times confined to the least visible of rows.16 Where subsidiary shrines and circumambulatories are present, the same figure recurs more prominently on the more frequent and not- so-deep recesses of the friezes' lower courses. Even more prominent, but still not the center of attention, are the leogryphs usually astride the highest half-spires on the front of each sikhara. 17 They announce to all that the king stands only a little below the god. In addition to the leogryphs, military subjects abound in the minor sculptures, such as the friezes that band the Laksmana's platform and the Kandariya's base. For those who can read them, one inscription now in the Laks- mana temple (already mentioned) and two in the Visvanatha link the imperial motifs with specific names. The erotic theme is even more pervasive than the imperial one. The fullness of the carving-solitary figures outnumber couples, and fe- males outnumber males-and the sensuousness of some of the postures irresistibly engage the eyes. General consensus attributes the sexually explicit sculpture to forms of Tantrism prevalent among the Chandellas, and I see no reason to disagree.18 But what environment of meaning 15 For example, after more than forty verses of dynastic bombast in written Sanskrit, one inscription (original location unknown) finishes its praise of the king with a hyper- bolic but generic description of his temple. "(42) He erected this charming splendid home, which rivals the peaks of the mountain snow, for the enemy of the Daityas (Visnu). Its golden pinnacles illumine the sky. On it groups of lotuses are wafted to and fro by multitudes of banners on high poles. At its sight the inhabitants of heaven, met to- gether on festivals, filled with increasing delight, are struck with wonder" (Deva, Tem- ples, 1:340, 346; I have slightly altered the translation). 16 For the Laksmana, it is in the top row of the two-row frieze, for the Visvanatha, the top two rows of the three-row frieze. The south wall of the Visvanatha, between the two balconies, violates the general pattern. There the leogryph occurs in the most recessed niche of the middle row only. To offer a possible explanation for the modification: this face is the first major face worshipers making ritual circumambulation (pradaksina) come to; perhaps the additional erotic panel increases the fascination. 17 At the Kandariyf Mahadeva the leogryph sits atop the second tallest half-spire. 18 See esp. Pramod Chandra, "The Kaula-Kapalika Cults at Khajuraho," Lalit-Kala 1 and 2 (April 1955-March 1956): 98-107. A second possibility, taking its cue from Freedberg, might point to the power that both erotic and sacred images exercise. Com- pare Carlo Ginzburg's comment on the Counter-Reformation: "In the eyes of such a clear-headed theologian as Politi, the common denominator between erotic and sacred images was efficacy" ("Titian, Ovid, and Sixteenth-Century Codes for Erotic Illustra- tion," in Clues, Myths, and the Historical Method, trans. John and Anne C. Tedeschi [Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1989], pp. 77-95, esp. p. 79). 169</page><page sequence="10">A Fitting Approach to God does the eroticism construct for approaching worshipers? At a mini- mum, it places visitors in a realm of wonderfully full, physical, and pro- creative delights such as people generally experience only in fantasies or dreams. But if the decorations assign a subliminal significance to the act of approach itself, the constituent events become extremely sugges- tive: first a playful encircling that excites as it leads ever closer to en- trance, then a vertical thrust, finally penetration into a warm, engulfing darkness along a vector that leads back and forth, in and out. Clearly one can pursue this range of meanings too far. The problem, as always, is knowing how far is too far. Do the sculpted figures ever say no? The journey culminates in a glimpse, a visual encounter with God.19 Despite variations from temple to temple, the same general pattern per- sists. The divine image is seen through a rectangular opening in the east wall of the sanctum. Decorations at the foot of the entrance, often moon stones, mark the transition. Above the opening is a broad lintel with three panels. The panel in the center shows a figure related to the deity enshrined in the temple. With only one exception, the two panels on either end show whichever members of the brahminical triad- Brahma, Visnu, Siva-were not represented in the center.20 On the two sides of the opening toward the base stand goddesses, the rivers Ganiga and Yamuna when they can be positively identified. Lintels, thresh- olds, posts-all provide a frame for the image enshrined in the sanc- tum, whether abstract (the lifigams in the Visvanatha and Kandariya) or representational (Visnu in the Laksmana, Surya in the Chitragupta). The Devi Jagadambi was originally dedicated to Visnu; now it en- shrines Parvati riding an iguana. The temples at Khajuraho are so visually compelling that scholars have often been content simply to describe, catalog, ridicule, and praise them. But when scholars have been more ambitious, they have tended to analyze architectural form according to what we might call, echoing Julian Thomas, a "map's eye view."21 In doing so, they have emphasized learned traditions of building and notions of symbolic rep- resentation within those traditions. As a result, they have also favored, to echo Freedberg, the perspective of an educated elite, those learned in Sanskrit and specialized architectural lore (silpasdstra). The modern inspiration for this approach was the remarkable work of Stella Kram- risch. Michael Meister's convincing correlation of temple design with 19 Freedberg (n. 1 above) discusses the experience of representations as living deities at length; see esp. chaps. 5-7 and his insistence that the familiar hermeneutical, icono- graphical, or cultural-semantic approaches are incapable of doing this experience justice. The Chitragupta, originally a sun temple, has three images of Surya. 21 See n. 8 above. 170</page><page sequence="11">History of Religions traditional, symbolic spatial arrays (mandalas) shows how well such analyses can be done.22 The account presented thus far suggests that the western temples at Khajuraho work on another level, too, a more popular (more vulgar?) one that emphasizes physical movement and nonsymbolic response. They do so by facilitating five successive moments of approach: attrac- tion, orientation, separation, organization (formal and semantic), and encounter. One could say that through general devices of separation and "signification" the successive moments create a distinctive place and object, the temple and its image.23 The names and predications vary, but the continuity of architectural form strongly suggests that, whatever the name, the distinctive object presents the source of both biological pleasure (generativity?) and social order. The presentation is made possible by the generosity of those responsible for overseeing both pleasure and order, the Chandella monarchs. But the preceding paragraph, like the familiar, "map's eye views" with which it is largely commensurate, misses one crucial point. Effec- tive temples, like those at Khajuraho, create a distinctive place and ob- ject only instrumentally. They do so in pursuit of the much broader aim of orchestrating or choreographing an encounter with or approach to that object. That is why the western temples at Khajuraho engage, and must engage, all five moments of approach, not just separation and semantic organization.24 The cumulative effect of the five moments is to create an experience of access to a source of human thriving, a source that is not only significant but ordinarily inaccessible. To the extent that objectifi- cations personalize this source and give it a name-as the images at 22 Michael W. Meister, "Mandala and Practice in Nagara Architecture in North In- dia," Journal of the American Oriental Society 99, no. 2 (1979): 204-19, and "Measure- ment and Proportion in Hindu Temple Architecture," Interdisciplinary Science Reviews 10, no. 3 (1985): 248-58. Stella Kramrisch's classic work is The Hindu Temple, 2 vols. (Calcutta: University of Calcutta, 1946). 23 In using the term signification I risk some misunderstanding. I do not mean signifi- cation in the sense in which, I take it, historians of religions are accustomed to use that term: that the various devices assign meanings or enable elements of the temples to sig- nify something or other. The signification I have in mind is more emotive than cognitive or symbolic. All I mean is that the devices lend significance in the sense of importance or weight to the temples and their constituents. 24 The notion of axis mundi traditional to the history of religions is a good illustration of an attenuated concern only with moments of separation and semantic organization. The first chapter of Jonathan Z. Smith's To Take Place: Toward Theory in Ritual (Chi- cago: University of Chicago Press, 1987) critiques with devastating force Mircea Elia- de's use of certain Australian materials to exemplify the axis mundi, but Smith's critique remains primarily procedural: he indicts Eliade for sloppy scholarship. One could say that another, more pervasive, conceptual error underlies Eliade's treatment of the axis mundi. Eliade's concern with religious ideas as opposed to religious life causes him not to recognize that height might primarily exercise the significant but nonsymbolic func- tion of attracting attention and adding importance. 171</page><page sequence="12">A Fitting Approach to God Khajuraho clearly do-we may call it God. To the extent that the tem- ples are effective-to the extent that people respond favorably to the di- vine presence that they encounter-the temples enable a fitting approach to God. REPERTOIRE, ENVIRONMENT, AMBITION A general account of the moments of approach only begins to explicate the power of the western temples at Khajuraho, their ability to create an approach to God. While every temple in the western group may oc- casion the same five moments of approach, none of the approaches is the same. Three distinct patterns emerge. There are no good labels for them. In the absence of a subtle and compelling formal vocabulary, an overly emotive one will have to do. In brief, the Laksmana and the Visvanatha temples present an approach that is public and majestic; the Chitragupta and Devi Jagadambi present one that is private and allur- ing; the Kandariya, in many respects a mixture and refinement of the two, presents an approach that is remote and uplifting. The approach to the Laksmana and Visvanatha temples is character- ized by an emphasis on the destination as opposed to the path and by a design that fully develops lateral as well as longitudinal dimensions (see fig. 2). Both temples emphasize the destination by accentuating the moment of separation through the full range of devices noted above. The need to separate the sacred precinct from the surrounding environment appears to have been quite strong, because these two tem- ples, the most accessible of the five, employ more devices of separa- tion than any of the others. The intense separation distracts the attention of visitors from the path on which they have come and con- centrates it on the sacred precinct. The emphasis on destination receives additional statement from sev- eral features that articulate a predominant "rectangularity," a laterality that counterbalances the primary longitudinality of the path. The most vigorous of these features are the repeated circumambulations, three at the Laksmana, at least two at the Visvanatha. But other features con- tribute to the same effect. At the Visvanatha temple, the serial proces- sion of the path is abruptly interrupted; when visitors arrive at the platform, they must turn 90 degrees either to the right (to Nandi's pa- vilion) or to the left (to the temple). On both platforms, the open fronts of subsidiary shrines pull visitors at right angles to the steps that lead up to the temple itself. The subsidiary shrines at all four corers of the platform,25 along with the small temples that sit opposite the entrance to the main temples, contribute a horizontal counterweight to the 25 Today the Visvanatha has only two subsidiary shrines. 172</page><page sequence="13">FIG. 2.-Plan of the Laksmana temple.

The decoration echoes the structural rectangularity, too. The Laksmana's and Visvanatha's sculpted figures are not obese or even pleasantly corpulent, like figures in some Euro- pean paintings; nevertheless, they are massive rather than slight. The relative breadth of their limbs and torsos balances any vertical force derived from the erect human posture. The breadth that both structural and decorative laterality provide conjoins with the emphasis on sharply separating the destination from the relatively close vernacular environ- ment to present an approach to the deity that is public and majestic. The Chitragupta and the Devi Jagadambi present a different pattern of approach, one that emphasizes the path as opposed to the destina- tion, horizontality as opposed to rectangularity, and has more overt sexual decoration (see fig. 3). Any number of features direct attention to the path. The two temples entirely lack the additional features that provided separation at the Laksmana and Visvanatha: attendant tem- ples opposite the entrance, guardian animals at the foot of the steps, subsidiary shrines on the platform, makara-toranas.26 Other character- istics emphasize the path, too. A lengthy arm of Siva-sagara originally ran between the eastern and western lines of temples; the relative length of the path around the lake-presumably visitors came up the west bank from the south-added importance to the path.27 The steps from the ground to the platform veer obliquely to the south, gently di- recting worshipers who have made the relatively long journey and soft- ening the separation that would have resulted from a full right-angle turn. At the top of the steps, there are no subsidiary shrines to divert attention at right angles; as a result circumambulation presents a less radical break from the longitudinal path. Because both temples lack circumambulatories as well as subsidiary shrines, there is less to do at the destination when one finally arrives. In addition to giving prominence to the path rather than the destina- tion, these two temples also emphasize horizontality and more overt sexual decoration. In comparison with their neighbors, the superstruc- tures of the Chitragupta and the Devi Jagadambi are remarkably flat: they do not soar at all.28 The absence of an internal circumambulatory 26 The steps have been reconstructed, so it is impossible to say whether they origi- nally contained moon stones or not. 2Several factors indicate an approach from the south. First, the steps at all three tem- ples on the old west bank angle obliquely to the south, in effect greeting and redirecting worshipers approaching from that direction. Second, worshipers would bathe in the sa- cred tank to the south, and for much of the year an approach up the eastern bank and around the north would have provided an indistinct and somewhat sloppy route. Third, an approach up the west bank keeps the tank on the right and thereby accords with de- mands of ritual propriety. 28 The length and breadth of the two temples are generally less than those of the major eastern-line temples, but not by much. Dhama (n. 13 above) provides statistics for all the 174</page><page sequence="15">FIG. 3.-Plan of the Chitragupta temple. (From Krishna Deva, Temples of Khajuraho, 2 vols. [New Delhi: Archaeolog- ical Survey of India, 1990], vol. 2, fig. 15.)</page><page sequence="16">A Fitting Approach to God compounds this effect; circumambulation would have projected a verti- cal axis that restated and reinforced the superstructure's vertical uplift. The dominant horizontality of these two temples makes them into par- asites: they depend on the sanctity of the site and the pull of the other temples to attract visitors. But they also utilize powerful voyeuristic ten- dencies. The topmost of the three friezes, only about half as tall as the other two, presents a sensuous ring of amorous couples standing side by side. The lower two friezes continue the trend. Not only do they portray more couples than the temples in the eastern line, they also exhibit fore- play and coitus more frequently. The intercourse may not be so gym- nastic as some images in the other temples; still, the Devi Jagadambi's "wall walker" and her partner demonstrate remarkable balance and dex- terity.29 Distance, the lack of reverential behavior (subsidiary shrines and circumambulatory), the diminutive appearance, the more frequent erotica-all combine to create a general impression that the Chitragupta and the Devi Jagadambi allow a more intimate, less formal encounter with God in a remote, sequestered, almost forbidden habitation. The Kandariya Mahadeva, in contrast to its immediate neighbors, the Devi Jagadambi and the Chitragupta, reasserts the privilege of the desti- nation, but it preserves at the same time a dominant seriality (see fig. 4). Like the Chitragupta and the Devi Jagadambi, the Kandariya shuns lat- eral distractions. Its platform, intimately attached to the platform of the Devi Jagadambi, bears projections that echo the balconies but impede circumambulation. There is no evidence that the platform ever had sub- sidiary shrines. Most interesting of all, at this temple both courses of steps angle obliquely; from ground to platform and from platform to temple is a straight-ahead ascent. The top course, shaped like an arrow- head, points directly at the mouth of the temple. Despite an absence of laterality, however, several devices reassert the temple's character as destination. The most important is its consistent temples concerned: the Visvanatha-89 feet, 1 inch long, 45 feet, 10 inches wide; the Laksmana-almost exactly the same; the Chitragupta-74 feet, 9 inches long (not count- ing the steps), 51 feet, 9 inches wide; the Devi Jagadambi-73 feet, 3 inches long, 42 feet, 1 inch wide (pp. 11-14). Other authors give slightly different measurements. 29 Besides emphasizing eroticism, the friezes articulate the imperial motif more vigor- ously. The Chandella leogryph is more visible, occurring in the lower two rows, not the upper two. It is also more frequent, at times appearing back-to-back on the Chitragupta, at times alternating with single anthropomorphic figures on the Devi Jagadamba. Most noticeable of all, the leogryphs on these friezes are much less deeply recessed. The vig- orous imperial statement on the friezes offsets some significant losses. The omission of both the circumambulatories and the subsidiary shrines eliminated the two locations where leogryphs figured most prominently in the repertoire. Furthermore, the loss of height makes the temples and, by implication, their sponsors much less imposing. Fi- nally, situating the temples across the lake rendered their influence on areas associated with daily living more remote. 176</page><page sequence="17">LO RCHAEOLOGCAL sUPVY OF :INDIA FIG. 4.-Elevation of the Kandariya Mahadeva.

The Sikhara develops the vertical most notably; it soars to a height almost 120 feet off the ground, the tallest at Khajuraho. Deep, dark, vertical shadows-the visual result of deep recesses-etch the en- tire surface, appearing most forcefully on the sikhara itself. The succes- sion of superstructures defines an arc unparalleled at Khajuraho for its grace and uplift. And unlike the superstructures at the other western-line temples, all of the Kandariya's superstructures remain clearly in view at the foot of the steps; they define an arc that ascends rapidly from right to left. The steps that lead from the platform to the mouth of the temple seem to permit approach from three directions, east, south, and north- but caveat visitator: the northern and southern appendages dead-end about two-thirds of the way to the entrance, leaving those who climb them to ponder the height that impedes their progress.30 The sculpted figures, like figures on Gothic cathedrals, are thin and elongated, making their counterparts on other temples look heavy and awkward. Inside, the temple's porches and balconies provide seats, but seats for giants; ordi- nary mortals must use a ladder to climb up. The Kandariya restores the circumambulatory around the inner sanctum; the bands of sculpted figures that decorate the circumambulatory's walls draw the eyes up as one wends one's way around. Finally, the opening of the sanctum, atop a threshold of four moon stones, sits several feet off the floor, signifi- cantly higher than any other sanctum in the western group. The culmi- nating encounter is profound: the naturally illuminated tip of Siva's lifigam occupies the exact center of the resulting frame.31 Accessible and rectangular, the Laksmana and Visvanatha temples create an approach to God that is public and majestic. Distant and sen- sual, the Chitragupta and Devi Jagadambi create an approach that is private and alluring. But visitors have consistently attributed the most profound effects to the Kandariya Mahadeva. Almost as distant as the Chitragupta and Devi Jagadambi but exceptional in its vertical thrust, the Kandariya creates an approach that is remote and uplifting. The question is, What do we learn from these variations? 30 Contrast the steps at the Laksmana temple, which acknowledge lateral deviation from the longitudinal axis by providing access to the temple's mouth from the south and north as well as from the east. 31 Other characteristics of the Kandariya also help emphasize its nature as destination. The temple articulates a prominent separation, but one that demarcates not so much ar- rival at the precinct as entrance into the temple. the moon stones designs set into the two topmost steps and the double makara-torana are the most important features that create a third, twilight area-the extended porch-which mediates the bright, space-positive exterior of ordinary experience and the dark, mass-positive interior of sacred reality. Rich decoration, stating both the erotic and imperial motifs, contributes to the sense of the temple as destination, too. The Kandariya contains more sculpted figures than any other temple at Khajuraho: Cunningham (Four Reports, n. 5 above) counted 646 figures on the exterior, 226 on the interior. 178</page><page sequence="19">History of Religions At least since Heinrich Wollflin, one trend in art history has attrib- uted stylistic variation to contrasting drives of elaboration and simplifi- cation in artistic evolution. At first sight, developmental demands may seem to account for the variations just observed. But in fact, any such explanation only completes a vicious circle. The accepted chronology for these temples was established in the first place by assuming certain evolutionary trends. In recent years the history of religions has not concerned itself so much with explaining variation over time as with explicating the reli- gious meanings of specific artifacts, or else with using religious arti- facts to exemplify more general meanings. That is, it has accounted for variations not by invoking evolutionary principles but by contrasting meanings and codes in what amounts to a religious linguistics. Does this preference for religion as thought and meaning rather than life re- flect the discipline's hidden roots in theology and philosophy, or-as similar trends in art history would seem to suggest-a more general, intellectualist bias on the part of professional academics? If the variations in the approaches to the western temples at Kha- juraho are not to be simply incidental and uninteresting, they require a different order of account. On the one hand, it is not evident that the approaches to the temples vary directly with any significant religious meanings. Temples to Visnu exemplify the first and second pattern; those to Siva the first and third. The Chitragupta is the odd temple out. Originally dedicated to Surya, it exemplifies the second pattern. On the other hand, it is evident that the articulation of meaning is not what these temples and the approaches to them were ultimately about. It goes almost without saying that, if the variation in approaches is not to be simply incidental, it ought to relate to something significant. It ought to say something, for example, about what makes for a fitting approach to God. My suggestion is this: the variations between the three patterns indicate that a fitting approach must somehow negotiate three different factors: repertoire, environment, and ambition.32 A repertoire is analogous to a code or vocabulary, but it is not actually a code or vocabulary, first of all because it is not primarily a medium for communicating messages. It is more like a style. It encompasses forms and figures whose probability of appearance is high: forms and figures that those charged with design are likely to use, forms and figures that those who visit the monuments are likely to encounter. The synoptic 32 In Patterns of Intention: On the Historical Explanation of Pictures (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1985), Michael Baxandall gives a somewhat parallel ac- count that explains the finished form of an artistic product as the result of a series of decisions mediating the "brief" of the artist and the resources that the artist's culture defines as available; see pp. 5-8, 32-35. 179</page><page sequence="20">A Fitting Approach to God account of the five moments of approach given above has described the repertoire of approach in the western group at Khajuraho in some detail. But a repertoire is only a beginning, never an end; by themselves, the five moments of approach only offer a generic scheme. Otherwise, every temple in the western group would be the same. The temples at Khajuraho do not present an approach to God in a conceptual utopia. They must always operate within environmental possibilities and limitations. The primary environmental variable in the western group at Khajuraho is-or was-the location of the temples with respect to Siva-sagara: Did a given temple sit on the near or far side of the tank's northern extension? The temples on the near side work hard to separate their precincts from the ordinary world; those on the far side are already separate. But the distant location presented other environmental considerations. It would be difficult for a temple on the western bank, given the effects of perspective, to compete in height with temples on the eastern one. The Chitragupta and Devi Jagadambi do not even try; the Kandariya, presumably the youngest of the five, achieves height primarily because it contrasts with its neighbor to the immediate north, the Devi Jagadambi. The greater distance visitors must travel to reach the western-line temples contributes an inevitable seriality to their approach, a seriality that all three temples exploit. In addition, all three temples offer visitors the same motivation "to go the extra mile"-to visit otherwise similar temples that are more remote: a robust voyeurism that derives from the more prevalent erotica.33 But a fitting approach to God does more than adapt repertorial prob- abilities to environmental possibilities. It also satisfies desirabilities. People build and visit temples to fulfill their hopes and ambitions. The Kandariya and the Chitragupta are a good case in point. The two temples are quite different, even though they operate in much the same environ- ment and with much the same repertoire. Those who built them, and those who prefer to visit either one or the other, clearly desire a different kind of approach to God. But in the absence of specific evidence-and there is no specific evidence from the time when these temples were in use-it is impossible to assess the relative weight of different interests, whether symbolic, aesthetic, sociopolitical, or something else.34 33 These temples also provide a more insistent statement of the imperial motif. Per- haps the insistence was necessary because the temples, which themselves stand as mani- festations of imperial power, were more remote. 34 In the fourteenth century, the one ambition that we know of was actually medical. Noting the presence of yogis at the temples, Ibn Battuitah writes: "Many Musalmans fol- low them in order to take lessons from them. It is said that whoever is subjected to a dis- ease like the leprosy or elephantiasis lives with them for a long period of time and is cured by the permission of God" (Ibn Battuta, Rehla [n. 5 above], p. 166). Nothing sug- gests that this ambition was more readily suited to one temple than another. 180</page><page sequence="21">History of Religions Consider only the Kandariya's prominent vertical uplift. For some visitors that uplift might be appropriate to, even necessary in, a temple dedicated to the god whose erect liigam not even Brahma and Visnu could fathom. But members of the dynasty that paid for the temple are likely to have read the temple's supreme height as representative of im- perial prestige, while craftsmen may have been inclined to see height as contributing to the temple's sublime grace.35 Given the potential plural- ity of ambitions, it is arbitrary and unconvincing to fall back upon a methodologism that discovers, then absolutizes, the category it prefers, as historians of religions have done in championing religious symbol- ism at the expense of every other account ("reductionism," "positiv- ism"). Presumably Dhafiga, the king who commissioned the inscription now in the Laksmana temple, Madhava son of Dedda, who composed it, and untutored visitors, who could not read it, approached the Khajuraho temples with very different but very legitimate ambitions. Repertoire, environment, ambition-a powerful approach to a tem- ple must convincingly interweave all three. But while a successful in- terweaving is necessary for the temples to create a fitting approach to God, it is not yet sufficient. As history shows, at least one other re- quirement must be met: visitors must concede that they can legiti- mately approach God through an instrument such as a temple. In the last millennium any number of visitors have admitted the power of ap- proaching Khajuraho's temples without making that concession. Some have found in the temples a powerful invitation to idolatry, others sub- lime cultural treasures. Both discoveries have altered the approaches to the temples tremendously. THE HISTORY OF APPROACHES The early history of the temples of Khajuraho is inseparable from that of Islam. The temples' builders, the Chandellas, established their inde- pendence and preeminence by warding off Muslim attackers. But they could not hold off the pressure forever. By 1335, Ibn Battutah wrote of 35 The ability of the same constructed form to carry a variety of symbolic meanings, not all of them mutually compatible, is a much-observed characteristic of architectural and artistic products in general. Compare, e.g., Carlo Ginzburg's comment on Fritz Saxl's interpretation of a Holbein woodcut: "It is always risky to compare a woodcut with a verbal statement: an image is inevitably more ambiguous, open to several inter- pretations" ("From Aby Warburg to E. H. Gombrich: A Problem of Method," in Clues, Myths, and the Historical Method (n. 18 above), pp. 17-59, esp. p. 32). Another essay in the same volume, "The High and the Low: The Theme of Forbidden Knowledge in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries" (pp. 60-76), notes the widespread and intimate re- lationship between height and political power (p. 63). On the imperial attitude at Kha- juraho, see the inscription now at the Laksmana temple cited in n. 15 above. So far as I know, nothing at the Kandariya explicitly articulates the account of Brahma and Visnu trying to fathom Siva's lifigam. 181</page><page sequence="22">A Fitting Approach to God "Kajarra": "there is a great pond about a mile in length near which are temples containing idols which the Muslims have mutilated."36 About a century and a half later, a retreating Sikander Lodi added his ham- mers to the effort. But Khajuraho did not suffer total devastation at Muslim hands. More fateful was the general neglect that ensued. In the early 1800s a British surveyor simply passed the site by; he had seen no more than overgrown rubble in the jungle. For those, then, to whom the power of Khajuraho's temples was the dreadful power to tempt to idolatry and sin, the appropriate response was one of censorship: icon- oclasm to destroy the offending images, neglect to block the avenues of approach. But iconoclasm and neglect did not block the avenues of approach completely. T. S. Burt, the engineer who revealed Khajuraho to the British in 1838, found a light that burned all night long in the Matafi- gesvara, the one temple still in use. A generation later, Alexander Cun- ningham noted that pilgrims customarily visited the overgrown western group of temples to celebrate Mahas'ivaratri.37 It is understandable that during the Victorian era British engineers would feel compelled to pass religious and moral judgments on the site. But despite necessary dis- claimers the temples at Khajuraho were generally taken as signs of the great, if somewhat misguided, classical civilization whose guardian- ship Britain had assumed. The Archaeological Survey of India began serious work clearing and restoring the site. After independence Kha- juraho continued to provide cultural and economic benefits: a set of world-class monuments, one of India's many bequests to the human race, that also happened to be a source of revenue, drawing tourists from around the globe. The recognition that the temples at Khajuraho were cultural and com- mercial treasures mandated yet more changes in the manner in which the temples were approached. It required an approach that provided both limited and ready access to a site that, in stark contrast to its sur- roundings, was cleaned and polished-a visiting room near the front door, sequestered from the private quarters where people actually lived. The statues and rubble scattered about were collected and, when appro- priate, put on display, either in the temples themselves (cf. the inscrip- tion cited earlier) or in Khajuraho's museum. Later accretions were removed like so much dust; only the "original" structures were deemed presentable. Necessary missing features were restored, for example, courses of steps. What good is an old temple that tourists cannot enter? 36 Ibn Battuta, Rehla (n. 5 above), p. 166. 37 Burt (n. 11 above), p. 166; Cunningham, Four Reports (n. 5 above), 2:438. 182</page><page sequence="23">History of Religions Hydrological engineering removed the arm of Siva-sagara, which used to separate the temples, especially during the monsoon, and thus pro- vided direct access from the eastern line of temples to the western one. A fence has been erected to keep out unwanted-usually unpaying- guests. At night the temples are closed but not entirely inaccessible: well-aimed spotlights create a wonderful vista. Across the street from the entrance a bevy of shops has grown up, and the immediate vicinity now boasts several hotels of varying quality-all in an area where Cun- ningham could detect no signs of previous, permanent habitation. The Khajuraho Development Plan is even more ambitious. It calls for a mall to fill the entire region to the east of the western group with a service village, restaurants, cafes, shops, art galleries, emporia, a museum, public conveniences, gardens, terraces, a mela ground, and more.38 The point is not to lament the alterations that the approaches to the temples have undergone but to note that the search for ready but lim- ited access to tourist attractions has required changes in what were once fitting approaches to God. The temples in the southwest-the Devi Jagadambi and the Kandariya Mahadeva-have changed the most. Instead of approaching the temples from the south, with a pow- erful lateral view, visitors generally approach them from the relatively less impressive front.39 To arrive at the temples, one crosses a broad, open expanse of parkland-beautiful, to be sure, but a flat plane from which the temples arbitrarily emerge. The oblique angling of the steps, which once greeted visitors, can now only puzzle those who notice it. Those with sharp eyes will note, too, that, unlike the superstructures in the eastern line, the superstructures in the western-line temples are consistently, significantly, and annoyingly out of line. Earlier visitors would not have cared: the Chitragupta and Devi Jagadambi are so flat that the full complement of superstructures cannot be seen from the foot of the steps, the Kandariya Mahadeva so lofty that, again from the foot of the steps, the successive pinnacles of the superstructures define a beautifully smooth, graceful, and swiftly ascending arc. Even subtler features hint, too, at approaches that can now be recalled only in the haze of time. When I visited the Kandariya Mahadeva, flowers rested reverently atop the lingam and before the female image in the center of the doorsill. There was even a hole in the fence to the south, reminis- cent of the old approach up from the west. Through it a herder was sur- reptitiously, and I assume illegally, driving animals for grazing. 38 Khajuraho Development Plan (Draft) (Madhya Pradesh: Town and Country Plan- ning Department, 1975), fig. 8-3. It is also possible to approach the temples from the Chitragupta temple to the north. 183</page><page sequence="24">A Fitting Approach to God REPLACING THE CENTER Historians of religions have generally preferred to take a "map's eye view" of religious places. The tendency is perhaps most evident in the engaging writings of Jonathan Z. Smith, who not only explicates maps of religious reality with extreme subtlety but also adopts cartography as a primary metaphor for his study. But the map's eye view extends far beyond Smith. It dominates, for example, Mircea Eliade's reflec- tions on sacred centers, against which Smith has so much to say. From Eliade talk of centers passed to Charles Long, who gave insightful hints-but no more than hints-about the different modes in which the sacred manifests itself in space for transhumant and settled peoples. In describing settled peoples, Long depended heavily on Paul Wheatley's preeminently cartographic notion of the ceremonial center. David Carrasco has extended that model by exploring the dynamics of center and periphery in Mesoamerican religions. Recently, and far beyond the narrow carrels in which historians of religions work, the move to the periphery has spawned a gold rush. Displacing the center has become a semipopular fashion. The margins and limits are now the locations of choice, and the goal of empowering the powerless, of giving the mar- ginal a voice, is the cause of the day.40 No one can dispute that human beings have the ability to imagine their environments from perspectives that are not immediately avail- able. There were globes long before there were photographs from outer space, and painters produced admirable, if at times bizarre, overhead views of towns well before hot air balloons made those views a reality. 40 For Jonathan Z. Smith, see esp. To Take Place, chaps. 3, 4, and his earlier collec- tion of essays, Map Is Not Territory (Leiden: Brill, 1978). Mircea Eliade's notions are fa- miliar to all historians of religions; see esp. "Sacred Places: Temple, Palace, 'Centre of the World,'" in Patterns in Comparative Religion, trans. Rosemary Sheed (New York: New American Library, 1963), chap. 10, pp. 367-87, "Symbolism of the 'Centre,'" in Images and Symbols: Studies in Religious Symbolism, trans. Philip Mairet (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1969), chap. 1, pp. 27-56, and "Sacred Space and Making the World Sa- cred," in The Sacred and the Profane, trans. Willard R. Trask (New York: Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, 1959), chap. 1, pp. 20-65. Charles H. Long's hints appear in "Conquest and Cultural Contact in the New World," chap. 7 of Significations: Signs, Symbols, and Images in the Interpretation of Religion (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1986), pp. 97-113. Among other influences, Long cites the important study by Paul Wheatley, The Pivot of the Four Quarters: A Preliminary Enquiry into the Origins and Character of the Ancient Chinese City (Chicago: Aldine, 1971). The notion of the ceremonial center and the dynamics of center and periphery are central to David Carrasco's thought on Mesoamer- ican religions: see his general introduction, Religions of Mesoamerica: Cosmovision and Ceremonial Centers (San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1990), and his rich article, "The Sacrifice of Tezcatlipoca: To Change Place," in To Change Place: Aztec Ceremonial Landscapes, ed. David Carrasco (Boulder, Colo.: University Press of Colorado, 1991), pp. 31-57. For an insightful discussion of what we might consider spatial margins, see Juan Campo's recent book, The Other Sides of Paradise: Explorations into the Religious Meanings of Domestic Space in Islam (Charleston: University of South Carolina Press, 1991). 184</page><page sequence="25">History of Religions But in life, as opposed to in books or pictures, sacred structures are ex- perienced in the movement of the body through space. To be sure, scholars like Smith and Carrasco have recognized the importance of bodily movement, but they have carried it to cartographic conclusions. They see motion through space as inscribing a ritual map or construct- ing a sacred environment. This article has preferred instead to replace the fundamentally static vocabulary of center and periphery with the more dynamic vocabulary of approach and destination. In its terms, the temples at Khajuraho are not so much sacred centers from which the universe radiates but occa- sional destinations to which certain paths lead. They are not sources or beginnings but temporary end points where ordinarily inaccessible re- sources for living can be found. What is religiously important about the temples at Khajuraho-or any temple, for that matter-are not the meanings in which the temples trade or the landscapes that the temples and their rituals construct but the manner in which the temples operate, their power to enable a fitting approach to God. Along with the shift in vocabulary, then, come two other shifts. First comes the recognition that sacred architecture has more important things to do than to construct a universe of meanings. The temples at Khajuraho do not really clarify meanings.41 They only hint at them in the service of a more dynamic purpose, the enabling of a confrontation with and appropriation of the religious resources that worshipers and their communities (feel they) need to thrive. In the same vein, the Kha- juraho temples do not provide scenery for a sacred spectacle that wor- shipers observe, nor are they concerned with creating landscapes imprinted by performance as ends in themselves.42 The "landscape"- the formal and semantic environment that the temples create-is part of an architectural apparatus that constructs a sacred path. It conducts worshipers through a series of actions and impressions designed to en- able religiously significant movements of entrance and encounter. Second, the shift lends plausibility to what at first sight must seem one of Freedberg's most outlandish suggestions: "In no case is it useful to introduce the notion of symbolism." Freedberg is obviously wrong. The Christian theologians who developed the reformed theology of the Lord's Supper would vehemently disagree. There are examples in sacred architecture, too, when a failure to introduce symbolism would miss the point. Place a baptistry at the entrance to a church, a symbol of resurrec- tion in its chancel (such as the triumphal arch and heavenly half-dome 41 See again the quote from Ginzburg, "From Aby Warburg to E. M. Gombrich" (n. 35 above). 42 Today, however, the temples do provide occasional backdrops for secular specta- cles sponsored by the tourism industry. 185</page><page sequence="26">A Fitting Approach to God apse in basilican churches), and the path connecting them deliberately symbolizes the procession of life from birth to resurrection. But despite a regnant-and unacknowledged-Neoplatonism, ac- cording to which homines religiosi never bow down to wood and stone, only to the sacred for which wood and stone are merely sym- bolic vehicles, Freedberg has his point.43 There are cases in which it is not useful to introduce the notion of symbolism. The approach to the western temples at Khajuraho is one of them. For devout visitors, these paths do not symbolize a human path to God. They are paths to God. To introduce the notion of symbolism would be-perhaps deliber- ately-to miss the point.
