An assessment of test repeatability is one of the requirements necessary to accept the test procedure as viable. Previous methodologies, coefficient of variation (CV) and similarity analysis were developed to assess the repeatability of vehicle and occupant response in motor vehicle crash tests for full frontal and 40% overlap tests procedures. These will be used for this assessment. Three repeat tests were performed in each test procedure, with all other factors held constant: vehicles of the same make, model, and model year; moving deformable barriers of the same mass, velocity, and barrier face properties; and the same occupant - a THOR 50th percentile adult male in the driver's seat. In general, for this one vehicle make and model the repeatability of both vehicle and occupant response metrics were good for both test modes. In isolated cases, differences in occupant response resulted from the timing of side curtain air bag deployment.

The vehicle parameters include the actual overlap of the test (target point location), how the vehicle crushes and/or intrudes, and the acceleration/velocity of the vehicle. Figure 5 shows that the RMDB impacted the desired target within 25 mm for the 6 tests performed. Figure 6 (a) and Figure 6 (b) shows the bumper beam crush for SOI and Oblique test procedure, respectively. It can be seen from Figure 6 (a) that SOI_1 had 129 mm difference in the x- direction when compared to SOI_2 and SOI_3. SOI_2 and SOI_3 had similar x-direction crush. Figure 6 (b) shows the oblique bumper crush was similar for each test. The max x- direction difference was only 58 mm. Figure 6. Bumper crush Figure 5. Distance from target point Figure 7 (a) and Figure 7 (b) shows that the door profile was similar for both the SOI and Oblique test procedure. When looking at the lower rocker panel the max difference in the x-direction for the SOI tests was 52 mm and 59 mm for the oblique tests. Figure 8 (a) and Figure 8 (b) show row 2 of the toepan x, y, and z intrusions for SOI and Oblique, respectively. Figure 8 (a) shows that SOI_3 had the highest intrusion in the X- direction and SOI_1 had the highest intrusion in the Z- direction. Figure 8 (b) shows Obique_1 had the highest intrusion in x, y, and z direction. The max difference for the SOI procedure occurred at A2Z and was 97 mm, whereas the max difference was 14 mm for the Oblique procedure. Figure 7.

It should be noted that the Z intrusion for the SW was flipped for graphical purposes. The X- direction intrusions were similar for both the left and right IP and the SW for both SOI and Oblique procedures (Figure 9 (a) and Figure 9(b)). The Z-direction intrusion for the left and right IP and SW showed the most variability for the SOI procedure. Figure 10(a) shows that the left rear sill X-direction acceleration had similar shape and timing of peak Gs. Figure 10(b) shows that the Oblique test procedure had similar shape, but different timing of peak Gs.

Safety / Volume 1, Issue 2(August 2013) 315 RESULTS: OCCUPANT RESPONSE Before the repeatability of occupant response can be assessed, the occupant environment must be evaluated for repeatability. There are three components to the assessment of occupant response repeatability: initial occupant position, acceleration pulse, and restraint performance. Initial occupant position During the setup of the repeated tests, care was taken to ensure that a consistent position of the THOR ATD in the driver's seat was achieved for each test. Measurements were recorded using a digital three-dimensional spatial measurement device and compared with the first test in each condition during the positioning process. The occupant position was very repeatable in the X-Z plane (Figure 14), where the maximum test-to-test difference in the position of Figure 12. (cont.) Left rear sill y-acceleration the Head CG marker was 9.4 millimeters in X-axis, and 16.2 millimeters in the Z-axis. There was greater variation in the Y-axis, where the position of the Head CG marker in SOI_1 was 28 millimeters inboard. The H-point marker was within 13.4 millimeters of the remaining tests, suggesting that the THOR ATD was leaning slightly inboard for this test. Figure 14. Initial X-Z plane position of the head, shoulder, hip, knee, and ankle. Acceleration pulse As shown in Figure 10 and Figure 11, the acceleration pulses were generally similar in magnitude and shape, but showed some localized differences. For instance, the SOI peak vehicle acceleration in test SOI_1 showed very similar timing of the peak, but was lower in magnitude by 6.6 g. However, the peak accelerations tend to occur before the occupant is fully restrained by the lap and shoulder belt, so these localised differences are not realized in the occupant response. Restraint performance There were several differences in restraint performance that may have contributed to differences in occupant response in the repeated SOI and Oblique tests. Although there were two exceptions, the restraint deployment times were consistently within two milliseconds for all tests (Table 3). Figure 13. Left rear sill y-velocity One exception was test SOI_2, where the side curtain air bag deployed very late in the event after the point of peak head </page> <page sequence="8"> 316 Saunders et al / SAE Int. J. Trans. Safety / Volume 1, Issue 2(August 2013) excursion, and the seat-mounted torso air bag did not deploy. Occupant kinematics Another exception was test Oblique_2, where the side curtain and torso air bags deployed roughly ten milliseconds after In each of the two RMDB comparison groups, the they deployed in tests Oblique_1 and Oblique_3. Also of note response of the THOR ATD in the driver's seat demonstrated is that the frontal air bag, knee bolster air bag, and retractor good qualitative repeatability in terms of gross kinematics as pretensioner trigger times occurred earlier in the event in the well as phase, magnitude, and shape of the kinetic responses. Oblique tests than in the SOI tests, though the side curtain There were localized differences in occupant kinematics, and torso air bags deployed slightly later in the Oblique tests. specifically motion of the head, which resulted fromdifferences in restraint deployment. In the SOI_2 test, the Table 3. Deployment times, in milliseconds after impact, side curtain air bag does not deploy until after the time of of the driver-side restraint systems peak head excursion. Since the head is not restrained by the side curtain air bag, it rotates about its local Z-axis roughly 45 degrees more than the head does in the SOI_1 and SOI_3 tests (see bottom row of Figure 17). As a result, the head acceleration (Figure 18) and angular velocity (Figure 19) time-histories for SOI_2 are different in shape and magnitude than those for SOI_1 and SOI_3. Since the head was not restrained by the side curtain air bag in SOI_2, the linear acceleration showed a lower peak and a In terms of restraint loading of the occupant, the belt longer duration than the remaining SOI conditions, resulting tension time-histories of the shoulder belt showed generally in a lower HIC15 value. Conversely, since there was a greater good repeatability (Figure 15), with peak loads showing CV magnitude of angular rotation and angular velocity, the % of 2% and 6% for the SOI and Oblique conditions, associated BRIC value was higher (Table D1 in Appendix D). respectively. The lap belt tension time-histories were not as repeatable as those of the shoulder belt (Figure 16), with peak loads showing CV% of 13% and 10% for SOI and Oblique, respectively. Figure 17. Occupant initial position (0ms) and position of peak forward head excursion (125ms) in the SOI test Figure 15. Lap belt loads measured in the SOI condition. condition. In the Oblique RMDB test condition, the timing of deployment of the inflatable restraints was more repeatable than in the SOI condition. As a result, the interaction of the THOR with the restraint system and the position of the head at the point of peak excursion were very similar in the three Oblique tests (Figure 20). In all three tests, the head first contacts the frontal air bag and begins to rotate roughly 45 degrees in the positive direction about the local Z-axis, then is restrained from further rotation by the side curtain air bag and retains this position throughout ride-down.

Head resultant acceleration in the Oblique As suggested by the similar rotation of the head at the test condition. point of peak excursion, the angular velocity of the head in all three Oblique tests is nearly identical, especially to the point of peak forward excursion at 100 milliseconds (Figure 22). The linear acceleration of the head shows an overall similar shape and magnitude, except for a peak in the Oblique_2 condition between 60 and 70 milliseconds (Figure 21). The difference appears to stem from the fact that the side curtain air bag deploys 10 milliseconds later in the Oblique_2 condition than the other Oblique tests. In Oblique_1 and Oblique_3, the side curtain restraint is fully deployed when the head has translated forward and outboard far enough to contact it. However, in Oblique_2, the head has translated far enough forward and outboard that is impacted by the side curtain air bag as it deploys, resulting in a large magnitude Figure 22.

This Oblique test condition. difference leads to a higher calculated HIC15 value in the Oblique_2 condition, though this difference is not apparent in the HIC36 calculation (Table), most likely due to the Occupant injury assessment relatively short duration of the difference. A set of injury assessment value (IAV) metrics wereselected for the purposes of this comparison based on the available measurements and the existence of at least preliminary injury assessment reference values (IARVs) for the THOR ATD. Initially, event timing was included, but is not presented here because it was found that when the </page> <page sequence="10"> 318 Saunders et al / SAE Int. J. Trans. Safety / Volume 1, Issue 2(August 2013) calculations showed good agreement, the timing of the event value of 1.0 would indicate that the measured value was showed as good or better agreement. For instance, when two equal to the injury assessment reference value, which in turn HIC values differed by more than 20 percent, the timing of is associated with a given probability of a specific injury. As the event tended to be noticeably different. Presenting an overall assessment, the metrics that suggest the highest differences in both the timing of the head impact event and probability of injury include BRIC, acetabulum resultant the calculated HIC values was thought to be redundant. force, tibia index, and ankle rotation. These metrics show good agreement with the field injury exposure [10], where the body regions with the highest incidence of injury were the knee/thigh/hip, chest, lower extremity, and head. One limitation to this assessment is that the relationship between injury risk and chest deflection as measured by the THOR ATD has not yet been developed. The injury metrics that show the greatest dispersion among the repeated SOI and Oblique tests are HIC, BRIC, and Tibia Index. The differences in HIC and BRIC most likely result from differences in restraint timing, wherein each condition included a test with a delayed side curtain air bag deployment that influenced the result of one test, while the remaining two tests showed similar values. Tibia Index, on the other hand, did not follow this same pattern. Specifically, the upper left Tibia Index calculation resulted in three widely different values for each condition. To quantify these differences, the coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated for each of the two groups (SOI and Oblique) for each IAV (Table 4). Overall, the CV values were considered acceptable (below 20%) aside from three exceptions. First, the HIC15 calculation in the Oblique condition showed a CV of 28%. This is likely due to the spike in head acceleration caused by late deployment of the side curtain air bag, as the remaining conditions showed very similar HIC15 values and the HIC36 showed a CV of only 4% for the same set of tests. Second, the upper left Tibia Index had a CV of 21% and 36% for the SOI and Oblique groups, respectively. One possible reason for this large discrepancy was that instrumentation errors plagued the upper tibia load cell throughout these tests, resulting in questionable data measured for the upper tibia axial compressive force. Thus, the revised tibia index calculation relied on just the X- and Y- axis moments. It is also possible that difference in the recorded moments resulted from localized deformations of the instrument panel and interaction of the upper tibia with the knee bolster air bag. Finally, the right lower Tibia Index in the Oblique condition showed a CV of 21%. The reason for the relatively Figure 23. Summary of the occupant response IAVs in high CV in this case appears to be related to instrumentation the SOI (shades of red) and Oblique (shades of blue) issues, as the quality of the data recorded by the tibia load repeated tests. IAVs are normalized by the associated cells and used to calculate tibia index (z-axis force, x- and y- IARV for the given metric. axis moment) show irregularities that could be related toelectrical interference in the load cell or the cables. In order to further investigate the importance of the differences in injury assessment values (IAVs) for repeated tests, the IAVs were normalized by the associated IARVs for all of the injury metrics that were available to both the THOR ATD in the SOI and Oblique RMDB tests (Figure 23).

A list of tests used for this analysis is included in the Appendix E for the 56 kph full frontal an Appendix F for the 60 kph 40 percent overlap. Since many of the full frontal tests include only two data points per group, CVs were not calculated as these would not be particularly meaningful for these conditions. Instead, the difference in each pair or triplet of crash tests (indicating an identical vehicle, occupant, and test condition) was determined, and from all of the differences an Figure 25.

For the Full Frontal and ODB groups, the differences in IAV values for each matching test was determined, and the average of all of the differences was taken. For the SOI and Oblique groups, maximum difference between any two of the tests was determined and compared to the average Figure 27. Average difference in the time Peak Gs differences. The complete list is shown in Table D2 in occurred appendix D. Figure 29 summarizes these data by presenting anormalized value consisting of, as the numerator, the average difference or maximum difference in IAV value between repeated tests, and as the denomonator, the maximum of these four values. For 11 of the 15 IAVs, the maximum difference between any two repeated SOI or Oblique tests was lower than the average difference in the same IAV among the full frontal or ODB groups. These conditions are considered to have good repeatability since the test results are as repeatable as an existing crash test condition. There was 1 IAV for which the maximum difference in the repeated SOI tests was greater than the average difference in the full frontal or ODB tests: pelvis acceleration. The difference in peak pelvis acceleration in the SOI tests stems from the X-axis acceleration for test SOI_1. While similar in shape and timing to the other SOI tests, is much different in magnitude (Figure 30). Since the lap belt loads were higher for this test (Figure 15), it was expected that the pelvis X-axis Figure 28. Average difference in DV in the X-direction acceleration would be higher than the other SOI tests.

For the right femur, the difference of 14g. average difference in the full frontal tests is over 80 percent of the maximum difference in the repeated Oblique tests. As discussed earlier, differences in left upper Tibia Index were likely a result of faulty instrumentation. Figure 30. Pelvis X-axis acceleration in the SOI tests. DISCUSSION Figure 6 showed that SOI_1 had more crush than SOI_2 and SOI_3. The Cruze 20 percent overlap target point ended up aligning with part of the frame (Figure 31). From this figure it can be seen that SOI_1 hit 3 mm to the left of the target point, while SOI_2 and SOI_3 hit approximately 25 mm to the right. This 28 mm more overlap may have caused the frame to deform differently than SOI_2 and SOI_3 (Figure 32). The frame for SOI_1 deformed inward and upward (Figure 32 (a)), while SOI_2 and SOI_3 the frame had a slight outward deformation and less deformation (Figure 32 (b)). Even though the bumper crush was different for SOI_1 the door post-test profile, toepan intrusion, left and right IP, and SW intrusion did not seem to be effected as much as expected, except in the Z-direction. Figure 29. Comparison of the average difference in IAVs for repeated tests to the maximum difference in repeated tests in the SOI and Oblique conditions. There were 3 IAVs for which the maximum difference in the repeated Oblique tests was greater than the average difference in the full frontal or ODB tests: left and right femur peak compressive force, and left upper Tibia Index. Figure 31. Target point relative to the longitudinal rail For the left femur, the maximum difference in the Oblique tests is very similar to the average difference in the ODB tests </page> <page sequence="14"> 322 Saunders et al / SAE Int. J. Trans. Safety / Volume 1, Issue 2(August 2013) test conditions were toepan intrusion and steering wheel intrusion. In the case of toepan intrusion, the associated occupant response (revised tibia indices) also showed large differences. However, it is surprising that while the tibia measurements were among the least repeatable in the SOI and Oblique tests, the ankle rotations, especially plantar- and dorsiflexion, were among the most repeatable measures. This suggests that larger-scale intrusions may have been similar in order to impart similar gross motions on the feet of the occupant, while there may have been differences in localized loading (for instance, contact between the upper tibia and a different portion of the knee bolster air bag) that drove differences in the load paths to the lower extremity. The steering wheel intrusion is an area where the occupant itself may have influenced the repeatability of the measured intrusion - and vice-versa. In test SOI_1, the steering wheel intrusion was 75 to 86 millimeters higher in the vehicle Z-axis direction than in the other SOI tests. Inspecting the post-test positions of the steering wheel rims (Figure 33), it appears that the steering wheel in SOI_1 was pushed upwards, towards the IP, and rotated about the vehicle Y-axis compared to the steering wheel in test SOI_3. One possibility for this change in post-test position is the interaction with the occupant in the driver's seat during the crash. Looking at the chest deflection measured by the THOR, the upper right compression in test SOI_1 is 20% higher in than the corresponding measurement in tests SOI_2 and SOI_3. A possible explanation for this difference could be that the occupant in SOI_1 was positioned slightly farther inboard (note that the head was 28 millimeters farther inboard in this test), which could have resulted in more interaction between the steering wheel rim and the upper right chest at Figure 32. Frame deformation comparison between the point of peak forward occupant excursion. The side-view SOI_1 and SOI_2 and SOI_3 onboard high-speed video suggests that this difference is possible, but it is obfuscated by the deployed frontal air bag. It is difficult to compare this current repeatability study to As measured by the response of the occupant, the SOI and previous research that has addressed the repeatability of Oblique test procedures showed similar repeatability.

As such, this comparison is not biased by Hybrid III series of ATDs in full frontal and oblique test rating schemes that may have large allowances and conditions. However, the repeatability and potentially the nonuniform ranges for specific injury metrics. For instance, durability of the lower extremity hardware and the New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) ratings are based instrumentation must be closely monitored in test conditions on varied probability ranges (0.2 for 2 stars, 0.05 for 3 and 4 such as SOI and Oblique, where intrusions can occur at rates stars) which are calculated from nonlinear probability that exceed those of the hardware certification requirements. functions [11].

The repeatability of the SOI condition, even though it was expected to be less repeatable due to having less involvement with the longitudinal rail of the impacted vehicle, was not markedly lower than that of the Oblique condition. 2).  The differences that did occur in the occupant response as measured by the THOR ATD in the driver's seat primarily resulted from differences in structural intrusions into the occupant compartment and from differences in deployment times of the inflatable restraints, primarily the side curtain air bags.
