<plain_text><page sequence="1">2007-01-0367 An Evaluation of Laminated Side Window Glass Performance During Rollover Peter Luepke, Michael Carhart and Jeffrey Croteau Exponent, Inc. Richard Morrison and Joseph Loibl Glass &amp; Glazing Forenslcs Jack Ridenour Ford Motor Company Copyright © 2007 SAE International ABSTRACT In this study, the occupant containment characteristics of automotive laminated safety glass in side window applications was evaluated through two full-scale, full- vehicle dolly rollover crash tests. The dolly rollover crash tests were performed on sport utility vehicles equipped with heat-strengthened laminated safety glass in the side windows in order to: (1 ) evaluate the capacity of laminated side window safety glass to contain unrestrained occupants during rollover, (2) analyze the kinematics associated with unrestrained occupants during glazing interaction and ejection, and (3) to identify laminated side window safety glass failure modes. Dolly rollovers were performed on a 1998 Ford Expedition and a 2004 Volvo XC90 at a nominal speed of 43 mph, with unbelted Hybrid II Anthropomorphic Test Devices (ATDs) positioned in the outboard seating positions. Vehicle dynamics, occupant kinematics, and glazing failure modes were evaluated through: on-board instrumentation, analysis of on-board and off-board high speed video and film, a survey of the evidence in the rollover debris field, and post-test inspection of the vehicle, ATDs, and glazing. Laminated side window safety glass did not prevent complete ejection of the ATDs. Five of the six ATDs in the Expedition were completely ejected from the vehicle, and 3 of the 4 ATDs were fully ejected in the XC90 test. Containment of the two ATDs that were not completely ejected was unrelated to glazing contact; the laminated window adjacent to each ATD vacated the window opening and both were partially ejected during the roll sequence. Side window glass fracture and failure was observed in association with ATD loading, ground contact deformation, and combinations thereof. On the basis of the performance observed in this study, it is concluded that heat-strengthened trilaminate glass is not a suitable candidate for occupant containment during rollover. Comparison of these full-scale rollover tests to prior laboratory-based evaluations of laminated side glass demonstrates that the prior studies fail to account for several aspects of the rollover environment, which contribute significantly to glazing loading, fracture, and failure. INTRODUCTION Over the past decade, there has been a trend toward increasing availability of vehicles equipped with laminated side glass. For example, in the 1996 model year, no U.S. make or model (with sales in excess of 1,000 units) was offered with laminated side glazing. By model year 2006, the number of models available with standard or optional laminated side glazing had risen to 35, and it is estimated that nearly 4.9% of U.S. vehicle sales are equipped with some side windows composed of heat-strengthened laminated safety glass (Glass and Glazing Forensics, 2006). This increasing market availability is attributed to the properties of laminated side glass with respect to noise attenuation, theft deterrence, and solar control. The PVB interlayer significantly reduces the transmission of ultraviolet radiation. Special treatments in conjunction with the vinyl interlayer can provide attenuation of the infrared energy transmission. While it has been previously demonstrated that the 3- point restraint is highly effective in preventing occupant ejection and reducing the incidence of serious and fatal injuries, it has been suggested that the heat -strengthened safety trilaminate side glass currently used in some production vehicles can contain occupants during rollover collisions. To date, there are no published full-scale vehicle tests that support this assertion. In fact, review of published literature revealed only limited laboratory-based evaluations of the containment characteristics of heat- 113</page><page sequence="2">strengthened trilaminate glass (Willke, et al., 1999; Atelsek et al., 1995; Kramer et al., 2006). A NHTSA sponsored program performed by Willke et al. (1999) evaluated the retention properties of prototype high- penetration resistant (HPR) and non-HPR heat-strengthened trilaminate glazing using an 18 kg (40 lbs) guided impactor at a nominal impact speed of 24 kph (15 mph). The prototype window-door assemblies evaluated were heavily modified to enhance glazing retention and load transmission to the door assembly. The non-HPR formulation trilaminate was unable to contain the impactor under these conditions; however, with sufficient door modifications, the HPR formulation was reported to contain the impactor under a single impact. In earlier work, Atelsek et al. (1995) demonstrated that chemically tempered trilaminate glass with a nylon plastic interlayer was able to contain the 18 kg (40 lbs) impactor for a single impact at 24 kph (15 mph); however, the tests reported were conducted with the glazing fully fixed at the perimeter using a laboratory fixture. In contrast, Kramer et al. (2006) conducted drop testing onto production door-window assemblies equipped with HPR formulation heat-strengthened trilaminate glass, which had been pre-fractured as a result of vehicle deformation. Under this condition, the production door-window assembly did not contain a partial ATD weighing 18 kg (40 lbs) at an impact speed of 13 kph (8 mph). Extrapolation of these limited test results to real-world rollover occupant containment is complicated by several factors. First, the NHTSA indicated that their 18 kg (40 lbs) guided impactor was, "designed to replicate the loading of an occupant's head and shoulder during typical ejection situations" (Willke, 1999). However, prior sled testing and finite element modeling performed by the Agency demonstrated that this 18 kg (40 lbs) impactor significantly underestimated the effective mass of an occupant under the conditions it was designed to replicate (Atelsek et al., 1995; NHTSA, 1996). Second, the door-window systems previously evaluated by NHTSA are not representative of production systems; Willke et al. (1999) indicated that production feasibility and consumer acceptance was considered, but not evaluated. Third, single impact laboratory testing protocols fail to replicate the multitude of occupant postures that have been observed in prior simulation work (e.g., Atelsek, 1995) and full-scale rollover testing (Orłowski et al., 1985), nor do they account for the centrifugal loading generated during rollover or the prolonged loading or multiple impacts that occur during a real-world rollover. Finally, no full-scale rollover testing has been conducted on heat-strengthened laminated safety glazing to evaluate its capacity to mitigate ejection of unbelted occupants in the rollover environment. The objective of this study was to evaluate the occupant containment characteristics of heat-strengthened laminated safety glass in side windows within the rollover environment. To accomplish this objective, a pair of full-scale dolly rollover crash tests was performed with two different sport utility vehicles containing unbelted ATDs. Observations and analyses of these tests regarding occupant kinematics, glazing fracture, failure mechanics, and occupant containment versus partial and complete ejection are presented and discussed in the context of prior work regarding trilaminate safety glass. METHODS A pair of dolly rollover crash tests was conducted using a 1998 Ford Expedition and a 2004 Volvo XC90. These tests were conducted at Exponent's Test and Engineering Center in Phoenix, Arizona. The test vehicles were positioned on the FMVSS 208 dolly rollover fixture in a driver's side leading configuration. The fixture supported the test vehicle at a 23-degree roll angle, measured from the horizontal. The leading side tires rested against an angled 4-inch steel flange, such that the bottoms of the leading tires were 9 inches above the crash rail surface. The dolly and test vehicles were accelerated up to a nominal speed of 43 mph via a continuous wire rope driven crash rail system. Snubber tubes filled with energy absorbing aluminum honeycomb were used to rapidly decelerate the dolly and initiate the vehicle rollover event onto a 6-inch-deep compacted desert dirt surface (Figure 1 ). Figure 1. individual frames captured from high- speed video depicting the Ford Expedition (top) and the Volvo XC90 (bottom) following separation from the rollover dolly. The speed of the dolly and test vehicle at initiation of the rollover sequence was measured using the crash rail speed trap positioned just before the point where the dolly engaged the snubber tubes. On-board vehicle 114</page><page sequence="3">instrumentation included Systran Donner roll and yaw rate sensors (models QR ¿14-1000-102 and QR S11- 0200-200) mounted along the vehicle centerline near the center of gravity. Three high-speed and two real-time cameras recorded the vehicle dynamics and ATD kinematics from three ground-based locations. The XC90 test utilized two additional ground-based high-speed film cameras. High- speed cameras were mounted on-board each vehicle to capture the ATD kinematics from both front and rear views. Detailed pre- and post-test still photographs were taken of the test vehicles, ATDs, glazing, and the rollover surface, which included aerial post-test photos. Additionally, the rollover surface and debris field was mapped with a laser total station (Leica TPS300 Series, Leica Geosystems AG, Switzerland) following the Expedition test, and an ArcSecond Vulcan measurement tool following the XC90 test. Un-instrumented Hybrid-ll 50th-percentile ATDs were used as occupant surrogates for both tests. A H-ll 50th- percentile male ATD is sized to represent a 7.8 m (5'7") standing height and has a nominal weight of 75 kg (166 lbs). These ATDs were initially configured in an upright seated position and unrestrained. Lightweight breakaway string tethers were used to maintain the position of some of the ATDs on the passenger side of the vehicle while the dolly/vehicle combination was accelerated toward the snubber tubes. Prior to the installation and positioning of the ATDs inside the test vehicles, each vehicle was ballasted to achieve the as-received curb weight and weight distribution. 1998 4-DOOR FORD EXPEDITION Six ATDs were positioned inside the vehicle at the outboard seating positions for the first, second, and third rows of the vehicle. Hereafter these ATDs and positions will be referred to as 1L, 1R, 2L, 2R, 3L, and 3R. To provide high-speed camera coverage for the 3rd row occupants, the rear hatch glass was removed and a high-speed film camera was secured to the rear hatch and body of the vehicle. All airbags were disabled on the vehicle. The hood and all doors were bolted closed via welded tabs in order to isolate the issue of occupant containment using side glazing. The test weight and distribution of the Expedition with all equipment installed and positioned was within 2 to 4.5 kg (5 to 10 lbs) of the as-received weight of 2,551 kg (5,625 lbs), while front to rear axle distribution (52/48) matched the as-received condition. Once the 6 ATDs were positioned, the vehicle test weight was 3009 kg (6,634 lbs). The four-door Expedition was manufactured with tempered safety glass for all window positions with the exception of the front windshield. The tempered safety glass at all movable side window locations and the fixed, perimeter bonded rear quarter window locations was removed and replaced with appropriately sized laminated safety glass. The side windows used in this test were fabricated from heat-strengthened laminated safety glass by a Ford Motor Company approved original equipment supplier. The thickness of the heat-strengthened laminated safety glass side windows was identical to the thickness of the OEM equipment provided for the Lincoln Navigator, Lincoln Aviator, Crown Victoria, and Mercury Marquis, where this trilaminate glazing configuration was used for the purpose of sound attenuation. For the windows of the front doors, HPR formulated, heat-strengthened safety glass, having a nominal overall thickness of 3.81 mm (0.150") and a HPR PVB interlayer nominal thickness of 0.61 mm (0.025") was utilized. These windows were readily available as OEM replacement glass for the Lincoln Navigator, and conformed to the geometry and attachment mechanics used to secure the tempered safety glass in the as- received Expedition. New clips, identical to production clips, and silicone adhesive were utilized to install glass into the four moveable door-window locations. The installation was performed by a professional glass installer in accordance with Ford Recommended Installation Procedures. For the rear doors and rear fixed quarter windows, side window glazing having the same thickness specifications (i.e., 0.150" nominal thickness, 0.025" HPR PVB interlayer) was custom fabricated to the geometry of the respective window openings and component hardware. For the fixed rear quarter glass, all old sealant material was removed and new prep, priming, and urethane adhesive materials were utilized. The installation was performed by a professional glass installer in accordance with Ford Recommended Installation Procedures. The installation procedure utilized the same adhesive and primer materials as used in the installation of laminated safety glass in windshield locations. Exemplars from the batch of the heat-strengthened laminated safety glass side windows were subjected to critical safety impact and durability tests contained in the FMVSS #205 Glazing Materials. These tests were performed by the glass manufacturer, and confirmed conformance to the applicable impact and durability tests. The annealed laminated safety glass windshield in the Expedition was original equipment, installed in the vehicle at the time of manufacture. The original equipment windshield was marked by the fabricator, indicating conformance with the applicable requirements of the FMVSS #205 Glazing Materials. 115</page><page sequence="4">All moveable windows were fully closed in their respective perimeter channels and the non-moveable quarter panel glass was bonded at the appropriate locations relative to the plane of the side quarter panel body. All adhesive materials were then allowed to cure for 72 hours prior to test execution. 2004 4-DOOR VOLVO XC90 Four ATDs were positioned inside the vehicle at the outboard seating positions for the first and second rows on the left and right side (denoted as 1 L, 1R, 2L, 2R). The test weight and distribution of the XC90 with all equipment installed was within 2 to 4.5 kg (5 to 10 lbs) of the as-received weight of 1,969 kg (4,341 lbs), while front to rear axle distribution (54/46) matched the as- received condition. Once the 4 ATDs were positioned, the vehicle test weight was 2,274 kg (5,013 lbs). The roll sensor and side canopies were disabled on the vehicle for the test. The hood and all doors were bolted closed via welded tabs in order to isolate the issue of occupant containment using side glazing. Laminated side door window glass was only offered as part of a security option package in the XC90, and only in model years 2003 through 2005. After searching extensively for a XC90 equipped with laminated safety side window glass, a tempered safety glass equipped 2004 Volvo XC90 was purchased. Tempered safety glass was removed from the side doors and replaced with OEM replacement laminated safety glass for the Volvo XC90. These movable replacement laminated glass windows came equipped with the lower edge supports positioned and adhered to the glass. These lower edge supports were used to attach the laminated glass to the window regulator system. The laminated door windows were fabricated of heat- strengthened laminated safety glass. This glass was manufactured by Volvo's approved equipment supplier. The thickness of the heat-strengthened laminated safety glass side windows was a nominal 5.0 mm (0.197") total thickness. The laminate incorporated a PVB interlayer having a nominal thickness of 0.76 mm (0.030"). This glass is thicker than the 3.8 mm (0.150") tempered safety glass found in the fixed rear door windows and the quarter windows of the vehicle as delivered. All constructions of 5.0 mm (0.197") heat-strengthened laminated safety glass side windows contained a trademark indicating that the glass complies with Federal and European safety impact and durability tests for the laminated construction. All movable windows were then fully closed in their respective perimeter channels prior to the dolly rollover test. The 5.41 mm (0.213") annealed laminated safety glass windshield in the Volvo was original equipment, installed into the vehicle at the time of assembly with urethane adhesive. The original equipment windshield was trademarked by the fabricator indicating that the glass conformed to the applicable Federal and European requirements for glazing materials. The fixed encapsulated quarter windows of the rear doors and the fixed quarter windows were original equipment and were 3.8 mm (0.150") tempered safety glass, and were installed in the vehicle at the time of assembly. The tempered safety glass backlite was also original equipment. The backlite was trademarked by the fabricator indicating that the tempered safety glass conformed with the applicable Federal and European requirements for tempered glazing materials. RESULTS 1998 FORD EXPEDITION Vehicle Dynamics The Expedition was traveling at 69 kph (43.2 mph) at dolly contact with the snubber tubes. It subsequently completed 4 rolls and traveled approximately 36.6 m (120 feet) before coming to rest on its tires, at a yaw angle of approximately 45-degrees from its original yaw orientation (see Figure 2). The calculated average translational deceleration for this rollover was 0.52 g, using a distance from the end of the snubber tubes to the point of rest. The vehicle rolled with minimal change in pitch for much of the rollover. In an event that spanned slightly more than five seconds from beginning to end, the Expedition was in contact with the ground for 88% of the time. Of the four opportunities that the left and right roof rails could have made ground contact, each experienced three clear impacts; during roll three it appeared that very light ground contact occurred to each roof rail. Notably, the ground contacts to the roof rails occurred predominantly between the A and C-pillars. While significant ground contacts occurred to the wheels, tires, and side body areas of the vehicle, the first two rolls primarily involved contact to the roof rails and roof. During the third and fourth rolls, ground contacts also occurred to the corners and sides of the vehicle. Following departure from the dolly and the initiation of tire/wheel contact and furrowing, the vehicle roll rate climbed to about 400 degrees per second (deg/s). As the first full revolution progressed, the roll rate climbed for a short time to above 600 deg/s after the right roof rail contact, and then reduced to approximately 530 deg/s. During the second revolution, roll rates decreased to approximately 450 deg/s. The roll rate continued to decrease, and was approximately 350 deg/s by the end of the third roll. By the end of the fourth roll, the roll rate had been reduced to about 200 deg/s. The Expedition rolled slightly beyond the 4 roll orientation, balancing shortly on its left side tires before rolling back onto all four tires and coming to rest. 116</page><page sequence="5">Figure 2. Diagram of Expedition rollover sequence, including glass breakage, ATD ejection, and ATD and glass rest positions. 117</page><page sequence="6">Glazing All six heat-strengthened laminated safety glass windows fractured and either vacated the opening or were torn and penetrated by the ATDs during the rollover (Figure 3). All four movable door windows were displaced from the seals due to occupant loading and centrifugal force. Following displacement out of the window frame seals, forces on the windows were sufficient to exceed the cohesive strength of the laminate in 3 of the 4 positions, and these windows were ejected from the vehicle (Figure 4). Only the right rear movable window remained attached to the vehicle; however, it fractured and vacated the window opening. The fixed rear quarter windows on the left and right sides of the Expedition remained attached to the vehicle at the perimeter; however, each sustained cohesive failure due to occupant loading and was penetrated by the adjacent ATD. The forces generated during the rollover exceeded the cohesive strength of the laminate in the left rear quarter window, and it experienced a centrally located laminate tear and a large central piece was ejected from the vehicle. The entire perimeter glass of this window remained attached to the adhesive product and the vehicle body window frame. The right rear quarter window fractured and the interlayer tore as a result of the forces in the rollover. All perimeter glass remained attached to the adhesive product and the vehicle body window frame. The displaced glass pieces are depicted and located in debris field of Figure 2. The windshield, fabricated of annealed laminated safety glass and installed into its opening with a urethane adhesive system, was not retained within the opening. The forces of the accident exceeded the cohesive capability of the nominal 5.18 mm (0.204") thick windshield and the HPR PVB. As a result, the laminate sheared around its periphery leaving glass fragments of the inner glass ply attached to the urethane adhesive as it was avulsed from the vehicle. Only the fixed encapsulated tempered safety glass windows positioned in the rear doors remained intact during the roll sequence. Fractography was utilized to identify fracture origins and the state of stress on each ply of the laminate at fracture (Figure 5). This analysis demonstrated that each side window fractured as a result of loading patterns that produced tension on the outboard surface of each ply, and compression on the inboard surface. This was consistent with outward occupant loading or predominantly vertical compression of the outwardly convex window surface. None of the windows exhibited fracture patterns consistent with exterior contact, which would be associated with an outside-to-inside load direction. Figure 3.

Pre- and post-test photographs of the test vehicle depicting fracture origins for the inner and outer plies of the Expedition laminate glazing for the left and right sides of rows 1-3. 119</page><page sequence="8">Occupant Kinematics and Ejections Five of the six unrestrained ATDs were ejected during the rollover. All of these ATDs were ejected out of their adjacent window opening, with ejections observed from both the "high" and "low" side of the vehicle. Three of the five ATDs were ejected from the high side of the vehicle, were thrown between 85 and 138 feet longitudinally and as high as approximately 30 feet above the ground, and cleared the roll path of the vehicle (Figure 6). The two ATDs ejected on the low side were projected into the roll path, and rolled over by the vehicle. The single unejected ATD (2L) was projected to the perimeter of the vehicle interior, and remained in contact with the roof with its head and neck lodged against the C-pillar. However, the adjacent laminated window vacated the window opening and permitted partial ejection of the arm and left shoulder of the ATD (Figure 7). Occupant posture at glazing contact, fracture, and ejection was variable (Figure A-1 in the appendix and Figures 8-1 , 8-2, and 8-3 in the text). For example, the 1R ATD contacted the glazing with its head and outboard shoulder, displacing the window and door frame outboard and away from the roof rail and B-pillar. It continued loading the window and door until the right side roof rail and door frame made ground contact at 14 revolution. The ATD was briefly redirected into the vehicle following ground contact, but was ejected just after 1 revolution in a head and shoulder leading orientation. In contrast, the 1L ATD initially interacted with the adjacent side glazing in a buttocks leading orientation. Ground contact occurred to the left side of the vehicle in the % roll orientation, while the ATD pelvis was in contact with the left front window, and fracture occurred as a result of the combination of occupant and ground contact loading. The ATD was subsequently partially ejected in a pelvis leading orientation beginning at the % roll orientation. Ground contact with the pelvis forced the ATD back into the vehicle, driving the head and torso into the left front seat back. The ATD then quickly moved back towards the window opening of the left front door and was completely ejected in a pike position, with the posterior pelvis leading the movement and the anterior torso folded towards the anterior legs. The complete ejection occurred shortly before the vehicle completed 2 rolls, resulting in a high-side ejection. Both 3rd row occupants were displaced upward and outward during the early portions of the roll sequence, and each maintained a seated posture but rotated with respect to the vehicle so that they were facing the roof of the occupant compartment (Figures 8-1, 8-2, and 8-3). Each occupant presented its outboard shoulder, hip, and leg to its respective window. As the ATDs continued to load the windows in these orientations through the airborne and ground contact phases of the rollover, fracture and tearing of the laminate occurred. The 3L ATD loaded and then penetrated the adjacent fixed laminated safety glazing between 1 % and 2 rolls, and was fully ejected on the low-side following the 2nd complete revolution. The 3R ATD was partially ejected through the adjacent fixed laminated glazing at approximately 1 revolution, and fully ejected on the low side of the vehicle at 1 14 revolutions. 2004 VOLVO XC90 Vehicle Dynamics The XC90 was traveling at 69 kph (42.9 mph) when the dolly contacted the snubber tubes. The vehicle then completed 4-14 rolls, coming to rest on its left side, approximately 35 m (115 feet) from where it left the dolly. At its rest position, the XC90 was yawed approximately 90 degrees, with its front bumper facing the path over which it rolled. The average translational deceleration was 0.53 g's, using a distance from the end of the snubber tubes to the point of rest. The vehicle initially began to roll with minimal change in pitch, however, it transitioned into a football-like roll (large pitch change) throughout the middle and ending rolls, striking corners and changing pitch/yaw orientations. The time of the event from dolly release to rest position was slightly more than five seconds, and 67% of that time was spent with the vehicle in contact with the ground. Of the four opportunities that the left and right roof rails each had to contact the ground, each sustained only two impacts, and these roof rail ground impacts occurred during the first two rolls. The roof and roof rails escaped any ground contact during rolls three and four. In total, the vehicle was airborne for 33% of the rollover event. Roof rail contacts during roll one appeared to include the length of the roof, from the A to D-pillars, with the contacts during the second roll focused on the forward portions of the roof rails and roof. The rear tires and wheels, and the rear bumper areas experienced the ground contacts during roll three. Roll number four started with ground contacts on the left side tires, was airborne while the vehicle was inverted, contacted the right quarter panel and right rear tire/wheel pitched nose-up, and subsequently landed on the left front corner with the rear of the vehicle pitched in the air. The vehicle continued to roll and yaw onto its left side as it came to rest. After the vehicle departed from the dolly and the left side tires and wheels contacted and furrowed into the ground, the roll rate climbed to about 350 deg/s. The roll rate increased further during the first roll, exceeded 600 deg/s and then decreased to approximately 550 deg/s. Roll rates during the second roll were between 450 and 550 deg/s. The third roll experienced decreasing roll rates from about 400 to 450 deg/s. During the fourth roll, the roll rate dropped to approximately 220 deg/s as the vehicle came to rest on its left side. Three of the four unrestrained ATDs were ejected during the rollover and all four laminated windows fractured and presented ejection portals. Each ejected ATD exited the vehicle through its respective heat-strengthened laminated safety glass window opening. Figure 9 depicts the rest positions of the vehicle, glass, and all ejected ATDs for the XC90 test. Table 1 compares the results of the two dolly rollover tests. 120</page><page sequence="9">Figure 6.

Following fracture, they vacated their respective openings as shown in the post-test photographs in Figure 10. All the door windows vacated their respective openings due to the forces exceeding the cohesive strength of the laminate, and were avulsed from the vehicle. Three of the four ATDs were ejected through the portals created by the fracture and subsequent displacement of the glass. The 2R ATD was partially ejected during the rollover through the adjacent window opening. The Volvo was equipped with tempered safety glass in 5 positions. Three of the tempered windows were fractured and vacated their openings. Both small, encapsulated, fixed, tempered safety glass door windows were fractured due to deformation during the rollover and vacated their respective openings. The left side fixed, tempered safety glass quarter window fractured and vacated the window opening during the rollover. The initial fracture origin was in the top, front quadrant of the window, and occurred due to deformation of the glass. The right side quarter glass did not fracture despite adjacent body panel damage and significant outward bowing of the window. The tempered safety glass in the backlite also did not fracture during the rollover. The windshield was fabricated of annealed laminated safety glass. It was not retained within the opening during the rollover; forces of the test exceeded the cohesive capability of the windshield and the HPR PVB. The fracture initiated along the roof and subsequently caused cohesive release of the glass around the entire periphery of the windshield. The central area of the windshield was avulsed and completely vacated the opening, creating a potential portal for ejection. There was no occupant contact with the windshield, and none of the ATDs were ejected through this opening. Fractography was utilized to identify fracture origins and the state of stress on each ply of the laminate at fracture (Figure 11). The analysis demonstrated that each side window fractured as a result of loading patterns that produced tension on the outboard surface of each ply, and Figure 10. Post-test photographs of the Volvo XC90 at its point of rest. compression on the inboard surface. This was consistent with outward occupant loading or predominantly vertical compression of the outwardly convex window surface. None of the windows exhibited fracture patterns consistent with exterior contact, which would be associated with an outside-to-inside load direction. Occupant Kinematics and Ejections Three of the four unrestrained ATDs were ejected during the rollover. All ATDs were ejected out of their adjacent window opening, from both the high side and low side of the vehicle. The driver ATD (1L) was ejected in a high side vehicle orientation. The 2L ATD was ejected from the low side and deposited while simultaneously being rolled over. The 1 R ATD was ejected from the low side and projected forward of the vehicle, only to be contacted and rolled over later in the roll sequence. The single partially ejected ATD (2R) was projected to the perimeter of the vehicle interior, and remained in contact with the roof with its head and neck lodged against the C-pillar (Figure 7). The adjacent laminated window vacated the window opening and permitted partial ejection of the right arm of the ATD. Similar to the Expedition, occupant posture at glazing contact, fracture, and ejection was variable (Figure 12, and Figure A-2 in the appendix). For example, the right 125</page><page sequence="14">XC90: Glass Fracture Origins Figure 1 1 . Pre- and post-test photographs of the test vehicle depicting fracture origins for the inner and outer plies of the XC90 laminate glazing for the left and right sides of rows 1 and 2. 126</page><page sequence="15">front ATD contacted the glazing with its head and outboard shoulder while the lateral aspect of its torso heavily loaded the upper door panel at the belt line. The glazing fractured prior to vehicle-to-ground contact at 14 revolution. Following ground contact, the window was rapidly (less than 100 ms) displaced out of the seal in apparent response to the rotational motion of the vehicle, and preceding the ejection motion of the ATD in a head and shoulder leading orientation at just after 1 revolution. In contrast, the left front ATD (1L) initially sustained only limited contact with the adjacent side glazing due to pocketing of its head into the roof rail adjacent to the window opening. Despite this constraint, glazing contact loads associated with the ATDs left arm and left leg were sufficient to fracture the glazing prior to 3/4 revolution. The ATD remained largely constrained by head-to-header and lateral pelvis-to-door contacts until the 3rd complete roll. Analysis of video/film footage demonstrates progressive outward bowing and displacement of the window under loading with the ATD arm and upper leg during rolls 2 and 3. A vehicle-to-ground wheel strike following the completion of the 3r roll dislodged the ATDs head from the roof rail and generated a lateral deceleration of the vehicle. In response, the ATD was displaced outboard into the glazing in a head, left shoulder, left arm, and left knee leading posture. The door frame was displaced away from the vehicle body, and the glazing was pushed out of the window frame as the ATD was ejected through the window opening between 3% and 3% revolutions. The left rear ATD (2L) initially contacted the interior side header directly above the left rear door window. The ATDs head remained in contact with the side header until the first ground contact on the driver's side of the vehicle at 14 revolution. During this contact, the glazing fractured and the ATDs head moved inboard. The lower portions of the ATD subsequently moved outboard in a feet and buttocks leading orientation. The adjacent movable window was displaced out of the frame before % revolution, and was followed by additional outward movement of the ATDs lower left leg and pelvis. The ATD was subsequently deposited onto the ground buttocks and legs first at 1 14 revolution. The left roof rail and roof of the vehicle rolled onto the mid torso and legs of the ATD. As the vehicle continued to roll, the upper torso and head vacated the vehicle interior and the ATD was deposited on the ground. See Figures 13-1 and 13- 2 for images of the XC90 ATD postures and ejections. The observed kinematics of the ATDs, as well as the post test deformation of the upper interior door structures at the 1 R and 2R positions, indicated a high level of ATD interaction and loading of these areas (Figure 14).

Still photographs of the XC90 interior door deformation on the right side. DISCUSSION Eight of the ten unrestrained ATDs in these two full- scale rollover tests were completely ejected from the vehicles. Film and video analysis indicated that containment of the two unejected ATDs was associated with contact to the vehicle perimeter (roof panel, interior roof rail, interior of the door and pillars), and was not related to the glazing. In fact, the laminated safety glass side windows adjacent to each of the unejected ATDs vacated the respective window openings early during the roll sequences, and did not mitigate the potential for ejection. Analysis of the kinematics of these two ATDs demonstrated periods of partial ejection through the adjacent window openings. Like the ATDs, the majority (7 of 8) of the movable laminated side windows evaluated in these tests underwent cohesive failure and were completely ejected from the vehicle. The single movable window that remained attached to the vehicle was displaced out of the seal, and did not present a barrier to occupant ejection. Despite full perimeter bonding, a greater overall thickness, and a closer mean proximity to the roll axis compared to the side windows, both annealed HPR trilaminate windshields also vacated the vehicle during the roll sequence. Fracture, cohesive failure, and separation of both windshields occurred in the absence of occupant loading. In both tests, only tempered side glazing remained un-fractured through the rollover sequence. On the Expedition, only the fixed tempered safety glass windows of the rear doors were intact following the test. For the Volvo, the fixed tempered right rear quarter safety glass and the rear fixed window were intact following the roll sequence. In all, six different combinations of HPR formulated trilaminate glass and retentions systems were evaluated in these two tests. This includes windows having a nominal thickness of 3.8, 5.0, 5.2, and 5.4 mm, and PVB interlayer thicknesses from 0.61 mm to 0.76 mm. The trilaminate side windows were affixed to the vehicle in a variety of ways, including various lengths of lower edge brackets, and single (interior) or double (interior and exterior) metal flanges around the perimeter. Attachment methods also included fully perimeter bonded rear quarter windows on the Expedition and the windshields of both vehicles. None of the laminated configurations were sufficient to contain the ATDs in these tests. Seven of the eight moveable laminated side windows fractured and vacated the respective window opening within the first two revolutions. Only one movable side window remained attached to the vehicle, however, it was also displaced from the window perimeter. Further, the fully perimeter bonded right rear quarter window in the Expedition was penetrated within 1 revolution, while the left rear quarter window was bulged outward due to occupant contact at 1 % revolution and penetrated prior to 2 revolutions. The overall performance of the glazing in these two rollover tests was remarkably similar. The vehicle ground contacts in each test, however, were markedly different, despite sustaining the same number of complete rolls. The Expedition was in contact with the ground for a vast majority of the roll sequence (88%), impacting the structures surrounding most of the windows repeatedly, and in fact, impacting the upper vehicle structures on each of the 4 rolls. Only the structural areas surrounding the fixed rear quarter glass escaped deformation due to ground contact. While the body and roof areas adjacent to the rear quarter glass did impact the ground, it was not until the vehicle came into contact with an ejected ATD that any significant deformation was produced. Despite the absence of structurally damaging ground contacts, the glazing of each fixed rear quarter window fractured and the windows cohesively failed as the respective ATD penetrated through the HPR formulated trilaminate. In contrast, the XC90 spent considerably more time in airborne phases, with ground contact comprising 67% of the total roll time (88% for the Expedition). When the vehicle did contact the ground, many of those contacts were to areas below the belt line. The XC90 escaped contact to the upper vehicle structure during two of the 4 complete revolutions. Despite the relatively low exposure to roof and window deformation-causing ground contacts, each and every XC90 laminated window fractured and vacated its respective window opening. 129</page><page sequence="18">Analysis of these two rollover tests revealed that moderate to major structural damage to the vehicle near the window openings is not necessary for the fracture and displacement of trilaminate glazing. Despite differences in glazing and PVB thicknesses, as well as differences in window retention systems and designs, equivalent results were observed in both tests. Film analysis of the unrestrained ATD kinematics observed in these tests revealed a wide variety of ATD postures at glazing interaction and ejection. These included head and shoulder (Expedition 1R; Volvo, 1L &amp; 1R), buttocks leading (Expedition, 1L), feet first (Volvo 2L), and lateral aspects of the torso and buttocks (Expedition, 3L &amp; 3R). The variable postures and ejection characteristics were associated with not only rotational forces and changes In the vehicle orientation, but also a variety of vehicle-to-ground impacts involving tire and wheel strikes as well as roof and body structure. These observations are consistent with simulation studies evaluating unbelted occupant postures at glazing contact (Atelsek et al., 1995), as well as prior dolly rollover testing using unrestrained ATDs (Orłowski et al., 1985). In contrast, restrained occupants are typically tethered to the vehicle via the lap portion of the seat belt, with their heads and upper torsos moving upward and outward toward the roof rail under the influence of vehicle rotation (Bahllng et al., 1990; Moffatt, et al. 1997, 2003; Newberry et al., 2006). With the occupant motion constrained by the restraint system, the head and shoulder are likely candidates for contact to adjacent glazing. NHTSA has previously evaluated occupant effective mass for rollover and side impact using a combination and sled and pendulum testing. That work assumed that occupants interact with glazing in an orientation consistent with an upright belted occupant (i.e., head and shoulder leading), and yielded occupant effective masses for rollover of up to 445 N (100 lbs) (Atelsek et al., 1995). Follow-up finite element simulations revealed that the contact energy of the full ATD was underrepresented by an 18 kg (40 lbs) impactor (Atelsek et al., 1995; NHTSA, 1996). The occupant kinematics observed in this study demonstrated that unbelted occupants interact with glazing in body postures and orientations that reflect a greater proportion of body mass loading into the glazing (e.g., see Figures 8-1, 8-2, and 8-3). Efforts to contain unrestrained occupants in rollover collisions generate high levels of dynamic loading due to: (1) unbelted occupant posturing, (2) occupant effective mass, (3) the presence of centrifugal forces associated with glass and occupant interaction within the vehicle, (4) the presence of occupant loading due to vehicle linear and angular accelerations, and (5) occupant-to-glazing impacts. The demands placed on glazing by these factors are grossly under-represented by tests involving low-mass impactors or partial ATDs under linear impact conditions. Since issuing their closing report (Willke et al., 2001), NHTSA has been pursuing a rollover test program which utilizes complete ATDs in a rolling fixture which generates more realistic roll rates, but does not account for vehicle deformation or linear decelerations (Willke et al., 2003). This move appears to acknowledge the importance of at least some of the factors enumerated above. Their significance can also be appreciated through the robust nature of the test results observed In these two tests, as well as the vehicle deformation associated with occupant contact to areas other than the glazing (see Figures 13-1 and 13-2). CONCLUSIONS 1 . Laminated safety glass, heat-strengthened or annealed, in overall thicknesses ranging from 3.8 to 5.4 mm, is not effective in mitigating occupant ejection. 2. Door-window systems equipped with HPR- formulated trilaminate glazing and modified to increase the retention of glass components do not have sufficient strength to contain unrestrained occupants under rollover conditions. 3. Analysis of the occupant kinematics observed in these rollover tests demonstrated a variety of occupant postures during glazing contact, loading, and ejection. 4. The interaction between unrestrained occupants and the vehicle interior during rollover accidents generates high dynamic forces due to: (1) unbelted occupant posturing, (2) occupant effective mass, (3) the presence of centrifugal forces associated with glass and occupant containment within the vehicle, (4) the presence of occupant loading due to vehicle linear and angular accelerations, and (5) occupant- to-glazing impacts. 5. The dynamic rollover forces and the factors described generate glazing loads that overwhelm the capacity of heat-strengthened trilaminate glazing with overall thickness up to 5.0 mm and PVB interlayer thickness up to 0.76 mm. 6. While movable windows are subject to push-out due to occupant loading, occupant contact forces observed in these tests were sufficiently large to penetrate through fully perimeter bonded trilaminate glazing. 7. Prior component-level laboratory testing involving impactors striking door-window systems does not adequately predict performance under rollover conditions. Specifically, component-level tests fail to account for the appropriate effective mass of an unrestrained occupant, as well as the glazing loads generated due to: (1) centrifugal force, (2) vehicle- to-ground impact, (3) post-fracture occupant contact, (4) multiple impacts, and the (5) superposition of forces imparted on glazing in the rollover environment. 8. On the basis of the performance observed in these full-scale rollover tests, heat-strengthened trilaminate glazing is not suitable for occupant containment during rollover. 130</page><page sequence="19">ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors gratefully acknowledge Janine Pierce (Exponent) for her contribution to the organization and presentation of the data presented in this paper.

(FMVSS 208) Heat Strengthened Laminated Safety Glass: Two or more pieces of sheet, plate, or float glass are bonded together by an intervening layer or layers of plastic material. Each glass piece of the laminate is processed separately such that it can be heat treated to impart a surface strength greater than that of standard laminated glass. When broken the break pattern is similar to that of annealed laminated glass. When cracked, the pieces of glass tend to adhere to the plastic. Laminated Safety Glass: Two or more pieces of sheet, plate, or float glass bonded together by an intervening layer or layers of plastic material. It will crack or break under sufficient impact, but the pieces of glass tend to adhere to the plastic. (FMVSS 205) Safety Glass: Safety glazing materials predominantly ceramic in character that meet the appropriate requirements of ANSI/SAE Z26.1, including (but not limited to) laminated and tempered glass. (Ref. 1 ) Tempered Safety Glass: A single piece of specially treated sheet, plate, or float glass possessing mechanical strength substantially higher than annealed glass. When broken at any point, the entire piece breaks into small pieces that have relatively dull edges. (FMVSS 205) Adhesive failure: The release of the window component, or part thereof, from any of the individual components comprising the adhesive system, or the release of the adhesive system from the substrate. Cohesive failure: The separation of the glazing integrity, or parts thereof, to such an extent that the individual parts comprising the glazing components are sufficiently fractured and torn, thereby creating an opening. 132</page><page sequence="21">APPENDIX Figure A-1.
