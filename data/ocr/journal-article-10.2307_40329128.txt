<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN THE STUDY OF AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINAL ART By Ronald M. Berndt SOCIAL anthropologists only occasionally turn their attention to art, and then usually with some uneasiness. There is the lurking suggestion that this interest, however indirect, might on the one hand undermine their scientific approach, and on the other call forth from their colleagues one of the current terms of disparagement : ethnologist or ethnographer, with museum or ' cultural ' leanings. I realize of course that there are outstanding exceptions ;x but it still seems necessary to emphasize that art is a legitimate topic for anthropological consideration, and one which has not had the attention it deserves. People in many non-literate societies spend a great deal of time and energy in the production of objects which may or may not be designed with a ' practical ' purpose in mind, but which, while not being objete d'art can be referred to as ' artistic ', in the sense that an aesthetic element is involved. This is not necessarily because such objects are referred to by some term like ' beautiful \ but because they are culturally congenial, in accordance with the local canons of good taste.2 They strike a special chord of ' meaning ' relevant to the members of the social unit concerned. In other words, such productions have significance in social as well as in cultural terms : whether highly conventionalized or naturalistic, they are symbols which convey meaning. They tell us something about the kind of society and culture in which they are found, in much the same way as does, for instance, oral and written literature, or ritual and ceremony. This, however, is a question not only of aesthetics, but also of values and of style. Since this is not a study of the empirical context of Australian Aboriginal art, I shall not discuss the many excellent works on this subject.3 Nor does this paper deal with the subject of one people's response to the art of another. The question whether the decorative productions of societies other than our own constitute art in 1 E.g., R. Firth (1951 : Chapter V) ; E. Leach (1956 : III). See also M. Schapiro, in Kroeber ed. (1953 : 287-312). In this paper I shall be speaking specifically of what is often called visual or graphic and plastic art, leaving aside other categories, such as poetry, literature and song, which are often included under the broader heading. 2 See e.g. H. K. Schneider (1956 : 103-6). 8 i£.g., A. F. Elkin (1954 • 222-43) ; A. P. Elkm, R. and C. Berndt (1950) ; t. p. McCartny (1948/56), (i957 : 3-22). These works not only indicate specific art regions, but give a general picture of the wide sweep of Australian Aboriginal art and its intimate association with the life of the people.

Berndt (19586).</page><page sequence="2">THE STUDY OF AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINAL ART 27 our terms, and the problems of ' art ' in contrast to ' craftsmanship ', or of art as essentially non-utilitarian, are therefore irrelevant here. Among the Australian Aborigines as among other peoples, literate or non- literate, aesthetic expression takes a great variety of forms. In Japan, for instance, the common teapot, the netsuke, tsuba and into are just as important aesthetically as the kakemono. In Arnhem Land, North Australia, the paddle, the dillybag, the pipe and the spearthrower vie artistically with the bark and cave paintings, the totemic emblems, and so on. There is a comparability about them in that they represent media of aesthetic expression, such as we can call art. But in Aboriginal Australian languages there are no separate words for ' art ' or, for that matter, for ' artist ', and no separate category of persons specializing in this activity. In one sense it is &lt;juite misleading to speak of ' art ' in this connection, since the very use of such a term connotes preconceived views, not least in the matter of evaluation. This is a problem which enters into all translation, as such, and is not confined to the field of art. The point is that although most men in, for example, an Aboriginal Australian society can paint, carve, incise and so on, there are usually some who are regarded as being better than others, or as having prescriptive rights through age, status or ritual prestige to practise ' art ' or one aspect of it, that is, to paint rather than carve, to make ceremonial objects rather than everyday utensils, to paint or incise one •design or pattern, or even one subject or range of subjects in preference to others. Two points should be noted : in the first place, because ' art ' is not categorized as such and artists do not constitute a specific occupational ' class ', art is subsumed under other activities which can be identified in our terms as religion, economics, magic, sex and so on, and can be understood only in relation to one or more of these. In the second place, art can be understood in terms of its social implications, i.e. in terms of persons, ' artists ', sharing this particular role, while at the same time their other roles diverge, they occupy other statuses within their society. The social aspects of art have been adequately indicated from this point of view by, for instance, Firth4 and Leach.6 In other words, artistic activity is a cultural ingredient which colours and gives meaning to the social dimension, and in this respect it is not unlike other cultural features. However, I do not wish to pursue this point, but to discuss the problem of what a people's art can tell us about their society and culture, not only what it says about their social interaction and organization. There are two issues of which one hears a great deal in relation to the artistic productions of both literate and non-literate peoples. On the one hand there are references to ' creative ' art, on the other to art as a spontaneous expression, with the assumption that people draw, paint or 4 R. Firth (1951 : e.g. 172-3). He speaks (p. 173) of " the essentially social character " of non-literate art, in that there is almost an entire absence of landscape, and where this is used it is subsidiary : emphasis, he says, is on persons. In Aboriginal Australia, I suggest, the social •environment is that of man-in-nature ; man in relation to man, and also man in relation to his natural environment and to all the species within it ; when man depicts the world about him, through a culturally defined medium, both these aspects are given a more or less equal weighting. 8 E. Leach, e.g. (1956 : 22), considers it in terms of statuses in hierarchically ordered non- literate societies.</page><page sequence="3">28 THE STUDY OF AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINAL ART carve ' for pleasure '. The term ' creative ' implies a certain ingenuity, a ' newness * in expression which involves turning aside in some degree from orthodox or stereo- typed paths, a departure from, if not a reaction against, traditionalism. In Aboriginal artistic expression the artist is always confined to a set of rules (irrespective of limita- tions as regards techniques and material) that are traditionally defined in terms of both design and subject matter. This does not necessarily imply fixity, since variation within a certain range is usually taken for granted, even though it may not be explicitly encouraged. There is always the ' stamp ' of one artist as against another : no two artists treat the same subject in exactly the same way ; differences, subtle or otherwise, are nearly always observable. Nevertheless, individual expressiveness in a ' creative ' sense is restricted, and can flourish only to a limited degree. This in itself tells us something about that particular situation, as contrasted with others. What it tells us is relevant not only to the individual artist but to members of the social unit or units to which he belongs.6 In this sense, then, finding the ' meaning " of a given item of art is not just a matter of identifying its subject-matter. Like language, art, as I am using the term, cannot exist without communication, and like language too, it is limited by and to some extent reflects its social and cultural context. In its very structure, in the way sentences are formed, in the choice of words and in their positioning, the parallel between language and art is striking. Language, like art, may be held to embody a people's ' genius ', its ' spirit ' or ' ethos '.. This is so in Aboriginal Australia, whether we are concerned with relatively naturalistic or with highly conventionalized art. The conveying of symbolic meanings through this medium, as through language, represents a way of communicating ; it is semantically significant. But the way in which it is phrased, the way in which these symbolic meanings are conveyed, brings in a further dimension to which I will return presently. Mountford (1956 : 6) holds that one of the reasons why Arnhem Landers paint is for the sheer pleasure of it.7 The position, however, is not as clear-cut as this. On the one hand, if this suggests that it is a spontaneous, or primarily personal affair,, with no social pressures involved, then it is hardly applicable to the Australian Aboriginal. In the traditional context, that is, apart from such relatively recent developments as the ' Hermannsburg School ', he operates within the confines of established conventions, using media agreed upon and recognizable by other members of his community. I am using ' recognizable ' in a broad sense, in reference to designs which may or may not at once convey such meaning. On the other hand, if the suggestion is that he obtains ' pleasure ' in carrying out a particular piece of work to the satisfaction of himself and/or others, so that it conforms to local taste and is 6 The personal element in art, so obtrusive in our own society, is played down to a minimum- in an Aboriginal Australian society ; even in the representation of a private dream or incident (see R. Berndt, 195 1 : 71-84 ; Elkin, Berndt and Berndt, 1950 : plate 10 A and 11 A) the social aspect is paramount. But see C. H. Berndt (1958) in reference to New Guinea (Eastern Highlands)' ceremonial emblems. 7 This is the view of art as ' play ', insofar as it is self-justifying. See e.g. R. Redfield, in H. L. Shapiro (1956 : 366). However, cf. his remarks on page 377.</page><page sequence="4">THE STUDY OF AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINAL ART 29 acceptable, then possibly this feeling is common enough. The key word is 4 acceptable ', implying as it does the relevance of at least one person other than the artist, and also some standard or criterion against which it may be measured. In other words, it points to the social context. All Australian Aboriginal art is, basically, utilitarian. It is specifically designed to have some use, or some direct or indirect purpose or effect. This does not necessarily affect its aesthetic quality or the ' pleasure ' it may give both artist and others. In Aboriginal Australia, and Arnhem Land is no exception, the range of items, as mentioned above, through which artistic effort may be manifested is fairly wide ; for example, there are bark paintings and emblems used in a religious context ; sacred designs painted on flat-bladed spears, so that game killed by means of them is tabu to all but those who own the designs ; and figures painted on sheets of bark or on cave walls for various magical purposes, or as a ' statement ' verifying a particular story. Much of Aboriginal painting, carving and such like, has a mythological significance, although some is concerned primarily with everyday activities, hunting and food-collecting, camp life, mundane situations, sexual activity, et cetera, which have no direct connection with myth and ritual. But any one Aboriginal community having at its disposal this relatively wide range of topics for visual representation, can be said to use as a vehicle for its expression a more or less specific ' style ',8 which, except in subject matter, does not show essential differences within that range. I shall return presently to this point also. Aboriginal art, whether in a religious, magical or secular context, is frequently representational, but much too, particularly in the religious category, could be called abstract,9 or highly conventionalized. Abstract, in the sense in which the word is used here, means removal from the representational or naturalistic perspective, however this may be conceived in a particular tradition, to a stylized or conventional- ized design which may involve symbolism.10 Of course, the purely representational may be symbolic, but the ' abstract ' is a further generalization. This is particularly the case with the clan and linguistic group designs, and the sacred emblems of North- Eastern Arnhem Land ; or with the bark paintings relating to sorcery from Western Arnhem Land (vide Elkin, Berndt and Berndt, 1950 : plates 15 and 16). As Firth (1951 : 177) has pointed out, not all art of non-literate peoples is symbolic, and this is true too for Arnhem Land : there is much that can be viewed as simply descriptive, and much that is simply design or motif without any direct or 8 A. P. Elkin (1954 : 243) infers this when he speaks of ' schools ' of art : McCarthy (1957 : e.g., 16-17) also discusses briefly various Aboriginal art styles. 9 Leach (1956 : 32-33) makes tne point tnat tne art 01 non-iiterate people is aenmteiy representational rather than abstract. It is intended to be understood ..." Also see Leach {1954 : 105). This is not the case in (e.g.) Arnhem Land, where both representational and ' abstract ' are intended to be understood and are indeed understood. There is no reason why one should be more difficult to comprehend than the other when both concern local ' style ' ; both are part of the traditional pattern, even though the one corresponds much more closely than the other to its counterparts in the ' real ' world. See also e.g. M. Herskovits (1948 : 382). 10 Firth (1 95 1 : 175) has written that art necessarily implies selection ana aDstraction irom reality " : and these refer to " the social proportions of a subject ".</page><page sequence="5">30 THE STUDY OF AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINAL ART admitted meaning. But throughout Arnhem Land there is much too, especially in a religious or magical context, which is symbolic ; and it is this symbolism expressed through art that has social implications for, as stated earlier, all art is a way of communicating between members of a particular community. The meaning of most representational and some abstract art may be understood at different levels by the members of that community, depending on whether or not additional explanations concerning content are necessary. A painting may be understood immediately in terms of its subject matter ; for instance, human beings, animals, trees, or ' abstract * symbols for clouds, rain, camps, and so on may be immediately identified ; but it will possibly be necessary to explain the context or situation in which these representa- tions and symbols appear in combination ; in other words, the story or stories relating to them. On the other hand, this latter element may be revealed to only a select company : to members of a linguistic unit, for instance, and not to ' outsiders '. Or particular designs may be shown only to men and not to women, or only to men of certain categories ; or the symbolic meanings of various designs may be revealed,, or change their context, in accordance with a man's progression through age-grading rituals, or with his ritual and ceremonial position in adult life. Not only the designs themselves, but also the symbolic interpretations, may vary. Moreover, sex differentiation, social and ritual status and prestige are involved here. Thus art-as- communication can tell us something about social positioning. In any art work of the kind I am discussing, there must be some element of shared recognition in the symbolism, even if that recognition varies according to social categories of persons. For this there must be acknowledgement that certain designs or patterns, or figures (representational or ' abstract ') are distinguishable in terms of meaning, and this hinges to some extent on aesthetic judgment. In other words it is dependent on form and style. In some circles it has been suggested that non-literate peoples are especially adept at handling and understanding symbolic statements through art, ritual, or speech, and that this marks them off from the literate world as people who think ' mythically ' and ' poetically \u This is in itself an example perhaps of ' poetic \ but certainly of imprecise or inexact thinking. Our own language and our art contain an abundance of symbolic allusions, which is part of our traditional heritage as Western Europeans, and this is much the same in Arnhem Land or elsewhere. Some people have more, some less, and the development of scientific precision or growing emphasis on technology does not necessarily diminish it ; nor is this a question merely of non-literate as contrasted with literate. 11 A recent example of this view, in the anthropological field, is afforded by E. Leach (1956 r 29-30) : " The illiteracy (by which he presumably means non-literacy), of primitive (sic) peoples is also significant in another way* Whereas we are trained to think scientifically, many primitive peoples are trained to think poetically. Because we are literate, we tend to credit words with exact meanings - dictionary meanings. Our whole education is designed to make language a precise scientific instrument . . . But in primitive society the reverse may be the case ..." This over-simplification could be attacked on many counts, and certainly represents an ideal or normative statement rather than a statement of ' actuality \ Literacy as such does not infer preciseness of meaning.</page><page sequence="6">THE STUDY OF AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINAL ART 31 Representational or ' abstract ' art designed to convey meaning either to an entire community, or to certain categories of persons within it, can be understood only by those belonging to that society, and sharing its particular tradition. To be able to interpret the design and its symbolic significance there must be shared recognition, otherwise such designs and symbols become meaningless, or may be accorded quite different meanings. There is a further parallel here with language : we can hear the sounds, but unless we know the language we cannot hope to understand those sounds, to derive meaning from them. Likewise we cannot infer the meaning of any one design, particularly of a stylized kind, simply by observing or analyzing a specific situation or action-sequence in the society which has produced that design, any more than we can understand the language used by members of one society by observing the art productions of that society. The method used by Leach (1954) to elicit the meaning of a Trobriand Island shield design,12 is one which draws only in part on the relevant material. The procedure, for instance, would be quite un- rewarding if, using descriptive material from Western Arnhem Land culture we were to explore the meaning of the bark painting illustrated in Elkin, Berndt and Berndt (1950 : 77, plate 15) ; apart from identifying it as anthropomorphic, little else could legitimately be said about it. In such an interpretation much depends, as it did in the case of the Trobriand shield, on the functional significance of the object on which the painting or design appears : it is this which provides the ' key \ so to speak. Since the procedure here is arbitrary, and since there are too many ' uncontrolled ' factors, this cannot be regarded as a legitimate method of Social Anthropology. Even so there is no reason entirely to discard it, provided we recognize it for what it is. We are at this juncture faced with a two-fold problem. On the one hand there is the question of aesthetic appreciation ; on the other, there are the form and nature of the design, which may or may not be taken to be meaningful. In the first case, some system of standards or values must be operating, against which ' good ' and ' bad ', satisfying or dissatisfying, can be measured.13 In other words there must be social relevance, or recognition. In the second case, the question hinges on ' style ' (e.g., Leach, 1956 : 36, 37 ; Herskovits, 1948 : 398-413) : the style or form itself may, for instance, be regarded as expressive of ethical ideals. Thus the protruberant ' phallic ' nose of the Sepik area (New Guinea) may be regarded as a tangible manifestation of a dominant aesthetic value : that long-nosed persons are physically attractive, and that this particular trait is linked with a number of other desirable characteristics ; the style of the mask, ancestral figure or prepared head expresses or symbolizes that value.14 Or, in the case of Panari or Northern Indian art, with its vogue for pictures relating to the great Hindu epics, particularly the Gita Govinda of Jayadeva and the general literature of 12 It seems to me that this is what Leach has done in imputing a specific meaning to a stylized design on a Trobriand shield (1954 : 103-5) • See R. Berndt {1958a). 18 See C. Kluckhohn in Parsons and bhils eds. (1952 : 300 et seq., 394, 411). 14 G. Bateson (1936 : 163-4). But see also D. Fraser (1955 : 17-20).</page><page sequence="7">32 THE STUDY OF AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINAL ART love : Archer (1952 : 5) suggests, in rather broad terms, that this " can only be explained in terms of Rajput society, its repressed wishes, its emotional needs, its poetic values, its dominant attitudes ; and it is hardly surprising that the paintings which reflected these pre-occupations should develop a distinctive style ". A. Coomaraswamy (1956 : e.g., 34 ; and also Màrg, 1957) gives an example of the relationship of art of the Gupta period to certain aspects of social and cultural life, although his discussion relates primarily to content. Style, to Schapiro (1953 : 287), is " a system of forms with a quality and a meaningful expression through which the personality of the artist and the broad outlook of a group are visible. It is also a vehicle of expression within the group, communicating and fixing certain values . . . through the emotional suggestiveness of forms ". In Baroque art, " a taste for movement determines the loosening of boundaries, the instability of masses ..." (Schapiro, 1953 : 292). Leach (1956 : 37) touches on this point in drawing attention to the flamboyant totem pole art of British Columbia, the elaboration of Maori spiral and circular ornamentation, and the artistic taste of mid-igth Century England, and states that such resemblances are not altogether accidental, that they are expressive or reflective of common moral values, since each society was " characterized by notions of a class hierarchy coupled with much social competition ".15 On this point there is a difference of opinion among anthropologists. At one extreme there is the position adopted by Nadel (1951 : e.g., 89), who holds that art style is an " autonomous " cultural activity or " dimension of action " which, unlike the " contents or operational aspect " of art, bears no relation whatever to social or even to other cultural features. The " only . . . kind of nexus " which can be estab- lished here, he says, is " of purely intrinsic nature ". His unwillingness to admit even the possibility of a relationship, and his very choice in this connection of the dogmatic word " autonomous ", contrast with his enthusiasm for tracking down linkages of a no more obvious kind in regard to other social and cultural phenomena (Cf. his " thread of meaning " discussion - ibid., e.g., 324-5). However, his view rests on a narrow interpretation of the problem, since in separating this ' autonomous ' zone " from the two-dimensional entity which is culture and society ", his " unambiguous " criterion is the " essential fact . . . that they do not require specific group relationships for their realization " (ibid., 89-90). This appears to be quite different to the approach suggested by Lévi-Strauss (1953 : 62), who envisages a 15 Levine (1957 : 949-^3) gives promise of adopting this line of approach (see especially pp. 949* 954)» stating as his thesis that if there is an association between art-style and culture (society), and this can be demonstrated in relation to Aboriginal Australia (on the basis of Arnhem Land material), in other words, if Aboriginal art-style ' says something ' about Aboriginal society and culture, then what does the style of prehistoric art tell us about the culture and society which produced it. Of course here there is the " Trobriand Medusa" dilemma (Leach, 1954 ; R. Berndt, 1958a), which Levine does not consider ; further, the rest of his paper commits the anthropological fallacy of interpreting the significance or meaning of prehistoric art on the basis of what we know about contemporary Australian Aboriginal culture and art. A much more cautious attempt is made by A. F. C. Wallace (n.d. : 3-22), in an article which examines certain points of style, using them as projective data which may provide clues to Maya personality.</page><page sequence="8">THE STUDY OF AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINAL ART 33 " grammar of style " which " must be understood by itself ", but in which " corres- pondence can be found . . . between the systematized forms . . . abstracted on the different levels ". The solution as he sees it lies in developing " mathematical methods " to provide more efficient explanatory models ; structural linguistics, he says, has already made some progress along these lines. Nevertheless Nadel touches on the same issue when, in speaking16 of " logical consistency *in]behaviour ", he says that even in respect of " formal traits " there may be " some organizing principle underlying the modes of expressing diverse contents ". Outside the general range of Anthropology there has been some concern with this problem ;17 but within it the main interest has been shown by ' cultural ', as contrasted with ' social ', anthropologists.18 Their exploring of possible relationships here does not necessarily stem from any preoccupation with functionalism in the Malinowski sense, but it does indicate their reluctance to accept as ' given \ not questioned, the " autonomy " of any aspect of culture. If some of their efforts are open to criticism, this does not mean that the question itself is not worth pursuing. After all, the study of social phenomena too, especially in its earlier efforts, is not beyond reproach : methodology and techniques in this sphere have been rather slow in developing. The impressionistic state of the field at present, then, is a matter for concern only if acknowledgement of this does not lead to consistent attempts to improve it. This is not a problem which can be solved by the simple method of asking people questions about it, since it lies outside the range of ordinary ' home-made models ', or constructs. It is one for a social, or cultural, scientist, well acquainted with the data, interested in searching for the kind of relationship which is not as a rule explicitly articulated or conceptualized, and of which the people themselves in any given society may not be at all aware. The problem. becomes more complicated in societies such as our own, with so many cross-currents and mixtures of styles in various fields ; but for preliminary consideration at least, as in other spheres of enquiry, an area like Aboriginal Australia may present a rather less confusing picture. 16 S. F. Nadel (1951 : 260) ; but cf. his cursory reference (pp. 260-1) to " instances of a purely formal consistency, as when . . . the same style pervades the whole field of art ". 17 1 do not want to go into details and references here : for a short summary of certain aspects of it, see M. C. Albrecht (1954 '- 425~36 I e-g» 426, 427-8» 43°-*. 435)- 18 See e.g, E. Carpenter (1955 : e.g., 140-45) ; C. Kluckhohn and D. Leighton (1946/48 : e.g., 226) ; D. Fraser (1955 : 17-20). Some of Fraser's remarks might also have been designed to provoke the response of ' subjective f or ' highly emotional \ and to confirm the suspicions of social anthropologists who distrust this type of study. E.g., in referring to the Mundugumor head illustrated in Plate B(c), he says : "... one is not surprised that cannibalism, extensive head-hunting and an atmosphere of intra-tribal hostility lie behind this cruel face ". See also Fraser's comments on the style of coastal (Bisman) art, as compared with that of the Lorentz river area, in his review of van Renselaar's volume (1957 : J43)' I am not referring to such approaches as the Goodenough ' draw-a-man test ', or the Macho ver figure test, since these rest primarily on content rather than on style (e.g., on an evaluation of what is or is not included in drawings of the human figure, against an arbitrarily defined normative standard). Nor am I taking into account, in this discussion, the fact that the boundaries of ' a society ' and ' a culture ' rarely coincide : for my purpose here, I am concerned primarily with the social dimension, and secondarily with the cultural content. c</page><page sequence="9">34 THE STUDY OF AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINAL ART Art, whether naturalistic or stylized, is always an abstraction from reality - from the empirical situation : it is a statement about something, expressed in a specific way, and the ways of saying it vary as do languages and other aspects of culture generally. But within a particular society, although variation takes place through time as well as through the growth of ' schools ', an art style may provide us, in abstract, with a ' key ' to the value orientation.19 It is linked with the concept of ' ethos ', expressive of the outlook of the society for which the style is valid.20 It is too early to know just how rewarding such an approach might be, since relatively little consideration has been given to this topic by social and cultural anthropologists ; and the method of investigation needs careful working out, if it is to represent more than just guesswork. Nevertheless, there is enough material to hand to suggest that the relations between aesthetic expression (or style) on the one hand and social phenomena and belief systems (or values) on the other are certainly worthy of study.21 In Mountford's volume (1956), as in Elkin, Berndt and Berndt (1950), the art of two adjacent regions is contrasted : Western Arnhem Land (centred on Oenpelli), and North-Eastern Arnhem Land (centred on Yirrkalla). The areas are close enough to have been subject to cross-fertilization over the years.22 19 I.e. in the sense defined by Kluckhohn (1952 : 411). 20 L. Mair's brusque dismissal (1957 : 233) of this whole question, with the claim that " in the formulation of problems it has nothing in common with the study of society ", evidently stems from her reluctance to admit the relevance of " culture " in social Anthropology. Note, by the way, her reference to the study of society as " essentially that of socially regulated interpersonal relationships " (mv italics). 21 Two psychological studies of aesthetic appreciation among south-western Arnhem Land Aborigines have made their appearance in recent years : W. A. McElroy (1952 : 81-94), (J957 : 269-72). These are, however, not relevant to the present study since they add nothing to the basic problems I am exploring. The first comes to the conclusion that " good taste " (or aesthetic appreciation) is almost entirely determined by the cultural conditioning of perception ; this has long been recognized by both anthropologists and art historians. The second paper concerns the question of " compulsive " orderliness (the practice of covering areas with round or oval dots, which is a feature of some Western Arnhem Land art). McElroy points out that this cannot be correlated with " anxiety connected with excreta ", and that compulsive orderliness in behaviour is here found without psychoanalytic complexes of the anal type. 22 In any such contrast, a matter of crucial importance is what happens where the two regions adjoin. In other words, can we distinguish the differences in question within the border area, or is there a blur or merging ? The ' intermediate ' zone in this case can be taken as the area stretching south from Cape Stewart, part of it occupied traditionally by the Barara or Burara, with whom no systematic work has been done. What information we have seems to suggest that, culturally at least, it is composite : people from the west include the Barara within their social perspective, as having the same general social orientation, while those from the east include them in theirs. Further, there is no adequate series of bark paintings available from the Cape Stewart area. South, towards the upper reaches of the Goyder River, with the Rembrarja (Rainbarrja) on the west and the ' Malarg ' people on the east, quite typical Western Arnhem Land bark painting has been illustrated by Wilkins (1928 : facing 156). In that area there is not sufficient information to indicate an intermediate zone. Immediately west of Cape Stewart lies the Liverpool region, and as far as we can tell from material available this is of ' real ' Western Arnhem Land-type (see R. and C. Berndt, 195 1). Immediately to the south-east of Cape Stewart lies Milingimbi Mission Station which, while predominantly part of the eastern bloc, has been visited consistently by the Barara (Burara) (apparently since 1926-29, Warner : 1937). It is possible that Western Arnhem Land influence here has resulted in some modification of ' typical ' Eastern Arnhem Land art style. Although here again no full series of bark paintings is available, the examples I have seen suggest a rapprochement between the two relatively distinct styles. On the other hand, Warner's field work was carried out primarily at Milingimbi, and his data provide a basic ' pattern ' for what [Footnote continued on next page.]</page><page sequence="10">THE STUDY OF AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINAL ART 35 If we consider the bark painting, we can say the techniques and media in the ' east ' and ' west ' do not differ radically ; nor, with a few exceptions, does the type of subject matter. Yet in the matter of style the contrast is on the whole quite noticeable.23 Reference may be made, in the case of Western Arnhem Land, to Mountford (1956), for example plates 51, 54, 56, 61, 69, 71, 72, 76, 79, or Elkin, Berndt and Berndt (1950), plates 2, 15, 16, 17 : and for North-Eastern Arnhem Land, Mountford, plates 89, 93, 98, 99, 100, 107, 116, 117, 119, or Elkin, Berndt and Berndt, plates 10 A, 10 B, 11 A, 11 B, 12 A, 12 B, 14.24 The Western Arnhem Land artist ordinarily makes no attempt to cover the complete surface with design. He prefers open spaces, so that his subjects stand out boldly unhampered by superfluous detail ; and, generally speaking, he selects fewer features for illustration on any one bark than does his counterpart in the east. He concentrates on the main figure or figures rather than on their setting. When there is detail it is subordinated to the main design, which receives careful treatment, usually against a plain red-ochred background. The subject matter includes human beings and animals in action ; in fact, the device of leaving the maximum of space,, so that the eye focuses readily on individual figures, gives an impression of suddenly arrested motion. This tendency has possibly led to an emphasis on relatively natural- istic figures, with a minimum of stylization. This is true, too, for the anthropo- morphic sorcery paintings, and for the so-called x-ray designs indicating the internal organs of human beings, animals, fish, the foetus within a pregnant woman, and so on. There is a preference for curves and ' roundness ' (including the use of dots), rather thai? for angles and straight lines. In the case of North-Eastern Arnhem Land, the artist usually attempts to cover almost the complete surface of his sheet of bark with design, leaving little or no open space. I say ' almost ', because in many cases he is apparently not satisfied with the boundaries provided by the length and width of the bark. Instead he tends to shape his design within a self-imposed framework, often roughly square or rectangular^ just as he does in body paintings, e.g. on chest or abdomen, where no such clearly defined ' natural ' limits are present. The Western Arnhem Lander, on the other hand, does not ordinarily ' frame ' his design in this way, leaving the outer edges unrestricted except as regards the limits of bark itself. In the North-East, the central designs receive careful attention, and there is considerable detail ; but there is not as a rule the delicacy of treatment that is so apparent in the west, and the [Continuation of footnote 22.] has been broadly identified as Eastern Arnhem Land. The same tendency toward rapprochement or synthesis is currently in evidence at Elcho Island, which has had considerable influence from Milingimbi. The bark paintings which I collected there early this year (i958)&gt; apart from a general deterioration of traditional art (paralleling the growth of an ' adjustment ' movement in that island), show less preoccupation with detail, which is still (early in 1958) much in evidence at Yirrkalla. 28 A. P. Elkin (1954 : 234~36) speaks of contrasting design between Western and Eastern Arnhem Land. 24 R. and C. Berndt (1957) contrast North-Eastern with Western Arnhem Land art.

Even if this is not done, as much as possible is crammed into this background, even to the extent of design repetition.25 iEsthetically, blank spaces on such a drawing seem to be unpleasing to artist and observer ; but the material used to fill them is never meaningless. There is little in the way of movement or action in design. There is a tendency, much more noticeable than in the ' west ', to repeat both central and subordinate figures, as well as minor motifs, giving the effect of a pattern, as in, for example, European-type textile design. Where such figures or motifs stand out from their background, this is achieved not as a rule by separating them spatially from it but by the use of contrasting colours to outline or fill them, whereas in the ' west ' both devices are employed. Further, there is a ' playing down ' of naturalism, with a corresponding concentration on stylization, and symbolism expressed in varying degrees of complexity to suit a society which is hierarchically graded in respect of religious knowledge. Specialization in design is much more noticeable in this part of Arnhem Land, where the various clans and linguistic units have their own particular designs ; but although these may be fairly easily distinguished from one another in respect of minor differences, they are all relatively uniform in style. I have not indicated all the features of each style ; but if what I said earlier is valid, these contrasting styles should bear some relation to the social and cultural situation in the two regions. I shall mention, tentatively, one or two points which seem to be relevant here. The main differences between the two regions in the matter of social alignments can be briefly summarized as follows.26 In the West the language unit, conforming to what is conventionally called a ' tribe ', is not exogamous. Within and beyond it, reference to patrilineal affiliations is confined to the namanamaidj or (j)igurumut traditionally associated with specific localities. The named matrilineal moieties, subdivided into named phratries27 also with matrilineal descent, have incorporated a subsection system of relatively recent introduction. In the East, within the frame- work of two named patrilineal moieties the largest social unit is the mala, or clan, associated with several mada, linguistic or dialect units, each of which in turn comprises several linked patri-lines ; all these are exogamous. As in the West, the subsection system is an additional feature.28 All this, far more so than in the West, presents a criss-crossing of affiliations not unlike the cross-hatching so common as background in the bark designs. Apart from the major moiety division, one could almost see this as an arrangement of small overlapping compartments : structural interconnec- 25 Cf. R. Bunzel, in F. Boas, ed. (1938 : e.g. 560-1). 28 Of necessity I must speak very generally. As far as the barks are concerned, those collected by Mountford (1956) and discussed in his volume are not allocated to specific ' tribes ', nor, except in a few cases, are those for North-Eastern Arnhem Land allocated to specific clans and linguistic units. All bark paintings collected by Berndt are accompanied by the name of the artist and his tribal (Western Arnhem Land) or clan and linguistic unit (North-Eastern Arnhem Land) affiliations. In this particular paper, however, when I speak of Western Arnhem Land I am thinking primarily of the Gunwirjgu who represent the major part of the population in and around Oenpelli. 27 See Elkin, R. and C. Berndt (1951 : 253-301) ; R. and C. Berndt (1951). 28 W. L. Warner (1937 : e-g-&gt; I5"5I) '&gt; R- Berndt (1955 : 84-106), (1957 : 346-5x)-</page><page sequence="12">THE STUDY OF AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINAL ART 37 tions between mala and mada take the form of a number of conventional combinations, some of them depending for instance on ideal marriage types, which however take into account also marriage ' rules ' based on kin and, now, subsection affiliations. Also, because of differing mala affiliations, the land associated with any given mada may not be ' all of a piece ', but may be intersected by territory belonging to other units. The preponderance of detail in the ' East ', the avoidance of open spaces within the limits of a drawing, are paralleled by the numerous totemic associations of clans and linguistic units, with ' inside ' (esoteric) and ' outside ' (exoteric) terms for objects, beings or concepts : not just one or two, but several, each with associated symbolic meanings, used in different contexts, with relevant ' singing ' words as well. There is a liking for reiteration and symbolic reference, one within another, like a Chinese nest of boxes, the full impact of which is not attained in a general translation.29" The great substantiating myths with associated ritual are shared sectionally among the clans and linguistic units, each concerned with its own detail, but often duplicating that belonging to others ; on the one hand sure of its separateness and identity as contrasted with all others, but on the other acknowledging the ideal of the inter- dependence of all such units during the big ceremonies. In this region a man's progression through life from before birth until after death, until part of his spirit enters the appropriate Land of the Dead, and even after that, is, or was until just recently, marked by fairly well defined ' stages ' of religious significance. On the one hand, status and prestige hinged on these, as representing layers of revelation in the accumulation of sacred knowledge ; and on the other on strength gained through successful competition in trade, accentuated by alien contact, and on a reputation as a fighting man. Superficially, these two ways of attaining power and social recognition appear incompatible and indeed conflicting ; but a closer glance reveals that going through these stages and acquiring the knowledge associated with them, apart from the obligatory initial rituals, involved an outlay of goods and gifts. It was not possible to progress socially and religiously without paying fairly heavily for it. The Western Arnhem Landers have a great variety of totemically-based emblems,, but the ritual and ceremonial contexts in which they appear are not as numerous, and do not show the same detail and reiteration as those we find further east. It seems likely, moreover, that this wider range has become available only through the intermingling of tribal remnants, probably as a result of alien impact.30 29 See R. Berndt (1948 : 16-50), (1952) ; C. Berndt (1950 : 286-332). 80 The traditional ritual objects of the Gunwirjgu of Western Arnhem Land seem to have been relatively plain : a good example of this would be the ubar drum or gong (see R. and C. Berndt, 1 951). However, the maraiin rituals have associated with them a much larger series of sacred objects than that found in Eastern Arnhem Land : and many of them have intricate patterning which at times exceeds that found elsewhere in Arnhem Land. (See for example B. Spencer, 1914, plates facing pp. 218.. 220, 222, 224 ; contrast with those in Warner, 1937, Plate III B). And although the maraiin cult possibly had its origin in Eastern Arnhem Land, it has apparently been well established among the Gunwirjgu and other ' Western ' units for some considerable time, at least since Spencer's survey of 191 2. [Footnote continued on next page.</page><page sequence="13">38 THE STUDY OF AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINAL ART In Western Arnhem Land life is not, or rather was not, arranged in a series of ritual stages from birth to death and after, except for obligatory initiation. Religion is not the permeating force it so obviously is in the North-East ; it is still extremely important, but here the distinction between ' sacred ' and ' non-sacred ' for general purposes is more clearly drawn, whereas on the Eastern side when it can be made at all it is decidedly blurred. Status and prestige, although closely connected with religious aspects, depend primarily on ' secular ' considerations : on sexual prowess, on one's potentiality as a fighter, and on wealth.31 Fighting in the west, apart from merely interpersonal affairs, was relatively direct, often unsupported by religious sanction and ceremony. In the east it was linked with mythology, and to a certain extent ritualized, especially in relation to the settling of disputes.32 Although in the west there are ' sacred ' and ' secular ' renderings of certain words, there is not the cumulative sequence, with varying symbolic references, of the eastern area. Nor do we find there the elaborate structure of the eastern poetic song versions, arranged in cycles, and containing, in addition to many ' singing ' words, a fair amount of ordinary conversational material - to be seen perhaps as a filling in of the background, a building up of small details, against which the main symbolic allusions are set. Instead we find the succinct, more or less ' typical ', Aboriginal songs : plenty of repetition, but concepts sparsely enunciated in the shape of ' key ' words. The ' gossip ' songs are an exception ; they are frankly expressive, straight to the point, though not lacking in innuendo.33 They have, however, a counterpart in a series of ' contemporary ' songs on the eastern side, which have been composed within the last fifteen years or so. Then there is the matter of language.34 In the east the various dialects, differing from one another mainly in regard to vocabulary, are easily learnt up to a certain point ; beyond it, because so much is left to the understanding of the listener, a knowledge of context is essential. Verbs, or action words, for instance, are virtually uninflected ; there are no noun classes ; and although communication seems to proceed fairly well between people who share the same conversational ' background ', [Continuaation of footnote 30.] But to focus attention on art-style only as manifested through bark painting is to over-simplify the problem of comparison. It becomes much more difficult when one begins to take into account varying art-styles in one ' society ', as in the case of the maraiin objects of Western Arnhem Land, and their relative complexity of design and treatment. Although this is another issue which ■cannot be explored here, we might see on one hand, in the cultural dimension, increasing ceremonial complexity through the westward drift of the Gunwirjgu and Liverpool River people to the Oenpelli region ; and on the other hand, in the social dimension, the acceptance of the Eastern Arnhem Land patrilineal moiety divisions, retaining their original names, for ritual and ceremonial purposes. The spread of the subsection system into both regions, with the use of closely similar terms, represents a further aspect which they now hold in common. (See Elkin, Berndt and Berndt, 1 95 1 : 260-64). ai lhat is, speaking generally. Ine Cxunwirjgu is not such a straight forward , secularized and materialistic person, but it is the ' impression ' conveyed, the construct, which I am now considering. 32 See, e.g.. L. Warner (1037 : iss-qoì. 33 R. and C. Berndt (1951 : 211-40). 84 Compare the two papers : C. H. and R. M. Berndt (1951 : 24-52) and C. Berndt (1952 : 216-39; 275-89).</page><page sequence="14">THE STUDY OF AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINAL ART 39 of which speech is only one form of expression, yet where more than observable or concrete material is concerned it offers certain difficulties to strangers. On the western side, to take Gunwirjgu as an example, there are four noun classes ; and by affixing various particles to ordinary verb-stems, it is usually possible to indicate not only the number or person of the originator of a certain action, but also the number or person of those affected by that action, or the thing so affected.34a Certainly in the west, once one has learnt the ' rules ', translation oners fewer pitfalls, or fewer alterna- tive possibilities, than in the east. Although here too there is a certain amount of ' talking around the point ', this seems designed to achieve greater precision or at least to avoid misinterpretation. It is much easier to be vague, to avoid specificity, in the east than in the west. Gunwirjgu, too, like certain other western languages, has a special vocabulary for use between a man and his actual or classificatory mother- in-law, enabling them to communicate directly without intermediaries. A similar situation appears in respect of kinship terminology. In both east and west there is the ordinary series of kinship terms, of address and reference. But over and above these, in the west, is another, though not entirely distinct, set of reference terms, known as gundebi, which depend on the relationship between the person spoken to and the person spoken about. This again is an attempt to avert misunderstanding, to specify exactly without leaving too much to the imagination. In broad terms, as compared with the east, there is a more obvious directness in the west, a dislike for detail except where it has direct relevance, as for instance in the treatment of the central figure of a design or in an x-ray drawing. The effort at clarity in approach, the greater preciseness in language, the lack of elaborate symbolism and so on, suggest naturalism in art style, action in representation, and a straightforward approach to the subject, unhampered by a crowded setting in which it might be in danger of losing to some extent its individual identity. There is a certain degree of ' fit ' between the social and cultural context and style in each of these cases ; but it is obvious that much more needs to be said, including consideration of the criteria involved in evaluation. To take one last example : from the Aranda of Central Australia. The sacred flat stone tjuruya with incised design is possibly best known, and has its counterpart in wood, of varying lengths, over much of the desert and semi-desert inland of the continent. Designs vary considerably even within the Aranda constellation itself, but predominating are " concentric circles and portions thereof, such as the U-within-U figure, sets of parallel, straight, curved, and spiral lines, often encircling and twining in and about other elements, lines of chippings, rows and panels of dots and tracks of birds and animals ".35 And much the same motifs are duplicated or extended on their sacred ground paintings,36 their emblems and so on. In other words, the 84a There are also more expressions of doubt in the west, such as words which could be trans- lated as ' perhaps ' or ' maybe ' : and this might be associated with the pervasive Rainbow Snake mvtholosrv, with its recurrent theme of death. 85 See e.g. F. D. McCarthy (1948 : 30-1, fig. 16). 86 T. G. H. Strehlow (1947 : plate 4) ; McCarthy (1948 : fig. 20). (I am not distinguishing here between the various Aranda groups).</page><page sequence="15">40 THE STUDY OF AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINAL ART elementary designs are at first glance simple : deceptively so, since they are symbolic representations having indirect reference to a relatively complex ideology and belief system which gives little indication of the simplicity so characteristic of the art style.37 The style itself is simple, especially in contrast to Arnhem Land. Yet it has been remarked that the range of designs which may be assembled with so few elements, and to which different meanings are attached, is quite remarkable.38 We say that such designs are symbolic, and hence convey meaning to the community within which that symbolism is valid ; but this is not entirely so, since it is the context which is important as far as meaning is concerned. They are, rather, ' concrete ' non-naturalistic expressions of a set of relatively abstract ideas. A parallel may be drawn between this particular style and Central Australian society and culture. I shall mention only a few features, and these are not entirely absent from most Australian Aboriginal societies and cultures.39 Here we have a traditionally semi-nomadic people, interested primarily, prior to European contact, in the necessities of life, and orienting its existence around those needs ; possessed of few material goods, and desiring only the bare minimum since too many would impair freedom of movement and the daily task of foodcollecting ; living close to nature, not only feeling a strong bond with the land and all within it, but having a philosophy, a totemic view, which classified man along with other natural species, not as superior but on equal terms, whereas on the Arnhem Land coast the major mythological beings are predominantly in human form. Conservative as they were, and with all queries categorically answered, the ' typical ' Aboriginal conception of time that saw the past and future as part of the present was even more noticeable here. They showed a simplicity, a certain frankness in outlook, comparable to their tjurufja designs, but, like these, perhaps deceptively simple and naive. There is no need to labour this point. One need recall only the succession of age-grading rituals and those of revelatory intent, the ceremonial life, sacred and non-sacred mythology and song, and so on,40 certainly much less rich than in Arnhem Land, for instance, but nonetheless in striking contrast to the paucity of material objects and restricted or limited techniques. We could say, perhaps, that their art style, composed as it is of simple combinations of circles, semi-circles, spirals, concentric circles and lines, expresses the relative homogeneity of their society, the compactness of its structure, the intimacy of relationship among those within it, the essential conservatism and traditionalism which was a dominating feature in ' desert ' social living. But these remarks, like the designs I am speaking of, do in reality give a 87 T. G. H. Strehlow (1947). 88 F. D. McCarthy (1948 : 31). 89 E.g., although all Australian Aborigines are semi-nomadic, those m the so-called ' desert ' areas are much more mobile ; and this is particularly so when contrasted with those in Western and North-Eastern Arnhem Land ; further, because their natural environment is so much harsher than that of the northern coast, much less rich in food supply, they are more dependent on the fluctuation of the seasons. Their relationship to the environment is linked with a philosophy of totemism which is rather different to that existing in Arnhem Land. See T. G. H. Strehlow (1947)» (1956). 40 See, for instance, B. Spencer and F. J. Gillen (1938), T. G. H. Strehlow (1952-4).</page><page sequence="16">THE STUDY OF AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINAL ART 41 ' false ' impression. I mean here that we get a glimpse of only the social patterning, and not of the vividness of its cultural content : it is ' false ' only in this respect. Essentially art style is an abstraction41 in indigenous terms, with a linkage between it and the empirical dimension. What I have said for the Central Australian Aranda society is true too over most of north-western South Australia, across the Great Victoria Desert in Western Australia and over the greater part of the central-western sector of that State. Minor variation in art-style does occur throughout that region, but these are relatively insignificant until one reaches the northern end of the Canning Stock Route (in the vicinity of Balgo Hills, Billaluna and Sturt Creek). Here, although the basic Central Australian designs are present and in fact dominant, meandering motifs are much more noticeable, with a range of angular and semi-angular geometric designs.42 Actually, this design- complex covers a relatively wide area, once associated with a large number of tribes with differing social organizations and cultures, although linked with basic themes. When we speak of this particular art-style, then, numerous difficulties arise as soon as we try to link it with one particular society, culture, or ' world view '. Even concentrating on the Balgo Hills area, among people most of whom have come into this Mission from the Canning ' desert ' as well as from around Lakes Hazlett, White and Mackay, the correlation is not clear-cut. What I have said for the Central Australian people is also relevant here. But there are some obvious differences, mainly due to their contact with the northern peoples located in the Southern Kimberleys and in the pastoral station country of the Northern Territory. Linking the basic designs of spirals and concentric circles are the meandering lines and/or linked meandering geometric patterns, signifying the wanderings of ancestral beings, the tracks of snakes, or masses of clouds and so on. All this is simply illustrative material for a relatively narrow range of mythology and ritual activity. Although there are a number of highlights in this mythology, the greater part is concerned with the wanderings of beings across the country from one water to another, with much the same actions repeated over and again. And insofar as the environment outside the Mission and pastoral stations is concerned, a striking parallel could be drawn between the events mirrored in the mythology, excluding the magical elements, and the actual everyday life of the people : an extreme dependence on the natural resources of the country, with enforced mobility, associated with an ' inwardness ' in their way of looking at the world, and a lack of concern for issues which are not directly related to the quest for minimum physical satisfaction. A conservatism bred of necessity, much more rigid than that of eastern Arnhem Land, has direct implications in respect of their social and cultural adjustment to changing ways. In other words, internal change can have little encouragement, and enforced alien change can result only in increasing disorganization. Receptivity to new ideas under such a system is difficult, while emphasis on traditionalism is paramount. We could 41 M. R. Cohen and E. Nagel (1949 : 371 et seq.). 42 See F. D. McCarthy (1948 : 45-8 ; figs. .31, 33, 37, 39) for illustrations of this style ; also H. Petri (1954 : 92, 93, 122).</page><page sequence="17">42 THE STUDY OF AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINAL ART term this culture " repetitive ", where focus is on maintaining what is in terms of what has been. Much of what I have said here is relevant to other ' desert ' societies and cultures, but here the manifestation is more apparent. True, much of what I have said too has been impressionistic, but this is only because space does not permit me to substantiate this thesis with empirical material, for example as regards songs, linguistic material, and so on. The designs, which take the form mostly of incising on sacred boards of various kinds, express or directly symbolize this relationship ; and their repetitive nature, the complexity of meandering lines and figures themselves, mark the productions quite distinctively in terms of style. Art style offers one sort of key to the broad patterning of social relations and its cultural content. I am not suggesting that we could expect to find a one-to-one correlation. The extent to which we can identify this rests, partially at least, as it must do, on the empirical content. And it seems to me that only when we know that content are we able to infer the abstraction we term style. In one respect, we could view art style as a kind of ' short hand ' summary of the particular society and culture in which it flourishes. My references to Arnhem Land and to the ' desert ' area, compressed as they are, must appear impressionistic and subjective. They represent, admittedly, ad hoc interpretations ; it is not difficult to read what we know in one sphere into the mani- festations we find in another, and to conclude that ' these must be the same thing, merely expressed in different ways \ The crucial test comes in considering ' different ' styles which appear to have the ' same ' social and cultural setting, or vice versa, and in taking into account the necessity for prediction. Because of the dangers inherent in this sort of problem, with the tendency to ' jump ' enthusiastically from data to interpretation, there is a tendency to neglect it, even to the extent of separating form from content, as Nadel did, and categorically stating the one to be completely ' autonomous ' and independent of the other. This separation is an arbitrary one. ' Meaning ' depends, surely, on ' style plus content ' : or, rather, it is meaningless to speak of one without the other : the way in which a statement is presented is, when it comes to questions of ' meaning ', an essential part of what that statement ' says \ The problem of ' style ' in relation to its social and cultural context is not one to be tackled at the beginning of a field survey. Ideally, insofar as possible answers, as distinct from questions, are concerned, it demands the maximum of knowledge about a given empirical situation, and about the ways in which the problem has been approached by other workers in other situations. I suggest that we have enough material now on a few areas of Aboriginal Australia to provide a basis for a study of this kind, and I put forward this paper in the hope of stimulating more systematic attention to it.
