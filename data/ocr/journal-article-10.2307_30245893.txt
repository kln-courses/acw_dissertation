Although very little information prior to the 20th century has survived, it is evident that the Seri have been receptive to new techniques and ideas from outside sources, both Indian and non-Indian. Intense contact with outsiders in recent years, which is based in part on the development of a market for Seri baskets, has led to rapid change in Seri social and economic structure. Basket sales have appreciably contributed to the partial adoption of a cash economy and buyer demand in turn has stimulated changes in Seri basketry. This article describes Seri baskets and the techniques of their manufacture from both traditional and modern perspectives. The functional role of baskets in traditional Seri culture is discussed with an emphasis on the web of beliefs and ritual activities which surround their manufacture and use. INTRODUCTION Today 400 Seri reside along the coast of Sonora, Mexico from Bahia Kino to Puerto Libertad. Traditionally, subsistence has been based on hunting, gathering, and fishing. In recent years, a substantial market has developed for Seri crafts, primarily ironwood carvings, necklaces, and baskets. This market is now sufficiently large that the Seri are able to subsist largely on the sale of craft items. Baskets have long been important utensils in the Seri household. However, the commercial development of basketry has roots which extend into the 19th century when the Seri occasionally traded their baskets in Sonoran towns and ranches. Since the 1930's, baskets have been bought primarily by North American sport fishermen and tourists who have visited Seri country in ever-increasing numbers. Simultaneously, the domestic use of baskets has declined as metal containers have come into general use and baskets sales increased. Some of the traditional forms have disappeared and new shapes and designs have emerged in response to the commercial market. At present, baskets are made almost exclusively for sale. PREPARATION FOR MANUFACTURE Torote and Jatropha cuneata are the Spanish and botanical names respectively of the single plant used in the structural part of modern Seri *University of North Dakota, Grand IForks 58201 105</page><page sequence="2">106 Moser baskets (Johnson 1959: 10). The Seri name is ?dat. (For a description of Seri phonemes, see Moser and Moser 1965.) This plant provides both foundation material and stitching splints. Although McGee (1898:208) reports the possible use of paloblanco and Nolasco (1967:164) cites ocotillo, there is no evidence that either of these plants was used. Jatropha cuneata is a small-leafed shrub with multiple stems or branches that issue from a base at ground level (Figure 1). It is an important and respected plant in Seri cosmology. Large specimens of J. cuneata, some approaching 2 m in height, are not touched by unmarried girls in order to avoid having a breech presentation of their first baby. This belief is associated with a spirit named kW~n (Moser 1970:202) which pervades every phase of the manufacture of baskets. Women of all ages forage the desert for suitable plants. Usually several of them, often accompanied by children, make the excursion together. They wear their oldest clothing because of the staining quality of the J. cuneata sap. Straight branches about 1 m in length and 1.5 cm in diameter at the base are selected after the plant has been tested to see if the branches are sufficiently pliable for use as stitching splint material. The test is made by Figure 1. The torote plant (Jatropha cuneata).</page><page sequence="3">Seri Basketry 107 splitting the tip of a branch and bending the split ends away from each other and downward. If they do not break, the plant is usable and its straightest shoots or branches are cut off at the base. Thin branches are preferred to thick ones since their white inner bark and core are more pliant and have not yet begun to yellow. Large twigs on a branch are removed immediately. Some women remove all of the twigs and leaves before returning to camp. The branches selected from a number of plants are arranged into a transportable load that is tied with rope or strips of outer bark of the same plant. The load is balanced on a basket and carried back to camp on the woman's head with the aid of a headring (?atXiin). If a basket is not used, the burden will be placed directly on the headring. Collecting J. cuneata has traditionally been a woman's task. However, because the demand for Seri baskets has mushroomed during the last several decades, men occasionally collect this plant material with and for their wives. A man carries either two bundles of branches, one hanging from each end of a shoulder yoke, or a single large bundle slung over his shoulder on a rope. Back in camp the basketmaker begins her preparation of the branches by removing any remaining twigs and leaves. Then she holds them, a bunch at a time, in a fire of brushwood, turning them frequently until the bark is scorched. This loosens the bark and makes it peel more easily. After the branches have cooled, the woman splits each one lengthwise into halves. This is accomplished by placing the flat base of the stem in the mouth, biting the center of it parallel to the grain of the wood and then holding one half of the stem with the teeth while pulling the other half away from the mouth. After the first splitting, the roasted outer bark is peeled from each half stem and laid aside. The basketmaker then takes each half stem and, using her teeth to split the base, separates the half stem into two pieces, the split being parallel to the first split. She gathers the rounded outer strips and forms them into a roll called ?asdammiix 'thing looped' which she fastens with strips of the roasted J. cuneata bark and sets aside. She then takes the flat inner strips and, using her teeth and fingers, splits each one into splints. The two strands peeled from the edges of this inner strip are called iteelox 'edges' and serve as stitching splints. These she forms into a roll, also called ?asaammiix, which she usually fastens with strips of the J. cuneata bark. Although iteelox splints are soft and pliable, they lack uniformity of width and normally are not used for the finer baskets. The remaining inner portion of the inner strip is composed of the coarse, less flexible core of the stem. This is stripped into as many as seven or eight splints called Seee (Figure 2) which are used only to make up the foundation bundle of coiled baskets. The Seee splints are gathered into straight packets which are tied either with strips of J. cuneata bark or several strips of S~ee.</page><page sequence="4">108 Moser ipokx ittaak F iSk ip6t -- iteelox --ma- .... M / -- iteelox Seee Figure 2. Sketch of half-stem of Jatropha cuneata showing division into sewing and foundation splints. It is usually sometime later that the woman unfastens the roll of rounded outer strips, which she has set aside, for softening in water. Then, using the point of an awl to split the base of each strip, she separates the strip into two pieces in the same manner that she had previously split the half stem. Of the resulting two strips, the thin, curved outer layer is called ipokx fttaak 'back its-bone'. This strip consists of the outer layer of the soft, pliant, inner bark and is the source of the top grade stitching splints. The remaining strip, called iSk ip6t 'front its-moving', is the inner layer of inner bark. Its name refers to the separation that occurs when this section is peeled away from the inside section (from which the iteelox and Seee splints come) in the first splitting of the half stem. The iSk ipot is also made into stitching splints. However, since most of this section comes from inside the stem, next to the core, the splints into which it is split are somewhat stiffer than the ipokx ittaak splints and therefore considered to be of inferior quality. Using her teeth and fingers, the woman splits both the ipokx ittaak and the iSk ip6t strips into a number of splints. The ipokx ittaak usually yields two or three stitching splints which average from 40 to 45 cm in length. The iSk ipot strip may yield from three to five stitching splints. At present a basketmaker may gather and prepare enough materials for the fabrication of several baskets in anticipation of future sales. A woman will occasionally help another woman prepare her basketmaking materials. She is likely to be paid with a roll of iteelox stitching splints. Awls The tool used in the construction of Seri coiled baskets is the bone awl (Smith 1959:17). Its traditional name is pak 'awl', but it is now called SiX</page><page sequence="5">Seri Basketry 109 ik6p 'thing to-prick'. Malkin (1962:8) reports that awls are made from the carpal bone of the burro 'donkey'. Actually they are made from the proximal end of the metapodial of the mule deer, the animal which Sonorans call buro. The awl is usually roughed out by a man but is often finished by the basketmaker who sharpens the point and shaft on a piece of pumice. A new awl is about 23 cm long. It is resharpened from time to time as it becomes worn and is finally discarded after it has been reduced to a length of about 9 cm. In the past a woman might incise the shaft with her identification mark (Moser and White 1968:145) or with a decorative design (Figure 3). In recent times awls have sometimes been marked with the owner's name or initials. The tool is normally stored by inserting the point into the base of a packet of foundation splints. Sometimes it is stuck into the flat end of a native hair brush. A pottery olla recently recovered from a sand dune contained two awls nested together, the point of each being inserted into the hollow base shaft of the other (Figure 3d). Steel awls (ice picks) have been introduced and are occasionally used by a few basketmakers. Setting Almost all Seri activities, including basketmaking, take place outdoors. In hot weather the basketmaker sits in the shade of a ramada. Often two related women work within easy talking distance of each other. Small girls stay close .. .... . . ..., b ... Figure 3. Old bone awls: a-c, identification marks; d, nested together.</page><page sequence="6">110 Moser to their relatives, observing and often participating in the work. Girls as young as seven or eight years old are encouraged to begin making small baskets. In the typical working position (Figure 4), the basketmaker sits on a blanket or a large piece of cloth spread out on the sand. She folds and tucks her legs in close to one side. In that position her knees provide good support for the basket as she works. Sometimes, however, she sits with her legs extended straight in front of her. At her side, within easy reach, the woman keeps a bundle of dry foundation material (See) and one or more pans of water in which the stitching splints are soaking. Salt water is the preferred soaking medium for the stitching splints (Johnson 1959:10). It is believed that the dyes used to color splints will remain fast if salt water rather than fresh is used. However, a woman will sometimes use fresh water if she is making an undecorated work basket for herself or if she is living at an inland camp. Both salt water and fresh water, when used for basketmaking, are called ikatdaXXa. Such water must not be used for any other purpose (see below). COILED BASKETS Except for an occasional plaited piece, all known Seri baskets have been made by close coiling on a bundle foundation with uninterlocking simple iSi 14 17t* . a. .

Most baskets include split stitches and double stitching, although the most carefully made baskets will exhibit neither. Intricate or pattern stitching is unknown. Open stitching characterizes one type of basket; in all other coiled baskets the foundation cannot normally be seen between the stitches. The tapered rim coil is normally of the self-rim type (Morris and Burgh 1941:22; Figure 7f), attached to the previous bundle in the same manner as the body coils. The traditional start is formed by tying a small bundle of foundation material or stitching splints into a single overhand knot (Figure 5). This start is called kw?akdpnix 'made into a circle'. The interlocking start which is a knot called kW?afiS 'made into a knot' is more elaborate. It is the start most commonly used in recent years, especially in baskets made for sale, but an illustration by McGee (1898:208) indicates that it has been used for some time. It consists of folding, then interlocking, four pieces of stitching splint material into a square from which four double splints project at 90 degrees from each other (Figure 6). The projections are split into narrow strands which comprise the beginning of the foundation bundle. For a medium or large basket, the interlocking start is constructed of iSk ip6t splints. For a small basket, this start is made of iteelox. MITI .. .. ....... a.......... Figure 5. Single overhand knot start before, left, and after, right, stitching.</page><page sequence="8">112 Moser A woman sometimes makes several starts for future baskets at one sitting. A prolific basketmaker will sometimes fabricate the starts and first two or three coils for several baskets while her materials are still fresh. A start with two or three coils is called ?assaax ?a?itti 'basket begun' (Figure 7). The coiling and stitching process, using either of the basket starts, begins by dampening the projecting foundation material and folding them to the basketmaker's left. In the case of the interlocking start, the first of the four projections, after being bent forward, is stitched to the center square until it combines with the second projection which is also folded into the growing foundation bundle. The process is continued until all four groups of projecting strands are incorporated into a single foundation bundle. The coil builds up quickly and usually reaches the desired thickness within the first inch of a well-made basket. As the stitching proceeds, dampened foundation material is added to maintain uniform thickness of the coil. Usually a strand of foundation material is added by inserting the butt end into the bundle. Some women, however, fold the end of the strand before adding it. Baskets with the overhand knot start are begun by dampening the two groups of projecting foundation strands and stitching them to the knot. Because of the nature of the knot, the projections extend in opposite directions. This requires the basketmaker to bend those strands that project to the right fully 180 degrees to the left when the stitching has progressed to the point where they enter the coil. Additional material is added to the Figure 6. Interlocking start before, left, and after, right, stitching.</page><page sequence="9">Seri Basketry 113 foundation bundle in the same manner as for baskets begun with the interlocking start. The woman will normally use her awl to split and trim the stitching splints to exact widths. Sometimes she trims away the excess using only her teeth and fingers (Figure 8). If this process is undertaken with care, it results in a reasonably uniform width of splint. Uniform splints make it easier to place each stitch flush against the previous one and thus avoid gaps that would allow the foundation to be visible. This in turn enables the careful basketmaker, on the next circuit, to place the hole precisely between the stitches of the previous coil and avoid splitting the earlier stitch or double stitching, resulting in a basket of high technical quality according to Seri standards. A few basketmakers achieve such excellence by stitching only with the pliant ipokx ittaak splints, but most women are unwilling to invest the extra time and effort which this entails. Consequently, some split and double stitches are characteristic of the average Seri basket. Seri women work facing the convex or underside of the basket with the strands of the foundation bundle normally extending to the left. This permits a right-handed basketmaker to compress and twist the bundle with her left hand, giving the basket added strength, while manipulating the awl and stitching splint with her right hand (Figure 9). As a result the coils, as seen when viewing the basket interior or concave side, spiral from center to rim in a clockwise direction (Smith 1959:17). / / ... ::" il :. a ,..- .. .. % . .a .. - . - . .....

Left hand compressing bundle while right manipulates awl and stitching splint.</page><page sequence="11">Seri Basketry 115 The Seri remember only one left-handed basketmaker. They say that she also worked facing the underside of the basket, but with the foundation strands extending to her right. The coils of her baskets, therefore, spiralled in a counterclockwise direction. Coil width is generally uniform throughout a basket, one coil per cm being typical. A poorly-made basket, however, may exhibit considerable variation in coil width. In one large and exceptionally well-made basket, the central coils are very narrow (almost two per cm) but gradually increase in width away from the center, reaching a maximum midway between the center and the rim (about one coil per cm). Beyond the midpoint the coils gradually decrease in width to the rim coil, which is about the same width as the center coils. The handling of the awl is deft and efficient. It is held between the index and middle fingers with the base seated in the palm of the hand. This leaves the thumb and index finger free to insert and pull the stitching splint through the perforation in the foundation bundle without having to shift or lay aside the awl. After pulling each splint tight, the woman taps the last stitch twice with the shaft of the awl. The tapping is said to tighten the stitch. The fag end of a stitching splint is normally folded into the foundation bundle. When a splint is nearly used up, the moving end is either folded into the foundation bundle and enclosed in the coil as the stitching continues or is left exposed. Some basketmakers leave the first moving end exposed when each day's work is begun to mark their progress. When the basket is completed, however, exposed ends are removed by rubbing the basket, often with a native hairbrush. Those which remain are pulled off with the fingers or cut off close to the coil with a razor blade. The stitching operation moves along smoothly, interrupted only when stitching materials are depleted. The degree of slope of a basket's walls is determined by the angle at which the awl pierces the top of the previous coil. By slightly raising the base of the awl relative to the plane of the wall of the basket at each piercing, each succeeding coil is slightly offset from the preceeding one, thus generating a moderate curve of the basket wall. The number of stitches per cm varies according to the habit and pride of the maker. Some poorly-made baskets have as few as three stitches per cm. A rare few have as many as seven per cm. Most of the better basketmakers vary the number of stitches from four to five per cm. Some miniature baskets, seldom made, contain as many as eight stitches per cm. The rim coil is stitched in the same manner as the body coils and normal stitching splints are employed. This final coil is terminated by gradually tapering the foundation bundle. Usually this final taper is simply stitched to the top of the preceding coil. Occasionally, however, the stitches of the final</page><page sequence="12">116 Moser taper drop down low into the bulk of that preceding coil. This results in a short section where the rim stitches encircle the previous coil. Once the woman has finished the basket and removed the fag ends, she scrubs it clean and sets it in the sun to dry. It is then ready for sale. Decorated baskets are usually kept wrapped in a cloth for protection until they are finished and sold. Nolasco (1967:166-7) notes that a tightly sewn basket is watertight, especially after the coils expand upon contact with liquid. Basket Repair The longevity of a coiled work basket is said to be about two years. Broken stitches are easily replaced by stitching new splints around the exposed foundation bundle. The common point of failure is the center section where the basket rests on the headring while carrying heavy loads. A woman sometimes stitches a new section of coils into the bottom of a basket that has failed. McGee (1898:208) reports that when the bottom breaks out, ordinarily the basket is discarded. However, he refers to one specimen obtained on Tiburon Island in which the missing bottom had been replaced with a piece of sealskin attached by means of sinew. One basket in the Heye Foundation collection offers another example of patching. A thin piece of metal has been fitted into the open bottom of this specimen and fastened to the adjacent coils with short lengths of wire. Basket Shapes The traditional shapes of Seri coiled baskets have undergone recent change and elaboration as a result of buyer demand. At present, the Seri classify their coiled baskets into 15 named types, based on form and function. Eight of these are considered to be traditional and have either a ceremonial or a utilitarian function. The other seven types are farily recent innovations developed for the commercial market. Although certain of the named types apply to distinctive basket shapes or special uses, there is very little difference between some of the other types in terms of either form or function. Traditional Basket Types 1. The ?dssaaxda 'basket real' is an undecorated utilitarian basket in the form of a shallow bowl (Figure 10a). In the past, when it was the most common type produced, it was called ?dssaax 'basket'. Recently, however, the term ?dssaaxda has been applied to distinguish this type from the similarly shaped decorated basket produced for sale and which now bears the name ?dssaax (see below). The larger of the two baskets reported by McGee</page><page sequence="13">Seri Basketry 117 (1898:208-9), a shallow tray 38 cm in diameter and about 10 cm deep, is a typical ?dssaaxda. In the past these baskets were not decorated and most recent specimens lack decoration. Shortly after 1900, however, occasional work baskets included a decorative red-brown coil near the start. Until recent years a woman often marked her basket for identification by inserting a strand of yarn or cloth between the coils for two revolutions during the stitching process. Since the ?dssaaxda is designed for use rather than for sale, its construction is more sturdy than the ?dssaax. It is strengthened by tightly twisting the coil foundation splints during the stitching process. The walls are generally built up in a uniform curve, making this basket somewhat deeper in proportion to its diameter than the ?dssaax. The effect of this kind of engineering is much the same as that of an inverted arch and makes possible the support of a greater load. 2. An older type of tray basket, similar in form to but slightly smaller than the utilitarian ?dssaaxda, is the ?asx ittoox 'basket its-eyes' (Figure 10e). The name refers to the basket's distinguishing technique, open stitching. In this technique the stitches are widely spaced, thus revealing the foundation bundle between stitches. Apparently, at one time the spaces between stitches were thought of as eyes. Conservation of time and materials is the reason now given for making this style of utilitarian basket. The ?asx ittoox is traditionally decorated with two concentric red-brown coils which occur nearer the rim than the center. The number of stitches throughout the basket averages about two per cm. One elderly woman, Sara Villalobos, still makes an occasional basket of this type to sell to tourists. 3. A shallow basket called ikda??aal 'to accompany' was probably not over 30 cm in diameter and was not decorated. It was essentially a small version of the ?dssaaxda and was traditionally used as an auxiliary vessel in which cargo was carried. The name derives from the fact that this type of basket was carried on the hand at shoulder height, thereby "accompanying" the ?dssaaxda being carried on the head. The ikda??aal apparently has not been used since around 1940. 4. The ?dssaax kdakkoox 'basket large' is a large version of the utilitarian basket ?dssaaxda. No longer made, it is said to have been at least 60 cm in diameter. Like most work baskets, it lacked decoration. 5. The ?asax ispox 'basket decorated/large' is a giant-sized decorated version of the ?assaaxda. The ?asax ispox, which has not been made for many years, is said to be one of the oldest Seri basket types. One elderly woman recalls seeing one of these baskets that was more than 1 m in diameter. The belief concerning this basket and its ceremonial function is described later in the paper.</page><page sequence="14">118 Moser b i 4 d . : .: .,,e ... ..: ..... ;,iTi~~i a ia.,' Figure 10.

Several deep forms of baskets are made, the most common taking its shape from the pottery olla. Olla-shaped baskets were apparently never used by the Seri; however, they have been a favorite of basket buyers since shortly after 1900 and continue to enjoy great popularity. The ?aat ?an6o?kw 'torote deep-concave-thing' is an olla-shaped basket which ranges in height from approximately 10 cm to 45 cm (Figure 10b). The height usually exceeds the diameter. The mouth, which is usually set on a short neck, may vary greatly in width. Traditionally, a lid was provided for each such basket, but at present lids are only occasionally produced. The ?aat ?an6o?kw has traditionally been decorated. In the past these baskets were produced in considerable numbers for Sonoran ranchers and residents of Hermosillo. A modern modification of this basket is the ?aat ?an6o ?kw it 'torote deep-concave-thing its-base' (Figure 10d). It is a decorated bowl-shaped basket, the equivalent of the lower half of the ?aat ?anoo ?kw. One of these is illustrated by Kroeber (1931:59). This basket form is sometimes made intentionally. However, it has usually resulted when the basketmaker closes off a half-finished olla-shaped basket either because she is tired of working on it or because an eager visitor asks to buy it at that time. 7. The ?aat ?and6o?kw kdakkoox 'torote deep-concave-thing large' is merely an oversized ?aat ?anoo?kw basket (Figure 10c). It may be as much as 61 cm in height and 51 cm in diameter. A basketmaker often requires several hours a day over a period of two months or more to manufacture one of these large baskets. Formerly this type had ceremonial significance. 8. The sdppiim or sdptim is a giant-sized olla-shaped decorated basket. According to oral tradition this type was seldom made. It is remembered that once, upon the completion of one of these baskets, the Seri celebrated the event with a grand fiesta. The beliefs and ceremony relating to this basket are described later. During the latter part of 1970 and the early part of 1971 Elvira Valenzuela made what the other Seri conceded to be a sdppiim. It is decorated and is 90 cm high and 105 cm wide. No attempt was made to observe and fulfill the ceremonial requirements which formerly surrounded the manufacture of the sdppiim. Upon completion this basket was not celebrated with a fiesta and was almost immediately sold. Elvira is presently making her second such basket. Recently Developed Basket Types Seven types of coiled baskets and plaques are currently being made or have been made specifically for the tourist trade. These represent departures from traditional basket shapes although there is little difference in the technique of their manufacture.</page><page sequence="17">Seri Basketry 121 1. The ?dssaax 'basket' is the commercial version of the traditional work basket, the ?dssaaxda. It is generally more shallow, having gently sloping walls, and is seldom as closely stitched. Occasionally it is made in the form of a circular plaque. This basket, like the other types made for sale, is characteristically decorated with a design in red-brown, black, or both. Upon request, it has been made in a solid color, usually red-brown or black, but occasionally yellow. 2. The ?dssaax kitXiin 'basket have-head-ring' is an elaboration of the ?dssaax and is distinguished by a shallow base built of coils, purportedly added to the basket to enable the buyer to balance it directly on his head without the aid of a headring (Figure 11f). Occasionally the rim coil of the basket is attached in a wavy, semi-looped fashion. The ?dssaax kitXiin is not popular among the tourists and seldom made. 3. The ?aat ?dipx 'torote oblong-thing' is a basket with an elliptical shape (Figure Ild). It is started with an 8 to 10 cm straight section of foundation splints which sometimes includes a length of wire for stiffening. The greater part of the section is then closely wrapped with a sewing splint. The foundation material protruding from one end of this start is then doubled back and stitched to the wrapped section as a continuing coil. As these base coils are continued around the straight center, the elliptical shape is generated. The sloping walls, which may be as high as 12 cm, are constructed in the standard manner. These baskets are usually decorated. The rim coil is occasionally attached in the semi-looped fashion (Figure 1 lb). The ?aat ?dipx is now rarely made. 4. A variation of the ?aat ?dipx basket is the ?aat ?dipx kislitXkox 'torote oblong-thing with-corners' (Figure 1 la). It has a flat, rectangular base and vertical walls about 5 cm high. A flat lid, constructed in the same manner as the base, is sometimes made and attached to one wall of the basket with wire hinges. The method of construction is basically the same as that used to make circular coiled baskets. However, long rows of straight foundation bundles of Seee are stitched consecutively one to another to form the rectangular shape. Each foundation row of the rectangular section is open-ended with 2 to 3 cm of foundation material protruding from each end. Some of this protruding foundation is broken off and the remaining material folded under and stitched to the end of the foundation row, thereby closing off that end of the section. The vertical walls of the basket are formed by stitching coils up from the rectangular base. The basket bears a geometric design which is stitched into the lid as well as the base and walls. 5. The ?aat ?an6o?kw ki?iSx 'torote deep-concave-thing be-with-handle' (Figure I le) is rarely made. It is equivalent to an ?aat ?an(o ?kw it basket but includes a handle. The handle, consisting of one or more extra coils, is arched over the mouth of the basket and its ends are fastened to opposite sides of</page><page sequence="18">122 Moser the rim coil. The Seri recognize this to be a copy of the common woven Mexican hand basket which they have named ?ateppeen 'torote carrying yoke'. 6. The Kiitro, named after the one liter metal can, has a round, flat base. The vertical or slightly flaring walls extend from approximately 8 to 45 cm above the base and are usually decorated (Figure 1 g). 7. A recent innovation is a coiled circular plaque which is intended to serve as a hot pad for pans and dishes in the modern kitchen (Figure 11 c). It is called ?atjkan6iij ki? it iiix 'pan the on to-be.' These plaques range in size from 13 to 26 cm in diameter and may be plain or decorated. The finishing taper of the rim coil is sometimes made into a semi-loop for hanging on a peg. These pads, which have never been used by the Seri, are seldom manufactured. Decoration At the time of his visit in 1894-5, McGee (1898:209) found Seri baskets to be "absolutely without decorative devices in weave, paint, or form." Johnson (1959:12) questions McGee's assertion, pointing out that he probably missed seeing decorated baskets due to the fact that he was with the Seri such a short time. Johnson is not ready to believe that basket decoration by the Seri developed only since the turn of the century. Maria Luisa Chilion, who was born around 1887, does not recall having gSeen any decorated baskets'as a young girl. She states that most of the baskets made at that time were of the simple open stitched coil variety, the ?asx ittoox. She believes that she first saw a decorated basket about the time of her puberty fiesta (probably around 1900). The design was the kW?apdixam pattern (see below). Next, she says, solid red-brown coils were introduced and used in the development of new patterns. The earliest photographs of decorated baskets so far known were taken in 1904 (Garcia y Alva 1905:21, 23). On the other hand, oral tradition indicates that the ceremonial baskets, the ?asax ispox, the sdppiim, and the ?aat ?anoo?kw kdakkoox were always decorated. It seems reasonable to suppose, therefore, that even before the middle of the 19th century the Seri were decorating certain of their baskets, specifically those having a ceremonial function and those made for trading at Sonoran villages and ranches. It may be that with the advent and eventual intensification of hostilities between the Seri and their Mexican adversaries, the Seri for an extended period of time abandoned their practice of decorating baskets. The modern florescence of Seri basket decoration, then, may have begun with the gradual decline of hostilities around the turn of the century. The Seri resumed their practice of trading baskets and other products to their</page><page sequence="19">Seri Basketry 123 Mexican neighbors for supplies. In succeeding years, as the peaceful invasion of the Seri coastal lands by both nationals and foreigners gained momentum, the popularity of Seri baskets increased proportionately. To meet the mounting interest in their baskets, the women have developed not only a number of new basket shapes, but new dyes and decorations as well. Dyes The following data on dyes are adapted from Felger and Moser Seri Ethnobotany (in preparation). The most common color and, according to Seri oral history, the only color used in the past is a red-brown which Johnson (1959:12) aptly describes as "a rich burnt sienna color." The dye is prepared from the root of a small desert shrub called ?deppool (Krameria grayi). This plant, common along the coast, has roots that radiate from a point 6 inches or more below the surface of the soil. With considerable effort the roots are dug up with a knife, stick, sea shell, or metal spoon. As many as several pounds of roots may be gathered and carried back to camp. The greater bulk of the root consists of a thick water-storing bark from which the dye is made. First, the dirt is scraped off the root with a knife or a spoon. As reported by Johnson (1959:12) the bark is removed by pounding the root on a metate with a mano. The bark is crushed on the metate and then placed in boiling water. Rolls of stitching splints are added and allowed to steep in the brew until they have reached the desired color saturation. They are then removed. Prolonged boiling is essential so that the red-brown hue will not later fade. Two other red-brown dyes, less commonly used, are prepared in a similar manner. One is derived from the root of ?aXS istim 'dog its-hipbone' (Hoffmanseggia intricata) and the other from the root of ?e??ee koy6kko 'plant dove' (Sphaeralcea sp.). The Seri assertion that red-brown is the only color traditionally used for basket designs is supported by the Seri basket collection of the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. The baskets in this collection, the bulk of which were obtained in 1923, bear designs only in red-brown (Frederick J. Dockstader, personal communication). Red-brown continues to be the predominant color in most contemporary baskets. Because of an increasing demand for their baskets, the Seri have elaborated on the traditional designs and colors. Buyers have often been confronted with a variety of baskets from which to choose and the Seri have been quick to recognize that consumer choice is based primarily on quality and elaboration of design. Apparently the second color to be adopted was black. According to one Seri, sometime around 1930 a Mexican buyer ordered a basket decorated</page><page sequence="20">124 Moser with a black cross, to be placed on a grave in Hermosillo. Since that time, particularly during the last 15 years, black has become an increasingly popular color. It is most frequently used in combinations with red-brown. Although black dye is a recent innovation, the Seri have discovered three sources of it. The favorite black dye, called ?dep, is derived from the mesquite tree (Prosopis glandulosa var. torreyana) (Felger and Moser 1971) and is made by either of two processes. One is to boil strips of mesquite bark in water. Rolls of stitching splints previously dyed red-brown become black after cooking in this dye for a few hours. The other process is to collect the black pitch which exudes from the mesquite tree. The pitch may be formed into patties and conveniently stored. When one of these is boiled in water, a black dye results in which the rolls of stitching splints are immersed. A second but seldom-used black dye is prepared by boiling the roots of pndakkoox XndaSSoolkam (Rhizophora mangle). Only previously undyed stitching splints are dyed in this solution. The manufacture of the third black dye, called ?dat an i?a?6oppool 'torote in to-blacken', involves the use of five ingredients and therefore is rarely used. Stems and leaves of the plant ?atax ippool (Suaeda torreyana) are pounded on a metate, mixed with water, and simmered in a pan for about 24 hours. During the final period of cooking, a handful of leaves of Xgeskl (Hyptis emoryi), a few broken seed pods of ?dexak (Pithecellobium confine), and a few pieces of pomegranate rind are added. Rolls of stitching splints previously dyed red-brown are placed in the dye for about an hour, after which they are black and ready for use. Natural colored stitching splints may be dyed yellow by immersion in salt water in which flowering stems of either Xomitte (Dalea emoryi) or ?akain k6oski (Croton californicus) have previously been boiled. This dye, however, is very seldom used since it weakens the splints and the color fades rapidly. Instead, if a yellow finish is desired, a completed basket stitched with undyed splints may be rubbed with flowering stems of either plant. A few baskets have been made by using stitching splints that have been stained with inexpensive commercial dyes as well as laundry bluing. Some women have even experimented with dyes made by boiling red or green crepe paper. These commercial dyes and dye substitutes produce colors and color combinations that have little appeal to potential buyers. Design Technique Decorated baskets are constructed in essentially the same manner as plain baskets. Designs are created solely by the use of dyed stitching splints. Foundation material is dyed only in the rare instances when an interlocking start is to be included in the colored design, since the extensions of this start</page><page sequence="21">Seri Basketry 125 form the beginning of the foundation bundle. Although a few baskets have dyed centers, normally the start and at least the first three coils (occasionally as many as the first 14 coils) of baskets made for sale are left the natural color of the splints. This undyed center area is then usually enclosed by one or two dyed coils which serve as the base of the design. The rim coil may either be entirely stitched with dyed splints or left the natural color. On some baskets the rim coil is decorated with alternating dyed and natural sections. In still other baskets the main design extends through the rim coil. Design Styles Design styles of Seri baskets are many and varied. Some of them, although distinctive, are unnamed. The Seri presently recognize by name 13 traditional styles. The larger, more dominant design on a multiple design basket is the one that determines the design name of that basket. 1. kw?apdixam 'wrapped' (Figure 12a). 2. seenneel iti k6XXaalka 'butterfly on put' (Figure 12b). Although zoomorphic figures are rarely represented on contemporary baskets, this style is attributed to the ancient ceremonial basket ?asax ispox. 3. kokm6onxk 'zig zag'. This style is exemplified by the outside double white line design in Figure 12c. 4. kolgkki kokm6onxk 'up zig zag' (Figure 12d). This design is also associated with the ceremonial basket ?asax ispox. 5. kw?apdfflixa 'made with rims' (Figure 12e). 6. kokpdaixa 'swirled' (Figure 13a). 7. dSSoox kUnnoox it i?iix 'star flame on to-be' (Figures 13b-c; 14a, c; also the inner design element of Figure 14b). This style occurs more often than any other. 8. dnnoo ?a?defkox 'in points-put-on'. This style is exemplified by the outer design element in Figure 14b and by the inner white line design in Figure 12c. 9. Xdaslka iti yaayolka 'cactus (card6n plural) on put' (Figure 14d). 10. ittii k6a?tolka 'on put (separated)' (Figure 14e). This design is said to represent the painting of one's face with fruit pulp obtained from his first cactus fruit gathering trip of the season. 11. k1'kke iti k6oyolka 'person on put' (Figure 15a). This design is one of the few which utilize anthropomorphic figures. Although it depicts supernatural beings (Griffen 1959:16), these figures are said to have no religious significance when used in a basket decoration. 12. k6ol ano kaap 'carrying-net in be' (Figures 1 Ig, 15b). This design combines elements of styles 7 and 8. It depicts a basket in a carrying net. A recent name for this style is ?dsso ano kdap 'fish-net in be'.</page><page sequence="22">126 Moser d e C a 000:; ONf %8~r Figure 12. Seri basket designs.

In addition to the above traditional styles that bear names, more recent designs have been developed, of which at least one has been named. The checkerboard design illustrated in Figure 15d may well have been learned from the Papago, but its name, raama kkw6ospox '(checkerboard) designed- like', is of fairly recent origin. The word rdama derives from damas which is the Spanish term for the game of checkers. The Seri term is applied to this basket design in recognition of its similarity to the checkerboard. Although a broad similarity within each design style allows the Seri to identify the style by name, the execution and arrangement of the element or elements comprising each style vary from one basketmaker to another and from basket to basket (Figures 13b-c; 14a, c). In the extensive collection which Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth Moorhead of Tucson gathered at random, there was almost no duplication of precisely the same decoration. Pima and Apache designs (Figures 16a and 15e respectively) have been copied from photographs or drawings, and a variety of elaborate designs drawn by outsiders have been incorporated into baskets on request. These have included animal and bird designs (Figure 16b) even though, with the exception of the butterfly motif of style 2, zoomorphic representations are not traditional. Some women have incorporated a person's name into made-to-order baskets (Figure 16d). Another design (Figure 16e), although unnamed, is said to have been used by the "Giants" (the ancient Seri) as a pottery design. Befitting the general pattern of Seri individuality, a woman feels free to choose whatever basket designs may appeal to her. Designs are neither the property of families nor individuals, and it appears that no resentment is felt by a woman whose designs have been copied by another basketmaker. Since young girls learn basketry primarily from their mothers, a woman will often favor designs used by her mother. On the other hand, she may prefer other designs or create her own. Thus the traditional patterns are carried on without preventing the development of new and original designs, some of which, if successful enough, may be given names of their own. PLAITED BASKET The only basketry technique known to the Seri beside coiling is plaiting. Since Gilg (Di Peso and Matson 1965:55) mentioned "woven mats" in 1692, this technique is obviously not a recent development among the Seri. A single kind of container (Figure 16c), called iko'ask 'to rustle', was produced by this technique. It was made with an open plain weave (over one-under one interval) and it takes the form of a shallow box which may be either square or rectangular. The square container illustrated is 24 cm wide</page><page sequence="27">Seri Basketry 131 i ~~~ " .i ia: 'a~~~~~~~ ~ ~~ :::iaa::ul~- :aa::aai::: : aa .. i.: .. : .- - . .

This strainer was used to separate seeds from the pulp of cardon fruit. The ik6ask is made from wide, untrimmed strips of the same materials used in coiled baskets. Four dampened strips are laid in the basketmaker's lap and interwoven at the center. Additional strips are added and woven in until the desired length and width of the base are achieved. The point of an awl is used to achieve an even spacing of the strips. After the base is woven, it is laid on a piece of cloth which has been spread over a flat area of sand and the strips are pounded lightly with a stone. According to the Seri, this sets the weave more firmly. The ends of the strips are then bent upward to form the walls of the basket. To keep the strips pliable, the entire basket is occasionally immersed in water. Two thin strips are then tied together and intertwined over, under and around the bottom strips at the point where they have been bent up, thus forming the perimeter of the bottom of the basket. This operation effectively locks the warp and weft strips in place. A short strip, woven diagonally into each corner, reinforces the corner when turned upward in line with the wall strips. The rim is formed by binding a wide strip to the wall strips. These extensions of the bottom warp and weft strips that have been bent upward to form the walls are bent out over the rim strip from both sides. Then a moist iteelox strip, while being intertwined between the wall strips, is looped and knotted around each wall strip and its tip that has been folded down over the rim strip. When the rim strip has made a full circle, its end is trimmed to a point and tucked under. Thus the assembly is firmly locked together. Another method of finishing the rim of this strainer is said to involve the use of sinew bindings. To stiffen the basket, the basketmaker sometimes weaves reinforcing strips diagonally across the bottom from corner to corner. When the strainer is used, the split halves of the card6n fruit are tapped against the bottom strips. The seeds fall through the spaces between the strips into a container, and the fruit pulp remains in the strainer (Felger and Moser Seri Ethnobotany, in preparation). Punctured metal from 20-liter cans replaced the plaited strainer some 50 years ago. Seeds of the card6n fruit declined as a food source in the late 1930's, paralleling the shift to a cash economy and the introduction of commercial food products. DOMESTIC USE OF COILED BASKETS Formerly every Seri woman, both young and old, owned a work basket which was her most important single household utensil (Smith 1959: 15). This basket (the ?dssaaxda), invariably of first class workmanship, is seldom seen today due both to the soaring demand for decorated baskets of all types and the availability of metal basins and dishes which serve as functional substitutes. In addition, the present market for ironwood carvings, necklaces,</page><page sequence="29">Seri Basketry 133 and other artifacts has lured the women into the manufacture of those lucrative items and reduced the production of work baskets. Smith (1959:15) has observed that, "males never made, rarely used, and seldom had occasion even to touch baskets." However, Jestis Ibarra, now an elderly man, tells of having made a number of baskets when he was young. He traded them for food at ranches. According to Jesuis, one other man, called Francisco, also made baskets. Since Francisco's son, Andrez Valdez, died as an old man around 1931, it is likely that Francisco was producing baskets sometime between about 1850 and 1870. It is true that males rarely used and seldom touched baskets. However, there were at least four occasions when males did use the work basket for specialized purposes. These specialized uses, plus the normal female uses of work baskets, can be grouped into 10 broad categories. TRANSPORT. The work basket is probably used most extensively as a burden carrier, balanced on the head with the aid of a headring. It is used to transport items including the following: Food. Shellfish, fish, meat (Smith 1959:15), cactus fruit, mesquite beans (McGee 1898:206-7), berries, barrel cactus buds, tubers, seeds, and other plant foods are carried on the head in a basket. New baskets are sealed to prevent fruit juice and other liquids from draining through onto one's head by coating the inside with an atole or gruel made of ground seeds. While gathering cactus fruit, a woman promptly drinks any juice that accumulates in the basket. A huge load of mesquite beans can be accommodated in a basket by building up successive layers of beans with the ends of the outside pods intertwined to bind them together. This oversize load, called ?aSdi, is also held together by tying it with strips made from long mesquite twigs. To increase the load capacity of a basket when transporting barrel cactus buds or certain cactus fruit, its sides may be extended with sticks that are held in place by the pressure of the load itself (Felger and Moser, Seri Ethnobotany, in preparation). Firewood. Seri women often carry firewood in baskets for great distances. Trash. Camp refuse is carried away in baskets and dumped (Smith 1959:15). Dirt. Dirt for making the mud used in plastering the outside of ocotillo house walls is transported in a basket. Sand. Clean sand is brought in baskets to cover the floor area of the houses of a beach camp (Smith 1959:15). Possessions. Household goods are transported from camp to camp in baskets (Smith 1959:15). Child. A baby or small child was sometimes carried from one camp to another lying or seated in a basket. The basket was placed inside a carrying net and suspended from one end of a man's carrying yoke (Moser 1970:209). FOOD PREPARATION Work Platform. The basket serves as a work platform in the preparation of meat and fish (Smith 1959:15), as well as mesquite beans, cactus fruit, seeds, and other foods (Johnson 1959:10). Food may be kept clean by lining the bottom of a basket with certain plants. Winnowing. The Seri have four techniques of winnowing with baskets. The first, called kdospX, involves tossing grain, seeds, and small berries into the air repeatedly until the chaff blows away. The second technique, called k6ommeen, consists of moving a basket of grain, seeds, or small fruit in a rolling, rotating fashion to bring the larger sticks, leaves, and other impurities</page><page sequence="30">134 Moser to the surface where they can be easily removed by hand. The third process, called k6oktS, consists of tapping a basket of seeds or grain on a hard surface to bring the lighter impurities and pieces of husk to the surface and to the edge of the basket from where they are scraped away by hand. The fourth method, called ikkii kispX, is used to refine powder. A basketful of pulverized clay or rabbit dung, used in the manufacture of pottery, is tapped on a hard object to bring the finer powder to the surface. The basket is tilted and the powder is allowed to spill over the edge into another receptacle (Bowen and Moser 1968:92-3). The term k6ospX, which that article lists for this winnowing process, should read ikkii kispX. Parching. In a process called kdamn, live coals and grains of field corn were shaken together in an old basket until the corn was parched. BOWL OR DISH. After food was prepared, the basket was frequently used as a communal serving and eating dish for the nuclear family. Other baskets, usually of the ?asx ittoox variety, were often used as individual eating dishes and bowls. A man used a shell (either Mactra dolabriformis or Laevicardium elatum) for a spoon with which to dip his gruel from the bowl. Children sometimes used small baskets as eating bowls. MUD MIXING. The mud used to plaster the walls of the flat-roofed ocotillo house is prepared in an old work basket. One such mud-caked basket which was purchased and cleaned turned out to be a neatly decorated ?assaax. POTTERY MAKING (Bowen and Moser 1968:97, 122). Winnowing. As noted above, the basket is used to winnow the clay powder and the ground dung temper used in the manufacture of pottery. Work Platform. The basket serves as a nest or work base for the clay pot under construction. Griddle Mold. A tortilla griddle, called it ikatdskar, was made by pressing clay into the bottom of a flat basket. After firing, the piece was used as a trade item with neighboring ranchers. WASHBASIN. An old tray basket often served as a basin used for washing one's hair or clothing. INFANT CARE. Seri babies, always born directly into the hands of a midwife, may be bathed in a tray basket. A basket filled with cloth covered sand is often used as a temporary crib for the infant after he has been bathed, dressed, and fed sweetened water (Moser 1970:205-6). CONTAINER FOR HOLDING GAMBLING STAKES. Men sometimes used the work basket during a card game to hold the stakes, which were often bullets. MUSIC. Still another male involvement with baskets is their use in conjunction with musical instruments. Musical Bow (Coolidge and Coolidge 1939:208). Two inverted work baskets, serving as resonators, are laid over small depressions made in the sand. The musician then grasps the middle of the bow and, with the string facing up, places each end of the bow on a basket. He then taps the taut string with a stick to produce a steady beat to accompany his singing. Rasping Stick (Coolidge and Coolidge 1939:208). The multiple notched rasping stick is played by rapidly raking another stick back and forth over its notched side. The end of the rasping stick rests on a work basket which acts as a resonator. Gourd Drum (Bowen and Moser 1970:190). One half of a dried gourd was inverted and floated in a water-filled work basket. A singer accompanied himself by tapping a steady beat on the gourd with a stick.</page><page sequence="31">Seri Basketry 135 BRIDE PRICE (Griffen 1959:25). Both decorated and plain baskets, as well as bundles of freshly cut torote and bundles of prepared basketmaking materials, are used as partial payment of the bride price and as gifts from one woman to another. CEREMONIAL FUNCTIONS OF BASKETS Accounts related by the older people indicate the past importance of the ceremonial role of three basket types. Fiestas, said to have been inspired by a shaman's dream or vision, were held upon the completion of those baskets to bring good luck. At present, the ceremonial function of Seri baskets has all but disappeared. In one classic account of the giant basket (sdppiim), the preparation for the fiesta was begun on Tibur6n Island at sakpdttiiX, the main camp of a subdivision of Band III territory (Moser 1963:16). First, a huge tray basket, the ?asax ispox, was made. Then the sappiim was begun. As the woman worked on the sdppiim, the awl occasionally made a screeching sound as it pierced the coil. The sound was ignored until the base of the basket was completed. When the basketmaker began to form the walls, however, a dangerous spirit was said to have entered the basket. Thereafter the screeching of the awl was interpreted as the spirit wailing. This spirit, called kwen, was feared because it would bring death to the basket maker or one of her family. To avoid this danger, the woman had to pacify the spirit. The ?asax ispox was filled with patties of mesquite bean flour and little balls of cactus fruit. Whenever the awl screeched, some of the food was tossed onto the ground near the sappiim from where it was retrieved and eaten by people who happened to be nearby. The purpose was to create a festive air and help pacify the spirit. In addition the basketmaker sang the following song four times. t6ii kW?a?ooteka t6ii kW?a?6otexaaya t6ii kW?a?ooteka t6ii kW?a?6otexaaya sapiissaaX imiippooXiiya t6ii kW?a?6oteka t6ii kW?a?6otexaaya Rock it away, rock it away Rock it away, rock it away The sdppiinm pulled out its soul (wailed) Rock it away, rock it away. The song was directed to the spirit who was told to pacify the basket. As soon as the song had been sung, the danger of death was averted. The sdppiim is said to have been decorated. When the huge basket was finished, it was suspended from a pole and carried to the beach by two men. It was then placed on a large balsa and transported to a camp called Xdunta on the mainland. From there it was carried to a mountain pass just south of</page><page sequence="32">136 Moser Johnson Peak, chosen because it was close to a supply of fresh water. There the people held a fiesta which lasted for four days. The pass was thereafter named sapmdayam 'basket (sdppiim) crossed over'. Taking the basket with them, the group then proceeded further inland to a camp now called sapmiiskaX 'basket disintegrated'. There they were joined by members of other subdivisions of the same band, and together they held a second fiesta which lasted for eight days. This fiesta is said to have been a time of great celebration. The men hunted deer, and when a successful hunter returned to camp, the rest of the people would run out to him and cut off chunks of deer meat until it was gone. There was much eating, drinking, and dancing, and each day the fiesta game, kamoiilkox 'the circled ones' (Griffen 1959:14), was played. The people celebrated to make both themselves and the basket happy. At the end of the eight days, the spirit is said to have left the basket. The sdppiim, no longer important to the people, was abandoned. The Seri attach importance to objects and animals of exceptional size and generally treat them with a respect bordering on fear. Since the ?asax ispox, like the sdpplim, was very large, it too is said to have possessed a strong spirit. When the awl screeched during the fabrication of the ?asax ispox, the basketmaker was careful to stop work and sing the pacification song. Upon completion of the basket, it was also celebrated with a four day fiesta. The ?asax ispox was used primarily as a work basket. It was also the basket used to hold the gifts which were thrown into the air for those present at the end of a girl's puberty ceremony (Griffen 1959:24). Now any available work basket or metal basin may serve this purpose. Formerly a four night fiesta was held to celebrate the completion of the large olla-shaped basket, ?aat ?anoo?k' kdakkoox. BELIEFS RELATED TO BASKETS The feared spirit of the basket, kWMn, is said to be tiny, fat, and old. It is female and has a large face. It is also a defiler and is especially active at night when it may enter a person while he is asleep. This contamination attributed to kwen is called yakwMnne. When a person has been contaminated, he becomes wan and weak. He is then said to be kWMn oikw 'spirit killed-by'. The yakWenne is contagious and is transmitted to objects that an afflicted person touches. As late as 1925 most adults were still washing their hands each morning to rid themselves of this contamination. Basketmaking materials are particularly susceptible to contamination by an afflicted basketmaker's hands. These items are therefore considered to be dangerous for others to touch or steal. Even the water used in basket construction is contaminated and must not be used for any other purpose.</page><page sequence="33">Seri Basketry 137 The most frequently mentioned penalty for violation of kWen-related taboos applies to women. Any woman who steals basketmaking materials will suffer a breech presentation on the birth of her next baby (Moser 1970:203). A boy who should happen to wash his hands in water used for basketmaking will pass the breech birth penalty on to his future wife. While a finished basket holds no apparent danger for the basketmaker, user, or buyer, there is somehow a tinge of evil always associated with it. While no one today expresses concern about this evil, it is admitted that baskets are somehow involved with spirit power. It is said, for instance, that it is dangerous to mistreat or destroy a basket. The spirit kW6n will cause the culprit to be harmed in some way. When a basket is worn out, it is abandoned, never destroyed. When a woman dies, her baskets are buried with her. These, along with her other possessions, will be available for her use in koaXiat, the Seri hereafter (Griffen 1959:20-1). Evil and danger are associated with baskets that are dyed either solid or nearly-solid black or red-brown. They are believed to be especially con- taminated by kwen, and the maker of such a basket should give it to her burial sponsor. However, the danger of such baskets is not so great that it prevents certain young basketmakers of today from making one upon customer request. Two minor beliefs might be mentioned in connection with baskets. A halo around either the sun or moon means that that celestial object is making a basket. The Seri name for the sand dollar is Xepe isx 'sea its-basket'. BASKETS IN SHAMAN SONGS Baskets are sometimes involved as an intermediary in communication between the supernatural world and the shaman. The Seri believe that any animal, object, or phenomenon of nature can communicate to the shaman through dreams. Ordinary people sometimes recognize the voices of various spirit phenomena, but only a shaman can receive a coherent message. The following three songs were communicated by a basket medium to Juan Mata, a shaman who died around 1943, and became his property. In the first song the cactus fruit is chiding the woman who lacks the courage to go into the desert to gather the fruit in the oppressive summer heat. kWdam isoooxiya i?iiiSat iki yemitXiya isogitayaa ?asigili ?atXin eaaliya sogako Xomaya k6Sminox kannoox ano ?ayomi tiaa The huge woman scoots over into the shade Her big basket and new headring with her</page><page sequence="34">138 Moser I having spirit power Where the sound of the summer heat is, we are. In the second song the basket is speaking. The fourth line is spoken by the woman who cannot bring herself to go out into the oppressive heat. ?Mnt i?da miifapitaya k6SSiih kanox ?eekotax kWimafini sogitaya k6SSiih kanox ?eekoti koyom ?iissaaXi kWiyepiti ?iissaXi y6mmataXi k6Sminox ?aako Xomaa teee For the land the time has come The sound of summer heat passes through the desert The sound of summer heat pervades the desert I backed out, I lost interest The summer heat's sound has spirit power. The third song speaks of the communion between a woman and her basket. It is said that the woman was out in the desert heat gathering cactus fruit. While returning to camp, she fell and lost the fruit, so she went back into the desert and gathered more. The woman was said to be Loreto Marcos. Juan Mata saw this happen in a dream, and he taught Loreto the song and made it hers. k6Sminox ?imo koyox ?da ano k6ooSa ?emeXdli taydma ?iyaliyaliya ?9ekot ano k6ooSa k6Sminox kimaXdaatax ti ?ayomi tiaa The summer heat's sound is over there She gathers with the stick I accompanied her into the desert, we talked together The summer heat's shimmering sound We went along together in that. PROSPECT The future of Seri basketry is uncertain. As with most indigenous groups, the process of acculturation is rapidly changing the customs, values, and aspirations of the Seri. Today's youth seem to place little value on the traditional Seri way of life, and their interest is rapidly being captured by Western materialism to which they are increasingly exposed. The speed with which this change is taking place has been particularly intensified by the phenomenal success of the recently introduced ironwood carving industry (Johnston 1968:155-66). Today a whole family often works together to produce carvings that bring a substantial cash income. This income from woodcarving has even enabled a number of young men, with the help of their families, to purchase used cars or pick-up trucks. It is simply</page><page sequence="35">Seri Basketry 139 more profitable at present to make carvings than baskets, and for this reason many women have turned to carving. While at present many girls show no interest in making baskets, there are some who do. There is a ready market for every basket produced, and baskets are almost always sold as soon as they are completed. The demand is so great, in fact, that expectant buyers are often unable to find a single finished product. As a result, sizable down payments are commonly being left with an order for a woman's next basket. Today some of the finest decorated baskets are being produced by three girls in their late teens. With the constantly increasing demand and rising prices it is probable that other girls will be encouraged to continue this craft. Furthermore, because of a developing shortage of ironwood, it seems likely that many women will eventually return to basketmaking. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I wish gratefully to acknowledge the contributions of Ralph C. Michelsen of the University of California, Irvine. I am especially grateful to him for his careful description of the mechanics of the basketmaking process and for several of the photographs reproduced herein. I am indebted to Thomas Bowen of California State University, Fresno, for his extensive criticisms and suggestions offered concerning various drafts of this paper. I am also indebted to Frederick and Frances Hamerstrom of Plainfield, Wisconsin, Margaret Daly of the Summer Institute of Linguistics, and Scott H. Ryerson of Tucson, Arizona for their helpful comments and criticisms of the manuscript. I am grateful to Ryerson for securing baskets for photographing and for attending to other details involved in the production of this paper. Special credit goes to my wife Becky who helped me ferret out the facts of Seri basketry. I would like to express my sincere appreciation to Helga Teiwes of the Arizona State Museum for photographing all of the baskets illustrated. I also wish to thank Richard S. Felger of Tucson, Arizona for identifying the botanical materials. I am deeply grateful to the many Seri who have made this paper possible.
