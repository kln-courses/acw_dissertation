Martin Heidegger, Being and Time 595</page><page sequence="2">William Spanos (Binghamton, N. Y.) to David Antin (Solana Beach, California), April 6, 1973. Dear David Antin: The debate over what your reading was all about still goes on, so in some curious way you made an impact despite appearances. As for me, it was a rare privilege having the chance to talk with you. I hope our paths will cross again sometime. Again, I do hope you'll send boundary 2 some of your creative work. I'd be honored to publish it. Both Peggy and I send you best regards. Bill David Antin (Solana Beach) to William Spanos (Binghamton), July 16, 1973. * Dear Bill: I realized that time was drawing near for your deadline or for your vacation or both, and I had promised to send material to you. Almost everything I'm doing now is in the form of these poem talk pieces, and I am now aware that they are both long and "difficult." But since you had suggested I send you something of the order of "talking at pomona," I thought I would let you look at "what am i doing here?" If it is something you like enough to print, let me know; or if you are not enthusiastic about the particular piece but are not put off by the "genre," let me know that - because I have others I am at work on and nearly finished with. - How are things going with boundary 2? Is there still a grave "money" problem as appears inevitable with magazines or have you temporarily fought off the creditors? Best to both of you, David Note: in the interest of speed - write to the above address - and above all - don't feel any hesitation at sending it back if you are not happy with it. *On the request of Mr. Antin, the editors have made no effort to "correct" his "impressionist orthography and typing." He consoles himself "by thinking of Coxton's spelling and the fact that Shaxpere never spelled his own name the same way twice." William Spanos (Claremont, N.H.) to David Antin (Solana Beach), July 24, 1973. Dear David Antin: I just got your mss. here in New Hampshire, where we're spending the month prior to the Aug. 15 flight to Europe. I'll get to it right away and report as soon as possible. I'm concerned about the timing. I mean that the Winter issue is already over-extended, and so if this is good we may have to hold it over until the next general number - Let's see, anyway. 596</page><page sequence="3">I got some good material from Clayton Eshleman on the basis of his conversation with you. Thank you very much for making the contact. I'm putting the last touches - I hope - on the "spatial form" book Icon and Time: Towards a Postmodern Theory of Literary Interpretation, and hope to have it ready for typing by the time I leave for France so I can devote the whole year to finishing the big book on Postmodern Literature. (By the way, I'm seriously thinking of doing a chapter on Olson &amp; Ignatow as antithetical faces of postmodernism in American poetry.) Best, Bill P.S. I'll keep you posted. As for the financial situation, we're still more or less above water, though the administration is unbelievably hard to convince that we're a worthy enterprise. William Spanos (Lake Sunapee, N.H.) to David Antin (Solana Beach), July 29, 1973. Dear David: I've read the talk poem you sent me and think it's really great. God damn it, this stuff is really postmodern in its "antipoetic" effort to recover the poetry of talking. I've sent it on to Bob Kroetsch, my co-editor, recommending that we do everything we can to get it into the 5th number of boundary 2 (though I should warn you that he did not respond as enthusiastically to your "reading" at Binghamton as I did). So the main issue, I think, will be whether or not we'll be able to get it into the 5th (Vol. 2/3): we're considerably beyond our allotted page length and will have to do some postponing of materials as it is. I hope Kroetsch will agree with me that your talk-poem is good enough to warrant drastic measures like delaying a couple of reviews. I'll let you know as soon as I hear from Bob. We got our car to the Port of Newark a couple of days ago, and so have begun the process of departure in earnest. I don't like the feel of uprootedness, but that's what it's all about. Sincerely, Bill William Spanos (Lake Sunapee) to Robert Kroetsch (Binghamton), July 29, 1973. Dear Bob: I've read the Antin talking-poem and I think it's stupendous, a tour de force, no doubt, but exciting not only as content but as form. I find this effort to recover talking a kind of poetic anti-poetry that is truly "postmodern," returning as it does to the kind of peripatetic talk that is 597</page><page sequence="4">prior to print. Anyway, read it and let me know what you think. I recall your not being especially impressed by Antin the night he "read" [at S.U.N.Y. Binghamton in the boundary 2 reading series, March 28, 1973], and I don't want to pressure you into something you're strongly opposed to. But there are things in this piece that struck me as being truly Kroetschean, especially the story about the sad lady who found a lover with three red cherries tattooed on his prick. And, God damn, it is strangely poetic, this explorative talk that gets triggered heuristically simply by words. I think it would fit in beautifully with the rest of the major fiction and poetry that we've got for Vol. 2/3. What I suggest is that we simply postpone anything that comes in after the August first deadline I gave everyone a long time ago (with the exception of the article by Johnsen, since we need it with the Harold Bloom piece for the essay section on "postmodernism"), in favor of the Antin piece and Eshleman's "Van Gogh" poem and his review of Blackburn's Early Selected Y Mas and Peire Vidal. Let me know what you think.... Bill Robert Kroetsch (Binghamton) to David Antin (Solana Beach), September 14, 1973. Dear David Antin: About your poem.... Bill Spanos is off to France and I've beeil waiting for him to get an address so we can correspond. The matter in a nutshell is this. Bill writes to me: "I've read the Antin talking-poem and I think it's stupendous, a tour de force..." Unfortunately, I find it much too long. I can't get caught up in it. The form invites cutting, so I've written to Bill to see if he will approach you about cutting it. Twenty pages of that text is overkill for me .... However, if you and Bill can agree on some reduction, or if you and he both insist that the whole thing must be published, I'll go along with it .... We continue to get requests for your essay. ["Modernism and Postmodernism: Approaching the Present in American Poetry," boundary 2, 1/1 (Fall 1972)]. It seems to have been the most successful piece in number one. Perhaps I'm wrong about your poem. Bob Robert Kroetsch (Binghamton) to William Spanos (Lyon, France), September 14, 1973. Dear Bill: ... The Antin piece. The talking-poem. Frankly, I can't bring myself to read to the end. I'd prefer that we publish something like one half of it. So I'm sending it to you with the invitation that you cut it off somewhere - and the form invites such cutting - if you can possibly bring 598</page><page sequence="5">yourself to do it.... Believe me, I understand the way you identify with one who speaks as passionately as do you! But I personally believe in a necessary tension between form and the Dionysian. A nice irony, that I should end up being a reactionary old sonofabitch while you are crusading for ultimate freedoms. But that's part of the fun of co-editing .... And reading manuscripts without that testing, that abrasion, is finally boring for me. Bob David Antin (Solana Beach) to William Spanos (Lyon, France), September 18, 1973. Dear Bill: I hope you're settled comfortably and have been able to minimize the kind of confusion that always results from the excitement of travel. Ordinarily I wouldn't rush to write you so soon, knowing that you can barely have settled in, but the decision on what to do with "what am i doing here?" was still hanging when you left - and knowing that you had a deadline for your winter issue i checked with robert kroetsch about the outcome. As you've probably heard from him, he sent me a very friendly note explaining his position. If you haven't seen it I'm sending you a xerox. As you had anticipated he's not enthusiastic about the piece, though clearly willing to go along with it if we are both committed to it. I really feel that I understand his response, but it would be not only impossible to cut the piece but directly antithetical to its significance. I explained this at length to him in the letter of September 18, which I am also sending a copy of to you. My reasoning is I think clearly outlined in the letter to him, and I hope you will agree with me. I also hope he will see my reasons even if not agreeing. Naturally the decision belongs to the two of you. But if you can't see your way to printing it as it is, I would have to publish it somewhere else; and it is for this reason that I am a little anxious to get a final decision from boundary 2. My best to both of you, and I hope that work on Peggy's thesis is already under way and that your book is in the typewriter. Yours, David Antin David Antin (Solana Beach) to Robert Kroetsch (Binghamton), September 18, 1973. Dear Robert Kroetsch: I'm really glad the essay is continuing to excite interest; I also receive requests for xeroxes of it and the address of boundary 2 which I think is doing a fine job throughout. About the talk-poem, naturally I dont agree, but I understand your feelings about it. It seems to me that the difficulty inherent in it (its 599</page><page sequence="6">feeling of length) is a consequence of its oral structure. It is too long - for a literary text, which it isn't. And all oral work faces the same problem - that the way the mind works at formulating under these phenomenologically more natural conditions - of being up on your feet and talking - is more relaxed or casual, gradually feeling for doors in a wall say or the right turn off the commonplace road. Naturally it will also take occasional wrong ones, but to erase the false step will also erase the way of discovery. Which is what I am after. I want nothing less than a paradigm of the true working of the mind at some real thing. We have to get out of the hubris of Cartesianism or even Baconian empiricism. And the cost will at first seem very great, because it was the 17th century that named the terms of "respectable" thinking. One may even say they invented "the fact." What I'm offering is one step against this sanctified position as it is congealed into "style." Homer is too long too, and so is Beowulf. Too long for a text to be looked at - but not too long for the ear-mind. I hope and feel my own work is similarly justified. I do think you're making a mistake, but frankly it's a mistake that I have also made. Several years ago I was editing a magazine with Jerome Rothenberg, called Some/thing. And there was a long poem of Allen Ginsberg's called the Wichita Vortex Sutra (or some such thing) that was composed, I think, entirely on a tape recorder while Allen and Peter were driving cross-country in a Volksbus. As I remember Jerry and I had a chance to publish the poem-rant and I felt then that it was too thin. By which I meant it didn't feel "dense" enough for a poem; it seemed too much like top of the head talk (admittedly of a special kind). We took another piece of Allen's "Who Be Kind To?", a very lovely piece and very much more recognizable as a poem. It was shorter, more contained, framed as a piece of art. In short - it was more literary. Now I think we were both wrong. I in relation to Allen and you in relation to me. I really can't cut the piece, because if I were to tighten it it would remove the particular qualities that made me talk it. Naturally, I hope that I have encoded in the text (because it is after all being carried in a text) the qualities of this oralness I am seeking; and hope you will see it my way or be able to go with me anyway. Naturally the decision is yours and Bill's. But I really can't cut it. Thanks for your frankness. Best, David Antin Robert Kroetsch (Binghamton) to William Spanos (Lyon, France), September 24, 1973. Dear Bill: ... Antin writes a fine letter that explains why he doesn't want to cut his long piece. You've no doubt heard from him also and may have 600</page><page sequence="7">written to me by now. I can only say I don't want to put the piece in number five. Number seven will be fine. His letter is enclosed. Please return it.... Your concern about our not receiving unsolicited mss. The truth is, only a few people are doing what we're interested in. And those few people are so busy they do nothing on speculation. Their names appear with great frequency in the few receptive journals. I begin to suspect the special issue is our most effective way to develop a group of contributors and to get subscriptions. The Olson issue continues to bring in orders - and we won't even be sending out a big advertisement until a release date is more evident. The Canadian issue hasn't even been announced and I'm receiving queries, manuscripts. Number 5 is a useful kind of compromise in that it's almost a special issue on Ignatow and will get some of that kind of attention.... So when do you propose to do the Heidegger issue? Number 9 at the latest, I would say. Tarn: ... I lump him with Antin, a passion of yours - deeply rooted in your particular passion for a particular kind of language - that I can't appreciate. Berryman speaks to me, and you probably can't bear his Dream Songs. . . . Anyway, Kessler is still interested and has a budget and I'll certainly cooperate with Milt in attempting to bring Tarn here. If I were in Tarn's shoes I'd prefer to wait until next year and meet with you, do a serious dialogue. I've given readings of my own where the person who invited me or was interested in my work was absent. Becomes a bit farcical. And please understand that I respect your admiration for these people and more, I suspect there's something going on in their work that I don't appreciate. E.g., the enclosed book by Tarn certainly owes something to Levi-Strauss and I'm fascinated (by the abomination) L-S - but - well - From Honey to Ashes is better reading than these poems for me. Bob William Spanos (Lyon, France) to Robert Kroetsch (Binghamton), September 25, 1973. Dear Bob: 1) The first time I read the Antin talk poem I was as put off as you were: overkill. The second time I read it I found it, as I said in my letter, "stupendous" as a tour de force. The third time I read it - last night - i found it even more deeply interesting as a piece of experimental oral poetry - or whatever you want to call it. I even found myself anticipating, I'm not quite sure what, perhaps the turn of mind. More specifically, (a) there's a structural rhythm - an interspersion of "story" and speculation; (b) a rhythm of an intelligent and sensitive speaking voice, which probably accounts for the sense of exploration it generates, a voice that at the same time is always contemporary and American, not 601</page><page sequence="8">only in its diction, idiom and rhythm, but also in the political and socio-cultural concerns of the content. I am convinced in a kind of absolute way that any foreigner would be utterly enthralled with Antin's sound and would want to learn from it. (c) A poetic suggestiveness emerges despite the deliberate "anti-poetic" effort to suppress all the paraphernalia of poetry - metaphor, compression, closure, etc. - in favor of a loose "prosaic" and "stammering" language. (d) The thing reverberates with echoes of the past (the oral poetry of Homer, Plato's Dialogues, and the peripatetic poet-philosophers, the whole Parry and Lord Singer of Tales context) and is at the same time utterly situated in the present: McLuhan, the French parole vs. ecriture debate, Heideggerian phenomenology, and, of course, the whole thrust of American poetry towards oral "composition." I understand what you mean when you say you can't bring yourself to read it to the end and that you believe in a necessary tension between form and the Dionysian. Still, I think postmodern poetry is revolting from that imperative as a fundamentally soul-destroying coercion of the imagination, one of the most terrible legacies of anthropomorphic humanism. I'm talking about the hysterical Western need to name the world and about its correlative, the advent of writing for the printed page. Most postmodern American poets don't go anywhere near as far as Antin goes, perhaps wisely, because he probably goes too far. BUT in so doing he also gives dramatic, even startling relief to a crucial postmodern impulse. It may be that neither of us can justify the poetic value of Antin's piece. You obviously think it's not very good. I think it's damned good (though I'm aware of its essential limitations). But I do think the piece is extremely important in the light of what boundary 2 is intended to do. And it is on this ground, finally, that I will try to persuade you that we should publish it as is. As for your suggestion that we edit it on the grounds that such a form invites cutting, I can't agree with you, though I do wish the piece had been shorter. My reasons should be evident from my comments about the poem in the first paragraph. (I also doubt very much if Antin would agree to its being cut.) I find, paradoxically, that there is a rather continuous structure, on the verge of being tight, in the surface looseness: the rhythm of exploration is what I'd call it. Antin never really forgets a single word, at least that's the impression I get. We visited the 9th-12th century Benedictine Abbey (related to Cluny) at Charlieu last Sunday. The drive along the southern fringe of Burgundy that took us over the mountains of Beaujolais (the Beaujolais wine country) was breathtakingly beautiful. The abbey, like so many religious sites, was pretty much destroyed during the French Revolution: Once again that revelatory sense that Art, especially iconic art, is a symbolic expression of a disdain for the life of man-in-time, i.e., "privileged," came powerfully to me at Charlieu as the guide spoke of the depredations of the French Revolution, the defaced sculpture, the 602</page><page sequence="9">destroyed stained glass windows, the hacked up columns, the demolished chapels. For the revolutionary, Art is symbolic of that disdain - that privileged disdain. And his instinct to break the images is profoundly right. Art should drive us into immediate relationship with life, into inescapable consciousness of the suffering, the agony of other men, where we are obligated to make significant choices. Art as agent of distance, whether it takes the form of aesthetic pleasure (the neither/nor) or even consolation is irresponsible in the root sense of that word. It is terrible to see the literally defaced figures of the magnificent tympan of the narthex portal, the framing floral work and the sculpture (Ascension of Christ) of which were clearly influenced by Byzantine mosaics and icons. But it is also terrible to contemplate the horrors from which these figures were so enormously distanced. What we plan to do is work like hell for 5 or 6 days of the week and take the weekend or part of it off to travel ( - as long as the car holds up, and it better because it's already cost us about 700 in shipment fees, taxes of one kind or another, and registration). There is much to see in the provinces and we're all eager to see as much of it as we can. I'm writing madly, but the deeper I get into hermeneutics, the more complicated it all gets. But I'll get there! Best, Bill P.S. I got a letter from David Antin just before posting this. Both the letter to me and the one to you are persuasive and not at all assertive. Even if I were not enthusiastic about publishing the piece I would want to on the basis of his argument. I hope it hits you the same way. Let me know. Incidentally, what about the possibility of publishing the correspondence or part of it as context for "what am i doing here?" and as a means of making our individual positions clear. Would you feel better about publishing it then? William Spanos (Lyon, France) to David Antin (Solana Beach), September 27, 1973. Dear David: I got your letter and the copy of your response to Bob Kroetsch. And I just had a letter from Kroetsch including your answer. I've written to Bob, after rereading your piece once more and finding it even more interesting than the first two times, to let him know how strongly I feel we should publish it as is. My argument is that, despite our inability to agree on its quality as art, it is very clear that the thing is doing something in the way of experimentation that is centrally postmodern (while at the same time generating reverberation out of the past) and American - especially in the voice - and on this ground alone it becomes important that we publish it. Let's wait and see what Bob's response will 603</page><page sequence="10">be. My guess is that one of his problems has nothing to do with the piece as such: the problem of space in the 5th issue. How would you feel if I could get a compromise from him by suggesting that we postpone the publication of "what am i doing here?" until the next general number (after the special Canadian issue)? That strikes me as a very real possibility because Jerry Rothenberg is doing an "interview" with me for that one and sending us some poems as well. Since your "reading" with Rothenberg is the context of your talk-poem, the two of you in the same issue would be extremely appropriate. Would you be willing to go along with this solution? It would also give prominence to your talk-poem, whereas it would get buried in Vol. 2/3, since that number is virtually a special issue on David Ignatow. If you accept my proposal, I'll let Rothenberg know - and add a couple of questions to the interview to bring your relationship with him - and your as opposed to his version of oral poetry - into it.... We are indeed settled in Lyon, finally, after about a month on the road, camping in Provence. We've got the kids into their respective French schools and they seem quite happy about the arrangements, Peggy has begun working on her dissertation - the holdings on Sceve and the French Renaissance at the municipal library are immense and basic - and I've begun to write. So the year may be a good one, though the high cost of living here, the 2 devaluations of the dollar, and my half salary are going to put serious restrictions on what we can do. (Fortunately I've found that I like the Cstes du Rh6ne table wines, at about 65 cents a liter.) But in one way or another we are going to taste some Lyonnais cooking, which, we're told, is supposed to be superb, and of course some Burgundian food, along the line. We've also decided that we're going to Greece next summer. Let me know as soon as possible what you think of my suggestion. Bill William Spanos (Lyon, France) to Robert Kroetsch (Binghamton), October 2, 1973. Dear Bob: Just in case the scribbling in the margins of the last letter didn't come through: What I said was this: The only persons I promised to include in Vol. 2/3 were Ignatow, Swann(Zanzotto), Simic, and Virginia Young. I also agree with you that we should, if possible, publish the Scalapino poems. So what have we got? Ignatow The problem here is that Young has only one Eshleman poem, so there'll be an imbalance unless we include Zanzotto a couple more one or two titled poets. We've also 604</page><page sequence="11">Simic had McClosky for an unconscionably long time, Young so if it's possible I think we should try to get him and possibly McCurry or one of the others, who have only a couple of poems, into the issue. Antin is still a question mark. On the basis of your remark of Sept. 24 about his letter explaining why he doesn't want to cut the piece (where you say "I don't want to put the piece in number five. Number seven will be fine"), I wrote to Antin suggesting the compromise to him and mentioning the fact that we've got an interview going with Rothenberg and that his piece would therefore be more appropriate in the issue in which that appeared, since his talk-poem had its birth in an evening at the San Francisco Poetry Center, where they both read. I haven't heard from him yet, but I'm hoping he'll be willing to wait that long. How does that strike you? ... As for my interest in Tarn, it's not a passion (nor for that matter is Antin's work). But it is good, a lot better than 99 percent of what we've gotten so far - and even published, with the exception of Ritsos (who grows more and more a presence in my consciousness, by the way) - and above all because it is working in an important way with the contemporary materials - Olson, origins, boundaries, etc. - we're interested in. What I mean is that Tarn (and Antin) know where they are and in knowing can make their poetry reverberate outward to encompass much larger areas of human concern, not only present but also past. In other words, they remind us or rather show us where we are. What excites me about Tarn (and Antin) is precisely their ability to awaken in my consciousness relationships between thought and feeling and knowledge both dormant or forgotten and alive which I wasn't aware of in any conscious way, but which on encountering it in their poetry, generates in me the shock of recognition. This doesn't mean that I don't like Berryman in an equally strong way. It means I like Tarn and Antin etc. in a different way. I think it's Eshleman's weakness, for example, that he was governed by a ruling passion in his editing. I've got ruling passions. But can we afford to indulge them as editors of the kind of journal we're editing? We're on the boundary, which means, as we've both agreed over and over again, uncertainty about criteria as to what even constitutes literature. What we can demand is that the stuff we get reverberate with contemporary obsessions in such a way that they jar the habitual past into aliveness. Tarn does that, as does Antin. I think you have to agree with me there. But of course you're not saying that we not publish Tarn. Indeed, you mention that we do an interview with him when I return. I think I'd like to do that, but let's wait till I've gone through all his work, which I now have. Outside of the fact that our winter clothes haven't arrived, we're surviving and even finding moments like our trip into Burgundy last Sunday (Tournus, where there's a magnificent Romanesque church, Saint 605</page><page sequence="12">Philibert - part of a 9th to 12th century abbey - an absolutely perfect model of that powerful and grand style of architecture that had its fulfillment at Cluny) very moving. Bill David Antin (Solana Beach) to William Spanos (Lyon, France), October 7, 1973. Dear Bill: I'm glad to hear that you are firmly convinced of the value of the piece, and I understand Kroetsch's objections, i think, well enough. My own feeling about what to do under the circumstances is that, if Kroetsch is willing to squeeze the piece into this issue [Vol. 2,3] I would rather do that - naturally because i have a commitment to the time in which a thing is done. Because I don't feel that alien from David Ignatow - immensely different as we may be - because we are still somewhere on the same side of the poetic domain at least in relation to the notion of an American vernacular dialect. On the other hand, Ignatow is much too framed a poet for me to identify with fully, much as I like his work. To my mind lovely as he can be within his poetics, he approaches a "poem" too much as a framed object and I am I suppose moving away from that conscious framing. The only framing I will allow is the framing that the attentive mind produces by its intense concentration on the task at hand - and I will also insist on allowing all that looseness that is there before the intensity finds its path or rises from discovering that there is a path, where before it was just walking and is now walking somewhere. That's why I'm glad you had so strong a take on the American voice. Implausible as it may seem I feel a strong identity with Twain and Kerouac and Whitman, without their lyricism maybe, and without the folksiness, but I never was plain folks, nor are my neighbors. So I can see why it would also be reasonable to go for the special emphasis of an issue where Jerry and I could be featured together. If that's the way you prefer it, it might make even more sense. I'll be willing to leave the decision to you. If it's too tough to fit the piece into the "Ignatow" issue, where I wouldn't be an entire stranger, well then we can go for the issue with Jerry. If you let me know what you prefer, I can make corresponding supporting moves. Especially if you decide for the issue with Jerry. It might also be good if for such an issue there was some other talk about these issues - from yourself perhaps among others. I think your own interest in Ritsos and the Greek vernacular of the Romios has a bearing on this. Incidentally, I have retranslated part of the Iliad in a new talking piece scheduled for the Winter issue of Alcheringa to show how much of a talking poet Homer is. Similarly I could make a case and have for Aristotle's "Poetics" as a talking lecture that could never have been prepared for writing in that way. His definitions are just too freakily casual 606</page><page sequence="13">to have been carefully thought out ahead of time. They are all improvisations leading in the direction he wanted to go - to talk about a poetry that was not dependent on musical accompaniment because he wanted to get away from that to get to the center - for him - of the drama - the myth structure or narrational structure of the drama poem. But we can talk about this in a more leisurely way once you've decided what you want to do. In any event don't feel bad about the difficulties. I really do understand the problems, and Kroetsch has every right to his own esthetics, which I suppose I'm challenging head on. Incidentally you may be interested in a funny story about the meaning of the term Roumi (compare with Romios) in Arabic. My old Arabic teacher was an American scholar totally fluent in Arabic, but still an American. He happened to be in a conversation with a bedouin who used to come in to work for a friend of his during the date harvest on his friend's farm. My teacher got into a discussion with the bedouin - of the war - the 1948 war between the Israelis and the "Arabs" - since the farm was in the area now called Israel. The bedouin was confused. He said that "we Arabs cant keep track of the troubles among the "Roumi." Apparently to the bedouin the nationalism of Egypt, Jordan, Syria and whatever does not involve 'Arabs,' to whom the whole lot of them are 'Roumi,' (i.e. Greeks of the Byzantine-Roman line). Give my best to Peg, to whom "coraggio" on the thesis. Best to you all David William Spanos (Lyon, France) to Robert Kroetsch (Binghamton), October 19, 1973. Dear Bob: I sent you back by surface mail the prose pieces by Brian Swann. I think we should seriously consider publishing some of them. It's really postmodern stuff. . . . The prose poem is indeed becoming a presence in my thinking about contemporary literature as you suggest. It just may be - for poetry - the postmodern form. Just as all the prose writers of the Modern period wanted to make poems out of their prose, so a lot of contemporary poets want to make prose out of their poetry. This is closely related, of course, to the oral impulse of postmodern American poetry: Logos as legein (speaking) rather than as The Word, as again Heidegger points the way. ... ... Your reference to getting Tarn and work about him into Vol. 3/2 and Antin's response to my compromise suggestion that we postpone his talk poem until Vol. 3/2 because it will work better with the Rothenberg material both open up the whole question of the contents of Vol. 3/2.... My impulse: 1) to make the Rothenberg-Antin thing central in that issue and 2) in reference to Antin's suggestion that there be "some 607</page><page sequence="14">other talk about these issues," to publish the editorial correspondence or an edited version of or developed statements from it. This kind of format would, I think, be tremendously interesting as such, simply because it addresses a crucial and very controversial postmodern issue as an open question; at the same time it would constitute a provocative breakthrough in academic journal editing. Let me know what you think, so I can get back to Antin and to Rothenberg.... What did you think of my article on Ritsos in The American Poetry Review? If and when we go to Greece I'm going to go all out to get an interview from him. He's never given one on principle. But the breakthrough in America for him might open him up. Anyway, it would be a great coup, I believe - and immensely important as a follow up to the big spread in APR. What do you think? Our baggage finally arrived after 7 weeks. Christ, what a relief for all of us. To celebrate, we're going back to Autun in Burgundy to look at the great 12th century sculptures by the master Gislebertus - the reclining Eve drives me wild - at the Cathedral of Autun, this time at a more leisurely pace. And after that we're going to splurge and have escargots, boeuf Bourguignon and Hospice de Beaune in some small country inn in the hinterlands of Burgundy. Bill P.S. We heard on BBC with dismay of Nixon's dismissal of Cox etc., and are immensely disturbed about what's in the offing. Is that man going to try to overthrow constitutional government? Where does the Army or rather the Pentagon stand on this? I hope the Congress stands en masse against this unbelievable act of contempt for democracy, but we're worried. William Spanos (Lyon, France) to David Antin (Solana Beach), October 21, 1973. Dear David: Bob Kroetsch will go along with the "compromise" I suggested to him, i.e., publishing your talk-poem in Vol. 3/2 (early fall, 1974). And though I would have included it in Vol. 2/3 had it been possible, I now really believe it belongs with the Rothenberg material. As a matter of fact I'm enthusiastic about the potential of a substantial section devoted to your and Rothenberg's entirely different kind of oral experiments in the context of the problematics of oral composition or composition for oral expression. So let's do it that way. I understand your concern about time, but in the long run I think it will benefit both you and us if we put the talk-poem in the context of this immensely crucial "postmodern" issue. If we published it in Vol. 2/3 it might simply get lost for most readers or what is more important made easy to dismiss. In the larger context both these possibilities would become more difficult. And I do want boundary 2 to serve the purpose of making the academic world 608</page><page sequence="15">take note of these new poetics that are emerging on the American scene. The phenomenological reduction by violence. If we should start moving in this direction, we've got to get in touch with Jerry Rothenberg. He already has a first series of questions. What I suggested - and as I've done in the Ignatow "interview" - is that he answer a few questions the first time around, which becomes the point of departure for further comment and questions until the thing "discovers" its own shape. Given the more certain focus that your work provides, I'd have to add a couple of basic questions to that original list. So your suggestion that you get in touch with Jerry sounds good. I'm also writing to let him know of this turn. Your suggestion that some other talk on these issues be included strikes me as being right. What immediately comes to mind - indeed, I suggested this to Kroetsch when I broached the compromise - is to publish the editorial correspondence, or edited versions of it, or statements based on the exchange (though my own impulse is that we simply publish the correspondence, including your letters both to me and to Kroetsch, for the sheer immediacy of the thing). This more than "statements" should provide a great context for "what am i doing here?" and at the same time, at least in a minimal sense, be in keeping with the oral theme. I also think that, as format, it will do something that most academic journals won't do. We're also including some sections from Nathaniel Tarn's "Lyrics for the Bride of God" and an essay being written by a young man who has done a movie based on Tarn's poetry. I'm wondering if he might not participate somehow in this section. Although his poetry is not oral-oriented, I see his late work as emerging out of the Olson Maximus poems and, on first reading, think he's trying to do something like Olson in his broken line. There's also his anthropology which relates him to Rothenberg. What are your feelings about this? Is it a possibility or do you think three poets would clutter the format and confuse this issue? ... Your brief but extremely provocative comments on Aristotle's poetics as a talk-poem follow up a section of my chapter on a postmodern hermeneutics based on Husserl's epoche and above all on Heidegger's interpretation of Logos (in the word "phenomenology") as legein, i.e., speech, which disintegrates the Western concept of FORM or PICTURE as basis of thinking (and ultimately of living, to say nothing about literary art) in favor of the speaking voice, which is to say, time and process. Heidegger, if I read his destruction (or as Derrida puts it "deconstruction") of the Western tradition right, would be enthusiastic about your insistence that Aristotle was doing a talk-poem. I also want very much to see your talk-poem retranslation of a part of Homer. Will you send me a xeroxed copy when or even before Alcheringa comes out? The story about the bedouin's reference to the "Roumi" is tremendous. What he says about the bedouin implies a kind of commitment to his ground that the Romios feels for his, which is the 609</page><page sequence="16">point about place/time/speech I make in my essay on Ritsos. It's ground out of which Ritsos' oral poetry flows.... My work progresses very slowly. But I think this book on temporal interpretation (as opposed to reading teleologically - from the end - which is how the New Critics and the Structuralists read - and murder poetry and fiction in the process) - is saying something at least worth hearing. So it's worth the agony of translating Husserl's and Heidegger's phenomenology into hermeneutics. Peg has just about finished her research on Sc ve and the Lyonnais Platonists and should start writing anyday. The kids really like being in French schools, and so should be fluent by the time the year is out. That's it. I look forward to hearing from you about Vol. 3/2. The sooner you get in touch with Jerry, the better. The sooner we pin the format down, the easier it will be to plan for that issue and the next couple to follow. Our best, Bill David Antin (La Jolla, California) to William Spanos (Lyon, France), October 24, 1973. Dear Bill: I thought I'd send you a copy of my latest "oral poem". The piece was done with Alcheringa in mind, and it is to appear there in the Winter issue. I had been meditating on the ambiguous commitment to the notion of the "primitive" that our self-designated "civilized" society has been involved with for so long. Back in the 2nd issue of Alcheringa Stanley Diamond proposed the unfashionable notion that despite its difficulty the idea of "primitivity" is the key term in anthropology and possibly in our own understanding of what is "wrong" with our own culture. Personally, I always felt uneasy about this gambit. First, because the idea of primitive is part of a binary distinction - a sort of axis or cut through the domain of meaning marked at its two poles as primitive-civilized - and it seems to me that the belief in the one commits you to the other. A dangerous idea and one I want no part of. Yet there is some reason for thinking of the rest of the world's career, which seems different from our somewhat eccentric one. In any event I was thinking about this - about Vico and his idea of the primitive "poetic nations" - stupid and emotional - and thinking it was this sort of reasoning that gave rise to the invention of "prose" as distinguished from "poetry", that gave rise also to the idea of "fact" as opposed to "fiction" (sometimes called "myth" sometimes "poetry") when it was not merely "a lie" - and just at this time I was invited to talk to a seminar on the "Sociology of Primitive Art" in what was intended to be a building housing all the social sciences and named after their spiritual father Giambattista Vico. So this oral poem. 610</page><page sequence="17">I'm interested to hear your take on it. By the way Clayton Eshleman is in Paris, and I'm not sure I gave you his address. It is 26 Rue des Abbesses, Paris. Hope things are well with you all and look forward to hearing from you. Best, David William Spanos (Lyon, France) to David Antin (Solana Beach), December 16, 1973. Dear David: I just finished reading the astonishing "talk-poem," "The Sociology of Art," you sent me a month or so ago. Whatever one might say about the length, the coherence, the point - and I suspect that you have had a lot said about these from my own response, i.e., from what you would call the "literal" and what I would call the spatial or iconic consciousness - there's no denying that it's a verbal periplus that opens up - dis-covers, in Heidegger's word - primordial meanings in art, understanding, language, and culture that the Western world has simply forgotten. All the way through, I couldn't help comparing not only the content but also and above all the medium as message with what Heidegger is doing in the late essays. Indeed, I sometimes felt that what you are doing in the talk poems is even closer to what he says about hermeneutics than what he himself achieves in practice, as brilliant and moving as that often is. (Incidentally, if you don't know his little book Gelassenheit, translated under the ridiculous title Discourse on Thinking, you must read it. I think there's a fantastic affinity between that voice and the one in "The Sociology of Art," despite the Germanic and American difference.) I got word from Rothenberg that he heard from you and that he'd like to do the interview for the Fall. Now I'm getting back to you for more of what you've got in mind. This is what I think we should include: 1) The Rothenberg "interview" (revised in the light of the new focus on the oral impulse in contemporary American poetry and your participation in this supplemental section) and some of his poetry as illustrative of the kinds of things he's doing. 2) Your talk-poem in the context of the editorial correspondence about it (Kroetsch's, mine, yours: Kroetsch has indicated willingness to play the role of the negative voice, though he'll want to spell out his position a little more fully). I'm reluctant to give the section too much shape, because I don't want to open ourselves to the criticism that the topic is too big and important to be contained inside the discussion and work of 2 poets. Still, I'm open to your suggestions. 611</page><page sequence="18">I've just about wound up the chapter on hermeneutics as discovery, which means that I'll be able to get to the other half-finished book on Postmodern literature by January. I'm pretty pleased with what finally came out of the long unintended haul with Husserl's and Heidegger's phenomenology: What it amounts to is literary interpretation based on the original meaning of logos as legein or speech and thus as dis-covery, periplus; not logos as Word or picture and thus as Euclidean space or Byzantine mosaic. Not adaequatio intellectus et rei, but dialogue. Bill David Antin (Solana Beach) to William Spanos (Lyon, France), December 25, 1973. Dear Bill: I'm quite comfortable with your recognition of relation between the talk-pieces and the Heidegger - the affinities are as you suspect more inherent than the result of reading. My familiarity with Heidegger does not extend beyond Sein und Zeit and some of the essays like Was ist Metaphysik? that I read perhaps 20 years ago. The later work I simply haven't read. I will surely look at Gelassenheit, which as you describe it sounds very reasonable, and reminds me of the strong feeling of sympathy I felt for Heidegger's mind back in my college days.... I do think we should plan out the issue. Your interview with Jerry and Jerry's own work lock down one whole side of the thing. It would, I think, be necessary for me to respond to some of the questions that you ask Jerry and that he comments on - because as you know, he and I, though surely related, have quite different angles of attack. I'm not sure how you want to handle this. You could probably formulate your questions in the light of this and perhaps respond yourself to Jerry's answers or/and invite comment from me as well. Let me know what you're thinking of here. Other figures that would make sense - It is, I think, necessary to get Dennis Tedlock into. the issue. First because of his own intrinsic importance in this arena, and second because he is a perfect bridge between Jerry and me. I am sending you a xerox of a lecture he presented to the Annual Meeting of the Organization of American Historians in the Spring of 1973. I love the piece and if it is available I would certainly urge its publication in the issue. If it's not I'm sure we could get something else from Dennis. Probably - if we are not to confuse things by pushing toward an anthology - we should stop the inclusions right there. Mainly because though there are numerous other poets and writers who participate in the point of view - their work has been labeled for other features and this would obscure things rather than throw light on the issue. I think this is the case with John Cage's "Lectures", Ginsberg's tape recorder poems, and Kerouac's "spontaneous writing". And though I 612</page><page sequence="19">would gladly be printed with all of these people, I'm afraid what would happen would be that Cage's interest in "chance", Ginsberg's "transcendental romanticism" and Kerouac's "demoticism", as the going cliches for dealing with these writers, would blur over the real issues. In a somewhat different vein Tarn's semi-spiritual exoticism and heavily literary tone would bury any relation. In Tedlock's case, things are quite different. First he doesn't have a label yet, and second, he is very directly involved in the same domain - the re-exploration of the oral domain, not only in the poem ritual, whatever, but in talked history and told story. Besides, I like his "cool". As for the letter exchange among the three of us, Bob Kroetsch, you and myself - I think that's fine. I have no objection to Kroetsch's refining and extending his position, though we might each want to see and comment on each other to some extent. I am a little less worried about the idea of overstructuring an issue in relation to two poets, because I don't really think that's what we're doing. Myself, I feel as if I am speaking for a whole way of being and working, hardly my own alone - as the "sociology of art" should indicate. I think jerry feels the same way, as his technicians of the sacred, shaking the pumpkin etc show. What happens is that jerry comes with his own word, advancing with an anthology of allies and friends, and I come advancing with provisional theory - mind constructs - attempting to recover or open up the old and the new terrain. It may be that you as well as Bob Kroetsch will want to comment more extensively than your letters (not merely on my work or Jerry's, but on the issues at stake). Best to all of you - "courage" to Peg with the dissertation, which she is probably enjoying now that she's into it. I've heard about the cost of living in Europe. Clayton is probably going to ditch Paris for some more provincial and cheaper hangout. He spoke of Wales recently. David David Antin (Solana Beach) to William Spanos (Lyon, France), April 6, 1974. Dear Bill Spanos: I'm glad to hear that Jerry is well at work on the questions for the interview. After reading over the questions I think that the best thing would be for me to stay out of the whole interview, because it would overcomplicate things for all of us. I have reservations about some of the questions - their relevance and pointedness - but I assume that you and Jerome can work that out between you. As you know I have very definitive positions about most of the things that you're talking about, but they are not shared wholly with anybody. All I can do to make myself clear is to continue to lay out my own line of vision. I'm content that the talk piece "what am i doing here?" will adequately open up some of my 613</page><page sequence="20">aktA~~In AL~ia~ oil ?, : j VTV- A9* t-:: td 1 ?~~% &gt; i $ -w a? ?

As I said, I feel comfortable in the context of Heidegger, though I feel less so in the context of David Ignatow, whose work I like but feel is very literary, totally framed, and therefore wonderfully old fashioned. It has less than nothing to do with me. I feel fairly similarly about Tarn - whose work I rather enjoy - but find so distinctively "literary" that it seems terribly remote and so on. The reason I wanted to include the piece by Tedlock is that his "lecture" is also a didactic poem that is not in itself obviously "poetic". About the interplay of correspondence concerning the talking pieces, I think it would be a good idea, but I would also like to add comments in return. If you and Bob Kroetsch would like to assemble a series of letters that you have and xerox them so that we all have copies, perhaps we could then begin to see what we would all want to add. ... I would be happy to write specifically either in response to Kroetsch or to you in letter form, expanding what I find at stake in the domain, which is very different from Jerry's though there is a significant overlap. This is the best I can do at the moment. If I reach Tedlock I will write you immediately. Best to both of you David *1 am at the moment working on finishing the typescript for yet another talking piece "is this the right place?" which is to appear in the next New Directions annual (NO. 29, which is I think scheduled for Fall publication). It is now definite that New Directions will be doing a whole book of the talk pieces (about 12 or so), which I hope to put in their hands complete by the beginning of summer. I will be supervising the "typesetting" here - a special typewriter composition that can be photographed directly - to avoid the appearance of the Gutenberg printed page. That is how strong my commitment is to insisting that a text is a "notation" not more or less. Jay Laughlin is apparently willing to go all the way on it, a fact for which I am very grateful.... William Spanos (Lyon, France) to Robert Kroetsch (Binghamton), April 26, 1974. Dear Bob: I just got a letter from David Antin in response to my question as to the role he wants to play in the interview I'm doing with Rothenberg. He says it would be better simply to do the thing that we suggested earlier, i.e., "the interplay of correspondence concerning the talking piece." I quote him: "I think it would be a good idea, but I would also like to add comments in return. If you and Bob Kroetsch would like to assemble a series of letters that you have and xerox them so that we all have copies, perhaps we could begin to see what we would all want to add." Since the 616</page><page sequence="23">project might get complicated, he thinks, and I agree, that we should get going on it quickly. So, do you still want to go through with the project? If you're willing, why don't you amplify your reservations and xerox the package and send copies as soon as possible to me and to Antin. If not, I'd appreciate hearing from you, so I can work out a different format with Antin. Time is now becoming important. Needless to say, I hope you'll decide to do it. The reservations - which are very real ones - have to get made somehow or other. I'm with you on that matter. Bill P.S. Also, New Directions, No. 29, is publishing a talk piece in the Fall, and has scheduled a whole book (12 pieces) for the next year or shortly after. So one way or another we can't lose by doing the talk piece, even if you think it's a crime against writing. Robert Kroetsch (Binghamton) to William Spanos (Lyon, France), May 4, 1974. Dear Bill: . . . You make a very good case for Antin. It's my ears that go on resisting. I still can't hear his significance. But I'll go on trying. Bob William Spanos (Lyon, France) to Robert Kroetsch (Binghamton), May 17, 1974. Dear Bob: I'm up to my ears in getting the mss. of my book (about 550 pages) into shape to send off to Pawlikowski for typing. (I've sent him the Preface and two chapters, another is about ready to go and with luck the last three will be out in about a week and a half). Anyway, this is going to be short. One question then I'll answer yours: Mine: and very important. What about the Antin correspondence I asked you about a couple of letters ago? Are you willing to make a statement? and if so can you xerox copies of the works for both Antin and me so we can decide where we go from there? I'd like to be able to get that settled before I leave here for Greece (a visit I'm very anxious about) i.e., precisely how the Antin materials are going to be presented. I think there ought to be something by way of justification, not only to orient our readers to what he's doing, but also to focus what clearly is a tremendously exciting impulse in modern American poetry, even if one doesn't happen to care how Antin himself is pursuing it. I also think we need the contrast with the antithetical kind of oral poetry that Rothenberg is interested in. (By the way, Dennis Tedlock [Alcheringal is sending us a piece on oral poetry in an American Indian context.) I hope you'll develop your argument, but one way or another, we should decide soon. Antin is waiting to hear from us. Rothenberg has sent me some 617</page><page sequence="24">responses to my questions - on the basis of these, especially a tendency of his to let the visual/visionary usurp the oral/existential, I think the "interview" is going to be really good, i.e., provocative as hell. As ever, Bill Robert Kroetsch (Binghamton) to William Spanos (Lyon, France), May 20, 1974. Dear Bill, ... About Antin. I'm having a battle within myself on the subject - thus my wavering and my silence. As you know, I go on looking for a way to write a long poem. Antin is, as you say, onto something. I want to put down my responses. Should I begin by responding to some of your remarks? . . This task is hugely difficult for me, because where I am as a writer is on the line. I can certainly agree with Antin that, "if Robert Lowell is a poet i dont want to be a poet." But to go from that failed sophistication to Antin's own kind of naivete is to throw out the baby with the bath. Where then is the ground; what then is imagination? Okay, you bastards. Let's talk. Bob David Antin (Solana Beach) to William Spanos (Lyon, France), May 27, 1974. Dear Bill: I just got the notice that your double Olson-issue came out and am in the process of ordering a copy. I guess that clears the decks for your next issue. At this point I'm still a little unclear about where you are with Jerry's interview, though I gather it's been in progress for a while. Because of this I have some questions about the target time for the oral/literal issue. I suppose you'll have a piece from Dennis within a couple of weeks. He's finishing up the term out there in boston and will be clearing his decks right after that. So you should have his piece fairly soon. I just spoke to Barry Alpert - the publisher of VORT - a magazine or periodical archive that has been doing interviews with selected poets and publishing discussion of their work etc. so far he has done Ed Dorn, Tom Raworth, Ted Berrigan, Anselm Hollo, David Bromige, Ken Irby, Fielding Dawson, and Jonathon Williams. forthcoming are issues on Robert Kelly, David Meltzer and Jack Hirschman, Jackson Mac Low, Armand Schwerner, Jerry Rothenberg and me etc. In talking about boundary 2 we discussed the oral poetry issue and he suggested that perhaps you might be interested in a piece by him on Bucky Fuller, John Cage and me - specifically from the point of view of the "oral" - postmodernist propositions considered from three overlapping but 618</page><page sequence="25">different points of view. The idea seemed a very good one to me - because i share your feeling that we should extend beyond a discussion of two poets, particularly where something so fundamental is concerned, and secondly it throws some more light on different aspects of the secular parts of this viewpoint, where Jerry and Tedlock will tend to emphasize the ethnopoetic broad cultural base. What I did was suggest that Barry write to you and find out what your publishing deadlines seem to be. Naturally accepting or rejecting the piece will be up to you and based on its merits. I dont know whether I mentioned it or not, but New Directions is going to publish a book of talking pieces - the book to contain anywhere from 8 to 12 pieces will probably take over 300 pages - to be called talking at the boundaries. New Directions hopes to bring the book out by the Spring or, at the latest, Fall 1975. So III have to deliver the whole manuscript in perfect form by september. This seems very rapid, but I will be supervising the "typesetting" - which will be done on an IBM machine - either a COMPOSER or EXECUTIVE. I have to take charge of that because I have to violate the right and left margins and no typesetter in the world will produce a ragged left margin. I assume that it would probably be useful also if I set up the type for your piece in boundary 2 as well - because putting it into the appropriate and requisite form will probably drive your typists crazy. But you'll have to let me know when you get to that point what you want to do about that. Im enclosing a long piece - a critical piece I did for a recent issue of OCCIDENT that I think youll be interested in. the editors of OCCIDENT were very taken by the piece in boundary 2, which seems to keep drawing comments, and wanted me to go on with the piece - or more specifically they wanted me to make detailed comments on a number of issues raised by the piece. They asked me a number of questions and I responded by writing about 50 pages of answer. So the piece is something of a clarification of the boundary 2 piece. It should also throw light on where I think the world is moving and should move. Im glad to hear that your grueling tasks are more or less done. david Robert Kroetsch (Binghamton) to William Spanos (Lyon, France), June 3, 1974. Dear Bill: ... Antin: I've got our letters together, with the exception of his rather good justification of the poem - which I sent on to you. I'm trying to make sense of my own stand.... Williams, for me, is still the core poet. Rothenberg is exploring something related to that core, yet something that Williams sort of missed. Olson, for all the hullabaloo, comes damned close to being a (long and 619</page><page sequence="26">almost beautiful) footnote to Williams; Roethke, that root-seeing madman in the green(mad)house, knew the sex that Olson, apparently, hadn't heard about. Stevens I read because inside his poems I myself go mad and can't stop reading. Nichol and Dorn I read for new pleasures. It's possible that good criticism should self-destruct. It should emerge into the work of art. The growth into origins. Thus that eloquent cliche, a pregnant silence.... Bob Robert Kroetsch (Binghamton) to David Antin (Solana Beach), June 6, 1974. Dear David: What's the name for a 3-person dialogue - at any rate, here is the beginning. Should be rewarding - and a pleasure. Rushing to catch noon mail: and I must soon be off to Saskatchewan and a TB sanitorium become arts centre in the Qu'Appelle Valley. Sincerely, Bob Kroetsch David Antin (Solana Beach) to Robert Kroetsch (Binghamton), June 20, 1974. Dear Bob: I'm glad you feel like undertaking this three way talk (we could call it a "conversation") - first because the work - what I'm doing is at least in part aimed to engage in discourse with others - is an effort to get away from the sealed-in package that poetry is often treated as, which is I suppose one of my main quarrels with at least one conventional notion of "form", as a poetic container. And the desire to engage with the minds of "others" means to engage with at least some partially disagreeing or differently directed people. It's hard to believe that there would be any use in or possibility of talking to anyone who totally agreed with me. For what would we have to say? Or I suppose with anyone who totally disagreed with me. For on what basis could we possibly say it? But total agreement and total disagreement among human beings living in the same time and partially in the same part of the human universe seems unlikely. I'm also glad that you want to talk to these issues because you have your own artistic life at stake and therefore a real interest in the conversation - which an academic discourse never seems to have. Let's talk about it, and maybe since you've said less - to me anyway - about your ideas of the urgency of form or its dialectic with life and the moment and about your objections to my strategies or tactics as a poet - maybe you should talk first. 620</page><page sequence="27">- I'm sending you xeroxes of all the missing letters and some you haven't referred to DA to R. Kroetsch Sept. 18, 1973 DA to W. Spanos Sept. 18, 1973 DA to W. Spanos Oct. 7 W. Spanos to DA Oct. 21 DA to W. Spanos Oct. 24 W. Spanos to DA Dec. 16 DA to W. Spanos Dec. 25 This covers just about all the substantive communication around the ideas involved. My letter of Oct. 24 to Bill refers to a long talk-poem called "the sociology of art" that was initially performed (improvised) in the context of primitive art. The piece differs a little from some of the others in that after it was done I deliberately interpolated some smaller sections that were not in the original talk - cadenzas of a sort -. I'm sending the piece to you too. Don't feel obligated to read it. I merely attach it as background information to our talk. It will appear in a subsequent issue of Alcheringa flanked by discourse from various interested parties - anthropologists, poets etc. Once again, I'm glad you feel like talking, Bob, and right now I'd like to hear you speak. Best David Antin William Spanos (Cathar Country) to David Antin (Solana Beach), June 21, 1974. Dear David: Bob xeroxed the correspondence over "what am i doing here?" and sent it to me. I've added what I've got and am sending the package on to you under separate cover. Add the letters you've received from us and whatever you think is necessary to clarify your position (deleting anything you think is irrelevant) and send it back to Kroetsch for his summation. I'm going to be out of touch until about August 20 (we've decided to drive down to Greece, despite the fact that the mail I've been getting from Athens is being consistently opened), so I'll add my comments immediately on getting back to the U.S. Heidegger's Destruktion of the Logos of the Western metaphysical tradition and his dis-closure/dis-covery of its meaning as legein, i.e., speech articulated in time, continues to throw light (wrong metaphor) on your opened and explorative talk-poetry, your poetry as periplus: not as land looks on a map but as sea bord seen by men sailing. 621</page><page sequence="28">But I'm not sure you would sympathize with Heidegger's ontological concerns or at least with his emphasis on the ontological potentialities of talking. If there's anything that, as far as I'm concerned, bothers me about your talk-poems, it's precisely your tendency to keep the relationship between talking and Being at a too great, even imperceptible, distance. If Being isn't a presence in the process, what's the point? Surely we're talking about something a lot deeper than aesthetics even though the immediate subject is poetic language. As for the deadline, I'm still uncertain. The double Olson issue has set the whole process back by months, so that Vol. 2/3 (the "Ignatow" issue) won't be out until the middle or even end of this summer. Vol. 3/1, the issue on Canadian Poetry that Bob Kroetsch is editing, will be out in the fall or perhaps winter. This means that Vol. 3/2, the Oral Poetry issue, won't make it at least until December (I just got a note from Jerry telling me that he's simply been too deeply involved in readings - Rotterdam, Paris, London - to be able to meet the early deadline: June 1), which keeps the question of whether or not we can do the Oral Poetry issue before the one that will contain the Tarn materials very much alive. I do hope we can come out with the Oral Poetry issue first - I'm psychologically geared for it - and will assume that we will until all hope has been abandoned. So let's make August 30 absolutely the latest deadline - and count on getting the issue out by spring. (Dennis Tedlock sent us the piece you had sent me earlier as an example of the kind of thing he's doing: "Learning to Listen: Oral History as Poetry." Though it's a little self-consciously stylized for me, I think it will work very nicely into the issue we're discovering - and, like virtually everything else, ought to provoke interest, to use a neutral term. I wonder what his audience of historians thought of his performance. I've also heard from Alpert and am writing to ask him for the piece on Fuller, Cage, and Antin - though I don't want it in the interview form he suggests). That's it. You can get in touch with me in Greece by writing c/o our Greek editor, N.C. Germanacos/ 25 Aristodemou/ Athens, if we survive the border police: I'm told that the APR issue containing Romiosini and my essay on Ritsos is circulating in Athens. Best, Bill William Spanos (Binghamton) to David Antin (Solana Beach), September 5, 1974. Dear David: We just got back from Greece (where we spent some anxious - and exciting days). I've looked over the materials for the "Oral Poetry" issue and on the basis of what's here have decided with Kroetsch that we'd best postpone publication until the spring (April-May 1975). This should 622</page><page sequence="29">give us a chance to work on the Correspondence, the interview with Rothenberg (which has a very long way to go) and give Alpert a chance to finish his essay.... I'm writing hurriedly ... more later on the fantastic events we bore witness to - and almost participated in - in Hydra-Athens, Greece. Bill David Antin (Solana Beach) to William Spanos (Binghamton), September 15, 1974. Dear Bill, It's good to hear that you're all safely back in the country. Things in Greece sound even a little too exciting for comfort - for Americans anyway regardless of what side they're on. But I'd like to hear your version of what's happening there. All I've heard so far is the radio and a Greek student/of mine, who's there, but somewhat cautious - understandably - about committing much to the mails. Also - the idea of correspondence between here and Europe was probably a little unrealistic. The mail's bad enough here. So I suppose the Spring 75 date for the issue is probably much safer - or more precisely was unavoidable. I did hear from Bob Kroetsch just before he went off to work on his own things at some writers' colony for the summer, and he sounded quite anxious to get on with the correspondence. . ... If you like, I could in the meantime respond to your question of "ontology" and "Heidegger's Destruktion of the Logos" which on rereading I find extremely unsatisfactory. I have recently had a chance to read Gelassenheit, Holzwege, to reread (since college days) Was heisst Denken? and the Einfaihrung in die Metaphysik. It's no accident that he was a Nazi. It is not a secondary attribute of his mind, which I remember thinking it was - his sympathy for a contemptible, facile, inflated and trashy romanticism. But the infuriating certainty with which he produces out of an a priori pocket his totally banal reading of a Greek temple and a Van Gogh painting suggests that the method - the way - is nothing but a screen for a leisurely and novel walk through a well known park to a nineteenth century statue. I suppose its odd that it's his commentary on art I find most infuriating, but the banality is more naked there. You speak of periplus - well if thinking is travelling it's not on a track - laid down - over and over. Anyone who starts with "Being" as a goal has already reduced the possibility of travelling. He always it seems knew what Being was and could produce it from his hip pocket when necessary, and it came out of the earth of that "most philosophical country" (Germany) when it thought about Greece and about peasants. It is the Nazi speaking here "Was heisst Welt, wenn wir von der Weltverduesterung sprechen?," who answers with the arrogance of the Western conquerer, "Welt ist immer geistige Welt. Das Tier hat keine Welt, auch keine Unwelt." This could 623</page><page sequence="30">have been said by Descartes, by the technological users and manipulators. "The earth is yours to use. Use it." (So also the Bible and the Greek conquerors, The Lords of Achaea). Either the animals will have souls, and plants and maybe even the rocks, or whatever will pass for souls to the extent that we think we have them or there won't be any world. And then we'll have a very handy answer to Heidegger's question ". . . why isn't there just nothing?" Because there will be just nothing, and Heidegger's Westerners will see to that answer in their laboratories and their council chambers and their computer banks and their libraries. Because it turns out that Heidegger has no quarrel with the way we came, he just wants to stop at the day before yesterday. Lotsaluck. "How does it stand with the world?" is a terrific question until you find out what he means by "world". The trees aren't the world and the rocks aren't the world, and the cockroaches aren't the world, even the horses aren't the world, not even Arabian chargers, and not even all of the people are the world. But that had to figure. This is where domino theory applies. If you want to get anywhere special by walking, you don't do it on the Thruways not even on the country road. Roadways are not the basis of foot travel. I'm afraid its the same way with thinking. If we really are going to go about thinking, approaching thinking, we've got to get back to the kind of travelling it is. Is thinking a kind of discourse? I would suggest that it is. Its a way of going, sometimes by talking - though maybe not always. I would suggest that talking is a way of going - that sometimes - often - is thinking. You say "what am i doing here?" is about "poetic language." I say it isn't. Its about talking. Its about the value of claiming for poetry all of talking, not just special kinds of talking. It's "about" I say, but its not "about", its an entry of "talking" into a situation set up for a special kind of talking (called poetic) and a special subform of that, retalking (reading from earlier talking) - from a talk that may have been blocked from anything like its normal human occasion by being undertaken at a desk with a typewriter in an otherwise empty room. And this is a way of talking and poets have still managed to talk this way and have what they put down come out sometimes still as talking. But the trouble it cost them to do this - some of them had to use drugs or alcohol or some fantasy of excitement to provide a memory of occasion - all to provide the continuous pulse to utterance that a human discourse situation ought to provide without much effort. So we have stories of writer's block - did you ever hear of a talker's block -? If you've got something to say you say it, if you find yourself in a human situation that requires this talk and you're not somehow crippled by accident or inconvenience or distrust or fear. I still remember Kerouac saying in some novel to someone, who was I guess Randall Jarrell, that the only sense of form he wanted in his work was the form of a guy standing up in a bar and telling a story. You see its not a talking culture altogether and the liquor helps. But I'm not knocking spirits or even pills, though I personally don't care for them. Anyway, 624</page><page sequence="31">"what am i doing here?" was this talk in this special place, where I came to ask this question, "can't i find a way to justify my claim to a relationship to my friend (Jerome Rothenberg reading his poetry here) and your readiness to listen to the kind of talking you value because it is to the point of important things in an important way and call poetry - isn't this what im doing here - because i am a poet - a man talking in a way that makes things happen that i like to call thinking into and among important things - and im making it happen so that it could happen again differently, with more room, for myself and anybody else whos also a poet?" Okay. But you'll ask me what are important things? And I'll say as I said before that I want to know "how it stands with the world," which is why I once thought I was sympathetic to Heidegger. But I want to know "how it stands with the world," not the spiritual world, or not especially the "spiritual world." Because it was in that trip that came to a divide at that place that we lost too much world. Now you say if "Being isn't a presence what's the point?" And I don't really know how to answer that except to say that I can't imagine any valuable image for the term "Being" conceived as a presence. Maybe we shouldn't really talk about "Being." I mean just because we can form some kind of nominalization of a verb through a habit of our grammar, does that mean that it's worth examining as if it had a "denotation" in some remarkably absurd 17th century sense? Why don't we treat the term "being" as still a participle and let it be - ? Just because you can produce a name by a trick of grammar doesn't mean that anything will answer to it if you call. Bill, you mentioned also that you would prefer to have another essay to round out the material - give it more ground - and I think your idea is sound. I've given it some thought and it occurred to me that what would really give a sense of the scope of what we're talking about would be an essay that would take up the Parry and Lord discussion of ancient Greek material, maybe its Anglo-Saxon or Germanic correlates, the South Slavic guslar materials - the Byzantine Digenes Akritas also, and present a picture of the growing reading scene as it appeared in the coffee shops and bars of New York and San Francisco. (After all the tavern was the place of the guslar poet often enough, and this vast frequent reading scene changed the whole feeling for the relation of speech and talk and performance for a poetry that had been locked in a closet pretty much for most of this century - and the change didn't really begin till the late fifties. With all this you probably figure I'm kidding you and that there are no ten people who could do it. But I do have someone in mind. He's a scholar, and poet. A Greek (American Greek, but fluent in both ancient and modern Greek) who is a classical and medieval scholar - has a book published by Harvard University Press on the Goddess Natura. His concentration in scholarly work is essentially in medieval - He's also a poet, published by Black Sparrow Press - George Economou. George was in New York from the beginning of the reading scene in the coffee shops at the very start. He's an 625</page><page sequence="32">old friend of mine and of Jerry Rothenberg's and Paul Blackburn's and Robert Kelly's. George was an editor of Trobar also. He was in at the whole start of the readings at the Old Cafe Cino, the Seventh Street Coffee Shop, the 10th Street, the Deux Megots, the Metro, a veteran of all night readings at St. Marks in the Bouwerie - And he writes well. All I can say is that if he's willing to do the job, and I merely suggested the possibility and he seemed quite interested, he's about the only person I could think of who could cover the terrain - ancient - medieval and modern and have intelligent things to say about the whole business ... Yours, David William Spanos (Binghamton) to David Antin (Solana Beach), October 1, 1974. Dear David: I've written to Economou on your suggestion. Will you also drop him a note to verify our genuine interest? I'm buried, and don't have time to expand, but I do want to say that I intend shortly to call you on your attack on Heidegger, i.e. "his sympathy for a contemptible, facile, inflated and trashy romanticism." Best, Bill Robert Kroetsch (Binghamton) to David Antin (Solana Beach), Oct. 5, 1974. Dear David, Let me sound like a reactionary editor, and then sound no more: 1. The talk-poem is postmodern in one of the potentially negative dimensions of postmodern. That is, following upon the (necessary) collapse of the notion of "high art," it assumes that to write at all is somehow to create art. To justify this assumption, you have to negate imagination. I see your connection with the later Coleridge, you, David Antin, as an inversion of and yet a recurrence of that Coleridge, but I cannot grant either of you my willing suspension of disbelief. 2. Your talk-poem becomes poem as pure content. It is not a solution to but an avoidance of the problem of form. In art I look for the tension of opposing forces: the form itself, and with it the force, the the energy within the form, that threatens to bust the form apart, kick it to pieces. Dialog as monolog sounds like paradox but in fact is evasion. I have on occasion managed to perceive the party bore as artist, but I usually go home early from such parties. 3. Your poetry as "uninterruptable discourse" is uninterruptable simply in the sense that a nervous lecturer is uninterruptable. Not a poetry 626</page><page sequence="33">of terror but a terror of poetry. It becomes, as in the case of the scientific language to which you refer, "totalitarian use of language." I choose to resist. 4. Your stance is a naive one. Naive in its avoidance of selection, in its concern with the pleasure of hearing one's own voice rather than one's language (another postmodern hazard). Naive, finally, again, in assuming that to talk about writing a poem is to write one (a modern convention deprived of its metaphoric intent). 5. I like your reckless recovery of narrative into poetry. The tattooed prick and the 200-dollar car are fine passages; the Coleridgean mask falls away and you do indeed "tell." Postmodern, at its best, restores to first place the temporality of language over the spatiality of image. Forget your Socrates. Remember your Homer. Sincerely, Robert Kroetsch David Antin (Solana Beach) to William Spanos (Binghamton), October 10, 1974. Dear Bill, Jerome's new address is 2928 No. Downer Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53211. He's at the University of Wisconsin, related in some capacity to the 20th Century Studies operation now being directed by Michel Benamou. He's apparently doing some sort of conference on Ethnopoetics for them and doing some sort of teaching or whatever. I just got Bob Kroetsch's note and looked it over. I'm sure I can write a fairly succinct response to some of the issues it raises, and then if he isn't in the mood to go further we can edit what we already have. I sent off a letter to George Economou as you asked, and though I haven't heard from him yet I'm fairly sure he'll come through with a piece. I just wrote him a few days ago, sent him some of the new talk pieces etc. He's been preparing a short piece on Jerry Rothenberg for the issue of VORT dealing with Jerry, so I think he'll be well honed to talk about the contexts of both contemporary and ancient materials. Respond to the Heidegger as you can, I would really like to hear your views on him. I was awfully disappointed on rereading him - to fall through the brilliant and amiable style to that commonplace ground. Look forward to hearing from you. Best, David David Antin (Solana Beach) to Robert Kroetsch (Binghamton), October 11, 1974. Dear Bob: In responding to your note I don't so much want to defend or explain a particular work of mine, which may or may not happen to 627</page><page sequence="34">engage you in a terrain of my choosing. And I certainly don't want to claim credit - or accept blame - for some remarkable and unique invention that we will use to characterize all of what we're calling "postmodernism". I'm willing to accept the term "postmodern" because I think that by the end of the 60's we had arrived at the end of a great paradigm - or research program if you like Lakatos' formulation better than Kuhn's - with a long and impressive history, and that what we are doing now seems to be conditioned by a very different view of how to proceed and with what to proceed. It may be that we are at one of those great discontinuities, and from either side of the rift the other seems hardly intelligible any more. For better or worse, I don't think of my "talk-poems" as very singular. They seem merely a sensible way to go on, given the uselessness and triviality of the genres that have distinguished poetry up to now. Maybe they weren't always trivial, but they certainly seem so now. You say the "talk-poem" becomes "poem as pure content" and I was almost tempted to say "yes", but I realized that I have no idea of what that would really mean. I mean I'm certain that what I'm doing is not a "poem as pure form," and I know that there was an idea deeply ingrained in most modernist art to aspire to a work that was "pure form". And I think that at first what I was doing in the talk-poems - or thought I was doing - was exploring the absurdity of that division of possibilities. I thought I would strip my poetry of every characteristic that could be taken as a formal consideration and that, regardless of that, the work would be as formal or as nonformal as any work that set out on the path to pure form.* Or that was at least one of my considerations - though hardly a major one. Afterwards - after I had done several talk pieces I realized that this was hardly the point - that I really didn't understand what people meant or used to mean by "form" or "formal considerations." Then the whole idea of "form" fell apart for me. There was absolutely nothing there to reject. Consider, what does it mean, the notion of "form" in a poem? - the idea of some arbitrary patterning, independent of what is usually thought of as "meaning". You talk of it as some kind of obstacle to your impulse to go on - as if you imagined yourself divided into a "revolutionary" (your forward impulse - your energy) and a "cop". What's that got to do with "form" and why would you call your uncertainty or your self-defeating impulses the "form"? Personally I don't feel especially divided, or not so dramatically divided, or not usually so. And I can imagine my impulse to speak, to move through language to some formulation, to some new place as being like a kind of walk. So say I'm walking out of my house and I have a general idea of *In fact Hugh Kenner did a piece on my work in VORT that takes up the "formal" properties very elegantly. 628</page><page sequence="35">going to the market, maybe because, among other things, I'd like some bacon for breakfast. And I start out the door and run into my neighbor, a very neat, nervous older woman who lives alone in a great big house over the water, and she stops me to ask if I noticed anyone sawing up pieces of her fence. She's an obstacle of sorts. Gives "form" to my walk. I can press on - hurry to disengage myself and get toward the bacon. I'm pretty hungry now. I haven't even had coffee, and her knee length fifties white skirt, which was made for ladies' lunches, is begi'nning to bug me a little. But she's very nervous and I feel sorry for her - hungry as I am. She's worried because she repaved her driveway, that the local surfers use when they're skateboarding down the street - it has a sharp slope and gives them a good start down the hill. And she had to put up a sign to tell them to keep off till the asphalt was dry, and because she really didn't like them using the driveway and didn't have the nerve to tell them to keep out, because she was afraid they would do something to revenge themselves on her if she offended them, she put up a timid sign warning them to please keep off the driveway for the rest of the week, till the asphalt was dry. And she knew that it didn't take more than a day or so for the asphalt to dry, and that some of them might have known this too, and did I think it was likely they were taking out their anger on her by cutting off pieces of her fence? And I didn't really think so, and told her. And then she couldn't figure out who would have made such clean cuts in her fence with a saw - except some seven year old would-be carpenters who lived up the street. And I thought that was more possible and promised to ask about it in a subtle way, because she didn't want to make enemies of the seven year olds either. Finally I got past her, but now she's a part of my walk, not merely the "form" of it; but she was a lot of its "content" - if you're going to admit these words. She was as much my walk as the bacon, which I don't remember anymore. So where does that get us - an obstacle appeared and became the work or part of the work. Mrs. Laurens walked into my walk. I had a choice and let her do it. Now you're going to be convinced that I'm negating "imagination" again. You're going to accuse me of assuming that "poetry" is merely "going on." Well I don't really know what "imagination" is either. Not Bacon's mediator between the senses and the understanding, nor Kant's, nor Coleridge's universal solvent. If you mean the kind of generative force of mind that moves out into the world, putting things together, taking them apart, standing them on their end, inventing and discovering, I have a fair idea of what you mean. And I don't suppose it's peculiar to poetry alone. Mathematicians have it, inventors have it, lots of others. But I suppose I take that ongoing impulse, von Humboldt's generative force of language, to be the center of poetry. And because I think we've gotten too far from the center, too far from the generative force of discourse as it forms itself in the mouth and mind, I'm willing to give up just about everything else to get it. Even some kinds of precision, 629</page><page sequence="36">which otherwise I value kind of highly. I mean I do respect the "form" of an arrow, its logical force, its penetrating power. But invention and refinement are not always the same thing, and you can't always have both of them. The retroflexed barb is not as important as the point, fine as it may be. I mean how did we invent the lever? Fighting? Playing? Making love? I'm really looking for the right situation for discovery and invention, and I'm more interested in looking and discovering than in convincing or explaining - certainly more than in entertaining. So the talks can be boring to anyone who isn't interested in looking into the domain I want to look into. It's not a party and I don't care to amuse anyone - especially - but I'm not shutting anyone out either. The "totalitarian" bit - ? - Well, I did say that poetry was "uninterruptable discourse", and I said it as I discovered that it was probably always at least as closed to conversation as science. Maybe all investigations are closed that way - the way narrative is closed to conversation until it's over. And it amused me to discover that science may be very authoritarian, but it listens to its challengers - when they challenge from the appropriate platform in the appropriate way - and it takes those charges into account. Sometimes I think that poetry hasn't taken anything into account for a very long time. In my work I'm trying also to bring it to account. You rs, David David Antin (Solana Beach) to William Spanos (Binghamton), October 12, 1974 (Columbus Day). Dear Bill: Here's a copy of the letter I wrote in response to Bob Kroetsch's piece. He may want to respond further - or you may want to take up on it - or both of you. That's up to you.... Have you heard from George Economou yet? Am also curious to know what your order of publication is for boundary 2. If you're aiming for June with our issue - which I think is a good idea - what precedes it on the agenda? And where are you with the preceding issue(s)? Best again David P.S. I enjoyed your Olson issue a lot, great range of material, variable in quality and insight and everything else, but I suspect that's inevitable in dealing with Olson. You've got to take it as it comes. In the end it's worth humoring the more or less absurd parts for the valuable parts. A really good job for a great vector in American poetry. **You might take a look at one of my "talk-pieces" in the recent New Directions annual No. 29, which just came out. 630</page><page sequence="37">William Spanos (Binghamton) to David Antin (Solana Beach), October 16, 1974. Dear David: Here are the galleys of "what am i doing here?" Our typesetter was uncertain about margins, among other things - and I wasn't around when it was sent to her. So what do we do? The "Ignatow issue" is out and I'm sending you a copy under separate cover.... I've heard from Jerry Rothenberg (who sent more "responses") and from George Economou, who will do the piece provided I can give him till spring to finish it. I said that if everything else is in by our deadline, January 21st, we could accomodate his essay as late as March 15th, though no longer after that. I hope he'll take the chance. From what he said about the possibilities, I think the piece should provide an authoritative context for the rest of the material. Best, Bill David Antin (Solana Beach) to William Spanos (Binghamton), November 7, 1974. Dear Bill: I've been sitting here for a couple of weeks with the galleys of "what am i doing here?" in front of me, wondering what to do and what's necessary or possible to do. I'm not a crank and I really hate finicky relations to appearances. So on the one hand it appalls me to say "do it over again!", knowing what a large quantity of time and concern and cost it would mean. On the other hand I hate the look of that straightjacketed right and left margin. It must have been something like four separate times that I've defined "prose" as "concrete poetry with justified margins" and I mean it. I devoted a very large part of my "essay" in OCCIDENT to an attack on the idea of "prose" - which has become a great obstacle to achieving anything at all in language. Mainly because it is a notational style that makes false claims for itself. In its origins what is it? Nothing but a notational style for discourse - talking - any kind of talking. But because of the accidents of printing - the rigid frame for holding type - and because of the rhetorical habits of the kinds of discourse then considered valuable enough to set in type, this notational system, which soon became conventionalized - associated with a number of casual conveniences of notation that became stereotyped in the 17th century: "paragraphing", "sentence initial capitalization" (originally only a mark of emphasis), along with a handful of hierarchically distributed quasigrammatical markers or logical markers ("colons" "semicolons" "commas" "periods" "exclamation points" "question marks"), which were often too precisely conceived for real human discourse (consider what the grammatical markers do to the sense of Beowulf or the Odyssey as they subject phrase 631</page><page sequence="38">grammar linkages to an orthography based on a fantasy of sentence grammar) - this notational system became an obstacle to the representation of real talk that it wasn't any longer capable of notating without "cleaning it up." Thus the appearance of a language nobody talks passed off as the "valued language," the "standard language of literature" - for which damn it and the literature that depends on it! - until we reconsider that "literature" as a mannerist freak - interesting mainly because of its mannerism - not because of its "high value". So this notation is value claiming, and now totally irrational when we're using typewriters and cold type methods that can be photographed as they are. Sure - justifying made sense if you had to lock type in, but nobody does that anymore. It costs too much to use that kind of printing. Besides the printers have priced themselves out of any interest in doing that kind of setting anyway. The idea of imitating it for photo-offset is like dressing a plumber in a grey flannel suit. Okay? That's how I feel about it. I don't want to wear a business suit because I don't teach my classes in one - I'm a goddam full Professor at a major University and I was Chairman of a Department and I never wore anything but jeans to teach my classes. It's another age. But you've got a real human problem that isn't merely a question of representations - however important they may be. I'll tell you what. I'll leave it to you. If we leave the text as is I want to put in a note explaining the accidents of the straightjacket; otherwise we've got to redo the whole thing. Whatever seems more reasonable or acceptable to you. I've just received the Ignatow Issue of boundary 2 and have read through it a couple of times. I want to think about it a little more before writing to you about it. I think it'll take a little effort to comment to you in a valuable way about it, because I'll have to do it in great detail. I think there are some problems in the method or the way you're using the method, but I'm not really sure what they are and I don't want to give you a mere top of the head reply. It does seem to me that there's a certain stiffness that interferes with the flow of the development of the ideas. Like it isn't coming out as one piece, so that interests get checked before they reach significant consequences. But it's not always the case and I don't really think that's an adequate description of what I mean. I'll write you a little later on about it. Waiting to hear from you. Best, David William Spanos (Binghamton) to David Antin (Solana Beach), November 14, 1974. Dear David: I am, of course, very sympathetic with your concern about the justified margins. The piece was put through - sort of accidentally - 632</page><page sequence="39">before I returned to campus this fall, and the typesetter simply went more or less on her own. We've reset the piece. But there is a problem. Your lines run longer than what our page can take, so we don't know how to make the break at the end of each line. One way out of this is to print your piece (as in the accompanying rough example) lengthwise rather than according to the normal way. The other is to ask you to retype it so that your lines can be fit into the normal margins. For convenience, if for no other reason, we'd prefer to do it according to the enclosed example. But if you prefer the other possibility, we'll do it that way. What is crucial is that we have your adjusted version back by January 1. I've gone through the correspondence, editing it in the process, and have found it interesting not only in terms of the central issue, i.e., "what am i doing here?" but also of the development of this number of boundary 2. We began vaguely with an editorial conflict concerning your piece and in the process we discovered the issue on the oral impulse in contemporary poetry, i.e., something we knew - but did not know - from the beginning. The correspondence is, in a way, a periplus of the ground we have traversed in the last year or so. Maybe this is the way academic journals ought to get edited. I'm working on a brief "response" to your reading of Heidegger, which I hope you'll react to. I also want to ask you one or two questions about your understanding of the oral impulse which the correspondence hasn't as yet brought out. Let me know what you decide about the format of your piece as soon as possible. As ever, Bill P.S. Do you have any suggestions on illustrating this issue (graphics of one kind or another)? William Spanos (Binghamton) to David Antin (Solana Beach), November 25, 1974. Dear David: I think the emphasis you put on Heidegger's invocation of a Greek Temple, Van Gogh's painting of a pair of peasant's shoes, and his walk through "a track - laid down - over and over," has really gotten in the way of your reading him accurately - and sympathetically. The misreading or rather, the failure to respond to what's exciting in Heidegger - and, I still insist, to recognize what I also hear in the voice of your talk-poems - reaches its definition if I understand you rightly in your concluding remarks about Heidegger, where you say: I can't imagine any valuable image for the term "Being" conceived as a presence. Maybe we shouldn't really talk 633</page><page sequence="40">about "Being". I mean just because we can form some kind of nominalization of a verb through a habit of our grammar, does that mean that it's worth examining as if it had a "denotation" in some remarkably absurd 17th century sense? Why don't we treat the term "being" as still a participle and let it be - ? Just because you can produce a name by a trick of grammar doesn't mean that anything will answer to it if you call. The fact is that it's precisely Heidegger's purpose to recover be-ing from Being in the nominalized sense, i.e., as Telos, or Logos, or Presence: as Omega, the "still point in the turning world." That is, to be more specific, it is precisely Heidegger's aim to dis-cover the temporality of the word, of "being", that has been buried - and in the process forgotten - by the Western spatial consciousness, the coercive consciousness that perceives and understands experience meta-ta-physika, from the end and thus from above things-as-they-are, hoveringly, as Kierkegaard would say. As I see it, Heidegger's distinction between perceiving (seeing) experience from the end ("metaphysically") and experiencing it from the beginning (existentially) has its necessary counterpart in language in the distinction between writing or print (the Gutenberg dispensation) and speech, and in literature, between the closed or teleological forms of the Western literary tradition whether linear (the beginning, middle, and end of the "positivist" tradition) or bounded and self-contained (the inclusive circle of the symbolist-mythic tradition) and the open and oral "forms" of pre- and post-literate cultures. In this sense, oral expression is a dis-covering of being or, better, an opening up of the language shaped by our traditional perspective - our Platonic "eye" - a dis-closing in other words, of what our traditional "visual" orientation towards language closes off - from the ear. So real traveling in our time (which, incidentally, Heidegger calls "die Zeit des Weltbildes": the time of the world picture) is precisely on "a track - laid down - over and over," i.e., where the habit of spatial thought has neutralized, has at-homed, the disturbing and recalcitrant unpredictability of the energies of time (the new) by coercing them into a graspable image of "allatonceness." (Keats puts this as an "irritable reaching after fact or reason.") Providing one enters into the hermeneutic circle in the right way: begins from the beginning rather than from the end; intuits Being (the Word) not as preconceived goal (a super-object) but as existential process (words or oral expression), his process, his speech. Providing, that is, one lets being be. What Charles Olson says about the modern Western mind in juxtaposing Heraclitus' aphorism "Man is estranged from that with which he is most familiar" and Keats's definition of Negative Capability is virtually what Heidegger means in distinguishing "meditative" and "calculative" thought: we must be generous (the 634</page><page sequence="41">etymology here is absolutely to the point) before "being" rather than trying "to take hold of it," to master it. As in Olson, especially evident in "The Human Universe," this ultimately means that speech is ontologically prior to metaphysical thought. It's no accident that Heidegger begins Sein und Zeit by rejecting the traditional interpretation of man as qcWov X yov ,eXov - as "The animal possessing reason" - in favor of "that living being whose Being is essentially determined by the potentiality for talking." I can't account for Heidegger's flirtation with Nazism (though I think the degree has been greatly exaggerated, to the point where it has become an obstacle to understanding him). But I am utterly convinced that his phenomenological ontology does not mirror a totalitarian mind. On the contrary, in being contra spatial perception, contra metaphysics, he is agairst totalizing on every level of being. GENEROSITY: that's the impulse that lies behind Heidegger's interpretation of man as a talking being and his Destruktion, his efforts to dis-cover the truth('aX O cla: "bringing out of hiddenness or forgottenness") on the "well-trod" path. That's what I hear in Olson's poetry. And that, even moreso in a sense, is what I hear in "what am i doing here?" How else is one to interpret your reply to Bob Kroetsch's caveat against its "formlessness" ("Your talk-poem becomes poem as pure content"): And I can imagine my impulse to speak, to move through language to some formulation, to some new place as being like a kind of walk. So say I'm walking out of my house and I have a general idea of going to the market because, among other things, I'd like some bacon for breakfast. And I start out of the door and run into my neighbor, a very neat, nervous older woman who lives alone in a great big house over the water, and she stops me to ask if I noticed anyone sawing up pieces of her fence. She's an obstacle of sorts. Gives "form" to my walk. I can press on - hurry to disengage myself and get toward the bacon. I'm pretty hungry now. I haven't even had coffee, and her knee length fifties skirt, which was made for ladies' lunches, is beginning to bug me a little. But she's very nervous and I feel sorry for her - hungry as I am. She's worried because . . . [a cold-blooded deletion I feel guilty for making] Finally I got past her, but now she's part of my walk, not merely the "form" of it; she was a lot of its "content" - if you're going to admit these words. She was as much my walk as the bacon, which I don't remember anymore. So where does that get us - an obstacle appeared and became the work or part of the work. Mrs. Laurens walked into my walk. I had a choice and let her do it. 635</page><page sequence="42">zAT A,_N FI AL HI It cot, A $ $1 $4 -- ifi N&lt; 4 RO- - 0 c or LD i~~i:i-,-,ii: :_i-:i.0" T H IL::: -: :: -- Iff A&amp;-_:::: ::: o' f ii:~iiivt 1,i-</page><page sequence="43">ATL Ia n J ORT TUH ART LR4 .

Homo Viator, Juan de la Cosa, in the technological polis, where everything - on the surface - is tranquil and familiar. Anyway, it's the search for this kind of truth, which you undertake interestedly and at great risk, that I admire and, when it's happening, I find very exciting. You're not hearing Heidegger, David. Sincerely, Bill William Spanos (Binghamton) to David Antin (Solana Beach), December 10, 1974. Dear David: In thinking about the concluding sentence in my last letter, it occurred to me that maybe what I finally mean by saying you're not "hearing" Heidegger is this: that, in claiming the priority of speech (oral expression over "writing" or "print") you're not willing, at least theoretically, to go the whole existential route, to acknowledge, in other words, that this "literary" priority has its ultimate ground in the ontological priority of temporality over Form (Nature with a capital N) in human experience. I notice, for example, that in your letters and in your articles on "postmodernism" in boundary 2 and Occident, if not in your talk-poems, your commitment to oral expression doesn't insist on - in fact, doesn't refer to - this relationship. And this impression is strengthened by your consistent use of a plastic model (collage) rather than a verbal model to characterize the aesthetics of the "postmodern" impulse in modern American poetry - which strikes me as a contradiction, if "postmodern" has anything to do with oral expression. Words, after all, are radically temporal, especially if they're the words of a speech act, i.e., of man-in-situation. (I'm wondering too if this isn't what Bob Kroetsch ultimately means when he tells you to "forget your Socrates [the platonic Socrates] . Remember your Homer.") On the other hand, if I were to epitomize the difference between your talk-poetry and Jerry Rothenberg's understanding of oral poetry, I would say that his is oriented towards the timeless formal patterns (what I would call spatial forms) of collective ritual expression of mythic societies, whereas yours is oriented towards the temporal (time-ridden) openness of individual or existential speech: the interested speech of man-in-the-world, not man dreading, perhaps, but man-in-the-world nonetheless. What's your take on this comment? ... It was good talking on the phone last week - and hearing that boundary 2 is gaining a good audience on the West Coast. Achieving one has not teen easy, not simply because of our limited means, but also because there's still a pervasive suspicion of and resistance to the word "postmodernism" in and out of the academic world. I hate it too, but some one has got to start making meaningful discriminations in this new 638</page><page sequence="45">transitional moment in the modern period. The phenomenological reduction, the oral impulse, the open or anti-Aristotelian form, the rhythms of breathing: these, which were more or less marginal in the heyday of twentieth-century modernism, are now defining dimensions of the contemporary imagination. And we're almost into the twenty-first. I also appreciate your comments about the "Dialogue" with David Ignatow. I understand your reservations about the format, the stiffness of which (especially on my part) makes me feel uneasy too. Perhaps on another occasion it might be better to begin with one rather than several questions as a means of activating the explorative dialogic process. Despite my uneasiness about the "written" format, however, I do believe that we come closer to authentic dialogue in it than most interviews in the oral format, in which the questioner is simply a means to trigger off-the-cuff comments on extremely difficult issues. In these it's usually not the idea or issue in question but the image of the person questioned that's the center of hermeneutic concern. The interview, in other words, becomes a monologue. And because of this failure of dialogue, the image generated is - must be - fundamentally inauthentic. Nothing is called into question. At least that's the distinct impression I've gotten from most of the interviews I've read. I look forward to hearing from you. Sincerely, Bill David Antin (Solana Beach) to William Spanos (Binghamton), December 17, 1974. Dear Bill: It seems to me that your second letter really confuses a few of the issues of my criticism with my fundamental rejection of Heidegger, and they have very little to do with each other. So I think I should try to clarify this a bit, though I'm really more interested in the issue of Heidegger than in going over, what is for me, old ground. About "collage" - I never used it to characterize a "postmodern impulse". It is the characteristic strategy, or rather tactic, of early 20th century modernism. And to the extent that poets I would suppose share "postmodern impulses" tend to employ some form of it, that is the extent to which they maintain a real connection with some of the impulses of earlier modernism. I don't think there is anything unusual about this. It doesn't diminish the work of Olson, or the earlier Ashbery, or Jerome Rothenberg, or Jackson Mac Low, or for that matter the work of Godard and Resnais, that they have continued to be able to develop and transform this methodology. And it's also important to understand that collage as they employ it or employed it has nothing to do with "spatial models". After all we're not talking about papiers collds (arrangements of pasted down paper), we're talking about collage, which is an organizational 639</page><page sequence="46">principle that thoroughly radicalized modern art. This is the notion of putting or bringing together things and pieces of things, of splicing and superimposing, whatever. It's main force derives from its avoidance or rejection of conventional syntaxes, which in the temporal arts usually mean something like conventional narration, and in the plastic ones, iconic representation. It's origins are Cubist (look at John Golding's book on Cubism, especially the section dealing with Picasso, Braque and Gris between 1912 and 1914; and you could look at Seitz on Assemblage): The invention of collage struck the most violent blow yet at traditional painting, and particularly at the idealized and romantic conception of the 'work of art' as the expression not only of technical skill but also almost of some absolute beauty. Now the Cubist painters were constructing works of art from odd bits of material - one might almost say from bits of rubbish - generally considered to have no esthetic value, and not even to serve any good or useful purpose.... Sabartes quotes Picasso as saying "we sought to express reality with materials we did not know how to handle, and which we prized precisely because we knew their help was not indispensable to us, that they were neither the best nor the most adequate." (Golding pp. 103-4) Maurice Raynal in his article on collage in the Section D'Or of 1912 pointed out that the artists' motivation toward collage had a lot to do with their distaste for photographic illusionism in painting (iconic representation) and that they preferred to substitute for a "copy" of an object a piece of the object itself. The implications of collage here consist of a drive toward a more radical kind of reference through probabilistic metonymies and synecdoches, through exemplification and so on. It also involves a strong inclination toward casualness of organization and matter - the use of cliches, junk whatever. It is not a "spatial" concern, not exclusively or primarily. And it was even more radicalized by the Dada and Futurist performance artists, the music concrete people, the experimental film-makers and the poets. If the outcome in two dimensional media looks as if the artist's concerns are fundamentally spatial it is only because the radical impulses of collage have often been interpreted trivially by many pleasant academic artists. The "two dimensions" of painting and "three dimensions" of sculpture are merely staging areas, theaters of operation, in which the assertion of two dimensionality or three dimensionality are themselves often special metonymies for notions of "literal reality" or "physical reality" or the "domain of art" or whatever in the various cases. Surely the sense of physical reality can't strike you as less primary or urgent than the notion of "temporality". I don't think the sense of the physical or even of presentness (whatever that is or however we should 640</page><page sequence="47">describe it or name it) follows a notion of time, except in a very abstract sense. And in that sense the notion of temporality and the notion of presentness would appear to be apprehended together, like the simultaneous apprehension of figure and ground. I have nothing against the notion of space as an apprehension of "presentness" - or "immediacy" if you like the term better. It's the notion of "form" I object to, which converts the apprehension of "space" as the immediate experience of the present into a sort of abstraction by geometricizing it. If a painting is big enough it will not be experienced as "bounded" and if it is disorganized enough it will not be experienced as "arranged". I may not be interested at the moment in painting at all, but I don't think the abstract notion of "space" is at all important in anything but academic painting. Now let me go on. I also don't believe that "collage" is in conflict with "discourse" or even with "oral" impulses, at least not necessarily. The main feature of collage is not a spatial reference but disjunction, discontinuity, and, ordinarily, plurality of parts. To me this seems neither for or against "speech". Some terrific conversationalists are disjunctive, discontinuous and so on. At the moment I really don't think of my work in terms of collage organization. I think of my "talk pieces" as organized by my sense of "address". Talking toward some one, some others, talking also toward some undiscovered but sensed goal, toward a kind of discovery. So the idea of "collage" doesn't seem useful to me right now. I don't sense myself as putting things, pieces of things next to each other, not even successively. And so I see myself rather as "going on" however I have to "go on," which may be disjunctively - I might have to cross a river or street, scale a wall, maybe begin over again - sort of. I tend occasionally to arrive at a kind of narrative, sometimes, out of the process of going on. I don't object to it. It seems right now that what I'm doing is trying to find the sources of discourse in talking, and this situates what we used to consider the more conventional representational forms of narration and representation back in their emergent and more provisional domain, where they signify differently than in the fixed genres. This seems different. Everything here seems less disjunctive than fluid. And it seems true that many of the artists I would call postmodern - though they make no formal renunciation of collage or even of certain still valuable modernist strategies - seem tempted toward a more fluid, less disjunctive, (more natural?) way of proceeding. John Ashbery mentioned to me once - about his earlier work - that he always assumed the fragments he had cut apart would some time start to come together and that when he was doing "Clepsydra" he really wanted to do a seamless piece (that built on what he had done before) but that went right on to the end. I suppose this is true of Resnais' Muriel, about Jerry Rothenberg's Poland, and a whole host of fairly recent work. I suppose the problem for you really resides in your intention to consider Olson "postmodern". Well, in some sense he is very firmly 641</page><page sequence="48">attached to the modernist strategies of disjunctive collage. I tend to see him as a fundamental and radical development of a modernism that was interrupted around 1928 or 29 and never achieved its full possibilities, though various artists like Tzara, Stein and others went on working away at it in relative isolation during the 30's, or at least without great notoriety. But there was a kind of picking up of pieces and going on that happened all over after the second World War was over. Which accounts for our enormous enthusiasm for John Cage and Gertrude Stein, who stand in relation to a great paradigm, at different stages of it, but both of whom continued and radicalized the possibilities of signification in our art. But Cage is, apparently, also, at the end of something, great artist that he is. And we have to go on - and are going on - differently, very differently. Well, I see that I've gone on at great length and I did want to address myself to the Heidegger, and I think maybe I should leave that for a second letter, because I do want to get this off to you. I will say one thing about the Heidegger here, though. I'm quite convinced that I "hear" him, the problem is I don't believe him. What I mean is that I don't think he goes far enough at all or, rather, I don't believe that he proceeds in the way he suggests he's proceeding. The trip is all very exciting, but he keeps arriving at all the same places. Now either he's not a good traveller (which I don't believe, because this is about equivalent to saying he isn't intelligent enough about making his way onward), or, which I do believe, he's merely dissembling a trip or supposing he's travelling while thoroughly prepared for all the places he's going to arrive at, the resting places, quite well aware of what he's going "to find". I just re-read Was heisst Denken? and was stunned by the seductiveness of the man's way of moving as I was infuriated by what revealed itself to be an increasingly arbitrary and banal set of alternative pathways. Gradually what he comes to call "thinking" begins to prevent nearly anything interesting from appearing - or perhaps I should say "anything" rather than "anything interesting" as thinking begins to evaporate in the discourse. It has all started to attenuate the moment he chooses the pathway of Das Bedenklichste in unserer bedenklichen Zeit ist, dass wir noch nicht denken. Which is not going on at all. It's something more like a Ruy Lopez, which will go on remorselessly following its well worn track. Pawn to King 4, Pawn to King 4, Knight to King Bishop 3, Knight to Queen Bishop 3. All we can hope for is that at one of the turning points that he'll choose a slightly less acceptable turn, a radical sacrifice, a dangerous pawn push. It's not much to hope for. That which requires to be thought? Really! And then it ends in a draw on the forty-fifth move. Terrific! I gave up chess about the same time I gave up Heidegger. 642</page><page sequence="49">When I referred to his National Socialist Politics I was less concerned with the details of his membership in Hitler's party than in the politics of nostalgia. Which is rather like a board game. And about as useful. About Bob Kroetsch's comment on Socrates and Homer - well, if it's a question of talking as the speech act of the man in the situation - Socrates fits the bill more thoroughly and easily than Homer. After all, both of them are improvisers, but Socrates was a lot more of an improviser than Homer, because he was under the pressure of dialogue-conversation - arbitrary intrusions of another consciousness. I don't want you to suppose I'm claiming the superiority of one over the other, but the formulaic and narrative aspects of Homer's rap are subject in only a rather subtle way to the pressures of his audience. This is true for me, and I suppose for all poets. Yet I can't help being dazzled by Plato's image of Socrates' great interruptable inventions, admitting objections and questions, alternate structures and continuing to build with and around them. Socrates is the poet I feel closer to. I'll let it go at this point and return to your question about the relations between my view of the "oral" tradition and Jerome's in my next letter - also perhaps in some greater detail to my objections to Heidegger - or certain kinds of Romanticism, which is about the same thing. Best to all of you. David David Antin (So/ana Beach) to William Spanos (Binghamton), January 1, 1975. Dear Bill: I've been looking at your last letter - particularly your formulation of the differences between Jerome and myself in our attitudes toward the "oral tradition" and I'd like to try to clarify what I think the situation is. Given your own existential concerns, which may be a little biasing, I think your appraisal of me is pretty reasonable. I'm a secularist. I don't give a damn about religion, I don't care about myth, and the idea of ritual leaves me cold. I mean, when I was in college I found out that I really liked the taste of cigarettes and I decided to take up smoking. So every week I used to buy myself a pack of Gaulois, with the intention of smoking them seriously. Maybe Monday morning I'd have one at breakfast over coffee, and then maybe another one at lunch. But then I'd forget to take one during a conversational coffee break in the afternoon, and I might not have another one till dinner. By Wednesday I'd leave the pack in my other shirt and remember it too late to take with me. By Thursday I'd forget that I had them at all, and by the end of the week I might have smoked five or six cigarettes and be left with a blue package of stale yellowed papers filled with loose shreds of dry tobacco that were 643</page><page sequence="50">completely unsmokeable. So in spite of my best intentions I had to give up smoking. I'm not even good at habits. Where does that leave us? I think that the idea of the "timeless formal patterns . .. of collective ritual expression" is ridiculous. And I'm still interested in what most people call primitive cultures - because I think that among them are some of the great software cultures of the earth. And while I have no bias in favor of tribes and tribalism - whatever that may be - probably the tribe is a colonial construction anyway - it gave the colonizer an organization he could deal with - even if he had to construct it - I have great respect for the preference for software over hardware, which you could call a preference for intelligence over brute force. So you see, what I'm interested in in these cultures is their intelligence - their inventiveness, their tact, and their good sense. The Australian desert people inhabit a territory where the rainfall is sporadic and sparse, but it is more sporadic than sparse. Yet it has relatively few large bodies of more or less permanent water that could outlast a dry season. The way they handled this situation . .. I shouldn't say "handled", because they didn't "handle" it, they tuned to it. Handling something is a hardware solution. You "take it in hand," "move something from here to there" by pushing or pulling or bending or breaking - it. That's not the only kind of technology. It's only what we've come to think of as technology. Brute technology. Technology of the conquerors. What you do here is dig a gaping hole in the earth and try to collect the runoff from the rainwater. And if it doesn't work, because the soil won't carry the water far enough, because you situated your reservoir in an inauspicious place, you dig another one - or else you change the slope of the land. You level hills, create new gradients, a whole new watershed - at whatever cost. This style of science never learns cost accounting - in human life or in the amount of resources it burns up for its limited success, which may not be a success anyway. The system of the Aswan dam. A kind of Vietnam war against the earth, which you may continue to lose but pretend to win anyway, because the one thing you have control of is the propaganda machine, which converts all overall failures into great images of local success. All right. This is the old science, and it's dying - but dying hard, with its fossil fuels and chemical fertilizers and bulldozers. Against that we have the native Australian system. They learn it - that the amount of water they get is enough - if they drink at the right places at the right time. It's a question of tempo. They program themselves. They begin by drinking their water at the most temporary of their waterholes. Shortly after the rains there are more of them, and they won't last too long. They preserve them as best they can from evaporation - by means of a rock roof covering - whatever. They drink these first and they work their way backward to the bigger and more permanent reservoirs only as the smaller ones dry up. For this they have to be mobile. But it is a moving 644</page><page sequence="51">culture. The people walked around a lot. They had to - to survive. You go to the places you have to. But walking around is what you do in that culture - among other things. Walkabout. You walk along the pathways. The famous pathways, where the great ones, the intelligent ones, the ones before you, went. You may want to call this religion. Walking around where the water's been. Looking over the places where the famous things happened. Where they learned the good things. How to proceed. I suppose you could call survival a ritual. But that's not what you usually mean by it. This system, this way of going has a lot to recommend it. But mainly intelligence and tact. It has a lot of things against it, and I don't know how necessary they are or contingent. I mean the dreadful relation of the Australian native culture to women, to the young. It isn't very nice. And they knew it. Sort of. They tell how they ripped off the great sisters, how they took control - basically for the old men. It puts a great premium on experience. Age. Which is only worth something if experience repeats itself. If the world (the earth) stays the same, and the animals keep coming and the rain. I'm not offering any briefs for any particular so-called primitive culture as such. They're all in disarray now anyway. After what we've done to the earth it may be very hard to work out a way to live on it. The particular knowledges of old wisdoms may not help us anymore. Most of these cultures didn't react too well to crises. Or at least it doesn't seem so. It's the intelligences, not their knowledges, we may have to learn from. How to proceed without shoving anything we don't have to. I was working once as an editor for a scientific publishing company and we published in English translation the Soviet Bulletin of Biology and Medicine; and I remember an experiment conducted by some Russian scientist to determine to what extent oxygen deprivation will inhibit the development of tuberculosis infection. To determine this the scientist innoculated several hundred mice and suffocated them in a sealed tube, to compare them with several hundred other mice similarly infected and executed differently - to serve as a control group. This is the science of a Cossack, and I suspect that many of my university colleagues will laugh with me at its vulgarity and crudity. But all they have to do is walk across the campus to their own Medical Building to find a junkyard of animal bodies "sacrificed" to a trivial and gross inquiry that could be conducted in n other ways if intelligence and tact were substituted for an institutionalized and mindless violence. The point is that we have to go from a science of pushing to a science of tuning. Becoming wary of hardware, which is often a storage problem or a garbage disposal problem. And a literary tradition - a literal tradition - is part of a hardware system and it has a great disposal problem. I mean it's all right to put up preserves - if you think you'll need to eat them, but they're not necessarily time capsules. And the conversion you need to transform food into preserves - the processes, the preservatives - may reduce the food to a ghost of itself. Frozen food. Birdseye peas. That may not last till you 645</page><page sequence="52">need them - the time that may never come, and you may not even care, because you've forgotten that there was such a thing as real vegetables after all. What is it Olson said about fishsticks? Still, I'm not a sentimentalist - I can see the point of freezing food, or canning or smoking it, but the point lies in retrieving what's been canned, frozen or smoked. And a taste for "literature" is like a taste for lox. Okay, but a little exotic. I like it. But you can't live on it. Now a lot of what's gone down as art in the West is pretty exotic, and the role of the tradition - the Western tradition imagined say by someone like Harold Bloom - is something like a continuous promotion for the food processing industry, which will tell you of the terrific virtues of BHA, monosodium glutamate, enriched white flour ... NO, Jerry isn't interested in "timeless formal patterns." He's interested in the recurrence of good sense, of energy, wherever people address themselves through language to the things that make them human or, better than that, to the things that make them part of the living community of the earth or the solar system. What we've been calling myth and ritual, or even religion in a lot of cases has no relation to what those crazy Christians would mean by those terms. I hope this addresses what you had in mind. Best, David William V. Spanos (Binghamton) to David Antin (Solana Beach), January 15, 1975. Dear David: ... The Rothenberg "interview" is almost done. Economou's essay will be done on time he says .... So we're in business. In fact, I think the issue should be very exciting, not only for what it's got in it, but for the way it got there. While I'm at it, let me pose my last question to you in response to your most recent letter. I can agree with you that Jerry is committed to the same kind of "ecological" values as those you articulate so movingly in your letter. But you don't really confront my distinction - at least not directly. There's a significant "formal" difference between the kind of poems Jerry writes and likes and your talk-poems. Doesn't that formal difference imply a significant epistemological difference? As ever, Bill P.S. I can't quite tell from your last letter how you interpret my attitude towards these matters. For the record, therefore, I do want to insist that I have no quarrel with your compelling assault on the ecology of the Western "literary" tradition. (My essay, "The Detective and the Boundary," in boundary 2 1/1, should make that clear.) You reject 646</page><page sequence="53">Mastery in favor of generosity - Manipulating the "world" as if it were an object in favor of letting it be. Or, as Charles Olson puts it for us: And what is the message? The message is a discrete or continuous sequence of measurable events distributed in time is the birth of air, is the birth of water, is a state between the origin and the end, between birth and the beginning of another fetid nest is change, presents no more than itself And the too strong grasping of it, when it is pressed together and condensed, loses it This very thing you are On the subject of Western hardware, I would only refer you to Heidegger's "Letter on Humanism" and, above all, to an absolutely related essay from Holzwege, "Die Zeit des Weltbildes" (the pun in the title of which suggests in what sense ours is the time of the triumph of technology). Where I think, we disagree or at least have different emphases is in what we mean by "generosity." I want to ground it more than you do in temporal existence/history/the tensions of (dialogic) encounter. David Antin (Solana Beach) to William Spanos (Binghamton), January 30, 1975. Dear Bill: Here's your letter dated June 21, 1974 (the xerox doesn't show the date). The letter is significant because my response to Heidegger was in great degree triggered by your question "If Being isn't a presence in the process, what's the point?" It started me out rereading Heidegger and realizing I felt quite hostile to him, and more hostile the more I read. But the disagreement here is not so much between you and me, as it is a disagreement about the implications of Heidegger. I was rather well aware from your piece in boundary 2 No. 1 of your own critical attitude toward the ecology of Western culture. And I was addressing my sense of our agreement in my attack on Heidegger, whose sense of nostalgia makes him 647</page><page sequence="54">I believe a dangerous friend. But I've made myself clear on that before, as clear as necessary at this time anyway, and the whole issue is hardly worth going over again. But I did want to address myself to your last comments on Jerry and me. You point to a difference between us - which is certainly real enough and I don't want to give the impression of minimizing it. You call it a "formal" difference, and I'd prefer to avoid that term, with it's implications of "form" as a kind of "mouldedness" which I've been rejecting all along. I'd rather speak of it as a difference of aspect, of inclination or stance. And you're right to insist on it. It's very evident, perhaps too evident, and easy to exaggerate the implications of. So I've tended to emphasize the connections that unite us, which are also real and significant, though not so evident to others, but perhaps more significant to us. And I think you're right to see the difference emerging from a difference of "epistemology", especially if you think of epistemology as rooted in experience and not as a technical term of a frozen philosophical tradition. 'elrtuTapat in Homer is to know how to proceed, to be skilled (in something) to know how (to work at it, how to go on). To believe the wood is so, the world is so, as much as we believe - Jerry and I - is not more than a way of working, or rather setting out to work - with some expectations that the grain runs - more or less - in a particular way with a particular habit - to have a habit of the hand that reaches out to handle things, matters, in a particular way because we reach - each of us - from a particular place with a particular hand toward the place we expect them to be, and where we are not dreadfully disappointed when they turn out not to be - exactly - there. Now Jerry and I move differently. I have a tendency to try to move straight forward - to start that way - but because there's often something of a wall in the way I'll often wind up moving sideways along it, but facing more or less in the direction I think I have to go, looking for an opening to get through. And I suspect Jerry of moving toward a similar place but starting out by walking backwards. Moving away from the things that he's leaving, because they turn out to be useless, or because they're valuable but he can't take them with him, or are maybe leaving him anyway and are only confusing, but keeping his eyes on them while backing toward the new terrain, which I suppose he only sees directly when it joins the rest behind him. Maybe because in his experience you can't approach anything directly and expect it to be there when you arrive. So he steps backward watching out and hoping - with caution and good luck - to fall through the right hole. If we get there, we get there different ways. But we have different bodies - of experience and doctrine - that lead to a different perception and habit. Look - a long time ago when we were in college we got summer jobs working for the Forestry Department in Idaho and we were going to set out hitchhiking together across the country. Now he'd never been across the country before and I was more experienced, and his family thought I 648</page><page sequence="55">was somehow - responsible. So just before we left I came up to visit his folks' place for dinner, maybe to give them a kind of assurance it was reasonable to do. And while most of us were in the kitchen his old Polish grandmother, who spoke not a word of English, sat staring glumly at the television set, which was doing some documentary on North Dakota. As I passed I noticed she had tears in her eyes so I asked her what was the matter, and she looked from me back to the television set as though surveying the whole country before her. She looked at me and shook her head, "a zoy fil goyim" ("so many gentiles"). That's one of the things he had to look back toward. On the other hand when I came back I had to stay with my mother a couple of days before I was able to get a new apartment. I was lying on the bed in her spare room that was in this Brooklyn housing project called the Vandervere Estates near Newkirk Avenue. The apartment was on the first floor and I heard a conversation between this kid, who was wearing a Davy Crockett cap and playing with a hula hoop, and his mother who was hustling him up the street toward the shopping. "Mama, mamma was Davy Crockett Jewish?" "No," she said, "but Dr. Salk is." New York and the '60s was in front of me, and Poland 1931 was in back of Jerry. But somehow we've been closing in on the same terrain. For a long time I thought it was more sensible to suppose we all speak a common language, to the degree that it's a language at all. Now I'm not so sure. I think this commonness of language may have been exaggerated. I mean by Lakoff and Ross and the rest of Chomsky's ambitious disciples, who've been trying to situate the language on a common substructure of logic. But the more I look at the way "meaning" operates - I suppose I should say "signification" - the less I'm inclined to believe it. I mean supposing you break down all signification into its components of "sense" and "reference" - I'm talking about the semantic components of language here of course. Even the domain of "reference", which should hardly be as problematic as the modes of "sense", seems to suggest that we each speak different but closely related languages, whose differences simply don't often get manifested because our common projects don't require a very precise match. Finally "reference" is not much more than pointing, and pointing has a lot of room in it for variation. Threading a needle together and driving a car in traffic make different demands for agreement about location in space. And what kind of common projects do we have where our differences come out? Two groups building a bridge from different sides of a river have to meet, and two people making love try to come together. And this is pretty extreme, but for lovers "together" is a domain with lots of room in it for different epistemologies. Besides, this is a time when we're finding out that there's been a great deal of exaggeration of our need to always come together - even fucking. So for two poets moving toward what looks like a common 649</page><page sequence="56">terrain, it seems there's even less need to come to a single place and a much greater need to recognize how much room there is in a world we hope to inhabit in common. I hope we've got everything together, and I'm looking forward to seeing the whole correspondence in a single piece. Best, David William Spanos (Binghamton) to David Antin (Solana Beach), February 5, 1975. Dear David: We've come to the end of our time, and we haven't found India. We're still - all three - on the way. Perhaps that's summary enough.
