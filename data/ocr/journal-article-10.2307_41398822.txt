<plain_text><page sequence="1">H ay d en Car ru th The Intentional Alligator RECENTLY k once called a polo young shirts, friend and offered told me me he a couldn't number wear of shirts, them the because kind k once called polo shirts, and told me he couldn't wear them because they had the image of an alligator fixed to the left front sector. "Too preppy," he said. "Why don't you take the alligator off?" I said. "Oh, I can't be bothered," he said. Or words to that effect. Now I have two principles that I stick to closely. One is never to buy any paper. The other is to buy as few articles of clothing as possible, usually nothing but underwear and socks. So much paper and clothing are floating around in the general environment, there for the taking, slightly used but perfectly functional, that my no doubt obsolete Yankee sense of thrift rebels at the thought of paying money for them. So I accepted the shirts. I wear them. And I think to myself, as old people do, that the young are too much influenced by their reflexive susceptibility to images, and also that they are too wasteful. Yet I am an artist and have been all my life. And art, considered from the producer's point of view, is based on the idea that images of all kinds can be used to elicit widely recognizable, efficacious, generally nonrational responses, and on the further idea that procedural efficiency is the last desideratum in the artist's modus operandi and that a large factor of wasted effort is not only unavoidable but probably advisable. The world knows, and endlessly points out, that consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds. The world also knows, but rarely any longer acknowledges- the best-kept secret being that which everyone guesses- that the human mind is a natural organ and that one of its natural func- tions is precisely the search for consistency, i.e., for a unified and hence more serviceable system of values. At any rate I am pestered by the very obvious inconsistency between what I approve as an artist and what I disapprove as a member of our consumerist, image-ridden society. Why? [MB]</page><page sequence="2">244 THE GEORGIA REVIEW Because I am a human being with a human mind, born to be pestered. And also because I see a direct historical development from the artistic or more broadly creative (to use a word I don't like) upsurge of the Renaissance to our own wastefulness and subverted imaginations. This is not the place to argue my historical view. Besides, I am confident that anyone who thinks about such matters, meaning anyone who is likely to be reading these words, agrees with my interpretation, in spite of all the exceptions and provisos that must be attached to it. What is important here is to resolve the inconsistency between what I believe as an artist and what I believe as a citizen. How? The answer is easy: by making qualitative judgments. But qualitative judgment im- mediately projects us into relativity, the practical need to say that one thing is "better" than another of the same kind. And to find and apply a consistent method of making such relative judgments is hard, dam- nably hard, as the whole evolution of human thought demonstrates with utter, dismaying clarity. Usually the search for a way to make consistently valid relative judgments has been conducted mentally- that is, by working backward in logic to basic and undisputed premises, which may then be used as criteria for judgments in the practical world. This is the way of Socrates, the philosopher's way, and it is also the way, though many of them would like to deny it, of social scientists. As a human being with a human mind, I cannot disavow it, although I can say with confidence that so far it has never worked. As an artist, however, I must disavow it be- cause I know that no criteria for judgment can be valid universally or anywhere near universally; that is, none can be discovered that has a sufficiently wide application to be useful in practice. Every judgment I have encountered, every judgment I myself have been inclined to make, can be refuted simply by visiting a museum or opening an anthology. Then how does one proceed? Let's begin with the alligator. The philosopher would say that the alligator is a spurious symbol of specious values, and he- or she- would argue backward through a sequence of propositions until some a priori criterion, such as human happiness or revealed truth, was reached, at which point the alligator could be shown to be logically and radically divergent. The artist cannot do this; he knows that art must be free and that prescriptions will not work. Art created in methodical accordance with prior tenets can never be new. On the contrary, it will be fixed: ultimately as repetitious, unimaginative, and hence essentially inartistic</page><page sequence="3">HAYDEN CARRUTH 245 as any ritual. The imagination is the part of the mind that seeks not certainty but surprise. The sociologist, on the other hand, would say that the alligator is symbolic of specious values because those values have been imposed rather than derived; that is, they have been invented by identifiable minds, those of the shirt manufacturers and their advertising agents, and have not been taken from the common fund of attitudes, which is the sociolo- gist's name for universal values. Moreover, the specious values of the alligator have been violently impressed, by the kind of force that is called persuasion, on the minds of the people who acknowledge it, whether by acceptance or by rejection. The artist may agree that this is indeed the case, but he cannot question the method as a method. He knows that particular images in particular works of art, even though they may be related (as Carl Jung pointed out) to certain prior and common and therefore archetypal clusters of human feeling, nevertheless take their particular power from the imaginations of the artists who have made use of them. In this sense they, like the alligator, have been imposed, not derived. They have been imposed by exactly the same persuasive violence, which in art we call aesthetic corresponsiveness, that we know is at the heart of all imaginative transactions. Yet every artist knows that the alligator is in fact a spurious symbol for specious values. How does he know? It is not enough to say that the alligator does not excite or move him, and that therefore it is not func- tionally aesthetic. The truth is that if he looks around at the world he will see very clearly that the alligator is effective, that huge numbers of people are affected by it. He may wish that his own poems or paintings could produce anything like as pervasive a response. Speaking for my- self, I'd be overcome with astonished gratification. So I don't think the artist can make an argument against the alligator on the basis of any notion of efficacy. It won't work. What else is left? The philosophical method (reason), the sociological method (empiricism), and the artistic method (aesthetic efficacy) are all denied to the artist, though this does not mean they aren't still useful in general. What remains is the human method. I call it this, not in an exclusion- ary sense, but simply because it seems to me more human than any of the others. It is the awareness of will. Schopenhauer said that the awareness of Will, which he liked to capitalize, is the one awareness that precedes all others in our consciousness. What we want is what we know best, in other words. I'm inclined to agree. And in respect to art and the</page><page sequence="4">246 THE GEORGIA REVIEW imagination, it seems to me that what we are aware of before anything else is the aspect of Will called intention. Awareness of intention is more human than other mental awarenesses because it is, as we say, intuitive. Schopenhauer said that it comes from understanding, as opposed to knowing and reasoning; a common enough observation. We cannot analyze our acts of intuition because we lack, so far, the means to distinguish the constituent actions that go into them, or even, if we could distinguish them, to measure them. Yet I believe we do intuitively recognize the intentions of nearly all works of art, to say nothing of human acts in general. Indeed, by virtue of the shape it takes to become a work of art, the work must announce its intention; it has no choice. The shape, considered functionally, is the intention. (By "shape" I mean the whole essence: not just form, but style, tone, pace, etc.) We recognize it, we understand it, and if we don't, then something is wrong with the work, i.e., it tries to be shapeless (though in the nature of things this is impossible) , or the intention itself is confused or mixed. As I said at the beginning, we are in the realm of relativity. Bor- derline cases exist where the intention, though clear, is multiple. I don't mean the layering of aesthetic effect intended by serious works of art such as Madame Bovary , for instance, which announces its intention within the first ten pages, so that one could, if one had the patience, define that intention, never with complete accuracy, but nevertheless with sufficient accuracy. Its aesthetic seriousness is never in doubt. The same with a hard-sell advertisement for a newfangled wrench on cable tv: it may induce a somewhat mixed effect (shock, indignation, greed, etc.), but its commercial seriousness is never in doubt. That is its clear intention. The intention of an advertisement for whiskey or perfume in The Neto Yorker , on the other hand, may quite distinctly mingle some aesthetic seriousness with its commercial seriousness. Even the alligator on the shirt, I suspect, was designed with a little more, even if only a minim, than a merely commercial intention. Why an alligator, incidentally? An alligator is "either of two broad- snouted crocodilians of the genus Alligator, found in the southeastern U.S. and eastern China." If I may say so, that does not have a hell of a lot to do with shirts. But isn't the point precisely that the effectiveness of images is in part a function of their arbitrariness? Not only Rimbaud knew this, but Homer. The truth is that the alligator is a more effective image than Smokey the Bear, as the Forest Service has discovered, just</page><page sequence="5">HAYDEN CARRUTH 247 because the bear does possess some apparent relationship to the meaning it is intended to convey. The impact of this particular image of the alli- gator on the human mind is uncluttered, and its lodgment in human memory is disconnected from all associations except the shirt. Anyone who has once come to know it will remember it always. This is what the advertising agency wanted, and all artists will recognize and accede to the technique. Beyond this, moreover, is the mysterious attraction of images of animals exerted upon the human imagination from far, far back. Aesop, the brothers Grimm, Disney, etc. Perhaps, as Clayton Eshleman suggests, this is a consequence of the original traumatic separa- tion of human consciousness from animal consciousness, e.g., in the caves of Lascaux. Further, our animal images are always distorted, either more terrifying or more cuddly than the animal itself, and usually they are anthropomorphic in some degree; this is as true in Galway Kinnell's "The Bear," for instance, as it is in "Goldilocks." Another friend of mine, a young woman, yesterday bought a new shirt in Urica, N.Y., and it has a purple horse embroidered on the pocket. I myself once went to the trouble of making a weathervane, instead of scrounging one from the numerous collections of junk in the region where I lived, because I wanted the silhouette of a crow and couldn't find one. And so on, and so on. What shall we say when the president gets on the tube to defend a policy that is nonsensical on the face of it? His intention is crystal clear to everyone, and it is fraudulent. If the act itself is not fraudulent, then the image is, though really I think any attempt to separate the two would be quibbling. What do I mean by fraudulence? The serious intention to deceive. And ninety-nine percent of the imagery imposed upon the human mind in our society today is seriously intended to deceive. The president, owing to his political power, may be the worst offender, but the fraudulence of politics and commerce is essentially the same and al- ways has been. It merely happens that in our technological era, commerce led the way in the exploitation of means, and politics learned from it. The effect is the same. Massive doles of fraudulence- images containing the serious intention to deceive- have damaged the collective sensibility, perhaps beyond hope of repair. Notice this, please. I do not say that people have actually been de- ceived or that therefore what they feel and think is wrong. In some measure this is probably true. But in larger measure, much larger, I think people have correctly understood intentions, and have perceived the</page><page sequence="6">248 THE GEORGIA REVIEW fraudulence without being able to deflect it. The result, more and more obvious, is a loss of faith in the power of any imagery whatever, whether visual, aural, or verbal, and not only in works of fraudulent intent but, by contagion, in works of serious aesthetic intent as well. The most criti- cal pollution from which we suffer may in the long run turn out to be not in our physical environment but in our emotional and valuational field, in which our civilization subsists just as our planet subsists in its gravitational field. At any rate the erosion of susceptibility to imaginative works is clear and clearly dangerous. We are a society apparently content to live in a condition of moral vacancy, without values, or with only ves- tigial and largely unexpressed values, because we know that the valu- ational images presented to us are intentionally fraudulent, and often enough intentionally inane. Some social critics say that we are complicitous in our own imagina- tive and valuational demise because we do not exert our own power to command an end of intentional fraudulence by refusing to look and listen. But to my mind this is unproven, to say the least. Has any people ever risen up en masse against a solely cultural oppression? If this were possible, then our entire system of public education, from bottom to top and from one end of the country to the other, would be terminated to- morrow. The great majority of us are aware that the intention of deceit is visible in our schools and universities in many and unmistakable ways. And our children, who are closest to it, are the most aware of all. Yet the system endures. For example, when I visited about a year ago the large elementary school my stepdaughter attends in Syracuse, I was fascinated by the number of times I saw the word "fun": on posters, signs, instruc- tion sheets, the daily mimeographed schedule, everywhere. The school was trying to sell education to the children, trying to compete with tv. But believe me, my stepdaughter is not that easily fooled, and she knows that much of what she is required to do in school is not only not fun, it is stupid. She and her classmates quite evidently react more strongly against public education than they would if the school dropped its deceitful advertising and let the education, such as it is, speak for itself. Further, at Syracuse University, where I have been teaching, the connection be- tween the university and the National Science Foundation and the Pen- tagon is clear and direct; the connection to the atrocious and archaic government in South Africa is only a shade less clear and direct. Similarly, the strongest pitch made to prospective students is that an education at Syracuse will increase their incomes later on. In the face of all this, tons</page><page sequence="7">HAYDEN CARRUTH 249 of flossy propaganda issue continually from the public-relations depart- ment in which humane learning for its own sake is made the primary reason for the institution's existence. Everyone- faculty, students, ad- ministrators, custodians, and alumni- knows this is a deceit. And although my personal experience in the academic trade is brief, I believe this deceit may be found almost everywhere, together with a tacit understanding concerning it- which becomes, in effect, an immense conspiracy of self- deceit. What utter folly! Maybe we should throw in the towel. Plenty of people think so. And it's true that where the evolution of collective sensibility is con- cerned, there seems to be a huge historical determinism at work that cannot be resisted: our whole cultural evolution, as I suggested at the beginning, from the early Renaissance to the present. I say "seems to be" because I am not convinced, one way or the other. As a practical matter, not a theoretical one, the question subsumes more factors, cultural, social, and even genetic, than I can hold in my mind at one time. But suppose resistance is impossible. Let's go out with clear heads. As long as our intuitions remain operative- though who knows what the psycho-engi- neers are planning?- we shall continue to be aware of fraudulent inten- tions in the images given to us in such massive doses that we cannot choose, individually, to reject more than a few of them. Life would be intolerable if we had to make a full act of rejection every time we saw a McDonald's arch, for instance. But at least we can keep ourselves receptive to images of serious imaginative and valuational intention wher- ever we happen to find them. This isn't easy. Plenty of professional artists, the status-seekers, are producing works whose intention is to be less than seriously aesthetic. But we know that we are aware of intention, truly aware, and that this is possibly the one element of our inherent freedom as human beings which cannot be taken from us. (Even the choice of suicide is more easily constrained.) Let us use all our intuitional power, which is great, to concentrate our awareness of intention, and to act, whenever we can, in accordance with that awareness. At least then we will understand what images are valid and which kinds of waste are humanly defensible.</page></plain_text>
