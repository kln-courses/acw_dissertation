<plain_text><page sequence="1">MARY BERGSTEIN The Dying Slave at Berggasse 19 In his introduction to 'The Moses of Michelangelo," Freud stated, "Works of art do exercise a powerful effect on me, especially those of literature and sculpture, less often of painting" (1914, 211). Sculpture, with all its ambivalence as a surrogate for the human body, and its uncanny potential for "coming to life," is at the heart of Sigmund Freud's writings about visual art. This is exemplified in his essay on Michelangelo's Moses as well as his interpretative study of Jensen's Gradiva. For Freud, who dealt on a daily basis with the soft, spectral material of memories and dreams, sculpture seemed to belong to a superior order of historical monumen tality. Malcolm Bowie, for instance, has stated that sculpture was for Freud "a fixed physical structure which, in its fixity, explains" (1987, 22-23). Sculpture may well possess the advan tage of fixity and durability, as another of Freud's favorite protagonists, Leonardo da Vinci, stated in his sixteenth-cen tury Treatise on Painting (1956, 42). But in Freud's visual imagination, sculpture was far from inanimate. A photograph, probably taken by one of his sons around 1912 (E. Freud et al. 1998, 200), portrays Freud seated on his veranda with a framed reproduction of The Healing of the Cripple and Raising of Tabitha from the fresco cycle of Saint Peter Healing (Brancacci Chapel, Florence) by Masolino and Masaccio above his head, and a reduced copy of Michelangelo's Dying Slave (Louvre) at his side (fig. 1). This photographic portrait was arranged casually; its visual structure reads like a snapshot. But as much as any classically inspired Renaissance portrait, it is meant to define the interior mind of the sitter by his association with certain venerable objects. The Healing of the Cripple and the miraculous Raising of Tabitha by the bearded Saint Peter may have been relevant to Freud in his role as a physician. But Michelangelo's sleeping tomb figure, or "Dying Slave" as he has come to be nicknamed, has an even more American Imago, Vol. 60, No. 1, 9-20. © 2003 by The Johns Hopkins University Press 9</page><page sequence="2">Figure 1.

The presence of Michelangelo's Slave represents one of the several ways that Freud used Michelangelo's sculptures in his search for self definition. The environment of Berggasse 19, dense not only with antiquities but also with plaster-casts, paintings, engrav ings, and illustrated books, constituted a kind of self-staging, a</page><page sequence="3">Mary Bergstein 11 Gesamtkunstwerk of deliberate self-representation. The habitat represented the man, which was typical of Freud's time and place (see Gronberg 2001). Within the casually parallel syntax of its two three-dimen sional figures (one living and the other plaster), the photo graph speaks in terms of the rhetoric both of the gaze and the pose. Freud's own gaze is outward, penetrating, and full of agency, an expression that Francesco Saverio Trincia (2000, 3 40) has denominated ulo sguardo di Freud," an attitude of particular intensity and observational power. This is juxta posed with the mental state of the somnolent, epicene statue, which is drawn inward, as though pulled irresistibly toward unconscious realms. The structure of Freud's photographic portrait calls to mind sixteenth-century paintings that showed Renaissance collectors with pieces of sculpture as personal attributes. These portraits, such as Lorenzo Lotto's magnificent Andrea Odoni (Hampton Court), Titian's Jacopo Strada (Vienna), andjacopo Palma il Giovane's Portrait of a Collector (Birmingham), use classical statuary to enhance the dignity and erudition of the subject (Franzoni 1984, 301-4). In the Portrait of facopo Strada (1567-68) by Titian, the distinguished antiquarian, regarding the viewer with a rare intensity, holds up a nude statue of Venus. The painted statue, especially in contrast with the dynamic attitude of the sitter, appears reticent and demure. Freud and his inner circle of friends almost certainly knew Titian's painting, as it hung in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. Steeped in the Greco-Roman classics, Freud received a classical education in a gymnasium under the auspices of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and traveled to Florence, Rome, Athens, and Pompeii. His library was filled with books on the archeology and art of the Renaissance and classical past, and later in life he confided to Stefan Zweig that he had read more books on archeology than psychology (Gay 1988, 171). Sculpture had a special place in Freud's intellectual formation—a place that was perplexing in terms of his Jewish identity. Jewish aniconic law prohibited figurative art, particu larly sculptured representations of the deity. The Hebrew tradition was fundamentally opposed to the institution of Greek athletic nudity and glorification of the naked body,</page><page sequence="4">12 The Dying Slave at Berggasse 19 whether in life (gymnasia, military events, athletic games) or in art (Bonfante 1989, 545-46, 563). This view is proclaimed in Jubilees 3:31 where the rabbis forbade the nudity and idolatry associated with Greek sport to the Jews: "They should cover their shame, and should not undress themselves as the Gen tiles [Greeks] uncover themselves" (quoted in Poliakoff 1987, 146). The photographic portrait of Freud with the idealized nude as an identifying attribute openly defies the Jewish prohibition against the lure of images, athletic beauty, and the anthropomorphism of divinity. With regard to Michelangelo's sculpture as a personal attribute, therefore, it is important to remember that Freud was a first-generation hellenized Jew; his parents were Ostjuden who emigrated from Galicia to Vienna by way of Moravia. And yet Freud told Sândor Ferenczi in 1922 that as he studied his own collection of antiquities (Egyptian, Greek, and Roman) he felt "strange secret yearnings—perhaps for my ancestral heritage" (quoted in Gay 1988, 172), thus seeking his own Jewish patrimony in the art of the Mediterranean world. Indeed, Grazieila Magherini (1995) has observed that through out his writings Freud traced his own family's history back from Vienna, Leipzig, Moravia, Galicia, Lithuania, and Cologne to Palestine and Rome (129). The theme endured and developed in Freud's thought, and the imagist poet H.D. reminisced about Freud at home in the 1930s amid his own collection of sculptured artifacts, stating that "he is part and parcel of these treasures. . . . He has his family, the tradition of an unbroken family, reaching back through this old heart of the Roman Empire, further into the Holy Land" (1945, 97). Interwoven with Lamarckian assumptions about the evolu tion of the individual and his race (ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny), Freud persistently saw his own Jewish origins in the world of classical antiquity. In a letter of 1934 to Suzanne Cassirer Bernfeld, he wrote, "none of us [Jews] has ever lost his longing for the Mediterranean" (quoted in Bernfeld 1951, 112). And in his Moses and Monotheism (1939) he proclaimed, probably in response to Austrian anti-Semitic writers such as Walter Rathau, who called the Jews "a separate strange race, an Asiatic horde" (quoted in Gilman 1993, 162), that 'Jews are not fundamentally different, for they are not Asiatics of a</page><page sequence="5">Mary Bergstein 13 foreign race, as their enemies would maintain, but composed for the most part of remnants of the Mediterranean peoples and heirs of the Mediterranean civilization" (Freud 1939, 91). He went on to assert that the "archaic heritage" of the Jews was present in innate phylogenetic "memory traces" (98-100). This quest for retrievable memory traces is, of course, pro foundly allied with the process of psychoanalysis itself. Throughout his life, Freud longed for a reconciliation of his own Jewishness with Western culture through the vehicles of humanism, science, and art. In 1901, Solomon J. Solomon declared that "how far he can assimilate what is best of Hellenic influence without prejudice to his individuality is clearly one of the chief problems that beset the modern Jew" (554). In Freud's day scholars of Judaism, especially those writing in the Protestant cultures of England and the United States, emphasized the principle that Hellenic and Jewish cultures were essentially antagonistic (Bland 2000, 3-58). Renaissance civilization, which flourished under the Church of Rome, like the Hellenic civilization it revived, created a high point of anthropomorphic, pagan art, the alluring forms of which inspired, according to Heinrich Graetz, "sumptuousness and perfidy" as opposed to Jewish monotheism, where the pursuit of pure spirit and intellect was counter to the Greek multiplicity of anthropomorphic gods with human-like pas sions (1846, 88). Writers such as Solomon and Graetz (177) were particularly disturbed by the fact that Greco-Roman deities were gendered female and male, and therefore subject to the frailties of their sex. But since Freud's intellectual work was primarily about human frailties, bodies, and emotions, his interest in classically inspired art was justified. Freud searched for psychological insights in the art, especially the sculpture, of the past. His personal library contained numerous books illustrated with photographs of the idealized heroic nude in classical or Renaissance sculpture, including the sculpture of Michelangelo. The studying of such images for scientific purposes—archeology and art history were considered mod ern scientific disciplines that advanced historical knowledge of humankind—trumped the Jewish prohibition on gazing at anthropomorphic representation of immortals or the aggran dized classical nude.</page><page sequence="6">14 The Dying Slave at Berggasse 19 It is well known that Freud, possibly modeling himself on his mentor, Jean-Martin Charcot, was an ardent collector of antiquities. Most prominent in his collection were small-scale sculptured anthropomorphic figures arranged in ranks on desks and bookshelves like idols or votive offerings on altars. The objects themselves came from the ancient Middle East, Greece, Rome, and China, and many of them had actually been used as idols, dolls, or votive objects in antiquity. H.D. remembered the hours she spent in analysis at Berggasse 19: "Around us are the old images, or 'dolls' of pre-dynastic Egypt, and Moses was perhaps not yet born when that little Ra or Nut or Ka figures on the Professor's desk was first hammered by a forger-priest of Ptah on the banks of the Nile" (1945, 42). Freud believed that some of his smaller objects were magic charms used for personal protection and augury in primitive religious practices. In other words, the function of most of the sculpture had originally been precisely antithetical to the Mosaic teaching that abhorred the lure of graven images along with magic and sorcery. Although only a few of his statuettes could be properly classified as lares familiares (the little sculp tured household deities of ancient Rome), they seemed, as a collection, to function for Freud as the charms of a very personal lararium. But it is important to emphasize that these meaningful figures, historically charged as they were with a kind of interior efficacy, were not meant to be worshiped in this new context of the consulting rooms, but rather to be contemplated in the service of psychological revelations. The art historian Ivan Gaskell has recently (2000) argued in favor of the psychothera peutic benefit of art museums, and has compared the experi ence of a museum visit to the psychoanalytic session. Accord ing to Gaskell, a museum visit can provide psychological adventure and release of formerly repressed feelings in an environment that is protected from the indiscriminate vio lence of the world (197-209). Apropos this idea, it is signifi cant that in his consulting rooms, in the words of H.D., "Sigmund Freud was like a curator in a museum, surrounded by his priceless collection of Greek, Egyptian and Chinese treasures" (1933, 116). As instruments of the imagination, these works of sculpture constituted a working museum of the</page><page sequence="7">Mary Bergstein 15 most therapeutic and provocative kind, for doctor and patients alike. They stood silently, like so many sphinxes before Oedi pus, rich with the secrets of ancient history and the mysteries of the human mind. The sculpture of Michelangelo was present at Berggasse 19 in both two and three dimensions, that is, in plaster reproductions as well as photographs in books. Freud's "Moses of Michelangelo" relied heavily on one particular book and its numerous citations, Henry Thode's Michelangelo: Kritische Untersuchungen über seine Werke (Michelangelo: Critical Investiga tions of his Works) of 1908, in which the most dramatic and poetical statements about the Moses by earlier art historians were reiterated, excerpted, and quoted verbatim. Freud used Thode's book as a working bibliography, underscoring the observations of various authors whose commentaries on Michelangelo's Moses he would pursue. Thode's monograph served as a literary source and a jumping-off point for virtually all his ideas about Michelangelo prior to 1914. But Freud was drawn to Michelangelo's sculpture long before he composed his essay on the Moses. In a letter to Wilhelm Fliess of December 6, 1896, Freud communicated several important new concepts, including the distinction between unconscious and preconscious thought. He added, "I have now adorned my room with plaster casts of Florentine statues. It was a source of extraordinary invigoration for me" (Masson 1985, 214). Michelangelo's Slave at his side in the later photograph may have been one of the "Florentine statues" in question. Whether or not the plaster copy was purchased in Florence, Freud had known the statue of the Slave since the days of his residency in Paris in 1885-86, when he viewed it at the Louvre, along with the Venus de Milo and other familiar works of ancient and Renaissance sculpture. In fact, the "Dying Slave," made by Michelangelo circa 1514 (as a personification of the arts dormant and fettered after the death of Pope Julius II) was the first work by Michelangelo that Freud ever encountered in the flesh, together with the "Rebel lious Slave" from the same tomb project. (Like the even more famous Moses in San Pietro in Vincoli in Rome, these figures were originally destined for the tomb of Julius II.) On the occasion of his first visit to the Louvre in 1885, he described</page><page sequence="8">16 The Dying Slave at Berggasse 19 the museum to his fiancée Martha as "a world as in a dream" (E. Freud et al. 1998, 121), probably alluding to the fact that he had known so many of the works of art as photographic reproductions before seeing them in actuality, like the "real sphinxes" he also referred to in his letter. The lure of "sumptuousness and perfidy" in pagan art was typified by Michelangelo's Slave, a languid yet heroic work that has been described by Howard Hibbard (1974) as Michelangelo's "most hedonistic and voluptuous homage to the male body" (152). And Freud's photographic self-align ment with a three-dimensional reproduction of Michelangelo's statue seems to proclaim a kind of manifesto of classicism, romanticism, and psychological (if not visual) modernity that is at once defiant, with respect to the Jewish tradition of aniconism, and self-defining, in terms of Freud's own work on sleep, dreams, and the unconscious mind. Clearly, as Howard Hibbard used to tell his students at Columbia, the nude Slave looks as though he would be more comfortable lying down. In the art-historical literature read by Freud at this time, Michelangelo's Slave was described as a somnolent absent presence, asleep and probably dreaming, if not really "dying" (Thode 1908, 210-12). Authors known to Freud through Thode, such as Symonds, Grimm, Wölfflin, and Justi, emphasized the fluidity between the waking state and dream state, and the fruitful conditions of sleep, death, and enchantment in this particular statue. The nude athlete-hero was suspended in a state in which, according to John Addington Symonds, "the sleeping mind of the immortal youth is musing upon solemn dreams" (quoted in Thode 1908, 211). Justi talked of the figure's consciousness being released, or un locked, during his immersion in sleep. The words of these art historians resonate with implicitly Freudian precepts and re call those of contemporary psychologists whose books were also in Freud's library. Among the authors read by Freud were Santé De Sanctis, who discussed concepts of slippage between the waking and dream-states in cases of intoxication and hysteria in his classic treatise on dreams, I Sogni (1899), and the American William A. Hammond of Bellevue Hospital in New York, who wrote (1892) about sleep, somnambulism, reverie, and hypnotism.</page><page sequence="9">Mary Bergstein 17 Freud also owned the two-volume book on adolescence by the developmental psychologist G. Stanley Hall, whose work was published in 1904, four years prior to Henry Thode's Michelangelo monograph. Hall's poetic ruminations on the beneficent effects of education on the beautiful, athletic young men of ancient Greece, and on the developmental processes of sleeping and dreaming in adolescence (1904, 2:258-62), are startling in their accord with the classicizing, spiritual, style of art history to be found in the pages of Thode's monograph. Hall might just as well have been talking about Michelangelo's nude Slave when he wrote that the presentiments and previsions of love, which often first arise spontaneously and naturally in sleep, seem to illustrate the old trope that the stars of other and larger systems come out best when the sun of our own personal consciousness has set. Indeed in the reverie and day dreaming common at this stage [adolescence], when the soul transcends its individual limitations and expatiates over the whole field of humanity, past, present, or future it is perhaps quite as near the world as our habitual, but generally unremembered dreams, as it is to the waking world of memory. In the new horizon now opening to the mind, unconscious cerebration generally has a larger role and for a time it is more uncontrolled by the consciousness, over into which it shades by impercep tible gradations. (2:262-63) To the extent that the accessibility of repressed ideation to acute observation by an outside analyst was the crucial basis for psychoanalysis, Michelangelo's Slave, clothed in the guise of heroic nudity and conceived as a personification of the uncon scious mind, ennobled much of the seemingly enigmatic or arcane material of Freudian thought. The statue and its art historical critique emphasized a psychological state that was well below (or beyond) the surface of awareness. At the time the photographic portrait was made, the idea of the uncon scious was the signature concept of Freud's psychoanalytic system. The unconscious was the most important and interesting region of the human mind, a terra incognita to be explored by pioneer</page><page sequence="10">18 The Dying Slave at Berggasse 19 ing psychoanalysts. In contrast with the plaster statue, who seems to be asleep and possibly dreaming, Freud's own concentrated expression in the photograph signifies a maximum awareness, the outward, inquiring, scientific gaze of the analytic observer. In conclusion, a reading of this photographic image of Freud, together with its range of poses and its relation between bodies animate and inanimate, waking and sleeping, furnishes insights into the method of psychoanalysis. The decontextual ization of the Slave from its role as a papal tomb figure, its status as a reproductive copy, and its presence in Freud's home all transformed its meaning. The photographic "snapshot" utilized a turn-of-the-century view of Michelangelo's sculpture to enhance Freud's self-definition as a thinker. This would have been especially apparent to the eyes of early twentieth century people, who, at the expense of social-historical con text, put a premium on the geistige (spiritual, psychological) aspects of Michelangelo's art. Michelangelo's cultural-philosophical system was, of course, vastly different from that of Freud, who looked back at the Renaissance from an interval of four centuries. But the image in question does not represent an anachronistic perversion of Michelangelo's sixteenth-century world-view; rather it portrays a meaningful episode in the historiography of art. Likewise, the photographic portrait of Freud with Michelangelo's Slave as an iconographie attribute is a salient visual document in the history of psychoanalysis. Throughout his long life, Michelangelo's artistic vocabulary was concerned with inani mate bodies and states of sleep, death, and dreaming: Caro m'è 'I sonno, e più Vesser di sasso Mentre che'I danno e la vergogna dura: Non veder, non sentir, m'è gran Ventura; Perô non mi destar, deh, Parla basso. (Sleep is dear to me, and being of stone is dearer, as long as injury and shame endure; not to see or hear is a great boon to me; therefore, do not wake me—pray, speak softly.) (Saslow 1991, 419)</page><page sequence="11">Mary Bergstein 19 Indeed, for the beholder of this photograph, now as then, Michelangelo's famous sonnet, "Caro m' è 'I sonno," may well take on a new, Freudian, meaning.
