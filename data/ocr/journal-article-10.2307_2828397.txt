<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANIMALS AND WHY THEY MATTER. By Mary Midgley. The University of Georgia Press, Athens (Georgia). $14.00. 158 p.; ill.; index. 1983. Questions of our moral relations with animals do not go away by being ignored. Scientists in general and biologists in particular have found that these issues are becoming more pressing. This brief book provides an excellent introduction to the concepts of rights and equality as they have been used to promote or dismiss the notion that animals and other living things should be the ob- jects of moral concern. The approach succeeds in being both scholarly and pragmatic, while clearly promoting the notion that animals do matter. "Ethics is practical," we are told, ". . . ideals which nobody can translate into action are wasted" (p. 19). Midgely deals head-on with the touchy issue of competition of interests between animals and man. She notes that many writers assume that vegetarianism settles the issue, but this does not resolve the questions of our ethical obligations, if any, to crop pests, parasites, and microorganisms. Lines of interest will always have to be drawn, so much of the book is devoted to an analysis of how we have traditionally done this, and how we might consider changing our approach. Although we tend to favor the interests of ourselves and those that are socially or biologically close, each of us constructs a web of concerns based on many different criteria such as special need, prudence, admiration, and gratitude. Often what is needed most is respect for one another's moral maps. A common criticism of arguments in support of animal rights is that they are "emotional." Midgley clearly reveals the emotionality in the arguments of proponents as well as opponents of various uses of animals, demonstrating that "strong feeling is fully appropriate to well-grounded belief on im- portant subjects." Rationality and sensitivity thrive in concert but die in isolation. After taking to task those who dismiss the needs of animals by invoking legal and political defini- tions of rights and equality, Midgley is equally critical of arguments that ignore biological reality, especially the use of the term "speciesism" to de- note differential treatment analogous to racism. Species differences are clearly significant, but how</page><page sequence="2">198 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY [VOLUME 60 can these differences be reflected in the extent to which animals matter? The differences that seem to matter to us in- clude the ability to bond and communicate, and the underlying consciousness suggested by those abilities. We succeed as social creatures because we can relate our own experiences to those of others. Anthropon-iorphism is often a useful way of understanding animals because of the evolu- tionary continuity of emotional experiences across species. Our avoidance of anthropomorphic terms, she argues, is metaphysical rather than scientific, since it threatens to commit us to the uncomfort- able ethical stance that animals matter more than we have allowed. Midgley sees scientists and philosophers as pen- guins on an icefloe, eager for the nutritious facts below, but hesitant to take the plunge until they are sure they won't be consumed by hidden dangers. She is clearly amohg the brave few who have taken the plunge, and she has found the wa- ter to be most invigorating.
